				<td>Description<br>
The invention relates to a user and to a master unit in<br>
a communication system having a number of users which<br>
are connected to one another via a dual-ring structure<br>
operating in opposite directions, to such a<br>
communication system having a master-slave structure<br>
and to a method for operating the user and the<br>
communication system, respectively.<br>
In production and automation technology, serial bus<br>
systems are increasingly used in which the remotely<br>
arranged devices of machine peripherals such as I/O<br>
modules, transducers, drives, valves and operator<br>
terminals communicate with automation, engineering or<br>
visual display systems via an efficient real-time<br>
communication system. In this arrangement, all users<br>
are networked together via a serial bus, preferably via<br>
a field bus, the data exchange via the bus being<br>
carried out, as a rule, on the basis of the master-<br>
slave principle.<br>
The active bus users on the bus system, the control<br>
devices, as a rule, possess a bus access authorization<br>
and determine the data transfer on the bus. The active<br>
bus users are called the master units in the serial bus<br>
system. In contrast, passive bus users are, as a rule,<br>
machine peripheral devices. They do not receive a bus<br>
access authorization, i.e. they are only allowed to<br>
acknowledge received information signals or transfer<br>
information signals to a master unit on request by the<br>
latter. Passive bus users are called slave units in the<br>
serial bus system.<br><br><br>
To avoid complex cabling, field bus systems having a<br>
master-slave structure are generally arranged in ring<br>
topology, all bus users being connected to a ring-<br>
shaped transmission path. An information signal<br>
generated by the master unit is fed into the ring-<br>
shaped transmission path by the master unit and<br>
successively passes through the slave units serially<br>
connected to the ring-shaped transmission path and is<br>
then received again by the master unit and evaluated.<br>
Master-slave systems can also be designed as multi-<br>
master systems.<br>
As a rule, the information signals are organized by the<br>
master unit into data packets which are composed of<br>
control data and useful data, preferably using the<br>
Ethernet standard which provides for data packets<br>
having a length of up to 1500 bytes with a transmission<br>
speed which, at the same time, is high at 100 Mbit/sec.<br>
Each of the slave units connected to the ring-shaped<br>
transmission path exchanges the useful data intended<br>
for it with the Ethernet message when the Ethernet<br>
message fed in by the master unit passes through on the<br>
ring-shaped transmission path.<br>
As a rule, the master-slave communication systems with<br>
ring structure are configured in such a manner that the<br>
master unit has a transmitting unit as data injection<br>
point and a receiving unit as data extraction point<br>
into a transmission medium. The individual slave units<br>
are then connected together on the transmission path to<br>
form a chain, wherein each user is connected to two<br>
neighbors and the first and last user in the chain is<br>
connected to the master unit. The data packets are<br>
transmitted in one direction starting from the master<br>
unit via its transmitting unit to the first slave unit<br>
connected and from there to the next one, until the<br>
last slave unit in the chain is reached, and then back<br>
to the receiving unit of the master unit. Each slave<br><br><br>
unit has, for receiving the circulating data packets<br>
from the previous user, an interface with a receiving<br>
unit and, for forwarding to the following user, an<br>
interface with a transmitting unit, a processing unit<br>
being arranged between receiving and transmitting unit<br>
in order to process the data packets passing through<br>
the slave unit, i.e. to exchange the useful data<br>
allocated to the slave unit with the data packets.<br>
The ring-shaped communication system with master-slave<br>
structure is often designed in such a manner that the<br>
master unit forms a physical line with the slave units<br>
arranged at it, the transmission medium having a dual-<br>
line structure and each slave unit having two ports<br>
with a combined transmitting/receiving unit,<br>
transmitting and receiving unit being short-circuited<br>
in the output port of the last slave unit in the<br>
transmission chain. The data packets injected into the<br>
first line by the master unit via its receiving unit<br>
are processed by the slave units on the forward path<br>
and are then simply forwarded only to the receiving<br>
unit of the master unit on the return path via the<br>
second line.<br>
A central requirement for master-slave communication<br>
systems, particularly when they are used in production<br>
and process automation, is a high fault tolerance, that<br>
is to say the capability of the communication system to<br>
maintain the required function, i.e., for example, the<br>
 production of a workpiece, in spite of the occurrence<br>
of faults. In this context, faults in the communication<br>
system which must be overcome without impairment of the<br>
process are, in addition to faults in the data packets,<br>
also the failure of entire transmission links, in<br>
 particular, for example due to physical separation of<br>
the transmission medium.<br><br><br>
To achieve a fault-tolerant master-slave communication<br>
system, particularly in the case of link faults,<br>
i.e. in the case of the failure of entire transmission<br>
sections, dual-ring structures operating in opposite<br>
directions are frequently used. Thus, a communication<br>
system having a master-slave structure in which the<br>
master unit is serially connected to a multiplicity of<br>
slave units via two communication paths operating in<br>
opposite directions, is described in US 4,663,748,<br>
wherein the master unit simultaneously sends out the<br>
data packets over two communication paths. The slave<br>
unit then has two processing units which are in each<br>
case connected between the two communication paths in<br>
order to process the data messages passing through.<br>
Furthermore, coupling units which can be activated are<br>
arranged in the users, so that when a link fault<br>
occurs, e.g. a break in a communication line, it<br>
reconfigures the communication system by monitoring the<br>
signals on both transmission rings and correspondingly<br>
switching over the communication system, in such a<br>
manner that a failure due to the link fault of a<br>
greater section of the communication system or even a<br>
total failure is prevented.<br>
In DE 103 12 907 A1, it is also proposed to arrange the<br>
slave unit in such a manner that on each communication<br>
path in the direction of data transmission, first a<br>
processing unit and then a multiplexer having two<br>
inputs and one output is arranged. The multiplexer is<br>
connected with its inputs in each case to the two<br>
processing units of the slave unit and connected with<br>
its output to the associated communication path. In<br>
fault-free normal operation, each of the two<br>
multiplexers switches through the processing unit<br>
arranged on the associated communication path. In fault<br>
mode, when a link fault occurs on the associated<br>
communication path, however, the processing unit on the<br>
other communication path is then switched through. This<br><br><br>
design of the slave unit enables the communication<br>
system to be reconfigured essentially in real time in<br>
the fault case.<br>
However, fault-tolerant master-slave communication<br>
systems having a dual-ring structure, in which the<br>
individual slave units in each case have two processing<br>
units for processing the data message passing through,<br>
provide for high hardware and switching complexity of<br>
the slave units and thus increase the cost.<br>
Furthermore, each slave unit must decide in normal<br>
operation which of the two data packets passing through<br>
the two processing units should be used for device<br>
control which greatly restricts the use of such<br>
communication systems at the required high data<br>
transmission rates. In addition, the known fault-<br>
tolerant communication systems with dual-ring topology<br>
require that the master unit responds separately to a<br>
link fault and switches from normal operation into<br>
fault operating mode.<br>
From US 2004/0008719, a master unit for a master-slave<br>
communication system having the features of claim 1 and<br>
a method for operating a master-slave communication<br>
system having the features of the preamble of claim 9<br>
is known. A communication system having a fault-<br>
tolerant dual-ring structure is also represented in<br>
US 4,527,270, EP 0 605 795 A2 and GB 2 348 782 and<br>
EP 1 271 854.<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a master<br>
unit for a master-slave communication system and a<br>
method for operating a master-slave communication<br>
system which provide for reconfiguration measures in<br>
real time on the occurrence of link faults in a fault-<br><br><br>
tolerant dual-ring topology, with minimum hardware and<br>
switching complexity in the master unit.<br>
This object is achieved by a master unit as claimed in<br>
claim 1 and a method 'as "claimed in claim 9. Preferred<br>
developments are specified in the dependent claims.<br>
According to the invention, a user in a communication<br>
system having a number of users which are connected to<br>
one another via a first communication path and a second<br>
communication path, the two communication paths<br>
operating as dual-ring structure in opposite directions<br><br><br>
to one another, is designed in such a manner that the<br>
user has in each case one receiving unit for receiving<br>
information signals on the associated communication<br>
path, and in each case one transmitting unit for<br>
transmitting information signals on the associated<br>
communication path, for each communication path. In<br>
addition, a single processing unit, having an input and<br>
an output, for processing information signals passing<br>
through the user, and a coupling unit which can be<br>
activated is provided. In normal operation, this<br>
coupling unit which can be activated connects the first<br>
receiving and transmitting unit belonging to the first<br>
communication path, the processing unit being<br>
interposed for processing the information signals<br>
passing through, and the second receiving and<br>
transmitting unit belonging to the second communication<br>
path, to one another. In the fault case of the first<br>
transmitting unit and/or the second receiving unit,<br>
i.e. when a link fault to the user occurs, the coupling<br>
unit which can be activated then connects the first<br>
receiving unit to the second transmitting unit via the<br>
processing unit and in fault mode of the first<br>
receiving unit and/or of the second transmitting unit,<br>
i.e. again when a link fault occurs to the adjoining<br>
user, the second receiving unit to the first<br>
transmitting unit via the processing unit.<br>
With this layout of the user in a fault-tolerant<br>
communication system with a dual-ring topology, a user<br>
reconfiguration can be carried out in real time when<br>
link faults occur to adjacent users on one or on both<br>
communication paths, in order to provide for faultless<br><br><br>
operation in spite of the link fault. Thus, the<br>
operation of the user, and thus the operation of the<br>
communication system to which the user is connected,<br>
can be maintained in spite of the link fault. The<br>
design according to the invention has the advantage<br>
that only a single processing unit is provided in each<br>
user which reduces the hardware complexity, and thus<br>
the costs. In addition, the behavior of the user in the<br>
case of redundancy, that is to say when a link fault<br>
occurs, does not differ from the behavior in normal<br>
operation since the information signals passing through<br>
are always interpreted and processed by the one<br>
processing unit present when passing through. This, at<br>
the same time, provides for a wide dynamic range during<br>
the switching process and thus for meeting the real-<br>
time requirements for the communication system.<br>
It is preferred in this context to design the coupling<br>
device which can be activated of the user in the form<br>
of a first multiplexer, the first input of which is<br>
connected to the first receiving unit, the second input<br>
of which is connected to the second receiving unit and<br>
the output of which is connected to the processing<br>
unit, and of a second multiplexer, the first input of<br>
which is connected to the second receiving unit, the<br>
second input of which is connected to the processing<br>
unit and the output of which is connected to the second<br>
transmitting unit, the first multiplexer, in normal<br>
operation, connecting its first input to its output<br>
and, in fault mode of the first receiving unit and/or<br>
the second transmitting unit, connecting its second<br>
input to its output, and the second multiplexer, in<br>
normal operation, connecting its first input to its<br>
output and in fault mode of the first transmitting unit<br>
and/or of the second receiving unit connecting its<br>
second input to its output.<br><br><br>
The design according to the invention of the coupling<br>
device which can be activated, with two 2-1<br>
multiplexers which precede or follow the processing<br>
unit, ensures, in the fault case, that, depending on<br>
the position of the link fault occurring, the<br>
information signal is always conducted through the user<br>
in such a manner that the information signal, after<br>
passing through the processing unit, is fed back. Using<br>
2-1 multiplexers only entails a slight hardware<br>
complexity and, in addition, provides for switching<br>
between normal operation and fault mode in a simple and<br>
highly dynamic manner.<br>
According to the invention, a master unit in a<br>
communication system having a master-slave structure,<br>
which has a multiplicity of users as slave units, is<br>
arranged in such a manner that the slave units are<br>
connected serially with the master unit via the dual-<br>
ring structure formed from the first and the second<br>
communication path and operating in opposite<br>
directions. In this arrangement, the master structure<br>
has for each communication path an associated<br>
transmitting and receiving unit, the transmitting units<br>
being connected to a transmit control unit and the<br>
receiving units being connected to a receive control<br>
unit. In this arrangement, the transmit control unit<br>
transfers to the two transmitting units of the master<br>
unit an information signal with a data field and a<br>
counter field, set to a predetermined value, for<br>
 separately transmitting in opposite directions on the<br>
first and on the second communication path. When the<br>
information signal passes through, the processing units<br>
of each user alter the value of the counter field by a<br>
predetermined value. The control unit then evaluates<br>
 the value of the counter fields of the two information<br>
signal received on the first and the second<br>
communication path by the receiving units.<br><br><br>
Given the design of the communication system according<br>
to the invention, the master unit has in a simple<br>
manner the capability of determining the freedom from<br>
faults in the communication system, especially in the<br>
case of a reconfiguration of the communication system<br>
after the occurrence of a link fault. After evaluation<br>
of the counter fields after reception of the two<br>
identical information signals circulating in opposite<br>
directions via the communication paths, the master unit<br>
can determine how many of the slave units connected are<br>
in operation. This is because the processing units in<br>
the active slave units in each case alter the value of<br>
the counter field of the information signal passing<br>
through with the aid of their processing unit, as a<br>
result of which conclusions regarding the operability<br>
of the slave units can then be drawn on evaluation of<br>
the counter fields of the two information signals<br>
received in the master unit. By correlating the values<br>
in the counter fields of the two information signals<br>
received, it can also be determined between which users<br>
the link fault has occurred in the communication system<br>
or, respectively, whether or where a user has<br>
completely failed.<br>
In this context, the counter fields of the two<br>
circulating information signals received on the first<br>
and second communication path are preferably evaluated<br>
by adding together the counter field values. The total<br>
value then immediately specifies whether all connected<br>
slave units are active, since their number is directly<br>
reflected in the aggregate value.<br>
According to the invention, the fault tolerance of the<br>
communication system is increased further in a simple<br>
manner due to the fact that in read mode, i.e. when the<br>
slave units are intended to transmit data to the master<br>
unit, an information signal with a data field which has<br>
an associated data area for each connected user at the<br><br><br>
communication system is transferred to the two<br>
transmitting units by the transmit control unit of the<br>
master unit. These two information signals are then<br>
sent separately and in opposite directions on the first<br>
and the second communication path, the users writing<br>
into the associated data area when the information<br>
signal passes through. The receive control unit of the<br>
master unit then superimposes the data fields of the<br>
two information signals received on the first<br>
communication path and the second communication path.<br>
Given this procedure, the operability of the<br>
communication system guarantees reliable read mode in a<br>
simple manner, particularly also in the case of<br>
redundancy, that is to say when the communication<br>
system is reconfigured due to a link fault and<br>
individual users have switched to fault mode. This is<br>
because, by superimposing the data fields of the two<br>
information signals received, i.e. particularly by<br>
oring them, a combined data field is generated in which<br>
regardless of how the information signals are fed back<br>
to the master unit via the communication paths, all<br>
data to be transmitted by the users are contained.<br>
Thus, the procedure according to the invention provides<br>
for high fault tolerance, particularly in the case of<br>
link faults in the dual-ring topology, in a simple<br>
manner. Furthermore, the evaluating method of the<br>
master unit in reconfiguration mode does not differ<br>
from that in normal mode.<br>
The invention will be explained in greater detail with<br>
reference to the attached drawings, in which:<br>
figure 1 shows a diagrammatic representation of a<br>
communication system according to the invention having<br>
a master-slave structure, wherein<br>
figure 1A represents normal mode,<br><br><br>
figure 1B represents a first communication system<br>
reconfiguration on the occurrence of a dual link fault,<br>
and<br>
figure 1C represents a second communication system<br>
reconfiguration in the case of the failure of a slave<br>
unit; and<br>
figure 2 shows a diagrammatic representation of a user<br>
according to the invention.<br>
In automation technology, field bus systems are<br>
increasingly used in which devices of the machine<br>
peripherals, arranged in distributed manner,<br>
communicate with automation, engineering and visual<br>
display systems via a field bus. As a rule, the field<br>
bus system has a serial bus which can be, for example,<br>
an electrical line, an optical waveguide or a radio<br>
cable. All bus users are then connected to this field<br>
bus, a distinction being made between active bus users<br>
and passive bus users. The active bus users on the<br>
field bus system are the master units which determine<br>
the data traffic on the bus. Such a master unit is, for<br>
example, an industrial PC which is used as process<br>
control computer in a production process. This master<br>
unit has a bus access authorization and can output data<br>
to the field bus without external request. The passive<br>
bus users on the bus system are peripheral machine<br>
devices, for example I/O devices, valves, drives and<br>
transducers. They are used as slave units and do not<br>
obtain a bus access authorization, i.e. they are only<br>
allowed to acknowledge received information signals or<br>
to transmit information signals to a master unit on<br>
request by the latter.<br>
The communication standard used for data transmission<br>
in the master-slave system is preferably the Ethernet<br><br><br>
concept. In Ethernet communication systems, the data to<br>
be transmitted are encapsulated in data packets, also<br>
called messages in the further text, having a<br>
predetermined format. The Ethernet messages can have a<br>
data length of up to 1500 bytes containing,<br>
additionally to the useful data, control data which<br>
have a start identifier, a destination and source<br>
address, the data packet type and a fault mechanism.<br>
Ethernet communication systems having a master-slave<br>
structure are preferably designed in such a manner that<br>
the individual slave units are connected together via<br>
the transmission medium to form a chain, each slave<br>
unit being connected to two neighbors and the first and<br>
the last user in the chain being connected to the<br>
master unit so that a ring structure is obtained. In<br>
this arrangement, the data are transmitted in one<br>
direction starting from the master unit to the first<br>
adjacent slave unit and from there to the next one<br>
until the last slave unit and then back to the master<br>
unit.<br>
To ensure high fault tolerance, particularly in the<br>
case of a link fault in the communication system,<br>
i.e. the failure of entire transmission sections with<br>
slave units, e.g. due to a cable break, the<br>
communication systems having a master-slave structure<br>
often have two communication paths which operate in<br>
opposite direction to one another. Due to the dual-ring<br>
structure operating in opposite directions, the<br>
possibility exists in the case of link faults to carry<br>
out reconfiguration measures in the communication<br>
system in order to maintain the operability of the<br>
communication system in spite of link faults.<br>
Figure 1 shows in a basic circuit diagram such a fault-<br>
tolerant communication system in an embodiment<br>
according to the invention. The communication system<br><br><br>
has a master unit 1 which is connected serially to N<br>
slave units 3 via a dual-ring structure 2 . The dual-<br>
ring structure comprises two unidirectional<br>
communication paths 21, 22 which pass through the<br>
connected slave units 3 in opposite directions. The<br>
master unit 1 is connected to the first communication<br>
path 21 as a data extraction point via a first<br>
transmitting unit TX11 and to the second communication<br>
path 22 as data extraction point via a second<br>
transmitting unit TX12. Furthermore, the master unit 1<br>
has a first receiving unit RX13 as data injection point<br>
for the first communication path 21 and a second<br>
receiving unit RX14 as data injection point for the<br>
second communication path 22. The first transmitting<br>
unit TXll and the second transmitting unit TX12 are<br>
connected to a transmit control unit 16 via a first<br>
control line 15. The first receiving unit RX13 and the<br>
second receiving unit RX14 are connected via a second<br>
control line 17 and to a receive control unit 18.<br>
Each slave unit 3, in turn, has an interface, for<br>
receiving messages from a preceding user via the first<br>
communication path 21, with a first receiving unit RX31<br>
and an interface with a first transmitting unit TX32<br>
for forwarding to the next user via the first<br>
communication path 21. Furthermore, each slave unit 3<br>
has for receiving a circulating Ethernet message via<br>
the second communication path 22 from a preceding user<br>
an interface with a second receiving unit RX33 and, for<br>
forwarding to the following user, an interface with a<br>
second transmitting unit TX34. Between the first<br>
receiving unit RX31, the second receiving unit RX32,<br>
the first transmitting unit TX33 and the second<br>
transmitting unit TX34, a processing unit 3 5 and a<br>
coupling device 3 7 which can be activated, is also<br>
connected in each slave unit 3.<br><br><br>
The basic circuit diagram of a slave unit 3 is shown in<br>
greater detail in figure 2. In the slave unit 3, the<br>
first receiving unit RX31 which is connected to the<br>
first communication path 21, and the second<br>
transmitting unit TX34 which is connected to the second<br>
communication path 22, are grouped as port 0. The<br>
second receiving unit RX33 which is connected to a<br>
second communication path 22, and the first<br>
transmitting unit TX32 which is connected to the first<br>
communication path 21, are organized as port 1.<br>
The coupling device 37 which can be activated has a<br>
first change-over switch 38 and a second change-over<br>
switch 39 which are in each case designed as 2-1<br>
multiplexers. The receiving and transmitting unit 31,<br>
32, 33, 34, the multiplexers 38, 39 of the coupling<br>
device 37 which can be activated, and the processing<br>
unit 3 5 are interconnected in this arrangement in the<br>
manner shown by arrows in figure 2 by a line network<br>
40.<br>
The output of the first receiving unit RX31 is<br>
connected to the first input of the first multiplexer<br>
38. The second input of the first multiplexer 38 is<br>
connected to the second receiving unit RX33. The output<br>
of the first multiplexer 3 8 is also connected to the<br>
processing unit 35. The second multiplexer 39, in turn,<br>
is connected with its first input to the second<br>
receiving unit RX33 and with its second input to the<br>
output of the processing unit 35. The output of the<br>
second multiplexer 39 is connected to the second<br>
transmitting unit TX34. In addition, the output of the<br>
processing unit 35 is also connected to the first<br>
transmitting unit TX32 via the line network 40.<br>
In the case of fault-free normal operation of the<br>
communication system as shown in figure 1A, the<br>
transmit control unit 16 of the master unit transfers<br><br><br>
to the first transmitting unit TXll and the second<br>
transmitting unit TX12 a message which is then sent by<br>
the two transmitting units simultaneously in opposite<br>
directions via the first communication path 21 and the<br>
second communication path 22. In this process, the<br>
messages pass in opposite directions through the<br>
connected slave units 3, all coupling devices 37 which<br>
can be activated in the slave units 3 being connected<br>
in such a manner that the input of the processing unit<br>
35 is connected to the first receiving unit RX31, the<br>
output of the processing unit 3 5 is connected to the<br>
first transmitting unit TX32 and the second receiving<br>
unit RX33 is connected to the second transmitting unit<br>
TX34.<br>
In this operating mode of the slave units 3, the<br>
coupling device 37 which can be activated ensures that<br>
the two identical messages circulating in opposite<br>
directions on the first communication path 21 and on<br>
the second communication path 22 always pass through<br>
the slave unit in such a manner that only the messages<br>
transmitted via the first communication path 21 are<br>
processed by the processing unit 35. In contrast, the<br>
message circulating on the second communication path 22<br>
is only passed through by the slave units 3 and arrives<br>
again unprocessed at the master unit 1. The two<br>
messages circulating in opposite directions via the<br>
first and second communication path 21, 22 are in this<br>
case recognized by the first receiving unit RX13 and<br>
the second receiving unit RX14 of the master unit 1 and<br>
forwarded via the second control line 17 to the receive<br>
control unit 18 for evaluation.<br>
In the design according to the invention, therefore,<br>
the coupling device 37 which can be activated and<br>
consists of the two 2-1 multiplexers 38, is controlled<br>
in fault-free normal operation in such a manner that of<br>
the two identical messages which circulate on the two<br><br><br>
communication paths 21, 22 simultaneously but in the<br>
opposite direction, only the message on the first<br>
communication path 21 is conducted through the<br>
processing unit 35 of the slave units 3 for processing.<br>
The message circulating on the second communication<br>
path 22 serves as redundancy and is fed back unchanged<br>
to the master unit 1.<br>
The communication system according to the invention,<br>
having a master-slave structure in which the slave<br>
units are serially connected to the master unit via two<br>
dual-ring structures which operate in opposite<br>
directions, only a single processing unit 35 being<br>
provided in each slave unit 3, also has the capability<br>
in the fault case, i.e. on the occurrence of a link<br>
fault, for reconfiguring the communication paths in the<br>
individual slave units in order to thus maintain the<br>
operability of the overall communication system.<br>
Figure 1B shows a dual link fault between the slave<br>
unit M and the slave unit M+1. Figure 1C represents a<br>
complete failure of the slave unit M which is<br>
equivalent to the occurrence of two dual link faults,<br>
one between slave unit M-1 and the slave unit M and<br>
between the slave unit M+1 and the slave unit M. When<br>
such a dual link fault occurs, the coupling device 37,<br>
which can be activated, of the slave units 3 is driven<br>
in such a manner that the message arriving either on<br>
the first communication path 21 or the second<br>
communication path 22 is fed back to the master unit 1<br>
on the other communication path in each case, the<br>
message first always passing through the processing<br>
unit 35 of the slave unit 3.<br>
In the case of the dual link fault between the slave<br>
unit M and the slave unit M+1, shown in figure 1B, this<br>
occurs in such a manner that the slave units 1 to M-1<br>
and M+2 to M are in normal operation whereas the slave<br><br><br>
units M and M+1 are reconfigured. In the fault case<br>
shown in figure 1C, in which the slave unit M<br>
completely fails, the slave units 1 to M-2 and the<br>
slave units M+2 to M are in normal operation. Slave<br>
units M-1 and M+1, in contrast, are reconfigured.<br>
The reconfiguration is preferably triggered by the two<br>
ports 0 and 1 in the slave units 3. These two ports 0<br>
and 1 detect by means of a known detection process<br>
whether the slave unit can communicate with an<br>
adjoining slave unit. If a link fault is detected by<br>
port 0 or port 1, a corresponding fault mode is then<br>
carried out and the coupling device 34 which can be<br>
activated, of the slave unit is driven in the desired<br>
manner.<br>
In the case of a fault mode of port 1 as occurs in the<br>
dual link fault, shown in figure 1B, in the slave unit<br>
M and in the device failure, shown in figure 1C, in the<br>
slave unit M-1, the coupling device 37 which can be<br>
activated is driven in such a manner that the input of<br>
the processing unit 3 5 is connected to the first<br>
receiving unit RX31 and the output of the processing<br>
unit 35 is connected to the second transmitting unit<br>
TX34. The message circulating on the first<br>
communication path 21 is thus fed back to the second<br>
communication path 21 via the processing unit 35. In<br>
the case of the design of the coupling device 37 which<br>
can be activated, shown in figure 2, in the slave unit<br>
3 with the first multiplexer 3 8 and the second<br>
multiplexer 39, this occurs in such a manner that the<br>
second input of the second multiplexer 39 is connected<br>
to its output. The first multiplexer 3 8 remains in<br>
normal mode, in contrast.<br>
In the case of a fault mode of ports 0 in the slave<br>
unit 3, i.e. when the first receiving unit RX31 and/or<br>
the second transmitting unit TX34 detect an<br><br><br>
interruption of the communication path to the adjacent<br>
slave unit which occurs in the case of the dual link<br>
fault, shown in figure 1B, in slave M+1 and in the<br>
device failure, shown in figure 1C, in slave M+1, the<br>
coupling device 34 which can be activated, in the slave<br>
unit 3 is driven in such a manner that the input of the<br>
processing unit 35 is connected to the second receiving<br>
unit RX33 and the output of the processing unit 35 is<br>
connected to the first transmitting unit TX32 so that<br>
the message passing through on the second communication<br>
path 22, after processing in the processing unit 35, is<br>
fed back to the master unit 1 on the first<br>
communication path 21. In the embodiment, shown in<br>
figure 2, of the coupling device 34 which can be<br>
activated, this occurs in such a manner that the first<br>
multiplexer 3 8 switches its second input to its output<br>
whereas the second multiplexer 39 remains in normal<br>
mode.<br>
The procedure according to the invention thus makes it<br>
possible to carry out reconfiguration measures in the<br>
communication system in a slave unit having only one<br>
processing unit, with the aid of a dual-ring structure<br>
and a coupling device which can be activated, in a<br>
simple manner in order to ensure the operability of the<br>
communication system in the case of a link fault, the<br>
behavior of the slave units with respect to message<br>
processing in the redundancy case not differing from<br>
that in normal mode.<br>
Apart from the dual link fault shown in figures 1B and<br>
1C, in which the two communication paths to the<br>
adjacent user are interrupted, the procedure according<br>
to the invention also enables single link faults, in<br>
which only one communication path is interrupted, to be<br>
detected and to maintain the operability of the<br>
communication system by correspondingly reconfiguring<br>
the users adjoining the fault location.<br><br><br>
In the slave units 3, only one processing unit 3 5 is<br>
also always provided so that, in comparison with slave<br>
units having two processing units, no decision needs to<br>
be made about which processing unit is responsible for<br>
message processing.<br>
To achieve a high fault tolerance of the communication<br>
system with low hardware expenditure, particularly also<br>
in the master unit 1, the processing of the messages<br>
circulating in opposite directions on the first<br>
communication path 21 and the second communication path<br>
22 is carried out in such a manner that the processing<br>
during fault-free normal operation does not<br>
significantly differ from that in the case of a fault<br>
mode in which the operability of the communication<br>
system is maintained by reconfiguring the individual<br>
slave units in the case of link faults. The slave unit<br>
can be designed in the manner according to the<br>
invention. However, the possibility also exists to use<br>
slave units having a different switching configuration<br>
which can be used as part of a master-slave system<br>
having a dual-ring structure.<br>
According to the invention, the two messages received<br>
by the first receiving unit RX13 on the first<br>
communication path 21 and by the second receiving unit<br>
RX14 on the second communication path 22 in the master<br>
unit 1 are superimposed in the receive control unit 18<br>
in order to thus produce a single message. This is done<br>
preferably by oring the useful data of the two messages<br>
bit by bit.<br>
Furthermore, the messages in each case have in the<br>
control data area a counter field, the value of which<br>
is evaluated, preferably added together, in order to<br>
determine the operating state in the communication<br>
system, particularly the occurrence of a link fault.<br><br><br>
According to the invention, this is done in such a<br>
manner that the transmit control unit 16 of the master<br>
unit 1 transfers to the first transmitting unit TX11<br>
and to the second transmitting unit TX12 in each case<br>
an identical message with a data field and a counter<br>
field, set to a predetermined value, for separately<br>
sending in opposite directions on the first<br>
communication path 21 and the second communication path<br>
22. The processing unit 35 of each connected slave unit<br>
3 is also designed in such a manner that when the<br>
message passes through, the value of the counter field<br>
is altered by a predetermined value. In the receive<br>
control unit 18, the value of the counter field of the<br>
two messages received by the first receiving unit RX13<br>
on the first communication path 21 and by the second<br>
receiving unit RX14 on the second communication path 22<br>
is then in each case evaluated. From the values of the<br>
two counter fields, it is then possible to determine by<br>
simple addition whether all connected slave units are<br>
active.<br>
This is preferably done in such a manner that the<br>
counter field of the message is set to the value 0 in<br>
the case of sending in opposite directions and each<br>
processing unit 35, when the message passes through the<br>
slave unit 3, increments the value of the counter field<br>
by 1. Since due to the design of the users according to<br>
the invention, only one message is ever processed by<br>
the processing unit both in normal operation and in<br>
fault mode with reconfiguration of the user circuit,<br>
the added value of the counter fields of the two<br>
messages fed back to the master unit 1 specifies the<br>
number of active users. It is thus possible to<br>
determine whether all connected users are active or<br>
whether a total failure of one user has occurred,<br>
e.g. due to a double dual link fault as shown in<br>
figure 1C. In addition, it is possible to determine the<br>
precise position of the link fault, for example its<br><br>
occurrence between the slave unit M and slave unit M+1<br>
in figure 1B, by comparing the values in the two<br>
counter fields, using the known number of connected<br>
slave units as a basis.<br>
A fault-tolerant operation of the communication system,<br>
particularly also in the case of a reconfiguration of<br>
the communication system by altering the course of the<br>
signal in the users on occurrence of a link fault, is<br>
also achieved due to the fact that the two identical<br>
messages circulating in opposite directions on the<br>
first communication path 21 and the second<br>
communication path 22 are designed in such a manner<br>
that in the useful data field, a data area is allocated<br>
to each connected slave unit. The processing unit 35 of<br>
each slave unit 3 carries out a data exchange in the<br>
associated data area with the message passing through.<br>
In the receive control unit 18 of the master unit 1,<br>
the useful data fields of the two messages received by<br>
the first receiving unit RX13 on the first<br>
communication path 21 and by the second receiving unit<br>
RX14 on the second communication path 22 are then<br>
superimposed so that a common message is obtained. This<br>
superimposed message is always identical, regardless of<br>
whether the communication system is in normal operation<br>
or in fault mode on occurrence of a link fault, as long<br>
as all slave units 3 are still active.<br>
In read mode, when the slave units 3 are intended to<br>
transmit data to the master unit 1, a message which is<br>
set to the value 0 in the entire useful data field is<br>
transferred by the transmit control unit 16 of the<br>
master unit 1 via the first control line 15 to the two<br>
transmit units TX11, TX12. The processing units 35 of<br>
the slave units 3 then write the desired data into the<br>
associated useful data areas. The receive control unit<br>
18 of the master unit 1 subsequently ors the useful<br>
data fields of the two messages received by the first<br><br><br>
receiving unit RX13 on the first communication path 21<br>
and by the second receiving unit RX14 on the second<br>
communication path 22 in order to form a common<br>
message. Regardless of whether the communication system<br>
is in normal mode or in reconfiguration mode, the ored<br>
message always contains all data of the connected slave<br>
units 3 requested by the master unit 1.<br>
In write mode, in contrast, when the master unit 1<br>
wishes to transmit e.g. control commands to the slave<br>
units 3 via the first control line 15, the transmit<br>
control unit 16 of the master unit 1 transfers to the<br>
transmitting units TX11, TX12 a message having a useful<br>
data field which contains the data to be transmitted to<br>
the slave units 3 for simultaneous sending in opposite<br>
directions on the two communication paths 21, 22. The<br>
processing units 35 of the slave units 3 then extract<br>
the associated data from the message regardless of<br>
whether they are in normal mode or in reconfiguration<br>
mode. In principle, oring of the useful data fields of<br>
the two messages fed back to the master unit 1 and<br>
received by the first receiving unit RX13 and second<br>
receiving unit RX14 is no longer required. Such an<br>
oring process leads to a common message with a useful<br>
data field which corresponds to the useful data field<br>
of the message sent.<br>
Given the design of the master-slave communication<br>
system according to the invention, the possibility<br>
exists for the master unit, with an arbitrary<br>
arrangement of the individual slave unit, but<br>
particularly if the slave units are arranged and<br>
operated in the manner according to the invention, to<br>
determine, in a simple manner, the freedom of faults in<br>
the communication system particularly also in the case<br>
of a reconfiguration of the course of the signal in the<br>
dual-ring structure after occurrence of a link fault.<br>
Furthermore, a reliable read and write operation is<br><br><br>
guaranteed in the communication system even in the<br>
redundant case, that is to say when individual users in<br>
the communication system have switched to fault mode,<br>
by superimposing the useful data field of the two<br>
messages fed back.<br><br>
