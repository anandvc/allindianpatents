				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to novel therapeutic anti-inflammatory and analgesic pharmaceutical compositions containing Nimesulide which is N- (4 nitro, 2 phenoxyphenyl methane sulphonamide) for use transdermally and a process for the manufacture thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
For a drug to be absorbed transdermally, it has to travel through various layers of the skin before reaching the site of action.<br>
The layers of the skin are different 'in nature-some are hydrophilic while some are lipophilic (Montagna W. Parrakhal PF: The structure and Function of the skin , 3rd ed. Academic press, New York, 1974) .      Accordingly, any drug which is used transdermally must possess both hydrophilic and lipophillic properties. Nimesulide which is N- (4 nitro, 2 phenoxyphenyl methane sulphonamide) compound, is a highly hydrophobic drug and consequently it is considered a poor candidate for transdertnal absorption.; When applied to the skin, it is absorbed in very minute quantities or not absorbed at all.<br>
Transdermal route for administration of anti-inflammatory agents<br>
•	,	*<br>
offers various advantages over the oral route such as lower dosage, less toxicity/side effects, no G I irritation, no dose dumping in the body and it is more site specific (Chien YW: Novel Drug Delivery System, Marcel Dekker, New York, '1982).<br>
Secondly, where the Mantell patent is restricted to a solvent range of 5 to 70 wt%, the solvent concentration of the present invention is upto 99.99% since the composition of the invention is a spreading non-finite composition.<br>
Besides, plastizer is not required in the present invention because of its non utility.<br>
As regards the presence of polysaccharide,the present invention uses it along with a non polysaccharide and the usage of a polysaccharide is at a much lower % by weight than 20% to 50% by weight as disclosed by Mantell.<br>
Besides the polysaccharide used by Mantell in large quantities is necessary for bioadhesion which is not required in our case.<br>
Also Mantell discloses water as an non-entity whereas in the present invention water is required in the composition.<br>
The use of Nimesulide through intra-muscular administration as an analgesic agent has not been successful because Nimesulide being practically insoluble in water and its formulations in conventional oily bases or as suspensions result in depot formation in the muscular tissues which defies the main objective of quick relief.<br>
The market and literature survey shows that no parenteral dosage form of Nimesulide is reported. (Drugs 48 (3) 431-454, 1994)<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a therapeutic<br>
The Literature and the market surveys show that at present, there exists no properly effective percutaneous formulations of Nimesulide.<br>
In the patent for Nimesulide drug molecule (US Patent No. 3,840,597) the use of Nimesulide as an anti-inflammatory agent in the dose range of 1 ng to 500 mg per kg. body weight in the form of cream, gel, tapes and the like has been cited. According to our studies, it was observed that the drug either precipitated out in the conventional formulation or precipitated on application to human skin when applied as a conventional gel or cream' in the above stated dosage and practically no percutaneous absorption occured. An over-riding difficulty is the inherent insolubility of the Nimesulide in aqueous media and hence the provision of a dosage form which can contain Nimesulide in sufficiently high concentration to permit convenient use and yet meet the required criteria in terms of bioavailability e.g. enabling effective absorption from the skin.<br>
U S Patent 5,446070 granted to Mantell et al. discloses a flexible, finite ,bioadhesive composition. The present invention however,is not a finite composition or bioadhesive composition. The present invention comprises a composition which is non-finite in other words capable of being applied to large body areas for action at site of inflammation for instance the synovial fluids in joints.<br>
composition containing Nimesulide in combination with other •compounds which alter the hydrophcbic property of Nimesulide, and a process for the manufacture thereof thus making it possible for the said composition to be used for direct application on the skin for the treatment of inflammation through transdermal absorption.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a novel therapeutic composition containing Nimesulide in combination witzh other compounds which alter the physico-chemical property of Nimesulide, thus making it possible for the said composition to be used for direct application on the skin for the treatment of inflammation through rransdermal absorption, at dose levels much Icwer than the dose levels according to the known art.<br>

Example 1<br>
Preparation of topical gel dosage form<br>
(Example Removed)<br>
Step (a)Dimethylacetamide is mixed with ethyl alcohol<br>
and acetone at 30°C in a container with stirring. To the mixture obtained Nimesulide is added and stirred till completely dissolved.<br>
Step (b)      Propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol 400 and<br>

Example 2<br>
Preparation of emulsion type topical dosage form. <br>
(Example Removed)<br>
Dissolve Nimesulide in a mixture of (6), (7), (8),	(9) and (10)<br>
with warming. Separately mix (2), (3), (4) and 5 and slowly add<br>
the Nimesulide mixture to it with stirring. '<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation    of     a     solution     type     dosage     form	for    topical<br>
application.<br>
(Example Removed)<br>
Nimesulide is dissolved in (2) with stirring and (3), (4),  (5), (.6) ,  (7) and (8)  are added to obtain a clear solution with stirring. Example 4. Preparation of ointment type dosage form topical application. <br>
(Example Removed)<br>
Warm (3) ,(4) and (5) and add with stirring a solution of<br>
Nimesulide in dimethyl sulphoxide.<br>
Example 5.<br>
Preparation of an aerosol dosage form for topical use. <br>
(Example Removed)<br>
The analgesic	activity of the therapeutic composition, prepared<br>
.according to	the present invention, was fcund to be dose<br>
dependent and	passed the tests of subacute tcxicity and undue<br>
toxicity.<br>
The dose levels of the novel Anti-inflammatory and Analgesic composition, according to the present invention, are comparatively much lower than the dose levels of the Conventional Nimesulide formulations for equally effective results.<br>
The various forms of the therapeutic composition prepared according to the present invention were subjected to in-vitro drug release studies using modified USP dissolution apparatus attached.with enhancer cell (Pharm Tech. Jan. 1995, 52-58). The dissolution media used was phosphate buffer pH 7.4. The results indicated that the cumulative drug release and permeation flux were proportional to the drug load.<br>
The said compositions were also subjected to standard pharmacological test methods to measure anti-inflammatory activity such as rat paw oedema and guinea pig erythema. These tests showed significant activity when compared to placebo.<br>
*<br>
The said Therapeutic compositions were also tested on sixty healthy human volunteers for irritation or other undue side effects. No incidence of irritation/side effects was reported.<br>
Since many apparently different embodiments of the present invention could be made without departing 'from the spirit and<br>
scope thereof, it is intended that the description of the invention herein be interpreted as being illustrative only and not limiting in any manner whatsoever. •<br><br><br><br>
