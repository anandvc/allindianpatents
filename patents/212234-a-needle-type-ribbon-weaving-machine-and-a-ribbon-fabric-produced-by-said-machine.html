				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to a needle-type ribbon weaving machine for producing a ribbon fabric and to a ribbon fabric of this kind.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
A needle-type ribbon weaving machine and a ribbon fabric produced by it are known from CH-A-598 382. Due to the knitting needle present on the insertion side and on the discharge side, on the one hand, the needle-type ribbon weaving machine has a complicated construction and, on the other hand, the ribbon fabric is exposed, during production, to very high loads which make it possible for the ribbon fabric to be distorted. The production of the ribbon fabric is made difficult and is possible only with a low output.<br>
PRESENTATION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to improve further a needle-type ribbon weaving machine and a ribbon fabric of the type initially mentioned.<br>
Since the knitting needles for the insertion side and	<br><br>
the discharge side are pivotable about the same axis of rotation, this results in a construction which is simple and, in particular, symmetric on both ribbon sides and which is conducive to a tie-up which is the same on both ribbon sides, thus preventing the ribbon fabric from being distorted.<br>
Since the needle-type ribbon weaving machine has a second knitting needle for interlacing on the insertion side of the weft insertion needle, a ribbon fabric can be produced which has an at least approximately identical appearance at both edges, that is to say on the insertion side of the weft insertion needle into the shed and on the discharge side of the weft insertion needle out of the shed. The technically superfluous interlacing on the insertion side of the weft thread loop into the shed gives the observer the impression that both ribbon edges of the ribbon fabric are identical. This initially leads at least to a visual improvement in the ribbon fabric. However, the interlacings at both ribbon edges of the ribbon fabric also results in a ribbon fabric construction which is identical or at least very similar on both sides, with the result that the physical properties of the ribbon fabric are improved. Thus, for example, a distortion of the ribbon fabric, in particular under load, is prevented. The resistivity of the two ribbon edges and consequently their susceptibility to wear are virtually the same. In particular, it was found that by the ribbon edges being interlaced, the adverse properties of the reversal points of monofilament weft threads are avoided. The harsh sawtooth-like ribbon edges which are formed by the reversal points of monofilament weft threads are smoothed out by the interlacing, so that the risks of material damage and/or personal injury are largely eliminated.<br><br>
The interlacing on the insertion side of the shed may be identical to or different from the interlacing on the discharge side. For the interlacing, there are numerous exemplary embodiments, such as, for example, the Muller weaving systems I to V described in KIPP, loc. cit., pages 84-94. The warp, weft and interlacing threads may consist of the most different possible designs and dimensions. Particular advantages are afforded by a ribbon fabric having a weft thread consisting of a monofilament thread and interlacing threads consisting of multifilament threads.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention are described in more detail below with reference to the drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows the waving region of a needle-type ribbon weaving machine in a top view;<br>
Figure   2   shows a detail of the needle-type ribbon weaving machine according to figure 1 in a side view;<br>
Figure 3 shows the construction of a first ribbon fabric, in which a weft thread is tied up on both sides by means of an interlacing thread, according to the Muller weaving system II;<br><br>
figure 4 shows the construction of a second ribbon fabric, in which the weft thread is tied up on both sides with itself, according to the Miiller weaving system I;<br>
figure 5 shows the construction of a third ribbon fabric, in which an interlacing thread and the weft thread are interlaced on both sides with themselves, according to the Miiller weaving system III;<br>
figure 6 shows the construction of a fourth ribbon fabric, in which interlacing threads and blocking threads are interlaced with one another on both sides, according to the Miiller weaving system V;<br>
figure 7 shows the construction of a sixth ribbon fabric, in which a second interlacing thread is introduced together with the weft thread.<br>
Ways of implementing the invention<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show the weaving region of a needle-type ribbon weaving machine in a diagrammatic illustration, only the parts essential for the invention being illustrated. A shedding device 2 contains pattern-controlled heddles 4 which open warp threads 6 according to a pattern program to form a shed 8. A weft insertion needle 12 oscillatable about an axis 10 inserts a weft thread loop 14 of a multifilament or monofilament weft thread 16 into the shed 8 on an insertion side 18. The weft insertion needle 12 and consequently the weft thread loop 14 project from the shed 8 on the discharge side 20, said weft thread loop being tied up there by means of an interlacing 22.<br><br>
In the example of figures 1 to 3, the interlacing is formed by a multifilament interlacing thread 24 which is supplied via a thread guide 25 and is drawn through the weft thread loop 14 by means of a first knitting needle 26 and interlaced with itself by means of a loop 28 consisting of the interlacing thread 24. This interlacing system is described as the Miiller weaving system II in KIPP, loc. cit., page 86. On the insertion side 18, there is a further interlacing 3 0 which is formed in a similar way to the interlacing 22 of the discharge side 20. The interlacing 30 is formed by a multifilament interlacing thread 34 which is supplied via a thread guide 32 and which is drawn by means of a second knitting needle 3 6 through a connection point 3 8 between adjacent weft thread loops 14 and is interlaced with itself.<br>
The knitting needles 26, 3 6 are arranged in each case on rockers 40, 42 which are fastened to coaxial shafts 44, 46 pivotable about an axis of rotation 47 and are driven with phase displacement. The phase displacement may be 90° to 270°. A phase displacement of 180° preferably corresponds to the position, offset at 180°, of the weft insertion needle 12 on the insertion side 18 or the discharge side 20.<br>
The needle-type ribbon weaving machine also contains a weaving reed 48 which beats up the weft thread loop 14 inserted into the shed 8 at the beating-up edge 5 0 of the ribbon fabric 52. A ribbon guide 54 which follows the beating-up edge 5 0 extends at most over the entire width of the ribbon fabric 52 to be produced. The ribbon guide 54 ensures, downstream of the beating-up edge 50, a satisfactory guidance of the ribbon fabric 52 produced. This guidance is assisted by stitch knocking-over plates 56, 58 arranged on both sides of the ribbon guide 54, that is to say assigned to the<br><br>
insertion side 18 and to the discharge side 20 respectively.<br>
Figure 4 shows a second ribbon fabric 52a, in which the weft thread 16a is introduced, as in the example of figure 3, by means of the weft insertion needle 12 into the shed formed from the warp threads 6. The weft thread 16a is looped together with itself both on the discharge side 20 and on the insertion side 18 by means of the first knitting needle 26 and the second knitting needle 3 6 respectively. The head parts 60 of the weft thread loops 14a are correspondingly interlaced with themselves during interlacing 22a on the discharge side 20. Similarly, the connection points 38a between adjacent weft thread loops 14a are interlaced with themselves by means of the second knitting needle 3 6 on the insertion side 18, as may be gathered from figure 4. This is the Miiller weaving system I in KIPP, loc. cit., page 85.<br>
Figure 5 shows a third ribbon fabric 52b, in which the weft thread loop 14b introduced into the shed by means of the weft insertion needle 12 is provided on the insertion side 18 and on the discharge side 2 0 in each case with interlacings 3 0b and 22b which are formed from the interlacing threads 34a, 24a and the weft thread 16b which are therefore interlaced with one another in parallel. This is, here, the Miiller weaving system III in KIPP, loc. cit., page 86.<br>
Figure 6 shows a fourth ribbon fabric 52c, in which, once again, a preferably monofilament weft thread 16c in the form of a weft thread loop 14c is introduced into the shed 8 by means of the weft insertion needle 12. Both on the insertion side 18 and on the discharge side 20, the interlacing 3 0c, 22c is formed in each case from a multifilament interlacing thread 34b and<br><br>
24b which in each case are guided through the connection points 3 8b of adjacent weft thread loops 14c or the head parts 60 of the weft thread loops, these interlacing threads 24b, 34b being interlaced by means of the first and the second knitting needle 26, 36, on the one hand, with themselves and, on the other hand with an additional second interlacing thread 62, 64. This is, in this case, the Miiller weaving system V in KIPP, loc. sit., page 87. Thread guides 66 and thread placers 68 serve for feeding the various interlacing threads, so that these can be picked up by the knitting needles 2 6 and 36. The thread guides 66 can be driven by heddle frames or heddle carrier rails 7 8a, 78b, 78c of the shedding device 2 or be controlled by means of a separate drive.<br>
Figure 7 shows a fifth ribbon fabric 52d, in which a weft insertion needle 12a not only introduces a weft thread loop 14d of a monofilament weft thread 16d, but is also provided with a further eye 70, in order to insert a loop 72 of a multifilament interlacing thread 34c into the shed simultaneously and in parallel with the weft thread loop 14d. This interlacing thread 34c is interlaced with itself on the insertion side 18 by means of the second knitting needle 36. For this purpose, the connection points 74 of adjacent loops 72 of the interlacing thread 34c are interlaced with one another outside the connection point 3 8c of adjacent weft thread loops 14d. This interlacing 3 0d therefore lies outside, beyond the connection points 38c of the weft thread loops 14d on the insertion side 18. On the discharge side 20, the interlacing 22d is formed by the interlacing thread 24c which is simultaneously drawn in each case through the head part 6 0 of the weft thread loop 14d and the head part 7 6 of the loop 72 of the interlacing thread 34c and is interlaced with itself.<br><br>
In the exemplary embodiments, the knitting needles are preferably latch needles, but other knitting needles, such as, in particular, compound needles may also be used.<br>
Many other design variants may also be envisaged, in particular the interlacings on the insertion side do not have to be identical to the interlacings on the discharge side, but different systems may be employed on both sides. At the same time, the weft threads may be of the multifilament type, but they are preferably of the monofilament type. By contrast, the interlacing threads are, as a rule, multifilament threads which by virtue of their flexibility can be adapted more easily to the interlacing patterns.<br><br>
