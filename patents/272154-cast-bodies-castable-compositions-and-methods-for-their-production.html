				<td>CAST BODIES, CASTABLE COMPOSITIONS, AND METHODS FOR THEIR PRODUCTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]   The present invention relates to castable compositions with reduced matrix content, such as refractory compositions for lining the inner walls of vessels and furnaces intended to receive liquid metal, glass and the like. It also relates to cast bodies produced from these compositions and methods.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]   A number of processes for producing a lining on the inner walls of a metallurgical<br>
vessel are known. Thus, for example, there is known, according to the prior art, a process in<br>
which an aqueous and pasty mixture capable of setting, containing inorganic particles, optionally<br>
fibers, and an organic and/or inorganic binder, is applied by molding, tamping or projecting with<br>
a trowel, pneumatic tube or other projecting device to the inside of a metallurgical vessel such as<br>
a casting tundish. The mixture of particles sinters in contact with the liquid metal, and this<br>
ensures the cohesion of the lining.<br>
[0003]   According to the prior art, there is also known a process according to which at least two<br>
layers of different compositions are applied to the inside of the metallurgical vessel, each being<br>
applied by projecting an aqueous and pasty mixture capable of setting of the above-mentioned<br>
type.<br>
[0004]   The fluidity of such aqueous and pasty mixtures, which expedites their application, is<br>
proportional to the amount of wetting water present. The wetting water employed for forming<br>
the aqueous mixture(s) must be removed by drying, and this involves an immobilization time and<br>
an expenditure of energy, neither of which can be ignored.<br>
[0005]   There is also known a process according to which a template is placed inside a<br>
metallurgical vessel, a material consisting of refractory particles and of a heat-curable binder is<br>
projected pneumatically between the template and the inner walls of the vessel, and heating is<br>
then applied while the template is left in place to cause the binder to set, and the template is<br>
finally removed. The cast material contains an inorganic compound containing water of<br>
crystallization. Water of crystallization is water in chemical combination with a crystal,<br>
necessary for the maintenance of crystalline properties but capable of being removed by sufficient heat.<br>
[0006]   It is also known that refractory bodies can be made by casting of refractory concretes either by vibration casting of a wet concrete or by vibration-free casting of a concrete having a self-flowing consistency. In both approaches, all concrete materials need to be homogeneously mixed and wetted. Customarily, matrix and coarse materials are batched together. Then water is added to give fluidity and to initiate a reaction that forms an end product of an ideal shape. To accomplish this, a large portion of the material is fine-grained matrix material. This material has a high surface area, which lends itself to attack in adverse conditions, such as most refractory applications. Larger proportions of water improve the fluidity of the mixture, but promote the formation of pores in the formed product. A high mixing water content in the castable means very long dry-out times and poor mechanical strength. Smaller proportions of water inhibit pore formation, but yield product pieces that are prone to cracking, crumbling and spalling. In extreme cases, formulations using small proportions of water are unable to form a coherent piece.<br>
[0007]   In order to increase thermal shock resistance, fibrous materials have been used in vibration-cast materials and in self-flowing materials. The use of fibrous materials increases the need for high levels of mixing water and makes casting more difficult. Very coarse materials which are beneficial for slag resistance due to their high density can only be used to a certain extent, because casting of concretes with a very high content of coarse materials is very difficult. [0008]   Infiltration processes are also used to produce objects containing coarse particulates intermingled with finer particulates introduced in the form of a slurry. For example, a mold may be filled with dry coarse particulates which can have a size between about 1 and 60 mm to form a formed dry body. The formed dry body is then infiltrated with a slurry consisting of a binder, water, and fine filler materials having a particle size distribution of between 0.0001 to 3 mm. Infiltration according to this method is a time-consuming process. The difficulty of production of a thick piece by this method increases with the piece's thickness, unless a larger aggregate is used.<br>
[0009]   The aim of the present invention is to overcome the disadvantages of the known compositions and to produce a product in which the amount of mixing water is minimized, the quantities of matrix material are minimized, the porosity of the formed dry body is minimized,<br>
the density of the formed dry body is increased, and a product having enhanced modulus of rupture and cold crushing strength values is produced.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010]   It has been found that certain compositional features, alone or in combination, yield castable materials that are able to be formulated with reduced amounts of water and exhibit increased density and reduced porosity when compared with the compositions of the prior art. These features include:<br>
[0011]   1) The coarsest refractory grain fraction makes up 50% by weight or greater of the dry composition; this fraction is separated from a smaller grain fraction by a gap having a ratio of smallest particle diameter to largest particle diameter such at least the square root of 2, or at least 2. For example, the coarsest refractory grain fraction may be composed of particles having diameters greater than 500, 800 or 1000 micrometers, and may be a closed fraction having maximum particle size, such as 1000, 2000 or 4000 micrometers.<br>
[0012]   2) The composition contains at least four grain fractions, of which three adjacent grain fractions, separated by gaps having a particle diameter ratio of at least the square root of two, or by gaps having a particle diameter ratio of at least two, have remaining weight percentages (percentage by weight of particle in the fraction with respect to the weight of all particles in the fraction plus all smaller particles) that are, with respect to the respective immediately larger particle size fractions and in order of decreasing particle size, smaller, larger and smaller in value. This configuration (larger, smaller, larger, smaller fractions) is designated as an "alternating remaining weight percentage" composition.<br>
[0013]   3) The composition contains at least four grain fractions, of which three adjacent grain fractions, separated by gaps having a particle diameter ratio of at least the square root of two, or by gaps having a particle diameter ratio of at least two, have remaining weight percentages (percentage by weight of particle in the fraction with respect to the weight of all particles in the fraction plus all smaller particles) that are, with respect to the respective immediately larger particle size fractions and in order of decreasing particle size, larger, smaller and larger in value. This configuration (smaller, larger, smaller, larger fractions) is also designated as an "alternating remaining weight percentage" composition.<br>
 [0014]   4) The composition contains at least two, or at least three, grain fractions, separated by<br>
gaps having a particle diameter ratio of at least the square root of two, or a particle diameter ratio<br>
of at least two, entirely composed of particles with diameters less than 100 micrometers.<br>
[0015]   5) The composition contains at least four grain fractions, separated by gaps having a<br>
particle ratio diameter of at least the square root of two, or a particle diameter ratio of at least<br>
two, in which the remaining weight percentages are at least 40%.<br>
[0016]   6) The composition contains at least five grain fractions separated by gaps having a<br>
particle ratio diameter of at least the square root of two, or a particle diameter ratio of at least<br>
two.<br>
[0017]   7) At least two of the gaps each contain less than 10 percent by mass, or less than 5<br>
percent by mass, of the mass of the dry composition.<br>
[0018]   Compositions incorporating or more of these characteristics have been produced in<br>
which, with weight percentages of water of 6.0 wt%, 5.0 wt%, 4.0 wt%, 3.0 wt%, 2.5 wt% and<br>
2.0 wt%, increased MOR (modulus of rupture), increased bulk density, decreased porosity and<br>
increased CCS (cold crushing strength) values are obtained with respect to the prior art.<br>
[0019]   With compositions of the present invention, MOR values (measured in pounds per<br>
square inch) of 1000 or greater, 2000 or greater, 3000 or greater, or 3500 or greater as measured<br>
at 230 degrees F, and 500 or greater, 1000 or greater, 2000 or greater, 3000 or greater, or 3500 or<br>
greater as measured at 1500 degrees F, can be obtained.<br>
[0020]   With compositions of the present invention, bulk density values (measured in pounds<br>
per cubic foot) of 190 or greater, 195 or greater, or 200 or greater as measured at 230 degrees F,<br>
and 185 or greater, 190 or greater, 195 or greater, or 200 or greater as measured at 1500 degrees<br>
F, can be obtained for formulations composed of 95 wt% alumina or greater.<br>
[0021]   With compositions of the present invention, porosities (measured as volume percent) of<br>
15 or less, 10 or less, 5 or less, 4 or less, or 3 or less as measured at 230 degrees F, and 18 or<br>
less, 15 or less, 10 or less, 5 or less, 4 or less, or 3 or less as measured at 1500 degrees F, can be<br>
obtained.<br>
[0022]   With compositions of the present invention, CCS values (measured in pounds per<br>
square inch) of 3000 or greater, 5000 or greater, 8000 or greater, 10,000 or greater, and 12,000 or<br>
greater as measured at 230 degrees F, and 3000 or greater, 5000 or greater, 8000 or greater,<br>
10,000 or greater, and 12,000 or greater as measured at 1500 degrees F, can be obtained.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF TFIE INVENTION<br>
[0030]   It has been found that the presence or combination of certain compositional features produces a refractory product in which the amount of mixing water is minimized, the quantities of matrix material are minimized, the porosity of the formed dry body is minimized, the density of the formed dry body is increased, and a product having enhanced modulus of rupture and cold crushing strength values is produced.<br>
[0031]   The coarse aggregates useful in practicing the present invention may contain fused alumina or sintered alumina (tabular alumina), whole alumina balls, fused bauxite, fused and sintered mullite, fused and sintered magnesia, fused and sintered magnesia aluminum spinel, fused and sintered zirconia, refractory bauxites, refractory kyanite, refractory andalusite, refractory sillmanite, silicon carbide or combinations thereof.<br>
[0032]   The coarse aggregates useful in practicing the present invention can have any shape. They can be spherical, blocky, rectangular or even fibrous. In addition, they may be used alone or in combination.<br>
[0033]   The binder used in the matrix may contain calcium aluminate cement, alpha bond cement, Portland cement, mono-aluminum phosphate (MAP), clays, reactive alumina (such as AA 101), hydratable alumina, and combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, the matrix material according to the present invention does not contain cement. [0034]   Other raw materials used in the matrix may include reactive aluminas, calcined alumina, tabular alumina, fused alumina, mullite, carbon (graphite or carbon black), silicon carbide, zirconium dioxide, magnesium oxide, aluminum silicates (such as kyanite, andalusite, or sillmanite), micro silica, bauxite, chromium oxide and combinations thereof. The portion of the formulation having diameters in the range of 0.01 to 10 micrometers, also known as the fines, may contain reactive aluminas and fume silicas.<br>
[0035]   The matrix may also contain dispersing agents, plasticizers, anti-foaming or foaming agents and de-airing components. These agents are well known in the art. [0036]   The method of the invention produces castable mixtures with a minimal volume of fine grains. Generally, the amount of fine grains needed to create a castable is dependent on the size of the top size grain. Mixes with a top grain size of 3 mesh typically need a minimum of 33 volume percent -100 mesh grains to form a functional castable mixture. Useful castable mixtures with 30 volume percent or less -100 mesh grains, 29 volume percent or less -100 mesh grains, 26 volume percent or less -100 mesh grains, 25 volume percent or less -100 mesh grains, 22 volume percent or less -100 mesh grains or from, and including, 24 volume percent to, and including, 18 volume percent -100 mesh grains, can be produced according to the present invention.<br>
[0037]   Castable mixtures with a 3 mesh top grain size typically require a minimum of 48 volume percent -16 mesh grains to form a functional castable mixture. Useful castable mixtures with 47 volume percent or less -16 mesh grains, 45 volume percent or less -16 mesh grains, or 43 volume percent or less -16 mesh grains, can be produced according to the present invention. [0038]   Castable mixtures with a 3 mesh top grain size typically need a minimum of 58 volume percent -6 mesh grains to form a functional castable mixture. Useful castable mixtures with 55 volume percent or less -6 mesh grains, 47 volume percent or less -6 mesh grains, 42 volume percent or less -6 mesh grains, or 36 volume percent or less -6 mesh grains can be produced according to the present invention. Regardless of the top grain size, a minimum volume of fine aggregate is needed for prior art castable mixtures. These minimum volumes are similar to the<br>
values given for mixes with a top grain size of 3 mesh. Mesh values are expressed here as Tyler values.<br>
[0039]   Additionally, the maximum volume percent values for -6 mesh grains, -14 mesh grains, -16 mesh grains, -28 mesh and -100 mesh grains presented for castable mixtures with a top grain size of 3 mesh may also be used to produce castable mixtures according to the invention having a top grain size or aggregate larger than 3 mesh. For example, -3/8" aggregates, ½"' x ¼" aggregates, -½" aggregates, -3/4" aggregates and -1" aggregates, mixtures of these aggregates and aggregates having a top grain size within the range of, and including, -3 mesh and 12" may be used to produce castable compositions according to this invention. [0040]   The method of the invention produces cast bodies with densities previously unattainable for the compositions used. Alumina-based cast objects of the prior art may have densities up to 202 pounds per cubic foot in the green state if they incorporate chromium oxide. Green state materials contain free water; this water is removed by heating to 230°F. Alumina-based cast objects with densities, in the green state, of 204 pounds per cubic foot or greater, or 210 pounds per cubic foot or greater, can be produced according to the present invention. [0041]   Alumina-based cast objects of the prior art may have densities up to 199 pounds per cubic foot after drying to 230°F if they incorporate chromium oxide, or 196 pounds per cubic foot in the green state if they incorporate only aluminas. Alumina-based cast objects with densities, after drying to 230°F, of 200 pounds per cubic foot or greater, 202 pounds per cubic foot or greater, or 207 pounds per cubic foot or greater, can be produced according to the present invention.<br>
[0042]   The method of the present invention produces cast bodies with densities, with respect to theoretic densities, previously unattainable. The theoretic density refers to the highest density attainable for a substance (i.e., a solid sample containing no gaps, as distinguished from a packed powder having gaps between particles). Alumina has a theoretic density of 247.53 pounds per cubic foot. The prior art can produce materials with (196.0/247.53) x 100% or 79.2% of theoretic density, or (199.0/247.53) x 100% or 80.3% of theoretic density. Materials produced according to the present invention may have (200.0/247.53) x 100%) or 80.7% of theoretic density or greater, or densities that equal or exceed 83.6% of theoretic density. [0043]   The method of the invention enables the production of castable material with a reduced quantity of liquid. Prior art castable materials typically contain at least 3.7 wt% liquid. Castable<br>
material can be produced according to the present invention with 3.3 wt% liquid or less, 3.0 wt% liquid or less, 2.0 wt% liquid, or 1.7 wt% liquid or less. Prior art castable materials typically contain at least 10.9 vol% liquid. Castable material can be produced according to the present invention with 9.1 vol% liquid or less, or 7.8 vol% liquid or less. These percentages are expressed with respect to a total weight or volume of aggregate, matrix, fines and water. [0044]   The method of the invention enables the production of cast bodies with reduced porosity. Cast bodies produced by prior art casting techniques have, after heating to 1500°F, porosity levels of no less than 13%. Cast bodies can be produced according to the present invention with porosity levels less than 13%, less than 12%, less than 11%, less than 10%, less than 9%, less than 8%, less than 7%, less than 6%, less than 5%, less than 4%, or less than 3%. [0045]   In a process according to the invention, cast shapes, cast structures and cast products, such as columnar structures, may be constructed with the castable compositions of the invention. The method comprises steps of (a) providing a mold having a cavity which corresponds to the size and shape of the structure or cast product, (b) filling the cavity with a castable composition of the invention, (c) optionally subjecting the castable composition of the invention to compacting and/or vibration, (d) curing the castable composition to form the cast shape, cast structure or cast product, and (e) separating the mold from the cast shape, cast structure or cast product. The compositions of the present invention may also be used in a compression forming procedure, in which the wet composition is placed in a mold and subjected to mechanical or hydraulic pressing or other compression processes to form a piece or cast product of the desired shape.<br>
[0046]   The castable compositions of the invention may be heated to obtain good green strengths for demolding. Heating to 110°C may be used to react the reactive alumina. Alternatively, or in addition, a cement may be used in the fine-grained material to provide green strength.<br>
[0047]   The examples presented in Table I were cast using tabular alumina sized as indicated and Secar 71 cement as a binder. Secar 71 is a hydraulic binder with an alumina content of approximately 70%. ULM2 is a composition of the present invention having four peaks in particle diameter distribution; two of the peaks correspond to particles having diameters of 250 micrometers or less. ULM3 and ULM3B are two compositions of the present invention having three particle diameter distribution peaks corresponding to particles having diameters of 1000<br>
micrometers or less. PA1 and PA2 are prior art compositions. ULM1 is a composition of the<br>
present invention that was derived from composition PA2 by alteration of the particle<br>
distribution of the sub-100-micrometer (or -60 mesh) range, and by introduction of gaps in that<br>
range.<br>
[0048]   The "loading" values in Tables I and II represent remaining weight percentages,<br>
defined as the percentage by weight of particles in a given fraction with respect to the weight of<br>
all particles in the fraction plus all smaller particles. For example, the fraction containing the<br>
largest particles in ULM2 contains 53 wt% of the alumina and silica in the composition. The<br>
fraction containing the second-largest particles contains 50 wt% of the remaining particles. The<br>
fraction containing the third-largest particles contains 35 wt% of the remaining particles. The<br>
fraction containing the fourth-largest particles, which are also the smallest particles, contains 100<br>
wt% of the remaining particles.<br>
[0049]   The compositions ULM 1, ULM 3 and ULM3B contain four or more fractions having<br>
an alternating remaining weight configuration. PA1 and PA2 lack such a configuration. ULM2<br>
also lacks a four-fraction alternating remaining weight configuration, but does have two peaks<br>
corresponding to particles having diameters of 250 micrometers or less.<br>
[0050]   The compositions PA1 and PA2 required the quantities of water shown (6.34 wt% and<br>
5.25 wt% respectively) to produce a cast product.<br>
[0051]   A3000FL is a superground, bimodal reactive alumina with a d50 of approximately 2.5-<br>
3 micrometers and a specific surface area measured by the BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller)<br>
method of typically 1.3-2 square meters per gram. A152SG is a superground alumina having a<br>
monomodal particle size distribution with a median particle size of 1.2 micrometers. RG 4000 is<br>
a monomodal reactive alumina with a d50 of 0.5-0.8 micrometers. Dispex N100 is a sodium<br>
polyacrylate dispersant.<br>
[0052]   Present invention ultra-low matrix compositions ULM1, ULM2, ULM3 and ULM3B<br>
show increases in MOR, bulk density, and CR, and decreased porosity when compared with<br>
prior art compositions PA1 and PA2. The components and properties of these compositions are<br>
presented in Table I.<br>

 [0054]   All samples were subjected to 30 seconds of dry mixing, 4.5 minutes of wet mixing, 4 minutes of high vibration and 1 minute of low vibration. KBD values are bulk densities measured in pounds per cubic foot. KPOR values are porosity values measured as volume percent. Both the KBD values and KPOR values are 1500 degree F values. The designation DNB is given to compositions that did not bond. The designation DNC is given to compositions that did not consolidate.<br>
