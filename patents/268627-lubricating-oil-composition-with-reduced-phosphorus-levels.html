'LUBRICATING OIL COMPOSITION WITH REDUCED PHOSPHORUS LEVELS<br>
REFERENCE   OF RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] This application claims priority to United States Provisional Patent Application No. 60/665.961 filed March 29, 2005, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The  invention   generally  relates  to  a low phosphorus  lubricant  for an  internal combustion engine that provides  superior deposit control while still retaining excellent<br>
viscosity control.<br>
BACKGROUND [0003] Future engine oil lubricants will be required to have low levels of phosphorus to protect the emission system, but will also need to provide broad oxidation protection to the lubricant and reduced wear and deposits in the engine. This is a difficult task with existing lubricants because the most effective anti-wear and antioxidant additives are the phosphorus-containing zinc dialkyldithiophosphates (ZDDPs). In the past, high levels of ZDDP were used because ZDDPs were low cost materials and provided superior anti-wear and oxidation performance. However, in the future, ZDDP will only be allowed at low levels. In 2004, some commercial gasoline engine oil specifications allowed a maximum of 800 ppm phosphorus from ZDDP. In future engine oil specifications, levels of phosphorus may drop below 500 ppm, and possibly lower. It is well known that ashless antioxidants can replace some of the oxidation performance lost when levels of ZDDP are reduced. However, it is also known that higher levels of ashless antioxidants do not always lead to improved oxidation control. In fact, modern engine oils generally require the use of two or more ashless antioxidant types in order to compensate for the oxidative stability lost by using less ZDDP. In addition, specifications for deposit control are becoming more demanding. In many cases, modern and future lubricants will require much higher levels of these various ashless antioxidants. Levels of conventional ashless antioxidants in excess of 2.0 wt. % may not be adequate for proper protection of the lubricant and engine. These high levels of conventional ashless antioxidants become costly and may also lead to lubricant deficiencies such as<br><br>
corrosion, rust, and seal incompatibility. New low cost and low ash antioxidant systems are needed that are effective at controlling lubricant oxidation and minimizing engine deposits.<br>
f0004] It has been found in this invention that particular combinations and ratios of 4,4,-methylenebis(2,6-di-tert-butylphenol) and alkylated diphenylamines provide unexpectedly superior levels of oxidation and deposit control in low phosphorus engine oils. This allows for the use of significantly lower treat levels of ashless antioxidants. The antioxidant systems of this invention are also effective at significantly reducing the formation of volatile organic molecules that are produced upon heating and oxidation of the lubricant. This effect has significant benefits for the environment, since a reduction in volatile organic molecules should contribute to a reduction in emissions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0005] One aspect of the present invention is directed toward a novel lubricating oil composition for an internal combustion engine that provides superior deposit control while still retaining excellent viscosity control. Another aspect of the present invention is directed to the use of the novel lubricating oil composition to reduce the amount of deposits in an internal combustion engine. Yet another aspect of the present invention is directed to the use of the novel lubricating oil composition to reduce the poisoning of the catalyst in an internal combustion engine system.<br>

[0018] The test is also a useful tool for studying the formation of volatile organic molecules upon oxidation of an engine oil. It is generally understood that the formation of volatile organic molecules upon oxidation of a lubricant are detrimental because they lead to an increase in emissions, and can also promote further polymerization of the lubricant. Polymerization of the lubricant leads to viscosity increase, which is also undesirable. The additive combination of this invention is effective at controlling both deposit formation and the formation of volatile organic molecules. Typically, polar volatile organic molecules are formed by decomposition of an organic peroxide in the lubricant. This decomposition produces an organic alkoxy radical that can react with another oil molecule to produce an alcohol, or that can degrade to form aldehydes and ketones. The degradation to aldehydes and ketones generally reduces molecular weight and thus produces more volatile fragments, which are pollutants and are also active precursors to oligomers and polymers that thicken the lubricant. It is therefore highly desirable to prevent or eliminate the formation of these polar volatile organic molecules.<br>

[0040] Dispersants are well known in the field of lubricants and include primarily what are sometimes referred to as "ashless" dispersants because (prior to mixing in a lubricating composition) they do not contain ash-forming metals and they do not normally contribute any ash-forming metals when added to a lubricant.<br>
[0041] Dispersants typically are nonmetallic additives containing nitrogen or oxygen polar groups attached to a high molecular weight hydrocarbon chain. The hydrocarbon chain provides solubility in the hydrocarbon base stocks. The dispersants function to keep oil degradation products suspended in the oil. Examples of suitable dispersants include but are not limited to polymethacrylates, styrene-maleic ester copolymers, substituted succinimides fe.g.,PIBSA (polyisobutylene succinic anhydride)), polyamine succinimides, polyhydroxy succinic esters, substituted Marmich bases, and substituted triazoles.<br>
[0042] The dispersants may be borated. Borated dispersants are well-known materials and can be prepared by treatment with aborating agent such as boric acid. Typical conditions include heating the dispersant with boric acid at about 100 to 150°C. The dispersants may also be treated by reaction with maleic anhydride; for example, a succinimide dispersant can be prepared by the reaction of an amount of an cc,|3-unsaturated acid or equivalent thereof, such as maleic anhydride, with an amount of an amine with a hydrocarbyl-substituted<br><br>
,acy latin g agent characterized by the presence of at least 1.3 succinic groups for each equivalent weight of substituent group, wherein the reaction of the acid can be simultaneous with or subsequent to the reaction of the amine and the hydrocarbyl-substituted acylating agent, as described in WO 00/26327, filed Oct. 13, 1999, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for any purpose.<br>
[0043] In one embodiment of the invention, the amount of dispersant in the composition of this invention range from about 0.5 wt. % to about 10 wt. % based on the total composition weight. In another embodiment of the invention, the amount of dispersant in the compositions of the invention range from about 1.0 wt. % to about 12.0 wt. %; in yet Another embodiment the amount ranges from about 1.0 wt. % to about 8.0 wt. %. In another embodiment of the invention, the amount of dispersant in the composition of this invention range from about 3.0 wt. % to about 7.0 wt. %. Its concentration in a concentrate will be correspondingly increased to, e.g., from about 5 wt. % to about 90 wt. %.<br>
[0044] Detergents are generally salts of organic acids, which are often overbased. Metal overbased salts of organic acids are widely known to those of skill in the art and generally include metal salts wherein the amount of metal present exceeds the stoichiometric amount. Detergents are typically metallic additives containing metal ions and polar groups, such as sulfonates or carboxylates, with aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or alkylaromatic chains. The detergents function by lifting deposits from the various surfaces of the engine.  Suitable detergents include neutral and overbased alkali and alkaline earth metal sulfonates, neutral and overbased alkali and alkaline earth metal phenates, sulfurized phenates, and overbased alkaline earth salicylates. Patents describing techniques for making detergents generally include U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,501,731; 2,616,905; 2,616,911; 2,616,925; 2,777,874; 3,256,186; 3,384,585; 3,365,396; 3,320,162; 3,318,809; 3,488,284; and 3,629,109, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference for any purpose.<br>
[0045] The detergents generally can be boratcd by treatment with a borating agent such as boric acid. Typical conditions include heating the detergent with boric acid at about 100 to 150°C, the number of equivalents of boric acid being roughly equal to the number of equivalents of metal in the salt. U.S. Patent No. 3,929,650 discloses borated complexes prepared by contacting boric acid with an alkali metal carbonate overbased metal sulfonate (prepared by overbasing a neutral alkali or alkaline earth metal sulfonate with an alkali metal<br><br>
' carbonate) in an oleophilic liquid reaction medium and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for any purpose.<br>
[0046] Jn one embodiment of the invention, the amount of detergent in a composition of this invention ranges from about 0.5 wt. % to about 5 wt. % based on the total weight of the composition.   In another embodiment of the invention, the amount of detergent in a composition of the invention ranges from about 1.0 wt % to about 6.0 wt. %; in yet another embodiment the amount ranges from about 1.0 wt.% to about 4.0 wt %. In another embodiment of the invention, the amount of detergent in a composition of this invention ranges from about 1.0 wt. % to about 3.0 wt. %. Its concentration in a concentrate will be correspondingly increased, to, e.g., about 5 wt. % to about 70 wt. %.<br>
Component (E) [0047] The zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP) (component E) in the oil composition may be any ZDDP derived from the reaction of an alcohol or phenol and phosphorus pentasulfide (P2S5) to produce adialkyldithiophosphoric acid derivative (DDPA) followed by neutralization with a basic zinc compound.<br>
wherein R8 and R9 are independently hydrocarbyl groups containing 3 to 30 carbon atoms are readily obtainable by the reaction Ofl^Ss) and an alcohol or phenol to form an 0,0-dihydrocarbyl phosphorodithioic acid of the formula:<br><br>
The reaction involves mixing at a temperature of 20°C to 200°C, four moles of an alcohol or a phenol with one mole of phosphorus pentasulfide. Hydrogen sulfide is liberated in this reaction. The acid is then reacted with a basic zinc compound to form the salt. In one embodiment of the invention, the basic zinc compound is zinc oxide (ZnO) and the resulting zinc compound is represented by the formula:<br><br><br>
R	0<br>
The R  and R  groups are independently hydrocarbyl groups that are, in one embodiment of the invention, free from acetylenic unsaturation. In another embodiment, R8 and R9 are free from ethylenic unsaturation and in yet another embodiment, R8 and R9 are free from both acetylenic and ethylenic unsaturation. In one embodiment, R8 and R9 are alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl or alkary] groups and have 3 to 20 carbon atoms; in another embodiment they have 3 to 16 carbon atoms and in yet another embodiment up to 13 carbon atoms, e.g., 3 to 13 carbon atoms. The alcohols which react to provide the R8 and R9 groups can be one or more primary alcohols, one or more secondary alcohols, or a mixture of secondary alcohol and primary alcohol. A mixture of two secondary alcohols such as isopropanol and 4-methyl-2-pcntanol also can be used.<br>
[0048] Such materials are often referred to as zinc dialkyldithiophosphates or simply zinc dithiophosphatcs. They are well known and readily available to those skilled in the art of<br>
lubricant formulation.<br>
[0049] In one embodiment of the invention, the level of ZDDP delivers less than about 600 ppm of phosphorus to the compositions of this invention; in one embodiment between about 200 and about 600 ppm of phosphorus is delivered; in yet another embodiment, between about 300 and about 600 ppm is delivered. The "ppm" is based on the total weight of the composition.   In another embodiment, the level of ZDDP delivers less than about 550 ppm of phosphorus to the compositions of this invention. For example, a ZDDP containing 8.5 wt. % phosphorus would be used at a level less than 0.65 wl. % in the compositions of this invention.  In yet another embodiment, the level of ZDDP delivers less than about 500 ppm of phosphorus to the compositions of this invention.<br>
Component (F) [0050] Any oil soluble organomolybdenum compound (component F) may be used as an optional component in the lubricating compositions of the present invention. The quantity of molybdenum delivered to the compositions of this invention will vary depending upon the customers' requirements and applications, and the desired level of antioxidant protection required for the specific composition of this invention. Any concentration of oil soluble<br><br>
' organomolybdcnum may be used, but in one embodiment, tne level is less man aooui 600 ppm. In another embodiment, the level is less than about 500 ppm. In yet another embodiment, the level is about 50 - 400 ppm. In another embodiment, the molybdenum level is about 100 - 250 ppm. In yet another embodiment, the level of molybdenum metal is about 250 - 400 ppm. The "ppm" is based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
[0051] In general, molybdenum is an effective antioxidant in lubricating oil compositions; however, the use of molybdenum in the compositions of this invention need to be balanced against the cost of oil soluble organomolybdenum compounds compared to other antioxidants, such as ZDDP.<br>
[0052] Examples of some oil soluble organomolybdenum compounds that may be used in this invention include molybdenum dithiocarbamates, oxymolybdenum sulfide dithiocarbamates, molybdenum dithioxanthogenates, oxymolybdenum sulfide dithioxanthogenates, molybdenum organophosphorodithioates, oxymolybdenum sulfide organophosphorodithioates, molybdenum carboxylates, molybdenum amine complexes, molybdenum alcohol complexes, molybdenum amide complexes, mixed molybdenum amine/alcohol/amide complexes, and combinations of these.

[0072] A further aspect of this invention is a method of reducing the amount of total volatile organics (both polar and non-polar in nature) produced by an internal combustion engine upon heating and oxidation of an engine oil, comprising lubricating the engine with any composition or engine oil described herein.<br>
[0073] Yet another aspect of this invention is a method of reducing the amount of deposits in an internal combustion engine comprising lubricating the engine with any composition or engine oil described herein.<br>
[0074] A further aspect of this invention is a method of reducing the poisoning of the catalyst in an internal combustion engine emission system, comprising lubricating the engine with any composition or engine oil described herein.<br><br><br>
[0076] The TEOST MHT instrument should be run according to the ASTM D7097 method and manufacturer specifications. The test involves passing a thin film of test engine oil over a heated wire-wound depositor rod with the aide of a precision pump.  The test rod is heated at 285°C and the test run for 24 hours. The thin film of oil moves evenly down the rod and is collected at the flow out point of the test assembly apparatus. Recovered oil is circulated back to the depositor rod via the precision pump. During the 24 hour test period volatiles are produced that flash off the hot rod surface and condense on the glass mantle of the test assembly apparatus.  These volatiles are recovered at the volatiles out port of the test assembly and are collected in a glass vial. At the end of the test, deposits are determined by the increase in depositor rod weight and reported in milligrams (mg). The collected volatiles are accurately weighed and reported in grams (g).<br>
[0077] The method requires a number of independent calibrations, including for example, calibrating the air flow rate, the oil pump rate, the temperature controller settings, and the control thermocouple.   The method also requires running certified reference oils periodically to determine the severity of the test. For example, a certified medium deposit reference oil should produce approximately 40-60 mg of deposits, while a certified high deposit reference oil should produce approximately 70-90 mg of deposits. It is understood that a severe test condition will usually produce heavier deposits and higher levels of volatiles. On the other hand, a mild test condition will usually produce lighter deposits and much lower levels of volatiles.  Engine oils that perform well, i.e. low deposits and low volatiles, under a severe<br><br>
test condition are expected to perform even better under a mild test condition.   However, engine oils that perform well under a mild test condition are expected to perform worse under a severe test condition.  The additive combination of this invention gives excellent deposit control and reduced volatiles formation under both severe and mild conditions. The robust performance of the new additive combination under both severe and mild test conditions is another advantage of this invention.<br>

Measurement of Deposits and Volatiles in TEOST-MHT<br>
[0078] The fully formulated oil (8.4 g) and an organometallic catalyst (about 0.1 g) are added to a flask equipped with a Teflon stirring bar and stirred for 20-60 minutes without heating.

The pump is started at a high flow rate and run until the lest oil reaches the connection of the pump and oil feed tube, at which point the pump flow is turned to zero. The heater switch is turned on and when the depositor rod temperature controller is between 200-2 10°C, the pump speed increased to achieve a sample delivery of 0.25+0.02g/min, making sure that the oil is flowing down the depositor rod and is not leaking. The temperature is allowed to stabilize at 285+2°C and the test is run under these conditions for 24 hrs.<br>
[0079] Three test tubes are prepared with cyclohexane or another suitable hydrocarbon solvent for extraction of oil from the depositor rod. The test instrument is disassembled as per manufacturer's instructions and the depositor rod is transferred to a weighing boat and kept under cover. The depositor rod is placed successively for 10 minutes each in each of the three test tubes prepared with a hydrocarbon solvent. The rod is placed in tared weighing boat and allowed to sit for 10 minutes to insure evaporation of the hydrocarbon solvent. The rod and the boat are weighed, verifying that a constant mass has been achieved. The contents of the three test tubes, along with the lower-end cap deposits and glass mantle deposits, are washed into a common container which is then filtered using a glass funnel equipped with a filter cartridge. After completing the filtering, the filter cartridge is dried under vacuum and weighed, until a constant mass is achieved. The total mass of the deposits from the depositor rod and filter deposits is then determined.<br><br>
[0080] During the 24 hour duration of the test, the volatile compounds in the formulated oil that are there originally or those formed during the test, are flashed off the depositor rod. These volatiles condense on the glass mantle and are collected on a continuous basis in a small, weighed vial. The vial and volatiles are measured at the end of the 24 hour test period and the amount of volatiles is calculated by subtracting the original weight of the vial.<br>
Example A<br>
(0081J A preblend was prepared by blending the following materials: 150N Group II Baseoil, 92.1 wt. %; an ashless dispersant concentrate, 4.92 wt. %;<br>
an overbased detergent concentrate containing calcium, 1.85 wt. %; a neutral detergent concentrate containing calcium, 0.51 wt. %;and a secondary zinc dialkyldithiophosphate, 0.62 wt.<br>
[0082] To this preblend was added the following components as indicated in Tabic 2 in preparation of a variety of engine oils. The finished engine oil contained the. following (calculated): calcium 2400 ppm; phosphorus 470 ppm; zinc 520 ppm; and had a total base number of 7.5 mg KOH/g of oil.<br>
[0083] The finished oils were tested in the TEOST MHT according to ASTM D7097. The certified medium deposit reference oil produced 60.6 mg of deposits in a calibration experiment.   The certified high deposit reference oil produced 96.8 mg of deposits in a calibration experiment; these results represent a severe condition for the TEOST MHT instrument.  The results of the analysis under severe conditions ate reported in Table 2.<br><br><br>
[0084| Table 2 clearly shows that the combination of MBDTBP, NDPA and MoDTC in the invention leads to low levels of deposits (12 and 10 mg) and volatiles (2.2 and 1.9 g) in the TEOST MHT using ASTM D7097. It is also clear that the combination of MBDTBP and NDPA without MoDTC in the invention leads to low levels of deposits (14 mg) and volatiles (2.3 g) in the TEOST MHT using ASTM D7097.<br>
A graph of the deposit results in the presence of MoDTC is shown in Figure i.<br>
A graph of the deposit results in the absence of MoDTC is shown in Figure 2.<br>
Example B - Oil thickening and Oxidation at Elevated Temperatures A preblend was prepared by blending the following materials:<br>
4.92 wt. % of an ashless dispersant concentrate;<br>
1.85 wt. % of an overbased detergent concentrate containing calcium;<br>
0.5 1 wt. % of a neutral detergent concentrate containing calcium;<br><br>
0.62 wt. % of a secondary zinc dialkyldithiophosphate; and 92.10 wt. % of a 150N Group II baseoil. To this engine oil preblend was added the components indicated in Table 3.<br><br>
|0085] These finished engine oils contained the following elements and physical properties (calculated): For examples B.I, B.3, B.4, B.5, andB.6: calcium 2400 ppm; phosphorus 470 ppm; zinc 520 ppm; and a total base number (TBN) of 8.6 mg KOH/g of oil. For example B.2: calcium 2400 ppm; phosphorus 690 ppm; zinc 765 ppm; and a total base number of 8.6 mg KOH/g of oil.<br>
[0086] The oxidative stability of these finished engine oils was evaluated in a bulk oil oxidation test. Each oil (300 mL) was treated with an iron naphthenate oxidation catalyst to deliver 110 ppm of iron to the finished oil. The oils were heated in a block heater at 160°C, while 10 liters/hour of dry oxygen was bubbled through the oil. Samples of the oxidized oils were removed at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours. Kinematic viscosities of each sample were determined at 40°C. The percent viscosity increase of the oxidized oil versus the fresh oil was calculated. The percent viscosity increase results are shown in Table 4.<br><br><br>
f<br>
[0087] A higher percent viscosity increase is a measure of increased oxidation and degradation of the lubricant. The designation TVTM is an indication of severe degradation of the lubricant. These results clearly show that the inventive antioxidant combination in Example B.6 provides superior oxidation protection compared to the other Examples (B. 1-B.5). Antioxidant systems that do not contain the organomolybdenum component (B.I, B.2 and B.4) show poor oxidation control, while the system containing the hindered phenolic MBDTBP (B.6) is superior to the system containing the hindered phenolic HPE (B.3).<br>
Example C - Oil Thickening and Oxidation |0088| Oils A.2, A.3, A.7, A.9, A.ll,   A.13, A.15, A.16, andA.17 (Table 2) were evaluated in the bulk oil oxidation test described in Example B. In this study the oils were heated in a heating block at 150°C, while 10 liters/hour of dry oxygen was bubbled through the oil. Samples of the oxidized oils were removed at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours. Kinematic viscosities of each sample were determined at 40°C. The percent viscosity increase of the oxidized oil versus the fresh oil was calculated. The percent viscosity increase results are shown in Table 5.<br><br>
[0089) These results show that Oil A.I 1 is comparable to Oils A.2 and A.9, and significantly better than Oils A.3 and A.7. However, Oil A.I 1 also shows a significant improvement in deposit control and volatiles relative to all the oils, as was demonstrated in Example A. Therefore, the Inventive Oil A.l 1 is an overall better performing engine oil, providing excellent viscosity control, deposit control, and control of volatile organic compounds. The ability of the inventive Oil A.I 1 to show benefits in all these parameters is of value. Antioxidant systems that contain the organomolybdcnum compound (A.13, A.15, A.16 and A. 17) show superior viscosity control.<br><br>
