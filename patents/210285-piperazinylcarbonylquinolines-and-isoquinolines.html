Piperazinylcarbonylquinolines and -isoquinolines<br><br>
in which<br>
R1	| is a phenyl or naphthyl radical which is unsubstituted or<br>
substituted by R3 and/or R4, or is Het1,<br>
R2	is a quinolinyl or isoquinolinyl radical which is unsubstituted or<br>
substituted by R5 and/or R6, R3 and R4 are each, independently of one another, H, Hal, A, OA, OH or<br>
CN, R5 and R6 are each, independently of one another, H, CN, acyl, Hal, A, OA,<br>
OH, CONH2, CONHA or CONA2,<br>
Het1	is a monocyclic or bicyclic, unsaturated heterocyclic ring system<br>
which is unsubstituted or monosubstituted or disubstituted by<br>
Hal, A, OA or OH and which contains one, two or three identical<br>
or different heteroatoms, such as nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur,<br>
A	is alkyl having 1-6 carbon atoms,<br>
alk	is alkylene having 1-6 carbon atoms,<br>
Hal	is F, CI, Br or l,<br>
and physiologically acceptable salts and solvates thereof.<br>
The invention had the object of finding novel compounds having valuable properties, in particular those which can be used for the preparation of medicaments.<br><br>
-2-<br>
It has been found that the compounds of the formula I and their physiologically acceptable salts and solvates are well tolerated and have valuable pharmacological properties since they have actions on the central nervous system. Surprisingly, the compounds have selective affinity to 5-HT2A receptors. In particular, they are selective 5-HT2A antagonists.<br>
The substances specified in this application are selective 5-HT2A antagonists. 5-HT2A antagonists exhibit clinically antipsychotic activity with no or with minimal side effects. Accordingly, the substances of this application are to be regarded as antipsychotics having few side effects. They can in addition be used in the treatment of neurological illnesses<br>
attributable to disturbances in serotonergic transmission, such as depress-<br>
1 ston, anxiety states, panic attacks, obsessive-compulsive disorders, pain,<br>
sleep disturbances, sleeplessness, eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia, addictive behaviour, dependence on certain addiction-causing substances, such as LSD and MDMA, cardiovascular disorders, such as various angina illnesses, Reynaud's syndrome, intermittent claudication, cardiac or peripheral vascular spasms, fibromyalgia, cardiac arrhythmia and thrombotic illnesses, since the substances inhibit blood platelet aggregation. In combination with classical or atypical neuroleptics, the<br>
side effects can be suppressed. Owing to the reduction in ocular pressure,<br>
the substances can also be employed in glaucoma therapy. Toxic symptoms caused by poisoning with, for example, ergovalin can be suppressed using the substances.<br>
For in-vitro detection of the affinity to 5-HT2A receptors, the following test (Example A1), for example, can be used. The 5-HT2A receptors are exposed both to [3H]ketanserine (a substance which is known for its affinity to the receptor) and also to the test compound. The decrease in the affinity of [3H]ketanserine to the receptor is an indication of the affinity of the test substance to the 5-HT2A receptor. The detection is carried out analogously<br><br>
-3-<br>
to the description by J.E. Leysen et al., Molecular Pharmacology, 1982, 21: 301-314, or as also described, for example, in EP 0320983.<br>
The effectiveness of the compounds according to the invention as 5-HT2A receptor antagonists can be measured in vitro analogously to W. Feniuk et al., Mechanisms of 5-hydroxytryptamine-induced vasoconstriction, in: The Peripheral Actions of 5-Hydroxytryptamine, ed. Fozard J.R., Oxford University Press, New York, 1989, p. 110. Thus, the contractility of the rat tail artery caused by 5-hydroxytryptamine is mediated by 5-HT2A receptors. For the test system, vessel rings prepared from the ventral rat tail artery are subjected to perfusion in an organ bath containing an oxygen-saturated solution. By introducing increasing concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine into the solution, a response is obtained to the cumulative concentration of 5-HT. The test compound is then added to the organ bath in suitable concentrations, and a second concentration curve for 5-HT is measured. The strength of the test compound in shifting the 5-HT-induced concentration curve to higher 5-HT concentrations is a measure of the 5-HT2A receptor antagonistic property in vitro.<br>
The 5-HT2A-antagonistic property can be determined in vivo analogously to M.D. Serdar et at., Psychopharmacology. 1996,128:198-205.<br>
Other compounds which likewise exhibit 5-HT2-antagonistic actions are described, for example, in EP 0320983.<br>
Similar piperazine derivatives having antiarrhythmic properties are disclosed, for example, in EP 0431944 and EP 0431945. 5-lsoquinolinesulfonamides are described by A. Morikawa et al. in Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1992,40, 770-3, or in EP 61673 as vasodilators. M. Ohashi et al. in JP 631761177 describe piperazinesulfonyl derivatives as decolourising agents.<br><br>
	-4-<br>
Selective antagonists at the 5-HT2A receptor can preferably be employed against 5-HT2A receptor antagonists. This is because 5-HT2A receptor antagonists also bind to other receptor sub-types of the 5-HT2A group, such as, for example, to the 5-HT2C receptor. It is now being discussed that a 5-HT2C receptor antagonism may cause undesired weight gain (E. Richelson and T. Souder, Life Sci. 2000, 68, 29-39). Selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonists do not induce this effect.<br>
The compounds of the formula I are suitable both in veterinary and in human medicine for the treatment of disturbances in the function of the central nervous system and of inflammations. They can be used for the prophylaxis and combating of the consequences of cerebral infarction phenomena (apoplexia cerebri), such as strokes and cerebral ischemia, and for the treatment of extrapyramidal motor and psychic side effects of neuroleptics and of Parkinson's disease, for the treatment of Parkinson's disease in general, for the acute and symptomatic therapy of Alzheimer's disease and for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. They are likewise suitable as therapeutic agents for the treatment of brain and spinal traumas. In particular, however, they are suitable as medicament active ingredients for anxiolytics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, neuroleptics, antihypertonics and/or for positively influencing obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety states and physiological changes associated with anxiety states, such as, for example, tachycardia, tremor or sweating, panic attacks, psychoses, schizophrenia, inclusive schizotypical personality disorders, for the prevention of schizophrenia in first degree relatives and treatment-resistant schizophrenia, anorexia, delusional obsessions, agoraphobia, migraines, cognitive deficits, Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, for example vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia and dementia in Parkinson's disease, behaviour disturbances in dementia, in particular in the elderly, sleep disturbances, including sleep apnoea, tardive dyskinesia and of psychoses in tardive dyskinesia, learning disorders, age-dependent memory disorders, attention deficit disorders with hyperactivity<br><br>
-5-<br>
and behaviour disorders, eating disorders, such as bulimia, drugs misuse, such as, for example, of alcohol, opiates, nicotine, psychostimulants, such as, for example, cocaine or amphetamines, disturbances of sexual function, aggression disorders in youths and adults, conditions of pain of all types and fibromyalgia.<br>
The compounds of the formula I are suitable for the treatment of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) of neuroleptics. EPS are characterised by Parkinson's-like syndromes, acathisia and dystonic reactions (for example described in EP 337136 for 5-HT2 antagonists). They are furthermore suitable for the treatment of anorexia nervosa, angina, Reynaud's phenomenon, coronary vasospasms, in the prophylaxis of migraines (for example described in EP 208235 for 5-HT2 antagonists), pain and neuralgia (for example described in EP 320983 for 5-HT2 antagonists), for the treatment of Rett syndrome with autistic traits, of Asperger syndrome, of autism and autistic disorders, in concentration deficit states, development disorders, hyperactivity states with mental underdevelopment and stereotypical behaviour states (for example described in WO 9524194 for 5-HT2 antagonists).<br>
The compounds according to the invention are particularly suitable for the treatment of schizophrenia.<br>
They are furthermore suitable for the treatment of endocrine illnesses, such as hyperprolactinemia, furthermore in vasospasms, thrombotic illnesses (for example described in WO 9946245 for 5-HT2 antagonists), hypertension and gastrointestinal illnesses.<br>
They are furthermore suitable for the treatment of cardiovascular illnesses and extrapyramidal symptoms, as described in WO 99/11641, on page 2, lines 24-30, for 5-HT2 antagonists.<br><br>
-6-<br>
They can furthermore be employed as intermediates in the preparation of further medicament active ingredients.<br>
The invention relates to the piperazinylcarbonylquinolines and -isoquino-lines of the formula f and to their physiologically acceptable acid-addition salts. The invention also relates to the solvates, for example hydrates or alcoholates, of these compounds.<br>
The term solvates of the compounds of the formula I is taken to mean adductions of inert solvent molecules onto the compounds of the formula I which form owing to their mutual attractive force. Solvates are, for example, mono- or dihydrates or addition compounds with alcohols, such as, for example, with methanol or ethanol.<br>
The invention relates to the compounds of the formula I and their salts and<br>
solvates according to Claim 1 and to a process for the preparation of<br>
compound^ of the formula I and their salts and solvates, characterised in<br>
that<br>

in which L is Cl, Br, I or a free or reactively functionally modified OH<br>
group,<br>
and R2 is as defined in Claim 1,<br>
is reatted with a compound of the formula III<br><br><br>

group, and R1 and alk are as defined in Claim 1,<br>
or c)     if desired, one of the radicals R2, R3, R4 and/or R5 is converted into<br>
another radical R2, R3, R4 and/or R5 by, for example, cleaving an OA<br>
group to form an OH group and/or converting a CHO group into a CN<br>
group,<br>
and/or a resultant base of the formula I is converted into one of its salts by treatment with an acid.<br>
The invention also relates to the compounds of the formula I according to Claim 1 and to their physiologically acceptable salts and solvates as medicament active ingredients.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to the compounds of the formula i according to Claim 1 and their physiologically acceptable salts or solvates as inhibitors of the 5-HT2A receptor.<br><br>

The compounds of the formula I and also the starting materials for their preparation are, in addition, prepared by methods known per se, as described in the literature (for example in standard works such as Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Georg Thieme Veriag, Stuttgart; Organic Reactions, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York), to be precise under reaction conditions which are known and suitable for said reactions. Use can also be made here of variants which are known per se, but are not mentioned here in greater detail.<br>
The starting materials for the claimed process may, if desired, also be formed in situ by not isolating them from the reaction mixture, but instead immediately converting them further into the compounds of the formula I. On the other hand, it is possible to carry out the reaction stepwise.<br>

The starting materials of the formulae II and III are generally known; the compounds of the formulae II and III which are not known can readily be prepared analogously to the known compounds.<br>
The reaction of the compounds II and III proceeds by methods as are known from the literature for the alkylation or acylation of amines. However, it is also possible to react the compounds in the presence of an inert solvent Examples of suitable solvents are hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene or xylene; ketones, such as acetone or butanone; alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or n-butanol; ethers, such as tetrahydro-furan (THF) or dioxane; amides, such as dimethylformamide (DMF) or N-methylpyrrolidone; nitriles, such as acetonitrile, if desired also mixtures of these solvents with one another or mixtures with water. The addition of an acid-binding agent, for example an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate or of another salt of a weak acid of the alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, preferably of potassium, sodium or calcium, or the addition of an organic base, such as triethylamine, dimethyl-aniline, pyridine or quinoline, or of an excess of piperazine derivative of the formula II, may be favourable. Depending on the conditions used, the reaction time is between a few minutes and 14 days, and the reaction temperature is between about 0 and 150°, normally between 20 and 130°.<br>
Furthermore, compounds of the formula I can be prepared by reacting amines of the formula IV with a component of the formula V containing the radical R1.<br>
The respective components are generally known or can be prepared by known processes as already described.<br>
A resultant base of the formula I can be converted into the associated acid-addition salt using an acid. Suitable acids for this reaction are those which give physiologically acceptable salts. Thus, it is possible to use inorganic acids, for example sulfuric acid, hydrohalic acids, such as hydrochloric acid<br><br>
-14-<br>
or hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acids, such as orthophosphoric acid, nitric acid or sulfamic acid, furthermore organic acids, in detail aliphatic, alicyclic, araliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic monobasic or polybasic carboxylic, sulfonic or sulfuric acids, such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, pivalic acid, diethyiacetic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, pimelic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, 2-phenyIpropionic acid, citric acid, gluconic acid, ascorbic acid, nicotinic acid, isonicotinic acid, methane- or ethanesulfonic acid, ethanedisulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, naphthalenemono- and -disulfonic acids and laurylsulfuric acid.<br>
The free bases of the formula I may, if desired, be liberated from their salts by treatment with strong bases, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate, so long as the molecule contains no further acidic groups. In those cases where the compounds of the formula I have free acid groups, salt formation can likewise be achieved by treatment with bases. Suitable bases are alkali metal hydroxides, alkaline earth metal hydroxides or organic bases in the form of primary, secondary or tertiary amines.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to the medicaments according to the invention having a 5-HT2A receptor antagonistic action for the treatment of psychoses, schizophrenia, depression, neurological disorders, memory disorders, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, eating disorders, such as bulimia, anorexia nervosa, premenstrual syndrome and/or for positively influencing obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).<br>

- 15-<br>
or solvates and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable assistant. The compounds of the formula I here can be converted into a suitable dosage form together with at least one solid, liquid and/or semi-liquid excipient or assistant and if desired in combination with one or more further active ingredient(s).<br>
These preparations can be employed as medicaments in human and veterinary medicine. Suitable excipients are organic or inorganic substances which are suitable for enteral (for example oral), parenteral or topical application and do not react with the novel compounds, for example water, vegetable oils, benzyl alcohols, polyethylene glycols, glycerol triacetate, gelatine, carbohydrates, such as lactose or starch, magnesium stearate, talc or Vaseline. Suitable for oral administration are, in particular, tablets, pills, coated tablets, capsules, powders, granules, syrups, juices or drops, suitable for rectal administration are suppositories, suitable for parenteral application are solutions, preferably oil-based or aqueous solutions, furthermore suspensions, emulsions or implants, and suitable for topical application are ointments, creams or powders. The novel compounds may also be lyophilised and the resultant lyophilisates used, for example, for the preparation of injection preparations. The preparations indicated may be sterilised and/or comprise auxiliaries, such as lubricants, preservatives, stabilisers and/or wetting agents, ernulsifiers, salts for modifying the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, dyes, flavours and/or a plurality of further active ingredients, for example one or more vitamins.<br>
The substances according to the invention are generally administered analogously to known preparations, preferably in doses of between about 0.1 and 500 mg, in particular between 5 and 300 mg, per dosage unit. The daily dose is preferably between about 0.01 and 250 mg/kg, in particular between 0.02 and 100 mg/kg of body weight. However, the specific dose for each particular patient depends on an extremely wide variety of factors, for example on the efficacy of the specific<br><br>
-16-<br>
compound employed, on the age, body weight, general state of health, sex, on the diet, on the time and method of administration, on the rate of excretion, medicament combination and severity of the particular illness to which the therapy applies. Oral administration is preferred.<br>

Example A1<br>
Preparation of a suspension of 5-HT2A receptors; Frontal rat cortex is homogenised in ice-cold buffer. The homogenate is centrifuged at 4°C and 50,000 x for 10 minutes. The pellet is re-suspended in 2.5 ml of ice-cold tris buffer, made up with 10 ml of additional buffer and centrifuged as described. The pellet is then re-suspended in buffer and diluted to give a homogenate which comprises 60 mg of material/ml. 0.1 ml of the suspension, 100 pi of a 5 nM solution of [3H]ketanserine, 100 pi of a solution of the test compound (concentration in the range from 10*5 to 10-10 mol per litre) are introduced into the incubation tubes and made up to 1 ml with buffer. The tubes are incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes. After the incubation has been interrupted by immersing the tubes into an ice bath, the cooled suspension is filtered through a glass filter under reduced pressure. The filters are washed 3x with 5 ml of cold buffer and then transferred into scintillation tubes. The filters are analysed by liquid scintillation spectrometry in 8 ml of Triton-X scintillator liquid.<br>
