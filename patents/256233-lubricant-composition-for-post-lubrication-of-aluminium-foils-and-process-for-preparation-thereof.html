Introduction<br>
The present invention relates to a lubricant composition and process of<br>
preparation thereof. The lubricant composition is particularly suitable for post-<br>
lubrication of aluminium foils used to manufacture Semi Rigid Containers (SRC)<br>
of multiple designs. These Semi Rigid containers are used in food packaging.<br>
Half of Aluminium packaging is semi-rigid and flexible. Examples of such<br>
packaging are container, foil and laminates. All these products are made from<br>
aluminium foils. Manufacturing Aluminium Semi Rigid Container (SRC) foil using<br>
AA 8011 and AA 3003 alloy is known. Thickness of this foil varies between<br>
0.045 mm to 0.100 mm. Foils manufactured are either soft or hard, depending<br>
upon end application.<br>
The SRC foil undergoes some forming/pressing/drawing operation during<br>
manufacture of containers. Forming/drawing operation is carried out using cavity<br>
machine. During such operation, the foil may develop cracks/breaks, which<br>
render the product unfit for use. Therefore, it becomes necessary to provide<br>
lubrication to foil surface to avoid cracking/breaking during the deformation<br>
process. Lubrication of foil on both the sides is done at lubricator machine.<br>
Since the containers will be used for food packaging, the lubricant used should<br>
meet the following requirements :<br>
The lubricant should be made from Food Grade material;<br>
The lubricant should have adequate lubricity;<br>
The lubricant should be odourless ;<br>
The lubricant should not leave any patches/stains on aluminium foil.<br><br><br>
Background<br>
The post-lubrication of aluminium foil for food packaging has been a problem<br>
because, the lubricant has to be a food grade material. The oil layer on<br>
aluminium surface should be thin and uniform and free from lubricant patches<br>
and stains. The lubricated foil should not have any remarkable/noticeable odour.<br>
In other words, it should be possible to control the lubricant film thickness/film<br>
weight (which is dictated by the extent of deformation and end-use of the post-<br>
lubricated foil. In the case of SRC, the depth of deformation can go as high as<br>
2.5 inches). Hence, the lubricant should possess low viscosity to facilitate<br>
control of thickness and uniformity.<br>
Therefore, the desirable aspects of tubricant to be used are:<br>
Lubricant should possess excellent lubricity to prevent cracking/tearing of<br>
foil during deformation operation;<br>
The components of the lubricant should be of food grade ;<br>
Lubricant should be free from any remarkable / noticeable odour;<br>
Lubricant should have good adhesive property;<br>
Lubricant should resist oxidation/hydrolysis/rancidity (food grade<br>
materials have general tendency to undergo these reactions, which may result<br>
in distinct odour and degradation of lubricant; and<br>
Lubricant should have high temperature stability.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
The principal object of the present invention, therefore, is to develop a lubricant<br>
composition including preparation thereof, suitable for post-lubrication of<br>
aluminium foils in the manufacture of Semi Rigid Containers.<br><br><br>
Composition<br>
The present invention accordingly provides a lubricant composition suitable for<br>
post-lubrication of aluminium foils, comprising :<br>
(a)	about 90 to 98 parts by mass of a refined petroleum fraction forming<br>
base material for the composition, said refined petroleum fraction<br>
being paraffinic in nature and having a carbon chain length of 20 to<br>
30 carbon atoms, paraffinic carbon content of at least 98% and<br>
kinematic viscosity of 10 to 20 mm2/s at 40째C<br>
(b)	about 1.5 to 10 parts by mass of a straight chain fatty acid forming a<br>
first additive and having a carbon chain length of 10 to18 carbon atoms ;<br>
and<br>
(c)	about 0.1 to 0.5 parts by mass of an inhibited phenolic compound<br>
forming a second additive,<br>
the three components (a), (b) and (c) being of IP or equivalent grade.<br>
It is advantageous if said refined petroleum fraction forming the base material is<br>
light liquid paraffin having a kinematic viscosity of 11-18 mm2/s at 40째 C. The<br>
light liquid paraffin preferably has a kinematic viscosity at 40째 C of 10 to 20<br>
mm2/s.<br>
The said first additive may be preferably an aliphatic acid having a carbon chain<br>
length of 10 to 18 carbon atoms, and can be selected from dodecanoic acid and<br>
a mixture of dodecanoic acid and tetradecanoic acid. The second additive may<br>
be selected from butylated hydroxy toluene and butylated hydroxy anisole.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the base material comprises 98 parts by mass of<br>
light liquid paraffin, the first additive comprises 1.9 parts by mass of dodecanoic<br>
acid, and the second additive comprises 0.1 part by mass of butylated hydroxy<br>
toluene.<br><br><br>
In a second embodiment, the base material comprises 95 parts by mass of light<br>
liquid paraffin, the first additive comprises 4.9 parts by mass of dodecanoic acid,<br>
and the second additive comprises 0.1 part by mass of butylated hydroxy<br>
toluene.<br>
In a third embodiment the base material comprises 90 parts by mass of light<br>
liquid paraffin, the first additive comprises 9.5 parts by mass a mixture of<br>
dodecanoic acid and tetradecanoic acid, and the second additive comprises 0.5<br>
part by mass of butylated hydroxy toluene.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for the preparation of a lubricant<br>
composition suitable for post-lubrication of aluminium foils, said method<br>
comprising mixing<br>
(a)	about 90 to 98 parts by mass of a refined petroleum fraction forming<br>
base material for the composition, said refined petroleum fraction<br>
being paraffinic in nature and having a carbon chain length of<br>
20 to 30 carbon atoms, paraffinic carbon content of at least 98% and<br>
kinematic viscosity of 10 to 20 mm2/s at 40째 C ;<br>
(b)	about 1.5 to 10 parts by mass of a straight chain fatty acid forming a<br>
first additive and having a carbon chain length of 10 to 18 carbon atoms ;<br>
and<br>
(c)	about 0.1 to 0.5 part by mass of an inhibited phenolic compound<br>
forming a second additive,<br>
the three components (a), (b) and (c) being of IP or equivalent grade	<br>
and stirring, to form a homogeneous mixture.<br>
It is advantageous if the base material (a) and the first additive (b) are first mixed<br>
and stirred together, and the second additive (c) is thereafter mixed therewith,<br>
the entire mixture thereafter being stirred to form said homogeneous mixture.<br><br><br>
It may be noted that none of the above components can be used individually as<br>
lubricant for the post-lubricant of Semi Rigid Container foil. Reasons are :<br>
(i) The base material component (a) has lubricity, uniform film forming ability<br>
on aluminium foil surface ; but, it does not have adequate load bearing capacity<br>
needed during punching / forming operation.<br>
(ii) The first additive (b) has adequate lubricity and load bearing capacity;<br>
but, being solid, it does not have good adhesive property and, cannot form<br>
uniform layer of lubricant on the aluminium foil surface.<br>
(iii) The second additive (c) is not a lubricant; it is an anti-oxidant. But, it is<br>
essential in the composition to prevent any oxidation of components (a) and<br>
(b) and hence, prevent generation of unacceptable odour after post-lubrication of<br>
Semi Rigid Container Foil.<br>
Therefore, it is clear that none of the components mentioned above can be used<br>
individually as lubricant for post-lubrication of Semi Rigid Container foil suitable<br>
for making food containers. However, components (a), (b) &amp; (c) can be used to<br>
formulate lubricant compositions for using as lubricant for the said purpose to get<br>
desired results.<br>
There is no chemical reaction taking place between the components while mixing<br>
and stirring. However, all the components, when formulated together, impart a<br>
synergistic effect for the composition to perform as good lubricant for post-<br>
lubrication of Semi Rigid Container foil suitable for making food containers. The<br>
lubricant composition, when used, provides good lubricity, leaving no patches of<br>
stains on the aluminium foil. The lubricant composition has good adhesive<br>
property and high temperature stability to prevent cracking or tearing of the<br>
aluminium foil. Although these components are of food grade the composition<br>
resists oxidation, hydrolysis and rancidity. Further, since the lubricant<br><br><br>
composition has low viscosity, it is possible to control thickness and uniformity.<br>
Also, the lubricant composition is odourless.<br>
Examples of typical lubricant formulation :<br>
Three lubricant compositions were formed. The components of the three<br>
formulations are given below:<br>
Component Composition 1	Composition 2 Composition 3<br>
Component (a) 98 parts by mass 95 parts by mass 90 parts by mass<br>
Light Liquid Paraffin Light Liquid Paraffin Light Liquid Paraffin<br>
Component (b) 1.9 parts by mass 4.9 parts by mass 9.5 parts by mass<br>
of Dodecanoic Acid of Dodecanoic Acid of Dodecanoic Acid<br>
&amp; Tetradecanoic<br>
Acid Mixture<br>
Component (c) 0.1 part by mass 0.1 part by mass 0.5 part by mass<br>
of Butylated Hydroxy of Butylated	of Butylated<br>
Toluene	Hydroxy Toluene Hydroxy Toluene<br>
All the above components are of IP or equivalent grade.<br>
Various formulations with the above components can be made to suit the needs<br>
of specific post-lubrication application. Out of the above examples, Composition<br>
1 has been evaluated by actually using for post-lubrication of Semi Rigid<br>
Container foil followed by punching / forming operation.<br><br>
Component (a) and Component (b) are weighed accurately and thoroughly<br>
mixed by stirring to form a homogeneous mixture. To this, Component (c) is<br>
added and stirred till complete dissolution. This homogeneous solution is the<br>
said lubricant suitable for post-lubrication.<br>
Evaluation and Formulation<br>
The lubricant composition (Composition 1) was evaluated by actual application<br>
on Semi Rigid Container foil. For this purpose, aluminium foil having following<br>
characteristics was used :<br>
Alloy	AA3003<br>
Thickness	0.045 mm<br>
Width	885 mm<br>
Temper	Soft.<br>
Outline of the process of lubrication is given below:<br>
Machine	Lubricator<br>
Mechanism :	Through Roller and control by Doctor Blade<br>
of Lubrication Mechanism<br>
Aluminium foil, in coil form, was used for applying lubricant. Lubrication was<br>
done on both the sides of the foil at the same time.<br>
Properties of foil after post-lubrication :<br>
(i) The lubrication content as 250 mg/m2<br>
(ii) The lubricant film was uniform, no patches or stains<br>
(iii) No lubricant breakages were visible<br>
(iv) No odour of lubricant.<br><br>
This lubricated foil, after slitting into various small reels, was sent for<br>
punching/forming operation. Details of this operation are:<br>
Machine	Four Cavity Machine<br>
Line Speed :	65 strokes per minute<br>
Container	El 250<br>
Specification<br>
The containers, after punching/deformation operations, were inspected for<br>
quality of deformation and oiliness. The results observed were :<br>
No cracks/breaks in the foils<br>
No odour on foil<br>
Foil surface - free from patches / stains.<br>
Thus, it is clear that the lubricant, prepared as per the formulation and<br>
preparation method thereof, described above, performs well as post-lubricant on<br>
Semi-rigid aluminium foils used in the manufacture of food containers. The<br>
lubricant composition of present invention possesses the following<br>
characteristics:<br>
(i) Lubricant composition is food grade ;<br>
(ii) Lubricant possesses good lubricity and good adhesive property;<br>
(iii) Lubricant is odourless ;<br>
(iv) Lubricant coating is uniform ; no patches or stains ;<br>
(v) Lubricant is resistant to oxidation.<br>
Therefore, it can be said that the lubricant formulation of present invention is not<br>
a mere admixture of components (a), (b) and (c), and that it has a synergistic<br>
effect when applied on Aluminium Semi Rigid foil. Also, there is no chemical<br>
reaction involved while mixing the lubricants.<br><br>
