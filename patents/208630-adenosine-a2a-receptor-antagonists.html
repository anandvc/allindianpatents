ADENOSINE A.^ RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates to substituted 5-amino-pyrazolo-[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine adenosine A^ receptor antagonists, the use of said compounds in the treatment of central nervous system diseases, in particular Parkinson's disease, and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising said compounds. The invention also relates to a process for preparing 5-amino-2-(substituted)pyrazolo[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo-[1,5"C]pyrimidines, intermediates useful in preparing the claimed compounds.<br>
Adenosine is known to be an endogenous modulator of a number of physiological functions. At the cardiovascular system level, adenosine is a strong vasodilator and a cardiac depressor. On the central nervous system, adenosine induces sedative, anxiolytic and antiepileptic effects. On the respiratory system, adenosine induces bronchoconstriction. At the kidney level, it exerts a biphasic action, inducing vasoconstriction at low concentrations and vasodilation at high doses. Adenosine acts as a lipless inhibitor on fat cells and as an antiaggregant on platelets.<br>
Adenosine action is mediated by the interaction with different membrane specific receptors which belong to the family of receptors coupled with G proteins. Biochemical and pharmacological studies, together with advances in molecular biology, have allowed the identification of at least four subtypes of adenosine receptors:   and A3 are high-affinity, inhibiting the activity of the enzyme Aden late cycles, and P  and A  are low-affinity, stimulating the activity of the same enzyme. Analogs of adenosine able to interact as antagonists with the A,, A23 , and A3 receptors have also been identified.<br>
Selective antagonists for the A receptor are of phannacological interest because of their reduced level of side affects. In the central nervous system, A  antagonists can have antidepressant properties and stimulate cognitive functions.<br><br>
Moreover, data has shown that P  receptors are present in high density in the basal ganglia, known to be important in the control of movement. Hence, A , antagonists can improve motor impairment due to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, senile dementia as in Alzheimer's disease, and psychoses of organic origin.<br>
Some xanthine-related compounds have been found to be A, receptor selective antagonists, and xanthine and non-xanthine compounds have been found to have high A affinity with varying degrees of A vs. A, selectivity. Triazole-pyrimidine adenosine A  receptor antagonists with different substitution at the 7-position have been disclosed previously, for example in WO 95/01356; US 5,565,460; WO 97/05138; and WO 98/52568.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Another aspect of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
Yet another aspect of the invention is a method of treating central nervous system diseases such as depression, cognitive diseases and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, senile dementia or psychoses of organic origin, and stroke, comprising administering a compound of funnels I to a mammal in need of such treatment. In particular, the invention is drawn to the method of treating Parkinson's disease comprising administering a compound of funnels 1 to a mammal in need of such treatment.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a process for preparing 5-amino-2-(R-substituted)-pyrazolo[4,3-e]-1,2.4-tria2olo-[1,5-c]pyrimidines of fonnula 11, which are intermediates useful in the preparation of compounds of formula I. The process of preparing compounds of fonnula II<br><br><br>
A preferred aspect of the process is the dehydrative rearrangement of the intermediate of formula IX to obtain the 5-amino-2"(R-substituted)-pyrazolo[4,3-e]" 1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine of formula II. Preferred embodiments of the process use 2-furoic hydrazide or 2-thienoylhydrazide in step 2, thus preparing compounds of formula II wherein R is 2-fury! or 2-thienyl.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a process for preparing 7-bromoalkyl-5-amino-2-(R-substituted)-pyrazolo[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo-[1,5-c]pyrimidine of fonnula Ilia, which are intermediates useful in the preparation of compounds of formula I. The process of preparing compounds of fonnula Ilia<br><br><br>
Still another aspect of the invention is a method of treating Parkinson's disease with a combination of a compound of formula I and one or more agents known to be useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, for example dopamine; a dopaminergic agonist; an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase, type B (MAO-B); a DOPA dicarboxylic inhibitor (DO); or a catechol-0-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor. Also claimed is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I and one or more agents known to be useful in the treatment of Parkinson's in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
As used herein, the term alkyl Includes straight or branched chains. Alkylene, referring to a divalent alkyl group, similarly refers to straight or branched chains. Cycloalkylene refers to a divalent cycloalkyi group. Cycloalkenyl refers to a C^-Cg cycloalkyl ring comprising one double bond.<br><br>
Heteroaryl means a single ring, bicyclic or benzofused heteroaromatic group of 5 to 10 atoms comprised of 2 to 9 carbon atoms and 1 to 4 heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of N, 0 and S, provided that the rings do not include adjacent oxygen and/or sulfur atoms. N-oxides of the ring nitrogens are also included. Examples of single-ring heteroaryl groups are pyridyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, furanyl, pyrrolyl, thienyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, tetrazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidyl, pyridazinyl and triazolyl. Examples of bicyclic heteroaryl groups are naphthyridyl (e.g., 1, 5 or 1,7), imidazopyridyl, pyrido[2,3]imidazolyl, pyridopyrimidinyl and 7-azaindoIyl. Examples of benzofused heteroaryl groups are indolyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, phthalazinyl, benzothieny! (i.e., thionaphthenyl), benzimidazoiyi, benzofuranyl, benzoxazolyl and benzofurazanyl. All positional isomers are contemplated, e.g., 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl and 4-pyridyl. R -substituted heteroaryl refers to such groups wherein substitutable ring carbon atoms have a substituent as defined above.<br>
Certain compounds of the invention may exist in different stereoisomeric forms (e.g., enantiomers, di stereoisomers and atropisomers). The invention contemplates all such stereoisomers both in pure form and in mixture, including racemic mixtures.<br>
Certain compounds will be acidic In nature, e.g. those compounds which possess a carboxyl or phenol hydroxyl group. These compounds may form pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Examples of such salts may include sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminum, gold and silver salts. Also contemplated are salts formed with pharmaceutically acceptable amines such as ammonia, alkyl amines, hydroxyalkylamines, N-methylglucamine and the like.<br>
Certain basic compounds also form pharmaceutically acceptable salts, e.g., acid addition salts. For example, pyrido-nitrogen atoms may form salts with strong acid, while compounds having basic substituents such as amino groups also fonn salts with weaker acids. Examples of suitable acids for salt fonn ation are hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, oxalic, malonic, salicylic, malic, fumaric, succinic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesulfonic and other mineral and carboxylic acids well known to those skilled in the art. The salts are prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt in the conventional manner. The free base forms may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous NaOH, potassium carbonate, ammonia and sodium bicarbonate. The free base forms differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the acid and base salts are   equivalent to their respective free base forms for purposes of the invention.<br><br>
All such acid and base salts are intended to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention and all acid and base salts are considered equivalent to the free forms of the corresponding compounds for purposes of the invention.<br>
Compounds of fonnula ! can be prepared by known methods from starting materials either known in the art or prepared by methods known in the art; see, for example, WO 95/01356 and J, Med. Chem.. 39 (1996) 1164-1171,<br>
Preferably, the compounds of formula I are prepared by the methods shown in the following reaction schemes. In Scheme 1, alkylation of a 5-aminO"pyrazolo[4,3-e]-[1,2,4Hriazolo[l ,5-c]pyrimidine of fomnula II is used to prepare compounds of formula 1:<br><br>
Starting materials of formula II can be reacted with an alky I diol ditosylate and a base such as NaH in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide (DMF), or with a chloro-bromo- or dibromo-alkyl compound under similar conditions, to obtain the alkyl-substituted intermediate of formula III. The compound of formula III is then reacted with an amine of the formula Z-Y-H in an inert solvent such as DMF at an elevated temperature to obtain a compound of fonnula la, i.e., a compound of formula I wherein X is alkylene.<br>
Alternatively, staring materials of formula it can be reacted with a compound of formula Z-Y-X-CI and a base such as NaH in an inert solvent such as DMF to obtain a mixture of a 7-substituted compound of formula I and the corresponding 8-substituted compound.<br>
To prepare compounds of formula I wherein Y is piperazlnyl and Z is R®-C(0)-, R'-SO -, R'-OC(O)-, R'-N(R&gt;C(0)- or R'-N(RVC(S)", a compound of fonnula I wherein Z-Y is 4-t-butoxycarbonyl-l-piperazinyl is deprotected, for example by reaction with an acid such as HCl. The resultant free piperazinyl compound, IV, is treated according to procedures well known in the art to obtain the desired compounds. The following Scheme 2 summarizes such procedures:<br><br><br>
In this procedure, chloropyrazolo-pyrimidine V is reacted with a compound of formula Z-Y-X-CI in a manner similar to the alkylation procedure of Scheme 1, and the resultant intermediate is reacted with a hydrazide of formula H2N-NH-C(0)-R (or with hydrazine hydrate, followed by a compound of formula CI-C(O)-R). The resultant hydrazide undergoes dehydrative rearrangement, e.g., by treatment with N,0-bis-<br><br>
{trimethylsilyl)acetamide (BSA) or a combination of BSA and hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) and at elevated temperatures.<br>
Starting materials are known or can be prepared by processes known in the art. However, compounds of formula II are preferably prepared by the novel process disclosed above and described in further detail here.<br>
In the first step of the process, 2-amino-4,6-dihydroxypyrimidine (VI) is converted to the corresponding 4,6-dichloro-5-carboxaldehyde by treatment with POCI3 roscoe in DMF as described in Helv. Chim. Act. 69 (1986), 1602-1613. The reaction is carried out at an elevated temperature, preferably about 100°C, for 2 to 8 hours, preferably about 5 hours.<br>
In the second step, 2-amino-4,6-dichloropyrimidine-5-carboxaldehyde (VII) is treated with a hydrazide of the formula H2N-NH-C(0)-R, wherein R is as defined above, to obtain the compound of formula VIII; the compound of formula VI and the hydrazide are used in a molar ratio of approximately 1:1, with a slight excess of the hydrazide being preferred. The reaction is carried out at room temperature or up to about 80°C in a solvent such as CH3CN or DMF. The reaction time is about 16 hours (e.g., overnight).<br>
In the third step, the compound of formula Val is heated at 60-100°C with 1-5 equivalents of hydrazine hydrate In a solvent such as CH3CN or DMF for 1-24 hours to obtain the compound of formula IX.<br>
In the last step, the compound of formula IX undergoes dehydrative rearrangement by treatment with a mixture of HMDS and BSA or with BSA alone. The reaction is carried out at elevated temperatures, preferably about 120°C, for about 16 hours (e.g., overnight)<br>
After each step of the process, the crude material is purified by conventional methods, e.g., extraction and/or recrystallisation.<br>
Compared to previously published methods for preparing the intermediate of formula II, this method proceeds in fewer steps, under milder reaction conditions and with much higher yield.<br>
The compounds of fondles V and VII are known (Helve. Chim. Act. 69 (1986), 1602-1613).<br>
Another method for preparing compounds of formula I is illustrated in the following Scheme 4.<br><br><br><br>
Chloride Val is treated with a hydroxyalkyl-hydrazine in an inert solvent such as ethanol at temperatures from ambient to 100°C to furnish derivative X. This is subjected to dehydrative Cyclization, similarly to IX, such as with BSA, to provide tricyclic XI. Tricyclic XI is then converted to bromide Ilia with Prig at elevated temperature from 80°C to 150°C for 1 to 24 hours. Intermediate XI can also be converted into the consulate analogous to Ilia by toluenesulfonic chloride and base. Bromide Ilia is converted to compounds of formula I as described above for III.<br>
Another method for preparing compounds of formula i is illustrated in the<br>
following Scheme 5: Scheme 5:<br><br><br>
In analogy to Scheme 1, chloride V is converted into alkylated compound Xli, and this is further reacted with carbonate XIV, where R' is preferably f-butyl or benzyl:. to obtain derivative XIII. A solvent such as DMF may be employed at a temperature of 60-120°C. This is then reacted as in Scheme 1 to furnish XV. The R' group is next removed, such as removal of a f-butyl group with HCI aorta, furnishing hydrazine XVI. Acylation of XVI furnishes XVII, which is subjected to dehydrative cyclization as described above to provide desired la. Alternatively, XII may be reacted with a hydrazide XVIll to obtain XIX, which can be converted to XVII analogously to preparation of XV.<br><br>
