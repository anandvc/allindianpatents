				<td>The invention relates to a system for localizing sports equipment. The invention also<br>
relates to a method for localizing sports equipment using such a system.<br>
When playing a sport it is generally difficult to localize (exactly) an accessory required<br>
for that sport at a determined point in time. The localizing of sports equipment may<br>
however be desired in particular situations, for instance to track down articles of sports<br>
equipment lost during playing of the sport, or to be able to apply the rules of a sport in a<br>
more efficient manner* In golf for instance it is a frequent occurrence for a golf ball to<br>
be lost while the game is being played. Another example of where localization of<br>
articles of sports equipment may be desired is football. Since the so-called offside<br>
situation has been assessed heretofore wholly by human observation, wherein whether a<br>
football player is offside or not must be determined quickly and efficiently, a more<br>
perfect electronic observation can be desired instead of, or in addition to* human<br>
observation. In addition to the above mentioned sports and sports equipment, an<br>
electronic system for localizing articles of sports equipment Is usually also a desirable<br>
addition when pkying other types of sport, such as for instance tennis and (ice) hockey.<br>
The term sports equipment should be interpreted broadly: this includes prima facie all<br>
objects, or even persons, required for playing a particular sport<br>
The invention has for its object to provide a system with which the location of an article<br>
of sports equipment can be determined at any time with great accuracy.<br>
The invention provides for this purpose a system of the type stated in the preamble,<br>
comprising: means for generating an energy field, wherein the energy field is formed by<br>
one or more pulse streams, at least one article of sports equipment provided with at least<br>
one disrupting means for locally disrupting ms energy field, detecting means for<br>
detecting the local disruption of the energy field, and a control unit coupled to the<br>
detecting means for localizing the article of sports equipment on the basis of the<br>
detected local disruption.<br>
By means of the system according to the invention it is possible to localize quickly,<br>
effectively and accurately an article of sports equipment provided with a disrupting<br>
means in an energy field at any random point in time. The position of the article of<br>
sports equipment can herein be determined both two-dimensionally and threedimensionally,<br>
depending on the application. The generation of the energy field in the<br>
system according to the invention takes place via pulse streams by means of<br>
UltraWideBand (UWB) technology. UWB allows the transmission of relatively large<br>
quantities of data per unit of time (between about 50 and about 1000 megabit per<br>
second, but in particular up to about 600 megabit per second). As relatively small<br>
energy surges, the pulses per se contain no data but. by transmitting the pulses a fraction<br>
sooner or later man a basic pattern, it does however become possible to transmit digital<br>
data at very hi gh speed. In the system according to the invention an energy field formed<br>
by pulse streams is intentionally applied, since other types of energy field, for instance<br>
WiFi networks, have diverse drawbacks. Use is thus no longer made of electromagnetic<br>
(sinusoidal) waves with a determined scarce ether frequency, but use is made of<br>
electromagnetic pulses which are transmitted in unobstructed and imperceptible manner<br>
via a unique maximal bandwidth (frequency spectrum). Owing to the relatively wide<br>
frequency spectrum, the energy per frequency is relatively low, generally even much<br>
lower than the noise threshold, whereby the UWB signal will not disrupt other types of<br>
electromagnetic energy flows, or hardly so. Interference will therefore not occur when<br>
pulse streams are applied. In addition, the maximum transfer speed of data via pulses is<br>
many tunes greater than the transfer speed of data via electromagnetic radiation. The<br>
pulse streams are preferably made up of ultra-short pulses following closely on each<br>
other, in order to further increase the transfer speed of data. The means for generating<br>
the energy field and the detection means are preferably integrated with each other.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the means for generating the energy field are adapted to<br>
transmit pulse beams of a plurality of pulse streams, wherein at least two pulse streams<br>
of a pulse beam are oriented at least substantially parallel to each other. By dividing the<br>
pulse signal into a plurality of parallel pulse streams, the pulses forming part of the<br>
pulse streams do not have to follow very closely on each other to increase the transfer<br>
speed. This has the advantage that the detection means can be given a less sensitive, and<br>
therefore generally less expensive form. In a particular preferred embodiment, each<br>
pulse beam comprises nine pulse streams, which pulse streams are oriented at least<br>
substantially parallel to each other. It is in general particularly advantageous to make up<br>
each pulse beam from nine pulse streams oriented parallel to each other since this<br>
considerably enhances the reliability of the system. The pulses are thus transmitted at a<br>
sufficient interval from each other, whereby error correction systems are generally no<br>
longer necessary.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the disrupting means is adapted to disrupt the energy<br>
field in unique manner. In the case a plurality of articles of sports equipment are placed<br>
in an energy field, the localization of each article of sports equipment can take place<br>
individually, wherein the danger of confusion can be prevented. Each golf ball can for<br>
instance thus be provided with its own, unique disrupting means. In another<br>
embodiment it is even conceivable for each player of an outdoor sport, such as for<br>
instance football, tennis and (ice) hockey, to be provided with a unique disrupting<br>
means, whereby the (relative) position of the players can be determined at any random<br>
moment<br>
As already described above, the system according to the invention comprises a<br>
disrupting means adapted for local disruption of the energy field. Local disruption of the<br>
pulse streams, preferably pulse beams, should be interpreted broadly. In a preferred<br>
embodiment the disrupting means is adapted to reflect the pulse streams. There<br>
therefore occurs prima facie only reflection of the pulse streams. The direction of<br>
propagation of the pulse streams is then changed (disrupted), which can be detected by<br>
the detection means. The detection of reflection of pulse streams can also be designated<br>
as a radar-related technology. In another preferred embodiment, the disrupting means is<br>
adapted to influence the pulse streams. In influencing of the pulse streams the relative<br>
orientation of the pulses relative to the basic pattern is specifically changed (disrupted),<br>
which can also be determined by the detection means.<br>
The disrupting means is preferably formed by a chip. The chip is generally relatively<br>
small and can usually be inserted in simple manner in or on the article of sports<br>
equipment<br>
The chip is preferably provided with electrical energy in order to enable influencing of<br>
the pulse pattern of the energy field.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the disrupting means is formed by a coating on the<br>
article of sports equipment A coating can generally be applied to the article of sports<br>
equipment in relatively simple and inexpensive manner. The coating is usually<br>
particularly adapted to reflect pulse streams. In addition to a chip and a coating, the<br>
disrupting means can also be differently designed. The disrupting means can thus also<br>
be formed for instance by at least one material part from which the article of sports<br>
equipment is manufactured.<br>
The system is preferably provided with visual means communicating with the control<br>
unit for displaying the location of the detected article of sports equipment. It may for<br>
instance also be desirable, for instance during a game of golf, to visualize the detected<br>
location of the article of sports equipment The visual means can herein be physically<br>
connected to the control unit, but are generally positioned at a distance from the control<br>
unit. The communication between the control unit and the visual means takes place<br>
wirelessly, preferably via electromagnetic radiation, for instance via a WiFi network.<br>
Less stringent technical requirements are usually set for the transmission of data from<br>
the control unit to the visual means. In another preferred embodiment, the<br>
communication between the control unit and the visual means also takes place<br>
wirelessly, however via pulse streams. The visual means can for instance be formed by,<br>
or form part of a portable device, which can preferably be hand-held by a user. Nonlimitative<br>
examples hereof can be: a PDA, an XDA and a WDA.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for localizing sports equipment using such a<br>
system, comprising the steps of: A) generating an energy field, wherein the energy field<br>
is formed by one or more pulse streams, B) placing in the energy field at least one<br>
article of sports equipment, provided with at least one disrupting means for locally<br>
disrupting the energy field, C) detecting the local disruption of the energy field, and D)<br>
localizing the article of sports equipment on the basis of the detected local disruption.<br>
Articles of sports equipment can thus be localized in the energy field in relatively<br>
efficient, precise and rapid manner. Further advantages of the method according to the<br>
invention have already been described above.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention, the method is<br>
provided with a step E) comprising of visualizing the location of the article of sports<br>
equipment after localizing the article of sports equipment on the basis of the detected<br>
local disruption as according to step D). Through visualizing of the article of sports<br>
equipment, a person can quickly and clearly determine the position of the article of<br>
sports equipment in an energy field. The loss of golf balls can thus be prevented, or at<br>
least countered, wherein the speed of play of the gam« of golf can likewise be increased<br>
considerably. The offside situations generally of importance in football can also be<br>
established hi relatively rapid, simple and precise manner.<br>
The invention is elucidated on the basis of non-limitative exemplary embodiments<br>
shown in the following figures, wherein:<br>
figure 1 shows a schematic view of a preferred embodiment of a system according to<br>
the invention,<br>
figure 2 shows a perspective view of a plurality of golf balls according to the invention,<br>
and<br>
figure 3 shows a schematic top view of a part of a football game provided with a system<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic view of a preferred embodiment of a system 1 according to<br>
the invention. System 1 is substantially stationed on both sides of a playing field 2.<br>
System 1 comprises a plurality of transmitters 3 adapted to continuously generate an<br>
energy field 4 above playing field 2. The energy field 4 is formed by a plurality of pulse<br>
beams 5, wherein each pulse stream 5 is made up in this embodiment of three pulse<br>
streams G oriented at least substantially parallel to each other. On a side of the playing<br>
field 2 remote from transmitters 3 mere are positioned a plurality of receivers 7 for<br>
receiving pulse beams 5 transmitted by transmitters 3. Now situated on playing field 2<br>
are two articles of sports equipment 8,9, each provided with a unique disrupting means<br>
for disrupting the pulse beams 5 locally and in unique manner. As shown in figure 1,<br>
pulse beams 5 are disrupted in unique manner after disruption by the articles of sports<br>
equipment 8,9. Receivers 7 are adapted to detect these unique local disruptions, on the<br>
basis of which the position of each article of sports equipment 8,9 can be determined on<br>
playing field 2 using a control unit 10 coupled to receivers 7. The relative position of<br>
the articles of sports equipment 8,9 determined by control unit 10 is transmitted,<br>
preferably via a wireless network 11, to a portable device 12 provided with a display 13.<br>
Using device 12 a user can thus see where the marked articles of sports equipment 8,9<br>
are situated in playing field 2. In this embodiment the playing field 2 can for instance be<br>
formed by a golf course, and the articles of sports equipment 8,9 can for instance be<br>
formed by golf balls, golf clubs, the green, the flag, the bunker and the hole. Using the<br>
system 1 according to the invention the sports equipment can be localized in simple<br>
manner at any desired point hi time, whereby the loss of sports equipment can be<br>
prevented and the speed of play by (golf) players can thus be increased considerably.<br>
The relative position between different articles of sports equipment, such as for instance<br>
the distance between a golf ball and the flag, can moreover also be determined and<br>
visualized using the system according to the invention. In a variant of the shown<br>
embodiment, receivers 7 are positioned on a plurality of sides of playing field 2 and can<br>
optionally be integrated with transmitters 3.<br>
Figure 2 shows a perspective view of a plurality of golf balls 14,15,16 according to the<br>
invention. In the core of the two golf balls 14,15 on the left is arranged a microchip 17<br>
for local disruption of an energy field formed by pulse streams. Microchip 17 can be<br>
provided with energy in order to have the local disruption of the pulse streams take<br>
place more effectively. The golf ball 16 on the right is provided on an outer side with a<br>
coating 18 for reflection of pulse streams incident upon golf ball 16. As already<br>
described above, both influencing and reflection of pulse streams can be detected, on<br>
the basis of which the position of golf balls 14,15,16 can be determined in the energy<br>
field.<br>
Figure 3 shows a schematic top view of a part of a football game 19 provided with a<br>
system 20 according to the invention. The game of football 19 comprises a playing field<br>
21 on which players 22 of two teams 23,24 take up position, hi addition to a linesman<br>
25 and a football 26. Around playing field 21 there are a plurality of transmitter/receiver<br>
units 27 for transmitting respectively receiving pulse streams 28, particularly in the<br>
form of pulse beams 29. Each player 22, as well as football 26, is provided with a<br>
disrupting means (not shown) for local disruption of the generated energy field. Each<br>
team 23,24, as well as football 26, disrupts the energy field in its own distinct manner.<br>
As already described above, a control unit 30 coupled to transmitter/receiver units 27<br>
can at any time determine precisely the relative position of football 26 and of each<br>
player 22 on playing field 21. This can be particularly important in the case of for<br>
instance offside decisions, goal decisions and in positioning players when free kicks are<br>
being taken. Via the continuously transmitted pulse streams, whereby a transfer speed<br>
of data of up to 600 megabit per second can be achieved, the relative position of players<br>
22 can be determined at the moment football 26 is played, and it can thus be concluded<br>
whether there is an offside situation. In the present case the football 26 is played from a<br>
player [7] 22 to another player [10] 22 (see line a). Since linesman 25 is not standing in<br>
line with the rearmost player 22 [2] of the other team 24, but is viewing the situation of<br>
play at an angle, an incorrect offside decision will often be made (see line b). By<br>
providing linesman 25 with a PDA CPersonal Digital Assistant') 31 communicating with<br>
control unit 30, the situation of play can be further viewed quickly and easily from one<br>
or more different perspectives at the moment football 26 is played, whereafter which a<br>
more substantiated assessment can be made of the situation of play which has occurred.<br>
It will thus be possible to prevent, or at least counter, the taking of incorrect decisions<br>
during the game of football 19.<br><br><br>
