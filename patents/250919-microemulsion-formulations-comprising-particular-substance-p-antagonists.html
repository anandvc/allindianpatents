Microemulsion formulations comprising particular substance P antagonists<br>
The present invention relates to novel pharmaceutical compositions in which the active agent is a substance P antagonist, in particular a 5-aryl-4(R)-arylcarbonylamino-pent-2-enoic acid amide, that is useful for the treatment and prevention of respiratory diseases including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bowel disorders including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), urinary incontinence, and cough.<br>
5-aryl-4(R)-aryIcarbonylamino-pent-2-enoic acid amide substance P antagonists are a class of compounds described in international patent application WO 98/07694, the contents of which publication is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
5-aryl-4(R)-arylcarbonylamino-pent-2-enoic acid amide substance P antagonists, such as those disclosed in WO 98/07694, present highly specific difficulties in relation to administration generally and galenic compositions in particular, including in particular problems of drug bioavailability and variability in inter- and intra-patient dose response, necessitating development of a non-conventional dosage form.<br>
In accordance with the present invention it has now surprisingly been found that stable pharmaceutical compositions with 5-aryl-4(R)-aryIcarbonylamino-pent-2-enoic acid amide substance P antagonists, having particularly interesting bioavailability characteristics and reduced variability in inter- and intra-subject bioavailability parameters, are obtainable. These novel compositions have been found to meet or substantially reduce the difficulties encountered previously.  It has been shown that the compositions of the invention may enable effective dosaging with concomitant enhancement of bioavailability as well as reduced variability of absorption/bioavailability levels for and between individual patients. Thus, the invention may achieve effective therapy with tolerable dosage levels of such 5-aryl-4(R.)-arylcarbonyiamino-pent-2-enoic acid amide substance P antagonists, and may permit closer standardization and optimization of daily dosage requirements for each individual. Consequently, occurrence of potential undesirable side-effects is diminished and overall cost of therapy may be reduced.<br><br>
In a first aspect the present invention provides a spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition comprising a 5-aryl-4(R)-arylcarbonyIamino-pent-2-enoic acid amide substance P antagonist.<br>
The spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition is hereinafter also referred to as a "composition of the invention". It is preferably a microemulsion preconcentrate.<br>
Terms used in the specification have the following meanings:<br>
"Active agent" as used herein means a 5-aryl-4(R)-arylc£rbonylamino-pexit-2-enoic acid amide substance P antagonist, such as those disclosed in WO 98/07694.<br>
"Poorly water soluble11 as used herein means having a solubility in water at 20°C of less than 1%, for example 0.01 % weight/volume, i.e. a "sparingly soluble to very slightly soluble drug" as described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19th Edition, Ed. A.R. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Company, US, 1995, vol. 1, p 195.<br>
"Bioavailable" as used herein with reference to a composition means the composition provides a maximum concentration of the active agent in that composition in a use environment that is at least 1.5 fold that of a control comprising an equivalent quantity of the undispersed drug.<br>
"Spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition" as used herein means a composition that contains an active agent herein defined and is capable of producing colloidal structures-when diluted with an aqueous medium, for example water, or in gastric juices. The colloidal structures can be solid or preferably liquid particles including droplets and nanoparticles. The spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition is preferably a microemulsion preconcentrate.<br>
"Microemulsion preconcentrate" as used herein means a composition which spontaneously forms a microemulsion in an aqueous medium, for example, in water, for example on dilunion of 1: 1 to 1: 300, preferably 1: 1 to 1: 70, but especially 1: 1 to 1: 10 or in the gastric juices after oral application.<br>
"Microemulsion" as used herein means a slightly opaque, opalescent, non-opaque or substantially non-opaque colloidal dispersion that is formed spontaneously or substantially<br><br>
spontaneously when its components are brought into contact with an aqueous medium. A microemulsion is thermodynamically stable and typically contains dispersed droplets of a mean diameter less than about 200 nm (2000 A). Generally microemulsions comprise droplets or liquid nanoparticles that have a mean diameter of less than about 150 nm (1500 A); typically less than 100 nm, generally greater than 10 nm, and they are stable over periods up to 24 hours.<br>
Microemulsions offer greater ease of preparation due to spontaneous formation., thermodynamic stability, transparent and elegant appearance, increased drug loading, enhanced penetration through the biological membranes, increased bioavailability, and less inter- and mtra-individual variability in drug pharmacokinetics than coarse emulsions. Further characteristics of microemulsions can be found in United Kingdom patent specification GB 2,222,770; Rosof, Progress in Surface and Membrane Science, 12, 405 et seq. Academic Press (1975); Friberg, Dispeision Science and Technology, 6 (3), 317 et seq. (1985); and Muller et al. Pharm. Ind., 50 (3), 370 et seq. (1988)].<br>
Throughout this specification and in the claims that follow, unless the context requires otherwise, the word "comprise", or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers or steps<br>
In a second aspect the present invention provides a spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition comprising a 5-aryl-4(R)-arylcarbonylamino-pent-2-enoic acid amide substance P antagonist as an active agent, and a carrier medium comprising a lipophilic component, a surfactant, and optionally a hydrophilic component.<br>
Preferably the spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition is suitable for oral administration.<br>
The 5-aryl-4(R)-arylcarbonylamino-pent-2-enoic acid amide substance P antagonist is poorly water soluble as herein defined. It has a water solubility of below 0.001 %, e.g. 0.001 to 0.0001 %.<br>
The active agent is preferably used in free base form.<br><br>
In a third aspect the present invention provides a microemulsion preconcentrate comprising a 5-aryl-4(R)-aryIcarbonylamino-pent-2-enoic acid amide substance P antagonist.<br>
In a fourth aspect the present invention provides a rxiicroemulsion preconcentrate comprising a 5-aryl-4(R)-arylcarbonylamino-pent-2-enoic acid s.mide substance P antagonist and a carrier medium that comprises a lipophilic component, a surfactant, and optionaUy a hydrophilic component.<br>
The rnicroemulsion preconcentrate preferably forms an o/w (oil-in-water) rnicroemulsion when diluted with water.<br>
Preferably the relative proportions of the lipophilic component(s), the hydrophilic components), and the surfactant(s) lie within the "Fvlicroemulsion" region on a standard three way plot graph. These phase diagrams, can be generated in a conventional manner as<br>
described in e.g. GB 2,222,770 or WO 96/13273.<br>
In a fifth aspect the present invention provides a rnicroemulsion comprising a 5-aryl-4(R)-arylcarbonylamino-pent-2-enoic acid amide substance P antagonist.<br>
The microemulsion is preferably an o/w (oil-in-wat&amp;rj microemulsion.<br>
In a sixth aspect the present invention provides a mLcroemulsion comprising a 5-aryl-4(R)-arylcarbonyIamino-pent-2-enoic acid amide substance P antagonist, a lipophilic component, a surfactant, water, and optionally a hydrophilic component.<br>
The colloidal structures of the microemulsion form spontaneously or substantially spontaneously when the components of the composition of the invention are brought into contact with an aqueous medium, e.g. by simple shacking by hand for a short period of time, for example for 10 seconds. The compositions of the invention are thermodynamically stable, e.g. for at least 15 minutes or up to 4 hours, even to 24 hours. Typically, they contain dispersed structures, i.e. droplets or liquid nanopartlcles of a mean diameter less than about 200 nm (2,000 A), e.g. less than about 150 nm (1,500 A), typically less than 100 nm (1,000 A), generally greater than 10 nm (100 A) as measured by standard light scattering techniques, e.g. using a MALVERN ZETASIZER 3O00™ particle characterising machine.<br><br>
Solid drug particles of mean diameter greater than 200 nm may also be present. The proportion of particles present may be temperature dependent.<br>
The active agent is a neurokinin antagonist (NK antagonist) and is therefore capable of preventing disease symptoms that are caused inter alia by the activation of the NK1 receptor by substance P and the activation of the NK2 receptor by neurokinin A [=NKA]. The substance-P-antagonising effects can be demonstrated, for example, as follows: in vitro&gt; for example, the binding of 3H-substance P to the bovine retina in the radio receptor assay according to H. Bittiger, Ciba Foundation Symposium 91 (1982) 196-199, is inhibited with IC50 values of from about 0.2 nM.<br>

This compound is hereinafter referred to as Compound A.<br>
The preferred and especially preferred active agents, in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, may be prepared as described in international patent application WO 98/07694. As mentioned therein, they may be in the form of their hydrates and/or may include other solvents, for example solvents which may have been used f?or the crystallisation of compounds in solid form.<br><br>
In accordance with the present invention the active agent may be present in an amount by weight of up to about 20% by weight of the composition of the invention, e.g. from about 0.05% by weight. The active agent is preferably present in an amount of 0.5 to 15 % by weight of the composition, more preferably in an amount of 1.5 to 5% by weight of the composition.<br>
The active agent is poorly water soluble so it is carried in a carrier medium.<br>
In some embodiments of the compositions of the invention the carrier medium comprises a lipophilic component and a surfactant. In other embodiments the carrier medium comprises a lipophilic component, a hydrophilic component and a surfactant.<br>
The lipophilic component comprises one or more lipophilic substances.   The hydrophilic component comprises one or more hydrophilic substances. And the carrier medium can contain one or more surfactants.<br>
The compositions of the invention can include a variety of additives including antioxidants, antimicrobial agents, enzyme inhibitors, stabilizers, preservatives, flavours, sweeteners and further components such as those described in Fiedler, H. P. "Lexikon der Hilfsstoffe fur Pharmazie, Kosmetik und angrenzende Gebiete", Editio Cantor, D-7960 Aulendorf, 4th revised and expanded edition (1996). These additives will conveniently be dissolved in the carrier medium.<br>
The compositions of the invention include a lipophilic component or phase. The active agent may be contained in this component of the carrier medium.<br>
The lipophilic component (when present) is preferably characterized by a low HLB value of less than 10, e.g. up to 8. Suitable lipophilic components include:<br>
1)      Glyceryl rnono-Cg-Cv-fattv acid esters<br>
These are obtained esterifying glycerol with vegetable oil followed by molecular distillation. Monoglycerides suitable for use in the compositions of the invention include borh symmetric (i.e. fi-monoglycerides) as well as asymmetric monoglycerides<br>
(a-monoglycerides. They also include both uniform glycerides (in which the fatty acid<br><br>
constituent is composed primarily of a single fatty acid) as well as mixed glycerides (i.e. in which the fatty acid constituent is composed of various fatty acids) The fatty acid constituent may include both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids ha_*ving a chain length of e.g. CB-CH. Particularly suitable are caprylic or lauric acid monoglycerides which are commercially available, e.g. under the trade names Imwitor® 3O8 or Imwitor® 312, respectively, from e.g. sasol. For example Imwitor® 308 comprises at least 80 % monoglycerides and exhibits the following additional characterising data: free glycerol max 6 %, acid value max. 3, saponification value 245-265, iodine value max. 1, water content max. 1 %. Typically it comprises 1 % free glycerol,  90 % monoglycerides, 7 % diglycerides&gt; 1 % triglycerides (H. Fiedler, Joe. cit., volume 1, page 798). A further example is Capmul MCM C8 from Abitec Corporati on.<br>
Mixtures of mono- and di-glvcerides of Q-Cut fatty acids<br>
These include both symmetric (i.e. 15-monoglycerides and a^-diglycerides) as well as asymmetric mono- and di-glycerides (i.e. a-monoglycerides and a,Jl-digIycerides) and acetylated derivatives thereof. They also include both uniform glycerides (in which the fatty acid constituent is composed primarily of a single fatty acid) as well a_s mixed glycerides (i.e. in which the fatty acid constituent is composed of various fatty acids) and any derivatives thereof with lactic or citric acid. The fatty acid constituent may include both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids having a chain length of" from e.g. CB-CIO. Particularly suitable are mixed caprylic and capric acid mono- and di-glycerides as commercially available, e.g. under the trade name Imwitor® ~P42 or Imwitor 928, from e.g. sasol. For example Imwitor® 742 comprises at least 45% monoglycerides and exhibits the following additional characterising data: free glycerol max. 2 %, acid value max. 2, saponification value 250-280, iodine value nax. 1, water max. 2 % (H. Fiedler, he. dt.&gt; vol 1, page 798). Other suitable mixfures comprise mono/diglycerides of caprylic/capric acid in glycerol as known an d commercially available under e.g. the trade name Capmul® MCM from e.g. Abitec Corporation.

One group of compositions of the invention may be of high stability that are capable, on addition to water, of providing aqueous microemulsions having an average particle size of 
The compositions of the invention exhibit especially advantageous properties when administered orally; for example in terms of consistency and high level of bioavailability obtained in standard bioavaiiability trials.<br>
Pharrnacokinetic parameters, for example drug substance absorption and measured for example as blood levels, also become surprisingly more predictable and problems in administration with erratic absorption may be eliminated or reduced. Additionally the pharmaceutical compositions are effective with biosurfactants or tenside materials, for example bile salts, being present in the gastro-intestinal tract. That is, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are fully dispersible in aqueous systems comprising such natural tensides and thus capable of providing emulsion or microemulsion systems and/or particulate systems in situ which are stable. The function of the pharmaceutical compositions upon oral administration remain substantially independent of and/or unimpaired by the relative presence or absence of bile salts at any particular time or for any given individual. The compositions of this invention may also reduce variability in inter- and intra-patient dose response.<br>
The utility of the compositions of the invention may be observed in standard clinical tests in, for example, known indications of active agent at dosages giving therapeutically effective active agent blood levels. Any increased bioavailability of the compositions of the invention may be observed in standard animal tests and in clinical trials.<br>
The dose of the active agent in the compositions of the invention is of the same order as, or up to half, that used in known compositions containing the active agent. The compositions of the invention show activity at concentrations from about 0. 1 mg to about 40 mg/day of<br><br>
active agent, preferably from about 0. 1 mg to about 20 mg/day, e.g. most preferably from about 0.1 to about 3 mg/day of active agent for respiratory disease states.<br>
The compositions of the invention are useful for the treatment of respiratory diseases, e.g. asthma and chronic bronchitis. For these indications, the appropriate dosage will, of course, vary depending upon, for example, the particular composition of the invention employed, the host, the mode of administration, and the nature and severity of the conditions being<br>
treated.<br>
A typical dose for the active agent is from 0. 1 to 1 mg/day for asthma and chronic bronchitis.<br>

2. Bioavailability<br>
..Bioavailability analysis of Example 1 in a dog study shows, that single peroral doses of 20 mg Compound A given as standard capsule formulation using micronized DS (formulation A) resulted in significantly lower plasma levels of Compound A (-50%) than given as microemulsion (formulation B). For illustration of the data see table below and figure on page<br>

3. Embodiment:<br>
In general for our microemulsions the most preferred embodiment are soft gelatine capsules. This is due to the fact that a number of microemulsion excipients e.g. propylene glycolj are incompatible with hard gelatin capsules making them brittle. Soft gelatine capsules contain a large amount of softener and therefore compatibility is better.<br><br><br>
