				<td>The present invetion relates to multiple knife cutting device. Background of the invention.<br>
The knife has an important place in the kitchen, workshop, or restaurant It is so versatile and useful that in spite of all other gadgets and machines invented the knife has not become redundant . The present invention has been developed to minimize (he time taken for the following works done by a knife -Cutting, Dicing, Slicing, Slitting of Vegetables and such other materials, which can be cut normally by a utility knife. There is no such device available in (he market presently.<br>
The invention as described herein is manually operated and does not involve any power drive. It however does not preclude the development of power driven device.<br>
Object:<br>
The object of the present mvention is to make single cutting, dicing or slicing at home or restaurants or workshops more effcient, uniform and increase productivity. Material (hat can be cut, include food item such as Vegetables, Finger Chips, Salami, Apples etc. Or non-edible items such as Leather, Rubber, Vinyl Leather, Paper, and card- board strips.<br><br>
Hie cuttinig job jof a sii^gle knife is slow and laborious and time consuming. A person cutting large quantities of vegetables on a daily basis would get tired of monotoiQr of the cuttii^ job. Cuttiqg^ dicing and sliciqg are an inq&gt;ortant part of ttie kitchen routine and deserves a better device. There is no manual device in tfie market presently, vAnch can do Ms job efQciently. The present invention will prove to be extremely usefiil for a lai::ge number of people.<br>
Hie present invention retains the basic features of the knife but only ino-eases its efiGiciency and output However it does not make the knife obsolete because the knife is so versatile. It makes the cutting operation much safer as the ve^t^les are not held by hand during ci^ting. This is an inqiortant safety feature of the invention.<br>
The present boards in the maricet for vegetable cutting cannot be conq)ared to die board in ibis invention as it has specially designed separators and slots to separate (he cut pieces from between the knives.<br>
FkiorArt.<br>
At present the following cutting devices are being used:<br>
i)	sinq)le knives (Single knife with handle)<br>
ii)       Box type / sheet type, scrapii^ / slicing / grating embodiment<br>
iii)      Motorised slicing / g^'ating embodiment<br><br>
iv)      Hiere is tfie traditional Indian device of the slanting blade fixed on a wood base. Hiis is the reverse of the knife operation. ITie cutter is stationery and the woiit moves, v)       A crank operated manual device with blades mounted on a rotary<br>
drunL The disadvantages of the devices used in the prior art are Aat they are not efiQcient, the cutting work is more laborious and requires several repetition of the same process using bo&amp; hands .The present invention overcomes these disadvant^es, and also make the dicing and slicing more uniform. The present invention therefore attains the woric being done &amp;ster, more efficiently and with a proper shape of the material to be cut<br>

Hie operation of (he embodiment has been detailed in the description of the individual embodiment The following basic principles are common to all embodiments.<br>
i)        Use of a plurality of Knives, blades or otiier cutting devices.<br>
ii) Guides and separators mounted on a baseboard Knife and board have to be used together to achieve results.<br><br>
la Ae optimum embodiment the work can be done several times faster conq)ared to usiqg a siAgle knife blade for cuttiAg. The cutting is of uniform size and sh^e. The woric is also safer as die material to be cut such as vegetable are not held close to (he hand The five embodiments function on the common basic principle of using multiple knife assembly in conjunction with special baseboard, \which facilitates the cutting and separation of the pieces from the knives.<br>
Hie difference in the six embodiments is in the arrangement of knives and how diey move during the cutting operation and also wdiedier levers are used or not Hiis is done to give a choice to tiie user to:<br>
(a)	Choose the device depending upon Ae nature of the job, such as li^ heavy, cutting, finger chip cutting etc<br>
(b)	Choose a device which is basic or which has additional features, diat has cost implications.<br>
For sinqjlicity the embodiments described herein use 6 knives mounted with a g^ of 12 mm between adjacent knives. The option is available to use ai^ number of knives from two to eleven widiout m^or changes in the structural design and witfi diSerent gaps between blades. TTiis is possible by changing ttie knife holder part 2,3 in devices 3,4 and 5.<br>
The knife assembly must be used in conjunction with a special baseboard that has suitable separators, slots, guides and stops to accomplish tiie<br><br>
task of dicing or finger chip cutting or thick slicing by successfully separating the cut pieces without using the fingers. The preparation of the vegetable before dicing like cleaning, peeling, cutting into long strips, removing the ends is to be done in the nonnal fashion The detailed working is explained in the description of each device in (he following pages. Materials of construction.<br>
The board can be made of plastic, the knives are made of stainless steel grade 440. The angles and flats are made of stainless steel 304. The fasteners are made of stainless steel 304/316.<br>
1) Muti-knife with handles (drawing sheet nos 1 and 2)<br>
Hiis embodiment involves a plurality of knives. Ideally six blades or knives are as8end&gt;led witii plastic handles on both sides as illustrated in Figure 4 , in sheet 2 which shows the knife assembly.<br>
The handles shown as S have 11 slots 6mm i^art from each other. The knives at 4 are fitted in only 6 slots as shown in die fig.4. The knives are fixed in the handle by means of two screws, shown as (7) in the figure on each handle. This assembly is not rigid as compared to devices 3,4,5. Part 8 which is a 2x20 mm fiatbar is connected parallel to the knives at the ends.It connects both the handles and also gives strength and tension to the assembly.<br><br>
The board 1 and the knife guides 2,3 are shown in sheet no 1. The guides<br>
are 100 mm apart on the board and have 1.2 mm slots (6) in Figure 2 ,<br>
spaced to match with the 6 mm distance between the knives. When knives<br>
are at 12 mm distance the 6mm slots remain idle. They will all be used when<br>
knife	assembly        of        6mm	gap        is        chosen.<br>
There are six straight correspondiog straight groove8( which is shown as 6 in Figure 2 on the board at a spacing to match the knives.<br>
The vegetables are placed on the board between the guides 2,3.. The knife assembly is placed in the guide slots over the vegetables and the matching is done visually. It is pressed down firmly using both the handles. The knife assembly goes down cutting the vegetables and all the cut pieces remain on the board. In one operation all the vegetables are cut as compared to several cuts by the single knife. The time taken for vegetable cutting is dramatically reduced. This embodiment is not suitable for hard items or vegetables like carrots, as the assembly has no frame for the knives. Using different knife assemblies can chauge dthe size of the pieces. An alternate knife assembly made of 6x6 mm stainless steel section (1) is shown in fig 4 A.Each knife 2 is in a slot in the individual frame widi a tension mechanism as shown in part 3.The knife is pushed up a slope and settles in a slot creating tension. The handles 4 are assembled with die knife frames by means of screws as shown at (5).<br><br>
The knives match with (he slots in board and guides of fig l,part l,2,3.The method of usage is same as with the knife assembly in fig 4   explained earlier in (he descriptioa 2) Multi Roller Knife (drawing sheet 3).<br>
This embodiment conqnises of six number circular blades of 72 nun diameter and 0.60 mm thick shown as (1) in Figure 7, are assembled together with 12 mm gap between the blades as illustrated in Figure 6.on Sheet No 3. The handle shown as 2 in the figure extends beyond the fulcrum (shown as 4 in the figure 6) in the front<br>
.The strips shown as (2) in Figure 6 which form the handle are each 10.8 mm thick and a spacer 1.2 mm thick is inserted between the handle8(3).Thi8 gives a play of 0.60 mm for each blade for free rotation. The handle strips are screwed together at location (5) of Figure 6. The board 7 is shown in fig 5. There are 6 grooves shown as (8) in Figure 5, 5 mm deep and 1.2 mm wide in the board which run all through the length of the board. There is an end stop (6) at the end of the board shown in Figure 5A. The end stop separates the cut pieces from between (he knives. The extension of the handle strip in front of fulcrum screw 4 also prevents the pieces   fi-om   traveling   with   the   knives,   as   shown   in   Figure   6.<br>
The vegetables are spread on the board before (he end stop. The roller knives are placed in the grooves and the assembly is rolled over the vegetables simultaneously applying downward force. The assembly is pulled towards<br><br>
(he slot in the md stop. With this single operation all tfie vegetables are cut into small pieces and get separated from the knives. This operation is several times faster than using a single roller blade. This device is meant for cutting items, which are not hard example okra, beans. It is also good for cutting strips of rolled dough for deeo-frying, pasta, noodles soft sweets etc. or any similar flat material, which can be cut with single knife. The preparation of the vegetables is to be done as usual. This device is for light use and it cannot cut items like carrots. 3&gt; Multi knife with "Pf" frame and telescope guides (drawing sheet 4)<br>
Multi knife with "pi" frame telescopic guides is illustrated in Figure 9. It compries of 6 blades or knives, shown at part 4, assembled on a frame, shown at 1,2 and 3, which is 'pi', shaped. There are two holes in the top member shown as 1 in the Figure 9, which are part of the telescipic guides, which are shown as 7 and 10 in the Figure 8 . These guides are provided to match the knives shown at 4, with the slots on the board shown at 13 and also to hold the springs.<br>
The board has a raised platform of 12 separators shown at (12) in Figure 8, and 11 slots .The platform extends 75 mm beyond the knife assembly to facilitate placing long vegetables and is detachable for easy cleaning. The board also has two vertical pipes shown as 10, which are part of the telescopic guides. There are springs around the telescope guide pipe. These lift the frame up after the cut and prevent accidental cuts.<br><br>
The knife holders (2&amp;3) in Figure 9 are designed to receive upto 11 blades at 6 nun, 12 mm and 18 mm distance from each other. As the gap increases the number of blades will reduce. The blades are held in place by a 4 mm screw passing through all the blades. Knife holders shown as 2 and 3 fit in a slot on the top member of the frame shown as 1 in the Figure. The vegetables are spread on the platform with slots. The knife assembly is pushed down by hand against the spring on to the vegetables. The knives have an arrow shape with converging edges which are sharp.. The knives go into the slot at the end of the stroke cutting the vegetables. The knife assembly travels up due to the springs if the hand is released .The cut pieces are pushed out by a spatula before the hand release. The device is ready for the next cycle. The separators (12) in Figure 8 are instrumental in separating the cut pieces from the knives.<br>
Figure 10 shows the end view of the blade assembly with eleven slots, but in this case only six blades are assembled.<br>
The operation is simple and fast but there is no lever mechanism which reduces the effort An embodiment with the lever mechanism is provided for in device 4 and 5. The vegetables are to be prepared in the normal fashion before placing on the platform (like cleaning, peeling etc.) For Finger chips a 6mm gap knife assembly is used. In the first cut the potato is cut into 6mm slices. Then they are rotated sideways and a second cut is made. Now the finger chips are ready. In two cuts whole potato is<br><br>
turned into finger chips. The potato is to be prepared by normal knife by<br>
squaring the 4 sides before the first cut so that it will rest properly on the<br>
platform.<br>
The Tension mechanism and the Tomato slicer attachment will be described<br>
later.<br>
4) Multi Knife device with hinge and Lever - (drawing sheet 5)<br>
This embodiment is illustrated in figures 11 and 12. The knife assembly "Pi" frame shown as 1,2,3 in Figure 11 is connected to a lever mechanism 14, which in turn is mounted on a hinge shown at 9 at the end of the board 13. The knife assembly is guided by two slots in part 1 of (he frame shown in figure 12 and also the pipes 7. The fi'ame also pivots on part 6 ,bolt as shown in Figure 12. Hiese make the knife movement horizontal and vertical simultaneously as the lever is brought down in an arc. The spring keeps the frame horizontal.<br>
The material to be cut such as vegetables are placed on the platform 12 and using the lever the knife assembly is brought down. The knife cuts the vegetables as it comes down on the platform slots formed by separator 12. Force required to cut is reduced because of the lever action.<br>
The Hinge shown as 8, 9 in the Figure 12 and the slots are designed to to prevent side play in the frame so that the knives match the slots when they<br><br>
come down. The vegetable pieces get separated at the end of (he downward<br>
stroke. A spatula can be used to push these out before the lever is released.<br>
The cutting action is vertical and horizontal.<br>
A spring 11 on the board around the pipes 7 gets pressed in the downward<br>
stroke. After the cut is over and pieces are pushed out, the lever is released<br>
and the spring takes the assembly up preventing accidental cuts. This is a<br>
very useful safety feature.<br>
There are no telescopic guides in the device. The frame part 1 slides against<br>
the spring and die pipe 7. This movement is not as smooth asthat of device S.<br>
The cutting of hard vegetables will be smoother with device number 5<br>
described next All nonnal vegetables and finger chips can be cut with this<br>
device.<br>
5) Multiknife device with lever - vertical action.<br>
This embodiment has the best features and the vertical cutting action is<br>
smooth. The knife assembly and board are the same as in device no.3 but the<br>
manual effort required is much less. As a result diffocult vegetables like<br>
carrots are easier to cut with this device. This is the most versatile option<br>
citable of cutting all types of vegetables and finger chips smoodily without<br>
snags.<br>
Figure 13 shows the general arrangement of the device. The knife assembly<br>
1,2 and 3 in Figure 13 is connected to   levers   14 at the sides tfarough an<br>
angle part 6 with sliding slots and bolts IS, as shown in Figures 13 and 15 .<br>
The levers move on a hinge shown as 8 and 9 at one end of th board (Figure<br><br>
13). The telescopic guides 7 and 10 guides the knife frame smoothly into the slots in the base 13, vertically. The knife arrangement as it appears in the direction of arrow A is shown in Figure 14.<br>
Fig '17 A" shows the details of a tension mechanism suitable for devices 3,4,5. This will be used in applications where hard materials/vegetables are to be cut The knife is pushed up a slope as shown in 1 and the pin of tiie knife settles into the slot 2 on the knife holder 3 of fig 13, creating tension.<br>
The vegetables are placed on the platform 12 in Figure 13 (spread out adjacent to each other) and the levers are pushed downward all the way for the cut The cut pieces or slices remain on the platform at 12. They are to be pushed out before assembly lever is released The spring takes (he assembly to the starting position at the top, when the lever is released, ready for the next cut There is no danger of the knife assembly falling down accidentally. This device is also ideal for commercial establishments in addition to home, when used in multiple numbers.<br>
It is also very efficient for cutting finger chips or apple slices or onion slices. As the device is operated manually there is no risk of high speed rotating parts injuring the fingers. Even as compared to a single knife this device is safer as die vegetables are not held with the hand. This is a novel &amp; exclusive feature. Cutting onions also will be a less arduous task as you can stand at distance from the onion and the cutting time taken is much shorter (a fraction of the normal time).<br><br>
The user can decide the knife spacing depending on what he wants to do. Inter changeable knife/blade assemblies can be made for 6,12,18,24 mm spacing.<br>
6) Tomato slicer attachment Sheet 8, Fig 18,19,20.<br>
A special attachment for tomato slicing has been designed with serrations and<br>
arrow point on the knife as shown in Figure 18. The blade width is less than the<br>
cutting blades(10 mm).Thi8 can be used for device nos 3,4,3.<br>
The knife assembly is brought down on the Tomatoes giving 5.4 mm thick<br>
slices.<br>
Commercial models of the same embodiments can be made to cut greater quantities of items such as vegetables. This would require the blade to be longer at around 250 mm.A tension device is essential to prevent the blades from bending on load. the details of the tension mechanism are shown in Figure 17 on sheet 7. The tensioning device can be designed in different ways also. Other alterations can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>

MULTIPLE KNIFE CUTTING DEVICE- ABSTRACT<br>
A multiple knife cutting device having an assembly of two or more knives and a base board with multiple grooves or slots used as a platform to place the material to be cut The grooves correspond to the knife members to enable the knives to enter the grooves, whereby the knives after cutting the material goes below the material cut into the grooves in the board The grooves in the board run all through the length of the board A stopper at the end of the board is designed to fiicilitate separation of the cut pieces from between die knives<br>
This invention makes the process of citting dicing or slicing at home or restaurants or workshops more efficient, uniform and increases productivity. An important safety feature of the invention is that the material to be cut is not held close to the hand during cutting.<br>
The basic principles of the invention are:<br>
iii)      Use of multiple knives, or odier cutting devices.<br>
iv)      Guides and separators on a baseboard Knife and board have to<br>
be used together to achieve results.<br>
There are difierent embodiments of the invention depending upon the arrangement of knives and how they move during the cutting operation and whether levers or additional features are used or not<br><br></td>
