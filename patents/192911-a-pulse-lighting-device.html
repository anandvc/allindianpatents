This  invention  relates  to  a  pulse  lighting  device.<br>
This invention proposes a device which illuminates an area with light reflected from a source. The illumination is produced by one or more reflectors rotating around a source of light of light, the illumination of the area being thus discontinuous, that is to say, in pulses. However, to the eye of the observer, the illumination appears continuous and of uniform intensity because the reflectors are driven at a speed resulting in the phenomenon of "persistence of vision", which occurs when the frequency of images formed on the retina of the eye equal or exceeds what is called the " critical frequency of fusion". Consequently, a source of light of light of low illumination capacity can "produce" a high illumination on the area to be illuminated, by means of the device proposed herein.<br>
The source of light of light can take any convenient form e.g. an incandescent lamp, a gas lamp or even a candle. The nature of the source of  light  is  determined  by  the  application  and    the<br><br>
effect to be produced. So also the configuration of the reflecting surface of the reflectors will be such as to reflect light from the source of light   in  defined  directions.<br>
The pulse lighting device, according to this invention, comprises a source of light; at least one reflector provided with means for rotatably driving the same around the source of light, the surface configuration of the reflector reflecting light from the source of light in defined directions, whereby as the reflector rotates around the source of light at a speed resulting in the critical frequency of fusion being equalled or exceeded, the area to be illuminated, on which the reflected light falls discontinuously, in pulses, appears, to the eye of the observer, to be continuously  and  intensely  illuminated.<br>
This invention will now be described with refer¬ence to the accompanying drawings which illus¬trate, by way of example, one of various possible embodiments  of  the  device  proposed  herein,  wherein<br>
Fig.l   illustrates  the  embodiment  in  elevation;<br><br>
Fig.2 illustrates a separate view of the twin reflectors with source of light of light, in elevation;<br>
Fig.3 illustrates the twin reflectors with source of  light  of  light,   in  plan;<br>
and Fig.4     illustrates  how  the  surface  of  a     reflector as  illustrated  in  Figs.   2  and  3  is  generated.<br>
The source of light of light is indicated by S. At least one reflector provided with means for rotatably driving the same around the source of light is provided. In the drawings two reflectors R  spaced  from  each  other  are  shown.<br>
The surface configuration of the reflectors R re¬flects light from the source of light S in defined directions, whereby as the reflector rotates around the source of light at a speed resulting in the critical frequency of fusion being equalled or exceeded, the area to be illuminated, on which the reflected light falls discontinuously,     in  pulses,     appears,   to  the    eye<br>
•<br>
of  the  observer,  to  be  continuously  and     intensely<br><br>
illuminated.<br>
The source of light S is locatable in the desired position with respect to the reflectors R. In the embodiment illustrated the surface configuration C of the reflectors R is parabolic, the source of light  being  located  at  the  focus  of  the  parabola.<br>
Fig.4 illustrates how the surface of the reflector is generated. The parabola P is depicted with respect to its X and Y axes indicated by X and Y. Imagine an axis X' passing through the focus F of the parabola P, the said axis X' being parallel to the X axis. Imagine further that the portion of the parabola P above the axis X' (shown in thick outline) is now rotated about the said axis X' through 180 degrees over the plane of the paper. The generated surface is the surface of the reflectors R illustrated in Figs.l to 3. What is however noteworthy is that sections of the said surface taken along the radial planes of rotation will  have  the  same  focus  F.<br>
The reflectors R are rendered rotatable by fixing them    on    supports  T  mounted  on  a  manually    driven<br><br>
shaft E. The supports T are fastened to the shaft<br>
E by the screws VI. The shaft will either be<br>
manually driven or driven by a prime mover, such<br>
as,       an    electric    motor     or     engine.	In       the<br>
embodiment illustrated, the shaft E is driven by the  motor  M.<br>
In the drawings, a tube D is shown to pass through a bore B in the shaft E, said tube being surmount¬ed by a holder H carrying the source of light S, the tube and holder being adjustable to locate the source of light S in the desired position with respect to the reflector, in order to obtain the desired illumination effect. The tube D can be unfastened by operating the screw V2 and raised or lowered to raise or lower the holder H and then refastened in place by operating the said screw. So also the lamp bulb constituting the source S can be moved horizontally to, and fastened in, the desired position, by operating the screws V3. Alternatively, the holder H will be rendered movable on its main body G, so as to enable the holder (along with the lamp bulb) to be moved and fastened     in  the  desired  position.     The    screw    V4<br><br>
fastens the main body G of the holder to the tube D.<br>
Where the source of light of light S happens to be an incandescent lamp bulb (as illustrated), the tube 0 is utllsed for accommodating wiring and wiring  accessories.<br>
The device proposed herein can be put to several uses. Notably, it can be used as an emergency lighting system, as a lighting system in large halls, playgrounds, school and college campuses and, generally, in all places where a bright and economical   lighting  system  is  required.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of the device proposed herein are possible without de¬parting from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
