Description<br>
CYLINDER SUPPORTING STRUCTURE OF RE-<br>
CIPROCATING COMPRESSOR<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a reciprocating compressor, and in particular to a<br>
cylinder supporting stricture of a reciprocating compressor capable of facilating<br>
assembly operation of a cylinder combined with a frame and preventing deformation<br>
of the cylinder when the cylinder is fixed-combined with the frame and a discharge<br>
cover covering thereon.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	Generally, a compressor converts electrc energy into kinetic energy and<br>
compresses refrigerant by the kinetic energy. The compressor is the core part, and the<br>
compressor can be divided into a rotary compressor, a scroll compressor and a re-<br>
ciprocating compressor, etc. according to fluid compression mechanisms.<br>
[3]	Figure 1 is a sectional view illustrating the reciprocating compressor. As depicted in<br>
Figure 1, the reciprocating compressor includes a casing 100 having a gas siction pipe<br>
110 and a discharge pipe 120; a frame unit 200 disposed in the casing 100; a driving<br>
motor 300 installed to the frame unit 200 to generate a linear reciprocating driving<br>
force; a compression unit 400 for compressing gas by receiving the driving force of the<br>
driving motor 300; and a resonance spring unit 500 for resonating the driving force of<br>
the driving motor 300.<br>
[4]	The frame unit 200 includes a front frame 210 for housing the compression unit<br>
400; a middle frame 220 combined with the front frame 210; and a rear frame 230 for<br>
fixing the driving motor 300 with the middle frame 220.<br>
[5]	The driving motor 300 includes an outer stator 310 fixed between the middle frame<br>
220 and the rear frame 230; an inter stator 320 inserted into the outer stator 310 and<br>
fixedly combined with the rear frame 230; a mover 330 movably inserted between the<br>
outer stator 310 and the inner stator 320; and a wiring coil 340 combined with the<br>
outer stator 310. The mover 330 consists of a magnet 331 and a magnetholder332 for<br>
supporting the magnet 331.<br>
[6]	The compression unit 400 includes a cylinder 410 fixedly combined with the front<br>
frame 210; a piston 420 in which one end is movably inserted into an inner spase (P)<br>
of the cylinder 410 and the other end is fixedly combined with the mover 330; a<br>
discharge cover 430 installed to a side of the front frame 210 to cover the inner space<br><br>
WO 2004/081378	2	PCT/KR2004/000508<br>
(P) of the cylinder; a discharge valve 440 disposed in the discharge cover 430 to open/<br>
close the inner space (P) of the cylinder; a discharge spring 450 disposed in the<br>
discharge cover 430 to support the discharge valve 440; and a suction valve 460<br>
installed to the end of the piston 420 to control flow of refrigerant sicked into the inner<br>
space (P) of the cylinder.<br>
[7]	Reference numeral 510 is a spring support, 520 is a front coil spring, and 530 is a<br>
rear coil spring.<br>
[8]	Operation of the reciprocating compressor will be described as following.<br>
[9]	When power is supplied to the reciprocating compressor, a linear reciprocating<br>
driving force is generated by electro-magnetic mutual operation of the driving motor<br>
300, and the linear reciprocating driving force is transmitted to the piston 420 through<br>
the mover 330.<br>
[10]	The piston 420 performs a linear reciprocating motion in the inner spare (P) of the<br>
cylinder 410, by a pressure difference generated in the inner space (P) of the cylinder<br>
420 according to the linear reciprocating motion, the siction valve 460 and the<br>
discharge valve 440 are operated, and accordingly the refrigerant is sicked into the<br>
inner space (P) of the cylinder 410, compressed and discharged. The discharged re-<br>
frigerant is discharged to the outside through the discharge cover 430 and the<br>
discharge pipe 120 combined with the discharge cover 430.<br>
[11]	By the resonance spring unit 500, the motion of the mover 330 and the piston 420 is<br>
resonated.<br>
[12]	In the meantime, in order to minimize leakage of compression refrigerant between<br>
the cylinder 410 and the piston 420 in the operation and improve a compression<br>
performance, the cylinder 410 and the piston 420 have to be assembled precisely. In<br>
addition, in order to make the piston 420 perform the linear reciprocating motion<br>
smoothly in the inner space (P) of the cylinder 410, the cylinder 410 has to be<br>
precisely combined to the front frame 210.<br>
[13]	Figure 2 is an exploded-sectional view illustrating the assembly of the cylinder.<br>
[14]	As depicted in Figure 2, in the front frame 210, a cylinder insertion hole 212 having<br>
a certain inner diameter is pierced-formed at a certain-shaped body portion 211, a ring-<br>
shaped oil pocket 213 having a certain width and depth is formed on the inner cir-<br>
cumference of the cylinder insertion hole 212, and a mounting portion 214 having a<br>
certain depth and outer diameter is formed at an inlet side of the cylinder insertion hole<br>
212.<br>
[15]	The cylinder 410 is inserted into the cylinder insertion hole 412 of the front frame<br><br>
WO 2004/081378	3	PCT/KR2004/000508<br>
210. The cylinder 410 includes a cylinder portion 411 having a certain length; and a<br>
ring-shaped bridging portion 412 extended-projected from the outer circumference of<br>
the cylinder portion 411. In the cylinder 410, the cylinder portion 411 is inserted into<br>
the cylinder insertion hole 212 of the body portion 211, and the bridging portion 412 is<br>
inserted into the mounting portion 214.<br>
[16]	By the oil pccket 213 and the mounting portion 214 formed at the inner cir-<br>
cumference of the cylinder insertion hole 212, relatively projected two portions are<br>
formed, one is a front support portion 215, and the other is a rear support portion 216.<br>
An inner diameter of the front support portion 215 and the rear support portion 216 is<br>
corresponded to an outer diameter of the cylinder portion 411 of the cylinder 410, the<br>
front support portion 215 and the rear support portion 216 are contacted to the outer<br>
circumference of the cylinder portion 411 of the cylinder 410, and accordingly the<br>
cylinder 410 is supported. In addition, an inner diameter of the mounting portion 214 is<br>
corresponded to an outer diameter of the bridging portion 412 of the cylinder 410.<br>
[17]	The discharge cover 430 includes a cap portion 431 having a cap shape; and a<br>
flange portion 432 curved-extended from the end of the cap portion 431.<br>
[18]	In the discharge cover 430, the flange portion 432 is contacted to the end surface<br>
217 of the body portion 211 of the front frame and the side surface 413 of the bridging<br>
portion 412 of the cylinder, and the flange portion 432 is combined with the end<br>
surface 217 of the body portion 411 of the front frame by plural bolts 10 fastened at<br>
the flange portion 432 of the discharge cover. Accordingly, the discharge cover 430 is<br>
fixedly combined with the front frame 210.<br>
[19]	An oil passage 218 in which oil flow into/out of the oil pccket 213 is respectively<br>
formed at the front frame 210.<br>
[20]	The piston 420 is movably inserted into the inner space (P) of the cylinder.<br>
[21]	Reference numeral 433 is a through hole, and 219 is a screw hole,<br>
[22]	However, in the above-mentioned stricture, when the plural bolts 10 are fastened in<br>
order to combine the discharge cover 430, the front frame 210 and the cylinder 410, a<br>
fastening force applied on the bolts 10 is transmitted to the front frame 210.<br>
[23]	The fastening force transmitted to the front frame 210 acts on the portion at which<br>
bolt 10 is combined, due to that, repulsive power may act on the front support portion<br>
215 which is the inner side of the portion at which the bolt 10 is fastened, and twisted<br>
force generated in fastening of the bolts 10 may acton the front support portion 215.<br>
[24]	By the repulsive power and twisted force acting on the front support portion 215, as<br>
depbted in Figure 3, deformation occurs at the front support portion 215 supporting<br><br>
WO 2004/081378	4	PCT/KR2004/000508<br>
the cylinder 410, and the deformation force is transmitted to the cylinder 410 contacted<br>
with the front support portion 215. By the force transmitted to the cylinder 410, the<br>
cylinder 410 may be deformed or error may cccur in assembly size of the cylinder, and<br>
accordingly abrasion of the parts may oxur or operation may not be performed<br>
smoothly.<br>
Disclosure<br>

invention to provide a cylinder supporting stricture of a reciprocating compressor<br>
capable of facilitating assembly operation of a cylinder combined with a frame and<br>
preventing deformation of the cylinder in combining of a discharge oover for covering<br>
the cylinder with the frame.<br>
[26]	In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, in a reciprocating compressor<br>
including a frame having a cylinder insertion hole therein, a cylinder inserted into the<br>
cylinder insertion hole of the frame, a piston performing a linear reciprocating motion<br>
in the cylinder by receiving a driving force of a driving motor, a discharge cover for<br>

cylinder supporting stricture of a reciprocating compressor respectively. The same<br>
parts with the conventional art will have the same reference numerals.<br>
[35]	As depicted in Figures 4 and 5, a cylinder 410 is inserted into a front frame 240 of a<br>
frame unit 200, and a piston 420 is movably inserted into an inner space (P) of the<br>
cylinder. And, a discharge cover 430 covers a side of the cylinder 410 and is fixedly<br>
combined with the front frame 240 by a fastening means. The fastening means is plural<br>
bolts.<br>
[36]	In the front frame 240, a cylinder insertion hole 242 having a certain inner diameter<br>
is formed at a certain-shaped body portion 241. And, a ring-shaped axial support 243<br>
having a certain width and height is formed at the inner circumference of the cylinder<br>
insertion hole 242, a ring-shaped radial support 244 having a certain width and height<br>
is formed at the inner circuniference of the cylinder insertion hole 242 at a certain<br>
internal from the axial support 243, herein the radial support 244 has an inner diameter<br>
greater than that of the axial support 243.<br>
[37]	The axial support 243 is arranged so as to be nearer to the discharge cover 430 in<br>
comparison with the radial support 244. The axial support 243 and the radial support<br>
244 are extended-formed on the inner circumference of the cylinder insertion hole 242.<br>
[38]	The cylinder 410 includes a cylinder unit 411 having a certain length so as to<br>
receive a piston 420 therein; and a bridging portion 412 projected from the outer cir-<br>
cumference of the cylinder portion 411 so as to have a certain width and height. The<br>
bridging portion 412 has a ring shape.<br>
[39]	An inner diameter of the cylinder insertion hole 242 of the front frame 240 is<br>
greater than an outer diameter of the cylinder unit 411 of the cylinder 410, an inner<br>
diameter of the radial support 244 of the front frame 240 is the same with an outer<br>
diameter of the cylinder unit 411 of the cylinder 410, and an inner diameter of the axial<br>
support 243 is smaller than an outer diameter of the cylinder unit 411.<br>
[40]	In the cylinder 410, the cylinder unit 411 is inserted into the cylinder insertion hole<br>
242 of the front frame 240, a side surface of the bridging portion 412 is contacted to a<br>
side surfxe of the axial support 243, and the inner ciraimfercnce of the radial support<br>

WO 2004/081378	6	PCT/KR2004/000508<br>
side of the axial support 243 of the front frame 240 to the side of the bridging portion<br>
412, the cylinder 410 is supported in the axial direction, by contacting an inner surface<br>
(A) of the radial support 244 of the front frame 240 to the outer circumference of the<br>
cylinder unit 411, the cylinder 410 is supported in the radial direction.<br>
[41]	A width (a) of the radial support 244 is greater than a width (b) of the axial support<br>
243.<br>
[42]	An oil pocket 245 in which oil circulates is formed in a space between the axial<br>
support 243 and the radial support 244. A mounting portion 247 is formed between an<br>
inlet of the cylinder insertion hole 242 and a side of the axial support 243. A width (c)<br>
(in the length direction) of (he bridging portion 412 is the same with or greater than a<br>
distance between the end of the inlet of the cylinder insertion hole 242 of the front<br>
frame and a side surface of the axial support 243. An outer diameter of the bridging<br>
portion 412 is smaller than an inner diameter of the cylinder insertion hole 242.<br>
[43]	The discharge cover 430 includes a cap portion 431 having a cap shape and a flange<br>
portion 432 curved-extended from the cap portion 431.<br>
[44]	In the discharge cover 430, the flange portion 432 is contacted to an end surface<br>
246 of the body portion of the front frame and a side of the bridging portion 412 of the<br>
cylinder, and plural bolts 10 pierce through holes 433 formed at the flange portion 432<br>
and are respectively fastened to screw holes 248 formed at the end surface 246 of the<br>
body portion of the front frame. According lo that, the discharge cover 430 is fixedly<br>
combined with the front frame 240, by fastening the plural bolts 10 to the discharge<br>
cover 430 and the front frame 240, the cylinder 410 is pressurized-fixed to the<br>
discharge cover 430.<br>
[45]	In the front frame 240, oil passages 249 in which oil flows into/out of the oil pocket<br>

cumferential direction. A diameter of a circle formed by the inner surface of the plural<br>
protrusions (B) is greater than an outer diameter of the cylinder 410.<br>
[48]	Hereinafter, advantages of the cylinder supporting stricture of the reciprocating<br>
compressor in accordance with the present invention will be described.<br><br>
WO 2004/081378	7	PCT/KR2004/000508<br>
[49]	In the present invention, the cylinder 410 combined with the front frame 240 is<br>
supported in the axial and radial direction by pressurization of the discharge cover 430,<br>
and accordingly a combination state is firm. In more detail, the bridging portion 412 of<br>
the cylinder contacts-supports the axial support 243 in the axial direction, the<br>
discharge cover 430 pressurizes the cylinder 410 in the axial direction, the radial<br>
support 244 of the front frame supports the outer ciraimference of the cylinder portion<br>
411 of the cylinder in the radial direction, and accordingly the combination state of the<br>
cylinder 410 is firm.<br>
[501	And, when the plural bolts 10 are fastened to combine the discharge cover 430, the<br>
front frame 240 and the cylinder 410, the fastening force by the bolts 10 acts on the<br>
front frame 240. The fastening force acting on the front frame 240 acts on a portion at<br>
which the bolt 10 is combined, axording to that, repulsive power xts on the axial<br>
support 243 formed at the inner side of the portion (at which the bolt 10 is combined),<br>
and twisted force occurred in fastening of the bolts 10 acts on the axial support 2-6.<br>
Hbwever, because the axial support 243 is not contacted to the cylinder portion 411 of<br>
the cylinder but maintains a certain interval, the repulsive power and the twisted force<br>
act only on the axial support 243 without being transmitted to the cylinder 410. Ac-<br>
cordingly, by the fastening of the plural bolts 10, deformation of the cylinder is<br>
prevented, by making the fastening force of the bolts 10 acting only in the axial<br>
direction of the cylinder 410 through the discharge cover 430, the bridging portion 412<br>
of the cylinder is supported by the axial support 243 in the axial direction, and ac-<br>
cordingly the cylinder 410 is fixed.<br>
[51]	In addition, in the present invention, an inner diameter of the axial support 243 of<br>
the front frame is greater than an outer diameter of the cylinder portion 411, when the<br>
cylinder 410 is combined with the front frame 240, assembly operation can be<br>
simplified.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
[52]	As described-above, in the cylinder supporting stricture of the reciprocating<br>
compressor in axordance with the present invention, when the cylinder for<br>
compressing gas is fixedly combined with the frame, by preventing deformation of the<br>
cylinder, the cylinder can maintain a set assembly size, and accordingly it is possible to<br>
prevent contact and abrasion between parts in operation and perform the operation<br>
smoothly. Therefore, life span of the parts can be extended, and reliability can be<br>
improved.<br>
[53]	In addition, by facilitating assembly operation of the cylinder, assembly pro-<br><br>
WO 2004/081378	8	PCT/KR2004/000508<br>
dictivity can be improved, by maintaining a firm assembly state, collision and noise<br>
among the parts can be prevented.<br><br>
