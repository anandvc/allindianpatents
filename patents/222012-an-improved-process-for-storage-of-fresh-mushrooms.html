				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for storage of fresh<br>
mushrooms. The present invention particularly relates to the extension of storage<br>
life of fresh button (Agaricus) and oyster (Pleurotus) mushrooms, the two largest<br>
varieties of mushrooms produced in the world. /<br>
Mushrooms in fresh form are highly perishable due to their high water<br>
content and fast rate of metabolism, involving active respiration. They tend to<br>
lose water content, turn brown and develop off-flavour. Not more than 24 h, they<br>
can be held in acceptable condition at room temperature. Mushrooms are<br>
consumed mainly for their characteristic biting texture and pleasant flavour. Any<br>
means of processing, to extend the storage life, alters one or both of these<br>
properties. In that way, there is an increasing awareness for consumption of the<br>
fresh produce, particularly in the international trade. India as an agricultural<br>
country, which can afford to produce significant quantities of mushrooms, if<br>
required to earn considerable foreign exchange by way of export and also to<br>
boost internal consumption, the need to extend storage life of fresh mushrooms<br>
is very vital.<br>
Reference may be made to the work of Maaker-J-de (1971)<br>
Champignoncultuur 15(6); 221-223 wherein, an extension of storage life by 41 h<br>
is recorded, when the mushrooms were stored in punnets covered with<br>
cellophane film.<br>
In another reference by Burton (1988) Mushroom Journal No. 183 ; 510<br>
wherein, a storage life of four days is observed for the mushrooms, when packed<br>
in punnets covered with a microporous film.<br>
Yet in another reference Saxena and Rai (1988) Mushroom Journal for the<br>
Tropics 8(1) ; 15-22 wherein, a storage life of 1, 2 and 4 days at 15, 10 and 5°C<br>
respectively are recorded for the fresh mushrooms.<br>
Yet in one more reference, Technical Bulletin No. 2, Post-harvest<br>
Technology of Mushrooms, (1990) NCMRT, Solan, page 7 wherein, an extension<br>
of storage life of the fresh mushrooms is achieved upto 4 days at 5°C in 100<br>
guage polyethylene bags.<br>
In all the above references cited, storage life of fresh mushrooms never<br>
exceeded 4 days, even at refrigerated temperature of 5°C. Such a short storage<br>
life limits the mushroom trade over distance, particularly from sites of production<br>
to sites of consumption, in the International trade, since only few countries have<br>
easy access to economic production of particular variety of mushrooms on<br>
commercial scales.<br>
In the present invention, the shelf life of fresh mushroom was extended by<br>
12-16 days based on the variety, by altering physical factors like storage<br>
temperature, packaging material — aeration, permeability to 02 and C02,<br>
package density and storage relatively humidity (RH) without the use of any chemical or preservative.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for storage of fresh mushrooms.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to achieve extended storage life of fresh mushrooms.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to avoid the use of any chemical during mushroom preservation, eventually to achieve "Organic Status" quality of the fresh produce stored.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the storage of fresh mushrooms, which comprises:<br>
(a)	storing the fresh mushrooms in polypropylene bags of 150 - 200 gauge with perforations (pinhole to 1 cm dia.) 1-8 numbers per bag of size 16x25 cm ;<br>
(b)	characterized in that cooling at a temperature ranging from 2 - 5°C and an RH ranging from 60 - 80%;<br>
( c)    providing aeration @ a average 5 - 10% to the storage container;<br>
(d)	testing the microbiological quality at a regular interval of every 2 days;<br>
(e)	obtaining a product with characteristic mushroom flavor, texture, microbiologically safe and shelf life of 12 to 16 days.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, two major varieties of the mushroom viz., Agaricus and Pleurotus were studied.<br><br>
In another embodiment, storage of fresh mushroom was undertaken under<br>
the micro-environment created by a combination of storage conditions.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention the film used is polypropylene with a<br>
preferred guage of 150-200, to condition CO2 to ~5%.<br>
In further embodiment of the invention safe microbiological count is 
CFU/g in case of Agaricus and 
The process entails the use of fresh mushrooms (Agaricus or Pleurotus)<br>
immediately after harvest and cleaning from the adhering substrate particles,<br>
after grading, packed in 150-200 gram quantities in 150-200 guage<br>
polypropylene bags (16x25 cm). The bags were earlier made with 1 cm<br>
perforations (8 No.) or pin hole according to mushroom variety required to be<br>
stored. The bags were sealed and arranged in foldable plastic crates (60x38x22<br>
cm with 5-10% aeration) in two layers. So packed mushrooms were stored at<br>
temperature from 0-8°C and RH 60-80%. At periodic intervals, the stored<br>
mushrooms were subjected to microbiological and sensorial analysis. Storage life<br>
of 12 and 16 days could be achieved for Agaricus and Pleurotus mushrooms<br>
respectively.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present<br>
invention and its use for storage of fresh mushrooms, and therefore should not<br>
be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE -1<br>
Fresh button (Agaricus bisporus) mushrooms immediately after harvest<br>
were cleaned and packed in 200 g quantities in each of 200 guage polypropylene<br>
bags (16x25 cm) with 8 perforations. The packs after arrangement in foldable<br>
plastic crates with 8% aeration, were stored at 2±1°C with a storage relative<br>
humidity conditioned to 80%. The mushroom quality was acceptable in terms of<br>
whiteness, texture and flavour, besides the safe microbiological quality upto 16<br>
days. Under the conditions of storage wherein the concentration of C02 was<br>
conditioned to be at about 5%, total bacterial count did not exceed the<br>
permissible limit of 7 log™ CFU/g.<br>
EXAMPLE - 2<br>
Fresh white oyster mushroom (Pleurotus florida) immediately after<br>
harvest, cleaning and trimming, were packed in 150 g quantities in each of<br>
150 guage polypropylene bags (16x25 cm) with single pin hole. The mushroom<br>
packs after arrangement in foldable plastic crates with 5% aeration were stored<br>
at 5±1°C with a storage RH conditioned to 60%. Till the end of 12 days, the<br>
stored mushrooms were acceptable when evaluated for sensorial and<br>
microbiological qualities.<br>
EXAMPLE - 3<br>
Fresh grey variety mushroom (Pleurotus sajor-caju) after harvest were<br>
cleaned and packed, holding the mushrooms under the conditions defined as in<br>
example 2. The mushrooms stored in acceptable condition for 12 days with safe<br>
microbiological quality.<br>
Mushrooms in fresh form due to high water activity (90% moisture<br>
content), richness in phenolics, phenoloxidases, lack of protective covering, are<br>
very delicate commodities to be retained, in acceptable condition for more than<br>
24 h. Their high respiratory rate and tendency to lose water content faster lead to<br>
fast perishability. Use of chemical/preservative likely to influence the colour,<br>
texture and mild flavor of the mushrooms. Accordingly, the present invention was<br>
targeted to lower the physical activity of the fresh mushrooms by retarding the<br>
process of senescence through a combination of physical factors in the<br>
immediate environment of the stored fresh mushrooms such as packaging<br>
material, its permeability, aeration (for O2/C02 concentrations), package density,<br>
storage temperature and finally the storage RH. Quantification of these<br>
composite factors evolved serve to retain the moisture, color, texture and flavor.<br>
Further, assessing the microbiological quality of stored mushrooms also<br>
assumed equal importance, to define the safety for consumption. In the entire<br>
microbiological work, sterilization is achieved by autoclaving different growth and<br>
plating media, glasswares and other solutions for 20 min at 121°C.<br>
Microbiological profile of the fresh mushrooms Agaricus and Pleurotus were<br>
studied both at initial (soon after harvest) and during storage :<br>
Sample of mushroom in 11 g quantity was added to 99 ml of sterile 0.85%<br>
saline to get an initial 10~1 dilution. From this initial sample dilution, subsequent<br>
serial dilutions were prepared in 9 ml amounts of sterile 0.85% saline. Aliquots of<br>
appropriate sample dilutions in 1ml were pour plated with conventional nutrient<br>
medium such as Plate count agar (PCA), Me Conkey agar (MCA) and Potato<br>
dextrose agar (PDA). Poured plates of PCA, MCA and PDA were incubated at<br>
37°C for 48h. Characteristic colonies of the specific bacterial species appearing<br>
in the incubated plates were counted and expressed as colony forming units per<br>
gram (CFU/g). Likewise, yeasts and moulds were also counted in the incubated<br>
PDA plates. The isolated bacterial isolates were characterized based on Gram's<br>
reaction, cell morphology, spore forming nature and motility, and biochemical<br>
tests. Likewise, characterization of the fungal flora was done conventionally,<br>
based on morphology and spore characteristics.<br>
The predominant food borne pathogenic bacterial species viz.,<br>
Eschehchia coll, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus, were absent in<br>
both the types of mushroom samples, indicating the microbial safety. However,<br>
Bacillus staerothermophilus, and Pseudomonas aeroginosa were the major nonpathogenic<br>
bacteria identified (on the mushroom samples), which are the<br>
constituents of a natural habitat ; the CPU were within the permissible limit of<br>
7 logic CFU/g.<br>
The novelty of the invention is as follows :<br>
Loss of moisture is not recorded here, unlike any other reference and<br>
despite the long storage life achieved, the stored mushrooms proved<br>
microbiologically safe, essentially due to conditioning of CO2 ~ 5%.<br>
However, in no reference a storage life as long as 12 or 16 days is<br>
achieved. In every reference, there is a loss of moisture of the mushroom to<br>
various degrees. Methods enunciated on the Controlled Atmosphere Storage of<br>
fresh mushrooms can not be practical, because of the high costs and<br>
requirement for the sophisticated equipment. The present invention<br>
encompasses to overcome these adverse features and more importantly serves<br>
to enhance the storage life of fresh mushrooms, two folds compared to the works<br>
reported till now in the world. The storage life is defined based on the data of<br>
microbiological safety and consumers' acceptability.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are :<br>
1. Extension of storage life of fresh mushrooms.<br>
2. No chemical is used in the process.<br>
3. Simple and adoptable process.<br>
4. The process does not involve the use of sophisticated<br>
equipments/instruments.<br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br><br><br>
1.       A process for the storage of fresh mushrooms, which comprises:<br>
(a)	storing the fresh mushrooms in polypropylene bags of 150 - 200 gauge with perforations (pinhole to 1 cm dia.) 1-8 numbers per bag of size 16x25 cm ;<br>
