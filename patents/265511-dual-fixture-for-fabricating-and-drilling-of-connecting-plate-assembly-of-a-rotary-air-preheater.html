				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to fabrication and drilling of connecting plate assembly<br>
(CPA) for rotary regenerative air preheaters (APH) in general and to a fixture for<br>
fabricating and drilling the connecting plate assembly in shop floor in particular.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A rotary regenerative air preheater is a boiler auxiliary used in power plants.<br>
The Regenerative Air Preheater absorbs waste heat from flue gas, and then<br>
transfers this heat to incoming cold air by means of continuously rotating heat<br>
transfer elements of specially formed metal plates through air and gas streams.<br>
Air preheater mainly consists of rotor assembly connected to central rotor post<br>
with support &amp; guide bearings, octagonal shaped rotor housing connected to<br>
connecting plate assemblies at both the ends, sealing and drive arrangement.<br>
The housing surrounding the rotor is provided with bolting connections at both<br>
the ends and is adequately sealed by radial and axial sealing members forming<br>
an air passage through one half of the preheater and the gas passage through<br>
the other. As the rotor slowly revolves the mass of the elements alternatively<br>
pass through the air and gas passages, heat is absorbed by the element surfaces<br>
passing through the hot gas stream, then as the same surfaces are carried<br>
through the air steam, they release the stored up heat thus increasing the<br>
temperature of the incoming combustion or process air.<br><br>
Connecting plate assemblies (CPA) are used to house both ends of on<br>
rotorhousing. This consists of a main center section, primary center section,<br>
corner and center ducts with channel and pipe bracings. Based on the<br>
engineering requirement this CPA will be of BI-SECTOR or TRI-SECTOR. In Bi<br>
Sector design air side and gas side duct connections will be there, but in case of<br>
tri-sector air slide will have primary center section, which will form a separate<br>
duct connections for primary air and secondary air. These ducts connections are<br>
independent of each other but located primarily with respect to APH center.<br>
The CPA has octagonal flanged holes at one end to connect rotor-housing panels<br>
and at the other end rectangular flanged holes to connect gas side and air side<br>
ducts. Fixtures are needed for the manufacture of the CPA on the shop floor. The<br>
size of an APH depends on the rating of the boiler of which the APH would form<br>
an auxiliary. Therefore there are many sizes of APH and consequently, the CPA<br>
sizes are also several. SO, depending upon the requirement of APH different<br>
sizes of CPA are to be fabricated.<br>
In the prior art every CPA must be fabricated with the help of a octagonal fixture<br>
formed by rolled beams lying on the leveled fitter's bar, which is dimensioned to<br>
suit the fabricational requirement of the particular size of the CPA (Refer Figure-<br>
A). The fixture beams (2) are placed on the grouted and leveled fitter's bars (1)<br>
and firmly secured by clamp (3) with T-bolt (4) &amp; nut (5) on the preset layout of<br>
required APH size.<br>
Trial assemblies of CPA made on this octagonal fixture (1) (Refer Figure-B), over<br>
which the bottom flanges are laid and the rotor-housing panels bolting holes are<br>
marked and drilled with respect to APH center. The Center section (7), corner<br>
and center ducts (8) are built over this bottom flanges in stages with the split<br>
assemblies (9) at both the ends of each components with unique match marks,<br>
which will aid the reassembly at site to form the full assembly of CPA as made in<br><br>
shop. After completion of entire assembly, the top duct flange holes are marked<br>
and drilled with respect to APH center (2). That is, fabrication and drilling of both<br>
top and bottom flange holes are done taking the APH center (2) as prime<br>
reference.<br>
In the prior art, the CPA is made as full assembly once at a time, which consists<br>
of GAS SIDE and AIR SIDE (PRIMARY AIR SIDE/SECONDARY AIR SIDE) as per<br>
the assembly drawing. After confirming all the design/Quality requirements the<br>
assembly is dismantled and each component of the assembly is taken up for<br>
further manufacturing process. Present practice needs a complete full fixture for<br>
the full assembly and larger floor space for higher size APH.<br>
In prior art both gas side and air side assemblies were fabricated by two<br>
separate groups and progress simultaneously in which, the air side (in case of tri<br>
sector) will take extra cycle time, because of assembly complexity. This trial<br>
assembly process needs full time crane availability for the fitting of ducts and<br>
bracings. Because of the CPA size constraints, this crane facility shall be made<br>
available for only one group at a time and this leads to idling of another group.<br>
Further if we complete the entire assembly once at a time and dismantle, the<br>
components are ready for further manufacturing process and occupy the floor<br>
space at once.<br>
The present invention of half assembly on dual fixture seeks to overcome some<br>
of the major shortcomings of the prior art described above.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It: is therefore, an object of the invention to propose a dual fixture which<br>
eliminates the disadvantages of prior art.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a dual fixture which reduces the<br>
c/cle time and human resource for an assembly of a connecting plate.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to propose a dual fixture for assembling<br>
large size connecting plate in available shop floor area.<br>
A further object of the invention is to propose a dual fixture which allows more<br>
number of fixtures for use with available floor space.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a dual fixture for fabricating and drilling a<br>
connecting plate assembly (CPA) of an air preheater (APH). Fixture is needed for<br>
the manufacture of the CPA on the shop floor. In the present invention, the dual<br>
fixture is adapted to fabricate and drill the air side CPA and gas side CPA<br>
separately in two stages. This saves cycle time, manhours and shop floor spaces.<br>
The fixture is formed by rolled beams which has a U shaped structure. Rolled<br>
beams are put over the leveled fitter's bar which is dimensioned to suit the<br>
requirement of the particular size of the CPA. The fixture beams are placed on<br>
the grouted and leveled fitter's bars and firmly secured by clamp, T-bolt and nut<br>
on the preset layout of required air preheater size.<br>
By this invention, it proposes to manufacture air side and gas side of CPA in two<br>
stages over the above dual fixture. In the first stage CPA air side is fabricated<br><br>
and bottom flanges for center section and air side is laid over the dual fixture<br>
and drilling of housing panel bolting holes is carried out with respect to APH<br>
center. Then the center section is mounted with respect to APH center and<br>
alignment is ensured. The ducts and bracing for air side alone are then<br>
assembled and welded. Next top flange holes are marked and drilled with<br>
reference to APH center. After inspecting the quality requirement the assembly is<br>
dismantled. In second stage, CPA gas side is fabricated and bottom flanges for<br>
gas side is laid over the dual fixture and drilling of housing panel bolting holes<br>
are carried out with reference to APH center. Then the center section is rotated<br>
by 180 degrees and alignment is ensured. The ducts and bracings for gas side<br>
are assembled and welded and then top flange holes are marked and drilled with<br>
reference to APH center. Thus the CPA assembly is made in two stages on the<br>
same fixture by keeping the same center section and APH center as prime<br>
reference.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
This present invention describes manufacture of connecting plate assembly<br>
(CPA) in which air side and gas side are manufactured in two stages over a dual<br>
fixture (C) which can accommodate center section and one side of CPA at a time.<br>
This dual fixture (C) is arranged by laying the fixture beams (2) for center<br>
section and one side of CPA on the preset layout of required APH size marked on<br>
the grouted fitter's bar (1) and firmly secured by clamp (3) with T-bolt (4) &amp; nut<br>
(5).<br>
By this invention, it proposes to manufacture air side and gas side in two stages<br>
over the above dual fixture (6). In stage-I (Refer Fig-D) CPA air side is fabricated<br>
and bottom flanges for center section and air side alone is laid over the dual<br>
fixture and drilling of housing panel bolting holes is done with respect to APH<br>
center (6). Center section (7) is mounted with respect to APH centre (6) and<br>
alignment is done. The ducts &amp; bracings (8) for AIR SIDE alone are assembled<br>
and welded. Top flange holes are marked and drilled with respect to APH center<br>
(6). After confirming all the design/Quality requirements the assembly is<br>
dismantled. Then in stage II (Refer Fig-E) CPA (E) gas side is fabricated and<br>
bottom flanges for gas side alone is laid over the dual fixture (C) and drilling of<br>
housing panel bolting is done with respect to APH center (6). Then the center<br>
section (7) is rotated by 180° degrees and alignment is done. The ducts &amp;<br>
bracings (8) for GAS SIDE alone are assembled and welded. Top flange holes are<br>
marked and drilled with respect to APH center (6).<br>
To manufacture the CPA in accordance with the invention, the CPA assembly is<br>
made in two stages on the same fixture by keeping the same centre section (7)<br>
and the APH centre (6) as prime reference.<br><br>
In the prior art, the CPA was made as a single assembly and a labour-intensive<br>
and time-consuming procedure of laying a full fixture, waiting for handling<br>
cranes, occupying large floor space etc. This feature of the present invention<br>
results in saving of considerable manpower and time, which directly leads to cost<br>
saving and cycle time reduction. The fixture in accordance with the invention has<br>
the following has the following main advantages over the prior art.<br>
1.	Fabrication time for a full mixture is reduced very appreciably for new dual<br>
fixture according to the invention.<br>
2.	As the fixture is laid for one half the CPA, larger size CPA may be<br>
accommodated in available shop floor.<br>
3.	The fixture according to the invention eliminates full fixture resulting in<br>
material saving.<br>
4.	No. of fixtures can be increased with the available floor space.<br>
5.	Storage of Fixture beams take up less storage area.<br>
6.	The shop-floor area can be made available for some other job, since<br>
fixture occupies less space.<br><br>
