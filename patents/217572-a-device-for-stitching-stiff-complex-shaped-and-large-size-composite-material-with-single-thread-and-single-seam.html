				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a device for stitching stiff, complex shaped and large size composite material with single thread and single seam. The present invention particularly relates to a dual needles stitching device capable of providing single seam with single thread.<br>
The main usage of device of the present invention is to stitch semi-cured components of carbon or glass pre-preg, glass fibre reinforced plastics (GFRP) materials. These materials are stiff, complex in shape when laid on a shape retaining mould/support table. The position of the materials to be stitched, as placed on the shape retaining mould/support table denies the access from the bottom of the material.<br>
The commercially available conventional industrial stitching machines normally has single needle with single thread and need access from both-sides of the material. These conventional industrial stitching machines are suitable for stitching fabrics. The said machines are unsuitable for stitching stiff, complex shaped and large size composite materials.<br>
In figure 1, of the drawings accompanying this specification is shown the prior art of yarn pattern of conventional chain stitch method which requires access from both sides of the material.<br>
Reference may be made to the literature titled: Damage Tolerance of Stitched Carbon Expoxy Laminate, by Fritz Larsson, Defence Research Establishment. Materials Department, SE-172 90 Stockholm, Sweden, Revised 2 December 1996; accepted 22 May 1997. This machine has a single needle with thread capable of providing single seam stitching of dry pre-form with requirement of access from both sides.<br><br>
Prior art literature survey reveals a device with two needles, single thread capable of providing double seam stitch. Reference may be made to Journal of Textile and Apparel, Technology and Management, volume 2, issue 1, Fall 2001-ALTIN Naehtechnik, Germany, article titled: Recent Development in Robotic Stitching Technology for Textile Structural Composites. They have developed a stitching machine, where 3-dimensional preforms can be produced by application of two needles, single thread capable of producing two seams. In figure 2 of the drawings is shown the yarn pattern of ALTIN Naechtechnik machine, which produces a double seam. The drawbacks of this machine are:<br>
1.	It makes double seam, which is not desirable, as it may bring about increase<br>
in weight without enhancing the holding strength.<br>
2.	The needles being positioned in transverse plane to the seam direction's<br>
prohibits stitching in vicinity of stiffener/blade or any projection lying on the<br>
base material.<br>
3.	It requires wide gap on the support table for needle clearance, which deforms<br>
the shape of the material.<br>
4.	This device is incapable of providing single seam stitching.<br>
5.	The device is meant for stitching dry preforms that is flexible materials,<br>
without shape retention.<br>
From the hitherto known prior art devices covering industrial stitching machines and special purpose stitching machine as detailed above, it is clear that there is no device / machine available for providing single seam stitching of stiff, complex shaped, large size composite materials with shape retention.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a device for stitching stiff, complex shaped and large size composite material with single thread and single-seam, which obviates the drawbacks as referred above.<br><br>
Another object of present invention is to provide a device capable of chain stitching with single seam.<br>
Yet another object of present invention is to provide a device having a dual-needle single thread.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a device capable of stitching on 3-D contour surface of cardboard, rubberized components and preform of composite materials.<br>
Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a device wherein access required is from one side.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a device which can also be used for tufting the composite materials.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to provide a device having a -â€¢ stitching head with a thread-needle capable of protecting thread from shearing-and deposition of foreign materials.<br>
A still yet further object of the present invention is to provide a device having a stitching head capable of reciprocating movement with uniform velocity.<br>
In the present invention there is provided a device for stitching stiff, complex^ shaped and large size composite material with single thread and single seam. The device of the present invention is a dual needle stitching head consisting of~ thread-needle    and    hook-needle   capable   of   providing    uniform    velocity reciprocating motion to enable single seam and single thread chain stitch. It also features thread release and regulating mechanism, thread cutting mechanism, thread holding mechanism and footrest and footrest controller. Stitching head is a computer-controlled unit with provision for mounting on a four-degree freedom<br><br>
computer numerically controlled bed. Hence, the device of the present invention consists of two main sub-systems, namely computer numerically controlled (CNC) bed having four degrees of freedom (3 linear and one rotation) and computer controlled dual needle stitching head. Both sub-systems when integrated forms the device of the present invention.<br>
In the drawings accompanying this specification, figure 3 depicts the pictorial view of the device of the present invention, wherein 'MB' is    the four degree* freedom (3 linear and one rotation), computer numerically controlled machine bed and 'SH' is the computer controlled dual needle stitch head of the device of the present invention.<br>
In figure 4 of the drawings is shown parts of stitching head as depicted by 'SH' in-figure 3. The various parts shown in figure 4 are:<br>
'GM': Geared motor capable of actuating needles.<br>
TS': Twin shaft mechanism for translating motor shaft rotation to twin shaft rotation.<br>
TN': Hollow thread-needle. 'HIM': Hook-needle.<br>
TNACT: Mechanism to actuate the thread-needle (TN) consisting of globoidal cam-followers duly supported and capable of providing uniform velocity reciprocating motion to the thread-needle.<br>
'HNACT: Mechanism to actuate the hook-needle (HN) consisting of globoidal cam-followers duly supported and cappele of providing uniform velocity reciprocating motion to the hook-needle.<br><br>
'GDTN': Actuating link for thread-needle.<br>
'GDHN1: Actuating link for hook-needle.<br>
'REG': Thread release and regulating mechanism.<br>
'FR': Footrest to keep material in position and support thread cutting and thread holding systems.<br>
'SL': Footrest movement controller such as solenoid actuator.<br>
in figure 5 of the drawings is shown the steps of chain stitch method to make one stitch. A chain stitch method for stitching stiff and complex shaped large size composite materials has mainly six steps to form a stitch and repetition of these steps perform chain of stitch with single seam with single thread. Figure 5(a) shows thread-needle and hook-needle positioned above the materiai.<br>
Figure 5(b) shows thread-needle penetrating in the material and reaching its lower limit. Hook-needle with lag in time follows the thread- needle.<br>
Figure 5(c) shows the thread-needle starting to retract and form a loop. Due to lag in time, hook-needle passes through loop and intersects the thread-needle and reaching its bottom limit before it starts retracting.<br>
Figure 5(d) shows the thread of thread-needle is pulled by 'REG' mechanism (not shown in this figure). This action makes thread loop tight around the hook-needle. This tight thread loop seated in the slot of the hook-needle and loop is pulled above the top surface of material.<br>
Figure 5(e) shows the required length of the loop has formed on the top surface, loop is disengaged from the slot of the hook-needle. Loop is pushed in forward<br><br>
direction and held in position by a flap (not shown in this figure). Now thread-needle and hook-needle are moved forward by desired stitch pitch length.<br>
Figure 5(f) shows the thread-needle reach its top most limit and starting descend and passing through the loop left on the top surface of material.<br>
In this manner first stitch is completed and repeating above-mentioned steps forms a chain of stitch. The above activity of producing a single seam chain stitch is accomplished from the topside of the material.<br>
Figure 6 shows the yarn pattern produced by the device of present invention following the chain stitch method with single line seam and single thread as detailed in figure 5 of the drawings.<br>
The present invention provides a device for stitching stiff, complex shaped and large size composite material with single thread and single seam, which features a computer numerically controlled bed of four degrees of freedom (3 linear and one rotation) and a computer controlled dual needle stitching head capable of providing chain stitch to form a single seam with single thread using a thread-needle and a hook-needle with syncronised movements and also features a mechanism for thread release and regulation, thread holding and thread cutting.<br>
