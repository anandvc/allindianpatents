				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an adapter for use in replacing an old valve in a pressurized LPG cylinder.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
LPG Cylinders contain a valve that can be used for filling the LPG cylinder and withdrawal of gas from it. This valve is screwed into a threaded bung welded to the cylinder.<br>
These valves are regularly checked for leakage in the filling plant. Any valve found leaking has to be replaced before the cylinder is safe for use by the customer.<br>
Modern techniques of replacement involve replacing the valve without first emptying the cylinder. This replacement procedure is complex and requires very careful alignment of the cylinder with the valve change machine in order to avoid difficulties during screwing in a new valve into the bung.<br>
The valve change operation on a pressurized cylinder can be described as follows. The valve change machine has a sealing bell enclosure that is lowered and clamped firmly onto the top of the cylinder affecting a gas tight seal around the bung and valve.<br>
A shaft with a socket adapted to the valve is then lowered through the ball onto the valve and rotated to unscrew the valve. The shaft is then raised out the bell carrying the valve with it. The purpose of the sealing bell is to prevent the gas in the now open cylinder from escaping to the atmosphere.<br>
The old valve in the socket is then replaced by a new one and the shaft, socket and valve are lowered back into the sealing bell until they reached the bung. The shaft is then rotated to screw in the new valve into the cylinder. Once the new valve is screwed in the sealing bell can be lifted and the cylinder removed from the machine.<br><br>
D.uring this entire change operation, the most difficult stage is at the time of screwing in a new valve. If the cylinder is not precisely aligned with the shaft the new valve will not be able to engage the thread on the bung. This difficulty is greatly increased due to the fact that the bung area cannot be seen by the operator since it is covered by the sealing bell. The sealing bell cannot be lifted from the cylinder in order to align it to the valve since then the gas in the cylinder will gush out to the atmosphere.<br>
In order to prevent this problem, accurate alignment of the cylinder to the valve change machine is necessary before the bell is lowered onto the cylinder. Alignment of the cylinder is difficult because valve change is most often performed on old, roughly used cylinders, which suffer from various kinds of denting &amp; damage to the body or support ring of the cylinder. In practice it is seen that some degree of residual misalignment cannot be prevented.<br>
Object and summary of the invention<br>
The object of this invention is to overcome the above drawbacks by providing an adapter for guiding a new LPG valve into the threaded bung on the LPG Cylinder, particularly for use with a machine that can change the old valve while the cylinder is pressurized.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a guiding adapter having a shape conducive to guiding the valve into the bung of the LPG cylinder even in a misaligned condition.<br>
To achieve the said objectives the present invention provides an adapter for use in<br>
(X)    J replacing an old valve of a pressurized LPG cylinder with a new valve comprising: <br>
	-     a metal ring with a hole in the center larger than the hexagonal portion of<br>
the valve,<br>
-	lower edge of the ring extended into a skirt to fit around bung of the<br>
cylinder to align the hole in the ring with the bung,<br>
characterized in that:<br>
-	top face of the ring is provided with two tapers, one taper slopes down<br>
outwardly and the other taper slopes down inwardly for guiding the new<br>
valve into the bung, and<br><br>
-     bottom face of the ring having magnets embedded on it to hold the ring in place on the bung.<br>
The said ring is made of spark resistant alloy.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows a sectional view of the valve and bung of a known LPG cylinder.<br>
Figures 2 a and 2 b show a cross sectional and a three dimensional view of the adapter respectively according to this invention.<br>
Figure 3 shows a sectional view of the adapter placed on the bung according to this invention.<br>
Figure 4 shows a sectional view of a known sealing bell and shaft &amp; socket lowering onto a cylinder which has the adapter on it.<br>
Figure 5 shows a sectional view the valve being guided towards the bung by the adapter.<br>
Detailed description of the accompanying drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows an LPG valve screwed into the bung of the cylinder. The valve has a hexagonal portion of the valve (30) which is used to apply torque to engage and tighten the valve into the bung (10).<br>
As shown in Figures 2a and 2b, the adapter (1) is a metal ring with a hole (2) in the center which is slightly larger than the hexagonal portion of the valve. The metal ring is made of a spark resistant alloy. The lower edge of the adapter is extended into a skirt (3) sized to fit around bung of the cylinder. This aligns hole (2) in the adapter with the hole in the bung. The bottom face (6) of the adapter has small magnets (7) embedded on it for holding the adapter onto the bung.<br><br>
The top- face of the adapter is formed into two tapers. The taper (4) slopes down and outwards for assisting in aligning the cylinder while, the taper (5) slopes down and inwards for guiding the valve into the bung.<br>
Figure 3 shows the adapter (1) mounted on the bung (10) of an LPG Cylinder. In this position the skirt (3) of the adapter is around the outer diameter (11) of the bung and the magnets (7) in the adapter hold it to the top face (13) of the bung. The combined effect of these is to align the hole (2) in the adapter concentrically with the hole (12) in the bung.<br>
Figure 4 shows the sealing bell (100) of a valve change machine in the action of lowering onto a misaligned cylinder which has the adapter mounted on it.<br>
The action of the taper (4) on the adapter is to shift the cylinder into better alignment with the sealing bell in those cases when the cylinder is grossly misaligned. This is achieved by engaging the rounded inside edge (110) of the sealing bell. The combined action of the down movement of the sealing bell and this contact between edge (110) in the sealing bell and the taper (4) on the adapter is to urge the cylinder into partial alignment with axis of the sealing bell. However complete alignment cannot be achieved by the action of taper (4) alone.<br>
The downward movement of the sealing bell continues until the seal (111) on the bell contacts the dome (20) of the cylinder and creates a gas tight seal around the bung.<br>
The shaft (120) and socket (130) lower further and engage the hexagonal portion of the valve (30). The valve is then unscrewed from the cylinder and lifted out of the bell.<br>
Figure 5 shows the shaft (120) lowering onto the cylinder with a new valve in the socket. In this case, the remaining misalignment causes the edge (141) of the valve to bear against taper (5) on the adapter.<br>
The downward movement of the valve and the action of the taper (5) causes the valve to be guided into the hole (12) of the bung. The socket (130) is mounted loosely in the shaft (120) so that it can deflect to follow the valve. Once the valve reaches concentricity with<br><br>
the bung hole (12) the threads (142) on the valve engage the threads in the bung hole and the valve can be successfully screwed into the bung.<br>
After successful valve replacement, the bell can be lifted and the adapter removed from the bung ready for reuse on a new cylinder. The strength of the magnets (7) is selected such that the adapter can be removed manually without requiring excessive force.<br><br><br><br><br>
We claim<br>
1.	An adapter for use in replacing an old valve of a pressurized LPG cylinder with a<br>
                  new valve wherein the adapter is <br>
	-     a metal ring with a hole in the center larger than the hexagonal portion of<br>
the valve,		<br><br>
-	lower edge of the ring extended into a skirt to fit around bung of the	<br>
cylinder to align the hole in the ring with the bung,	<br>
characterized in that:		<br>
-	top face of the ring is provided with two tapers, one taper slopes down<br>
outwardly and the other taper slopes down inwardly for guiding the new<br><br>
valve into the bung, and<br>
-	bottom face of the ring having magnets embedded on it to hold the ring<br>
in place on the bung.<br>
2.	The adapter as claimed in claim 1, wherein the ring is made of spark resistant alloy.<br>
3.	An adapter for use in replacing an old valve of a pressurized LPG cylinder with a<br>
new valve substantially as herein described with reference to and as illustrated in<br>
the accompanying drawings.<br></td>
