DEACETYLASE INHIBITORS<br>
The present invention relates to hydroxamate compounds which are inhibitors of histone deacetylase. The inventive compounds are useful as pharmaceuticals for the treatment of proliferative diseases.<br>
Background<br>
Reversible acetylation of histones is a major regulator of gene expression that acts by altering accessibility of transcription factors to DNA. In normal cells, histone deacetylase (HDA) and histone acetyltrasferase together control the level of acetylation of histones to maintain a balance. Inhibition of HDA results in the accumulation of hyperacetylated histones, which results in a variety of cellular responses.<br>
Inhibitors of HDA have been studied for their therapeutic effects on cancer cells. For example, butyric acid and its derivatives, including sodium phenylbutyrate, have been reported to induce apoptosis in vitro in human colon carcinoma, leukemia and retinoblastoma cell lines. However, butyric acid and its derivatives are not useful phamnacological agents because they tend to be metabolized rapidly and have a very short half-life in vivo. Other inhibitors of HDA that have been widely studied for their anti-cancer activities are trichostatin A and trapoxin.  Trichostatin A is an antifungal and antibiotic and is a reversible inhibitor of mammalian HDA. Trapoxin is a cyclic tetrapeptide, which is an irreversible inhibitor of mammalian HDA. Although trichostatin and trapoxin have been studied for their anti-cancer activities, the in vivo instability of the compounds makes them less suitable as anti-cancer dnjgs. There remains a need for an active compound that is suitable for treating tumors, including cancerous tumors, that is highly efficacious and stable.<br>
Summary<br>
The present invention provides efficacious deacetylase inhibitor compounds that are useful as pharmaceutical agents having the formula I<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
Ri is H, halo, or a straight chain C1-C6 alkyl (especially methyl, ethyl or n-propyl, which methyl, ethyl and n-propyl substituents are unsubstituted or substituted by one or more substituents described below for alkyl substituents);<br><br><br><br>

The hydroxamate compounds of the present invention can be produced by known organic synthesis methods. For example, the hydroxamate compounds can be produced<br><br>
by reacting methyl 4-formyl cinnamate with tryptamine and then converting the reactant to the hydroxamate compounds. As an example, methyl 4-formyl cinnamate 2, is prepared by acid catalyzed esterification of 4-formylcinnamic acid 3 (Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1995; 68:2355-2362). An altemate preparation of methyl 4-formyl cinnamate 2 is by a Pd-catalyzed coupling of methyl acrylate 4 with 4-bromobenzaldehyde 5.<br><br>
Additional starting materials can be prepared from 4-carboxybenzaldehyde 6, and an exemplary method is illustrated for the preparation of aldehyde 9. shown below. The carboxylic acid in 4-carboxybenzaldehyde 6 can be protected as a silyl ester (e.g., the f-butyldimethylsilyl ester) by treatment with a silyl chloride (e.g., f-butyldimethylsilyl chloride) and a base (e.g. triethylamine) in an appropriate solvent (e.g., dichloromethane). The resulting silyl ester 7 can undergo an olefination reaction (e.g., a Horner-Emmons olefination) with a phosphonate ester (e.g., triethyl 2-phosphonopropionate) in the presence of a base (e.g., sodium hydride) In an appropriate solvent (e.g., tetrahydrofuran (THF)). Treatment of the resulting diester with acid (e.g., aqueous hydrochloric acid) results in the hydrolysis of the silyl ester providing acid 8. Selective reduction of the carboxylic acid of 8 using, for example, borane-dimethylsuflide complex in a solvent (e.g., THF) provides an intermediate alcohol. This intermediate alcohol could be oxidized to aldehyde 9 by a number of known methods, including, but not limited to, Swern oxidation, Dess-Martin periodinane oxidation, Moffatt oxidation and the like.<br><br><br>
The aldehyde starting materials 2 or 9 can be reductively aminated to provide secondary or tertiary amines. This is illustrated by the reaction of methyl 4-formyl cinnamate 2 with tryptamine 10 using sodium triacetoxyborohydride (NaBH(0Ac)3) as the reducing agent in dichloroethane (DCE) as solvent to provide amine 11. Other reducing agents can be used, e.g.. sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN), in other solvents or solvent mixtures in the presence or absence of acid catalysts (e.g., acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid). Amine 11 can be converted directly to hydroxamic acid 12 by treatment with 50% aqueous hydroxylamine in a suitable solvent (e.g., THF in the presence of a base, e.g., NaOH). Other methods of hydroxamate fomiation are known and include reaction of an ester with hydroxylamine hydrochloride and a base (e.g., sodium hydroxide or sodium methoxide) in a suitable solvent or solvent mixture (e.g., methanol, ethanol or methanol/THF).<br><br>
Aldehyde 2 can be reductively aminated with a variety of amines, exemplified by, but not limited to. those illustrated in Table 1. The resulting esters can be converted to target hydroxamates by the methods listed.<br>

An alternate synthesis of the compounds of this invention starts by reductive amination of 4-formyl cinnamic acid 3, illustrated below with 3-phenylpropylamine 13, using, for example, NaBHgCN as the reducing agent in MeOH and HOAc as a catalyst. The basic nitrogen of the resulting amino acid 14 can be protected, for example, as f-butoxycarbamate (BOC) by reaction with di--t- butyldicarbonate to give 15.<br><br><br>
The carboxylic acid can be coupled with a protected hydroxylamine (e.g., Otrityl hydroxylamine) using a dehydrating agent (e.g., 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI)) and a catalyst (e.g., 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (HOBT)) in a suitable solvent (e.g., DMF) to produce 16. Treatment of 16 with a strong acid (e.g., trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)) provides a hydroxamic acid 17 of the present invention. Additional examples of compounds that can be prepared by this method are:<br><br>
Tertiary amine compounds can be prepared by a number of methods. Reductive amination of 30 with nicotinaldehyde 32 using NaBHaCN as the reducing agent in dichloroethane and HOAc as a catalyst provides ester 34. Other reducing agents can be used (e.g., NaBH4 and NaBH(0Ac)3) in other solvents or solvent mixtures in the presence or absence of acid catalysts (e.g., acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid and the like). Reaction of ester 34 with HONH2.HCI. NaOH in MeOH provides hydroxamate 36.<br><br><br>
Tertiary amine compounds prepared by this methodology are exemplified, but not limited to, those listed in Table 2.<br><br>
An alternate method for preparing tertiary amines Is by reacting a secondary amine with an alkylating agent in a suitable solvent in the presence of a base. For example, heating a dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solution of amine 11 and bromide 40 in the presence of (j-Pr)2NEt yielded tertiary amine 42. Reaction of the tertiary amine 42 with HONH2.HCI, NaOH in MeOH provides hydroxamate 43. The silyl group can be removed by any method<br><br>
known to those skilled in the art. For example, the hydroxamate 43 can be treated with an acid, e.g., trifluoroacetic acid, or fluoride to produce hydroxyethyl compound 44.<br><br>

Example B1<br>
Cell lines H1299 (human lung carcinoma cell) and HCT116 (colon tumor cell) are obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD. The cell lines are free of Mycoplasma contamination (Rapid Detection System by Gen-Probe, Inc., San Diego, CA) and viral contamination (MAP testing by MA BioServices, Inc., Rockville, MD). The cell lines are propagated and expanded in RPM11640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Cell expansions for implantation are perfomied in cell factories (NUNC, purchased from Fisher Scientific, Springfield, NJ). Cells are harvested at 50-90% confluency, washed once with HBSS (Hank's Balanced Salt Solution) containing 10% FBS, and suspended in 100% HBSS.<br>
Cell proliferation is measured with a commercial MTS kit (Promega, Madision, Wis.) assay using an adaptation of published procedures, for example, that disclosed in Feasibility of drug screening with panels of human tumor cell lines using a microculture tetrazolium assay, Alley MC, et a!., Cancer Res. 1988; 48:589-601. Cells are plated in 96-well tissue culture dishes, with top and bottom rows left empty.  H1299 and HCT116 cells<br><br>
are suspended in complete media at a density of 5.3 x 103 and 3.6 x 10^ cell/mL, respectively, and 190 μl are added per well. Each cell line is added to one half of the plate. Complete medium (200 μL) is added to the top and bottom rows. Twenty-four hours later, 10 μl of MTS solution is added to one of the plates to determine the activity at the time of compound addition (To). The plate is incubated at 37oC for 4 hours and the OD490 is measured on a Molecular Devices Thermomax at 490 nm using the Softmax program. The To plate serves as a reference for initial activity at the beginning of the experiment.<br>
Five serial dilutions (1:4) of each compound are made in a 96-deep well plate with the highest concentrations on the edge of plate. Two cell lines are tested with two compounds per plate. Ten microliters of each of the five dilutions are added in triplicate and complete medium alone is added to columns six and seven. The plates are incubated at 37 °C for 72 hours. The MTS solution is added (as for the To plate) and read four hours later.<br>
In order to analyze the data, the average background value (media alone) is subtracted from each experimental well; the triplicate values are averaged for each compound dilution. The following formulas are used to calculate percent growth. If X &gt; To. % Growth = ((X-To)/(GC -To)) x 100 If X 
in which To = (average value of cell viability at time 0) - background GC = average value of untreated cells (in triplicate) - background X = average value of compound treated cells (in triplicate) - background The **% Growth- is plotted against compound concentration and used to calculate IC50S employing the linear regression techniques between data points to predict the concentration of compounds at 50% inhibition.<br>
Lactate salts of N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[[2-(1 H-indol-3-yl)-ethyl]-amino]methyl]phenyl]-2E-2-propenamide (CMD1), N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[(2-hydroxyethyl)[2-(1H-indol-3-yl)-ethyl]-amino]methyl]phenyl]-2E-2-propenamide (CMD2), N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[[2-(5-methoxy-1 H indol-3-yl)-ethyl]-amino]methyl]phenyl]-2E-2-propenamide(CMD3), N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[[2-(5-fluoro-1 H-indol-3-yl)-ethyl]-amino]methyl]phenyl]-2E-2-propenamide (CMD4), N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[[2-(benzofur-3-yl)-ethyl]-amino]methyl]phenyl]-2E-2-propenamide (CMD5) having a purity of higher than 95% are dissolved in pure dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to create a stock solution. The stock solution is diluted with 5% dextrose injection, USP, Just prior to dosing. In addition, N-(2-aminophenyl)-4-[N-pyridin-3-yl)methoxycarbonylaminomethyl]benzamide is synthesized in accordance with Example 48 of EP 0 847 992 and used as a control compound (CMDC). Inhibition of cell growth in monolayer for 72 hours of compound treatment is measured in<br><br>

The results show that the hydroxamate compounds of the present invention are highly active in inhibition of tumor cell growth. In addition to the above results, it has been observed that the compounds selectively inhibited tumor cells while showing minimal inhibition activities in non-tumorous cells.<br>
The cells treated with the hydroxamate compounds are also tested for the induction of p21 promoter, which is a key mediator of G1 arrest and differentiation. The hydroxamate compounds activate the p21 promoter to a readily detectable level at a concentration within two-fold of their respective IC50 for monolayer cell growth inhibition in H1299. Without being bound by any particular theory, the correlation appears to demonstrate that HDA inhibition leads to transcriptional activation of genes that inhibit tumor cell proliferation.<br>
Example B2<br>
HDA is partially purified from H1299, human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells (obtained from American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, MD 20852, USA). Cells are grown to 70-80% confluence in RPMI media in the presence of 10% FCS, harvested and lysed by sonication. The lysate is centrifuged at 23, 420g for 10-15 min, the supernatant is applied to a Hiload 26/10 High performance Q-sepharose column (Amersham Phamiacia Biotech), and equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris<br><br>
pH8.0,1 mM EDTA, 10 mM NH4CI2,1 mM p-Mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol. 2 μg/mL aprotinin, 1 μg/mL leupeptin, and 400 mM PMSF. Proteins are eluted in 4mL aliquotes with a linear gradient from 0-500 mM NaCI in the above buffer at a flow rate of 2.5 mL/min. Each preparation of partially purified HDA enzyme is titrated to determine the optimal amount needed to obtain a signal to noise ratio of at least 5 to 1. Generally, 20-30 μl of partially purified HDA (5-10 mg protein/mL) is mixed with 2 μL of compound solution in DMSO in a deep well titer plate (Beckman). The compounds are serially diluted in DMSO to generate stocks at 20-fold of the assay concentrations. Final concentrations of compounds in the assay are 10μM, 2μM, 400 nM, 80 nM, and 16 nM with the final percentage of DMSO in each enzyme reaction equaling 0.1%. Each concentration of compound is assayed in duplicate. The substrate used in the reaction is a peptide of amino acid sequence, SGRGKGGKGLGKGGAKRHRKVLRD, corresponding to the twenty-four N-terminal amino acids of human histone H4, biotinylated at the N-terminus and penta-acetylated, at each lysine residue with 3H-acetate. To Initiate the reaction, the substrate Is diluted in 10 jiL of Buffer A (100 mM Tris pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA). added to the enzyme mixture and collected at the bottom of the deep well plate by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 1500 rpm. Following centrifugation, the mixture is incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 hr. The reaction is stopped by the addition of 20 μL of the Stop Buffer (0.5N HCI, 0.08M Acetic Acid). At this point, the assay proceeds to the robotic extraction phase or is frozen for several days at -80 °C.<br>
The extraction of enzymatically cleaved 3H-acetate groups from the reaction mixture is achieved with the solvent TBME (t-butyl methyl ether) using the Tomtec Quadra 96 workstation. A program is written to add 200 μL of TBME to a 96 -deep well- plate. The workstation is programmed to aspirate 50 μL of air followed by 200 μL of TBME and finally another 25 pL of air, which is dispensed into the each well of the plate. The contents of the deep well were mixed thoroughly by pipetting 160 μL up and down 10 times. Before addition of TBME to the reaction mixture, it is necessary to -pre-wef the pipette tips with TBME to prevent the solvent from dripping during the transfer to the deep well plate. The organic and aqueous phases in the deep well are separated by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min. Opti-Phase Supermix liquid scintillation cocktail (200 μL) (Wallac) is added to each well of the 96-well Trilux plate (Wallac). The deep well and Trilux plates are placed back on the workstation programmed to aspirate 25 pL of air into the pipette tips followed by 100 pL of the upper TBME phase and transfer It Into the Trilux plate. The solutions are mixed by pipetting and expelling 50 pL, five times, within the same well. The Trilux plate is<br><br>
covered with clear film and read on a 1450 MicroBeta Trilux liquid scintillation and luminescence counter (Wallac) with a color/chemical quench and dpm correction.<br>
In order to determine the IC50 values, the data are analyzed on a spreadsheet. The analysis requires a correction for the background luminescence that is accomplished by subtracting the dpm values of wells without 3H substrate from the experimental wells. The corrected dpm values along with the concentrations of the compounds are used to calculate IC50 using the user-defined spline function. This function utilizes linear regression techniques between data points to calculate the concentration of compounds that produced 50% inhibition. The results are shown in Table B2.<br><br>

The A549 non-small cell lung human tumor cell line is purchased from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD. The cell line is free of Mycoplasma contamination (Rapid Detection System by Gen-Probe, Inc., San Diego, CA) and viral contamination (MAP testing by MA BioServices, Inc., Rockville, MD). The cell line is propagated and expanded in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated PBS (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Cell expansions for implantation are performed in cell factories (NUNC, purchased from Fisher Scientific, Springfield, NJ). Cells are harvested at 50-90% confluency, washed once with HBSS containing 10% PBS, and suspended in 100% HBSS.<br>
Outbred athymic (nu/nu) female mice (-Hsd:Athymic Nude-nu- from Marian Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) are anesthetized with Metofane (Mallinckrodt Veterinary, Inc.,<br><br>
Mundelein, IL), and 100 μL of the cell suspension containing 1x107 cells is injected subcutaneously into the right axillary (lateral) region of each animal. Tumors are allowed to grow for about 20 days until a volume of -100 mm3 is achieved. At this point, mice bearing tumors with acceptable morphology and size are sorted into groups of eight for the study. The sorting process produces groups balanced with respect to mean and range of tumor size. Antitumor activity is expressed as % T/C, comparing differences in tumor volumes for treatment group (T) to vehicle control group (C). Regressions are calculated using the formula: (1-T/To) x 100%. where T is the tumor volume for the treatment group at the end of the experiment, and To is the tumor volume at the beginning of the experiment.<br>
CMD1 is administered intravenously, once daily 5x/week for three weeks, at doses of 10, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg. The final DMSO concentration is 10%. Each test group has eight mice. Tumors are measured, and individual animal body weights recorded. Table B3 shows the results on the 41st day.<br><br>

The results are recorded on the 34th day and are shown in Table 85.<br>

Example B4 is repeated except the HCT116 colon tumor cell line is used in place of the A549 cell line. The HCT116 is also obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD. and the cell line is free of Mycoplasma contamination and viral contamination. The results are recorded on the 34*^ day and are shown in Table B6.<br><br>
Annexin V binding was used as a marker for the early stages of apoptosis. A549, HCT116 and Normal Demrial Human Fibroblasts (NDHF) cells are treated separately with four compounds (CMD1, CMD2, CMD3 and CMD4) for 24 or 48 hours, stained with annexin V and compared to cells treated similarly with vehicle (DMSO). Cells are examined by fluorescence microscopy. Those undergoing apoptosis exhibit green fluorescent membrane staining. Viability is assessed by the counterstain, propidium iodide. Cells detected by red fluorescence are not viable. A small percentage of A549 and the majority of HCT116 cells exhibit cell surface staining with annexin V after 24 hour exposure to each of the four compounds. After 48 hour treatment, the majority of the A549 and HCT116 stain with annexin V and/or propidium iodide indicating that the compounds induce apoptotic cell death. In contrast, NDHF cells do not show noticeable annexin V staining after 24 hour exposure and limited annexin V staining with CMD3 after 48 hour. These data show that<br><br>
NDHF cells predominantly underwent non-lethal growth arrest upon compound treatment, consistent with the cell cycle profile.<br>
The staining results demonstrate that the hydroxamate compounds of the present invention cause tumor cells to die by apoptosis, while causing normal fibroblast to predominantly undergo cell cycle arrest, clearly demonstrating the selective efficacy of the present compounds.<br><br><br><br><br>
