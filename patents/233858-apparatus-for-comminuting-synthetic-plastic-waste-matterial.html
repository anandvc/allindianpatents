				<td>Apparatus for Comminuting synthetic plastic waste material<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for comminuting waste of synthetic plastic<br>
material, comprising a housing in which at least one rotor is bearingly supported for<br>
rotation by a motor around a, preferably horizontal, axis, which rotor on its periphery is<br>
provided with comminuting tools, in particular knives, acting onto the supplied material,<br>
counter tools, in particular counter knives, being stationarily disposed within the housing<br>
which forms a supply shaft of great volume, the counter tools being assigned to the<br>
comminuting tools, and further comprising a supply means having a slide member<br>
pressing the material disposed within the supply shaft against the rotor.<br>
Comminuting apparatus are known in a plurality of embodiments, for example<br>
EP 605 382 B1. AT 398 712 B. Investigations of the applicants have shown that the<br>
comminuting effect or, respectively, the throughput is highly dependent from the position<br>
of the slide member relative to the rotor As soon as the slide member at its forward<br>
motion reaches a position relatively neighbouring the rotor, the comminuting effect is<br>
increased and remains at a high level until the entire material dammed up between rotor<br>
and slide member is worked up. When the slide member is retracted in order to bring<br>
fresh material to be comminuted in the area between rotor and slide member, the<br>
comminuting efficiency of the apparatus decreases considerably When the slide is again<br>
moved towards the rotor, the comminuting efficiency remains at a low level, as long as<br>
the distance between rotor and slide is still great. A high throughput of the apparatus is<br>
only then obtained when the slide has reached a comparatively low distance from the<br>
rotor An explanation for this is that the slide member in its position adjacent the rotor<br>
forms an intake gap for the material to be comminuted, which gap acts in the manner of a<br>
guide blade<br>
The described pulsating or varying throughput behaviour is already of<br>
disadvantage within a more comminuting machine, because the average throughput per<br>
time unit is low when compared with the maximum value. In particular of disadvantage are<br>
the said circumstances, however, within a plant for comminuting synthetic plastic material,<br>
in which an extruder immediately follows the comminuting apparatus, because due to the<br>
uneven throughput of the comminuting machine, also the extruder efficiency varies<br>
considerably, so that the final products obtained at the extruder exit, for example within a<br>
forming plant, become highly uneven<br>
The invention has at its object to avoid these disadvantages and to improve a<br>
comminuting apparatus of the initially described kind so that the throughput per time unit<br>
of the apparatus is substantially made more even. The invention solves this task in that<br>
the feed means comprises at least two slide members superimposed above each other<br>
and supplying the material to the rotor, which slide members are independently from each<br>
other moveable towards the rotor or away from it, whereby the front surface of the<br>
lowermost slide facing the rotor defines with the tangent to the enveloping circle of the<br>
comminuting tools carried by the rotor a substantially wedge-shaped intake gap for the<br>
material to be comminuted, which intake gap narrows to below up to its lower end. The<br>
upper slide member or the upper slide members of this system of a plurality of slide<br>
members acts or act as an additional supply means which supplies fresh material to be<br>
comminuted to the wedge-shaped intake gap between the rotor and the front end of the<br>
lower slide member. Surprisingly, tests have shown that by this simple measure a<br>
substantial improvement of the throughput behaviour of the apparatus can be obtained,<br>
assumeably by the fact that the below disposed narrower end of the wedge-shaped intake<br>
gap increases pressing the material to be comminuted to the rotor to below.<br>
It is known from DE 196 14 030 A1 to provide within a comminuting machine for<br>
tough scraps of synthetic plastic material a closure plate in the upper region of a supply<br>
slide member, which closure plate can be advanced by a separate drive means into an<br>
operation position covering the comminuting cylinder. However, thereby no additional<br>
material can still be supplied to the intake gap between rotor and slide member.<br>
From DE 199 16 800 A1 an apparatus for comminuting of preferably plastic<br>
masses, in particular of wet clay, has become known in which within the comminuting<br>
space a reciprocable slide is disposed in front of the rotor. Since the wet clay may dam up<br>
within an intake hopper leading to the comminuting space, for loosening this material<br>
above the slide a further reciprocable slide is provided. However, such a construction<br>
cannot meet the above mentioned problems occurring when synthetic plastic material<br>
waste is comminuted, mainly caused by the different shape of the gap existing between<br>
the rotor and the lower slide.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the slide members<br>
superimposed above each other are guided contacting each other in parallel by guide<br>
means which, if desired, are inclined with respect to the horizontal direction Slide<br>
members resting against each other facilitate construction of their guide means, because<br>
for example the lop surface of the respective lower slide member can act as the bottom<br>
surface for guiding the respective upper slide member. By an inclination of the slide<br>
member paths, which may reach nearly a vertical disposition, different shapes of the<br>
wedge-shaped intake gap between the rotor and the lower slide member can be obtained<br>
and, as a consequence thereof, different supply conditions for the material to be<br>
comminuted.<br>
Within the spirit of the invention, the slide members disposed above each other<br>
can be guided along guide means that are straight-lined or curved in the manner of an arc<br>
of a circle. Straight-lined guide means are of easier construction, however, as a rule, they<br>
show more special requirement in horizontal direction, which space is not always and<br>
everywhere unlimited at disposal. With this respect, slide members that are guided along<br>
an arc of a circle are more favourable.<br>
Within the spirit of the invention, the lower slide member or the lowermost slide<br>
member can be fixed in its position relative to the rotor. Thereby a constant intake gap is<br>
obtained during the operation between the rotor and the front wall of the slide member<br>
facing it, into which intake gap the material to be comminuted is supplied by the feed<br>
means comprising the upper slide member or the upper slide members. The intake gap<br>
constitutes a space for a sufficient pad of material that is sufficient in order to keep a<br>
substantially constant throughput operation of the apparatus also during the retracting<br>
movement of at least one upper slide member.<br>
Some of the synthetic plastic materials to be comminuted, in particular plastics<br>
materials to be recycled, act abrasively, in particular if the impurities contain grained solid<br>
material, for example sand or small stones. Therefore, the front surface of at least one<br>
lower slide member pressing the material to the rotor may be subjected to a high wear.<br>
Therefore, it is suitable within the invention, to form this front surface by an exchangeable<br>
end piece. This exchangeability can also enable one to provide different end pieces<br>
delimiting different intake gaps or, respectively, intake wedge angles with the rotor.<br>
Thereby, an adjustment to the particular kind of the material to be comminuted can be<br>
obtained.<br>
The said high stresses of the surface of a slide member facing the rotor has as a<br>
consequence that the front region of the slide member facing the rotor can highly heat up.<br>
Therefore, it is suitable to provide in this region of the slide member or, respectively, in its<br>
end piece channels for a cooling medium.<br>
For an adaptation to different materials to be comminuted, within the spirit of the<br>
invention the front surface of at least one slide member facing the rotor can have a<br>
structure acting on the material to be drawn in, in particular, grooves. These grooves can<br>
extend straight-lined, therefore, in direction of circulation of the comminuting tools, so that<br>
the material to be comminuted cannot escape sidewise. However, these grooves can also<br>
be disposed obliquely with respect to the said direction of circulation, so that already<br>
within the cutting space or, respectively, in the region between the rotor and the slide<br>
members, a component of motion of the material to be comminuted is created that is<br>
directed in axial direction of the rotor. This, can be made of use in order to obtain a<br>
material motion in a definite desired direction, for example away from the two front<br>
surfaces of the housing, therefore in direction towards the axial central region of the rotor,<br>
or in direction towards a front end of the rotor. The latter construction is in particular<br>
suitable if the material comminuted by the rotor should be supplied to an extruder that is<br>
connected in axial direction to the rotor.<br>
A particular favourable embodiment consists within the spirit of the invention in that<br>
at least one slide member is subdivided over the length of the rotor into a group of slides,<br>
the respective elements thereof, if desired, are driven to different movements relative to<br>
the rotor. Thereby, a pressure onto the material to be comminuted can be obtained that is<br>
different over the length of the rotor, what is of advantage. By a suitable program-control<br>
for the movements of the respective slide members, an adaptation to the quality of the<br>
respective material to be comminuted can be obtained.<br>
In the drawings, embodiments of the subject matter of the invention are<br>
schematically shown. Fig. 1 shows the apparatus in a vertical section. The Figs. 2 to 6<br>
each show a construction variant for the disposal or, respectively, construction of the slide<br>
members. Fig. 7 shows a detail in an axonometric view.<br>
Within the embodiment according to Fig. 1, the framework forms a housing 1 in<br>
which a cylinder-shaped rotor 2 is bearingly supported for rotation around its horizontal<br>
axis by moans of shaft ends 3 provided at its front ends. This rotor 2 is driven for rotation<br>
in direction of the arrow 4 by a motor, not shown, and carries on its periphery 5, partially<br>
embedded therein, a plurality of comminuting tools formed in the manner of knives 6.<br>
These knives act onto the material to be comminuted, which is synthetic plastic material<br>
that is fed through a supply well 7 of great volume formed by the housing 1 and suitably<br>
narrowing to below towards the rotor 2. Counter tools stationarily fixed within the housing<br>
are assigned to the knives 6 and are formed as counter knives 8. These counter knives 8<br>
may have cooled hollow spaces 9 to which a cooling medium, in particular cooling water,<br>
is supplied via lines 10. This cooling medium can be again conducted off the counter<br>
knives 8 and may be conducted in a closed circuit, however, the counter knives 8 may<br>
also be provided with nozzles 11 spraying the cooling medium onto the periphery 5 of the<br>
rotor 2, thereby cooling also the knives 6. The counter knives 8 can be inserted into rods<br>
12 of the housing, to which a sieve 13 can be fixed through which the comminuted<br>
material falls into a collecting chamber 15 confined by a side wall 14. For strengthening it,<br>
the sieve 13 may be provided with flanges 16, which facilitate also fixing the sieve to the<br>
housing 1. This corresponds to a delivery of the material comminuted by the rotor 2 to<br>
below. However, the construction may be also so that this delivery of the comminuted<br>
material is made in axial direction of the rotor 2, for example to an extruder, not shown,<br>
that follows the rotor 2, which lateron is described more in detail.<br>
Suitably, the knives 6 are disposed along knive circles on the rotor 2 and pass the<br>
correspondingly disposed counter knives 8 with a narrow shearing gap. As it is shown, the<br>
knives 6 may differently extend in radial direction from the axis of the rotor 2, whereby a<br>
better action onto the material to be comminuted is obtained. The knives 6 and the<br>
counter knives 8, therefore, as so say, are indentingly disposed, thus forming the shearing<br>
gaps. This material is supplied by means of a supply device 43 to the rotor 2 and is<br>
pressed to the rotor, which supply device in the embodiment shown comprises two slides<br>
17, 18 disposed one above the other and independently reciprocable in direction of the<br>
arrows 19 or 20 towards the rotor 2 or away from it. For this, the slides 17, 18 are<br>
connected to drive means of any known construction, not shown. The lower slide 17 is<br>
guided along a guide means 21 formed by a bottom plate of the housing 1. For the upper<br>
slide 18, a guide means is on the one hand formed by the top surface 22 of the lower slide<br>
17, and on the other hand it is guided on its top by a guide means 23 formed by a cover<br>
plate. Both slides 17, 18, of course, are also laterally guided along walls of the housing 1.<br>
As Fig. 1 shows, the lower slide 17 together with the periphery 5 of the rotor 2 forms an<br>
intake gap 24 for the material to be comminuted, which intake gap 24 narrows from its<br>
upper end up to its lower end substantially in the shape of a wedge. Into this intake gap 24<br>
the material is pressed by the lower slide 17 against the circulating knives 6. In order to<br>
avoid that the throughput of the apparatus decreases when the slide 17 is retracted or,<br>
respectively, when it is in a position that is comparatively remote from the rotor 2, the<br>
upper slide 18 is provided that is so moved that during these critical phases the material to<br>
be comminuted is conveyed towards the rotor 2. For these motions of the slides 11, 12,<br>
suitable control means can be provided, the programs of which being suitably variable in<br>
order to enable one to adapt to different qualities of the material to be comminuted.<br>
In order to make the intake gap 24 as wedge-shaped as possible, the two slides<br>
17, 18 can be disposed higher than this is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows an embodiment in<br>
which the upper edge of the guide means 21 is disposed substantially at the level of the<br>
axis 25 of the cylinder-shaped rotor 2. Thereby, a wedge-shaped intake gap 24 between<br>
the entire front surface 27 of the lower slide 17 and a tangent 44 to the enveloping circle<br>
26 of the orbit of the knives 6 is obtained, which intake gap 24 narrows to below. This<br>
favours the intake of the material to be comminuted, in particular if the wedge angle 28 of<br>
this intake gap 24 is increased by a corresponding inclination of the front surface 27 of the<br>
lower slide 17. In Fig. 2 this angle 28 between the front surface 27 and the tangent 44 to<br>
the outer enveloping circle 26 of the knives 6 is shown, this holds for an analogous value<br>
of course also for the base circle 29 of the rotor 2 from which the knives 6 extend. The<br>
knives protrude into corresponding recesses 30 of the counter tool 8 so that narrow<br>
shearing gaps are formed.<br>
Many materials to be processed, in particular synthetic plastic materials that are<br>
soiled by solid materials, for example mineral grains (sand or the like), may cause a<br>
considerable wear of the front surfaces of the slides 17, 18 facing the rotor, in particular of<br>
the lower slide 17. Therefore, it is of advantage to constitute this front surface 27 by an<br>
exchangeable end piece 31 (Fig. 3), preferably of a material that is highly resistant against<br>
wear. This exchangeability of the end piece 31 enables one to produce different wedge<br>
angles 28 or, different shapes of the wedge-like intake gap 24 by differently forming the<br>
front surface 27 of the several end pieces 31. Thus, it is possible, as the Figs, show, to<br>
give the intake gap over its height a different wedge angle, since, as Fig. 3 shows, the<br>
front surface 27 of the slide 17 must not be even, but can also be curved. Thereby one is<br>
enabled in a simple manner to adapt to particularities of the respective material to be<br>
comminuted<br>
Since in operation higher temperatures occur in the region of the slide 17 adjoining<br>
the surface 27, in particular in an end piece 31, it is suitable to provide this region, in<br>
particular the end piece 31, with conduits 32 for a cooling medium, which conduits 32 are<br>
connected to a supply line 33 and a remove line 34 for the cooling medium. Cooling media<br>
of any kind, which are known per se, may be used, in particular cold water.<br>
A further adaptation to the respective material to be comminuted is obtained by<br>
providing the surface 27 of the lower slide 17 facing the rotor 2 with a structure, in<br>
particular with grooves 35 (Fig. 3, 7), whereby an effect onto the material to be processed<br>
is obtained in the region of the intake gap 24. If these grooves 35 extend straight-lined or,<br>
respectively, in vertical direction, i.e. in a direction extending perpendicularly to the<br>
direction of the axis 25 of the rotor 2, these grooves 35 avoid an escape of the material to<br>
be processed in axial direction of the rotor 2 and, therefore, an increased intake action<br>
into the intake gap 24 is obtained. However, if these grooves 35 extend obliquely, i.e. if<br>
their longitudinal direction has a component extending in axial direction of the rotor 2, then<br>
these grooves cause a conveyance of the material to be processed having a component<br>
of motion in that direction to which the respective lower end of the grooves 35 is directed.<br>
This component of motion of the processed material directed in axial direction of the rotor<br>
2 can be made use of to move this material towards the one front end of the rotor, for<br>
example in order to discharge there this material from the housing 1. Such a construction<br>
is suitable in particular if an intake opening of a screw extruder or the like is connected to<br>
this front end or, respectively, to the exit opening for the comminuted plastics material,<br>
since in such a manner a coaxial construction of the comminuting apparatus and the<br>
extruder can be obtained. The comminuting apparatus and the extruder may then be<br>
driven by a common drive means.<br>
As Fig. 7 shows, such grooves 35 may be provided not only on the lower slide 17,<br>
but also on the upper slide 18.<br>
Also the grooves extending in the front surfaces of the slides 17, 18 may be<br>
curved, corresponding to the curving, shown in Fig. 3, of the front surface 27 of the slide<br>
17.<br>
The embodiments shown in Figs. 1 to 3 show a guide means of the slides 17, 18<br>
that extends substantially in horizontal direction. However, this is not compulsory. As Fig.<br>
4 shows, the two slides 17, 18 may be also guided along a guide means 21 that is inclined<br>
with respect to the horizontal direction 36, whereby also the counter knives 8 may be<br>
disposed inclined, however, this is not compulsory. These two slides 17, 18 are guided<br>
along a guide means 21 that is also curved along an arc of a circle and also the counter<br>
knife 8 may be correspondingly curved The several arcs of a circle have a coinciding<br>
center 37.<br>
The embodiments according to Figs. 4 and 5 can be combined insofar as the<br>
circular arced shape of the slides 17, 18 or, respectively, of the guide means 21, must not<br>
approach the rotor 2 in a horizontal direction, but can also approach it inclined as this is<br>
shown by the guide means 21 in Fig. 4.<br>
For certain applications it can be of advantage to temporarily or continuously fix<br>
the lower slide 17 confining the intake gap 24 for processing a defined material in constant<br>
manner. In order to adjust the lower slide 17 to the desired intake gap 24, this slide 17 can<br>
be provided with a hollow space 38 (Fig. 6), therefore box-shaped, and may be provided<br>
on its bottom wall 39 with a longitudinal slot 40 in which a screw 41 is guided when the<br>
slide 17 is adjusted, this screw 41 intersecting the guide means 21. If this screw 41 or,<br>
respectively, the nut disposed at the lower side of the guide means 21 is tightened, the<br>
slide 17 is fixed in its adjusted position. The longitudinal slot 40 should be sufficiently long<br>
in order to enable one to adjust the lower slide 17 in a sufficiently retracted position so that<br>
also very great clods of material can be processed. An alternative construction to that<br>
described heretofore consists in to adjust the slide 17 by means of a spindle or by a<br>
hydraulic drive means in direction of the double arrow 19 and to fix it in the desired<br>
position. In such a manner, by the lower or lowermost slide 17 a constant intake gap 24<br>
may be kept during an operation step between the rotor 2 and the front wall 27 of this<br>
slide facing it. Into this intake gap 24 the plastics material to be comminuted is supplied by<br>
the supply means formed by the upper slide 18 or the upper slides.<br>
Further, it may be suitable to incline the front surface 42 (Fig. 3) of the upper slide<br>
18 with respect to the direction of its motion (double arrow 20), and this oppositely<br>
directed to the front surface 27 of the lower slide 17. This avoids an escape of the material<br>
to be processed to above into the funnel-shaped supply well 7 (Fig. 1) and, therefore,<br>
favours pressing the material to be processed against the rotor 2.<br>
Within all embodiments it is possible to subdivide the two slides 17, 18, disposed<br>
one above the other over the length of the rotor. This subdivision can be made for the<br>
lower slide 17 alone or for the upper slide 18 alone or (or both slides 17, 18. and in the<br>
latter case the subdivision must not be the same for the two slides 17. 18. Then, two or<br>
more lower or, respectively, upper slides 17 or 18 are provided over the length of the rotor<br>
2. Such a subdivision of the slides 17. 18 into two slide elements each is shown in Fig. 7<br>
and it can be seen that the several slide elements must not be formed equal to each<br>
other. The movements of these slide elements can be controlled in a different manner,<br>
wherein the control program can be adapted to the respective conditions given.<br>
As it can be seen, also more than two slides can be superimposed one above the<br>
other.<br>
As already said, it is suitable to adapt the motions of the several slides to the<br>
material to be processed, for example by means of suitable programmed control means.<br>
In the most cases it is suitable to let the upper slide or the upper slides advance to the<br>
lowermost slide, so that the material pressed by the lowermost slide against the rotor 2<br>
cannot escape to above.<br>
It has been shown that the following procedure is suitable for adjusting the intake<br>
gap 24: At first, all slides 17, 18 are retracted, and the front surfaces 27, 42 of these slides<br>
17, 18 facing the rotor 2 are brought into a position in which they are at least substantially<br>
equally spaced apart from the rotor 2. Subsequently, the plastics material to be processed<br>
is introduced between these front surfaces 27, 42 and the rotor 2, whereupon all slides 17,<br>
18 are advanced. Corresponding to the respective plastics material to be comminuted, the<br>
movements of the slides 17, 18 are then controlled.<br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1. Apparatus for comminuting synthetic plastic waste material, comprising a<br>
housing in which at least one rotor is bearingly supported for rotation by a<br>
motor around a, preferably horizontal, axis, which rotor on its periphery is<br>
provided with comminuting tools, in particular knives, acting onto the<br>
supplied material, counter tools, in particular counter knives, stationarily<br>
disposed within the housing forming a supply shaft of great volume being<br>
assigned to the comminuting tools, and further comprising a feed means<br>
having a slide member pressing the material disposed within the supply<br>
shaft against the rotor, characterized in that the feed means (43)<br>
comprises a least two slide members (17,18) superimposed above each<br>
other and feeding the material to the rotor (2), which slide members are<br>
independently from each other moveable towards the rotor (2), or away<br>
from it, wherein the front surface (27) of the lowermost slide member (17)<br>
facing the rotor (2) defines with the tangent (44) to the enveloping circle<br>
(26) of the comminuting tools (6) carried by the rotor (2) a substantially<br>
wedge-shaped Intake gap (24) for the material to be comminuted, which<br>
intake gap narrows to below up to its lower end.<br>
2. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the slide members (17,18)<br>
superimposed above each other are contacting each other and are<br>
guided in parallel to each other by guide means (21,23), that, if<br>
desired, are inclined with respect to the horizontal direction (36).<br>
3. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the slide members<br>
(17,18) disposed above each other are guided along guide means<br>
(21,23) that are straight-lined or curved in the manner of an arc of a<br>
circle.<br>
4. Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the lower slide<br>
member (17) or the lowermost slide member can be fixed in its position<br>
relative to the rotor (2).<br>
5. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 to 4, wherein the front surface (27) of<br>
at least one slide member (17,18) facing the rotor (2) is formed by an<br>
exchangeable end piece (31).<br>
6. Apparatus as claimed in claim 5, wherein different end pieces (31)<br>
confine with the rotor (2) different intake gaps (24) or, respectively,<br>
intake wedge angles (28).<br>
7. Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, wherein channels (32) for<br>
a cooling medium are provided in the region of the front surface (27) of<br>
at least one slide member (17,18) facing the rotor (2) or, respectively,<br>
within the end piece (31).<br>
8. Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, wherein the front surface<br>
(27) facing the rotor (2) of at least one slide member (17,18) has a<br>
structure acting onto the material to be drawn in, which structure in<br>
particular is provided with grooves (35) that extend straight-lined or<br>
curved or obliquely.<br>
9. Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1 to 8, wherein at least one slide<br>
member (17,18) is subdivided over the length of the rotor (2) in a group<br>
of slide members, the several elements thereof, it desired, are driven<br>
to different movements relative to the rotor.<br>
10 Process for operating an apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein by<br>
the lower slide or the lowermost slide during an operation step a<br>
constant intake gap is kept between the rotor and the front wall of this<br>
slide facing it, into which intake gap the material to be comminuted is<br>
fed in by the supply means comprising the upper slide or the upper<br>
slides.<br>
11. Process as claimed in claim 10, wherein for adjusting this intake gap<br>
all slides are retracted and their front surfaces facing the rotor are<br>
brought into a position in which they are equally spaced apart from the<br>
rotor, whereupon material to be processed is introduced between<br>
these front surfaces and the rotor, and that then all slides are<br>
advanced.<br><br><br>
An apparatus for comminuting waste of synthetic plastic material comprises a<br>
housing (1) in which at least one rotor (2) is bearingly supported for rotation around a,<br>
preferably horizontal, axis by a motor. The rotor (2) is provided on its periphery with<br>
comminuting tools acting onto the supplied material, in particular knives 6, counter tools,<br>
in particular counter knives (8), assigned to the knives, being stationarily disposed within<br>
the housing (1) forming a supply well (7) of great volume. The material disposed within the<br>
supply well (7) is pressed against the rotor (2) by a supply means which comprises at<br>
least two slides (17, 18) superimposed above each other and supplying the material to the<br>
rotor (2), which slides are independently from each other moveable against the rotor (2) or<br>
away from it. The front surface of the lowermost (17) facing the rotor (2) defines with the<br>
tangent (44) to the enveloping circle (26) of the comminuting tools (6) carried by the rotor<br>
(2) a substantially wedge-shaped intake gap (24) for the material to be comminuted. This<br>
intake gap (24) narrows to below up to its lower end.<br></td>
