Method Of Controlling A Dual Clutch Transmission filed February 21, 2003.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field ofthe Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates, generally to a method of controlling a dual clutch<br>
transmission and. more specifically, to a method for controlling the timing of thegear shift events<br>
of the dual clutch transmission by determining the optimum shift points based on vehicle<br>
acceleration or load.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
[0003] Generally speaking, land vehicles require a powertrain consisting of three basic<br>
components. These components include a power plant (such as an internal combustion engine), a<br>
power transmission, and wheels. The power transmission component is typically referred to<br>
simply as the "transmission." Engine torque and speed are converted in the transmission in<br>
accordance with the tractive-power demand of the vehicle. Presently, there are two typical<br>
transmissions widely availabie for use in conventional motor vehicles. The first and oldest type<br>
is the manually operated transmission. These transmissions include a foot-operated start-up or<br>
launch clutch that engages and disengages the driveline with the power plant and a gearshift lever<br>
to selectively change the gear ratios within the transmission. When driving a vehicle having a<br>
manual transmission, the driver must coordinate the operation of the clutch pedal, the gearshift<br>

2. Description of the Related Art<br>
[0003] Generally speaking, land vehicles require a powerlrain consisting of three basic<br>
components. These components include a power plant (such as an internal combustion engine), a<br>
power transmission, and wheels. The power transmission component is typically referred to<br>
simply as the "transmission." Engine torque and speed arc converted in the transmission in<br>
accordance with the tractive-power demand of the vehicle. Presently, there are two typical<br>
transmissions widely available for use in conventional motor vehicles. The first and oldest type<br>
is the manually operated transmission. These transmissions include a foot-operated start-up or<br>
launch clutch that engages and disengages the driveline with the power plant and a gearshift lever<br>
to selectively change the gear ratios within the transmission. When driving a vehicle having a<br>
manual transmission, the driver must coordinate the operation of the clutch pedal, the gearshift<br>
lever, and the accelerator pedal to achieve a smooth and efficient shift from one gear to the next.<br>
The structure of a manual transmission is simple and robust and provides good fuel economy by<br>
having a direct power connection from the engine to the final drive wheels of the vehicle.<br>
Additionally, since the operator is given complete control over the timing of the shifts, the<br>
operator is able to dynamically adjust the shifting process so that the vehicle can be driven most<br>
efficiently. One disadvantage of the manual transmission is that there is an interruption in the<br>
drive connection during gear shifting. This results in losses in efficiency. In addition, there is a<br>
great deal of physical interaction required on the part of the operator to shift gears in a vehicle<br>
that employs a manual transmission.<br>
[0004] The second and newer choice for the transmission of power in a conventional<br>
motor vehicle is an automatic transmission. Automatic transmissions offer ease of operation.<br>
The driver of a vehicle having an automatic transmission is not required to use both hands, one<br>
for the steering wheel and one for the gearshift, and both feet, one for the clutch and one for the<br>
accelerator and brake pedal in order to safely operate the vehicle. In addition, an automatic<br>
transmission provides greater convenience in stop and go situations, because the driver is not<br>
concerned about continuously shifting gears to adjust to the ever-changing speed of traffic.<br>
Although conventional automatic transmissions avoid an interruption in the drive connection<br>
during gear shifting, they suffer from the disadvantage of reduced efficiency because of the need<br>
for hydrokinetie devices, such as torque converters, interposed between the output of the engine<br>
and the input of the transmission for transferring kinetic energy therebetween. In addition,<br>
automatic transmissions are typically more mechanically complex and therefore more expensive<br>
than manual transmissions.<br>
[0005] For example, torque converters typically include impeller assemblies that arc<br>
operatively connected for rotation with the torque input from an internal combustion engine, a<br>
turbine assembly that is fluidly connected in driven relationship with the impeller assembly and a<br>
stator or reactor assembly. These assemblies together form a substantially toroidal flow passage<br>
for kinetic fluid in the torque converter. Each assembly includes a plurality of blades or vjanes<br>
that act to convert mechanical energy to hydrokinetic energy and back to mechanical energy. The<br>
stator assembly of a conventional torque converter is locked against rotation in one direction but<br>
is free to spin about an axis in the direction of rotation of the impeller assembly and turbine<br>
assembly. When the stator assembly is locked against rotation, the torque is multiplied by the<br>
torque converter. During torque multiplication, the output torque is greater than the input torque<br>
for the torque converter. However, when there is no torque multiplication, the torque converter<br>
becomes a fluid coupling. Fluid couplings have inherent slip. Torque converter slip exists when<br>
the speed ratio is less than 1.0 (RPM input &gt; than RPM output of the torque converter). The<br>
inherent slip reduces the efficiency of the torque converter.<br>
[0006] While torque converters provide a smooth coupling between the engine and the<br>
transmission, the slippage of the torque converter results in a parasitic loss, thereby decreasing<br>
the efficiency of the entire powertrain. Further, the torque converter itself requires pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid in addition to any pressurized fluid requirements for the actuation of the gear<br>
shifting operations. This means that an automatic transmission must have a large capacity pump<br>
to provide the necessary hydraulic pressure for both converter engagement and shift changes.<br>
The power required to drive the pump and pressurize the fluid introduces additional parasitic<br>
losses of efficiency in the automatic transmission.<br>
[0007] In an ongoing attempt to provide a vehicle transmission that has the advantages of<br>
both types of transmissions with fewer of the drawbacks, combinations of the traditional<br>
"manual" and "automatic" transmissions have evolved. Most recently, "automated" variants of<br>
conventional manual transmissions have been developed which shift automatically without any<br>
input from the vehicle operator. Such automated manual transmissions typically include a<br>
plurality of power-operated actuators that are controlled by a transmission controller or some type<br>
of electronic control unit (ECU) to automatically shift synchronized clutches that control the<br>
engagement of meshed gear wheels traditionally found in manual transmissions. The design<br>
variants have included either electrically or hydraulically powered actuators to affect the gear<br>
changes. However, even with the inherent improvements of these newer automated<br>
transmissions, they still have the disadvantage of a power interruption in the drive connection<br>
between the input shaft and the output shaft during sequential gear shifting. Power interrupted<br>
shifting results in a harsh shift feel that is generally considered to be unacceptable when<br>
compared to smooth shift feel associated with most conventional automatic transmissions.<br>
[0008] To overcome this problem, other automated manual type transmissions have been<br>
developed that can be power-shifted to permit gearshifts to be made under load. Examples of<br>
such power-shifted automated manual transmissions are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,711,409 issued<br>
on Jan 27, 1998 to Murata for a Twin-Clutch Type Transmission, and U.S. Pat. No. 5.966,989<br>
issued on Apr 04, 2000 to Reed, Jr. et al for an Electro-mechanical Automatic Transmission<br>
having Dual Input Shafts. These particular types of automated manual transmissions have two<br>
clutches and are generally referred to simply as dual, or twin, clutch transmissions. The dual<br>
clutch structure is most often coaxially and cooperatively configured so as to derive power input<br>
from a single engine flywheel arrangement. However, some designs have a dual clutch assembly<br>
that is coaxial but with the clutches located on opposite sides of the transmissions body and<br>
having different input sources. Regardless, the layout is the equivalent of having two<br>
transmissions in one housing, namely one power transmission assembly on each of two input<br>
shafts concomitantly driving one output shaft. Each transmission can be shifted and clutched<br>
independently. In this manner, uninterrupted power upshifting and downshifting between gears,<br>
along with the high mechanical efficiency of a manual transmission is available in an automatic<br>
transmission form. Thus significant increases in fuel economy and vehicle performance may be<br>
achieved through the effective use of certain automated manual transmissions.<br>
[0009] The dual clutch transmission structure may include two dry disc clutches each<br>
with their own clutch actuator to control the engagement and disengagement of the two-clutch<br>
discs independently. While the clutch actuators may be of the electro-mechanical type, since a<br>
lubrication system within the transmission requires a pump, some dual clutch transmissions<br>
utilize hydraulic shifting and clutch control. These pumps are most often gerotor types, and are<br>
much smaller than those used in conventional automatic transmissions because they typically do<br>
not have to supply a torque converter. Thus, any parasitic losses are kept small. Shifts are<br>
accomplished by engaging the desired gear prior to a shift event and subsequently engaging the<br>
corresponding clutch. With two clutches and two inputs shafts, at certain times, the dual clutch<br>
transmission may be in two different gear ratios at once, but only one clutch will be engaged and<br>
transmitting power at any given moment. To shift to the next higher gear, first the desired gears<br>
on the input shaft of the non-driven clutch assembly are engaged, then the driven clutch is<br>
released, and the non-driven clutch is engaged.<br>
[0010| This requires that the dual clutch transmission be configured to have the forward<br>
gear ratios alternatingly arranged on their respective input shafts. In other words, to perform up-<br>
shifts from first to second gear, the first and second gears must be on different input shafts.<br>
Therefore, the odd gears will be associated with one input shaft and the even gears will be<br>
associated with the other input shaft. In view of this convention, the input shafts are generally<br>
referred to as the odd and even shafts. Typically, the input shafts transfer the applied torque to a<br>
single counter shaft, which includes mating gears to the input shaft gears. The mating gears of<br>
the counter shaft are in constant mesh with the gears on the input shafts. The counter shaft also<br>
includes an output gear that is meshingly engaged to a gear on the output shaft. Thus, the input<br>
torque from the engine is transferred from one of the clutches to an input shaft, through a gear set<br>
to the counter shaft and from the counter shaft to the output shaft.<br>
|0011] Gear engagement in a dual clutch transmission is similar to that in a conventional<br>
manual transmission. One of the gears in each of the gear sets is disposed on its respective shaft<br>
in such a manner so that it can freewheel about the shaft. A synchronizer is also disposed on the<br>
shaft next to the freewheeling gear so that the synchronizer can selectively engage the gear to the<br>
shaft. To automate the transmission, the mechanical selection of each of the gear sets is typically<br>
performed by some type of actuator that moves the synchronizers. A reverse gear set includes a<br>
gear on one of the input shafts, a gear on the counter shaft, and an intermediate gear mounted on<br>
a separate counter shaft meshingly disposed between the two so that reverse movement of the<br>
output shaft may be achieved.<br>
[0012] While these power-shift dual clutch transmissions overcome several drawbacks<br>
associated with conventional transmissions and the newer automated manual transmissions, it has<br>
been found that controlling and regulating the automatically actuated dual clutch transmissions is<br>
a complicated matter and that the desired vehicle occupant comfort goals have not been<br>
achievable in the past. There are a large number of events to properly time and execute within<br>
the transmission for each shift to occur smoothly and efficiently. Conventional control schemes<br>
and methods have generally failed to provide this capability. Accordingly, there exists a need in<br>
the related art for better methods of controlling the operation of dual clutch transmissions.<br>
[0013] One particular area of control improvement that is needed is in the timing of the<br>
events in the power-shifting of the dual clutch transmission. As discussed above, power shifting<br>
is actually the automatic gear shifting process of the dual clutch transmission. The nature of the<br>
dual clutch transmission, that is, the manual style configuration discussed above that employs<br>
automatically actuated disc type clutches, requires accurate control of the clutch engagement and<br>
thus the torque transferred across them during the gear shifting process. Additionally, the<br>
movement of the synchronizers requires accurate control in the gear shifting event. It is desirable<br>
to operate the synchronizers and the clutches of the dual clutch transmission so that the automatic<br>
gear shifting process is smoothly and efficiently controlled by varying the amount of torque<br>
transferred across each clutch as the clutch torque driving the off-going gear is minimized and the<br>
clutch torque driving the on-coming clutch is maximized. The efficiency and smooth operation<br>
of the shifting event is directly related to the control and timing of each portion of the shift. More<br>
specifically, it is critical to control the timing of the shift in relation to the demand for vehicle<br>
acceleration and for variations in vehicle load caused by road and driving conditions.<br>
[0014] Current control methods have the general capability to operate the clutches and<br>
synchronizers as needed. However, the prior art dual transmission clutch control schemes are<br>
incapable of adequately providing for the fine timing and control of the shift event necessary to<br>
satisfy this need. Specifically, they lack the ability to accurately control when the shift occurs to<br>
achieve the high degree of accuracy needed for efficiency and smooth shifting between the gears<br>
of the transmission under all vehicle loading conditions and throttle demands. For example,<br>
when rapid acceleration is called for, with low or light load conditions on the vehicle, engine<br>
inefficiency and even damage may occur if the shift timing is not adjusted to occur sooner as a<br>
means for compensating for the rapid acceleration when compared to the shift timing of a more<br>
leisurely acceleration. In other words, if the timing of the shift is not adjusted to account for the<br>
rapid increase in engine speed such that the shift event is held to a slower shifting pace, the<br>
engine will likely overspeed. Likewise, if rapid acceleration is called for but the load on the<br>
vehicle is heavier, such as when the vehicle encounters a steep road incline, the resultant vehicle<br>
acceleration will be slower. In this case, the shift should occur later to coincide increasing load to<br>
prevent a premature gearshift. Downshifting events also require timing control depending on the<br>
deceleration demands and vehicle loading to provide smooth and efficient control of the<br>
transmission and engine. Current control methods for shifting a dual clutch transmission<br>
generally concern themselves with simple engagement and disengagement of the clutch<br>
assemblies and synchronizers and fail to adequately provide for the corresponding timing control<br>
of all aspects of the shift event including engine speed control during the shift and the differences<br>
in upshifting and downshifting.<br>
[0015] In that regard, some prior control methods for the gear shifting of dual clutch<br>
transmissions have attempted to overcome these inadequacies by using a control algorithm. For<br>
example, one known method provides an algorithm to control the movement of electrical clutch<br>
actuators, and thus the engagement of the clutches, to prevent torque interruption during upshifts<br>
of a dual clutch transmission. While the application of this particular algorithm is functionally<br>
adequate for its intended use, it still has certain drawbacks that leave room for improvement.<br>
[0016] Particularly, while this and other known dual clutch transmission shifting<br>
approaches attempt to provide a power-shift in which there is no interruption of torque transfer,<br>
none of the current methods provides for variable shift points and variable engine speed profiles<br>
for smooth and efficient torque transfer under varying conditions. Additionally, certain prior art<br>
methods utilize an engine performance map that attempts to predict expected engine output<br>
torque and sets the clutch position and shift points based on those predictions so that this control<br>
method is reactive to predicted engine output. The drawback of this control approach is that the<br>
values of the considered variables can fluctuate greatly and a stored map of predictions cannot be<br>
adequately relied upon to predict the actual engine output. Accordingly, there remains a need in<br>
the art for a method to operatively and actively control the timing of the gearshifts in a dual<br>
clutch transmission by varying the shift points so that both upshifts and downshifts are efficiently<br>
and smoothly performed and optimum engine efficiency and safe operation is maintained.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0017] The disadvantages of the related art arc overcome by the method of the present<br>
invention for providing the timing control of the shift events for a vehicle having a dual clutch<br>
transmission. The method of the present invention includes the steps of sensing the current<br>
output speed of the transmission, determining the time required to complete each possible shift<br>
event within the transmission, and determining an output speed modification value for each<br>
possible shift event. The method also includes the steps of determining a shift point output speed<br>
for each possible shift event by summing the determined output speed modification value with<br>
the current output speed, determining if a shift has been commanded, and providing the<br>
determined shift point output speed at which to perform the shift when a shift has been<br>
commanded.<br>
[0018] Thus, the method of the present invention controls the timing of the shift events of<br>
the dual clutch transmission by controlling the shift points in response to changes in the load and<br>
commands for acceleration. This is a substantial efficiently improvement over the prior methods<br>
of dual clutch shift control, which do not consider all the various conditions and situations in<br>
which a shift may occur. Furthermore, the shifts are also accomplished smoothly so that there is<br>
no hard or distinctive "feel" to the shift, thereby improving overall drivability and comfort of the<br>
vehicle.<br>
[10019] Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be readily<br>
appreciated as the same becomes better understood after reading the subsequent description taken<br>
in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)<br>
[0025] A representative dual clutch transmission that may be controlled by the present<br>
invention is generally indicated at 10 in the schematic illustrated in Figure 1. Specifically, as<br>
shown in Figure 1, the dual clutch transmission 10 includes a dual, coaxial clutch assembly<br>
generally indicated at 12. a first input shaft, generally indicated at 14, a second input shaft,<br>
generally indicated at 16, that is coaxial to the first, a counter shaft, generally indicated at 18. an<br>
output shaft 20, a reverse counter shaft 22, and a plurality of synchronizers, generally indicated at<br>
24..<br>
[0026] The dual clutch transmission 10 forms a portion of a vehicle powertrain and is<br>
responsible for taking a torque input from a prime mover, such as an internal combustion engine<br>
and transmitting the torque through selectable gear ratios to the vehicle drive wheels. The dual<br>
clutch transmission 10 operatively routes the applied torque from the engine through the dual,<br>
coaxial clutch assembly 12 to cither the first input shaft 14 or the second input shaft 16. The<br>
input shafts 14 and 16 include a first series of gears, which are in constant mesh with a second<br>
series of gears disposed on the counter shaft 18. Each one of the first series of gears interacting<br>
with one of the second series of gears to provide the different gear ratios sets used for transferring<br>
torque. The counter shaft 18 also includes a first output gear that is in constant mesh with a<br>
second output gear disposed on the output shaft 20. The plurality of synchronizers 24 are<br>
disposed on the two input shafts 14,16 and on the counter shaft 18 and are operatively controlled<br>
by the plurality of shift actuators (not shown) to selectively engage one of the gear ratio sets.<br>
Thus, torque is transferred from the engine to the dual, coaxial clutch assembly 12, to one of the<br>
input shafts 14 or 16, to the counter shaft 18 through one of the gear ratio sets, and to the output<br>
shaft 20. The output shaft 20 further provides the output torque to the remainder of the<br>
powertrain. Additionally, the reverse counter shaft 22 includes an intermediate gear that is<br>
disposed between one of the first series of gears and one of the second series of gears, which<br>
allows for a reverse rotation of the counter shaft 18 and the output shaft 20. Bach of these<br>
components will be discussed in greater detail below.<br>
[0027] Specifically, the dual, coaxial clutch assembly 12 includes a first clutch<br>
mechanism 32 and a second clutch mechanism 34. The first clutch mechanism 32 is, in part,<br>
physically connected to a portion of the engine flywheel (not shown) and is, in part, physically<br>
attached to the first input shaft 14, such that the first clutch mechanism 32 can operatively and<br>
selectively engage or disengage the first input shaft 14 to and from the flywheel. Similarly, the<br>
second clutch mechanism 34 is, in part, physically connected to a portion of the flywheel and is,<br>
in part, physically attached to the second input shaft 16, such that the second clutch mechanism<br>
34 can operatively and selectively engage or disengage the second input shaft 16 to and from the<br>
flywheel. As can be seen from Figure 1, the first and second clutch mechanisms 32, 34 are<br>
coaxial and co-centric such that the outer case 28 of the first clutch mechanism 32 fits inside of<br>
the outer case 36 of the second clutch mechanism 34. Similarly, the first and second input shafts<br>
14, 16 are also coaxial and co-centric such that the second input shaft 16 is hollow having an<br>
inside diameter sufficient to allow the first input shaft 14 to pass through and be partially<br>
supported by the second input shaft 16. The first input shaft 14 includes a first input gear 38 and<br>
a third input gear 42. The first input shaft 14 is longer in length than the second input shaft 16 so<br>
that the first input gear 38 and a third input gear 42 are disposed on the portion of the first input<br>
shaft 14 that extends beyond the second input shaft 16. The second input shaft 16 includes a<br>
second input gear 40, a fourth input gear 44, a sixth input gear 46, and a reverse input gear 48.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the second input gear 40 and the reverse input gear 48 are fixedly disposed<br>
on the second input shaft 16 and the fourth input gear 44 and sixth input gear 46 are rotatably<br>
supported about the second input shaft 16 upon bearing assemblies 50 so that their rotation is<br>
unrestrained unless the accompanying synchronizer is engaged, as will be discussed in greater<br>
detail below.<br>
[0028] In the preferred embodiment, the counter shaft 18 is a single, one-piece shaft that<br>
includes the opposing, or counter, gears to those on the inputs shafts 14, 16. As shown in Figure<br>
1, the counter shaft 18 includes a first counter gear 52, a second counter gear 54, a third counter<br>
gear 56, a fourth counter gear 58, a sixth counter gear 60, and a reverse counter gear 62. The<br>
counter shaft 18 fixedly retains the fourth counter gear 58 and counter gear 60, while first,<br>
second, third, and reverse counter gears 52, 54, 56,62 are supported about the counter shaft 18 by<br>
bearing assemblies 50 so that their rotation is unrestrained unless the accompanying synchronizer<br>
is engaged as will be discussed in greater detail below. The counter shaft 18 also fixedly retains a<br>
first drive gear 64 that meshingly engages the corresponding second driven gear 66 on the output<br>
shaft 20. The second driven gear 66 is fixedly retained on the output shaft 20. The output shaft<br>
20 extends outward from the transmission 10 to provide an attachment for the remainder of the<br>
powertrain.<br>
|0029] In the preferred embodiment, the reverse counter shaft 22 is a relatively short shaft<br>
having a single reverse intermediate gear 72 that is disposed between, and meshingly engaged<br>
with, the reverse input gear 48 on the second input shaft 16 and the reverse counter gear 62 on the<br>
counter shaft 18. Thus, when the reverse gear 48, 62, and 72 are engaged, the reverse<br>
intermediate gear 72 on the reverse counter shaft 22 causes the counter shaft 18 to turn in the<br>
opposite rotational direction from the forward gears thereby providing a reverse rotation of the<br>
output shaft 20. It should be appreciated that all of the shafts of the dual clutch transmission 10<br>
are disposed and rotationally secured within the transmission 10 by some manner of bearing<br>
assembly such as roller bearings, for example, shown at 68 in Figure 1.<br>
(00301 The engagement and disengagement of the various forward and reverse gears is<br>
accomplished by the actuation of the synchronizers 24 within the transmission. As shown in<br>
Figure 1 in this example of a dual clutch transmission 10, there are four synchronizers 74.76.78,<br>
and 80 that are utilized to shift through the six forward gears and reverse. It should be appreciated<br>
that they are a variety of known types of synchronizers that are capable of engaging a gear to a<br>
shaft and that the particular type employed for the purposes of this discussion is beyond the scope<br>
of the present invention. Generally speaking, any type of synchronizer that is movable by a shift<br>
fork or like device may be employed. As shown in the representative example of Figure 1, the<br>
synchronizers are two sided, dual actuated synchronizers, such that they engage one gear to its<br>
shaft when moved off of a center neutralized position to the right and engage another gear to its<br>
shaft when moved to the left.<br>
[0031] It should be appreciated that the operation of the dual clutch transmission 10 is<br>
managed by some type of control device such as an electronic control unit (ECU) that oversees<br>
the functioning of the transmission 10, or by an electronic control unit for the vehicle in which<br>
the dual clutch transmission 10 may be installed. Regardless, there exists a control device,<br>
beyond the scope of this invention, that controls and operates the dual clutch transmission<br>
through a stored control scheme or series of control schemes of which the present invention is<br>
merely a part. The control device having the capability of providing the proper voltages, signals,<br>
and/or hydraulic pressures to operate the transmission 10 and particularly the clutch engagement<br>
functions. Thus, the control method of the present invention that controls the timing of the shift<br>
events as described below is a portion, such as a sub-routine, or series of sub-routines, of a larger<br>
control scheme within the ECU.<br>
[0032] The first and second clutch mechanisms 32 and 34 of the dual, coaxial clutch<br>
assembly 12 are operatively engaged and disengaged in a coordinated manner relative to the<br>
actuator of the various gear sets by the synchronizer 24 to selectively transfer torque to the output<br>
shaft 20. By way of example, if torque is being transferred to the drive wheels of the vehicle to<br>
initiate movement from a standing start, the lowest, or first, gear ratio of the dual clutch<br>
transmission 10 will likely be engaged. Therefore, as seen in Figure 1, synchronizer 78 will be<br>
driven to the left to engage the first counter gear 52 to the counter shaft 18 and the first clutch<br>
mechanism 32 will be engaged to transfer torque from the engine to the output shaft 20 through<br>
the first gear set. When vehicle speed increases and the ECU determines that the conditions<br>
require a shift to the second gear set, synchronizer 80 will first be driven to the right to engage the<br>
second counter gear 54 to the counter shaft 18. Then the second clutch mechanism 34 will be<br>
engaged as the first clutch mechanism 32 is disengaged. In this manner, a powershift, where no<br>
power interruption occurs, is effected. Additionally, while engaged and driving a particular gear,<br>
the first and second clutch mechanisms 32 and 34 are controlled by certain stored routines that<br>
provide varying amounts of engagement force to the clutch discs and thereby operatively control<br>
the amount of torque transferred across the clutches and the resultant engine speed. Of particular<br>
concern to this application is the speed control routine that causes the engine speed to track a<br>
predetermined target speed for given input parameters by varying the applied engagement<br>
pressure across the clutch discs. In that regard, the actuating components of the first and second<br>
clutch mechanisms 32 and 34 are not shown and it should be appreciated there may be of any<br>
number of suitable known devices that arc capable of selectively varying the applied engagement<br>
pressure between the clutch discs, such as, but not limited to mechanical actuators, hydro-<br>
mechanical actuators, electro-mechanical actuators, or fully electrical actuators.<br>
[0033] For example, in one embodiment of the dual clutch transmission 10, the first and<br>
second clutch mechanisms 32 and 34 of the dual, coaxial clutch assembly 12 are actuated by<br>
hydraulic pressure supplied by the first and second clutch actuator solenoids, respectively. The<br>
clutch actuator solenoids are schematically represented, and generally indicated at 120 and 122 in<br>
Figure 2, and as shown, are supplied with pressurized hydraulic fluid by a regulating circuit<br>
generally indicated at 82. It should be appreciated that, as previously mentioned, the actuation of<br>
the components of the dual clutch transmission 10 may be electrical rather than electro-hydraulic,<br>
and in that case, the first and second clutch actuator solenoids 120, 122 would be replaced by<br>
some type of physical drive devices to operatively engage the first and second clutch mechanisms<br>
32 and 34.<br>
[0034] As shown in Figure 2, for this example of a dual clutch transmission 10, there arc<br>
two on/off solenoids, generally indicated at 124 and 126, and two enable valves, generally<br>
indicated at 128 and 130 that provide the operative hydraulic pressure to the clutch actuator<br>
solenoids 120 and 122. A main pressure supply line 92 that is operatively connected to a source<br>
of pressurized hydraulic fluid from a pump within the transmission 10 (not shown) provides the<br>
two on/off solenoids 124 and 126 with pressurized hydraulic fluid. The on/off solenoids 124 and<br>
126 each have a selectively movable valve member 134 disposed within a valve body 136 that<br>
has internal hydraulic flow passages 138 and 140. When energized, the valve members 134 of<br>
the on/off solenoids 124 and 126 are driven to the left, as illustrated, by actuators 142 and 144<br>
respectively. The on/off solenoids 124 and 126 then selectively provide hydraulic pressure<br>
though pressure lines 148 and 150 to act upon the right sides of enable valves 128 and 130, as<br>
illustrated in Figure 2. In their normally de-energized state, biasing member 152 causes the valve<br>
member 134 to be driven back to the right and any residual pressure in pressure lines 148 or 150<br>
is bled off and routed back to the fluid sump, shown at 90.<br>
[0035] The enable valves 128 and 130 also each have a selectively movable valve<br>
member 154 disposed within a valve body 156 that has internal hydraulic flow passages 158 and<br>
160. The applied hydraulic pressure from the on/off solenoids 124 and 126 act to push the valve<br>
members 154 of the enable valves 128 and 130 to the left to open the internal hydraulic passage<br>
158 and provide hydraulic pressure to clutch actuator solenoid 120 and 122 through the pressure<br>
supply lines 160 and 162. In their normally de-energized state biasing member 166 causes the<br>
valve member 154 to be driven back to the right and any residual pressure in pressure lines 160<br>
or 162 is bled off and routed back to the fluid sump, shown at 90.<br>
[0036] Though beyond the scope of this invention and not shown here, the two enable<br>
valves 128 and 130 are also in fluid communication with, and hydraulically feed, the<br>
synchronizer actuator solenoids that drive the synchronizers 24 of the transmission 10 between<br>
their engaged and neutralized positions. Thus, it should be appreciated that two on/off solenoids<br>
124 and 126, and two enable valves 128 and 130 also have other hydraulic switching functions<br>
within the transmission 10, such that the on/off solenoids 124 and 126 are selectively operable to<br>
provide and remove hydraulic actuating pressure and prevent uncontrolled actuation of the<br>
mechanisms within the transmission 10.<br>
|0037] When the on/off solenoids 124 and 126 are actuated and the enable valves 128 and<br>
i 30 have charged the pressure supply lines 162 and 164 to the clutch actuator solenoids 120 and<br>
122, the first and second clutch mechanisms, generally indicated at 32 and 34, are controllable.<br>
The clutch actuator solenoids 120 and 122 are in fluid communication with the clutch<br>
mechanisms 32 and 34 through clutch pressure lines 170 and 172 respectively. Each of the<br>
clutch actuator solenoids 120 and 122 have a selectively movable valve member 176 disposed<br>
within a valve body 178 that has internal hydraulic flow passages 180 and 182. The clutch<br>
actuator solenoids 120 and 122 also have external hydraulic feedback passages 184. A solenoid<br>
188 selectively drives the valve member 176 operatively from its de-energized position biased to<br>
the left as illustrated in Figure 2 to its energized position which allows the flow of pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid to flow through internal passage 182 out the clutch pressure line 170, 172 to the<br>
clutch 32, 34.<br>
[0038] The clutch actuator solenoids 120 and 122 are current controlled, variable<br>
regulating valves, such that a given control current applied to solenoids 188 will result in a<br>
particular pressure output in the clutch pressure lines 170, 172. Regulation of the clutch actuator<br>
solenoids 120, 122 is further provided by the pressure feedback, through passages 184. Similarto<br>
the on/off solenoids 124and 126 and the enable valves 128 and 130, the clutch actuator solenoids<br>
120 and 122 have internal passages 180 to send residual pressure from the clutch pressure lines<br>
170 and 172 back to the sump 90 when the solenoid is de-energized.<br>
[0039] To control the larger scheme of the overall process of shifting gears in a dual<br>
clutch transmission, a higher level control method is necessary. That particular method is<br>
discussed in detail in the co-pending application. It controls the manner in which the torque is<br>
transferred across each of the two clutches of the dual clutch transmission during a gearshift and<br>
is briefly repeated here to clarify the method of the present invention. The higher level control<br>
method is generally indicated at 200 in Figure 3, wherein the first of the two clutches is the off-<br>
going clutch and the second of the two clutches is the on-coming clutch. This gearshift method,<br>
as previously discussed, is stored in a control device such as an ECU and operatively controls the<br>
functions of the shifting process by controlling the torque transfer across the clutches 32 and 34<br>
of the dual clutch transmission 10 for either a downshift or an upshift. The method begins at the<br>
start entry block 202 and includes the steps of determining when a shift has been commanded at<br>
process block 204, sensing the speed of the driven member of the off-going clutch at process<br>
block 206, determining the desired clutch torque/slip profile for the changeover of clutches<br>
during the shift at process block 208, and sensing the speed of the driven member of the on-<br>
coming clutch at process block 210.<br>
[0040] The determination of the desired clutch torque/slip profile is based on the<br>
application of any one of a variety of torque/slip profiles, which may be maintained in a lookup<br>
table or otherwise stored in accessible memory within the ECU. These torque/slip profiles are<br>
predetermined and are mathematically expressed as the change in clutch torque and slip over<br>
time. Different profiles may be used in different situations and for different gear changes. The<br>
profiles are derived based on the generally shift "feel" that is desired. However, it has been<br>
determined that the most desirable clutch torque/slip profile for the dual clutch transmission is<br>
the one which provides a linear ramp up and ramp down of the respective clutches. The linear<br>
profile provides a smooth and efficient transition from the off-going clutch to the on-coming<br>
clutch.<br>
[0041] A target engine speed profile is then determined at process block 212 based on the<br>
off-going clutch speed, the clutch torque/slip profile, and the on-coming clutch speed. The<br>
method then simultaneously controls the torque transfer across each clutch so that the torque<br>
output of the transmission will be changed over from the off-going clutch to the on-coming<br>
clutch by linearly decreasing the torque transferred across the off-going clutch while linearly<br>
increasing the torque transferred across the on-coming clutch in an inversely proportional rate to<br>
follow the clutch torque and slip profile (process block 208) and cause the engine to track the<br>
target engine speed profile at process block 214. In other words, the total torque for the clutch<br>
changeover is determined and as each clutch is controlled independently, the total torque is<br>
linearly apportioned between each clutch during the changeover. Then at process block 216, the<br>
method varies the pressure applied to the on-coming clutch, once the on-coming clutch is<br>
transferring all of the output torque, to cause the engine to continue to track the target engine<br>
speed profile so that vehicle speed is maintained<br>
[0042] More specifically, if the transmission is performing an upshift operation in<br>
response to an engine throttle position that is causing positive torque to occur, then the vehicle is<br>
accelerating or in a positively driven steady state. Positive torque is generated when the engine<br>
is providing power, and thus torque, to the transmission and drive train. Therefore, maintaining<br>
vehicle speed in this sense actually means maintaining the same rate of acceleration during the<br>
upshift so that the gear change is not felt by the occupant of the vehicle. Likewise, if a downshift<br>
is being performed in response to a lowered engine throttle position causing negative torque to<br>
occur, then the vehicle is decelerating. Negative torque is generated when the vehicle is slowing<br>
such that the vehicle's inertia, as delivered through the transmission, exceeds the torque provided<br>
by the engine so that the transmission is attempting to drive the engine. Maintaining vehicle<br>
speed in this sense actually means maintaining the same rate of deceleration during the downshift<br>
so that the gear change is not felt by the occupant of the vehicle. These two shifting situations<br>
are the ones that occur most commonly. In the first situation, the vehicle is accelerating (positive<br>
torque) and the transmission is upshifting through the gears in response. In the second situation,<br>
the engine throttle is reduced and the vehicle is decelerating (negative torque) so that the<br>
transmission would be downshifting in response. Referring to Figure 3, when the shift is<br>
completed and either the vehicle acceleration or deceleration is maintained at process step 216,<br>
then the method of the present invention exits at step 218.<br>
[0043] When discussing a target engine speed profile that is used to control the<br>
engagement of the clutches to regulate the speed of the engine, and thus the vehicle during the<br>
shift, the term "target engine speed" and its associated concepts may take on a number of<br>
connotations in common practice and the terminology used here should be clearly understood. In<br>
general use, the phrase "target engine speed" may be used in an "engine speed control" scheme or<br>
strategy. The term "engine speed control" as used herein means holding the engine to a specific<br>
speed (RPM), or limiting the engine to a specific speed, or controlling the engine speed (and thus,<br>
its acceleration) over its operating range. Thus, engine speed control using a target engine speed<br>
may use a target that is either a static point, or involve dynamic control. In this case, during the<br>
shift activity of the transmission, the method of the present invention provides target engine<br>
speeds that are in actuality constantly changing, or dynamic. Target engine speed profiles are<br>
based on the clutch speeds and the desired slip across the clutches. Thus, the engine speed is<br>
caused to track the target engine speed profile by the control of the torque transfer across the<br>
clutches of the dual clutch transmission.<br>
[0044] As previously mentioned, there are two general conditions of torque transfer<br>
across an engaged clutch that involve either positive or negative torque. Positive torque exists<br>
where the engine is providing power to the remainder of the drive train and negative torque exists<br>
where the inertia of the vehicle is providing greater energy to the drivetrain than the engine so<br>
that the transmission is attempting to drive the engine. It should be appreciated that a neutral<br>
torque condition may also exist where neither the engine nor the vehicle drivetrain are imparting<br>
a transfer of torque to one another.<br>
[0045] In the course of vehicle operation, the transmission will be called upon to upshift<br>
or downshift when either positive or negative torque is occurring. Thus, four particular shifting<br>
situations exist. In addition to the two shifting situations mentioned above (positive torque<br>
upshift and negative torque downshift), a positive torque downshift and a negative torque upshift<br>
may also be encountered. Generally speaking, a positive torque downshift will most likely occur<br>
in a vehicle "accelerate to pass" condition. This is where the engine throttle position is set to<br>
cause the engine and vehicle to accelerate or maintain a speed but it is desirable to rapidly<br>
accelerate to pass another vehicle. In this case, the engine throttle position will be maximized<br>
causing a commanded downshift to the next lower gear in an attempt to immediately increase the<br>
engine speed to place it in a higher torque generating RPM range.<br>
[0046] The negative torque upshift most often occurs when the vehicle is traveling<br>
downhill and the engine throttle position is reduced so that the vehicle is coasting and its inertia<br>
exceeds the engine torque output. In this case, the negative torque from the drive train and<br>
transmission is driving the engine causing it to increase in speed. In some situations this is<br>
effectively "engine braking" and may be a desired effect. However, if the braking effect becomes<br>
excessive so that the engine is driven undesirably high into its RPM range an upshift may be<br>
commanded, which will cause the transmission to shift into the next higher gear so that the<br>
engine is driven at a lesser speed. It should be appreciated that the conditions described above<br>
concerning the necessity for any particular shifting situation within the dual clutch transmission<br>
are used in an illustrative manner and other conditions may also exist that would precipitate like<br>
responses from the transmission.<br>
[0047] Although each of the four shifting situations differ in the required steps necessary<br>
to control and execute the particular gearshift event, each commonly requires the determination<br>
of a target engine speed profile. More specifically, the target engine speed profile for each<br>
gearshift situation consists of a first and second profile portion as defined by first and second<br>
time periods. In the case of positive torque upshifts and negative torque downshifts, the first time<br>
period and first target engine speed profile occur as the torque transferred across the on-coming<br>
and off-going clutches are linearly and proportionally changed over. Then, the second time<br>
period and second target engine speed profile allow the engine and the next selected gear to<br>
continue to smoothly and efficiently operate the vehicle in the same manner before the shift (i.e.<br>
accelerating or decelerating, respectively). In a reversed but similar manner, the first time period<br>
and first target engine speed profile of the positive torque downshifts and negative torque upshifts<br>
allow the engine speed to control the desired operation of the vehicle (i.e. accelerating or<br>
decelerating, respectively) before the clutch changeover occurs during the second time period<br>
under the second target engine speed profile. It should be appreciated that there are a number of<br>
separate and distinct method steps required to control the gearshifts in each of the four particular<br>
shifting situations mentioned above. The particular method steps arc discussed in greater detail<br>
in the co-pending application having U.S. Serial No. 10/371,381 and will not be repeated here<br>
except for general references to a positive torque upshifting event to assist in illustrating the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0048] In particular, the control of the torque transfer across the two clutches of the dual<br>
clutch transmission during a positive torque upshift event is graphically illustrated in figure 4. A<br>
graph of the relative speeds of the two clutches versus a relative time line is generally indicated at<br>
400 and a graph of the relative level of torque transfer of the two clutches versus the same<br>
relative time scale is generally indicated at 420. In the positive torque upshift, as described<br>
above, the generally increasing speed of the on-coming clutch is shown as line 404 and the<br>
generally increasing but much higher relative increasing speed of the off-going clutch is shown as<br>
line 406. The positive torque upshift will cause the delivery of the output torque of the engine to<br>
be changed over from the clutch driving the lower gear to the clutch driving the higher gear.<br>
Therefore, as the first time period at 408 and the first target engine speed profile at 410 are<br>
determined, the engine speed 412 is caused to track the first target engine speed profile 410. This<br>
occurs as the simultaneous linear clutch change over takes place. This is illustrated by the change<br>
in the on-coming and off-going clutch torque lines 422 and 424 of 420 during the first lime<br>
period 408.<br>
[0049] Then, the second time period at 414 and a second target engine speed profile at<br>
416 are determined, which causes the engine speed 412 to track the second target engine speed<br>
profile 416. The second target engine speed profile 416 and the subsequent change in engine<br>
speed is shown as decreasing due to an increase of the clutch pressure to draw the engine speed<br>
down to meet the rising speed of the on-coming clutch 404. The increased clutch pressure causes<br>
greater torque transfer, shown at 402, so that as engine speed decreases the increased torque<br>
transfer continues to maintain the acceleration of the vehicle. Finally, a decrease in the clutch<br>
pressure of the now fully engaged on-coming clutch allows the engine and vehicle to continue the<br>
acceleration as the engine and clutch speed become equal. This is shown at 405 where the<br>
control of the on-coming clutch torque 422 exits the second time period 414.<br>
[0050] Once a target engine speed profile for a particular shift event is determined by the<br>
higher level control method, the timing of the occurrences of physical stages of the shift become<br>
critical to ensure that the target engine speed will be tracked through both time periods and<br>
especially as the first time period ends and the second time period begins. This is true due to the<br>
fact that, although a profile has been determined, vehicle speed and engine acceleration effect<br>
how quickly the engine speed will change and respond to the torque transfer control of the<br>
clutches as executed by the higher level control method. For example, in the case of a positive<br>
torque upshift under hard or rapid acceleration, the rapid acceleration must be compensated for<br>
by changing the timing of the shift event. If there is no timing compensation, when the rapidly<br>
accelerating engine speed reaches the desired shift point it will continue to accelerate beyond the<br>
desired target engine speed profile as the shift event is in progress and the engine speed will be<br>
uncontrolled in regard to the desired second target engine speed profile in the second time period.<br>
Thus, in a rapid acceleration positive torque upshift, the shift event, and thereby the shift point,<br>
must begin earlier to cause the engine speed to accurately track the target engine speed profile.<br>
[0051] Aside from this example, the target engine speed profile determined by the higher<br>
level control method is most often generated for the particular shift event to provide the highest<br>
engine efficiency and smooth driving feel. It should be appreciated that there may also be<br>
particular applications in which the target engine speed profile may be generated for more<br>
performance output. Regardless, it is not only desirable to determine a compensation for the<br>
timing of the shift event to keep the engine speed from exceeding the target engine speed profile,<br>
it is particularly desirable to continuously determine an optimum shift point for the varying<br>
driving factors that are occurring prior to a shift command. In practice, it has been determined<br>
that the effects of vehicle acceleration and more specifically vehicle acceleration in terms of load<br>
placed on the engine by road conditions are critical factors in determining optimum shift point.<br>
Thus, the method of the present invention dynamically determines the optimum shift point for<br>
each possible shift event, and when a shift is commanded provides the determined shift point to<br>
the higher level control method to ensure that the engine accurately tracks the target engine speed<br>
profile.<br>
[0052] It should be appreciated that the time line illustrated in Figure 4 correlates with<br>
and is relative to the acceleration and the speed of the vehicle, such that the more rapid the<br>
acceleration the more compressed the time line. This means that although the target engine<br>
profiles will have the same general shape they will have greater or sharper slopes. Conversely,<br>
slower vehicle acceleration will expand the time line and the target engine speed profiles will<br>
have lesser and shallower slopes. This graphically illustrates the necessity for the method of the<br>
present invention, as the proper timing of the underlying shift events cause the resultant engine<br>
speed (412 in Figure 4) to accurately track the target engine speed profiles determined by the<br>
higher level control method.<br>
|0053] To control the timing of the shift events of a dual clutch transmission, the method<br>
of the present invention includes the steps of sensing the current output speed of the driven<br>
member of the transmission., determining the time required to complete each possible shift event<br>
within the transmission, and determining an output speed modification value for each possible<br>
shift event. The method then determines a shift point output speed for each possible shift event<br>
by summing the determined output speed modification value with the current output speed. Then<br>
the method provides the determined shift point output speed at which to perform the shift when a<br>
shift has been commanded.<br>
[0054] More specifically, the method of the present invention is generally indicated at<br>
520 in Figure 5, and begins at the start entry block 522. Block 524 senses the current output<br>
speed of the driven member of the transmission. The current output speed is used as a reference<br>
in the method steps as it is relatively stable during the shift event and is an indictor of the effects<br>
of the changing engine speed. The method continues at block 526 in which the acceleration of<br>
the vehicle is determined. The acceleration may be determined by any of a variety of known<br>
methods including but not limited to calculating the value based on the repetitively sensing the<br>
output speed and determining its rate of change over time. In this manner, the determined<br>
acceleration includes the effects of the current load on the vehicle and the engine.<br>
[0055] The method then determines the total time required to perform each possible shift<br>
event as generally indicated at 528, which encompass process blocks 532 through 540. It should<br>
be appreciated that this determination may be made for all gearshift events within the<br>
transmission (e.g. first to second, second to third, fourth to third, etc). However, in the preferred<br>
embodiment, the time determinations are only made for the next higher gear and the next lower<br>
gear from the presently engaged gear. Likewise, as will be discussed below, the preferred<br>
embodiment of the method of the present invention is continuously re-determining the proper<br>
timing for a shift to both the next higher gear and the next lower gear without waiting for the<br>
higher level control method to first determine what type of shift will occur next. Thus, it should<br>
be further appreciated that the method of the present invention may be adapted to just determine<br>
the shift timing for the next higher or the next lower shift once the higher level control method<br>
has made a determination as to what type of shift is about to happen.<br>
[0056] To arrive at the total time required to perform each possible shift event, the time<br>
required for separate portions of the shift event must be first determined. First, the time required<br>
to perform a clutch changeover to the next higher and next lower gear is determined as generally<br>
indicated at 530, which includes process blocks 532 and 534. Specifically, block 532 determines<br>
the fill time of the on-coming clutch. Then, block 534 determines the time required to<br>
changeover the torque transfer from the off-going clutch to the on-coming clutch for the next<br>
higher and next lower gear. It should be appreciated that the clutch fill times typically remain the<br>
same and the clutch change over times may be predetermined to follow a particular clutch<br>
torque/slip profile (as previously discussed). Thus, the clutch changeover times may be<br>
predetermined or known values stored in a lookup table. On the other hand, these times may be<br>
actual measured values that are operationally observed and updated over time. Second, decision<br>
block 536 then determines if a synchronization has already been performed. If a synchronizer has<br>
already been pre-selected and engaged then the "Yes path to block 538 is followed. If a<br>
synchronizer is not presently engaged, the "No" path is followed to block 540 which determines<br>
the time required to complete the synchronization of the next higher and next lower gear set. It<br>
should be appreciated that in certain applications it may be desirable to predict which<br>
synchronizer will be called upon to be engaged in the next shift event and thereby pre-select (i.e.<br>
pre-engage) it. The control methodology for synchronizer pre-selection requires predictions to be<br>
made as to the possibly of an upcoming shift and to whether the shift will be up or down. It<br>
should be further appreciated that this methodology is outside of the scope of this application and<br>
is not otherwise discussed herein.<br>
[0057] In determining the synchronization times, it should be appreciated that each of the<br>
synchronizer engagement times may either be predetermined or known values stored in a lookup<br>
table, or actual measured values that are operationally observed and updated over time. More<br>
specifically, the method step of determining the time required to complete synchronization may<br>
include additional steps to allow the time value to be learned as a historical value that is adaptive<br>
over time. For example, if it is desirable to determine the historical synchronization time of each<br>
synchronizer engagements, the following additional steps are also included. First, an initially<br>
measured value of time required to complete a particular gear synchronization when a gear<br>
change is made is initially stored in a database. Then, the value of time required to complete the<br>
same synchronization in the transmission is measured the next time the same synchronization is<br>
made. The newly measured synchronization time is averaged with the initially stored<br>
synchronization time to determine an average synchronization time, which is then is stored in the<br>
database in place of the initial value. The averaged synchronization time is continuously re-<br>
determined each time the synchronizer is engaged. The latest stored average synchronization<br>
time is referenced in the database to identify the value of the synchronization time when the value<br>
is required by the higher level method steps thereby providing a gear synchronization time that is<br>
historical and adaptive.<br>
[0058] Regardless of the manner in which the synchronizer time is determined, the<br>
method steps then continue with block 538. Block 538 determines the total time required to<br>
complete each possible shift by summing the determined time required to perform a clutch<br>
changeover to the next higher and next lower gear (blocks 532 and 534) with the determined time<br>
required to complete synchronization of the respective next higher or next lower gear (block<br>
540). Using the determined possible shift event total times (block 538) and the determined<br>
acceleration (block 526), block 542 determines an output speed modification value for<br>
performing shifts to the next higher and to the next lower gear. Then block 544 determines the<br>
optimum shift point to cause the engine to track the target engine speed profile. The shift point is<br>
determined as a particular value of output speed of the transmission and is referred to herein as<br>
the shift point output speed. Block 544 determines the shift point output speed for each possible<br>
shift event (to next higher and next lower gear) by summing the determined output speed<br>
modification value (block 538) with the current output speed (block 524).<br>
[0059] The transmission or the higher level transmission control method is monitored<br>
through decision block 546 to determine if a shift (higher or lower) has been commanded. If it is<br>
determined that a shift is commanded, the "Yes" path is followed to block 548 which provides<br>
the determined shift point output speed at which to perform the particular shift event (higher or<br>
lower) to the higher level control method, the ECU, or other higher level control device which<br>
executes the shift event. Block 550 then allows the method steps to complete and return to the<br>
start/entry block 522 to prepare for the next shift event.<br>
[0060] If decision block 546 determines that a shift has not been commanded the "No<br>
path is taken back to block 524 to sense the current output speed and continue the method steps.<br>
In this manner, it should be appreciated that the method of the present invention is a cyclical and<br>
dynamic process such that in the preferred embodiment of the present invention the method steps<br>
are continuously repeated. Thus, there is a continuous re-determining of an output speed<br>
modification value for each possible shift event and a continuous re-dctcrmining of a shift point<br>
output speed for each possible shift event by summing the determined output speed modification<br>
value with the current output speed until a shift has been commanded.<br>
[0061] It should be appreciated that the above discussion, which utilized the positive<br>
torque upshift situation to describe the determination of target engine speed profile is illustrative<br>
and non-limiting in regard to the particular control of the timing of the shift events by the present<br>
invention. In the above example using the positive torque upshift situation, the upshift has been<br>
predicted by the higher level control methods with the presumption of an upcoming shift event<br>
based on factors not considered by the present invention. In this manner, target engine speed<br>
profiles will always be predetermined by the higher level control method under those<br>
presumptions. However, it should be noted that, as disclosed above, the method steps of the<br>
present invention continuously re-determine optimum shift point output speeds for both the next<br>
higher and next lower gear from the currently engaged gear. Thus, the method of the present<br>
invention is not limited under the predetermined shift presumptions of the higher level control<br>
method. In fact, the method steps of the present invention allow for the timing control of either<br>
an upshift or a downshift at any given moment based on its separate determinations of output<br>
speed and acceleration regardless of the predeterminations of the higher level control methods.<br>
Thus, in the event that conditions cause the higher level control method to spontaneously<br>
predetermine a different or opposite shifting situation, the method steps of the present invention<br>
have the timing control of that contingency covered.<br>
[0062] Therefore, the method of the present invention overcomes the drawbacks and<br>
disadvantages of all prior dual clutch transmission shift control methods by providing proper<br>
timing of the shift event to allow the engine to track the target engine speed and provide smooth<br>
and efficient shifting of the dual clutch transmission. The method of the present invention<br>
provides dynamically determined timing control to the higher level control method, which<br>
executes the shifting events. This improves overall efficiency, drivability, and comfort of the<br>
vehicle when compared with prior methods.<br>
[0063] The invention has been described in an illustrative manner. It is to be understood<br>
that the terminology which has been used is intended to be in the nature of words of description<br>
rather than of limitation. Many modifications and variations of the invention are possible in light<br>
of the above teachings. Therefore, within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be<br>
practiced other than as specifically described.<br>
