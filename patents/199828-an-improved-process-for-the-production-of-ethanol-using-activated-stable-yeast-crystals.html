				<td>Ethanol demand is ever increasing mainly because of its utilization as organic solvent and as starting compound for production of many organic solvents. In addition, it can replace the natural petroleum sources as energy fuels. Conventional method of ethanol production is performed mainly by batch fermentation, which requires addition of fresh yeast for every batch as seed culture and needs maintenance of yeast cultures, thus the process is costly and requires special expertise in microbiology. In this context, the recently developed yeast crystals solve some of the above mentioned problems. However, the developed biocatalytic crystals upon fermentation tend to float on the surface of the fermentation broth during fermentation and thereby increase the fermentation time and reduce the rate of alcohol fermentation. The novelty lying in the present invention is use of modified conventional batch reactor for fermentation with activated yeast crystals reduces the fermentation time drastically and enhances the rate of ethanol production.</td>

				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the production of ethanol using activated stable yeast crystals in modified conventional batch reactor. This invention more particularly relates to the reduction of fermentation time without compromising on the ethanol production in a batch process and improved the rate of ethanol production.<br>
Ethanol is one of the largest volume chemicals produced biotechnologically since several decades. Its demand is ever increasing mainly due to the role of ethanol as a solvent, germicide, antifreezent and as chemical raw material for the production of various organic compounds such as acetaldehyde, acetic acid, butadiene and ethylene etc. Moreover, its importance as a valuable alternative source as transportation fuel has renewed interest in development of improved fermentation process to achieve higher ethanol yields.<br>
Even today, ethanol production is carried out by conventional batch fermentation techniques using Sachhromyces cereviceae cultures. This process of ethanol fermentation with yeast requires maintenance of yeast cultures and pre-fermentation to get a required quantity of yeast biomass for main fermentation. Hitherto several attempts have been made to enhance the ethanol production with free and immobilized yeast cells. The free cell fermentation is generally performed, using Saccharomyces cereviceae in diluted molasses solutions in a batch reactor for a period of 24-48 hours and requires development of yeast for every batch [S.V. Ramakrishna, V.P. Sreedharan and P. Prema. In: Bioreactor Immobilized Enzymes and Cells: Fundamentals and Applications (Ed MoodYoung), Elsevier Appl. Sci., Amsterdam, 1988, 251-260]. Low productivity, higher fermentation time, higher operating and capital investment are some of the major disadvantages of the batch process [D. Das, R.G. Nandkishor, K. Murali and P.S. Gupta J.Ferment.Bioengg. 1993, 75, 132-137; D. Weuster-Botz Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol, 1993, 39, 679-684]. Many alternative fermentation strategies such as Boinot fermentation process [J. M. Lagomasino, Internationl Sugar Journal, 1949, 51, 338-342], continuous flow fermentation [J. L. McCarthy, In: Industrial fermentations (Ed.L. A. Underkofler and R. J. Hickey), 1954, Vol.1, p 95; Chem. Pub. Co., New York], high cell densities in the fermentor, larger throughput by continuous mode of operation using cell recycle [C.W. Lee and H.N. Chang Biotehcnol. Bioengg, 1987, 29, 1105-1112],<br>
extractive fermentation [M. Minier and G. Goma, Biotehcnol. Bioengg. 1982, 24, 1565-1579] and whole cell immobilization by various techniques [S.V. Ramakrishna and R.S. Prakasham Current Science, 1999, 77, 87-100] have been attempted to enhance volumetric productivity of the system. But these methodologies suffer from the fact that the yeast cells has to be added in every batch. Continuous fermentation with cell recycles [E. J. DelRosario, K. J. Lee and P. L. Rogers, Biotechnology Bioengineering, 1979, 21, 1477; T.K. Ghosh and R.D. Tyagi Biotechnol Bioengg, 1979, 21; 1387; G.H. Gil, W.J. Jones and T.G. Tornabene Enzyme Microb. Technol., 1991, 13; 390] and vacuume fermentation [G.R. Cysewski and C.R. Wilke Biotechnol. Bioengg, 1977, 19; 1125] have resulted in substantial increase in the productivity. However, the cell recycling system involves considerable cost input for separation of yeast cells from the fermented broth. One of the attractive alternate method received wide attention is the high cell density fermentation. In this regard the use of immobilized yeast cells, instead of free cells, has been attempted by several researchers [R. Jamuna and S. V. Ramakrishna Biomass Bioenergy, 1992, 3; 117-119]. Various types of reactor configurations have been attempted to produce ethanol with entrapped cells [F. Godia, C. Casad, and C. Sola Process Biochem, 1987, 43-48]. One of the major limitations with entrapped cells is that the gas generated during fermentation get entrapped in the gel particles which in turn lowers the density and disintegrates the beads [S.V. Ramakrishna, V.P. Sreedharan and P. Prema. In: Bioreactor Immobilized Enzymes and Cells: Fundamentals and Applications (Ed MoodYoung), Elsevier Appl. Sci., Amsterdam, 1988, 251-260]. Recently, S. V. Ramakrishna et al (1999) have developed stable yeast crystals and showed that they can be recycled several time [S. V. Ramakrishna, R. S. Prakasham and P. Komariah, Indian Patent Application No. 186/DEL/2000; US Application No. 09/538181]. The major limitation with yeast crystals is that they tend to float on the surface of the fermentation broth during fermentation thereby decreasing the rate of ethanol production. The novelty lying in the present invention is the use of activated stable yeast crystals in a modified batch bioreactor, which reduces the fermentation time drastically and enhances the rate of ethanol production.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the production of ethanol using novel activated clustered yeast crystals in a modified conventional batch reactor.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to enhance the rate of ethanol production.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to improve the existing distillery production capacity more than 250% without expansion and compromising on the ethanol yield.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a cost effective process for the production of ethanol.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to reduce the fermentation time.<br>
The novelty lies in the present invention is the reduction of fermentation time from 28-36 hours to 8-16 hours with the use of activated stable yeast crystals in a modified conventional batch reactor and considerable improvement on the rate of ethanol production. The present invention also provides improvement of existing distillery capacity to the tune of 250% without much machinery expansion and improved alcohol yield per tone of molasses used compared to conventional free cell fermentation.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the production of ethanol using activated stable yeast crystals in a modified conventional batch reactor which comprises preparing low strength molasses solution having specific gravity in the range of 1.030 to 1.060 by mixing molasses with water, incubating the stable yeast crystals in the above said low strength molasses solution for a period of 4-48 hours at a temperature ranging between 24-36°C to obtain the activated stable yeast crystals, separating the activated stable yeast crystals by known methods, preparing the molasses fermentation broth by conventional methods in a modified fermentation vessel fitting with a low speed mechanical stirrer and estimating the initial sugar concentration in the fermentation broth by known methods, adding activated stable yeast crystals to the above<br>
said fermentation broth in the range of 0.5 to 2.0% W/V and carrying out the fermentation for 8-16 hours at a temperature in the range of 28-40°C, terminating the fermentation when the specific gravity of the fermentation broth reaches to a range of 1.014-1.045, separating the activated yeast crystals from fermented broth by conventional methods and recovering the ethanol from fermentation broth by known methods.<br>
hi an embodiment of the present invention the activated stable yeast crystals added in fermentation broth is preferably in the range of 0.5 -1.5% (W/V).<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the activated stable yeast crystals are separated from the molasses solution by draining out the solution or straining through a mesh or perforated bottoms.<br>
hi the present invention, the low strength molasses solution having the specific gravity in the rage of 1.030 to 1.060 is<br>
prepared by mixing the known quantity of molasses and water by conventional methods such as dilution, mechanical mixing etc.<br>
hi the present invention, stable yeast crystals were prepared as per the methodology given in our earlier patent [S. V. Ramakrishna, R. S. Prakasham and P. Komariah, Indian Patent Application No. 186/DEL/2000; US Application No. 09/538181].<br>
