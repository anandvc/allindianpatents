				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a microcellular polyurethane foam and a process of making the foam.<br>
Background<br>
Polyurethanes are extremely versatile materials and have been used in a wide variety of applications such as foam insulation, car seats and abrasion resistant coatings. Polyurethanes are used in a wide variety of forms, for example non-cellular materials such as elastomers; and cellular materials such as low density flexible foams, high density flexible foams, and microcellular foams. Microcellular foams have been used for energy absorbing bumper mountings and auxiliary suspension units for wheels, and in particular in shoe soles.<br>
Microcellular polyurethane foams used in shoe soles require a wide range of properties such as resistance and durability in actual use, combined with high flexibility, optimal impact resilience', low weight, high thermal insulation and cushioning. There is a need for microcellular polyurethane foams to provide an improvement in one or more of the aforementioned properties'. In particular, known shoe soling materials tend to have insufficient flexibility on repeated flexing at low temperature (due to strain hardening), and hydrolytic instability.<br>
Review of the prior art<br>
EP-0795572-A is directed to the use of a polyester poiyol, derived from terephthalic acid and adipic acid, to produce polyurethane foam for shoe soles,<br>
US-A-585S372 is directed to a microcellular polyurethane shoe sole component formed from isocyanate-terminated prepolymers derived from polyoxypropylene dials.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
We have now surprisingly discovered a microcellular polyurethane foam which reduces or substantially overcomes at least one of the aforementioned problems.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a microcellular polyurethane foam obtainable by reacting a polyisocyanate, a polyester formed from a dimer fatty acid and/or dimer fatty diol, and a chain extender.<br>
The invention also provides a process for preparing a microcellular polyurethane foam which comprises (i) reacting a polyisocyanate with a polyester formed from a dimer fatty acid and/or dimer fatty diol, to form an isocyanate-terminated prepolymer, and (ii) reacting the prepolymer with a chain extender.<br>
The invention further provides an isocyanate-terminated prepolymer which is the reaction product of a polyisocyanate and a polyester which is the reaction product of dimer fatty acid, adipic acid and diethylene glycol.<br>
The invention still further provides a shoe sole comprising a microcellular polyurethane foam obtainable by reacting a polyisocyanate, a polyester formed from a dimer fatty acid and/or dimer fatty diol, and a chain extender.<br>
The polyester used in the present invention is formed from, ie comprises the reaction product of, at least one dimer fatty acid and/or dimer fatty diol and/or equivalent thereof. Polyester is normally produced in a condensation reaction between at least one polycarboxylic acid and at least one polyol. Dicarboxylie acids and diols are preferred. The preferred dicarboxylie acid component of the polyester used in the present invention preferably comprises at least one dimer fatty acid.<br>
I he term dimer fatty acid is well known in the art and refers to the dimerisation product of mono- or polyunsaturated fatty acids and/or esters thereof. Preferred dimer fatty acids are dimers of C10 to C30, more preferably C12 to C24, particularly C14to C22, and especially C18 alkyl chains. Suitable dimer fatty acids include the dimerisation products of oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, palmitoleic acid, and elaidic acid. The<br><br>
dimerisation products of the unsaturated fatty acid mixtures obtained in the hydrolysis of natural fats and oils, e.g. sunflower oil, soybean oil, olive oil, rapeseed oil, cottonseed oil and tall oil, may also be used. Hydrogenated, for example by using a nickel catalyst, dimer fatty acids may also be employed.<br>
In addition to the dimer fatty acids, dimerisation usually results in varying amounts of oligomerie fatty acids (so-called "trimer") and residues of monomeric fatty acids (so-called "monomer"), or esters thereof, being present. The amount of monomer can, for example, be reduced by distillation. Suitable dimer fatty acids have a dicarboxylic (or dimer) content of greater than 60%, preferably greater than 75%, more preferably in the range from 80 to 96%, particularly 85 to 92%, and especially 87 to 89% by weight. The trimer content is suitably less than 40%, preferably in the range from 2 to 25%, more preferably 5 to 15%, particularly 7 to 13%, and especially 9 to 11% by weight. The monomer content is preferably less than 10%, more preferably in the range from 0.2 to 5%, particularly 0.5 to 3%, and especially 1 to 2% by weight. All of the above % by weight values are based on the total weight of trimer, dimer and monomer present.<br>
The dicarboxylic acid component of the polyester preferably also comprises non-dimeric dicarboxylic acids (hereinafter referred to as non-dimeric acids). The non-dimeric acids may be aliphatic or aromatic (such as phthalic acid, isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid), and include dicarboxylic acids and the esters, preferably alkyl esters, thereof, preferably linear dicarboxylic acids having terminal carboxyl groups having a carbon chain in the range from 2 to 20, more preferably 6 to 12 carbon atoms, such as adipic acid, glutaric acid, succinic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, heptane dicarboxylic acid, octane dicarboxylic acid, nonane dicarboxylic acid, decane dicarboxylic acid, undecane dicarboxylic acid, dodecane dicarboxylic acid and higher homologs thereof. Adipic acid is particularly preferred.<br>

Diethylene glycol is a particularly preferred diol.<br>
The polyol component may also comprise a dimer fatty diol.

The microcellular polyurethane foam according to the present invention is suitably defined as an elastomer of cellular structure containing mostly closed cells which are difficult to see with the naked eye (cell size of the order of approximately less than 0.1 mm). The foam preferably has a density (measured as described herein) in the range from 0.2 to 0.9, more preferably 0.25 to 0,7, particularly 0.3 to 0.6, and especially 0.35 to 0.5 gem-3.<br>

The microcellular polyurethane foam according to the present invention is suitable for use, inter alia, as shock absorbers/"spring aids" for automotive suspension, tyres (energy absorbing wheels for buggies, trollies) and technical parts (car seat components), and is particularly suitable for use in shoes. The foam can be used in dual density outsoles, single density boots, single density casual/formal, single density sandals, single density insoles, and especially in dual and single density midsoles.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.<br>
In this specification the following test methods have been used.<br>
(a)	For Polyester and Prepolymer<br>
(i) The glass transition temperature (Tg) was measured by Differential Scanning<br>
Calorimetry (DSC) at a scan rate of 20°C/minute using a Mettler DSC30.<br>
(ii) Molecular weight number average was determined by end group analysis.<br>
(iii) The hydroxyl value is defined as the number of mg of potassium hydroxide<br>
equivalent to the hydroxyl content of 1g of sample, and was measured by acetylation<br>
followed by hydrolysation of excess acetic anhydride. The acetic acid formed was<br>
subsequently titrated with an ethanolic potassium hydroxide solution.<br>
(iv) The acid value is defined as the number of mg of potassium hydroxide required to<br>
neutralise the free fatty acids in 1g of sample, and was measured by direct titration with<br>
a standard potassium hydroxide solution.<br>
(v) The isocyanate value is defined as the weight % content of isocyanate in the sample<br>
and was determined by reacting with excess dibutylamine, and back titrating with<br>
hydrochloric acid.<br>
(b)	For Microcellular Polyurethane Foam<br>
(i) Density<br>
Determined by measuring the mass and volume of the specimen (to within 1%<br>
accuracy) and calculating density (-mass / volume).<br>
(ii) Hardness<br>
Measured using a Shore A meter on a 10 mm thick sample. Mean value of 10 readings<br>
calculated.<br>
 (iii) Tensile strength<br>
Determined according to ISO 37/DIN 53504 using a Z82B29 sample die. (iv) Elongation at break<br>
Measured according to ISO 37/DIN 53504 using a Z82B29 sample die. (v) Tear Strength<br>
Determined using a procedure analogous to ASTM D3574 test F, except that the sample used was 100x25x10 mm with a 40 mm cut in the centre of the 25x10 mm face, parallel to the 25x100 mm face. The crosshead speed was 200 mm/min. The maximum load from the start of tearing over a 20 mm tear was recorded, and the tear strength calculated by dividing by the thickness (25 mm), (vi) Impact resilience<br>
Measured according to ASTM D3574 (falling ball rebound test), (vii) Hydrolysis<br>
Samples were aged by placing dumbells of the material in a climate chamber at 70°C and &gt;98% relative humidity for periods of 2 and 4 weeks. The tensile strength and elongation at break of the "aged" samples were determined as above and the values compared to the original figures (on percentage retention terms).<br>
All the above tests were performed after the foam samples had been conditioned for a minimum of 24 hours, undeflected and undistorted at 23°C and 50% relative humidity.<br>
Examples<br>
Example I<br>
(a)	902 g of adipic acid, 902 g of PRIPOL 1017 (trade mark, ex Uniqema (dimer acid)) and 1051 g of diethylene glycol were reacted at 225°C in the presence of 50 ppm of tetrabutyl titanate catalyst. On completion of the reaction, the excess diethylene glycol was removed in vacuo and the dimerate polyester product was purified by filtration. Hydroxyl value was found by titration to be 54 mg KOH/g.<br>
(b)	586 g of the polyester produced above was placed in a flask and dried by heating for 2 hours at 120°C and 50 mbar. 860 g of flake pure MDI (ex Bayer) was added at a temperature of 50 to 60°C over 1 hour period at atmospheric pressure. 161 g of modified MDI (Suprasec 2021, ex Huntsman Polyurethanes) was then added, and the<br>
reaction was heated at 55°C for a further hour, and then at 85°C for a further two hours. The product was discharged and stored at 50°C. The prepolymer material was found to have an isocyanate content of 18.5% NCO.<br>
(c)	A chain extender composition was prepared by mixing the following components in<br>
the following ratio:<br>
