DESCRIPTION METALLIZED MULTILAYER FILM<br>
The present invention relates to the field of packaging using, in particular, traxiaily oriented or unoriented multilayer films rnetaliized and laminated with a baxiaiiy oriented polypropylene (BOPP) film or biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthala-e (BOPET) film, which is printed or not printed, exhibiting very good adhesion of the layers to each other even when the films are weakened by a weld, ""he invention applies inter alia to packages of a sachet, bag, pouch or packet type, produced from these welded films, the composition of which allows the package to be correctly opened manually. Non-limiting mention may be made, for example, of packets of crisps, biscuits, sweets or meat.<br>
Docirnent WO 01/34389 discloses a package using a multilayer film having oxygei and water-vapour barrier properties, but this package has the drawback ,vhen it is desired to ooen it of not opening cleanly. This is because there is :ielamination between the metal layer and the polypropylene layer on which the metal layer is deposited.<br>
tt is important in the field of packaging to nave packages that open cleanly h exeiing a moderate force, so that they can be opened both by an adult and by a :;hild. In addition, it is necessary for the films making up the packages to have oxygen and water-vapour barrier properties so as to preserve the foodstuffs, /./hethar solid or liquid, edible or otherwise, laying inside the package.<br>
The Applicant has now found a film that exhibits strong adhesion between a metal layer and a layer having a composition based (i) predominantly on polypropylene and (ii) to a minor extent on a biend either of cografted :;olyetiylenes (abbreviated to g-PE) or of cografted polyethylene and polypropylene, and (iii) optionaliy of ungrafted polyethylene or elastomer. This film makes it possible inter alia to manufacture packages closed by a band of welding :if the said film, the opening taking place within this same band. Unlike the prior hat, there is no preferential delamination or peeling between the metal and PP i ayers to the detriment of the opening of the package within the welding band. This is because the package according to the invention opens cleanly within the welding b;;nd .without there being any damage to the multilayer structure ijlsewhere.<br><br>

An identical force (f) is then applied to these two packets on bach wide of the region adjoining the welding bancs (5a) so as to open the said :acke:s. It has been found that, by exerting the same force (f) on each side of the : acke.s in the directions indicated in the figures, different results are obtained depending :n whether the packet is one produced using a film according to the : rior art or a packet produced using a film according to the invention.<br>
i the case of a bag or packet of Figure 2, it is obser/ed that there is oeiam nation, :hat is to say separation, of the metallized layer (11) from the layers ;12), (13) and (14), which remain bonded together. It may therefore*be stated that ;le force to dfclaminate the layer (11) is less than the force needed to break the welding be.id (5a). As a result, the bag in this case is difficult to open, the -netallized l^ysr (11) debonding first.<br>
1 the case of Figure 3, no debonding of the layers (1), (2), (3) and (4) is observed, rather a failure within the welding band of the bag, resulting in the packer being opened via the edges (5b). The adhesive strength of the metal layer ■'11) is; much greater than the force needed to break the welding band (5a)f causing the b
Film specimens 1 to 8 (see TABLE 1 below) were produced, these having a 'Multilayer structure of the BOPP(approximately 20 jim)/ink layer/liquid adhesive ^yer/MCPF' film (approximately 25 jxm) type.<br>
The MCPP film had a 4-layer structure, as shown in Figure 1, namely;<br><br>
      Al layer (1) having a thickness of 250 angstroms;<br>
	layer (2) having a thickness of 3 urn, comprising:<br>
&gt;	X% by weight of a blend (A), which itself comprises 25% by weight of netallocene PE (CI) of density d=0.870 with 1-octene as comonomer and of LLDPE (C2) of density d=0,920 with 1-butene as comonomer, the (C1)/(C2) blend being grafted with maleic anhydride with a degree of grafting of 0,8%, s.nd 75% by weight of LLDPE (D) with 1-butene as comonomer and c =0.9 10,<br>
&gt;	Y% by weight of PP homopolymer (B) having an MFI=7 and c =0.900 and<br>
&gt;	The value of X being indicated in the second column of TABLE 1 and the value of Y being equal to 100 - X;<br>
	layer (3) having a thickness of 17 urn of PP homopolymer having an MFl=7<br>
and d"0.900;<br>
•	'ayer {4) having a thickness of 5 ^m of propylene/ethylene/butylene<br>
■Jsrpolymer PP with predominantly propylene; MF!=7, d=0.900; and flexurai<br>
'^odulJS = 1000 mPa; and<br>
i id expressed in g/cm3 and measured according to the ASTM D790 standard = 1; 19C0 mPa and MFI or meltflow index expressed in g/10 min according to the ASTM D 1238 standard at 230*C].<br>
Tne ayers (1), (3) and (4) are the same in the case of specimens 1 to 8. ')nly the layer (2) differs through the proportions X and Y expressed in % by weight. Sealed bags v^ere then manufactured and peel force then measured in :/15nim.<br>
It was found that, in the case of compositions comprising 5 to 50% of blend<br>
A), the layer i2) failed, as shown in Figure 3, the Al layer being strongly bonded<br>
;D the layer (2), whereas in the cases indicated by (*), the interface between the Ai<br>
syer and the layer (2) failed, as illustrated in Figure 2, the Al layer beinq bonded<br>
•nore weakly to the layer (2).<br>
The films comprising a layer (2). with an amount of the blend (A) between 5 •ind 50% are therefore suitable for the manufacture of bags, sachets, pockets and rackets according to the invention.<br><br><br><br>
