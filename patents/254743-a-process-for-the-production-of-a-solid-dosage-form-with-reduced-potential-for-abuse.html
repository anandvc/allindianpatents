Process for the production of an abuse-proofed dosage form<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of an abuse-proofed solid dosage<br>
form, in which there is added to a formulation mixture containing, apart from one or more<br>
active ingredients with potential for abuse (A) and optionally physiologically acceptable<br>
auxiliary substances (B) and at least one synthetic or natural polymer (C), which exhibits a<br>
breaking strength of at least 500 N,<br>
a)	a solvent for the polymer (C) at least in quantities such that the formulation<br>
mixture is uniformly moistened,<br>
b)	the composition which has been at least moistened in this manner is optionally<br>
divided into sub-portions,<br>
c)	the portion(s) are dried and<br>
d)	shaped to yield the dosage form<br>
Many pharmaceutical active ingredients, in addition to having excellent activity in their<br>
appropriate application, also have potential for abuse, i.e. they can be used by an abuser to<br>
bring about effects other than those intended.<br>
Opiates, for example, which are highly active in combating severe to very severe pain, are<br>
frequently used by abusers to induce a state of narcosis or euphoria.<br>
In order to make abuse possible, the corresponding dosage forms, such as tablets or capsules<br>
are comminuted, for example ground in a mortar, by the abuser, the active ingredient is<br>
extracted from the resultant powder using a preferably aqueous liquid and the resultant<br>
solution, optionally after being filtered through cotton wool or cellulose wadding, is<br>
administered parenterally, in particular intravenously. An additional phenomenon of this kind<br>
of administration, in comparison with abusive oral administration, is a further accelerated<br>
increase in active ingredient levels giving the abuser the desired effect, namely the "kick" or<br>
"rush". This kick is also obtained if the powdered dosage form is administered nasally, i.e. is<br>
sniffed.<br><br>
Since delayed-release oral dosage forms containing active ingredients with potential for abuse<br>
conventionally do not give rise to the kick desired by the abuser even when taken orally in<br>
abusively high quantities, such dosage forms are also comminuted and extracted.<br>
US-A-4,070,494 proposed adding a swellable agent to the dosage form in order to prevent<br>
abuse. When water is added to extract the active ingredient, this agent swells and ensures that<br>
the filtrate separated from the gel contains only a small quantity of active ingredient.<br>
The multilayer tablet disclosed in WO 95/20947 is based on a similar approach to preventing<br>
parenteral abuse, said tablet containing the active ingredient with potential for abuse and at<br>
least one gel former, each in different layers.<br>
WO 03/015531 A2 discloses another approach to preventing parenteral abuse. A dosage form<br>
containing an analgesic opioid and a dye as an aversive agent is described therein. The colour<br>
released by tampering with the dosage form is intended to discourage the abuser from using<br>
the dosage form which has been tampered with.<br>
Another known option for complicating abuse involves adding antagonists to the active<br>
ingredients to the dosage form, for example naloxone or naltexone in the case of opioids, or<br>
compounds which cause a physiological defence response, such as for example ipecacuanha<br>
(ipecac) root.<br>
Since, however, as in the past, it is in most cases necessary for the purposes of abuse to<br>
pulverise the dosage form, it was the object of the present invention to provide a process for<br>
the production of dosage forms containing active ingredients with potential for abuse, which,<br>
when correctly administered, ensure the desired, preferably therapeutic action, but from which<br>
the active ingredients cannot be converted into a form suitable for abuse simply by<br>
pulverisation.<br>
Said object has been achieved by the provision of the process according to the invention for<br>
the production of a solid dosage form with at least reduced potential for abuse which is<br>
characterised in that<br><br>
a)	there is added to a formulation mixture containing at least one active ingredient<br>
with potential for abuse (A) and at least one synthetic or natural polymer (C),<br>
which exhibits a breaking strength of at least 500 N, a solvent for the polymer<br>
(C) at least in quantities such that the formulation mixture is uniformly<br>
moistened<br>
b)	the composition which has been at least moistened in this manner is optionally<br>
divided into sub-portions,<br>
c)	the portion(s) are dried and<br>
d)	shaped to yield the dosage form.<br>
By using polymers having the stated minimum breaking strength (measured as stated in the<br>
application), preferably in quantities such that the dosage form also exhibits such a minimum<br>
breaking strength of at least 500 N, preferably of at least 1000 N, it is possible to prevent<br>
pulverisation of the dosage form with conventional means and thus considerably to complicate<br>
or to prevent any subsequent abuse.<br>
If comminution is inadequate, parenteral, in particular intravenous, administration cannot<br>
actually be performed safely or extraction of the active ingredient therefrom takes too long for<br>
the abuser or there is no "kick" when orally abused as release is not instantaneous.<br>
According to the invention, comminution is taken to mean pulverisation of the dosage form by<br>
the application of force with conventional means which are conventionally available to an<br>
abuser, such as for example a pestle and mortar, a hammer, a mallet or other usual means for<br>
pulverisation, wherein the proportion of fines which may arise (particle size equal to or<br>
smaller than 0.3 mm) must not exceed 5 wt.%.<br>
The dosage form produced according to the invention also cannot be comminuted by these<br>
methods at low temperatures, for example of below -25 °C, -40°C or even in liquid nitrogen.<br>
The dosage form produced according to the invention, preferably a pharmaceutical dosage<br>
form, is thus suitable for preventing parenteral, nasal and/or oral abuse of active ingredients,<br>
preferably of pharmaceutical active ingredients, with potential for abuse.<br><br>
 Active ingredients, preferably pharmaceutical active ingredients with potential for abuse are<br>
known to the person skilled in.the art, as are the quantities thereof to be used and processes for<br>
the production thereof, and may be present in the dosage form produced according to the<br>
invention as such, in the form of the corresponding derivatives thereof, in particular esters,<br>
ethers or amides, or in each case in the form of corresponding physiologically acceptable<br>
compounds, in particular in the form of the corresponding salts or solvates thereof, as<br>
racemates or stereoisomers. The dosage form produced according to the invention may<br>
contain two or more pharmaceutical active ingredients. The dosage form produced according<br>
to the invention preferably contains only one specific active ingredient.<br>
The dosage form according to the invention is in particular suitable for preventing the abuse<br>
of at least one pharmaceutical active ingredient, which is selected from the group comprising<br>
opioids, tranquillisers, preferably benzodiazepines, barbiturates, stimulants and further<br>
narcotics.<br>
The dosage form according to the invention is very particularly suitable for preventing abuse<br>
of an opioid, tranquilliser or another narcotic selected from the group comprising N-{l-[2-(4-<br>

The dosage forms produced according to the invention are furthermore in particular suitable<br>
for preventing abuse of an opioid active ingredient selected from among the group comprising<br>
(lR,2R)-3 -(3 -dimethyl amino-1-ethyl-2-methyl-propyl)phenol, (2R,3R)-l-dimethylamino-3-<br>

These compounds and the process for the production thereof are described in EP-A-693475<br>

In order to achieve the necessary breaking strength, at least one synthetic or natural polymer<br>
(C) which has a breaking strength, measured using the method disclosed in the present<br>
application, of at least 500 N is used in the process according to the invention. At least one<br>
polymer selected from the group comprising polyalkylene oxides, preferably polymethylene<br>
oxide, polyethylene oxide, polypropylene oxide; polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl<br>
chloride, polycarbonate, polystyrene, polyacrylate, copolymers thereof, and mixtures of at<br>
least two of the stated polymers is preferably used for this purpose. High molecular weight,<br>
thermoplastic polyalkylene oxides are preferred. High molecular weight polyethylene oxides<br>
with a molecular weight of at least 0.5 million, preferably of at least 1 million to 15 million,<br>
determined by rheological measurements, are particularly preferred. These polymers have a<br>
viscosity at 25°C of 4500 to 17600 cP, measured on a 5 wt.% aqueous solution using a model<br>
RVF Brookfield viscosimeter (spindle no. 2 / rotational speed 2 rpm), of 400 to 4000 cP,<br>
measured on a 2 wt.% aqueous solution using the stated viscosimeter (spindle no. 1 or 3 /<br><br><br>
rotational speed 10 rpm) or of 1650 to 10000 cP, measured on a 1 wt.% aqueous solution<br>
using the stated viscosimeter (spindle no. 2 / rotational speed 2 rpm).<br>
The polymers are preferably used in powder form. They should be soluble in water.<br>
In order to achieve the necessary breaking strength with the processes according to the<br>
invention, it is furthermore possible additionally to use at least one natural or synthetic wax<br>
(D) with a breaking strength, measured using the method disclosed in the present application,<br>
of at least 500 N. Waxes with a softening point of at least 60°C are preferred. Carnauba wax<br>
and beeswax are particularly preferred. Carnauba wax is very particularly preferred. Carnauba<br>
wax is a natural wax which is obtained from the leaves of the carnauba palm and has a<br>
softening point of at least 80°C. When the wax component is additionally used, it is used<br>
together with at least one polymer (C) in quantities such that the dosage form produced<br>
according to the invention has a breaking strength of at least 500 N.<br>
Component (C) is preferably used in a quantity of 20 to 99.9 wt.%, particularly preferably of<br>
at least 30 wt.%, very particularly preferably of at least 40 wt.%, relative to the total weight<br>
the dosage form.<br>
Auxiliary substances (B) which may be used are those known auxiliary substances which are<br>
conventional for the formulation of solid dosage forms. These are preferably plasticisers, such<br>
as triacetin and polyethylene glycol, auxiliary substances which influence active ingredient<br>
release, preferably hydrophobic or hydrophilic, preferably hydrophilic polymers, very<br>
particularly preferably hydroxypropylmethylcellulose or hydroxypropylcellulose, and/or<br>
antioxidants. Polymers, particularly preferably cellulose ethers, cellulose esters and/or acrylic<br>
resins are preferably used as hydrophilic matrix materials. Ethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,	hydroxypropylcellulose,	hydroxymethylcellulose,<br>
poly(meth)acrylic acid and/or the derivatives thereof, such as the salts, amides or esters<br>
thereof are very particularly preferably used as matrix materials. Suitable antioxidants are<br>
ascorbic acid, butylhydroxyanisole, butylhydroxytoluene, salts of ascorbic acid,<br>
monothioglycerol, phosphorous acid, vitamin C, vitamin E and the derivatives thereof, sodium<br>
bisulfite, particularly preferably butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) or butylhydroxyanisole (BHA)<br>
and α-tocopherol.<br><br>
The antioxidant is preferably used in quantities of 0.01 to 10 wt.%, preferably of 0.03 to 5<br>
wt.%, relative to the total weight of the dosage form.<br>
To perform the process according to the invention, at least one active ingredient with potential<br>
for abuse (A), at least one polymer (C) and optionally a wax (D), optionally at least one of the<br>
further optionally present abuse-preventing components (a) to (f) listed below and optionally<br>
present auxiliary substances (B) such as antioxidants, plasticisers and/or delayed-release<br>
auxiliary substances are processed with the addition of a solvent for the polymer (C) to yield<br>
the dosage form.<br>
To this end, components (A), (B), (C) and the optionally present component (D) and<br>
optionally at least one of the optionally present further abuse-preventing components (a) to (f)<br>
are mixed or, if necessary, separately mixed with addition of component (C) and optionally<br>
component (D) and the resultant formulation mixture or the resultant formulation mixtures,<br>
after addition of the solvent and optionally after granulation, are shaped to yield the dosage<br>
form.<br>
Mixing of components (A), (B), (C) and optionally (D) and of the optionally present further<br>
components (a) to (f) with components (C) and the optionally present component (D)<br>
optionally proceeds in each case in a mixer known to the person skilled in the art. The mixer<br>
may, for example, be a roll mixer, shaking mixer, shear mixer or compulsory mixer.<br>
The solvent for the polymer (C) is added at least in such quantities that the formulation<br>
mixture is uniformly moistened.<br>
Solvents which are suitable as the solvent for the polymer (C) are preferably aqueous solvents,<br>
such as water, mixtures of water and aliphatic alcohols, preferably alcohols with C1 to C6,<br>
esters, ethers, hydrocarbons, particularly preferably distilled water, alone or mixed with short-<br>
chain alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol to yield aqueous alcohol<br>
solutions.<br><br>
The solvent is preferably added by stirring. The uniformly moistened composition is then<br>
dried. Drying preferably proceeds with exposure to heat at temperatures at which it is possible<br>
to rule out any discoloration of the composition. This temperature may be established by<br>
simple preliminary testing.<br>
Before or after drying, the composition may be divided into sub-portions which preferably in<br>
each case correspond to the mass of a unit of the dosage form. The corresponding dried<br>
portions are then shaped to yield the dosage form.<br>
This is preferably achieved by using tablet presses.<br>
The formulation mixture may also be moistened in such a manner that, before addition of the<br>
solvent, the formulation mixture is divided, preferably in moulds, into sub-portions, is<br>
dispersed in a liquid dispersant with stirring and then the solvent is added. The polymer<br>
component (C) is not soluble in the dispersant, which must be miscible with the solvent.<br>
Suitable dispersants are preferably hydrophilic solvents, such as aliphatic alcohols, ketones,<br>
esters. Short-chain alcohols are preferably used.<br>
Alternatively, the formulation mixture may also be moistened in such a manner that the<br>
solvent may be incorporated into the formulation mixture as a foam. Such a foam of the<br>
solvent is preferably produced with the assistance of a high-speed mixer, preferably with the<br>
addition of conventional foam stabilisers. Suitable stabilisers are, for example, hydrophilic<br>
polymers such as<br>
for example hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.<br>
The foam is also preferably incorporated into the formulation mixture with stirring, a<br>
granulated composition so preferably being obtained.<br>
Before or after being divided into sub-portions, which preferably correspond to the mass of a<br>
unit of the dosage form, the granulated composition is dried and then shaped into the dosage<br>
form.<br><br>
Drying and shaping may preferably proceed as described above.<br>
The process according to the invention may also be performed in such a manner that solvent is<br>
added to the formulation mixture in such a quantity that a shapeable paste is obtained.<br>
Before or after being dried, which may proceed as explained above, such a paste may be<br>
divided into sub-portions and the dried portions, after further division in each case into a<br>
portion corresponding to the mass of a unit of the dosage form, are shaped or converted to<br>
yield the dosage form.<br>
It is here possible to form the sub-portions in the form of strands, which may be produced<br>
with the assistance of a screen or a strand former. The dried strands are preferably singulated<br>
and shaped to yield the dosage form. This shaping preferably proceeds with the assistance of a<br>
tablet press, using shaping rollers or shaping belts equipped with rollers.<br>
It is also possible to convert the paste into a planar structure and to stamp the dosage form out<br>
of it once it has dried.<br>
The paste is advantageously processed with an extruder, wherein, depending on the<br>
configuration of the extrusion die, strands or planar structures articles are produced, which are<br>
singulated by chopping, cutting or stamping. The singulated sub-portions may be shaped or<br>
formed as described above to yield the dosage form. Corresponding apparatuses are known to<br>
the person skilled in the art.<br>
The process according to the invention may here be performed continuously or<br>
discontinuously.<br>
It is also possible to add solvent to the formulation mixture in such a quantity that at least the<br>
polymer component (C) is dissolved. Such a solution or dispersion/suspension is preferably<br>
converted into a planar structure, an extruder with a flat die preferably being used or the<br>
solution being cast onto a planar support.<br><br>
As stated above, after drying, the dosage forms may be obtained from the planar structures by<br>
stamping or calendering. It is also possible, as stated above, to convert the solution into<br>
strands and to singulate these, preferably after they have been dried, and shape them to yield<br>
the dosage form.<br>
Alternatively, the solution may also be divided into portions such that, after drying, they each<br>
correspond to the mass of a unit of the dosage form, with moulds which already correspond to<br>
the shape of the unit of the dosage form preferably being used for this purpose.<br>
If the solution is divided into any desired portions, the portions may, after drying, optionally<br>
be combined again and be shaped to form the dosage form, being for example packaged in a<br>
capsule or press-moulded to form a tablet.<br>
The formulation mixtures combined with solvent are preferably processed at temperatures of<br>
20°C to 40°C, wherein, apart from during drying to remove the solvent and the optionally<br>
present dispersant, no higher temperatures are used. After shaping to yield the dosage form,<br>
further drying corresponding to the above-described drying may optionally be performed.<br>
As already explained, the dosage form produced according to the invention may assume<br>
multiparticulate form, preferably the form of microtablets, microcapsules, micropellets,<br>
granules, spheroids, beads or pellets, optionally packaged in capsules or press-moulded into<br>
tablets, preferably for oral administration. The multiparticulate forms preferably have a size or<br>
size distribution in the range from 0.1 to 3 mm, particularly preferably in the range from 0.5 to<br>
2 mm. Depending on the desired dosage form, conventional auxiliary substances (B) are<br>
optionally also used for the formulation of the dosage form.<br>
The dosage forms obtained by the process according to the invention are distinguished in that,<br>
by virtue of their hardness of at least 500 N, they cannot be pulverised with the assistance of<br>
conventional comminution means available to an abuser, such as a pestle and mortar. This<br>
virtually rules out oral, parenteral, in particular intravenous, or nasal abuse. However, in order<br>
to prevent any possible abuse of the dosage forms produced according to the invention, in a<br>
preferred embodiment, the dosage forms according to the invention may contain further<br>
abuse-complicating or -preventing agents as auxiliary substances (B).<br><br>
The abuse-proofed dosage form produced according to the invention, which comprises, apart<br>
from one or more active ingredients with potential for abuse (A), at least one hardening<br>
polymer (C) and optionally at least one wax (D), may accordingly also comprise at least one<br>
of the following components (a)-(e) as auxiliary substances (B):<br>
(a)	at least one substance which irritates the nasal passages and/or pharynx,<br>
(b)	at least one viscosity-increasing agent, which, with the assistance of a necessary ,<br>
minimum quantity of an aqueous liquid, preferably as an aqueous extract obtained<br>
from the dosage form, forms a gel which preferably remains visually distinguishable<br>
when introduced into a further quantity of an aqueous liquid,<br>
(c)	at least one antagonist for each of the active ingredients with potential for abuse,<br>
(d)	at least one emetic,<br>
(e)	at least one dye as an aversive agent,<br>
(f)	at least one bitter substance.<br>
Components (a) to (f) are additionally each individually suitable for abuse-proofing the dosage<br>
form obtained according to the invention. Accordingly, component (a) is preferably suitable<br>
for proofing the dosage form against nasal, oral and/or parenteral, preferably intravenous,<br>
abuse, component (b) is preferably suitable for proofing against parenteral, particularly<br>
preferably intravenous and/or nasal abuse, component (c) is preferably suitable for proofing<br>
against nasal and/or parenteral, particularly preferably intravenous, abuse, component (d) is<br>
preferably suitable for proofing against parenteral, particularly preferably intravenous, and/or<br>
oral and/or nasal abuse, component (e) is suitable as a visual deterrent against oral or<br>
parenteral abuse and component (f) is suitable for proofing against oral or nasal abuse.<br>
Combined use according to the invention of at least one of the above-stated components<br>
makes it possible still more effectively to prevent abuse of dosage forms obtained by the<br>
process according to the invention.<br><br>
For example, the dosage form obtained according to the invention may also comprise two or<br>
more of components (a)-(f) in a combination, preferably (a), (b) and optionally (c) and/or (f)<br>
and/or (e) or (a), (b) and optionally (d) and/or (f) and/or (e).<br>
In another embodiment, the dosage form obtained according to the invention may comprise all<br>
of components (a)-(f).<br>
If the dosage form obtained according to the invention comprises an abuse-preventing<br>
component (a), substances which irritate the nasal passages and/or pharynx which may be<br>
considered according to the invention are any substances which, when administered<br>
accordingly via the nasal passages and/or pharynx, bring about a physical reaction which is<br>
either so unpleasant for the abuser that he/she does not wish to or cannot continue<br>
administration, for example burning, or physiologically counteracts taking of the<br>
corresponding active ingredient, for example due to increased nasal secretion or sneezing.<br>
These substances which conventionally irritate the nasal passages and/or pharynx may also<br>
bring about a very unpleasant sensation or even unbearable pain when administered<br>
parenterally, in particular intravenously, such that the abuser does not wish to or cannot<br>
continue taking the substance.<br>
Particularly suitable substances which irritate the nasal passages and/or pharynx are those<br>
which cause burning, itching, an urge to sneeze, increased formation of secretions or a<br>
combination of at least two of these stimuli. Appropriate substances and the quantities thereof<br>
which are conventionally to be used are known per se to the person skilled in the art or may be<br>
identified by simple preliminary testing.<br>
The substance which irritates the nasal passages and/or pharynx of component (a) is<br>
preferably based on one or more constituents or one or more plant parts of at least one hot<br>
substance drug.<br>
Corresponding hot substance drugs are known per se to the person skilled in the art and are<br>
described, for example, in "Pharmazeutische Biologie - Drogen und ihre Inhaltsstoffe" by<br>
Prof. Dr. Hildebert Wagner, 2nd., revised edition, Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart-New York,<br><br>
1982, pages 82 et seq.. The corresponding description is hereby introduced as a reference and<br>
is deemed to be part of the disclosure.<br>
A dosage unit is taken to mean a separate or separable administration unit, such as<br>
for example a tablet or a capsule.<br>
One or more constituents of at least one hot substance drug selected from the group consisting<br>
of Allii sativi bulbus (garlic), Asari rhizoma cum herba (Asarum root and leaves), Calami<br>
rhizoma (calamus root), Capsici fructus (capsicum), Capsici fructus acer (cayenne pepper),<br>
Curcumae longae rhizoma (turmeric root), Curcumae xanthorrhizae rhizoma (Javanese<br>
turmeric root), Galangae rhizoma (galangal root), Myristicae semen (nutmeg), Piperis nigri<br>
fructus (pepper), Sinapis albae semen (white mustard seed), Sinapis nigri semen (black<br>
mustard seed), Zedoariae rhizoma (zedoary root) and Zingiberis rhizoma (ginger root),<br>
particularly preferably from the group consisting of Capsici fructus (capsicum), Capsici<br>
fructus acer (cayenne pepper) and Piperis nigri fructus (pepper) may preferably be added as<br>
component (a) to the dosage form according to the invention.<br>
The constituents of the hot substance drugs preferably comprise o-methoxy(methyl)phenol<br>
compounds, acid amide compounds, mustard oils or sulfide compounds or compounds<br>
derived therefrom.<br>
Particularly preferably, at least one constituent of the hot substance drugs is selected from the<br>
group consisting of myristicin, elemicin, isoeugenol, α-asarone, safrole, gingerols,<br>
xanthorrhizol, capsaicinoids, preferably capsaicin, capsaicin derivatives, such as N-vanillyl-<br>
9E-octadecenamide, dihydrocapsaicin, nordihydrocapsaicin, homocapsaicin, norcapsaicin and<br>
nomorcapsaicin, pipeline, preferably trans-piperine, glucosinolates, preferably based on non-<br>
volatile mustard oils, particularly preferably based on p-hydroxybenzyl mustard oil,<br>
methylmercapto mustard oil or methylsulfonyl mustard oil, and compounds derived from<br>
these constituents.<br>
The dosage form obtained according to the invention may preferably contain the plant parts of<br>
the corresponding hot substance drugs in a quantity of 0.01 to 30 wt.%, particularly preferably<br>
of 0.1 to 0.5 wt.%, in each case relative to the total weight of the dosage unit.<br><br>
If one or more constituents of corresponding hot substance drugs are used, the quantity thereof<br>
in a dosage unit obtained according to the invention preferably amounts to 0.001 to 0.005<br>
wt.%, relative to the total weight of the dosage unit.<br>
Another option for preventing abuse of the dosage form obtained according to the invention<br>
consists in adding at least one viscosity-increasing agent as a further abuse-preventing<br>
component (b) to the dosage form, which, with the assistance of a necessary minimum<br>
quantity of an aqueous liquid, preferably as an aqueous extract obtained from the dosage form,<br>
forms a gel which is virtually impossible to administer safely and preferably remains visually<br>
distinguishable when introduced into a further quantity of an aqueous liquid.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, visually distinguishable means that the active<br>
ingredient-containing gel formed with the assistance of a necessary minimum quantity of<br>
aqueous liquid, when introduced, preferably with the assistance of a hypodermic needle, into a<br>
further quantity of aqueous liquid at 37°C, remains substantially insoluble and cohesive and<br>
cannot straightforwardly be dispersed in such a manner that it can safely be administered<br>
parenterally, in particular intravenously. The material preferably remains visually<br>
distinguishable for at least one minute, preferably for at least 10 minutes.<br>
The increased viscosity of the extract makes it more difficult or even impossible for it to be<br>
passed through a needle or injected. If the gel remains visually distinguishable, this means that<br>
the gel obtained on introduction into a further quantity of aqueous liquid, for example by<br>
injection into blood, initially remains in the form of a largely cohesive thread, which, while it<br>
may indeed be broken up mechanically into smaller fragments, cannot be dispersed or even<br>
dissolved in such a manner that it can safely be administered parenterally, in particular<br>
intravenously. In combination with at least one optionally present component (a) to (e), this<br>
additionally leads to unpleasant burning, vomiting, bad flavour and/or visual deterrence.<br>
Intravenous administration of such a gel would most probably result in obstruction of blood<br>
vessels, associated with serious damage to the health of the abuser.<br><br>
In order to verify whether a viscosity-increasing agent is suitable as component (b) for use in<br>
the dosage form obtained according to the invention, the active ingredient is mixed with the<br>
viscosity-increasing agent and suspended in 10 ml of water at a temperature of 25°C. If this<br>
results in the formation of a gel which fulfils the above-stated conditions, the corresponding<br>
viscosity-increasing agent is suitable for additionally preventing or averting abuse of the<br>
dosage forms obtained according to the invention.<br>
If component (b) is added to the dosage form obtained according to the invention, one or more<br>
viscosity-increasing agents are used which are selected from the group comprising<br>
microcrystalline cellulose with 11 wt.% carboxymethylcellulose sodium (Avicel® RC 591),<br>
carboxymethylcellulose sodium (Blanose®, CMC-Na C300P®, Frimulsion BLC-5®, Tylose<br>
C300 P®), polyacrylic acid (Carbopol® 980 NF, Carbopol® 981), locust bean flour (Cesagum®<br>
LA-200, Cesagum LID/150, Cesagum LN-1), pectins, preferably from pectin fruit and<br>
apples (Cesapectin® HM Medium Rapid Set), waxy maize starch (C*Gel 04201®), sodium<br>
alginate (Frimulsion ALG (E401)®), guar flour (Frimulsion BM®, Polygum 26/1-75®), iota<br>
carrageenan (Frimulsion D021®), karaya gum, gellan gum (Kelcogel F®, Kelcogel LT100®),<br>
galactomannan (Meyprogat 150®), tara stone flour (Polygum 43/1®), propylene glycol alginate<br>
(Protanal-Ester SD-LB®), sodium hyaluronate, tragacanth, tara gum (Vidogum SP 200®),<br>
fermented polysaccharide welan gum (K1A96), xanthan gum (Xantural 180®). Xanthans are<br>
particularly preferred. The names stated in brackets are the trade names by which the materials<br>
are known commercially. In general, a quantity of 0.1 to 20 wt.%, particularly preferably of<br>
0.1 to 15 wt.%, relative to the total weight of the dosage form, of the stated viscosity-<br>
increasing agent(s) is sufficient to fulfil the above-stated conditions.<br>
The component (b) viscosity-increasing agents, where provided, are preferably present in the<br>
dosage form obtained according to the invention in quantities of &gt; 5 mg per dosage unit, i.e.<br>
per administration unit.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the viscosity-increasing<br>
agents used as component (b) are those which, on extraction from the dosage form with the<br>
necessary minimum quantity of aqueous liquid, form a gel which encloses air bubbles. The<br>
resultant gels are distinguished by a turbid appearance, which provides the potential abuser<br><br>
with an additional optical warning and discourages him/her from administering the gel<br>
parenterally.<br>
Component (C) may also optionally serve as an additional viscosity-increasing agent, which<br>
forms a gel with the assistance of a necessary minimum quantity of aqueous liquid.<br>
It is also possible to formulate the viscosity-increasing agents and the other constituents in the<br>
dosage form obtained according to the invention in a mutually spatially separated<br>
arrangement.<br>
In order to discourage and prevent abuse, the dosage form obtained according to the invention<br>
may furthermore comprise component (c), namely one or more antagonists for the active<br>
ingredient or active ingredients with potential for abuse, wherein the antagonists are<br>
preferably spatially separated from the remaining constituents of the dosage form obtained<br>
according to the invention and, when correctly used, do not exert any effect.<br>
Suitable antagonists for preventing abuse of the active ingredients are known per se to the<br>
person skilled in the art and may be present in the dosage form according to the invention as<br>
such or in the form of corresponding derivatives, in particular esters or ethers, or in each case<br>
in the form of corresponding physiologically acceptable compounds, in particular in the form<br>
of the salts or solvates thereof.<br>
If the active ingredient present in the dosage form is an opioid, the antagonist used is<br>
preferably an antagonist selected from the group comprising naloxone, naltrexone, nalmefene,<br>
nalid, nalmexone, nalorphine or naluphine, in each case optionally in the form of a<br>
corresponding physiologically acceptable compound, in particular in the form of a base, a salt<br>
or solvate. The corresponding antagonists, where component (c) is provided, are preferably<br>
used in a quantity of &gt; 1 mg, particularly preferably in a quantity of 3 to 100 mg, very<br>
particularly preferably in a quantity of 5 to 50 mg per dosage form, i.e. per administration unit.<br>
If the dosage form obtained according to the invention comprises a stimulant as active<br>
ingredient, the antagonist is preferably a neuroleptic, preferably at least one compound<br>
selected from the group consisting of haloperidol, promethazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine,<br><br>
levomepromazine, thioridazine, perazine, chlorpromazine, chlorprothixine, zuclopentixol,<br>
flupentixol, prothipendyl, zotepine, benperidol, pipamperone, melperone and bromperidol.<br>
The dosage form obtained according to the invention preferably comprises these antagonists<br>
in a conventional therapeutic dose known to the person skilled in the art, particularly<br>
preferably in a quantity of twice to three times the conventional dose per administration unit.<br>
If the combination to further discourage and prevent abuse of the dosage form produced<br>
according to the invention also comprises component (d), it may comprise at least one emetic,<br>
which is preferably present in a spatially separated arrangement from the other components of<br>
the dosage form produced according to the invention and, when correctly used, is intended not<br>
to exert its effect in the body.<br>
Suitable emetics for additionally preventing abuse of an active ingredient are known per se to<br>
the person skilled in the art and may be present in the dosage form obtained according to the<br>
invention as such or in the form of corresponding derivatives, in particular esters or ethers, or<br>
in each case in the form of corresponding physiologically acceptable compounds, in particular<br>
in the form of the salts or solvates thereof.<br>
An emetic based on one or more constituents of ipecacuanha (ipecac) root, preferably based<br>
on the constituent emetine may preferably be considered in the dosage form obtained<br>
according to the invention, as are, for example, described in "Pharmazeutische Biologie -<br>
Drogen und ihre Inhaltsstoffe" by Prof. Dr. Hildebert Wagner, 2nd, revised edition, Gustav<br>
Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart, New York, 1982. The corresponding literature description is hereby<br>
introduced as a reference and is deemed to be part of the disclosure.<br>
The dosage form obtained according to the invention may preferably comprise the emetic<br>
emetine as component (d), preferably in a quantity of &gt; 3 mg, particularly preferably of &gt; 10<br>
mg and very particularly preferably in a quantity of &gt; 20 mg per dosage form, i.e.<br>
administration unit.<br><br>
Apomorphine may likewise preferably be used as an emetic for additional abuse-proofing,<br>
preferably in a quantity of preferably &gt; 3 mg , particularly preferably of &gt; 5 mg and very<br>
particularly preferably of &gt; 7 mg per administration unit.<br>
If the dosage form obtained according to the invention contains component (e) as an<br>
additional abuse-preventing auxiliary substance, the use of such a dye brings about an intense<br>
coloration of a corresponding aqueous solution, in particular when the attempt is made to<br>
extract the active ingredient for parenteral, preferably intravenous administration, which<br>
coloration may act as a deterrent to the potential abuser. Oral abuse, which conventionally<br>
begins by means of aqueous extraction of the active ingredient, may also be prevented by this<br>
coloration. Suitable dyes and the quantities required for the necessary deterrence may be<br>
found in WO 03/015531, wherein the corresponding disclosure should be deemed to be part of<br>
the present disclosure and is hereby introduced as a reference.<br>
If the dosage form obtained according to the invention contains component (f) as an additional<br>
abuse-preventing auxiliary substance, this addition of at least one bitter substance and the<br>
consequent impairment of the flavour of the dosage form additionally prevents oral and/or<br>
nasal abuse.<br>
Suitable bitter substances and the quantities effective for use may be found in US-<br>
2003/0064099 Al, the corresponding disclosure of which should be deemed to be the<br>
disclosure of the present application and is hereby introduced as a reference. Suitable bitter<br>
substances are preferably aromatic oils, preferably peppermint oil, eucalyptus oil, bitter<br>
almond oil, menthol, fruit aroma substances, preferably aroma substances from lemons,<br>
oranges, limes, grapefruit or mixtures thereof, and/or denatonium benzoate (Bitrex®).<br>
Denatonium benzoate is particularly preferred.<br>
The solid dosage form obtained according to the invention is suitable not only for oral, but<br>
also for vaginal or rectal administration, but is preferably for oral intake. The dosage form is<br>
preferably not in film form. The dosage form according to the invention may assume<br>
multiparticulate form, preferably cylindrical form, the form of microtablets, microcapsules,<br>
micropellets, granules, spheroids, beads or pellets, optionally packaged in capsules or press-<br>
moulded into tablets, preferably for oral administration. The multiparticulate forms preferably<br><br><br>
have a size or size distribution in the range from 0.1 to 3 mm, particularly preferably in the<br>
range from 0.5 to 2 mm. Depending on the desired dosage form, conventional auxiliary<br>
substances (B) are optionally also used for the formulation of the dosage form.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the dosage form obtained according to the invention<br>
assumes the form of a tablet, a capsule or is in the form of an oral osmotic therapeutic system<br>
(OROS), preferably if at least one further abuse-preventing component (a)-(f) is also present.<br>
If components (c) and/or (d) and/or (f) are present in the dosage form obtained according to<br>
the invention, care must be taken to ensure that they are formulated in such a manner or are<br>
present in such a low dose that, when correctly administered, the dosage form is able to bring<br>
about virtually no effect which impairs the patient or the efficacy of the active ingredient.<br>
If the dosage form obtained according to the invention contains component (d) and/or (f), the<br>
dosage must be selected such that, when correctly orally administered, no negative effect is<br>
caused. If, however, the intended dosage is exceeded in the event of abuse, nausea or an<br>
inclination to vomit or a bad flavour are produced The particular quantity of component (d)<br>
and/or (f) which can still be tolerated by the patient in the event of correct oral administration<br>
may be determined by the person skilled in the art by simple preliminary testing.<br>
If, however, irrespective of the fact that the further dosage form produced according to the<br>
invention is virtually impossible to pulverise, components (c) and/or (d) and/or (f) are used to<br>
protect the dosage form, these components should preferably be used at a dosage which is<br>
sufficiently high that, when abusively administered, they bring about an intense negative<br>
effect on the abuser. This is preferably achieved by spatial separation of at least the active<br>
ingredient or active ingredients from components (c) and/or (d) and/or (f), wherein the active<br>
ingredient or active ingredients is/are present in at least one subunit (X) and components (c)<br>
and/or (d) and/or (f) is/are present in at least one subunit (Y), and wherein, when the dosage<br>
form is correctly administered, components (c), (d) and (f) do not exert their effect on taking<br>
and/or in the body and the remaining components of the formulation, in particular component<br>
(C) and optionally (D), are identical.<br><br><br>
If the dosage form obtained according to the invention comprises at least 2 of components (c)<br>
and (d) or (f), these may each be present in the same or different subunits (Y). Preferably,<br>
when present, all the components (c) and (d) and (f) are present in one and the same subunit<br>
(Y).<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, subunits are solid formulations, which in each case,<br>
apart from conventional auxiliary substances known to the person skilled in the art, contain<br>
the active ingredient(s), at least one polymer (C) and the optionally present component (D)<br>
and optionally at least one of the optionally present components (a) and/or (b) and/or (e) or in<br>
each case at least one polymer (C) and optionally (D) and the antagonist(s) and/or emetic(s)<br>
and/or component (e) and/or component (f) and optionally at least one of the optionally<br>
present components (a) and/or (b). Care must here be taken to ensure that each of the stated<br>
subunits is formulated in accordance with the above-stated process according to the invention.<br>
One substantial advantage of the separated formulation of active ingredients from components<br>
(c) or (d) or (f) in subunits (X) and (Y) of the dosage form produced according to the<br>
invention is that, when correctly administered, components (c) and/or (d) and/or (f) are hardly<br>
released on taking and/or in the body or are released in such small quantities that they exert no<br>
effect which impairs the patient or therapeutic success or, on passing through the patient's<br>
body, they are only liberated in locations where they cannot be sufficiently absorbed to be<br>
effective. When the dosage form is correctly administered, preferably hardly any of<br>
components (c) and/or (d) and/or (f) is released into the patient's body or they go unnoticed by<br>
the patient.<br>
The person skilled in the art will understand that the above-stated conditions may vary as a<br>
function of the particular components (c), (d) and/or (f) used and of the formulation of the<br>
subunits or the dosage form. The optimum formulation for the particular dosage form may be<br>
determined by simple preliminary testing. What is vital is that each subunit contains the<br>
polymer (C) and optionally component (D) and has been formulated in the stated manner and<br>
produced according to the invention.<br>
Should, contrary to expectations, the abuser succeed in comminuting such a dosage form<br>
produced according to the invention, which comprises components (c) and/or (e) and/or (d)<br><br><br>
and/or (f) in subunits (Y), for the purpose of abusing the active ingredient and obtain a powder<br>
which is extracted with a suitable extracting agent, not only the active ingredient but also the<br>
particular component (c) and/or (e) and/or (f) and/or (d) will be obtained in a form in which it<br>
cannot readily be separated from the active ingredient, such that when the dosage form which<br>
has been tampered with is administered, in particular by oral and/or parenteral administration,<br>
it will exert its effect on taking and/or in the body combined with an additional negative effect<br>
on the abuser corresponding to component (c) and/or (d) and/or (f) or, when the attempt is<br>
made to extract the active ingredient, the coloration will act as a deterrent and so prevent<br>
abuse of the dosage form.<br>
A dosage form in which the active ingredient or active ingredients is/are spatially separated<br>
from components (c), (d) and/or (e), preferably by formulation in different subunits, may be<br>
formulated according to the invention in many different ways, wherein the corresponding<br>
subunits in the dosage form may each be present in any desired spatial arrangement relative to<br>
one another, provided that the above-stated conditions for the release of components (c)<br>
and/or (d) are fulfilled.<br>
The person skilled in the art will understand that component(s) (a) and/or (b) which are<br>
optionally also present may preferably be formulated in the dosage form produced according<br>
to the invention both in the particular subunits (X) and (Y) and in the form of independent<br>
subunits corresponding to subunits (X) and (Y), provided that neither the abuse-proofing nor<br>
the active ingredient release in the event of correct administration is impaired by the nature of<br>
the formulation and the polymer (C) and optionally (D) is preferably included in the<br>
formulation and formulation is carried out in accordance with the above-stated process in<br>
order to achieve the necessary hardness.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the dosage form produced according to the invention, subunits<br>
(X) and (Y) are present in multiparticulate form, wherein microtablets, microcapsules,<br>
micropellets, granules, spheroids, beads or pellets are preferred and the same form, i.e. shape,<br>
is selected for both subunit (X) and subunit (Y), such that it is not possible to separate<br>
subunits (X) from (Y), for example by mechanical selection. The multiparticulate forms are<br>
preferably of a size in the range from 0.1 to 3 mm, preferably of 0.5 to 2 mm.<br><br>
The subunits (X) and (Y) in multiparticulate form may also preferably be packaged in a<br>
capsule or be press-moulded into a tablet, wherein the final formulation in each case proceeds<br>
in such a manner that the subunits (X) and (Y) are also retained in the resultant dosage form.<br>
The multiparticulate subunits (X) and (Y) of identical shape should also not be visually<br>
distinguishable from one another so that the abuser cannot separate them from one another by .<br>
simple sorting. This may, for example, be achieved by the application of identical coatings<br>
which, apart from this disguising function, may also incorporate further functions, such as, for<br>
example, delayed release of one or more active ingredients or provision of a finish resistant to<br>
gastric juices on the particular subunits.<br>
The multiparticulate subunits may also be formulated as an oral dosage form as a slurry or<br>
suspension in pharmaceutically safe suspending media.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, subunits (X) and (Y) are in each<br>
case arranged in layers relative to one another.<br>
The layered subunits (X) and (Y) are preferably arranged for this purpose vertically or<br>
horizontally relative to one another in the dosage form produced according to the invention,<br>
wherein in each case one or more layered subunits (X) and one or more layered subunits (Y)<br>
may be present in the dosage form, such that, apart from the preferred layer sequences (X)-(Y)<br>
or (X)-(Y)-(X), any desired other layer sequences may be considered, optionally in<br>
combination with layers containing components (a) and/or (b).<br>
Another preferred dosage form produced according to the invention is one in which subunit<br>
(Y) forms a core which is completely enclosed by subunit (X), wherein a separation layer (Z)<br>
may be present between said layers. Such a structure is preferably also suitable for the above-<br>
stated multiparticulate forms, wherein both subunits (X) and (Y) and an optionally present<br>
separation layer (Z), which must satisfy the hardness requirement according to the invention,<br>
are formulated in one and the same multiparticulate form.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the dosage form produced according to the invention, the<br>
subunit (X) forms a core, which is enclosed by subunit (Y), wherein the latter comprises at<br>
least one channel which leads from the core to the surface of the dosage form.<br><br>
The dosage form produced according to the invention may comprise, between one layer of the<br>
subunit (X) and one layer of the subunit (Y), in each case one or more, preferably one,<br>
optionally swellable separation layer (Z) which serves to separate subunit (X) spatially from<br>
(Y).<br>
If the dosage form produced according to the invention comprises the layered subunits (X) and<br>
(Y) and an optionally present separation layer (Z) in an at least partially vertical or horizontal<br>
arrangement, the dosage form preferably takes the form of a tablet or a laminate.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment, the entirety of the free surface of subunit (Y) and<br>
optionally at least part of the free surface of subunit(s) (X) and optionally at least part of the<br>
free surface of the optionally present separation layer(s) (Z) may be coated with at least one<br>
barrier layer (Z') which prevents release of component (c) and/or (e) and/or (d) and/or (f). The<br>
barrier layer (Z') must also fulfil the hardness conditions according to the invention.<br>
Another particularly preferred embodiment of the dosage form produced according to the<br>
invention comprises a vertical or horizontal arrangement of the layers of subunits (X) and (Y)<br>
and at least one push layer (p) arranged there between, and optionally a separation layer (Z), in<br>
which dosage form the entirety of the free surface of the layer structure consisting of subunits<br>
(X) and (Y), the push layer and the optionally present separation layer (Z) is provided with a<br>
semipermeable coating (E), which is permeable to a release medium, i.e. conventionally a<br>
physiological liquid, but substantially impermeable to the active ingredient and to component<br>
(c) and/or (d) and/or (f), and wherein this coating (E) comprises at least one opening for<br>
release of the active ingredient in the area of subunit (X).<br>
A corresponding dosage form is known to the person skilled in the art, for example under the<br>
name oral osmotic therapeutic system (OROS), as are suitable materials and methods for the<br>
production thereof, inter alia from US 4,612,008, US 4,765,989 and US 4,783,337. The<br>
corresponding descriptions are hereby introduced as a reference and are deemed to be part of<br>
the disclosure.<br><br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the subunit (X) of the dosage form produced according to<br>
the invention is in the form of a tablet, the edge face and optionally one of the two main faces<br>
of which is covered with a barrier layer (Z') containing component (c) and/or (d) and/or (f).<br>
The person skilled in the art will understand that the auxiliary substances of the subunit(s) (X)<br>
or (Y) and of the optionally present separation layer(s) (Z) and/or of the barrier layer(s) (Z')<br>
used in the formulation according to the invention of the dosage form will vary as a function<br>
of the arrangement thereof in the dosage form, the mode of administration and as a function of<br>
the particular active ingredient of the optionally present components (a) and/or (b) and/or (e)<br>
and of component (c) and/or (d) and/or (f). The materials which have the requisite properties<br>
are in each case known per se to the person skilled in the art.<br>
If release of component (c) and/or (d) and/or (f) from subunit (Y) of the dosage form produced<br>
according to the invention is prevented with the assistance of a cover, preferably a barrier<br>
layer, the subunit may consist of conventional materials known to the person skilled in the art,<br>
providing that it contains at least one polymer (C) and optionally (D) to fulfil the hardness<br>
condition and has been produced according to the invention.<br>
If a corresponding barrier layer (Z') is not provided to prevent release of component (c) and/or<br>
(d) and/or (f), the materials of the subunits should be selected such that release of the<br>
particular component (c) and/or (d) from subunit (Y) is virtually ruled out.<br>
The materials which are stated below to be suitable for production of the barrier layer may<br>
preferably be used for this purpose.<br>
Preferred materials are those which are selected from the group comprising alkylcelluloses,<br>
hydroxyalkylcelluloses, glucans, scleroglucans, mannans, xanthans, copolymers of poly[bis(p-<br>
carboxyphenoxy)propane and sebacic acid, preferably in a molar ratio of 20:80 (commercially<br>
available under the name Polifeprosan 20®), carboxymethylcelluloses, cellulose ethers,<br>
cellulose esters, nitrocelluloses, polymers based on (mefh)acrylic acid and the esters thereof,<br>
polyamides, polycarbonates, polyalkylenes, polyalkylene glycols, polyalkylene oxides,<br>
polyalkylene terephthalates, polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl ethers, polyvinyl esters, halogenated<br>
polyvinyls, polyglycolides, polysiloxanes and polyurethanes and the copolymers thereof.<br><br>
Particularly suitable materials may be selected from the group comprising methylcellulose,<br>
ethylcellulose,	hydroxypropylcellulose,	hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxybutylmethylcellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose propionate (of low, medium or high<br>
molecular weight), cellulose acetate propionate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate<br>
phthalate, carboxymethylcellulose, cellulose triacetate, sodium cellulose sulfate, polymethyl<br>
methacrylate, polyethyl methacrylate, polybutyl methacrylate, polyisobutyl methacrylate,<br>
polyhexyl methacrylate, polyisodecyl methacrylate, polylauryl methacrylate, polyphenyl<br>
methacrylate, polymethyl acrylate, polyisopropyl acrylate, polyisobutyl acrylate, polyoctadecyl<br>
acrylate, polyethylene, low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, polypropylene,<br>
polyethylene glycol, polyethylene oxide, polyethylene terephthalate, polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
polyvinyl isobutyl ether, polyvinyl acetate and polyvinyl chloride.<br>
Particularly suitable copolymers may be selected from the group comprising copolymers of<br>
butyl methacrylate and isobutyl methacrylate, copolymers of methyl vinyl ether and maleic<br>
acid of high molecular weight, copolymers of methyl vinyl ether and maleic acid monoethyl<br>
ester, copolymers of methyl vinyl ether and maleic anhydride and copolymers of vinyl alcohol<br>
and vinyl acetate.<br>
Further materials which are particularly suitable for formulating the barrier layer are starch-<br>
filled polycaprolactone (WO98/20073), aliphatic polyesteramides (DE 19 753 534 A1, DE 19<br>
800 698 A1, EP 0 820 698 A1), aliphatic and aromatic polyester urethanes (DE 19822979),<br>
polyhydroxyalkanoates, in particular polyhydroxybutyrates, polyhydroxyvalerates, casein (DE<br>
4 309 528), polylactides and copolylactides (EP 0 980 894 Al). The corresponding<br>
descriptions are hereby introduced as a reference and are deemed to be part of the disclosure.<br>
The above-stated materials may optionally be blended with further conventional auxiliary<br>
substances known to the person skilled in the art, preferably selected from the group<br>
comprising glyceryl monostearate, semi-synthetic triglyceride derivatives, semi-synthetic<br>
glycerides, hydrogenated castor oil, glyceryl palmitostearate, glyceryl behenate,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatine, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, sodium stearate, talcum,<br>
sodium benzoate, boric acid and colloidal silica, fatty acids, substituted triglycerides,<br>
glycerides, polyoxyalkylene glycols and the derivatives thereof.<br><br>
If the dosage form produced according to the invention comprises a separation layer (Z'), said<br>
layer, like the uncovered subunit (Y), may preferably consist of the above-stated materials<br>
described for the barrier layer. The person skilled in the art will understand that release of the<br>
active ingredient or of component (c) and/or (d) from the particular subunit may be controlled<br>
by the thickness of the separation layer.<br>
The dosage form produced according to the invention exhibits controlled release of the active<br>
ingredient. It is preferably suitable for twice daily administration to patients.<br>
The dosage form produced according to the invention may comprise one or more active<br>
ingredients with potential for abuse at least partially in a further delayed-release form, wherein<br>
delayed release may be achieved with the assistance of conventional materials and methods<br>
known to the person skilled in the art, for example by embedding the active ingredient in a<br>
delayed-release matrix or by the application of one or more delayed-release coatings. Active<br>
ingredient release must, however, be controlled such that the above-stated conditions are<br>
fulfilled in each case, for example that, in the event of correct administration of the dosage<br>
form, the active ingredient or active ingredients are virtually completely released before the<br>
optionally present component (c) and/or (d) can exert an impairing effect. Addition of<br>
materials effecting controlled release must moreover not impair the necessary hardness.<br>
Controlled release from the dosage form obtained according to the invention is preferably<br>
achieved by embedding the active ingredient in a matrix. The auxiliary substances acting as<br>
matrix materials control active ingredient release. Matrix materials may, for example, be<br>
hydrophilic, gel-forming materials, from which active ingredient release proceeds mainly by<br>
diffusion, or hydrophobic materials, from which active ingredient release proceeds mainly by<br>
diffusion from the pores in the matrix.<br>
Physiologically acceptable, hydrophobic materials which are known to the person skilled in<br>
the art may be used as matrix materials. Polymers, particularly preferably cellulose ethers,<br>
cellulose esters and/or acrylic resins are preferably used as hydrophilic matrix materials.<br>
Ethylcellulose,	hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,	hydroxypropylcellulose,<br>
hydroxymethylcellulose, poly(meth)acrylic acid and/or the derivatives thereof, such as the<br>
salts, amides or esters thereof are very particularly preferably used as matrix materials.<br><br>
Matrix materials prepared from hydrophobic materials, such as hydrophobic polymers, waxes,<br>
fats, long-chain fatty acids, fatty alcohols or corresponding esters or ethers or mixtures thereof<br>
are also preferred. Mono- or diglycerides of C12-C30 fatty acids and/or C12-C30 fatty<br>
alcohols and/or waxes or mixtures thereof are particularly preferably used as hydrophobic<br>
materials.<br>
It is also possible to use mixtures of the above-stated hydrophilic and hydrophobic materials<br>
as matrix materials.<br>
Component (C) and the optionally present component (D), which serve to achieve the<br>
breaking strength of at least 500 N which is necessary according to the invention, may<br>
furthermore themselves serve as additional matrix materials.<br>
If the dosage form produced according to the invention is intended for oral administration, it<br>
may also preferably comprise a coating which is resistant to gastric juices and dissolves as a<br>
function of the pH value of the release environment.<br>
By means of this coating, it is possible to ensure that the dosage form produced according to<br>
the invention passes through the stomach undissolved and the active ingredient is only<br>
released in the intestines. The coating which is resistant to gastric juices preferably dissolves<br>
at a pH value of between 5 and 7.5.<br>
Corresponding materials and methods for the delayed release of active ingredients and for the<br>
application of coatings which are resistant to gastric juices are known to the person skilled in<br>
the art, for example from "Coated Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms - Fundamentals,<br>
Manufacturing Techniques, Biopharmaceutical Aspects, Test Methods and Raw Materials" by<br>
Kurt H. Bauer, K. Lehmann, Hermann P. Osterwald, Rothgang, Gerhart, 1st edition, 1998,<br>
Medpharm Scientific Publishers. The corresponding literature description is hereby introduced<br>
as a reference and is deemed to be part of the disclosure.<br>
Method for determining breaking strength<br><br>
In order to verify whether a material may be used as component (C) or (D), the material is<br>
dissolved in a tablet mould with the assistance of a solvent for component (C) or (D), and,<br>
once the solvent has been removed at temperatures below the softening point of the material,<br>
is pressed to form a tablet with a diameter of 10 mm and a height of 5 mm using a force of<br>
150 N.<br>
Using tablets produced in this manner, breaking strength is determined with the apparatus<br>
described below in accordance with the method for determining the breaking strength of<br>
tablets published in the European Pharmacopoeia 1997, page 143, 144, method no. 2.9.8. The<br>
apparatus used for the measurement is a "Zwick Z 2.5" materials tester, Fmax = 2.5 kN with<br>
a maximum draw of 1150 mm, which should be set up with 1 column and 1 spindle, a<br>
clearance behind of 100 mm and a test speed adjustable between 0.1 and 800 mm/min<br>
together with test Control software. Measurement is performed using a pressure piston with<br>
screw-in inserts and a cylinder (diam. 10 mm), a force transducer, Fmax. 1 kN, diameter = 8<br>
mm, class 0.5 from 10 N, class 1 from 2 N to ISO 7500-1, with manufacturer's test certificate<br>
M to DIN 55350-18 (Zwick gross force Fmax = 1.45 kN) (all apparatus from Zwick GmbH<br>
&amp; Co. KG, Ulm, Germany) with order no. BTC-FR 2.5 TH. D09 for the tester, order no.<br>
BTC-LC 0050N. P01 for the force transfucer, order no. BO 70000 S06 for the centring<br>
device.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYIN DRAWING:<br>
Figure 1 shows the measurement of the breaking strength of a tablet, in particular the tablet<br>
(4) adjustment device (6) used for this purpose before and during the measurement. To this<br>
end, the tablet (4) is held between the upper pressure plate (1) and the lower pressure plate<br>
(3) of the force application apparatus (not shown) with the assistance of two 2-part clamping<br>
devices, which are in each case firmly fastened (not shown) with the upper and lower<br>
pressure plate once the spacing (5) necessary for accommodating and centring the tablet to be<br>
measure has been established. The spacing (5) may be established by moving the 2-part<br>
clamping devices horizontally outwards or inwards in each case on the pressure plate on<br>
which they are mounted.<br>
The tablets deemed to be resistant to breaking under a specific load include not only those<br>
which have not broken but also those which may have suffered plastic deformation under the<br>
action of the force.<br><br><br>
 The breaking strength of the dosage forms obtained according to the invention is determined<br>
by the stated measurement method for determining breaking strength, with dosage forms other<br>
than tablets also being tested.<br>
The invention is explained below with reference to Examples. These explanations are given<br>
merely by way of example and do not restrict the general concept of the invention.<br><br><br>
The stated quantity of BHT was dissolved in ethanol (96%), such that a 7.7% (mass/mass)<br>
ethanolic solution was obtained. This was mixed initially with 150 g of polyethylene oxide in<br>
a high speed mixer for 30 minutes and then the remaining quantity of polyethylene oxide was<br>
added and stirring continued for a further 30 minutes. The composition was dried for 12 h at<br>
40°C.<br>
All the further components were added and mixed for 15 min in a free-fall mixer. The powder<br>
mixture was divided between moulds, each having a diameter of 13 mm and a depth of 6 mm.<br>
Using a syringe with cannula, the mixture was suspended in each case in 0.5 ml of 96%<br>
ethanol and then in each case combined with 0.5 ml of distilled water After 24 hours' swelling<br>
time, the swollen composition was dried for 24 h at 40°C.<br>
The divided up, dried portions were each press-moulded into tablets using a model EK 0<br>
eccentric press. The tabletting tool had a diameter of 10 mm and a radius of curvature of 8<br>
mm.<br>
The breaking strength of the tablets was determined using the above-described method. No<br>
breakage occurred when a force of 500 N was applied. The tablets could not be comminuted<br>
using a hammer, nor with the assistance of a pestle and mortar.<br><br>
In vitro release of the active ingredient from the tablets was determined in a paddle stirrer<br>
apparatus with sinker in accordance with Pharm. Eur.. The temperature of the release medium<br>
was 37°C and the rotational speed of the stirrer 75 min-1. The release medium used was 600<br>
ml of intestinal juice, pH 6.8. The quantity of active ingredient released in each case into the<br>
dissolution medium at any one time was determined by spectrophotometry.<br><br><br><br>
The powder mixture was first produced as stated in Example 1.<br>
The foam was produced by dissolving the stated quantity of Hypromellose in distilled water.<br>
A foam was then produced using a high performance homogeniser (IKA Ultraturrax 25 Basic)<br>
by stirring initially for 2 minutes at level 1, then for 2 minutes with a mixer/granulator at level<br>
2 and finally for 3 minutes at level 3. The powder mixture was slowly added to the foam with<br>
constant stirring in a mixer (Kenwood Major Classic 25 Basic).<br>
The granulated mixture was then dried for 24 hours at 40°C and, after being passed through a<br>
screen (from Frewitt, model GLA-A-ORV) with 1 mm orifices, was press-moulded into<br>
tablets with a weight of 450.2 mg. A model EK 0 eccentric press with a round tabletting tool<br>
having a diameter of 10 mm and a radius of curvature of 8 mm was used for this purpose.<br>
These tablets were dried for 1 hour at 70°C.<br>
The breaking strength of the tablets was determined using the above-stated method. No<br>
breakage occurred when a force of 500 N was applied. The tablet could not be comminuted<br>
using a hammer, nor with the assistance of a pestle and mortar.<br><br>
In vitro release of the active ingredient from the tablets was determined in a paddle stirrer<br>
apparatus with sinker in accordance with Pharm. Eur.. The temperature of the release medium<br>
was 37°C and the rotational speed of the stirrer 75 min-1 . The release medium used was 600<br>
ml of intestinal juice, pH 6.8. The quantity of active ingredient released in each case into the<br>
dissolution medium at any one time was determined by spectrophotometry.<br><br><br>
