				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates, in general, to mobile communication and Mobile Handset Functionality. Further, this invention relates to remote controlling of mobile communication devices from other mobile communication devices. More particularly, this invention relates to a method to control a remote mobile from another client mobile using message-triggers.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Currently available handsets, do not allow the user to operate the mobile device remotely to any extent.<br>
For example, consider a scenario where the user has left his mobile device at his residence. Currently, there would be no way by which the user can set the call forward feature in his mobile device to some other number.<br>
Consider a situation in which the user is away from his mobile device and wants to set a call forward feature or to grant any profile based access permission to a third user. Presently, the user cannot remotely operate his mobile device if he does not have physical access to his mobile device.<br>
The problems involved in the given scenario are mentioned below:<br>
a)	The user has no way to operate his mobile device from some other mobile device.<br>
b)	While there are many features which can be equally effective or even more useful in the circumstances when the user does not has physical access to his mobile device, there are no means today to exploit those features.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention involves using Mobile-to-Mobile messaging in a different manner and for a different purpose i.e. to trigger certain operations upon reception by the targeted mobile device! The idea is to make remote operation of mobile device possible. This invention provides the mobile device with some effective ways with which an authorized user can operate them remotely up to a limited extent.<br>
Examples are given below<br>
•	A data session can be started with the mobile to exchange any information;<br>
•	A two-party game can be played;<br>
•	Location information or any other information what the remote mobile can sense, like temperature, humidity, etc. can be obtained;<br>
•	Non interactive web browsing can be done;<br>
•	Wallpaper download from the Service-provider server can be done;<br>
•	Command to lock the mobile device can be sent;<br>
•	Command to set the call forward feature can be sent;<br>
•	Command to grant the access permission to different users in case when Profile based access mechanism is implemented on the remote mobile device can be sent, etc.<br>
The proposed invention encompassed a few effective ways for the user to operate his mobile remotely to a particular extent. The invention uses special SMS/EMS/MMS to trigger certain events on the remote mobile device.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method to control a remote mobile from another client mobile using message-triggers comprising the steps of:<br>
(a) generating a message-trigger for the remote mobile from the client mobile; <br>
(b)	setting a different Teleservice Id by the client mobile, in order for the said message-trigger to be differentiated from a normal SMS at the remote mobile side;<br>
(c)	differentiating between a normal incoming SMS and an incoming Message-trigger by checking the Teleservice Id field of the incoming SMS at the remote mobile;<br>
(d)	decoding the encoded password and authorizing the sender of the trigger once the remote mobile has received a message-trigger; and<br>
(e)	processing the command accordingly after authorizing the sender of the trigger.<br>
The message-trigger contains a predefined string which acts as a command on the remote mobile to perform specific operations. The message-trigger carries the authorization password in secure manner along with the said commands. The said message trigger would typically contain the remote mobile device's phone number. The message-trigger contains a coded password which authorizes the user to let him trigger the features remotely. A message is sent as an acknowledgement of the successful operation back to the user based on the choice of implementation. The user of the remote mobile in his phonebook initially stores the list of trusted numbers from which he can receive Message-triggers without any other authorization. The user of the remote mobile sets a password in the mobile device which gets always compared with the password in the message-trigger once the mobile device receives a trigger.<br>
The said method is adapted to operate in a manner such that a choice is given to the user to decide a time duration for which only the first Message-trigger needs to be authorized and others following it from the same client mobile within the predefined time interval need not to carry the encoded password along with them. An incoming message found to be a normal SMS after getting scrutinized for it being a potential message-trigger, is forwarded to the SMS layer else if it is a message-trigger then it is parsed for its contents. The Teleservice ID tells the SMS layer of the remote mobile device that whether the incoming message is a normal<br>
SMS or a Message Trigger.<br>
The client mobile device provides a user interface for the user to generate a Message-trigger and the said user-interface gives the choice to the user to enable or disable the said feature. To create a message-trigger, user has to enter remote mobile number, the command, and the password as an input to the client mobile. The password is encoded properly with any standard cryptographic technique and sent along with the message and after sending the Message-trigger, the said password is destroyed from the memory.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings and the claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the algorithm for the remote mobile side. Figure 2 illustrates the Message-Trigger and SMS structure. Figure 3 illustrates the Architecture at Remote Mobile Side.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not <br>
r<br>
described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The proposed invention provides a simple solution to operate a mobile device remotely from another mobile device. The detailed description of how the invention is carried out is mentioned in the sections below:<br>
The present invention introduces the usage of Mobile-to-Mobile message-triggers which will operate the mobile device remotely in a safe manner.<br>
The client mobile device has a module running on it which will enable the user to generate a message-trigger for the remote mobile device. The message-trigger will also carry the authorization password in secured way along with the commands.<br>
A Message-trigger will contain a "predefined string" which will act as a command on the remote mobile to perform certain operation. The typical structure of the message would be like<br>
"<command_to_be_processed> <phone_no>[<authorizationjpassword>] E.g. send SMS with text body as "SET_CALL_FORWARD <phone_no>"<br>
Figure Two explains the protocol and this structure in a pictorial form.<br>
After being processed successfully at the remote mobile side, this command will set the Call Forward feature to the <phone_no><br>
The Message-trigger may itself contain a coded password which will authorize the user to let him trigger the features remotely<br>
E.g. send SMS with text body as "SET_CALL_FORWARD <phone_no> [<password>]"<br>
The client module will set a different Teleservice Id, in order or this SMS-trigger to<br>
be differentiated from a normal SMS at the remote mobile side. Remote Side<br>
The remote mobile device has a module running on it which will differentiate between a normal incoming SMS and an incoming Message-trigger by checking the Teleservice ID field of the incoming SMS. Once it has received a Message-trigger, it will decode the encoded password and will authorize the sender of the trigger. After authorization of the sender, it will process the command accordingly. A message as an acknowledgement of the successful operation could be sent back to the user depending upon the choice of implementation.<br>
There could be any or both of the options available depending upon the choice of implementation to ensure the security of the information<br>
•	The user in his phonebook can make a separate category in which he can store the list of trusted numbers from which he can receive Message-triggers without any other authorization<br>
•	The user can set a password in his mobile device which will be always compared with the password in the Message-trigger once the mobile device receives one.<br>
•	A choice could be given to the user to decide a time duration for which only the first Message-trigger needs to be authorized and others following it from the same client mobile within the predefined time interval need not to carry the encoded password along with them<br>
Operation of the Invention<br>
The algorithim suggested in Figure 1 explains the working of the module at the remote mobile side. Any incoming message is first differentiated for it being a potential Message-trigger, if it is normal SMS then it is being forwarded to the SMS layer else if it is a Message-Trigger then it is given to be parsed for its contents. Which typically contains Command to be processed, Remote Mobile Phone no. and the Authorization Password, as shown in Figure 2. Once authorized successfully the remote mobile executes the command accordingly and after execution it informs to the sender mobile about the result of the execution being successful or not, depending upon the choice of implementation.<br>
Figure 2 shows the standard SMS Transport layer and Teleservice Layer structure, and Message- Trigger structure as an Application layer on the top of it. Refer standard IS 637 (Short Message Service for Spread Spectrum Systems) for the explanation of standard layers of SMS. Application layer information for Message-Trigger is packed into the CHARi field of the User-Data of an incoming SMS which can be retrieved once an incoming SMS can be identified as a Message-Trigger, based on its Teleservice-ID.<br>
The architecture shown in figure 3 explains how the incoming trigger will get processed from the physical layer to the application layer on the remote mobile side. First, whenever a mobile device receives an SMS data burst from the lower layer, it'll check its Teleservice ID. The Teleservice ID will tell the SMS layer that whether it's a normal SMS or a Message Trigger. If it is a normal SMS, then it'll pass it to the SMS application to be informed to the user that a new SMS has arrived and else if it is a Message Trigger then it'll be passed to Message Trigger application layer inorder to be parsed to retrieve the required data as shown in Figure 2 and then to be authenticated and for further command execution.<br>
Figure 1 (Processing of Message-Triggers at remote mobile side) presents a flowchart of various steps involved when an incoming SMS alert arrives.<br>
The specialized modules is running on both, client and remote mobile in order to support this feature.<br>
The module on client side will provide a user interface for the user to generate a Message-trigger. The user-interface will give the choice to the user to enable or disable this feature. To create a message-trigger, user has to enter remote mobile <br>
device no., the command, and the password as an input to the client mobile device. The password will be encoded properly with any standard cryptographic technique in order to maintain security and sent along with the message. After sending of the Message-trigger, the password will be destroyed from the memory.<br>
On the remote mobile side an incoming SMS alert is checked first for its being a Message-trigger by seeing its Teleservice ID, if it is a Message-trigger then the message has been parsed for the commands and the encoded password. The password is decoded and compared to authorize the sender. If the sender is authorized, the command would be executed accordingly; else, the client mobile will be informed regarding the failure of authorization through a SMS. If the command gets executed successfully, the client mobile will be informed regarding the successful execution, else it'll be informed regarding the failure of the command execution.<br>
The figure one depicts the process of the invention's functionality at the remote mobile side.<br>
The figure two explains the structure of the Message Trigger to be carried by the SMS having a different Teleservice ID from Client mobile to Remote mobile.<br>
The figure three explains the architecture of the module at the Remote mobile side.<br>
The handset uses smart approach in those conditions where a user is away from his mobile because of any reason, and wants to use it somehow.<br>
The advantages of this scheme include:<br>
•	Registers the idea of operating a mobile remotely with the help of messages.<br>
•	Extra level of intelligence in the Mobile, to tackle certain critical situations like forgetting the mobile device at some place or loss of mobile.<br>
• There have been no changes on the Service Provider side as it is an ordinary SMS delivery for the service provider.<br>
