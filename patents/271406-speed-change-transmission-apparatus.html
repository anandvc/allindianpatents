SPEED CHANGE TRANSMISSION APPARATUS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a speed change transmission apparatus including a hydrostatic stepless speed change section receiving an output of an engine, a planetary transmission section having a plurality of planetary transmission mechanisms and a plurality of output members, the planetary transmission section being configured to combine/synthesize a drive force outputted from the hydrostatic stepless speed change section and an engine drive force that has not been subjected to any speed change action by the hydrostatic stepless speed change section, and a speed change output section having an output shaft, the speed change output section being configured to output combined drives force outputted from the plurality of output members in a plurality of different speed ranges from the output shaft.<br>
Next, in order to explain the advantage of the present invention, the construction of the invention filed for a patent application as Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-286073 and assigned to this applicant will be explained in comparison with the present invention. It should be noted; however, that the following discussion is not to be taken as this applicant's acknowledgement of the compared construction as prior art.<br>
FIG. 24 is a diagram of a speed change transmission apparatus for comparison. As shown in this figure, the speed change transmission apparatus includes a hydrostatic stepless speed change section 20, a planetary transmission section 3a and a speed change output section 3b. The planetary transmission section 3a includes a first planetary transmission mechanism PI, a second planetary transmission mechanism P2 and a third planetary transmission mechanism PS. The first planetary transmission mechanism PI includes a ring gear which receives an engine drive force not subjected to any speed change action by the hydraulic stepless speed change section 20 and a sun gear which receives the output from the hydraulic stepless speed change section 20. The second planetary transmission mechanism P2 includes a carrier operatively coupled to the ring gear of the first planetary transmission mechanism PI and a ring gear operatively coupled to a carrier of the first planetary transmission mechanism PI.    The<br><br>
third planetary transmission mechanism P3 includes a sun gear operatively coupled to a sun gear of the second planetary transmission mechanism P2 and a carrier operatively coupled to a ring gear of the second planetary transmission mechanism P2.<br>
The speed change output section 3b includes a clutch section C which receives the output of the planetary transmission section 3a and an auxiliary speed change section 100 which receives the output of this clutch section C. The clutch section C includes a first clutch Cl and a second clutch C2 which have input portions thereof coupled respectively to a pair of output portions of the planetary transmission section 3a. The auxiliary speed change section 100 includes a low speed clutch CL and a high speed clutch CH disposed between an input shaft and an output shaft of this auxiliary speed change section 100.<br>
FIG. 25 is an explanatory figure illustrating relationship among speed change conditions of the hydrostatic stepless speed change section 20, speed ranges and output speeds of the auxiliary speed change section 100 ("auxiliary speed change outputs" hereinafter) of the speed change transmission apparatus 3. The sign "-MAX" shown in FIG. 25 denotes the maximum speed change condition under a reverse rotation transmission condition of the hydrostatic stepless speed change section 20. The sign "N" denotes the neutral condition of the hydrostatic stepless speed change section 20.. The sign "+MAX" denotes the maximum speed change condition under a forward rotation transmission condition of the hydrostatic stepless speed change section 20. FIG. 26 is an explanatory figure illustrating relationship between speed rages and operational conditions of the clutches of the speed change transmission apparatus 3. The sign "ENGAGED" shown in FIG. 26 represents engaged conditions of the respective clutches Cl, C2, CL, CH. The sign "-" represents disengaged conditions of the respective clutches Cl, C2, CL, CH.<br>
When the first clutch Cl and the low speed clutch CL are operated to the engaged conditions and the hydrostatic stepless speed change section 20 is speed changed from ""MAX" toward "+MAX", the speed change transmission apparatus 3 is speed changed to the first speed range and the rotational speed of the auxiliary speed change output is increased sleeplessly from "0". When the hydrostatic stepless speed change section 20 reaches the speed condition "+MAX", the rotational speed of the urinary speed change<br><br>
output becomes "Bll". In association with this, as the second clutch C2 and the low speed clutch CL are operated into the engaged conditions and the hydrostatic stepless speed change section 20 is decelerated from "+MAX", the speed change transmission apparatus 3 is speed changed into the second speed range and the rotational speed of the auxiliary speed change output is steplessly increased from "Bll". When the hydrostatic stepless speed change section 20 is operated to a speed change condition "A" which is between "+MA1C' and "N", the rotational speed of the auxiliary speed change output becomes "B12". In association with this, as the first clutch CI and the high speed clutch CH are operated into the engaged conditions and the hydrostatic stepless speed change section 20 is accelerated from "A", the speed change transmission apparatus 3 is speed changed into the third speed range and the rotational speed of the auxiliary speed change output is steplessly increased from "B12". When the hydrostatic stepless speed change section 20 reaches the speed condition "+MAX", the rotational speed of the auxiliary speed change output becomes "B13". In association with this, as the second clutch C2 and the high speed clutch CH are operated into the engaged conditions and the hydrostatic stepless speed change section 20 is speed changed toward "-MAX", the speed change transmission apparatus 3 is speed changed into the fourth speed range and the rotational speed of the auxiliary speed change output is steplessly increased from "B13". When the hydrostatic stepless speed change section 20 reaches the speed change condition "-MAX", the rotational speed of the auxiliary speed change output becomes the maximum speed "B14".<br>
In the case of the speed change transmission apparatus described above, in the course of a speed change from one speed range to another speed range (this will be referred to as "range skipping speed change" hereinafter), especially in the course of switchover of the speed range between the second speed range and the third speed range, there sometimes occurs a momentary power transmission interruption or any other unstable speed change.<br>
More particularly, the range skipping speed change where the speed range is switched over between the second speed range and the third speed range, is effected by switching over all clutches from one of the engaged and disengaged conditions to the other. Further, when there occurs a change in the drive load applied to the speed change transmission apparatus, thus leading to a change in the load applied to the clutch, even if a designed<br><br>
switchover operational force is applied to the clutch, there tends to occur a situation in which the clutch is switched over at a timing different from the designed timing. Further, the greater the number of clutches to be switched over, the greater the number of clutches which are switched over at different timings from the designed timings and the greater the difference in the switchover timings among the clutches. For this reason, in the course of the range skipping speed change where the speed range is switched over between the second speed range and the third speed range, during the period from the completion of switchover of the respective clutches into predetermined operational conditions and the switchover of the speed change output section to the operational condition for realizing the second speed range or the third speed range, a certain clutch may be kept under the disengaged condition for an extended period of time or kept under a slipping condition. Or, an unstable speed change operation may occur in which even after some clutches are operated into predetermined operational conditions, the other clutches have not yet been switched over to predetermined operational conditions, so that the speed change output section is operated into an operational condition for realizing the first speed range or the fourth speed range before being switched over to the operational condition for reahzing the second speed range or the third speed range.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a speed change transmission apparatus which can provide an engine output in a pluraUty of speed ranges and speed change the output steplessly in each speed range, yet which can readily avoid the above-described inconvenience in the course of speed change operation.<br>
A speed change transmission apparatus according to a first characterizing construction of the present invention comprises:<br>
a hydrostatic stepless speed change section receiving an output of an engine;<br>
a planetary transmission section having a plurality of planetary transmission mechanisms and a plurality of output members, the planetary transmission section being configured to combine a drive force outputted from the hydrostatic stepless speed change section and an engine drive force that has not been subjected to any speed change action by the hydrostatic stepless<br><br>
speed change section; and<br>
a speed change output section having an output shaft, the speed change output section being configured to output combined drives force outputted from the plurality of output members in a plurahty of different speed ranges fi"om the output shaft;<br>
wherein said speed change output section includes a plurahty of transmission mechanisms disposed between said plurality of output members and said output shaft, and a clutch provided for each of the plurahty of transmission mechanisms.<br>
According to the construction of the first invention, with appropriate setting of the transmission ratios of the plurahty of transmission mechanisms, the speed change output section can be configiu-ed such that for reaUzing a predetermined speed range, the plurahty of clutches will be operated in such a manner as to operate one of the plurality of transmission mechanisms into the transmission engaged condition while operating another transmission mechanism into the transmission disengaged condition.<br>
That is to say, if four transmission mechanisms and four clutches are provided in order to obtain four speed ranges, range skipping speed change operations may take place as a range skipping speed change operation between the first speed range and the second speed range, a range skipping speed change operation between the second speed range and the third speed range and a range skipping speed change operation between the third speed range and the fourth speed range. All of these operations are possible by switching over only certain two of the plurality of clutches.<br>
With the above, it is possible to provide the engine output in a plurahty of speed ranges and also to speed change the output steplessly in each speed range. Also, when any one of the range skipping speed change operations is to be effected, this is possible by switching over a small number of clutches. Moreover, there will hardly occur the momentary power transmission interruption or instable speed change noted above. And, when the construction is employed in a traveling transmission apparatus, smooth speed change traveling is possible even when the traveUng drive load easily changes due to e.g. ground surface unevenness, so that it is possible to obtain a speed change transmission apparatus having high speed change performance and high output performance.<br>
According to a second characterizing feature of the speed change<br><br>
transmission apparatus of the invention, output side rotational members of the clutches are supported on the output shaft of the speed change output section to be rotatable therewith. Therefore, when a drive load is applied from the same output shaft to the respective clutches and there occurs change in the drive load, the inconvenience of different switchover timings among the clutches will hardly occur.<br>
With the above, it is possible to obtain a speed change transmission apparatus with which there will hardly occur the situation of the momentary power transmission interruption or instable speed change noted above.<br>
According to a third characterizing feature of the speed change transmission apparatus of the invention, preferably, each one of the clutches is a multiple disc type fidction clutch.<br>
Further, according to a fourth characterizing feature of the speed change transmission apparatus of the invention, preferably, each one of the plurality of transmission mechanisms includes a pair of gears meshing with each other.<br>
According to a fifth characterizing feature of the speed change transmission apparatus of the invention, said plurahty of output members of the planetary transmission section include a sun gear output member rotatable in unison with a sun gear of the planetary transmission mechanism which is disposed on the most downstream side in the transmission direction of the planetary transmission section, a carrier output member rotatable in unison with a carrier of said most downstream side planetary transmission mechanism, and a ring gear output member rotatable in unison with a ring gear of said most downstream side planetary transmission mechanism.<br>
With the fifth characterizing feature of the invention, when a certain clutch of the plurality of clutches corresponding to a certain speed range is switched into the engaged condition, an appropriate transmission mechanism of the plurality of transmission mechanisms in the speed change output section is rendered into the transmission engaged condition, so that the speed change output section will provide a predetermined speed range by operatively coupling an appropriate one of the sun gear output member, the carrier output member and the ring gear output member of the planetary transmission section to the output rotational member. Therefore, even with a simple planetary transmission section having no planetary transmission mechanisms or brakes,  with appropriate  switchovers of the plurality of<br><br>
clutches of the speed change output section in accordance with a speed change operation of the hydrostatic stepless speed change section, with the output combining/synthesizing by the planetary transmission section and the division of the combined/synthesized drive force by the speed change output section into a plurality of ranges, the engine output will be outputted in a pluraHty of speed reinges and speed changed steplessly in each speed range.<br>
Therefore, the construction of the speed change output section can be simplified.<br>
According to a sixth characterizing feature of the present invention, the sun gear output member, the carrier output member and the ring gear output member configured as a triple shaft construction parallel to the rotational axis of the output shaft; and the plurality of transmission mechanisms are arranged along the direction of the rotational axis of the output shaft.<br>
Therefore, in terms of the layout/arrangement of the sun gear output member, the carrier output member and the ring gear output member as well as the layout arrangement of the pluraHty of transmission mechanisms, the speed change transmission apparatus can be formed compact.<br>
According to a seventh characterizing feature of the present invention, a speed change transmission apparatus comprises:<br>
a hydrostatic stepless speed change section receiving an output of an engine;<br>
a planetary transmission section having a pair of output members, the planetary transmission section being configured to combine a drive force outputted from the hydrostatic stepless speed change section and an engine drive force that has not been subjected to any speed change action by the hydrostatic stepless speed change section and output the combined force fi-om said pair of output members; and<br>
a speed change output section configured to output combined drives force outputted from the pair of output members in a plurality of speed ranges;<br>
said planetary transmission section including-<br>
a first planetary transmission mechanism having a first sun gear, a first ring gear and a first carrier and configured to receive the output firom said hydrostatic stepless speed change section and the engine drive force that has not been subjected to any speed change action by the hydrostatic<br><br>
stepless speed change section; and<br>
a second planetary transmission mechanism having a second sun gear, a second ring gear and a second carrier and configured to receive output firom said first planetary transmission mechanism;<br>
said second sun gear of said second planetary transmission mechanism is operatively coupled to one of said pair of output members and either one of said second carrier and said second ring gear of said second planetary transmission mechanism is operatively coupled to the other of said pair of output members.<br>
According to the speed change transmission apparatus having the seventh characterizing feature of the invention, the engine drive force and the output from the hydrostatic stepless speed change section are combined by the first planetary transmission mechanism and the second planetary transmission mechanism and this combined drive force is transmitted to the speed change output section. Hence, with a speed change operation at the hydrostatic stepless speed change section and an appropriate operation of the speed change output section associated therewith, the force is provided in a predetermined speed range. So, the engine drive force is outputted in a plurality of speed ranges and speed changed steplessly in each speed range and outputted as such.<br>
With the above it is possible to obtain a speed change transmission apparatus capable of outputting an engine drive force in a plurality of speed ranges and speed changing the force steplessly in each speed range. Moreover, this can be obtained inexpensively as one having a simple construction including only a pair of first and second planetary transmission mechanisms as the planetary transmission mechanisms.<br>

the output fi'om the hydrostatic stepless change speed section is inputted to the first sun gear of the first planetary transmission mechanism and the engine drive force that has not been subjected to any speed change action by the hydrostatic stepless speed change section is inputted to the first carrier; and<br>

operatively coupled to the first ring gear of the first planetary transmission mechanism to be rotatable in imison therewith, and the second carrier of the second planetary transmission mechanism is operatively coupled to the other of the pair of output members.<br>

As shown in these figures, when the first speed clutch CLl is operated into the engaged condition while the second speed clutch CL2, the third speed clutch CL3 and the fourth speed clutch CL4 are operated to the disengaged condition, the speed change output section 3b operates such that the combined drive forces outputted firom the first output member 41 and the second output member 42 of the planetary transmission section 3a are transmitted in the first speed range by the other first transmission mechanism 72 and the first speed clutch CLl to the output shaft 70 and firom this output shaft 70 to the forward/reverse switchover device 30. When the planetary transmission section 3a is operated as described above, if the stepless speed change section 20 is speed changed from "-MAX" toward "+MAX", then, in association therewith, the rotational speed of the output shaft 70 is steplessly increased from "0". When the stepless speed change section 20 reaches the speed change condition "+MAX", the rotational speed of the output shaft 70 becomes "Bl".<br>
When the second speed clutch CL2 is operated into the engaged condition while the first speed clutch CLl, the third speed clutch CL3 and the fourth speed clutch CL4 are operated to the disengaged condition, the speed change output section 3b operates such that the combined drive forces outputted from the first output member 41 and the second output member 42<br><br>
of the planetary transmission section 3a are transmitted in the second speed range by the one first transmission mechanism 73 and the second speed clutch CL2 to the output shaft 70 and from this output shaft 70 to the forward/reverse switchover device 30. When the planetary transmission section 3a is operated as described above, if the stepless speed change section 20 is decelerated from "+MAX', then, in association therewith, the rotational speed of the output shaft 70 is steplessly increased from "Bl". When the stepless speed change section 20 reaches the speed change condition "Al", the rotational speed of the output shaft 70 becomes "B2".<br>
When the third speed clutch CL3 is operated into the engaged condition while the first speed clutch CLl, the second speed clutch CL2 and the fourth speed clutch CL4 are operated to the disengaged condition, the speed change output section 3b operates such that the combined drive forces outputted from the first output member 41 and the second output member 42 of the planetary transmission section 3a are transmitted in the third speed range by the one first transmission mechanism 73 and the third speed clutch CL3 to the output shaft 70 and from this output shaft 70 to the forward/reverse switchover device 30. When the planetary transmission section 3a is operated as described above, if the stepless speed change section 20 is accelerated from the forward rotation speed "Al", then, in association therewith, the rotational speed of the output shaft 70 is steplessly increased from "B2". When the stepless speed change section 20 reaches the speed change condition "+MAX", the rotational speed of the output shaft 70 becomes "B3".<br>
When the fourth speed clutch CL4 is operated into the engaged condition while the first speed clutch CLl, the second speed clutch CL2 and the third speed clutch CL3 are operated to the disengaged condition, the speed change output section 3b operates such that the combined drive forces outputted from the first output member 41 and the second output member 42 of the planetary transmission section 3a are transmitted in the fourth speed range by the other second transmission mechanism 74 and the fourth speed clutch CL4 to the output shaft 70 and from this output shaft 70 to the forward/reverse switchover device 30. When the planetary transmission section 3a is operated as described above, if the stepless speed change section 20 is speed changed from "+MAX" toward "-MAX", then, in association therewith, the rotational speed of the output shaft 70 is steplessly increased<br><br>
from "B3". When the stepless speed change section 20 reaches the speed change condition "-MAX", the rotational speed of the output shaft 70 becomes "B4".<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the forward/reverse switchover device 30 includes, in addition to the input shaft 31 and the output shaft 32, a forward clutch CF having an input side rotational member thereof coupled via a coupUng member 34 to the input shaft 31 to be rotatable in unison therewith and an output side rotational member thereof coupled via a coupling member 35 to the output shaft 32 to be rotatable in unison therewith and a reverse clutch CR having an input side rotational member thereof coupled via a reverse gear transmission mechanism 33 to the input shaft 31 to be rotatable in unison therewith and an output side rotational member thereof coupled via the couphng member 35 to the output shaft 32 to be rotatable in unison therewith.<br>
More particularly, when the forward clutch CF is operated to the engaged condition and the reverse clutch CR is operated to the disengaged condition, respectively, the forward/reverse switchover mechanism 30 provides a forward traveling condition wherein the drive force of the input shaft 31 is transmitted via the forward clutch CF to the output shaft 32. When the forward clutch CF is operated to the disengaged condition and the reverse clutch CR is operated to the engaged condition, respectively, the forward/reverse switchover mechanism 30 provides a reverse travehng condition wherein the drive force of the input shaft 31 is transmitted via the reverse transmission gear mechanism 33 and the reverse clutch CR to the output shaft 32.<br>
FIG. 5 is a block diagram of a traveling control device provided in a work vehicle such as a tractor As shown in this figure, the travehng control device includes a main speed change lever 80 and a forward/reverse lever 81 which are provided at a driving section of the tractor, a speed change detecting means 82 operatively coupled with the main speed change lever 80, a forwardyreverse detecting means 83 operatively coupled to the forward/reverse lever 81, and a controlling means 84 operable coupled with this forward/reverse detecting means 83 and the speed change detecting means 82. The controlhng means 84 is operatively connected to respective electromagnetic controlling portions of a speed change valve 85 for speed changing the  stepless  speed  change  section  20,  clutch valves  86-89 for<br><br>
switching over the respective clutches CL1-CL4, a forward valve 90 for switching over the forward clutch CF and a reverse valve 91 for switching over the reverse clutch CR. The controlling means 84 is operatively coupled to a speed change condition detecting means 92 provided in the stepless speed change section 20.<br>
The main speed change lever 80 is pivotally operated over an operational range from a neutral position SI to a maximum speed position Max. In the operational range of the main speed change lever 80, a portion thereof fi-om the neutral position SI to an intermediate position C is a low speed range L used mainly for a utiUty implement operation, whereas, a portion thereof from the neutral position C to the maximum speed position Max is a high speed range H used mainly for traveUng. The forward/reverse lever 81 is configured to be switched over to/firom a neutral position S2, a forward position F and a reverse position R.<br>
The speed change detecting means 82 is comprised of a rotation potentiometer having an operational portion thereof coupled to the main speed change lever 80 and configured to detect an operation position to which the main speed change lever 80 has been operated and then output this detection result to the controlling means 84. The forward/reverse detecting means 83 is comprised of a rotation potentiometer having an operational portion thereof coupled to the forward/reverse lever 81 and configured to detect an operation position to which the forward/reverse lever 81 has been operated and then output this detection result to the controlling means 84. The speed change condition detecting means 92 detects the speed change condition of the stepless speed change section 20 and feedbacks this detection result to the controUing means 94.<br>
The controUing means 84 is constructed by using a microcomputer. In operation, based on the detection information firom the speed change detecting means 82 and the speed change condition detecting means 92, the controlling means 84 operates the stepless speed change section 20 by operating the speed change valve 85 and switching over the respective clutches CL1-CL4 by switching over the respective clutch valves 86-89 so as to render the speed change transmission apparatus 3 into an operational condition wherein an output of a rotational speed corresponding to the operational position of the main speed change lever 80 may be outputted firom the output shaft 70.<br><br>
Further, based on the detection information fi-om the forward/reverse detecting means 83, the controlling means 84 operates the forward clutch CF by switching over the forward valve 90 and operates the reverse clutch CR by switching over the reverse valve 91 so as to render the speed change transmission apparatus 3 into an operational condition wherein an output of a rotational speed corresponding to the operational position of the forward/verse lever 81.<br>
That is, when the tractor is to travel, in response to a pivotal operation of the main speed change lever 80 fi:om the neutral position SI, the tractor travels. Then, as the operational stroke of the main speed change lever 80 fi-om the neutral position SI is increased, the traveling speed of the tractor is increased. And, when the main speed change lever 80 is operated to the maximum speed position Max, the traveUng speed of the tractor becomes the maximum.<br>
More particularly, after its pivotal operation fi-om the neutral position Si, until the main speed change lever 80 reaches a set position La which is in the low speed range L (this position will be referred to as the low speed set position La hereinafter), the controlhng means 84 maintains the first speed clutch CLl under its engaged condition, whereby the speed change transmission apparatus 3 is rendered into the first speed range and effects a speed change operation. Further, as the main speed change lever 80 is pivotally operated from the neutral position SI, the controlling means 84 operates the stepless speed change section 20 from the speed change condition "-MAX' toward the speed change condition "+MAX". With this, in association with the operation of the main speed change lever 80 from the neutral position SI, the output rotational speed of the output shaft 70 is increased steplessly from "0". When the main speed change lever 80 reaches the low speed set position La, the output rotational speed of the output shaft 70 becomes "Bl". Under this condition, the controlhng means 84 switches over the first speed clutch CLl into the disengaged condition and switches over the second speed clutch CL2 into the engaged condition, respectively, whereby the speed change transmission device 2 is switched into the second speed range. Thereafter, until the main speed change lever 80 is moved from the low speed set position LI to an intermediate position C, the controUing means 84 maintains the second speed clutch CL2 under the engaged condition, whereby the speed change transmission apparatus 3 is<br><br>
maintained in the second speed range and effects speed change operation.<br>
Further, as the main speed change lever 80 is pivotally operated from the low speed set position La, the controlling means 84 operates the stepless speed change section 20 from the speed change condition "+MAX" toward the forward rotation speed "Al". With this, in association with the operation of the main speed change lever 80 from the low speed set position La, the output rotational speed of the output shaft 70 is increased steplessly from "Bl". When the main speed change lever 80 reaches the intermediate position C, the output rotational speed of the output shaft 70 becomes "B2". Under this condition, the controlhng means 84 switches over the second speed clutch CL2 into the disengaged condition and switches over the third speed clutch CL3 into the engaged condition, respectively, whereby the speed change transmission device 2 is switched into the third speed range. Thereafter, until the main speed change lever 80 is moved from the intermediate position C to a set position Ha in the high speed range Ha (this position will be referred to as the high speed set position Ha hereinafter), the controlHng means 84 maintains the third speed clutch CL3 under the engaged condition, whereby the speed change transmission apparatus 3 is maintained in the third speed range and effects speed change operation. Further, as the main speed change lever 80 is pivotally operated from the intermediate position C, the controlling means 84 operates the stepless speed change section 20 from the forward rotation speed "Al" toward "+MAX". With this, in association with the pivotal operation of the main speed change lever 80 from the intermediate position C, the output rotational speed of the output shaft 70 is increased steplessly from "B2". When the main speed change lever 80 reaches the high speed set position Ha, the output rotational speed of the output shaft 70 becomes "B3". Under this condition, the controlling means 84 switches over the third speed clutch CL3 into the disengaged condition and switches over the fourth speed clutch CL4 into the engaged condition, respectively, whereby the speed change transmission apparatus 3 is switched into the fourth speed range. Thereafter, until the main speed change lever 80 is moved from the high speed set position Ha to reach the maximum speed position Max, the controlling means 84 maintains the fourth speed clutch CL4 under the engaged condition, whereby the speed change transmission apparatus 3 is maintained in the fourth speed range and effects speed change operation.    Still further, as the main speed change lever 80 is pivotally<br><br>
operated from the high speed set position Ha, the controlling means 84 operates the stepless speed change device 20 from the speed condition "+MAX" toward "-MAX". With this, in association with the pivotal operation of the main speed change lever 80 from the high speed set position Ha, the output rotational speed by the output shaft 70 is steplessly increased from "B3". When the main speed change lever 80 reaches the maximum speed position Max, the controlhng means 84 has maintained the fourth clutch CL4 under the engaged condition, thus rendering the speed change transmission apparatus 3 in the fourth speed range; and also the controlling means 84 operates the stepless speed change section 20 to the speed change condition "• MAX", whereby the output rotational speed by the output shaft 70 becomes the highest speed "B4".<br>
In the above-described traveling, the forward/reverse lever 81 is set to the forward position F. Then, the controUing means 84 operates the forward clutch CF to the engaged condition and operates the reverse clutch CR to the disengaged condition, respectively. With this, the forward/reverse switchover device 30 is rendered into the forward traveling condition, so that the output force from the output shaft 70 is converted to the forward drive force and transmitted as such to the rear wheel differential mechanism 5 and the front wheel differential mechanism 9 and the tractor travels forwardly. On the other hand, if the forward/reverse lever 81 is set to the reverse position R, the controlhng means 84 operates the forward clutch CF to the disengaged condition and operates the reverse clutch CR to the engaged condition, respectively. With this, the forward/reverse switchover device 30 is rendered into the reverse traveling condition, so that the output force from the output shaft 70 is converted to the reverse drive force and transmitted as such to the rear wheel differential mechanism 5 and the front wheel differential mechanism 9 and the tractor travels reversely.<br>
Incidentally, if the forward/reverse lever 81 is operated to the neutral position S2, the controlling means 84 operates the forward clutch CF and the reverse clutch CR to the disengaged conditions. With this, the forward/reverse switchover device 30 is rendered into the neutral condition, so that the power transmission to the rear wheel differential mechanism 5 and the front wheel differential mechanism 9 is stopped and the tractor enters a stop condition.<br>

As shown in this figure, each one of the clutches CL1CL4 includes an input side rotational member 95 supported to the output gear 71b, 72b, 73b, 74b to be rotatable in unison therewith, an output side rotational member 96 supported to the output shaft 70 to be rotatable in unison therewith, and a multiple disc type friction clutch body 97 provided between/across the output side rotational member 96 and the input side rotational member 95.<br>
Each clutch CL1-CL4 includes a hydraulic piston 98 provided inside the output side rotational member 96. Each hydraulic piston 98 is connected via an operational oil path 99 provided within the output shaft 70 to a corresponding one of the clutch valves 86-89.<br>
More particularly, with the respective clutches CL1-CL4 in operation, the clutch is rendered into the engaged condition when pressure oil is fed from the clutch valve 86, 87, 88, 89 to the hydraulic piston 98 and this hydraulic piston 98 presses the friction clutch body 97. The clutch is rendered into the disengaged condition when the pressure oil is discharged by the clutch valve 86, 87, 88, 89 from the hydrauHc piston 98 and the hydrauhc pressure apphed by the hydraulic piston 98 to the friction clutch body 97 is released.<br>

And, the planetary transmission section 103a is constructed such that the drive force of the motor shaft 21 as an engine drive force not subjected to any speed change action by the stepless speed change section 20 is inputted to the ring gear 153 of the front planetary transmission mechanism PF, the output of the pump shaft 21 of the stepless speed change section 20 is inputted to the sun gear 150 of the front planetary transmission mechanism PF, and the engine drive force not subjected to any speed change action by the stepless speed change section 20 and the output of the stepless speed change section 20 are combined/synthesized by the front planetary transmission mechanism PF and the rear planetary transmission mechanism PR, and this combinedysynthesized drive force is outputted from the three output members 141, 142, 143.<br>

With each clutch CL1-CL4 in operation, as the hydraulic piston 198 presses the multiple discs (not shown) of the friction clutch body 197, the clutch is rendered into the engaged condition for rotating the input side rotational member 195 and the output side rotational member 196 together through friction therebetween. When the pressing operation by the hydrauLc piston 198 to the clutch discs of the friction clutch body is released, the clutch is rendered into the disengaged condition for breaking the operable coupling between the input side rotational member 195 and the output side rotational member 196.<br>
With each one of the transmission mechanisms 171-174 in operation, as the clutch CL1-CL4 included in this transmission mechanism 171-174 is switched into the engaged condition, the drive force of the first output member 141 or the second output member 142 or the third output member 143 is transmitted to the output shaft 170 via the input gear 171a, 172a, 173a, 174a, the output gear 171b, 172b, 173b, 174b and the clutch CLl, CL2, CL3, CL4.

As shown in these figures, with the speed change transmission apparatus 103 according to Embodiment 2, with a speed change operation of the stepless speed change section 20 and appropriate switchover of the respective clutches CLl, CL2, CL3, CL4 of the speed change output section 103b, in association therewith, the drive force from the engine 1 is provided in four speed ranges and also in each speed range, the force is speed changed steplessly and then transmitted as such from the output shaft 170 to the forward/reverse switchover device 30.<br>
More particularly, when the first speed clutch CLl is operated into the engaged condition while the second speed clutch CL2, the third speed clutch CL3 and the fourth speed clutch CL4 are operated to the disengaged<br><br>
condition, the speed change output section 103b operates such that the combined drive forces outputted from the first output member 141 and the second output member 142 and the third output member 143 of the planetary transmission section 3a are transmitted in the first speed range by the first transmission mechanism 171 and the first speed clutch CLl to the output shaft 170 and from this output shaft 170 to the forward/reverse switchover device 30. When the planetary transmission section lD3a is operated as described above, if the stepless speed change section 20 is speed changed from "-MAX" toward "+MAX", then, in association therewith, the rotational speed of the output shaft 170 is steplessly increased from "0". When the stepless speed change section 20 reaches the speed change condition "+MAX", the rotational speed of the output shaft 170 becomes "B21".<br>
When the second speed clutch CL2 is operated into the engaged condition while the first speed clutch CLl, the third speed clutch CL3 and the fourth speed clutch CL4 Eire operated to the disengaged condition, the speed change output section 103b operates such that the combined drive forces outputted from the first output member 141, the second output member 142 and the third output member 143 of the planetary transmission section 103a are transmitted in the second speed range by the second transmission mechanism 172 and the second speed clutch CL2 to the output shaft 170 and from this output shaft 170 to the forward/reverse switchover device 30. When the speed change output section 103b is operated as described above, if the stepless speed change section 20 is operated from "-+MAX" toward "-MAX", then, in association therewith, the rotational speed of the output shaft 170 is steplessly increased from "B21". When the stepless speed change section 20 reaches the speed change condition "-MAX", the rotational speed of the output shaft 170 becomes "B22".<br>
When the third speed clutch CL3 is operated into the engaged condition while the first speed clutch CLl, the second speed clutch CL3 and the fourth speed clutch CL4 are operated to the disengaged condition, the speed change output section 103b operates such that the combined drive forces outputted from the first output member 141, the second output member 142 and the third output member 143 of the planetary transmission section 103a are transmitted in the third speed range by the third transmission mechanism 173 and the third speed clutch CL3 to the output shaft 170 and from this output shaft 170 to the forward/reverse switchover<br><br>
device 30. When the speed change output section 103b is operated as described above, if the stepless speed change section 20 is operated from "-MAX" toward "+MAX", then, in association therewith, the rotational speed of the output shaft 170 is steplessly increased from "B22".

When the speed change output section 103b is operated as described above, if the stepless speed change section 20 is speed changed from "+MAX" toward "-MAX", then, in association therewith, the rotational speed of the output shaft 170 is steplessly increased from "B23". When the stepless speed change section 20 reaches the speed change condition "-MAX", the rotational speed of the output shaft 70 becomes the maximum speed "B24".<br>
In this embodiment too, there is provided a control apparatus including the controlling means shown in FIG. 5.<br>
Therefore, like Embodiment 1, after its pivotal operation from the neutral position SI, until the main speed change lever 80 reaches a set position La which is in the low speed range L (this position will be referred to as the low speed set position La hereinafter), the controlling means 84 maintains the first speed clutch CLl under its engaged condition, whereby the speed change transmission apparatus 3 is rendered into the first speed range and effects a speed change operation. Further, as the main speed change lever 80 is pivotally operated from the neutral position SI, the controlhng means 84 operates the stepless speed change section 20 from the speed change condition "-MAX" toward the speed change condition "+MAX". With this, in association with the operation of the main speed change lever 80 from the neutral position SI, the output rotational speed of the output shaft<br><br>
170 is increased steplessly from "0". When the main speed change lever 80 reaches the low speed set position La, the output rotational speed of the output shaft 170 becomes "B21". Under this condition, the controlling means 84 switches over the first speed clutch CLl into the disengaged condition and switches over the second speed clutch CL2 into the engaged condition, respectively, whereby the speed change transmission apparatus 3 is switched into the second speed range. Thereafter, until the mairi speed change lever 80 is moved from the low speed set position LI to the intermediate position C, the controUing means 84 maintains the second speed clutch CL2 under the engaged condition, whereby the speed change transmission apparatus 3 is maintained in the second speed range and effects speed change operation. Further, as the main speed change lever 80 is pivotally operated from the low speed set position La, the controUing means 84 operates the stepless speed change section 20 from the speed change condition "+MAX" toward the speed change condition "-MAX". With this, in association with the operation of the main speed change lever 80 from the low speed set position La, the output rotational speed of the output shaft 170 is increased steplessly from "B21". When the main speed change lever 80 reaches the intermediate position C, the output rotational speed of the output shaft 170 becomes "B22". Under this condition, the controlling means 84 switches over the second speed clutch CL2 into the disengaged condition and switches over the third speed clutch CL3 into the engaged condition, respectively, whereby the speed change transmission apparatus 3 is switched into the third speed range.<br>
Thereafter, until the main speed change lever 80 is moved from the intermediate position C to a set position Ha in the high speed range H (this position will be referred to as the high speed set position Ha hereinafter), the controlling means 84 maintains the third speed clutch CL3 under the engaged condition, whereby the speed change transmission apparatus 3 is maintained in the third speed range and effects speed change operation. Further, as the main speed change lever 80 is pivotally operated from the intermediate position C, the controlling means 84 operates the stepless speed change section 20 from the speed change position "-MAX" toward the speed change position "+MAX". With this, in association with the pivotal operation of the main speed change lever 80 from the intermediate position C, the output rotational speed of the output shaft 170 is increased steplessly from<br><br>
"B22". When the main speed change lever 80 reaches the high speed set position Ha, the output rotational speed of the output shaft 170 becomes "B23". Under this condition, the controlling means 84 switches over the third speed clutch CL3 into the disengaged condition and switches over the fourth speed clutch CL4 into the engaged condition, respectively, whereby the speed change transmission apparatus 3 is switched into the fourth speed range. Thereafter, until the main speed change lever 80 is moved from the high speed set position Ha to reach the maximum speed position Max, the controlling means 84 maintains the fourth speed clutch CL4 under the engaged condition, whereby the speed change transmission apparatus 3 is maintained in the fourth speed range and effects speed change operation. Still further, as the main speed change lever 80 is pivotally operated from the high speed set position Ha, the controlhng means 84 operates the stepless speed change device 20 from the speed condition "+MAX" toward "-MAX". With this, in association with the pivotal operation of the main speed change lever 80 from the high speed set position Ha, the output rotational speed by the output shaft 170 is steplessly increased from "B23". When the main speed change lever 80 reaches the maximum speed position Max, the controlhng means 84 has maintained the fourth clutch CL4 under the engaged condition, thus rendering the speed change transmission apparatus 3 in the fourth speed range; and also the controlhng means 84 operates the stepless speed change section 20 to the speed change condition "-MAX", whereby the output rotational speed by the output shaft 170 becomes the maximum speed "B24".<br>

The horizontal axis in FIG. 13 represents the speed change conditions of the stepless speed change section 20 and the vertical axis represents the output speeds by the output shaft 271. The sign "-MAX" on the horizontal axis represents the speed change condition where the output speed by the motor shaft 22 of the stepless speed change section 20 is maximum in the reverse rotation direction.

As shown in these figures, when the first clutch Cl and the low speed clutch CH are operated into the engaged condition while the second clutch CL2 and the high speed clutch CH are operated to the disengaged condition, the speed change output section 203b operates such that the combined drive forces outputted fi-om the first output member 241 and the second output member 242 of the planetary transmission section 203a are transmitted in the first speed range by the first clutch Cl, the low speed clutch CL and the low speed transmission gears 273, 274 to the output shaft 271 and from this output shaft 271 to the forward/reverse switchover device 30. When the speed change output section 203a is operated as described above, if the stepless speed change section 20 is speed changed from "-MAX" toward<br><br>
"+MAX", then, in association therewith, the output speed of the output shaft 271 is steplessly increased from "0". When the stepless speed change section 20 reaches "+MAX", the output speed of the output shaft 170 becomes "Bl".<br>
When the second clutch C2 and the low speed clutch CL are operated into the engaged condition while the first clutch CI and the high speed clutch CH are operated to the disengaged condition, the speed change output section 203b operates such that the combined drive forces outputted from the first output member 241 and the second output member 242 of the planetary transmission section 203a are transmitted in the second speed range by the second clutch 02, the low speed clutch CL and the low speed transmission gears 273, 274 to the output shaft 271 and firom this output shaft 271 to the forward/reverse switchover device 30. When the speed change output section 203b is operated as described above, if the stepless speed change section 20 is decelerated from "+MAX", then, in association therewith, the output speed of the output shaft 271 is steplessly increased from "Bl". When the stepless speed change section 20 reaches "Al", the rotational speed of the output shaft 271 becomes "B2".<br>
When the first clutch CI and the high speed clutch CH are operated into the engaged condition while the second clutch CL2 and the low speed clutch CL are operated to the disengaged condition, the speed change output section 203b operates such that the combined drive forces outputted from the first output member 241 and the second output member 242 of the planetary transmission section 203a are transmitted in the thfrd speed range by the first clutch CI, the high speed clutch CH and the high speed transmission gears 275, 276 to the output shaft 271 and from this output shaft 271 to the forward/reverse switchover device 30. When the speed change output section 203b is operated as described above, if the stepless speed change section 20 is operated from "Al" toward "+MAX", then, in association therewith, the output speed of the output shaft 271 is steplessly increased from "B2". When the stepless speed change section 20 reaches the speed change condition "+MAX", the output speed of the output shaft 271 becomes "B3".<br>
When the second clutch C2 and the high speed clutch CH are operated into the engaged condition while the first clutch Cl and the low speed clutch CL are operated to the disengaged condition, the speed change output section 203b operates such that the combined drive forces outputted<br><br>
from the first output member 241 and the second output member 242 of the planetary transmission section 203a are transmitted in the fourth speed range by the second clutch C2, the high speed clutch CH and the high speed transmission gears 275, 276 to the output shaft 271 and from this output shaft 271 to the forward/reverse switchover device 30.

FIG. 14 is a block diagram of a traveUng control apparatus included in a tractor. This traveling control apparatus differs from the traveUng control apparatus shown in FIG. 5 only in the respect of the names of the clutches. Therefore, detailed explanation thereof will not be repeated.<br>
Next, operations of the main speed change lever 80 and the graph shown in FIG. 13 will be explained.<br>
After its pivotal operation from the neutral position SI, untU the main speed change lever 80 reaches a set position La which is in the low speed range L (this position will be referred to as the low speed set position La hereinafter), the controlhng means 84 maintains the first clutch CI and the low speed clutch under the engaged condition, whereby the speed change transmission apparatus 203 is rendered into the first speed range and effects a speed change operation. Further, as the main speed change lever 80 is pivotally operated from the neutral position SI, the controlling means 84 operates the stepless speed change section 20 from the speed change condition "-MAX' toward the speed change condition "+MAX'. With this, in association with the operation of the main speed change lever 80 from the neutral position SI, the output speed of the output shaft 271 is increased steplessly from "0". When the main speed change lever 80 reaches the low speed set position La, the output speed of the output shaft 271 becomes "Bl". Under this condition, the controlling means 84 maintains the low speed clutch CL at the engaged condition and switches over the second clutch C2 into the engaged condition, respectively, whereby the speed change transmission apparatus 203 is switched into the second speed range. Thereafter, untU the main speed change lever 80 is moved from the low speed<br><br>
set position La to the intermediate position C, the controlling means 84 maintains the second clutch C2 and the low speed clutch under the engaged condition, whereby the speed change transmission apparatus 203 is maintained in the second speed range and effects speed change operation.<br>
Further, as the main speed change lever 80 is pivotally operated from the low speed set position La, the controlling means 84 operates the stepless speed change section 20 from the speed change condition "+MAX" toward the forward rotation speed "Al". With this, in association with the operation of the main speed change lever 80 from the low speed set position La, the output speed of the output shaft 271 is increased steplessly from "Bl". When the main speed change lever 80 reaches the intermediate position C, the output speed of the output shaft 271 becomes "B2". Under this condition, the controlling means 84 switches over the first clutch CI and the high speed clutch CH into the engaged condition, respectively, whereby the speed change transmission apparatus 203 is switched into the third speed range. Thereafter, until the main speed change lever 80 is moved from the intermediate position C to a set position Ha in the high speed range H (this position will be referred to as the high speed set position Ha hereinafter), the controlhng means 84 maintains the first clutch CI and the high speed clutch CH under the engaged condition, whereby the speed change transmission apparatus 203 is rendered into the third speed range and effects speed change operation. Further, as the main speed change lever 80 is pivotally operated from the intermediate position C, the controlling means 84 operates the stepless speed change section 20 from the forward rotation speed "Al" toward "+MAX". With this, in association with the pivotal operation of the main speed change lever 80 from the intermediate position C, the output speed of the output shaft: 271 is increased steplessly from "B2". When the main speed change lever 80 reaches the high speed set position Ha, the output speed of the output shaft 271 becomes "B3". Under this condition, the controlling means 84 maintains the high speed clutch CH at the engaged condition and switches over the second clutch C3 into the engaged condition, respectively, whereby the speed change transmission apparatus 203 is switched into the fourth speed range. Thereafter, until the main speed change lever 80 is moved from the high speed set position Ha to reach the maximum speed position Max, the controlling means 84 maintains the second clutch  C2  and the high speed clutch  CH under the engaged condition,<br><br>
whereby the speed change transmission apparatus 203 is rendered into the fourth speed range and effects speed change operation.<br>
Still further, as the main speed change lever 80 is pivotally operated from the high speed set position Ha, the controUing means 84 operates the stepless speed change device 20 from the speed condition "+MAX" toward "■ MAX". With this, in association with the pivotal operation of the main speed change lever 80 from the high speed set position Ha, the output speed by the output shaft 271 is steplessly increased from "B3". When the main speed change lever 80 reaches the maximum speed position Max, the controlling means 84 has maintained the second clutch C2 and the high speed clutch CH under the engaged condition, thus rendering the speed change transmission apparatus 203 in the fourth speed range; and also the controlling means 84 operates the stepless speed change section 20 to the speed change condition "■ MAX", whereby the output speed by the output shaft 271 becomes the maximum speed "B4".<br>
In the above-de scribed traveling, if the forwardyreverse lever 81 is set to the forward position F, then, the controUing means 84 operates the forward clutch CF to the engaged condition and operates the reverse clutch CB to the disengaged condition, respectively. With this, the forward/reverse switchover device 30 is rendered into the forward traveling condition, so that the output force from the output shaft 271 is converted to the forward drive force and transmitted as such to the rear wheel differential mechanism 5 and the front wheel differential mechanism 9 and the tractor travels forwardly. On the other hand, if the forward/reverse lever 81 is set to the reverse position R, the controlling means 84 operates the forward clutch CF to the disengaged condition and operates the reverse clutch CR to the engaged condition, respectively. With this, the forward/reverse switchover device 30 is rendered into the reverse traveling condition, so that the output force from the output shaft 271 is converted to the reverse drive force and transmitted as such to the rear wheel differential mechanism 5 and the front wheel differential mechanism 9 and the tractor travels reversely.<br>
Incidentally, if the forward/reverse lever 81 is operated to the neutral position S2, the controlling means 84 operates the forward clutch CF and the reverse clutch CR to the disengaged conditions. With this, the power transmission to the rear wheel differential mechanism 5 and the front wheel differential mechanism 9 is stopped and the tractor enters a stop condition.<br><br>

As shown in this figure, when the speed change output section 503b is<br><br>
operated to the first speed range, if the stepless speed change section 20 is operated from "-MAX" toward "-i-MAX", then, in association therewith, the output speed by the output shaft 571 is increased steplessly from "0". When the stepless speed change section 20 reaches "-t-MAX", the output speed by the output shafb 571 becomes "Blc". When the speed change output section 503b is operated to the second speed range, if the stepless speed change section 20 is decelerated from "+MAX", then, in association therewith, the output speed by the output shaft 571 is increased steplessly from "Blc". When the stepless speed change section 20 reaches "A4", the output speed by the output shaft 571 becomes "B2c". When the speed change output section 503b is operated to the third speed range, if the stepless speed change section 20 is speed changed from "A4" toward "+MAX", then, in association therewith, the output speed by the output shaft 571 is increased steplessly from "B2c".

The sign "N" represents the neutral condition of the stepless speed change section 20. The sign "+MAX" on the horizontal axis represents the speed change condition when the output speed by the motor shaft 22 of the stepless speed<br><br>
change section 20 is at the highest speed in the forward rotation direction. An operational position SI of the main speed change lever 80 shown in this figure is the neutral position. An operational position Fa of the main speed change lever 80 is an operational position where the main speed change lever 80 has been operated from the neutral position 81 by 1/4 stroke of its entire operational stroke.

However, with the speed change control device included in the speed change transmission apparatus 503 according to Embodiment 7, in case the speed change transmission apparatus 503 enters the first speed range to effect a speed change operation and the output speed by the output shaft 571 is varied between "0" and "Blc" and in case the speed change transmission apparatus 503 enters the second speed range to effect a speed change operation and the output speed by the output shaft 571 is varied between "Blc" and "B2c", the speed change operations can be effected with good operational feel.<br>
That is, FIG. 22 is an explanatory figure showing relationship among operational positions of a main speed change lever 80 of a speed change control device to be compared with the speed change control device included in the speed change transmission apparatus 503 according to Embodiment 7, speed change conditions of the stepless speed change section 20 and output speeds by the output shaft 571. The horizontal axis in this figure shows the speed change conditions of the stepless speed change section 20 and the vertical axis represents the output speeds by the output shaft 571. The sign " MAX" on the horizontal axis represents the speed change condition when the output speed by the motor shaft 22 of the stepless speed change section 20 is at the highest speed in the reverse rotation direction. The sign "N" represents the neutral condition of the stepless speed change section 20. The sign "+IVIAX" on the horizontal axis represents the speed change condition when the output speed by the motor shaft 22 of the stepless speed<br><br>
change section 20 is at the highest speed in the forward rotation direction. The operational position SI of the main speed change lever 80 shown in this figure is the neutral position. The operational position Fa of the main speed change lever 80 is an operational position where the main speed change lever 80 has been operated from the neutral position SI by 1/4 stroke of its entire operational stroke.<br>

As shown in FIG. 22, with the speed change control device for comparison, when the main speed change lever 80 is operated to the operational position Fa, the output speed by the output shaft 571 becomes "Blc". For this reason, as shown in FIG. 22, in the case of the speed change control device for comparison, there occurs a large difference between a magnitude VLl of output speed change occurring when the main speed change lever 80 is operated by a standard stroke operation on the lower speed side than the operational position Fa and a magnitude VHl of output speed change occurring when the main speed change lever 80 is operated by the standard stroke operation on the higher speed side than the operational position Fa and in the second speed range. On the other hand, as shown in FIG. 21, in the case of the speed change control device according to Embodiment 7, thee occurs a smaller difference a magnitude VL2 of output speed change occurring when the main speed change lever 80 is operated by the standard stroke operation on the lower speed side than the operational position Fa and a magnitude VH2 of output speed change occurring when the main speed change lever 80 is operated by the standard stroke operation on the higher speed side than the operational position Fa and in the second speed range.<br>
