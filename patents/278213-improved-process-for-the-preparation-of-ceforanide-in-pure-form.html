				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of the compound of formula (I) and also provides novel salts of compound of formula (I).<br>
 <br>
The compound of formula (I) is known as Ceforanide. The novel N,N- dicylcohexyl ethylenediamine salt of Ceforanide prepared according to this invention are stable and found to be useful in the purification of compound of formula (I).<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Ceforanide is a semisynthetic second-generation cephalosporin, and is chemically known as 7-(2-Aminomethylphenylacetamido)-3-(l- carboxymethyltetrazol-5-ylthiomethyl) -3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid. Ceforanide, which is administered intramuscularly or intravenously and is found to be useful to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections, such as respiratory tract infections, skin infections and urinary tract infections and is disclosed in US Patent No. 4,100,346.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,118,563 describes the preparation of Ceforanide by the reduction with hydrogen and Raney nickel of the corresponding 2-azidomethyl compound.<br>
The Ceforanide thus prepared according to US 4,100,346 &amp; US 4,118,563 are not suitable for injectable as it contains impurities and even starting material in the range up to 10% that are difficult to remove. Hence purification of Ceforanide is inevitable. In order to purify crude Ceforanide, prior art processes utilize column chromatography or extensive carbon treatment plus recrystallization.<br>
US patent No. 4,448,958 claims N,N-Dimethylbenzylammonium-7- [.alpha.-(2-aminomethylphenyl)acetamido)-3-[(l-carboxymethyltetrazol-5- ylthio)methyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylate. Even though this salt is used in the purification of Ceforanide, this salt is not preferable due to the corrosive nature of N,N-Dimethylbenzylamine since it causes burns to the eye on contact and may cause permanent damage. Hence, because of this safety issue this amine is not found to be useful from industrial point of view.<br>
During our continued search we have identified certain novel salts, which yield the compound of formula (I) in good purity, and yield.<br>
Objective of the Invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation and purification of the compound of formula (I) in good purity, and quantity.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a N,N-dicylcohexyl ethylenediamine salt of Ceforanide, which are safe to handle in industry. <br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provide a process for the preparation of compound of formula (I)<br>
 <br>
which comprises the steps of:<br>
i)	reacting the compound (7-amino-3-[5-(l-carboxymethyl-l,2,3,4- tetrazolyl)thiomethyl]-3 -cephem-4-carboxylic acid) of formula (II) or its reactive derivative with compound of formula (III) or its active derivative wherein Rj denotes lower alkyl in the presence of organic solvent,<br>
 <br>
ii)	isolating the compound of formula (I),<br>
iii)	forming N,N-dicylcohexyl ethylenediamine salt of compound of formula (I) in the presence of solvent,<br>
iv)	isolating pure Ceforanide of formula (I) from N,N-dicylcohexyl ethylenediamine salt.<br>
The process is shown in Scheme-1<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the compound of formula (II) is employed either in free form or in reactive form. The reactive form of compound of formula (II) includes 1) silyl reactive derivative; the silyl derivative was prepared by reacting the compound of formula (II) with silylation agents like hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS), trimethylsilyl iodide	(TMSI),	N,0-bis-(trimethylsilyl)-acetamide	(BSA),<br>
methyltrimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide	(MSTFA),	N,0-bis-<br>
(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) or mixtures there of; 2) salt of compound of formula (II), the salts of compound of formula include trimethylamine, dimethylethylamine, triethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, pyridine, diisopropylethylamine, N-methylpiperidine, N-ethylpiperidine, tetramethylguanidine,	pentamethylguanidine,	tetraethylguanidine,<br>

In another embodiment of the present invention compound of formula (III) is activated as acid halides, mixed anhydrides, active esters, and active amides.<br>
Mixed anhydrides of compound of formula (III) formed by reacting the carboxylic acid of formula (III) or its salt with a lower-alkyl chloroformate such as ethyl chloroformate, benzyl chloroformate, isobutyl chloroformate or pivaloyl chloride in the presence or absence of catalytic amount of pyridine hydrobromide, N,N- dimethyl amino pyridine. The mixed carboxylic-carbonic anhydride thus formed is usually used in situ to acylate the said compound of formula (II). Alternatively acylation of compound of formula (II) comprises contacting the said compound of formula (III) with the appropriate carboxylic acid in the presence of certain agents known in the art for forming peptide bonds. Such agents include carbodiimides, for example, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the solvent used in step (i) is selected from methyl formate, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, butyl acetate, methyl propionate, acetone, diethyl ether, ethyl propyl ether, ethyl butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, acetonitrile, propionitrile, butyronitrile, isobutyronitrile, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene and anisole, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloroethane, trichloroethane, dibromoethane, propylene dichloride, carbon tetrachloride, hexane, heptane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, cycloheptane and cyclooctane, dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidinone, dimethylsulfoxide, etc. These solvents are used singly or in admixture of at least two of them. These solvents may contain water as required. Optionally a base may be present during acylation.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the solvent used in step (iii) is selected from ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, acetonitrile, acetone, ethyl acetate, THF, DMAc, DMF, water or mixtures thereof.<br>
In one more embodiment of the present invention the N,N-dicylcohexyl ethylenediamine salt of Ceforanide is converted into Ceforanide by reacting the salt with acid such as HC1, sulfuric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, perchloric acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, trifluoro acetic acid, or cationic exchange resin like UBK530 resin in the solvent selected from ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, acetonitrile, acetone, ethyl acetate, THF, DMAc, DMF, water or mixtures thereof.<br>
The N,N-dicylcohexyl ethylenediamine salt of Ceforanide is stable and do not have any safety issue that are associated with the known N,N- Dimethylbenzylammonium salt of Ceforanide. Apart from this, cost of preparation of N,N-dicylcohexyl ethylenediamine salt of Ceforanide is less as compared to the known N,N-Dimethylbenzylammonium salt of Ceforanide.<br>
In one more embodiment of the present invention, this invention further provides a process for preparing sterile Ceforanide which comprises dissolving the Ceforanide in water and optionally in the presence of solvent like methanol, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, tetrahydrofuran and the like using a base selected from ammonia, sodium bicarbonate, triethyl amine and the like, subjecting the clear solution to sterile filtration in sterile area, precipitating the product by adjusting the pH using formic acid or acetic acid.<br>
