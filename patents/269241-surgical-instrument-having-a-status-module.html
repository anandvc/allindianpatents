BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	This application discloses an invention that is related, generally and in various<br>
embodiments, to visual and audible feedback systems for motor-driven surgical instruments.<br>
[0003]	Endoscopic surgical instruments are often preferred over traditional open surgical<br>
devices since a smaller incision tends to reduce the post-operative recovery time and complications. Consequently, significant development has gone into a range of endoscopic surgical instruments that are suitable for precise placement of a distal end effector at a desired surgical site through a cannula of a trocar. These distal end effectors engage the tissue in a number of ways to achieve a diagnostic or therapeutic effect (e.g., endocutter, grasper, cutter,<br>
-3-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
staplers, clip applier, access device, drug/gene therapy delivery device, and energy device using ultrasound, RF, laser, etc.).<br>
[0004]	Known surgical staplers include an end effector that simultaneously makes a<br>
longitudinal incision in tissue and applies lines of staples on opposing sides of the incision. The end effector includes a pair of cooperating jaw members that, if the instrument is intended for endoscopic or laparoscopic applications, are capable of passing through a cannula passageway. One of the jaw members receives a staple cartridge having at least two laterally spaced rows of staples. The other jaw member defines an anvil having staple-forming pockets aligned with the rows of staples in the cartridge. The instrument includes a plurality of reciprocating wedges which, when driven distally, pass through openings in the staple cartridge and engage drivers supporting the staples to effect the firing of the staples toward the anvil.<br>
[0005]	An example of a surgical stapler suitable for endoscopic applications is described<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 5,465,895, which discloses an endocutter with distinct closing and firing actions. A clinician using this device is able to close the jaw members upon tissue to position the tissue prior to firing. Once the clinician has determined that the jaw members are properly gripping tissue, the clinician can then fire the surgical stapler with either single or multiple firing strokes, thereby severing and stapling the tissue. The simultaneous severing and stapling avoids complications that may arise when performing such actions sequentially with different surgical tools that respectively only sever or staple.<br>
[0006]	One specific advantage of being able to close upon tissue before firing is that the<br>
clinician is able to verify via an endoscope that the desired location for the cut has been achieved, including a sufficient amount of tissue has been captured between opposing jaws. Otherwise, opposing jaws may be drawn too close together, especially pinching at their distal<br>
-4-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
ends, and thus not effectively forming closed staples in the severed tissue. At the other extreme,<br>
an excessive amount of clamped tissue may cause binding and an incomplete firing.<br>
[0007]	Endoscopic staplers/cutters continue to increase in complexity and function with<br>
each generation. One of the main reasons for this is the quest for lower force-to-fire (FTF) to a level that all or a great majority of surgeons can handle. One known solution to lower FTF it use CO2 or electrical motors. These devices have not faired much better than traditional hand-powered devices, but for a different reason. Surgeons typically prefer to experience proportionate force distribution to that being experienced by the end-effector in the forming the staple to assure them that the cutting/stapling cycle is complete, with the upper limit within the capabilities of most surgeons (usually around 15-30 lbs). They also typically want to maintain control of deploying the staple and being able to stop at anytime if the forces felt in the handle of the device feel too great or for some other clinical reason. These user-feedback effects are not suitably realizable in present motor-driven endocutters. As a result, there is a general lack of acceptance by physicians of motor-drive endocutters where the cutting/stapling operation is actuated by merely pressing a button.<br>
[0008]	With current surgical instruments, the status of the instrument is generally not<br>
provided to a user of the surgical instrument during a procedure. For example, with current mechanical endocutters, the presence of the staple cartridge, the position of the knife, the time elapsed since clamping, the magnitude of the firing force, etc. are generally not provided to the user. Without visual and/or audible feedback, each user must rely on his or her own "feel" to determine the status of the surgical instrument, thereby creating inefficiencies, inconsistencies, and potential damage to the surgical instrument.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0030]	It is to be understood that at least some of the figures and descriptions of the<br>
disclosed invention have been simplified to illustrate elements that are relevant for a clear understanding of the disclosed invention, while eliminating, for purposes of clarity, other elements. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, however, that these and other elements may be desirable. However, because such elements are well known in the art, and because they do not facilitate a better understanding of the disclosed invention, a discussion of such elements is not provided herein.<br>
[0031]	Figures 1 and 2 depict a surgical cutting and fastening instrument 10 according to<br>
various embodiments of the present invention. The illustrated embodiment is an endoscopic<br>
instrument and, in general, the embodiments of the instrument 10 described herein are<br>
endoscopic surgical cutting and fastening instruments. It should be noted, however, that<br>
according to other embodiments of the present invention, the instrument may be a non-<br>
endoscopic surgical cutting and fastening instrument, such as a laparoscopic instrument.<br>
[0032]	The surgical instrument 10 depicted in Figures 1 and 2 comprises a handle 6, a<br>
shaft 8, and an articulating end effector 12 pivotally connected to the shaft 8 at an articulation pivot 14. An articulation control 16 may be provided adjacent to the handle 6 to effect rotation<br>
-8-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
may pivotally draw the firing trigger 20 toward the pistol grip 26 to cause the stapling and severing of clamped tissue in the end effector 12. In other embodiments, different types of clamping members besides the anvil 24 could be used, such as, for example, an opposing jaw, etc.<br>
[0035]	It will be appreciated that the terms "proximal" and "distal" are used herein with<br>
reference to a clinician gripping the handle 6 of an instrument 10. Thus, the end effector 12 is<br>
distal with respect to the more proximal handle 6. It will be further appreciated that, for<br>
convenience and clarity, spatial terms such as "vertical" and "horizontal" are used herein with<br>
respect to the drawings. However, surgical instruments are used in many orientations and<br>
positions, and these terms are not intended to be limiting and absolute.<br>
[0036]	The closure trigger 18 may be actuated first. Once the clinician is satisfied with<br>
the positioning of the end effector 12, the clinician may draw back the closure trigger 18 to its fully closed, locked position proximate to the pistol grip 26. The firing trigger 20 may then be actuated. The firing trigger 20 returns to the open position (shown in Figures 1 and 2) when the clinician removes pressure, as described more fully below. A release button 160 on the handle 6, and in this example, on the pistol grip 26 of the handle 6, when depressed may release the locked closure trigger 18.<br>
[0037]	Figure 3 is an exploded view of the end effector 12 according to various<br>
embodiments. As shown in the illustrated embodiment, the end effector 12 may include, in addition to the previously-mentioned channel 22 and anvil 24, a cutting instrument 32, a sled 33, a staple cartridge 34 that is removably seated in the channel 22, and a helical screw shaft 36. The cutting instrument 32 may be, for example, a knife. The anvil 24 may be pivotably opened and closed at a pivot point 25 connected to the proximate end of the channel 22. The anvil 24<br>
-10-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
may also include a tab 27 at its proximate end that is inserted into a component of the mechanical closure system (described further below) to open and close the anvil 24. When the closure trigger 18 is actuated, that is, drawn in by a user of the instrument 10, the anvil 24 may pivot about the pivot point 25 into the clamped or closed position. If clamping of the end effector 12 is satisfactory, the operator may actuate the firing trigger 20, which, as explained in more detail below, causes the knife 32 and sled 33 to travel longitudinally along the channel 22, thereby cutting tissue clamped within the end effector 12. The movement of the sled 33 along the channel 22 causes the staples of the staple cartridge 34 to be driven through the severed tissue and against the closed anvil 24, which turns the staples to fasten the severed tissue. U.S. Patent No. 6,978,921, entitled "Surgical Stapling Instrument Incorporating An E-Beam Firing Mechanism," which is incorporated herein by reference, provides more details about such two-stroke cutting and fastening instruments. According to various embodiments, the sled 33 may be an integral part of the cartridge 34, such that when the knife 32 retracts following the cutting operation, the sled 33 does not retract.<br>
[0038]	It should be noted that although the embodiments of the instrument 10 described<br>
herein employ an end effector 12 that staples the severed tissue, in other embodiments different techniques for fastening or sealing the severed tissue may be used. For example, end effectors that use RF energy or adhesives to fasten the severed tissue may also be used. U.S. Patent No. 5,810,811, entitled "Electrosurgical Hemostatic Device," which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses a cutting instrument that uses RF energy to fasten the severed tissue. U.S. Patent Application No. 11/267,811, entitled "Surgical Stapling Instruments Structured For Delivery Of Medical Agents" and U.S. Patent Application No. 11/267,383, entitled "Surgical Stapling Instruments Structured For Pump-Assisted Delivery Of Medical Agents,"both of which<br>
-11-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
are also incorporated herein by reference, disclose cutting instruments that use adhesives to<br>
fasten the severed tissue. Accordingly, although the description herein refers to cutting/stapling<br>
operations and the like below, it should be recognized that this is an exemplary embodiment and<br>
is not meant to be limiting. Other tissue-fastening techniques may also be used.<br>
[0039]	Figures 4 and 5 are exploded views and Figure 6 is a side view of the end effector<br>
12 and shaft 8 according to various embodiments. As shown in the illustrated embodiment, the shaft 8 may include a proximate closure tube 40 and a distal closure tube 42 pivotably linked by a pivot links 44. The distal closure tube 42 includes an opening 45 into which the tab 27 on the anvil 24 is inserted in order to open and close the anvil 24, as further described below. Disposed inside the closure tubes 40, 42 may be a proximate spine tube 46. Disposed inside the proximate spine tube 46 may be a main rotational (or proximate) drive shaft 48 that communicates with a secondary (or distal) drive shaft 50 via a bevel gear assembly 52. The secondary drive shaft 50 is connected to a drive gear 54 that engages a proximate drive gear 56 of the helical screw shaft 36. When the main drive shaft 48 is caused to rotate by actuation of the firing trigger 20 (as explained in more detail below), the bevel gear assembly 52a-c causes the secondary drive shaft 50 to rotate, which in turn, because of the engagement of the drive gears 54, 56, causes the helical screw shaft 36 to rotate, which causes the knife/sled driving member 32 to travel longitudinally along the channel 22 to cut any tissue clamped within the end effector 12. The vertical bevel gear 52b may sit and pivot in an opening 57 in the distal end of the proximate spine tube 46. A distal spine tube 58 may be used to enclose the secondary drive shaft 50 and the drive gears 54, 56. Collectively, the main drive shaft 48, the secondary drive shaft 50, and the articulation assembly (e.g., the bevel gear assembly 52a-c) are sometimes referred to herein as the "main drive shaft assembly."<br>
-12-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
[0040]	A bearing 38 is threaded on the helical drive screw 36. The bearing 36 is also<br>
connected to the knife 32. When the helical drive screw 36 forward rotates, the bearing 38 traverses the helical drive screw 36 distally, driving the cutting instrument 32 and, in the process, the sled 33 to perform the cutting/stapling operation. The sled 33 may be made of, for example, plastic, and may have a sloped distal surface. As the sled 33 traverses the channel 22, the sloped forward surface may push up or drive the staples in the staple cartridge 34 through the clamped tissue and against the anvil 24. The anvil 24 turns the staples, thereby stapling the severed tissue. When the knife 32 is retracted, the knife 32 and sled 33 may become disengaged, thereby leaving the sled 33 at the distal end of the channel 22.<br>
[0041]	Because of the lack of user feedback for the cutting/stapling operation, there is a<br>
general lack of acceptance among physicians of motor-driven surgical instruments where the cutting/stapling operation is actuated by merely pressing a button. In contrast, embodiments of the present invention provide a motor-driven endocutter with user-feedback of the deployment, force, and/or position of the cutting instrument in the end effector.<br>
[0042]	Figures 7-10 illustrate an exemplary embodiment of a motor-driven endocutter,<br>
and in particular the handle 6 thereof, that provides user-feedback regarding the deployment and loading force of the cutting instrument in the end effector. In addition, the embodiment may use power provided by the user in retracting the firing trigger 20 to power the device (a so-called "power assist" mode). As shown in the illustrated embodiment, the handle 6 includes exterior lower side pieces 59, 60 and exterior upper side pieces 61, 62 that fit together to form, in general, the exterior of the handle 6. A battery 64, such as a Li ion battery, may be provided in the pistol grip portion 26 of the handle 6. The battery 64 powers a motor 65 disposed in an upper portion of the pistol grip portion 26 of the handle 6. According to various embodiments, the motor 65<br>
-13-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
may be a DC brushed driving motor having a maximum rotation of, approximately, 5000 RPM. The motor 65 may drive a 90° bevel gear assembly 66 comprising a first bevel gear 68 and a second bevel gear 70. The bevel gear assembly 66 may drive a planetary gear assembly 72. The planetary gear assembly 72 may include a pinion gear 74 connected to a drive shaft 76. The pinion gear 74 may drive a mating ring gear 78 that drives a helical gear drum 80 via a drive shaft 82. A ring 84 may be threaded on the helical gear drum 80. Thus, when the motor 65 rotates, the ring 84 is caused to travel along the helical gear drum 80 by means of the interposed bevel gear assembly 66, planetary gear assembly 72 and ring gear 78.<br>
[0043]	The handle 6 may also include a run motor sensor 110 in communication with the<br>
firing trigger 20 to detect when the firing trigger 20 has been drawn in (or "closed") toward the pistol grip portion 26 of the handle 6 by the operator to thereby actuate the cutting/stapling operation by the end effector 12. The sensor 110 may be a proportional sensor such as, for example, a rheostat or variable resistor. When the firing trigger 20 is drawn in, the sensor 110 detects the movement, and sends an electrical signal indicative of the voltage (or power) to be supplied to the motor 65. When the sensor 110 is a variable resistor or the like, the rotation of the motor 65 may be generally proportional to the amount of movement of the firing trigger 20. That is, if the operator only draws or closes the firing trigger 20 in a little bit, the rotation of the motor 65 is relatively low. When the firing trigger 20 is fully drawn in (or in the fully closed position), the rotation of the motor 65 is at its maximum. In other words, the harder the user pulls on the firing trigger 20, the more voltage is applied to the motor 65, causing greater rates of rotation.<br>
[0044]	The handle 6 may include a middle handle piece 104 adjacent to the upper portion<br>
of the firing trigger 20. The handle 6 also may comprise a bias spring 112 connected between<br>
-14-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
posts on the middle handle piece 104 and the firing trigger 20. The bias spring 112 may bias the firing trigger 20 to its fully open position. In that way, when the operator releases the firing trigger 20, the bias spring 112 will pull the firing trigger 20 to its open position, thereby removing actuation of the sensor 110, thereby stopping rotation of the motor 65. Moreover, by virtue of the bias spring 112, any time a user closes the firing trigger 20, the user will experience resistance to the closing operation, thereby providing the user with feedback as to the amount of rotation exerted by the motor 65. Further, the operator could stop retracting the firing trigger 20 to thereby remove force from the sensor 100, to thereby stop the motor 65. As such, the user may stop the deployment of the end effector 12, thereby providing a measure of control of the cutting/fastening operation to the operator.<br>
[0045]	The distal end of the helical gear drum 80 includes a distal drive shaft 120 that<br>
drives a ring gear 122, which mates with a pinion gear 124. The pinion gear 124 is connected to the main drive shaft 48 of the main drive shaft assembly. In that way, rotation of the motor 65 causes the main drive shaft assembly to rotate, which causes actuation of the end effector 12, as described above.<br>
[0046]	The ring 84 threaded on the helical gear drum 80 may include a post 86 that is<br>
disposed within a slot 88 of a slotted arm 90. The slotted arm 90 has an opening 92 its opposite end 94 that receives a pivot pin 96 that is connected between the handle exterior side pieces 59, 60. The pivot pin 96 is also disposed through an opening 100 in the firing trigger 20 and an opening 102 in the middle handle piece 104.<br>
[0047]	In addition, the handle 6 may include a reverse motor (or end-of-stroke sensor)<br>
130 and a stop motor (or beginning-of-stroke) sensor 142. In various embodiments, the reverse motor sensor 130 may be a limit switch located at the distal end of the helical gear drum 80 such<br>
- 15-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
that the ring 84 threaded on the helical gear drum 80 contacts and trips the reverse motor sensor<br>
130 when the ring 84 reaches the distal end of the helical gear drum 80. The reverse motor<br>
sensor 130, when activated, sends a signal to the motor 65 to reverse its rotation direction,<br>
thereby withdrawing the knife 32 of the end effector 12 following the cutting operation.<br>
[0048]	The stop motor sensor 142 may be, for example, a normally-closed limit switch.<br>
In various embodiments, it may be located at the proximate end of the helical gear drum 80 so that the ring 84 trips the switch 142 when the ring 84 reaches the proximate end of the helical gear drum 80.<br>
[0049]	In operation, when an operator of the instrument 10 pulls back the firing trigger<br>
20, the sensor 110 detects the deployment of the firing trigger 20 and sends a signal to the motor 65 to cause forward rotation of the motor 65 at, for example, a rate proportional to how hard the operator pulls back the firing trigger 20. The forward rotation of the motor 65 in turn causes the ring gear 78 at the distal end of the planetary gear assembly 72 to rotate, thereby causing the helical gear drum 80 to rotate, causing the ring 84 threaded on the helical gear drum 80 to travel distally along the helical gear drum 80. The rotation of the helical gear drum 80 also drives the main drive shaft assembly as described above, which in turn causes deployment of the knife 32 in the end effector 12. That is, the knife 32 and sled 33 are caused to traverse the channel 22 longitudinally, thereby cutting tissue clamped in the end effector 12. Also, the stapling operation of the end effector 12 is caused to happen in embodiments where a stapling-type end effector is used.<br>
[0050]	By the time the cutting/stapling operation of the end effector 12 is complete, the<br>
ring 84 on the helical gear drum 80 will have reached the distal end of the helical gear drum 80, thereby causing the reverse motor sensor 130 to be tripped, which sends a signal to the motor 65<br>
-16-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
to cause the motor 65 to reverse its rotation. This in turn causes the knife 32 to retract, and also causes the ring 84 on the helical gear drum 80 to move back to the proximate end of the helical gear drum 80.<br>
[0051]	The middle handle piece 104 includes a backside shoulder 106 that engages the<br>
slotted arm 90 as best shown in Figures 8 and 9. The middle handle piece 104 also has a forward motion stop 107 that engages the firing trigger 20. The movement of the slotted arm 90 is controlled, as explained above, by rotation of the motor 65. When the slotted arm 90 rotates CCW as the ring 84 travels from the proximate end of the helical gear drum 80 to the distal end, the middle handle piece 104 will be free to rotate CCW. Thus, as the user draws in the firing trigger 20, the firing trigger 20 will engage the forward motion stop 107 of the middle handle piece 104, causing the middle handle piece 104 to rotate CCW. Due to the backside shoulder 106 engaging the slotted arm 90, however, the middle handle piece 104 will only be able to rotate CCW as far as the slotted arm 90 permits. In that way, if the motor 65 should stop rotating for some reason, the slotted arm 90 will stop rotating, and the user will not be able to further draw in the firing trigger 20 because the middle handle piece 104 will not be free to rotate CCW due to the slotted arm 90.<br>
[0052]	Figure 41 and 42 illustrate two states of a variable sensor that may be used as the<br>
run motor sensor 110 according to various embodiments of the present invention. The sensor 110 may include a face portion 280, a first electrode (A) 282, a second electrode (B) 284, and a compressible dielectric material 286 (e.g., EAP) between the electrodes 282, 284. The sensor 110 may be positioned such that the face portion 280 contacts the firing trigger 20 when retracted. Accordingly, when the firing trigger 20 is retracted, the dielectric material 286 is compressed, as shown in Figure 42, such that the electrodes 282, 284 are closer together. Since<br>
-17-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
the distance "b" between the electrodes 282, 284 is directly related to the impedance between the electrodes 282, 284, the greater the distance the more impedance, and the closer the distance the less impedance. In that way, the amount that the dielectric material 286 is compressed due to retraction of the firing trigger 20 (denoted as force "F" in Figure 42) is proportional to the impedance between the electrodes 282, 284, which can be used to proportionally control the motor 65.<br>
[0053]	Components of an exemplary closure system for closing (or clamping) the anvil<br>
24 of the end effector 12 by retracting the closure trigger 18 are also shown in Figures 7-10. In the illustrated embodiment, the closure system includes a yoke 250 connected to the closure trigger 18 by a pin 251 that is inserted through aligned openings in both the closure trigger 18 and the yoke 250. A pivot pin 252, about which the closure trigger 18 pivots, is inserted through another opening in the closure trigger 18 which is offset from where the pin 251 is inserted through the closure trigger 18. Thus, retraction of the closure trigger 18 causes the upper part of the closure trigger 18, to which the yoke 250 is attached via the pin 251, to rotate CCW. The distal end of the yoke 250 is connected, via a pin 254, to a first closure bracket 256. The first closure bracket 256 connects to a second closure bracket 258. Collectively, the closure brackets 256, 258 define an opening in which the proximate end of the proximate closure tube 40 (see Figure 4) is seated and held such that longitudinal movement of the closure brackets 256, 258 causes longitudinal motion by the proximate closure tube 40. The instrument 10 also includes a closure rod 260 disposed inside the proximate closure tube 40. The closure rod 260 may include a window 261 into which a post 263 on one of the handle exterior pieces, such as exterior lower side piece 59 in the illustrated embodiment, is disposed to fixedly connect the closure rod 260 to the handle 6. In that way, the proximate closure tube 40 is capable of moving longitudinally<br>
-18-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
relative to the closure rod 260. The closure rod 260 may also include a distal collar 267 that fits<br>
into a cavity 269 in proximate spine tube 46 and is retained therein by a cap 271 (see Figure 4).<br>
[0054]	In operation, when the yoke 250 rotates due to retraction of the closure trigger 18,<br>
the closure brackets 256, 258 cause the proximate closure tube 40 to move distally (i.e., away<br>
fromthe handle end of the instrument 10), which causes the distal closure tube 42 to move<br>
distally, which causes the anvil 24 to rotate about the pivot point 25 into the clamped or closed<br>
position. When the closure trigger 18 is unlocked from the locked position, the proximate<br>
closure tube 40 is caused to slide proximally, which causes the distal closure tube 42 to slide<br>
proximally, which by virtue of the tab 27 being inserted in the window 45 of the distal closure<br>
tube 42, causes the anvil 24 to pivot about the pivot point 25 into the open or undamped<br>
position. In that way, by retracting and locking the closure trigger 18, an operator may clamp<br>
tissue between the anvil 24 and channel 22, and may unclamp the tissue following the<br>
cutting/stapling operation by unlocking the closure trigger 18 from the locked position.<br>
[0055]	Figure 11 is a schematic diagram of an electrical circuit of the instrument 10<br>
according to various embodiments of the present invention. When an operator initially pulls in the firing trigger 20 after locking the closure trigger 18, the sensor 110 is activated, allowing current to flow therethrough. If the normally-open reverse motor sensor switch 130 is open (meaning the end of the end effector stroke has not been reached), current will flow to a single pole, double throw relay 132. Since the reverse motor sensor switch 130 is not closed, the coil 134 of the relay 132 will not be energized, so the relay 132 will be in its non-energized state. The circuit also includes a cartridge lockout sensor switch 136. If the end effector 12 includes a staple cartridge 34, the sensor switch 136 will be in the closed state, allowing current to flow.<br>
-19-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
Otherwise, if the end effector 12 does not include a staple cartridge 34, the sensor switch 136<br>
will be open, thereby preventing the battery 64 from powering the motor 65.<br>
[0056]	When the staple cartridge 34 is present, the sensor switch 136 is closed, which<br>
energizes a single pole, single throw relay 138. When the relay 138 is energized, current flows<br>
through the relay 138, through the variable resistor sensor 110, and to the motor 65 via a double<br>
pole, double throw relay 140, thereby powering the motor 65 and allowing it to rotate in the<br>
forward direction.<br>
[0057]	When the end effector 12 reaches the end of its stroke, the reverse motor sensor<br>
130 will be activated, thereby closing the switch 130 and energizing the relay 132. This causes<br>
the relay 132 to assume its energized state (not shown in Figure 11), which causes current to<br>
bypass the cartridge lockout sensor switch 136 and variable resistor 110, and instead causes<br>
current to flow to both the normally-closed double pole, double throw relay 140 and back to the<br>
motor 65, but in a manner, via the relay 140, that causes the motor 65 to reverse its rotational<br>
direction.<br>
[0058]	Because the stop motor sensor switch 142 is normally-closed, current will flow<br>
back to the relay 132 to keep it energized until the switch 142 opens. When the knife 32 is fully<br>
retracted, the stop motor sensor switch 142 is activated, causing the switch 142 to open, thereby<br>
removing power from the motor 65.<br>
[0059]	In other embodiments, rather than a proportional-type sensor 110, an on-off type<br>
sensor could be used. In such embodiments, the rate of rotation of the motor 65 would not be<br>
proportional to the force applied by the operator. Rather, the motor 65 would generally rotate at<br>
a constant rate. But the operator would still experience force feedback because the firing trigger<br>
20 is geared into the gear drive train.<br>

[0060]	Figure 12 is a side-view of the handle 6 of a power-assist motorized endocutter<br>
according to another embodiment. The embodiment of Figure 12 is similar to that of Figures 7-<br>
10 except that in the embodiment of Figure 12, there is no slotted arm 90 connected to the ring<br>
84 threaded on the helical gear drum 80. Instead, in the embodiment of Figure 12, the ring 84<br>
includes a sensor portion 114 that moves with the ring 84 as the ring 84 advances down (and<br>
back) on the helical gear drum 80. The sensor portion 114 includes a notch 116. The reverse<br>
motor sensor 130 may be located at the distal end of the notch 116 and the stop motor sensor 142<br>
may be located at the proximate end of the notch 116. As the ring 84 moves down the helical<br>
gear drum 80 (and back), the sensor portion 114 moves with it. Further, as shown in Figure 12,<br>
the middle piece 104 may have an arm 118 that extends into the notch 116.<br>
[0061]	In operation, as an operator of the instrument 10 retracts in the firing trigger 20<br>
toward the pistol grip 26, the run motor sensor 110 detects the motion and sends a signal to power the motor 65, which causes, among other things, the helical gear drum 80 to rotate. As the helical gear drum 80 rotates, the ring 84 threaded on the helical gear drum 80 advances (or retracts, depending on the rotation). Also, due to the pulling in of the firing trigger 20, the middle piece 104 is caused to rotate CCW with the firing trigger 20 due to the forward motion stop 107 that engages the firing trigger 20. The CCW rotation of the middle piece 104 cause the arm 118 to rotate CCW with the sensor portion 114 of the ring 84 such that the arm 118 stays disposed in the notch 116. When the ring 84 reaches the distal end of the helical gear drum 80, the arm 118 will contact and thereby trip the reverse motor sensor 130. Similarly, when the ring 84 reaches the proximate end of the helical gear drum 80, the arm 118 will contact and thereby trip the stop motor sensor 142. Such actions may reverse and stop the motor 65, respectively, as described above.<br>

[0062]	Figure 13 is a side-view of the handle 6 of a power-assist motorized endocutter<br>
according to another embodiment. The embodiment of Figure 13 is similar to that of Figures 7-10 except that in the embodiment of Figure 13, there is no slot in the arm 90. Instead, the ring 84 threaded on the helical gear drum 80 includes a vertical channel 126.   Instead of a slot, the arm 90 includes a post 128 that is disposed in the channel 126. As the helical gear drum 80 rotates, the ring 84 threaded on the helical gear drum 80 advances (or retracts, depending on the rotation). The arm 90 rotates CCW as the ring 84 advances due to the post 128 being disposed in the channel 126, as shown in Figure 13.<br>
[0063]	As mentioned above, in using a two-stroke motorized instrument, the operator<br>
first pulls back and locks the closure trigger 18. Figures 14 and 15 show one embodiment of a way to lock the closure trigger 18 to the pistol grip portion 26 of the handle 6. In the illustrated embodiment, the pistol grip portion 26 includes a hook 150 that is biased to rotate CCW about a pivot point 151 by a torsion spring 152. Also, the closure trigger 18 includes a closure bar 154. As the operator draws in the closure trigger 18, the closure bar 154 engages a sloped portion 156 of the hook 150, thereby rotating the hook 150 upward (or CW in Figures 14-15) until the closure bar 154 completely passes the sloped portion 156 into a recessed notch 158 of the hook 150, which locks the closure trigger 18 in place. The operator may release the closure trigger 18 by pushing down on a slide button release 160 on the back or opposite side of the pistol grip portion 26. Pushing down the slide button release 160 rotates the hook 150 CW such that the closure bar 154 is released from the recessed notch 158.<br>
[0064]	Figure 16 shows another closure trigger locking mechanism according to various<br>
embodiments. In the embodiment of Figure 16, the closure trigger 18 includes a wedge 160 having an arrow-head portion 161. The arrow-head portion 161 is biased downward (or CW) by<br>
-22-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
a leaf spring 162. The wedge 160 and leaf spring 162 may be made from, for example, molded<br>
plastic. When the closure trigger 18 is retracted, the arrow-head portion 161 is inserted through<br>
an opening 164 in the pistol grip portion 26 of the handle 6. A lower chamfered surface 166 of<br>
the arrow-head portion 161 engages a lower sidewall 168 of the opening 164, forcing the arrow<br>
head portion 161 to rotate CCW. Eventually the lower chamfered surface 166 fully passes the<br>
lower sidewall 168, removing the CCW force on the arrow-head portion 161, causing the lower<br>
sidewall 168 to slip into a locked position in a notch 170 behind the arrow-head portion 161.<br>
[0065]	To unlock the closure trigger 18, a user presses down on a button 172 on the<br>
opposite side of the closure trigger 18, causing the arrow-head portion 161 to rotate CCW and allowing the arrow-head portion 161 to slide out of the opening 164.<br>
[0066]	Figures 17-22 show a closure trigger locking mechanism according to another<br>
embodiment. As shown in this embodiment, the closure trigger 18 includes a flexible longitudinal arm 176 that includes a lateral pin 178 extending therefrom. The arm 176 and pin 178 may be made from molded plastic, for example. The pistol grip portion 26 of the handle 6 includes an opening 180 with a laterally extending wedge 182 disposed therein. When the closure trigger 18 is retracted, the pin 178 engages the wedge 182, and the pin 178 is forced downward (i.e., the arm 176 is rotated CW) by the lower surface 184 of the wedge 182, as shown in Figures 17 and 18. When the pin 178 fully passes the lower surface 184, the CW force on the arm 176 is removed, and the pin 178 is rotated CCW such that the pin 178 comes to rest in a notch 186 behind the wedge 182, as shown in Figure 19, thereby locking the closure trigger 18. The pin 178 is further held in place in the locked position by a flexible stop 188 extending from the wedge 184.<br>

[0067]	To unlock the closure trigger 18, the operator may further squeeze the closure<br>
trigger 18, causing the pin 178 to engage a sloped backwall 190 of the opening 180, forcing the pin 178 upward past the flexible stop 188, as shown in Figures 20 and 21. The pin 178 is then free to travel out an upper channel 192 in the opening 180 such that the closure trigger 18 is no longer locked to the pistol grip portion 26, as shown in Figure 22.<br>
[0068]	Figures 23A-B show a universal joint ("u-joint") 195. The second piece 195-2 of<br>
the u-joint 195 rotates in a horizontal plane in which the first piece 195-1 lies. Figure 23A shows<br>
the u-joint 195 in a linear (180°) orientation and Figure 23B shows the u-joint 195 at<br>
approximately a 150° orientation. The u-joint 195 may be used instead of the bevel gears 52a-c<br>
(see Figure 4, for example) at the articulation point 14 of the main drive shaft assembly to<br>
articulate the end effector 12. Figures 24A-B show a torsion cable 197 that may be used in lieu<br>
of both the bevel gears 52a-c and the u-joint 195 to realize articulation of the end effector 12.<br>
[0069]	Figures 25-31 illustrate another embodiment of a motorized, two-stroke surgical<br>
cutting and fastening instrument 10 with power assist according to another embodiment of the present invention. The embodiment of Figures 25-31 is similar to that of Figures 6-10 except that instead of the helical gear drum 80, the embodiment of Figures 25-31 includes an alternative gear drive assembly. The embodiment of Figures 25-31 includes a gear box assembly 200 including a number of gears disposed in a frame 201, wherein the gears are connected between the planetary gear 72 and the pinion gear 124 at the proximate end of the drive shaft 48. As explained further below, the gear box assembly 200 provides feedback to the user via the firing trigger 20 regarding the deployment and loading force of the end effector 12. Also, the user may provide power to the system via the gear box assembly 200 to assist the deployment of the end effector 12. In that sense, like the embodiments described above, the embodiment of Figures 25-<br>
-24-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
31 is another power assist, motorized instrument 10 that provides feedback to the user regarding the loading force experienced by the cutting instrument 32.<br>
[0070]	In the illustrated embodiment, the firing trigger 20 includes two pieces: a main<br>
body portion 202 and a stiffening portion 204. The main body portion 202 may be made of plastic, for example, and the stiffening portion 204 may be made out of a more rigid material, such as metal. In the illustrated embodiment, the stiffening portion 204 is adjacent to the main body portion 202, but according to other embodiments, the stiffening portion 204 could be disposed inside the main body portion 202. A pivot pin 207 may be inserted through openings in the firing trigger pieces 202, 204 and may be the point about which the firing trigger 20 rotates. In addition, a spring 222 may bias the firing trigger 20 to rotate in a CCW direction. The spring 222 may have a distal end connected to a pin 224 that is connected to the pieces 202, 204 of the firing trigger 20. The proximate end of the spring 222 may be connected to one of the handle exterior lower side pieces 59, 60.<br>
[0071]	In the illustrated embodiment, both the main body portion 202 and the stiffening<br>
portion 204 include gear portions 206, 208 (respectively) at their upper end portions. The gear portions 206, 208 engage a gear in the gear box assembly 200, as explained below, to drive the main drive shaft assembly and to provide feedback to the user regarding the deployment of the end effector 12.<br>
[0072]	The gear box assembly 200 may include as shown, in the illustrated embodiment,<br>
six (6) gears. A first gear 210 of the gear box assembly 200 engages the gear portions 206, 208 of the firing trigger 20. In addition, the first gear 210 engages a smaller second gear 212, the smaller second gear 212 being coaxial with a large third gear 214. The third gear 214 engages a smaller fourth gear 216, the smaller fourth gear 216 being coaxial with a fifth gear 218. The fifth<br>
-25-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
gear 218 is a 90° bevel gear that engages a mating 90° bevel gear 220 (best shown in Fig. 31)<br>
that is connected to the pinion gear 124 that drives the main drive shaft 48.<br>
[0073]	In operation, when the user retracts the firing trigger 20, a run motor sensor (not<br>
shown) is activated, which may provide a signal to the motor 65 to rotate at a rate proportional to<br>
the extent or force with which the operator is retracting the firing trigger 20. This causes the<br>
motor 65 to rotate at a speed proportional to the signal from the sensor. The sensor is not shown<br>
for this embodiment, but it could be similar to the run motor sensor 110 described above. The<br>
sensor could be located in the handle 6 such that it is depressed when the firing trigger 20 is<br>
retracted. Also, instead of a proportional-type sensor, an on/off type sensor may be used.<br>
[0074]	Rotation of the motor 65 causes the bevel gears 66, 70 to rotate, which causes the<br>
planetary gear 72 to rotate, which causes, via the drive shaft 76, the ring gear 122 to rotate. The ring gear 122 meshes with the pinion gear 124, which is connected to the main drive shaft 48. Thus, rotation of the pinion gear 124 drives the main drive shaft 48, which causes actuation of the cutting/stapling operation of the end effector 12.<br>
[0075]	Forward rotation of the pinion gear 124 in turn causes the bevel gear 220 to rotate,<br>
which causes, by way of the rest of the gears of the gear box assembly 200, the first gear 210 to rotate. The first gear 210 engages the gear portions 206, 208 of the firing trigger 20, thereby causing the firing trigger 20 to rotate CCW when the motor 65 provides forward drive for the end effector 12 (and to rotate CCW when the motor 65 rotates in reverse to retract the end effector 12). In that way, the user experiences feedback regarding loading force and deployment of the end effector 12 by way of the user's grip on the firing trigger 20. Thus, when the user retracts the firing trigger 20, the operator will experience a resistance related to the load force experienced by the end effector 12. Similarly, when the operator releases the firing trigger 20<br>
-26-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
after the cutting/stapling operation so that it can return to its original position, the user will experience a CW rotation force from the firing trigger 20 that is generally proportional to the reverse speed of the motor 65.<br>
[0076]	It should also be noted that in this embodiment the user can apply force (either in<br>
lieu of or in addition to the force from the motor 65) to actuate the main drive shaft assembly (and hence the cutting/stapling operation of the end effector 12) through retracting the firing trigger 20. That is, retracting the firing trigger 20 causes the gear portions 206, 208 to rotate CCW, which causes the gears of the gear box assembly 200 to rotate, thereby causing the pinion gear 124 to rotate, which causes the main drive shaft 48 to rotate.<br>
[0077]	Although not shown in Figures 25-31, the instrument 10 may further include<br>
reverse motor and stop motor sensors. As described above, the reverse motor and stop motor sensors may detect, respectively, the end of the cutting stroke (full deployment of the knife 32 and sled 33) and the end of retraction operation (full retraction of the knife 32). A circuit similar to that described above in connection with Figure 11 may be used to appropriately power the motor 65.<br>
[0078]	Figures 32-36 illustrate a two-stroke, motorized surgical cutting and fastening<br>
instrument 10 with power assist according to another embodiment. The embodiment of Figures 32-36 is similar to that of Figures 25-31 except that in the embodiment of Figures 32-36, the firing trigger 20 includes a lower portion 228 and an upper portion 230. Both portions 228, 230 are connected to and pivot about a pivot pin 207 that is disposed through each portion 228, 230. The upper portion 230 includes a gear portion 232 that engages the first gear 210 of the gear box assembly 200. The spring 222 is connected to the upper portion 230 such that the upper portion is biased to rotate in the CW direction. The upper portion 230 may also include a lower arm 234<br>
-27-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
that contacts an upper surface of the lower portion 228 of the firing trigger 20 such that when the upper portion 230 is caused to rotate CW the lower portion 228 also rotates CW, and when the lower portion 228 rotates CCW the upper portion 230 also rotates CCW. Similarly, the lower portion 228 includes a rotational stop 238 that engages a lower shoulder of the upper portion 230. In that way, when the upper portion 230 is caused to rotate CCW the lower portion 228 also rotates CCW, and when the lower portion 228 rotates CW the upper portion 230 also rotates CW.<br>
[0079]	The illustrated embodiment also includes the run motor sensor 110 that<br>
communicates a signal to the motor 65 that, in various embodiments, may cause the motor 65 to<br>
rotate at a speed proportional to the force applied by the operator when retracting the firing<br>
trigger 20. The sensor 110 may be, for example, a rheostat or some other variable resistance<br>
sensor, as explained herein. In addition, the instrument 10 may include a reverse motor sensor<br>
130 that is tripped or switched when contacted by a front face 242 of the upper portion 230 of the<br>
firing trigger 20. When activated, the reverse motor sensor 130 sends a signal to the motor 65 to<br>
reverse direction. Also, the instrument 10 may include a stop motor sensor 142 that is tripped or<br>
actuated when contacted by the lower portion 228 of the firing trigger 20. When activated, the<br>
stop motor sensor 142 sends a signal to stop the reverse rotation of the motor 65.<br>
[0080]	In operation, when an operator retracts the closure trigger 18 into the locked<br>
position, the firing trigger 20 is retracted slightly (through mechanisms known in the art, including U.S. Patent No. 6,978,921, entitled "Surgical Stapling Instrument Incorporating An E-Beam Firing Mechanism" and U.S Patent No. 6,905,057, entitled "Surgical Stapling Instrument Incorporating A Firing Mechanism Having A Linked Rack Transmission," both of which are incorporated herein by reference) so that the user can grasp the firing trigger 20 to initiate the<br>
-28-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
cutting/stapling operation, as shown in Figures 32 and 33. At that point, as shown in Figure 33, the gear portion 232 of the upper portion 230 of the firing trigger 20 moves into engagement with the first gear 210 of the gear box assembly 200. When the operator retracts the firing trigger 20, according to various embodiments, the firing trigger 20 may rotate a small amount, such as five degrees, before tripping the run motor sensor 110, as shown in Figure 34. Activation of the sensor 110 causes the motor 65 to forward rotate at a rate proportional to the retraction force applied by the operator. The forward rotation of the motor 65 causes, as described above, the main drive shaft 48 to rotate, which causes the knife 32 in the end effector 12 to be deployed (i.e., begin traversing the channel 22). Rotation of the pinion gear 124, which is connected to the main drive shaft 48, causes the gears 210-220 in the gear box assembly 200 to rotate. Since the first gear 210 is in engagement with the gear portion 232 of the upper portion 230 of the firing trigger 20, the upper portion 230 is caused to rotate CCW, which causes the lower portion 228 to also rotate CCW.<br>
[0081]	When the knife 32 is fully deployed (i.e., at the end of the cutting stroke), the<br>
front face 242 of the upper portion 230 trips the reverse motor sensor 130, which sends a signal to the motor 65 to reverse rotational direction. This causes the main drive shaft assembly to reverse rotational direction to retract the knife 32. Reverse rotation of the main drive shaft assembly causes the gears 210-220 in the gear box assembly to reverse direction, which causes the upper portion 230 of the firing trigger 20 to rotate CW, which causes the lower portion 228 of the firing trigger 20 to rotate CW until the front face 242 of the upper portion 230 trips or actuates the stop motor sensor 142 when the knife 32 is fully retracted, which causes the motor 65 to stop. In that way, the user experiences feedback regarding deployment of the end effector 12 by way of the user's grip on the firing trigger 20. Thus, when the user retracts the firing<br>
-29-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
trigger 20, the operator will experience a resistance related to the deployment of the end effector 12 and, in particular, to the loading force experienced by the knife 32. Similarly, when the operator releases the firing trigger 20 after the cutting/stapling operation so that it can return to its original position, the user will experience a CW rotation force from the firing trigger 20 that is generally proportional to the reverse speed of the motor 65.<br>
[0082]	It should also be noted that in this embodiment the user can apply force (either in<br>
lieu of or in addition to the force from the motor 65) to actuate the main drive shaft assembly (and hence the cutting/stapling operation of the end effector 12) through retracting the firing trigger 20. That is, retracting the firing trigger 20 causes the gear portion 232 of the upper portion 230 to rotate CCW, which causes the gears of the gear box assembly 200 to rotate, thereby causing the pinion gear 124 to rotate, which causes the main drive shaft assembly to rotate.<br>
[0083]	The above-described embodiments employed power-assist user feedback systems,<br>
with or without adaptive control (e.g., using a sensor 110, 130, and 142 outside of the closed loop system of the motor, gear drive train, and end effector) for a two-stroke, motorized surgical cutting and fastening instrument. That is, force applied by the user in retracting the firing trigger 20 may be added to the force applied by the motor 65 by virtue of the firing trigger 20 being geared into (either directly or indirectly) the gear drive train between the motor 65 and the main drive shaft 48. In other embodiments of the present invention, the user may be provided with tactile feedback regarding the position of the knife 32 in the end effector 12, but without having the firing trigger 20 geared into the gear drive train. Figures 37-40 illustrate a motorized surgical cutting and fastening instrument 10 with such a tactile position feedback system.<br>
-30-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
[0084]	In the illustrated embodiment of Figures 37-40, the firing trigger 20 may have a<br>
lower portion 228 and an upper portion 230, similar to the instrument 10 shown in Figures 32-36. Unlike the embodiment of Figure 32-36, however, the upper portion 230 does not have a gear portion that mates with part of the gear drive train. Instead, the instrument 10 includes a second motor 265 with a threaded rod 266 threaded therein. The threaded rod 266 reciprocates longitudinally in and out of the motor 265 as the motor 265 rotates, depending on the direction of rotation. The instrument 10 also includes an encoder 268 that is responsive to the rotations of the main drive shaft 48 for translating the incremental angular motion of the main drive shaft 48 (or other component of the main drive assembly) into a corresponding series of digital signals, for example. In the illustrated embodiment, the pinion gear 124 includes a proximate drive shaft 270 that connects to the encoder 268.<br>
[0085]	The instrument 10 also includes a control circuit (not shown), which may be<br>
implemented using a microcontroller or some other type of integrated circuit, that receives the digital signals from the encoder 268. Based on the signals from the encoder 268, the control circuit may calculate the stage of deployment of the knife 32 in the end effector 12. That is, the control circuit can calculate if the knife 32 is fully deployed, fully retracted, or at an intermittent stage. Based on the calculation of the stage of deployment of the end effector 12, the control circuit may send a signal to the second motor 265 to control its rotation to thereby control the reciprocating movement of the threaded rod 266.<br>
[0086]	In operation, as shown in Figure 37, when the closure trigger 18 is not locked into<br>
the clamped position, the firing trigger 20 rotated away from the pistol grip portion 26 of the handle 6 such that the front face 242 of the upper portion 230 of the firing trigger 20 is not in contact with the proximate end of the threaded rod 266. When the operator retracts the closure<br>
-31 -<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
trigger 18 and locks it in the clamped position, the firing trigger 20 rotates slightly towards the closure trigger 18 so that the operator can grasp the firing trigger 20, as shown in Figure 38. In this position, the front face 242 of the upper portion 230 contacts the proximate end of the threaded rod 266.<br>
[0087]	As the user then retracts the firing trigger 20, after an initial rotational amount<br>
(e.g., 5 degrees of rotation) the run motor sensor 110 may be activated such that, as explained<br>
above, the sensor 110 sends a signal to the motor 65 to cause it to rotate at a forward speed<br>
proportional to the amount of retraction force applied by the operator to the firing trigger 20.<br>
Forward rotation of the motor 65 causes the main drive shaft 48 to rotate via the gear drive train,<br>
which causes the knife 32 and sled 33 to travel down the channel 22 and sever tissue clamped in<br>
the end effector 12. The control circuit receives the output signals from the encoder 268<br>
regarding the incremental rotations of the main drive shaft assembly and sends a signal to the<br>
second motor 265 to cause the second motor 265 to rotate, which causes the threaded rod 266 to<br>
retract into the motor 265. This allows the upper portion 230 of the firing trigger 20 to rotate<br>
CCW, which allows the lower portion 228 of the firing trigger to also rotate CCW. In that way,<br>
because the reciprocating movement of the threaded rod 266 is related to the rotations of the<br>
main drive shaft assembly, the operator of the instrument 10, by way of his/her grip on the firing<br>
trigger 20, experiences tactile feedback as to the position of the end effector 12. The retraction<br>
force applied by the operator, however, does not directly affect the drive of the main drive shaft<br>
assembly because the firing trigger 20 is not geared into the gear drive train in this embodiment.<br>
[0088]	By virtue of tracking the incremental rotations of the main drive shaft assembly<br>
via the output signals from the encoder 268, the control circuit can calculate when the knife 32 is fully deployed (i.e., fully extended). At this point, the control circuit may send a signal to the<br>
-32-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
motor 65 to reverse direction to cause retraction of the knife 32. The reverse direction of the<br>
motor 65 causes the rotation of the main drive shaft assembly to reverse direction, which is also<br>
detected by the encoder 268. Based on the reverse rotation detected by the encoder 268, the<br>
control circuit sends a signal to the second motor 265 to cause it to reverse rotational direction<br>
such that the threaded rod 266 starts to extend longitudinally from the motor 265. This motion<br>
forces the upper portion 230 of the firing trigger 20 to rotate CW, which causes the lower portion<br>
228 to rotate CW. In that way, the operator may experience a CW force from the firing trigger<br>
20, which provides feedback to the operator as to the retraction position of the knife 32 in the<br>
end effector 12. The control circuit can determine when the knife 32 is fully retracted. At this<br>
point, the control circuit may send a signal to the motor 65 to stop rotation.<br>
[0089]	According to other embodiments, rather than having the control circuit determine<br>
the position of the knife 32, reverse motor and stop motor sensors may be used, as described above. In addition, rather than using a proportional sensor 110 to control the rotation of the motor 65, an on/off switch or sensor can be used. In such an embodiment, the operator would not be able to control the rate of rotation of the motor 65. Rather, it would rotate at a preprogrammed rate.<br>
[0090]	Figure 43 illustrates various embodiments of a surgical instrument 300. The<br>
surgical instrument 300 may be similar to the surgical instrument 10 described hereinabove, but also includes a status module 302 releasably connected thereto. Although the status module 302 is shown in Figure 43 as being connected to the exterior lower side piece 60 of the handle 6, it is understood that the status module 302 may be connected to the surgical instrument 300 at any suitable location. According to various embodiments, the handle 6 of the surgical instrument 300 defines a recess structured and arranged to receive the status module 302.<br>

[0093]	According to various embodiments, the status module 302 comprises a housing<br>
308 structured and arranged to releasably connect to the surgical instrument 300. The status<br>
module 308 comprises a plurality of contacts 310 (shown schematically in Figure 44), wherein<br>
each individual contact 310 is structured and arranged to be in electrical communication with a<br>
different sensor 304 of the surgical instrument 300 when the housing 308 is connected to the<br>
surgical instrument 300. For example, when the status module 302 is connected to the surgical<br>
instrument 300, each contact 310 of the status module 302 may be aligned with a respective<br>
corresponding contact 306 of the surgical instrument 300, thereby placing each contact 310 of<br>
the status module 302 in electrical communication with a different sensor 304.<br>
[0094]	The status module 302 further comprises a circuit 312 (shown schematically in<br>
Figure 44) in communication with at least one of the contacts 310, and a plurality of indicators 314 (shown schematically in Figure 44). At least one of the indicators 314 is in electrical communication with the circuit 312.

portion of the status module 302 other than the circuit 312, or a portion of the surgical instrument 300 other than the status module 302. For such embodiments, the switch 316 may be in electrical communication with the circuit 312.<br>

of firings remaining, the post-clamping wait time, etc. According to various embodiments, the counter 318 may comprise a portion of the status module 302 other than the circuit 312. According to other embodiments, the counter 318 may comprise a portion of the surgical instrument 300 other than the status module 302. For such embodiments, the counter 318 may be in electrical communication with the circuit 312.<br>
[0097]	The transmitter 320 may be utilized to wirelessly transmit information sensed by<br>
the plurality of sensors 304 to a wireless receiver (not shown) associated with a monitor (not shown) that may be viewed by a user of the surgical instrument 300 while the user is performing a procedure. The information may be wirelessly transmitted continuously or periodically. The displayed information may include, for example, firing progress information, compression load information, knife load information, number of firings, procedure time, compression wait time, battery level, etc. According to other various embodiments, the transmitter 320 may comprise a portion of the status module 302 other than the circuit 312, or a portion of the surgical instrument 300 other than the status module 302. For such embodiments, the transmitter 320 may be in electrical communication with the circuit 312.<br>
[0098]	Figures 45-47 illustrate various embodiments of the status module 302. As<br>
shown, the status module 302 may comprise different types of indicators 314. According to various embodiments, the indicators 314 may comprise one or more visual indicators such as, for example, a light emitting diode, a multi-color light emitting diode, a display, etc. or any<br>
-36-<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 050705 END5780USNP<br>
combination thereof. The display may comprise, for example, an alpha numeric display, a dot<br>
matrix display, a liquid crystal display, etc. According to various embodiments, at least one of<br>
the indicators 314 may comprise an audible indicator such as, for example, an audio output<br>
device. The audible output device may be embodied as, for example, a speaker, and may be in<br>
electrical communication with the switch 316. According to various embodiments, the indicators<br>
314 may comprise at least one visual indicator and at least one audible indicator.<br>
[0099]	In operation, the indicators 314 may provide visual and audible feedback to a user<br>
of the surgical instrument 300. For example, as shown in Figure 45, an indicator 314 (e.g., a light emitting diode) may be utilized to indicate whether the closure trigger 18 is in the locked position, whether a predetermined post-clamping wait period has been completed, whether a staple cartridge 34 is loaded, etc. Different indicators 314 may emit different colors of light. As used in Figures 45 and 46, different hatching indicates different colors. An indicator 314 (e.g., a multi-color light emitting diode) may be utilized for multiple status indications of a particular function of the surgical instrument 300. For example, to indicate the status of the staple cartridge 34, a mutli-color light emitting diode may emit green light if a loaded staple cartridge 34 is in the channel 22, yellow light if a spent staple cartridge 34 is in the channel 22, or red light if a staple cartridge 34 is not in the channel 22. Similarly, to indicate the status of a cutting force being exerted by the surgical instrument 300, a mutli-color light emitting diode may emit green light if the cutting force being exerted is in a normal range, yellow light if the cutting force being exerted is in an elevated range, or red light if the cutting force being exerted is in a high load range. It is understood that the indicators 314 may be utilized for multiple status indications of other functions of the surgical instrument 300 such as, for example, battery level.<br>

[0100]	As shown in Figure 45, a line of indicators 314 (e.g., light emitting diodes) may<br>
be utilized to indicate the progression of the knife 32, the percentage of the maximum closure<br>
force being exerted, the percentage of the maximum firing force being exerted, the current<br>
articulation angle of the end effector 12, etc. Such indications may provide a user of the surgical<br>
instrument 300 with feedback concerning the forces involved in operating the surgical instrument<br>
300 and feedback as to how close the surgical instrument 300 is operating to its maximum<br>
capacity. Although only one line of indicators 314 is shown in Figure 45, it is understood that<br>
the status module 302 may comprise any number of lines of indicators 314.<br>
[0101]	As shown in Figure 46, the status module 302 may comprise indicators 314 (e.g.,<br>
light emitting diodes) arranged in two circular orientations. For such embodiments, the status<br>
module 302 may be capable of providing more concurrent information to a user of the surgical<br>
instrument 300 than the status module 302 shown in Figure 45. Although two circular<br>
arrangements of indicators are shown in Figure 46, it is understood that the status module 302<br>
may comprise any number of indicators 314 arranged in any number of orientations. For<br>
example, the status module 302 may comprises indicators 314 arranged in a pyramid pattern.<br>
[0102]	As shown in Figure 47, the indicators 314 of the status module 302 may comprise<br>
a line of light emitting diodes and at least one display (e.g., a liquid crystal display). For such embodiments, the status module 302 may be capable of providing more concurrent information to a user of the surgical instrument 300 than the status module 302 shown in Figure 45 or Figure 46. For example, the light emitting diodes may show reaction force at the anvil 24 and staple cartridge 22, the battery level, the articulation angle, etc. in the form of a bar graph. The display may show information concerning closure forces, firing forces, the number of firings remaining, post-clamping wait time, stroke progression, articulation angle, etc. in the form of digits.<br>
