The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
\     *r<br><br><br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD:<br>
The present invention relates to herbal pharmaceutical compositions in semisolid form for oral use. More particularly, the present invention relates to herbal pharmaceutical compositions in j elly forms.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Herbal medicines are widely used today for their advantages like safety and effectiveness. A number of herbal preparations are available in the market of which cough preparations enjoy the largest market share. The extracts of Adulsa (Adhatoda vasica), Jestimadh (Glycerrhiza glabra), Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum), Ginger (Zingiber officinale), Karpura (Cinnamomum camphora), Pudina ka phool (Mentha spicata) being the most popular and highly effective combination. Also Amla (Embelica officinalis), Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia), Neem (Azadirachta indica), Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum), Pudina (Mentha spicata) are available for treatment of various other conditions like general debility, to boost immunity and for treatment of skin infections. These are available either alone or in various combinations and are available in the form of syrups, elixirs, solution and solid dosage forms like lozenges and pills but not in the jelly form.<br>
US6589543 describes a herbal ointment for soothing aches and pains includes a mixture of clove oil, ginger oil, wintergreen oil, peppermint oil, ginger root powder, cayenne powder and petroleum jelly.<br>
Further GB1077722 discloses the herbal remedy comprising equal quantity of carum copticum, cinnamon camphora and mentha piperita with menthe sylvestria, honey, citric acid, sugar, ginger, alcohol, chicken fat and petroleum jelly for treating wounds and toothache.<br>
CN 1090724 describes addition of Chinese herbal medicines for prevention and cure diseases to conventional raw materials to make jelly, so as to change drug application.<br>
2<br><br>
The extracts of Adulsa (Adhatoda vasica), Jestimadh (Glycerrhiza glabra), Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum), Ginger (Zingiber officinale), Karpura ( Cinnamomum camphora), Pudina ka phool (Mentha spicata) either alone or in combination are available for the treatment of cough and similarly the extracts of Amla (Embelica officinalis), Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia), Neem (Azadirachta indica), Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum), Pudina (Mentha spicata) either alone or in combination are available for treatment of various conditions like general debility, to boost immunity and for treatment of skin infections. However these are available in the form of syrups, elixirs, solution and solid dosage forms like lozenges and pills but not in the jelly form.<br>
The above mentioned dosage forms in the prior art have several drawbacks.<br>
The liquid dosage forms have the serious drawback of spillage leading to inaccurate dosing besides not being portable. Such dosage forms are also a serious impediment to administering medicine in case of elderly people, children and the infirm. Further solid formulation such as pills, tablets and capsules are difficult for elderly people, children and the infirm to swallow. Lozenge can cause choking in case of small children. Pills though easy to swallow are difficult to manufacture and demand high skill.<br>
In case of herbal products in the liquid form, it has been observed that in some cases coarse particles of the extract settled down and spoil the appearance of the product as also affect efficacy.<br>
In our invention however we use clear aqueous extract of the herb and hence no residue settles down thus maintaining elegance of the product. The extracts are processed such that no coarse particles are found in the product.<br>
Hence there is a need to formulate a dosage form that is spill resistant, easy to administer at the same time being palatable and stable. Considering the drawbacks mentioned in the prior art our main objective is to develop a unique herbal dosage form<br>
3<br><br>
in a semisolid jelly form for oral use and also provided is a squeezable package for administration of the same.<br>
OBJECTIVES:<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to develop a unique herbal pharmaceutical composition in a semisolid dosage form, more particularly jelly form for oral use.<br>
Further objective of the present invention is to develop a herbal pharmaceutical dosage form useful for systemic treatment by the oral route in a form which is convenient to administer to children and convenient for self administration for adults.<br>
Other objective is to develop herbal pharmaceutical dosage form which is transparent / translucent non-greasy semisolids containing the solubilised active substance in a sweetened, flavored base.<br>
Further objective is to develop a novel pleasant tasting herbal pharmaceutical composition.<br>

The amount of viscosity enhancer and jellying agent used was optimized to achieve desired viscosity. The jelly should be viscous enough to resist spillage on tilting spoon yet comfortable enough to flow from container onto spoon. The viscosity of the present compositions was generally adjusted between 7500 to 25,000 cps, preferably 7500-9000 cps. The computations of the above viscosity were found most comfortable for administration. Viscosity was determined using Brookfield viscometer at 20 rpm spindle speed.<br>
11<br><br>
The present herbal pharmaceutical compositions comprise food acids to make composition more pallatable. The food acids were selected from mallic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, adipic acid, etc. These agents impart a certain tart taste to the formulation thus further enhancing palatability. The food acids were used in a concentration from 0.05 % to 1.0 % by weight of the total composition, preferably 0.1 % to 0.2 % by weight of the total composition.<br>
The present herbal pharmaceutical compositions comprise preservatives. The preservatives were added to prevent microbial contamination in this aqueous system. The preservatives were selected from Sodium Benzoate, Methyl Paraben, Propyl Paraben and were added at a concentrations 0.02 % to 0.5 % by weight of the total composition.<br>
Disodium EDTA was used as a chelating agent for improving stability and was used at concentration of 0.02 to 1 % by weight of the total composition.<br>
In order to further enhance palatability and aesthetic value of the formulation, colour and flavor were included. The colourants were selected from water soluble food colourants of F D &amp; C grades and were used at concentrations of 0.005 to 0.2 % by weight of the total composition. The flavourants were selected from fruit flavour for oral liquid formulation. Flavourants were used singly or in combination. Flavourants were added at concentration of 0.01 % to 1.0 % by weight of the total composition.<br>
For the purpose of herbal cough jelly, peppermint oil was added in combination with fruity flavour, preferably mango flavour at a concentration of 0.01 % to 0.6 % w/w<br>
The pH of the final herbal pharmaceutical compositions was kept at 6 to 7 which is found to be comfortable for oral ingestion. pH of the final compositions was adjusted using food acid and / or sodium hydroxide solution. The pH range of the present herbal<br>
12<br><br>
pharmaceutical compositions was from 6.5 to 7.0, preferably 6.5. At this pH, the present compositions were found to be at its optimum palatability and stability.<br>

The herbal jelly was for improving appetite.<br>
The advantages of the present invention are manifold and range from simplicity of processing and greater stability of formulation to better patient compliance and more cost effectiveness. The present invention provides a highly palatable spill resistant and stable jelly formulation for herbal based active ingredient. The formulation and process eliminate the use of expensive equipment. The extraction process was optimized as to ensure maximum activity of herbal ingredients and hence maximum therapeutic efficacy of the final product. The final product thus was more user friendly and more efficacious, thus improving patient compliance especially pediatric compliance.<br>
The present invention describes a drug delivery system which includes a combination of a squeezable container and a semi solid pharmaceutical formulation. Each of these elements of the drug delivery system has certain characteristics which are as follows:<br>
1)	Allows easy administration of measured amount of drug.<br>
2)	Provides for resistance to spillage<br>
3)	Provides suitable storage for stable pharmaceutical composition with compatible components.<br>
4)	Provides for a highly palatable formulation which improves patient compliance especially pediatric compliance<br>
The present herbal jelly has a number of advantages over conventional oral dosage forms which are as follows:<br>
1.   They were semisolid and hence can be adjusted to suitable viscosity to be spill -resistant<br>
21<br><br>
2.	Due to high viscosity they are easy for handling, storing, and easy to carry (portable)<br>
3.	Ease of administration and measurement ensures correct dosage in case of children, the elderly and the infirm<br>
4.	Storage stable upto 2-3 years at room temperature, i.e. retains its viscosity<br>
5.	Ease of extrudability from pack and spreadability onto spoon (but does not spill from the spoon easily). Hence elegant and easy to use in case of children, the elderly and the infirm. This allows for self administration and hence improves patient compliance.<br>
6.	Attractive in appearance, suitable texture, delicious in taste and mouth feel hence gives better pediatric compliance.<br>
7.	Components are compatible: do not affect bioactivity of active ingredients or physical properties of vehicle<br>
8.	Eliminates need for complex mechanical equipment. Requires simple equipments like jacketed S. S. tanks with stirrer<br>
9.	It is easier to measure than a liquid and easier to swallow than a solid<br>
10.	Due to its high viscosity compared to liquid dosage forms, it remains in contact with the throat for longer time, soothing the throat and providing relief for longer time compared to liquid or solid dosage forms.<br>
22<br><br>
11.	In case of herbal products in the liquid form, it has been observed that in some cases coarse particles of the extract settled down and spoil the appearance of the product as also affect efficacy while in our invention we use clear aqueous extract of the herb and hence no residue settles down thus maintaining elegance of the product. The extracts are processed such that no coarse particles are found in the product.<br>
12.	The source of herbal extracts chosen is such that it contains maximum active ingredient since extracts are from specific plant parts, e.g. Tulsi leaf extract, Adulsa leaf extract, Ginger rhizome extract, etc.<br>
13.	Also processing of herbal extracts is optimized to have its maximum efficacy by heating coarse extract at 40° C in purified water. This ensures better therapeutic efficacy of the product.<br>
14.	The other ingredients used in the formulation like propylene glycol, aspartame, glucose further enhance the taste and provide for a extremely pleasant tasting composition. By virtue of its viscosity, the formulation covers the tongue and taste buds for a longer time resulting in improved palatability over conventional liquid / solid dosage forms.<br>
15.	The product is presented in a very elegant package of closed squeezable polypropylene tube with replacement cap. Also a calibrated plastic spoon for measuring and administering the product is provided. These features make the product highly consumer friendly.<br>
