				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a data carrier, a method of producing a printed<br>
data carrier, and an intaglio printing plate.<br>
Security documents and documents of value, for example bank notes, shares,<br>
bonds, certificates, vouchers and the like, which must meet high standards with respect<br>
to forgery-proofness, are frequently printed by intaglio printing. This printing process<br>
provides a characteristic printed image that is easily recognizable to laymen and can-<br>
not be imitated with other common printing processes.<br>
In intaglio printing, surfaces are usually rendered by a line screen, the line dis-<br>
tance and width determining the color tone or gray value of the surface. Printed lines<br>
are usually a few tenths of a millimeter wide and separated by unprinted areas. During<br>
the printing operation, only the depressions formed in the printing plate surface by<br>
means of etching or engraving carry ink, while the actual printing plate surface is ink-<br>
free. This is obtained by wiping the printing plate surface free of excess ink after ink-<br>
ing with a wiping cylinder or doctor blade.<br>
During the actual printing operation the data carrier to be printed is pressed<br>
against the printing plate with high pressure by a pressure cylinder with an elastic sur-<br>
face. The at least partly compressible data carrier, usually made of paper, is thereby<br>
pressed into the ink-filled depressions of the printing plate and thus comes in contact<br>
with the ink. When the data carrier is detached from the printing plate, the latter pulls<br>
the ink out of the depressions. A printed image produced in this way has spaced-apart<br>
printed lines or areas that are covered with an ink layer of varying thickness in accor-<br>
dance with the depth of the printing plate engraving.<br>
The high bearing pressure additionally causes the substrate material to undergo<br>
an embossing that is also noticeable on the back of the data carrier. If the engravings in<br>
the printing plate are deep enough, a data carrier printed by intaglio printing acquires<br>
through embossing and inking a printed image that forms a relief perceptible with the<br>
sense of touch. In the unprinted surface areas of the data carrier not carrying ink, the<br>
high pressures during the printing operation act like a calendering, which leads to<br>
compression and smoothing of the data carrier surface. These features make prints<br>
produced by intaglio printing distinguishable anytime from prints produced by other<br>
techniques.<br>
The problem of the present invention is to produce more complex printed images<br>
by intaglio printing with elevated protection from forgery.<br>
This problem is solved by the independent claims. Developments are the object<br>
of the subclaims.<br>
The inventive data carrier is characterized by a surface printed by intaglio print-<br>
ing and at least one partial surface completely enclosed by said surface, the surface<br>
and partial surface being printed with the same ink but having different ink layer<br>
thickness so that they contrast visually. A sign represented by the partial surface can<br>
be any geometrical element with an e.g. circular, triangular, square or asymmetric con-<br>
tour structure, a pictograph, character or other symbol, preferred characters being in<br>
particular alphanumeric characters.<br>
The printed surface and partial surface enclosed thereby on all sides are printed<br>
with an ink layer of varying thickness. Since usual intaglio inks are transparent and<br>
translucent to a certain degree, suitable layer thicknesses and an expedient choice of<br>
background color will result in color or gray tones of varying brightness and color<br>
saturation. If there is a sufficient difference of the ink layer thicknesses of adjacent<br>
surfaces, readily visible contrasts will result for the human eye without further aids.<br>
Normal lighting conditions and a normal viewing distance are assumed here.<br>
The printed surface and partial surface enclosed thereby are in exact register if<br>
their position relative to each other is predetermined and adhered to exactly and repro-<br>
ducibly without the slightest deviations. If two printed images produced by successive,<br>
mutually independent printing operations are superimposed, this exactly registered<br>
positioning of the two surfaces is not possible.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a data carrier, in particular<br>
bank note, paper of value or the like, having at least one printed surface and at<br>
least one partial surface largely enclosed by said surface, wherein the surface<br>
and the partial surface are printed by intaglio printing, the two surfaces having<br>
different ink layer thicknesses and being distinguishable from each other.<br>
The present invention also provides a printed data carrier, in particular<br>
bank note, paper of value or the like, wherein a substrate is printed by intaglio<br>
printing, ink is applied in varying ink layer thickness in one printing operation<br>
to a surface and at least one partial surface enclosed thereby so that surface and<br>
partial surface are distinguishable visually from each other.<br>
Further, the present invention provides an intaglio printing plate with<br>
depressions provided for receiving ink in the surface thereof, characterized in<br>
that the surface taken up by a depression completely encloses at least one<br>
partial surface, and the partial surface has an engraving depth that differs from<br>
the engraving depth of the surface, and the partial surface is at least partly<br>
enclosed by a tapered separation edge.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides an intaglio printing plate<br>
wherein depressions provided for receiving ink and forming a surface are<br>
engraved into the surface of the plate, characterized in that at least one partial<br>
surface completely enclosed by said surface is produced, and the engraving of<br>
the partial surface is effected with a different engraving depth from that of the<br>
enclosing surface, and the material of the printing plate is removed by the<br>
engraving such that a tapered separation edge at least partly enclosing the<br>
partial surface is left standing in the depression.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the printed surface and partial surface are distin-<br>
guishable not only visually by reason of their contrast but also with the sense of touch,<br>
i.e. tactilely. The surface relief produced by the pressure is composed of an embossing<br>
of the substrate material and the applied ink layer. The total height of the relief is<br>
based on the normal, i.e. unprinted and unembossed, data carrier surface and is at least<br>
25 microns for feelable areas. Relief heights of more than 40 microns are especially<br>
preferred since surface elements with such relief heights are especially well percepti-<br>
ble tactilely.<br>
Inventive data carriers have elevated forgery-proofness since the characteristic<br>
intaglio printed image makes them unreproducible by common printing processes. If<br>
they also have tactilely perceptible surface elements, this provides additional effective<br>
protection against imitation by color photocopying or scanning of the data carriers.<br>
In an especially preferred embodiment, the printed surface of the data carrier ad-<br>
ditionally encloses unprinted partial areas that can in turn have the form of one or dif-<br>
ferent signs of any kind. This permits a third piece of information to be rendered in<br>
negative representation, i.e. by unprinted areas in printed surroundings, in addition to<br>
the two pieces of information rendered in positive representation, i.e. with inking, in<br>
the same surface.<br>
According to a further embodiment, the printed surface can also enclose a plural-<br>
ity of partial surfaces that either all have the same or different ink layer thicknesses. It<br>
is likewise possible to provide unprinted areas in the partial areas.<br>
The form of the partial surfaces can be selected at will according to the invention,<br>
for example in the form of geometrical patterns, logos or alphanumeric characters.<br>
The various partial surfaces, unprinted areas and the contour form of the printed<br>
surface can also be semantically related. For example, it is possible to execute the<br>
printed surface in the form of an alphanumeric character and execute the partial sur-<br>
faces and any unprinted areas present in the printed surface and/or partial surfaces in<br>
the form of the same sign. If a plurality of printed surfaces are provided on the data<br>
carrier that together represent a readable piece of information, such as a multidigit<br>
number or a word, the partial areas and/or unprinted areas within a printed surface can<br>
also be executed in the form of this total information. But any other semantic relations<br>
are also possible.<br>
The arrangement of the partial surfaces within the printed surface is as desired<br>
and subject only to the restriction that the partial surface or surfaces are largely en-<br>
closed by the printed surface. If only one partial surface exists within the printed sur-<br>
face, it can for example represent the same information as the printed surface and ex-<br>
tend within the printed surface parallel to the outside contour. Preferably, a plurality of<br>
partial surfaces are disposed in the printed surface, however. The smaller the partial<br>
surfaces are, the greater the number of said partial surfaces can of course be. They can<br>
be disposed in the printed surface in any pattern. This pattern can likewise be readable<br>
information, or only a regular column and/or row arrangement. If unprinted areas are<br>
additionally provided in the printed surface, they can be disposed alternatingly with<br>
the partial surfaces.<br>
In the inventive data carriers, unprinted areas and surfaces with varying ink layer<br>
thickness adjoin directly and in any order. This makes it possible to render very com-<br>
plex printed images and superimpose a plurality of pieces of information, also in posi-<br>
tive representation, on the same surface. The freedom of design in preparing and ren-<br>
dering printed images produced by intaglio printing is thus enormously increased.<br>
The inventive method for producing corresponding printed data carriers has in<br>
addition considerable economic advantages since the surfaces provided for printing<br>
with different ink layer thicknesses are produced with the same ink in one printing<br>
pass. Suitable substrate materials for printing with the inventive method are all those<br>
that can be used for intaglio printing, such as paper, plastic foils, paper laminated with<br>
plastic foils or lacquered paper, and multilayer composite materials.<br>
The inventive intaglio printing plates are preferably produced by engraving with<br>
a fast rotating, tapered graver. In accordance with the contour form of the surface to be<br>
printed, corresponding depressions are formed in the surface of the printing plate by<br>
the engraving tool with selective variation of the engraving depth and are filled with<br>
ink for the printing operation. During printing, the ink is transferred from the depres-<br>
depressions of the plate to the surface of a substrate. No ink is transferred from the un-<br>
treated, i.e. unengraved, surface areas of the printing plate. Deep engraving of the<br>
printing plate produces a high embossed relief with a thick ink layer on the printed<br>
substrate, while flat engravings produce only a low embossed relief with a thin ink<br>
layer. If translucent inks are used, different ink layer thicknesses result in visually con-<br>
trasting printed surfaces that are distinguishable even when they directly adjoin.<br>
In order to prevent directly adjoining ink layers from flowing into each other<br>
along their borderline after being transferred to a data carrier and before the ink has<br>
dried, a so-called "separation edge" is integrated into the printing plate between sur-<br>
faces with different engraving depth. Said separation edge has a tapered, wedge-<br>
shaped cross-sectional profile. The tip of the wedge is preferably located at the height<br>
of the printing plate surface or slightly thereunder.<br>
The tip of the separation edge profile forms a largely one-dimensional line along<br>
the separation edge, similar to a knife edge. It separates the printing plate areas of<br>
varying engraving depth but produces no visible interruption of the printed ink sur-<br>
faces. With the support of the separation edge integrated into the printing plate, the<br>
intaglio ink, which is of pasty consistency, is left "standing" in dimensionally stable<br>
fashion after being transferred to a substrate even when surfaces printed with varying<br>
layer thickness directly abut. In this way, extremely fine, superimposed structures with<br>
varying ink layer thickness and high edge sharpness can be printed by intaglio print-<br>
ing.<br>
When engraving the printing plate, the engraving tool is guided so that a tapered<br>
separation edge is left standing between the adjoining surfaces having a different<br>
engraving depth. If a printed partial surface is completely enclosed by a likewise<br>
printed surrounding surface on the substrate, the depression or engraving of the<br>
printing plate corresponding to the partial surface must be largely enclosed by a<br>
separation edge. Ideally, the partial surface is completely enclosed by the separation<br>
edge.<br>
If the engravings of the printing plate are not, or at least partly not, inked, that is,<br>
filled with ink, before the printing operation, the noninked area of the printing plate<br>
acts only as an embossing plate which can produce so-called blind embossings on a sub-<br>
strate during the intaglio printing operation. The embossed elements have similar<br>
proportions and tactile properties, with the exception of the visual impression pro-<br>
duced by the ink, as the above-described printed surfaces and partial surfaces.<br>
Further embodiments and advantages of the invention will be explained in the<br>
following with reference to the figures. The variants described in the examples relate<br>
primarily to very small partial surfaces. The inventively printed surface and partial<br>
surfaces can of course also be executed larger, i.e. a few millimeters to centimeters.<br>

mation and surfaces of varying ink layer thickness,<br>
Fig. 9 shows a further intaglio print in a front view with superimposed informa-<br>
tion in a positive representation.<br>
Fig. 1 sketchily shows a bank note as data carrier 1. A bank note usually has dif-<br>
ferent types of prints. The illustrated bank note shows for example printed image 5<br>
indicating a portrait. Printed image 5 is realized by conventional intaglio printing,<br>
which means that different color tones or brightnesses are rendered by line screens<br>
with varying line distance or line width. Further, background pattern 7 of fine lines<br>
produced by offset and serial number 8 applied by letterpress are present.<br>
In the example shown here, the inventive print is provided only in a partial area<br>
of the bank note and consists of surface 2 completely printed with ink and completely<br>
enclosing partial surface 3 likewise printed with a unified ink layer. Surfaces 2 and 3<br>
have been printed by intaglio printing with ink layers of varying thickness, which<br>
makes them visually distinguishable since there is a brightness or color contrast be-<br>
tween surface 2 and partial surface 3. Additionally, printed surface 2 encloses un-<br>
printed partial areas 4, which can convey further information if they are designed ac-<br>
cordingly.<br>
In contrast, according to the prior art, information is only represented as printed<br>
surfaces against an unprinted background, i.e. in positive representation, or as an un-<br>
printed surface against a printed background. Fig. 2 shows in cross section a data car-<br>
rier area printed according to the prior art, wherein substrate 9 has been printed with<br>
ink in spaced-apart surfaces 10. In positive representation, the actual information is<br>
rendered by printed surfaces 10 that stand off in high contrast from unprinted sur-<br>
roundings 11 and 12. In negative representation, the information is rendered by un-<br>
printed surface areas 11 while printed surfaces 10 form the surroundings and enclose<br>
information-conveying unprinted areas 11. Ink-carrying surfaces 10 are usually lines<br>
with a width of clearly less than one millimeter in conventional intaglio printing.<br>
Figs. 3a and 3b illustrate the inventive principle of rendering information in a<br>
continuously printed surface by selective variation of ink layer thickness between two<br>
layer thickness levels. Figs. 3a and 3b show in cross section a data carrier area printed<br>
according to the invention. In partial surfaces 14 completely enclosed by surrounding<br>
print area 13 (which is not recognizable in cross section), the ink layer thickness varies<br>
so clearly that a visually well perceptible color or brightness contrast arises between<br>
surfaces 13 and 14. In Fig. 3a, partial surfaces 14 have a greater ink layer thickness in<br>
comparison to their surroundings, while Fig. 3b shows the reverse case, i.e. surround-<br>
ing surface 13 is printed with a thicker ink layer than partial surfaces 14. If transparent<br>
ink is used for producing surfaces 13 and 14, the surfaces with the smaller ink layer<br>
thickness appear in a lighter color tone. In this case, partial surfaces 14 shown in Fig.<br>
3 a stand out as darker surfaces against a lighter background, while partial surfaces 14<br>
shown in Fig. 3b appear in a lighter color tone than surrounding printed surface 13.<br>
Information can thus be represented by printed, i.e. ink-carrying, partial surfaces<br>
14 against likewise ink-carrying surroundings 13. If the shape and contour of printed<br>
surface 13 likewise conveys information, two superimposed pieces of information can<br>
be rendered in positive representation on the same surface.<br>
Fig. 4 likewise shows in cross section a detail of an inventive data carrier. Here,<br>
the printed surface additionally has unprinted partial areas 15 integrated therein that<br>
are completely enclosed by printed surfaces 13 and 14 (which is again not recogniz-<br>
able in cross section). If unprinted areas 15 are designed accordingly, these areas can<br>
render further, additional information in negative representation.<br>
The following Figs. 5 to 9 show enlarged representations of different, preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention in a front view. For reasons of clarity, only the printed<br>
image produced by intaglio printing according to the invention is shown. The ratios of<br>
size of the surfaces to the partial surfaces are rendered realistically.<br>
In Fig. 5 the number "2000" is rendered, each individual digit being represented<br>
by inventively printed surface 13 having a unified ink layer of a certain layer thick-<br>
ness. Each printed surface 13 representing a digit contains partial surfaces 14 enclosed<br>
thereby on all sides that have been printed with a thicker ink layer and therefore appear<br>
darker. The contour form of partial surfaces 14 is selected in this example so that each<br>
partial surface 14 likewise represents a digit. In Fig. 5, the digit sequence of partial<br>
surfaces 14 renders the same number as rendered by the sequence of individual print<br>
areas 13. Any other signs, patterns or symbols can of course also be used. If surfaces<br>
13 are printed with a printing plate having for example an engraving depth of e.g. 15<br>
microns in the corresponding areas, while the partial areas of the printing plate corre-<br>
sponding to partial surfaces 14 are produced for example with an engraving depth of<br>
e.g. 100 microns, not only a visually well perceptible contrast arises between surfaces<br>
13 and 14 of the data carrier but also a feelable level difference. This is because partial<br>
surfaces 14 printed by deep engravings produce on the data carrier a raised relief that<br>
can be clearly perceived by feeling with the fingertips.<br>
In Fig. 6, the contour form of printed surfaces 13 renders the number "20." Each<br>
of the two surfaces 13 represents a digit and contains partial surfaces 14 that are<br>
printed with greater ink layer thickness and therefore perceived darker. The form of<br>
partial surfaces 14 likewise renders the number "20." Additionally, surfaces 13 printed<br>
with the thin ink layer enclose unprinted partial surfaces 15 that are so designed as to<br>
likewise render the number "20." Thus, three pieces of information with matching con-<br>
tent in the present example are rendered on the same surface. Two pieces of informa-<br>
tion are rendered in positive representation while the third piece of information is ren-<br>
dered in negative representation. Unprinted areas 15 are disposed like a net within<br>
printed surface 13 and frame each partial surface 14.<br>
In preferred embodiments according to the representations in Figs. 5 and 6, the<br>
signs rendered by printed surfaces 13 have a height or size of about one centimeter.<br>
Signs of this size are still easy to read at a great viewing distance. Enclosed partial sur-<br>
faces 14 preferably render signs with a size of about one millimeter. Signs of this size<br>
are still easy to read with the naked eye at a normal viewing distance of about 20 to 50<br>
centimeters. If additional signs are integrated by unprinted partial surfaces, they are<br>
preferably executed as micro writing. The preferred sign size is only a few tenths of a<br>
millimeter. Such microcharacters are only readable without effort with the aid of mag-<br>
nifying means, for example a magnifying glass, and constitute an additional security<br>
feature because such fine structures are not resolved with sufficient precision by cus-<br>
tomary photocopiers and scanners.<br>
Figs. 7a and 7b show two inventive printed images in which printed surfaces 13<br>
render both characters (the digits "2" and "0") and a geometrical element (a square).<br>
Printed partial surfaces 14 of this example constitute a surface relief formed especially<br>
strongly by embossing and applied ink layer and are therefore perceptible also tac-<br>
tilely. The information represented by partial surfaces 14 corresponds to a simple<br>
geometrical element in the form of a circle here.<br>
Suitable elements that are especially well perceptible tactilely are in particular<br>
structures with a geometrically simple contour. The size of the feelable elements is<br>
preferably a few millimeters and they preferably have a distance apart of at least about<br>
0.5 millimeters. Unprinted partial surfaces 15 integrated into the printed surface render<br>
the number "20" in Fig. 7a. A further preferred variant not shown in the figure is to<br>
render solely the same digit "2" by unprinted partial surfaces 15 in the digit "2" repre-<br>
sented by printed surface 13, and accordingly form unprinted partial surfaces 15 like-<br>
wise as the digit "0" in the digit "0" rendered by surface 13.<br>
In Fig. 7b, unprinted areas 15 have the shape of characters that follow each other<br>
in a line and form microwriting. Their information content differs from the informa-<br>
tion content rendered by printed surfaces 13 and partial surfaces 14. A line of micro-<br>
writing rendered in negative representation is followed by a line of circles rendered by<br>
partial surfaces 14 with a thick ink layer. In Fig. 7a, however, the signs rendered by<br>
unprinted areas 15 and printed partial surfaces 14 are so disposed as to follow each<br>
other alternatingly in both the vertical and the horizontal directions.<br>
In Fig. 8, the unprinted areas are so disposed in the printed surface that there is<br>
both first unprinted areas 16 enclosed by a printed surface with small ink layer thick-<br>
ness, in this case by printed surface 13, and second unprinted areas 17 enclosed by an<br>
ink surface with great ink layer thickness, partial surfaces 14 here. In Fig. 8, first un-<br>
printed partial surfaces 16 render the digits "5" and "0." Second unprinted partial sur-<br>
faces 17 as well as printed, dark partial surfaces 14 are executed as squares.<br>
In Fig. 9, printed, dark surfaces 13 render the digits of the number "50," the vis-<br>
ual dark impression being conveyed by a thick ink layer. Partial surfaces 14 enclosed<br>
by printed surface 13 have the form of letters together rendering the repeated word<br>
"EURO" followed by a "$" sign in each case. They are lighter since they are produced<br>
by an ink layer with small thickness. The information formed by partial surfaces 14<br>
within printed surface 13 also extends into the surroundings of printed surface 13. In<br>
the shown example, the signs formed within printed surface 13 by printed partial sur-<br>
faces 14 also extend into the unprinted surroundings of surface 13. This variant can<br>
also be used in the other embodiments.<br>

a plurality of surfaces (13) are provided that preferably have different contour forms.<br>
18. A data carrier as claimed in any of claims 1 to 17, wherein printed<br>
surfaces corresponding to the partial surfaces (14) are repeated outside the surface (13)<br>
so that the information rendered by the partial surfaces (14) also extends into the sur-<br>
roundings of the surface (13).<br>
19. A method for producing a printed data carrier, in particular bank note, paper<br>
of value or the like, wherein a substrate is printed by intaglio printing, ink is applied in<br>
varying ink layer thickness in one printing operation to a surface and at least one par-<br>
tial surface enclosed thereby so that surface and partial surface are distinguishable<br>
visually from each other.<br>
20. An intaglio printing plate with depressions provided for receiving ink in the<br>
surface thereof, characterized in that the surface (13) taken up by a depression com-<br>
pletely encloses at least one partial surface (14), and the partial surface (14) has an<br>
engraving depth that differs from the engraving depth of the surface (13), and the par-<br>
tial surface (14) is at least partly enclosed by a tapered separation edge.<br>
21. A method for producing an intaglio printing plate wherein depressions pro-<br>
vided for receiving ink and forming a surface are engraved into the surface of the<br>
plate, characterized in that at least one partial surface completely enclosed by said sur-<br>
face is produced, and the engraving of the partial surface is effected with a different<br>
engraving depth from that of the enclosing surface, and the material of the printing<br>
plate is removed by the engraving such that a tapered separation edge at least partly<br>
enclosing the partial surface is left standing in the depression.<br>
The invention relates to a printed data carrier having a printed surface and at least<br>
one printed partial surface enclosed thereby on all sides, the surface and the partial<br>
surface being printed by intaglio printing and contrasting visually due to an ink layer<br>
of varying thickness. The invention likewise relates to the method for producing the<br>
data carrier, the printing plate used therefor, and the method for producing the printing<br>
plate.</td>
