				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PREPARING ARIPIPRAZOLE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process<br>
for preparing aripiprazole.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
7-{4-[4-(2,3-Dichlorophenyl)-1-<br>
piperazinyl]butoxy}-3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone<br>
represented by the following formula:<br><br>
is called aripiprazole, which is a compound useful as<br>
an agent for treating schizophreria. For instance, a<br>
pharmaceutical composition containing aripiprazole is<br>
mentioned in EP-A-367141 as an agent for treating<br>
schizophreria, and usefulness of aripiprazole as<br>
antipsychotic agents is mentioned in J. Med. Chem.,<br>
Vol. 41, pp. 658-667 (1998).<br>
Hitherto, aripiprazole has been prepared by a<br>
reaction of a carbostyril compound represented by the<br><br>
following general formula (2):<br><br>
(wherein X represents a halogen atom, a lower<br>
alkanesulfonyloxy group, an arylsulfonyloxy group or an<br>
aralkylsulfonyloxy group), with a piperazine compound<br>
represented by the following formula (3):<br><br>
in the presence of an inorganic or organic basic<br>
compound, in an organic solvent or in the absence of<br>
solvent. For example, in EP-A-367141, it is mentioned<br>
that the above-mentioned reaction can be carried out,<br>
if necessary, by adding an alkali metal iodide such as<br>
potassium iodide, sodium iodide or the like as the<br>
reaction accelerator; and in the working examples<br>
thereof (EP-A2-367141, page 5, lines 42-44) sodium<br>
iodide is used as the reaction accelerator. According<br>
to the process described in EP-A-367141, however, yield<br><br>
of the objective aripiprazole cannot exceed about 80%,<br>
even if the reaction accelerator is used.<br>
According to EP-A-367141, the preparation of<br>
aripiprazole is carried out even in the absence of<br>
solvent. In the absence of solvent, however, the<br>
reaction can progress only slowly, and the reaction<br>
system is difficult to maintain in a uniform state by<br>
stirring, because the starting material compounds and<br>
the objective aripiprazole are both solid materials.<br>
Accordingly, the process described in EP-A-367141 is<br>
not suitable for industrial manufacture.<br>
Further, the process described in EP-A-367141<br>
is complicated in the procedure for obtaining the<br>
objective aripiprazole.<br>
Since aripiprazole is used as an active<br>
ingredient of pharmaceutical drugs, it is desired to<br>
obtain the aripiprazole in a further higher purity.<br>
Further, for suppressing the manufacturing cost, it is<br>
desired to produce the aripiprazole in a further higher<br>
yield.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide<br>
a process for preparing aripiprazole in higher purity<br>
and higher yield.<br>
The present inventors have now discovered a<br>
process for preparing aripiprazole in further higher<br>
purity and yield. It is a common technical knowledge<br><br>
in the field of chemical science that a chemical<br>
reaction can progress in a high efficiency when the<br>
substrate of the reaction is dissolved in the reaction<br>
system. According to the above-mentioned knowledge, it<br>
is virtually impossible for one of ordinary skilled in<br>
the art to think of using water as a reaction medium<br>
for a reaction between a carbostyril compound of<br>
general formula (2), which is entirely insoluble in<br>
water, and a piperazine compound of formula (3) or a<br>
salt thereof. In addition, the ordinary skilled in the<br>
art can easily expect that the group X in the molecule<br>
of carbostyril compound represented by general formula<br>
(2) has a very high possibility of conversion into a<br>
hydroxyl group by hydrolysis with water. Thus, the<br>
ordinary skilled in the art can easily expect that<br>
purity and yield of aripiprazole will be lowered under<br>
such a condition.<br>
Under the conditions mentioned above, the<br>
present inventors have remarkably discovered that<br>
aripiprazole can be prepared in further higher purity<br>
and higher yield by daringly using water, entirely<br>
incapable of dissolving the carbostyril compounds of<br>
general formula (2), as a reaction medium and further<br>
using an inorganic basic compound as said basic<br>
compound.<br>
The present invention relates to a process<br>
for preparing aripiprazole characterized by reacting a<br>
carbostyril compound represented by the above-mentioned<br><br>
general formula (2) with a piperazine compound<br>
represented by the formula (3) and/or a salt thereof in<br>
water, in the presence of an inorganic basic compound<br>
of which amount is in the range of 0.5 to 10 mol per<br>
mol of the carbostyril compound (2) , in order to obtain<br>
aripiprazole represented by the formula (1).<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>

3 groups selected from the group consisting of a<br>
straight or branched chain alkyl group having 1-6<br>
carbon atoms, a straight or branched chain alkoxy group<br>
having 1-6 carbon atoms, a nitro group and a halogen<br>
atom; straight or branched chain C1-6 alkylsulfonyloxy<br>

invention. As examples of the above-mentioned<br>
alkylsulfonyloxy group substituted with naphthyl group,<br>
a-naphthylmethylsulfonyloxy group, β-<br>
naphthymethylsulfonyloxy group and the like are<br>
encompassed in the present invention.<br>
As the X, halogen atoms are preferable, and a<br>
chlorine atom is more preferable.<br>
The piperazine compounds represented by the<br>
formula (3) and salts thereof which are used in the<br>
present invention as another starting material are also<br>
known compounds.<br>
As said salt, for example, inorganic salts<br>
such as hydrochloride, sulfate, phosphate, hydrobromide<br>
and the like; and organic salts such as oxalate,<br>
maleate, fumarate, malate, tartrate, citrate, benzoate<br>
and the like are encompassed in the present invention.<br>
In the reaction between the above-mentioned<br>
carbostyril compound of general formula (2) and the<br>
piperazine compound of formula (3) and/or a salt<br>
thereof, the ratio between amounts thereof is not<br>
particularly limited, and amounts thereof can be<br>
selected appropriately from a wide range. The<br><br>
piperazine compound of formula (3) and/or a salt<br>
thereof can be more particularly used in an amount of<br>
at least 0.5 mol and preferably in an amount of 1 to<br>
1.5 mol, per one mol of the carbostyril compound of<br>
general formula (2).<br>
The reaction of the present invention is<br>
carried out in water, in the presence of an inorganic<br>
basic compound.<br>
As the inorganic basic compound, known ones<br>
can be used widely. For example, alkali metal<br>
hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, potassium<br>
hydroxide, cesium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide and the<br>
like; alkali metal carbonates such as sodium carbonate,<br>
potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate, lithium<br>
carbonate, lithium hydrogen carbonate, sodium hydrogen<br>
carbonate, potassium hydrogen carbonate and the like;<br>
alkali metals such as metallic sodium, metallic<br>
potassium and the like; etc. are encompassed in the<br>
present invention. These inorganic basic compounds are<br>
used either in one kind alone or in the form of a<br>
mixture of two or more kinds.<br>
In cases of using one kind of inorganic basic<br>
compound alone, an alkali metal carbonate such as<br>
sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, cesium<br>
carbonate, lithium carbonate, lithium hydrogen<br>
carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, potassium<br>
hydrogen carbonate or the like is preferable, and the<br>
amount thereof is particularly 0.5 to 10 mol and more<br><br>
particularly 0.5 to 6 mol, per one mol of the<br>
carbostyril compound represented by the general formula<br>
(2) .<br>
In cases of using two or more kinds of<br>
inorganic basic compounds as a mixture, it is<br>
preferable to use an alkali metal hydroxide such as<br>
sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, cesium<br>
hydroxide, lithium hydroxide or the like in the form of<br>
a mixture with an alkali metal carbonate such as sodium<br>
carbonate, potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate,<br>
lithium carbonate, lithium hydrogen carbonate, sodium<br>
hydrogen carbonate, potassium hydrogen carbonate or the<br>
like. When such a mixture is used, the total amount of<br>
the inorganic basic compounds put to use is<br>
particularly 0.5 to 10 mol and more particularly 0.5 to<br>
6 mol, per one mol of the carbostyril compound<br>
represented by the general formula (2).<br>
In the process of the present invention,<br>
water is used usually in an amount of 3 to 50 parts by<br>
weight and preferably in an amount of 5 to 15 parts by<br>
weight, per part by weight of the carbostyril compound<br>
represented by the general formula (2).<br>
The reaction of the present invention is<br>
carried out usually at a temperature ranging from room<br>
temperature to 200°C, and preferably from about 80 to<br>
150°C. The reaction is usually completed in about 1 to<br>
10 hours.<br>
The reaction of this invention can be made to<br><br>
progress more advantageously by carrying out the<br>
reaction with stirring.<br>
The aripiprazole obtained according to the<br>
process of the present invention can be easily isolated<br>
from the reaction mixture and purified according to the<br>
isolating means and purifying means conventionally<br>
employed in this field. As said means for isolation<br>
and purification, for example, solvent extraction<br>
method, dilution method, recrystallization method,<br>
column chromatography, preparative thin layer<br>
chromatography and the like can be referred to.<br>
According to the process of this invention,<br>
aripiprazole can be prepared in a high purity and a<br>
high yield.<br>
Since the reaction of the present invention<br>
uses water as the reaction medium, the process of the<br>
present invention may avoid the use of substances<br>
undesirable from the viewpoint of environmental hygiene<br>
such as organic solvents, gives no load to the<br>
environment, and is safe.<br>
According to the process of the present<br>
invention, aripiprazole can be prepared by a simple<br>
procedure.<br>
According to the process of the present<br>
invention, aripiprazole with high purity can be<br>
prepared without any complicated purifying steps.<br>
Since the process of the present invention<br>
uses no reagents exceeding the need, aripiprazole can<br><br>
be prepared economically.<br>
Accordingly, the process of the present<br>
invention is quite advantageous as an industrial<br>
production process of aripiprazole.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Hereunder, the present invention will be<br>
further described with reference to working examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
In 600 ml of water was dissolved 36.0 g of<br>
potassium carbonate, to which were added 60.0 g of 7-<br>
(4-chlorobutoxy)-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril and 69.6 g of<br>
1-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)piperazine monohydrochloride.<br>
The mixture was heated with stirring at 90 to 95°C for<br>
about 4 hours. Then, the reaction mixture was cooled<br>
to about 40°C, and the deposited crystals were collected<br>
by filtration. The crystals thus obtained were washed<br>
with 240 ml of water and dissolved in 900 ml of ethyl<br>
acetate, and an azeotropic mixture of water/ethyl<br>
acetate (about 300 ml) was distilled out under reflux.<br>
The remaining solution was cooled to 0 to 5°C, and the<br>
deposited crystals were collected by filtration. The<br>
crystals thus obtained were washed with 120 ml of ethyl<br>
acetate and dried under a reduced pressure of 50 Torr,<br>
at 50 to 60°C for 3 hours to obtain 98.4 g of<br>
aripiprazole (yield 92.8%, purity 99%). mp. 14O°C<br>
Purity of the aripiprazole was measured by<br>
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) under the<br><br>
following conditions:<br>
Column: YMC AM303 ODS (manufactured by YMC Co.)<br>
Eluent: 0.02M sodium sulfate/acetonitrile/<br>
methanol/acetic acid = 56/33/11/1<br>
Flow rate: 1 ml/min.<br>
Wave length of detection: 254 ran UV<br><br>
It is an object of this invention to provide<br>
a process for preparing aripiprazole in higher purity<br>
and higher yield.<br>
The present inventors have now discovered a<br>
process for preparing aripiprazole in further higher<br>
purity and yield. It is a common technical knowledge<br><br>
in the field of chemical science that a chemical<br>
reaction can progress in a high efficiency when the<br>
substrate of the reaction is dissolved in the reaction<br>
system. According to the above-mentioned knowledge, it<br>
is virtually impossible for one of ordinary skilled in<br>
the art to think of using water as a reaction medium<br>
for a reaction between a carbostyril compound of<br>
general formula (2), which is entirely insoluble in<br>
water, and a piperazine compound of formula (3) or a<br>
salt thereof. In addition, the ordinary skilled in the<br>
art can easily expect that the group X in the molecule<br>
of carbostyril compound represented by general formula<br>
(2) has a very high possibility of conversion into a<br>
hydroxyl group by hydrolysis with water. Thus, the<br>
ordinary skilled in the art can easily expect that<br>
purity and yield of aripiprazole will be lowered under<br>
such a condition.</td>
