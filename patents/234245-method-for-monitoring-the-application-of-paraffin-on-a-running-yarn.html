				<td>METHOD FOR MONITORING THE APPLICATION OF PARAFFIN<br>
ON A RUNNING YARN<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method for monitoring the application of paraffin to a running<br>
yarn at a winding station of a cheese-producing textile machine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It might be necessary to reduce the coefficient of friction of the yarn in connection with<br>
processing it. A known method for doing this is the application of paraffin. The running and<br>
sliding properties, in particular for machine-knitting and knitting, are considerably improved by<br>
the paraffin particles applied to the yam. The application of paraffin takes place, for example, on<br>
bobbin winding machines during the rewinding of the yarn from cops to cheeses. In the process,<br>
the yam is brought into contact with a paraffin body, which is used up by removal of the paraffin.<br>
When a paraffin body is used up, or its contact with the yarn is interrupted, but not detected,<br>
the unwaxed yarn can cause yam breaks during subsequent processing, or even needle breakage<br>
of a knitting machine, which leads to production errors or lost production. Therefore various<br>
methods and devices have already been proposed, which make monitoring of the paraffin<br>
application to the yam possible.<br>
Most methods are based on monitoring the paraffin body itself and signaling when it is<br>
detected that it is used up. It is disadvantageous here that the contact of the paraffin body with<br>
the yarn can also be disrupted if the paraffin body is not used up, but only being jammed or dirty.<br>
A method and a device are described in German Patent Publication DE 195 47 870 Al, by<br>
means of which the result of waxing can be checked. To this end heat sensors arc arranged in the<br>
course of the yarn before and behind the paraffin application device, which are charged with<br>
sliding friction by the running yarn. Each increase in friction exceeding a defined value is<br>
interpreted as a defect in the paraffin application device, which results in switching of the<br>
respective bobbin.<br>
Additional sensors are required for the known method and the known device, whose<br>
employment as a rule is not anticipated in a bobbin winding machine. It is therefore necessary to<br>
adapt the signal processing to these sensors.<br>
OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the object of the present invention to perform the monitoring of the paraffin application<br>
to a running yam by means which are already employed for monitoring the ongoing winding<br>
operation.<br>
This object is attained with the aid of the characterizing features of claim 1. Advantageous<br>
embodiments of the method are claimed in the dependent claims.<br>
If the friction drum and the bobbin run at the same angular speed, or if the angular speeds<br>
have a definite ratio, for example 1 :1.5, which causes strong patterns, the layers of yarn are<br>
placed on top of each other. Because of this the reversing points are also located on top of each<br>
other. This leads to the unwanted formation of bulges on the surface of the bobbin, so-called<br>
pattern windings. The build-up of pattern windings can be effectively reduced by a changing<br>
slippage between the friction drum and the bobbin. Changing slippage can be generated by the<br>
acceleration in intervals of the friction drum. With an unchanged drive output, the slippage<br>
changes with the increase in the bobbin diameter and therefore increasing mass of the bobbin. In<br>
accordance with the invention it is only assumed that the paraffin application has failed when the<br>
deposit shift on the surface of the cheese noticeably changes during successive acceleration<br>
phases of the cheese.<br>
The drive of the bobbin takes place by friction by means of the friction drum. When the<br>
friction drum is accelerated, based on the slippage, the circumferential speed of the bobbin lags<br>
more or less behind the circumferential speed of the friction drum. Pattern disruption is effected<br>
by means of this slippage. The frictional force, and therefore the drive moments on the bobbin<br>
are functions of bobbin-technological parameters, such as contact pressure compensation, type of<br>
yarn, mass of the bobbin, yarn preparation, etc.<br>
Sensors are applied to the friction drum as well as to the holder of the cheese in the winding<br>
frame, by means of which the angle of rotation, and therefore the angular speed, or<br>
respectively the length of the rotation period, of the two rotating bodies is continuously<br>
determined. Customarily this is used for detecting the diameter of the cheese, which<br>
continuously changes during the bobbin travel. Within the scope of the invention, these<br>
sensors are also employed for monitoring the paraffin application. Here, the invention<br>
is based on the knowledge that if the paraffin application fails, the yarn, which<br>
increasingly covers the surface of the cheese because of the traversing lift, significantly<br>
changes the frictional behavior of the cheese surface after already a short time.<br>
If the paraffin application stops in the course of a bobbin travel, the change in the<br>
frictional behavior of the bobbin travel can be easily detected. But since the frictional<br>
behavior of the bobbin surface formed by a waxed yarn is normally known as a<br>
function of the winding station, the batch and the winding parameters, at the latest after<br>
the batch has been running for a while, it is also possible after a cheese change to detect<br>
that the frictional behavior of the cheese surface is outside of expected values.<br>
To prevent an extended unwaxed length of yarn from collecting on the cheese, it<br>
is provided in accordance with the invention to immediately stop the winding station<br>
after the loss of paraffin application has been detected. But it would also be possible,<br>
however with incurring losses, to finish the winding of the cheese and to subsequently<br>
remove it as an off-standard bobbin.<br>
It is useful to emit a signal by which the operator is called when the winding<br>
station is stopped. The operator can then initiate appropriate steps for restoring the<br>
correct application of paraffin.<br>
If, in regard to the further processing of the yarn wound on the cheese, there<br>
should be the requirement of avoiding even short yarn sections lacking paraffin, after<br>
stopping the winding station it is possible to draw off the unwaxed yarn section from<br>
the reversely rotating cheese by means of the suction nozzle, or even by hand.<br>
The absolute size of the slippage between the friction drum and the bobbin<br>
occurring during the acceleration phases during pattern disruption is a very essential<br>
measurement for determining the frictional behavior of the cheese on the friction drum.<br>
The slippage between the cheese and the friction drum is determined and evaluated as a<br>
value which is proportional to the coefficient of friction after friction drum. It can be<br>
determined by the evaluation of the angular velocities, or respectively lengths of the<br>
rotation periods, of the friction drum and the cheese. However, to determine this<br>
slippage, the bobbin diameter, which continuously<br>
changes in the course of the cheese travel, must be calculated in a known manner and in the way<br>
already explained above. This calculation cannot be performed during the acceleration phases,<br>
since during this time a false diameter would be determined because of the slippage. For this<br>
reason, the diameter of the bobbin is calculated in the acceleration-free run-out phases, and the<br>
course of increase of the bobbin diameter for the acceleration phase is precalculated based on the<br>
previous values. The size of the slippage in the slippage phases can be quantitatively determined<br>
from the difference between the bobbin diameter distorted by the slippage and the actual value of<br>
the bobbin diameter.<br>
If then the slippage decreases in sequential acceleration phases, while the drive output<br>
remains unchanged, and remains on a low level, in accordance with the invention this is a signal<br>
that no paraffin was applied to the yarn. The coefficient of friction, and therefore the frictional<br>
force, have increased. This increase can be noted so clearly that its association with the paraffin<br>
application is easily possible.<br>
If in addition the detected frictional force, which is transmitted by means of the drive<br>
moment from the friction drum to the bobbin, is included in the evaluation, statements regarding<br>
the frictional behavior of the surface of the cheeses can be made even more distinctly. If in the<br>
slippage-free run-out phases of the two rotating bodies their deceleration within the scope of the<br>
pattern interruption is additionally determined, losses due to friction, inertia and convection, as<br>
well as load moments, the latter caused for example by the yam tensile force of the yarn being<br>
wound, can be determined. But these are also present in the acceleration phases. It is possible to<br>
determine parameters in this way which have no connection at all with the frictional behavior of<br>
the surface of the cheese on the friction drum. By means of this, the lack of paraffin application<br>
becomes noticeable even faster and clearer. Most of all it is possible by means of this to<br>
differentiate the position of the function of the frictional force as a function of the slippage<br>
clearly in accordance with the criteria of paraffin application/no paraffin application already at<br>
the start of the bobbin travel.<br>
If a sensor for the tensile force of the yarn is provided at the winding station, its yield values,<br>
which constitute the load moment of the two rotating bodies, can alternatively be included in the<br>
evaluation. By means of this it is at least prevented that fluctuations of the tensile yarn force<br>
distort the result of the slip determination.<br>
The deposit shift, which corresponds to the displacement of a reversing point of the yarn<br>
deposit on a circumferential line on the bobbin in respect to the preceding reversing<br>
point, is determined as a function of the slippage and is used for evaluating the frictional<br>
behavior of the surface of the cheese on the friction drum. Not only is the respectively<br>
absolute slippage size included in the evaluation by determining the deposit shift, but also<br>
the result of the slippage, so that the slippage course, including the length of the slippage,<br>
is determined. The inclusion of this additional dimension also leads to more significant<br>
deviations, in this case in the function of the deposit shift as a function of the slippage, in<br>
contrast to an isolated consideration of the slippage.<br>
An improvement of the ability to make a statement regarding the paraffin<br>
application can also be achieved in that a reference value is determined by averaging the<br>
frictional behavior of the cheeses at several winding stations, from which a certain<br>
measurement of a deviation is defined as the lack of paraffin application.<br>
The invention will be explained in greater detail by means of exemplary<br>
embodiments.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The winding device, in particular the winding device of a winding station of a bobbin<br>
winding machine, represented only schematically in Fig. 1, has a friction drum 10 driven by<br>
means of a drive motor 11. The friction drum 10 is provided with a reverse thread groove 12, so<br>
that it is simultaneously used as a traversing device for a yarn 15, which is running in the<br>
direction of the arrows over a sensor 13 for the tensile force of the yarn through a yam eye 14.<br>
The yarn 15 is wound onto a bobbin tube 16 as a random wound bobbin, so that a so-called<br>
cheese 17 is created. Since the invention is applicable both to the production of cylindrical<br>
cheeses as well as to the production of conical cheeses, a cylindrical cheese 17 is represented in<br>
Fig. 1, and a conical cheese 17 in Fig. 2. If in what follows mention is made of a bobbin radius<br>
or bobbin diameter, in connection with a conical cheese 17 the neutral diameter or the so-called<br>
driving diameter is meant. The bobbin tube 17 is held by means of two bobbin plates 18,19,<br>
which respectively engage the open ends of the tube 16 in a frictionally connected manner by<br>
means of a cone 20,21. The bobbin plates 18,19, which rotate with the tube 16, and therefore<br>
with the bobbin 17, are seated in a bobbin frame, not represented, which is pivotable around an<br>
axis which is parallel with the shaft 22 of the friction drum 10.<br>
A sensor 23 which, for example, is designed as an angle encoder, is associated with the shaft<br>
22 of the friction drum 10. The angular speed, the period length or the rpm of a friction drum are<br>
detected by means of this sensor 23. A sensor 24, which is also designed as an angle encoder, is<br>
associated with the bobbin plate 16. The respective measured values of the bobbin 17 are<br>
detected by means of this sensor. The signals of the sensors 23 and 24 are detected in a control<br>
and evaluation device 25.<br>
To prevent pattern windings in the course of the production of the bobbin 17, a so-called<br>
pattern disruption is performed, during which slippage between the friction drum 10 and the<br>
bobbin 17 is intermittently generated. This is achieved in that the drive motor 11 of the friction<br>
drum 10 is altematingly switched on and off. If, after the drive motor 11 having been shut off,<br>
the rpm of the friction drum 10 fall below a predetermined value, the drive motor 11 is switched<br>
on again, by means of which the friction drum 10 is accelerated up to maximum rpm. Thereafter<br>
the drive motor 11 is switched off again, after which the process is repeated. Because of the<br>
mass inertia of the bobbin, a slippage between the friction drum 10 and the cylindrical bobbin 11<br>
is created during the acceleration of the friction drum 10.<br>
Starting from the bobbin tube 16, which initially is seated empty against the friction drum<br>
10, the radius or diameter of the bobbin increases because of the yarn 15 wound thereon, until the<br>
bobbin 17 has reached its maximum radius or diameter.<br>
The bobbin radius r,p can be calculated, based on the signals of the sensors 23,24, in<br>
accordance with the following equation:<br><br>
The following meanings apply here:<br>
arp angular speed of the bobbin<br>
afw angular speed of the friction drum<br>
rsp radius of the bobbin<br>
rfw radius of the friction drum.<br>
If this calculation is continuously performed at short time intervals, for example at time<br>
intervals of 0.1 s, a curve results such as is represented in Fig. 3 as a diameter (2 x rsp) over the<br>
time.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a diameter increase of approximately 0.75 mm in the range of a bobbin<br>
diameter of approximately 155.15 to approximately 155.9 mm during a time of approximately 17<br>
seconds. The lower sections of this curve correspond to the run-out phases in which the drive<br>
motor 11 of the friction drum 10 is switched off, so that in case of a cylindrical bobbin geometry<br>
the friction drum 10 and the bobbin 17 run tree of slippage. Therefore the mentioned equation<br>
can be applied in these run-out phases 30, so that the course of the curve represented in the run-<br>
out phases 30 corresponds to the actual course of the increase of the bobbin radius rsp, or here of<br>
the diameter. In the acceleration phases 31 located between the run-out phases 30, the bobbin 17<br>
has a lower circumferential speed than the friction drum 10. There, the calculation of the bobbin<br>
radius rsp or of the bobbin diameter leads, by means of the mentioned equation, to a fictitious<br>
bobbin diameter or bobbin radius, which is distorted by the occurring slippage. Because of the<br>
slippage, an increase in the bobbin radius or bobbin diameter is calculated by means of the above<br>
equation, which is larger than the actual course of increase of the bobbin diameter in the<br>
acceleration phase 31. vsp = (l-S)xvtr applies to the bobbin speed, S here represents the<br>
slippage.<br>
The drum speed vtr and the bobbin radius rsp can be provided as known values in the winding<br>
process. Therefore: asp x tsp = (1 - S) x vtr,<br>
In the acceleration phases, the bobbin radius is calculated as a so-called distorted bobbin<br>
radius:<br>
asp, s _ 0 means: on the condition that the slippage = 0.<br>
Therefore, the following relationship results for the slippage between the drum and the<br>
bobbin:<br>
Taking into account the course of the increase of the bobbin radius or the bobbin diameter<br>
calculated from the measured values in one or several of the previous run-out phases 30, the<br>
(actual) course of the increase of the bobbin radius or the bobbin diameter can be precalculated<br>
for the respectively following acceleration phase in the form of a time-varied compensatory<br>
straight line 32. The difference between the (distorted) bobbin radius or diameter calculated<br>
from the signals of the sensors 23,24 in the acceleration phases 31, and the precalculated course<br>
of the increase of the bobbin diameter in accordance with the compensatory straight line 32 in the<br>
acceleration phases 31 is a measurement of the slippage which actually occurred in the<br>
acceleration phases 31. This slippage has been applied in Fig. 4 in percent over the time, scaled<br>
to the diameter of the bobbin 17.<br>
With conical cheeses the driven diameter in which the circumferential speeds of the friction<br>
drum and the cheese coincide, changes fictitiously during acceleration, as can be seen in Fig. 5.<br>
A fictitious diameter increase 40 takes place. Starting from this time 41, an exclusively slippage-<br>
encumbered drive takes place. The bobbin diameter calculated during the acceleration phase<br>
(diameter increase 40) is distorted, and during the phase 42 of the slippage-encumbered drive is<br>
approximately constant. After switching off the friction drum, the titious diameter again<br>
meets the bobbin at the point 43, and a real, driven diameter wanders, proportional to the sinking<br>
rpm of the friction drum, on the bobbin from the large diameter in the direction toward the small<br>
diameter. This is the so-called run-out phase 44. Towards the end of the run-out phase 44 the<br>
driven diameter reaches a so-called neutral diameter zone based on the acceleration-free drive, in<br>
which an achieved diameter of the conical cheese can respectively be calculated.<br>
Reaching the neutral zone depends on several influence factors, for example on the flexing<br>
work, the conicity of the bobbin, and the friction between the drum and the bobbin, which has a<br>
disturbing effect on the diameter determination. The course of the curve shows a chronological<br>
run-in or settling process. The settling process is not usable for determining the diameter of a<br>
cheese, since here the distorted diameter does not coincide with the neutral bobbin diameter.<br>
However, since it is already necessary to have an actual bobbin diameter available in a short time<br>
for the next acceleration phase, this settling process must be equalized. This takes place by<br>
inserting prior knowledge of the course of the run-in into the neutral zone. If it is assumed that<br>
the above mentioned influence factors do not change during a disruption cycle, it must be<br>
assumed that the previous disruption cycles have a similar course as the actual one. By means of<br>
this knowledge it is possible to prepare a model course of the actual run-in behavior. Once this<br>
model course has been found, it is possible to calculate a prediction of the neutral cone diameter<br>
at any point in time of the run-in phase.<br>
The calculation of a compensation polynomial of the nth degree offers itself as a model<br>
process. Once the model parameters (polynomial coefficients) of the last n run-in cycles have<br>
been calculated, it is possible, simultaneously with the actual run-in phase, to determine a<br>
modeled run-in phase. To this end it is necessary to average the n sets of parameters of the run-<br>
in cycles, and a simultaneous course must be produced. If the measured distorted diameter value<br>
is divided by the corresponding model diameter value, an equalized diameter course is obtained.<br>
This course is corrected by the amount of the actually valid cone diameter.<br>
The integration of several run-in cycles into the model run-out is recommended, since it<br>
must be assumed that by means of this occurring differences between different run-out cycles can<br>
be averaged out. This method is represented in Fig. 6. Based on the run-outs (n - 2) and (n -1),<br>
a model run-out is calculated for the run-out (n) and is simultaneously carried along. At the same<br>
time the determined distorted diameter course ,s divided by the model diameter course, which<br>
results in an equalized diameter course in the run-out phase.<br>
The calculation of the time-variant compensatory straight line 32 and the slippage can take<br>
place, for example, in accordance with an evaluation device explained in Fig. 2. The period<br>
lengths measured by the sensors 23,24, and therefore also the angular speed of the bobbin, asp,<br>
and of the friction drum, afw, are introduced into a quotient former 33. Since the radius rfw of the<br>
friction drum 10 is constant, the quotient afw, to afw, is already representative of the bobbin radius<br>
tsp so that a multiplication by the radius rfw of the friction drum 10 can be omitted. However, this<br>
value cannot yet be used for a slippage determination, since it is a function of the diameter.<br>
Therefore this value is entered into a linear filter 34, for example a Kalman filter, into which the<br>
angular speed asp, of the bobbin 17 or 17 in Fig. 1, and the angular speed afw, of the friction drum<br>
are also entered. The diameter values or, in the case of the conical cheese the calculated<br>
equalized course, are only made available to the filter in the run-out phases of the pattern<br>
disruption. This linear filter 34 constitutes the time-variant compensatory straight line 32. The<br>
calculati a of the compensation radii takes place in the slippage-free phases. In the acceleration<br>
phases the compensatory straight line is continued, based on its predetermined increase. This<br>
compensatory straight line 32 is entered, together with the signal of the quotient former 33, into a<br>
subtraction device 35, which then shows the slippage which is independent of the rpm and<br>
independent of the diameter, i.e the sippage, which is independent of the state of the winding<br>
process.<br>
The slippage s determined in this manner constitutes the basis which is independent of the<br>
diameter for the calculation of the deposit shift. The following applies for the speed of the bobbin:<br><br>
The difference distance on the bobbin surface generated by the sippage is calculated as E1<br><br>
wherein t3 - t1, represents the length of time to be examined. In the case of discreted slippage and<br>
speed courses, with -t as the scanning time, the following applies : E2<br><br>
The value -1 is the deposit shift. To formulate from this a statement regarding the yarn deposit on<br>
the bobbin surface can be done by using the length of a double lift on the bobbin surface as an<br>
aid. This length is drum-specific and Is calculated as 1Trommet = 2xggx2xXx rTrommet, wherein gg<br>
is the drum pitch number (number of drum revolutions for one deposit ift on the bobbin surface). If<br>
the shift is related to a double lift, the relative shift in percent results E3:<br><br>
Since no further manipution mechanisms are available for the shift formation, only the<br>
acceleration of the friction drum can generate the sfppage required for pattern disruption and<br>
therefore the shift. Based on the fact that the drive moment is always the same in every disruption<br>
cycle independently of the motor operating point, the size of the shift during a bobbin travel also<br>
provides information regarding the size of the actually present sippage.<br>
If in the course of a bobbin travel after every disruption cycle, i.e the sequence of accelerations of<br>
the bobbin and its non-driven run-out, the values for the slippage and the shift are entered as dots<br>
in a diagram, tightly limited clouds of dots are created, whose position and orientation provide<br>
Information regarding the quality of the respective disruption cycle, and thus of the slippage. A<br>
representation of the state of the disruption cycles results. The cloud of dots also wanders with<br>
the increasing diameter of the bobbin.<br>
Since a waxed yarn has different frictional properties than an unwaxed yarn, the sippage<br>
occurring In the course of winding these yarns Is different, and accordingly also the deposit shift.<br>
This can be clearly seen in the slippage - deposit shift diagram represented in Fig. 7. A cloud of<br>
dots recorded during a bobbin travel of an unwaxed yarn clearly differs in regard to its position,<br>
extent and course from a cloud of dots which was recorded during the bobbin travel of a waxed<br>
yarn. A prerequisite for this comparison is that, besides the preparation, the setting parameters<br>
are the same during the two bobbin travels.<br>
The absolute position of the cloud of dots can be compared over the entire machine or batch,<br>
i.e. between many individual units. Because of this, deviations pointing to reduced or lacking<br>
paraffin application can be detected even quicker and better.<br>
Cylindrical bobbins of yarn of the same yarn count were wound at the same winding speeds.<br>
An average contact pressure compensation was set and a yarn tensile strength of 30 cN<br>
prevailed. The cloud of dots of the unwaxed yam extends in an area of little deposit shift and<br>
slippage, approximately up to 3.5% relative deposit shift at 1.5% of slippage, while the cloud of<br>
dots of the waxed yarn, clearly distinguished from the previous cloud, extends from<br>
approximately 4% of relative deposit shift and 1.5% slippage up to 8% of relative deposit shift<br>
and over 2.5% of slippage. A slippage-shift diagram makes it possible to clearly distinguish the<br>
waxed and unwaxed state of a yam by the position of the slippage-shift points alone.<br>
Slippage and frictional force also have a proportional connection. Therefore, a decrease of<br>
the slippage can be detected over the course of the frictional force. The frictional force can be<br>
calculated from the drive moment acting on the bobbin. During the acceleration phase of the<br>
pattern disruption, the following drive moment acts on the bobbin:<br><br>
This moment causes an rpm increase of the bobbin within a defined time interval. The<br>
following applies here:/ E4 . In the area of the run-out phase of the drum and bobbin, the friction<br>
moment mKeib = 0, and the bobbin rpm are reduced because of the loss and load moments acting<br>
on the system. Since in this phase the system is without any further external influences, these<br>
moments can be calculated by means of the courses of the angular speed. An uncoupling of the<br>
moment determination between the rotating bodies of bobbin and drum is performed by means of<br>
the calculation of the corresponding yields. Therefore the following applies to the loss and load<br>
yield detected in the run-out of the pattern disruption:<br>
E5 <br>
While there is no possibility of measuring the loss yield of the drum-bobbin system with the<br>
available measuring devices, the sum of the drive loss yield and the load yield as a result of the<br>
yam tension force can be explicitly determined.<br>
The determination of the fnctional and convection losses of the drum drive can be performed<br>
with the aid of run-out curves. Since the winding speed, and therefore the angular speed of the<br>
drum during the winding operation, vary only by the set pattern disruption lift (for example<br>
between V 1.5% to V 6%), the determination of this loss yield is only meaningful in the<br>
operational range. For this reason a model statement can be selected which takes into<br>
consideration the run-out increase of the drum speed in the area of the production speed.<br>
Therefore the following applies:<br><br>
JTrommet is the dnim inertia.<br>
The measurement of the increase of -aTrommet /-t can be performed during the normal<br>
production operation without a noticeable production loss. Following each winding process<br>
interruption, the drum drive needs to be uncoupled (lifting of the cheese) from the bobbin and<br>
switched off for only a short time. After the initial increase has been measured, the drum<br>
operation can be actively braked in order not to permit the creation of unnecessary production<br>
losses. Since this loss moment is constant during a bobbin travel, it is only necessary to perform<br>
the run- out measurements after each process-related interruption of the winding process.<br>
The determination of the drive output is performed by means of the measured acceleration<br>
moments of the drum and bobbin. Taking into consideration the equation<br><br>
the result of the calculation of the total drive output during the acceleration-free phases<br>
therefore is: <br>
E8<br>
In order to be able to perform a more accurate localization of the characteristics of the climed<br>
of points, and therefore of the process properties, it is possible to determine and process the<br>
center and scattering of the cloud of points by means of this representation. The effect of the<br>
paraffin application can be clearly seen in Fig. 8. Without having to perform a localization of the<br>
cloud of points, it is possible by means of the rise of the cloud of points in the slippage-frichonal<br>
force diagram alone to detect the quality of the paraffin application. With the unwaxed yan the<br>
rise of the cloud of points is 4.2 N/%, that of the waxed yarn 0.63 N/%. The method in<br>
accordance with the invention for monitoring the paraffin application can be considered to be<br>
very dependable since the preparation of the yarn, i.e. the paraffin application, has a direct effect<br>
on the friction number T of the friction drive.<br>
If a yarn tensile strength sensor 13 is provided at the winding station, it can have a<br>
connection with the evaluation device 25, so that the changes in yarn tensile strength can be<br>
taken into account when determining the slippage. One of the most essential influence facters<br>
which have no relation to the coefficient of friction of the cheese, is eliminated by means of the<br>
We Claim:<br>
1. Method for monitoring the application of paraffin to a traveling<br>
yarn (15) at a winding station of a textile machine producing cross-<br>
wound bobbins (17), at which textile machine the cross-wound<br>
bobbin is driven at its periphery by a friction drum (10), the drive<br>
of the friction drum being switched on and off at intervals to avoid<br>
pattern windings in such a way that acceleration phases (31) with<br>
slippage between the friction drum and bobbin and slippage-free<br>
run-out phases (30) follow one another, characterized in that the<br>
friction behaviour of the surface of the cross-wound bobbin (17) on<br>
the friction drum (10) is monitored during bobbin travel, in that for<br>
this purpose values proportional to the coefficient of friction are<br>
determined and evaluated by continuous detection of the angular<br>
velocities (Wsp, Wfw) of the friction drum and the cross-wound<br>
bobbin, in that these values are compared with the expected course<br>
over the bobbin travel and in that significant deviations from this<br>
course are evaluated as a loss of the application of paraffin.<br>
2. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the said winding station<br>
is stopped when a loss of paraffin application has been detected, a<br>
signal for the operator is additionally generated.<br>
3. The method as claimed in one of claims 1 to 2, wherein the said<br>
slippage between the cheese and the friction drum is determined<br>
and evaluated as a value which is proportional to the coefficient of<br>
friction.<br>
4. The method as claimed in claim 3, wherein the said friction<br>
drum transmits drive moment to the bobbin, said drive<br>
moment determines the frictional force, which is detected as a<br>
function of the slippage and used for evaluating the frictional<br>
behavior of the surface of the cheese.<br>
5. The method as claimed in claim 4, wherein during the<br>
slippage-free run-out phase loss and load moments acting on<br>
the drive system of the friction drum and the cheese are<br>
measured and taken into consideration in the determination of<br>
the frictional force.<br>
6. The method as claimed in claim 4, wherein the said yarn<br>
tensile force is measured, and the slippage value is corrected by<br>
changes in the yarn tensile strength during the bobbin travel.<br>
7. The method as claimed in claim 4, wherein the said frictional<br>
behavior of the surface of the cheese on the friction drum is<br>
evaluated by using the deposit shift, which corresponds to the<br>
displacement of a reversing point of the yarn deposit on a<br>
circumferential line on the bobbin in respect to the preceding<br>
reversing point, is determined as a function of the slippage.<br>
8. The method as claimed in one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the<br>
said frictional behavior of the surface of the cheeses on the<br>
friction drums of a predeterminable number of winding<br>
stations of the bobbin winding machine is averaged and is<br>
used as the basis for comparing the frictional behavior at. each<br>
individual winding station.<br><br>
In order to improve the running and sliding properties of the yarn during its further<br>
processing, in particular for machine- knitting and knitting, it is waxed during rewinding in<br>
bobbin winding machines by passing it along a paraffin body. When the paraffin body is used up<br>
without this being noticed, the unwaxed yarn can cause yarn breaks or even needle breakages,<br>
which leads to production errors or lost production. It is therefore proposed to monitor the<br>
slippage at the winding stations where, to prevent pattern windings, the drive of the friction drum<br>
is switched on and off at intervals in such a way, that acceleration phases with slippage between<br>
the friction drum and the bobbin and slippage- free run-out phase follow each other. If the<br>
slippage decreases in successive acceleration phases and remains at a low level, while the drive<br>
output of the friction drum remains unchanged, this is considered to be an outage of the paraffin<br>
application.<br></td>
