				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an interlocking side stand and gear change device for use in two wheeled vehicles. More particularly, the present invention relates to an interlocking side stand and gear change device for a two - wheeled vehicle such as a motorcycle, moped or a bicycle. Background of the invention<br>
Two wheeled vehicles such as a motorcycle are generally provided with a stand that is pivotably connected to a stand holder at the bottom. When a motorcycle is stopped, the stand is kicked to the extended position (operative position) to support the motorcycle on the ground. It is dangerous if the motorcyclist forgets to raise the stand to the non-operative position upon riding of the motorcycle. Furthermore, it is difficult to move the stand of a motorcycle between the operative position and the non-operative position when in a narrow area.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,113,235 discloses a lever-action lift jack intended to raise and support a motorcycle. The device does not provide a suitable means to park a motorcycle because the device engages the midsection of the undercarriage of the motorcycle, which is frequently covered by a fairing or blocked by components (e.g., exhaust system). Moreover, it is difficult for one person to safely park a motorcycle because it must be balanced and stabilized with one hand while using the other hand to position and engage the device.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 518,224 teaches a lever-action lift jack that is intended to be used to raise and support an "off-road" motorcycle. The device includes a bike-engaging and lifting rectangular platform pivotally secured to a base and to a foot-lever that is used to pivot and raise the rectangular platform. The device of U.S. Pat. No. 518,224 suffers from many of the same shortcomings as the '235 patent.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 301,817 discloses a security stand device that is intended to support a motorcycle in an upright manner and prevent the theft of the motorcycle. The device includes a base member, a backbone member that cradles the motorcycle wheel, a ramp, left and right side supports, support ribs to stabilize the side supports, a means to anchor the device to a supportive surface, and a locking cable. U.S. Pat. No. 301,817 teaches a complex, expensive means to park a motorcycle that<br><br>
would be difficult to use because it is not portable, but rather must be anchored to a supportive surface.<br>
A side support or kickstand of this type is disclosed in the German Gebrauchsmuster 7,328,256 whereby an electrically actuated installation is provided which effects that the starter of the motorcycle can be turned on only when the side support or kick stand is in the driving position. This, however, entails the disadvantage that the engine cannot be started with standing or parked motorcycles.<br>
One known motorcycle stand device is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 35-10415. The disclosed motorcycle stand device has a controller for remotely controlling the stand, which is to be lifted and lowered. Since the stand is manually operated to move in its entire stroke of vertical travel, the operator is required to exert a large amount of manual force especially when the motorcycle is heavy.<br>
Japanese Patent Publication No. 37-12158 shows a motor-driven stand device for automatically raising and lowering a stand. The disclosed stand device is however disadvantageous in that it takes a long period of time for the stand to be lifted and lowered since it is operated by the motor at all times, even though the stand could be moved from the lifted or stored position to the lowered or standing position in contact with the ground with a relatively small force in a short interval of time.<br>
US Patent 5886349 discloses an automatic motorcycle stand including a gear box fastened to a motorcycle to hold a reduction gear set, a reversible DC motor controlled by a manual switch to turn the reduction gear set, a steering gear driven by the reduction gear set to turn a rocker shaft, a rocker arm driven by the rocker shaft to move the stand of the motorcycle between the operative position and the non-operative position, two limit switches alternatively triggered by an actuating screw on the rocker shaft to stop the reversible DC motor, a photoelectric sensor mounted in the speedometer of the motorcycle and triggered to cut off power supply from the reversible DC motor upon zero reading of the speedometer, a 2P manual switch switched to turn the reversible DC motor forwards or backwards alternatively, and a 2P limit switch mounted in the ignition switch of the motorcycle<br><br>
to lock the 2P manual switch from being operated to move the stand to the non-operative position when the ignition switch of the motorcycle is switched off, or to unlock the 2P manual switch for permitting it to be operated when the ignition switch of the motorcycle is switched on. However, again the entire mechanism is automated and power driven and thus the motorcycle cannot be started when the vehicle is in the parked position.<br>
It is the aim of the present invention to provide a mechanically actuated mechanism which prevents a setting into motion of the motorcycle with the side support or side stand in the parking position without affecting the starting of the vehicle itself.<br>
The underlying problems are solved according to the present invention in that an installation is provided which, during the beginning of the drive, forcibly releases the side support or side stand for pivoting the same into the driving position.<br>
Since the installation provided for the pivoting of the side support or side stand cooperates with the gear mechanism, with the shifting mechanism or with the seat bench, it is assured in every case that the side support or side stand pivots or swings in when the motorcycle is about to be set into motion, and a situation dangerous to or impairing the drive is precluded thereby. Nonetheless, the engine can be started with a standing motorcycle, i.e., while supported on its side stand. Objects of the invention<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a side support for a motorcycle in the form of a kickstand or side stand which avoids by simple means the aforementioned shortcomings and drawbacks encountered in the prior art.<br>
Another object of the present invention resides in an installation for a side support of a motorcycle which manually swings the same into the normal driving position when the motorcycle is about to be set into motion.<br>
A further object of the present invention resides in a motorcycle equipped with a side stand as lateral support thereof, which permits starting of the motorcycle engine while the motorcycle is still supported on the side stand, yet effectively precludes any dangerous driving conditions due to a non-retracted side stand.<br><br>
A still further object of the present invention resides in an installation for manually swinging up the lateral support of a motorcycle in the form of a side stand, when the motorcycle is about to be set into motion, which utilizes extremely simple and operationally reliable means.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings which shows, for purposes of illustration only, several embodiments in accordance with the present invention. Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an interlocking side stand and gear change device for two wheeled vehicles consisting of a side stand comprising an elongate resting means pivotably mounted on the frame of the two wheeled vehicle and movable from a horizontal resting position when the vehicle is in operation to a vertical applied position when the vehicle is parked, characterized by said side stand being provided with a locking groove at the end closer to the frame when the side stand is in the vertical position, a gear change lever pivotably mounted in a horizontal position on the engine said gear change lever being movable in one or more positions in the vertical direction depending on the number of gears provided for said vehicle, a stopper pin connected to the gear change lever and cooperating with said locking groove provided on the side stand to ensure a perfect lock when the side stand is in the vertical position.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the stopper pin is welded to the gear change lever and matches with the said locking groove.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the side stand and the gear change lever are interconnected such that when the vehicle is in the parked position, the stopper pin is removably located in the locking groove.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the stopper pin is removable from the locking groove only when the side stand is brought from a first vertical position to a second horizontal resting position, thereby ensuring that the gear is not operated inadvertently and the vehicle is not set in motion accidentally.<br><br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the gear change lever is provided with a heel rest at the rear end thereof and a lifting means at the frontal end thereof, said lifting means enabling selection of gears by the rider, the stopper pin forming an extension of the heel rest.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the stopper pin comprises a longitudinally extending device connected to the body of the gear change lever at a position between the heel rest and the pivot of said gear change lever.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the locking arrangement comprises a groove being provided with a stopper means at the upper end thereof to prevent the stopper pin being inadvertently released from the groove, said stopper means being provided with a means to slide the stopper by lifting of the side stand upwards in a vertical direction to enable release of the stopper pin from the locking groove. Brief description of the accompanying drawings<br>
Figure 1 is an exploded schematic view of the lockable side stand and gear change lever of the invention.<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic representation of the side stand of the invention.<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic representation of the gear change lever of the invention. Detailed description of the invention<br>
The invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying figures.<br>
Referring first to figure 1, an exploded view of the bottom part of a two wheeled vehicle is depicted showing the interlocking side stand and gear change lever device of the invention. As can be seen, the gear change lever (2) is connected to the engine (4) of the two-wheeled vehicle by means of a bush (21). The gear change lever consists of a member provided with a pedal (22) at the front end thereof and a heel pad (23) at the rear end. In the embodiment depicted in figure 1, the stopper pin (24) is weldably connected to the gear change lever (2) below the heel pad (23). However, the stopper pin (24) can also be provided as a fixed connection at the portion of the gear change lever (2) below between the bush (21) and the heel pad (23). The stopper pin (24) extends out in the horizontal direction from the gear<br><br>
change lever (2). The side stand (1) is connected to the frame (3) at another pivot point (53) independent of the first pivot point bush (21) connecting the gear change lever (2) to the engine (4). The side stand (1) is provided with a locking groove (31) at the end thereof that is away from the ground when the side stand (1) is in the applied position (33). The resting (horizontal) position (32) of the side stand when the vehicle is in operation is shown by means of broken lines and the applied (vertical) position (33) when the vehicle is parked is shown in complete lines.<br>
When the vehicle is in the parked position, the stopper pin (24) is engaged with the locking groove (31) provided on the side stand (1). Thus, in this position, if inadvertently, a rider attempts to set in motion after starting the vehicle, the stopper pin (24) prevents the gear from being engaged thereby ensuring that the vehicle remains stationary. This ensures that the safety of the vehicle and the rider is ensured since both the side stand and the vehicle, remain in a locked position. In order to set the vehicle in motion from the parking position, releasing the stopper pin (24) has to be carried out by a deliberate action of releasing the side stand (1) from its applied position (33) to the resting position (32).<br>
Figure 2 is a depiction of the side stand of the invention showing the various component parts of the side stand. The side stand comprises an elongated bar stand (51). The elongated bar stand is provided at one end thereof with a foot and hook (52) to enable the vehicle to rest on the ground or any location where the vehicle is being parked. The side stand is in communication with the vehicle frame (see figure 1) through a pivot point (53). The end of the side stand opposite the hook member (52) is provided with an annular groove in piece pivot (55) which functions as a locking member to engage the stopper pin provided on the gear change lever.<br>
Figure 3 shows a schematic representation of the gear change lever of the invention. The gear change lever is connected to the engine of the two-wheeled vehicle by means of a bush (61). The gear change lever consists of an arm member (1) provided with a pedal (63) at the front end thereof and a heel pad (64) at the rear end. In the embodiment depicted in figure 3, the stopper pin (65) is weldably connected to the gear change lever at the heel pad (64).<br><br>
