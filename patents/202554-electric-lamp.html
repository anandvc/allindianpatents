15 therein and a lamp cap consisting of metal and plastic parts. The lamp cap has a metal holder part for the lamp bulb, an annular metal carrier sleeve connected thereto, and plastic cap part, which is provided with the electric connections of the lamp and in which the<br>
20 carrier sleeve is anchored. For the purpose of fastening thÂ© lamp in the headlight reflector, the lamp cap is equipped with a pressing-on spring constructed as a cambered leaf spring. The leaf spring ends bear against the inner wall of the annular carrier sleeve,<br>
25 while a V-shaped section of the leaf spring reaches through a cut-out in the carrier sleeve- The leaf spring is fastened in the plastic cap part.<br>
II. Summary of the Invention 30  It is the ob j ec t of t he invent ion to provide an<br>
electric lamp having an improved pressing-on spring and an improved fastening for the pressing-on spring. This object is achieved according to the invention by means of the characterizing features ol Patent Claim 1. 35 Particularly advantageous designs of the invention are described in the suhdaircs.. The electric lamp according to tne invention has a larop cap, a transparent lamp bulb and at least one luminous means surrounded by the lamp bulb. Ths lamp cap has a metal holder part for the<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
lamp bulb, an annular metal carrier sleeve connected to the holder part, and a plastic cap part which is provided with the electric connections of the lamp and in which the carrier sleeve is anchored. In order to 5 mount the lamp according to the invention in a headlight reflector, the lamp cap is equipped with a pressing-on spring which is constructed as a leaf spring and ensures that the lamp is held with a clamping fit in the reflector opening, constructed as<br>
10 lamp holder, of the headlight. The pressing-on spring bears against the inner wall of the annular carrier sleeve, and reaches through a cut-out in the carrier sleeve. According to the invention, the carrier sleeve has two inwardly angled lugs which are crossed in each<br>
15 case with one end of the leaf spring, and between which the leaf spring is arranged with a clamping fit. As a result, the pressing-on spring is fastened directly on the carrier sleeve in a reliable and simple way, that is to say without additional fastening means.  The<br>
20 angled lugs are formed from the material of the carrier sleeve. The pressing-on spring constructed as a leaf spring is arranged with a clamping fit between the two angled iugs, which serve the leaf spring ends as a stop.<br>
25<br>
Each end of the leaf spring is advantageously equipped with at least two teeth between which the respective inwardly angled lug of the carrier sleeve is arranged. The above named teeth permit the respective leaf spring<br>
30 end to be crossed with the corresponding lug of the carrier sleeve. The angled lugs advantageously form an acute angle with the carrier sleeve, each leaf spring end being arranged in the region of the acute angle between the corresponding angled lug and the carrier<br>
35 sleeve wall. As a result, the lugs additionally act as a guidance aid for the leaf spring ends, so that the ends of the leaf spring is [sic] fixed in a clamped fashion between the lugs and the carrier sleeve wall because of the rrtechanical tension in the leaf spring.<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
The pressing-on spring, constructed as a leaf spring, of the lamp according to the invention advantageously has a V-shaped section which reaches through the cut-out in the carrier sleeve, and two U-shaped 5 sections between which the V-shaped section is arranged, the U-shaped sections respectively connecting one v-limb of the V-shaped section to an end of the leaf spring. With the aid of the U-shaped sections, a mechanics! tension is advantageously produced in the<br>
10 leaf spring, and the clamping fit of the leaf spring is produced between the angled lugs of the carrier sleeve. The V-shaped section, which reaches through the cut-out in the carrier sleeve, bears resiliently after mounting of the lamp in the reflector opening, constructed as<br>
15 lamp holder, in the headlight* The connecting region between the two limbs of the V-shaped section is advantageously rounded off, in order to enlarge the contact area between the pressing-on spring and lamp holder, and in order to facilitate the mounting of the<br>
20 lamp in the holder. The leaf spring advantageously bears against the inner wall of the carrier sleeve in the transition regions between the V-shaped section and the U-shaped sections and in the transition regions between the U-shaped sections and the respective leaf<br>
25 spring end. The stability of the fastening of the pressing-on spring is increased thereby.<br>
