Process for the preparation of diorganomagnesium-containing<br>
synthesis agents<br>
The present invention provides a diorganomagnesium-containing synthesis agent, a process for its preparation, and the use of this synthesis agent.<br>
The present invention provides in particular a process for the preparation of mixtures of diorganomagnesium-containing synthesis agents with alkali salts for use in organic and organometallic synthetic chemistry, for example in halogen/metal exchange reactions or transmetallation reactions, or in metallation reactions.<br>
Organomagnesium compounds are used in a variety of applications in chemical synthesis (H. G. Richey, Jr., Grignard Reagents New Developments, John Wiley and Sons, 2000; G. S. Silvermann, P. E. Rakita, Handbook of Grignard Reagents, Marcel Dekker Inc., 1996). In terms of reactivity, Grignard reagents RMgX and diorganomagnesium compounds R1R2Mg are very similar (K. Nutzel, Methoden der organischen Chemie, Metallorganische Verbindungen (Houben-Weyl, Ed.: E. Muller, O. Bayer), Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, 1973, Volume Xlll/2a, Edition 4, p. 197ff.). Mixtures of diorganomagnesium compounds with alkali-metal organyls in some cases exhibit higher reactivity, which is readily made use of in synthetic chemistry (K. Kitigawa, A. Inoue, H. Shinokubo, K. Oshima, Angew. Chem. 2000, 112, 2594; A. Inoue, K. Kitagawa, H. Shinokubo, K. Oshima, J. Org. Chem. 2001, 66, 4333; A. Inoue, K. Kitagawa, H. Shinokubo, K. Oshima, Tetrahedron 2000, 56, 9601).<br>
Accordingly, inter alia, mixtures of Grignard or dialkylmagnesium compounds and lithium chloride LiCI are disclosed as a highly potent reagent for halogen/metal exchange reactions. By reaction of these mixtures with, for example, aryl halides, new organomagnesium compounds are obtainable which cannot be prepared, or can be prepared only with difficulty, by other processes (P. Knochel et al., EP-A-04008081; P. Knochel et al., EP-A-1582524; P. Knochel et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2003, 42, 4302; A. Krasovskiy et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2004, 43, 3333; P. Knochel et al., Chem. Commun. 2004, 2288; P. Knochel et al.. Org. Lett. 2004, 6, 4215; P. Knochel, Chem. Commun. 2005, 543; P. Knochel, Angew.<br><br>
Chem. Int. Ed. 2005, 44, 1654; P. Knochel et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2005, 44, 3133).<br>
The advantage of using such dialkylmagnesium/LiCI mixtures in halogen/metal exchange reactions instead of mixtures of alkylmagnesium halides and lithium chloride is that the rate of conversion is markedly higher, unactivated organic compounds can be converted and, in addition, only half the amount of dialkylmagnesium compound need be used, because both alkyl substituents are involved in the exchange reaction. The economy of a halogen/metal exchange reaction can therefore be increased considerably by using dialkylmagnesium/LiCI mixtures. However, the use of this method requires a diorganomagnesium compound to be available and to be mixed with a lithium salt.<br>
However, the preparation of diorganomagnesium-containing synthesis agents, on the one hand, and the mixing thereof with alkali salts, on the other hand, is complex according to the prior art.<br>
The known methods for the preparation of diorganomagnesium-containing synthesis agents are described hereinbelow.<br>
The transmetallation of diorganomercury compounds with magnesium yields diorganomagnesium compounds, as shown in Figure 1. However, a diorganomercury compound must be prepared and made available for this process, i Such mercury compounds are additionally extremely toxic (H. C. Holtkamp et al., J. Organomet. Chem. 1969, 19, 279).<br>
Figure 1:       Transmetallation reaction for the preparation of R2Mg compounds:<br><br>
The reaction of organolithium compounds with organomagnesium halides yields diorganomagnesium compounds, with the formation of lithium halides, as shown in i Figure 2 (C. W. Kamienski et al., J. Organomet. Chem. 1967, 8, 542). By using an excess of organolithium compounds or Grignard compounds, mixtures of diorganoÂ¬magnesium compounds and lithium organyls or Grignard compounds are formed.<br><br><br>
This method requires that a corresponding organolithium compound be available. However, many organolithium compounds are either not obtainable or have only limited stability in aprotic organic solvents or in ether-containing aprotic organic solvent mixtures. By the use of the above-described process, diorganomagnesium-containing synthesis agents are in most cases obtained in ether-containing solvent mixtures, which can impair the selectivity of a reaction in further reactions or can also impair the reactivity of the diorganomagnesium-containing synthesis agent. In some cases, depending on the coordination strength, the ether can be removed completely by distillation by addition of higher boiling hydrocarbons. This is possible, for example, in the preparation of dibutyl-(2)-magnesium. However, hydrocarbon has to be added continuously during the distillation. The preparation of diorganomagnesium compounds in only one solvent accordingly consumes a large amount of solvent and is therefore uneconomical.<br>
 Mixtures of, for example, di-(2)-butylmagnesium with lithium chloride for use in halogen/metal exchange reactions cannot be prepared directly by reaction of 2-butylmagnesium chloride with 2-butyllithium when commercially available dilute solutions of 2-butyllithium (12% in cyclohexane) and of 2-butylmagnesium chloride (25% in tetrahydrofuran (THF)) are used, because the lithium chloride that forms<br>
 precipitates in the cyclohexane-rich solvent mixture and is accordingly no longer available for accelerating exchange reactions. If THF, for example, is added to this suspension, the lithium chloride that forms goes into solution, but the di-(2)-butylmagnesium/LiCI mixtures that are obtained are so dilute that their use in exchange reactions is uneconomical. Although a more concentrated solution of 2-<br>
) butyllithium in, for example, cyclohexane can be used in order to obtain the desired di-(2)-butylmagnesium/LiCI mixtures directly, such concentrates are pyrophoric, have only limited stability and are difficult to handle.  In addition, ether cleavage is<br><br>
observed in the presence of ethers even at lower temperatures, which leads to undesirable secondary products and losses in yield.<br>
As is shown in Figure 3, organomagnesium halides are present in solution according to W. Schlenk in the following equilibrium (W. Schlenk et al, Berichte 1929, 62, 920; W. Schlenk, Berichte 1931, 64, 734):<br><br>
By the addition of specific solvents, such as, for example, pyridine. Crown ether, dioxan, tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) or dimethyl ether (DME), the equilibrium is displaced in the direction towards the diorganomagnesium compound. After separation of the resulting poorly soluble magnesium halide, it is accordingly possible to obtain diorganomagnesium compounds or mixtures thereof with Grignard compounds, as is shown in Figure 4.<br><br>
However, it is known that the displacement of the equilibrium is greatly dependent on the choice of solvent, the temperature, the time of action of the solvent on the Grignard compound, and the concentration of the solution. Almost complete precipitation of the magnesium halide is possible only with difficulty. It is therefore technically demanding to obtain definite products in a reproducible manner. In addition, this process requires the use of exotic solvents which are used only rarely commercially and some of which are toxic or carcinogenic.<br><br>
Diorganomagnesium compounds can also be prepared by reaction of magnesium hydride MgHa with alkenes containing activated double bonds, as is shown in Figure 5:<br><br>
The yields of diorganomagnesium compounds prepared by this method are low. In addition, this process requires high pressures and temperatures. As a result, secondary reactions take place and the crude product must be purified in a technically complex manner.<br>
A further method is described in EP-B-0285374. Mixtures of lithium organyls and diorganomagnesium compounds are obtained by reaction of an alkyl halide with a mixture of, for example, lithium and magnesium in hydrocarbons containing from 0.05 to 2 molar equivalents of a Lewis base per mol of organometallic composition, as is shown in Figure 6:<br><br>
This process has the disadvantage that it is carried out in mixtures of hydrocarbons and Lewis bases, for example THF. The product is therefore present in a solvent mixture. This often has a disadvantageous effect in synthetic chemistry because, for example, changed selectivities or reactivities are obtained. In addition, it is I known that if the amount of Lewis base exceeds or falls short of a specified amount, poorer yields are obtained, for example owing to secondary reactions such<br><br>
as ether cleavage. Because of the higher reactivity of lithium in comparison with magnesium, an organolithium compound mainly accumulates in the reaction mixture at the beginning of the reaction. It is known, however, that many organolithium compounds, such as, for example, sec-butyllithium, have only limited stability in solvents containing Lewis bases and react with the Lewis base. Undesirable secondary products thereby form, and the yield falls accordingly. The process therefore has only limited usability. In addition, because of the poor solubility of lithium salts in solvents containing only small amounts of Lewis base, only synthesis agents that are low in or free of lithium salts are obtained according to this process, and such synthesis agents are not suitable for use in halogen/metal exchange reactions, for example.<br>
A further process is disclosed in US-A-5171467. Here too, the reaction takes place in solvent mixtures of hydrocarbons and ethers. The process is explained by way of example by means of Figure 7.<br>
Figure 7:       Preparation   of  diorganomagnesium   compounds   via   magnesium halides:<br><br>
As is shown, an organolithium compound is formed as an intermediate in the synthesis and is subsequently reacted with magnesium chloride. Anhydrous magnesium chloride must therefore be used in the synthesis in order to prevent partial hydrolysis of the organolithium compound, which would lead to a loss in yield. Anhydrous magnesium chloride must be prepared in situ in a technically complex manner or must be dried at high temperatures for a long time. Both operations have a disadvantageous effect on the economy of this method. In addition, a pure diorganomagnesium compound can be obtained only when an excess of dry magnesium halide is used. If magnesium halides are used in less than stoichiometric amounts, a mixture of a diorganomagnesium compound and a lithium organyl is formed.<br>
As has already been described above, it is known that many lithium organyls have only limited stability in ether-containing solvent mixtures because of ether cleavage.<br><br>
Secondary reactions occur, which result in undesirable secondary products and poorer yields. The process therefore has only limited usability. Magnesium chloride is only sparingly soluble in mixtures of hydrocarbons and ethers, which results in a slower reaction of the organolithium compound with magnesium chloride. Long reaction times are necessary, which favours secondary reactions, for example ether cleavage. In addition, only diorganomagnesium-containing synthesis agents that are low in or free of lithium salts are obtained according to this process, which synthesis agents have only limited usability, as has been described.<br>
In addition to these methods there are further methods, but these are suitable only for the synthesis of specific organomagnesium compounds. The direct preparation of organomagnesium compounds from magnesium and organic halides is possible only in rare cases. For example, it is possible in the case of di-(2)-butylmagnesium, butylethylmagnesium, butyloctylmagnesium, n-butyl-sec-butylmagnesium. However, these compounds can be prepared only under conditions which are very disadvantageous in terms of energy. For example, some of the alkyl halides used for the synthesis must be added under high pressure to the boiling suspension of solvent and very fine magnesium powder. Because secondary reactions also take place at the very high reaction temperatures, gaseous alkenes from p-H elimination<br>
 reactions are always given off into the surroundings. For example, it is known that relatively large amounts of butene are formed in the synthesis of dibutylmagnesium. It is also known that some of the dialkylmagnesium compounds prepared in this manner have poor solubility in the solvent used. Therefore, octyl chloride   must   always   be   added   where   possible   to   form   octyl-containing<br>
 dialkylmagnesium compounds. Although the solubility of the compound is thereby increased, it is not possible to prepare a definite product in this manner. It is likewise known that solutions of the dialkylmagnesium compounds so prepared always have a very high viscosity, through the formation of coordination polymers, so that auxiliary agents such as aluminium alkyls must in principle be added in<br>
order to lower the viscosity. However, this impairs the purity considerably. In addition, long reaction times are necessary owing to the slow oxidative addition, shown in Figure 8, of the two necessary equivalents of alkyl halide to magnesium (Magnesium Alkyls from Akzo Nobel, 1999: Metal Alkyls from Akzo Nobel, 2003; M. de Vries, Stamicarbon N. V. 1969, US-A-3737393; Zn-Zusatze: G. W. Knight, L.<br>

Figure 8:	Synthesis of R2Mg compounds from magnesium and organic halides<br>
using the example of di-(2)-butylmagnesium:<br><br>
Mixtures of diorganomagnesium compounds and alkali-metal organyls are obtained according to Figure 9 by reaction of diorganomagnesium compounds with alkali metals (D. B. Malpass, J. F. Eastham, J. Org. Chem.  1973,21,3718).<br>

R = organic fragment, M = alkali metal<br>
However, this process requires that a diorganomagnesium compound be available. As has been shown, however, the preparation of such compounds by methods of the prior art is difficult.<br>
5 The speed of halogen/metal exchange reactions can be increased drastically by the use of, for example, mixtures of Grignard compounds or diorganomagnesium compounds with lithium salts. By the addition of lithium salts to the above-described compounds It is possible to prepare reagents which cannot be prepared commercially, or which can be prepared commercially only with difficulty, by other<br>
3 processes owing to secondary reactions or long reaction times. In all the above-described possible methods of preparing diorganomagnesium compounds that do not use lithium organyls or lithium metal as starting material, a lithium salt, for<br><br>
example lithium chloride, must therefore be added in a further process step. Because of the poor solubility of the lithium salt in the solvent or solvent mixture used, a solvent exchange must additionally be carried out in some cases.<br>
If organomagnesium compounds are prepared via lithium organyls or using lithium metal, a lithium salt forms in situ. However, because it is necessary in the described processes to work in hydrocarbons or in ether/hydrocarbon mixtures owing to the implementability of the methods, the lack of stability or lack of solubility of the resulting lithium organyl, a large part of the lithium salt that forms precipitates. Although this can be brought into solution again by the addition of polar solvents, dilute solutions form, which are uneconomical to use in synthetic chemistry. In order nevertheless to obtain lithium-salt-containing mixtures, a solvent exchange is necessary in this case too in a further process step. In addition, the availability and stability of an organolithium compound are required in some cases.<br>
Lithium chloride is very hygroscopic, which makes its subsequent introduction into organomagnesium compounds difficult. If water-containing or slightly moist lithium chloride is used, partial hydrolysis of the organomagnesium compounds takes place. Undesirable secondary products form as a result, and the yield of organomagnesium compounds falls accordingly.<br>
 All the mentioned processes for the preparation of diorganomagnesium-containing synthesis agents or mixtures thereof with alkali-metal salts are either expensive, require the handling of pyrophoric or even toxic compounds, use as starting materials organometalllc compounds which in some cases are not available commercially or organometalllc compounds which have only limited stability,<br>
require a plurality of process steps, lead to the formation of undesirable secondary products or have only limited usability. The object of providing an efficient, simple and inexpensive process, which can be carried out commercially, for the preparation of diorganomagnesium-containing synthesis agents and mixtures thereof with alkali salts has accordingly not hitherto been achieved.<br>
) The object of the present invention is, therefore, to provide a process for the preparation of diorganomagnesium-containing synthesis agents which overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art.<br><br>
It is a particular object of the present invention to provide a process which yields identically or differently substituted diorganomagnesium-containing synthesis agents in only one specified solvent or in specified solvent mixtures, and which yields directly alkali-salt-containing solutions, but also solutions which are low in or free of alkali-metal salts, of diorganomagnesium-containing synthesis agents in specific solvents or solvent mixtures.<br>
Surprisingly, the object is achieved according to the invention by the features of the main claim. Preferred embodiments will be found in the subsidiary claims.<br>
Surprisingly, the process according to the invention permits the preparation of a large number of diorganomagnesium compounds, such as, for example, dialkyi-, dialkenyl-, dialkynyl-, diaryl-, diheteroaryl-, alkylalkenyl-, alkylalkynyl-, alkylaryl-, alkylheteroaryl-, alkenylalkynyl-, alkenylaryl-, alkenylheteroaryl-, alkynylaryl- or alkynylheteroaryl-magnesium compounds, or mixtures thereof with alkali-metal organyls or Grignard compounds, or mixtures with alkali-metal salts, in only one     specific solvent or in specific solvent mixtures.<br>
By means of the process according to the invention, alkali-salt-containing solutions of diorganomagnesium-containing synthesis agents or solutions that are low in or free of alkali-metal salts can also be prepared directly. The diorganomagnesium-containing synthesis agents prepared according to the invention, or mixtures<br>
 thereof with alkali-metal salts, can be used in the preparation of a large number of in some cases highly functionalised substances, such as pharmaceuticals, natural substance derivatives, polymer materials, agrochemicals, speciality chemicals and catalysts, for example in halogen/metal exchange reactions or metallation reactions, for example ortho-metallation reactions, or transmetallation reactions, for<br>
   example in the preparation of diorganozinc compounds or organozinc halides.<br>
It has been found, surprisingly, that the desired diorganomagnesium-containing synthesis agents, or mixtures thereof with alkali-metal salts, are formed directly by reaction of a compound of the general formula RMgX - or of a plurality of compounds of the general formula R'MgX, R2MgX and R3MgX - and a compound the general formula RX - or a plurality of compounds of the general formula R1X, R2X and R3X - with alkali metal or with a mixture of alkali metal and magnesium. This embodiment of the process according to the invention is explained by the general reaction formula in Figure 10, without limiting the invention thereto.<br><br>

The process according to the invention is explained in detail using the example of the following formula (Figure 10):<br>

i a plurality of compounds of the general formula R1X, R2X and R3X - separately or mixed beforehand. The compounds of the general formulae R'MgX, R1MgX and R1MgX are preferably added in solution in an aprotic organic solvent or solvent mixture, more preferably in the solvent or solvent mixture in which the alkali metal or the mixture of alkali metal and magnesium is suspended.<br>
) The molar ratio of the total amount of alkali metal to the total amount of compounds of the general formulae RX, R'X, R1X and R1X is 2n/(n+m), the molar ratio of magnesium to the total amount of compounds of the general formulae RX, R1X,<br><br>

The invention Is explained by means of the following examples, without being limited thereto.<br>
To illustrate the efficiency of the process according to the invention, the preparation of di-sec-butylmagnesium and mixtures thereof with sec-BuLi or sec-BuMgCI and LiCI is chosen. The preparation of this compound according to the prior art, for example by oxidative addition of two equivalents of sec-butyl chloride to magnesium, leads, as has been described, to p-H elimination and various secondary products. In addition, high process temperatures and long reaction times are necessary. Tests for the preparation of {sec-Bu)2Mg by transmetallation with sec-BuLi result in solvent mixtures. If lithium-chloride-containing solutions are to be obtained directly by reaction of sec-BuMgCI with sec-BuLi, it is necessary to work with sec-BuLi concentrate, which has only limited stability and is also pyrophoric. If the synthesis of sec-Bu2Mg/LiCI mixtures with sec-BuMgCI and sec-BuLi concentrate is carried out in THF at 0Â°C, for example, THF cleavage is additionally observed, so that the product solution is contaminated.<br>
All tests are carried out in an argon atmosphere using Schlenk techniques. Commercial raw materials were used. With regard to sec-BuMgCI, various batches in the form of approximately 25% solutions in THF are used. The precise content and the composition of the batches are determined by wet analysis. With regard to lithium, lithium metal having different sodium contents was used. The sodium content is shown in Fig. 1, Table 1.<br>
The test parameters, analytical results and evaluations of the examples relating to the preparation according to the invention of organomagnesium compounds are summarised in Figs. 1 and 2, Tables 1 and 2. In the examples, R = sec-butyl.<br>
Where indicated, samples were taken during the reaction and examined by wet analysis.   This was not taken into account when determining the yield, so that<br><br>
where samples were taken, the yields indicated in the tables are lower according to the number of samples.<br>
The magnesium content was determined by complexometry, the chloride content by argentometry and the total base content by acidimetry after hydrolysis. The active base was determined according to Watson-Eastham using 2,2'-biquinoline as indicator.<br>
Examples 1 to 13: Diorganomagnesium-containing synthesis agents via lithium, sec-butyl chloride and sec-butylmagnesium chloride, in some cases with magnesium, according to Figure 10:<br>
General procedure described by means of Example 1:<br>
24.0 g (259 mmol) of sec-butyl chloride and 81.0 g (166 mmol) of sec-butylmagnesium chloride (in the form of an approximately 25% solution in THF) are added in the course of 125 minutes, at a reaction temperature of 25Â°C, to a suspension of 3.00 g (432 mmol) of lithium metal and 1.73 g (71 mmol) of coarse magnesium powder in 149 g of THF. After a post-reaction time of 60 minutes at 25Â°C, the resulting suspension is filtered and the residue is washed with THF and then dried in vacuo.<br>
Yield original solution: 221.4 g of a brown solution; washing solution: 86.44 g.<br>
Examples 2 to 13 were carried out analogously to Example 1 according to the experimental parameters indicated in Table 1. No magnesium metal was used in Examples 3 to 13. The test parameters and results are summarised in Table 2.<br>
