In literature, various compounds have been proposed as active ingredients having anthelminthic properties in pesticides for use on domestic animals and productive livestock. The biological properties of these known compounds, however, are not fully satisfactory in the field of pest control, which is why there is a need to produce further compounds with pesticidal properties, especially for the control of endoparasites; this problem is solved according to the invention with the development of the present compounds I.<br>
Alkyl - as a group per se and as structural element of other groups and compounds such as halogen-alkyl, alkylamino, alkoxy, alkylthio, alkylsulfinyl and alkylsulfonyl - is, in each case with due consideration of the specific number of carbon atoms in the group or compound in question, either straight-chained, i.e. methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl oroctyl, or branched, e.g. isopropyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, isopentyl, neopentyl or isohexyl.<br>
Cycloalkyl - as a group per se and as structural element of other groups and compounds such as halocycloalkyl, cycloalkoxy and cycloalkylthio, - is, in each case with due consideration of the specific number of carbon atoms in the group or compound in question, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl or cyclooctyl.<br>
Alkenyl - as a group per se and as structural element of other groups and compounds - is, in each case with due consideration of the specific number of carbon atoms in the group or compound in question and of the conjugated or isolated double bonds - either straight-chained, e.g. allyl, 2-butenyl, 3-pentenyl, 1-hexenyl, 1-heptenyl, 1,3-hexadienyl or 1,3-octadienyl, or branched, e.g. isopropenyl, isobutenyl, isoprenyl, tert.-pentenyl, isohexenyl, isoheptenyl or isooctenyl.<br>
Alkinyl - as a group per se and as structural element of other groups and compounds - is, in<br><br>
each case with due consideration of the specific number of carbon atoms in the group or compound in question and of the conjugated or isolated double bonds - either straight-chained, e.g. propargyl, 2-butinyl, 3-pentinyl, 1-hexinyl, 1-heptinyl, 3-hexen-1-inyl or 1,5-heptadien-3-inyl, or branched, e.g. 3-methylbut-1-inyl, 4-ethylpent-1-inyl, 4-methylhex-2-inyl or 2-methylhept-3-inyl.<br>
Heteroaryl is pyridyl, thienyl, furanyl, pyrryl, benzothienyl, benzofuranyl, indolyl or indazolyl, preferably pyridyl or thienyl, especially pyridyl.<br>
As a rule, halogen signifies fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. The same applies to halogen in combination with other significances, such as halogenalkyl or halogenphenyl.<br>
Halogen-substituted carbon-containing groups and compounds may be partially halogenated or perhalogenated, whereby in the case of multiple halogenation, the halogen substituents may be identical or different. Examples of halogen-alkyl - as a group perse and as structural element of other groups and compounds such as halogen-alkoxy or halogen-alkylthio, - are methyl which is mono- to trisubstituted by fluorine, chlorine and/or bromine, such as CHF2 or CF3; ethyl which is mono- to pentasubstituted by fluorine, chlorine and/or bromine, such as CH2CF3, CF2CF3, CF2CCI3, CF2CHCI2, CF2CHF2, CF2CFCI2, CF2CHBr2, CF2CHCIF, CF2CHBrF or CCIFCHCIF; propyl or isopropyl, mono- to heptasubstituted by fluorine, chlorine and/or bromine, such as CH2CHBrCH2Br, CF2CHFCF3, CH2CF2CF3 or CH(CF3)2; butyl or one of its isomers, mono- to nonasubstituted by fluorine, chlorine and/or bromine, such as CF(CF3)CHFCF3 or CH2(CF2)2CF3; pentyl or one of its isomers substituted once to eleven times by fluorine, chlorine and/or bromine, such as CF(CF3)(CHF)2CF3 or CH2(CF2)3CF3; and hexyl or one of its isomers substituted once to thirteen times by fluorine, chlorine and/or bromine, such as (CH2)4CHBrCH2Br, CF2(CHF)4CF3, CH2(CF2)4CF3 or C(CF3)2(CHF)2CF3.<br>
Alkoxy groups preferably have a chain length of 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Alkoxy is for example methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, isobutoxy, sec.-butoxy and tert.-butoxy, as well as the isomers pentyloxy and hexyloxy; preferably methoxy and ethoxy. Halogenalkoxy groups preferably have a chain length of 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Halogenalkoxy is e.g. fluoromethoxy, difluoromethoxy, trifluoromethoxy, 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy, 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethoxy, 2-fluoroethoxy, 2-chloroethoxy, 2,2-difluoroethoxy and 2,2,2-trichloroethoxy; preferably difluoromethoxy, 2-chloroethoxy and trifluoromethoxy.<br>

which is known or may be produced analogously to corresponding known compounds, and wherein R9, R10l An, X and c are defined as given for formula I, optionally in the presence of a basic catalyst;<br>
and in each case, if desired, a compound of formula I obtainable according to the method or in another way, respectively in free form or in salt form, is converted into another compound of formula I, a mixture of isomers obtainable according to the method is separated and the desired isomer isolated and/or a free compound of formula I obtainable according to the method is converted into a salt or a salt of an compound of formula I obtainable according to<br><br>
the method is converted into the free compound of formula I or into another salt.<br>
What has been stated above for salts of compounds I also applies analogously to salts of the starting materials listed hereinabove and hereinbelow.<br>
The reaction partners can be reacted with one another as they are, i.e. without the addition of a solvent or diluent, e.g. in the melt. In most cases, however, the addition of an inert solvent or diluent, or a mixture thereof, is of advantage. Examples of such solvents or diluents are: aromatic, aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, mesitylene, tetraline, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, bromobenzene, petroleum ether, hexane, cyclohexane, dichloromethane, trichloromethane, tetrachloromethane, dichloroethane, trichloroethene or tetrachloroethene; ethers, such as diethyl ether, dipropyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dibutyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethylether, dimethoxydiethylether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane; ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or methyl isobutyl ketone; amides such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-diethyl-formamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone or hexamethylphosphoric acid triamide; nitriles such as acetonitrile or propionitrile; and sulfoxides, such as dimethyl sulfoxide.<br>
Preferred leaving groups Q are halogens, preferably chlorine.<br>
Preferred leaving groups C^ are Ci-C6-alcohols, especially ethanol.<br>
Suitable bases for facilitating the reaction are e.g. alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, hydrides, amides, alkanolates, acetates, carbonates, dialkylamides or alkylsilyl-amides; alkylamines, alkylenediamines, optionally N-alkylated, optionally unsaturated, cyclo-alkylamines, basic heterocycles, ammonium hydroxides, as well as carbocyclic amines. Those which may be mentioned by way of example are sodium hydroxide, hydride, amide, methanolate, acetate, carbonate, potassium tert.-butanolate, hydroxide, carbonate, hydride, lithium diisopropylamide, potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)-amide, calcium hydride, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, triethylenediamine, cyclohexylamine, N-cyclohexyl-N,N-dimethyl-amine, N,N-diethylaniline, pyridine, 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine, quinuclidine, N-methyl-morpholine, benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide, as well as 1,5-diazabicyclo[5.4.0jundec-5-ene (DBU).<br>
The reaction advantageously takes place in a temperature range of ca. 0°C to ca. 150°C , preferably from ca. 20°C to ca. 100°C .<br><br>
Salts of compounds I may be produced in known manner. Acid addition salts, for example, are obtainable from compounds I by treating with a suitable acid or a suitable ion exchange reagent, and salts with bases are obtainable by treating with a suitable base or a suitable ion exchange reagent<br>
Salts of compounds I can be converted into the free compounds I by the usual means, acid addition salts e.g. by treating with a suitable basic composition or with a suitable ion exchange reagent, and salts with bases e.g. by treating with a suitable acid or a suitable ion exchange reagent.<br>
Salts of compounds I can be converted into other salts of compounds I in a known manner; acid addition salts can be converted for example into other acid addition salts, e.g. by treating a salt of an inorganic acid, such as a hydrochloride, with a suitable metal salt, such as a sodium, barium, or silver salt, of an acid, e.g. with silver acetate, in a suitable solvent, in which a resulting inorganic salt, e.g. silver chloride, is insoluble and thus precipitates out from the reaction mixture.<br>
Depending on the method and/or reaction conditions, compounds I with salt-forming characteristics can be obtained in free form or in the form of salts.<br>
Compounds I can also be obtained in the form of their hydrates and/or also can include other solvents, used for example where necessary for the crystallisation of compounds present in solid form.<br>
The compounds I may be optionally present as optical and/or geometric isomers or as a mixture thereof. The invention relates both to the pure isomers and to all possible isomeric mixtures, and is hereinbefore and hereinafter understood as doing so, even if stereochemical details are not specifically mentioned in every case.<br>
Diastereoisomeric mixtures of compounds I, which are obtainable by the process or in another way, may be separated in known manner, on the basis of the physical-chemical differences in their components, into the pure diastereoisomers, for example by fractional crystallisation, distillation and/or chromatography.<br>
Splitting of mixtures of enantiomers, that are obtainable accordingly, into the pure isomers, may be achieved by known methods, for example by recrystallisation from an optically active solvent, by chromatography on chiral adsorbents, e.g. high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on acetyl cellulose, with the assistance of appropriate micro-organisms, by cleavage with specific immobilised enzymes, through the formation of inclusion compounds, e.g. using<br><br>
chiral crown ethers, whereby only one enantiomer is complexed.<br>
According to the invention, apart from separation of corresponding isomer mixtures, generally known methods of diastereoselective or enantioselective synthesis can also be applied to obtain pure diastereoisomers or enantiomers, e.g. by carrying out the method of the invention using educts with correspondingly suitable stereochemistry.<br>
It is advantageous to isolate or synthesise the biologically more active isomer, e.g. enantiomer, provided that the individual components have differing biological efficacy.<br>
In the method of the present invention, the starting materials and intermediates used are preferably those that lead to the compounds I described at the beginning as being especially useful.<br>
The invention relates in particular to the preparation methods described in the examples.<br>
Starting materials and intermediates, which are new and are used according to the invention for the preparation of compounds I, as well as their usage and process for the preparation thereof, similarly form an object of the invention.<br>
The compounds I according to the invention are notable for their broad activity spectrum and are valuable active ingredients for use in pest control, including in particular the control of endo- and ecto-parasites on animals, whilst being well-tolerated by warm-blooded animals, fish and plants,<br>
In the context of the present invention, ectoparasites are understood to be in particular insects, mites and ticks. These include insects of the order: Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Homoptera, Heteroptera, Diptera, Thysanoptera, Orthoptera, Anoplura, Siphonaptera, Mallophaga, Thysanura, Isoptera, Psocoptera and Hymenoptera. However, the ectoparasites which may be mentioned in particular are those which trouble humans or animals and carry pathogens, for example flies such as Musca domestica, Musca vetustissima, Musca autumnalis, Fannia canicularis, Sarcophaga carnaria, Lucilia cuprina, Hypoderma bovis, Hypoderma lineatum, Chrysomyia chloropyga, Dermatobia hominis, Cochliomyia hominivorax, Gasterophilus intestinalis, Oestrus ovis, Stomoxys calcitrans, Haematobia irritans and midges (Nematocera), such as Culicidae, Simuliidae, Psychodidae, but also blood-sucking parasites, for example fleas, such as Ctenocephalides felis and Ctenocephalides canis (cat and dog fleas), Xenopsylla cheopis, Pulex irritans, Dermatophilus penetrans, lice, such as Damalina ovis, Pediculus humanis, biting fi.es and horse-flies (Tabanidae), Haematopota spp. such as Haematopota pluvialis, Tabanidea spp.<br><br>
such as Tabanus nigrovittatus, Chrysopsinae spp. such as Chrysops caecutiens, tsetse flies, such as species of Glossinia, biting insects, particularly cockroaches, such as Blatella germanica, Blatta orientalis, Periplaneta americana, mites, such as Dermanyssus gallinae, Sarcoptes scabiei, Psoroptes ovis and Psorergates spp. and last but not least ticks. The latter belong to the order Acarina. Known representatives of ticks are, for example, Boophilus, Ambfyomma, Anocentor, Dermacentor, Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma, Ixodes, Rhipicentor, Margaropus, Rhipicephalus, Argas, Otobius and Ornithodoros and the like, which preferably infest warm-blooded animals including farm animals, such as cattle, pigs, sheep and goats, poultry such as chickens, turkeys and geese, fur-bearing animals such as mink, foxes, chinchillas, rabbits and the like, as well as domestic animals such as cats and dogs, but also humans.<br>
The compounds I according to the invention are also active against all or individual development stages of animal pests showing normal sensitivity, as well as those showing resistance, such as insects and members of the order Acarina. The insecticidal, ovicidal and/or acaricidal effect of the active substances of the invention can manifest itself directly, i.e. killing the pests either immediately or after some time has elapsed, for example when moulting occurs, or by destroying their eggs, or indirectly, e.g. reducing the number of eggs laid and/or the hatching rate, good efficacy corresponding to a pesticidal rate (mortality) of at least 50 to 60%.<br>
Compounds I can also be used against hygiene pests, especially of the order Diptera of the families Sarcophagidae, Anophilidae and Culicidae; the orders Orthoptera, Dictyopiera (e.g. the family Blattidae) and Hymenoptera (e.g. the family Formicidae).<br>
In particular, the compounds are effective against helminths, in which the endoparasitic nematodes and trematodes may be the cause of serious diseases of mammals and poultry, e.g. sheep, pigs, goats, cattle, horses, donkeys, dogs, cats, guinea-pigs and exotic birds. Typical nematodes of this indication are: Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus, Ostertagia, Nematodirus, Cooperia, Ascaris, Bunostonum, Oesophagostonum, Charbertia, Trichuris, Strongylus, Trichonema, Dictyocaulus, Capillaria, Heterakis, Toxocara, Ascaridia, Oxyuris, Ancylostoma, Uncinaria, Toxascaris and Parascaris. The trematodes include, in pellicular, the family of Fasciolideae, especially Fasciola hepatica. The particular advantage of the compounds of formula I is their efficacy against those parasites that are resistant towards active ingredients based on benzimidazole.<br><br>
Certain pests of the species Nematodirus, Cooperia and Oesophagostonum infest the intestinal tract of the host animal, while others of the species Haemonchus and Ostertagia are parasitic in the stomach and those of the species Dictyocaulus are parasitic in the lung tissue. Parasites of the families Filariidae and Setariidae may be found in the internal cell tissue and in the organs, e.g. the heart, the blood vessels, the lymph vessels and the subcutaneous tissue. A particularly notable parasite is the heartworm of the dog, Dirofilaria immitis. The compounds of formula I are highly effective against these parasites.<br>
The pests which may be controlled by the compounds of formula I also include those from the class of Cestoda (tapeworms), e.g. the families Mesocestoidae, especially of the genus Mesocestoides, in particular M. lineatus; Dilepidide, especially Dipylidium caninum, Joyeuxiella spp., in particular Joyeuxiella pasquali, and Diplopylidium spp., and Taeniidae, especially Taenia pisiformis, Taenia cervi, Taenia ovis, Taneia hydatigena, Taenia multiceps,Taenia taeniaeformis, Taenia serialis, and Echinocuccus spp., most preferably Taneia hydatigena, Taenia ovis, Taenia multiceps, Taenia serialis; Echinocuccus granulosus and Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis, as well as Multiceps multiceps.<br>
Most particularly, Taenia hydatigena, T pisiformis, T. ovis, T taeniaeformis, Multiceps multiceps, Joyeuxiella pasquali, Dipylidium caninum, Mesocestoides spp., Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis are controlled on or in dogs and cats simultaneously with Dirofilaria immitis, Ancylostoma ssp., Toxocara ssp.and/or Trichuris vulpis.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of formula I are suitable for the control of human pathogenic parasites. Of these, typical representatives that appear in the digestive tract are those of the species Ancylostoma, Necator, Ascaris, Strongyloides, Trichinella, Capillaria, Trichuris and Enterobius. The compounds of the present invention are also effective against parasites of the species Wuchereria, Brugia, Onchocerca and Loa from the family of Filariidae, which appear in the blood, in the tissue and in various organs, and also against Dracunculus and parasites of the species Strongyloides and Trichinella, which infect the gastrointestinal tract in particular.<br>
In addition, the compounds of formula I are also effective against harmful and pathogenic fungi on plants, as well as on humans and animals.<br>
The good pesticidal activity of the compounds of formula I according to the invention corresponds to a mortality rate of at least 50-60% of the pests mentioned. The compounds of formula I are preferably employed in unmodified form or preferably together with the<br><br>
adjuvants conventionally used in the art of formulation and may therefore be processed in a known manner to give, for example, emulsifiable concentrates, directly dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, soluble powders, granules or microencapsulations in polymeric substances. As with the compositions, the methods of application are selected in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances.<br>
The formulation, i.e. the agents, preparations or compositions containing the active ingredient of formula I, or combinations of these active ingredients with other active ingredients, and optionally a solid or liquid adjuvant, are produced in a manner known per se, for example by intimately mixing and/or grinding the active ingredients with spreading compositions, for example with solvents, solid carriers, and optionally surface-active compounds (surfactants).<br>
The solvents in question may be: alcohols, such as ethanol, propanol or butanol, and glycols and their ethers and esters, such as propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol ether, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monomethyl or -ethyl ether, ketones, such as cyclohexanone, isophorone or diacetanol alcohol, strong polar solvents, such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolUone, dimethyl sulfoxide or dimethylformamide, or water, vegetable oils, such as rape, castor, coconut, or soybean oil, and also, if appropriate, silicone oils.<br>
Preferred application forms for usage on warm-blooded animals in the control of helminths include solutions, emulsions, suspensions (drenches), food additives, powders, tablets including effervescent tablets, boli, capsules, micro-capsules and pour-on formulations, whereby the physiological compatibility of the formulation excipients must be taken into consideration.<br>
The binders for tablets and boli may be chemically modified polymeric natural substances that are soluble in water or in alcohol, such as starch, cellulose or protein derivatives (e.g. methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, ethylhydroxyethyl cellulose, proteins such as zein, gelatin and the like), as well as synthetic polymers, such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone etc. The tablets also contain fillers (e.g. starch, microcrystalline cellulose, sugar, lactose etc.), glidants and disintegrants.<br>
If the anthelminthics are present in the form of feed concentrates, then the carriers used are e.g. performance feeds, feed grain or protein concentrates. Such feed concentrates or compositions may contain, apart from the active ingredients, also additives, vitamins, antibiotics, chemotherapeutics or other pesticides, primarily bacteriostats, fungistats, coccidiostats, or even hormone preparations, substances having anabolic action or<br><br>
substances which promote growth, which affect the quality of meat of animals for slaughter or which are beneficial to the organism in another way. If the compositions or the active ingredients of formula I contained therein are added directly to feed or to the drinking troughs, then the formulated feed or drink contains the active ingredients preferably in a concentration of ca. 0.0005 to 0.02 % by weight (5-200 ppm).<br>
The compounds of formula I according to the invention may be used alone or in combination with other biocides. They may be combined with pesticides having the same sphere of activity e.g. to increase activity, or with substances having another sphere of activity e.g. to broaden the range of activity. It can also be sensible to add so-called repellents. Since the compounds of formula I are adulticides, i.e. since they are effective in particular against the adult stage of the target parasites, the addition of pesticides which instead attack the juvenile stages of the parasites may be very advantageous. In this way, the greatest part of those parasites that produce great economic damage will be covered. Moreover, this action will contribute substantially to avoiding the formation of resistance. Many combinations may also lead to synergistic effects, i.e. the total amount of active ingredient can be reduced, which is desirable from an ecological point of view. Preferred groups of combination partners and especially preferred combination partners are named in the following, whereby combinations may contain one or more of these partners in addition to a compound of formula I.<br>
Suitable partners in the mixture may be biocides, e.g. the insecticides and acaricides with a varying mechanism of activity, which are named in the following and have been known to the person skilled in the art for a long time, e.g. chitin synthesis inhibitors, growth regulators; active ingredients which act as juvenile hormones; active ingredients which act as adulticides; broad-band insecticides, broad-band acaricides and nematicides; and also the well known anthelminthics and insect- and/or acarid-deterring substances, said repellents or detachers.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

As a consequence of the above details, a further essential aspect of the present invention relates to combination preparations for the control of parasites on warm-blooded animals, characterised in that they contain, in addition to a compound of formula I, at least one further active ingredient having the same or different sphere of activity and at least one<br><br>
physiologically acceptable carrier. The present invention is not restricted to two-fold combinations.<br>
As a rule, the anthelminthic compositions according to the invention contain 0.1 to J9 % by weight, especially 0.1 to 95 % by weight of active ingredient of formula I, la or mixtures thereof, 99.9 to 1 % by weight, especially 99.8 to 5 % by weight of a solid or liquid admixture, including 0 to 25 % by weight, especially 0.1 to 25 % by weight of a surfactant.<br>
Application of the compositions according to the invention to the animals to be treated may take place topically, perorally, parenterally or subcutaneously, the composition being present in the form of solutions, emulsions, suspensions, (drenches), powders, tablets, boli, capsules and pour-on formulations.<br>
The pour-on or spot-on method consists in applying the compound of formula I to a specific location of the skin or coat, advantageously to the neck or backbone of the animal. This takes place e.g. by applying a swab or spray of the pour-on or spot-on formulation to a relatively small area of the coat, from where the active substance is dispersed almost automatically over wide areas of the fur owing to the spreading nature of the components in the formulation and assisted by the animal's movements.<br>
Pour-on or spot-on formulations suitably contain carriers, which promote rapid dispersement over the skin surface or in the coat of the host animal, and are generally regarded as spreading oils. Suitable carriers are e.g. oily solutions; alcoholic and isopropanolic solutions such as solutions of 2-octyldodecanol or oleyl alcohol; solutions in esters of monocarboxylic acids, such as isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, lauric acid oxalate, oleic acid oleyl ester, oleic acid decyl ester, hexyl laurate, oleyl oleate, decyl oleate, capric acid esters of saturated fat alcohols of chain length C12-C18; solutions of esters of dicarboxylic acids, such as dibutyl phthalate, diisopropyl isophthalate, adipic acid diisopropyl ester, di-n-butyl adipate or also solutions of esters of aliphatic acids, e.g. glycols. It may be advantageous for a dispersing agent to be additionally present, such as one known from the pharmaceutical or cosmetic industry. Examples are 2-pyrrolidone, 2-(N-alkyl)pyrrolidone, acetone, polyethylene glycol and the ethers and esters thereof, propylene glycol or synthetic triglycerides.<br>
The oily solutions include e.g. vegetable oils such as olive oil, groundnut oil, sesame oil, pine oil, linseed oil or castor oil. The vegetable oils may also be present in epoxidised form. Paraffins and silicone oils may also be used.<br><br>
A pour-on or spot-on formulation generally contains 1 to 20 % by weight of a compound of formula I, 0.1 to 50 % by weight of dispersing agent and 45 to 98.9 % by weight of solvent.<br>
The pour-on or spot-on method is especially advantageous for use on herd animals such as cattle, horses, sheep or pigs, in which it is difficult or time-consuming to treat all the animals orally or by injection. Because of its simplicity, this method can of course also be used for all other animals, including individual domestic animals or pets, and is greatly favoured by the keepers of the animals, as it can often be carried out without the specialist presence of the veterinarian.<br>
Whereas it is preferred to formulate commercial products as concentrates, the end user will normally use dilute formulations.<br>
Such compositions may also contain further additives, such as stabilisers, anti-foaming agents, viscosity regulators, binding agents or tackifiers, as well as other active ingredients, in order to achieve special effects.<br>
Anthelminthic compositions of this type, which are used by the end user, similarly form a constituent of the present invention.<br>
In each of the processes according to the invention for pest control or in each of the pest control compositions according to the invention, the active ingredients of formula I can be used in all of their steric configurations or in mixtures thereof.<br>
The invention also includes a method of prophylactically protecting warm-blooded animals, especially productive livestock, domestic animals and pets, against parasitic helminths, which is characterised in that the active ingredients of formula I or the active ingredient formulations prepared therefrom are administered to the animals as an additive to the feed, or to the drinks or also in solid or liquid form, orally or by injection or parenterally. The invention also includes the compounds of formula I according to the invention for usage in one of the said processes.<br>

Biological Examples:<br>
1. In-vivo test on Trichostronavlus colubriformis and Haemonchus contortus on Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) using peroral application<br>
Six to eight week old Mongolian gerbils are infected by artificial feeding with ca. 2000 third instar larvae each of T. colubriformis and H. contortus, 6 days after infection, the gerbils are lightly anaesthetised with N20 and treated by peroral application with the test compounds, dissolved in a mixture of 2 parts DMSO and 1 part polyethylene glycol (PEG 300), in quantities of 100, 32 and 10-0.1 mg/kg. On day 9 (3 days after treatment), when <nost of the h. contortus that are still present late instar larvae and most t. colubriformis immature adults gerbils killed in order to count worms. efficacy is calculated as reduction number worms each gerbil compared with geometric average from infected untreated gerbils. this test a vast nematode infestation achieved compounds formula i.></nost><br>
To examine the insecticidal and/or acaricidal activity of the compounds of formula I on animals and plants, the following test methods may be used.<br>
2.	Acaricidal activity on Boophilus microplus (Biarra strain)<br>
A piece of sticky tape is attached horizontally to a PVC sheet, so that 10 fully engorged female ticks of Boophilus microplus (Biarra strain) can be adhered thereto by their backs, side by side, in a row. Using an injection needle, 1 y\ of a liquid is injected into each tick. The liquid is a 1:1 mixture of polyethylene glycol and acetone and it contains, dissolved therein, a certain amount of active ingredient chosen from 1, 0.1 or 0.01 |ag per tick. Control animals are given an injection without active ingredient. After treatment, the animals are kept under normal conditions in an insectarium at ca. 28°C and at 80% relative humidity until oviposition takes place and the larvae have hatched from the eggs of the control animals. The activity of a tested substance is determined by IR90, i.e. an evaluation is made of the dosage of active ingredient at which 9 out of 10 female ticks (=90%) lay eggs that are infertile even after 30 days.<br>
3.	In vitro efficacy on engorged female Boophilus microplus (BIARRA):<br>
4x10 engorged female ticks of the OP-resistant BIARRA strain are adhered to a sticky strip and covered for 1 hour with a cotton-wool ball soaked in an emulsion or suspension of the test compound in concentrations of 500, 125, 31 and 8 ppm respectively. Evaluation takes place 28 days later based on mortality, oviposition and hatched larvae.<br>
An indication of the activity of the test compounds is shown by the number of females that<br>
-	die quickly before laying eggs,<br>
-	survive for some time without laying eggs,<br>
-	lay eggs in which no embryos are formed,<br>
-	lay eggs in which embryos form, from which no larvae hatch, and<br>
-	lay eggs in which embryos form, from which larvae normally hatch within 26 to 27 days.<br>
4.	In vitro efficacy on nvmphs of Amblvomma hebraeum<br>
About 5 fasting nymphs are placed in a polystyrene test tube containing 2 ml Qf the test compound in solution, suspension or emulsion.<br>
After immersion for 10 minutes, and shaking for 2x10 seconds on a vortex mixer, the test tubes are blocked up with a tight wad of cotton wool and rotated. As soon as all the liquid has been soaked up by the cotton wool ball, it is pushed half-way into the test tube which is<br><br>
still being rotated, so that most of the liquid is squeezed out of the cotton-wool ball and flows into a Petri dish below.<br>
The test tubes are then kept at room temperature in a room with daylight until evaluated. After 14 days, the test tubes are immersed in a beaker of boiling water. If the ticks begin to move in reaction to the heat, the test substance is inactive at the tested concentration, otherwise the ticks are regarded as dead and the test substances regarded as active at the tested concentration. All substances are tested in a concentration range of 0.1 to 100 ppm.<br>
5.	Activity against Dermanvssus aallinae<br>
2 to 3 ml of a solution containing 10 ppm active ingredient, and ca. 200 mites (Dermanyssus gallinae) at different stages of development are added to a glass container which is open at the top. Then the container is closed with a wad of cotton wool, shaken for 10 minutes until the mites are completely wet, and then inverted briefly so that the remaining test solution can be absorbed by the cotton wool. After 3 days, the mortality of the mites is determined by counting the dead individuals and indicated as a percentage.<br>
6.	Activity against Musca domestica<br>
A sugar cube is treated with a solution of the test substance in such a way that the concentration of test substance in the sugar, after drying over night, is 250 ppm. The cube treated in this way is placed on an aluminium dish with wet cotton wool and 10 adult Musca domestica of an OP-resistant strain, covered with a beaker and incubated at 25°C. The mortality rate is determined after 24 hours.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
