				<td>METHOD OF MANUFACTURING THIN - FILM POLYMER FLUORESCENT<br>
INFORMATION LAYER ON THE RELIEF SURFACE OF CARRIER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to a method of manufacturing a multilayer fluorescent<br>
information carrier and more particular to the method utilizing a mixture of organic solvents for a<br>
photopolymeric composition (PPC).<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
In digital storage, whether of software, music, motion pictures, or the like, it has been desired to<br>
store ever more information in ever less space. Compact discs have been in use for about two decades<br>
to store music, software, and other materials in digital form. However, the fact that a compact disc has<br>
only one recording layer limits its information capacity.<br>
To increase the capacity relative to a traditional compact disc, optical memory media with<br>
multiple layers have been developed. However, when such media are read by reflection of coherent<br>
light, parasitic reflection can occur at layer boundaries. That reflection and the resulting interference<br>
impair reading.<br>
Examples of such devices, utilizing the multiplayer fluorescent carrier are disclosed in U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 6,039,898 and in WO 99 / 47327. Such carriers exhibit high recording density, contrast, and signal<br>
- to - noise ratio. It is common to use fluorescent recording materials that, when exposed to reading<br>
light at one wavelength, fluoresce at a different wavelength. The problem of parasitic reflection can be<br>
solved by filtering out reflected light at the reading wavelength. Also, since the fluorescent light is<br>
incoherent, there is no problem of interference.<br>
However, improvements remain to be made in the manufacturing of such carriers. In particular,<br>
it would be desirable to decrease both the thickness and the thickness variation of the recording layers<br>
while increasing production speed and improving the information reproduction characteristics.<br><br>
Such improvements are disclosed in previous PCT Application US01/01573 to Tri D Store<br>
IP, LLC, entitled "Manufacturing Method for Multilayer Fluorescent Information Carriers," the<br>
subject matter of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. The multilayer fluorescent<br>
information carrier comprises a photopolymerizable composition applied to a solid base having a<br>
relief pattern. A transparent film layer is applied on top of the photopolymerized composition.<br>
The three layers are spun in a centrifuge to cause a thin, even distribution of the<br>
photopolymerizable composition, which is photopolymerized. The resulting replica is separated<br>
from the relief pattern and has a fluorescent material applied thereto. Alternatively, the replica has<br>
a non-fluorescent material applied thereto, and the non-fluorescent material is made fluorescent<br>
through diffusion. Multiple information layers thus formed can be glued together to form a<br>
multilayer storage medium.<br>
However, improvements still remain to be made in the manufacture of such carriers. In<br>
particular, it would be desirable to:<br>
increase useful fluorescent signal, extracted from the informational pits;<br>
increase the signal contrast; and<br>
obtain more even fluorescent coverage.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The principal object of the invention comprises the utilization of a mixture of at least<br>
one ketone having a boiling temperature in the range of 98-120 °C with one or more other<br>
solvents having a boiling temperature of about 80 °C or lower. This mixture is used for the<br>
photopolymeric composition (PPC) with the fluorescent dye.<br>
During the procedure, a thin-layer fluorescent polymer coated with distributed fixed<br>
luminescent centers can be prepared by using photosolidified liquid polymer compositions<br>
containing luminophores. For this purposes, onto a film formed on a centrifuge, a composition is<br>
spin-coated forming a thin liquid film distributed across the replica surface in conformity with the<br>
shape of its relief and consisting predominantly of photosolidified, generally by cation and/or radial<br>
mechanisms, monomers and oligomers and dopants determining spectral and luminescent, physical<br><br>
and mathematical, adhesive and other characteristics of the polymer coat following its solidification<br>
by UV light. The liquid composition applied should possess a good spreadability on the replica<br>
surface, high adhesion, and ease of forming a liquid and solidified film uniformely spread on the<br>
surface and differentially in terms of the replica relief, which can be attained through using a<br>
specific composition as well as coating and solidification conditions. Photosolidification of the<br>
composition results in a bilayer structure with a polymeric replica and thin-film fluorescent<br>
polymer coat. The bilayer structure represents as a unit a single layer a fluorescent information<br>
carrier. From similarly generated single layer carriers, there can be fabricated multilayer<br>
fluorescent information carriers of various types by sealing them together.<br>
Special agreement zone, which align conditions of pits occupancy in the zone of input<br>
tracks and in the disk areas, was suggested to improve the occupancy of disk input tracks having<br>
the initial track located at radius Rl. Such a zone could begin at radius R2<r1 and should finish at></r1>
radius R3=R1. Usually even disk surface reside before input tracks zone therefore pit occupancy<br>
conditions at centrifuge are different for first tracks of input tracks and those for whole disk. To<br>
remove this disadvantage the disk surface relief in the agreement zone should be the same as in the<br>
region of input tracks. The using same distances between tracks, and same depth, width could<br>
realize this and density of pits in input track region and in agreement zone. Zone width is selected<br>
in a such way that pit occupancy conditions in the beginning of input track region will be the same<br>
as for whole disk area.<br>
