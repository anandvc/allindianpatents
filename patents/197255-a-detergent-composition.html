				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a detarget composition , in cither liquid or granular form, for use in laundry<br>
applications, wherein the compositions comprise certain cdlulosic based polymer or oligomer materials which impart appearance and integrity benefits to fabrics and textiles laundered in washing solutions formed from such compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, of course, well known that alternating cycles of using and laundering fabrics and textiles, such as articles of worn clothing and apparel, will inevitably adversely affect the appearance and integrity of the fabric and textile items so used and laundered. Fabrics and textiles simply wear out over time and with use. Laundering of fabrics and textiles, is necessary to remove soils and stains which accumulate therein and thereon during ordinary use. However, the laundering operation itself, over many cycles, can accentuate and contribute to the deterioration of the integrity and the appearance of such fabrics and textiles.<br>
Deterioration of febric integrity and appearance can manifest itself in several ways. Short fibers arc dislodged from woven and knit fabric/textile structures by the mechanical action of laundering. These dislodged fibers may form lint, fuzz or "pills" which arc visible on the surface of fabrics and diminish the appearance of newness of the fabric. Further, repeated laundering of fabrics and textiles, especially with bleach-containing laundry products, can remove dye from fabrics and textiles and impart a faded, worn out appearance as a result of diminished color intensity, and in many cases, as a result of changes in hues or shades of color.<br>
Given the foregoing, there is clearly an ongoing need to identify materials which could be added to<br>
laundry detergent products that would associate themselves with the fibers of the fabrics-arid textiles laundered using such detergent products and thereby reduce or minimize the tendency of the laundered fabric/textiles to deteriorate in appearance. Any such detergent product additive material should, of course be able to benefit fabric appearance and integrity without unduly interfering with the ability of the laundry detergent to perform its fabric cleaning function. The present invention is directed to the use of cellulo based polymer or oligomer materials in laundry applications which perform in this desired manner.<br>

In this respect bacterial or fungal enzymes are preferred, such as bacterial amylwcsiad proteases, and fungal celluloses.<br>
"Detersive enzyme", as used herein, means any enzyme having a cleaning, stain removing or otherwise beneficial effect in a laundry detergent composition. Preferred enzymes for laundry purposes include, but are not limited to, proteases, cellulases, lipascs, amylases and pcroxidases.<br>
Enzymes are normally incorporated into detergent compositions at levels sufficient to provide a "cleaning-effective amount". The term "cleaning-effective amount" refers to any amount capable of producing a cleaning, stab removal, soil removal, whitening, deodorizing, or freshness improving effect on substrates such as fabrics. In practical terms for current commercial preparations, typical amounts to about 5 mg by weight, more typically 0.01 mg to 3 mg, of active enzyme per gram of the detergent composition. Stated otherwise, the compositions herein will typically comprise from 0.001% to 5%, preferably 0.01%-1% by weight of a commercial enzyme preparation.

The enzyme stabilizing system can be any stabilizing system which is compatible with the detersive enzyme. Such a system may be inherently provided by other formulation actives, or be added separately, e.g., by the formuhtor or by a manufacturer of detergenC'ready enzymes. Such stabilizing systems can, for example, comprise calcium ton, boric acid, propylene glycol, short chain earboxylic acids, boronic acids, and mixtures thereof, and are designed to address different stabilization problems depending on the type and physical form of the detergent composition.<br>
E) Detergent Composition Preparation<br>
The detergent compositions according to the present invention can be in liquid, paste or granular form. Such compositions can be prepared by combining the essential and optional components in the requisite concentrations in any suitable order and by any conventional means.<br>
Granular compositions, for example, are generally made by combining base granule ingredients, e.g., surfactants, builders, water, etc., as a slurry, and spray drying the resulting slurry to a low level of residual       moisture (5-12%),   The remaining dry ingredients, e.g., granules of the essential ccllulosic based fabric<br><br>
treatment materials, can be admixed in granular powder form with the spray dried granules jn a. rotary mixing drum. The liquid ingredients, e.g., solutions of the essential cellulosic based" fabric trcatabqt materials, enzymes, binders and perfumes, can be sprayed onto the resulting granules to form the finished detergent composition. Granular compositions according to the present invention can also be in "compact form", i.e. they may have a relatively higher density than conventional granular detergents, i.e. from 550 to 950 g/1. In such case, the granular detergent compositions according to the present invention will contain 4 lower amount of "inorganic filler salt", compared to couventional granular detergents; typical filler salts are alkaline earth metal salts of sulphates and chlorides, typically sodium sulphate; "compact" detergents typically comprise not more than 10% filler salt.<br>
Liquid detergent compositions can be prepared by admixing the essential and optional ingredients thereof in any desired order to provide compositions containing components in the requisite conccntration. Liquid compositions according to the present invention can also be in "compact form", in such case, the liquid detergent compositions according to the present invention will contain a lower amount of water, compared to conventional liquid detergents. Addition of the cellulosic based polymer or oligomer materials to liquid detergent or other aqueous compositions of this invention may be accomplished by simply mixing into the liquid solutions the desired cellulosic based fabric treatment materials.<br>
F) Fabric laundering Method<br>
The present invention also provides a method for Kiundering fabrics in a-manner which imparts fabric appearance benefits provided by the cellulosic based polymer or oligomer materials used herein. Such p. method employs contacting these fabrics with an aqueous washing solution formed from an effective amount of the detergent compositions hereinbefore described or formed from the individual components of such compositions. Contacting of fabrics with washing solution will generally occur under conditions of agitation although the compositions of the present invention may also be used to form aqueous unagitated soaking solutions for fabric cleaning and treatment. As discussed above, it is preferred that the washing solution have a pH of less than about 10,0, preferably it has a pH of about 9.5 and most preferably it has a pH of about 73.<br>
Agitation is preferably provided in a wasliing machine for good cleaning. Washing is preferably followed by drying the wet fabric in a conventional clothes dryer. An effective amount of a high density liquid or granular detergent composition in the aqueous wash solution in the washing machine is preferably from about 500 to about 7000 ppm, more preferably from about 1000 to about 3000 ppm.<br>
G) Fabric Conditioning<br>
The ceilulosic based polymer or oligorner materials hereinbefore described as components of the laundry detergent compositions hereto, may also be used to rrcat and condition fabrics and textiles in the<br>
absence of the surfactant and builder components of the detergent composition embodiments of this invention. Thus, for example, a fabric conditioning composition comprising only the ccllulo5ic based fabric treatment materials themselves, or comprising an aqueous solution of the cellulosic based fabric treatnent materials, may be added during the rinse cycle of a conventional home laundering operation in order to impart the desired fabric appearance and integrity benefits hereinbefore described.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples illustrate the compositions and methods of the present invention, bul are act necessarily meant to limit or otherwise define the scope of the invention.<br>
The first step in the production of the cellulosic based polymer or oligomer materials of the present invention is to convert the carboxymethylcellulose ("CMC") to a methyl ester. While there are numerous methods for accomplishing this step of the process known to those skilled in the art, two cxemplary processes are given below as Examples I and IT. Examples I and II differ both in the method of converting; the CMC to a methyl ester as well as the feedstock of CMC as detailed below,<br>
EXAMPLE 1 Conversion of Purified CMC to_ Partial MethylEster<br>
AD. 80g (0.257 mole equivalents) sample of carboxymcthylceilulosc (Aldrich, MW = 90,000, DSRC = 0.7, and corresponding to the general formula defined above wherein x = 0) is suspended in a mixture of 196 g t-butanol, 15.7 g water, and 2.36g toluene (as an internal standard) in a 500 ml, 3-necked, round bottom flask equipped with mechanical stirrer, internal thermometer, condenser, and inert gas inlet, Then, 9,72g (0.077 mol) of dimethyl sulfate is added with stirring at room temperature. After about 2 hours, 50% sodium hydroxide is added as necessary to restore the pH to about 7-8 as judged on an aJiquot diluted with 5 volumes of water, Stirring is continued at room temperature for 40 hours. At this point a Ig sample of the liquor is withdrawn and 0.25g of pyridinc is added. NMR spcctroscopy of this sample in dimethyl sulfoxtde reveals that little or no methylated pyridinc has formed showing tliat the dimethyl sulfaie has all reacted. The modified CMC is collected by filtration and washed on the filter with several volumes of t-butanol-water and then dried under vacuum at 100°C, The atr-infrared spectrum of this material shows: carbonyl peaks for both ester and carboxylate groups consistent with the desired partial methyl ester.<br>
The procedure is repeated except that the temperature is held at 25°C for 2 hours and then raised to 70°C for 2 hours before isolation.<br>
EXAMPLE II Conversion of Commercial Crude CMC to Partial Methyl Ester<br>
An 80g (0.169 mole equiv.) sample of commercial CMC (Penn-Carbose, MW = 250,000, DSRC 0.59, 70% active) is suspended in a mixture of I97g t-butanol, 15g water» and 15g toluene (as an internal standard) in a 500 ml, 3-necfced round bottom flask equipped with mechanical stirrer, internal theimoistir, condenser, and inert gas inlet. Then, 14.98g (O.U9 mol) of dimethyl sulfate: is added with stirring at room temperature. After about 2 hours, 50% sodium hydroxide is added as necessary to restore the pH to about 7-8 as judged on an aliquot diluted with 5 volumes of water. Stirring is continued at room temperature for 1 hours and thea the temperature is raised to 70°C for 2 more hours. At this point a Ig sample of the liquor is withdrawn and 0.25g of pyridine is added. NMR spectroscopy of this sample in dimethyl sulfoxide reveals that little or no methylated pyridine has formed showing that the dimethyl sulfate has all reacted. The modified CMC is collected by filtration. One half of the collected solids is recombined with one half of the liquors and saved for later reaction. The other half of the collected solids is washed on the filter with several volumes of t-butanol-watcr and then dried under vacuum at 100°C, The atr-infraned spectrum of this material shows carbonyl peaks for both ester and carboxylate groups consistent with the desired partial methyl ester.<br>
EXAMPLE III Treatment of CMC Methyl Ester with DimethvlaminoDropvlamine<br>
The following is one process for converting the CMC mcchyl esters, such as those produced in<br>
Examples I and n above, to a partial DMAPA Amide.<br>
CMC        Me2SO4       CMC	DMAPA	        CMC<br>
(PS  0.59)   Alcohol-H20   Partial methyl ester   EtOH-H2O or toluene    Partial DMAPA Amide<br>
One half of the CMC methyl ester produced in either of Examples I or II above is resuspended ia the t-butanol-water liquor in which it was made and is treated with 3-dimethylaminopropylaminc ("DMAPA", 24.2g, 0.24 mol, Aldrich) by heating under reflux for 18 hours. The solids are collected on a filter;aqd washed with cthanol. They are then suspended in ethanol containing 10% water and the pH is raised to 11.5. After stirring at room temperature for 30 minutes, the solids are collected on a filter and washed with more aqueous ethanol and then with ethanol. An aliquot of this material is hydrolyzed by heating in 3N H2S04 in D20 for 18 hours. An aliquot of the hydrolysatc is adjusted to pH 12, centrifuged to clarify, and then examined by NMR spectroscopy. This shows a resonance for the dimetbylamino groups of the DMAPA and the relative size of the peak indicates that at least about 5% of the caiboxylate groups have been converted to amides of DMAPA.<br>
The treatment with DMAPA is repeated using the isolated methyl ester except that the suspending medium is toluene. The partial methyl ester is again partially converted to the DMAPA amide. <br>
EXAMPLE IV Partial Hydrolysis of Partial Methyl Ester of CMC<br>
The following is another process for converting the CMC methyl esters, such as those produced in Example H above, to a partial DMAPA Amide.<br>
CMC         HO	CMC	DMAPA         140C	CMC<br>
(DS-0.59)  ROH-H2O     Partial acid form   SOH-H20     o-xylene     Partial DMAPA Amide<br>
A commercial sample of CMC (Peon-Carbose, MW = 250,000, DSRc = 0-59, 70% active) which Is partially converted to methyl ester by the method of Example II (DS of ester = 0.18) is suspended in cthanol-waicr and heated with enough sodium hydroxide to hydrolyze 70% of the esters. The resulting partially hydrolyzed ester is collected on a filter and washed with cthanol and dried under vacuum at 100° C. The atr-IR sho\vs some residual ester carbonyl peak. The partially hydrolyzed ester displays partial solubility in water.<br>
The hydrolysis is repeated, but the base used is an excess of 3-dimethyiaminopropyIamine. The isolated product shows a small amount of residual ester by atr-IR.<br>
The present composition is not obtained by chemical process.   The ingredients of the said composition are not reacting, but interacting synergistically and giving unexpected result.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
