These members have sensors and actuators to tilt them by 90° when in contact with an article. These members return to their vertical position when there is no contact. The two tilting steps rotate the article to be dried such that the side which rested on the conveyor initially stands exposed to heat when the conveyor enters the second heating chamber.

This invention relates to a device for continuously drying coated articles. The device of this invention is particularly but not exclusively useful in drying epoxy coated alloy cores for transformers.<br>
Conventionally, transformer cores are coated with an epoxy resin and dried in an oven. Drying technique known in the art does not result in even drying of articles as they are not subjected to heat treatment uniformly. This invention aims at uniformly drying an object continuously. Transformer alloy cores having partially dried epoxy resin coatings are often rejected by the industry and this has necessitated the development of this device.<br>
The device for continuously drying articles has at least two chambers. Conveyor<br>
means driven by a motor, transports articles to be dried from one oven to the<br>
other. The ovens have heating means and temperature sensors. A tilting trolley<br>
is provided in the conveyor belt. This trolley has a support frame, sensor means<br>
and actuating means. The trolley top is made of two members which are tiltable<br>
to 90° on actuation. Normally, these members that constitute the trolley top are<br>
disposed vertically to the conveyor means but when actuated each member tilts<br>
90° to a total of 180°, thus connecting the conveyor belts to provide a	<br><br>
continuous passage for the articles to be dried. The oven is preferably heated with infra red lamps and heating elenents. The heating zone of the oven is provided with a therao couple which senses the tenperature of the oven and controls the thyristor systen to regulate the temperature to -4- or - 5^C. The oven is provided with a circulating means such as fans for uniform distribution of heated air within the oven chamber.<br>
The conveyor is motorised and is coupled with a gear arrangement. It is therefore possible to provide variable speed drive to the conveyor as desired.<br>
The tilting trolley is coupled with an AC motor and a warm wheel gear box. Signalling or switching means are also provided which sends signals to a timer to activate the motor.<br>
The electrical system of the device is connected to a control panel with push buttons. This panel is also provided with a digital temperature indicating means which monitors and displays the temperature of the device.<br>
Production rate of the article is increased by using the device according to this invention. Transformer alloy core members coated with epoxy resin and dried by this device have a better glossy finish and have improved bonding strength as a<br><br>
result of uniform and controlled heating. As manual handling and room temperature drying are avoided, rejection rate of the finished article is much reduced. If necessary alloy cores coated and dried in the device may be given a second epoxy coating and may be subjected to a second drying step. The conveyor and the tiltable trolley are mounted on support members.<br>
The device for continuously drying coated articles such as epoxy coated alloy cores for transformers according to this invention comprises at least two heating chambers provided with heating elements, a drivable conveyor means connecting the heating chambers through a tiltable trolley, the said trolley having two tiltable members vertically disposed to the said conveyor means, the said vertical members having sensors and actuating means for tilting each vertical member to 90° when in contact with an article, to establish continuous passage of articles through the conveyor means, means for restoring each tilted member to its original vertical position and control panel for controlling the operations.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the figures in the accompanying drawings.<br>
In the Fig.I reference letters Hi and H2 indicate the heating chambers connected by the conveyor B. Tilting trolley TT<br><br>
is provided in between the conveyor to establish continuous passage of the articles to be dried. Reference letter A stands for the article to be heated while C1and C2 are the heating elements for heating the chambers. TM stands for the tlltable nenber of the trolley while S1 and 82 sre sensors which senses the incoming article for actuating and energising the members TM to tilt to 90^ each to a total of 180°, thus establishing continuous passage. Motor H-^ and M2 energises the tiltable members when sensors send signals. Actuating means like a limiting switch is provided to actuate the motor when sensing means sends out signals. Conventional control panel (not shown in the drawings) provided with push buttons and temperature indicating means controls the operation of the device.<br>
Fig.II is an enlarged view of the tilting table.<br>
Method of operation:<br>
Articles to be dried are fed to the first heatiAg chamber. As the conveyor moves, the articles approach the tiltable trolley. When the incoming article in the conveyor means establishes contact with the sensor of the tiltable vertical member, the motor connected thereto is activated and the vertical member tilts to 90*^ allowing the passage of the article.   During<br><br>
its onward movement, the article contacts the sensor of the second vertical member which also tilts to 90, thus forming a continuous passage.<br>
The advantage is that during these tilting steps, the article to be dried is rotated in such a way that the side which rested on the conveyor before such tilting, coaes to the top, thereby exposing that surface also to be heated in the second heating chamber. This ensures uniform and complete drying and bonding of the article, which may be an alloy core coated with epoxy resins.<br>
Though the invention has been described with reference to a specific embodiaent, obvious equivalents known to persons skilled in the art are not excluded from the scope of the invention and the appended claims.<br><br><br>
We claim  :<br>
1.	A device for continuously drying coated articles such as epoxy coated<br>
alloy cores for transformers comprising at least two heating chambers provided<br>
with heating elements, a drivable conveyor means connecting the heating<br>
chambers through a tillable trolley, the said trolley having two tiltable members<br>
vertically disposed to the said conveyor means, the said vertical members<br>
having sensors and actuating means for tilting each verticle member to 90°<br>
when in contact with an article, to establish continuous passage of articles<br>
through the conveyor means, means for restoring each tilted member to its<br>
original vertical position and control panel for controlling the operations.<br>
2.	The device as claimed in claim 1 wherein the tiltable trolley is provided with a motor and worm wheel gear assembly.<br>
3.	The device as claimed in claims 1 and 2 wherein the actuating means for tilting the vertical members are limiting switches.<br>
4.	The device as claimed in any of the above claims, wherein a motor and gear assembly is provided for driving the conveyor in a predetermined speed.<br>
5.	The device as claimed in claim 4 wherein the heating chambers are<br>
provided with electric treating elements.<br>
6.	The device as claimed in claims 1 to 4 wherein the heating chamber is<br>
provided with infra-red lamps to heat the chamber.<br><br>
7.	The device as claimed in any of the above claims wherein the conveyor<br>
and the tiltable trolley are mounted on support members.<br>
8.	The device as claimed in claims 1 to 4 wherein the heating chambers are<br>
provided with air circulating means such as electrically operated fans.<br>
9.	The device as claimed in any of the above claims wherein the electrical<br>
