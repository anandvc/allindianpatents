Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a method of extruding an extrudable enhanced property metal polymer composite by novel interactions of the components. The method can be used to extrude the composite material into useful shapes. The extruded high density metal polymer composite materials are not simple admixtures, but obtain enhanced chemical, electrical and mechanical properties from an extrusion of a unique combination of a metal particulate and polymer material matrix that optimizes the properties of the composite through blending the combined polymer and metal materials.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Substantial attention has been paid to the creation of composite materials with unique properties. Included in this class of materials is a high-density material<br>
with improved properties. As an example, lead has been commonly used in applications requiring a high-density material. Applications of high-density materials include shotgun pellets, other ballistic projectiles, fishing lures, fishing weights, wheel weights, and other high-density applications. Lead has also been used in applications requiring properties other than density including in radiation shielding because of its resistance to a, J3 and y radiation, EMI and malleability characteristics. Press-on fishing weights made of lead allow the user to easily pinch the weight onto a fishing line without tools or great difficulty. In the case of shotgun pellets, or other ballistic projectiles, lead offers the required density, penetrating force and malleability to achieve great accuracy and minimum gun barrel wear. Lead has been a primary choice for both hunting and military applications. Lead has well known toxic drawbacks in pellet and projectile end uses. Many jurisdictions in the United States and elsewhere have seriously considered bans on the sale and use of lead shot and lead sinkers due to increasing concentrations of lead in kikes and resulting mortality in natural populations. Depleted uranium, also used in projectiles, has workability, toxicity and radiation problems.<br>
Composite materials have been suggested as a replacement for lead and other high-density materials. Composite materials have been made for many years by combining generally two dissimilar materials to obtain beneficial properties from both, A true composite is unique because die interaction of the materials provides the best properties of bom components. Many types of composite materials are known and are not simple admixtures. Generally, the art recognizes that combining metals of certain types and at proportions mat form an alloy provides unique properties in metal/metal alloy materials. Metal/ceramic composites have been made typically involving combining metal particulate or fiber with clay materials that can be fired into a metal/ceramic composite.<br>
Combining typically a thermoplastic or thermoset polymer phase with a reinforcing powder or fiber produces a range of filled materials and, under the correct conditions, can form a true polymer composite. A filled polymer, with the additive as a filler, cannot display composite properties. A filler material typically comprises inorganic materials mat act as either pigments or extenders for the polymer systems. A vast variety of fiber-reinforced composites have been made<br>
typically to obtain fiber reinforcement properties to improve the mechanical properties of the polymer in a unique composite.<br>
Metal polymer admixtures in which a finely divided metallic material, a metal powder or fiber is dispersed in a polymer have been suggested. One subset of filled polymer materials is metal polymer admixtures in which a metallic material, a metal particulate or fiber is dispersed in a polymer. The vast majority of these materials are admixtures and are not true composites. Admixtures are typically easily separable into the constituent parts and display the properties of the components. A true composite resists separation and displays enhanced properties of the input materials. A true composite does not display the properties of the individual components. Tarlow, U.S. Patent No. 3,895,143, teaches a sheet material comprising elastomer latex mat includes dispersed inorganic fibers and finely divided metallic particles. Bruner et aL, U.S. Patent No. 2,748,099, teach a nylon material containing copper, aluminum or graphite for the purpose of modifying the thermal or electrical properties of the material, but not the density of the admixture. Sandbank, U.S. Patent No. 5,548,125, teaches a clothing article comprising a flexible polymer with a relatively small volume percent of tungsten for the purpose of obtaining radiation shielding. Belanger et aL, U.S. Patent No. 5,237,930, disclose practice ammunition containing copper powder and a thermoplastic polymer, typically a nylon material. Epson Corporation, JP 63-273664 A shows a polyamide containing metal silicate glass fiber, tight knit whiskers and other materials as a metal containing composite. Bray et aL, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,048379 and 6,517,774, disclose an attempt to produce tungsten polymer composite materials. The patent disclosures combine tungsten powder having a particle size less than 10 microns, optionally with other components and a polymer or a metal fiber. The materials sold by the Bray et al. assignee and the materials disclosed hi the patent do not attain a density greater than 10.0 gm-cm"3.<br>
While a substantial amount of work has been done regarding composite materials generally, high density metal composite materials have not been obtained having a density greater than 10 grams-cm"3. Increasing the density of these materials introduces unique mechanical properties into the composite and, when used, obtains properties that are not present in the lower density composite materials. A substantial need exists for an extrudable material that has high density,<br>
low toxicity, and improved properties in terms of electrical/magnetic properties, malleability, thermal processability, particularly using existing thermal processing equipment, and viscoelastic properties.<br>
Brief Description of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to an extrusion method and an extrudable metal polymer composite material having improved properties with respect to prior art materials. The material of the invention, through a selection of metal particle size distribution, polymer and processing conditions, attains improved density or other properties through minimization of the polymer filled excluded volume of the composite. The resulting composite materials exceed the prior art composites in terms of density, reduced toxicity, improved malleability, improved ductility, improved viscoelastic properties (such as tensile modulus, storage modulus, elastic-plastic deformation and others) electrical/magnetic properties, and machine molding properties substantially reduse wear in processing equipment We have produced true composites and can obtain viscoelastic properties. We have produced a composite by using an interfacial modifier to improve the association of the particulate with the polymer. We have found mat the composite materials of the invention can have a designed level of density, mechanical properties, or electrical/magnetic properties from careful composition blending. The novel viscoelastic properties make tile materials useful in a variety of uses not filled by composites and provides a material easily made and formed into useful shapes. We have found mat density and polymer viscoelasticity measured as elongation are useful properties and useful predictive parameters of a true composite in this technology. In the production of useful enhanced properties, the packing of the selected particle size and distribution and the selection of the particulate or mixed metal particulate, will obtain the enhanced properties. As such density can be used as a predictor of the other useful property enhancement. The invention relates to an extruded enhanced metal polymer composite material having improved properties with respect to prior art materials. Single metal and mixed metal composites can be tailored for increasing a variety of properties including but not limited to density, color, magnetism, thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity and other physical properties. The use of compositions further comprising a interfacial modifier<br>
demonstrates improved utilization of material properties and improved performance such as elongation and other properties. Preferred composites can be combined with one or more polymers of a given molecular weight distribution and one or more metal particulates with a given distribution to obtain unique composites. Briefly, the metal polymer composites of the invention can be extruded into a high-density material comprising a high-density metal particulate of defined particle size and size distribution, a polymer, and optionally a interfacial modifier material.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention a selected metal particulate having a specified particle size and size distribution is selected with a polymer with a molecular weight distribution to form an improved composite. Such particles can have a defined circularity that promotes maximum property development, hi this system a metal particulate and fluoropolymer composite achieves the stated properties.<br>
La another embodiment, an interfacial modifier is used to ensure that the proportions of metal particulate and polymer obtain the minimum excluded volume filled with polymer, the highest particulate packing densities, the maximize polymer composite material properties and obtain the maximum wtiliTarion of materials. The high-density materials of the invention can contain pigments or other ingredients to modify fee visual appearance of flic materials. Mixed metal particulate, bimetallic (e.g. WQ or alloy metal composites can be used to tailor properties for specific uses. These properties include but arc not limited to density, thermal properties such as conductivity, magnetic properties, electrical properties such as conductivity, color, etc. These materials and combination of materials can be used as solid-state electrochemical (e.g. battery) and semiconductor structures. Preferred higher density metal polymer materials can also be combined with one or more polymers and one or more metal particulate to obtain unique composites. A secondary metal can be combined with a metal of high density. A composite can comprise a variety of different combinations of metals and polymers. The metal particulate can contain two metal particulates of different metals, each metal having a relatively high density, hi another embodiment, the metal particulate can comprise a metal particulate of high density and a secondary metal. Other useful metals of this disclosure relates to a metal that, by itself, cannot achieve a density greater than 10 in the composite material, but can provide useful properties to the composite as a<br>
whole. Such properties can include electrical properties, magnetic properties, physical properties, including heat conductivity, acoustical shielding, etc. Examples of such secondary metals include, but not limited to, iron, copper, nickel, cobalt, bismuth, tin, cadmium and zinc. The materials of the invention permit the design engineers the flexibility to tailor the composite to end-uses and avoid the use of toxic or radioactive materials unless desired. Lead or depleted uranium are no longer needed in their typical applications now that the dense composites of the invention are available, hi other applications where some tailored level of toxicity or radiation is needed, the composites of the invention can be used successfully with desired properties engineered into the material.<br>
Briefly, using the technology of the invention, the metal polymer composites<br>
of the invention can provide enhanced polymer composite properties. One<br>
important material comprises a composite having a density greater than 10 gm-cm"3<br>
or higher, typically greater than 11.7 gm-cm"3, greater man 12.5 gm-cm'3 or greater<br>
than 16.0 gm-cm'3. The composite comprises a high-density metal particulate, a<br>
polymer, and optionally an interfacial modifier material. The compositions of the<br>
invention can also contain other additives such as a visual indicator, fluorescent<br>
marker, dye or pigment at an amount of at least about 0.01 to5wt%. The<br>
cxnnposites of the mventkm comprise about 47 to 90 volume-%meta^	15 wt-<br>
% polymer, 10 to 53 volume-% polymer in the composite. In this disclosure, we rely on density as an important property that can be tailored in the composite but other useful properties can be designed into the composite.<br>
Enhanced property metal polymer composites can be made by melt forming, preferable extruding, an extrudable composite. In the composite, the metal particulate is obtained at the highest possible packing by a careful selection of particle size and size distribution. The excluded volume in the particulate are substantially completely occupied by the polymer without reducing the composite density. Using a carefully selected finely divided metal, packing the particulate and combining the particulate with just sufficient polymer such that only the excluded volume (the space left after packing the particle distribution) of the particulate is filled can optimize the high density of the composite material. A metal particulate, or metal particulate blend, is selected having an absolute density of metal greater man about 4 grams-cm'3, greater than 7 grams-cm"3, greater than 10 grams-cm'3 andoften greater than 16 gm-cm*3. The participate has a selected particle size and size distribution that is combined with a polymer selected for compatibility and increased density and processability. As the metal particulate and the polymer component increase in density, the composite material increases in density. The ultimate composite density is further controlled by efficiency in packing of the metal particulate in the composite and the associated efficiency in filling the unoccupied voids in the densely packed particulate with high density polymer material. The interfacial modifier can aid in closely associating the metal particulate and polymer to maximize density. A true composite is obtained by carefully processing the combined polymer and polymer particulate until density reaches a level showing that using an interfacial modifier to promote composite formation results in enhanced property development and high density. In this disclosure, we rely on density as one important property that can be tailored in the composite but other useful properties can be designed into the composite.<br>
A composite is more than a simple admixture. A composite is defined as a combination of two or more substances intermingled with various percentages of composition, in which each component retains its essential original properties. A controlled combination of separate materials results in properties mat is superior to those of its constituents. In a simple admixture the mixed material have little interaction and little property enhancement One of the materials is chosen to increase stiffness, strength or density. Atoms and molecules can form bonds with other atoms or molecules using a number of mechanisms. Such bonding can occur between the electron cloud of an atom or molecular surfaces including molecular-molecular interactions, atom-molecular interactions and atom-atom interactions. Each bonding mechanism involves characteristic forces and dimensions between the atomic centers even in molecular molecular interactions. The important aspect of such bonding force is strength, the variation of bonding strength over distance and directionality. The major forces in such bonding include ionic bonding, covalent bonding and the van der Waals* (VDW) types of bonding. Ionic radii and bonding occur hi ionic species such as Na+Q", LrtT. Such ionic species form ionic bonds between the atomic centers. Such bonding is substantial, often substantially greater than 100 kJ-mol*1 often greater man 250 kJ-mol"1. Further, the interatomic distance for ionic radii tend to be small and on the order of 1-3 A. Covalent bonding results<br>
from the overlap of electron clouds surrounding atoms forming a direct covalent bond between atomic centers. The covalent bond strengths are substantial, are roughly equivalent to ionic bonding and tend to have somewhat smaller interatomic distances.<br>
The varied types of van der Waals1 forces are different than covalent and ionic bonding. These van der Waals' forces tend to be forces between molecules, not between atomic centers. The van der Waals' forces are typically divided into three types of forces including dipole-dipole forces, dispersion forces and hydrogen bonding. Dipole-dipole forces are a van der Waals' force arising from temporary or permanent variations in the amount or distribution of charge on a molecule.<br>
Summary of Chemical Forces and Interactions<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
Since VDW London forces increase with increasing size and Awe is no limit to the size of molecules, these forces can become rather large. In general, however, they are very weak.<br>
Dipole structures arise by the separation of charges on a molecule creating a generally or partially positive and a generally or partially negative opposite end. The forces arise from electrostatic interaction between the molecule negative and positive regions. Hydrogen bonding is a dipole-dipole interaction between a<br>
hydrogen atom and an electronegative region in a molecule, typically comprising an oxygen, fluorine, nitrogen or other relatively electronegative (compared to H) site. These atoms attain a dipole negative charge attracting a dipole-dipole interaction with a hydrogen atom having a positive charge. Dispersion force is the van der Waals1 force existing between substantially non-polar uncharged molecules. While this force occurs hi non-polar molecules, the force arises from the movement of electrons within the molecule. Because of the rapidity of motion within the electron cloud, the non-polar molecule attains a small but meaningful instantaneous charge as electron movement causes a temporary change in the polarization of the molecule. These minor fluctuations in charge result in the dispersion portion of the van der Waals1 force.<br>
Such VDW forces, because of the nature of the dipole or the fluctuating polarization of the molecule, tend to be low in bond strength, typically 50 kJ mol'1 or less. Further, the range at which the force becomes attractive is also substantially greater than ionic or covalent bonding and tends to be about 1.5-10 A.<br>
In the van der Waals composite materials of mis invention, we have found that the unique combination of metal particles, the varying particle size of the metal component, the interfacially modification of the interaction between the particulate and the polymer, result in me creation of a unique van der Waals' bonding. Thevan der Waals' forces arise between metal atoms/crystals in the particulate and are created by the combination of particle size, polymer and interfacial modifiers hi the metal/polymer composite. In me past, materials that are characterized as "composite" have merely comprised a polymer filled with particulate with little or no van der Waals' interaction between the particulate filler material. In the invention, the interaction between the selection of particle size, distribution, and polymer, and optional interfacial modifier enables the particulate to achieve an intermolecular distance that creates a substantial van der Waals' bond strength. The prior art materials having little viscoelastic properties, do not achieve a true composite structure. This leads us to conclude that this intermolecular distance is not attained in the prior art In the discussion above, the term "molecule" can be used to relate to a particle of metal, a particle comprising metal crystal or an amorphous metal aggregate, other molecular or atomic units or sub-units of metal or<br>
metal mixtures. In the composites of the invention, the van der Waals' forces occur between collections of metal atoms that act as "molecules" in the form of crystals or other metal atom aggregates.<br>
The composite of the invention is characterized by a composite having intermolecular forces between metal particulates that are in the range of van der Waals1 strength, i.e., between about 5 and about 30 kJ-mol"1 and a bond dimension of 3-10 A.  The metal particulate in the composite of the invention has a range of particle sizes such that about at least 5 wt-% of particulate in the range of about 10 to 70 microns and about at least 5 wt-% of particulate in the range of about 70 to 250 microns, and a polymer, the composite having a van der Waals' dispersion bond strength between molecules in adjacent particles of less than about 4 kJ-mol"1 and a bond dimension of 1.4 to 1.9 A or less than about 2 kJ-mol"1 and the van der Waals' bond dimension is about 1.5 to 1.8 A.<br>
Most composites have two constituent materials: a binder or matrix, and reinforcement The reinforcement is usually much stronger and stiffer than the<br>
t<br>
matrix, and gives the composite its good properties. The matrix holds the reinforcements in an orderly high density pao^nL Because the reinforcements may be discontinuous, the matrix may also help to transfer load among the reinforcements.   Processing «^i aids in the mfring and filling of the reinforcement metal To akl m oie mixtni^ an inter£acial modifier can help to overcome me forces mat prevent the matrix from fonning a substantially continuous phase of the composite. Composites canbe made with certain polymers with tittle or no modifier. The composite properties arise from the intimate association obtained by use of careful processing and manufacture. An interfacial modifier is an organic material that provides an exterior coating on the particulate promoting the close association of polymer and particulate. The modifier is used in an amount of about 0.005 to 3 wt% or about 0.02 to 2 wt-%.<br>
For the purpose of this disclosure, the term "metal" relates to metal in an oxidation state, approximately 0, with up to 25 wt-% or about 0.001 to 10 wt-% as an oxide or a metal or non-metal contaminant, not in association with ionic, covalent or chelating (complexing) agents.  For the purpose of this disclosure, the term "particulate" typically refers to a material made into a product having a particle size greater than 10 microns (a particle size greater man about 10 microns means that a<br>
small portion of the particulate is less than 10 microns, in fact, less than 10 wt-% of me particulate and often less than 5 wt-% of the particulate is less than 10 microns. A particulate is chosen containing at least some particulate in the size range of 10 to 100 microns and 100 to 4000 microns. In a packed state, this particulate has an excluded volume of about 13 to 60%. In this invention, the particulate sources, can comprise two three or more particulates, in a blend of metals of differing chemical and physical nature.<br>
Typically, the composite materials of the invention are manufactured using melt extrusion processing (compression and injection molding can also be used) and are also utilized in product formation using melt processing. Typically, in the manufacturing of the high density materials of the invention, a finely divided metal material of correctly selected particle size and size distribution is combined under conditions of heat and temperature with a typically thermoplastic polymer material, are processed until the material attains a maximum density. The density can be at least 4 gm-cnf 3, greater than 7 gm-cm"3, greater man 11 gm-cm"3, preferably greater than 13 gm-cm*3, more preferably greater than 16 gm-cm"3 with improved mechanical, electrical, magnetic or catalytic properties indicating true composite formation. These materials and combination of materials can be used as solid state electrochemical (e.g. battery) and semiconductor structures. Alternatively, in the manufacture of die material, the metal or the thermoplastic polymer can be blended with a interfacially modifying (interfacial modifier) agents and the modified materials can then be melt processed into the material. The interfacial modifier can make the surface of the particulate more compatible with the polymer. Once the material attains a sufficient density and other properties, the material can be extruded directly into a final product or into a pellet, chip, wafer or other easily processed production raw material. The final product or intermediate chip or pellet can be made extrusion-processing techniques. In the manufacture of useful products with the composites of the invention, the manufactured composite can be obtained in appropriate amounts, subjected to heat and pressure, typically in extruder equipment and then either injection "molded, compression molded or extruded into an appropriate useful shape having the correct amount of materials in the appropriate physical configuration. In the appropriate product design, during composite manufacture or during product manufacture, a pigment or other dye material can be<br>
added to the processing equipment. One advantage of this material is that an inorganic dye or pigment can be co-processed resulting in a material that needs no exterior painting or coating to obtain an attractive or decorative appearance. The pigments can be included in the polymer blend, can be uniformly distributed throughout the material and can result in a surface that cannot chip, scar or lose its decorative appearance. One useful pigment material comprises titanium dioxide (TiOj). This material is extremely non-toxic, is a bright white, finely divided metallic particulate that can be easily combined with either metal particulates and/or polymer composites to enhance the density of the composite material and to provide a white hue to the ultimate composite material<br>
We have further found that a bimetallic blend or a blend of three or more metal particulates can, obtain important composite properties from the blended metals in a polymer composite structure. For example, a tungsten composite or other high density metal can be blended with a second metal that provides to the relatively stable, non-toxic tungsten material, additional properties including a low degree of radiation in the form of alpha, beta or gamma particles, a low degree of desired cytotoxkaty, a change in appearance or other beneficial properties. One advantage of a bimetallic composite is obtained by careful selection of proportions resulting m a taUored density for a particular end use. For example, a copper/tungsten composite can be produced having a theoretical density, for example, with a fluoropolymer or fluorocarbon that can range from 7 gm-cm through 11.4 gm-cm*3. For example, a tantalum/tungsten composite can be produced having a theoretical density, for example, with a fluoropolymer or that can range from 11 gm-cm'3 through 122 gm-cm*3. Alternatively, for other applications, an iridium/tungsten composite can be manufactured that, with a fluoropolymer or fluoropolymer elastomer, can have a density mat ranges from about 12 gm-cm*3 to about 13.2 gm-cm*3. Such composites each can have unique or special properties. The extrudable material having high density that can be extruded into useful shapes include a material having a composite density of about 4 to 17 gm-cm*3, preferably about 6 to 16 gm-cm*3, at an extruded shear rate, in common processing equipment mat ranges from about 10 sec"1 to about 500 sec"1, preferably about 10 to about 250 sec"1 at a temperature of greater than about 100°C or about 150 to 180°C.  The storage modulus of the composite (G1) ranges from about 1200 to about 14,000 MPa,<br>
preferably from about 3000 to about 7000 MPa and a tensile modulus of at least 70 MPa. One important characteristic of the extrudable material of the invention relates to the existence of an elastic-plastic deformation and its Poisson ratio. The extruded materials of the invention display an elastic plastic deformation. Under a stress that causes the extrudate to elongate, the structure deforms in an elastic mode until it reaches a limit after which it deforms in a plastic mode until it reaches its limit and fails structurally. This property is shown as the elongation at break in which the material elongates under stress by at least 10% before reaching a limit and breaking under continued stress. The preferred material has a Poisson ratio typically greater than 0.3 and preferably about 0.35 to about 0.65. Such a Poisson ratio indicates that it can be extruded with little elastic relaxation during processing.<br>

Single metal and mixed metal composites can be tailored for novel properties including density, color, magnetism, thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity and other physical properties. The use of compositions further<br>
comprising an interfacial modifier demonstrates improved utilization of material properties and improved performance. Preferred composites can be combined with one or more polymers of a given molecular weight distribution and one or more metal particulates with a given distribution to obtain unique composites. The invention relates to a family of composite materials having composite characteristics that exceed the density and greatly improves viscoelastic properties of prior art metal composites. The materials can be used in applications requiring high-density properties, viscoelastic character, malleability, ductility, formability and extrusion molding properties. The invention specifically provides high-density materials comprising a high-density metal participate or particulate blends, a polymer phase and when needed, an interfacial modifier that permits the polymer and metal particulate to interact to form a composite with desired nature and degree of properties and to attain the maximum density possible. Such materials obtain physical properties in excess of prior art materials including density, storage modulus color, magnetism, thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity and other physical property improvements without toxicity or residual radiation characteristic of lead or depleted uranium, respectively unless needed in a specific application. The materials of the invention permits the design engineer the flexibility to tailor the composite to end uses and avoid the use of toxic or radioactive materials unless desired. Lead or depleted uranium are no longer needed in their typical applications.<br>
The composite materials of the invention combine a metal particulate at a maximum tap density leaving a excluded volume and a polymer material substantially occupying the excluded volume, but no more to obtain the highest possible density from the composite composition. Tap density (ASTM B527-93) relates to how well the material is packed. Packing affects the excluded volume and a volume component that is included in the density calculation. The particle size and size distribution of the particulate appears to be important in attaining the highest density composite materials of the invention. We have found that the minimum useful particle size of the particulate is about 10 microns. Below 10 microns, the processability of the material as a homogeneous mixture is reduced and prevents close association between the metal particulate and the polymer. Further, the small particle size tends to promote the incorporation of voids within the composite. Particulate or blends greater than 10 microns in size appears to be useful<br>
in attaining close association between the metal particulate and the polymeric material. We have also found that it is important to include a broad range of particulate. The metal particulate contain at least an effective amount of at least one particulate having a particle size greater than 10 microns (less than 10 wt.-% often less than 5 wt.-% of the particulate is less than 10 microns). The size distribution should include a broad range. This set of broad distributions yield a material that will pack and be readily processable. This particulate distribution should contain at least some particulate (at least 5 wt.-%) in the range of about 10 to 70 microns, the particulate distribution should also contain at least some particulate (at least 5 wt-%) in the range of about 70 to 250 microns, optionally the particulate can contain some particulate (at least 5 wt-%) in the range of about 250 to 500 microns and can contain some particulate in the 500+ micron range.  We have found that this varied size distribution promotes close packing of the particulate, reduction in the exclusion volume hi the polymer and improved particle polymer compatibility. We have found that this distribution of particles having a selected size distribution and an ultimate size greater than 10 microns greatly improves packing density, interfacial modification and ultimate composite formation. This distribution can be normal, Gaussian, tog normal or skew normal but must include the desired range of particle sizes. A true composite is obtained by carefully processing the combined polymer and polymer particulate until properties are developed and density reaches a level showing that using an interfacial modifier promotes composite formation fills the excluded volume results in enhanced property development and high density.<br>
The regular, essentially spherical, character of the preferred particles of the invention can be defined by the roughness or roundness of the particle and by its aspect ratio. The aspect ratio of the particles should be less than 1 :1.5 and should reflect a substantially circular cross section or spherical particle. The circularity, roundness or roughness of the particle can be measured by a microscopic inspection of the particles<br>
in which an automated or manual measurement of roughness can be calculated. In such a measurement, the perimeter of a representative selection of the particulate is selected and the area of the particle cross section is also measured. The circularity of the particle is calculated by the following formula: Circularity = (perimeter)2 /area.<br>
An ideal spherical particle has a roundness characteristic of about 12.6. This roundness characteristic is unitless parameter of less than about 20, often about 13 to 1 8.   Metal and finely divided metal compositions that can be used in the composites of the invention include, but are not limited to, titanium, chromium, iron, nickel, molybdenum, tin tungsten, cobalt, copper, zinc, cadmium, bismuth, uranium, osmium, indium, platinum, rhenium, gold, neptunium, plutonium and tantalum. An advantage is that non-toxic or non-radioactive materials can be used as a substitute for lead and depleted uranium where needed. Another advantage of the invention is the ability to create bimetallic or higher composites that use two or more metal materials that cannot naturally form an alloy. A variety of properties can be tailored through a careful selection of metal or a combination of metals and polymer and the toxicity or radioactivity of the materials can be designed into the materials as desired.<br>
We have further found that a blend of two, three or more metals in particulate form can, obtain important composite properties from both metals in a polymer composite structure. For example, a tungsten composite or other high density metal particulate can be blended with a second metal particulate mat provides to the relatively stable, non-toxic tungsten material, additional properties including a tow degree of radiation in the form of alpha, beta or gamma particles, a low degree of desired cytotoxicity, a change in appearance or other beneficial properties. One advantage of a bimetallic composite is obtained by careful selection of proportions resulting in a tailored density for a particular end use. For example, a tantalum/tungsten composite can be produced having a theoretical density, for example, with a fluoropolymer or fluoropolymer elastomer that can range from 1 1 gm-cm"3 through 12.2 gm-cm"3. Alternatively, for other applications, a indium tungsten composite can be manufactured that, with a fluoropolymer or fluoropolymer elastomer, can have a density that ranges from about 12 gm-cm*3 to about 13.2 gm-cm*3. Such composites each can have unique or special properties. These composite processes and materials have the unique capacity and property that the composite acts as an alloy composite of two different metals that could not, due to melting point and other processing difficulties, be made into an alloy form without the methods of the invention.<br>
The extrudable composite materials of the invention combine a finely divided metal or metal particulate at a maximum packing density leaving an excluded volume and a polymer material substantially occupying the excluded volume, but no more to obtain the highest possible density from the composite composition. The composite can contain about 50 to 96 or about 80 to 96 vol.-% metal particulate. A variety of metal particulates in the correct size and distribution can be used with density greater than 4, greater than 8, greater than 10 or greater than 13 gm-cm~3. The important parameters of the metal particulate material include the fact mat no more than 5 wt.-% of the metal particulate is less than 10 microns in diameter. Further, this distribution can be described by Table A, the metal particle having a substantial proportion of particulate falling in the range of 10 to 50 microns, a substantial proportion of a particulate falling in the range of 50 to 350 microns and a substantial proportion of a particulate falling in the range of 350 to' 2400 microns. By a substantial proportion, we mean at least 10 wt-% of the particulate. A more preferred particulate range is as follows: 10 wt-% 10 to 50 microns, 15 wt-% 50 to 350 microns, 75 wt-% 350 to 2400 microns The most preferred particulate range is as follows: 5 wt-% 10 to 70 microns, 10 wt-% 70 to 90 microns, 15 wt-% 90 to 500 microns, 70 wt-% 500 to 4000 microns. A number of metal particles can be used in the compositions of the invention.<br>

A large variety of polymer materials can be used in the composite materials of the invention. For the purpose of this disclosure, a polymer is a general term covering either a thermoset or a thermoplastic. We have found mat polymer materials useful in the invention include born condensation polymeric materials and vinyl polymeric materials. Included are both vinyl and condensation polymer blends, and polymeric alloys thereof. Vinyl polymers are typically manufactured by the polymerization of monomers having an emytorically unsaturated olefmic group. Condensation polymers are typically prepared by a condensation polymerization reaction which is typically considered to be a stepwise chemical reaction in which two or more molecules combined, often but not necessarily accompanied by the separation of water or some other simple, typically volatile substance. Such polymers can be formed in a process called polycondensation. The polymer has a density of at least 0.94 gm-cm"3, however, polymers having a density of 0.96 to 2 gm-cm"3 and preferably greater than 0.98 to 1.9 gm-cm"3 are useful to increase density, Preferred polymers can have a useful high density typically greater man 1 gm-cm*3 often greater man 1.5 gm-cm"3 and also greater than 1.7 gm-cm"3.<br>
Vinyl polymers include polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutylene, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), polybutylene copolymers, polyacetyl polymers, polyacrylic polymers, homopolymers or copolymers comprising vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, fhiorocarbon copolymers, etc. Condensation polymers include nylon, phenoxy polymers, polyarylether such as polyphenylether, polyphenylsulfide materials; polycarbonate materials, chlorinated polyether polymers, polyemersulfone polymers, polyphenylene oxide polymers, poiysulfone<br>
polymers, polyimkle polymers., thennoplastic urethane elastomers, polyester (i.e. polyethylene terephthalate) and many other polymer materials.<br>
Condensation polymers that can be used in the composite materials of the invention include polyamides, polyarnide-imide polymers, polyarylsulfones, polycarbonate, polybutylene terephthalate, polybutylene naphthalate, polyetherimides, polyethersulfones, polyethylene terephthalate, thennoplastic polyimides, polyphenylene ether blends, polyphenylene sulfide, polysulfones, thennoplastic polyurethanes and others. Preferred condensation engineering polymers include polycarbonate materials, polyphenyleneoxide materials, and polyester materials including polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate and polybutylene naphthalate materials.<br>
Polycarbonate engineering polymers are high performance, amorphous engineering thermoplastics having high impact strength, clarity, heat resistance and dimensional stability. Polycarbonates are generally classified as a polyester or carbonic acid with organic hydroxy compounds. The most common polycarbonates are based on phenol A as a hydroxy compound copolymerized with carbonic acid. Materials are often made by the reaction of a bisphenol A with phosgene (OCCh). PolycarboiiatescanbemadewimphmalatenKm^<br>
polymerization extruder to improve properties such as heat resistance, further trifunctional materials can also be used to increase melt strength or extrusion biow molded materials. Polycarbonates can often be used as a versatile blending material as a component with other commercial polymers in the manufacture of alloys. Polycarbonates can be combined with polyethylene terephthalate acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene polymers, styrene maleic anhydride polymers and others. Preferred alloys comprise a styrene copolymer and a polycarbonate. Preferred melt for the polycarbonate materials should be indices between 0.5 and 30, preferably between 1 and 20 gms/10 mm.<br>
A variety of polyester condensation polymer materials including polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, polybutylene naphthalate, etc. can be useful in the composites of the invention. Polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate are high performance condensation polymer materials. Such polymers often made by a copolymerization between a diol (ethylene glycol, 1,4-butane diol) with dimethyl terephthalate. In the<br>
polymerization of the material, the polymerization mixture is heated to high temperature resulting in the transesterification reaction releasing methanol and resulting in the formation of the engineering plastic. Similarly, polyethylene naphthalate and polybutylene naphthalate materials can be made by copolymerizing as above using as an acid source, a naphthalene dicarboxylic acid. The naphthalate thermoplastics have a higher Tg and higher stability at high temperature compared to the terephthalate materials. However, all these polyester materials are useful in the composite materials of the invention. Such materials have a preferred molecular weight characterized by melt flow properties. Useful polyester materials have a viscosity at 265°C of about 500-2000 cP, preferably about 800-1300 cP.<br>
Polyphenylene oxide materials are engineering thermoplastics that are useful at temperature ranges as high as 330°C. Polyphenylene oxide has excellent mechanical properties, dimensional stability, and dielectric characteristics. Commonly, phenylene oxides are manufactured and sold as polymer alloys or blends when combined with other polymers or fiber. Polyphenylene oxide typically comprises a homopolymer of 2,6-dimemyl-l-phenoL The polymer commonly known as poly(oxy-{2,6-dimethyl-l,4-pheaylene)). Polyphenylene is often used as<br>
v<br>
an alloy or blend with a poryamide, typically nylon 6-6, alloys with polystyrene or high impact styrene and others. A preferred melt index (ASTM 1238) for the polyphenylene oxide material useful in the invention typically ranges from about 1 to 20, preferably about 5 to 10 gtn/10 min. The melt viscosity is about 1000 at 265°C.<br>
Another class of thermoplastic include styrenic copolymers. The term styrenic copolymer indicates mat styrene is copolymerized with a second vinyl monomer resulting in a vinyl polymer. Such materials contain at least a 5 mol-% styrene and the balance being 1 or more other vinyl monomers. An important class of these materials are styrene acrylonitrile (SAN) polymers. SAN polymers are random amorphous linear copolymers produced by copolymerizing styrene acrylonitrile and optionally other monomers. Emulsion, suspension and continuous mass polymerization techniques have been used. SAN copolymers possess transparency, excellent thermal properties, good chemical resistance and hardness. These polymers are also characterized by their rigidity, dimensional stability and load bearing capability. Olefin modified SANTs (OSA polymer materials) and<br>
acrylic styroMJ acrylonitriles (ASA polymer materials) are known. These materials are somewhat softer than unmodified BAN'S and are ductile, opaque, two phased terpolymers that have surprisingly unproved weatherability.<br>
ASA polymers are random amorphous terpolymers produced either by mass copolymerization or by graft copolymerization. In mass copolymerization, an acrylic monomer styrene and acrylonitrile are combined to form a heteric terpolymer. In an alternative preparation technique, styrene acrylonitrile oligomers and monomers can be grafted to an acrylic elastomer backbone. Such materials are characterized as outdoor weatherable and UV resistant products that provide excellent accommodation of color stability property retention and property stability with exterior exposure. These materials can also be blended or alloyed with a variety of other polymers including polyvinyl chloride, polycarbonate, polymethyl methacrylate and others. An important class of styrene copolymers includes the acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene monomers. These polymers are very versatile family of engineering thermoplastics produced by copolymerizing the three monomers. Each monomer provides an important property to Ihe final terpolymer niaterial. The final niaterial has excellent heat resistance, chemical resistance and surface hardness combmed wim processabitity, rigidity and strength. The polymers are also tough and impact resistant The styrene coporymer family of polymers have a melt index mat ranges from about 0.5 to 25, preferably about 0.5 to 20.<br>
An important class of engineering polymers that can be used in the composites of the invention include acrylic polymers. Acrylics comprise a broad array of polymers and copolymers in which the major monomeric constituents are an ester acrylate or methacrylate. These polymers are often provided in the form of hard, clear sheet or pellets. Acrylic monomers polymerized by free radical processes initiated by typically peroxides, azo compounds or radiant energy. Commercial polymer formulations are often provided in which a variety of additives are modifiers used during the polymerization provide a specific set of properties for certain applications. Pellets made for polymer grade applications are typically made either in bulk (continuous solution polymerization), followed by extrusion and pelleting or continuously by polymerization in an extruder in which unconverted monomer is removed under reduced pressure and recovered for recycling. Acrylic plastics are commonly made by using methyl acrylate, methyhnethacrylate, higher<br>
alkyl acrylates and other copolymerizable vinyl monomers. Preferred acrylic polymer materials useful in the composites of me invention has a melt index of about 0.5 to SO, preferably about 1 to 30 gm/10 min.<br>
The primary requirement for the substantially thermoplastic engineering polymer material is mat it retains sufficient thermoplastic properties such as viscosity and stability, to permit melt blending with a metal particulate, permit formation of linear extrudate pellets, and to permit the composition material or pellet to be extruded or injection molded hi a thermoplastic process forming the useful product. Engineering polymer and polymer alloys are available from a number of manufacturers including B.F. Goodrich, General Electric, Dow, and E. I. duPont.<br>
Vinyl polymers include a acrylonitrile; polymer of alpha-olefins such as ethylene, propylene, etc.; chlorinated monomers such as vinyl chloride, vinylidene dichloride, acrylate monomers such as acrylic acid, methyiacrylate, methyhnethacrylate, acrylamide, hydroxyethyl acrylate, and others; styrenic monomers such as styrene, alphamethyl styrene, vinyl toluene, etc.; vinyl acetate; and other commonly available ethyieoically unsaturated monomer compositions.<br>
Polymer blends or polymer alloys can be useful in manufacturing the pellet or linear extrudate of me invention. Such alloys typically comprise two miscible polymers blended to form a uniform composition. Scientific and commercial progress in the area of polymer blends has lead to the realization mat important physical property improvements can be made not by developing new polymer material but by forming miscible polymer blends or alloys. A polymer alloy at equilibrium comprises a mixture of two amorphous polymers existing as a single phase of intimately mixed segments of the two macro molecular components. Miscible amorphous polymers form glasses upon sufficient cooling and a homogeneous or miscible polymer blend may exhibit a single, composition dependent glass transition temperature (Tg). Immiscible or non-alloyed blend of polymers typically displays two or more glass transition temperatures associated with immiscible polymer phases. La the simplest cases, the properties of polymer alloys reflect a composition weighted average of properties possessed by the components. In general, however, the property dependence on composition varies in a complex way with a particular property, the nature of the components (glassy,<br>
rubbery or semi-crystalline), the thermodynamic state of the blend, and its mechanical state whether molecules and phases are oriented.<br>
Polyester polymers are manufactured by the reaction of a dibasic acid with a glycol. Dibasic acids used in polyester production include phthalic anhydride, isophthalic acid, maleic acid and adipic acid. The phthalic acid provides stiffness, hardness and temperature resistance; maleic acid provides vinyl saturation to accommodate free radical cure; and adipic acid provides flexibility and ductility to the cured polymer. Commonly used glycols are propylene glycol which reduces crystalline tendencies and improves solubility in styrene. Ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol reduce crystallization tendencies. The diacids and glycols are condensed eliminating water and are then dissolved hi a vinyl monomer to a suitable viscosity. Vinyl monomers include styrene, vinyltoluene, paramethylstyrene, methylmethacrylate, and diallyl phthalate. The addition of a polymerization initiator, such as hydroquinone, tertiary butylcatechol or phenothiazine extends the shelf life of the uncured polyester polymer. Polymers based on phthalic anhydride are termed orthophthalic polyesters and polymers based on isophthalic acid are termed isophthalic polyesters. The viscosity of the unsaturated polyester polymer can be tailored to an application. Low viscosity is important in the fabrication of fiber-reinforced composites to ensure good wetting and subsequent high adhesion of the reinforcing layer to the underlying substrate. Poor wetting can result hi large losses of mechanical properties. Typically, polyesters are manufactured with a styrene concentration or other monomer concentration producing polymer having an uncured viscosity of 200-1,000 mPa.s(cP). Specialty polymers may have a viscosity that ranges from about 20 cP to 2,000 cP. Unsaturated polyester polymers are typically cured by free radical initiators commonly produced using peroxide materials. Wide varieties of peroxide initiators are available and are commonly used. The peroxide initiators thermally decompose forming free radical initiating species.<br>
Phenolic polymers can also be used in the manufacture of the structural members of the invention. Phenolic polymers typically comprise a phenol-formaldehyde polymer. Such polymers are inherently fire resistant, heat resistant and are low hi cost. Phenolic polymers are typically formulated by blending phenol and less than a stoichiometric amount of formaldehyde. These materials are<br><br>
condensed with an acid catalyst resulting in a thermoplastic intermediate polymer called NOVOLAK. These polymers are oligomeric species terminated by phenolic groups. In the presence of a curing agent and optional heat, the oligomeric species cure to form a very high molecular weight thermoset polymer. Curing agents for novalaks are typically aldehyde compounds or methylene (-CHb-) donors. Aldehydic curing agents include paraformaldehyde, hexamethylenetetraamine, formaldehyde, propionaldehyde, glyoxal and hexamethyhnethoxy melamine.<br>

Dispersions of fluoropolymers can be prepared using conventional emulsion polymerization techniques, such as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,418,186; 5,214,106; 5,639,838; 5,696,216 or Modem Fluoropolymers, Edited by John Scheirs, 1997 (particularly pp. 71-101 and 597-614) as well as assignees' copending patent application Serial No. 01/03195, filed January 31,2001.<br>
The liquid forms can be further diluted in order to deliver the desired concentration. Although aqueous emulsions, solutions, and dispersions are preferred, up to about 50% of a cosohrcnt such as methanol, isopropanol, or methyl perfluorobutyl ether may be added. Preferably, the aqueous emulsions, solutions, and dispersions comprise less than about 30% cosolvent, more preferably less than about 10% cosolvent, and most preferably the aqueous emulsions, solutions, and dispersions are substantially free of cosolvent<br>
The metal particulate can be coupled to the polymer phase depending on the nature of the polymer phase, the filler, the particulate surface chemistry and any pigment process aid or additive present in the composite material. In general the mechanism used to couple metal particulate to polymer include interfacial modification, solvation, chelation, coordination bonding (ligand formation), etc.<br>
Interfacial modifiers used in the composite fall into broad categories including, for example, stearic acid and derivatives, silane compounds, titanate compounds, zirconate compounds, aluminate compounds. The choice of interfacial modifiers is dictated by metal particulate, polymer, and application. The maximum<br>
density of a composite is a function of the densities of the materials and the volume fractions of each. Higher density composites are achieved by maximizing the per unit volume of the materials with the highest densities. Interfacial modifying chemistries are capable of modifying the surface of the particulate by coordination bonding, Van der Waals forces, covalent bonding, or a combination of all three. The surface of the particle behaves as a particle of the non-reacted end of the interfacial modifier. These organics reduce the friction between particles preventing gouging and allowing for greater freedom of movement between particles. These phenomena allow the applied shaping force to reach deeper into the form resulting in a more uniform pressure gradient This achieves closer packing (note highest Van der Waals occurs at 5 Angstrom or less) in the bulk and higher physical properties. The use of a sufficient amount of the interfacial modifier that is sufficient to modify the surface characteristic of the metal but not displace polymer is an important compounding characteristic.<br>
Stearic acid and derivatives or compounds thereof, modify the composites of the invention, stearic acid performs a interfacial modifying function to result in the formation of a stearic layer on the surface of the metal particle reducing the intermolecular forces, improving the tendency of the polymer to wet me particulate particle, and resulting in increased composite density.<br>
Similarly, silane interfacial modifiers improve physical properties of the composites by forming chemical bonds between the metal particle and the continuous polymer phase, or by modifying the surface energy of the inorganic metal particulate matching the surface energy of the polymer at the particle polymer interface. Silane coupling agents useful in the invention include but are not limited to compounds of the following structure:<br>
R-CCH2)n-Si-X3<br>
wherein X represents a hydrolyzable group comprising alkoxy-, acyloxy-, halo- or amino- depending on the surface chemistry of the metal particulate and the reaction mechanism. Coupling is maximized as the number of chemical bonds between the particulate surface and polymer is maximized. When a composite will be used in an application including large amounts of aqueous media and broad temperature<br>
excursions, dipodal silanes such as bis(triethoxysilyl) ethane are chosen. These materials have the following structure:<br>
R[(CH2VSi-X3]2<br>
wherein R represents the non-hydrolyzable organic group of the silane compound. The R group may be chemically bonded to the polymer phase or as desired to remain unreactive if non-bonded interfacial modifier can be applied. When R is chemically bonded to the polymer phase, the reaction proceeds through the addition of free radicals to the polymer. These free radicals can be added either through heat, light or in the form of peroxide catalysts or promoters and similar reactive systems. Selection of the R group additionally is made through a consideration of polymer used in the composite. Thennosetting polymers can be used to chemically bond the silane to the polymer phase if a thermoset polymer is selected. The reactive groups in the thermoset can include methacrylyl, styryl, or other unsaturated or organic materials. Thermoplastic materials wim reactive sites can be used to increase the reactivity between die polymer phase and me metal particulate. Such thermoplastics having reactive sites in either the backbone or groups pendant to the polymer backbone include polyvinykhloride, polyphenyienc sulfite, acrylic homopolymers, maleic anhydride containing polymers, acrylic materials, vinyl acetate polymers, diene containing copolymere such as 1,3-butadiene, 1,4-pentadiene, halogen or chlorosulfonyl modified polymers or other polymers mat can react with the composite systems of the invention. Condensation polymeric thermoplastics can be used including polyamides, polyesters, polycarbonates, fmoropolymers, polysulfones and similar polymer materials by reacting end groups with silanes having aminoalkyl, chloroalkyl, isocyanato or similar functional groups. Polyolefin materials including polyethylene and polypropylene can be coupled to the metal particulate using silanes such as alkyl silanes or amino silanes having a substantial aliphatic substituent. Chemical bonding to polyethylene can be achieved using a vinyl silane and reacting the metal particulate with the vinyl silane followed by compounding the modified metal particulate with the polymer phase in the presence of a peroxide catalyst or promoter such as dicumyl peroxide or bis(t-butylperoxy) materials. Chemical bonding to polypropylene or a polyethylene can be achieved<br>
when the reactive materials of sulfbnyl azide compound. The filler is reacted with a silylsosulfonylazide and then combined with the polymer at an elevated temperature.<br>
The polymer material preferably has a polarity that is matches the interfacial modifier. The interfacial modifier material is selected such that it is a material that associates with the metal particle surface and presents a surface that is compatible with the polymer filling the excluded volume.<br>
The metal particulate can be coupled to the polymer phase depending on the nature of me polymer phase, the filler, the particulate surface chemistry and any pigment process aid or additive present in the composite material. In general the mechanism used to couple metal particulate to polymer include solvation, chelation, coordination bonding (ligand formation), etc.<br>
Titanate or zirconate coupling agents can be used. Such agents have the following formula:<br>
wherein titanate chemistries provide superior bonds to transition metals and the lanthanide series. Titanates provide antioxidant properties and can modify or control cure chemistry. Zirconate provides excellent bond strength but maximizes curing, reduces formation of off color in formulated thermoplastic materials. A useful zirconate material is neopentyl(diallyl)oxy-tri(dioctyl)phosphato-zirconate.<br>
The manufacture of the high density metal particulate composite materials depends on good manufacturing technique. Often the metal particulate is initially treated with an interfacial modifier such as a reactive silane by spraying a 25 wt-% solution of the silane or interfacial modifier on the particulate with blending and drying carefully to ensure uniform particulate coating of the interfacial modifier. Interfacial modifiers such as a silane may also be added to fillers in bulk blending operations using high intensity Littleford or Henschel blenders. Alternatively, twin screw conical mixers can be followed by drying or direct addition to a screw-compounding device. Interfacial modifier may also be reacted with the metal<br>
particulate in aprotic solvent such as toluene, tetrahydrofuran, mineral spirits or other such known solvents.<br>
The metal polymer composites of the invention can be used in a variety of embodiments including projectiles, high density sheeting with attachment means such as adherent coatings, fishing lures, fishing weights, automobile weights, vehicle tire wheel weights with attachment clips, radiation shielding, golf club components, sporting equipment, gyroscopic ballast, cellular phone vibrating weights or laboratory weight noise and vibration barriers, or other embodiments that require high density material with moldability, ductility, and dimensional stability.<br>
The high density materials of the present invention and all its embodiments are suitable for numerous processing methods. Selection of processing methods and formulation of base materials can be based upon required end use product requirements. The following examples illustrate this point.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention is a flexible or malleable composite that could be used in projectiles including shot gun pellets and other ammunition, stints for heart or artery applications, or radiation shielding garments. An example composite with these characteristics might include a combination of tungsten, a fluoropolymer as the binder, and a zirconate interfacial modifier. The end use product could be the result of an extrusion or injection molded part<br>
Yet another embodiment of the present invention is a high output production, high density composite that could be used in fishing lures or weights, or cellular phone shielding or internal vibratory mechanisms. An example composite with these characteristics might include a combination of tungsten, polyvinyl chloride as the binder, and an alkaline metal stearate or a stearate amide interfacial modifier. The end use product could be the result of an extrusion or injection molded part<br>
Yet another embodiment of the present invention is a low output production, high cure time, and high density composite that could be used in automobile or truck pneumatic tire wheel weights or other ballasts, or other products that could be produced in bulk forms. An example composite with these characteristics might include a combination of tungsten, polyester as the binder, and a zirconate interfacial modifier. The end use product could be the result of injection molding, or bulk molding parts.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the present invention is a high output production, high density composite mat could be used for fishing lures and automobile or truck pneumatic tire wheel weights. An example composite with these characteristics might include a combination of tungsten, polystyrene as a binder and a zirconate interracial modifier. The end use product could be the result of injection molding, or bulk molding parts.<br>
In addition to the aforementioned illustrative embodiments, additional processing methods are, but not limited to; Injection, compression molding, thermoset and thermoplastic extrusion, centrifugal molding, rotational molding, blow molding, casting, calendaring, liquid fill thermoset molding or filament winding to form a variety of shapes in conjunction with sequential compounding.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the invention includes colorization of the resulting composites where color is important for identification or as dictated by the end use requirements. Color additives are typically less than 1% of the resulting composite by weight and volume fraction.<br>
m the manufacture of the composite of the invention, the metal polymer particle size and shape distribution must be selected to obtain packing characteristics, combined with the appropriate polymer and then extruded at appropriate conditions. During the blending step, me metal particulate and the polymer are intimately mixed. The interracial modifier is commonly added to the blended material or can be added to the metal particulate before combining the modified metal with the polymeric material. As discussed above, many of the fluorocarbon materials require no interfacial modification and are compatible with the metal particulates. Solvent blending can be used to introduce the polymer and metal particulate if necessary.<br>
The blended composite material can then be extruded under conditions of shear, temperature and time to obtain maximized density and other composite polymeric characteristics. The preferred equipment for mixing and extruding the composition is an industrial extruder device such as those obtainable from Brabender or Cincinnati Millicron. Once the materials are mixed under appropriate conditions of shear, temperature and time, the properties of the composite are<br>
maximized in density, storage modulus, etc. The resulting polymer material can be extruded in the form of a pellet, chip or other raw material for further processing or can be extruded into a finally useful shape. In a preferred mode, the metal particulate, preferably containing a interfacial modifying material, is placed in a volumetric hopper to proportion the particulate into the extruder. The polymer material is similarly input into the system. The amounts of particulate and polymer are gauged to ensure the composite material contains the appropriate proportions on a weight or preferably volumetric basis. Commonly, the material is blended on input and introduced into an extrusion device, preferably a single or twin screw extruder. Such a device typically has a mixing section, a transport section and a melt section. Bach section has a desired heat profile resulting in appropriate blending and interfacial modification. The following example was performed to illustrate the invention in extruded composite materials. The following information illustrates the typical condition and composite composition.<br>
The high density metal polymer composite materials having the desired physical properties can be manufactured as follows. In a preferred mode, the surface of the metal particulate is initially prepared, the interfacial modifier is reacted with the prepared particle material, and the resulting product is isolated and then combined with the continuous polymer phase to affect a reaction between the metal particulate and the polymer. Once the composite material is prepared, it is then formed into the desired shape of the end use material. Solution processing is an alternative that provides solvent recovery during materials processing. The materials can also be dry-blended without solvent. Blending systems such as ribbon blenders obtained from Drais Systems, high intensity dry blenders available from Littleford Brothers and Henschel are possible. Further melt blending using Banbury, Farrell single screw or twin screw compounders is also useful. When the materials are processed as a plastisol, organosol or latex with solvent, liquid ingredients are generally charged to a processing unit first, followed by polymer, metal particulate and rapid agitation. Once all materials are added a vacuum can be applied to remove residual air and solvent and liquids the mixing is continued until the product is uniform and high in density with good mechanical properties.<br>
Dry blending is useful due to advantages in cost, however certain embodiments can be compositionally unstable due to differences in particle size. In<br>
dry blending processes, the composite can be made by first introducing the polymer, combining the polymer stabilizers, if necessary, at a temperature from about ambient to about 60°C with the polymer, blending a metal particulate (modified if necessary) with the stabilized polymer, blending other process aids, colorants, indicators or lubricants followed by mixing in hot mix transfer to storage, packaging or end use manufacture.<br>
Interfacially modified materials can be made with solvent techniques that use an effective amount of solvent to initiate formation of a composite. When interfacial modification is substantially complete, the solvent can be stripped. Such solvent processes are conducted as follows:<br>
1)	Solvating the interfacial modifier or polymer or both;<br>
2)	Mixing the metal particulate and modifier into a bulk phase or polymer<br>
master batch: and<br>
3)	Devolatilizing the composition in the presence of heat &amp; vacuum above<br>
the Tg of the polymer<br>
When compounding with a single or twin screw compounder or extruders, a process mat can be used involves a twin screw compounding as follows.<br>
1.	Add metal and raise temperature to remove surface water (barrel 1).<br>
2.	Add interfacial modifier to twin screw when metal is at temperature<br>
(barrel 3).<br>
3.	Disperse/distribute interfacial modifier on metal particulate.<br>

11.	Compress resulting composite.<br>

2.	Add interfacial modifier to twin screw when polymer binder is at<br>
temperature.<br>
3.	Disperse/distribute interfacial modifier in polymer binder.<br>
4.	Add metal and disperse/distribute metal.<br>
5	Raise temperature to reaction temperature.<br>
6.	Maintain reaction temperature to completion.<br>
7.	Compress resulting composite.<br>
8.	Form desired shape, pellet, lineal, tube, injection mold article, etc.<br>
through a dye or post-manufacturing step.<br>
Alternatively in formulations for presized materials:<br>
1.	Add polymer.<br>
2.	Raise the temperature of the polymer to a melt state<br>
3.	Add metal particulate which has been pre-treated with the interfacial<br>
modifier and disperse/distribute particulate.<br>
4.	Compress resulting composite.<br>
5.	Form desired shape, pellet, lineal, tube, injection mold article, etc.<br>
through a die or post-manufacturing step.<br>
Certain selections of polymers and particulates may permit the omission of the interfacial modifiers and their related processing steps.<br>
Multiple continuous compounding trials were conducted with the tungsten composite material similar to Example 8. The following section details the parallel, co-rotating, twin-screw compounding technology employed during the trials.<br>
Sequencing of the necessary unit operations must accomplish complete polymer matrix mastification and distribution of the interfacial modifier, prior to the introduction of metal particulate. Once particulate has been introduced, distributive mixing and devolatilization of the matrix occurs. The devolatilization of the interfacial modifier carrier solution removes solvent. Lastly, pressurization of the<br>
*<br>
matrix is limited to driving the degree of fill within the twin-screw to 1.<br>

An embodiment of the present invention is a flexible or malleable composite that could be used in projectiles including shot gun pellets and other ammunition, stents for heart or artery applications, radiation shielding garments, or extruded and coextruded line for multiple applications including string line and fishing line. An example composite with these characteristics might include a combination of tungsten, a fluoropolymer as the binder, and a zirconate interfacial modifier. The end use product could be the result of an extrusion or injection molded part.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the present invention is a high output production, high density composite that could be used in fishing hires or weights with or without the optionally included interfacial modifier, or cellular phone shielding or internal vibratory mechanisms. An example composite with these characteristics might include a combination of tungsten, polyvinyl chloride as the binder, and an alkaline metal stearate or a stearate amide interfacial modifier. The end use product could be the result of an extrusion or injection molded part.<br>

The wheel weight comprises attachment means and an article of mass of the composite of the invention. The weight can be attached with conventional clips or adhered to the wheel with an adhesive. An example composite with these characteristics might include a combination of tungsten, polystyrene as a binder and<br>
a zirconate interfacial modifier. The end use product could be the result of injection molding, or bulk molding parts.<br>
In addition to the aforementioned illustrative embodiments, additional processing methods are, but not limited to; molding, compression molding, thermoset and thermoplastic extrusion, centrifugal molding, rotational molding, blow molding, casting, calendaring, liquid fill thermoset molding or filament winding to form a variety of shapes in conjunction with sequential compounding. Yet another embodiment of the invention includes the magnetic composition of the resulting composites where a magnetic component is added for identification or as dictated by the end use requirements. Magnetic additives are typically 0.1% to 5% of the resulting composite by weight and volume fraction.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the invention includes colorization of the resulting composites where color is important for identification or as dictated by the end use requirements. Color additives are typically less than 1% of the resulting composite by weight and volume fraction.<br>
Composite materials of the invention can be used in a projectile in the form of a shotgun pellet or a shaped round. Shotgun pellets are typically spherical particulates having a dimension of about 0.7 to about 3 millimeters and are generally<br>
spherical, but can have a puckered or dimpled surface.<br>
i<br>
Projectiles useful hi the invention typically comprise a substantial proportion of the high density composite of the invention. The projectile can comprise an extruded rod, in a jacketed or unjacketed form. The jacket can surround the composite or can leave a portion (leading end or following end) exposed. The composite can be manufactured in a variety of modes to form a projectile. The projectile can comprise about 0.1 grams to as much as 2 kilograms of the composite of the invention at least partially surrounded by a metal jacket. Such projectiles can have an tapered open leading end, an open closed end, or both, or can be entirely enclosed by the jacket. Further, the jacket can include other components such as explosives, metal tips, or other inserts to alter the center of aerodynamic pressure or the center of gravity or the center of mass of the projectile forward of or to the rear of the dimensional center. Such projectiles made from composites of the invention comprising tungsten, iron or other non-toxic metal, comprise a "green" bullet or projectile that deteriorates after use into a non-toxic material, compatible with<br>
aquatic plant and animal life. The elastic properties of the material render the projectile particularly useful. The projectile can deliver substantial inertia or kinetic energy to the target due to its high density, but also upon contact, can deform elastically causing the jacket to expand as would be the case in lead projectiles. The jacket will expand as expected, but the elastic material will spring back substantially to its initial dimensions.<br>
The round, or projectile, can be engineered such that me center of aerodynamic pressure and the center of gravity or mass can be adjusted forward of or to the rear of the dimensional center to improve the aerodynamic capability of the round. Such rounds can be made to fly in a more stable trajectory avoiding deviation from the desired trajectory that can reduce accuracy. Further, the materials of the invention can, due to its stability, be fired at a higher firing rate with reduced weapon heating due to a reduced spin rate. In the preferred projectile of the invention, the center of gravity is placed well before the center of aerodynamic pressure and narrowly stabilizing the spinning round in its trajectory to the target.<br>
In summary, the present invention, as dictated by the specific claims contained herein, represents a breadth of raw material combinations including; metals, polymers, interracial modifiers, other additives, all with varying particle sizes, weight fractions, and volume fractions. The present invention also includes a breadth of processing methods, resulting physical and chemical properties, and end-use applications. The following materials exemplify the invention. The materials can all be formed, molded, extruded or otherwise made into useful composites and shapes.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL<br>
Raw Material Table<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Experimental 1<br>
The experiment consisted of three main areas of focus: density, melt flow, tensile strength and elongation. Density measurements were taken by creating samples using an apparatus assembled by Wild River Consulting, which mainly consisted of a metallurgical press fitted with a load cell, and a 11A inch cylindrical die modified with a 0.1 inch diameter hole in the lower ram. Samples created by these instruments were assumed to be perfectly cylindrical, and therefore measuring the diameter, length, and mass yielded the density of the sample.<br>
During die extrusion, an index of melt flow was measured for each sample. By timing the sample as it passes the length calibration of the instrument, the rate in which it extruded was calculated This linear velocity was then normalized by dividing by the orifice radius. The resulting quantity was defined as the melt flow index (MFT) of the material To ensure complete mixing, extruded materials were re-extruded at least four more times.<br>
The die extruded samples were also tested for tensile elongation. Each sample was trimmed to 4 inches in length, and % inch from each end was marked. The sample was fixed in the machines grips, where the V* inch marked the point depth the sample was inserted into the grip. The test began and upon completion the sample was removed.<br>
Two formulations were tested in the experiment using Alldyne C-60 Tungsten and Dyneon THV220A fhioroporymer. The first formulation was designed to achieve a density of 10.8 g/cc. The second formulation was designed to achieve the density of 11.4 g/cc. Table 1 gives the weight percentages used to create the samples for both formulations.<br>
Four interfacial modifiers were tested in the experiment The first interfacial modifier was a Zirconate coupling agent—NZ 12. The second and third modifiers were Titanate coupling agents—KR238J and LICA 09. The last interfacial modifier was a Silane~SIA0591.0.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
It was clearly observed that treatment of the tungsten powder caused considerable changes in physical properties. In all formulations, the melt flow was severely affected with the treatment of an interfacial modifier. The melt flow index of compounded materials increased as much as 68 times the untreated compounds. The effect made can also be observed in the elongation of the material. All four interfacial modifiers caused an increase in tensile elongation, with NZ 12 and LICA<br>
09 causing the largest changes. Although materials treated with SIA0591.0 did not exhibit an increase in melt flow, they showed a surprising increase of approximately 50% of the maximum load during tensile elongation in the 91.4 wt% Tungsten compound. In the case of a fluoropolymer with no interfacial modifier, an elongation of greater than 5% is observed and demonstrates the viscoelastic character of the composite.<br>
Experimental 2,3, and 4<br>
In tables 2,3 and 4, the tungsten particulate is first treated with the interfacial modifier. This is done by dissolving the desired amount of the interfacial modifier in a 250 ml beaker containing 50 ml of solvent (usually isopropyl, or some other, alcohol) and men adding 100 grams of tungsten particulate into the beaker. The resulting slurry is men heated at 100°C until the mixture can no longer be stirred and most of the solvent has been driven off. The beaker containing the tungsten particulate and interfacial modifier is then placed in a forced air oven for 30 minutes at 100°C. The treated tungsten is then added to a 100 ml beaker containing a solution of THV220A dissolved in acetone. The mixture is men heated to 30*C and continuously stirred until most of the acetone has evaporated. The composite is men placed in a forced air oven for 30 minutes at 100°C. After drying, the composite is pressed in a 3.17 cm cylinder in a metallurgical die at 200°C and 4.5 metric tons ram force. After 5 minutes, the die is allowed to cool under pressure to 50°C. After releasing {he pressure, the composite sample is removed from the die and the physical properties are measured. See Tables 2,3, and 4 for compositions and properties measured.<br>
THV220A is a polymer of tetrafluoroethylene, hexafluoropropylene, and vinylidene fluoride. NZ 12 is neopentyl(diallyl)oxy-tri(dioctyl)phosphato-zirconate. SIA0591.0 is N-(2-arninoethyl)-3-am.onopropyl-trunethoxy-silane. KR 238J is a methacrylamid modified amine adduct available from Kenrich petrochemicals, Bayonne, NJ. LICA 09 is neopentyl(diallyl)oxy-tri(dodecyl)benzene-sulfonyl-titanate.<br>

Table 4 shows that the particle size, distribution and circularity have an impact on the density of the composite. All samples in Table 4 were made such that the formulation would result in the highest density for the resulting composite.<br>
Materials d and e have the maximum density due to the presence of both small and large average particle size materials and minimum circularity of about 14. Materials a and g have the lowest density in the table and have either only small or large particulate. The other materials either depart somewhat from the size or circularity parameter (of materials d and e) reducing density.<br>
Experimental 5<br>
The material used for the melt flow experiment data in Table 5 was made as follows. Technon Plus tungsten particulate was modified and blended with the Dyneon THV220A polymer and introduced using a calibrated gravimetric feeder into the extruder. The extruder was a Brabender 1.9 cm single screw with a custom screw, modified to create low compression. The heating zones were set to 175°C, 175°C, 175°C, and 185°C. The screw RPMs were maintained between 20 and 40. The barrel was air-cooled. The material exit speed was about 1 meter per minute. Using the above settings, 92 wt-% of Technon Phis tungsten pretreated with 0.01 wt-% of the interfacial modifier Kenrich NZ12, was blended with 8 wt-% THV220A.<br>
Typical melt flow for the materials of the invention are at least 5 sec*1, at least 10 sec*1, about 10 to 250 sec*1 or about 10 to 500 sec*1. In order to measure extrusion melt flow, a custom test system was created. A small hole (0.192 cm in diameter) was drilled into the side of a 3.17 cm metallurgical die. The die was used in conjunction with an instrumented metallurgical press, which allowed monitoring of the die temperature and pressure. With the temperature of the material and pressure of the die set, the material was extruded through the melt flow hole. For a given duration of time, the length of the resulting form was measured, and the results used to determine the peak velocity. With this data, the melt flow was calculated by dividing the velocity difference of the extrudate by the die hole radius.<br><br><br>

The NZ 12 was blended into the W particulate with the aid of acetone. The THV220A was dissolved in acetone to 38 wt-% and then added to the W slurry. This blend was stirred until the solvent is removed and only the polymer blend remains and then the matenal is compression molded in a 1.25 inch metallurgical press. This large pellet was diced and oven dried at 104C to dryness then reformed in a metallurgical press at 5700 lb-in"2 and 177C. Density of this material was 11.7 gm-cm"3.<br>
In these examples, the Tungsten particulate is first treated with the interfacial modifier. This is done by dissolving the desired amount of the interfacial modifier in a 250 ml beaker containing 50 ml of solvent (usually Isopropyl, or some other, alcohol) and then adding 100 grams of Tungsten particulate into the beaker. The resulting slurry is then mixed thoroughly on a steam bath until the mixture can no<br>
longer be stirred and most of the solvent has been driven off. The beaker containing the tungsten participate and interfacial modifier is then placed in a forced air oven for 30 minutes at 100°C. The treated tungsten is added to a 100 ml beaker containing solid solution of THV220A dissolved in acetone. The mixture is then heated to 30°C and continuously stirred until most of the acetone has evaporated. The composite is then placed in a forced air oven for 30 minutes at 100°C. After drying, the composite is pressed in a 3.17 cm cylinder in a metallurgical die at 200°C and 4.5 metric tons ram force. After 5 minutes, the die is allowed to cool under pressure to 50°C. After releasing the pressure, the composite sample is removed from the die and the physical properties are measured. See Table _ for compositions and properties measured. THV220A is a copolymer of tetra- fluoroethylene, hexafluoropropylene, and vmylidene fluoride. NZ 12 is neopentyl (diallyl)oxy-tri(dioctyl)phosphato-zirconate. SIA0591.0 is N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-amonopropyl-trimethoxy-silane. KR 238J is a methacrylamid modified amine adduct available from Kenrich petrochemicals, Bayonne, NJ.

The analysis of elongation data showed that there was a strong correlation to temperature. Regardless of solvent, the elongation of extruded material was approximately 225% at<br>
80°C and 175% at 135°C. A small increase in elongation was observed in materials compatibilized using pentanol, and the increase was consistent for both temperatures. This increase yielded an elongation of 175%, still far less than the predicted value of 225%. These observations conclude that the limiting mechanism for the coupling reaction is not solvent-exchange, and that a mechanism within the coupling agent is limited by temperature dependence.<br>
