				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION	<br>
This invention relates to a process for preparing a pharma celitical  compocition for use in  ovulation induction compricing miring of are<br>
aromatase inhibitor (A!) with FSH or a mixture of FSH 4 LH. Also disclosed are preparations and related uses. There is also described a method for increasing production of follicles in a female for the purpose of harvesting immature eggs for oocyte maturation in vitro which also involves the administration of Al. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In most assisted reproduction programs, gonadotropins are used alone or in combination to stimulate the growth and maturation of multiple oocytes. This is essential because of the need to recruit a greater number of follicles, which improves the chance of fertilization and an increased number of embryos for transfer to give acceptable success rates. Recent advances in the understanding of ovarian stimulation, the techniques of oocyte retrieval, the handling of gametes, the methods of assisted fertilization and improved conditions of culture media have steadily increased the fertilization rate. Oocyte fertilization rates of 60-70% can now be expected when conventional insemination or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are carried out. However, there has not been a corresponding increase in implantation rates, which have remained steady at10-15% per embryo1.<br>
It is believed that the high, supraphysiologic levels of estrogen, attained during ovarian stimulation, may result in an adverse effect of ovarian stimulation on the outcome of infertility treatment. Significant decreases in pregnancy andimplantation rates have been observed when estradiol concentrations were &gt; 10,000 pmol/L compared with patients having lower estradiol concentrations2. High serum estradiol concentrations on the day of HCG injection in IVF patients, regardless of the number of oocytes retrieved, were found to be detrimental to uterine receptivity3. Recently, it has been shown that a significant reduction in implantation and pregnancy rates occurred in almost all women with a serum estradiol concentration greater than 20,000 pmol/L4.<br>
Different mechanisms have been postulated to explain the adverse effect of the supraphysiologic levels of estrogen including deleterious effects on the endometrium and the embryo, although the exact mechanisms have not yet been determined. Effect of supraphysiologic levels of estrogen on implantation:<br>
There is controversy regarding the effect of ovarian hyperstimulation on endometrial development. Most investigators have reported adverse effects of high estrogen levels on endometrial development but there was no consensus on the actual mechanism of this effect. Endometrial biopsies for dating have shown both endometrial advancement and endometrial retardation in relation to high serum estradiol concentrations. However, all studies confirm direct effects on endometrial development that may jeopardize the chance of implantation due to the lack of synchronization between the endometrium and early<br>
embryo development. Such synchronization is crucial for successful implantation (window of implantation).<br>
Various studies have shown a high incidence of endometrial glandular advancement5 and retardation6 using morphological and immunohistochemical criteria7. One study of natural versus ovarian stimulation cycles, demonstrated an advanced development of the ultrastructure of endometrial surface epithelium in the stimulation cycles8. However, another investigation demonstrated that ovulation induction was not associated with abnormal endometrial development0.<br>
More recently, the effect of excessively high estradiol concentrations (&gt; 20,000 pmol/L) were found to be associated with a deficient secretory transformation of the endometrium and a suboptimal endometrial environment for implantation. This finding supports clinical observations of significantly lower pregnancy rates in 1VF cycles in women with estradiol concentrations Â£20.000 pmol/1. In these patients, there was a marked stromal oedema associated with a significantly greater number of vessels, and advanced stroma! maturation, possibly representing a direct effect of high estradiol levels on the endometrium"0. In another study, an asynchronous development of endometrial glands and stroma was found in women undergoing IVF11.<br>
Most recently, a detrimental effect of high estrogen concentrations has been demonstrated on the embryo itself. Decreased blastocyst formation and reduce embryo adhesion to an endometrial cell layer was observed in the presence of elevated estrogen concentrations"2.<br>
It appears that excessive estradiol production during controlled ovarian stimulation leads to insufficient secretory transformation of the endometrium and a discordant glandular and stromal development at a time that coincides with the period of maximum uterine receptivity. In addition, there are possible adverse effects directly on the embryo that could reduce the chance for implantation. This may explain the findings of decreased implantation and pregnancy rates in IVF when serum estradiol concentrations are exceptionally high. Measures to improve pregnancy outcome by reducing E2 levels:<br>
Different approaches have been suggested to improve the treatment outcome during assisted reproduction by reducing the intensity of ovarian stimulaton to reduce the high estrogen levels. These approaches included minimal stimulation IVF cycles and natural cycle IVF which have been reported to be effective methods of treatment for ovulatory women undergoing assisted conception13. Other measures to lower estrogen levels include decreasing the FSH dose (step down protocol). With the use of a step-down FSH regimen in high responders, uterine receptivity may be improved secondary to lowering E2 levels during the preimplantation period14. Coasting or withholding FSH injections for a period of time prior to administration of hCG has been suggested in patients at substantial risk for the development of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and is associated with lowered estradiol levels15. However, all these measures are associated with the major drawback of decreasing the number of oocytes retrieved and embryos produced.<br>
Aromatase Inhibition<br>
As discussed above, the undesirable effects of ovarian stimulation on the outcome of infertility treatment may be due to the supraphysiologic levels of estrogen. Lowering estrogen levels may be associated with improved outcome by improving the implantation and pregnancy rates in addition to lowering risk of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Reducing estrogen synthesis by aromatase inhibition during assisted reproductive technologies could be a way to ameliorate the deleterious effects of the supraphysiologic levels of estrogen during ovarian stimulation.<br>
Until recently there was no effective aromatase inhibitor that could be used clinically to reduce estrogen levels during ovarian stimulation. This is because the available aromatase inhibitors (e.g. aminoglutethemide) lacked specificity to inhibit the aromatase enzyme without inhibiting other steroidogensis enzymes. The other aromatase inhibitors (steroidal androstenedione analogues) were irreversible in their effect on the aromatase enzyme and needed to be parentally administered. Most important, these old aromatase inhibitors were not potent enough to inhibit the aromatase and lower estrogen levels in women of the reproductive age group. A new group of non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (letrozole, anastrazole and vorazole) is very potent and specific, reversibly inhibiting aromatase when orally administered with very high safety profile. Moreover, they have a relatively short half-life. In Vitro Fertilization and In Vitro Maturation<br>
It is useful to review in vitro fertilization and in vitro maturation for purposes of understanding the present invention. In vitro fertilization (IVF) in conventional use involves daily injections of fertility drugs, usually gonadotropins. Oocytes grow inside follicles and mature in the body. The mature oocytes are retrieved and fertilized by adding sperm in vitro in the laboratory.<br>
In vitro maturation (IVM) does not necessarily involve the use of fertility drugs or may involve decreased doses of gonadotropins when compared with IVF or Ol. In the procedure, which is well documented in the literature, immature oocytes are retrieved from the female ovary at about day 7 for natural or artificial exogenous (gonadotropins used) cycle and matured in vitro in the laboratory. Mature oocytes are then fertilized in the laboratory by intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (1CS1). This procedure was developed for infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The advantages over in vitro fertilization (IVF) are reduced exposure to fertility drugs, reduced requirements for patient monitoring and because of the reduced exposure to fertility drugs, drug side effects are substantially eliminated, especially those associated with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).<br>
The procedure for IVM comprises the following steps:<br>
â¢	Menstrual bleeding is induced by progestin.<br>
â¢	Ultrasound (U/S) scan is performed on day 6-9 of the cycle.<br>
â¢	Blood is drawn for maternal serum at time of U/S.<br>
â¢	PCOS pattern of follicles without a dominant follicle (1.5 cm or greater) is seen at<br>
this time.<br>
â¢	Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 10,000 IU is given to the patient using<br>
vaginal ultrasound-guided needle aspiration and local anesthesia.<br>
â¢	Egg retrieval 36 hours later and egg collection takes 15 to 30 minutes.<br>
â¢	The harvested immature oocytes are cultured in maturation medium for 24 hours.<br>
â¢	A fresh sperm sample from the female"s partner is prepared for insemination.<br>
â¢	The mature oocytes are then fertilized by ICSI.<br>
â¢	Fertilization is checked at 16 hours after ICSI.<br>
â¢	The fertilized oocytes are cultured for another 2 days.<br>
â¢	Natural progesterone (Prometrium) is started vaginally (200 mg twice daily) on the<br>
day of oocyte insemination.<br>
â¢	Two or three embryos (or one to two blastocysts) are transferred into the uterus.<br>
â¢	Embryo transfer takes a few minutes and is painless.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A reduction in E2 levels is beneficial in improving pregnancy outcome of assisted reproduction-l The use of aromatase inhibition reduces the supraphysiologic levels of estrogen during assisted reproductive technology cycles to improve the implantation and pregnancy rates in such cycles. As a result, fewer embryos need to be transferred to achieve a pregnancy thereby reducing the risk of multiple pregnancies. A reduction in E2 levels may also be beneficial in reducing the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES (ART)<br>
Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) includes, for example, the following techniques:<br>
In vitro fertilization (IVF), in which oocytes are aspirated from preovulatory follicles, combined with sperm in vitro and viable embryos are selected and placed in the uterus.<br>
Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer Procedure (GIFT), in which oocytes and sperm are combined in a catheter, and placed in the fallopian tube, so that conception occurs in the fallopian tube.<br>
Zygote Intrafallopian Transfer Procedure (ZIFT), in which the collected oocytes are combined with sperm, and fertilized embryos are transferred to the fallopian tube.<br>
Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (IGSI), in which each oocyte is directly injected with a single sperm via a microscopic needle, and viable embryos are selected for placement in the uterus or the fallopian tube.<br>
Intrauterine insemination (IUI). intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a fertility procedure in which motile sperm are washed, concentrated, and injected directly into a woman"s uterus.<br>
Therapeutic Donor insemination (TDI) involves the use of timed insemination of sperm from a donor rather than from the husband.<br>
Controlled ovarian Hyperstimulation (COH) for timed intercourse, for IUI or for other ART procedures such as IVF encompasses the concept of deliberate and regulated induction of superovulation, but also refers to production of a hormonal response intended to lead to the production of multiple eggs in the woman"s ovaries and to favor implantation of the embryo into the endometrium.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a method for improving the implantation and pregnancy rates for females undergoing assisted reproduction  (e.g. IVF, GIFT, ZIFT, ICSI, IUI, TDI and COH) or ovarian stimulation cycles for ovulation induction, which comprises prociding to such females with aromatase inhibitor (Al) during assisted reproduction cycles or ovarian stimulation cycles, wherein the Al are selected from amounts effective to reduce serum estradiol levels.<br>
The invention also provides a method of increasing the production of follicles below the size of dominant follicles for the purpose of harvesting immature eggs for oocyte maturation in vitro by prociding at least one aromatase inhibitor to a female early in one or more menstrual cycles. Dominant follicles are generally more than 1.0 cm in diameter. Preferably this treatment eliminates the need for FSH treatment altogether and prevents the occurrence of ovarian hyperstimulation (OHSS). The Al is preferably prociding as early as possible in the menstrual cycle so as to avoid having a negative impact on the developing embryo.<br>
All patients undergoing COH with FSH suffer from high estrogen levels associated with<br>
higher follicle numbers, whether undergoing ovulation induction regimen or regimens for<br>
ART-	<br>
In another aspect the invention provides a method for improving the implantation and pregnancy .rates for females undergoing assisted reproduction which comprises providing combination of one aromatase inhibitor (Al) with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).<br>
In some commercial forms of FSH, lutenizing hormone (LH) may also be present, and hence, the invention also encompasses daily doses of FSH and LH in place of <br>
of FSH alone. A particular example of such a mixed preparation is human menopausal gonadotrophin .(hMG), which is a 1:1 mixture (I.U./I.U.) of FSH and LH.<br>
Another aspect of the invention provides a pharmaceutical preparation for improving the implantation and pregnancy rates for females undergoing assisted reproduction comprising  of a composition comprising an effective amount for improving the implantation and pregnancy rates for females of an aromatase inhibitor together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The invention also provides for a two component pharmaceutical preparation for improving the implantation and pregnancy rates for females comprising of  an aromatase inhibitor together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in combination with a  follicle stimulating hormone together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
Another aspect of the invention comprises a pharmaceutical preparation for increasing the production of follicles below the size of dominant follicles for the purpose of harvesting immature eggs for oocyte maturation in vitro which comprises  of at least one aromatase inhibitor together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The invention also provides the use of of an aromatase inhibitor either alone or in combination with  follicle stimulating hormone for improving implantation and pregnancy rates for females, in ovarian stimulation for ovulation induction, in ART, and in a natural cycle.<br>
The invention also provides for the use of  of at least one aromatase inhibitor in amounts effective to reduce serum estradiol levels for increasing the production of follicles below the size of dominant follicles for the purpose of harvesting immature eggs for oocyte maturation in vitro.<br>
Another part of the invention comprises the use  of an aromatase inhibitor in the preparation of a medicament for improving the implantation and pregnancy rates for females.<br>
The use of an aromatase inhibitor during ovulation induction cycles and cycles for ART decreases the FSH required.<br>
In ART cycles in which the development of multiple follicles is stimulated with FSH or hMG (controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, COH), the high number of follicles causes estrogen levels to increase substantially. The increased estrogen levels may trigger the release of an LH surge from the pituitary. The sudden increase in LH levels may cause some developing follicles to luteinise and thus not yield oocytes. Other follicles may release their oocytes into the fallopian tubes, which is undesirable for ART cycles. (In ART cycles the oocytes are collected prior to release, by aspiration from the preovulatory follicle.) In order to prevent such an LH surge, a GnRH agonist or GnRH antagonist is given to induce a state called down-regulation. The agonist or antagonist suppresses pituitary gonadotropins, thus preventing an endogenous LH surge. This allows controlled timing for providing the hCG bolus and oocyte collection.<br>
The inventors have found that estrooen levels can be decreased during stimulation with FSH or a mixture of FSH and LH, by providing an aromatase inhibitor. Because of the decreased estrogen levels, an LH surge can be prevented. When aromatase activity is suppressed, estrogen levels remain within a normal range for a natural cycle in a healthy patient, or even below this level, at the level of a post-menopausal woman, or even below the level detectable with common immunoassays. Because of the lower estrogen levels, the pituitary will not respond with an LH surge. The use of an aromatase inhibitor can effectively replace the use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist in some patients.<br>
While one aromatase inhibitor is preferred for use in the present invention, combinations of aromatase inhibitors may be used especially those of aromatase inhibitors having different half-lives. The aromatase inhibitor is preferably selected from aromatase inhibitors having a half-life of about 8 hours to about 4 days, more preferably from aromatase inhibitors having a half-life of about 2 days. Most beneficial are those aromatase inhibitors selected from non-steroidal and reversible aromatase inhibitors. More detail on the types of aromatase inhibitors that may be used in the methods, uses, preparations and packages of the present invention appears subsequently herein.<br>
The aromatase inhibitors that have been found to be most useful of the commercially available forms are those in oral form. This form offers clear advantages over other forms, including convenience and patient compliance. Preferred aromatase inhibitors of those that are commercially available include anastrozole, letrozole, vorozole and exemestane. Exemestane (Aromasinâ¢) is an example of a steroidal aromatase inhibitor that may be used in the present invention.<br>
 Amount required for the present invention depend on the type of aromatase inhibitor that is used. Some inhibitors are more active than others and hence lower amounts of such inhibitors could be used.<br>
Typically, the amount of aromatase inhibitor for the improved implantation and pregnancy rates may be selected from amounts that lower estrogen levels to about normal physiological levels in a female such that serum estradiol concentration is less than at or about 10,000 pmol/L, preferably from at or about 300 to at or about 5000 pmol/L. in a female. In the case of increasing the production of follicles below the size of dominant follicles, the Al may be providing in amounts that lower estrogen levels to post menopausal levels in a female. For example the amount of aromatase inhibitor may be selected from amounts that lower the level of estrogen to at or about 100 pmol/L or less as measured by standard immunoassay techniques. These techniques are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
. When the aromatase inhibitor is selected from anastrozole, letrozole and vorozole, amount providing may be an amount in the range from at or about 1 mg to at or about 10 mg. When the aromatase inhibitor is exemestane, the amount providing may range from at or about 10 mg to at or about 200 mg. When the aromatase inhibitor is letrozole, it Is<br><br>
preferably providing 2.5 mg to at or about 10.0 mg. When the aromatase inhibitor is anastrozoie, preferably,providing  1 mg to at or about 4 mg. When the aromatase inhibitor is vorozole, the preferred  2 to at or about 8 mg. Exemestane is preferably  25 to at or about 50 mg. Most preferably the amount of the aromatase inhibitor comprise five times  The aromatase inhibitor is preferably<br>
 in the range 5 mg 500 mg and when the FSH is used, daily in the <br>
 range from 25 to  600 units or <br>
The FSH used may be any of the commercially available products, including urinary<br>
and recombinant FSH.   FSH may also be used in a form, which includes LH (Luteinizing<br>
Hormone).<br>
Other types of ovulatory infertility which may be treated in accordance with the present invention may include endometriosis, cervical mucus abnormalities, older patients, (e.g. older than at or about 35, preferably younger than at or about 50, more preferably younger than at or about 45, most preferably at or about 38 to at or about 42) increased baseline FSH concentration, elevated FSH concentration, and low male sperm count (male factor infertility) requiring 1UI (Intrauterine Insemination) or TD1 (therapeutic donor insemination) in which augmenting ovulation in the female partner is indicated.<br>
Whiie female here is preferably a human being, the treatments may be applied to other species as appropriate. Aromatase Inhibitor<br>
By "aromatase inhibitors" there are to be understood substances that inhibit the enzyme aromatase (estrogen synthetase), which is responsible for converting androgens to estrogens.<br>
Aromatase inhibitors may have a non-steroidal or a steroidal chemical structure. According to the present invention, both non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors and steroidal aromatase inhibitors can be used.<br>
By aromatase inhibitors there are to be understood especially those substances that in a determination of the in vitro inhibition of aromatase activity exhibit ICS0 values of 10"5 M or<br>
lower, especially 10-6 M or lower, preferably 10"7 M or lower and most especially 10-8 M or lower.<br>
The in vitro inhibition of aromatase activity can be demonstrated, for example, using the methods described in J. Biol. Chem. 249, 5364 (1974) or in J. Enzyme Inhib. 4, 169 (1990). In addition, IC50 values for aromatase inhibition can be obtained, for example, in vitro by a direct product isolation method relating to inhibition of the conversion of 4-14 C-androstenedione to 4-14 C-oestrone in human placental microsomes.<br>
By aromatase inhibitors there are to be understood most especially substances for which the minimum effective dose in the case of in vivo aromatase inhibition is 10 mg/kg or less, especially 1 mg/kg or less, preferably 0.1 mg/kg or less and most especially 0.01 mg/kg or less.<br>
In vivo aromatase inhibition can be determined, for example, by the following method [see J. Enzyme lnhib. 4, 179 (1990)]: androstenedione (30 mg/kg subcutaneously) is administered on its own or together with an aromatase inhibitor (orally or subcutaneously) to sexually immature female rats for a period of 4 days. After the fourth administration, the rats are sacrificed and the uteri are isolated and weighed. The aromatase inhibition is determined by the extent to which the hypertrophy of the uterus induced by the administration of androstenedione alone is suppressed or reduced by the simultaneous administration of the aromatase inhibitor.<br>

The compounds listed, including the individual compounds mentioned, both in free form and in salt form, may also be in the form of hydrates, or their crystals may include, for example, the solvent used for crystallisation. The present invention relates also to all those forms.<br>
Many of the above-mentioned compounds, including the individual compounds mentioned, contain at least one asymmetric carbon atom. They can therefore occur in the form of R- or S-enantiomers and as enantiomeric mixtures thereof, for example in the form of a racemate. The present invention relates to the use of all those forms and to the use of all further isomers, and of mixtures of at least 2 isomers, for example mixtures of diastereoisomers or enantiomers which can occur when there are one or more further asymmetric centres in the molecule. Also included are, for example, all geometric isomers, for example cis- and trans-isomers, that can occur when the compounds contain one or more double bonds. Pharmaceutical Formulations<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions that can be prepared according to the invention are compositions for enteral, such as peroral or rectal administration, also for transdermal or sublingual administration, and for parenteral, for example intravenous, subcutaneous and intramuscular, administration. Suitable unit dose forms, especially for peroral and/or sublingual administration, for example dragees, tablets or capsules, comprise preferably from approximately 0.01 mg to approximately 20 mg, especially from approximately 0.1 mg to approximately 10 mg, of one of the above-mentioned compounds or of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof .together with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The preferred form of administration is oral. The proportion of active ingredient in such pharmaceutical compositions is generally from approximately 0.001 % to approximately 60%, preferably from approximately 0.1% to approximately 20%.<br>
Suitable excipients for pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration are especially fillers, such as sugars, for example lactose, saccharose, mannitol or sorbitol,<br>
cellulose preparations and/or calcium phosphates, for example tricalcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate, and binders, such as starches, for example corn, wheat, rice or potato starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcelluiose and/or hydroxypropylcellulose, disintegrators, such as the above-mentioned starches, also carboxymethyl starch, cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone, agar, alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate, and/or cellulose, for example in the form of crystals, especially in the form of microcrystals, and/or flow regulators and lubricants, for example silicic acid, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as magnesium or calcium stearate, cellulose and/or polyethylene glycol.<br>
Dragee cores can be provided with suitable, optionally enteric, coatings, there being used inter alia concentrated sugar solutions which may comprise gum arabic, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and/or titanium dioxide, or coating solutions in suitable solvents or solvent mixtures, or, for the preparation of enteric coatings, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations, such as acetylcellulose phthalate or hydroxypropylmethylcellulosephthalate.<br>
Other orally administrate pharmaceutical compositions are dry-filled capsules consisting of gelatin, and also soft sealed capsules consisting of gelatin and a plasticiser, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The dry-filled capsules may contain the active ingredient in the form of granules, for example in admixture with fillers, such as lactose, binders, such as starches, and/or glidants, such as talc or magnesium stearate, and, if desired, stabilisers. In soft capsules, the active ingredient is preferably dissolved or suspended in suitable oily excipients, such as fatty oils, paraffin oil or liquid polyethylene glycols, to which stabilisers and/or anti-bacterial agents may also be added. There may also be used capsules that are easily bitten through, in order to achieve by means of the sublingual ingestion of the active ingredient that takes place as rapid an action as possible.<br>
Suitable rectally or transvaginally administrable pharmaceutical compositions are, for example, suppositories that consist of a combination of the active ingredient with a suppository base. Suitable suppository bases are, for example, natural or synthetic triglycerides, paraffin hydrocarbons, polyethylene glycols or higher alkanols. There may also be used gelatin rectal capsules, which contain a combination of the active ingredient with a base material. Suitable base materials are, for example, liquid triglycerides, polyethylene glycols or paraffin hydrocarbons.<br>
Suitable formulations for transdermal administration comprise the active ingredient together with a carrier. Advantageous carriers include absorbable pharmacologically acceptable solvents that serve to facilitate the passage through the skin of the host. Transdermal systems are usually in the form of a bandage that comprises a support, a supply container containing the active ingredient, if necessary together with carriers, optionally a separating device that releases the active ingredient onto the skin of the host at a controlled and established rate over a relatively long period of time, and means for securing the system to the skin.<br>
Suitable for parenteral administration are especially aqueous solutions of an active ingredient in water-soluble form, for example in the form of a water-soluble salt, and also suspensions of active ingredient, such as corresponding oily injection suspensions, there being used suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles, such as fatty oils, for example sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, for example ethyl oleate, or triglycerides, or aqueous injection suspensions that comprise viscosity-increasing substances, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran, and, optionally, stabilisers.<br>
Dyes or pigments may be added to the pharmaceutical compositions, especially to the tablets or dragee coatings, for example for identification purposes or to indicate different doses of active ingredient.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional mixing, granulating, confectioning, dissolving or lyophilising processes. For example, pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can be obtained by combining the active ingredient with solid carriers, optionally granulating a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture or granules, if desired or necessary after the addition of suitable excipients, to form tablets or dragee cores.<br>
The term "improving" as used herein in connection with an effect on implantation or pregnancy includes any measurable improvement or increase in frequency of occurrence of implantation or pregnancy in an individual for example when compared with the level or frequency of occurrence of implantation or pregnancy in one or more non-treated patients or when compared to the level or frequency of occurrence of implantation or pregnancy in the same patient observed at an earlier time point (e.g. comparison with a "base line" level). Preferably the improvement or increase will be a statistically significant one, preferably with a probability value of 
The invention that is claimed is described in detail in the following Examples, which are intended merely to illustrate the invention, and in no way to represent a limitation thereof. Example 1<br>
This was a prospective controlled study that included a study group, the patients of which received letrozole (2.5 mg/day from (day 3 to 7 of the menstrual cycle) in addition to FSH and a control group mat received ron oniy.  i ne stuay group included 12 unexplained infertility patients. The control group consisted of 55 unexplained infertility patients. All patients received recombinant or highly purified FSH (50-150 lU/day starting on day 3 to 7 until day of hCG (10,000 IU) that was given when 2 leading follicles were &gt;2 cm). The FSH regimen was based on the patient"s clinical profile. Patients were not randomized. All patients had intrauterine insemination. There was no statistically significant difference<br>
between the study and control groups as regards age, weight, infertility duration, number of prior insemination cycles, semen parameters or type of FSH.<br>
The FSH needed was statistically significantly lower when letrozole was used in both study group compared with the control group. However, there was no significant difference, in number of follicles &gt;1.8 cm., endometrial thickness, LH level or day of hCG administration. Estradiol level in letrozole/FSH cycles was in the normal physiological range, which was unexpected as higher levels are normally associated with increased follicle production. Pregnancy rate in the study group was 25% versus 18% in the control group. This is indicative of a positive trend in this rate. The study contained too few patients and cycles for the results to be considered to be statistically significant.<br><br>
(Table Removed) <br>
NS=not significant<br>
Example 2<br>
Fifteen patients who either failed to ovulate (6 cycles) or ovulated with an endometrial thickness 
Fifteen patients completed 17 letrozole cycles. Ovulation occurred in 13 cycles (77%) and pregnancy in 5 out of 15 patients (33%). The following table shows summary of CC<br>
and letrozole cycles.<br><br>
Table 2<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
P value (O.005 = significant) S = Significant NS = Not Significant<br>
These results illustrate the improvement letrozole offers over CC in relation to endometrial thickness and reduced estradiol levels. The results suggest improved pregnancy levels. Example 3<br>
This example demonstrates the effect of letrozole alone in a single dose form of administration. The estradiol levels in 9 treatment cycles in 7 infertile patients (3 with PCOS and 4 with unexplained infertility) undergoing ovarian stimulation and cycle monitoring for IUI who received a single 20 rng dose of letrozole on day 3 of the cycle. Follicle development was monitored by transvaginal ultrasound and by serum levels of estradiol and LH. Pregnancy was achieved in one patient. The mean estradiol level on the day of hCG was 831 pmol/L and the mean estradiol level per mature follicle was 390 pmol/L, almost exactly the same as seen with a 5-day daily dose of letrozole illustrated in the previous example.<br><br>

Example 4<br>
Superovulation for 1U1 with Letrozole and FSH<br>
Patient Group: 19 Women with unexplained fertility, 6 with PCOS, 2 with endometriosis<br>
and one with male factor<br>
Protocol: Study group received Letrozole (2.5 to 5 mg/day, days 3 to 7) and FSH (dose<br>
adjusted to need, starting on day 3, 5 or 7); hCG (10,000 bolus). Control group received<br>
FSH alone.<br>
Fertilisation Method: IUI<br>
Endpoints: Pregnancy rate, endometrial thickness, follicles &gt; 1.5 cm on hCG day,<br>
estradiol on hCG day, total FSH dose<br>
Results: Pregnancy rate with Letrozole and FSH was 38% (not reported for FSH alone),<br>
endometrial thickness was the same in both groups, number of follicles &gt; 1.5 cm was the<br>
same, estradiol was 45% lower in Letrozole group, total FSH dose was decreased by 77%<br>
in Letrozole group<br>
Example 5<br>
Letrozole for ovulation induction: summary<br>
Patient Group: PCOS and unexplained infertility undergoing IUI.<br>
Protocol: Study group 1 PCOS patients received Letrozole (2.5 to 5 mg/day, days 3 to 7);<br>
hCG bolus 10,000 I.U. Control group 1 PCOS patients received CC (50-100 mg/day, days<br>
3 to 7 or days 5 to 9); hCG bolus 10,000 I.U. Study group 2 unexplained infertility patients<br>
received Letrozole (2.5 mg/day, days 3 to 7) plus FSH (50-150 I.U., starting on days 3 to 7<br>
until hCG); hCG bolus 10,000 I.U. Control group 2 unexplained infertility patients received<br>
CC (50-100 mg/day, days 3 to 7) plus FSH (50-150 I.U., starting on day 3 to 7 unti81 hCG);<br>
