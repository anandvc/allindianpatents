Title of invention: - Master controller for base trance receiving station<br>
Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates primarily to telecom sector comprising of conserving power from conventional energy sources at Base Trans receiving station for cell phone towers<br>
Background of invention<br>
Problem:<br>
In INDIA, there has been a very vast quantity of Base Trans receiving Stations, due to a large geographical area. A very rough estimate would be about 20000 BTS per operator for the major 5 to 7 operators. This amounts to an approximate figure of more than 150,000 BTS rising at about 13% rate in rural and about 6% rate in urban areas. This development is to go on for at least two to three more years till every corner of India may be covered by the cellular network.<br>
The power conditions in India are very poor especially in the rural region and every BTS has to compulsorily have a Diesel Generator backup. If this is not done, the BTS shall remain in non working state once the battery backup for the same is over.<br>
Thus every service provider on an average spends about Rs.60 crores on Diesel to keep their network working.<br>
Development:<br>
Looking to the acute requirement of conservation of diesel and electrical energy in our country, I conducted some experiments and devised an innovative way of using the battery, the grid power, the diesel power in such a way that there should be maximum conservation of diesel and grid power.<br>
Taking a step further, a provision for handling the solar and wind power was made so as to save more amount of conventional energy where ever possible.<br>
Technical advancements:<br>
Till today, the diesel power used at BTS is done in two ways.<br>
1)	Using the battery as standby and switching diesel generator ON as soon as the grid power fails.<br>
2)	Switching the diesel generator ON when the battery reaches a particular lower voltage.<br>
Both these methods do not help in energy conservation or does it at a very low level, since these methods are not supposed to give a correct picture of the battery usage. Above this, the charging done in the conventional manner does not allow the batteries to be reused in less than 12 to 15 hours after one discharge.<br>
Both the charging and discharging methods in the present invention are changed in a manner to utilize minimum conventional energy.<br>
 <br>
Economic Significance:<br>
The achievement by the invented equipment and process shall cut down the usage of the diesel power to less than 50% if no non conventional energy sources are used.<br>
Further if non conventional energy sources like solar and wind energy are used, which are in abundance in our country, the diesel as well as the grid power usage can reduce by up to 88% of the original usage.<br>
The payback period for the intended usage is about one and half years which means, a service provider can save the stipulated amount of energy resources as well as the money to buy it very soon and in turn may be, decide to pass on the benefit to the consumer.<br>
Overall, this invention can conserve a big amount of foreign exchange, avoid a lot of air and sound pollution and still benefit the public in general as an end result of the process.<br>
Advantages:<br>
The direct advantages of the invention are as follows.<br>
1)	Minimal usage of either diesel or conventional energy, to a tune of 50 to 88% less as compared to the present usage.<br>
2)	Saving of the transportation and refueling cost for the cell phone operators.<br>
3)	Saving of the contingencies being faces during the diesel usage.<br>
4)	Lesser maintenance of the diesel generators.<br>
5)	More       eco-friendly       and       reduction       in       pollution.<br>
 <br>
Detail description of Invention<br>
This invention stops the wastage of conventional energy sources occurring by use of grid power and diesel generator, due to uncontrolled and uncoordinated use of power output available through the respective sources that leads to a very high amount of undue power and diesel consumption on a base Trans receiving station.<br>
The diesel generator is switched ON only at a required time by the balance ampere hour measurement on the battery. The balance ampere hour is measured by D.C. loading method.<br>
Intelligent controls monitor the regular power cuts on the grid and take decisions based on the collected data and power requirements to start or stop the charging through the grid and / or the diesel generator.<br>
A provision for monitoring the solar and wind turbine inputs, if available controls the total charging current requirement of the battery based on the calculations of minimum diesel wastage.The diesel generator does not run on under rated conditions thereby not wasting the diesel energy.<br>
The charging of batteries through the diesel power at the stage of low charge absorption rate of battery is avoided, except under acute requirement conditions. The peak voltage and the charging current are simultaneously controlled so as to maximize the battery life.<br>
The Master Controller operates in the following way.<br>
1)	Keeps a track of the ampere-hour (AH) of the battery utilized by the load.<br>
2)	Starts the charging of the battery at pre-defined levels of the AH capacity.<br>
3)	Charges the battery at the highest rate specified by the battery manufacturer up to 80% AH capacity charge level.<br>
4)	Monitors the temperature of the BTS (Base Trans receiving Station) and maintains it through the use of air-conditioners when required.<br>
5)	Utilizes the air-conditioner ON time to charge the batteries at a rate higher than the discharge rate.<br>
6)	Monitors the timings and durations of power failures and keeps a log of the same. Takes decisions to keep the batteries charged through the grid before an anticipated power failure, so that minimum diesel energy is used, during a power cut.<br>
 <br>
7)	Fulfills the float mode charging requirement of the battery through non-conventional energy sources or through grid, instead of doing it with diesel generator, so as to not let the DG work at under load conditions.<br>
8)	Displays all the available voltages, currents, ampere-hour, line conditions, delays for starting the DG and other relevant parameters to help monitor the system efficiently.<br>
9)	A large bulk charger as per the requirements is built-in with a special feature to avoid the limitations and the damages done to the battery by thyristor based chargers.<br>
10)	Special interlocks are provided to avoid accidental damages to the system and the components and load connected to it.<br>
11)	A voltage dropper arrangement is provided so as to supply the sensitive BTS equipments, the required voltage range.<br>
12)	Zero cross change over of the power switches facilitate minimum level or no sparking.<br>
13)	The overall sequence of power usage from sources like Solar Panel, Wind turbine, Grid, Diesel Generator and the battery is intelligently arranged automatically in a way where maximum utilization of Solar and Wind power takes place and minimum utilization of DG and grid power takes place.<br>
14)	In entirety the invented system saves very high amount of conventional power usage and a proportional amount of expenses when non-conventional power sources are used. Also it saves a large amount of diesel power and utilizes grid power instead if non-conventional power sources are not used.<br>
