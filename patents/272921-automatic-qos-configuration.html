				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a device (e.g., user equipment (UE)) which has a<br>
quality of service (QoS) database that can, if desired, be provisioned and/or fine-tuned over<br>
the air by an operator of a communication network.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
Referring to FIGURE 1 (PRIOR ART), there is shown a block diagram which is used<br>
to help explain how an application's media flow(s) 101 (e.g., a push-to-talk over cellular<br>
(PoC) application, a voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) application, a video application, a file<br>
transfer application) is currently established between a UE 100 and a communication<br>
network 102. Initially, the UE 100 (in particular an application 112) and the communication<br>
network 102 (which in this example has an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) architecture)<br>
utilize Session Description Protocol (SDP) signaling to negotiate on an application level what<br>
type of media flow(s) 101 they want to establish (see step 1). Then, the UE 100 (in<br>
particular a session manager 124) and the communication network 102 (in particular a<br>
session manager 108) attempt to activate the bearer(s) (Packet Data Protocol (PDP)<br>
context(s)) which are needed to establish the media flow(s) 101 (see steps 2a-2c). For<br>
example, if a video application 101 was desired then there would be a voice bearer and a<br>
video bearer which would need to be activated. And, if a voice application 101 was desired<br>
then just a voice bearer would need to be activated[WT1]. How these bearer(s) are<br>
activated is discussed next.<br>
First, the UE 100 needs to generate a requested QoS parameter set 104 for each of<br>
the media flow bearer(s) which it then forwards to a Serving General Packet Radio Service<br>
(GPRS) Support Node 106 (SGSN 106) (in particular the session manager 108) within the<br>
communication network 102 (see step 2a). Secondly, the session manager 108 generates<br>
and forwards a negotiated QoS parameter set 110 for each of the bearer(s) to the UE 100<br>
(see step 2b). Thirdly, the UE 100 (in particular the session manager 124) determines<br>
whether or not to accept the negotiated QoS parameter set(s) 110 which would be<br>
used to set-up the respective bearer(s)(see step 2c). If the UE 100 accepts the negotiated<br>
QoS parameter set(s) 110, then the media flow(s) 101 is/are established with the<br>
communication network 102 (see step 3). If the UE 100 does not accept any of the<br>
negotiated QoS parameter set(s) 110, then the corresponding bearer is deactivated and the<br>
corresponding media flow 101 is not established with the communication network 102. In<br>
this document, the step where the UE 100 generates the requested QoS parameter set(s)<br>
2<br>
 <br>
104 which is sent to the communication network 102 is of particular interest. How the<br>
traditional UE 100 functions to generate the requested QoS parameter set(s) 104 is<br>
discussed next.<br>
The traditional UE 100 can generate the requested QoS parameter set(s) 104 by<br>
using the following components: an application 112; a SDP handler 114 (optional); an<br>
Internet Protocol (IP) Bearer Service (BS) manager 116 (optional); a translation/mapping<br>
function 118; a Universal Mobile Telephone Service (UMTS) BS manager 120; a UMTS QoS<br>
Parameter Per Application Type database 122; and a session manager 124. These<br>
components 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, 122 and 124 generate the requested QoS parameter<br>
set(s) 104 as follows:<br>
A.	The application 112 provides the UMTS BS Manager 120, possibly via the IP BS<br>
Manager 116 and the Translation/Mapping function 118, the relevant information needed to<br>
perform step B or step D.<br>
B.	If needed, the UMTS BS Manager 120 uses information from step A to access a<br>
proper set of QoS Parameters from the UMTS QoS Parameter Per Application Type<br>
database 122. In this document it is assumed that this step is performed.<br>
C.	If the SDP handler 114 is available, then the SDP Parameters therefrom could<br>
provide guidance for the UMTS BS Manager 120 (possibly via the IP BS manager 116 and<br>
the translation/mapping function 118) to set a maximum bitrate uplink/downlink (UL/DL) and<br>
a guaranteed bitrate UL/DL.<br>
D.	A set of QoS Parameters values from step B (or directly from step A) is possibly<br>
merged at the session manager 124 together with the maximum bitrate UL/DL and the<br>
guaranteed bitrate UL/DL from step C. The result is the requested QoS parameter set(s)<br>
104.<br>
For a more detailed discussion about this UE 100 and this process, reference is<br>
made to section 7.2 of the following standard:<br>
â€¢ 3GPP TS 29.208 v6.5.0 entitled "3rd Generation Partnership Project;<br>
Technical Specification Group Core Network and Terminals; End-to-end<br>
Quality of Service (QoS) Signalling Flows (Release 6)" September 2005.<br>
A problem with this particular process is that the manufacturer of the UE 100 often<br>
utilizes their own proprietary process to add QoS values into the UMTS QoS Parameter Per<br>
Application Type database 122. This scheme has several drawbacks. First, the UE 100<br>
does not have a defined UMTS QoS Parameter Per Application Type database 122 in which<br>
QoS values can be organized and stored. Secondly, an operator can not populate/provision<br>
3<br>
 <br>
the UMTS QoS Parameter Per Application Type database 122. Thirdly, the operator can not<br>
fine-tune (update) the QoS values stored within the UMTS QoS Parameter Per Application<br>
Type database 122. Additional prior art is briefly discussed next.<br>
US 2005/018633 A1 (27 January 2005) describes a method and apparatus for a<br>
wireless communication system having a plurality of terminals. At least one quality<br>
requirement defining a minimum quality of communication service threshold for receiving<br>
information by at least one terminal over a communication channel is determined. At least<br>
one quality parameter of the communication channel is also determined, where the quality<br>
parameter defines a degree of quality in which communication is received by the terminal<br>
over the communication channel. The quality parameter is compared to the quality<br>
requirement, and the terminal is prevented from tuning to the communication channel if the<br>
quality parameter is lower than the quality requirement.<br>
EP 1 035 751 A2 (13 September 2000) describes an adaptive routing system and<br>
method for packet networks. The packet network employs routers that determine network<br>
routing based on QoS provisioning parameters and network topology information. In one<br>
embodiment, the routers have per-flow tables provisioned with information as to what<br>
minimum QoS levels should be applied to/reserved for specified traffic flows within the<br>
packet network.<br>
US 2003/208582 A1 (6 November 2003) describes a method for translation between<br>
IP QoS and UMTS QoS parameters. The method can be placed in both the UE as well as<br>
the Gateway of a UMTS network.<br>
From the foregoing, it should be appreciated that there is a need for a device (e.g.,<br>
user equipment (UE)) which has a quality of service (QoS) database that can if desired be<br>
provisioned and/or fine-tuned over the air by an operator of a communication network.<br>
There is also a need for a device that can use this QoS database to help establish an<br>
application media flow with the communication network. These needs and other needs are<br>
solved by the UE and the method of the present invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A UE is described herein that has a defined QoS database which is used to organize<br>
and store various QoS parameter sets which are used to help establish media flows. In one<br>
embodiment, the QoS database includes a plurality of tables, where each table is associated<br>
with a particular application, and where each table has a plurality of rows, and where each<br>
row includes a media type, a requested QoS parameter set, and an optional minimum QoS<br>
parameter set. In another embodiment, a method is described herein for enabling the UE to<br>
establish an application media flow with a communication network by: (a) negotiating what<br>
4<br>
 <br>
type of media flow is to be established with the communication network; and (b) setting-up a<br>
bearer for the media flow which is to be established with the communication network by<br>
performing the following steps: (i) interacting with a database which includes a plurality of<br>
tables, where each table is associated with a particular application, and where each table<br>
has a plurality of rows, and where each row includes a media type, a requested quality of<br>
service parameter set and a minimum quality of service parameter set; (ii) obtaining, from<br>
the database, the requested quality of service parameter set and the minimum quality of<br>
service parameter set of the media type associated with the application; (iii) sending, to the<br>
communication network, the requested quality of service parameter set; (iv) receiving, from<br>
the communication network, a negotiated quality of service parameter set (404); and (v)<br>
determining whether or not to accept the negotiated quality of service parameter set by<br>
comparing the negotiated quality of service parameter set to the minimum quality of service<br>
parameter set.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
5<br>
 <br>
Referring to FIGURE 2A, there is shown a block diagram of a UE 200 which has a<br>
QoS database 222 (e.g., enhanced UMTS QoS Parameter Per Application Type database<br>
222) with a defined format in which QoS values are organized and stored in accordance with<br>
the present invention. The exemplary UE 200 shown has the following components (which<br>
are relevant to this discussion): an application 212; an SDP handler 214 (optional); an IP BS<br>
manager 216 (optional); a translation/mapping function 218; an UMTS BS manager 220; the<br>
QoS database 222 (e.g., an enhanced UMTS QoS Parameter Per Application Type<br>
database 224); and a session manager 224. The components 212, 214, 216, 218, 220 and<br>
224 happen to be well known to those skilled in the art. However, the enhanced QoS<br>
database 222 is new and happens to be a marked-improvement over the prior art as<br>
discussed next with respect to FIGURE 2B.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 2B, there is a block diagram that illustrates in greater detail the<br>
format of an exemplary QoS database 222. The exemplary QoS database 222 shown has<br>
one table 226a, 226b...226n per application 228a, 228b...228n (e.g., a push-to-talk over<br>
cellular (PoC) application, a VoIP application, a video application (e.g., television), a file<br>
transfer application). Each table 226a, 226b...226n has one or more rows 230a, 230b...230n<br>
where each individual row is associated with a media type, e.g., voice or video. In particular,<br>
each individual row 230a, 230b...230n contains a media type 232a, 232b...232n, a requested<br>
QoS parameter set 234a, 234b...234n and an optional minimum QoS parameter set 236a,<br>
236b...236n. For example, the first table 226a which could be associated with a PoC<br>
application 228a has five rows 230a each of which is associated with a specific media type<br>
that has been identified as "General Purpose", "AMROO", "AMR04", "AMR07" and "AMR*".<br>
The "AMR" indicates an adaptive multi-rate and the "*" indicates a wildcard. This exemplary<br>
QoS database 222 happens to have tables 226a, 226b...226n which are defined to organize<br>
and store QoS parameters that could be used within the IMS architecture.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 3, there is shown a block diagram which is used to help explain<br>
how an operator can use a communication network 300 to populate/provision the UE's QoS<br>
database 222 in accordance with the present invention. The communication network 300 is<br>
shown as having a bootstrap server 302 and a provisioning server 304. In operation, the UE<br>
200 and the bootstrap server 302 can initiate a bootstrap session with one another over the<br>
air to establish a secure relationship (see step 1). Or, the bootstrap server 302 can store the<br>
bootstrap message (key) on a smart card which is inserted into the UE 200. The UE 200<br>
and the provisioning server 304 then initiate a provisioning session with one another over the<br>
air so the provisioning server 304 can send QoS values 306 to the UE 200 which are stored<br>
within the QoS database 222 (see step 2). In particular, the provisioning server 304 (or the<br>
UE 200) can initiate the provisioning session using a key that was obtained during the<br>
6<br>
 <br>
bootstrap session. Then, the provisioning server 304 can send the QoS values 306 to the<br>
UE 200 which stores them within the QoS database 222. Alternatively the bootstrap server<br>
302 could place the QoS values directly into the bootstrap message which is stored in a<br>
smart card that is inserted into the UE 200. This alternative is a simpler way for sending<br>
QoS values to the UE 200, because there are no messages that need to be sent from the<br>
UE 200 to the communication network 300. In either case, the operator can utilize the<br>
bootstrap server 302 and/or the provisioning server 304 to effectively populate/provision the<br>
QoS database 222. The operator can also use the bootstrap server 302 and/or provisioning<br>
server 304 to fine-tune (update) the QoS database 222. This is a marked improvement over<br>
the prior art in which the operator could not do any of these things because the manufacturer<br>
provisioned/populated the QoS database 122 when the UE 100 was manufactured (see<br>
FIGURE 1).<br>
Referring to FIGURE 4, there is shown a block diagram which is used to help explain<br>
how the UE 200 can use the populated QoS database 222 therein to establish an<br>
application's media flows 400 with the communication network 300 in accordance with the<br>
present invention. Initially, the UE 200 (in particular the application 212) and communication<br>
network 300 (which in this example has an IMS architecture) utilize SDP signaling to<br>
negotiate on an application level what type of application 400 (e.g., a PoC application, a<br>
VoIP application, a video application, a file transfer application) they want to establish (see<br>
step 1). Then, the UE 200 (in particular a session manager 224) and the communication<br>
network 300 (in particular a session manager 310) attempt to activate the bearer(s) (Packet<br>
Data Protocol (PDP) context(s)) which are needed to establish the application's media<br>
flow(s) 400 (see steps 2a-2c). For example, if a video application 400 is desired then there<br>
would be a voice bearer and a video bearer which would need to be activated. And, if a<br>
voice application 400 is desired then just a voice bearer would need to be activated. How<br>
these bearer(s) are activated is discussed next.<br>
First, the UE 200 needs to generate a requested QoS parameter set 402 for each of<br>
the media flow bearer(s) which it then forwards to a SGSN 308 (in particular the session<br>
manager 310) within the communication network 300 (see step 2a). Secondly, the session<br>
manager 310 generates and forwards a negotiated QoS parameter set 404 for each of the<br>
bearer(s) to the UE 200 (see step 2b). Thirdly, the UE 200 (in particular the session<br>
manager 224) determines whether or not to accept the negotiated QoS parameter set(s) 404<br>
which would be used to set-up the respective bearer(s)(see step 2c). If the UE 200 accepts<br>
the negotiated QoS parameter set(s) 404, then the media flow(s) 400 is/are established with<br>
the communication network 300 (see step 3). If the UE 200 does not accept any of the<br>
negotiated QoS parameter set(s) 404, then the corresponding bearer is deactivated and the<br>
7<br>
 <br>
corresponding media flow 400 is not established with the communication network 300. In<br>
this document, the step where the UE 200 generates the requested QoS parameter set(s)<br>
402 which is sent to the communication network 300 is of particular interest. How the UE<br>
200 can generate the requested QoS parameter set(s) 402 is discussed next.<br>
The UE 200 can generate the requested QoS parameter set(s) 402 by using the<br>
following components: the application 212; the SDP handler 214 (optional); the IP BS<br>
manager 216 (optional); the translation/mapping function 218; the UMTS BS manager 220;<br>
the QoS database 222 (e.g., enhanced UMTS QoS Parameter Per Application Type<br>
database 222); and the session manager 224. These components 212, 214, 216, 218, 220,<br>
222 and 224 can generate the requested QoS parameter set(s) 402 as follows:<br>
A.	The application 212 provides the UMTS BS Manager 220, possibly via the IP BS<br>
Manager 216 and the Translation/Mapping function 218, the relevant information<br>
needed to perform step B or step D.<br>
B.	If needed, the UMTS BS Manager 220 uses information from step A to access a<br>
proper set of QoS Parameter sets 306 from the enhanced UMTS QoS Parameter<br>
Per Application Type database 222. In this document it is assumed that this step is<br>
performed.<br>
C.	If the SDP handler 214 is available, then the SDP Parameters therefrom could<br>
provide guidance for the UMTS BS Manager 220 (possibly via the IP BS manager<br>
216 and the translation/mapping function 218) to set a maximum bitrate<br>
uplink/downlink (UL/DL) and a guaranteed bitrate UL7DL.<br>
D.	The QoS Parameter set(s) 306 from step B (or QoS Parameter values from step A)<br>
is possibly merged at the session manager 224 together with the maximum bitrate<br>
UL/DL and the guaranteed bitrate UL/DL from step C. The result is the requested<br>
QoS parameter set(s) 402.<br>
From the foregoing, it can be seen that the UE 200 is a marked improvement over<br>
the prior art. Because, the UE 200 has a defined QoS database 222 which can be<br>
provisioned and/or fine-tuned over the air by an operator of a communication network 300.<br>
The UE 200 also has many other advantages as well some of which are discussed in the<br>
following list:<br>
8<br>
 <br>
â€¢	The QoS database 222 has tables 226a, 226b...226n which can store QoS<br>
parameter sets 306 that are based on the QoS requirements of a particular type of<br>
communication network 300 (e.g., a communication network 300 with an IMS<br>
architecture). This is important because there are many different types of<br>
communication networks.<br>
â€¢	The operator can populate the QoS database 222 for existing applications and future<br>
applications. And, the operator can populate the QoS database 222 with QoS<br>
parameter sets that they would like to use to help establish the application's media<br>
flow(s) 400 within their communication network 300.<br>
â€¢	It should be appreciated that not all of the requested QoS parameters 402 need to be<br>
provisioned. Instead, some of the QoS parameters may be created with other<br>
mechanisms. For instance, it is possible to calculate some of the QoS values within<br>
the UE 200. As such, the UE 200 could select between QoS parameters that are<br>
calculated and QoS parameters that are provisioned. And, the UE 200 may not even<br>
need to expose the calculated QoS parameters to the provisioning server 304.<br>
â€¢	A benefit of having one table per application is that there is no need to standardize<br>
globally unique media type identifiers between different organizations. It is usually<br>
very hard to maintain a global registration organization and if this solution is used this<br>
is not needed.<br>
â€¢	The user of UE 200 does not have to worry about the QoS settings within the QoS<br>
database 222. In fact, because an operator can populate the QoS database 222<br>
they can also make sure the QoS is coupled to the quality perceived by the user and<br>
to the network characteristics.<br>
â€¢	The QoS database 222 has one table per application which avoids a need to use<br>
globally unique identifiers which are required if a global QoS database is used. This<br>
means that the definitions of various identifiers can be based on the specific<br>
applications which are supported/standardized by specific organizations.<br>
Although one embodiment of the present invention has been illustrated in the<br>
accompanying Drawings and described in the foregoing Detailed Description, it should be<br>
understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiment disclosed, but is capable of<br>
9<br>
 <br>
numerous rearrangements, modifications and substitutions without departing from the scope<br>
of the invention as set forth and defined by the following claims.<br>
10<br>
 <br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A user equipment (200) characterized by:<br>
a database (222) including a plurality of tables (226a, 226b...226n), where each table<br>
is associated with a particular application (228a, 228b...228n), and where each table has a<br>
plurality of rows (230a, 230b...230n), and where each row includes a media type (232a,<br>
232b...232n) and a requested quality of service parameter set (234a, 234b...234n) (e.g., see<br>
page 5, lines 8-10 in specification for support of the claimed subject matter).<br>
2.	The user equipment of Claim 1, wherein each row further includes a minimum quality<br>
of service parameter set (236a, 236b...236n).<br>
3.	The user equipment of Claim 1, wherein said application is:<br>
a voice over Internet Protocol application;<br>
a push-to-talk over cellular application;<br>
a video application; or<br>
a file transfer application.<br>
4.	A method for enabling a user equipment (200) to establish an application media flow<br>
(400) with a communication network (300), said method characterized by the steps of:<br>
negotiating what type of media flow is to be established with the communication<br>
network; and<br>
setting-up a bearer for the media flow which is to be established with the<br>
communication network by:<br>
interacting with a database (222) which includes a plurality of tables (226a,<br>
226b...226n), where each table is associated with a particular application (228a,<br>
228b...228n), and where each table has a plurality of rows (230a, 230b...230n), and where<br>
each row includes a media type (232a, 232b...232n), a requested quality of service<br>
parameter set (234a, 234b...234n) and a minimum quality of service parameter set (236a,<br>
236b...236n);<br>
obtaining, from the database, the requested quality of service parameter set<br>
and the minimum quality of service parameter set of the media type associated with the<br>
application;<br>
sending, to the communication network, the requested quality of service<br>
parameter set (402);<br>
receiving, from the communication network, a negotiated quality of service<br>
parameter set (404); and<br>
11<br>
 <br>
determining whether or not to accept the negotiated quality of service<br>
parameter set by comparing the negotiated quality of service parameter set to the minimum<br>
quality of service parameter set (e.g., see page 5, lines 8-10 in specification for support of<br>
the claimed subject matter).<br>
5.	The method of Claim 5, wherein said application is:<br>
a voice over Internet Protocol application;<br>
a push-to-talk over cellular application;<br>
a video application; or<br>
a file transfer application.<br>
6.	The method of Claim 5, wherein said database is populated over air by performing<br>
the following steps:<br>
establishing a secure relationship over the air between said user equipment and said<br>
communication network; and<br>
populating over the air said database within said user equipment with the media<br>
type(s), the requested quality of service parameter set(s) and the minimum quality of service<br>
parameter set(s) which are respectively associated with the applications.<br>
7.	The method of Claim 5, wherein said database is fine-tuned over air by performing<br>
the following steps:<br>
establishing a secure relationship over the air between said user equipment and said<br>
communication network; and<br>
12<br>
fine-tuning over the air said database within said user equipment with one or more of<br>
the media type(s), the requested quality of service parameter set(s) and/or the minimum<br>
quality of service parameter set(s) which are respectively associated with one or more<br>
applications<br>
 <br>
A UE is described herein that has a defined QoS database which is used to organize<br>
and store various QoS parameter sets which are used to help establish media flows. In one<br>
embodiment, the QoS database includes a plurality of tables, where each table is associated<br>
with a particular application, and where each table has a plurality of rows, and where each<br>
row includes a media type, a requested QoS parameter set, and an optional minimum QoS<br>
parameter set. An operator can use a communication network to populate/provision the<br>
QoS database. An operator can also use the communication network to fine-tune (update)<br>
the QoS database which enables them to enhance the bearer QoS for existing applications<br>
and to enable the appropriate bearer QoS for future applications.</td>
