HUMAN MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES TO ACTIVIN RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE-1<br>
This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง 119(e) from United States provisional<br>
application 60/715,292, filed September 7, 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to human monoclonal antibodies and antigen-binding portions<br>
thereof that bind to the extracellular domain (ECD) of activin receptor-like kinase-1 (ALK-1). The invention<br>
also relates to nucleic acid molecules encoding such antibodies and antigen-binding portions, methods of<br>
making human anti-ALK-1 antibodies and antigen-binding portions, compositions comprising these<br>
antibodies and antigen-binding portions and methods of using the antibodies, antigen-binding portions,<br>
and compositions.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
ALK-1 is a type I cell surface receptor for transforming growth factor beta receptor type 1 (TGF-<br>
beta-1). Human ALK-1 is a 503 amino acid polypeptide, which includes a signal sequence (amino acids:<br>
1-21), a N-terminal extracellular TGF-beta-1 ligand binding domain or ECD (amino acids: 22-118), a<br>
single transmembrane domain (amino acids: 119-141) a regulatory glycine/serine rich (GS) domain<br>
(amino acids: 142-202) and a C-terminal a serine-threonine kinase domain (202-492). The amino acid<br>
sequence of human ALK-1 disclosed in Attisano et al. Cell, 1993, vol. 75, pp. 671-680 includes Ser at<br>
position 172 (Genbank record L17075), while U.S. Patent 6,316,217 claims the amino acid sequence of<br>
human ALK-1 with Thr at position 172 (Genbank record NM_000020). ACVRL1 gene encoding a full-<br>
length human ALK-1 disclosed in Attisano et al. is commercially available from Invitrogen Inc., Clone ID<br>
IOH21048. Although ALK-1 shares 60-80% overall homology with other type I receptors (ALK-2 through<br>
ALK-7), ECD of ALK-1 is remarkably divergent from ECDs of other ALK family members. For example, in<br>
human, only ECD of ALK-2 is significantly related to ECD of ALK-1 (sharing approximately 25 % amino<br>
acid identity). U.S. Patent 6,316,217; ten Dijke et al. Oncogene, 1993, vol. 8, pp. 2879-2887; Attisano et<br>
al. Cell, 1993, vol. 75, pp. 671-680.<br>
In general, TGF-beta superfamily ligands exert their biological activities via binding to heteromeric<br>
receptor complexes of two types (I and II) of serine/threonine kinases. Type II receptors are constitutively<br>
active kinases that phosphorylate type I receptor upon ligand binding. In turn, activated type I kinases<br>
phosphorylate downstream signaling molecules including the various Smads, which translocate to the<br>
nucleus and lead to a transcriptional response. Heldin et al. Nature, 1997, vol. 390, pp. 465-471. In the<br>
case of ALK-1, we have shown that Smadl is specifically phosphorylated and translocates to the nucleus<br>
where it directly regulates the expression of the Smadl responsive genes Id1 and EphB2.<br>
ALK-1 is expressed highly and selectively in endothelial cells and other highly vascularized<br>
tissues such as placenta or brain. We have shown by Affymetrix profiling and real-time RT-PCR that the<br>
expression of ALK-1 in endothelial cells highly exceeds the expression of its co-receptors activin type II<br>
and endoglin, its ligand TGF-beta-1 or ALK-5. Mutations in ALK-1 are associated with heredity<br>
hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), suggesting a critical role for ALK-1 in the control of blood vessel<br><br>
-2-<br>
development or repair. Abdalla et al. J. Med. Genet, 2003, vol. 40, pp. 494-502; Sadick et al.<br>
Hematologica/The Hematology J., 2005, vol. 90, 818-828. Furthermore, two independent studies of ALK-<br>
1 knockout mice provide the key in vivo evidence for ALK-1 function during angiogenesis. Oh et al. Proc<br>
Natl Acad Sci USA, 2000, vol. 97, pp. 2626-2631; Urness et al. Nature Genetics, 2000, vol. 26, pp. 328-<br>
331.<br>
Angiogenesis is the physiological process involving the formation of new blood vessels from pre-<br>
existing vessels and/or circulating endothelial stem cells. This is a normal process in growth and<br>
development, as well as in wound healing. However, this is also a fundamental step in the transition of<br>
tumors from a dormant state to a malignant state. Hanahan and Folkman, "Patterns and Emerging<br>
Mechanisms of the Angiogenic Switch During Tumorigenesis," Cell, 86(3):353-364, 1996; Carmeliet,<br>
"Angiogenesis in Health and Disease," Nature Medicine, 9(6):653-660, 2003; Bergers and Benjamin,<br>
"Tumoreigenesis and the Angiogenic Switch," Nature Reviews, 3:401-410, 2003. In diseases like cancer,<br>
the body loses the ability to maintain balanced angiogenesis. New blood vessels feed diseased tissues,<br>
destroy normal tissues, and in the case of some cancers, the new vessels can allow tumor cells to escape<br>
into the circulation and lodge in other organs (tumor metastases). Angiogenesis inhibitors, including<br>
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), are a very promising class of drugs targeted against this abnormal<br>
process to block or slow tumor growth.<br>
In addition to a role in solid tumor growth and metastasis, other notable conditions with an<br>
angiogenic component are, for example, arthritis, psoriasis, neovascular age-related macular<br>
degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Bonnet et al. "Osteoarthritis, Angiogenesis and Inflammation,"<br>
Rheumatology, 2005, vol. 44, pp. 7-16; Creamer et al. "Angiogenesis in psoriasis," Angiogenesis, 2002,<br>
vol. 5, pp. 231-236; Clavel et al. "Recent data on the role for angiogenesis in rheumatoid arthritis," Joint<br>
Bone Spine, 2003, vol. 70, pp. 321-326; Anandarajah et al. "Pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis," Curr.<br>
Opin. Rheumatol., 2004, vol. 16, pp. 338-343; Ng et al. "Targeting angiogenesis, the underlying disorder<br>
in neovascular age-related macular degeneration," Can. J. Ophthalmol., 2005, vol. 40, pp. 352-368;<br>

Eye Research, 2003, vol. 22, pp. 1-29; Adamis et al. "Angiogenesis and ophthalmic disease,"<br>
Angiogenesis, 1999, vol. 3, pp. 9-14.<br>
Anti-angiogenic therapies are expected to be chronic in nature. Accordingly, targets with highly<br>
selective endothelial function, such as ALK-1, are preferred to reduce attrition resulting from side effects.<br>
Furthermore, given the remarkable divergence of the ALK-1 ECD from ECDs of other ALK family<br>
members, mAb raised against the human ALK-1 ECD are expected to selectively target ALK-1. Based on<br>
these considerations, a monoclonal antibody against the ALK-1 extracellular domain that may inhibit<br>
dimerization with the type II receptor and therefore block Smadl phosphorylation and the downstream<br>
transcriptional response is highly desirable.<br>
R&amp;D Systems, Inc. makes and sells a monoclonal anti-human ALK-1 antibody {Cat. # MAB370)<br>
produced from a hybridoma resulting from the fusion of mouse myeloma with B cells obtained from a<br>
mouse immunized with purified NSO-derived recombinant human ALK-1 extracellular domain. We have<br>
shown that this antibody neither neutralizes the interaction between ALK-1 and TGF-beta-1 nor abrogates<br><br>
-3-<br>
Smadl phosporylation. Rabbit antisera have been generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding<br>
to a part of the intracellular juxtamembrane region of ALK-1 (amino acid residues 145-166), coupled to<br>
key-hole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) (U.S. Patent 6,692,925) and against the entire ALK-1 extracellular<br>
domain except for the leading sequence (Lux et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1999, vol. 274, pp. 9984-9992).<br>
Abdalla et al (Human Mol. Gen., 2000, vol. 9, pp.1227-1237) report generation of a polyclonal antibody to<br>
ALK-1 using a recombinant vaccinia virus construct. R&amp;D Systems, Inc. makes and sells a polyclonal<br>
anti-human ALK-1 antibody (Cat. # AF370) produced in goats immunized with purified, NSO-derived,<br>
recombinant human ALK-1 extracellular domain.<br>
To date, no fully human monoclonal antibodies to the ECD of ALK-1 have been reported, and no-<br>
one has demonstrated the efficacy of any monoclonal antibody to the ECD of ALK-1 in abrogating the<br>
ALK-1/TGF-beta-1 /Smadl signaling pathway.<br>

Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows an example of epitope binding data. The 1.12.1(M29I/D19A) antibody was<br>
injected for 10 minutes followed by a second 10 minute injection of the 1.12.1(M29I/D19A) antibody. This<br>
defines the maximum response for a 20 minute injection of that antibody. The 20 minute injection<br>
maximum response was similarly determined for the 1.27.1 antibody. The 1.12.1(M29I/D19A) antibody<br>
was injected for 10 minutes followed by a 10 minute injection of the 1.27.1 antibody. If the total response<br>
falls between the defined maximum responses then the two antibodies must bind to the same epitope. If<br><br>
-13-<br>
th e total response exceeds the highest maximum response then the antibodies must bind to different<br>
epitopes. The experiment was repeated with the order of injections reversed as described in Example 9.<br>

described herein. The nomenclature used in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and<br>
techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical<br>
chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art.<br>
The following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following<br>
meanings:<br>
As used herein, the term "ALK-1" refers to mammalian activin receptor-like kinase-1. The term<br>
ALK-1 is intended to include recombinant ALK-1 and recombinant chimeric forms of ALK-1, which can be<br>
prepared by standard recombinant expression methods.<br>
As used herein, the acronym "mAb" refers to a monoclonal antibody.<br>
As used herein, an antibody that is referred to by number is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that is<br>
obtained from the hybridoma of the same number. For example, monoclonal antibody 1.12.1 is obtained<br>
from hybridoma 1.12.1.<br>
1.12.1 refers to the mAb 1.12.1 variant that was isolated from the hybridoma.<br>
1.12.1(rWT) refers to the mAb 1.12.1 variant that was expressed recombinant mAb.<br>
1.12.1(M29I/ D19A) refers to the mAb 1.12.1 variant that was expressed recombinant mAb<br>
containing two specific amino acid mutations (methionine at position 29 in the heavy chain replaced with<br>
isoleucine and aspartic acid at position 19 in the light chain replaced with alanine).<br>
1.12.1(M29I) refers to the mAb 1.12.1 variant that was expressed recombinant mAb containing a<br>
specific single amino acid mutation where the methionine at position 29 in the heavy chain was replaced<br>
with isoleucine.<br>
1.12.1(D19A) refers to the mAb 1.12.1 variant that was expressed recombinant mAb containing a<br>
specific single amino acid mutation where the aspartic acid at position 19 in the light chain was replaced<br>
with alanine.<br>
As used herein, "abnormal cell growth", unless otherwise indicated, refers to cell growth that is<br>
independent of normal regulatory mechanisms (e.g., loss of contact inhibition).<br><br>
-16-<br>
As used herein, the term "adjacent" is used to refer to nucleotide sequences which are directly<br>
attached to one another, having no intervening nucleotides. By way of example, the pentnucleotide 5'-<br>
AAAAA-3' is adjacent to the trinucleotide 5'-TTT-3' when the two are connected thus: 5'-AAAAATTT-3' or<br>
5'-TTTAAAAA-3', but not when the two are connected thus: S'-AAAAACTTT-S'.<br>
The term "agent" is used herein to denote a chemical compound, a mixture of chemical<br>
compounds, a biological macromolecule, or an extract made from biological materials.<br>
As used herein, to "alleviate" a disease, disorder or condition means reducing the severity of the<br>
symptoms of the disease, disorder, or condition. This includes, but is not limited to, affecting the size,<br>
growth and/or mass of a tumor, the extent or progression of metastasis, and the like, in a patient<br>
compared with these same parameters in the patient prior to or in the absence of the method of treatment.<br>
As used herein, the acronym "Id1" refers to a specific downstream target gene of ALK-1, the Id1<br>
gene, which is important for angiogenesis. The Id1 gene has been reported to control the angiogenesis<br>
pathway in certain cancers by turning off the production of a protein, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a<br>
naturally occurring angiogenesis suppressor. For example, it has been reported that the Id1 gene, which<br>
is highly expressed in melanoma, breast, head and neck, brain, cervical, prostate, pancreatic and<br>
testicular cancers, results in decreased expression of TSP-1 and increased tumor blood vessel formation.<br>
Volpert, Olga V. et al, "Id1 regulates angiogenesis through transcriptional repression of thrombospondin-<br>
1," Cancer Cell, Dec. 2002, Vol. 2, pp. 473-483.<br>
As used herein, the term "Smad" refers to Smad domain proteins found in a range of species from<br>
nematodes to humans. These highly conserved proteins contain an N-terminal MH1 domain that contacts<br>
DNA, and is separated by a short linker region from the C-terminal MH2 domain, the latter showing a<br>
striking similarity to forkhead-associated (FHA) domains. FHA and Smad (MH2) domains share a<br>
common structure consisting of a sandwich of eleven beta strands in two sheets with Greek key topology.<br>
Smad proteins mediate signalling by the TGF-beta/activin/BMP-2/4 cytokines from receptor Ser/Thr<br>
protein kinases at the cell surface to the nucleus. Smad proteins fall into three functional classes: the<br>
receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), including Smadl, -2, -3, -5, and -8, each of which is involved in a<br>
ligand-specific signalling pathway; the comediator Smads (co-Smads), including Smad4, which interact<br>
with R-Smads to participate in signalling; and the inhibitory Smads (l-Smads), including Smad-6 and -7,<br>
which block the activation of R-Smads and Co-Smads, thereby negatively regulating signalling pathways.<br>
As used herein, the term "TGF-beta" refers to the transforming growth factors-beta, which<br>
constitutes a family of multi-functional cytokines (TGF-beta 1-5) that regulate cell growth and<br>
differentiation. Transforming growth factor (TGF) is one of many characterized growth factors that exist in<br>
nature. It plays crucial roles in "SCID" mice with severe combined immunodeficiency. Many cells<br>
synthesize TGF-beta, and essentially all have specific receptors for this peptide. TGF-beta regulates the<br>
actions of many other peptide growth factors and determines a positive or negative direction of their<br>
effects. TGF-beta is a tumor suppressing cytokine with growth inhibitory effects in epithelial cells. TGF-P<br>
may also act as a tumor promoter by eliciting an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. TGF-p inactivates<br>
several proteins involved in cell cycle progression and thereby exerts its growth-inhibitory effects on<br>
epithelial cells by causing them to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The protein functions as a<br><br>
-17-<br>
disulphide-linked homodimer. Its sequence is characterised by the presence of several C-terminal<br>
cysteine residues, which form interlocking disulphide links arranged in a knot-like topology. A similar<br>
"cystine-knot" arrangement has been noted in the structures of some enzyme inhibitors and neurotoxins<br>
that bind to voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, although the precise topology differs. TGF-beta genes are<br>
expressed differentially, suggesting that the various TGF- beta species may have distinct physiological<br>
roles in vivo.<br>
As used herein, the term "TGF-beta 1" refers to transforming growth factor beta receptor type 1,<br>
which is a peptide of 112 amino acid residues derived by proteolytic cleavage from the C-terminal of a<br>
precursor protein. Examination of TGF-beta 1 mRNA levels in adult murine tissues indicates that<br>
expression is predominant in spleen, lung and placenta. TGF-beta 1 is believed to play important roles in<br>
pathologic processes.<br>
As used herein, the term "SCID" refers to mice with severe combined immunodeficiency.<br>
As used herein, the term "HUVEC" refers to human umbilical vein endothelial cells.<br>
As used herein, "amino acids" are represented by the full name thereof, by the three letter code<br>
corresponding thereto, or by the one-letter code corresponding thereto, as indicated in the following table:<br>

A "conservative amino acid substitution" is one in which an amino acid residue is substituted by<br>
another amino acid residue having a side chain R group) with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or<br>
hydrophobicity). In general, a conservative amino acid substitution will not substantially change the<br>
functional properties of a protein. In cases where two or more amino acid sequences differ from each<br>
other by conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity or degree of similarity may be adjusted<br>
upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Means for making this adjustment are<br>
well-known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., Pearson, Methods Mol. Biol. 243:307-31 (1994).<br>
Examples of groups of amino acids that have side chains with similar chemical properties include<br>
1) aliphatic side chains: glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine; 2) aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains:<br>
serine and threonine; 3) amide-containing side chains: asparagine and glutamine; 4) aromatic side chains:<br>
phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; 5) basic side chains: lysine, arginine, and histidine; 6) acidic side<br>
chains: aspartic acid and glutamic acid; and 7) sulfur-containing side chains: cysteine and methionine.<br>
Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-<br>
tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, glutamate-aspartate, and asparagine-glutamine.<br>
Alternatively, a conservative replacement is any change having a positive value in the PAM250<br>
log-likelihood matrix disclosed in Gonnet et al., Science 256:1443-45 (1992), herein incorporated by<br>
reference. A "moderately conservative" replacement is any change having a nonnegative value in the<br>
PAM250 log-likelihood matrix.<br>
In certain embodiments, amino acid substitutions to an anti-ALK-1 antibody or antigen-binding<br>
portion thereof are those which: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to<br>
oxidation,- (3) alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes, and (4) confer or modify other<br>
physicochemical or functional properties of such analogs, but still retain specific binding to ALK-1.<br>
Analogs can include various substitutions to the normally-occurring peptide sequence. For example,<br>
single or multiple amino acid substitutions, preferably conservative amino acid substitutions, may be made<br>
in the normally-occurring sequence, for example in the portion of the polypeptide outside the domain(s)<br>
forming intermolecular contacts. Amino acid substitutions can also be made in the domain(s) that form<br>
intermolecular contacts that can improve the activity of the polypeptide. A conservative amino acid<br>
substitution should not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence; e.g., a<br>
replacement amino acid should not alter the anti-parallel p-sheet that makes up the immunoglobulin<br>
binding domain that occurs in the parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that<br>
characterizes the parent sequence. In general, glycine and proline would not be used in an anti-parallel<br>
p-sheet. Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are described in<br>
Proteins. Structures and Molecular Principles (Creighton, Ed., W. H. Freeman and Company, New York<br>
(1984)); Introduction to Protein Structure (C. Branden and J. Tooze, eds., Garland Publishing, New York,<br>
N.Y. (1991)); and Thornton et al., Nature 354:105 (1991), incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Sequence similarity for polypeptides, which is also referred to as sequence identity, is typically<br>
measured using sequence analysis software. Protein analysis software matches similar sequences using<br>
measures of similarity assigned to various substitutions, deletions and other modifications, including<br><br>
-19-<br>
conservative amino acid substitutions. For instance, GCG contains programs such as "Gap" and "Bestfit"<br>
which can be used with default parameters to determine sequence homology or sequence identity<br>
between closely related polypeptides, such as homologous polypeptides from different species of<br>
organisms or between a wild type protein and a mutein thereof. See, e.g., GCG Version 6.1. Polypeptide<br>
sequences also can be compared using FASTA using default or recommended parameters, a program in<br>
GCG Version 6.1. FASTA (e.g., FASTA2 and FASTA3) provides alignments and percent sequence<br>
identity of the regions of the best overlap between the query and search sequences (Pearson, Methods<br>
Enzymol. 183:63-98 (1990); Pearson, Methods Mol. Biol. 132:185-219 (2000)). Another preferred<br>
algorithm when comparing a sequence of the invention to a database containing a large number of<br>
sequences from different organisms is the computer program BLAST, especially blastp or tblastn, using<br>
default parameters. See, e.g., Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410 (1990); Altschul et al., Nucleic<br>
Acids Res. 25:3389-402 (1997); herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The length of polypeptide sequences compared for homology will generally be at least about 16<br>
amino acid residues, usually at least about 20 residues, more usually at least about 24 residues, typically<br>
at least about 28 residues, and preferably more than about 35 residues. When searching a database<br>
containing sequences from a large number of different organisms, it is preferable to compare amino acid<br>
sequences. The term "analog" as used herein refers to polypeptides which are comprised of a segment<br>
of at least 25 amino acids that has substantial identity to a portion of a deduced naturally-occurring amino<br>
acid sequence and which has at least one of the properties of the naturally-occuring polypeoptide.<br>
Typically, polypeptide analogs comprise a conservative amino acid substitution (or addition or deletion)<br>
with respect to the naturally-occurring sequence. Analogs typically are at least 20 amino acids long,<br>
preferably at least 50 amino acids long or longer, and can often be as long as a full-length naturally-<br>
occurring polypeptide.<br>
Peptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as non-peptide drugs with<br>
properties analogous to those of the template peptide. These types of non-peptide compound are termed<br>
"peptide mimetics" or "peptidomimetics". Fauchere, J. Adv. Drug Res. 15:29 (1986); Veberand Freidinger<br>
TINS p.392 (1985); and Evans et al. J. Med. Chem. 30:1229 (1987), which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference. Such compounds are often developed with the aid of computerized molecular modeling.<br>
Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides may be used to<br>
produce an equivalent therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally<br>
similar to a paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a biochemical property or pharmacological<br>
activity), such as human antibody, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage<br>
selected from the group consisting of: โCH2NHโ, โCH2Sโ, โ CH2โCH2โ, โ CH=CHโ (cis and<br>
trans), โCOCH2โ, โCH(OH)CH2โ, and CH2 SOโ, by methods well known in the art. Systematic<br>
substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D-amino acid of the same type<br>
(e.g., D-lysine in place of L-lysine) may be used to generate more stable peptides. In addition,<br>
constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or a substantially identical consensus sequence<br>
variation may be generated by methods known in the art (Rizo and Gierasch.iAnn. Rev. Biochem. 61:387<br><br>
-20-<br>
(1992), incorporated herein by reference); for example, by adding internal cysteine residues capable of<br>
forming intramolecular disulfide bridges which cyclize the peptide.<br>
An intact "antibody" or "immunoglobulin" (Ig) comprises at least two heavy (H) chains (about 50-<br>
70 kDa) and two light (L) chains (about 25 kDa) inter-connected by disulfide bonds. There are only two<br>
types of light chain: A and K. In humans they are similar, but only one type is present in each antibody.<br>
Heavy chains are classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as<br>
lgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. See generally, Fundamental Immunology Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed.,<br>
2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)) (incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the antibody is an IgG and is an lgG1, lgG2, lgG3 or lgG4 subtype. In a more<br>
preferred embodiment, the anti-ALK-1 antibody is subclass lgG2.<br>
Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable domain (VH) and a heavy chain constant<br>
region (CH). The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. Each<br>
light chain is comprised of a light chain variable domain (VL) and a light chain constant region. The light<br>
chain constant region is comprised of one domain, 0.. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and<br>
constant regions are joined by a "J" region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also<br>
including a "D" region of about 3 or more amino acids. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided<br>
into regions of hypervariability, termed "complementarity determining regions" (CDR), interspersed with<br>
regions that are more conserved, termed "framework regions" (FR). Each VH and VL is composed of three<br>
CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxyl-terminus in the following order: FR1,<br>
CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance<br>
with the definitions of Kabat, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of<br>
Health, Bethesda, MD (1987 and 1991)), orChothia &amp; Lesk, J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987); Chothia et<br>
al., Nature 342:878-883 (1989).<br>
The variable domains of each heavy/light chain pair (VH and VL) form the antibody binding site<br>
that interacts with an antigen. Thus, an intact IgG antibody, for example, has two binding sites. Except in<br>
bifunctional or bispecific antibodies, the two binding sites are the same. The constant regions of the<br>
antibodies may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various<br>
cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the classical complement<br>
system.<br>
Antibodies must have enough antigen-binding diversity to recognize every possible pathogen<br>
(many V regions) while maintaining the biological effectiveness of their C regions (few C regions). Ig<br>
genes are randomly spliced together from gene segments that allow many V regions to be used with a<br>
few C regions. Gene segments encoding Ig H, kappa and lambda chains are found on three different<br>
chromosomes. During B cell development, recombinase enzymes remove introns and some exons from<br>
the DNA and splice segments into functional Ig genes.<br>
Ig gene segments in mammals are arranged in groups of "variable" (V), "diversity" (D), "joining"<br>
(J), and "constant" (C) exons. V kappa (VK) segments each encode the first two CDR and three FR of the<br>
kappa chain V region, plus a few residues of CDR3. J kappa (JK) segments each encode the remainder<br>
of CDR3 and the fourth FR. C kappa (CK) encodes the complete C region of the kappa light chain. DNA<br><br>
-21-<br>
encoding human kappa chain includes approximately 40 functional V kappa (VK) segments, five J kappa<br>
(JK) segments, and one C kappa (CK) gene segment, as well as some gene segments which contain stop<br>
codons ("pseudogenes"). Human lambda (A) chain DNA contains approximately 30 functional V lambda<br>
(VA) segments and four functional sets of J lambda (JA) and C lambda (CA) segments. A particular J<br>
lambda (JA) always pairs with its corresponding C lambda (CA), unlike J kappa (JK) which all pair with the<br>
same C kappa (CK). DNA for human H chain includes approximately 50 functional VH segments, 30 DH<br>
segments, and six JH segments. The first two CDR and three FR of the heavy chain variable domain are<br>
encoded by VH. CDR3 is encoded by a few nucleotides of VH, all of DH, and part of JH, while FR4 is<br>
encoded by the remainder of the JH gene segment. There are also individual gene segments in the DNA<br>
for each heavy chain domain and membrane region of each isotype, arranged in the order in which they<br>
are expressed by B cells.<br>
The term "polypeptide" encompasses native or artificial proteins, protein fragments and<br>
polypeptide analogs of a protein sequence. A polypeptide may be monomeric or polymeric.<br>
The term "isolated protein", "isolated polypeptide" or "isolated antibody" is a protein, polypeptide<br>
or antibody that by virtue of its origin or source of derivation (1) is not associated with naturally associated<br>
components that accompany it in its native state, (2) is free of other proteins from the same species, (3) is<br>
expressed by a cell from a different species, or (4) does not occur in nature. Thus, a polypeptide that is<br>
chemically synthesized or synthesized in a cellular system different from the cell from which it naturally<br>
originates will be "isolated" from its naturally associated components. A protein may also be rendered<br>
substantially free of naturally associated components by isolation, using protein purification techniques<br>
well known in the art.<br>
Examples of isolated antibodies include, but not limited to, an anti-ALK-1 antibody that has been<br>
affinity purified using ALK-1, and an anti-ALK-1 antibody that has been synthesized by a cell line in vitro.<br>
A protein or polypeptide is "substantially pure," "substantially homogeneous," or "substantially<br>
purified" when at least about 60 to 75% of a sample exhibits a single species of polypeptide. The<br>
polypeptide or protein may be monomeric or multimeric. A substantially pure polypeptide or protein can<br>
typically comprise about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or 90% w/w of a protein sample, more usually about 95%,<br>
and preferably can be over 99% pure. Protein purity or homogeneity may be indicated by a number of<br>
means well known in the art, such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of a protein sample, followed by<br>
visualizing a single polypeptide band upon staining the gel with a stain well known in the art. For certain<br>
purposes, higher resolution may be provided by using HPLC or other means well known in the art of<br>
purification.<br>
The term "polypeptide fragment" as used herein refers to a polypeptide that has an<br>
amino-terminal and/or carboxy-terminal deletion, but where the remaining amino acid sequence is<br>
identical to the corresponding positions in the naturally-occurring sequence.. In some embodiments,<br>
fragments are at least 5, 6, 8 or 10 amino acids long. In other embodiments, the fragments are at least<br>
14, at least 20, at least 50, or at least 70, 80, 90, 100, 150 or 200 amino acids long.<br>
The term "analog" or "polypeptide analog" as used herein refers to a polypeptide that comprises a<br>
segment that has substantial identity to some reference amino acid sequence and has substantially the<br><br>
-22-<br>
same function or activity as the reference amino acid sequence. Typically, polypeptide analogs comprise<br>
a conservative amino acid substitution (or insertion or deletion) with respect to the reference sequence.<br>
Analogs can be at least 20 or 25 amino acids long, or can be at least 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150 or 200<br>
amino acids long or longer, and can often be as long as the full-length polypeptide. Some embodiments<br>
of the invention include polypeptide fragments or polypeptide analog antibodies with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,<br>
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 or 17 substitutions from the germline amino acid sequence. Fragments or<br>
analogs of antibodies or immunoglobulin molecules can be readily prepared by those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art following the teachings of this specification.<br>
The term "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody (or simply "antibody portion"), as used herein,<br>
refers to one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen (e.g.,<br>
ALK-1 or ECD of ALK-1). It has been shown that the antigen-binding function of an antibody can be<br>
performed by fragments of a full-length antibody. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the<br>
term "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody include (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting<br>
of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) a F(ab')2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab<br>
fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1<br>
domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb<br>
fragment (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341:544-546), which consists of a VH domain; and (vi) an isolated<br>
complementarity determining region (CDR). Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment,<br>
VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a<br>
synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair<br>
to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv)); see e.g., Bird et al. Science 242:423-<br>
426 (1988) and Huston et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883 (1988)). Such single chain<br>
antibodies are also intended to be encompassed within the term "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody.<br>
Other forms of single chain antibodies, such as diabodies are also encompassed. Diabodies are bivalent,<br>
bispecific antibodies in which VH and VL domains are expressed on a single polypeptide chain, but using a<br>
linker that is too short to allow for pairing between the two domains on the same chain, thereby forcing the<br>
domains to pair with complementary domains of another chain and creating two antigen binding sites (see<br>
e.g., Holliger et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448 (1993); Poljak et al. Structure 2:1121-1123<br>
(1994)).<br>
Still further, an antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof may be part of larger immunoadhesion<br>
molecules, formed by covalent or noncovalent association of the antibody or antibody portion with one or<br>
more other proteins or peptides. Examples of such immunoadhesion molecules include use of the<br>
streptavidin core region to make a tetrameric scFv molecule (Kipriyanov et al. Human Antibodies and<br>
Hybridomas 6:93-101 (1995)) and use of a cysteine residue, a marker peptide and a C-terminal<br>
polyhistidine tag to make bivalent and biotinylated scFv molecules (Kipriyanov et al. Mol. Immunol.<br>
31:1047-1058 (1994)). Other examples include where one or more CDRs from an antibody are<br>
incorporated into a molecule either covalently or noncovalently to make it an immunoadhesin that<br>
specifically binds to an antigen of interest, such as ALK-1 or ECD of ALK-1. In such embodiments, the<br><br>
-23-<br>
CDR(s) may be incorporated as part of a larger polypeptide chain, may be covalently linked to another<br>
polypeptide chain, or may be incorporated noncovalently.<br>
Antibody portions, such as Fab and F(ab')2 fragments, can be prepared from whole antibodies<br>
using conventional techniques, such as papain or pepsin digestion, respectively, of whole antibodies.<br>
Moreover, antibodies, antibody portions and immunoadhesion molecules can be obtained using standard<br>
recombinant DNA techniques, as described herein.<br>
As used herein, the term "human antibody" means any antibody in which the variable and<br>
constant domain sequences are human sequences. The term encompasses antibodies with sequences<br>
derived from human genes, but which have been changed, e.g. to decrease possible immunogenicity,<br>
increase affinity, eliminate cysteines that might cause undesirable folding, etc. The term also<br>
encompasses such antibodies produced recombinantly in non-human cells, which might impart<br>
glycosylation not typical of human cells. These antibodies may be prepared in a variety of ways, as<br>
described below.	.-...,<br>
As used herein, the term "neutralizing antibody," "an inhibitory antibody" or antagonist antibody<br>
means an antibody that inhibits the ALK-1/TGF-beta-1/Smad1 signaling pathway. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the antibody inhibits the ALK-1/TGF-beta-1/Smad1 signaling pathway by at least about 20%,<br>
preferably 40%, more preferably 60%, even more preferably 80%, or even more preferably 85%.<br>
Neutralizing or inhibiting potential of human anti-ALK-1 antibodies may be determined, for example, by<br>
their ability to inhibit up-regulation of a specific downstream target gene of ALK-1, Id1, as presented in<br>
Example 12; to inhibit Smadl phosphorylation determined by Western Blotting using Odyssey Infrared<br>
Imaging System from LI-COR Biosciences as presented in Example 13.<br>
The term "chimeric antibody" as used herein means an antibody that comprises regions from two<br>
or more different antibodies. For example, one or more of the CDRs of a chimeric antibody can be<br>
derived from a human anti-ALK-1 antibody. In another example, all of the CDRs can be derived from<br>
human anti-ALK-1 antibodies. In another example, the CDRs from more than one human anti-ALK-1<br>
antibody can be combined in a chimeric antibody. For instance, a chimeric antibody may comprise a<br>
CDR1 from the light chain of a first human anti-ALK-1 antibody, a CDR2 from the light chain of a second<br>
human anti-ALK-1 antibody and a CDR3 from the light chain of a third human anti-ALK-1 antibody, and<br>
CDRs from the heavy chain may be derived from one or more other anti-ALK-1 antibodies. Further, the<br>
framework regions may be derived from one of the anti-ALK-1 antibodies from which one or more of the<br>
CDRs are taken or from one or more different human antibodies. Moreover, as discussed previously<br>
herein, chimeric antibody includes an antibody comprising a portion derived from the germline sequences<br>
of more than one species.<br>
In some embodiments, a chimeric antibody of the invention is a humanized anti-ALK-1 antibody.<br>
A humanized anti-ALK-1 antibody of the invention comprises the amino acid sequence of one or more<br>
framework regions and/or the amino acid sequence from at least a portion of the constant region of one or<br>
more human anti-ALK-1 antibodies of the invention and further comprises sequences derived from a non-<br>
human anti-ALK-1 antibody, for example CDR sequences.<br><br>
-24-<br>
As used herein, the term "ELISA" refers to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. This assay<br>
is well known to those of skill in the art. Examples of this assay can be found in Vaughan, T.J. et al.,<br>
Nature Biotech. 14:309-314 (1996), as well as in Example 2 of the present application.<br>
The term "surface plasmon resonance", as used herein, refers to an optical phenomenon that<br>
allows for the analysis of real-time biospecific interactions by detection of alterations in protein<br>
concentrations within a biosensor matrix, for example using the BIACOREโข system (Pharmacia<br>
Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden and Piscataway, N.J.). For further descriptions, see Jonsson etal., Ann.<br>
Biol. Clin. 51:19-26 (1993); Jonsson etal., Biotechniques 11:620-627 (1991); Jonsson etal., J. Mol.<br>
Recognit. 8:125-131 (1995); and Johnsson etal., Anal. Biochem. 198:268-277 (1991).<br>
The term "affinity" refers to a measure of the attraction between an antigen and an antibody. The<br>
intrinsic attractiveness of the antibody for the antigen is typically expressed as the binding affinity<br>
equilibrium constant (KD) of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. An antibody is said to specifically<br>
bind an antigen when the KD is ยฃ 1 mM, preferably 
measured by surface plasmon resonance, for example using the BIACOREโข system as discussed in<br>
Examples 7 and 8.<br>
The term "koff" refers to the dissociation rate constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.<br>
A koff dissociation rate constant can be measured by surface plasmon resonance, for example using the<br>
BIAcore system as discussed in Examples 7 and 8.<br>
The term "avidity" refers to the functional combining strength of an antibody with its antigen which<br>
is based on both affinity and valences of the antibody. As used herein, this term describes the increased<br>
affinity that occurs as result of multiple antigen binding sites on an immunoglobulin.<br>
As used herein, the term "molecular selectivity" refers to the binding affinity of an antibody for a<br>
specific antigen being greater than for other antigens. For example, the antibodies of the present<br>
invention can be selective for ALK-1 over ALK-2 through ALK-7, meaning that the binding affinity of the<br>
antibody for ALK-1 is at least 2-fold greater, for example 4-fold, or 10-fold, or 50-fold, or 100-fold or more,<br>
than for ALK-2 through ALK-7. Such binding affinities can be measured using standard techniques known<br>
to those of skill in the art.<br>
The term "epitope" includes any protein determinant capable of specific binding to an<br>
immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor or otherwise interacting with a molecule. Epitopic determinants<br>
generally consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or<br>
carbohydrate or sugar side chains and generally have specific three dimensional structural characteristics,<br>
as well as specific charge characteristics. An epitope may be "linear" or "conformational." In a linear<br>
epitope, all of the points of interaction between the protein and the interacting molecule (such as an<br>
antibody) occur linearally along the primary amino acid sequence of the protein. In a conformational<br>
epitope, the points of interaction occur across amino acid residues on the protein that are separated from<br>
one another. Once a desired epitope on an antigen is determined, it is possible to generate antibodies to<br>
that epitope, e.g., using the techniques described in the present invention. Alternatively, during the<br>
discovery process, the generation and characterization of antibodies may elucidate information about<br>
desirable epitopes. From this information, it is then possible to competitively screen antibodies for binding<br><br>
-25-<br>
to the same epitope. An approach to achieve this is to conduct cross-competition studies to find<br>
antibodies that competitively bind with one another, i.e. the antibodies compete for binding to the antigen.<br>
A high throughput process for "binning" antibodies based upon their cross-competition is described in<br>
International Patent Application No. WO 03/48731.<br>
As used herein, the term "binning" refers to a method to group antibodies based on their antigen<br>
binding characteristics. The assignment of bins is somewhat arbitrary, depending on how different are the<br>
observed binding patterns for all the antibodies tested. Therefore, bins do not always correlate with<br>
epitopes determined by other means.and should not be used to define epitopes.<br>
The term "compete", as used herein with regard to an antibody, means that a first antibody, or an<br>
antigen-binding portion thereof, competes for binding to the antigen with a second antibody, or an antigen-<br>
binding portion thereof, where binding of the first antibody with its cognate epitope is detectably<br>
decreased in the presence of the second antibody compared to the binding of the first antibody in the<br>
absence of the second antibody. The alternative, where the binding of the second antibody to its epitope<br>
is also detectably decreased in the presence of the first antibody, can, but need not be the case. That is,<br>
a first antibody can inhibit the binding of a second antibody to its epitope without that second antibody<br>
inhibiting the binding of the first antibody to its respective epitope. However, where each antibody<br>
detectably inhibits the binding of the other antibody with its cognate epitope or ligand, whether to the<br>
same, greater, or lesser extent, the antibodies are said to "cross-compete" with each other for binding of<br>
their respective epitope(s). Both competing and cross-competing antibodies are encompassed by the<br>
present invention. Regardless of the mechanism by which such competition or cross-competition occurs<br>
(e.g., steric hindrance, conformational change, or binding to a common epitope, or portion thereof, and the<br>
like), the skilled artisan would appreciate, based upon the teachings provided herein, that such competing<br>
and/or cross-competing antibodies are encompassed and can be useful for the methods disclosed herein.<br>
The term "polynucleotide" as referred to herein means a polymeric form of nucleotides of at least<br>
10 bases in length, either ribonucleotides or deoxynucleotides or a modified form of either type of<br>
nucleotide. The term includes single and double stranded forms.<br>
The term "isolated polynucleotide" as used herein means a polynucleotide of genomic, cDNA, or<br>
synthetic origin or some combination thereof, which by virtue of its origin the "isolated polynucleotide" (1)<br>
is not associated with all or a portion of polynucleotides with which the "isolated polynucleotide" is found in<br>
nature, (2) is operably linked to a polynucleotide to which it is not linked in nature, or (3) does not occur in<br>
nature as part of a larger sequence.<br>
The term "naturally occurring nucleotides" as used herein includes deoxyribonucleotides and<br>
ribonucleotides. The term "modified nucleotides" as used herein includes nucleotides with modified or<br>
substituted sugar groups and the like. The term "oligonucleotide linkages" referred to herein includes<br>
oligonucleotides linkages such as phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselenoate,<br>
phosphorodiselenoate, phosphoroanilothioate, phoshoraniladate, phosphoroamidate, and the like. See<br>
e.g., LaPlanche etal., Nucl. Acids Res. 14:9081 (1986); Stec etai., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 106:6077 (1984);<br>
Stein etal., Nucl. Acids Res. 16:3209 (1988); Zon etal., Anti-Cancer Drug Design 6:539 (1991); Zon<br>
etal., Oligonucleotides and Analogues: A Practical Approach, pp. 87-108 (F. Eckstein, Ed., Oxford<br><br>
-26-<br>
University Press, Oxford England (1991)); U.S. Patent No. 5,151,510; Uhlmann and Peyman, Chemical<br>
Reviews 90:543 (1990), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. An<br>
oligonucleotide can include a label for detection, if desired.<br>
"Operably linked" sequences include both expression control sequences that are contiguous with<br>
the gene of interest and expression control sequences that act in trans or at a distance to control the gene<br>
of interest.<br>
The term "expression control sequence" as used herein means polynucleotide sequences that are<br>
necessary to effect the expression and processing of coding sequences to which they are ligated.<br>
Expression control sequences include appropriate transcription initiation, termination, promoter and<br>
enhancer sequences; efficient RNA processing signals such as splicing and polyadenylation signals;<br>
sequences that stabilize cytoplasmic mRNA; sequences that enhance translation efficiency (i.e., Kozak<br>
consensus sequence); sequences that enhance protein stability; and when desired, sequences that<br>
enhance protein secretion. The nature of such control sequences differs depending upon the host<br>
organism; in prokaryotes, such control sequences generally include promoter, ribosomal binding site, and<br>
transcription termination sequence; in eukaryotes, generally, such control sequences include promoters<br>
and transcription termination sequence. The term "control sequences" is intended to include, at a<br>
minimum, all components whose presence is essential for expression and processing, and can also<br>
include additional components whose presence is advantageous, for example, leader sequences and<br>
fusion partner sequences.	...<br>
The term "vector", as used herein, means a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another<br>
nucleic acid to which it has been linked. In some embodiments, the vector is a plasmid, i.e., a circular<br>
double stranded piece of DNA into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. In some<br>
embodiments, the vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral<br>
genome. In some embodiments, the vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into<br>
which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal<br>
mammalian vectors). In other embodiments, the vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) can be<br>
integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated<br>
along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes<br>
to which they are operatively linked. Such .vectors are referred to herein as "recombinant expression<br>
vectors" (or simply, "expression vectors").<br>
The term "recombinant host cell" (or simply "host cell"), as used herein, means a cell into which a<br>
recombinant expression vector has been introduced. It should be understood that "recombinant host cell"<br>
and "host cell" mean not only the particular subject cell but also the progeny of such a cell. Because<br>
certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or environmental<br>
influences, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the<br>
scope of the term "host cell" as used herein.<br>
As used herein, the term "germline" refers to the nucleotide sequences and amino acid<br>
sequences of the antibody genes and gene segments as they are passed from parents to offspring via the<br>
germ cells. This germline sequence is distinguished from the nucleotide sequences encoding antibodies<br><br>
-27-<br>
in mature B cells which have been altered by recombination and hypermutation events during the course<br>
of B cell maturation. An antibody that "utilizes" a particular germline has a nucleotide or amino acid<br>
sequence that most closely aligns with that germline nucleotide sequence or with the amino acid<br>
sequence that it specifies. Such antibodies frequently are mutated compared with the germline sequence.<br>
The term "percent sequence identity" in the context of nucleic acid sequences means the residues<br>
in two sequences that are the same when aligned for maximum correspondence. The length of sequence<br>
identity comparison may be over a stretch of at least about nine nucleotides, usually at least about 18<br>
nucleotides, more usually at least about 24 nucleotides, typically at least about 28 nucleotides, more<br>
typically at least about 32 nucleotides, and preferably at least about 36, 48 or more nucleotides. There<br>
are a number of different algorithms known in the art which can be used to measure nucleotide sequence<br>
identity. For instance, polynucleotide sequences can be compared using FASTA, Gap or Bestfit, which<br>
are programs in Wisconsin Package Version 10.0, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison,<br>
Wisconsin. FASTA, which includes, e.g., the programs FASTA2 and FASTA3, provides alignments and<br>
percent sequence identity of the regions of the best overlap between the query and search sequences<br>
(Pearson, Methods Enzymol. 183:63-98 (1990); Pearson, Methods Mol. Biol. 132:185-219 (2000);<br>
Pearson, Methods Enzymol. 266:227-258 (1996); Pearson, J. Mol. Biol. 276:71-84 (1998); incorporated<br>
herein by reference). Unless otherwise specified, default parameters for a particular program or algorithm<br>
are used. For instance, percent sequence identity between nucleic acid sequences can be determined<br>
using FASTA with its default parameters (a word size of 6 and the NOPAM factor for the scoring matrix) or<br>
using Gap with its default parameters as provided in GCG Version 6.1, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A reference to a nucleotide sequence encompasses its complement unless otherwise specified.<br>
Thus, a reference to a nucleic acid having a particular sequence should be understood to encompass its<br>
complementary strand, with its complementary sequence.<br>
The term "substantial similarity" or "substantial sequence similarity," when referring to a nucleic<br>
acid or fragment thereof, means that when optimally aligned with appropriate nucleotide insertions or<br>
deletions with another nucleic acid (or its complementary strand), there is nucleotide sequence identity in<br>
at least about 85%, preferably at least about 90%, and more preferably at least about 95%, 96%, 97%,<br>
98% or 99% of the nucleotide bases, as measured by any well-known algorithm of sequence identity,<br>
such as FASTA, BLAST or Gap, as discussed above.<br>
The term "percent sequence identity" in the context of amino acid sequences means the residues<br>
in two sequences that are the same when aligned for maximum correspondence. The length of sequence<br>
identity comparison may be over a stretch of at least about five amino acids, usually at least about 20<br>
amino acids, more usually at least about 30 amino acids, typically at least about 50 amino acids, more<br>
typically at least about 100 amino acids, and even more typically about 150, 200 or more amino acids.<br>
There are a number of different algorithms known in the art that can be used to measure amino acid<br>
sequence identity. For instance, amino acid sequences can be compared using FASTA, Gap or Bestfit,<br>
which are programs in Wisconsin Package Version 10.0, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison,<br>
Wisconsin.<br><br>
-28-<br>
As applied to polypeptides, the term "substantial identity" or "substantial similarity" means that two<br>
amino acid sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default<br>
gap weights as supplied with the programs, share at least 70%, 75% or 80% sequence identity, preferably<br>
at least 90% or 95% sequence identity, and more preferably at least 97%, 98% or 99% sequence identity.<br>
In certain embodiments, residue positions that are not identical differ by conservative amino acid<br>
substitutions.<br>
The term "signal sequence," also called signal peptide, leader peptide, refers to a segment of<br>
about 15 to 30 amino acids at the N terminus of a protein that enables the protein to be secreted (pass<br>
through a cell membrane). The signal sequence is removed as the protein is secreted.<br>
As used herein, the terms "label" or "labeled" refers to incorporation of another molecule in the<br>
antibody. In one embodiment, the label is a detectable marker, e.g., incorporation of a radiolabeled amino<br>
acid or attachment to a polypeptide of biotinyl moieties that can be detected by marked avidin (e.g.,<br>
streptavidin containing a fluorescent marker or enzymatic activity that can be detected by optical or<br>
colorimetric methods). In another embodiment, the label or marker can be therapeutic, e.g., a drug<br>
conjugate or toxin. Various methods of labeling polypeptides and glycoproteins are known in the art and<br>
may be used. Examples of labels for polypeptides include, but are not limited to, the following:<br>
radioisotopes or radionuclides (e.g., 3H, 14C, 15N, 35S, 90Y, 99Tc, 111ln, 125l, 131l), fluorescent labels (e.g.,<br>
FITC, rhodamine, lanthanide phosphors), enzymatic labels (e.g., horseradish peroxidase,<br>
P-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase), chemiluminescent markers, biotinyl groups,<br>
predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary reporter (e.g., leucine zipper pair<br>
sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal binding domains, epitope tags), magnetic<br>
agents, such as gadolinium chelates, toxins such as pertussis toxin, taxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D,<br>
ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicine,<br>
doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, mithramycin, actinomycin D,<br>
1-dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and<br>
analogs or homologs thereof. In some embodiments, labels are attached by spacer arms of various<br>
lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance.<br>
The term "primate" refers to a mammal of the order primates, which includes the anthropoids and<br>
prosimians, characterized by refined development of the hands and feet, a shortened snout, and a large<br>
brain. The mammalian order Primates includes humans, apes, monkeys, and prosimians, or lower<br>
primates.<br>
"Therapeutically effective amount" refers to that amount of the therapeutic agent being<br>
administered which will relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the disorder being treated.<br>
In reference to the treatment of cancer, a therapeutically effective amount refers to that amount which has<br>
at least one of the following effects: reducing the size of the tumor; inhibiting (that is, slowing to some<br>
extent, preferably stopping) tumor metastasis; inhibiting to some extent (that is, slowing to some extent,<br>
. preferably stopping) tumor growth, and relieving to some extent (or, preferably, eliminating) one or more<br>
symptoms associated with the cancer.<br><br>
-29-<br>
"Treat", "treating" and "treatment" refer to a method of alleviating or abrogating a biological<br>
disorder and/or its, attendant symptoms. With regard to cancer, these terms simply mean that the life<br>
expectancy of an individual affected with a cancer will be increased or that one or more of the symptoms<br>
of the disease will be reduced.<br>
"Contacting" refers to bringing an antibody or antigen binding portion thereof of the present<br>
invention and a target ALK-1, or epitiope thereof, together in such a manner that the antibody can affect<br>
the biological activity of the ALK-1. Such "contacting" can be accomplished "in vitro," i.e., in a test tube, a<br>
petri dish, or the like. In a test tube, contacting may involve only an antibody or antigen binding portion<br>
thereof and ALK-1 or epitope thereof or it may involve whole cells. Cells may also be maintained or<br>
grown in cell culture dishes and contacted with antibodies or antigen binding portions thereof in that<br>
environment. In this context, the ability of a particular antibody or antigen binding portion thereof to affect<br>
a ALK-1-related disorder, i.e., the IC50 of the antibody, can be determined before use of the antibody in<br>
vivo with more complex living organisms is attempted. For cells outside the organism, multiple methods<br>
exist, and are well-known to those skilled in the art, to contact ALK-1 with the antibodies or antigen-<br>
. binding portions thereof.<br>
The acronym "FACS" refers to Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting. The acronym FACS and flow<br>
cytometry are used interchangeably. Fluorescent labeling allows investigation of cell structure and<br>
function. Immunofluorescence, the most widely used application, involves the staining of cells with<br>
antibodies conjugated to fluorescent dyes such as fluorescein and phycoerythrin. This method is often<br>
used to label molecules on the cell surface, but antibodies can be directed at targets in cytoplasm. In<br>
direct immunofluorescence an antibody to a molecule is directly conjugated to a fluorescent dye, and cells<br>
are stained in one step. In indirect immunofluorescence the primary antibodyis not labeled, and a second<br>
fluorescently conjugated antibody is added which is specific for the first antibody.<br>
Anti-ALK-1 Antibodies<br>
This invention pertains to isolated neutralizing anti-ALK-1 monoclonal antibodies or antigen-<br>
binding portions thereof that bind to primate ALK-1, preferably the ECD of primate ALK-1, more preferably<br>
the ECD of human ALK-1. In a preferred embodiment, the invention pertains to isolated neutralizing<br>
antibodies that are fully human monoclonal antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof. Preferably, the<br>
human antibodies are recombinant human anti-ALK-1 antibodies that have greater affinity for ALK-1 than<br>
for ALK-2 through ALK-7. In some embodiments, human anti-ALK-1 antibodies are produced by<br>
immunizing a non-human transgenic animal, e.g., a rodent, whose genome comprises human<br>
immunoglobulin genes so that the transgenic animal produces human antibodies. Various aspects of the<br>
invention relate to such antibodies and antigen-binding portions, and pharmaceutical compositions<br>
thereof, as well as nucleic acids, recombinant expression vectors and host cells for making such<br>
antibodies and antigen-binding portions. Methods of using the antibodies and antigen-binding portions of<br>
the present invention to abrogate the ALK-1/ TGF-beta-1 /Smadl signaling pathway or to detect ALK-1,<br>
either in vitro or in vivo, are also encompassed by the invention.<br><br>

An anti-ALK-1 antibody of the invention can comprise a human kappa or a human lambda light<br>
chain or an amino acid sequence derived therefrom. In some embodiments comprising a kappa light<br>
chain, the light chain variable domain (VL) utilizes a human A27, A2, A1, A3, B3, B2, L1 or L2 VKgene. In<br>
some embodiments, the light chain utilizes a human VK L1 gene and a human JK 4 gene; a human VK A27<br>
gene and a human JK 5 gene or a human JK 4 gene; a human VK B3 gene and a human JK 1 gene; a<br>
human VK L2 gene and a human JK 3 gene; a human Vยซ A2 gene and a human JK 1 gene; a human Vยซ A3<br>
gene and a human JK 4 gene; a human VK A1 gene and a human JK 1 gene; a human VK B2 gene and a<br>
human JK 4 gene; or a human VK A2 gene and a human JK 1 gene.<br>
In some embodiments, the VL of the anti-ALK-1 antibody comprises one or more amino acid<br>
substitutions, deletions or insertions (additions) relative to the germline VK amino acid sequence. In some<br>
embodiments, the VL of the anti-ALK-1 antibody comprises 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15<br>
amino acid substitutions relative to the germline VK amino acid sequence. In some embodiments, one or<br>
more of the substitutions from germline is in the CDR regions of the light chain. In some embodiments,<br>
the VK amino acid substitutions relative to germline are at one or more of the same positions as the<br>
substitutions relative to germline found in any one or more of the VL of the antibodies provided herein as<br>
shown, for example, at Figure 7. In some embodiments, the amino acid changes are at one or more of<br>
the same positions, but involve a different substitution than in the reference antibody.<br>
In some embodiments, amino acid substitutions relative to germline occur at one or more of the<br>
same positions as substitutions from germline in any of the VL of antibodies 1.11.1; 1.12.1; 1.12.1(rWT);<br>

represent conservative amino acid substitutions at such position(s) relative to the amino acid in the<br>
reference antibody. For example, if a particular position in one of these antibodies is changed relative to<br>
germline and is glutamate, one may substitute aspartate at that position. Similarly, if an amino acid<br>
substitution compared to germline in an exemplified antibody is serine, one may conservatively substitute<br>
threonine for serine at that position. Conservative amino acid substitutions are discussed supra.<br>

serine. In one embodiment, there is a substitution of a non-canonical cysteine. The substitution can be<br>
made in a CDR or framework region of a variable domain or in the constant domain of an antibody. In<br>
some embodiments, the cysteine is canonical.<br>
Another type of amino acid substitution that may be made is to remove potential proteolytic sites<br>
in the antibody. Such sites may occur in a CDR or framework region of a variable domain or in the<br>
constant domain of an antibody. Substitution of cysteine residues and removal of proteolytic sites may<br>
decrease the risk of heterogeneity in the antibody product and thus increase its homogeneity. Another<br>
type of amino acid substitution is to eliminate asparagine-glycine pairs, which form potential deamidation<br>
sites, by altering one or both of the residues.<br>
In some embodiments, the C-terminal lysine of the heavy chain of the anti ALK-1 antibody of the<br>
invention is cleaved. In various embodiments of the invention, the heavy and light chains of the anti-ALK-<br>
1 antibodies may optionally include a signal sequence.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides twenty five inhibitory human anti-ALK-1 monoclonal<br>
antibodies and the hybridoma cell lines that produce them. In certain embodiments, antibodies of the<br>
present invention are IgGs designated as: 1.11.1; 1.12.1; 1.12.1(rWT); 1.12.1(M29I/D19A); 1.12.1(M29I);<br>

preferred embodiments, the human anti-ALK-1 antibody is antibody 1.12.1, 1.12.1(M29I/D19A),<br>
1.12.1(M29I), 1.12.1(D19A), 1.27.1, 1.14.1, 1.162.1, 1.31.1, 4.62.1 or 4.72.1.<br>
Antibodies recognize surface-exposed epitopes on antigens as regions of linear (primary)<br>
sequence or structural (secondary) sequence. BIAcore was used in order to define the functional epitope<br>
landscape and determine the epitope exclusivity of the anti-ALK-1 antibodies exemplified by this<br>
invention.<br>
Table 1 lists the sequence identifiers (SEQ ID NO) of the nucleic acids encoding the full-length<br>
heavy and light chains of 1.12.1 antibody variants and variable domain-containing portions of anti-ALK-1<br>

1.12.1(M29I/D19A) refers to the anti-ALK-1 antibody containing a specific single amino acid<br>
mutation in the heavy chain where the methionine at position 29 was replaced with isoleucine and a<br>
specific single amino acid mutation in the light chain where the aspartic acid at position 19 was replaced<br>
with alanine as described in Example 4.<br>
1.12.1 refers to the mAb 1.12.1 variant that was isolated from the hybridoma.<br>
1.12.1(rWT) refers to the mAb 1.12.1 variant that was expressed as a recombinant mAb<br>
described in Example 3.<br><br>
-35-<br>
The invention further provides heavy and/or light chain variants of certain of the above-listed<br>
human anti-ALK-1 antibodies, comprising one or more amino acid modifications. To designate the<br>
variants, the first letter is the one letter symbol for the amino acid of the naturally-occurring antibody chain,<br>
the number refers to the position of the amino acid (wherein position one is the N-terminal amino acid of<br>
the FR1), and the second letter is the one letter symbol for the variant amino acid.<br>
In still further embodiments, the invention includes antibodies comprising variable domain amino<br>
acid sequences with more than 80%, more than 85%, more than 90%, more than 95%, more than 96%,<br>
more than 97%, more than 98% or more than 99% sequence identity to a variable domain amino acid<br>
sequence of any of the above-listed human anti-ALK-1 antibodies.<br>
Class and Subclass of Anti-ALK-1 Antibodies<br>
The class and subclass of anti-ALK-1 antibodies may be determined by any method known in the<br>
art. In general, the class and subclass of an antibody may be determined using antibodies that are<br>
specific for a particular class and subclass of antibody. Such antibodies are available commercially. The<br>
class and subclass can be determined by ELISA, Western Blot as well as other techniques. Alternatively,<br>
the class and subclass may be determined by sequencing all or a portion of the constant domains of the<br>
heavy and/or light chains of the antibodies, comparing their amino acid sequences to the known amino<br>
acid sequences of various class and subclasses of immunoglobulins, and determining the class and<br>
subclass of the antibodies.<br>
The class of an anti-ALK-1 antibody obtained as described above may be switched with another.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, a nucleic acid molecule encoding VL or VH is isolated using methods well-<br>
known in the art such that it does not include nucleic acid sequences encoding CL or CH. "Antibody<br>
Engineering" (Kontermann &amp; Dubel, Eds., Springer-Verlag, Berlin (2001)). The nucleic acid molecules<br>
encoding VL or VH are then operatively linked to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a CL or CH,<br>
respectively, from a different class of immunoglobulin molecule. This may be achieved using a vector or<br>
nucleic acid molecule that comprises a CL or CH chain, as described above. For example, an anti-ALK-1<br>
antibody that was originally IgM may be class switched to an IgG. Further, the class switching may be<br>
used to convert one IgG subclass to another, e.g., from lgG1 to lgG2. A preferred method for producing<br>
an antibody of the invention comprising a desired isotypes comprises the steps of isolating a nucleic acid<br>
molecule encoding the heavy chain of an anti-ALK-1 antibody and a nucleic acid molecule encoding the<br>
light chain of an anti-ALK-1 antibody, obtaining the variable domain of the heavy chain, ligating the<br>
variable domain of the heavy chain with the constant domain of a heavy chain of the desired isotype,<br>
expressing the light chain and the ligated heavy chain in a cell, and collecting the anti-ALK-1 antibody with<br>
the desired isotype.<br>
In some embodiments, the anti-ALK-1 antibody is a monoclonal antibody. The anti-ALK-1<br>
antibody can be an IgG, an IgM, an IgE, an IgA, or an IgD molecule. In a preferred embodiment, the anti-<br>
ALK-1 antibody is an IgG and is an lgG1, lgG2, lgG3, lgG4 subclass. In another preferred embodiment,<br>
the antibody is subclass lgG2.<br><br>
-36-<br>
Identification of ALK-1 Epitopes Recognized by Anti-ALK-1 Antibodies<br>
The invention provides a human anti-ALK-1 monoclonal antibody that binds to ALK-1 and<br>
competes or cross-competes with and/or binds the same epitope as: (a) an antibody selected from 1.11.1;<br>
1.12.1; 1.12.1(rWT); 1.12.1(M29I/D19A); 1.12.1(M29I); 1.12.1(D19A); 1.13.1; 1.14.1; 1.151.1; 1.162.1;<br>
1.183.1; 1.27.1; 1.29.1; 1.31.1; 1.8.1; 1.9.1; 4.10.1; 4.24.1; 4.38.1; 4.58.1; 4.62.1; 4.68.1; 4.72.1; 5.13.1;<br>
5.34.1; 5.53.1; 5.56.1; 5.57.1; and 5.59.1; (b) an antibody that comprises a heavy chain variable domain<br>
having the amino acid sequence of the VH domain in any one of SEQ ID NOS: 6; 10; 14; 18; 22; 26; 30;<br>
34; 38; 42; 46; 50; 54; 58; 62; 66; 70; 74; 78; 82; 86; 90 or 104, (c) an antibody that comprises a light<br>
chain variable domain having the amino acid sequence of the VL domain in any one of SEQ ID NOS: and<br>
8; 12; 16; 20; 24; 28; 32; 36; 40; 44; 48; 52; 56; 60; 64; 68; 72; 76; 80; 84; 88; 92 or 127, (d) an antibody<br>
that comprises both a heavy chain variable domain as defined in (b) and a light chain variable domain as<br>
defined in (c).<br>
One can determine whether an antibody binds to the same epitope or cross competes for binding<br>
with an anti-ALK-1 antibody by using methods known in the art. In one embodiment, one allows the anti-<br>
ALK-1 antibody of the invention to bind to ALK-1 under saturating conditions and then measures the<br>
ability of the test antibody to bind to ALK-1. If the test antibody is able to bind to ALK-1 at the same time<br>
as the reference anti-ALK-1 antibody, then the test antibody binds to a different epitope than the reference<br>
anti-ALK-1 antibody. However, if the test antibody is not able to bind to ALK-1 at the same time, then the<br>
test antibody binds to the same epitope, an overlapping epitope, or an epitope that is in close proximity to<br>
the epitope bound by the anti-ALK-1 antibody of the invention. This experiment can be performed using<br>
ELISA, RIA, BIACOREโข, or flow cytometry. To test whether an anti-ALK-1 antibody cross-competes with<br>
another anti-ALK-1 antibody, one may use the competition method described above in two directions, i.e.<br>
determining if the known antibody blocks the test antibody and vice versa. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
experiment is performed using BIACOREโข.<br>
Binding Affinity of Anti-ALK-1 Antibodies to ALK-1<br>
The binding affinity (KD) and dissociation rate (koff) of an anti-ALK-1 antibody or antigen-binding<br>
portion thereof to ALK-1 can be determined by methods known in the art. The binding affinity can be<br>
measured by ELISAs, RIAs, flow cytometry, or surface plasmon resonance, such as BIACOREโข. The<br>
dissociation rate can be measured by surface plasmon resonance. Preferably, the binding affinity and<br>
dissociation rate is measured by surface plasmon resonance. More preferably, the binding affinity and<br>
dissociation rate are measured using BIACOREโข. One can determine whether an antibody has<br>
substantially the same KD as an anti-ALK-1 antibody by using methods known in the art. Such methods, of<br>
determining KD and k0ff can be used during the initial screening stage, as well as during subsequent<br>
optimization stages.<br><br>
-37-<br>
Inhibition of ALK-1 Activity by Anti-ALK-1 Antibody<br>
Anti-ALK-1 monoclonal antibodies that inhibit ALK-1 binding can be identified using a number of<br>
assays. For example, neutralizing anti-ALK-1 antibodies can be identified by their inhibition of up-<br>
regulation of a specific downstream target gene of ALK-1, Id1, as described in Example 12. Preferred<br>
anti-ALK-1 antibodies have an IC50 of no more than 500 nM, 300 nM, 200 nM, 150 nM, 100 nM, 50 nM, 20<br>
nM, 10 nM, or 1 nM.<br>
One also can determine the ability of an anti-ALK-1 antibody to inhibit Smadl phosphorylation<br>
determined by Western Blotting using Odyssey Infrared Imaging System, as described in Example 13. In<br>
various embodiments, the anti-ALK-1 antibody has an IC5o in this assay of no more than 250 nM, 200 nM,<br>
150 nM, 100 nM, 50 nM, 20 nM, 10 nM, or 1nM.<br>
Inhibition of Angioqenesis by Anti-ALK-1 Antibody<br>
In another embodiment, the anti-ALK-1 antibody or portion thereof inhibits human vessel,<br>
angiogenesis as demonstrated in a SCID mouse engrafted with human foreskin tissue, in which human<br>
melanoma M24met tumor cells are intradermal implanted as determined by lHC analysis of human CD-<br>
31 signal assay by a factor of at least 40% as compared to a control sample as as described in Example<br>
17 and shown in Table 13.<br>
In another embodiment, the anti-ALK-1 antibody or portion thereof inhibits human vessel<br>
angiogenesis as demonstrated in a SCID mouse engrafted with human foreskin tissue, in which collagen<br>
is intradermally implanted as determined by IHC analysis of human CD-31 signal assay by a factor of at<br>
least 50% as compared to a control sample as described in Example 16 and shown in Table 12.<br>
Species and Molecular Selectivity<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the anti-ALK-1 antibodies demonstrate both species and<br>
molecular selectivity. Following the teachings of the specification, one may determine the species or<br>
molecular selectivity for the anti-ALK-1 antibody using methods well known in the art. For instance, one<br>
may determine the species selectivity using Western blot, surface plasmon resonance, e.g., BIAcore,<br>
ELISA, immunoprecipitation or RIA.<br>
In some embodiments, the anti-ALK-1 antibody binds to primate ALK-1 with a KD that is at least<br>
two times smaller than its KD for rodent ALK-1. In a further embodiment, the KD for primate ALK-1 is at<br>
least 3-fold, at least 10-fold, at least 50-fold, at least 100-fold, at least 200-fold, at least 500-fold, or at<br>
least 1000-fold smaller than its KD for rodent ALK-1 as measured by flow cytometry.<br>
In other embodiments, the anti-ALK-1 antibody has a selectivity for ALK-1 over ALK-2 through<br>
ALK-7. In some embodiments, the anti-ALK-1 antibody does not exhibit any appreciable specific binding<br>
to any other protein other than ALK-1. Preferably, the anti-ALK-1 antibody binds to the ECD of human<br>
ALK-1.<br><br>
-38-<br>
Methods of Producing Antibodies and Antibody Producing Cell Lines<br>
ALK-1 Immunogen<br>
In some embodiments, the ALK-1 immunogen or antigen is isolated and/or purified ALK-1. In<br>
some embodiments, the ALK-1 immunogen is human ALK-1. In preferred embodiments, the ALK-1<br>
immunogen is the ECD of human ALK-1. Human ALK-1, or antigenic portions thereof, can be prepared<br>
according to methods well known to those in the art, or can be purchased from commercial vendors. The<br>
human ALK-1 amino acid and nucleotide sequences are known (see e.g. Genbank record Accession No.<br>
L17075). ACVRL1 gene encoding a full-lentgh ALK-1 is commercially available from Invitrogen Inc.,<br>
Clone ID IOH21048. For example, R&amp;D Systems, Inc. sells the recombinant human ALK-1/Fc chimera<br>
(Catalog Number 370-AL) prepared by expression of a DNA sequence encoding the ECD amino acid<br>
residues 1-118 of ALK-1, which DNA sequence was fused to a DNA sequence encoding the Fc region of<br>
human IgG via a DNA sequence encoding a polypeptide linker in a mouse myeloma cell line. The<br>
recombinant mature human ALK-1/Fc chimera is a disulfide-linked homodimeric protein having Asp 22 at<br>
the amino-terminus. In addition, Example 1 describes preparation of ALK-1 ECD His-Tag protein which<br>
has been used for generation of hybridomas producing an anti-ALK-1 antibody according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
In other embodiments, the ALK-1 antigen is a cell that expresses or overexpresses ALK-1. In<br>
other embodiments, the ALK-1 antigen is a recombinant protein expressed from yeast, insect cells,<br>
bacteria such as E. coli, or other resources by recombinant technology.<br>
Immunization<br>
In some embodiments, human antibodies are produced by immunizing a non-human, transgenic<br>
animal comprising within its genome some or all of human immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain<br>
loci with a ALK-1 antigen. In a preferred embodiment, the non-human animal is a XENOMOUSEยฎ<br>
animal. (Abgenix, Inc., Fremont, CA).<br>
XENOMOUSEยฎ mice are engineered mouse strains that comprise large fragments of human<br>
immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain loci and are deficient in mouse antibody production. See,<br>
e.g., Green etal., Nature Genetics 7:13-21 (1994) and U.S. Patents 5,916,771, 5,939,598, 5,985,615,<br>
5,998,209, 6,075,181, 6,091,001, 6,114,598, 6,130,364, 6,162,963 and 6,150,584. See also WO<br>
91/10741, WO 94/02602, WO 96/34096, WO 96/33735, WO 98/16654, WO 98/24893, WO 98/50433, WO<br>
99/45031, WO 99/53049, WO 00/09560, and WO 00/037504.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a method for making anti-ALK-1 antibodies from non-<br>
human, non-mouse animals by immunizing non-human transgenic animals that comprise human<br>
immunoglobulin loci with an ALK-1 antigen. One can produce such animals using the methods described<br>
in the above-cited documents. The methods disclosed in these documents can be modified as described<br>
in U.S. Patent 5,994,619, which is hereby incorporated by reference. U.S. Patent 5,994,619 describes<br>
methods for producing novel cultured inner cell mass (CICM) cells and cell lines, derived from pigs and<br>
cows, and transgenic CICM cells into which heterologous DNA has been inserted. CICM transgenic cells<br><br>
-39-<br>
can be used to produce cloned transgenic embryos, fetuses, and offspring. The '619 patent also<br>
describes methods of producing transgenic animals that are capable of transmitting the heterologous DNA<br>
to their progeny. In preferred embodiments of the current invention, the non-human animals are<br>
mammals, particularly rats, sheep, pigs, goats, cattle, horses or chickens.<br>
XENOMOUSEยฎ mice produce an adult-like human repertoire of fully human antibodies and<br>
generate antigen-specific human antibodies. In some embodiments, the XENOMOUSEยฎ mice contain<br>
approximately 80% of the human antibody V gene repertoire through introduction of megabase sized,<br>
germline configuration fragments of the human heavy chain loci and kappa light chain loci in yeast<br>
artificial chromosome (YAC). In other embodiments, XENOMOUSEยฎ mice further contain approximately<br>
all of the human lambda light chain locus. See Mendez et a!., Nature Genetics 15:146-156 (1997), Green<br>
and Jakobovits, J. Exp. Med. 188:483-495 (1998), and WO 98/24893, the disclosures of which are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
In some embodiments, the non-human animal comprising human immunoglobulin genes are<br>
animals that have a human immunoglobulin "minilocus". In the minilocus approach, an exogenous Ig<br>
locus is mimicked through the inclusion of individual genes from the Ig locus. Thus, one or more VH<br>
genes, one or more DH genes, one or more JH genes, a mu constant domain, and a second constant<br>
domain (preferably a gamma constant domain) are formed into a construct for insertion into an animal.<br>
This approach is described, inter alia, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,545,807, 5,545,806, 5,569,825, 5,625,126,<br>
5,633,425, 5,661,016, 5,770,429, 5,789,650, 5,814,318, 5,591,669, 5,612,205, 5,721,367, 5,789,215, and<br>
5,643,763, hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a method for making humanized anti-ALK-1 antibodies.<br>
In some embodiments, non-human animals are immunized with a ALK-1 antigen as described below<br>
under conditions that permit antibody production. Antibody-producing cells are isolated from the animals,<br>
and nucleic acids encoding the heavy and light chains of an anti-ALK-1 antibody of interest are isolated<br>
from the isolated antibody-producing cells or from an immortalized cell line produced from such cells.<br>
These nucleic acids are subsequently engineered using techniques known to those of skill in the art and<br>
as described further below to reduce the amount of non-human sequence, i.e., to humanize the antibody<br>
to reduce the immune response in humans,<br>
Immunization of animals can be by any method known in the art. See, e.g., Harlow and Lane,<br>
Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, New York: Cold Spring Harbor Press, 1990. Methods for immunizing<br>
non-human animals such as mice, rats, sheep, goats, pigs, cattle and horses are well known in the art.<br>
See, e.g., Harlow and Lane, supra, and U.S. Patent 5,994,619. In a preferred embodiment, the ALK-1<br>
antigen is administered with an adjuvant to stimulate the immune response. Exemplary adjuvants include<br>
complete or incomplete Freund's adjuvant, RIBi (muramyl dipeptides) or ISCOM (immunostimulating<br>
complexes). Such adjuvants may protect the polypeptide from rapid dispersal by sequestering it in a local<br>
deposit, or they may contain substances that stimulate the host to secrete factors that are chemotactic for<br>
macrophages and other components of the immune system. Preferably, if a polypeptide is being<br>
administered, the immunization schedule will involve two or more administrations of the polypeptide,<br><br>
-40-<br>
spread out over several weeks. Example 2 exemplifies a method for producing anti-ALK-1 monoclonal<br>
antibodies in XENOMOUSEยฎ mice.<br>
Production of Antibodies and Antibody-Producing Cell Lines<br>
After immunization of an animal with a ALK-1 antigen, antibodies and/or antibody-producing cells<br>
can be obtained from the animal. In some embodiments, anti-ALK-1 antibody-containing serum is<br>
obtained from the animal by bleeding or sacrificing the animal. The serum may be used as it is obtained<br>
from the animal, an immunoglobulin fraction may be obtained from the serum, or the anti-ALK-1<br>
antibodies may be purified from the serum.<br>
In some embodiments, antibody-producing cell lines are prepared from cells isolated from the<br>
immunized animal. After immunization, the animal is sacrificed and lymph node and/or splenic B cells are<br>
immortalized by any means known in the art. Methods of immortalizing cells include, but are not limited<br>
to, transfecting them with oncogenes, infecting them with an oncogenic virus and cultivating them under<br>
conditions that select for immortalized cells, subjecting them to carcinogenic or mutating compounds,<br>
fusing them with an immortalized cell, e.g., a myeloma cell, and inactivating a tumor suppressor gene.<br>
See, e.g., Harlow and Lane, supra. If fusion with myeloma cells is used, the myeloma cells preferably do<br>
not secrete immunoglobulin polypeptides (a non-secretory cell line). Immortalized cells are screened<br>
using ALK-1, or a portion thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the initial screening is performed using an<br>
enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) or a radioimmunoassay. An example of ELISA screening is<br>
provided in WO 00/37504, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Anti-ALK-1 antibody-producing cells, e.g., hybridomas, are selected, cloned and further screened<br>
for desirable characteristics, including robust growth, high antibody production and desirable antibody<br>
characteristics, as discussed further below. Hybridomas can be expanded in vivo in syngeneic animals, in<br>
animals that lack an immune system, e.g., nude mice, or in cell culture in vitro. Methods of selecting,<br>
cloning and expanding hybridomas are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the immunized animal is a non-human animal that expresses human<br>
immunoglobulin genes and the splenic B cells are fused to a myeloma cell line from the same species as<br>
the non-human animal. In a more preferred embodiment, the immunized animal is a XENOMOUSEยฎ<br>
mouse and the myeloma cell line is a non-secretory mouse myeloma. In an even more preferred<br>
embodiment, the myeloma cell line is P3-X63-Ag8.653 (American Type Culture Collection). See, e.g.,<br>
Example 2.<br>
Thus, in one embodiment, the invention provides methods for producing a cell line that produces<br>
a human monoclonal antibody or a fragment thereof directed to ALK-1 comprising (a) immunizing a non-<br>
human transgenic animal described herein with ALK-1, a portion of ALK-1 or a cell or tissue expressing<br>
ALK-1; (b) allowing the transgenic animal to mount an immune response to ALK-1; (c) isolating antibody-<br>
producing cells from transgenic animal; (d) immortalizing the antibody-producing cells; (e) creating<br>
individual monoclonal populations of the immortalized antibody-producing cells; and (f) screening the<br>
immortalized antibody-producing cells to identify an antibody directed to ALK-1.<br><br>
-41 -<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a cell line that produces a human anti-ALK-1 antibody.<br>
In some embodiments the cell line is a hybridoma cell line. In some embodiments, the hybridomas are<br>
mouse hybridomas, as described above. In other embodiments, the hybridomas are produced in a non-<br>
human, non-mouse species such as rats, sheep, pigs, goats, cattle or horses. In another embodiment,<br>
the hybridomas are human hybridomas.<br>
In another embodiment, a transgenic animal is immunized with an ALK-1 antigen, primary cells,<br>
e.g., spleen or peripheral blood B cells, are isolated from an immunized transgenic animal and individual<br>
cells producing antibodies specific for the desired antigen are identified. Polyadenylated mRNA from<br>
each individual cell is isolated and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is performed<br>
using sense primers that anneal to variable domain sequences, e.g., degenerate primers that recognize<br>
most or all of the FR1 regions of human heavy and light chain variable domain genes and anti-sense<br>
primers that anneal to constant or joining region sequences. cDNAs of the heavy and light chain variable<br>
domains are then cloned and expressed in any suitable host cell, e.g., a myeloma cell, as chimeric<br>
antibodies with respective immunoglobulin constant regions, such as the heavy chain and K or A constant<br>
domains. See Babcook, J.S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:7843-48, 1996, incorporated herein by<br>
reference. Anti ALK-1 antibodies may then be identified and isolated as described herein.<br>
In another embodiment, phage display techniques can be used to provide libraries containing a<br>
repertoire of antibodies with varying affinities for ALK-1. For production of such repertoires, it is<br>
unnecessary to immortalize the B cells from the immunized animal. Rather, the primary B cells can be<br>
used directly as a source of DNA. The mixture of cDNAs obtained from B cell, e.g., derived from spleens,<br>
is used to prepare an expression library, for example, a phage display library transfected into E.coli. The<br>
resulting cells are tested for immunoreactivity to ALK-1. Techniques for the identification of high affinity<br>
human antibodies from such libraries are described by Griffiths etal., EMBO J., 13:3245-3260 (1994);<br>
Nissim etal., ibid, pp. 692-698 and by Griffiths etal., ibid, 12:725-734, which are incorporated by<br>
reference. Ultimately, clones from the library are identified that produce binding affinities of a desired<br>
magnitude for the antigen and the DNA encoding the product responsible for such binding is recovered<br>
and manipulated for standard recombinant expression. Phage display libraries may also be constructed<br>
using previously manipulated nucleotide sequences and screened in a similar fashion. In general, the<br>
cDNAs encoding heavy and light chains are independently supplied or linked to form Fv analogs for<br>
production in the phage library.<br>
The phage library is then screened for the antibodies with the highest affinities for ALK-1 and the<br>
genetic material recovered from the appropriate clone. Further rounds of screening can increase affinity<br>
of the original antibody isolated.<br>

nucleotide sequence that encodes a VH region thereof.<br>
In another embodiment, the nucleic acid encodes a full-length heavy chain of an antibody<br>
selected from the group consisting of 1.11.1; 1.12.1; 1.12.1(rWT); 1.12.1(M291/D19A); 1.12.1(M29I);<br>

nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 1 or 95.<br>
A nucleic acid molecule encoding the heavy or light chain of an anti-ALK-1 antibody or portions<br>
thereof can be isolated from any source that produces such antibody. In various embodiments, the<br>
nucleic acid molecules are isolated from a B cell that expresses an anti-ALK-1 antibody isolated from an<br>
animal immunized with ALK-1 or from an immortalized cell derived from such a B cell. Methods of<br>
isolating nucleic acids encoding an antibody are well-known in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook J. &amp; Russell<br>
D.. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring<br>
Harbor, N.Y. (2000). mRNA may be isolated and used to produce cDNA for use in the polymerase chain<br>
reaction (PCR) or cDNA cloning of antibody genes. In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule<br>
is isolated from a hybridoma that has as one of its fusion partners a cell from a non-human transgenic<br>
animal, said cell producing a human immunoglobulin. In an even more preferred embodiment, the cell<br>
producing human immunoglobulin is isolated from a XENOMOUSEยฎ animal. In another embodiment, the<br>
cell producing the human immunoglobulin is isolated from a non-human, non-mouse transgenic animal, as<br>
described above, in another embodiment, the nucleic acid is isolated from a non-human, non-transgenic<br>
animal. The nucleic acid molecules isolated from a non-human, non-transgenic animal may be used, e.g.,<br>
for humanized antibodies that comprise one or more amino acid sequences from a human anti-ALK-1<br>
antibody of the present invention.<br>
In some embodiments, a nucleic acid encoding a heavy chain of an anti-ALK-1 antibody of the<br>
invention can comprise a nucleotide sequence encoding a VH domain of the invention joined in-frame to a<br>
nucleotide sequence encoding a heavy chain constant domain from any source. Similarly, a nucleic acid<br>
molecule encoding a light chain of an anti-ALK-1 antibody of the invention can comprise a nucleotide<br>
sequence encoding a VL domain of the invention joined in-frame to a nucleotide sequence encoding a<br>
light chain constant domain from any source.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, nucleic acid molecules encoding the variable domain of the<br>
heavy (VH) and/or light (VL) chains are "converted" to full-length antibody genes. In one embodiment,<br>
nucleic acid molecules encoding the VH or VL domains are converted to full-length antibody genes by<br>
insertion into an expression'vector already encoding heavy chain constant (CH) or light chain constant (CL)<br>
domains, respectively, such that the VH segment is operatively linked to the CH segment(s) within the<br><br>
-45-<br>
vector, and/or the VL segment is operatively linked to the CL segment within the vector. In another<br>
embodiment, nucleic acid molecules encoding the VH and/or VL domains are converted into full-length<br>
antibody genes by linking, e.g., ligating, a nucleic acid molecule encoding a VH and/or VL domains to a<br>
nucleic acid molecule encoding a CH and/or CL domain using standard molecular biological techniques.<br>
Nucleic acid sequences of human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin constant domain genes are<br>
known in the art. See, e.g., Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed., NIH<br>
Publ. No. 91-3242, 1991. Nucleic acid molecules encoding the full-length heavy and/or light chains may<br>
then be expressed from a cell into which they have been introduced and the anti-ALK-1 antibody isolated.<br>
The nucleic acid molecules may be used to recombinantly express large quantities of anti-ALK-1<br>
antibodies. The nucleic acid molecules also may be used to produce chimeric antibodies, bispecific<br>
antibodies, single chain antibodies, immunoadhesins, diabodies, mutated antibodies and antibody<br>
derivatives, as described further below. If the nucleic acid molecules are derived from a non-human, non-<br>
transgenic animal, the nucleic acid molecules may be used for antibody humanization, also as described<br>
below.<br>
In another embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule of the invention is used as a probe or PCR<br>
primer for a specific antibody sequence. For instance, the nucleic acid can be used as a probe in<br>
diagnostic methods or as a PCR primer to amplify regions of DNA that could be used, inter alia, to isolate<br>
additional nucleic acid molecules encoding variable domains of anti-ALK-1 antibodies. In some<br>
embodiments, the nucleic acid molecules are oligonucleotides. In some embodiments, the<br>
oligonucleotides are from highly variable domains of the heavy and light chains of the antibody of interest.<br>
In some embodiments, the oligonucleotides encode all or a part of one or more of the CDRs of antibodies<br>
1.11.1; 1.12.1; 1.12.1(rWT); 1.12.1(M29I/D19A); 1.12.1(M29I); 1.12.1(D19A); 1.13.1; 1.14.1; 1.151.1;<br>
1.162.1; 1.183.1; 1.27.1; 1.29.1; 1.31.1; 1.8.1; 1.9.1; 4.10.1; 4.24.1; 4.38.1; 4.58,1; 4.62.1; 4.68.1; 4.72.1;<br>
5.13.1; 5.34.1; 5.53.1; 5.56.1; 5.57.1; or 5.59.1 or variants thereof as described herein.<br>
Vectors<br>
The invention provides vectors comprising nucleic acid molecules that encode the heavy chain of<br>
an anti-ALK-1 antibody of the invention or an antigen-binding portion thereof. The invention also provides<br>
vectors comprising nucleic acid molecules that encode the light chain of such antibodies or antigen-<br>
binding portion thereof. The invention further provides vectors comprising nucleic acid molecules<br>
encoding fusion proteins, modified antibodies, antibody fragments, and probes thereof.<br>
In some embodiments, the anti-ALK-1 antibodies of the invention or antigen-binding portions are<br>
expressed by inserting DNAs encoding partial or full-length light and heavy chains, obtained as described<br>
above, into expression vectors such that the genes are operatively linked to necessary expression control<br>
sequences such as transcriptional and translational control sequences. Expression vectors include<br>
plasmids, retroviruses, adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses (AAV), plant viruses such as cauliflower<br>
mosaic virus, tobacco mosaic virus, cosmids, YACs, EBV derived episomes, and the like. The antibody<br>
gene is ligated into a vector such that transcriptional and translational control sequences within the vector<br>
serve their intended function of regulating the transcription and translation of the antibody gene. The<br><br>
-46-<br>
expression vector and expression control sequences are chosen to be compatible with the expression<br>
host cell used. The antibody light chain gene and the antibody heavy chain gene can be inserted into<br>
separate vectors. In a preferred embodiment, both genes are inserted into the same expression vector.<br>
The antibody genes are inserted into the expression vector by standard methods (e.g., ligation of<br>
complementary restriction sites on the antibody gene fragment and vector, or blunt end ligation if no<br>
restriction sites are present).<br>
A convenient vector is one that encodes a functionally complete human CH or CL immunoglobulin<br>
sequence, with appropriate restriction sites engineered so that any VH or VL sequence can easily be<br>
inserted and expressed, as described above. In such vectors, splicing usually occurs between the splice<br>
donor site in the inserted J region and the splice acceptor site preceding the human C domain, and also at<br>
the splice regions that occur within the human CH exons. Poiyadenylation and transcription termination<br>
occur at native chromosomal sites downstream of the coding regions. The recombinant expression vector<br>
also can encode a signal peptide that facilitates secretion of the antibody chain from a host cell. The<br>
antibody chain gene may be cloned into the vector such that the signal peptide is linked in-frame to the<br>
amino terminus of the immunoglobulin chain. The signal peptide can be an immunoglobulin signal<br>
peptide or a heterologous signal peptide (i.e., a signal peptide from a non-immunoglobulin protein).<br>
In addition to the antibody chain genes, the recombinant expression vectors of the invention carry<br>
regulatory sequences that control the expression of the antibody chain genes in a host cell. It will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art that the design of the expression vector,-including the selection of<br>
regulatory sequences may depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed, the<br>
level of expression of protein desired, etc. Preferred regulatory sequences for mammalian host cell<br>
expression include viral elements that direct high levels of protein expression in mammalian cells, such as<br>
promoters and/or enhancers derived from retroviral LTRs, cytomegalovirus (CMV) (such as the CMV<br>
promoter/enhancer), Simian Virus 40 (SV40) (such as the SV40 promoter/enhancer), adenovirus, (e.g.,<br>
the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP)), polyoma and strong mammalian promoters such as native<br>
immunoglobulin and actin promoters. For further description of viral regulatory elements, and sequences<br>
thereof, see e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,168,062, U.S. Patent No. 4,510,245 and U.S. Patent No. 4,968,615.<br>
Methods for expressing antibodies in plants, including a description of promoters and vectors, as well as<br>
transformation of plants is known in the art. See, e.g., United States Patent 6,517,529, incorporated<br>
herein by reference. Methods of expressing polypeptides in bacterial cells or fungal cells, e.g., yeast<br>
cells, are also well known in the art.<br>
In addition to the antibody chain genes and regulatory sequences, the recombinant expression<br>
vectors of the invention may carry additional sequences, such as sequences that regulate replication of<br>
the vector in host cells (e.g., origins of replication) and selectable marker genes. The selectable marker<br>
gene facilitates selection of host cells into which the vector has been introduced (see e.g., U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 4,399,216, 4,634,665 and 5,179,017, incorporated herein by reference). For example, typically the<br>
selectable marker gene confers resistance to drugs, such as G418, hygromycin or methotrexate, on a<br>
host cell into which the vector has been introduced. For example, selectable marker genes include the<br><br>
-47-<br>
dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene (for use in dhfr-host cells with methotrexate selection/amplification),<br>
the neo gene (for G418 selection), and the glutamate synthetase gene.<br>
Non-Hybridoma Host Cells and Methods of Recombinant Producing Protein<br>
Nucleic acid molecules encoding anti-ALK-1 antibodies and vectors comprising these nucleic acid<br>
molecules can be used for transfection of a suitable mammalian, plant, bacterial or yeast host cell.<br>
Transformation can be by any known method for introducing polynucleotides into a host cell. Methods for<br>
introduction of heterologous polynucleotides into mammalian cells are well known in the art and include<br>
dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate precipitation, polybrene-mediated transfection,<br>
protoplast fusion, electroporation, encapsulation of the polynucleotide(s) in liposomes, and direct<br>
microinjection of the DNA into nuclei. In addition, nucleic acid molecules may be introduced into<br>
mammalian cells by viral vectors. Methods of transforming cells are well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 4,399,216, 4,912,040, 4,740,461, and 4,959,455, incorporated herein by reference). Methods<br>
of transforming plant cells are well known in the art, including, e.g., Agrobacterium-mediated<br>
transformation, biolistic transformation, direct injection, electroporation and viral transformation. Methods<br>
of transforming bacterial and yeast cells are also well known in the art.<br>
Mammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression are well known in the art and include many<br>
immortalized cell lines available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). These include, inter<br>
alia, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, NSO cells, SP2 cells, HEK-293T cells, 293 Freestyle cells<br>
(Invitrogen), NIH-3T3 cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, African green monkey kidney<br>
cells (COS), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (e.g., Hep G2), A549 cells, and a number of other cell<br>
lines. Cell lines of particular preference are selected through determining which cell lines have high<br>
expression levels. Other cell lines that may be used are insect cell lines, such as Sf9 or Sf21 cells. When<br>
recombinant expression vectors encoding antibody genes are introduced into mammalian host cells, the<br>
antibodies are produced by culturing the host cells for a period of time sufficient to allow for expression of<br>
the antibody in the host cells or, more preferably, secretion of the antibody into the culture medium in<br>
which the host cells are grown. Antibodies can be recovered from the culture medium using standard<br>
protein purification methods. Plant host cells include, e.g., Nicotiana, Arabidopsis, duckweed, corn,<br>
wheat, potato, etc. Bacterial host cells include ยฃ coli and Streptomyces species. Yeast host cells include<br>
Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris.<br>
 Further, expression of antibodies of the invention from production cell lines can be enhanced<br>
using a number of known techniques. For example, the glutamine synthetase gene expression system<br>
(the GS system) is a common approach for enhancing expression under certain conditions. The GS<br>
system is discussed in whole or part in connection with European Patent Nos. 0 216 846, 0 256 055, 0<br>
323 997 and 0 338 841.<br>
It is likely that antibodies expressed by different cell lines or in transgenic animals will have<br>
different glycosytation from each other. However, all antibodies encoded by the nucleic acid molecules<br>
provided herein, or comprising the amino acid sequences provided herein are part of the instant invention,<br>
regardless of the glycosylation of the antibodies.<br><br>

Transgenic Animals and Plants<br>
Anti-ALK-1 antibodies of the invention also can be produced transgenically through the generation<br>
of a mammal or plant that is transgenic for the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain sequences of<br>
interest and production of the antibody in a recoverable form therefrom. In connection with the transgenic<br>
production in mammals, anti-ALK-1 antibodies can be produced in, and recovered from, the milk of goats,<br>
cows, or other mammals. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,827,690, 5,756,687, 5,750,172, and 5,741,957,<br>
incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, non-human transgenic animals that comprise<br>
human immunoglobulin loci are immunized with ALK-1 or an immunogenic portion thereof, as described<br>
above. Methods for making antibodies in plants are described, e.g., in U.S. patents 6,046,037 and<br>
5,959,177, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In some embodiments, non-human transgenic animals or plants are produced by introducing one<br>
or more nucleic acid molecules encoding an anti-ALK-1 antibody of the invention into the animal or plant<br>
by standard transgenic techniques. See Hogan and United States Patent 6,417,429, supra. The<br>
transgenic cells used for making the transgenic animal can be embryonic stem cells or somatic cells or a<br>
fertilized egg. The transgenic non-human organisms can be chimeric, nonchimeric heterozygotes, and<br>
nonchimeric homozygotes. See, e.g., Hogan etal., Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory<br>
Manual 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Press (1999); Jackson etal., Mouse Genetics and Transgenics: A<br>
Practical Approach, Oxford University Press (2000); and Pinkert, Transgenic Animal Technology: A<br>
Laboratory Handbook, Academic Press (1999), all incorporated herein by reference. In some<br>
embodiments, the transgenic non-human animals have a targeted disruption and replacement by a<br>
targeting construct that encodes a heavy chain and/or a light chain of interest. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the transgenic animals comprise and express nucleic acid molecules encoding heavy and<br>
light chains that specifically bind to ALK-1, preferably human ALK-1. In some embodiments, the<br>
transgenic animals comprise nucleic acid molecules encoding a modified antibody such as a single-chain<br>
antibody, a chimeric antibody or a humanized antibody. The anti-ALK-1 antibodies may be made in any<br>
transgenic animal. In a preferred embodiment, the non-human animals are mice, rats, sheep, pigs, goats,<br>
cattle or horses. The non-human transgenic animal expresses said encoded polypeptides in blood, milk,<br>
urine, saliva, tears, mucus and other bodily fluids.<br>
Phage Display Libraries<br>
The invention provides a method for producing an anti-ALK-1 antibody or antigen-binding portion<br>
thereof comprising the steps of synthesizing a library of human antibodies on phage, screening the library<br>
with ALK-1 or an antibody-binding portion thereof, isolating phage that bind ALK-1, and obtaining the<br>
antibody from the phage. By way of example, one method for preparing the library of antibodies for use in<br>
phage display techniques comprises the steps of immunizing a non-human animal comprising human<br>
immunoglobulin loci with ALK-1 or an antigenic portion thereof to create an immune response, extracting<br>
antibody-producing cells from the immunized animal; isolating RNA encoding heavy and light chains of<br>
antibodies of the invention from the extracted cells, reverse transcribing the RNA to produce cDNA,<br><br>
-49-<br>
amplifying the cDNA using primers, and inserting the cDNA into a phage display vector such that<br>
antibodies are expressed on the phage. Recombinant anti-ALK-1 antibodies of the invention may be<br>
obtained in this way.<br>
Recombinant human anti-ALK-1 antibodies of the invention can be isolated by screening a<br>
recombinant combinatorial antibody library. Preferably the library is a scFv phage display library,<br>
generated using human VL and VH cDNAs prepared from mRNA isolated from B cells. Methods for<br>
preparing and screening such libraries are known in the art. Kits for generating phage display libraries are<br>
commercially available (e.g., the Pharmacia Recombinant Phage Antibody System, catalog no.<br>
27-9400-01; and the Stratagene SurfZAPโข phage display kit, catalog no. 240612). There also are other<br>
methods and reagents that can be used in generating and screening antibody display libraries (see, e.g.,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,223,409; PCT Publication Nos. WO 92/18619, WO 91/17271, WO 92/20791, WO<br>

J. Mol. Biol. 226:889-896 (1992); Clackson etal., Nature 352:624-628 (1991); Gram etal., Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA 89:3576-3580 (1992); Garrad etal., Bio/Technology 9:1373-1377 (1991); Hoogenboom<br>
etal., Nuc. Acid Res. 19:4133-4137 (1991); and Barbas etal., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:7978-7982<br>
(1991), all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In one embodiment, to isolate and produce human anti-ALK-1 antibodies with the desired<br>
characteristics, a human anti-ALK-1 antibody as described herein is first used to select human heavy and<br>
light chain sequences having similar binding activity toward ALK-1, using the epitope imprinting methods<br>
described in PCT Publication No. WO 93/06213, incorporated herein by reference. The antibody libraries<br>
used in this method are preferably scFv libraries prepared and screened as described in PCT Publication<br>
No. WO 92/01047, McCafferty etal., Nature 348:552-554 (1990); and Griffiths et al., EMBO J. 12:725-734<br>
(1993), all incorporated herein by reference. The scFv antibody libraries preferably are screened using<br>
human ALK-1 as the antigen.<br>
Once initial human VL and VH domains are selected, "mix and match" experiments are performed,<br>
in which different pairs of the initially selected VL and VH segments are screened for ALK-1 binding to<br>
select preferred Vj_/VH pair combinations. Additionally, to further improve the quality of the antibody, the<br>
VL and VH segments of the preferred VL/VH pair(s) can be randomly mutated, preferably within the CDR3<br>
region of VH and/or Vu, in a process analogous to the in vivo somatic mutation process responsible for<br>
affinity maturation of antibodies during a natural immune response. This in vitro affinity maturation can be<br>
accomplished by amplifying VH and VL domains using PCR primers complimentary to the VH CDR3 or VL<br>
CDR3, respectively, which primers have been "spiked" with a random mixture of the four nucleotide bases<br>
at certain positions such that the resultant PCR products encode VH and VL segments into which random<br>
mutations have been introduced into the VH and/or VL CDR3 regions. These randomly mutated VH and VL<br>
segments can be re-screened for binding to ALK-1.<br>
Following screening and isolation of an anti-ALK-1 antibody of the invention from a recombinant<br>
immunoglobulin display library, nucleic acids encoding the selected antibody can be recovered from the<br><br>
-50-<br>
display package (e.g., from the phage genome) and subcloned into other expression vectors by standard<br>
recombinant DNA techniques. If desired, the nucleic acid can further be manipulated to create other<br>
antibody forms of the invention, as described below. To express a recombinant human antibody isolated<br>
by screening of a combinatorial library, the DNA encoding the antibody is cloned into a recombinant<br>
expression vector and introduced into a mammalian host cells, as described above.<br>
Deimmunized Antibodies<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the antibody may be deimmunized to reduce its<br>
immunogenicity using the techniques described in, e.g., PCT Publication Nos. W098/52976 and<br>
WO00/34317 (incorporated herein by reference).<br>
Mutated Antibodies<br>
In another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecules, vectors and host cells may be used to make<br>
mutated anti-ALK-1 antibodies. The antibodies may be mutated in the variable domains of the heavy<br>
and/or light chains, e.g., to alter a binding property of the antibody. For example, a mutation may be<br>
made in one or more of the CDR regions to increase or decrease the KD of the antibody for ALK-1, to<br>
increase or decrease k0ff, or to alter the binding specificity of the antibody. Techniques in site-directed<br>
mutagenesis are well-known in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook etal. and Ausubel etal., supra. In another<br>
embodiment, one or more mutations are made at an amino acid residue that is known to be changed<br>
compared to the germline in monoclonal antibody 1.11.1; 1.12.1; 1.12.1(rWT); 1.12.1(M29I/D19A);<br>
1.12.1 (M29I); 1.12.1(D19A); 1.13.1; 1.14.1; 1.151.1; 1.162.1; 1.183.1; 1.27.1; 1.29.1; 1.31.1; 1.8.1; 1.9.1;<br>
4.10.1; 4.24.1; 4.38.1; 4.58.1; 4.62.1; 4.68.1; 4.72.1; 5.13.1; 5.34.1; 5.53.1; 5.56.1; 5.57.1; or 5.59.1. The<br>
mutations may be made in a CDR region or framework region of a variable domain, or in a constant<br>
domain. In a preferred embodiment, the mutations are made in a variable domain. In some<br>
embodiments, one or more mutations are made at an amino acid residue that is known to be changed<br>
compared to the germline in a CDR region or framework region of a variable domain of an amino acid<br>
sequence SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46,<br>
48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90 92 or 127, or whose<br>
nucleic acid sequence is presented in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13,15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31,<br>
33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87,<br>
89, 91,95, 102 or 126.<br>
In another embodiment, the framework region is mutated so that the resulting framework region(s)<br>
have the amino acid sequence of the corresponding germline gene. A mutation may be made in a<br>
framework region or constant domain to increase the half-life of the anti-ALK-1 antibody. See, e.g., PCT<br>
Publication No. WO 00/09560, incorporated herein by reference. A mutation in a framework region or<br>
constant domain aiso can be made to alter the immunogenicity of the antibody, to provide a site for<br>
covalent or non-covalent binding to another molecule, or to alter such properties as complement fixation,<br>
FcR binding and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). According to the invention, a<br><br>
-51-<br>
single antibody may have mutations in any one or more of the CDRs or framework regions of the variable<br>
domain or in the constant domain.<br>
In some embodiments, there are from 1 to 13, including any number in between, amino acid<br>
mutations in either the VH or VL domains of the mutated anti-ALK-1 antibody compared to the anti-ALK-1<br>
antibody prior to mutation. In any of the above, the mutations may occur in one or more CDR regions.<br>
Further, any of the mutations can be conservative amino acid substitutions. In some embodiments, there<br>
are no more than 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 amino acid changes in the constant domains.<br>
Modified Antibodies<br>
In another embodiment, a fusion antibody or immunoadhesin may be made that comprises all or a<br>
portion of an anti-ALK-1 antibody of the invention linked to another polypeptide. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, only the variable domains of the anti-ALK-1 antibody are linked to the polypeptide. In<br>
another preferred embodiment, the VH domain of an anti-ALK-1 antibody is linked to a first polypeptide,<br>
while the VL domain of an anti-ALK-1 antibody is linked to a second polypeptide that associates with the<br>
first polypeptide in a manner such that the VH and VL domains can interact with one another to form an<br>
antigen binding site. In another preferred embodiment, the VH domain is separated from the VL domain by<br>
a linker such that the VH and VL domains can interact with one another (see below under Single Chain<br>
Antibodies). The VH-linker-VL antibody is then linked to the polypeptide of interest. In addition, fusion<br>
antibodies can be created in which two (or more) single-chain antibodies are linked to one another. This<br>
is useful if one wants to create a divalent or polyvalent antibody on a single polypeptide chain, or if one<br>
wants to create a bispecific antibody.<br>
To create a single chain antibody, (scFv) the VH- and VL-encoding DNA fragments are operatively<br>
linked to another fragment encoding a flexible linker, e.g., encoding the amino acid sequence (Gly4 -Ser)3,<br>
such that the VH and Vu sequences can be expressed as a contiguous single-chain protein, with the VL<br>
and VH domains joined by the flexible linker. See, e.g., Bird et al., Science 242:423-426 (1988); Huston<br>
etal., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883 (1988); McCafferty et al., Nature 348:552-554 (1990).<br>
The single chain antibody may be monovalent, if only a single VH and VL are used, bivalent, if two VH and<br>
VL are used, or polyvalent, if more than two VH and VL are used. Bispecific or polyvalent antibodies may<br>
be generated that bind specifically to ALK-1 and to another molecule.<br>
In other embodiments, other modified antibodies may be prepared using anti-ALK-1 antibody<br>
encoding nucleic acid molecules. For instance, "Kappa bodies" (III et al., Protein Eng. 10: 949-57 (1997)),<br>
"Minibodies" (Martin et al., EMBO J. 13: 5303-9 (1994)), "Diabodies" (Holliger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA 90: 6444-6448 (1993)), or "Janusins" (Traunecker etal., EMBO J. 10:3655-3659 (1991) and<br>
Traunecker etal., Int. J. Cancer (Suppl.) 7:51-52 (1992)) may be prepared using standard molecular<br>
biological techniques following the teachings of the specification.<br>
Bispecific antibodies or antigen-binding fragments can be produced by a variety of methods<br>
including fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab' fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai &amp; Lachmann, Clin. Exp.<br>
Immunol. 79: 315-321 (1990), Kostelny etal., J. Immunol. 148:1547-1553 (1992). In addition, bispecific<br>
antibodies may be formed as "diabodies" or "Janusins." In some embodiments, the bispecific antibody<br><br>
-52-<br>
binds to two different epitopes of ALK-1. In some embodiments, the bispecific antibody has a first heavy<br>
chain and a first light chain from monoclonal antibody 1.11.1; 1.12.1; 1.12.1(rWT); 1.12.1(M29I/D19A);<br>
1.12.1(M29I); 1.12.1(D19A); 1.13.1; 1.14.1; 1.151.1; 1.162.1; 1.183.1; 1.27.1; 1.29.1; 1.31.1; 1.8.1; 1.9.1;<br>
4.10.1; 4.24.1; 4.38.1; 4.58.1; 4.62.1; 4.68.1; 4.72.1; 5.13.1; 5.34.1; 5.53.1; 5.56.1; 5.57.1; or 5.59.1 and<br>
an additional antibody heavy chain and light chain. In some embodiments, the additional light chain and<br>
heavy chain also are from one of the above-identified monoclonal antibodies, but are different from the<br>
first heavy and light chains.<br>
In some embodiments, the modified antibodies described above are prepared using one or more<br>
of the variable domains or CDR regions from a human anti-ALK-1 monoclonal antibody provided herein.<br>
Derivatized and Labeled Antibodies<br>
An anti-ALK-1 antibody or antigen-binding portion of the invention can be derivatized or linked to<br>
another molecule (e.g., another peptide or protein). In general, the antibodies or portion thereof are<br>
derivatized such that the ALK-1 binding is not affected adversely by the derivatization or labeling.<br>
Accordingly, the antibodies and antibody portions of the invention are intended to include both intact and<br>
modified forms of the human anti-ALK-1 antibodies described herein. For example, an antibody or.<br>
antibody portion of the invention can be functionally linked (by chemical coupling, genetic fusion,<br>
noncovalent association or otherwise) to one or more other molecular entities, such as another antibody<br>
(e.g., a bispecific antibody or a diabody), a detection agent, a pharmaceutical agent, and/or a protein or<br>
peptide that can mediate association of the antibody or antibody portion with another molecule (such as a<br>
streptavidin core region or a polyhistidine tag).<br>
One type of derivatized antibody is produced by crosslinking two or more antibodies (of the same<br>
type or of different types, e.g., to create bispecific antibodies). Suitable crosslinkers include those that are<br>
heterobifunctional, having two distinctly reactive groups separated by an appropriate spacer (e.g.,<br>
m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) or homobifunctional (e.g., disuccinimidyl suberate).<br>
Such linkers are available from Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, II.<br>
Another type of derivatized antibody is a labeled antibody. Useful detection agents with which an<br>
antibody or antigen-binding portion of the invention may be derivatized include fluorescent compounds,<br>
including fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, 5-dimethylamine-1-napthalenesulfonyl<br>
chloride, phycoerythrin, lanthanide phosphors and the like. An antibody can also be labeled with enzymes<br>
that are useful for detection, such as horseradish peroxidase, (3-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline<br>
phosphatase, glucose oxidase and the like. When an antibody is labeled with a detectable enzyme, it is<br>
detected by adding additional reagents that the enzyme uses to produce a reaction product that can be<br>
discerned. For example, when the agent horseradish peroxidase is present, the addition of hydrogen<br>
peroxide and diaminobenzidine leads to a colored reaction product, which is detectable. An antibody can<br>
also be labeled with biotin, and detected through indirect measurement of avidin or streptavidin binding.<br>
An antibody can also be labeled with a predetermined polypeptide epitope recognized by a secondary<br>
reporter (e.g., leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal binding<br><br>
-53-<br>
domains, epitope tags). In some embodiments, labels are attached by spacer arms of various lengths to<br>
reduce potential steric hindrance.<br>
An anti-ALK-1 antibody can also be derivatized with a chemical group such as polyethylene glycol<br>
(PEG), a methyl or ethyl group, or a carbohydrate group. These groups are useful to improve the<br>
biological characteristics of the antibody, e.g., to increase serum half-life.<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions and Administration<br>
This invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of conditions<br>
associated with undesirable increased angiogenesis in a mammal, including a human, comprising an<br>
amount of an anti-ALK-1 antibody or antigen binding portion thereof, as described herein, that is effective in<br>
treating such conditions, and a pharmaceutical acceptable carrier.<br>
The antibodies and antigen-binding portions of the present invention can be incorporated into<br>
pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration to a subject. Typically, the pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprises an antibody or antigen-binding portion of the invention and a pharmaceutical<br>
acceptable carrier. As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" means any and all solvents,<br>
dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents,<br>
and the like that are physiologically compatible. Some examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers<br>
are water, saline, phosphate buffered saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol and the like, as well as<br>
combinations thereof. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars,<br>
polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Additional examples of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable substances are wetting agents or minor amounts of auxiliary substances<br>
such as wetting or emulsifying agents, preservatives or buffers, which enhance the shelf life or<br>
effectiveness of the antibody.<br>
The compositions of this invention may be in a variety of forms, for example, liquid, semi-solid and<br>
solid dosage forms, such as liquid solutions (e.g., injectable and infusible solutions), dispersions or<br>
suspensions, tablets, pills, powders, liposomes and suppositories. The preferred form depends on the<br>
intended mode of administration and therapeutic application. Typical preferred compositions are in the<br>
form of injectable or infusible solutions, such as compositions similar to those used for passive<br>
immunization of humans. The preferred mode of administration is parenteral (e.g., intravenous,<br>
subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular). In a preferred embodiment, the antibody is administered<br>
by intravenous infusion or injection. In another preferred embodiment, the antibody is administered by<br>
intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage<br>
form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with or without an added preservative. The<br>
compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles,<br>
and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents.<br>
Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g.,<br>
sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
Therapeutic compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture<br>
and storage. The composition can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, dispersion, liposome, or<br><br>
-54-<br>
other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared<br>
by incorporating the anti-ALK-1 antibody in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a<br>
combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally,<br>
dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic<br>
dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of<br>
sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are<br>
vacuum drying and freeze-drying that yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired<br>
ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. The proper fluidity of a solution can be<br>
maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required<br>
particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prolonged absorption of injectable<br>
compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption, for<br>
example, monostearate salts and gelatin.<br>
The antibodies or antibody portions of the present invention can be administered by a variety of<br>
methods known in the art, although for many therapeutic applications, the preferred route/mode of<br>
administration is subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intravenous infusion. As will be appreciated by the<br>
skilled artisan, the route and/or mode of administration will vary depending upon the desired results.<br>
In certain embodiments, the antibody compositions of the present invention may be prepared with<br>
a carrier that will protect the antibody against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation,<br>
including implants, transdermal patches, and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable,<br>
biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid,<br>
collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are<br>
generally known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery<br>
Systems J. R. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1978, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.	-<br>
Additional active compounds also can be incorporated into the compositions. In certain<br>
embodiments, an inhibitory anti-ALK-1 antibody of the invention is co-formulated with and/or co-<br>
administered with one or more additional therapeutic agents. These agents include, without limitation,<br>
antibodies that bind other targets, anti-tumor agents, anti-angiogenesis agents, signal transduction<br>
inhibitors, anti-proliferative agents, chemotherapeutic agents, or peptide analogues that inhibit anti-ALK-1.<br>
Such combination therapies may require lower dosages of the inhibitory anti-ALK-1 antibody as well as<br>
the co-administered agents, thus avoiding possible toxicities or complications associated with the various<br>
monotherapies.<br>
As noted above, the compositions of the present invention optionally may further comprise a<br>
pharmaceutical acceptable antioxidant in addition to a chelating agent. Suitable antioxidants include,<br>
but are not limited to, methionine, sodium thiosulfate, catalase, and platinum.<br>
For example, the composition may contain methionine in a concentration that ranges from 1 mM to about<br>
100 mM, and in particular, is about 27 mM. For example, an aqueous formulation may be:10 mg/mL anti-<br>
ALK-1 antibody, 20 mM Histidine, pH 5.5, 84 mg/mL Trehalose dihydrate, 0.2 mg/mL Polysorbate 80, 0.05<br>
mg/mL disodium EDTA, 0.1 mg/mL L-Methionine.<br><br>
-55-<br>
The compositions of the invention may include a "therapeutically effective amount" or a<br>
"prophylactically effective amount" of an antibody or antigen-binding portion of the invention. A<br>
"therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time<br>
necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic result. A therapeutically effective amount of the antibody or<br>
antigen-binding portion may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of<br>
the individual, and the ability of the antibody or antibody portion to elicit a desired response in the<br>
individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the<br>
antibody or antigen-binding portion are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A<br>
"prophylactically effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time<br>
necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically, since a prophylactic dose is used in<br>
subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, the prophylactically effective amount may be less than<br>
the therapeutically effective amount.<br>
Dosage regimens can be adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic<br>
or prophylactic response). For example, a single bolus can be administered, several divided doses can<br>
be administered over time or the dose can be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the<br>
exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions<br>
in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein<br>
refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian subjects to be treated;<br>
each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired<br>
therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage<br>
unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the<br>
anti-ALK-1 antibody or portion thereof and the particular therapeutic or prophylactic effect to be achieved,<br>
and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an antibody for the treatment of sensitivity<br>
in individuals.<br>
An exemplary, non-limiting range for a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of an<br>
antibody or antibody portion of the invention is 0.025 to 50 mg/kg, more preferably 0.1 to 50 mg/kg, more<br>
preferably 0.1-25, 0.1 to 10 or 0.1 to 3 mg/kg. In some embodiments, a formulation contains 5 mg/mL of<br>
antibody in a buffer of 20mM sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 140mM NaCI, and 0.2mg/m!_ polysorbate 80. It is to<br>
be noted that dosage values may vary with the type and severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to<br>
be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over<br>
time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or<br>
supervising the administration of the compositions, and that dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary<br>
only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed composition.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides kits comprising an anti-ALK-1 antibody or<br>
antigen-binding portion of the invention or a composition comprising such an antibody or portion. A kit<br>
may include, in addition to the antibody or composition, diagnostic or therapeutic agents. A kit can also<br>
include instructions for use in a diagnostic or therapeutic method. In a preferred embodiment, the kit<br>
includes the antibody or a composition comprising it and a diagnostic agent that can be used in a method<br><br>
-:56 -<br>
described below. In another preferred embodiment, the kit includes the antibody or a composition<br>
comprising it and one or more therapeutic agents that can be used in a method described below.<br>
Diagnostic Methods of Use<br>
The anti-ALK-1 antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof can be used in diagnostic methods<br>
to detect ALK-1 in a biological sample in vitro or in vivo. For example, the anti-ALK-1 antibodies can be<br>
used in a conventional immunoassay, including, without limitation, an ELISA, an RIA, flow cytometry,<br>
tissue immunohistochemistry, Western blot or immunoprecipitation. The anti-ALK-1 antibodies of the<br>
invention can be used to detect ALK-1 from humans. The anti-ALK-1 antibodies can also be used to<br>
detect ALK-1 from other primates, e.g. cynomolgus monkeys.<br>
The invention provides a method for detecting ALK-1 in a biological sample comprising contacting<br>
the biological sample with an anti-ALK-1 antibody of the invention and detecting the bound antibody. In<br>
one embodiment, the anti-ALK-1 antibody is directly labeled with a detectable label. In another<br>
embodiment, the anti-ALK-1 antibody (the first antibody) is unlabeled and a second antibody or other<br>
molecule that can bind the anti-ALK-1 antibody is labeled. As is- well known to one of skill in the art, a<br>
second antibody is chosen that is able to specifically bind the particular species and class of the first<br>
antibody. For example, if the anti-ALK-1 antibody is a human IgG, then the secondary antibody could be<br>
an anti-human-lgG. Other molecules that can bind to antibodies include, without limitation, Protein A and<br>
Protein G, both of which are available commercially, e.g., from Pierce Chemical Co.<br>
Suitable labels for the antibody, or secondary antibody have been discussed previously, and<br>
include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials and radioactive<br>
materials. Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase,<br>
p-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include<br>
streptavidin/biotin and avidin/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone,<br>
fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or<br>
phycoerythrin; an example of a luminescent material includes luminol; and examples of suitable<br>
radioactive material include 125l, 131l, 35S or 3H.<br>
In other embodiments, ALK-1 can be assayed in a biological sample by a competition<br>
immunoassay utilizing ALK-1 standards labeled with a detectable substance and an unlabeled anti-ALK-1<br>
antibody. In this assay, the biological sample, the labeled ALK-1 standards and the anti-ALK-1 antibody<br>
are combined and the amount of labeled ALK-1 standard bound to the unlabeled antibody is determined.<br>
The amount of ALK-1 in the biological sample is inversely proportional to the amount of labeled ALK-1<br>
standard bound to the anti-ALK-1 antibody.<br>
One can use the immunoassays disclosed above for a number of purposes. For example, the<br>
anti-ALK-1 antibodies can be used to detect ALK-1 in cultured cells. In a preferred embodiment, the anti-<br>
ALK-1 antibodies are used to determine the amount of ALK-1 produced by cells that have been treated<br>
with various compounds. This method can be used to identify compounds that modulate ALK-1 protein<br>
levels. According to this method, one sample of cells is treated with a test compound for a period of time<br>
while another sample is left untreated. If the total level of ALK-1 is to be measured, the cells are lysed<br><br>
-57-<br>
and the total ALK-1 level is measured using one of the immunoassays described above. The total level of<br>
ALK-1 in the treated versus the untreated cells is compared to determine the effect of the test compound.<br>
A preferred immunoassay for measuring total ALK-1 levels is flow cytometry or<br>
immunohistochemistry. Methods such as ELISA, RIA, flow cytometry, Western blot,<br>
immunohistochemistry, cell surface labeling of integral membrane proteins and immunoprecipitation are<br>
well known in the art. See, e.g., Harlow and Lane, supra. In addition, the immunoassays can be scaled<br>
up for high throughput screening in order to test a large number of compounds for either activation or<br>
inhibition of ALK-1 expression.<br>
The anti-ALK-1 antibodies of the invention also can be used to determine the levels of ALK-1 in a<br>
tissue or in cells derived from the tissue. In some embodiments, the tissue is a diseased tissue. In some<br>
embodiments of the method, a tissue or a biopsy thereof is excised from a patient. The tissue or biopsy is<br>
then used in an immunoassay to determine, e.g., total ALK-1 levels or localization of ALK-1 by the<br>
methods discussed above.<br>
The antibodies of the present invention also can be used in vivo to identify tissues and organs<br>
that express ALK-1. One advantage of using the human anti-ALK-1 antibodies of the present invention is<br>
that they may safely be used in vivo without eliciting a substantial immune response to the antibody upon<br>
administration, unlike antibodies of non-human origin or with humanized or chimeric antibodies.<br>
The method comprises the steps of administering a detectably labeled anti-ALK-1 antibody or a<br>
composition comprising them to a patient in need of such a diagnostic test and subjecting the patient to<br>
imaging analysis to determine the location of the ALK-1-expressing tissues. Imaging analysis is well<br>
known in the medical art, and includes, without limitation, x-ray analysis, magnetic resonance imaging<br>
(MRI) or computed tomography (CT). The antibody can be labeled with any agent suitable for in vivo<br>
imaging, for example a contrast agent, such as barium, which can be used for x-ray analysis, or a<br>
magnetic contrast agent, such as a gadolinium chelate, which can be used for MRI or CT. Other labeling<br>
agents include, without limitation, radioisotopes, such as 99Tc. in another embodiment, the anti-ALK-1<br>
antibody will be unlabeled and will be imaged by administering a second antibody or other molecule that is<br>
detectable and that can bind the anti-ALK-1 antibody. In one embodiment, a biopsy is obtained from the<br>
patient to determine whether the tissue of interest expresses ALK-1.<br>
Therapeutic Methods of Use<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for inhibiting ALK-1 activity by<br>
administering an anti-ALK-1 antibody to a patient in need thereof. Any of the antibodies or antigen-<br>
binding portions thereof described herein may be used therapeutically. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
anti-ALK-1 antibody is a human, chimeric or humanized antibody. In another preferred embodiment, the<br>
anti-ALK-1 antibody is human antibody, and the patient is a human patient. Alternatively, the patient may<br>
be a mammal that expresses ALK-1 that the anti-ALK-1 antibody cross-reacts with. The antibody may be<br>
administered to a non-human mammal expressing ALK-1 with which the antibody cross-reacts (e.g. a<br>
cynomolgus monkey) for veterinary purposes or as an animal model of human disease. Such animal<br>
models may be useful for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies of this invention.<br><br>
-58-<br>
In another embodiment, an anti-ALK-1 antibody or antibody portion thereof may be administered<br>
to a patient who expresses inappropriately high levels of ALK-1. The antibody may be administered once,<br>
but more preferably is administered multiple times. The antibody may be administered from three times<br>
daily to once every six months or longer. The administering may be on a schedule such as three times<br>
daily, twice daily, once daily, once every two days, once every three days, once weekly, once every two<br>
weeks, once every month, once every two months, once every three months and once every six months.<br>
The antibody may also be administered continuously via a minipump. The antibody may be administered<br>
via a mucosal, buccal, intranasal, inhalable, intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, parenteral, or<br>
intratumor route. The antibody may be administered once, at least twice or for at least the period of time<br>
until the condition is treated, palliated or cured. The antibody generally will be administered for as long as<br>
the condition is present. The antibody will generally be administered as part of a pharmaceutical<br>
composition as described supra. The dosage of antibody will generally be in the range of 0.1 to 100<br>
mg/kg, more preferably 0.5 to 50 mg/kg, more preferably 1 to 20 mg/kg, and even more preferably 1 to 10<br>
mg/kg. The serum concentration of the antibody may be measured by any method known in the art.<br>
In one embodiment, the antibody is administered in a formulation as a sterile aqueous solution<br>
having a pH that ranges from about 5.0 to about 6.5 and comprising from about 1 mg/ml to about 200<br>
mg/ml of antibody, from about 1 millimolar to about 100 millimolar of histidine buffer, from about 0.01<br>
mg/ml to about 10 mg/ml of polysorbate 80, from about 100 millimolar to about 400 millimolar of trehalose,<br>
and from about 0.01 millimolar to about 1.0 millimolar of disodium EDTA dihydrate.<br>
It is further contemplated by the present invention that any of the compositions herein may be<br>
administered to a patient susceptible to or suffering from a condition associated with increased<br>
angiogenesis ("an angiogenic condition").<br>

-70-<br>
5,679,666 and 5,770,592. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory for the treatment of cystoid macular edema is<br>
nepafenac.<br>
For administration to the eye, a compound of the present invention is delivered in a<br>
pharmaceutical acceptable ophthalmic vehicle such that the compound is maintained in contact with the<br>
ocular surface for a sufficient time period to allow the compound to penetrate the cornea and/or sclera and<br>
internal regions of the eye, including, for example, the anterior chamber, posterior chamber, vitreous<br>
body, aqueous humor, vitreous humor, cornea, iris/ciliary's, lens, choroid/retina and sclera. The<br>
pharmaceutical acceptable ophthalmic vehicle may be an ointment, vegetable oil, or an encapsulating<br>
material. A compound of the invention may also be injected directly into the vitreous humor or aqueous<br>
humor.<br>
Further, a compound may be also be administered by well known, acceptable methods, such as<br>
sub-Tenon and/or subconjunctival injections. As is well known in the ophthalmic art, the macula is<br>
comprised primarily of retinal cones and is the region of maximum visual acuity in the retina. A Tenon's<br>
capsule or Tenon's membrane is disposed on the sclera. A conjunctiva covers a short area of the globe of<br>
the eyeposterior to the limbus (the bulbar conjunctiva) and folds up (the upper cul-de-sac) or down- (the<br>
lower cul-de-sac) to cover the inner areas of. the upper eyelid and lower eyelid, respectively. The<br>
conjunctiva is disposed on top of Tenon's capsule. The sclera and Tenon's capsule define the exterior<br>
surface of the globe of the eye. For treatment of ocular diseases such as age related macular<br>
degeneration (AMD) including nonexudative (dry) and exudative (wet) AMD, choroidal neovascularization,<br>
retinopathies (such as diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity), diabetic macular edema, retinitis,<br>
uveitis, cystoid macular edema (CME), glaucoma, and other diseases or conditions of the posterior<br>
segment of the eye, it is preferable to dispose a depot of a specific quantity of an ophthalmically<br>
acceptable pharmaceutically active agent directly on the outer surface of the sclera and below Tenon's<br>
capsule. In addition, in cases of age related macular degeneration (AMD) including nonexudative (dry)<br>
and exudative (wet) AMD and CME it is most preferable to dispose the depot directly on the outer surface<br>
of the sclera, below Tenon's capsule, and generally above the macula.<br>
The compounds may be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long-acting formulations may be<br>
administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) intramuscular injection or<br>
by the above mentioned sub-Tenon or intravitreal injection. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in<br>
powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
Within particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, the compounds may be prepared for<br>
topical administration in saline (combined with any of the preservatives and antimicrobial agents<br>
commonly used in ocular preparations), and administered in eyedrop form. The solution or suspension<br>
may be prepared in its pure form and administered several times daily. Alternatively, the present<br>
compositions, prepared as described above, may also be administered directly to the cornea.<br>
Within preferred embodiments, the composition is prepared with a muco-adhesive polymer that<br>
binds to cornea. Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or<br>
hydrophobic materials (for example, as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion-exchange resins, or as<br>
sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.<br><br>
-71-<br>
A pharmaceutical carrier for hydrophobic compounds is a cosolvent system comprising benzyl<br>
alcohol, a nonpolar surfactant, a water-miscible organic polymer, and an aqueous phase. The cosolvent<br>
system may be a VPD co-solvent system. VPD is a solution of 3% w/v benzyl alcohol, 8% w/v of the<br>
nonpolar surfactant polysorbate 80, and 65% w/v polyethylene glycol 300, made up to volume in absolute<br>
ethanol. The VPD co-solvent system (VPD:5W) contains VPD diluted 1:1 with a 5% dextrose in water<br>
solution. This co-solvent system dissolves hydrophobic compounds well, and itself produces low toxicity<br>
upon systemic administration. Naturally, the proportions of a co-solvent system may be varied<br>
considerably without destroying its solubility and toxicity characteristics. Furthermore, the identity of the<br>
co-solvent components may be varied: for example, other low-toxicity nonpolar surfactants may be used<br>
instead of polysorbate 80; the fraction size of polyethylene glycol may be varied; other biocompatible<br>
polymers may replace polyethylene glycol, e.g. polyvinyl pyrrolidone; and other sugars or polysaccharides<br>
may be substituted for dextrose.<br>
Alternatively, other delivery systems for hydrophobic pharmaceutical compounds may be<br>
employed. Liposomes and emulsions are known examples of delivery vehicles or carriers for hydrophobic<br>
drugs. Certain organic solvents such as dimethyisuifoxide also may be employed, although usually at the<br>
cost of greater toxicity. Additionally, the compounds may be delivered using a sustained-release system,<br>
such as semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the therapeutic agent. Various<br>
sustained-release materials have been established and are known by those skilled in the art. Sustained-<br>
release capsules may, depending on their chemical nature, release the compounds for a few weeks up to<br>
over 100 days. Depending on the chemical nature and the biological stability of the therapeutic reagent,<br>
additional strategies for protein stabilization may be employed.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions also may comprise suitable solid- or gel-phase carriers or<br>
excipients. Examples of such carriers or excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate,<br>
sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.<br>
Any of the compositions can be formulated for administration to an individual. An individual of the<br>
present invention is preferably a mammal, or more preferably a human.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulations herein can further include a therapeutic agent selected from the<br>
group consisting of: an antineoplastic agent, an anti-inflammatory agent, an antibacterial agent, an<br>
antiviral agent, an angiogenic agent, and an anti-angiogenic agent. Examples of such agents are<br>

formulations isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile<br>
suspensions which may include suspending systems designed to target the compound to blood<br>
components or one or more organs. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed<br>
containers, for example, ampoules or vials. For intraocular formulations, unit dosages are preferred<br>
because no preservatives are in the formulation. For other parenteral formulations, preservative may be<br>
used, which would allow for multi dose containers<br><br>
- 73 -<br>
Extemporaneous injections solutions and suspensions may be prepared, for example, from sterile<br>
powders. Parenteral and intravenous forms may also include minerals and other materials to make them<br>
compatible with the type of injection or delivery system chosen.<br>
Particular parenteral administrations contemplated by the present invention include intraocular<br>
and intravitreous administrations to the eye. Pharmaceutical formulations for intraocular and intravitreous<br>
administrations include phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and balanced isotonic salt solution (BSS) with or<br>
without excipients such as mannitol or sorbitol as protein stabilizers.<br>
In general, water, suitable oil, saline, aqueous dextrose (glucose), or related sugar solutions and<br>
glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols are suitable carriers for parenteral solutions.<br>
Solutions for parenteral administration preferably contain a water soluble salt of the active ingredient,<br>
suitable stabilizing agents and, if necessary, buffer substances. Antioxidizing agents, such as sodium<br>
bisulfite, sodium sulfite, or ascorbic acid, either alone or combined, are suitable stabilizing agents. Also<br>
used are citric acid salts thereof, or sodium EDTA. In addition, parenteral solutions may contain<br>
preservatives, such as benzalkonium chloride, methyl- or propylparaben, or chlorobutanol. Suitable<br>
pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remington, cited supra.<br>

Gene Therapy<br>
The nucleic acid molecules that encode the antibodies and antibody portions of the present<br>
invention can be administered to a patient in need thereof via gene therapy. The therapy may be either in<br>
vivo or ex vivo. In a preferred embodiment, nucleic acid molecules encoding both a heavy chain and a<br>
light chain are administered to a patient. In a more preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid molecules are<br>
administered such that they are stably integrated into chromosomes of B cells because these cells are<br>
specialized for producing antibodies. In a preferred embodiment, precursor B cells are transfected or<br>
infected ex vivo and re-transplanted into a patient in need thereof. In another embodiment, precursor B<br>
cells or other cells are infected in vivo using a virus known to infect the cell type of interest. Typical<br>
vectors used for gene therapy include liposomes, plasmids, and viral vectors. Exemplary viral vectors are<br>
retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses. After infection either in vivo or ex vivo, levels of<br>
antibody expression can be monitored by taking a sample from the treated patient and using any<br>
immunoassay known in the art or discussed herein.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the gene therapy method comprises the steps of administering an<br>
isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding the heavy chain or an antigen-binding portion thereof of an anti-<br>
ALK-1 antibody and expressing the nucleic acid molecule. In another embodiment, the gene therapy<br>
method comprises the steps of administering an isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding the light chain or<br>
an antigen-binding portion thereof of an anti-ALK-1 antibody and expressing the nucleic acid molecule. In<br>
a more preferred method, the gene therapy method comprises the steps of administering an isolated<br>
nucleic acid molecule encoding the heavy chain or an antigen-binding portion thereof and an isolated<br>
nucleic acid molecule encoding the light chain or the antigen-binding portion thereof of an anti-ALK-1<br>
antibody of the invention and expressing the nucleic acid molecules. The gene therapy method may also<br>
comprise the step of administering another therapeutic agent, such as any of the agents discussed<br>
previously in connection with combination therapy.<br><br>
-77-<br>
Method for Screening ALK-1 Antagonists or Agonists<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for determining if a substance<br>
inhibits up-regulation of a.specific downstream target gene of ALK-1, Id1, such as, for example, the<br>
Taqman Assay for ld1 desribed in Example 12. The method comprises contacting a sample of cells that<br>
express Id1 with the substance and determining if Id1 expression is inhibited, wherein a reduced level of<br>
Id1 expression in the sample of cells contacted with the substance as compared to a control sample of<br>
cells is indicative of said substance inhibiting Id1 expression. In one specific embodiment, the substance<br>
is an antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of ALK-1. In another embodiment, the substance is a<br>
small molecule. According to the invention, the cells can inherently express both ALK-1 and Id1, such as<br>
HUVECs desribed in Example 12, or which have been transformed or transfected with DNA encoding one<br>
or both of these. One can determine the expression of Id1 via, e.g., the use of Taqman Assay for Id1<br>
desribed in Example 12.<br>
Conversely, activators or agonists can also be tested for, or utilized, following the same type of<br>
procedures.<br>

Example 1. ALK-1 Immunoqen Preparation<br>
The ECD of ALK-1 was cloned from full-length human ALK-1 ORF clone (Invitrogen, Clone ID<br>
IOH21048) by PCR using the forward 5'-ACGGCCC/\GCCGGCCGACCCTGTGAAGCCGTCT (SEQ ID<br>
NO: 96) and<br>
reverse S'-ACTAGCrTTTAATGATGATGATGATGATGCTGGCCATCTGTTCCCG (SEQ ID NO: 97)<br>
primers. The PCR product was purified, treated with the Sfil and Hindlll restriction enzymes, and cloned<br>
into the Sfil/Hindill site of a mammalian expression vector pSecTag2/Hygro (Invitrogen Inc., Catalog<br>
NO.V910-20). The clone was used to transiently transfect 293T cells with Fugene 6 transfection reagent<br><br>
-78-<br>
(Roche Applied Science, Catalog No.1814443) following manufacture's instruction. Supernatant from the<br>
cell culture containing the secreted target protein was harvested 72 hours post-transfection and allowed to<br>
bind to Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN, Catalog No.30430) at 4ยฐC overnight. The resin was then washed with<br>
buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 25 mM imidazole and 300 mM sodium chloride. The His-Tag protein<br>
was eluted off the resin using buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM imidazole and 300 mM<br>
sodium chloride. A CM Sepharose cation exchange resin was used to further purify the protein in 20 mM<br>
sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), and the unbound fraction containing the target protein was collected. The<br>
protein was buffer exchanged to PBS or 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, plus 150 mM sodium chloride by dialysis<br>
and concentrated to 0.2-1 mg/mL with a final purity of &gt;90%, judged by SDS PAGE gel stained with<br>
Coomassie blue. The ALK-1 ECD His-Tag protein was heavily glycosylated with an apparent MW of 26<br>
KDa, comparing to an 11 KDa theoretical MW for the protein. The ALK-1 ECD His-Tag protein (SEQ ID<br>
NO: 98) has been used for generation of hybridomas producing anti-ALK-1 antibody as described in<br>

Example 2. Generation of Hybridomas Producing Anti-ALK-1 Antibody<br>
Eight to ten week old XENOMOUSEยฎ mice were immunized in their hind footpads with 10 ug/<br>
mouse of either recombinant human ALK-1/Fc chimera (R&amp;D Systems, Inc., Catalog Number 370-AL) or<br>
with the ALK-1 ECD His-Tag protein described in Example 1. This dose was repeated five to seven times<br>
over a three to five week period. Three or four days before fusion, the mice were given a final injection of<br>
the immunogen in PBS. The lymph node lymphocytes from immunized mice were fused with the non-<br>
secretory myeloma P3-X63-Ag8.653 cell line via electro cell fusion (ATCC Cat. No. CRL 1580), and these<br>
fused cells were subjected to HA-DMEM selection as previously described (DMEM/15%FBS/1% 200 mM<br>
L-glutamine/1% 100X Non-essential amino acid/1% 100X Pen/Strep/10 U/ml IL-6/1 vial/liter OPI media<br>
supplement plus 0,5x HA (Azaserine-Hypoxanthine, Sigma, Cat. # A9666)). A panel of hybridomas was<br>
recovered that all secrete ALK-1 specific human lgG2 antibodies.<br>
ELISA assay was used to detect antibody binding. Immunogen was coated to the 96-well<br>
Immulon microtiter plate (NUNC-lmmunoโข plate MaxiSorpโข surface, Nalge Nunc International, Cat.<br><br>
-79-<br>
No.439454) at 4|ig/mL in 50 mM sodium bicarbonate buffer for overnight at 4ยฐC. Plates were washed,<br>
and then blocked with PBS with the addition of 0.1% Tween-20 and 0.5% bovine serum albumin.<br>
Antibodies were added to the blocked ELISA plates, incubated for 1 hour, and washed with PBS with<br>
Tween-20. The binding was detected by anti-human IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce, Catalog No.<br>
31420) followed by the addition of ABTS (Pierce, Catalog No. 37615). Colorimetric measurements were<br>
performed at 405 nm in a micro-plate reader (SpectraMax Plus 384, Molecular Devices).<br>
Twenty five hybridomas were selected for further study. These were single-cell cloned by limiting<br>

Mouse Hybridoma Cell line LN 15916 (the hybridoma 1.12.1) was deposited under terms in<br>
accordance with the Budapest Treaty with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 10801<br>
University Blvd., Manassas, VA 20110-2209 on June 21, 2005. The hybridoma 1.12.1 has been assigned<br>
the following accession number: PTA-6808.<br>
Example 3. Sequences of Anti-ALK-1 Antibodies<br>
To analyze the structure of antibodies produced in accordance with the invention, nucleic acids<br>
were cloned that encode heavy and light chain fragments from hybridomas producing anti-ALK-1<br>
monoclonal antibodies. Cloning and sequencing was accomplished by standard means.<br>
Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated using a Fast-Trackโข kit (Invitrogen) from approximately 2 X 105<br>
hybridoma cells for each of the ALK-1 antibodies. cDNA was synthesized from the mRNA by using<br>
random primers. The random primed cDNA was amplified by PCR using human VH or human VK family<br>
specific variable domain primers in conjunction with primers specific for the human Cy2 constant region,<br>
or a C.K constant region to amplify the antibody variable region including all the framework regions (FRs)<br>
and complementarity determining regions (CDRs). Nucleic acid sequences were obtained that encode<br>
human heavy and kappa light chain transcripts from the anti- ALK-1 producing hybridomas by direct<br>
sequencing of- both strands of PCR products. Sequences were analyzed using Abgenix's proprietary<br>
software and publicly available sequence information for human VH and Vk genes, the "V BASE<br>
sequence directory", Tomlinson etal., MRC Centre for Protein Engineering/Cambridge, UK). Identical<br>
results could be obtained using publicly available sequence alignment software by someone of ordinary<br>
skilll using MacVector and Geneworks software programs.<br>
Specifically, full-length ALK-1 antibody 1.12.1 was cloned into expression vectors as follows:<br>
Po!y(A)+ mRNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and cDNA synthesized from the mRNA<br>
with the Advantage RT-for-PCR kit (BD Biosciences) using oligo(dT) priming. The oligo(dT) primed cDNA<br>
for clone 1.12.1 was amplified using primers listed in Table 2. Amplification was achieved using the Pfu<br>
Ultra polymerase (Stratagene) and a PTC-200 DNA Engine (MJ Research) with cycling as follows:<br>
3'@95ยฐC; 25x (20"@95ยฐC, 30"@52ยฐC, 1'20"@72ยฐC); 10'@72ยฐC. Clones were sequence verified using<br>
Grills 16th BDTv3.1/dGTP chemistry (Applied Biosystems Inc) and a 3730x1 DNA Analyzer (Applied<br><br>
-80-<br>
Biosystems Inc). In the process of cloning 1.12.1 VH&gt; a silent mutation was introduced in the 8th codon,<br>
converting "GGC" to a "GGT." All sequences were analysed by alignments to the 'V BASE sequence<br>
directory' (Tomlinson, et al, J. Mol. Biol., 227, 776-798 (1992); Hum. Mol. Genet, 3, 853-860 (1994);<br>

A number of anti-ALK-1 specific human antibodies exhibited a common pattern in CDR1 of the<br>
heavy chain variable domain. These lead molecules utilize the 4-31 or 4-61 heavy chain V-gene<br>
segments. The FR1 and CDR1 sequences corresponding to these antibody heavy chains are shown in<br><br>
-82-<br>
Table 4A, aligned against the germiine sequences. A dash (-) in the alignment indicates a residue<br>
identical to germiine. In all cases, the GYYWS (SEQ ID NO: 136) pattern at the end of CDR1 has<br>
undergone somatic mutations to yield a new sequence pattern, whereby the G residue is changed to an<br>
acidic residue (D or E), and the final S residue is changed to an N in 9 out of the 12 examples. Sequence<br>
diversity in other regions of VH indicates that these are likely to be independent somatic mutation events<br>
leading to the same sequence pattern at the end of CDR1 of VH.<br>

Example 5. Preparation of 1.12.1 Fab Molecules<br>
Fab fragment of 1.12.1(M29I/D19A) was prepared by digesting 1.12.1(M29I/D19A) lgG1 using<br>
papain. Protein A purified full length 1.12.1(M29I/D19A) lgG1 was incubated with papain (VWR) at 1:50<br>
ratio (papain: protein) in buffer containing 30 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 2 mM EDTA and 2 mM<br>
cysteine at 37 ยฐC for 2-3 hours. The digestion mixture was then applied to a protein A mini-column to<br>
remove undigested full length protein and Fc fragment. Unbound Fab was collected in the flow-through.<br>
A size exclusion column (Superdex 200, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was then used to further purify<br>
the Fab protein and to exchange the buffer into PBS. Endotoxin was removed by applying the protein<br>
solution through Detoxi gel (PIERCE) and Vivapure Mini Q ion exchange column (VivaScience)<br>
subsequently. The protein was filtered with 0.2 urn syringe filter and endotoxin level was tested with a<br>
LAL pyrogent kit (Cambrex). The final purified protein was at concentration of 2-3 mg/mL, with endotoxin<br>
level of 95%. 1.12.1(M29I/D19A) Fab fragment has a molecular weight of<br>
47,347 under non-reduced condition as shown by electron-spray mass spectrometry. Edman N-terminal<br>
sequencing analysis confirmed the light chain N-termini sequence of EIVLTQSPG (SEQ ID NO: 113) and<br>
heavy chain sequence of QVQLQESG (SEQ ID NO: 114), respectively.<br><br>

Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) using BIACOREโข<br>
Avidity measures of purified anti-ALK-1 antibodies by surface plasmon resonance using the<br>
BIACQREโข 3000 instrument were performed as follows using the manufacturer's protocols.<br>
To perform kinetic analyses, recombinant human ALK-1/Fc fusion protein (hALK-1/Fc) and<br>
cynomologus ALK-1/Fc fusion protein (cALK-1/Fc) were immobilized on separate flow cells of a CM5<br>
BIAcore sensor chip using routine amine coupling. Surfaces were prepared using 10 mM acetate buffer,<br>
pH 5.0 as the immobilization buffer and protein densities of 300 and 150 RU were achieved for the hALK-<br>
1/Fc and cALK-1/Fc fusion proteins, respectively. Deactivation of unreacted N-hydroxysuccinimide esters<br>
was performed using 1 M ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5. Antibody samples in running buffer were<br>
prepared at concentrations ranging from 0.125 to 2 nM (a 0 nM solution comprising running buffer alone<br>
was included as a zero reference). Samples were randomized and injected in duplicate for 10 minutes<br>
each across all 4 flow cells using HBS-EP (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCI, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005%<br>
Surfactant P20) as running buffer. On-rates were observed to be independent of flow rates from 1 to 100<br>
uL/min indicating no mass transport limitation. A flow rate of 25 uL/min was used to determine avidity<br>
values. The dissociation of the antibody was monitored for 10 minutes, the surface regenerated by a 12<br>
second injection of 100 mM H3PO4 (25 uL/min). The raw data were processed using the Scrubber<br>
(ยฉBioLogic Software) software package and analyzed using the CLAMP (ยฉBioLogic Software) software<br>
package. Multiple data sets from a single surface, six data sets at a time, were simultaneously fit globally<br>
to a simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model utilizing a common variable Rmax value. Table 5 lists avidity<br>
values for representative anti-ALK-1 antibodies of the present invention. The represented data indicate<br>
that the antibodies prepared in accordance with the invention possess high affinities and strong binding<br>
constants for human ALK-1.<br><br>

Example 8. Determination of Affinity Constants (Kn) of Representative Fully Human Anti-ALK-1<br>
Monoclonal Antibodies by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) using BIACOREโข<br>
Affinity measures (KD and koff) of purified anti-ALK-1 antibodies by surface plasmon resonance<br>
using the BIACOREโข 3000 instrument were performed as follows using the manufacturer's protocols.<br>
To perform kinetic analyses, affinity-purified mAbs were immobilized onto the dextran layer of a<br>
CM5 biosensor chip using amine coupling. Surfaces were prepared using 10 mM acetate buffer pH 5.0<br>
as the immobilization buffer and protein densities of 200-400 RU were achieved. Deactivation of<br>
unreacted N-hydroxysuccinimide esters was performed using 1 M ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5.<br>
Samples of monomeric ALK-ECD in running buffer were prepared at concentrations ranging from 3.125-<br><br>
-87-<br>
injected across the flow cell for 600 seconds at a rate of 10 |jL/min. After the injection was complete, a<br>
secondary antibody was chosen and injected across the same flow cell for 600 seconds at a rate of 10<br>
pL/min. The sensor surface was regenerated by a 12 second injection of 100 mM H3PO4 (25 uL/min).<br>
After regeneration, the primary antibody was again injected across the flow cell for 600 seconds<br>
at a rate of 10 uL/min. After the injection was complete, a different secondary antibody was chosen and<br>
injected across the same flow cell for 600 seconds at a rate of 10 uL/min. Once the entire panel of 14<br>
antibodies had been used as the secondary antibody a new primary antibody was chosen and the<br>
procedure repeated with the new primary antibody. These procedures were carried out until all possible<br>
combinations of primary and secondary antibodies had been injected across the flow cell. Binding of the<br>
secondary antibody was considered to have occurred if the total response observed after injecting both<br>
antibodies exceeded that observed for both possible threshold values. Threshold values were determined<br>
by using the same antibody as both the primary antibody and secondary antibody. Shown in Table 8, a<br>
response matrix was created based on whether binding was observed: - indicates no binding of the<br>
secondary antibody, x indicates binding was observed (response was greater than the threshold values<br>
for the individual antibodies). Grouping the clones that show the same reactivity pattern gives rise to two<br>
different epitope bins with 1.11.1 in one bin and all the other antibodies in the other bin.<br>

Cynomolgus monkey ("Cyno") ALK-1 gene was extracted from Cyno lung tissue. Based on the<br>
published gene sequence for human ALK-1 (Genebank record L17075), primers were designed to PCR<br>
amplify the full-length Cynomolgus ALK-1. mRNA was prepared from frozen excised cynomolgus lung<br>
tissue (ca. 1 g) using the mRNA purification kit (Ambion, Catalog No. 1915) according to the<br>
manufacturer's instructions. 200 ng of the mRNA was reverse transcribed and PCR amplified using the<br>

agarose gel after electrophoresis, then TOPO-TA cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Catalog<br>
No. K4575-01). The insert was sequenced to obtain the ORF nucleotide sequence of Cynomolgus ALK-1.<br>
The nucleotide and predicted translated amino acid sequences are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 93 and 94,<br>

To generate ALK-1-overexpressing cell lines, which can be used to test anti- ALK-1 binding<br>
affinity using flow cytometry (FACS), full-length human, Cyno, and rat ALK-1 genes were cloned into<br>
Invitrogen's (Catalog No. K6510-20) pcDNA5/FRT/To TOPO vector and transfected into 293 Flp-ln T-Rex<br>
host cell (Invitrogen, Catalog No. R780-07), respectively. Selections were carried out using hygromycin to<br>
obtain the final stable cell lines. Overexpressing of the respective full-length ALK-1 proteins were<br>
achieved by tetracycline (2 ug/mL) induction at 37ยฐC/5% C02 for 24 hours.<br>
Anti- ALK-1 mAbs were tested for their binding affinities to cell surface ALK-1 using FACS assay,<br>
employing 293 stable cells overexpressing ALK-1 proteins. The cells were detached using trypsin-EDTA<br>
and washed with cold PBS-SA. After being aliquoted into 96-well plates, the cells were blocked by serum<br>
and incubated with different concentrations of specific mAb for 1 hour at 4ยฐC. Subsequently, the cells<br>
were washed and incubated with an anti-human K secondary antibody conjugated with the R-PE<br>
fluorophore before analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). 10,000 events were<br>
collected for each sample without applying any gating. Shown in Table 9, the geometric mean of each<br>
sample histogram was plotted as a function of the mAb concentration and KD was calculated for each<br><br>
- 89 -<br>
mAb after fitting to a two-state equilibrium model. Examples of equivalent human and primate FACS<br>
experiments are shown in Figure 3.<br>

In addition, 1.12.1 was shown by the FACS assay to have very limited cross-over to rat (KD&gt;100<br>
nM) and is predicted to have very low cross-over to mouse in view of 74% and 68% ECD sequence<br>
identity between rat/human and mouse/human ALK-1, respectively).<br>
FACS assay was also used to determine KD of the recombinant 1.12.1 mAb variants. Shown in<br>

Example 14. Internalization Characteristics of Anti- ALK-1 Monoclonal Antibodies<br>
FACS was used to monitor the time course of the remaining cell-surface receptor ALK-1 as well<br>
as the neutralizing antibody. Remaining cell-surface ALK-1 is monitored by a marker antibody which is<br>
capable of binding cell surface ALK-1 yet recognizing a different epitope from the neutralizing antibody. A<br>
mouse anti-human ALK-1 ECD mAb (R&amp;D sytems, Cat. No # AF310) was identified and used in the<br>
study as the marker antibody.<br>
Time course of internalization was studied using endothelial cell lines HUVEC and HUAEC. The<br>
cells were grown at 37ยฐC with 5% C02 in 24-well plates containing 200 \il of complete culture medium per<br>
well. At each of 11 time points over the course of 48 hours, 2 |iL of 1 mg/mL antibody solution was added<br>
to one well and mixed (final concentration of the neutralizing antibody is 10 |ig/mL). The plate was then<br>
put back into the 37ยฐC incubator until the 0 hour time point, when the plate was placed on ice to stop the<br>
internalization process. Marker antibody was added to the wells at this point (10 \xg/rr\L final<br>
concentration) and incubated on ice for 1 hr. The cells were then washed with PBS detached by<br>
trypsination and transferred into a 96-well plate. Cells were then washed, blocked, and treated with<br>
secondary antibodies bearing different flurophores in order to monitor both neutralizing antibody and<br>
receptor ALK-1 remaining on the cell surface. The samples were assayed on a FACSCalibur flow<br><br>
- 93 -<br>
cytometry instrument, counting 3,000-5,000 events/sample. The Geometric Mean of each sample in the<br>
specific fluorescence channel was calculated and plotted as a function of time. The data were fitted to a<br>
modified radio-decay equation to obtain the half-time (t1/2) of internalization as well as the percentage of<br>
neutralizing antibody or receptor ALK-1 remaining on the cell surface when the internalization reached<br>
steady-state. As shown in Figure 6, mAb 1.12.1(M29I/D19A) internalizes at the same rate and to the<br>
same extend as the cell surface receptor ALK-1. Half-life of the 1.12.1(M29I/D19A) internalization is ~2<br>
hr. An equilibrium was reached when 50% of the antibody was internalized. A polyclonal antibody<br>
purchased from R&amp;D systems (Cat. No # AF370) internalizes at a t1/2 of 1 hr and reaches the steady-state<br>
with ~70% of the receptor being internalized (Figure 6). Similar internalization characteristics were<br>
observed with other human anti-ALK-1 mAbs of the invention (not shown).<br>
Example 15. Establishment of Human Foreskin - SCID Chimera Mice<br>
Significant modification of the surgery procedure was made to a procedure published previously<br>
by H-C Yan, et al "Human/Severe Combined Immunodeficient Mouse Chimeras, An Experimental In Vivo<br>
Model System to Study the Regulation of Human Endothelial Cell-Leukocyte Adhesion Molecules", J. Clin.<br>
Invest. 91:986, 1993; J. Varner "Regulation of Angiogenesis in Vivo by Ligation of Integrin a5b1 with the<br>
Central Cell-Binding Domain of Fibronectin" Amer. J. Paf/7.156 (4):1345, 2000; K. Tahtis, et al "Expression<br>
and Targeting of Human Fibroblast Activation Protein in a Human Skin/Severe Combined<br>
Immunodeficient Mouse Breast Cancer Xenograft Model" Mol. Cancer. Ther. 2(8):729, 2003. Upon arrival<br>
from National Disease Research Institute and Cooperative Human Tissue Network, human foreskin<br>
pieces were trimmed of unhealthy regions and transferred to RPMI media (Cellgro/Mediatech, Cat# MT-<br>
15-040-CV supplemented with Penicillin and Streptamycin (Gibco/Life Tech, Cat# 15070-063) (add 5 mLs<br>
of the pen/strep stock solution into 500mLs of RPMI). Using a scalpel and cutting in sterile petri dish, the<br>
skins were trimmed to an oval shape of approximately 8 x 13 mm cleaning any ragged ends and<br>
connective tissues, and stored on wet ice prior to surgery. The appropriate volume (4 L/gram of animal)<br>
of 100 mg/mL Ketamine (KetasetTR, Fort Dodge Animal Health)/1 mg/mL medetomidine (Pfizer Animal<br>
Health - Dormitor) solution was intraperitoneal injected into scid mouse abdomen (i.e., at a 45ยฐ angle,<br>
under skin but not too deep internally). Once anesthetized, the mice were applied with eye lubricant, a<br>
subcutaneuosly injection of Ketoprofen (10 mg/kg, Fort Dodge Animal Health) and hair was shaved over<br>
the site of the surgery. The surgical region was surgically scrubbed three times using the Clorahexiderm<br>
(Butler, Chclo-Scrub 40, cat # WAB20109) and then the alcohol in a circular motion that started from the<br>
center of the surgical site outward and avoided going from a dirty area back into a clean area. The mice<br>
were transferred to the prepared surgical hood and placed on the heated water pad (Gaymar Industries,<br>
cat# TP500 T/Pump) that was maintained at 37ยฐC. The mice were then placed under isofluorin<br>
anesthesia for the duration of the surgery. The dorsal side of a mouse was covered with a surgical drape<br>
cut to expose the surgery site. The mouse skin was picked up with forceps and an oval shaped skin<br>
tissue was cut with curved scissors with one motion. An appropriate sized human foreskin was placed on<br>
the mouse. The human and mouse skin were sutured together using the Ethilon suture (Ethicon cat#<br><br>
-94-<br>
697H.), starting at top of oval, then the bottom, then the farthest right and then farthest left side. More<br>
stitches were made in between to further secure the tissues together. Approximately 8 stitches were<br>
made equal-distantly around the skin. During the surgery, used a syringe with sterile saline to irrigate the<br>
skin/mouse surgical wound when it became dry. A Bandaid was placed over the wound. A transparent<br>
dressing (3M Tegadermโข) was then used to loosely wrap around the bandage. The dressing was cut to<br>
size to cover an area slightly wider than the Bandaid. The mouse was then given Atipamezole (50-100<br>
lil, Pfizer Animal Health - Antisedan) and the mouse recovered in a heated cage in 5 - 10 min. The<br>
dressing and the bandages were removed in 7 - 10 days and by 15lh day most of the skins appeared as<br>
scabs. Complete healing occurred between 21-28 days after which time skins were ready to be<br>
inoculated with tumor cells. Shown in Figure 8 is an example of the histological (H &amp; E Staining) analysis<br>
of a section of the engrafted skin post surgery. The histology of the engrafted skin closely mimics the<br>
characteristics of human skin implanted in mice described by Tahtis, et al "Expression and Targeting of<br>

Example 16. Collagen Model in Human Foreskin - SCID Chimera Mice<br>
Collagen I stock solution (cat# 354236, Becten-Dickinson) was diluted to 4 mg/mL with 0.02 N<br>
acetic acid and was kept on ice before implantation. The acidic collagen solution (8 parts) was mixed<br>
with 10X M199 (Sigma, Cat# M9163) (1 part) and human plasma fibronectin (Fn) (cat# 354008, Becten-<br>
Dickinson) to reach a final Fn concentration of 90 juL/mL; NaOH (1.0 N) was added to adjust pH to ~ 7.2.<br>
The Collagen/Fn mixture was kept on ice until use. The implant mix was prepared using the above<br>
Collagen/Fn mixture plus angiogenic inhibitor of interest with or without human macrovescular endothelial<br>
cells (HMVEC), (Cascade Biologies, Cat# C-010-5C). The HMVECs were prepared as 6 x l06cells/mL in<br>
PBS. 50-100 ul of the implant mixture was injected intradermal into the foreskin in the scid chimera<br>
mouse. 7-14 days later, the collagen plugs were harvested, embedded in the OCT compound (cat#<br>
4583, Sajura Finetek, CA) and snap frozen for immunohistochemistry analysis. The collagen plug in the<br>
foreskin was identified with the Trichrome Kit (cat# KC1641, Mater Tech, CA) as blue staining as shown in<br>
Figure 9 (A). Human vessels were identified by staining for human P-CAM using the anti-human CD-31<br>
antibody (Clone 13.3, Vector Laboratories) (Figure 9 (B)). Table 12 summarizes the human vessel<br>
staining and quantification in the collagen model in the foreskin - SCID chimera mice.<br><br><br>
Example 17. M24met Tumor Model in Human Foreskin - SCID Chimera Mice<br><br>
-96-<br>
Typically graft age of between 5-10 weeks post surgery were used in these studies. The M24met<br>
cell line was described by Mueller and coworkers in "Tissue factor-initiated thrombin generation activates<br>
the signaling thrombin receptor on malignant melanoma cells", Cancer Research, 55(8):1629-32, 1995.<br>
M24met cell suspension was prepared as following: 80% confluent M24met cells were washed,<br>
typsonized using Trpsin/EDTA (Gibco, Cat# 25200-056) and collected in the PRMI (Cellgro/Mediatech,<br>
cat# MT-15-040-CV) media supplemented with 10% FBS (Cellgro/Mediatech, Cat# AKD-11775) and 2<br>
mM L-glutamine (Cellgro/Mediatech, Cat# 25-005-CI). The cells were centrifuged at 600 rpm for 5 min,<br>
resuspended in sterile PBS. Cell counts were estimated using Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter, Model<br>
Z2). The Cells were, centrifuged at 600 rpm for 5 min and were re-suspended in Collagen/ and Fn (3<br>
mg/ml) mixture to obtain a 4x107 cells /ml cell suspension for implantation.<br>
To inoculate, 2x106 above cells were injected (50 \x\ of 4x107 cells/ml) intradermal into the<br>
engrafted human skin in the mouse. At day 5-7 post implant, the tumors would be palpable and the mice<br>
were randomized into the Control and the Treatment groups before the dosing would start. The Control<br>
group is defined as such that the animals would receive either no dose, dose of the Vehicle in which the<br>
anti-ALK-1 antibody was constituted, or dose of the isotype matched lgG2 human monoclonal antibody<br>
anti-KLH (Pfizer Inc). The Treatment group is defined as such that the animals would receive a dose of<br>
the anti-ALK-1 antibody 1.12.1(M29I/D19A).<br>
Example 18. Human and Mouse CD-31 Immunofluorescence (IF) Dual Staining<br>
The frozen tissue sections were air-dried and fix at -20ยฐC in acetone (Fisher, Cat#A16S-4), or 10<br>
min. The samples were air dried again and washed in PBS three times at 5 min each. The samples were<br>
blocked in 5% rabbit serum (Vector Laboratories, Cat# S-5000) in PBS fro 30 min at room temperature.<br>
Primary antibody mixture was prepared in 5% rabbit serum with the anti-human CD-31 antibody (Santa<br>
Cruz, Cat# SC1505) and the anti-mouse CD-31 (Pharmingen, Clone Med 3.3, Cat# 01951A) at 1:100<br>
and 1:150 dilutions, respectively. The above antibody mixture was added to the tissue samples for 1<br>
hour at RT. The blocks were washed in PBS for three times at 5 min each before incubated with the<br>
secondary antibody mixture for 1 hour at RT. The secondary antibody mixture was prepared in<br>
PBS/0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma, Cat# P1379), Texas Red rabbit anti-goat antibody (Jackson Labs, Cat#<br>
305-075-003) and FITC rabbit anti-Rat antibody (Jackson Labs, Cat# 312-095-003). The antibodies were<br>
diluted at 1:50 if frozen antibodies were used or at 1:100 if fresh antibodies were used. The slides were<br>
washed again in PBS for three times at 5 min each before mounted in Vectashield (Hard Set, Mounting<br>
medium with DAPI, Vector Lab, CA, Cat# H-1500). The slides were kept in dark and 4ยฐC until image<br>
analysis. The image analysis was performed using an Olympus BX60 fluorescent microscope and<br>
photographs were taken using an Olympus microfire digital color camera. Pictures from 3-5 hot<br>
spots/slide, one slide/animal, 4-7 animals/group v/ere taken and the vessel areas as indicated by positive<br>
staining of anti-human CD-31 were quantified by three individuals using Image Pro Plus v4.5<br>
(MediaCybernetics). The pharmacodynamic end point (group mean) was expressed as either the percent<br>
of human CD-31 inhibition compared to the Control group or as total human vessel area. Statistical<br><br>
-97-<br>
significance was determined by ANOVA. Shown in Figure 10 is an immunofluorescent image of human<br>
(red) and mouse (green) vessels of the M24met tumor in the human foreskin SCID chimera mouse.<br>
Example 19. Human CD-31 Immunohistochemistrv (IHC) Staining<br>
The frozen tissue sections were air-dried and fix at -20ยฐC in acetone for 10 min. The samples<br>
were air dried again and washed in PBS twice at 5 min each. The samples were incubated in 0.075%<br>
H202/ methanol (Fisher Cat# A433-4) for 15min and wash in PBS three times at 5 min each. The samples<br>
were blocked in 5% rabbit serum/PBS for 30 min and applied with anti-human CD-31 antibody 1:100<br>
(Santa Cruz, Cat# SC1505) in 5% rabbit serum for 1 hour at RT. The samples were washed in PBS twice<br>
at 5 min each and applied with rabbit anti-goat at 1:200 (Vector Labs, Cat# BA-5000) in 5% rabbit serum<br>
for 35 min at RT. The slides were then washed in PBS twice at 5 min each and freshly made streptavidin<br>
(Vector Labs, ABC Elite kit, Cat# PK-6100) was added. The slides were washed again in PBS twice at 5<br>
min each and then developed in diaminobenzidine (DAB) (Vector Labs, Cat#SK-4100). The slides were<br>
wash in PBS twice at 5 min each followed by Mayers haematoxylin (Sigma, Cat# HHS-32) for 5 seconds.<br>
The samples were rinsed well in diH20 and dippeid twice briefly in the diluted (5ml stock in 1L of diH20)<br>
ammonium hydroxide solution (Sigma, Cat# A-6399) and rinsed in diH20 again. The samples were then<br>
dehydrated in the 70%, 90% and then 100% alcohol (Harleco, Cat# 65347/85) 1 minute each and finally in<br>
xylene (JT Baker, Cat# 516,09). The slides were mounted with Cytoseal 60 (Stephens Scientific, Cat<br>
#8310-4,) and covered with cover slips for image analysis. Shown in Figure 11 is the IHC image of<br>
human vessels (brown) of the M24met tumor in the human foreskin-SCID chimera mouse.<br>
Example 20. Therapeutic Treatment with the Anti-ALK-1 Antibody 1.12.KM29I/D19A)<br>
For treatment, the dosing was performed either subcutaneously (sc) or intravenously (iv).<br>
Typically one dose of the 1.12.1 (M29I/D19A) antibody was given for each study. The second dose of the<br>
ALK-1 antibody, if necessary, was administered on day 9 or 10. Some times multiple dose levels, i.e., 1,<br>
5, 10, 50 mg/kg, were administered to investigate dose-dependent inhibition of human vessel growth.<br>
Animals were monitored daily and tumors were measured three times/week by calipers. By day 14 -17<br>
the tumors were between 250-350 mm3 and were removed from the mice, embedded in OCT and frozen<br>
down for IF or IHC analysis. Shown in Figure 12 are representative immunofluorescent images of human<br>
(red) and mouse (green) vessels of the Control and 1.12.1(M29I/D19A) Treated (10 mg/kg) M24met<br>
tumors in the human foreskin scid chimera mouse. Dose-dependent inhibition of human tumor vessels by<br>
1.12.1(M29I/D19A) in the human foreskin SCID chimera mouse model is shown in Figure 13 and a<br>

Example 21. In vivo ECsn Determination<br>
Human foreskin SCID chimera mice were intradermally implanted with M24met cells and were<br>
treated (sc) with anti-ALK-1 antibody 1.12.1 (M29I/D19A) at 1, 3, 5, 7.5, 10 and 50 mg/kg or with isotype<br>
match anti-human KLH antibody (10 mg/kg). Upon the conclusion of the experiment, human vessel area<br>
in each tumor were quantified as described above. Mouse plasma concentrations of anti-ALK-1 antibody<br>
1.12.1(M29I/D19A) were measured using the method described as following: serum samples from mice<br>
were analyzed for anti-ALK-1 antibody 1.12.1(M29I/D19A) concentration by an ELISA (enzyme-linked<br>
immunosorbent Assay). ELISA plates were coated with 10 ug/ml goat anti-human IgG Fc specific antibody<br>
(Pierce, cat* 31123) in PBS, incubated overnight at 4ยฐC, and then blocked with StartBlock blocking buffer<br><br>
-100-<br>
(Pierce, cat# 37542) at room temperature for 1hr. Serum samples were diluted prior to the analysis 100<br>
and 1000-fold in StartBlock blocking buffer. Two sets of standards were prepared in the blank serum<br>
diluted 100 and 100-fold. Standards and diluted serum samples were incubated on the plate for 1hr.<br>
Bound anti-ALK-1 antibody 1.12.1(M29I/D19A) was detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled<br>
goat anti-human IgG (Fab-specific) antibody (Sigma, cat# A0293). The substrate used was 3, 3', 5, 5'-<br>
tetramethyl benzidine (Sigma, cai# T8665). Absorbance was read at 450nm on a Vmax plate reader<br>
(Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). A standard curve was fit using nonlinear regression. The detection<br>
limit of this assay was 10 ng/ml of anti-ALK-1 antibody 1.12.1 (M29I/D19A).<br>
SCID mouse plasma concentration of anti-ALK-1 antibody 1.12.1(M291/D19A) is shown in Figure<br>
15.<br>
Figure 15 represents the estimated EC50 for 1.12.1(M29I/D19A) in the M24met Foreskin SCID-<br>
chimera Model. Human vessel area was plotted against the average plasma PK across the study period<br>
(14 days) for each treatment group. A fitted curve was produced by the Sigmoidal Dose Dependent<br>
program in the Graphpad (Prizm). EC50 of 93 ng/ml (EC50 is defined as the plasma concentration required<br>
for a 50% reduction of human vessel area in the Control group) was derived from the curve fit.<br>
