HARQ PROCESS RESTRICTION AND TRANSMISSION OF NON-SCHEDULED<br>
CONTROL DATA VIA UPLINK CHANNELS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method and mobile terminal for performing a data<br>
allocation process for scheduled data, non-scheduled user data and non-scheduled<br>
control data obeying restrictions on the resource utilization defined by a scheduling grant<br>
and at least one non-scheduled grant. Further, the invention relates to a method for<br>
transmitting control signaling from a network entity in a radio access network of a mobile<br>
communication system controlling the radio resources of mobile terminals to at least one<br>
of said mobile terminal and the network entity in a radio access network.<br>
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND<br>
W-CDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) is a radio interface for IMT-2000<br>
(International Mobile Communication), which was standardized for use as the 3rd<br>
generation wireless mobile telecommunication system. It provides a variety of services<br>
such as voice services and multimedia mobile communication services in a flexible and<br>
efficient way. The standardization bodies in Japan, Europe, USA, and other countries<br>
have jointly organized a project called the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to<br>
produce common radio interface specifications for W-CDMA.<br>
The standardized European version of IMT-2000 is commonly called UMTS (Universal<br>
Mobile Telecommunication System). The first release of the specification of UMTS has<br>
been published in 1999 (Release 99). In the mean time several improvements to the<br>
standard have been standardized by the 3GPP in Release 4 and Release 5 and<br>
discussion on further improvements is ongoing under the scope of Release 6.<br>
The dedicated channel (DCH) for downlink and uplink and the downlink shared channel<br>
(DSCH) have been defined in Release 99 and Release 4. In the following years, the<br>
developers recognized that for providing multimedia services - or data services in<br>
general - high speed asymmetric access had to be implemented. In Release 5 the high-<br><br>
2<br>
speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) was introduced. The new high-speed downlink<br>
shared channel (HS-DSCH) provides downlink high-speed access to the user from the<br>
UMTS Radio Access Network (RAN) to the communication terminals, called user<br>
equipments in the UMTS specifications.<br>
UMTS Architecture<br>
The high level R99/4/5 architecture of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System<br>
(UMTS) is shown in Fig. 1 (see 3GPP TR 25.401: "UTRAN Overall Description",<br>
incorporated herein by reference; available from http://www.3gpp.org). The network<br>
elements are functionally grouped into the Core Network (CN) 101, the UMTS Terrestrial<br>
Radio Access Network (UTRAN) 102 and the User Equipment (UE) 103. The UTRAN<br>
102 is responsible for handling all radio-related functionality, while the CN 101 is<br>
responsible for routing calls and data connections to external networks. The<br>
interconnections of these network elements are defined by open interfaces (lu, Uu). It<br>
should be noted that UMTS system is modular and it is therefore possible to have<br>
several network elements of the same type.<br>
In the sequel two different architectures will be discussed. They are defined with respect<br>
to logical distribution of functions across network elements. In actual network<br>
deployment, each architecture may have different physical realizations meaning that two<br>
or more network elements may be combined into a single physical node.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates the current architecture of UTRAN. A number of Radio Network<br>
Controllers (RNCs) 201, 202 are connected to the CN 101. Each RNC 201, 202 controls<br>
one or several base stations (Node Bs) 203, 204, 205, 206, which in turn communicate<br>
with the user equipments. An RNC controlling several base stations is called Controlling<br>
RNC (C-RNC) for these base stations. A set of controlled base stations accompanied by<br>
their C-RNC is referred to as Radio Network Subsystem (RNS) 207, 208. For each<br>
connection between User Equipment and the UTRAN, one RNS is the Serving RNS (S-<br>
RNS). It maintains the so-called lu connection with the Core Network (CN) 101.<br>
Enhanced Uplink Dedicated Channel (E-DCH)<br>
Uplink enhancements for Dedicated Transport Channels (DTCH) were studied by the<br>
3GPP Technical Specification Group RAN (see 3GPP TR 25.896: "Feasibility Study for<br><br>
3<br>
Enhanced Uplink for UTRA FDD (Release 6)", incorporated herein by reference;<br>
available at http://www.3gpp.org). Since the use of IP-based services become more<br>
important, there is an increasing demand to improve the coverage and throughput of the<br>
RAN as well as to reduce the delay of the uplink dedicated transport channels.<br>
Streaming, interactive and background services could benefit from this enhanced uplink.<br>
One enhancement is the usage of adaptive modulation and coding schemes (AMC) in<br>
connection with Node B controlled scheduling, thus an enhancement of the Uu interface.<br>
In the existing R99/R4/R5 system the uplink maximum data rate control resides in the<br>
RNC. By relocating the scheduler in the Node B the latency introduced due to signaling<br>
on the interface between RNC and Node B may be reduced and thus the scheduler may<br>
be able to respond faster to temporal changes in the uplink load. This may reduce the<br>
overall latency in communications of the user equipment with the RAN. Therefore Node<br>
B controlled scheduling is capable of better controlling the uplink interference and<br>
smoothing the noise rise variance by allocating higher data rates quickly when the uplink<br>
load decreases and respectively by restricting the uplink data rates when the uplink load<br>
increases. The coverage and cell throughput may be improved by a better control of the<br>
uplink interference.<br>
Another technique, which may be considered to reduce the delay on the uplink, is<br>
introducing a shorter TTI (Transmission Time.Interval) length for the E-DCH compared to<br>
other transport channels. A transmission time interval length of 2ms is currently<br>
investigated for use on the E-DCH, while a transmission time interval of 10ms is<br>
commonly used on the other channels. Hybrid ARQ, which was one of the key<br>
technologies in HSDPA, is also considered for the enhanced uplink dedicated channel.<br>
The Hybrid ARQ protocol between a Node B and a user equipment allows for rapid<br>
retransmissions of erroneously received data units, and may thus reduce the number of<br>
RLC (Radio Link Control) retransmissions and the associated delays. This may improve<br>
the quality of service experienced by the end user.<br>
To support enhancements described above, a new MAC sub-layer is introduced which<br>
will be called MAC-e in the following (see 3GPP TSG RAN WG1, meeting #31, Tdoc<br>
R01-030284, "Scheduled and Autonomous Mode Operation for the Enhanced Uplink"<br>
incorporated herein by reference; available at http://www.3gpp.org). The entities of this<br>
new sub-layer, which will be described in more detail in the following sections, may be<br>
located in user equipment and Node B. On user equipment side, the MAC-e performs the<br><br>
4<br>
new task of multiplexing upper layer data (e.g. MAC-d) data into the new enhanced<br>
transport channels and operating HARQ protocol transmitting entities.<br>
Further, the MAC-e sub-layer may be terminated in the S-RNC during handover at the<br>
UTRAN side. Thus, the reordering buffer for the reordering functionality provided may<br>
also reside in the S-RNC.<br>
E-DCH MAC Architecture - UE side<br>
Fig. 3 shows the exemplary overall E-DCH MAC architecture on UE side. A new MAC<br>
functional entity, the MAC-e/es, is added to the MAC architecture of Release '99.<br>
The MAC interworking on the UE side is illustrated in Figure 4. There are M different data<br>
flows (MAC-d) carrying data packets from different applications to be transmitted from<br>
UE to Node B. These data flows can have different QoS requirements (e.g. delay and<br>
error requirements) and may require different configuration of HARQ instances. Each<br>
MAC-d flow represents a logical unit to which specific physical channel (e.g. gain factor)<br>
and HARQ (e.g. maximum number of retransmissions) attributes can be assigned.<br>
Further, MAC-d multiplexing is supported for an E-DCH, i.e. several logical channels with<br>
different priorities may be multiplexed onto the same MAC-d flow. Data of multiple MAC-<br>
d flows can be multiplexed in one MAC-e PDU (protocol data unit). In the MAC-e header,<br>
the DDI (Data Description Indicator) field identifies logical channel, MAC-d flow and<br>
MAC-d PDU size. A mapping table is signaled over RRC, to allow the UE to set DDI<br>
values. The N field indicates the number of consecutive MAC-d PDUs corresponding to<br>
the same DDI value.<br>
The MAC-e/es entity is depicted in more detail in Figure 5. The MAC-es/e handles the E-<br>
DCH specific functions. The selection of an appropriate transport format for the<br>
transmission of data on E-DCH is done in the E-TFC Selection entity, which represents a<br>
function entity. The transport format selection is done according to the scheduling<br>
information (Relative Grants and Absolute Grants) received from UTRAN via L1, the<br>
available transmit power, priorities, e.g. logical channel priorities. The HARQ entity<br>
handles the retransmission functionality for the user. One HARQ entity supports multiple<br>
HARQ processes. The HARQ entity handles all HARQ related functionalities required.<br>
The multiplexing entity is responsible for concatenating multiple MAC-d PDUs into MAC-<br>
es PDUs, and to multiplex one or multiple MAC-es PDUs into a single MAC-e PDU, to be<br><br>
transmitted at the next TTI, and as instructed by the E-TFC selection function. It is also<br>
responsible for managing and setting the TSN per logical channel for each MAC-es PDU.<br>
The MAC-e/es entity receives scheduling information from Node B (network side) via<br>
Layer 1 signaling as shown in Fig. 5. Absolute grants are received on E-AGCH<br>
(Enhanced Absolute Grant Channel), relative grants are received on the E-RGCH<br>
(Enhanced Relative Grant Channel).<br>
E-DCH MAC Architecture - UTRAN side<br>
An exemplary overall UTRAN MAC architecture is shown in Fig. 6. The UTRAN MAC<br>
architecture includes a MAC-e entity and a MAC-es entity. For each UE that uses an E-<br>
DCH, one MAC-e entity per Node-B and one MAC-es entity in the S-RNC are configured.<br>
The MAC-e entity is located in the Node B and controls access to the E-DCH. Further,<br>
the MAC-e entity is connected to MAC-es located in the S-RNC.<br>
In Fig. 7 the MAC-e entity in Node B is depicted in more detail. There is one MAC-e<br>
entity in Node B for each UE and one E-DCH scheduler function in the Node-B for all<br>
UEs. The MAC-e entity and E-DCH scheduler handle HSUPA (High-Speed Uplink<br>
Packet Access) specific functions in Node B. The E-DCH scheduling entity manages E-<br>
DCH cell resources between UEs. Commonly, scheduling assignments are determined<br>
and transmitted based on scheduling requests from the UEs. The De-multiplexing entity<br>
in the MAC-e entity provides de-multiplexing of MAC-e PDUs. MAC-es PDUs are then<br>
forwarded to the MAC-es entity in the S-RNC.<br>
One HARQ entity is capable of supporting multiple instances (HARQ processes), e.g.<br>
employing a stop and wait HARQ protocols. Each HARQ process is assigned a certain<br>
amount of the soft buffer memory for combining the bits of the packets from outstanding<br>
retransmissions. Furthermore each process is responsible for generating ACKs or<br>
NACKs indicating delivery status of E-DCH transmissions. The HARQ entity handles all<br>
tasks that are required for the HARQ protocol.<br>
In Fig. 8 the MAC-es entity in the S-RNC is shown. It comprises the reordering buffer<br>
which provides in-sequence delivery to RLC and handles the combining of data from<br>
different Node Bs in case of soft handover. The combining is referred to as Macro<br>
diversity selection combining.<br><br>
6<br>
It should be noted that the required soft buffer size depends on the used HARQ scheme,<br>
e.g. an HARQ scheme using incremental redundancy (IR) requires more soft buffer than<br>
one with chase combining (CC).<br>
MAC-e PDU format<br>
As indicated in Fig. 10 and 11, for an E-DCH there exist two MAC sublayers: MAC-e and<br>
MAC-es. The MAC-es layer "sits on top" of MAC-e layer and receives PDUs directly from<br>
MAC-d layer on UE side. MAC-es SDUs (i.e. MAC-d PDUs) of same size provided by a<br>
particular logical channel may be multiplexed to a single MAC-es payload (SDL) =<br>
Service Data Unit). This multiplexed payload data is preceded by a MAC-es header. The<br>
MAC-es header is also referred to as a framing header. The number of PDUs, as well as<br>
the DDI value identifying the logical channel, the MAC-d flow and the MAC-es SDU size<br>
are included as part of the MAC-e header. Multiple MAC-es PDUs, but only one MAC-e<br>
PDU can be transmitted in a TTI.<br>
The field DDI (Data Description Indicator) field comprises a specific DDI value indicating<br>
that whether there is more than one MAC-es PDU included in the MAC-e PDU. This<br>
header will not be associated with a new MAC-es payload.<br>
Packet Scheduling<br>
Packet scheduling may be a radio resource management algorithm used for allocating<br>
transmission opportunities and transmission formats to the users admitted to a shared<br>
medium. Scheduling may be used in packet based mobile radio networks in combination<br>
with adaptive modulation and coding to maximize throughput/capacity by e.g. allocating<br>
transmission opportunities to the users in favorable channel conditions. The packet data<br>
service in UMTS may be applicable for the interactive and background traffic classes,<br>
though it may also be used for streaming services. Traffic belonging to the interactive<br>
and background classes is treated as non real time (NRT) traffic and is controlled by the<br>
packet scheduler. The packet scheduling methodologies can be characterized by:<br>
•	Scheduling period/frequency: The period over which users are scheduled<br>
ahead in time.<br>
•	Serve order: The order in which users are served, e.g. random order (round<br>
robin) or according to channel quality (C/l or throughput based).<br><br>
7<br>
• Allocation method: The criterion for allocating resources, e.g. same data amount<br>
or same power/code/time resources for all queued users per allocation interval.<br>
In 3GPP UMTS R99/R4/R5, the packet scheduler for uplink is distributed between Radio<br>
Network Controller (RNC) and user equipment (UE). On the uplink, the air interface<br>
resource to be shared by different users is the total received power at a Node B, and<br>
consequently the task of the scheduler is to allocate the power among the user<br>
equipment(s). In current UMTS R99/R4/R5 specifications the RNC controls the maximum<br>
rate/power a user equipment is allowed to transmit during uplink transmission by<br>
allocating a set of different transport formats (modulation scheme, code rate, etc.) to<br>
each user equipment.<br>
The establishment and reconfiguration of such a TFCS (transport format combination<br>
set) may be accomplished using Radio Resource Control (RRC) messaging between<br>
RNC and user equipment. The user equipment is allowed to autonomously choose<br>
among the allocated transport format combinations based on its own status e.g. available<br>
power and buffer status. In current UMTS R99/R4/R5 specifications there is no control<br>
on time imposed on the uplink user equipment transmissions. The scheduler may e.g.<br>
operate on transmission time interval basis.<br>
E-DCH - Node B controlled scheduling<br>
Node B controlled scheduling is one of the technical features for E-DCH which may<br>
enable more efficient use of the uplink resources in order to provide a higher cell<br>
throughput in the uplink and may increase the coverage. The term "Node B controlled<br>
scheduling" denotes the possibility for a Node B to control uplink resources, e.g. the E-<br>
DPDCH/DPCCH power ratio, which the UE may use for uplink transmissions on the E-<br>
DCH within limits set by the S-RNC. Node B controlled scheduling is based on uplink and<br>
downlink control signaling together with a set of rules on how the UE should behave with<br>
respect to this signaling.<br>
In the downlink, a resource indication (scheduling grant) is required to indicate to the UE<br>
the (maximum) amount of uplink resources it may use. When issuing scheduling grants,<br>
the Node B may use QoS-related information provided by the S-RNC and from the UE in<br>
the scheduling requests to determine the appropriate allocation of resources for servicing<br>
the UE at the requested QoS parameters.<br><br>
8<br>
For the UMTS E-DCH, there are commonly two different UE scheduling modes defined<br>
depending on the type of scheduling grants used. In the following the characteristics of<br>
the scheduling grants are described.<br>
Scheduling Grants<br>
Scheduling grants are signaled in the downlink in order to indicate the (maximum)<br>
resource the UE may use for uplink transmissions. The grants affect the selection of a<br>
suitable transport format (TF) for the transmission on the E-DCH (E-TFC selection).<br>
However, they usually do not influence the TFC selection (Transport Format<br>
Combination) for legacy dedicated channels.<br>
There are commonly two types of scheduling grants which are used for the Node B<br>
controlled scheduling:<br>
•	absolute grants (AGs), and<br>
•	relative grants (RGs)<br>
The absolute grants provide an absolute limitation of the maximum amount of uplink<br>
resources the UE is allowed to use for uplink transmissions. Absolute grants are<br>
especially suitable to rapidly change the allocated UL resources.<br>
Relative grants are transmitted every TTI (Transmission Time Interval). They may be<br>
used to adapt the allocated uplink resources indicated by absolute grants by granular<br>
adjustments: A relative grant indicates the UE to increase or decrease the previously<br>
allowed maximum uplink resources by a certain offset (step).<br>
Absolute grants are only signaled from the E-DCH serving cell. Relative grants can be<br>
signaled from the serving cell as well as from a non-serving cell. The E-DCH serving cell<br>
denotes the entity (e.g. Node B) actively allocating uplink resources to UEs controlled by<br>
this serving cell, whereas a non-serving cell can only limit the allocated uplink resources,<br>
set by the serving cell. Each UE has only one serving cell.<br>
Absolute grants may be valid for a single UE. An absolute grant valid for a single UE is<br>
referred to in the following as a "dedicated grant. Alternatively, an absolute grant may<br>
also be valid for a group of or all UEs within a cell. An absolute grant valid for a group of<br><br>
9<br>
or all UEs will be referred to as a "common grant" in the following. The UE does not<br>
distinguish between common and dedicated grants.<br>
Relative grants can be sent from serving cell as well as from a non-serving cell as<br>
already mentioned before. A relative grant signaled from the serving cell may indicate<br>
one of the three values, "UP", "HOLD" and "DOWN". "UP" respectively "DOWN" indicates<br>
the increase/decrease of the previously maximum used uplink resources (maximum<br>
power ratio) by one step. Relative grants from a non-serving ceii can either signai a<br>
"HOLD" or "DOWN" command to the UE. As mentioned before relative grants from non-<br>
serving cells can only limit the uplink resources set by the serving cell (overload<br>
indicator) but can not increase the resources that can be used by a UE.<br>
UE scheduling operation<br>
This sections only outlines the principal scheduling operation, more details on the<br>
scheduling procedure is provided in 3GPP TS25.309.<br>
The UE maintains a Serving Grant (SG) which is common to all HARQ process, which<br>
indicates the maximum power ratio (E-DPDCH/DPCCH) the UE is allowed for the E-TFC<br>
selection. The SG is updated by the scheduling grants signaled from serving/non-serving<br>
cells. When the UE receives an absolute grant from the serving cell the SG is set to the<br>
power ratio signaled in the absolute grant. The absolute grant can activate/deactivate a<br>
single or all HARQ processes. As already mentioned before, an absolute grant can be<br>
received on primary or secondary E-RNT1. There are some precedence rules for the<br>
usage of primary/secondary absolute grants. A primary absolute grant always affects the<br>
SG immediately. Secondary absolute grants only affect the SG if the last primary<br>
absolute grant deactivated all HARQ processes, or if the last absolute grant that affected<br>
the SG was received with the secondary E-RNTI. When the transmission from primary to<br>
secondary E-RNTI is triggered, by deactivating all HARQ processes, the UE updates the<br>
Serving Grant with the latest received absolute grant on the secondary E-RNTI.<br>
Therefore UE needs to listen to both primary and secondary E-RNTIs.<br>
When no absolute grant is received from the serving cell the UE shall follow the relative<br>
grants from the serving cell, which are signaled every TTI. A serving relative Grant is<br>
interpreted relative to the UE power ratio in the previous TTI for the same hybrid ARQ<br>
process as the transmission, which the relative Grant will affect. Fig. 9 illustrates the<br>
timing relation for relative grants. The assumption here is that there are 4 HARQ<br><br>
10<br>
processes. The relative grant received by the UE, which affects the SG of the first HARQ<br>
process, is relative to the first HARQ process of the previous TTI (reference process).<br>
Since a synchronous HARQ protocol is adopted for E-DCH the different HARQ<br>
processes are served successively.<br>
The UE behavior in accordance to serving E-DCH relative grants is shown in the<br>
following:<br>
	When the UE receives an "UP" command from Serving E-DCH RLS<br>
	New SG = Last used power ratio + Delta<br>
• When the UE receives a "DOWN" command from Serving E-DCH RLS<br>
	New SG = Last used power ratio - Delta<br>
The "UP" and "DOWN" command is relative to the power ratio used for E-DCH<br>
transmission in the reference HARQ process. The new Serving Grant (SG) for all HARQ<br>
processes, affected by the relative grant, is an increase respectively decrease of the last<br>
used power ratio in the reference HARQ process. The "HOLD" command indicates that<br>
the SG remains unchanged.<br>
As already mentioned before a Node B from a non-serving RLS is only allowed to send<br>
relative grants, which can either indicate a "HOLD" or "DOWN". The "DOWN" command<br>
enables non-serving ceils to limit the intercell-interference caused by UEs which are in<br>
SHO with these non-serving cells. The UE behavior upon reception of non-serving<br>
relative grants is as follows:<br>
	When the UE receives a "DOWN" from at least one Non-serving E-DCH RLS<br>
	new SG = Last used power ratio - Delta<br>
Relative grants from a non-serving RLS affect always all HARQ processes in the UE.<br>
The amount of reduction of the used power ratio might be static or depending on the bit<br>
rate, for higher bit rates there might be a larger step size (Delta).<br>
When the UE receives a scheduling grant from the serving RLS and a "DOWN"<br>
command from at least one non-serving RL:<br><br>
11<br>
•	new SG = minimum(last used power ratio-delta, received AG/RG from serving<br>
RLS)<br>
Rate Request signaling<br>
In order to enable Node B to schedule efficiently while considering also the QoS<br>
requirements of a service mapped on the E-DCH, an UE provides the Node B<br>
information on its QoS requirements by means of rate request signaling.<br>
There are two kinds of rate request signaling information on the uplink: the so called<br>
"happy bit", which is a flag related to a rate request on the E-DPCCH and the scheduling<br>
information (SI), which is commonly sent in-band on the E-DCH.<br>
From a system point of view, the one-bit rate request may be advantageously used by<br>
the serving cell to effect small adjustments in the resource allocation for example by<br>
means of relative grants. On the contrary, scheduling information may advantageously<br>
be employed for making longer term scheduling decisions, which would be reflected in<br>
the transmission of an absolute grant. Details on the two rate request signaling methods<br>
are provided in the following.<br>
Scheduling Information sent on E-DCH<br>
As mentioned before the scheduling information should provide Node B information on<br>
the UE status in order to allow for an efficient scheduling. Scheduling information may be<br>
included in the header of a MAC-e PDU. The information is commonly sent periodically<br>
to Node B in order to allow the Node B to keep track of the UE status. E.g. the<br>
scheduling information comprises following information fields:<br>
•	Logical channel ID of the highest priority data in the scheduling information<br>
•	UE buffer occupancy (in Bytes)<br><br>
•	Buffer status for the highest priority logical channel with data in buffer<br>
•	Total buffer status<br>
•	Power status information<br><br>
12<br>
•	Estimation of the available power ratio versus DPCCH (taking into account<br>
HS-DPCCH). UE should not take power of DCHs into account when<br>
performing the estimation<br>
Identifying the logical channel by the logical channel ID from which the highest priority<br>
data originates may enable the Node B to determine the QoS requirements, e.g. the<br>
corresponding MAC-d flow power offset, logical channel priority or GBR (Guaranteed Bit<br>
Rate) attribute, of this particular logical channel. This in turn enables the Node B to<br>
determine the next scheduling grant message required to transmit the data in the UE<br>
buffer, which allows for a more precise grant allocation. In addition to the highest priority<br>
data buffer status, it may be beneficial for the Node B to have some information on the<br>
total buffer status. This information may help in making decisions on the "long-term"<br>
resource allocation.<br>
In order for the serving Node B to be able to allocate uplink resources effectively, it<br>
needs to know up to what power each UE is able to transmit. This information could be<br>
conveyed in the form of a "power headroom" measurement, indicating how much power<br>
the UE has left over on top of that what is used for DPCCH transmissions (power status).<br>
The power status report could also be used for the triggering of a TTI reconfiguration,<br>
e.g. switching between 2ms and 10ms TTI and vice versa.<br>
Happy Bit<br>
As already explained above the happy bit denotes a one-bit rate request related flag,<br>
which is sent on the E-DPCCH. The "happy bit" indicates whether the respective UE is<br>
"happy" or "unhappy" with the current serving grant (SG).<br>
The UE indicates that it is "unhappy", if both of the following criteria are met:<br>
•	Power status criterion: UE has power available to send at higher data rates (E-<br>
TFCs) and<br>
•	Buffer occupancy criterion: Total buffer status would require more than n TTIs with<br>
the current Grants (where n is configurable).<br>
Otherwise, the UE indicates that it is "happy" with the current serving grant.<br><br>
13<br>
Scheduled and non-scheduled data transmission<br>
In a common UMTS system, there are two categories (or types) of data transmissions for<br>
Enhanced Uplink (utilizing an EDCH), scheduled and non-scheduled transmissions.<br>
For scheduled data transmissions, the UE requires a valid scheduling grant before<br>
transmitting data on E-DCH. The usual procedure is that UE sends a rate request to the<br>
serving Node B by means of either scheduling information or happy bit. Upon reception<br>
of the rate request serving Node B allocates uplink resources by means of scheduling<br>
grants, i.e. absolute and relative grants, to the UE.<br>
In case of non-scheduled data transmission, the UE is allowed to send E-DCH data at<br>
any time, up to a configured number of bits, without receiving any scheduling command<br>
from the Node B. Thus, signaling overhead and scheduling delay may be minimized. The<br>
resource for non-scheduled transmission is given by the RRC entity (usually the S-RNC)<br>
in terms of a maximum number of bits the UE is allowed include in a MAC-e PDU for<br>
transmission in a TTI, and is called non-scheduled grant. A non-scheduled grant is may<br>
be defined per MAC-d flow. Consequently, logical channels mapped to a non-scheduled<br>
MAC-d flow may only transmit up to the non-scheduled grant configured for the<br>
respective MAC-d flow. In order to allow the Node Bs serving a particular UE to take into<br>
account the possible rise over thermal (RoT) resulting from the UE due to the<br>
transmission of non-scheduled data, the Node B(s) is/are informed on the non-scheduled<br>
grants assigned to the UE via NBAP signaling (Node B Application Part signaling) from<br>
the UTRAN. The UE receives the non-scheduled grants via RRC signaling. There is a<br>
set of rules defining the handling of non-scheduled and scheduled data flows.<br>
•	The UTRAN may restrict a non-scheduled MAC-d flow to use only a limited number<br>
of HARQ processes in case of 2ms TTI (so called HARQ process restriction). For<br>
non-scheduled grants, a Node B has always to reserve the configured resources,<br>
i.e. maximum number of bits, in its scheduling decisions.<br>
In order to limit the amount of resources, which may be fairly significant especially<br>
for the 2ms TTI case, the Node B has to permanently reserve for non-scheduled<br>
transmissions, the UTRAN (commonly the S-RNC) can disable certain HARQ<br>
processes for non-scheduled MAC-d flows. The allocation of HARQ processes for<br>
non-scheduled MAC-d flows is configured via RRC signaling.<br><br>
14<br>
•	UTRAN may also reserve some HARQ processes for non-scheduled transmission<br>
(i.e. scheduled data cannot be sent using these processes, the processes are<br>
considered disabled) in case of 2ms TTI.<br>
•	Multiple non-scheduled MAC-d flows may be configured in parallel by the S-RNC<br>
and may be multiplexed to a single transport channel for transmission using one of<br>
the available HARQ processes. In this case, the UE is commonly allowed to<br>
transmit non-scheduled data up to the sum of bits indicated by the corresponding<br>
non-scheduled grant, if several MAC-d flows are multiplexed in a TTI.<br>
•	Scheduled grants will be considered on top of non-scheduled transmissions<br>
•	Logical channels mapped on a non-scheduled MAC-d flow cannot transmit data<br>
using a valid Scheduling Grant.<br>
As can be seen from the rules, the resource allocation from UTRAN side is separated by<br>
assigning scheduled and non-scheduled grants to the UEs. Also within the UE the<br>
allocation of resources to logical channels is done in accordance to scheduled and non-<br>
scheduled grants. Logical channels will be served in the order of their priorities until the<br>
non-scheduled grants and scheduled grants are exhausted, or the maximum transmit<br>
power is reached.<br>
Transport channels and E-TFC Selection<br>
In third generation mobile communication systems, data generated at higher layers is<br>
commonly transmitted via the air interface using so-called transport channels, which are<br>
mapped to different physical channels in the physical layer. Transport channels are<br>
services offered by the physical layer to Medium Access Control (MAC) layer for<br>
information transfer. The transport channels are primarily divided into two types:<br>
	First, common transport channels requiring an explicit identification of the receiving<br>
UE. This type of transport channel may for example be used, if the data on the<br>
transport channel is intended for a specific UE or a sub-set of all UEs (no UE<br>
identification is needed for broadcast transport channels).<br>
	Second, dedicated transport channels, where the receiving UE is implicitly identified<br>
by the physical channel carrying the transport channel<br><br>
15<br>
The E-DCH is a dedicated transport channel. The data is transmitted via a transport<br>
channel in transport blocks, wherein there is one transport block transmitted in a given<br>
time interval, referred to as a transmission time interval (TTI). A transport block is the<br>
basic data unit exchanged over transport channels, i.e. between the physical layer and<br>
MAC layer. Transport blocks arrive to or are delivered by the physical layer once every<br>
TTI. In case of transmissions via the E-DCH a transport block corresponds to a MAC-e<br>
PDU.<br>
Enhanced transport format combination (E-TFC) restriction/selection is the procedure in<br>
which the UE selects the amount of data to transmit within a transmission time interval<br>
(TTI). The aim of the E-TFC selection process is to transmit as many data as possible<br>
with the transmit power available to the UE. The E-TFC restriction process considers the<br>
amount of transmission power remaining for E-DCH transmissions after transmission of<br>
data on DCH channels and HS-DPCCH and eliminates transmission formats due to<br>
power limitation. The E-TFC selection procedure, which is responsible for the selection of<br>
an appropriate transport format for the transmission of data on E-DCH as described<br>
before, is invoked by the HARQ entity in MAC-e/es. The E-TFC restriction procedure,<br>
which is described in 3GPP TS 25.133: "Requirements for support of radio resource<br>
management (FDD)" in more detail.<br>
For each MAC-d flow multiplexed to a transport channel, radio resource control RRC<br>
configures the MAC layer with a HARQ profile and a multiplexing list. The HARQ profile<br>
includes the power offset and maximum number of HARQ transmissions to use for a<br>
respective MAC-d flow. The multiplexing list identifies for each MAC-d flow, the other<br>
MAC-d flows from which data can be multiplexed in a transmission that uses the power<br>
offset included in its HARQ profile.<br>
RRC may control the scheduling of uplink data by giving each logical channel a priority<br>
(for example between 1 and 8, where 1 is the highest priority and 8 the lowest). E-TFC<br>
selection in the UE is commonly done in accordance with the priorities indicated by RRC.<br>
Logical channels have absolute priority, i.e. the UE may maximize the transmission of<br>
higher priority data.<br>
RRC may further allocate non-scheduled transmission grants to individual MAC-d flows<br>
in order to reduce the transmission delays. Each non-scheduled grant is applicable for a<br>
specific set of HARQ processes indicated by RRC as already mentioned above. RRC<br>
may also restrict the set of HARQ processes for which scheduled grants are applicable.<br><br>
16<br>
For each configured MAC-d flow, a given E-TFC can be in any of the following states:<br>
•	Supported state<br>
•	Blocked state<br>
At each TTI boundary, the UEs with an E-DCH transport channel configured may<br>
determine the state of each E-TFC for every MAC-d flow configured based on its<br>
required transmit power versus the maximum UE transmit.<br>
Further, at every TTI boundary for which a new transmission is requested by the HARQ<br>
entity, i.e. in case of retransmissions no E-TFC selection is performed, the UE may<br>
perform the operations described in the following. For an E-DCH in UMTS, the<br>
Scheduling Grant provides the E-TFC selection function with the maximum E-DPDCH to<br>
DPCCH ratio that the UE is allowed to allocate for the upcoming transmission time<br>
interval for scheduled data. Based on the HARQ process ID and the RRC configuration,<br>
the UE determines whether to take the scheduled and non-scheduled grants into account<br>
for the transmission in the upcoming transmission time interval. If for example a non-<br>
scheduled grant is disabled (inactive) for the HARQ process ID used in the upcoming<br>
transmission time interval, then this non-scheduled grant is assumed to not exist, i.e. set<br>
to zero.<br>
The transmission format and data allocation process done during E-TFC selection may<br>
inter alia follow the requirements below:<br>
Only the data from logical channels for which a non-zero grant is available may be<br>
considered as available;<br>
The data allocation should maximize the transmission of higher priority data;<br>
The amount of data from MAC-d flows for which non-scheduled grants were<br>
configured may not exceed the value of the non-scheduled grant;<br>
The total amount of data from MAC-d flows for which no non-scheduled grants<br>
were configured shall not exceed the largest payload that can be transmitted based on<br>
the Scheduling Grant and the power offset from the selected HARQ profile; In the case<br>
where the HARQ process is inactive, the UE shall not include any such data in the<br>
transmission;<br>
Only E-TFCs in supported state shall be considered;<br><br>
17<br>
Once an appropriate E-TFC and data allocation are found, the "Multiplexing and TSN<br>
Setting" entity generates a MAC-e PDU which is passed to the HARQ process identified<br>
by the HARQ process ID for transmission.<br>
The E-TFC selection function shall provide this MAC-e PDU and transmission HARQ<br>
profile to the HARQ entity. The HARQ entity shall also be informed of whether the<br>
transmission includes Scheduling Information.<br>
Summarizing, in the UMTS system currently discussed by the 3GPP, data transmitted on<br>
an E-DCH are categorized in scheduled data and non-scheduled data. As described<br>
before, MAC-e control signaling like framing headers or Scheduling Information (SI)<br>
needs to be accounted for by the E-TFC selection procedure. Scheduling Information are<br>
thereby handled as non-scheduled data for which a valid non-scheduled grant is<br>
assumed. The introduction of a HARQ process restriction allows a Node B to only<br>
reserve resources for non-scheduled data transmissions for particular HARQ processes.<br>
However, the newly introduces HARQ process restriction for non-scheduled data on the<br>
other hand creates new problems, as for example Scheduling Information handled as<br>
non-scheduled data may only be transmitted in the processes for which the non-<br>
scheduled grant is valid. This may imply a significant delay to the signaling of scheduling<br>
information resulting in a scheduling delay. Delayed scheduling decisions by the serving<br>
Node B will in turn reduce the uplink throughput and thereby degrades the quality of<br>
service QoS experienced for the different services, which is especially critical, if certain<br>
QoS requirements need to be met by a service.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to reduce the delays to control signaling implied by a<br>
conventional HARQ process restriction mechanism thereby overcoming the problems<br>
described above.<br>
The object is solved by the subject matter of the independent claims. Advantageous<br>
embodiments of the invention are subject matters to the dependent claims.<br>
In view of the problems outlined above, it is recognized that the negative impacts implied<br>
by the HARQ process restriction mechanism described above will impact all mechanisms<br>
requiring the uplink signaling of control data in case these control data is handled as non-<br>
scheduled data and subjected to the HARQ process restriction. Therefore the invention<br><br>
18<br>
does not only propose a specific solution of the object above for the signaling of<br>
scheduling information, but a solution of the problem for non-scheduled control data in<br>
general. According to one main aspects of the invention, the object is solved by a new<br>
categorization of uplink data into scheduled data, non-scheduled user data and non-<br>
scheduled control data and by a new definition of the HARQ process restriction<br>
mechanism. According to the invention, the restriction of the validity of a non-scheduled<br>
grant to a subset of HARQ processes is only allowed for enabling/disabling the<br>
transmission of non-scheduled user data in the respective HARQ processes for which<br>
the non-scheduled grant is valid. The transmission of non-scheduled control data, for<br>
example Scheduling Information or a Framing Header, may not be restricted to a subset<br>
of the available HARQ processes, i.e. non-scheduled control data may be transmitted<br>
using each of the available HARQ processes as needed. According to another aspect of<br>
the invention and in view of the new categorization of uplink data and the new definition<br>
of the HARQ process restriction, the invention further proposes a new data allocation<br>
process, which multiplexes the different types of uplink data to a transport channel<br>
according to the data's category, a scheduling grant and a non-scheduled grant thereby<br>
taking into account the settings of the HARQ process restrictions.<br>
According to one advantageous embodiment of the invention, a method for performing a<br>
data allocation process for scheduled data, non-scheduled user data and non-scheduled<br>
control data obeying restrictions on the resource utilization defined by a scheduling grant<br>
and at least one non-scheduled grant is provided.<br>
Generally, a scheduling grant indicates the maximum amount of resources a mobile<br>
terminal in a wireless communication system is allowed to utilize for transmitting the<br>
scheduled data on an uplink channel within a transmission time interval. Further, a non-<br>
scheduled grant indicates the maximum amount of resources a mobile terminal is<br>
allowed to utilize for transmitting non-scheduled data on the uplink channel within a<br>
transmission time interval.<br>
According to this advantageous embodiment of the invention, a non-scheduled grant is<br>
restricted to a subset of a plurality of HARQ processes thereby activating the HARQ<br>
processes of the subset for transmitting non-scheduled user data. The restriction<br>
deactivates the remaining HARQ processes of the plurality of HARQ process for<br>
transmitting non-scheduled user data and does not deactivate the remaining HARQ<br><br>
19<br>
processes for transmitting non-scheduled control data. In other words, all HARQ<br>
processes available may be activated for transmitting non-scheduled control data.<br>
For a next transmission time interval, scheduled data, non-scheduled user data and non-<br>
scheduled control data pending for uplink transmission are multiplexed to a packet data<br>
unit of a transport channel for transmission on the uplink channel within the next<br>
transmission time interval using one of the plurality of HARQ processes. Thereby, the<br>
scheduled data, the non-scheduled user data and the non-scheduled control data<br>
pending for uplink transmission are multiplexed according to the scheduling grant and<br>
the corresponding non-scheduled grant thereby taking into account whether the HARQ<br>
process to be used in the next transmission time interval is active for the transmission of<br>
non-scheduled user data.<br>
Further, the packet data unit is provided for transmission on the uplink channel in the<br>
next transmission time interval to the HARQ process to be used in the next transmission<br>
time interval.<br>
In an advantageous variation of this embodiment, the non-scheduled control data<br>
pending for transmission is multiplexed to the packet data unit provided to the HARQ<br>
process to be used in the next transmission time interval for transmission, even if the<br>
HARQ process has been deactivated for transmitting non-scheduled user data.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention provides an alternative method for performing a<br>
data allocation process for scheduled data, non-scheduled user data and non-scheduled<br>
contro\ data obeying restrictions on the resource utilization defined by a scheduling grant<br>
and at least one non-scheduled grant.<br>
According to this alternative embodiment, a non-scheduled grant is defined by the mobile<br>
terminal to be valid for a subset of a plurality of HARQ processes. The HARQ processes<br>
of the subset are activated for the transmission of non-scheduled user data, while the<br>
remaining HARQ processes for which the non-scheduled grant is invalid are deactivated<br>
for the transmission of non-scheduled user data.<br>
Further, for a next transmission time interval, scheduled data, non-scheduled user data<br>
and non-scheduled control data pending for uplink transmission are multiplexed to a<br>
packet data unit of a transport channel for transmission on the uplink channel within the<br>
next transmission time interval using one of the plurality of HARQ processes. Thereby<br>
the scheduled data, the non-scheduled user data and the non-scheduled control data<br><br>
20<br>
pending for uplink transmission are multiplexed according to the scheduling grant and<br>
the corresponding non-scheduled grant thereby taking into account whether a non-<br>
scheduled grant has been defined valid or invalid for the HARQ process to be used in the<br>
next transmission time interval.<br>
Next, the packet data unit is provided to the HARQ process to be used in the next<br>
transmission time interval for transmission on the uplink channel in the next transmission<br>
time interval. The HARQ process to be used in the next transmission time interval is<br>
thereby (always) assumed to be activated for the transmission of non-scheduled control<br>
data.<br>
In a variation of the embodiment, non-scheduled control data pending for transmission is<br>
multiplexed to the packet data unit provided to the HARQ process to be used in the next<br>
transmission time interval for transmission, even if the HARQ process is deactivated for a<br>
non-scheduled grant.<br>
In a further, alternative variation of this embodiment, non-scheduled control data pending<br>
for transmission is multiplexed to the packet data unit provided to the HARQ process to<br>
be used in the next transmission time interval for transmission, even if a non-scheduled<br>
grant is invalid for the HARQ process.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the non-scheduled control data may<br>
fore example comprise data for scheduling related control signaling or data for MAC<br>
framing header signaling.<br>
In a further embodiment, it is assumed that a non-scheduling grant is valid for non-<br>
scheduled user data and non-scheduled control data. In this case, the non-scheduled<br>
grant indicates the maximum amount of resources the mobile terminal is allowed to<br>
utilize for transmitting non-scheduled user data and non-scheduled control data.<br>
According to a variation of this embodiment, the non-scheduled control data pending for<br>
transmission is multiplexed to the packet data unit provided to the HARQ process to be<br>
used in the next transmission time interval, even the non-scheduled grant grants an<br>
amount of resources for the transmission of non-scheduled data not sufficient to transmit<br>
the non-scheduled control data within the next transmission time interval.<br>
In another embodiment it is assumed that there a separate non-scheduled grants valid<br>
for non-scheduled user data and non-scheduled control data. Consequently, a separate<br><br>
21<br>
non-scheduled grant indicating the maximum amount of resources the mobile terminal is<br>
allowed to utilize for the transmission of non-scheduled control data is allocated.<br>
Further, it may be adventurous that the amount of resources indicated by the separate<br>
non-scheduled grant is always defined or assumed to be sufficiently large to allow for the<br>
transmission of the non-scheduled control data in the HARQ process to be used in the<br>
next transmission time interval.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, control signaling from a network entity<br>
controlling the radio resource of the mobile terminal comprising an information element<br>
indicating the restriction of a non-scheduled grant to a subset of a plurality of HARQ<br>
processes is received by the mobile terminal and the mobile terminal restricts the non-<br>
scheduled grant to a subset of a plurality of HARQ processes according to the control<br>
signaling.<br>
It may be further desirable that the maximum amount of resources indicated by a non-<br>
scheduled grant is indicated by the amount of data the mobile terminal is allowed to<br>
utilize for transmitting non-scheduled data on the uplink channel within a transmission<br>
time interval.<br>
Moreover, in another embodiment of the invention, the maximum amount of resources<br>
indicated by the scheduling grant is indicated by a power ratio between the enhanced<br>
dedicated physical data channel E-DPDCH and the dedicated physical control channel<br>
DPCCH.<br>
Further, it may be advantageous if a scheduling grant and at least one of a non-<br>
scheduled grant is received by the mobile terminal from a radio access network of the<br>
mobile communication system or is set by the mobile terminal.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention relates to a mobile terminal for use in a wireless<br>
communication system. The mobile terminal may be adapted to perform a data allocation<br>
process for scheduled data, non-scheduled user data and non-scheduled control data<br>
obeying restrictions on the resource utilization defined by a scheduling grant and at least<br>
one non-scheduled grant.<br>
As defined previously, the scheduling grant may indicate the maximum amount of<br>
resources the mobile terminal is allowed to utilize for transmitting the scheduled data on<br>
an uplink channel within a transmission time interval, while a non-scheduled grant may<br><br>
22<br>
indicate the maximum amount of resources the mobile terminal is allowed to utilize for<br>
transmitting non-scheduled data on the uplink channel within a transmission time<br>
interval.<br>
The mobile terminal may comprise a processing unit, such as a general purpose<br>
processor, Digital Signal Processor, etc., for restricting a non-scheduled grant to a<br>
subset of a plurality of HARQ processes thereby activating the HARQ processes of the<br>
subset for transmitting non-scheduled user data. The restriction deactivates the<br>
remaining HARQ processes of the plurality of HARQ process for transmitting non-<br>
scheduled user data and does not deactivate the remaining HARQ processes for<br>
transmitting non-scheduled control data.<br>
Further, the mobile terminal may comprise a multiplexer for multiplexing, for a next<br>
transmission time interval, scheduled data, non-scheduled user data and non-scheduled<br>
control data pending for uplink transmission to a packet data unit of a transport channel<br>
for transmission on the uplink channel within the next transmission time interval using<br>
one of the plurality of HARQ processes. The multiplexer may be adapted to multiplex the<br>
scheduled data, the non-scheduled user data and the non-scheduled control data<br>
pending for uplink transmission according to the scheduling grant and the corresponding<br>
non-scheduled grant thereby taking into account whether the HARQ process to be used<br>
in the next transmission time interval is active for the transmission of non-scheduled user<br>
data. The multiplexer may be further adapted to provide the packet data unit for<br>
transmission on the uplink channel in the next transmission time interval to the HARQ<br>
process to be used in the next transmission time interval.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the multiplexer is further adapted to multiplex the<br>
non-scheduled control data pending for transmission is to the packet data unit provided<br>
to the HARQ process to be used in the next transmission time interval for transmission,<br>
even if the HARQ process has been deactivated for transmitting non-scheduled user<br>
data.<br>
Another embodiment provides a further mobile terminal for use in a wireless<br>
communication system adapted to perform a data allocation process for scheduled data,<br>
non-scheduled user data and non-scheduled control data obeying restrictions on the<br>
resource utilization defined by a scheduling grant and at least one non-scheduled grant.<br><br>
23<br>
This mobile terminal may also comprise a processing unit for defining a non-scheduled<br>
grant to be valid for a subset of a plurality of HARQ processes. The HARQ processes of<br>
the subset are activated for the transmission of non-scheduled user data, while the<br>
remaining HARQ processes for which the non-scheduled grant is invalid are deactivated<br>
for the transmission of non-scheduled user data.<br>
Further the mobile terminal may comprise a multiplexer for multiplexing, for a next<br>
transmission time interval, scheduled data, non-scheduled user data and non-scheduled<br>
control data pending for uplink transmission to a packet data unit of a transport channel<br>
for transmission on the uplink channel within the next transmission time interval using<br>
one of the plurality of HARQ processes. The multiplexer may be adapted to multiplex the<br>
scheduled data, the non-scheduled user data and the non-scheduled control data<br>
pending for uplink transmission according to the scheduling grant and the corresponding<br>
non-scheduled grant thereby taking into account whether a non-scheduled grant has<br>
been defined valid or invalid for the HARQ process to be used in the next transmission<br>
time interval, and to provide the packet data unit to the HARQ process to be used in the<br>
next transmission time interval for transmission on the uplink channel in the next<br>
transmission time interval.<br>
According to this embodiment, the mobile terminal assumes the HARQ process to be<br>
used in the next transmission time interval to be activated for the transmission of non-<br>
scheduled control data.<br>
In a variation of this embodiment of the invention, the multiplexer is adapted to multiplex<br>
non-scheduled control data pending for transmission to the packet data unit provided to<br>
the HARQ process to be used in the next transmission time interval for transmission,<br>
even if the HARQ process is deactivated for a non-scheduled grant.<br>
In another variation, the multiplexer is adapted to multiplex non-scheduled control data<br>
pending for transmission to the packet data unit provided to the HARQ process to be<br>
used in the next transmission time interval for transmission, even if a non-scheduled<br>
grant is invalid for the HARQ process.<br>
The mobile terminal according to the embodiments above may further comprise means<br>
adapted to perform the steps of method for performing a data allocation process<br>
described above.<br><br>
24<br>
A further embodiment of the invention provides a computer readable medium storing<br>
instructions that, when executed by a processor of a mobile terminal, cause the mobile<br>
terminal to perform a data allocation process for scheduled data, non-scheduled user<br>
data and non-scheduled control data obeying restrictions on the resource utilization<br>
defined by a scheduling grant and at least one non-scheduled grant.<br>
The instructions may cause the mobile terminal to perform the data allocation process by<br>
restricting a non-scheduled grant to a subset of a plurality of HARQ processes thereby<br>
activating the HARQ processes of the subset for transmitting non-scheduled user data,<br>
whereby the restriction deactivates the remaining HARQ processes of the plurality of<br>
HARQ process for transmitting non-scheduled user data and does not deactivate the<br>
remaining HARQ processes for transmitting non-scheduled control data, and by<br>
multiplexing scheduled data, non-scheduled user data and non-scheduled control data<br>
pending for uplink transmission for a next transmission time interval to a packet data unit<br>
of a transport channel for transmission on the uplink channel within the next transmission<br>
time interval using one of the plurality of HARQ processes. Thereby, the scheduled data,<br>
the non-scheduled user data and the non-scheduled control data pending for uplink<br>
transmission are multiplexed according to the scheduling grant and the corresponding<br>
non-scheduled grant thereby taking into account whether the HARQ process to be used<br>
in the next transmission time interval is active for the transmission of non-scheduled user<br>
data.<br>
Further, the instructions stored on the computer readable medium may cause the mobile<br>
terminal to provide the packet data unit for transmission on the uplink channel in the next<br>
transmission time interval to the HARQ process to be used in the next transmission time<br>
interval.<br>
In an advantageous variation of the embodiment, the computer readable medium may<br>
further store instructions that, when executed by the processor of the mobile terminal,<br>
cause the mobile terminal to multiplex the non-scheduled control data pending for<br>
transmission to the packet data unit provided to the HARQ process to be used in the next<br>
transmission time interval for transmission, even if the HARQ process has been<br>
deactivated for transmitting non-scheduled user data.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention relates to a computer readable medium storing<br>
instructions that, when executed by a processor of a mobile terminal, cause the mobile<br>
terminal to perform a data allocation process for scheduled data, non-scheduled user<br><br>
25<br>
data and non-scheduled control data obeying restrictions on the resource utilization<br>
defined by a scheduling grant and at least one non-scheduled grant.<br>
According to this embodiment the mobile terminal is caused to perform the data<br>
allocation process by defining a non-scheduled grant to be valid for a subset of a plurality<br>
of HARQ processes, wherein the HARQ processes of the subset are activated for the<br>
transmission of non-scheduled user data, while the remaining HARQ processes for<br>
which the non-scheduled grant is invalid are deactivated for the transmission of non-<br>
scheduled user data, and, for a next transmission time interval, multiplexing scheduled<br>
data, non-scheduled user data and non-scheduled control data pending for uplink<br>
transmission to a packet data unit of a transport channel for transmission on the uplink<br>
channel within the next transmission time interval using one of the plurality of HARQ<br>
processes. Thereby, the scheduled data, the non-scheduled user data and the non-<br>
scheduled control data pending for uplink transmission are multiplexed according to the<br>
scheduling grant and the corresponding non-scheduled grant thereby taking into account<br>
whether a non-scheduled grant has been defined valid or invalid for the HARQ process<br>
to be used in the next transmission time interval.<br>
Further, the instructions may cause the mobile terminal to provide the packet data unit to<br>
the HARQ process to be used in the next transmission time interval for transmission on<br>
the uplink channel in the next transmission time interval, wherein the HARQ process to<br>
be used in the next transmission time interval is always assumed to be activated for the<br>
transmission of non-scheduled control data.<br>
In another embodiment, the computer readable medium may further store instructions<br>
that, when executed by the processor of the mobile terminal, cause the mobile terminal<br>
to multiplex non-scheduled control data pending for transmission to the packet data unit<br>
provided to the HARQ process to be used in the next transmission time interval for<br>
transmission, even if the HARQ process is deactivated for a non-scheduled grant.<br>
Alternatively, the medium may also store instructions that, when executed by the<br>
processor of the mobile terminal, cause the mobile terminal to multiplex non-scheduled<br>
control data pending for transmission to the packet data unit provided to the HARQ<br>
process to be used in the next transmission time interval for transmission, even if a non-<br>
scheduled grant is invalid for the HARQ process.<br><br>
26<br>
The computer readable medium may store instructions that, when performed by the<br>
processor of the mobile terminal, cause the mobile terminal to perform the steps of the<br>
method for performing a data allocation process according to one of the various<br>
embodiments and variations thereof described above.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to the operation of a network entity in a radio<br>
access network of a mobile communication system controlling the radio resources of<br>
mobile terminals. According to this aspect, another embodiment of the invention relates<br>
to a method for transmitting control signaling from a network entity in a radio access<br>

HARQ processes of the chosen subset are to be utilized for the transmission of non-<br>
scheduled control data from the one mobile terminal to the radio access network via an<br>

HARQ processes of the subset to be activated for the transmission of non-scheduled<br>
control data to the radio access network, and may transmit the control signaling<br>
information to the one mobile terminal.<br>
Advantageously, the control signaling information may be comprised within an<br>
information element of a signaling message transmitted to the one mobile terminal<br>
setting up or reconfiguring the uplink channel.<br>
Further, the signaling information may comprise a sequence of bits, the number of bits in<br>
the sequence of bits being equivalent to the number of available HARQ processes,<br>
wherein the logical value of a respective one of the bits in the sequence indicates to the<br>
one mobile terminal whether a corresponding HARQ process is activated or deactivated<br>
for the transmission of non-scheduled control data on the uplink channel.<br>

27<br>
of the chosen subset are to be utilized for the transmission of non-scheduled control<br>
data from the one mobile terminal to the radio access network via an uplink channel.<br>
Further, the processing unit may be adapted to generate control signaling information<br>
indicating the HARQ processes of the subset to be activated for the transmission of non-<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following paragraphs will describe various embodiments of the invention. For<br>
exemplary purposes only, most of the embodiments are outlined in relation to a UMTS<br><br>
29<br>
communication system and the terminology used in the subsequent sections mainly<br>
relates to the UMTS terminology, as the invention may be advantageously used in this<br>
type of communication network. However, the used terminology and the description of<br>
the embodiments with respect to a UMTS architecture is not intended to limit the<br>
principles and ideas of the inventions to such systems.<br>
Also the detailed explanations given in the Technical Background section above are<br>
merely intended to better understand the mostly UMTS specific exemplary embodiments<br>
described in the following and should not be understood as limiting the invention to the<br>
described specific implementations of processes and functions in the mobile<br>
communication network.<br>
The ideas presented herein may also be applied to (mobile) communication systems that<br>
operate with the scheduled data/non-scheduled data paradigm and employ similar<br>
mechanism for scheduling as outlined herein. Further, the invention is also independent<br>
of the transmission time interval configured for different flows of the uplink channel.<br>
As has been indicated previously, one of the main ideas of the invention is the<br>
introduction of a new categorization of data transmitted via a dedicated uplink channel,<br>
such as an E-DCH. According to the invention, data to be transmitted on the uplink is<br>
categorized in three categories: scheduled data, non-scheduled user data and non-<br>
scheduled control data.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the scheduled data may for example be<br>
any type of payload provided from higher layer user service to the MAC layer<br>
entity/entities in a mobile terminal. As can be already derived from the terminology used,<br>
scheduled data require an explicit grant of uplink resources for transmission, a so-called<br>
scheduling grant. In an exemplary embodiment, the grant of resources may be<br>
implemented as suggested in the Technical Background section above. However, also<br>
other mechanism of dynamic resource allocation may be used that allocate resources for<br>
certain time periods, e.g. on a TTI basis or multiple-TTI basis.<br>
The non-scheduled user data may be user service data that do not require an explicit<br>
grant of resources on a transmission time interval basis. As described in the Technical<br>
Background section, the non-scheduled user data require a valid so-called non-<br>
scheduled grant that grants a given amount of bits for transmission within a transmission<br>
time interval. Further, the non-scheduled grants may be valid for individual user data<br><br>
30<br>
flows, for example individual logical channels or MAC-d flows. The non-scheduled<br>
grant(s) may be statically configured at session startup or may be reconfigurable during<br>
uplink service provision. The configuration may be signaled to the mobile terminals, for<br>
example employing a radio resource control (RRC) protocol, from a network entity in the<br>
radio access network (RAN) of a mobile communication network controlling the radio<br>
resource utilization of mobile terminals. E.g. in the UTRAN of the UMTS network this<br>
signaling function is usually provided by the serving RNC.<br>
The third category of data defined by the invention is so called non-scheduled control<br>
data. As for the non-scheduled user data, the non-scheduled control data require a valid<br>
non-scheduled grant that grants a given amount of bits for transmission within a<br>
transmission time interval. Generally, it may be possible that non-scheduled user data<br>
and non-scheduied control data "share" a non-scheduled grant (i.e. the grant is valid for<br>
both, non-scheduled user data and non-scheduled control data together) or a non-<br>
scheduled grant for non-scheduled control data may be defined separately. If a non-<br>
scheduled grant is provided for non-scheduled controi data same may be statically or<br>
dynamically configured by the mobile terminal with or without using related control<br>
signaling from the RAN.<br>
The non-scheduled control data may for example be scheduling information. In one<br>
embodiment of the invention, the scheduling information and their provision to the RAN<br>
may for example be defined and configured as described in the Technical Background<br>
section. In general, scheduling information according to the invention may denote any<br>
type of data that indicates to a scheduling Node B (base station) information that allows<br>
the Node B to schedule the mobile terminals under its control within its cell(s) so as to<br>
adhere to a maximum Rise over Thermal (RoT) caused by the mobile terminals within<br>
the cell(s).<br>
For example, if scheduling is performed on a per logical channel basis, i.e. QoS<br>
requirements associated to a logical channel are taken into account by the scheduler, the<br>
scheduling information needs to identify the respective logical channel for which the<br>
scheduling information is transmitted. Scheduling information may be transmitted by a<br>
mobile terminal for the highest priority logical channel(s) only or for all logical channels<br>
configured in the mobile terminal. As the transmission of control information contributes<br>
to the RoT within the cell, the amount of control signaling tolerable in view of the system<br>
efficiency may vary and the amount of non-scheduled controi data may be restricted to<br><br>
31<br>
reporting on individual logical channels and/or to certain events (event triggered<br>
reporting) and/or periodic reporting. The scheduling information may further comprise<br>
information that allow the scheduling Node B to determine which terminals need to be<br>
allocated more/less resources to ailow to meet QoS restrictions associated to the logical<br>
channels. For example the transmission buffer status for the highest priority logical<br>
channel or the total buffer status of the mobile terminal. Moreover, the scheduling<br>
information may also indicate power status information. Scheduling Information is not<br>
directly coupled with higher layer data. Scheduling Information may be transmitted<br>
independent, i.e. without other user or control data, or with non-scheduled user data or<br>
scheduled user data, if existing. Another possible type of non-scheduled control data<br>
according to another embodiment of the invention is the data of the framing header, as<br>
been discussed with respect to Fig. 10. Also for the framing header, which is always<br>
coupled with higher layer data, a non-scheduled grant may be assumed by the mobile<br>
terminal during E-TFC selection, i.e. in case of non-scheduled control data. Since a<br>
framing header is associated to MAC-d PDUs, the mobile terminal (e.g. UE) may assume<br>
the same configuration as for the associated MAC-d flow. In case of non-scheduled<br>
control data the mobile terminal may assume a non-scheduled grant for the transmission<br>
of the framing header and the same HARQ process allocation as configured for the<br>
associated MAC-d flow in IE "2ms non-scheduled transmission grant HARQ process<br>
allocation" during E-TFC selection. This exemplary operation according to one<br>
embodiment of the invention allows guaranteeing that the framing header is always<br>
transmitted together with the associated data handled as scheduled user data. Another<br>
possible type of non-scheduled control data is data, which is used for Layer 2 mobility. If<br>
the uplink serving cell is selected by the mobile terminal, a non-scheduled control PDU<br>
may be transmitted from mobile terminal to Node B in order to notify old and new serving<br>
cell about the serving cell selection.<br>
In addition to the new proposed categorization of uplink data, another aspect of the<br>
invention is the introduction of a new HARQ process restriction mechanism. According to<br>
the invention, a restriction of a non-scheduled grant for non-scheduled user data to a<br>
subset of HARQ processes is possible, while there is no HARQ process restriction<br>
foreseen for non-scheduled control data. The process restriction proposed by the<br>
invention may thus apply only to the transmission of non-scheduied user data but not to<br>
the transmission non-scheduled control data. As a result, the mobile terminal may<br>
multiplex non-scheduled control data to the protocol data unit (or transport block) of a<br>
transport channel for transmission using the HARQ process to be utilized in the next<br><br>
32<br>
transmission time interval as it arises, which allows avoiding undesirable delays in the<br>
transmission of the non-scheduled control data.<br>
According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a UMTS system as described in<br>
the Technical Background section is assumed. In this exemplary embodiment, the UE<br>
behavior for the E-TFC selection with respect to the handling of scheduling information<br>
may be specified as follows: If scheduling information needs to be transmitted, the E-<br>
TFC selection and data allocation process assumes that a non-scheduled grant is<br>
available and that the used HARQ process is active for its transmission. By this definition<br>
it may be guaranteed, that UE could use every HARQ process for the transmission of<br>
scheduling information.<br>
Next exemplary embodiment of the invention will be outlined referring to Fig. 12, Fig. 13<br>
and Fig. 14. Fig. 12 shows an exemplary structural overview of functional entities of a<br>
mobile terminal according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
According to this embodiment, scheduled data, non-scheduled user data and non-<br>
scheduled control data are provided to a multiplexer. The multiplexer may be a hardware<br>
implemented multiplexer or may be implemented by software instructions. Scheduled<br>
data, non-scheduled user data as shown in Fig. 12 may be considered as data flows<br>
provided from higher layers to a lower layer, as the MAC layer. Also more than one<br>
scheduled data flow, non-scheduled user data flow and/or non-scheduled control data<br>
flow may be multiplexed by the multiplexer. The data flows may be provided by buffers<br>
associated to the respective flows.<br>
For each flow the mobile terminal may have configured an individual grant. A scheduling<br>
grant indicating the maximum amount of resources a mobile terminal is allowed to utilize<br>
for transmitting scheduled data on an uplink channel within a transmission time interval<br>
for all or each of the scheduled data flow(s). Further, a non-scheduled grant indicating<br>
the maximum amount of resources a mobile terminal is allowed to utilize for transmitting<br>
non-scheduled data on the uplink channel within a transmission time interval is<br>
configured. There may be a separate non-scheduled grant for each of or all non-<br>
scheduled user data flows provided to the multiplexer. Alternatively, a non-scheduled<br>
grant may be assigned to non-scheduled user data and non-scheduled control data.<br>
Another possibility is to define a "separate" non-scheduled grant for non-scheduled<br>
control data.<br><br>
33<br>
The number of bits multiplexed to a protocol data unit to be provided to the RAN in the<br>
next transmission time interval may be statically configured in the mobile terminal or may<br>
be dynamically controlled.<br>
In an exemplary variation of the embodiment, the selection of the appropriate number of<br>
bits from the individual flows for multiplexing may depend on a HARQ process restriction<br>
according to the invention, the power offset available to the mobile terminal for<br>
transmitting the protocol data unit and the uplink resources allocated to the mobile<br>
terminal for the respective flows by the scheduling grant(s) and non-scheduled grant(s).<br>
For example, it may be assumed that the available HARQ processes 1 to N are<br>
subsequently utilized as has been illustrated in Fig. 9 and as is indicated in Fig. 13.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 13 showing an exemplary flow chart of steps performed by a<br>
mobile terminal having for example structural entities as shown in Fig. 12, the multiplexer<br>
may be provided with or may determine 1301 an ID of the HARQ process to be<br>
employed in the next transmission time interval in order to determine whether a process<br>
restriction has been configured for this next HARQ process.<br>
Upon having obtained the HARQ process ID, this information is used in step 1302 to<br>
determine from which of the flows input to the multiplexer of Fig. 12 data will be<br>
transmitted in the next transmission time interval. Obviously, if no data is pending for<br>
transmission for a particular flow, no data from the respective flow is multiplexed to the<br>
protocol data unit. Further, if the HARQ process identified by the obtained ID is restricted<br>
for non-scheduled user data transmission, no data are transmitted from the restricted<br>
flow(s) in the next transmission time interval utilizing the restricted HARQ process. It is<br>
important to recognize that the restriction of HARQ processes only applies to non-<br>
scheduled user data, while the transmission of non-scheduled control data, such as<br>
scheduling information, cannot be restricted to individual HARQ processes in this<br>
embodiment of the invention,<br>
Upon having determined from which of the different scheduled and non-scheduled data<br>
flows information is to be transmitted, the mobile terminal may proceed with selecting<br>
1303 an appropriate transport format combination, for example modulation and coding<br>
scheme, spreading code, etc. for the data that may be transmitted within the scheduling<br>
grant(s) and non-scheduled grant(s) configured. In an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
invention, this selection is performed according to similar rules as the E-TFC selection<br>
function discussed previously. If there are non-scheduled control data pending for<br><br>
34<br>
transmission, the mobile terminal may for example always assume the presence of an<br>
associated non-scheduled grant granting sufficient resources on the uplink for the<br>
transmission of the non-scheduled control data. If a non-scheduled grant is configured<br>
for the transmission of non-scheduled data, this grant may be always configured<br>
sufficiently large to allow for the transmission of the non-scheduled control data in each<br>
of the HARQ processes.<br>
The selected transport format combination also determines the amount of bits that may<br>
be transmitted in the next transmission time interval from the individual data flows. Based<br>
on this knowledge, the multiplexer of Fig. 12 may thus proceed and multiplex 14304 the<br>
appropriate number of bits from the scheduled and non-scheduled flows to a protocol<br>
data unit for transmission. This process may also be referred to as a data allocation<br>
process, as by multiplexing certain amounts of bits the available uplink resources are<br>
allocated to the individual scheduled and non-scheduled data flows. Again, it is important<br>
to recognize that in case non-scheduled control data is pending for transmission, same<br>
will be multiplexed to the protocol data unit to be transmitted in the next transmission<br>
time interval, independent of any HARQ process restrictions.<br>
Upon having formed the protocol data unit, which may for example have a configuration<br>
as shown in Fig. 11, same is passed to the HARQ processes to be utilized in the next<br>
transmission time interval for transmission 1305 using the selected transmission format<br>
combination.<br>
Fig. 14shows an exemplary flow chart of the operation of a mobile terminal according to<br>
a further embodiment of the invention. Essentially, the operation of the mobile terminal<br>
as outlined with respect to Fig. 12 and Fig. 13 is shown in the time domain. In Fig. 14 it is<br>
assumed for exemplary purposes that the mobile terminal (UE) is operated in a UMTS<br>
network and data is to be transmitted via an E-DCH, In the figure, the arrow from the<br>
RAN to the mobile terminal (UE) intends to illustrate that the scheduling grant is<br>
configured by the Node B controlling the respective cell of the mobile terminal, whereas<br>
non-scheduling grant(s) may optionally be configured by a network entity of the radio<br>
access network controlling the utilization of uplink resources, e.g. the S-RNC, by<br>
signaling. For an UMTS network, this signaling between UE and S-RNC may be part of<br>
the RRC protocol.<br>
Further, the network entity of the radio access network controlling the utilization of uplink<br>
resources may restrict some of the HARQ processes that are utilized for data<br><br>
35<br>
transmission on an uplink channel in that a subset of the HARQ processes may not be<br>
used for the transmission of non-scheduled user data. Optionally, a corresponding<br>
restriction may be configured for the transmission of scheduled data. For example, the<br>
process restriction may be indicated to the mobile terminal (UE) within an information<br>
element of a signaling message as wili be outlined further down below in more detail.<br>
According to the illustrative embodiment shown in Fig. 14, the mobile terminal performs<br>
an E-TFC selection process every TTI. This E-TFC selection process may be considered<br>
a "conventional" TFC selection process, which adopts the new categorization of uplink<br>
data in scheduled data, non-scheduled user data and non-scheduled control data and<br>
the modifications to the HARQ process restriction mechanism and data allocation<br>
process performed using the multiplexer suggested in the different embodiments above.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention deals with the handling of framing headers. In<br>
addition to higher-layer data, e.g. RLC PDUs, the new proposed E-TFC selection<br>
function may optionally also account for the MAC-e control information, like the MAC-e<br>
framing headers. Since the frame headers are associated to higher layer data, it may be<br>
assumed that there is always a valid grant available.<br>
There are two possibilities proposed how to account for the framing headers: Either the<br>
header will be counted as part of the grant itself or the header shouldn't be counted as<br>
part of the grant. For the case of non-scheduled control data the header could be<br>
included in the maximum number of bits configured for the corresponding MAC-d flow.<br>
On the other hand it might be difficult to account for the header in the grant itself. Bearing<br>
in mind, that the framing header overhead is rather small, the header could be also<br>
accounted for separately during E-TFC selection (including the data allocation<br>
procedure). In this case the mobile terminal may assume a non-scheduled grant for the<br>
framing header.<br>
For scheduled data the framing header could be either counted as part of the scheduling<br>
grant or the mobile terminal may assume a non-scheduled grant for the header during E-<br>
TFC selection. Considering that it's feasible to account for the header in the scheduling<br>
grant itself, which would also lead to a more accurate matching of the allocated<br>
resources, which seems advantageous.<br>
An alternative to the introduction of a new HARQ process restriction mechanism outlined<br>
above, may be a new configuration by the UTRAN. As for example described in section<br><br>
36<br>
10.3.6.99 of 3GPP TS 25.331, "Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol Specifications<br>
(Release 6)", V.6.6.0, incorporated herein by reference, the provision of scheduling<br>
information may be configured as part of the Physical Channel configuration (IE E-<br>
DPDCH Info). In this UMTS related example, UTRAN sends a RADIO BEARER SETUP<br>
message to the UE during radio bearer establishment. This message inter alia includes<br>
the configuration of transport channels and/or physical channels (like E-DCH and E-<br>
DPDCH respectively). Also during the RRC connection setup procedure, UTRAN may<br>
provide physical channel parameters like the Information Element IE "E-DPDCH INFO"<br>
to the UE, in order to setup the E-DCH connection.<br>
To adapt the system described in section 10.3.6.99 of 3GPP TS 25.331 to the ideas of<br>
the invention a HARQ process restriction for the transmission of non-scheduled control<br>
data is introduced. In case the non-scheduled control data represents scheduling<br>
information, the HARQ process restriction for the transmission of non-scheduled control<br>
data may be achieved by the introduction of a new IE entry (information element), which<br>
defines the HARQ process allocation for scheduling information. This IE may contain a<br>
bit string, each bit representing one of the available HARQ process. Depending on the<br>
logical value of the individual bits the corresponding HARQ process is activated or<br>
deactivated for the transmission of scheduling information. In order to guarantee that all<br>
HARQ processes are active for the transmission of scheduling information the IE is set to<br>
11111111 (assuming the availability of 8 HARQ processes). It may also be possible to<br>
explicitly activate/deactivate specific HARQ processes for the transmission of non-<br>
scheduled control information, however. In the latter case a tradeoff between a tolerable<br>
delay to the transmission of non-scheduled control data has to be determined and the<br>
use of HARQ processes for non-scheduled control data transmission has to be restricted<br>
accordingly.<br>
