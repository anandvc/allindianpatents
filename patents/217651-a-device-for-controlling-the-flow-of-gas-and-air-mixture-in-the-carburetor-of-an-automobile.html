				<td>The present invention relates to a device for controlling the flow of gas and air mixture in the carburetor of an automobile. The object of the present invention is to overcome the problems related to conventional carburetors which are not conditioned to use gas as fuel.<br>
Carburetors as known in the prior art use petrol/diesel as fuel and have been worked upon so as to improve efficiency in terms of the consumption of fuel. Petrol or diesel are the main fuel sources used for automobiles. Petrol and diesel being non renewable sources of energy should not be wasted and it is desired that these sources<br><br>
be used judiciously in the most appropriate manner possible. Gas has been considered as an alternative to petrol and diesel for the fuel sources. However, there have been inherent problems related to mixing of gas and air in the carburetor. Mixing of gas and air in the proportionate desired amount and in the desired manner only would yield the desired optimum result and efficiency of the engine.<br>
The present invention aims to provide a device for controlling the flow of gas and air mixture in the double barrel carburetor of an automobile. In an internal combustion engine the best method of introducing gas is through spudding. In this method a spud tube is introduced just above the butterfly valve, tangentically to the air flow, and at an area of low pressure in the venturi of the carburetor. Thus when the air passes through the venturi the low pressure so created allows the gas from the vapouriser regulator to be sucked in and gets inducted into the engine. The device of the present invention is placed at the mouth of the carburetor.<br>
: It is not always possible to find a place to introduce a spud tube in the carburetor more so in the double barrel type of carburetor at present in use in many automobiles in India: Therefore in order to give the gas in the same fashion as a spud tube would, the device is provided with two channels, one for each barrel of the carburetor, which end up at the ideally suited place above the butterfly valve. By<br>
suitably sealing the two passages two spuds are formed thereby achieving the same<br>
result as that achieved by using spud tube.<br>
Device of the present invention is gas air mixing plate comprising three plates made of metal, i.e., top plate, bottom plate and a core plate sandwiched in between the top and the bottom plate. The metal here is preferably aluminum. The three plates, i.e., top plate, bottom plate and the core plates are adhesively joined to each other with a high temperature grade adhesive to form an air tight compartment. The top plate of the device of the present invention comprises two venturi s facilitating flow of air as well as two holes of appropriate diameter for attaching the gas inlet nozzles. The core plate of the device of the present invention also comprises two Venturis for the passage of air and two holes for attaching gas inlet nozzles. The bottom plate is also<br>
provided with two venturi's.<br>
The pair of venturi's are provided with protrusions supported by a pair of angular supports. These supports are aligned at an angle of 30-50 , preferably at an angle of 45° . The protrusion is provided in the plate to enable flow of the air as well as gas inside the carburetor in one direction only and to not allow the air and gas to revert back. This protrusion restricts the flow of gas as well as the back pressure.<br>
The placement of venturi's and the holes for the gas inlet nozzle is done in a manner to ensure that the gas and air introduced through the plate reaches the desired destination flowing through the desired passage created in the said sandwiched plate.<br>
The holes for connecting the gas inlet nozzle are provided in the top plate and the core plate from where the gas introduced passes through the various channels of<br>
the core plate and  reaches the  appropriate venturi and from there flows in the said carburetor.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a device for controlling the flow of gas and air mixture in the carburetor of an automobile comprising:<br>
a top plate, a bottom plate and a core plate made of a metal are adhesively joined to<br>
each other to form an air tight compartment;<br>
said core plate being sandwiched between the said top plate and said bottom plate<br>
having inlet channels for flow of gas;<br>
a pair of Venturis provided on the said device for allowing the flow of air;<br>
a pair of holes provided on the top plate for connecting the gas inlet nozzles<br>
facilitating the inlet of gas through the said channels wherein the said pair of Venturis<br>
have a pair of protrusion supported by a pair of angular supports to restrict the flow of<br>
gas and back pressure.<br>
Device of the present invention can be understood in a better manner with reference to the accompanying drawings. These drawings do not in any manner restrict the broad scope of the present invention and are merely illustrating the device of the present invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows the top plate having two venturi s A and B as well as two holes of appropriate diameter for connecting the gas inlet nozzles.<br>
Figure 2 is a view of the core plate depicting the passage of gas from the venturi's to the gas inlet nipple.<br>
Figure 3 shows the lower plate.<br>
Figure 4 shows the fully assembled device of the present invention.<br>
Figure 5 shows the gas inlet nozzles and the three plates made of metal, i.e., top plate, bottom plate and core plate.<br>
The present invention relates to an improved device for controlling the flow of gas and air mixture in a carburetor of an automobile as shown in figure 4. This improved device is a gas air mixer plate (1). The gas air mixer plate comprises of three plates, i.e., top plate (2), core plate (3) and bottom plate (4) adhesively joined to each other. Each plate has two venturi's (A) and (B) which are the two separate openings for introducing air-into the plate. The gas is introduced through gas inlet nozzles (C and D). As can be seen from figure 2 where core plate is depicted, there are provided two venturi's each having protrusions at an angle of 30-50 . These<br>
venturi's are connected to the holes (C and D) which are attached to the gas inlet nozzles. Figure 2 also specifies the predetermined path for the flow of the gas.<br>
The gas inlet nozzles help introduce gas through the plate. The core plate and the top plate are provided with holes of appropriate diameter for attaching the gas inlet nozzles. For optimum mixing of air and gas the holes are placed at an appropriate predetermined distance.<br>
Further the protrusions (X and X') are provided in the device of the present invention. These protrusions help in flow of air and gas in one direction only. <br>
As the streamlined flow is directly proportional to the thickness of the material of the plate, it is therefore desirable to select top plate, core plate and bottom plate of appropriate thickness. When the air reaches venturi A or B, pressure decreases at the bottom end and therefore air is sucked in. From the other end, gas is introduced through the gas inlet nozzle and due to low pressure at the bottom end, the gas is sucked in. The protruding part of the venturi acts as a regulator for the gas air mixture and allows the gas and air to flow only in one direction. The device of the present invention therefore achieves delivery of air and gas in the same fashion as the spud tube would.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
