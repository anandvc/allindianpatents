and then isomerizing these compounds, for example as described under route a).<br>
Compounds of the formula I in which R2o, R23, R26 and R30 are different from hydroxyl or halogen can be prepared by converesion methods which are generally known from the literature, for example acyclations or carbamoylations with appropriate acyl chlorides, from compounds in which R20, R23, R26 or R30is hydroxyl in the presence of a suitable base, or they can be prepared by nucleophilic substitution reactions on chlorides of the formula I in which R20, R23, R26 or R30 is halogen, which are likewise obtainable by known processes by reaction with a chlorinating agent, such as phosgene, thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride. Here, for example, suitably substituted amines, or hydroxylamines directly, or<br><br>
alkylsulfonamides, mercaptans, thiophenols, phenols, ArrNH2 or ArySH, are employed in the presence of a base, for example 5-ethyl-2-methylpyridine, tiiisopropylethylamine, triethylamine, sodium bicarbonate, sodium acetate or potassium carbonate.<br>
Compounds of the formula I in which R20, R23, R26 or R30 comprise thio groups can be oxidized analogously to known standard processes, for example using peracids, for example meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) or peracetic acid, to give the corresponding sulfones and sulfoxides of the formula I. Here, the degree of oxidation at the sulfur atom (SO- or S02-) can be controlled by the amount of oxidizing agent.<br>
The process according to the invention for preparing compounds of the formula I in which R and m are as defined under formula I and Q is a group<br><br>

R23)R26 and R30 are hydroxyl, in accordance with reaction scheme 1, route a), the carboxylic acid derivatives of the formula II in which X is a leaving group, for example halogen, for example iodine, bromine and in particular chlorine, N-oxyphthalimide or N,0-<br>
dimethylhydroxylamino or part of an activated ester, for example <br>
(formed from dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and the corresponding carboxylic acid) or<br><br>
C2H5N   c   NH(CH2)3N(CH3)2  (formed from N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide<br>
(EDC) and the corresponding carboxylic acid) are employed. These compounds are reacted in an inert organic solvent, for example a halogenated hydrocarbon, for example dichloromethane, a nitrile, for example acetonitrile, or an aromatic hydrocarbon, for example toluene, and in the presence of a base, for example an alkylamine, for example triethylamine, an aromatic amine, for example pyridine or 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), with the dione derivatives of the formula III, IV, V or VI to give the isomeric enol ethers of the formulae VII, VIII, IX and X. This esterification is carried out at temperatures of from 0°C to 110°C.<br>
The isomerization of the ester derivatives of the formulae VII, VIII, IX and X to the dione derivatives of the formula I (in which R2o, R23. R26 and R30 are hydroxyl) can be carried out, for example, analogously to EP 369 803 in the presence of a base, for example an alkylamine, for example triethylamine, a carbonate, for example potassium carbonate, and a catalytic amount of DMAP or a cyanide source, for example acetone cyanohydrin or potassium cyanide.<br>
According to reaction scheme 1, route b), the desired diones of the formula I (in which R20, R23, R26 and R30 are hydroxyl) can be obtained, for example, in analogy to Chem. Lett. 1975, 1045 by esterifying the carboxylic acids of the formula XI with the dione derivatives of the formula III, IV, V or VI in an inert solvent, for example a halogenated hydrocarbon, for example dichloromethane, a nitrile, for example acetonitrile, or an aromatic hydrocarbon, for example toluene, in the presence of a base, for example an alkylamine, for example triethylamine, and a coupling agent, for example 2-chloro-1-methylpyridinium iodide. Depending on the solvent used, this esterification is carried out at temperatures of from 0°C to 110°C, affording initially, as described under route a), the isomeric ester of the formula I which can be isomerized as described under route a), for example in the presence of a base and a catalytic amount of DMAP, or a cyanide source, to give the desired dione derivative of the formula I (R20, R231 R26 and R30 are hydroxyl).      '•<br>
The preparation of the compounds of the formula I in which Q is the group Q5 can be carried out in accordance with reaction scheme 2 by reacting the (3-diketone derivative of<br><br>
the formula XII, for example in analogy to Synthesis 1991, 301; ibid. 1988, 793; or Tetrahedron.32, 3055 (1976) with carbon disulfide in the presence of a base, for example a carbonate, for example potassium carbonate, a metal hydride, for example sodium hydride, or potassium fluoride on aluminium, and an alkylating agent of the formula XIII in which *Xi is a leaving group, for example halogen, for example iodine, bromine and in particular<br><br>
carried out in the presence of a solvent, for example an amide, for example N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), a sulfoxide, for example dimethylsuifoxide (DMSO), or a nitrile, for example acetonitrile. The ketene thioacetal of the formula XIV which is formed is cyclized with the aid of hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the presence of a base, for example sodium acetate, in a solvent, for example an alcohol, for example ethanol, or an ether, for example tetrahydrofuran, to give the compound of the formula le in which Z is sulfur. This cyclization reaction is carried out at temperatures of from 0°C to 100°C. If appropriate, compounds of the formulae le and If (Z is sulfur) can be oxidized analogously to known standard processes, for example with peracids, for example meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) or peracetic acid, to give the corresponding sulfones and sulfoxides of the formulae le and If (Z = SO- or S02-). Here, the degree of oxidation at the sulfur atom (Z = SO- or S02-) can be controlled by the amount of oxidizing agent.<br>
Oxidations to the compounds of the formulae le and If (Z is SO- or S02-) are carried out as described, for example, in H.O. House, "Modern Synthetic Reactions" W. A. Benjamin, Inc., Menlo Park, California, 1972, pages 334-335 and 353-354.<br>
The activated carboxylic acid derivatives of the formula II in reaction scheme 1 (route a) in which X is a leaving group, for example halogen, for example bromine, iodine or in particular chlorine, can be prepared by known standard processes, as described, for example, in C. Ferri "Reaktionen der organischen Synthese" [Reactions of Organic Synthesis], Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, 1978, page 461 ff. Tt)is is shown in reaction scheme 3 below.<br><br><br>
According to reaction scheme 3, the compounds of the formula II (X=leaving group) or II (X=halogen) are prepared, for example, by employing a halogenating agent, for example a thionyl halide, for example thionyl chloride or thionyl bromide; a phosphorus halide or phosphorus oxyhalide, for example phosphorus pentachloride or phosphorus oxychloride or phosphorus pentabromide or phosphoryl bromide; or an oxalyl halide, for example oxalyl chloride, or by employing a reagent for the formation of activated esters, for example N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) of the formula X. For the compound of the formula X used as halogenating agents, X is a leaving group, for example halogen, for example fluorine, bromine or iodine and in particular chlorine, and W, is, for example, PCI2, SOCI, SOBr or CICOCO. The reaction is carried out in the presence or absence of an inert organic solvent, for example in aliphatic, halogenated aliphatic, aromatic or halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, for example n-hexane, benzene, toluene, xylenes, dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane or chlorobenzene, at reaction temperatures in the range of from -20°C to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture, preferably at 40-150°C, and in the presence of a catalytic amount of N,N-dimethylformamide. Such reactions are generally known and described in the literature in various variations with respect to the leaving group X.<br>
The compounds of the formulae III, IV, V and VI are known and can be prepared analogously to the methods described, for example, in WO 92/07337, DE-A-3818958, EP-A-0 338 992 and DE-A-3902818.<br>
The compounds of the formula XII in reaction scheme 2 can be obtained by standard processes, for example from the corresponding compounds of the formula II<br><br><br>
in which R and m are as defined above and X is a leaving group, for example halogen, for example via Claisen condensation, or from the compounds of the formula II by reaction with a ketocarboxylic acid salt of the formula XV<br><br>
in which R36 is as defined under formula I and M+ is an alkali metal ion (cf., for example, WO 96/26192).<br>
The compounds of the formulae II and XI are known and can be prepared analogously to the methods described, for example, in WO 97/46530, EP-A-0 353 187, Heterocycles, 48, 779 (1998), Heterocycles, 46, 129 (1997), or Tetrahedron Letters, 1749 (1998).<br>
For preparing all other compounds of the formula I functionalized according to the definition of (R)m, there is a large number of known standard processes available, for example alkylation, halogenation, acylation, amidation, oximation, oxidation and reduction, and the choice of the suitable preparation processes depends on the properties (reactivities) of the substituents in the intermediates in question.<br>
All further compounds originating from the scope of the formula I can be prepared in a simple manner, taking into account the chemical properties of the pyridyl or Q moiety.<br>
The end products of the formula I can be isolated in a customary manner by concentration or evaporation of the solvent and be purified by recrystallization or trituration of the solid residue in solvents in which they are only sparingly soluble, such as ethers, aromatic<br><br>
hydrocarbons or chlorinated hydrocarbons, by distillation or by means of column chromatography and a suitable mobile phase.<br>
Furthermore, it is known to the person skilled in the art in which order certain reactions have to be carried out advantageously to avoid possible side reactions. Unless a targeted synthesis is carried out for isolating pure isomers, the product may be obtained as a mixture of two or more isomers. The isomers can be separated by methods known per se.<br>
Compounds of the formula I in which p is 1, i.e. the corresponding N-oxides of the formula I, can be prepared by reacting a compound of the formula I in which p is 0 with a suitable oxidizing agent, for example with the H202 urea adduct, in the presence of an acid anhydride, for example trifluoroacetic anhydride.

B.; Reddy, K. R.; Olson, P. E.; J Org Chem 1973, 38, 927) or in the presence of an acid anhydride (see, for example, Konno, K.; Hashimoto, K.; Shirahama, H.; Matsumoto, T.; Heterocycles 1986, 24, 2169), followed, if appropriate, by subsequent conversion.<br>

Their precursors of the formulae XXXIIIa, XXXIIIb, XXXIIIc, XXXIIId, XXXIIIe, XXXIIIf, XXXIIIg and XXXIIIh are likewise accessible by conversion processes known to the person skilled in the art (reaction scheme 7). 2-Trifluoromethyl-3-ethoxycarbonyl-2-pyridone (formula XXXIIIa in which R is hydrogen, R1X is ethyl and Rf is trifluoromethyl) in particular is known from Org. Process Research &amp; Development, 1, 370 (1997).<br><br><br>
Intermediates of the formulae XXXIIIa to XXXIIIh can be obtained by reacting, for example for preparing a 6-halo derivative of the formula XXXIIId, a pyridone of the formula XXXIIIa (preparation according to Org. Process Research &amp; Development, 1, 370 (1997) or scheme 8) with a halogenating agent, for example phosphorus oxychloride, phosphorus oxybromide or phenyl dichlorophosphate, in the presence or absence of added base, such as a dialkylaniiine, in the presence or absence of solvent, if desired in a pressure vessel, at temperatures between 0 and 220°C (preferably 60-200°C). It is known to the person skilled in the art how to convert chloro derivatives by nucleophilic substitution, for exarnple using an alkali metal iodide in an inert solvent into the corresponding iodides, or using gaseous<br><br>
hydrobromic acid in lower carboxylic acids, for example cone, acetic acid, into the corresponding bromo derivatives (for example according to US-A-?,974,166) or using alkali metai fluoride in a dipolar solvent, such as sulfolane, into the corresponding fluoro derivatives.<br>
The compound of the formula XXXIIIe can be prepared by reacting a halo derivative of the formula XXXIIId obtained as described above with an alcohol of the formula R151-OH in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydride, or an alkali metal oxide or carbonate, or directly with an alkali metal alkoxide, in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide or in an excess of the alcohol of the formula R151-OH which corresponds to the group to be introduced, at temperatures between -5 and 160°C, or by reacting, to prepare a corresponding 6-thioether of the formula XXXIIIe, analogously to what was described above, either the halide of the formula XXXIIId with a thiol of the formula R151-SH in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride or with an alkali metal salt of a thiol in an inert solvent at -10-150°C, or by preparing, starting from a pyridone XXXIIIa and using a thionating agent, for example Lawesson's reagent, in an inert solvent, such as toluene or acetonitrile, a pyrithione of the formula XXXIIIb and alkylating this with an alkylating agent Rl51-X, where X is a leaving group, such as halide (CI, Br, I) or ROS03- or RS02-, at 20-120°C in an inert solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, to give the thioether of the formula XXXIIIe, or, to prepare the corresponding sulfinyl or sulfonyl derivative of the formula XXXIIIf, reacting with an oxidizing agent, such as m-chloroperbenzoic acid or sodium periodate, or sodium perborate, under temperature control known to the person skilled in the art, depending on the degree of oxidation (for example -30°C -+50CC for m0i =1 or -20°C - +100°C for m0i=2) in an inert solvent, such as dichioromethane, to give XXXIIIf, or, to prepare 6-alkyl derivatives XXXIIIg according to the invention, reacting a sulfone of the formula XXXIIIf (m0i =2) or a halo derivative of the formula XXXIIId in the presence or absence of a Pd(0) catalyst such as Pd(PPh3)2CI2 with a tetra-d-Cealkyltin or with a Grignard reagent CrC6alkyl-MgHal at temperatures between -10° and 180°C, for example analogously to Synlett 1998 (1185), or as described in Organocopper Reagents, R.J.K.Taylor, Oxford University Press 1994, or in Transition Metals in Organic Synthesis, S. Gibson, Oxford Univ. Press,1997, or in Org. React. 50, 1 (Stille reaction), or, to prepare 6-cyano derivatives of the formula XXXIIIh, reacting a halide of the formula XXXIIId or a sulfone of the formula XXXIIIf (m0i=2) with an alkali metal or tetraalkylammonium cyanide or<br><br>
copper cyanide in an inert solvent, such as dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide, at temperatures between 0°C and 220°C. -<br>
Some of the compounds of the formula XXXIIIe are also obtainable from the pyridone of the formula XXXIIIa by reacting them analogously to Org. React. 42, 2 with an alcohol R151OH in the presence of an azodicarboxylic ester (for example diethyl ester) and triphenylphosphine in an inert solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane.

The compounds of the formula I or compositions comprising them can be used according to the invention in all.the,application methods customary in agriculture, for example pre-emergence application, postemeTgence application and seed dressing, and various methods and techniques, for example controlled release of active compounds. To this end, the active compound is absorbed in solution onto mineral granule carriers or polymerized granules (urea/formaldehyde) and dried. If appropriate, a coating which allows the active compound to be released in metered form over a certain period of time can additionally be applied (coated granules).<br>
The compounds of the formula I can be employed as herbicides in unchanged form, i.e. as they are obtained in the synthesis, but they are preferably processed in a customary manner with the auxiliaries conventionally used in the art of formulation, for example to give emulsifiable concentrates, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granules or microcapsules. Such formulations are described, for example, in WO 97/34485 on pages 9 to 13. The methods of application, such as spraying, atomizing, dusting, wetting, scattering or watering, in the same way as the nature of the compositions, are chosen according to the aims striven for and the given circumstances.<br>
The formulations, i.e. the compositions, formulations or preparations comprising the active compound of the formula I or at least one active compound of the formula I and as a rule one or more soJid or liquid formulation auxiliaries, are prepared in a known manner, for example by intimate mixing and/or grinding of the active compounds with the formulation auxiliaries, for example solvents or solid carriers. Surface-active compounds (surfactants) can furthermore additionally be used during the preparation of the formulations. Examples of solvents and solid carriers are given, for example, in WO 97/34485 on page 6. Depending on the nature of the active compound of the formula I to be formulated, suitable surface-active compounds are nonionic, cationic and/or anionic surfactants and surfactant mixtures having good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties.<br>
Examples of suitable anionic, nonionic and cationic surfactants are listed, for example, in WO 97/34485 on pages 7 and 8.<br><br>
The surfactants conventionally used in the art of formulation and which are suitable to .prepare the herbicidal compositions according to the invention-are described, inter alia, in "Mc Cutcheon's Detergents and Emulsifiere Annual", MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood New Jersey, 1981, Stache, H., "Tensid-Taschenbuch" [Surfactant handbook], Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich/Vienna, 1981 and M. and J. Ash, "Encyclopedia of Surfactants", Vol l-lll, Chemical Publishing Co., New York, 1980-81.<br>
The herbicidal formulations as a rule comprise 0.1 to 99% by weight, in particular 0.1 to 95% by weight, of herbicide, 1 to 99.9% by weight, in particular 5 to 99.8% by weight, of a solid or liquid formulation auxiliary and 0 to 25% by weight, in particular 0.1 to 25% by weight, of a surfactant. While concentrated compositions are rather preferred as commercial goods, the end user as a rule uses dilute compositions. The compositions can also comprise further additives, such as stabilizers, for example epoxidized or non-epoxidized vegetable oils (epoxidized coconut oil, rapeseed oil or soya oil), defoamers, for example silicone oil, preservatives, viscosity regulators, binders, tackifiers and fertilizers or other active compounds.<br>
The active compounds of the formula I are as a rule applied to the plants or their habitat, at application rates of 0.001 to 4 kg/ha, in particular 0.005 to 2 kg/ha. The dosage required for the desired effect can be determined by tests. It depends on the nature of the effect, the development stage of the crop plant and the weed and on the application (location, time, process) and can, as a function of these parameters, vary within wide ranges.<br>
The compounds of the formula I have herbicidal and growth-inhibiting properties, owing to which they can be used in crops of useful plants, in particular in cereals, cotton, soya, sugar beet, sugar cane, plantings, rapeseed, maize and rice, and for the non-selective control of weeds. Crops include those which have been rendered tolerant towards herbicides or<br>
»<br>
herbicide classes by conventional breeding methods or genetical engineering methods. The weeds to be controlled can be both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds, for example Stellaria, Nasturtium, Agrostis, Digitaria, Avena, Setaria,<sinapis lolium solanum echinochloa scirpus monochoria sagittaria bromus alopecurus sorghum halepense rottboellia cyperus abutilon sida xanthium amaranthus chenopodium ipomoea chrysanthemum galium viola and veronica.></sinapis><br>

Example H1: Preparation of 2-difluoromethoxv-6-trifluoromethvlnicotinic acid:<br>
At 70°C, 25 g (0.106 mol) of (3-(ethoxycarbonyl)-6-trifluoromethyl)pyrid-2-one (Helv. Chim. Acta (1988), 71(3), 596-601) in a mixture of 50 ml of dimethylformamide and 20 ml of water are treated, in the presence of 16 g (0.116 mol) of finely powdered potassium carbonate and with efficient stirring, with a continuous stream of gaseous Freon-22. After 6 hours, a further 16 g of potassium carbonate and 20 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide are added, and the mixture is stirred with continuous introduction of Freon-22 gas at a temperature of 100°C for another 4 hours. The mixture is then treated with water and ice and extracted with diethyl ether. The aqueous phase is adjusted to pH 2 using cone. HCI and extracted with ethyl acetate. Diethyl ether is added to the extract, and some (3-(carboxy)-6-trifiuoromethyl)pyrid-2-one crystals which have precipitated out are removed by filtration. The filtrate is filtered through a silica gel column (mobile phase ethyl acetate/hexane 1:1) giving, as a crystalline product, pure 2-difluoromethoxy-6-trifluoromethylnicotinic acid: 1H NMR (CDCI3, ppm): 8.60, d, J=9 Hz, 1H; 7.62, d, J=9 Hz , 1H; 7.62, t, J=67 Hz, 1H.<br>

Acta (1988), 71(3), 596-601) are heated in a pressure vessel at a temperature of 170°C for 3 hours. The cold reaction solution is filtered directly through a short silica gel column (mobile phase: ethyl acetate/hexane 1:9), giving, as an oily product, ethyl 2-chloro-4-methyl-6-trifluoromethyl-pyridin-3-ylcarboxylate:<br>

The reaction mixture is then filtered through Celite and, after addition of sodium chloride solution, extracted with ethyl acetate. Chromatographic purification (mobile phase 1:9) gives the 4-methyl-6-trifluoromethylpyridin-3-yl ethyl ester as an oil: 1H NMR (CDCI3, ppm): 9.11, s, 1H; 7.56, s, 1H, 4.44, q, 2H; 2.72,<br><br>

Res.&amp; Devel. 1,370 (1997)) and 34 g of manganese dioxide in 250 ml of 1,2-dichlorobenzene are heated under reflux for 24 hours. In intervals of about 20 hours, manganese dioxide (total amount of Mn02 used: 213 g) is added six more times over a period of 3 days, and the mixture is in each case heated further under reflux. The mixture is then cooled, diluted with ethyl acetate, and filtered through silica gel, the filtercake is washed with ethyl ester and the filtrate is concentrated. The solid residue (26.7 g, i.e. 80%), which may still contain about 6% of starting material, is directly reacted further. For complete purification, it is possible to purify, for example, over silica gel (hexane/ethyl acetate 7:3) (1H NMR, CDCI3, ppm): 8.02 (d, 1H); 6.85 (d, 1H); 4.86 (q, 2H); 1.37 (t, 1H).<br>

Extraction-with ethyl acetate gives, after acidification to pH 2.7, 4-methyl-6-trifluoromethylnicotinic acid as a crystalline product: 1H NMR (CDCI3, ppm): 7.49, s, 1H; 4.48, q, 2H; 2.43, s, 3H, 1.43, t, 3H; 9.32, s, 1H, 7.62, s, 1H, 2.79, s, 3H.<br>

9.6 g (0.047 mol) of methyl 4-trifluoromethylpyridin-3-ylcarboxylate, dissolved in 50 ml of dichloromethane, are treated with 30% hydrogen peroxide/urea adduct and 17 ml of trifluoroacetic anhydride. The reaction solution is stirred at temperature of 20°C for 20' hours and then washed once each with dilute sodium hydroxide solution and half-saturated sodium chloride solution. The product obtained is 3-methoxycarbonyl-4-trifluoromethyl-3-pyridine N-oxide; 1H NMR (CDCI3, ppm): 8.55, s, 1H; 8.31, d, 1H; 7.6, d, 1H; 3.98, s, 3H. 4.85 g (0.022 mol) of the above product are then added to a mixture of 5 ml of phosphorus oxychloride and 4.3 ml of ethyldiisopropylamine in 15 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane, and the mixture is heated to a temperature of 60°C. After about 2 hours, another 2 ml of phosphorus oxychloride and 2.8 ml of ethyldiisopropylamine are added, and the mixture is stirred at this temperature for 20 hours. The reaction mixture is subsequently added to ice-water, adjusted to pH 3 using 30% NaOH and then extracted with dichloromethane. Filtration through a little silica gel gives an approximately 5:1 product mixture of the two 6-chloro- and 2-chloro-4-trifluoromethylpyridin-3-yl methyl esters, which can be separated by HPLC into the pure components. Thus, pure methyl 6-chloro-4-trifluoromethylpyridin-3-ylcarboxylate is obtained as the main product; 1H NMR (CDCI3, ppm): 8.91, s, 1H; 7.68, s, 1H; 3.98, s, 3H, and pure methyl 2-chloro-4-trifluoromethylpyridin-3-ylcarboxylate is obtained as the byproduct; 'H NMR (CDCI3, ppm): 8.64, d, 1H; 7.52, d, 1H; 4.01, s, 3H.

After the reaction has ended (approximately 3 hours), the reaction mixture is added to ice-water and extracted with ethyl acetate.
