Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a crop processor and a crop processing method for removing crops remaining on an upper side and a lower side of a joint where metal plates are shear-bonded to each other. Moreover, the present invention relates to a continuous rolling facility and a continuous rolling method, which are capable of bonding a preceding metal plate to a following metal plate while the metal plates are advancing, and include a crop processor for removing crops remaining on an upper side and a lower side of a joint where the metal plates are shear-bonded to each other.<br>
Background Art<br>
A continuous rolling facility for a metal plate is configured to obtain a metal plate having a predetermined thickness by use of a roughing roller and a finishing roller. One of already developed measures for the continuous rolling facility is to bond metal bars between a roughing roller and a finishing roller and thereby to allow execution of finish rolling continuously. In order to execute finish rolling continuously, it is necessary to bond metal bars at a high speed, and various techniques have been proposed in this regard.<br>
As the technique for bonding metal bars at a high speed, there have been known techniques for superposing a trailing end of a preceding metal bar and a leading end of a following metal bar on each other, for shearing both of the metal bars at the same time, and for bonding their newly-formed surfaces to each other by bringing them into direct contact in a shearing process (see Patent Document 1, Patent Document 2, and Patent Document 3, for example).<br>
These techniques are favorable methods for continuous rolling facilities since they employ shear-bonding to enable bonding simply and in a short time period.<br>

Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
First, an overall configuration of a continuous rolling facility will be described based on Fig. 1. Fig. 1 shows an overall configuration of a continuous rolling facility including a crop processor according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The continuous rolling facility of this embodiment includes a roughing roller (a roughing mill) 1, a coil box 2, a bonding apparatus 3, a finishing roller (a finishing mill) 4 formed of multiple stages of rollers, and a down coiler 5 arranged from an upstream side.<br>
A metal plate (a following metal bar) 6 rolled by the roughing mill 1 is wound around a coiler of the coil box 2 and a difference in advancing speeds between the roughing mill 1 and the finishing mill 4 is adjusted. The following metal bar 6 unwound from the coiler of the coil box 2 is subject to cutting of a leading end by a crop shear 7 as needed, and is then superposed on a trailing end (the end is cut by the crop shear 7 as needed) of a preceding metal bar 9 by a superposing device 8 of the bonding apparatus 3.<br>
The leading end of the following metal bar 6 is bonded to the trailing end of the preceding metal bar 9 by a bonding, device 10 of the bonding apparatus 3, and crops at the joint are cut off by a crop processor 12. A metal bar 11 bonded by the bonding apparatus 3 and rendered continuous is sent to the finishing mill 4.<br>
-10-<br><br>
The bonding apparatus 3 is configured to bond the trailing end of the preceding metal bar 9 to the leading end of the following metal bar 6 while the metal bars are advancing, and therefore constitutes a short-time bonding apparatus capable of bonding in a short time period. Moreover, in order to perform bonding during the advance, a configuration to allow the bonding device to move so as to follow the advance of the metal bars or a configuration to allow the bonding device to swing so as to follow the advance of the metal bars are applicable.<br>
Although details will be described later, the bonding device 10 of the bonding apparatus 3 has a bonding mechanism including a pair of shear blades configured to sandwich a superposed portion of the trailing end of the preceding metal bar 9 and the leading end of the following metal bar 6 and to perform bonding while compressing and shearing that portion from both sides, for example.<br>
The metal bar 11 sent to the finishing mill 4 is sequentially subjected to hot rolling by the multiple stages of rollers and is rolled into a predetermined plate thickness. The metal bar 11 rolled into the predetermined plate thickness is wound around the down coiler 5.<br>
Concerning reference symbols in the drawing, 13 denotes a leveler provided at an exit side of the coil box 2,14 denotes a lever provided at an exit side of the bonding apparatus 3, 15 denotes a crop shear provided at an entrance side of the finishing mill 4,16 denotes an edge heater disposed between the lever 14 and the crop shear 15, and 17 denotes a bar heater disposed at a downstream side of the edge heater 16.<br>
Note that layouts of the levelers 13 and 14, the crop shear 15, the edge heater 16, and the bar heater 17 are determined by appropriate selection depending on conditions and other factors of the continuous rolling facility. The layout positions, the presence or absence of these constituents, and the like are not limited only to the illustrated example.<br>
-11-<br><br>
Here, the crop shear 7 for cutting off the trailing end of the preceding metal bar 9 and the leading end of the following metal bar 6 is necessary in the case of striking the metals bars for bonding. However, the crop shear 7 is not always necessary in the case of bonding in a shearing process while superposing the metal bars and can therefore be omitted.<br>
An example of the bonding device 10 of the bonding apparatus 3 will be concretely described based on Fig. 2 to Fig. 6. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 show a schematic configuration of the bonding device 10, in which Fig. 2 shows a condition to start bonding and Fig. 3 shows a condition in the course of bonding. Fig. 4 shows the metal plate in the state of completion of bonding. Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 show a blade driving mechanism in the bonding device 10.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, a leading end 22 of the following metal bar 6 is superposed on a trailing end 21 of the preceding metal bar 9, and a portion where the trailing end 21 and the leading end 22 are superposed is sandwiched by an upper blade 26 having a protrusion 25 and a lower blade 28 having a protrusion 27. That is, the protrusions 25 and 27 are in contact with one of the surfaces of the trailing end 21 and the leading end 22.<br>
Meanwhile, an upper clamp 31 and a lower clamp 32 are in contact with the region where the leading end 22 of the following metal bar 6 and the trailing end 21 of the preceding metal bar 9 are superposed. The upper clamp 31 is supported by a certain hydraulic force using an upper supporter 33 and the lower clamp 32 is supported by a certain hydraulic force using a lower supporter 34.<br>
The upper blade 26, the upper clamp 31, and the upper supporter 33 are integrally formed as an upper blade assembly 35. Meanwhile, the lower blade 27, the lower clamp 32, and the lower supporter 34 are integrally formed as a lower blade assembly 36.<br>
-12-<br><br>
The upper blade assembly 35 and the lower blade assembly 36 are guided to a post portion of a housing 37 and are supported so as to move in a thickness direction of the preceding metal bar 9 and the following metal bar 6. The upper blade assembly 35 and the lower blade assembly 36 are rendered capable of approaching and receding from each other by use of link mechanisms to be described later, so that the upper blade assembly 35 and the lower blade assembly 36 approach and recede from each other while sandwiching the preceding metal bar 9 and the following metal bar 6. An approaching action takes place in the process of bonding while a receding action takes place after bonding.<br>
Here, it is also possible to render only one of the upper blade 26 and the lower blade 28 movable.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, in the process of shearing the preceding metal bar 9 and the following metal bar 9 with the upper blade 26 and the lower blade 28, the preceding metal bar 9 and the following metal bar 6 are bonded together by plastic flow deformation on both of shear surfaces, thereby forming the integrated and continuous metal bar 11.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, in a position of completion of a bonding operation, an upper crop 38 which is the leading end portion of the following metal bar 6 and a lower crop 39 which is the trailing end portion of the preceding metal bar 9 remain in mutually deviated positions above and below a bonded region of the continuous metal bar. Thereafter, the upper blade 26 and the lower blade 28 are retracted so that the upper and lower blades recede from each other until the space therebetween becomes a certain amount.<br>
The upper crop 38 and the lower crop 39 remaining in mutually deviated position on an upper side and a lower side at the time of bonding are removed by the crop processor 12 (see Fig. 1) and the continuous metal bar 11 is sent to the finishing mill 4.    Details of the crop processor 12 will be described later.<br>
-13-<br><br>
Bonding of the preceding metal bar 9 and the following metal bar 6 using the bonding device 10 is executed synchronously with the advance of the metal bars. For this reason, synchronous movements of the bonding device 10 and approaching and receding movements of the upper blade 26 and the lower blade 28 are executed by use of a blade driving mechanism shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. That is, the upper blade 26 and the lower blade 28 are configured to move in accordance with a movement locus of the joint between the preceding metal bar 9 and the following metal bar 6.<br>
The blade driving mechanism will be described based on Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. Fig. 5 shows a state before starting bonding and Fig. 6 shows a state at the time of completion of bonding.<br>
The upper blade 26 and the lower blade 28 move from the positions before starting bonding to the positions at the completion of bonding and the return to the positions before starting bonding. At this time, the metal bars 6 and 9 to be bonded are advancing to a down stream direction (directions of arrows in Figs. 5 and 6) at a line speed. Accordingly, the upper blade 26 and the lower blade 28 move along an upper blade locus and a lower blade locus shown in dotted lines synchronously with this advance.<br>
A main crank shaft 41 includes two eccentric shafts relative to a center A. An upper eccentric shaft 42 is connected to the upper blade 26 through a link 43 while a lower eccentric shaft 44 is connected to the lower blade 28 through a link 45. The upper blade 26 and the lower blade 28 are vertically moved (either pressed down or retracted) in response to an angle of rotation of the main crank shaft 41.<br>
Meanwhile, a synchronizing shaft 46 which is engaged with the main crank shaft 41 to establish a synchronous relation is provided, and the synchronizing shaft 46 is linked with the link 43 of the upper eccentric shaft 42 and with the link 45 of the lower eccentric shaft 44 through a swing lever 47.<br>

Through the link with the synchronizing shaft 46, the upper blade 26 and the lower blade 28 are moved in an advancing direction of the metal bars 6 and 9 substantially at the same speed with the advance of the metal bars 6 and 9 while the upper blade 26 and the lower blade 28 are in contact with the metal bars, and the upper blade 26 and the lower blade 28 are retracted to the original positions when the upper blade 26 and the lower blade 28 are detached from the metal bars.<br>
In the above-described bonding apparatus 3, the upper blade 26 and the lower blade 28 are moved in a vertical direction in accordance with the movement locus of the joint between the preceding metal bar 9 and the following metal bar 6. For example a distance required from the start of bonding to completion of bonding is set approximately equal to or below 1 m.<br>
The continuous rolling facility shown in Fig. 1 describes the example of the facility provided with the coil box 2. In the case of a continuous rolling facility without the coil box 2, the bonding apparatus 3 is configured to execute bonding after a trailing end of the following metal bar 6 is ejected from the roughing mill 1 or before a leading end of the preceding metal bar 9 is caught by the finishing mill 4.<br>
That is, the continuous rolling facility is set to roll only any one of the preceding metal bar 9 and the following metal bar 6 when the bonding apparatus 3 bonds the metal bars 9 and 6.<br>
In the above-described bonding apparatus 3, the preceding metal bar 9 and the following metal bar 6 are bonded together by compressing the blades from both sides in the thickness direction of the metal bars 6 and 9 and thereby subjecting the shear surfaces to plastic flow deformation in the shearing process. Accordingly, it is possible to bond the metal bars at a high bonding strength and in a short time period.<br>
Here, as for the bonding apparatus, it is also possible to apply a running shear device 54 configured to provide a running housing 51 with a fixed blade 52 and a<br>
-15-<br><br>
vertically moving blade 53 as shown in Fig. 7 as long as the device is capable of bonding in a short time period. It is also possible to move the running housing 51 synchronously with the advance of the metal bars and to bond the preceding metal bar 9 and the following metal bar 6 by moving down the vertically moving blade 53 to perform shearing with the fixed blade 52 during the advance.<br>
In this case, a distance for bonding (a distance from a start of bonding to an end of bonding) becomes, for example, approximately equal to 10 m. However, it is possible to achieve shear-bonding with an extremely simple device configuration.<br>
Fig. 8 is views showing a crop connected state at a joint of metal bars, in which Fig. 8(a) shows a state of an outcome of bonding while placing the leading end of the following metal bar 6 on the trailing end of the preceding metal bar 9, and Fig. 8(b) shows a state of an outcome of bonding while placing the trailing end of the preceding metal bar 9 on the leading end of the following metal bar 6. After bonding, there are crop connected portions 80 (portions where the crops 38 and 39 are partially connected to the bonded metal bar 11).<br>
Arrows in solid line show a case of splitting the crops 38 and 39 by tapping shear surfaces 38a and 39a of the crops 38 and 39, and arrows in broken lines show a case of splitting the crops by tapping or peeling off from opposite sides 38b and 39b of the shear surfaces (end surfaces of the metal bars).<br>
Fig. 9 is views showing a state after splitting the crops, in which Fig. 9(a) shows split ends 81 in the case of splitting the crops 38 and 39 by tapping from the directions of the arrows in the solid lines in Fig. 8, and Fig. 9(b) shows split ends 82 in the case of splitting the crops 38 and 39 by tapping or peeling off from the directions of the arrows in the broken lines in Fig. 8.<br>
When the crops 38 and 39 are split from the directions of the arrows in the broken lines in Figs, 8(a) and 8(b), burrs 83 as on the split ends 82 are generated after splitting as shown in Fig. 9(b).    When the burrs 83 are generated, notches 84 remain<br>
-16-<br><br>
in the vicinity of the split ends 82 at the joint, which constitute a factor to reduce strength of the joint. Moreover, the burrs may be folded back and attached to the surfaces of the metal plate 11 along with the subsequent rolling process, thereby leading to reduction in a base material thickness in the thickness direction of the metal plate 11 and reduction in the strength.<br>
In contrast, when the crops 38. and 39 are split from the directions of the arrows in the solid lines, the split ends 81 becomes so continuous after splitting as to have no burrs 83 or notches 84 as described above. This neither causes reduction in the strength of the joint, nor causes reduction in the strength during the rolling process.<br>
As described above, splitting the crop connected portions 80 by tapping the shear surfaces 38a and 39a of the crops 38 and 39 from the directions of the arrows in the solid lines in Fig. 8 makes it possible to curb an adverse affect of the crop splitting on the joint.<br>
Next, the crop processor 12 will be described based on Fig. 10 and Fig. 11. Fig. 10 shows a conceptual configuration of a crop processor according to a first embodiment of the present invention and Fig. 11 shows a conceptual configuration of a crop processor according to a second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The crop processor according to the first embodiment will be described based on Fig. 10.<br>
As shown in the drawing, crop removers 71 and 72 serving as crop removing means are respectively provided so as to face the shear surface 38a of the upper crop 38 and the shear surface 39a of the lower crop 39 remaining on the upper side and the lower side of the joint while sandwiching the metal bar 11.<br>
The crop remover 71 on the lower side includes a tapping blade 74 serving as tapping means which is disposed in a position opposed to the shear surface 39a of the lower crop 39 on the trailing end side of the preceding metal bar 9.    The tapping<br>
-17-<br><br>
blade 74 is set to wait for the lower crop 39 along with the advance of the metal bar 11 and is configured to remove the lower crop 39 from the shear surface 39a side by tapping the shear surface 39a of the lower crop 39 by the tapping blade 74.<br>
The crop remover 72 on the upper side includes a tapping blade 75 serving as tapping means which is disposed in a position opposed to the shear surface 38a of the upper crop 38 on the following metal bar 6. The tapping blade 75 is set to chase the upper crop 38 along with the advance of the metal bar 11 and is rotated by driving means such as a cylinder 76 at a higher speed than the advancing speed of the metal bar 11. The upper crop 38 is removed from the shear surface 38a side by tapping the shear surface 38a of the upper crop 38 by the tapping blade 75 driven by the cylinder 76 or the like. Instead of the cylinder 76, it is also possible to rotate the tapping blade 75 by a motor and the like.<br>
The crop processor of the first embodiment shown in Fig. 10 is configured to remove the lower crop 39 on the trailing end side of the preceding metal bar 9 by tapping the -shear surface 39a with the tapping blade 74 and to remove the upper crop 38 of the following metal bar 6 by tapping the shear surface 38a with the tapping blade 75. Accordingly, the upper side and the lower side of the joint are formed into the split ends 81 and the burrs on the split ends 82 harmful for the joint are therefore eliminated.<br>
The split upper crop 38 is received by a scraper 77 and is moved to a crop tray 78 by turning the scraper 77 upward as indicated with an arrow in the drawing. Although it is not illustrated, the upper crop 38 can be discharged offline by inclining the crop tray 78, for example.<br>
The crop processor according to the second embodiment will be described based on Fig. 11.<br>
As shown in Fig. 11, crop removers 61 and 62 are respectively provided to be located on a front side of the upper crop 38 and the shear surface 39a of the lower crop 39<br>
-18-<br><br>
remaining on the upper side and the lower side of the joint while sandwiching the metal bar 11..<br>
The crop remover 61 on the lower side includes a tapping blade 64 serving as tapping means which is disposed in a position opposed to the shear surface 39a of the lower crop 39 on the trailing end side of the preceding metal bar 9. The tapping blade 64 is set to wait for the lower crop 39 along with the advance of the metal bar 11 and is configured to remove the lower crop 39 from the shear surface 39a side by tapping the shear surface 39a of the lower crop 39 by the tapping blade 64.<br>
The crop remover 62 on the upper side includes a scraper 65 serving as peeling means which is disposed in a position opposed to leading end surface 38b of the upper crop 38 of the following metal bar 6. A tip end of the scraper 65 is fitted into a lower end of the leading end surface 38b of the upper crop 38 along with the advance of the metal bar 11 and removes the upper crop 38 from the leading end surface 38b side by peeling the upper crop 38 off the surface of the metal bar 11. . The removed upper crop 38 is guided by an upper surface of the scraper 65 and by a discharge guiding member 66 and is discharged to a predetermined discharge site.<br>
A chamfer 67 is formed on the lower end (the superposed surface side) of the leading end surface 38b of the upper crop 38, so that the tip end of the scraper 65 can be easily fitted thereto.<br>
The crop processor of the second embodiment shown in Fig. 11 is configured to remove the shear surface 39a of the lower crop 39 on the trailing end side of the preceding.metal bar 9 by the tapping blade 64 and to remove the upper crop 38 of the of the following metal bar 6 from the leading end surface 38b side by the scraper 65. Accordingly, it is possible to remove the lower crop 39 and the upper crop 38 so as to wait for the metal bar 11 on the front side in the advancing direction.<br>
For this reason, it is possible to allow the tapping blade 64 to reach the lower crop 39, and to fit the scraper 65 into the upper crop 38 reliably, and thereby to remove the<br>
-19-<br><br>
lower crop 39 and the upper crop 38 reliably. Moreover, the upper side of the joint is formed into the split end 82 (see Fig. 9(b)) while the lower side of the joint is formed into the split end 81 (see Fig. 9(a)). Accordingly, it is possible to limit the burr of the split end 82 harmful for the joint only to one place.<br>
The chamfer 67 shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 is automatically formed when part of the following metal bar 6 is cut with the crop shear 7 in Fig. 1. Concerning a generation mechanism of this chamfer, "Improvement of cutting performance of a drum type crop shear", Mitsubishi Heavy Industry Technical Report Vol. 21 No. 6 (1984), Fig. 3, Fig. 4, etc. reporting about generation of a chamfer by cutting with a drum shear, serve as a reference. Note that the crop shear is not limited only to the drum type crop shear.    The crop shear only needs to be able to form the chamfer 67.<br>
Moreover, by bending upward the leading end portion (the portion to be superposed) of the following metal bar 6, it is possible to facilitate fitting of the scraper 65 into the space between the upper crop 38 and the preceding metal bar 9 without providing the chamfer 67 in particular. Moreover, it is also possible to facilitate scooping of the upper crop 38 by the scraper 77.<br>
In addition thereto, as for means for facilitating fitting of the scraper 65 into the space between the upper crop 38 and the preceding metal bar 9 or facilitating scooping of the upper crop 38 by the scraper 77, it is also conceivable to form the trailing end (which becomes the leading end at the time of unwinding) of the following metal bar 6 at the time of winding around the coil box 22 so as to be warped upward at the time of unwinding. Alternatively, it is also possible to make arrangement by leaving predetermined warpage by controlling the leveler 13 disposed in front of the bonding apparatus 3.<br>
According to the crop processor and the crop processing method described above, it is possible to properly remove the upper crop 38 and the lower crop 39 remaining on the upper side and the lower side of the joint. Moreover, according to the continuous  rolling facility  including the  above-described crop  processor, it is<br>
-20-<br><br>
possible to establish the continuous rolling facility and the continuous rolling method which are capable of properly removing the upper crop 38 and the lower crop 39 remaining on the upper side and the lower side of the joint.<br>
Although the tapping means configured to tap the crop from the shear surface side has been cited as the crop removing means herein, the present invention is not limited to this configuration. It is also possible to split the crop in the form of the split end 81 instead of the split end 82 by cutting the crop connected portion from the shear surface of the crop with a cutter or the like. What is important is that the crop removing means only needs to have an ability to separate the crop from the metal plate by applying force to the crop.<br>
