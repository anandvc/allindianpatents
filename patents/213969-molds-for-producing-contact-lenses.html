This invention describes molds that are useful in the production of<br>
contact lenses and methods for their use.<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Pat. App. Ser. No.<br>
10/395,755, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Pat. App. Ser. No.<br>
10/222,373.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Contact lenses have been used commercially to improve vision since the<br>
1950s. The first contact lenses were made of hard materials. Although these<br>
lenses are currently used, they are not suitable for all patients due to their poor<br>
initial comfort and their relatively low permeability to oxygen. Later<br>
developments in the field gave rise to soft contact lenses, based upon<br>
hydrogels, which are extremely popular today. These lenses have higher<br>
oxygen permeability and are often more comfortable to wear than contact<br>
lenses made of hard materials. Unlike hard lenses that are manufactured by<br>
lathing hard pieces of plastic, malleable soft contact lenses are often<br>
manufactured by forming the lens using a two part mold where each half has<br>
topography consistent with the desired final lens. Examples of such molds and<br>
their methods of production may be found in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,565,348,<br>
4,640,489,4,495,313, JP 08025378, and JP 0726644 which are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
These two part molds contain a male member whose convex surface<br>
corresponds to the back curve of a finished lens and a female member whose<br>
concave surface corresponds to the front curve of a finished lens. To prepare<br>
lenses using these molds, an uncured lens formulation is placed between the<br>
concave and convex surfaces of the mold halves and subsequently cured. The<br>
cured lens and the mold are subsequently treated with a liquid medium in order<br>
to release the cured lens from the surface of the mold. Although this is a<br>
process is straightforward, there are a number requirements that must be<br>
satisfied in order to produce a useable lens. First the material from which the<br>
mold is made must have properties that are chemically compatible with the<br>
uncured lens formulation. Second, the mold material must be able to withstand<br>
the curing conditions and be compatible with such conditions. For example,<br>
lenses may be cured by either or both heat and light. If a lens is cured by<br>
transmitting light to the uncured polymer, it is important that the lens mold<br>
permit the transmission of light at the appropriate wavelength. Third, the mold<br>
material must not stick to the cured lens to a degree that prevents release of<br>
the cured lens. Often the lenses are produced in a manufacturing environment<br>
where it is important for the lenses to removably adhere to the same said of the<br>
lens mold upon separation in a repeatable and predictable fashion. Therefore,<br>
the selection of appropriate materials to make the molds continues to be a<br>
subject of concern to those who produce soft contact lenses.<br>
Others have used materials such as polypropylene, polystryene,<br>
polyethylene, polymethyl methacrylates, and modified polyolefins containing an<br>
alicyclic moiety in the main chain to prepare two part lens molds. Although<br>
these materials are useful, with discovery of different lens formulations,<br>
particularly silicone hydrogel lens formulations, other useful mold materials are<br>
needed.<br>
Further, new developments in the field have led to contact lenses made<br>
from hydrogels and silicone hydrogels that are coated with polymers to improve<br>
the comfort of the lenses. Often lenses are coated by treating the cured lenses<br>
with a polymer. Recently polymer coated lenses have been produced by<br>
coating the surfaces of a two part mold with a polymer, adding an uncured<br>
formulation to the coated lens mold, curing the lens, and subsequently<br>
releasing the cured lens from the mold where the surface of said cured lens is<br>
coated with the polymer that was originally adhered to the surface of the mold.<br>
This process is described in further detail in U.S. Patent Application No.<br>
09/921,192, filed on August 8, 2001 and entitled "Method for Correcting Articles<br>
by Mold Transfer," which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
When using this method of coating a lens, the choice of mold material is even<br>
more critical than when one is producing an uncoated lens.<br>
Therefore, there remains an unmet need to produce lens molds that may<br>
be used to produce many different types of soft contact lenses. It is this need<br>
that the following invention fills.<br>

well as all other patent disclosed in this application are hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in their entirety.<br>
As used herein, the term "alicyclic monomers" refers to polymerizable<br>
compounds having at least one saturated carbocyclic ring therein. The<br>
saturated carbocyclic rings may be substituted with one or more members of<br>
the group consisting of hydrogen, C1-10alkyl, halogen, hydroxyl,<br>
C1-10 alkoxycarbonyl, C1-10alkoxy, cyano, amido, imido, silyl, and substituted<br>
C1-10alkyl where the substituents are selected from one or more members of<br>
the group consisting of halogen, hydroxyl, C1-10alkoxycarbonyl, C1-10alkoxy,<br>
cyano, amido, imido, and silyl. Examples of alicyclic monomers include but are<br>
not limited to polymerizable cyclobutanes, cyclopentanes, cyclohexanes,<br>
cycloheptanes, cyclooctanes, biscyclcbutanes, biscyclopentanes,<br>
biscyclohexanes, biscycloheptanes, biscyclooctanes, and norbornanes. It is<br>
preferred that the at least two alicyclic monomers be polymerized by ring<br>
opening metathesis followed by hydrogenation. Since co-polymers are costly,<br>
it is preferable that the molds made from these co-polymers may be used<br>
several times to prepare lenses instead of once which is typical. For the<br>
preferred molds of the invention, they may be used more than once to produce<br>
lenses.<br>
More particularly, examples of alicyclic monomer containing saturated<br>
carbocyclic rings include but are not limited to the following structures<br>
wherein R1-6 are independently selected from one or more members of<br>
the group consisting of hydrogen, C1-10alkyl, halogen, hydroxyl,<br>
C1-10alkoxycarbonyl, C1-10alkoxy, cyano, amido, imido, silyl, and substituted<br>
C1-10alkyl where the substituents selected from one or more members of the<br>
group consisting of halogen, hydroxyl, C1-10aJkoxycarbonyl, C1-10a!koxy, cyano,<br>
amido, imido and silyl. Further two or more of R1-6 may be taken together to<br>
form an unsaturated bond, a carbocyclic ring, a carbocyclic ring containing one<br>
or more unsaturated bonds, or an aromatic ring. The preferred R1-6 is selected<br>
from the group consisting of C1-10alkyl and substituted C1-10alkyl where the<br>
substituents are selected from the group consisting of halogen, hydroxyl,<br>
C1-10alkoxycarbonyl, C1-10alkoxy, cyano, amido, imido and sifyl.<br>
The alicyclic co-polymers consist of at least two different alicyclic<br>
monomers. The preferred alicyclic co-polymers contain two or three different<br>
alicyclic monomers, selected from the group consisting of<br><br>
Typically the surface energy of the alicyclic co-polymer is between 30<br>
and 45 dynes/cm at 25 °C. The more particularly preferred alicyclic co-polymer<br>
contains two different alicyclic monomers and is sold by Zeon Chemicals L.P.<br>
under the tradename ZEONOR. There are several different grades of<br><br>
ZEONOR, having of glass transition temperatures form 105-160°C. The<br>
particularly preferred ZEONOR, is ZEONOR 1060R, which according the to the<br>
manufacturer, ZEON Chemicals L.P. has an melt flow rate ("MFR") range of<br>
11.0 grams/10 minutes to 18.0 grams/10 minutes (as tested JISK 6719<br>
(230°C))F a specific gravity (H2O =1) of 1.01 and a glass transition temperature<br>
of 105°C.<br>
As used here, the term "mold" refers to a rigid object that may be used to<br>
form lenses from uncured formulations. The preferred molds are two part<br>
molds as described above, where either the front curve or the back curve of the<br>
mold is made of the alicyclic co-polymers of the invention and the other curve is<br>
made of polypropylene. Examples of polypropylene include but are not limited<br>
to metallocene catalyzed polypropylene that is nucleated and darified, such as<br>
but not limited to Achieve 1615 from Exxon and ATOFINA EOD 00-11. The<br>
preferred method of making the molds of the invention is by injection molding<br>
using known techniques, but the molds could be made by other techniques<br>
lathing, diamond turning, or laser cutting.<br>
Typically lenses are formed on at least one surface of both mold parts.<br>
However, if need be one surface of the fenses may be formed from a moid and<br>
the other surface could be formed using a lathing method, or other methods.<br>
Aside from the alicyclic co-polymers, the molds of the invention may<br>
contain additives that facilitate the separation of the lens forming surfaces,<br>
reduce the adhesion of the cured lens to the molding surface, or both. For<br>
example additives such as metal or ammonium salts of stearic acid, amide<br>
waxes, polyethylene or polypropylene waxes, organic phosphate esters,<br>
glycerol esters or alcohol esters may be added to alicyclic co-polymers prior to<br>
curing said polymers to form a mold. Examples of such additives include but<br>
are not limited to Dow Siloxane MB50-321 (a silicone dispersion), Nurcrel 535<br>

E43-Wax, methyl cellulose, cocamide (anti-blocking agent Registry No. 61789-<br>
19-3), poly vinyl pyrrolidinone (360,000 MW) and the additives disclosed in U.S.<br>
Pat No. 5,690,865 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
The preferred additives are polyvinyl pyrrolidinone, zinc stearate and glycerol<br>
mono stearate, where a weight percentage of additives based upon the total<br>
weight of the polymers is about 0.05 to about 10.0 weight percent, preferably<br>
about 0.05 to about 3.0, most preferably about 2.0 weight percent.<br>
In addition to additives, the separation of the lens forming surfaces may<br>
be facilitated by applying surfactants to the lens forming surfaces. Examples of<br>
suitable surfactants include Tween surfactants, particularly Tween 80 as<br>
described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,314 which is hereby incorporated by reference<br>

invention may contain other polymers such as polypropylene, polyethylene,<br>
polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate, and modified polyolefins containing an<br>
alicyclic moiety in the main chain. For example, a blend of the alicyclic co-<br>
polymers and polypropylene (metallocene catalyst process with nucleation,<br>
where ATOFINA EOD 00-11) may be used, where the ratio by weight<br>
percentage of alicyclic co-polymer to polypropylene ranges from about 99:1, to<br>
about 20:80 respectively. This blend can be used on either or both mold<br>
halves, where it is preferred that this blend is used on the back curve and the<br>
front curve consists of the alicyclic co-polymers.<br>
Further this invention includes a method of making a lens comprising,<br>
consisting essentially of, or consisting of 1) dispensing an uncured lens<br>
formulation onto a mold surface comprising, consisting essentially of, or<br>

comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of at least two alicyclic<br>
monomers of different chemical structures, and 2) curing said lens formulation<br>
under suitable conditions. The terms lenses, alicyclic monomers, and molds<br>
have their aforementioned meaning and preferred ranges.<br>
As used herein, the term "uncured" refers to the physical state of a lens<br>
formulation prior to final curing to form a lens. Some lens formulations contain<br>
mixtures of monomers which are cured only once. Other lens formulations<br>
contain monomers, partially cured monomers, macromers and other<br>
components. F:or examples of such partially cured formulations are disclosed<br>
in U.S. Pat. Nos. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,419,858; 6,308,314; and 6,416,690. This<br>
invention will be useful these formulations among others.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "curing under suitable conditions" refers to<br>
any of the known methods of curing lens formulations, such as using light, heat,<br>
and the appropriate catalysts to produce a cured lens. Examples of such<br>
curing conditions may be found in the soft lens formulation references listed<br>
herein.<br>
Still further, the invention includes a lens produced by a method<br>
comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of 1) dispensing an uncured<br>
lens formulation onto a surface of a mold comprising, consisting essentially of,<br>
or consisting of, an alicyclic co-polymer wherein said alicyclic co-polymer<br>
comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of at least two alicyclic<br>
monomers of different chemical structures and 2) curing said lens formulation<br>
under suitable conditions. The terms lens, alicyclic monomers, uncured, and<br>
molds have their aforementioned meaning and preferred ranges.<br>

essentially of, or consisting of, an alicyclic co-polymer and at least one lens<br>
forming surface<br>
wherein said alicyclic co-polymer comprises, consists essentially of, or<br>
consists of at least two alicyclic monomers of different chemical<br>
structures, and<br>
wherein said at least one lens forming surface comprises, consists<br>
essentially of, or consists of a coating effective amount of a high<br>
molecular weight coating composition.<br>

aforementioned meaning and preferred ranges.<br>
As used herein "lens forming surface" means the surface that is used to<br>
mold the lens. Such surface has an optical quality surface finish, meaning that<br>
it is sufficiently smooth so that a lens surface formed by the polymerization of a<br>
lens forming material in contact with the molding surface Is optically acceptable.<br>
Further said surface has a geometry that is necessary to impart to the lens<br>
surface the desired optical characteristics, including without limitation, spherical<br>
aspherical and cylinder power, wave front aberration correction, cornea!<br>
topography correction and the like as well as combinations thereof.<br>

with a light scattering detector and a high sensitivity refractive index detector,<br>
for example model PL-RI available from Polymer Labs. The GPC is performed<br>
using a phenogel 5 nm linear column equipped with a guard column of the<br>
same components and a solution of 0.5 weight percent lithium bromide in<br>
dimethyl formamide as the eluent. Flow rates are 0.5 mL per minute with<br>
injection volumes from about 10 to about 20 µL. The precise MW used will<br>
depend upon the coating selected and the monomer mixture used. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the MW of the coating is greater than about 300 kD.<br>

straight chain alcohols, polyethoxylated polyoxypropylene glycols,<br>
polyethoxylated polydimethylsiloxane copolymers, fluorinated alkane ethoxyiate<br>
copolymers, and long chain carboxylic acid esters, zwitterionic surfactants,<br>
such as pH-sensitive and pH insensitive surfactants, and the like, and<br>
combinations thereof. The specific type and amount of surfactants used will<br>
depend upon the other components of the coating composition and the molding<br>
surface used. Typically, greater than or equal to about 0.001 weight percent<br>
and less than or equal to about 5 weight percent based on the total weight of<br>
the coating composition will be used.<br>
The coating composition may be applied to the molding surface by any<br>
suitable method including, but not limited to, compression, swabbing, spray<br>
coating, ink jet printing, aerosolization, nebulization, dip coating, spin coating,<br>
and the like and combinations thereof. Preferably, spin coating is used. Also,<br>
preferably, the coating is dried, or rendered non-tacky, prior to its use for<br>
forming lenses. Drying may be carried out using any suitable method, but<br>
preferably is carried out at temperatures up to about the glass transition<br>
temperature (Tg") of the mold material in air or under vacuum followed by<br>
equilibration under a blanket of nitrogen at any temperature up to about the Tg<br>
of the mold material. During the vacuum exposure process, cold traps or other<br>
filters preferably are used to prevent contamination of the mold.<br>
In a spin coating method, the coating composition preferably has a lower<br>
surface tension than that of the molding surface"s surface energy. More<br>
preferably, the surface tension of the coating composition is greater than about<br>
3 dynes/cm below that of the surface energy of the molding surface to which it<br>
is applied when measured at the coating application temperature. Most<br>
preferably, the surface tension of the coating composition is more than 8<br>
dynes/cm below that of the surface energy of the molding surface.<br>
In a preferred spin coating method for use in forming contact lenses,<br>
spin coating is used to deposit a coating of a dry thickness of about 5 to about<br>
70 nm onto a molding surface of a mold. If the surface tension of the coating<br>
differs from the surface energy of the mold by greater than about 8 dynes/cm<br>
when measured at the coating application temperature, a suitable spin profile of<br>
at least about 6,000 and no more than about 8,000 RPM using at least about 2<br>
and no more than about 20 µl of coating composition and spinning for at least<br>
about 3 sec. If the surface tension difference is less than about 8 dynes/cm,<br>
the mold is spun up to at least about 3,000 and no more than about 5,000 RPM<br>
using at least about 2 and no more than about 10 µl of coating composition and<br>
then the mold is spun up to at least about 7,000 and more than about 10,000<br>
RPM for at least about 3 seconds prior to stopping.<br>
Any excess coating accumulating at the mold edges must be removed<br>
and removal may be carried out by any convenient method including, without<br>
limitation, swabbing the excess, removing the excess using vacuum, solvent,<br>
washing or pressurized air jet. Preferably, the excess is removed using an air<br>
jet. in using the air-jet, it is critical that spinning is started prior to the jet being<br>
turned on and, preferably, the air jet pressure is equal to or greater than about<br>
3 psi.<br>
The term "coating effective amount" refers to the thickness and the<br>
roughness of the coating composition on the lens forming surface. For hydrated<br>
contact lenses, preferably a peak-to-peak surface roughness of the hydrated<br>
lens is less than about 500 nm is preferable. Thus, by coating effective amount<br>
is meant an amount of the coating composition sufficient to provide a dry film<br>
thickness of the coating composition on the lens forming surface that will result<br>
in a hydrated article with an acceptable surface roughness and for contact<br>
lenses preferably a hydrated lens peak-to-peak surface roughness of less than<br>
about 500 nm. More preferably, the amount of coating composition used is an<br>
amount sufficient to produce a dry film thickness of at least about 5 nm and no<br>
more than about 70 nm, preferably at least about 5 nm and no more than about<br>
50 nm, more preferably at least about 20 nm and no more than about 40 nm.<br>
Still more preferably said coating effective amount covers the entire or<br>
substantially the entire lens forming surface.<br>
Coating additives may be added to the high molecular weight coating<br>
compositions of the invention. Coating additives may include but are not<br>
limited to tints, pigments, and antimicrobial compositions. Examples of<br>
antimicrobial compositions that may be used in this manner are disclosed in the<br>
following U.S. Patents and applications which are hereby incorporated by<br>

Example 1<br>
Preparation of Molds with Alicyclic Co-Polymers<br>
Pellets of the alicyclic co-polymer ZEONOR® 1060R were placed in a<br>
de-humidifying dryer at 90°C for approximately one to four (1-4) hours. The<br>
material was subsequently heated and purged through an injection molding<br>
machine using the techniques generally described in Injection Molding<br>
Handbook, edited by Dominick &amp;. Donaid Rosato, Published by Man Nosirand<br>
Reinhold Company, 1986. Approximately three (3) pounds of material was<br>
purged and molded within 10-15 minutes to give front curves and back curves<br>
for lenses having a power of -1 00 D. Normal usable lens molds were<br>
recovered and used to make lenses following the procedure of Example 2.<br>
Example 2<br>
The formulation listed in Table A was used to prepare sil/cone hydrogel<br>
lenses. Further details on the precise mixing procedure is disclosed in U.S.<br>
Pat App- Ser. No. OS/957,299 Wed on September 20, 2001,<br>
The remainder of the formulation were additives and diluents. The nionomet to<br>
diluent ratio was 100:20, the diluent being 3,7-dimethy"-3-octanol. Acetic acid,<br>
1 % of the final mix. was used to stabilize the monomer<br>
The front and hack curve mckis prepared by the method of Example 1<br>
were coated with a high MW poly-HEMA coating. Approximately 6 microliters<br>
of a 1.3% wt percent solution of po!y-HEMA in 70:30 ethanol:ethyl lactate was<br>
applied onto the front curve mold surface (concave) by spin costing at 80W<br>
rpm for B sec. A jet of air was applied to the edge of the spinning part during<br>
the last two seconds of the spin cycle to remove the excess coating.<br>
Approximately 8.5 microliters of a 1.1% solution of poly-HEMA in 70:30<br>
ethanokethyl lactate was applied to the back curve mold surface (convex) by<br>
spin coating at 6000 rpm for 2 sec followed by 6 sec at 8000 rpm. A jet of air<br>
was applied to the edge of the spinning part during the last two seconds of the<br>
spin cycle to remove the excess coating. Lenses were made by dispensing the<br>
above lens fornnulation into the lens molds, closing the parts, precuring under<br>
visible lights for 45 sec at 45°C followed by approximately 7 minutes of cure<br>
under visible lights at 70cC. In all cases the precure was begun within 30 sec<br>
of lens monomer dose into the mold.<br>
The lenses were tested clinically and were found to be equivalent in on-<br>
eye wettability, or tear break-up time, and deposition resistance to ACUVUE®<br>
etafilcon A lenses demonstrating that application of the coating to the lens<br>
results in a physiological compatible lens.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of Polypropylene Lens Molds<br>
The FC and BC of lens molds were prepared using the method of<br>
Example 1 and substituting polypropylene (manufactured by Atofina EOD<br>
00-11) for the alicyclic co-polymer of Example 1.<br>
Example 4<br>
Preparation of Lenses Using the Molds of Example 3<br>
Lenses were made using the formulation and method of Example 2, but<br>
substituting the molds of Example 3, for the molds of Example 1. The finished<br>
lenses were examined for defects in the coating using a visual inspection<br>
apparatus. Defects were discrete areas on the surface of the finished lens<br>
where the coating was not applied. The percentage of defects was calculated<br>
and recorded in Table B, below. This example demonstrates that molds made<br>
from alicyclic co-polymers may be used to produce coated lenses with<br>
significantly reduced coating defects.<br>
Example 5<br>
Lenses Prepared With Different Mold Materials for the FC and BC<br>
FC and BC molds made by the method of Examples 1 and 3 were used<br>
to prepare lenses by the method of Example 2. Dissimilar mold materials were<br>
used to make some lenses as per Table C. The coating defect rate was<br>
measured as well as the haze The haze values indicated were measured by<br>
placing test lenses in saline in a clear cell above a black background,<br>
illuminating from below with a fiber optic lamp at an angle 66° normal to the<br>
lens cell, and capturing an image of the lens from above with a video camera.<br>
The background-subtracted scattered light image was quantitatively analyzed,<br>
by integrating over the central 10 mm of the lens, and then compared to a -1.00<br>
diopter CSI Thin lens (commercial lens made by Wesley Jessen 33 East Tower<br>
A, Des Planes, IL), which is arbitrarily set at a haze value of 100, with no lens<br>
set as a haze value of zero. This data shows that the lowest number of defects<br>
are produced when the FC and the BC molds were made from an alicyclic<br>
co-polymer.<br>
Example 6<br>
Preparation of Lens Molds from Alicyclic Polymer<br>
Pellets of the alicyclic polymer Zeonex® 480R were placed in a de-<br>
humidifying dryer at 100°C for approximately four (4) hours. An attempt was<br>
made to form molds using the method of Example 1. Usable lens molds could<br>
not be formed with this material. Only tabs of cured materials were recovered<br>
and the lens mold cavities were not formed. Increasing the temperature of the<br>
molding machine (to the machine"s maximum safety level) and the temperature<br>
of the mold material did not correct this problem. No usable molds were<br>
formed. This example demonstrates the distinction between the successful<br>
production of molds made from alicyclic co-polymers and the failure of molds<br>
made from alicyclic polymers.<br>
Example 7<br>
Preparation of Blended Molds<br>
An amount of polypropylene (ATOFINA EOD-0011, 50%) was blended<br>
with Zeonor 1060 R (50%) in a mixing tumbler and processed for 15 minutes.<br>
This mixture was processed in a extrusion or palletizing process to generate a<br>
uniform material. The blended material was placed into an injection molding<br>
machine and extruded into male and female halves of a lens mold and<br>
subsequently cured. The cured molds were placed into a nitrogen environment<br>
of 30 minutes before use.<br>
Example 8<br>
Preparation of Silicone Hydrogel Lenses B-<br>
The reaction components and diluent (D30) listed in Table D were mixed<br>
together with stirring or rolling for at least about 3 hours at about 23°C, until all<br>
components were dissolved. The reactive components are reported as weight<br>
percent of all reactive components and the diluent is weight percent of final<br>
reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was placed into the lens molds of<br>
Example 7 and irradiated using Philips TL 20W/03T fluorescent bulbs at 45°C<br>
under N2. The cure conditions in a gJove box are at approx 0.2 mW/c2 for<br>
about 6.5 minutes, followed by 2.5 mWw/c2 for about 12 min. The oxygen level<br>
was 
determine if the cured lenses remained with the front curve or the back curve of<br>
the mold. Table E lists the percentage of Zeonor and polypropylene (pp) in<br>
each lens mold half and the number of lenses of Lens Type B which remained<br>
with either the front curve or the back curve after they were separated.<br>
