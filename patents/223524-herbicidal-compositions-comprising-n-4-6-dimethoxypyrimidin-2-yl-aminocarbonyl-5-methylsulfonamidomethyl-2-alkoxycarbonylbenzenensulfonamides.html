Herbicidal compositions comprising N-[(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-<br>
yl)aminocarbonyl]-5-methylsulfonamidomethyl-2-<br>
alkoxycarbonylbenzenesulfonamides<br>
The invention relates to the technical field of crop protection agents, in particular to herbicidal compositions comprising N-[(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yl)aminocarbonyl]-5-methylsulfonamidomethyl-2-alkoxycarbonylbenzenesulfonamides and/or salts thereof.<br>
WO 95/10507 (PCT/EP94/03369) discloses phenylsulfonylureas of the formula 1 and salts thereof<br><br>
where the formula 1, owing to the extensive and wide definition of the radicals A, W, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6 and R7, includes a large number of possible individual compounds.<br>
Table 1 of WO 95/10507 lists compounds of the formula 1a<br><br><br>
the examples having the numbers 105, 209, 217, 395, 399, 403, 407, 497 and 536 relating to those compounds of the formula 1a where Z is CH, X and Y are methoxy, R7 is hydrogen, R1 is alkoxycarbonyl, R4 is hydrogen and R5 is a radical containing a sulfonyl group (S02CH3, S02NHCH3, S02N(CH3)2, S02 N(CH3)2, S02CH2F, S02CF3, S02C2H5, S02-n-C3H7, S02CH3 or S02CH3). However, the melting point is only given for Examples 105 (R1 = methoxycarbonyl, R5 = methylsulfonyl) and 217 (R1 = methoxycarbonyl, R5 = S02N(CH3)2) and for Example 536 (sodium salt of the compound 105).<br>
In WO 95/10507, biological examples for the compounds mentioned individually above are given insofar as it is stated in general terms that the compounds of Examples 105, 217 and 536 - in addition to a series of other compounds - have very good activity against harmful plants such as Sinapis alba, Stellaria media, Chrysanthemum segetum and Lolium multiflorum in the pre- and post-emergence method at an application rate of 0.3 kg to 0.005 kg of active substance per hectare. The crop plant safety of the compounds of the formula 1 is not documented by examples in the International Published Specification mentioned.<br>
Furthermore, general mention is made of the possibility that the compounds of the formula 1 can be applied together with other herbicides. This mention is followed by an exemplary list of more than about 250 different standard active compounds of which, inter alia, amidosulfurone, bentazone, bifenox, bromoxynil, cafentrazon (ICI-A0051), chlortoluron, chlorsulfuron, clodinafop and its ester derivatives (for example clodinafop-propargyl), dicamba, dichlorprop, diclofop and its esters such as diclofop-methyl, difenzoquat, diflufenican, fenoxaprop and fenoxaprop-P and esters thereof such as, for example, fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and fenoxaprop-ethyl, flamprop-methyl, fluoroglycofen-ethyl, fluroxypyr, flurtamone, fomesafen, glufosinate, glyphosate, imazamethabenz-methyl, ioxynil, isoproturon, lactofen, MCPA, mecoprop, methabenzthiazuron, metribuzin, metsulfuron-methyl, pendimethalin, prosulfocarb, thifensulfuron-methyl, tralkoxydim, triasulfuron and tribenuron-methyl are explicitly mentioned. Other than just mentioning the substances, WO 95/10507 does not provide additional information with regard to the particular essence and purpose of a joint application, nor does it provide a reason for the intended selection<br><br>
and combination of particular active compounds.<br>
Most phenylsulfonylureas disclosed in formula 1 and 1a of WO 95/10507 have useful to good activity against a broad spectrum of economically important mono-and dicotyledonous harmful plants, and active compounds of the formula 1 or 1a also allow control of weeds encountered in rice under the specific cultivation conditions such as, for example, Sagittaria, Alisma, Eleochahs, Scirpus, Cyperus, etc., however, in many cases the individual active compounds are not sufficient to control the range of mono- and dicotyledonous weeds encountered in agricultural practice in particular in cereals or maize, but also in other crop species.<br>
With respect to the prior art mentioned and discussed herein, it was therefore an object of the invention to provide novel mixtures having herbicidal activity to enable the expert to control, with a single application or a small number of applications of herbicides in cereals and other crop species, the range of weeds or specific weeds which are difficult to control. Furthermore, the mixtures of herbicidal active compounds which are known in principle are meant to contribute to close so-called "activity gaps" and, if possible, to reduce at the same time the application rates of the individual active compounds and to increase flexibility in the timing of the application.<br>
This object, and other objects which have not been specifically mentioned, is achieved by herbicidal compositions having the features of in claim 1. Thus, the invention provides herbicidal compositions, comprising<br>
A)       at least one herbicidal active compound from the group of the<br>
substituted phenylsulfonylureas of the formula I and agriculturally acceptable, i.e. safe or usable, salts thereof<br><br><br>
R1       is (C1-C8)-alkyl, (C3-C4)-alkenyl, (C3-C4)-alkynyl or (C1-C4)-alkyl which is mono- to tetrasubstituted by radicals selected from the group consisting of halogen and (C1-C2)-alkoxy, and<br>
B)       at least one herbicidally active compound selected from the group of the compounds consisting of<br>
Ba)     herbicides which have selective activity against grasses in cereals, Bb)     herbicides which have selective activity against dicotyledons in<br>
cereals, Be)     herbicides which have selective activity against grasses and<br>
dicotyledons in cereals and Bd)     herbicides which are active against weed grasses and broad-leaved<br>
weeds and which are nonselective in non-crop areas or perennial<br>
crops (plantations) and/or selective in transgenic crops.<br>
The combinations of herbicidally active compounds of types A and B according to the invention permit, in a particularly advantageous manner, the control of the range of weeds required by the expert, even including certain species which are difficult to control. In addition, using the combinations according to the invention it is possible to reduce the active compound application rates of the individual combination<br><br>
partners which are comprised in the combination, thus allowing more economical approaches by the user. Finally, in a not readily foreseeable way, it was possible to achieve increases in activity which surpassed expectations, the herbicidal compositions according to the invention thus showing extensive synergistic effects.<br>
I<br>
/Furthermore, it was particularly surprising in the context of the invention that the<br>
sulfonylureas of the formula I carrying a methylsulfonylamidomethyl substituent in<br>
position 5 of the phenyl ring in combination with other herbicides proved to be<br>
outstandingly suitable for the effective control of weed species which are difficult to<br>
control. In particular, unexpected specific activities against resistant weed grasses<br>
were observed.<br>
Altogether, the quality of the activities found for the combinations according to the invention is generally also better than for example that found for similar combinations comprising sulfonylureas of the closest prior art, as represented for example by phenylsulfonylureas carrying iodine substituents in position 4 of the phenyl ring according to formula 2 of WO 92/13845<br><br>
where the radicals according to the prior art in formula 2 are, inter alia, Q = 0, R = methyl, W = 0, R1 = H, R2 = OCH3, R3 = CH3, Z and Y = N.<br>
With respect to the specifically substituted phenylsulfonylureas of the formula I according to the invention it has to be stated that they are in principle embraced for example by the formula 1 of WO 95/10507, but that their outstanding suitability as combination partners for synergistic mixtures with other herbicides is not evident from the prior art. In particular, there are no indications in the known literature that the narrow and clearly defined group of the N-[(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yl)aminocarbonyl]-5-methylsulfonamidomethyl-2-<br><br>
alkoxycarbonylbenzenesulfonamides, which may be present in the form of their salts, occupies such an exceptional position. Likewise, neither the application rates nor the ratios of the amounts of the individual compounds to be employed in the combinations according to the invention are evident from the prior art. Finally, the combinations according to the invention are advantageous in comparison with other herbicidal combinations comprising similar sulfonylureas.<br>
Particularly interesting combination partners of type A for the combinations according to the invention are compounds of the formula I or salts thereof where R1 is methyl, ethyl, n- or isopropyl, n-, tert- 2-butyl or isobutyl, n-pentyl, isopentyl, n-hexyl, isohexyl, 1,3-dimethylbutyl, n-heptyl, 1-methylhexyl or 1,4-dimethylpentyl.<br>
In a very particularly preferred embodiment, herbicidal compositions according to the invention comprise a type A compound of the formula I or a salt thereof in which R1 is methyl.<br>
The compounds of type A (formula I) can form salts where the hydrogen of the -S02-NH-CO- group is replaced by an agriculturally suitable cation. These salts are, for example, metal, in particular alkali metal salts (for example sodium or potassium salts) or alkaline earth metal salts, or else ammonium salts or salts with organic amines. Likewise, salt formation can occur by addition of a strong acid to the heterocycle moiety of the compounds of the formula I. Suitable for this purpose are, for example, HCI, HN03, trichloroacetic acid, acetic acid or palmitinic acid.<br>
Particularly advantageous type A compounds are those where the salt of the herbicide of the formula (I) is formed by replacing the hydrogen of the -S02-NH-CO-group by a cation selected from the group of the alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and ammonium, preferably sodium.<br>
Even if the compounds of the formula I contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms or else double bonds which are not specifically indicated in the general formula, they nevertheless belong to the type A compounds. The stereoisomers which are possible and which are defined by their specific spatial form, such as<br><br>
enantiomers, diastereoisomers, Z isomers and E isomers, are all embraced by formula I, and they can be obtained from stereoisomer mixtures by customary methods, or else be prepared by stereoselective reactions in combination with the use of stereochemical2 pure starting materials. Thus, the mentioned stereoisomers i     can be employed according to the invention in pure form or else as their mixtures.<br>
The combination partners of type B are generally standard herbicides which are, however, selected according to certain criteria. Thus, except for two (subgroup Bd)), they are herbicides which act selectively against undesirable plants in cereals. The harmful plants to be controlled include in particular grasses and/or dicotyledons. Grasses which are to be particularly controlled include, inter alia, Alopecurus myosuroides, Avena fatua, Apera spica venti, Lolium ssp., Phalares ssp., Setaria ssp., Agropyron repens, Bromus ssp., Sorghum ssp.; dicotyledonous harmful plants which can be controlled particularly effectively include, inter alia, Lamium ssp., Veronica ssp., Viola ssp., Stellaria media, Matricaria ssp., Galium aparine, Sinapis album, Raphanus raphanistrum, Myosotes arcensis, Polygonum ssp., Chenopodium ssp., Rochia ssp./Cirsium, Galeopsis tetra., Capsella bursa pastoris, Paphaver rhoeas, Physallis angulata, Brassica napus, Descurainia richardsonii, Oxalis ssp.; the combinations according to the invention have particularly favorable activity inter alia in the control of Lolium multiflorum, Avena fatua, Apera spica venti, Galium aparine, Oxalis spp, Phalaris minor, Descurainia richardssonii, Capsella bursa pastoris, Polygonum convovulus, Chenopdium album, Paphaver rhoeas, Physalis angulata, Brassica napus, Lamium purpreum, Kochia scorp., etc.<br>
With regard to the activity of the standard herbicides of type B it is in turn possible to grade or classify them with respect to the plants which are controlled most effectively. Thus, some of the type B herbicides are effective almost exclusively against grasses, others predominantly against dicotyledons, whereas the herbicides of type B from subgroup Be) are employed both against grasses and against dicotyledons. However, in each case an optimized activity spectrum results for the combinations according to the invention by complementation and intensification of the herbicidal properties of the compounds of type A which, on their own have a particularly advantageous range of properties in the control of harmful niant* in<br><br>
cereals. Last, but not least, the intensification and complementation of the activity spectrum also applies to the type B compounds of group Bd), which includes the herbicides which are active against weed grasses and broad-leaved weeds and which are nonselective in non-crop areas or in perennial crops (plantations) and/or selective in transgenic crops.<br>
In a preferred variant, a composition according to the invention is characterized in that it comprises, as herbicide(s) of type B, one or more herbicides which have selective activity against grasses in cereals and which are selected from the group consisting of the 2-(4-aryloxyphenoxy)propionic acids and esters thereof, ureas, cyclohexanedione oximes, arylalanins, 2,6-dinitroanilins, imidazolinones and difenzoquat. In addition to the individual substances mentioned, the classes of chemical substances mentioned include a number of grass herbicides which are suitable as combination partners of the compounds of type A.<br>

The compounds B1) to B12) are herbicides known, for example, from the reference given for the respective compound, which have specific selective activity against grasses in cereals. In addition to the parent compound, whose formula is generally<br><br>
also given for reasons of clarity, reference is also made to derivatives of the parent compounds which are usually employed. Thus, for example, B4) (clodinafop) is usually employed in the form of the propargyl ester and diclofop (B3)) is employed as methyl ester, etc. When optically active forms of the type B compounds are customary, these forms are also referred to (for example fenoxaprop-ethyl and fenoxaprop-P-ethyl, etc.).<br>
The compounds B1), B3) and B4) belong to the class of chemical substances of the 2-(4-aryloxyphenoxy)propionic acids or to the ester derivatives. B2), B6) and B7) are ureas, whereas B8) is a representative of the imidazolinones, B9) is a cyclohexanedione oxime, B11) is an arylalanine and B12) is a 2,6-dinitroaniline. Thus, although the representatives of this group have relatively differing chemical structures, they do nevertheless, owing to their activity spectrum and to the fact that they are synergists of the compounds of the formula I, form a coherent subgroup.<br>
Particularly advantageous mixtures in the context of the invention result when the combination according to the invention comprises the type B compounds diclofop-methyl, fenoxaprop-P-ethyl, isoproturon, mixtures of clodinafop-propargyl with cloquintocet-mexyl (known under the protected name Topik®) and/or imazamethabenz-methyl.<br>
The invention furthermore provides compositions which comprise the herbicides of type B from subgroup Bb). Particular preference is given to employing one or more herbicides which have selective activity against dicotyledons in cereals and which are selected from the group comprising aryloxyalkylcarboxylic acids, lydroxybenzonitriles, diphenyl ethers, azoles and pyrazoles, diflufenican and 2entazone.<br>
:rom among the possible aryloxyalkylcarboxylic acids, preference is given in turn to hose herbicides which are selected from the group comprising 313) mecoprop, mecoprop-P<br><br><br>

A fourth subgroup of compounds, whose addition to compounds of type A makes it possible to obtain herbicidal compositions having superadditive activity, is the subgroup Bd) of the herbicides which have activity against weed grasses and broad-leaved weeds and which are nonselective in non-crop areas and/or selective in transgenic crops.

Combinations of the active compounds A + B show superadditive effects, i.e. with the same level of control of harmful plants, the herbicidal compositions according to the invention permit reduction of the application rate, make it possible to control some species at all and/or allow the safety margin, especially in cereal crops, to be increased. Both are advantageous, economically as well as ecologically. Here, the selection of the amounts of components A + B to be employed, the ratio of the components A : B and the application sequence as well as, for example, the formulation to be selected, depend on a large number of factors. Not insignificant in this context are, inter alia, the kind of co-components, the development stage of the weed grasses or broad-leaved weeds, the range of weeds to be controlled, environmental factors, climatic conditions, soil properties, etc.<br>
In a very particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, herbicidal compositions according to the invention have a synergistically effective content of a combination of the compounds of the formula I or salts thereof (type A compounds) with compounds from group B. It has to be emphasized that even in combinations having application rates or weight ratios of A:B where a synergism is not in each case immediately evident - for example because the individual compounds are usually present in the combination in very different application rates or else because the<br><br>
control of the harmful plants by the individual compounds is already very good - the herbicidal compositions of the invention generally have an inherent synergistic activity.<br>
The application rates of herbicide A are generally between 0.1 and 100 g of ai/ha (ai = active ingredients, i.e. the application rate based on the active compound), preferably between 2 and 40 g of ai/ha.<br>
The application rates of compounds of type B are usually:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention can be present both as mixed formulations of the components which are then applied in a customary manner diluted with water, or as tank mixes which are prepared by jointly diluting the individually formulated components with water.<br>
The active compounds of types A and B can be formulated in various ways, depending on the prevailing biological and/or chemico-physical parameters. The following are examples of suitable formulations:<br>
wettable powders (WP), emulsifiable concentrates (EC), water-soluble powders (SP), water-soluble concentrates (SL), concentrated emulsions (BW), such as oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, sprayable solutions or emulsions, capsule suspensions (CS), oil- or water-based dispersions (SC), suspoemulsions, suspension concentrates, dusts (DP), oil-miscible solutions (OL), seed-dressing products, granules (GR) in the form of microgranules, spray granules, coated granules and adsorption granules, granules for broadcasting or soil application, water-soluble granules (SG), water-dispersible granules (WG), ULV formulations, microcapsules and waxes.<br><br>
Among these, water-soluble wettable powders (WP), water-dispersible granules (WG), water-emulsifiable granules (EC), suspoemulsions (SE) and oil-suspension concentrates (SC) are preferred.<br>
These individual types of formulation are known in principle and are described, for example, in: Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Technology], Volume 7, C. Hauser Verlag Munich, 4th Ed. 1986; Wade van Valkenburg, "Pesticide Formulations", Marcel Dekker, N.Y., 1973; K. Martens, "Spray Drying Handbook", 3rd Ed. 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd. London.<br>
The formulation auxiliaries required, such as inert materials, surfactants, solvents and other additives are also known and are described, for example, in: Watkins, "Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers", 2nd Ed., Darland Books, Caldwell N.J., H.v. Olphen, "Introduction to Clay Colloid Chemistry"; 2nd Ed., J. Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y.; Marsden, "Solvents Guide"; 2nd Ed., Interscience, N.Y. 1963; McCutcheon's "Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual", MC Publ. Corp., Ridgewood N.J.; Sisley and Wood, "Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents", Chem. Publ. Co. Inc., N.Y. 1964; Schonfeldt, "Grenzflachenaktive Athylenoxidaddukte" [Surface-active ethylene oxide adducts], Wiss. Verlagsgesellschaft, Stuttgart 1976; Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Technology], Volume 7, C. Hauser Verlag Munich, 4th Ed. 1986.<br>
Based on these formulations, it is also possible to prepare combinations with other pesticidally active compounds, herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, and also antidotes, safeners, fertilizers and/or growth regulators, for example in the form of a ready mix or a tank mix.<br>
The herbicide combinations of the invention are prepared particularly advantageously by formulating the compounds of the formula I or salts thereof (type A compounds) with one or more compounds of type B similar to a conventional crop protection formulation from the group consisting of water-soluble wettable powders (WP), water-dispersible granules (WDG), water-emulsifiable granules (WEG), suspoemulsions (SE) and oil suspension concentrates (SC).<br><br>
Wettable powders are preparations which are uniformly dispersible in water and which, besides the active compounds, also comprise ionic and/or nonionic surfactants (wetting agents, dispersants), for example polyethoxylated alkylphenols, polyethoxylated fatty alcohols, polyethoxylated fatty amines, fatty alcohol polyglycol ether sulfates, alkanesulfonates or alkylarylsulfonates, sodium lignosulfonate, sodium 2,2'-dinaphthylmethane-6,6'-disulfonate, sodium dibutylnaphthalene-sulfonate or else sodium oleoylmethyltaurinate, in addition to a diluent or inert substance.<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates are prepared by dissolving the active compound or active compounds in an organic solvent, for example butanol, cyclohexanone, dimethylformamide, xylene, or else higher-boiling aromatics or hydrocarbons with the addition of one or more ionic and/or nonionic surfactants (emulsifiers). Examples of emulsifiers which can be used are: calcium salts of alkylarylsulfonic acids, such as calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, or nonionic emulsifiers such as fatty acid polyglycol esters, alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers, propylene oxide/ethylene oxide condensates (for example block copolymers), alkyl polyethers, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters or other polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters.<br>
Dusts are obtained by grinding the active compound or the active compounds with finely divided substances, for example talc, natural clays such as kaolin, bentonite and pyrophyllite, or diatomaceous earth.<br>
Granules can be prepared either by spraying the active compound or the active :ompounds onto adsorptive granulated inert material or by applying active compound concentrates to the surface of carriers such as sand, kaolinites or of granulated inert material by means of binders, for example polyvinyl alcohol, sodium Dolyacrylate or else mineral oils.<br>
yVater-dispersible granules are generally prepared by the customary processes such as spray drying, fluidized-bed granulation, disk granulation, mixing with high¬speed mixers and extrusion without solid inert material. It is also possible to granulate suitable active compounds in the manner customarilv used for nrprwinn<br><br>
fertilizer granules - if appropriate in a mixture with fertilizers.<br>
Generally, the agrochemical preparations according to the invention comprise 0.1 to 99% by weight, in particular 2 to 95% by weight, of active compounds of types A and B, in addition to customary formulation auxiliaries.<br>
The concentrations of the active compounds A + B in the formulations may vary. In wettable powders, the active compound concentration is, for example, approximately 10 to 95% by weight, the remainder to 100% by weight being composed of customary formulation components. In the case of emulsifiable concentrates, the active compound concentration may amount to approximately 1 to 85% by weight, preferably 5 to 80% by weight. Formulations in the form of dusts comprise approximately 1 to 25% by weight, in most cases 5 to 20% by weight, of active compounds, and sprayable solutions comprise approximately 0.2 to 25% by weight, preferably 2 to 20% by weight, of active compounds. The active compound content of granules such as dispersible granules depends partly on whether the active compound is in liquid or solid form and on which granulation auxiliaries and fillers are being used. In general, the content of the water-dispersible granules amounts to between 10 and 90% by weight.<br>
In addition, the abovementioned active compound formulations comprise, if appropriate, the tackifiers, wetting agents, dispersants, emulsifiers, penetrants, preservatives, antifreeze agents, solvents, fillers, colorants, carriers, antifoams, evaporation inhibitors and pH and viscosity regulators which are customary in each case.<br>
Owing to the relatively low application rate of the combinations of A + B according to the invention, they are generally already very well tolerated. In particular, the combinations according to the invention permit a reduction of the absolute application rate, compared with the individual application of a herbicidally active compound. However, to increase the tolerability and/or selectivity of the herbicide combinations according to the invention, if desired, even more, it is advantageous to apply these jointly in a mixture or successively at different times together with<br><br>
safeners or antidotes. Suitable safeners or antidotes for the combinations according to the invention are the compounds known, for example, from EP-A-333 131 (ZA-89/1960), EP-A-269 806, (US-A-4,891,057), EP-A-346 620 (AU-A-89/34951) and the international patent applications PCT/EP 90/01966 (WO-91/08202) and PCT/EP 90/02020 (WO-91/078474) and the literature cited therein, or they can be prepared by the methods described therein. Further suitable safeners are known from EP-A-94 349 (US-A-4,902,304), EP-A-191 736 (US-A-4,881,966) and EP-A-0 492 366 and the literature cited therein.<br>

At least some of the compounds mentioned are additionally described in EP-A-0 640 587, to which reference is made herewith for purposes of disclosure.<br>
The safeners (antidotes) of the above groups a) to g) (in particular compounds of the formulae C1 and C2) reduce or neutralize phytotoxic effects which can occur when using the product combinations according to the invention in crops of useful plants, without adversely affecting the activity of the herbicides against harmful plants. Thus, it is possible to increase the area of use of the herbicide mixtures according to the invention considerably. In particular, the use of safeners permits the use of combinations which hitherto could be used only with limitations or without sufficient success, i.e. of combinations which, without safener, at low application rates with a narrow spectrum of activity did not provide sufficient control of the harmful plants.<br>
The herbicidal mixtures according to the invention and said safeners can be applied together (in the form of a finished formulation or by the tank mix method) or in any desired sequence one after the other. The weight ratio safener: herbicide (group A, i.e. compounds of the formula I) can vary within wide limits and is preferably in the range from 1:10 to 10:1, in particular from 1:10 to 5:1. The amounts of herbicides (type A and type B compounds) and safener which are optimal in each case depend on the type of herbicide mixture used and/or on the safener used and on the nature of the plant stand to be treated and can be determined in each individual case by suitable preliminary trials.<br><br>
Depending on their properties, the safeners of type C) can be used for pretreating the seed of the crop plant (seed dressing) or be incorporated into the seed furrows before seeding or used together with the herbicide mixture before or after the plants have emerged. Pre-emergence treatment includes treatment of the area under cultivation before seeding and also treatment of those areas under cultivation which have been seeded but where growth has not yet taken place. Application together with the herbicide mixture is preferred. Tank mixes or finish formulations can be used for this purpose.<br>
The required application rates of safeners can vary within wide limits, depending on the indication and the herbicide used, and are generally in the range from 0.001 to 1 kg, preferably 0.005 to 0.2 kg, of active compound per hectare.<br>
For use, the formulations, which are in commercially available form, are, if appropriate, diluted in the customary manner, for example using water in the case of wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, dispersions and water-dispersible granules. Preparations in the form of dusts, granules for soil application or for broadcasting and sprayable solutions are usually not diluted further with additional inert substances prior to use.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for controlling undesirable plants which comprises applying a herbicidally effective amount of a combination of active compounds A + B according to the invention to these plants or to the area under cultivation. The active compounds can be applied to the plants, to parts of plants, plant seeds or to the area under cultivation. In a preferred variant of the method, the compounds of the formula (I) or salts thereof (type A compounds) are applied at application rates of from 0.1 to 100 g of ai/ha, preferably from 2 to 40 g of ai/ha, while the application rates for the compounds of type B are from 1 to 5000 g of ai/ha. Preference is given to applying the active compounds of types A and B simultaneously or at different times at a weight ratio of 1:2500 to 20:1. Furthermore, particular preference is given to the joint application of the active compounds in the form of tank mixes, the optimally formulated concentrated formulations of the individual active compounds being mixed together in the tank with water and the<br><br>
resulting spray liquor being applied.<br>
Since the combinations according to the invention provide extremely good crop safety and at the same time very efficient control of harmful plants, they can be considered to be selective. In a preferred variation of the method, herbicidal compositions comprising the active compound combinations according to the invention are therefore employed for selective control of undesirable plants.<br>
The method for the selective control of harmful plants using the combination partners of type B) from subgroups Ba) to Be) is particularly advantageous when the herbicidal compositions of the invention are employed in crops of useful cereal plants, in plantations and on meadows or pasture land. However, the use in maize or other crops of useful plants such as, for example, rice, is not precluded a priori.<br>
The combination partners of type A, applied on their own by the pre-emergence and post-emergence method in cereals, on non-crop areas and in plantations, already control a relatively wide range of annual and perennial broad-leaved weeds, weed grasses and Cyperaceae.<br>
Combination with the type B partners mentioned in the invention improve the activity spectrum of the type A compounds even further.<br>
Thus, the compounds B1) to B12) complement and enhance, inter alia, the activity in the control of grass weeds in cereals and, to some extent, also the activity against broad-leaved weeds in cereals, in each case both by the pre-emergence and by the post-emergence method.<br>
The growth-regulating herbicides from the subgroup Bb) (compounds B13) to B16)), i.e. in particular the derivatives of dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, dichlorophenoxypropionic acid, chloromethylphenoxyacetic acid and chloromethylphenoxypropionic acid and the analogous dicamba (B17)) and fluroxypyr (B18)), which is also related, serve, in the context of the invention, primarily for the more efficient control of annual and perennial broad-leaved weeds,<br><br>
in particular by the post-emergence method in cereals.<br>
The compounds B19) and B20) (HBNs or bipyhdilium derivatives) are herbicidally active compounds which, above all, improve the effectiveness of weed control in cereals. They are mainly employed by the post-emergence method. The nitrodiphenyl ethers B21) to B25) are employed both pre-emergence and post-emergence. They serve to enhance the activity in cereals.<br>
The azoles and pyrazoles of the subgroup Bb) (for example B26) to B28)) can be employed particularly advantageously at comparatively low application rates by the post-emergence method for the control of dicotyledonous weeds in cereals.<br>
B29) improves the activity spectrum of the combinations according to the invention used pre- and post-emergence in the control of weeds in cereals and other crop types, whereas B30) is a herbicidally active compound which is employed in a large number of agricultural crop plants by the post-emergence method for controlling weeds.<br>
The triazines, triazoles, (thio)carbamates and furanones of the subgroup Be) (for example B31) to B34)) are common active compounds which can be employed both by the pre-emergence and by the post-emergence method to increase the activity of the type A compounds in the control of weed grasses and broad-leaved weeds in cereals, in non-crop areas or in plantations.<br>
Finally, the compounds B35) to B45) (subgroup Be)) preferably serve in the invention for controlling broad-leaved weeds - to some extent also weed grasses - in cereals and in potatoes, in meadows or in non-crop areas, and, if appropriate, in plantations or perennial crops, by the post-emergence method, though in some instances also by the pre-emergence method.<br>
Depending on the nature of the combination partner B, the herbicidal combinations according to the invention can also be used advantageously for controlling undesirable plants in non-crop areas and/or in transgenic crops, for example maize,<br><br>
rice, soya, cereals, inter alia. Particularly suitable for this purpose are the partners from group Bd) (compounds B46) and B47)).<br>
Here, the term non-crop area does not only include paths, open spaces, industrial terrain and railways which regularly have to be kept free from weeds, but, in the context of the invention, plantation crops are also included in this generic term, even if they are not mentioned separately. Thus, the combinations according to the invention (especially those comprising combination partners from subgroup Bd)) which cover a wide spectrum of weeds extending from annual and perennial broad-leaved weeds such as, for example, Agropyron, Paspalum, Cynodon, Imperata over Pennisetum, Convolvulus and Cirsium to Rumex and others, can be employed for the selective control of harmful plants in plantation crops such as oil palm, coconut palm, rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), citrus, pineapples, cotton, coffee, cocoa and the like, and also in fruit production and viticulture. Equally, the combinations according to the invention can be employed in arable crop production using the no-till or zero-till methods. Alternatively, as already mentioned they can be used in proper non-crop areas, i.e. nonselective^ on paths, in open spaces, etc., to keep these areas free of undesirable vegetation. However, the combination partners of group Bd), which are nonselective per se, do not only become selective herbicides when the crop plants have the appropriate resistance, but combinations according to the invention are also selective when used in transgenic crops. Transgenic crops are those in which the plants are made resistant to nonselective herbicides by genetic manipulation or selection. C1-op plants which have been modified in such a way, for example maize, cereals or soya, then permit the selective use of combinations comprising B46) and/or B47).<br>
In summary, it may be stated that superadditive (= synergistic) effects are achieved when N-[(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yl)aminocarbonyl]-5-methylsulfonamidomethyl-2-alkoxycarbonylbenzenesulfonamides, and/or salts thereof are used together with one or more active compounds of group B, optionally and particularly preferably additionally with one or more safeners of group C. The activity in the combinations is more pronounced than that of the individual products used employed alone. These effects permit<br><br>
♦	the application rate to be reduced,<br>
♦	a broader spectrum of broad-leaved weeds and weed grasses to be controlled,<br>
♦	a more rapid and safer action,<br>
♦	a more prolonged action,<br>
♦	complete control of harmful plants with only one or few applications and<br>
♦	a widening of the period of time when the active compounds in the combination can be applied.<br>
The abovementioned properties are required in weed control practice to keep agricultural crops free from undesirable competing plants and thus to ensure and/or increase yields from a qualitative and quantitative point of view. The combinations according to the invention markedly surpass the prior art with a view to the above-described properties.<br>
Additionally, the combinations according to the invention permit the outstanding control of otherwise resistant harmful plants.<br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the invention:<br>

2. Biological examples<br>
The examples mentioned below were carried out in the greenhouse, and in some instances, in field trials.<br>
Field trials<br>
After the natural emergence of the weeds in the cereals, the herbicides or the combinations were applied using plot sprayers. After the application, the effects, such as damage to the crop plants and the effect on broad-leaved weeds/weed grasses, were assessed by visual scoring. The herbicidal activity was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively (0-100%) by comparing untreated and treated plots with respect to the influence on plant growth and chlorotic and necrotic effects up to the total eradication of the weeds. Application was carried out at the 2-4 leaf stage of the crop plants and weeds. Evaluation was carried out approximately 4 weeks after the application.<br>
Greenhouse trials<br>
In the greenhouse trials, the crop plants and broad-leaved weeds/weed grasses were grown in size 13 pots and treated at the 2-4 leaf stage. The pots were subsequently stood in the greenhouse under good conditions for growth (temperature, air humidity, water supply).<br>
Evaluation was carried out similar to the field trials, i.e. by visually scoring the treated plants in comparison to untreated control variants. These evaluations were carried out 3 weeks after the application of the preparations to be tested and<br><br>
combinations thereof. The experiments were carried out in duplicate.<br>
Evaluation of the combination effects in the examples<br>
For the assessment of the combination effects, the activity of the individual components was added and compared to the effect of mixtures of the same dosage. In many cases, it became evident that the combinations had higher efficacies than the sum of the individual effects.<br>
In cases of less pronounced effects, the expected value was calculated using COLBY'S formula and compared to the empirical result. The calculated expected theoretical efficacy of a combination is determined using the formula of S.R. Colby: "Calculation of synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide combinations", Weeds 15 (1967), pages 20 to 22.<br><br>
where<br>
X =	% damage by herbicide A at an application rate of x kg of ai/ha;<br>
Y =	% damage by herbicide B at an application rate of y kg of ai/ha;<br>
Z =	% damage by a further herbicide C at an application rate of z kg of<br>
ai/ha;<br>
E =	expected value, i.e. expected damage by herbicides A + B (or A+B+C)<br>
and x + y (or x + y + z) kg of ai/ha<br><br>
Synergistic effects were assumed to be present when the empirical value was greater than the expected value. Combinations of individual components of the same active compounds could also be prepared by using the sum formula.<br>
However, in most cases the synergistic increase in activity is so high that the Colby criterion can be dispensed with; in these cases, the activity of the combination considerably surpasses the formal (calculated) sum of the activities of the individual compounds.<br>
Particular attention has to be drawn to the fact that when the synergism between the active compounds employed here is assessed, the highly different application rates of the individual active compounds have to be taken into consideration. Thus, it is not expedient to compare the activities of the active compound combinations and those of the individual active compounds in each case at identical application rates. The amounts of active compounds that can be saved according to the invention become evident only from the superadditive increase in activity when using the combined applicational rates or by the reduction of the application rates of the two individual active compounds in the combinations in comparison to the individual active compounds, the activity remaining the same in each case.<br><br><br><br>

The examples show that the individual active compounds allow efficient control of individual weeds only in high dosages. If the combination partners are applied in low dosages, they generally only have low activity, far less than required in practice. Good effects against all of the weed species examined can only be obtained by joint application of the active compounds. Here, the additive effect of the individual components was surpassed considerably, i.e. their required level of control is achieved by significantly lower application rates. Owing to these effects, the activity spectrum is widened significantly. Even populations of harmful plants which have already developed resistance against individual herbicides are more effectively controlled by the combinations according to the invention (cf. Table 9).<br>
The crop safety, assessed in the form of damage, is not affected negatively, i.e. the combinations can be judged to be fully selective.<br>
