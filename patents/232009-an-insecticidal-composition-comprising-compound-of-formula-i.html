				<td>IJNJSECTICIDAL TRICYCLIC DERIVATIVES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to insecticidal compounds and their use in controlling insects. In particular, it pertains to insecticidal tricyclic derivatives and agriculturally acceptable salts thereof, compositions of these insecticides, and methods for their use in controlling insects.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is well known that insects can cause significant damage to crops grown in agriculture, resulting in loss of millions of dollars of value associated with a given crop. Although there are many orders of insects that can cause significant crop damage, insects of the suborder "Homoptera" are of major importance. The suborder Homoptera includes, for example, aphids, leafhoppers, cicadas, whiteflies, and mealybugs, to name a few. Homopterans have piercing/sucking mouthparts, enabling them to feed by withdrawing sap from vascular plants. Insect damage from homopterans is manifested in several different ways, other than damage caused by direct feeding. For example, many species excrete honeydew, a sticky waste product that adheres to plants upon which the insect feeds and lives. Honeydew alone causes cosmetic injury to crop plants. Sooty molds will often grow on honeydew, making food products or ornamental plants look unappealing, thereby reducing their cosmetic and economic value. Some homopterans have toxic saliva that is injected into plants while they are feeding. The saliva can cause plant damage through disfigurement and in some instances plant death. Homopterans can also vector disease-causing pathogens. Unlike direct damage, it does not take a large number of disease-vectoring insects to cause considerable damage to crop plants.<br>
Accordingly, there is a continuing demand for new insecticides for control of, for example, Homoptera and other orders of insects; as well as new acaricides, that are safer, more effective, and less costly for use on crops such as wheat, corn,<br><br>
soybeans, potatoes, and cotton to name a few. For crop protection, insecticides and acaricides are desired which can control the insects and acarids without damaging the crops, and have no deleterious effects to mammals and other living organisms.<br>
Its equivalent WO93/00811 and US Patent 5,366,975 disclose a method of controlling an invertebrate pest, comprising contacting the pest with a pest-controlling amount of an agent having substantial inhibitory activity toward a phenylethanolamine reuptake transporter as determined by a radioactive octopamine reuptake inhibition assay. Compounds in compositions capable of inhibiting the octopamine transporter set forth in WO93/00811 and US Patent 5,366,975 include tncyclic antidepressants,. wherein the tncyclic antidepressants exemplified are desipramine, amitriptyline, imipramine, amoxapine, nortriptyline, protriptyline, maprotiline, and doxepin, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Desipramine and amitriptyline are specifically shown to have anti-feeding activity against tobacco horaworm. The tricyclic antipruritic cyproheptadine is also disclosed as having anti-feeding activity against tobacco hornworm.<br>
The disclosure of invertebrate pesticidal activity of certain tricyclic antidepressants and antipruritics in WO93/00811 and US Patent 5,366,975, based on the limited data presented therein, does not suggest insecticidal activity, or the degree of that insecticidal activity, of other tricyclic derivatives whose antidepressant or antipruritic activity is unknown.<br>
US Patent 3,436,397 claims a. class of dibenzocyclohepten-5-ylidene thiazolidinones of the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein R is selected from the group which consists of hydrogen and Ci-Cn alkyl. The dibenzocyclohepten-5-ylidene thiazolidinones are reported to have larvicidal activity against horse strongyles, anthelrninthic activity against Syphacia obvelata<br><br>
and are useful for the treatment of pinworm infestations in mammals, and also possess antibacterial activity against certain gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.<br>
There is no disclosure or suggestion in US Patent 3,436,397 that any of the compounds disclosed therein have insecticidal activity.<br>

were prepared in one-step syntheses by reacting, for example, thioxanthen-9-one<br>
(Yis<br>

solvent,	affording	the	corresponding	10-(l-methyl-4-<br>
piperidylidene)benzo[b,e]thiane, a compound of formula I.<br>
Other compounds of formula I were prepared in multi-step syntheses, for example, xanthone (Y is -O-), was reacted with l-phenylmethyl-4-piperidone, zinc, and titanium(IV) chloride hi an appropriate solvent, as set forth above, yielding the corresponding 9-(l-phenylmethyl-4-piperidylidene)xanthene. The xanthene intermediate was, in turn, reacted with 2,2,2-trichloroethyl chloroformate in an appropriate solvent, affording the corresponding 9-[l-(2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl)-4-piperidylidene]xanthene (la). Intermediate (la) was then treated with a strong base for example, sodium hydroxide, and an appropriate alcohol, such as methanol, yielding the corresponding 9-(l-methoxycarbonyl-4-piperidylidene)xanthene (Ib), which was, in turn, reduced with, for example, lithium aluminum hydride in an appropriate solvent, affording 9-(l-methyl-4-piperidylidene)xanthene, a compound of formula I.<br><br>

SCHEME 2<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
As depicted in Scheme 2, those compounds of formula I, for example,<br>
where X is -CR21=N- and Y is -O- or -S-, were also prepared in multi-step<br>
syntheses.	For example, the known amine, 2-[4-<br>
(methylethyl)phenylthio]phenylamine (Y is S), was reacted with trichloromethyl chloroformate in an appropriate solvent, affording the corresponding isocyanate Ila. Intermediate IIa was in turn cyclized with aluminum chloride in an appropriate high-boiling solvent such as chlorobenzene, yielding the corresponding cyclized ketone derivative lib, for example 2-(methylethyl)-10-dibenzo[b,fJ-l,4-thiazaperhydroepin-11-one. Intermediate IIb was then chlorinated with, for example, phosphorous oxychloride in the presence of a base catalyst, providing the corresponding chloride derivative He. The so-prepared chloride derivative lie, for example, ll-chloro-2-(methylethyl)dibenzo[b,f]l,4-thiazepine, was then converted to compounds of formula I by reacting it with an appropriate amine, for example 1-<br>
methylpiperazine,       providing       the       compound       2-(methylethyl)-ll-(4-methylpiperazinyl)dibenzo[b,f] 1,4-thiazepine I.<br>

I<br>
As depicted in Scheme 3, those compounds of formula I, for example, where X is -CRnR12CR13R14- and Y is -O- or -S-, were again prepared in multi-step syntheses. For example, an appropriately substituted acetic acid derivative, such as 2-{2-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylthio]phenyl}acetic acid, was cyclized with Eaton's Reagent affording the corresponding ketone derivative IlIa, for example, 8-(trifluoromethoxy)-llH-dibenzo[b,f]thiepan-10-one. Intermediate IlIa was first reduced to the corresponding alcohol by treatment of IlIa with sodium borohydride in an appropriate solvent, then the alcohol was chlorinated with thionyl chloride, yielding the corresponding chloro derivative Illb. The so-prepared chloride derivative nib, for example, ll-chloro-2-(trifluoromethoxy)-10H,llH-dibenzo[b,f]thiepane, was then converted to compounds of formula I by reacting it with an appropriate amine, for example 1-methylpiperazine, providing<br>
the compound 11 -(4-methylpiperazinyl)-2-(trifluoromethoxy)-1 OH, 11H-dibenzo[b,f]thiopane I.<br>
Alternatively, the ketone intermediate Ilia may be reacted directly with an appropriate base to provide additional compounds of formula I. For example, 8-(trifluoromethoxy)-llH-dibenzo[b,fjthiepan-10-one IIIa, as set forth above, may be reacted under basic conditions with halogen-containing compound, such as 4-bromopyridine, in an appropriate solvent, providing a compound of formula I, for example, 10-(4-pyridyl)-8-(trifluoromethoxy)-11 H-dibenzo[b,f] thiepan-10-ol.<br>
Any compound of formula I containing an alcohol moiety may be further reacted to prepare yet other compounds of formula I. For example, 10-(4-pyridyl)-8-(trifluoromethoxy)-llH-dibenzo[b,f]thiepan-10-ol, as set forth above, was alkylated with an alkyl halide, such as methyl iodide, then reduced with a reducing agent in an appropriate solvent, yielding the corresponding alkyl derivative, a compound of formula I, for example, 10-(l-methyl(4-l,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridyl))-8-(trifluoromethoxy)-l lH-dibenzo[b,f]thiepan-10-ol I.<br>
In yet another method, a compound of formula I containing an alcohol<br>
moiety, such as 10-(4-pyridyl)-8-(trifluoromemoxy)-llH-dibenzo[b,f]thiepan-10-<br>
ol, as set forth above, may be reacted with, for example, (diethylamino)sulfur<br>
trifluoride in an appropriate solvent, affording yet other compounds of formula I,<br>
for	example,	10-fluoro-10-(4-pyridyl)-8-(trifluoromethoxy)-llH-<br>
dibenzo[b,f]thiepane.<br>
Examples 1 through 7, inclusively, set forth below, provide in detail the methods by which compounds of formula I were prepared.<br>
One skilled in the art will, of course, recognize that the formulation and mode of application of a toxicant may affect the activity of the material in a given application. Thus, for agricultural use the present insecticidal compounds may be formulated as a granular of relatively large particle size (for example, 8/16 or 4/8 US Mesh), as water-soluble or water-dispersible granules, as powdery dusts, as wettable powders, as emulsifiable concentrates, as aqueous emulsions, as solutions, or as any of other known types of agriculturally-useful formulations, depending on the desired mode of application. It is to be understood that the amounts specified<br><br>
in this specification are intended to be approximate only, as if the word "about" were placed in front of the amounts specified.<br>
These insecticidal compositions may be applied either as water-diluted sprays, or dusts, or granules to the areas in which suppression of insects is desired. These formulations may contain as little as 0.1%, 0.2% or 0.5% to as much as 95% or more by weight of active ingredient.<br>
Dusts are free flowing admixtures of the active ingredient with finely divided solids such as talc, natural clays, kieselguhr, flours such as walnut shell and cottonseed flours, and other organic and inorganic solids which act as dispersants and carriers for the toxicant; these finely divided solids have an average particle size of less than about 50 microns. A typical dust formulation useful herein is one containing 1.0 part or less of the insecticidal compound and 99.0 parts of talc.<br>
Wettable powders, also useful formulations for insecticides, are in the form of finely divided particles that disperse readily in water or other dispersant. The wettable powder is ultimately applied to the locus where insect control is needed either as a dry dust or as an emulsion in water or other liquid. Typical carriers for wettable powders include Fuller's earth, kaolin clays, silicas, and other highly absorbent, readily wet inorganic diluents. Wettable powders normally are prepared to contain about 5-80% of active ingredient, depending on the absorbency of the carrier, and usually also contain a small amount of a wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent to facilitate dispersion. For example, a useful wettable powder formulation contains 80.0 parts of the insecticidal compound, 17.9 parts of Palmetto clay, and 1.0 part of sodium lignosulfonate and 0.3 part of sulfonated aliphatic polyester as wetting agents. Additional wetting agent and/or oil will frequently be added to a tank mix for to facilitate dispersion on the foliage of the plant.<br>
Other useful formulations for insecticidal applications are emulsifiable concentrates (ECs) which are homogeneous liquid compositions dispersible in water or other dispersant, and may consist entirely of the insecticidal compound and a liquid or solid emulsifying agent, or may also contain a liquid carrier, such as xylene, heavy aromatic naphthas, isphorone, or other non-volatile organic solvents.<br>
For insecticidal application these concentrates are dispersed in water or other liquid carrier and normally applied as a spray to the area to be treated. The percentage by weight of the essential active ingredient may vary according to the manner in which the composition is to be applied, but in general comprises 0.5 to 95% of active ingredient by weight of the insecticidal composition.<br>
Flowable formulations are similar to ECs, except that the active ingredient is suspended in a liquid carrier, generally water. Flowables, like ECs, may include , a small amount of a surfactant, and will typically contain active ingredients in the range of 0.5 to 95%, frequently from 10 to 50%, by weight of the composition. For application, flowables may be diluted in water or other liquid vehicle, and are normally applied as a spray to the area to be treated.<br>
Typical wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agents used in agricultural formulations include, but are not limited to, the alkyl and alkylaryl sulfonates and sulfates and their sodium salts; alkylaryl polyether alcohols; sulfated higher alcohols; polyethylene oxides; sulfonated animal and vegetable oils; sulfonated petroleum oils; fatty acid esters of polyhydric alcohols and the ethylene oxide addition products of such esters; and the addition product of long-chain mercaptans and ethylene oxide. Many other types of useful surface-active agents are available in commerce. Surface-active agents, when used, normally comprise 1 to 15% by weight of the composition.<br>
Other useful formulations include suspensions of the active ingredient in a relatively non-volatile solvent such as water, corn oil, kerosene, propylene glycol, or other suitable solvents.<br>
Still other useful formulations for insecticidal applications include simple solutions of the active ingredient in a solvent in which it is completely soluble at the desired concentration, such as acetone, alkylated naphthalenes, xylene, or other organic solvents. Granular formulations, wherein the toxicant is carried on relative coarse particles, are of particular utility for aerial distribution or for penetration of cover crop canopy. Pressurized sprays, typically aerosols wherein the active ingredient is dispersed hi finely divided form as a result of vaporization of a low-boiling dispersant solvent carrier may also be used. Water-soluble or water-dispersible granules are free flowing, non-dusty, and readily water-soluble or<br>
water-miscible. In use by the farmer on the field, the granular formulations, emulsifiable concentrates, flowable concentrates, aqueous emulsions, solutions, etc., may be diluted with water to give a concentration of active ingredient in the range of say 0.1% or 0.2% to 1.5% or 2%.<br>
The active insecticidal compounds of this invention may be formulated and/or applied with one or more second compounds. Such combinations may provide certain advantages, such as, without limitation, exhibiting synergistic effects for greater control of insect pests, reducing rates of application of insecticide thereby minimizing any impact to the environment and to worker safety, controlling a broader spectrum of insect pests, safening of crop plants to phytotoxicity, and improving tolerance by non-pest species, such as mammals and fish.<br>
Second compounds include, without limitation, other pesticides, plant growth regulators, fertilizers, soil conditioners, or other agricultural chemicals. In applying an active compound of this invention, whether formulated alone or with other agricultural chemicals, an effective amount and concentration of the active compound is of course employed; the amount may vary in the range of, e.g. about 0.001 to about 3 kg/ha, preferably about 0.03 to about 1 kg/ha. For field use, where there are losses of insecticide, higher application rates (e.g., four times the rates mentioned above) may be employed.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
The compounds of formula I useful in the present invention were tested for insecticidal activity by observing mortality in a population of cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii) on treated cotton plants caused by a test compound, when compared to like populations of cotton aphid on untreated plants. These tests were conducted in the following manner:<br>
For each rate of application of test compound, two seven-to-ten days old cotton seedlings (Gossypium hirsutiwn) grown in 7.6 cm diameter pots were selected for the test. Each test plant was infested with about 120 adult cotton aphids by placing onto each test plant cuttings of leaves from cotton plants grown in a cotton aphid colony. Once infested, the test plants were maintained for up to about 12 hours to allow complete translocation of the aphids onto the test plant. A solution comprising 1000 part per million (ppm) of each test compound was prepared by dissolving 10 milligrams of the test compound in 1 mL of acetone. Each solution was then diluted with 9 mL of a solution of 0.03 mL of polyoxyethylene(lO) isooctylphenyl ether in 100 mL of water. About 2.5 mL of solution of each test compound was needed to spray each replicate of test plant (5 mL total for each test compound). If needed, the solution of 1000 ppm of test compound was serially diluted with a solution of 10% acetone and 300 ppm of<br>
polyoxyethylene(lO) isooctylphenyl ether in water to provide solutions of each test compound for lower rates of application, for example, 300 ppm, 100 ppm, 30 ppm, or 10 ppm. Each replicate of test plant was sprayed with the solutions of test compound until run-off on both the upper and lower surfaces of the leaves. All the test plants were sprayed using a DeVilbus Atomizer Model 152 (Sunrise Medical, Carlsbad, CA) at a pressure of about 0.63-0.74 kilogram per square centimeter from a distance of about 30.5 centimeters from the test plants. For comparison purposes, a solution of a standard, such as amitraz or demethylchlordimeform (DCDM), prepared in a manner analogous to that set forth above, as well as a solution of 10% acetone and 300 ppm of polyoxyethylene(lO) isooctylphenyl ether in water containing no test compound were also sprayed onto test plants. Upon completion of spraying the solutions of test compound, the solution of standard, and the solution containing no test compound, the plants were allowed to dry. Upon completion of drying, the test plants were placed in a tray containing about 2.5 centimeters of water, where they were maintained in a growth chamber for 24 hours. After this time, each plant was assessed for percent mortality caused by the test compound when compared to the population of aphids that was infested onto the test plants prior to treatment with test compound. A test compound was designated as possessing insecticidal activity (SA) if there was 20% to 75% mortality of cotton aphid on plants sprayed with that compound. If there was 75% mortality or greater of the cotton aphid, a test compound was designated as being more insecticidally active (A). If there was 20% mortality or less of the cotton aphid, the test compound was termed as inactive (I).<br>
