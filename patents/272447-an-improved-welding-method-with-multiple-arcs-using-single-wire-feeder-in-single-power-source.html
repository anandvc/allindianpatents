				<td>TITLE: AH IMPROVE WELDING METHOD WITH MULTIPLE ARCS USING<br>
SINGLE WIRE BEEPER IN SINGLE POWER SOURCE<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an improve method for Welding with multiple arcs using<br>
single wire feeder in single power source in submerged arc welding with using<br>
two different wire feeders assembly in a single motor shaft with single Direct<br>
current constant voltage power source adaptable to panel welding, butt joint/<br>
hardfacing of different combination of filler wires using submerged arc welding<br>
applications.<br>
BACK GROUND QF THE WVEMUPM<br>
The conventional tandem submerged arc welding process essentially<br>
characterized by the use of one additional wire feeder with an Alternate Current<br>
power source, was synchronized with another Direct current constant voltage<br>
power source, wire feeder with control system for controlling the wire feed rate<br>
and delivering the two different DC/AC arcs simultaneously using two different<br>
power sources for butt joint/hard facing of different/same combination of filler<br>
wires using tandem wire submerged arc welding applications.<br>
In, "welding with multiple arcs using two wire feeders system in single wire<br>
feeder motor in single power source for submerged arc welding process", a<br>
newly designed wire feeder (R), the main wire, and an additional wire fed<br>
simultaneously using two different feeder assemblies and nozzles. The wires in<br>
the contact nozzles are arranged in parallel to the welding direction. In<br>
-2-<br><br>
conventional tandem SAW process the heat input energy was calculated by the<br>
average energy of two different DC/AC arcs. With welding with multiple arcs<br>
using two wire feeders system in single wire feeder motor in single power source<br>
for submerged arc welding technology process the two DC arcs calculated the<br>
heat input energy. It is therefore a high dilution process with approximately<br>
twice as much plates are being melted as wire. This welding with multiple arcs<br>
using two wire feeders system in single wire feeder motor in single power source<br>
for submerged arc welding technology process is one of the advanced technique<br>
make use of single power source energy available in the arc stream can increase<br>
the deposition rate as equivalent to that of conventional SAW process. Thus, the<br>
new system SAW can assure for increased transfer efficiency comparatively with<br>
other method. The multiple arc system provides 1250 A arcs. Which can be<br>
configured as DC single power source system. The advantage of the multiple arc<br>
system is the control over the phase relationship.<br>
When two welding arcs are running close together, an anormally known as warc<br>
blow0 occurs as the magnetic fields created by the high currents repel each other<br>
and actually blow molten metal out of the weld puddle. The multiple arc system<br>
has the ability to synchronize the phase relationship between multiple arcs<br>
allowing unprecedented control over arc blow. Conventional welding equipment<br>
is limited to phase relationship. This results in a highest usable melting rate for<br>
given arc energy for good penetration, nil arc blow. Thus this multiple arc<br>
system SAW technique will results in 40% increase in deposition rate and a<br>
better mechanical property is achievable over conventional submerged arc<br>
welding process. In welding with multiple arcs using two wire feeders system in<br>
-3-<br><br>
single wire feeder motor in single power source for submerged arc welding<br>
technology, for creating an additional separate weld pool is required to interface<br>
one additional wire feeder along with main wire feeder with same control<br>
system in same wire feeder motor using single Direct current constant voltage<br>
power source to attain the required chemistry and mechanical properties.<br>
An united states Patent 7166818 discloses a process development for making<br>

passing a first welding current at a first low frequency between the first<br>
electrode and the two plates, a second power supply for passing a second<br>
welding current at a second low frequency between the second electrode and<br>
the two plates, where each of the power supplies includes a three phase voltage<br>
input operated at line frequency, a rectifier to convert the input voltage to a DC<br>
voltage link and a high frequency switching type inverter converting the DC<br>
voltage link to a high frequency AC current, an output rectifier circuit to provide<br>
a positive voltage terminal and a negative voltage terminal, and an output<br>
switching network operated at a given low frequency for directing a pulsating<br>
welding current at the given low frequency from the two terminals across one of<br>
the electrodes and the plates, and a circuit for independently adjusting the given<br>
low frequency so the value of the first low frequency of the first power supply is<br>
different from the second low frequency of the second supply.<br>

about 200 amperes to at least about 1250 amperes. In accordance with the<br>
invention, the electric arc welder includes a first and second consumable<br>
electrode, which electrodes are moved in unison along a welding path between<br>
the edges of the grounded plate. Power supply from one power source is used<br>
for passing welding currents between the individual electrodes and the plates<br>
forming the grounded work piece of the welding circuit.<br>
