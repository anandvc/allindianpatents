COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(Section 10)                                     ONCE A DAY ORALLY ADMINISTERED PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
TORRENT PHARMACEUTICALS LTD., a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, of Torrent House, Off Ashram Road, Near Dinesh Hall, Ahmedabad-380 009, Gujarat, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
Field of Invention<br>
The invention relates to once a day orally administered pharmaceutical compositions comprising a proton pump inhibitor and a prokinetic agent, the proton pump inhibitor is as delayed release and the prokinetic agent is as sustained release. The invention results in reduced dosing frequency and improved patient compliance. This invention further relates to a process for preparing the dosage form. Background of the invention<br>
Proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic agents are commonly used and co-prescribed in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux diseases and various other gastrointestinal conditions including erosive esophagitis, pathological hypersecretory conditions, gastrointestinal ulcers, dyspepsia, gastroparesis, intestinal pseudo¬obstruction and post-operative ileus.<br>
Proton pump inhibitor for example, Esomeprazole, the S-isomer of Omeprazole, is the first proton pump inhibitor synthesized as an optical isomer to become available for clinical use. Esomeprazole suppresses the final step in gastric acid production by binding to two sites of the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. It provides better acid control than current racemic proton pump inhibitors (lansoprazole, pantoprazole and rabeprazole) and has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile relative to omeprazole. The duration of antisecretory effect that persists for longer than 24 hours which makes it a useful drug in peptic ulcer disease and gastroesophageal reflux disorder. The proton pump inhibitors are generally administered once a day due to their long duration of antisecretory effect.<br>
Proton pump inhibitors are, however, susceptible to degradation/transformation in acidic and neutral media. The half-life of degradation of omeprazole in water solutions at pH-values less than three is shorter than ten minutes. The degradation of omeprazole is catalyzed by acidic compounds and is stabilized in mixtures with alkaline compounds. The stability of omeprazole is also affected by moisture, heat, organic solvents and to some degree by light.<br>
In respect to the stability properties of proton pump inhibitors, it is obvious that proton pump inhibitors in an oral solid dosage form must be protected from contact with the acidic gastric juice and the active substance must be transferred in intact form<br><br><br>
     to that part of the gastrointestinal tract where pH is near neutral and where rapid absorption of proton pump inhibitors can occur.<br>
Prokinetic agent for example, mosapride, which exerts its action via 5-HT4 receptors. It enhances peristaltic efficiency thus enhancing gastrointestinal motility and gastric emptying. Thus, it is used for treating non-ulcer dyspepsia, gastroparesis, gastric stasis and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Mosapride has a bioavailability of 8% and has elimination half-life of 1.4 to 2.0 hrs (www.micromedex.com). Hence, conventional release formulation cannot maintain required plasma concentration for long time and is therefore given 3-4 times a day(Drugs of the future, 1993, 513-515). It is a safe drug. Most of the studies have reported no serious side effects of mosapride even at higher dose (Drugs Res., 1993, 867-872 J Pharmacol Expt ther, 1997,220-227). Mosapride is a selective 5-HT4 receptor agonist and does not interact with other receptor types. It has a very favorable tolerability profile, with only minor adverse effects such as headache. Unlike other prokinetic agents, mosapride does not cause extrapyramidal symptoms or endocrine disorders. Although, there were rare reports of mosapride associated with QT interval prolongation, the reported incidences occurred when mosapride was used with other pro-arrhythmic drugs. Prior Art<br>
WO 97/25065 discloses the oral pharmaceutical dosage forms comprising a proton pump inhibitor and a prokinetic agent. Various examples of dosage forms are given in which the proton pump inhibitor is in the form of delayed release and the prokinetic agent is in the form of immediate release.<br>
The persons skilled in the art would appreciate that even though the unit dosage having said combination as per WO 97/25065 is given to a patient, the real purpose of combination as mentioned in the said patent will not be served. The said patent, though indicates (line no. 12 to 19) that "administration of two, three or even more different tablets to the patient is not convenient or satisfactory to achieve the most optimal results", the number of tablets that has to be given based on the said patent are more than one, for the simple reason that the pro-kinetic agent in the formulation is in conventional form. The pro-kinetic agent, for example, mosapride has elimination half-life of 1.4 to 2 hours. Hence, the unit dosage given to the patient will not be sufficient for once a day regimen i.e. mosapride has to be given to the patient for two times even after the original unit dosage.   Thus, the patient at the end of the day would have to<br><br>
    take three tablets (first of unit dosage, second of conventional mosapride and third again for conventional mosapride).<br>
WO 99/51583 discloses methods and compositions using (+) norcisapride in combination with proton pump inhibitors or H2 receptor antagonists. The invention specifically gives examples of combination of immediate release (+) norcisapride and a proton pump inhibitors or H2 receptor antagonist. As discussed above it also does not disclose the method to manufacture the dosage form in which the prokinetic agent is in the form of modified release. Merely specifying that the modified release formulation of (+) norcisapride can be manufactured as per the prior art can not result in an effective modified release formulation.<br>
WO 99/51584 discloses methods and compositions using (-) norcisapride in combination with proton pump inhibitors or H2 receptor antagonists. The invention specifically give examples of combination of immediate release (-) norcisapride and a proton pump inhibitors or H2 receptor antagonist. As discussed above it also does not disclose the method to manufacture the dosage form in which the prokinetic agent is in the form of modified release. Merely specifying that the modified release formulation of (-) norcisapride can be manufactured as per the prior art can not result in an effective modified release formulation.<br>
European patent EP 1060743 Al discloses oral cisapride dosage forms with an extended action. It further discloses the method to enhance the solubility of cisapride at above neutral pH in order to make bioavailable systems which, can provide efficient plasma levels of cisapride over 24 hours. The invention does not disclose use of other prokinetic agents or their combination with proton pump inhibitors.<br>
WO 96/29055 teaches about pectin based pharmaceutical compositions used for the prevention of gastric reflux. It forms a stable gel raft in the gastric environment. It may further contain one or more agents selected from antacids, antibiotics, anti-emetic, proton pump inhibitors, etc.<br>
WO 99/51209 teaches the art of making press coated pulsatile release formulations. The formulation first provides a substantially first order delivery of active ingredient followed by pulsed.deliver of an increased amount of the active ingredient.<br>
Patent application 2001/0051185 Al dicloses an osmotic pump containing controlled release ranitidine in the core. The formulation also contains a prokinetic agent, which is in the form of rapid release and at least 75% of the prokinetic agent is<br><br>
     released within one hour. Therefore the formulation may not maintain the effective plasma concentration of the prokinetic agents having short half life for a period of 24 hours if given once daily.<br>
WO 98/29095 discloses a sustained release cisapride oral dosage form suitable  once daily administration. The formulation comprises plurality of mini tablets<br>
containing organic acid. The release of cisapride through mini tablets is dependent on<br>
the pH of the aqueous environment.<br>
Prior art discloses many different types of dosage forms containing proton<br>
pump inhibitor and prokinetic agent in unit dosage form. There are no examples<br>
describing any compositions which contains combination of a proton pump inhibitor in<br>
the form of delayed release and a prokinetic agent in the form of sustained release, and<br>
the dosage form maintains the plasma concentration for the period of 24 hours so that it<br>
can be administered once a day. Thus, there exists a need for once a day orally<br>
administered pharmaceutical compositions comprising a proton pump inhibitor and a<br>
prokinetic agent, the proton pump inhibitor is as delayed release and the prokinetic<br>
agent is as sustained release, and the formulation with improved patient compliance<br>
Considering the above aspects, a sustained release formulation of prokinetic<br>
agent for example, mosapride would be of great use. The potential advantages of<br>
sustained release mosapride over conventional mosapride are as follows<br>
        *  Increased patient compliance because of less frequent drug administration.<br>
       *  The sustained therapeutic plasma levels with this formulation would be<br>
maintained for 24 hours.  This would make the drug  administration meal<br>
independent and would also prevent the regurgitation (GERD) even during sleep.<br>
The proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic agents are frequently co-prescribed in the management of GERD and other gastrointestinal conditions mentioned above.<br>
Prokinetic agents prevent reflux, while, proton pump inhibitors reduce acid secretion. Thus, the combination has complementary action in abating the symptomatology and in controlling the acid-pepsin and motility related diseases. The combination of a proton pump inhibitor and a prokinetic agent, where the proton pump inhibitor is as delayed release and the prokinetic agent is as sustained release will provide following advantages over the available dosage forms: *        Similar duration of action of proton pump inhibitor and sustained release<br>
prokinetic agent.<br><br>
*       Ease  of administration and better compliance  because  of single  daily<br>
administration.<br>
*    Effective in controlling nocturnal esophageal reflux due to prolonged duration<br>
of action. *    No overlap in adverse drug reactions. The combination will have the lower possible daily therapeutic dose of the respective drugs, which makes it less vulnerable to cause any sorts of side effects. *    No Adverse drug interaction.<br>
Combining two active ingredients in one pharmaceutical unit to improve patient compliance is known in literature. It can be either in the form of two or more active ingredients in immediate release form or a combination of immediate release, delayed release and sustained release form. There are various techniques by which the combination of delayed release and sustained release is formulated in single dosage form but this does not always lead to an effective dosage form. It is known to the person skilled in the art that the various factors like type of dosage form, in vitro release profile and in vivo parameters are very important to make a dosage form effective.<br>
Accordingly, a need exists for once a day orally administered pharmaceutical compositions comprising a proton pump inhibitor and a prokinetic agent, the proton pump inhibitor is as delayed release and the prokinetic agent is as sustained release. The invention results in a dosage form, which is effective, reduces dosing frequency and improves patient compliance. Further, the dosage form should be simple and economical to produce. Objects of the invention<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a once a day orally administered pharmaceutical compositions comprising a proton pump inhibitor and a prokinetic agent, wherein the proton pump inhibitor is as delayed release and the prokinetic agent is as sustained release.<br>
Another object of the present invention is a dosage form, which is suitable for swallowing for humans containing two active ingredients one of which is in delayed release form and other in sustained release form.<br>
Furthermore, the formulations according to the invention provide a further significant advantage with respect to tablet or simple capsule.   People who need to<br><br>
swallow a tablet or a capsule under the above mentioned conditions may sometimes have to swallow the said tablet or capsule without water and that can be dangerous as the tablet or capsule can get into trachea i.e. respiratory side.<br>
Further object of the invention is to provide independent sustained release formulation of pro-kinetic agent.<br>
It is yet another object of present invention to provide a once a day orally administered pharmaceutical compositions comprising a proton pump inhibitor and a prokinetic agent, which can provide an improved pharmacokinetic profile. An improved pharmacokinetic profile here means that the formulation will provide a more constant blood level of drug and will show less fluctuation between the maximum and minimum plasma drug concentration than once or repeated doses of regular / immediate release drug formulation containing equal amounts of active ingredients administered per day.<br>
A further objective of the present invention is a formulation, which gives accurate dosing and is prepared by simple processes. Summary of the invention<br>
The above and other objects of the present invention are acheived by providing a once a day orally administered pharmaceutical compositions comprising a proton pump inhibitor and a prokinetic agent, which can provide an improved pharmacokinetic profile. An improved pharmacokinetic profile here means that the formulation will provide a more constant blood level of drug and will show less fluctuation between the maximum and minimum plasma drug concentration than once or repeated doses of regular/immediate release drug formulation containing equal amounts of active ingredients administered per day.<br>
Formulations according to the aspect of the present invention are particularly useful in administration of medications to individuals who cannot or will not chew or swallow, such as debilitated patients, patients who have difficulty swallowing solids, and elderly. Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
"Sustained release" refers to the release of an agent such as a drug from a composition or dosage form in which the agent is released according to a desired profile over an extended period of time. Sustained release profiles include, for example, controlled release, prolonged release, pulsatile release, and delayed release<br><br>
profiles. In contrast to immediate release compositions, controlled release compositions allow delivery of an agent to a subject over an extended period of time according to predetermined profile. Such release rates can provide therapeutically effective levels of agent for an extended period of time and thereby provide a longer period of pharmacological or diagnostic response as compared to conventional rapid release dosage forms. Such longer periods of response provide for many inherent benefits that are not achieved with the corresponding short acting, immediate release preparations. For example, in the treatment of chronic pain, controlled release formulations are often highly preferred over conventional short-acting formulations.<br>
Sustained release pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms are designed to improve the delivery profile of agents, such as drugs, medicaments, active agents, diagnostic agents, or any substance to be internally administered to an animal, including humans. A sustained release composition is typically used to improve the effects of administered substances by optimizing the kinetics of delivery, thereby increasing bio-availability, convenience, and patient compliance, as well as minimizing side effects associated with inappropriate immediate release rates such as a high initial release rate and, if undesired, uneven blood or tissue levels.<br>
The term "immediate release" as used herein in relation to the composition according to the invention or used in any other context means release which is not modified release and releases more than 70% of the antidiabetic active ingredient within 60 minutes. The term "immediate release dosage form" as used herein can be described as dosage form which allows the drug to dissolve in the gastrointestinal contents, with no intention of delaying or prolonging the dissolution or absorption of the drug (as per US FDA guideline for 'SUPAC-MR: Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms').<br>
The term "dosage form" denotes any form of the formulation that contains an amount sufficient to achieve a therapeutic effect with a single administration.<br>
"Delayed release" refers to restricted dissolution of the active ingredient from the dosage form in the stomach but not in intestine, there by allowing dosage form transit through stomach and drug dissolution and absorption from the intestines. The delayed release is obtained by enteric coating. The enteric coating is employed in case if the drug is destroyed by gastric acid, is irritating to gastric mucosa or when by pass of stomach enhances drug absorption from intestine to a significant extent.<br><br>
The term "enteric coat / polymeric coat" is defined for the purpose of the present invention as a coat with substance which is insoluble at a pH value of less than 4.5 and is soluble at a pH value of greater than 5.5.<br>
"Proton pump inhibitors" refers to any agent or compound that inhibits or suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibition of H+ -K+ ATPase enzyme system at the secretary surface of gastric parietal cells.<br>
"Prokinetic agents" refers to active ingredients which effectively increases esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, increases gastric motility and peristalsis, enhances gastroduodenal co-ordination and consequently facilitates gastric emptying and decreases small bowl transit time.<br>
The term "swallowing" as used herein is essentially synonymous with "ingestion". The pharmaceutical compositions of the instant invention can be in the form of a tablet, a capsule, a multiparticulate form, or a unit dose packet (sometimes referred to in the art as a "sachet").<br>
The term "tablet" is intended to embrace compressed conventional tablets, coated tablets, multiparticulate tablet, matrix tablets, bilayered tablets, multilayered tablets, tablet-in-tablet, inlay tablets, and other forms known in the art. The representative examples of some of these formulations are shown in figures 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.<br>
The term "capsule" is intended to embrace capsules in which the body of the capsule disintegrates after ingestion to release particulate contents. The capsule may contain particles or tablets of two or more types or combinations thereof. The representative examples of some of these formulations are shown in figures 1,2, 3 and 9.<br>
The term "multiparticulate" is intended to embrace a dosage form comprising a multiplicity of particles whose totality represents the intended therapeutically useful dose of proton pump inhibitor and prokinetic agent. The particles generally are of a diameter from about 100 microns to about 0.3 cm, with a preferred range of 150 microns to 1.5 mm. The use of these and other terms is more fully set out below. Multiparticulates represent a preferred embodiment for sustained-release because they are particularly useful in administration of medications to individuals who cannot or will not chew or swallow, such as debilitated patients, patients who have difficulty swallowing solids. These can be taken without water or can be dispersed in water for<br><br>
the convenience of the patients. A multiparticulate can have numerous formulation applications. For example, a multiparticulate may be used as a powder for filling a capsule shell, or used per se for mixing with food (e.g., ice cream) to increase palatability.<br>
In a further aspect, this invention provides a process for preparing dosage forms comprising a proton pump inhibitor and a prokinetic agent, the proton pump inhibitor is as delayed release and the prokinetic agent is as sustained release.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of unit dosage form can be prepared, but not restricted, in following steps: Step-1: Preparation of proton pump inhibitor part. Step-2: Preparation of prokinetic agent part.<br>
Step-3: Preparation of unit dosage while combining the	product obtained<br>
by step-1 and step-2.<br>
Prokinetic Agent Part: The prokinetic agent part of this invention is in the form of sustained release. The sustained release of the prokinetic agent can be achieved through various classes of dosage forms. For purposes of discussion, not limitation, the many embodiments hereunder can be grouped into classes according to design and principle of operation viz:<br>
(a)	prokinetic agent is embedded or dispersed in a matrix<br>
(b)	bilayered matrix tablet<br>
(c)	core coated with rate controlling membrane(s)<br>
A first class includes matrix tablet, in which the prokinetic agent is embedded or dispersed in a matrix of another material that serves to retard the release of prokinetic agent into an aqueous environment (i.e., the lumenal fluid of the GI tract). When prokinetic agent is dispersed in a matrix of this sort, release of the drug takes place principally from the surface of the matrix. Thus the drug is released from the surface of a device which incorporates the matrix after it diffuses through the matrix or when the surface of the device erodes, exposing the drug. In some embodiments, both mechanisms can operate simultaneously. The matrix system can be hydrophilic or hydrophobic.<br>
The preferred embodiment of a matrix system has the form of a hydrophilic matrix tablet comprising prokinetic agent and an amount of hydrophilic polymer sufficient to provide a useful degree of control over the prokinetic agent dissolution.<br><br>
Hydrophilic polymers useful for forming the matrix include hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), poly (ethylene oxide), polyvinyl alcohol), xanthan gum, carbomer, carrageenan, carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium alginate or mixture of components selected from these. A preferred material is HPMC. Other similar hydrophilic polymers may also be employed. In use, the hydrophilic material is swollen by, and eventually dissolves, in water. The prokinetic agent is released both by diffusion from the matrix and by erosion of the matrix. The prokinetic agent dissolution rate of these hydrophilic matrix tablets may be controlled by the amount and molecular weight of hydrophilic polymer employed. In general, using a greater amount of the hydrophilic polymer decreases the dissolution rate, as does using a higher molecular weight polymer. Using a lower molecular weight polymer increases the dissolution rate. The dissolution rate may also be controlled by the use of water-soluble additives such as sugars, salts, or soluble polymers. Examples of these additives are sugars such as lactose, sucrose, or mannitol, salts such as NaCl, KC1, NaHC03, and water soluble polymers such as PVP, low molecular weight HPC or HMPC or methyl cellulose. In general, increasing the fraction of soluble material in the formulation increases the release rate. A matrix tablet typically comprises about 1 to 95% by weight of prokinetic agent and about 99 to 5% by weight of polymer.<br>
The matrix tablet can also include one or more commonly used excipients in oral pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
Representative commonly used excipients in oral pharmaceutical formulations include povidone, starch, talc, fumed silica, glyceryl monostearate, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, kaolin, colloidal silica, gypsum, Polysorbate 80 (Tween 80), micronised silica and magnesium trisilicate.<br>
The quantity of commonly used excipients in oral pharmaceutical formulations used is from about 0.1% to about 10% by weight, preferably from 0.25 to 7.5%. based on the total weight of the formulation.<br>
A preferred matrix tablet comprises, by weight, about 2.5% to about 50% prokinetic agent, about 10% to about 75% HPMC, 2.5% to about 75% lactose, 0.5% to about 10% PVP, 0.25% to about 5% talc, 0.25% to about 2% colloidal silicon dioxide and about 0.25% to about 2% magnesium stearate.<br>
The granules of the matrix formulation can be manufactured in accordance with usual granulation techniques in which the prokinetic agent and other excipients are<br><br>
mixed and granulated by adding solution of binder in a low or high shear mixer or by fluidized bed granulation. The granulate is dried, preferably in a fluidized bed dryer. The dried granulate is sieved and mixed with lubricants and disintegrants. Alternatively the manufacture of granules of matrix formulation can be made by direct mixing of the directly compressible excipients or by roller compaction. The granules can be compressed into tablets using conventional tablet compression machine using specified toolings.<br>
A wide variety of prokinetic agents may be used in combination with a suitable proton pump inhibitor in the fixed unit dosage form according to the present invention. Such prokinetic agents include, for example, cisapride, dazopride, mosapride, exepanol, lintopride, motilin, idremcinal, mitemcinalum, neurotrophin-3, KC-11458, MKC-733, Braintree-851, zacopride, ecabapide, prucalopride, fedotozine, cinitapride, itopride, polycarbophil, tegaserod, INKP-100, diacol, metoclopramide and domperidone. A preferable prokinetic agent for the new fixed dosage form is mosapride or domperidone. Such suitable prokinetic agents are described in EP 0 243 959 and EP 0 076 530, the disclosures of which are each incorporated herein by express reference thereto.<br>
The second class of formulation includes a bilayered matrix tablet, in which an immediate release layer containing prokinetic agent is compressed with matrix formulation described above. The immediate release layer releases the prokinetic agent immediately and helps in achieving initial high drug levels in plasma, the layer formed by matrix formulation releases prokinetic agent at predetermined rate for extended duration. A bilayered matrix tablet typically comprises about 0 to 50 % by weight of total prokinetic agent in immediate release layer and about 100 to 50% by weight of total prokinetic agent in sustained release layer, preferably about 5 to 45 % by weight of total prokinetic agent in immediate release layer and about 95 to 55% by weight of total prokinetic agent in sustained release layer and more preferably about 10 to 40 % by weight of total prokinetic agent in immediate release layer and about 90 to 60% by weight of total prokinetic agent in sustained release layer..<br>
The immediate release layer of the bilayered matrix tablet comprises prokinetic agent and auxiliary excipients such as diluents, binders, lubricants, surfactants, disintegrants, plasticisers, anti-tack agents, opacifying agents, pigments, and such like.<br><br>

Proton Pump Inhibitor Part: The proton pump inhibitor part of this invention is in the form of delayed release. The delayed release of the proton pump inhibitor can be achieved through various classes of dosage forms. For purposes of discussion, not limitation, the many embodiments hereunder can be grouped into classes according to design and principle of operation viz:<br>
(a)	multiparticulate system<br>
(b)	enteric coated tablet<br>
A first class includes multiparticulate system, in which proton pump inhibitor is in the form of enteric coated particles.<br>

The proton pump inhibitor is mixed with pharmaceutical constituents to obtain preferred handling and processing properties and a suitable concentration of the active substance in the final mixture. Pharmaceutical constituents such as fillers, binders,<br><br>
lubricants, disintegrating agents, surfactants and other pharmaceutically acceptable additives, can be used.<br>
The proton pump inhibitor may also be mixed with an alkaline pharmaceutically acceptable substance(s). Such substances can be chosen among, but are not restricted to, substances such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and aluminium salts of phosphoric acid, carbonic acid, citric acid or other suitable weak inorganic or organic acids; aluminium hydroxide/sodium bicarbonate coprecipitate, substances normally used in antacid preparations such as aluminium, calcium and magnesium hydroxides; magnesium oxide or composite substances, such as disodium hydrogen orthophosphate and similar compounds; organic pH-buffering substances such as trihydroxymethylaminomethane, basic amino acids and their salts or other similar, pharmaceutically acceptable pH-buffering substances.<br>
The core material is coated with a barrier layer comprising pharmaceutical excipients optionally including alkaline compounds such as for instance pH-buffering compounds. This barrier layer separates the core material from the outer layer(s), the outer layer(s) being enteric coating layer(s).<br>
The barrier layer can be applied to the core material by coating or layering procedures in suitable equipments such as coating pan, coating granulator or in a fluidized bed apparatus using water and/or organic solvents for the coating process. As an alternative the separating layer can be applied to the core material by using powder coating technique. The materials for separating layers are pharmaceutically acceptable compounds such as, for instance, sugar, polyethylene glycol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose sodium and others, used alone or in mixtures. Additives such as plasticizers, colorants, pigments, fillers, anti-tacking and anti-static agents, such as for instance magnesium stearate, titanium dioxide, talc and other additives may also be included into the separating layer.<br>
One or more enteric coating layers are applied onto the core material covered with separating layer by using a suitable coating technique. The enteric coating layer material may be dispersed or dissolved in either water or in suitable organic solvents. As enteric coating layer polymers one or more, separately or in combination, of the following can be used; e.g. solutions or dispersions of methacrylic acid copolymers,<br><br>
cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate trimellitate, carboxymethylethylcellulose, shellac or other suitable enteric coating layer polymer(s).<br>
The enteric coating layers contain pharmaceutically acceptable plasticizers to obtain the desired mechanical properties, such as flexibility and hardness of the enteric coating layers. Such plasticizers are for instance, but not restricted to, triacetin, citric acid esters, phthalic acid esters, dibutyl sebacate, cetyl alcohol, polyethylene glycols, polysorbates or other plasticizers.<br>

Particles covered with enteric coating layer(s) may further be covered with one or more over-coating layer(s). The over-coating layer(s) can be applied to the enteric coating layered pellets by coating or layering procedures in suitable equipment such as coating pan, coating granulator or in a fluidized bed apparatus using water and/or organic solvents for the coating or layering process. The materials for over-coating layers are chosen among pharmaceutically acceptable compounds such as, for instance sugar, polyethylene glycol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose sodium and others, used alone or in mixtures. Additives such as plasticizers, colorants, pigments, fillers, anti-tacking and anti-static agents, such as for instance magnesium stearate, titanium dioxide, talc and other additives may also be included into the over-coating layer(s). Said over-coating layer may further prevent potential agglomeration of enteric coating layered pellets, further protect the enteric coating layer towards cracking during the compaction process and enhance the tableting process. The maximum thickness of the applied over-coating layer(s) is normally only limited by processing conditions.<br>
The second class includes enteric coated tablet, in which the granules of proton pump inhibitor are prepared and the granules are compressed to tablets. The tablets of proton pump inhibitor are coated with barrier coat followed by enteric coating.<br><br>
