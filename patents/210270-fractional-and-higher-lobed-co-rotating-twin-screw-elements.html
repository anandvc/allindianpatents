FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
This invention relates to the field of extrusion technology. In particular this invention pertains to extruders. Further, this invention relates to novel twin-screw extruders, which contain novel fractional elements. More particularly, this invention relates to a fractional and higher lobed co-rotating twin-screw elements. This application is also related to the process of manufacture described in copending patent application no. 669/MAS/1999<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Twin-screw extruders are known in the art. A number of varieties of such twin-screw extruders have been patented. Scanning through patent literature pertaining to twin-screw extruders, it has been found that the following patent specifications are of relevance to this invention. The cited documents and detailed description of prior art in respect of twin-screw extruders are enumerated as under.<br>
References have been made to the following patent specifications and the merit and demerit of these inventions are described in the following paragraphs.<br>
US Patent Number 4,824,256 US Patent Number 4,131,371 European Patent No.0037984<br>
As known in the art, co-rotating twin-screw extruders have a long barrel (a.k.a. casing or housing) with two parallel bores that intersect each other. Two parallel shafts that are both driven in the same direction without any slip are placed in the bores. Processing segments are mounted one after another in a continuous chain on the shaft that transmits the rotary motion without slippage to the segments. The twin-screw extruder segments (a.k.a. compounding elements) consist of kneading<br><br>
elements (a.k.a. kneading disks or kneading blocks), conveying elements (a.k.a. screws or screw elements), mixing elements and other special elements. These carry out the various tasks of mixing, dispersing, kneading, blending, conveying, devolatising and metering of material that are fed in the extruder. Each element on one shaft while maintaining continuity with the adjacent elements on the same shaft has a corresponding conjugate element in the perpendicular direction on the other shaft. The characteristic of the elements is that of conjugacy (similar to two intermeshing counter-rotating gears). They virtually wipe each other as they rotate in the same direction.<br>
The tip-angle is a critical component in the design of twin-screw extruders. The tip-angle for the known fully wiping co-rotating elements is given by the following equation (1)<br>
  (1) where<br>
T        -	Tip angle<br>
'n'       -	Number of lobes (or) flights (or) starts<br>
V        -	Adjusted Center distance to Barrel Diameter ratio<br>
and<br>
  (2)<br>
where<br>
'c'	-	Distance   between   the   center  of  the  two   bores   (Center<br>
Distance)<br>
'b*	-	Diameter of the bores (Barrel Diameter)<br>
'5c'	-	Planned clearance (or) gap between the elements<br><br>
'8b'     -	Planned  clearance  (or)  gap  between  the  barrel  and  the<br>
element<br>
Note 8c and 8b are typically small values.<br>
It is evident that if the following condition (3) is satisfied, a lobe with a tip angle greater than zero can be formed.<br>
  (3)<br>
The ratio of the center distance to the barrel diameter therefore controls the maximum number of lobes that are possible in the extruder with acceptable tip angle. An extruder constructed with a ratio closer to 1 can have many lobes with non-zero tip angle. Typical extruders have only two lobes (V = -0.8) or three lobes (V =-0.9). The end geometry has rotational symmetry with respect to the number of lobes. Higher number of lobes results in a smaller tip angle in the element. The surface of the various elements is obtained by cylindrical or helical transformation of the end geometry.<br>
A smaller Y is preferred due to better efficiencies in the operation in terms of power consumption and output rates. However, the reduction in number of lobes leads to lower plasticising capacity in the kneading zone of the extruder for certain applications. U.S Patent Number 4,824,256 discloses new kneading elements, retaining the known geometry of twin-screw elements, designed with more number of lobes for an extruder that has a smaller 'r\ This is achieved by using in the design a barrel diameter that is smaller than the actual barrel diameter until an acceptable V (greater that 0.866 for three lobes) is achieved. The element so designed with more lobes is then mounted in an eccentric manner with respect to the center of the shaft. A group of such disks one after the other at a specific angle to one another forms a kneading element. These elements continue to be conjugate and are fully-wiping in nature.<br><br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
The hitherto known twin-screw elements have equal tip angles for all lobes. These limit the flexibility in designing the different type of elements that work in a twin-screw extruder. For example, the small tip angle in the eccentric tri-lobed kneading element leads to higher wear rate as only one of the tips operates closer to the barrel wall. Increasing the tip-angle would reduce the free volume available in the extruder. Further more, increasing tip-angle also makes the element become close to a circular shape. It is known from European Patent Specification No. 0037984 that an eccentric disk with a circular cross-section can be used. Such an element can be classified as zero lobed. However, the desired plasticising action reduces with increased circularity and therefore increase in tip angle is not preferred.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Salient features of the present invention are that the known element geometry allows for constant tip angle for all elements. A new class of elements herein called fractional elements has been invented. The characteristic of these elements is that they can have different tip angles. The tip angle is a critical component in the design of extruders. These novel elements work as conjugate pairs while satisfying the needs of twin-screw extruders. The fractional elements are suitable for processes such as mixing, dispersing, alloying, blending, plasticising, kneading, devolatising and metering of the material.<br>
The present invention tackles the limitations of the prior art in the following manner. The known element geometry allows for constant tip angle for all elements. A new class of elements called fractional elements have been invented that can have different tip angles. These elements continue to work as conjugate<br><br>
pairs while satisfying the needs of twin-screw extrusion.<br>
The primary object of this invention is to invent co-rotating twin-screw extruders with new element geometry that can provide a greater flexibility in design of individual elements. The end geometry of known elements is limited by constant tip angle for all lobes. The known end geometry are limited to just a few possibilities for a given center distance to barrel diameter ratio 'rA further object of the invention is to design and develop a novel twin-screw extruder, which contains novel fractional elements.<br>
Another object of invention is to invent a novel twin-screw extruder, which has greater flexibility in design of individual components.<br>
Another object of the invention is to invent a novel twin-screw extruder for achieving a perfect transition by ensuring that for each cross-section of the element on one shaft there exists a conjugate cross-section on the corresponding shaft that is fully wiping.<br>
A twin-screw extruder having elements for processing thermoplastic, thermoset and other material, embodies a barrel with two parallel intersecting bores, two sets of co-rotating fully intermeshed extruder elements that are linked to each other in a non rotary manner forming a continuous chain, each operating in one of the bores, each screw being provided with multi-lobed elements that have geometry such that the tip angles are different for some of the lobes that range from two to infinity and these geometry are transformed in a cylindrical or helical manner with or without interruption to form various types of fractional elements for various operations defined in the specification.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention comprises a twin screw extruder comprising;<br><br>
a.	a barrel defining a first cylindrical bore and a second cylindrical bore,<br>
wherein the first cylindrical bore and second cylindrical bore<br>
intersect to form a chamber,<br>
b.	a first shaft that rotates within the first bore about an axis;<br>
c.	a second shaft that rotates within the second bore about an axis;<br>
and<br>
d.	a first set of fractional elements coupled to the first shaft and a<br>
second set of fractional elements coupled to the second shaft, each<br>
set having a first fractional element with a first lobe defining a first tip<br>
angle, a second lobe defining a second tip angle, and a third lobe<br>
defining a third tip angle that is different from the first tip angle and<br>
the second tip angle.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further comprises a fractional element for a twin screw extruder, comprising a first lobe defining a first tip angle, a second lobe defining a second tip angle, and a third lobe defining a third tip angle that is different from the first tip angle and the second tip angle and further comprising a fourth lobe defining fourth tip angle.<br>
To summarize, the twin-screw extruder of the present invention is a novel extruder which is unique in its constructional features by which the problems associated in the prior art are eliminated.<br>
Accordingly a co-rotating twin screw extruder according to the present invention can provide a greater flexibility in design of individual elements for the improved process of extrusion characterized In that the said extruder does not define any limitation of lobes to be present in the extruder by introduction of new class elements referred herein as fractional elements and transitional elements that can have different tip angles wherein these elements continue to work as conjugate pairs while satisfying the needs of twin screw extrusion.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art on how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The processing section of a twin-screw extruder shown in FIGURE 2 has segmented barrels 'B' and extruder elements 'E' [primarily conveying elements 'E(C)' and kneading elements 'E(K)']. A view of the extruder from the front shows tri-lobed elements located inside the intersecting parallel bores in FIGURE 1.<br>
The number of lobes that can be designed in an extruder depends on the center distance to barrel diameter ratio V. The fn=2' lobed geometry shown in FIGURE 3<br><br>
confirms to an Y of 0.8. The clearance 8c and 8b are also shown in the enlarged inset. The lobes are numbered 1 and 2. The rotated view shows that the end geometry is such that one element tip wipes the other element at point P. A three-lobed geometry is shown in Figure 4 along with a rotated view in Figure 6. The ratio Y for this geometry is 0.9.<br>
The eccentric tri-lobed shown in FIGURE 7 is discussed in US Patent Number 4824256. The tip angle ti is constant across all the lobes of this geometry. FIGURE 9 shows a rotated position of FIGURE 7.<br>
The end geometry with unequal tip angle V and V shown in FIGURE 8 is that of one of the fractional elements invented. The fractional element classified as 1.3.80 means that it is formed as a transition of a single-lobed and a tri-lobed geometry and the new geometry is one closer to the tri-lobed. FIGURE 10 shows a rotated position.<br>
FIGURE 11 is the end geometry of a fractional element. The geometry is classified as 2.4.50. It is formed by a transition of a two-lobed and four-lobed element. The geometry is at a section that is half way through the transition. FIGURE 12 is the end geometry classified as 1.2.50. This is half way between a uni-lobed and a bi-lobed element.<br>
FIGURE 13 shows clearly the basis for the classification. The last fraction provides the location of the transition between the uni-lobed and bi-lobed element. The Figure shows clearly the types of transition namely, the M type, T type and F type transition. These three types of transitions covers all possibilities of transitions. It may be noted that all three types of transitions are not necessary to generate fractional geometry. The geometry in FIGURE 8 has only M type and T type of transition.<br><br>
FIGURE 14 shows a pair of co-rotating bi-lobed conveying screw element with known geometry formed by helical transformation of the end geometry. The lines show the path of the transformation.<br>
FIGURE 15 shows a pair of co-rotating bi-lobed kneading block with known geometry formed by cylindrical and intermittent rotary transformation of the end geometry.<br>
As stated above, the objective of the invention is to provide co-rotating twin-screw extruders with new element geometry that can provide a greater flexibility in design of individual elements. The end geometry of known elements is limited by constant tip angle for all lobes. The known end geometry are limited to just a few possibilities for a given center distance to barrel diameter ratio 'rConsider an element, as in FIGURE 13, such that ends have different geometry (i.e. different number of lobes). Consider that the geometry of the element is continuously transforming from one end to the other. For any given ration V, if an ln' lobed element is possible with a non-zero tip angle, then 1 to n-1 lobes are also possible. A perfect transition is one where at each cross-section of the element on one shaft there exists a conjugate cross-section on the corresponding shaft that is fully wiping.<br>
If 'n' is the number of lobes on one end with less lobes and 'N' is the number of lobes on the other end with more lobes, then the condition for a perfect transition is that 'N/n' should be a whole number. In such an event, every intermediate section can give rise to a new element with unequal tip angle, a fractional element. There are only three types of transitions in these circumstances. These can be classified as<br>
1.	M type transition<br>
2.	T type transition<br>
3.	F type transition<br><br>
The exact nature of the mathematics involved in these transitions is truly complex compared to the simple known geometry used in twin-screw extruders. It is the application of computers and use of analytical tools in both design and manufacture that makes it possible to define the mathematics behind these complex elements and use kinematic transformations such as cylindrical or helical to generate the individual elements.<br>
A twin screw extruder according to the present invention comprises a barrel defining a first cylindrical bore and a second cylindrical bore, wherein the first cylindrical bore and second cylindrical bore intersect to form a chamber, a first shaft that rotates within the first bore about an axis; a second shaft that rotates within the second bore about an axis; and a first set of fractional elements coupled to the first shaft and a second set of fractional elements coupled to the second shaft, each set having a first fractional element with a first lobe defining a first tip angle, a second lobe defining a second tip angle, and a third lobe defining a third tip angle that is different from the first tip angle and the second tip angle.<br>
Also the first fractional element of the first set and the first fractional element of the second set each have a fourth lobe defining a fourth tip angle. The first fractional element of the first set and the first fractional element of the second set maintain a constant minimum clearance between each other when rotating in the same direction. Further it is possible to have second fractional elements can be coupled with the first set of fractional elements. The first fractional elements of any set are in turn coupled eccentric to the shaft. Generally shafts rotate in the same direction for better wiping.<br>
As shown in the accompanying Figures, the geometry of the first fractional elements can be transformed either helically or cylindrically. Further the transitional element is coupled to shaft wherein the first transitional element is coupled to first shaft and the second transitional element is coupled to the second shaft and so on. The cross sectional geometry of the transitional element differs<br><br>
from one end to other end. Care is being taken that one of the cross sectional geometries of the second transitional element substantially matches a cross sectional geometry of the first fractional element of the first set. A minimum clearance preferably a constant gap is maintained between the first and second transitional elements when both are rotating in the same direction.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted below.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br><br><br><br>
