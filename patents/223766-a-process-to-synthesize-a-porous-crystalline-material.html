				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROCESS TO SYNTHESIZE A<br>
porous crystalline material  (ITO-21) AND THE METHOD  OF<br>
OBTAINING-THE SAME  IN THE  ABSENCE  OF FLUORIDE  IONS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention belongs to the field of porous<br>
crystalline materials and particularly to zeolitic<br>
materials. More particularly, the invention fits in the<br>
sector of zeolitic materials useful as catalysts or<br>
components__of catalysts in processes of conversion of<br>
feedstock formed by organic compounds, such as catalytic<br>
cracking processes of hydrocarbons, catalytic<br>
hydrocracking of hydrocarbons, alkylation of aromatic<br>
olefins and in esterification processes, alkylation of<br>
aromatics with olefins and in esterification processes,<br>
acylation, reaction of aniline with formaldehyde in its<br>
acid form and/or exchanged with suitable cations.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Zeolites are porous crystalline aluminosilicates<br>
that have found important uses such as catalysts,<br>
adsorbing agents and ionic exchangers. Many of these<br>
zeolitic materials have well defined structures that form<br>
channels and cavities inside of a uniform size and shape<br>
that permit adsorption of certain molecules, whereas they<br>
prevent from passing inside the crystal other molecules<br>
that are too big from spreading through the pores. This<br>
characteristic gives these materials properties of<br>
molecular sieve. These molecular sieves can include Si<br>
and other elements of the group IIIA of the periodic<br>
table in the lattice, all of them tetrahedrally<br>
coordinated. The tetrahedron are bonded by their<br>
vertexes by oxygen atoms forming a three-dimensional<br>
lattice.  The negative charge generated by the elements<br>
of the IIIA group tetrahedrally coordinated in lattice<br>
positions is compensated by the presence of cations, such<br>
as for example, alkaline or alkaline earth cations, in<br>
the crystal. A type of cation may be totally or<br>
partially exchanged by another type of cation by means of<br>
ionic exchange techniques, being thus possible to vary<br>
the properties of a given silicate by selecting the<br>
desired cations.<br>
Many zeolites have been synthesized in the presence<br>
of an organic molecule that acts as a structure directing<br>
agent (SDA). The organic molecules that act as structure<br>
directing agents (SDA) generally contain nitrogen in<br>
their composition and can give rise to organic cations<br>
stable in the reaction medium.<br>
The mobilization of silica can be carried out in the<br>
presence of OH" groups and a basic medium, that can be<br>
introduced as a hydroxide of the SDA itself, such as for<br>
example, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide in the case of<br>
zeolite ZSM-5. The fluoride ions can also act as<br>
mobilizing agents of silica in the synthesis of zeolites,<br>
such as is described, for example, in patent application<br>
EP-A-337479 in accordance with which HF is used in H2O at<br>
a low pH as a mobilizing agent of the silica for the<br>
synthesis of ZSM-5. However, the use of fluoride ions in<br>
the synthesis is less desired from an industrial point of<br>
view than the use of OH", given that the presence of<br>
fluoride ions requires the use of special materials in<br>
the synthesis equipment, as well as a specific treatment<br>
with waste waters and gases.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention refers to a microporous<br>
crystalline material (hereinafter also called ITQ-21) and<br>
the process for obtaining the same in a basic medium, in<br>
the absence of added fluoride. This new material has, in<br>
the  calcined  form  as  well  as  in  the  uncalcined<br>
synthesized form, an X-ray diffraction pattern that is<br>
different from that of other known zeolitic materials.<br>
The most important diffraction lines of the material for<br>
its calcined are shown in Table 1.<br>

(a)±0.2<br>
The crystalline material of this invention named<br>
ITQ-21 has a molar composition in its calcined and<br>
anhydrous state represented by the equation:<br>
X X2O3 : y YO2 : Z ZO2<br>
wherein<br>
X is a trivalent element such as Al, B, Fe, In, Ga,<br>
Cr or combinations thereof,<br>
Y is a tetravalent element such as Si, Ti, Sn or<br>
combinations thereof, although Si is preferred,<br>
and Z is Ge;  <br>
wherein the value of (y+z)/x is less than 5, and can be<br>
comprised between 7 and a and the value y/z is at least<br>
1.<br>
From the values given, it is clearly inferred that<br>
the crystalline material ITQ-21 can be synthesized in the<br>
absence of added trivalent elements.<br>
In turn, the most important diffraction lines for<br>
the uncalcined form of the material are the ones given in<br>
These diffractograms were obtained with a Philips<br>
X'Pert diffractometer equipped with a graphite<br>
monochromator and an automatic divergence slot using Ka<br>
radiation of copper. The diffraction data were<br>
registered by a passing of 20 of 0.01° wherein 0 is the<br>
Bragg angle and a count time of 10 seconds per passing.<br>
The relative intensity of the lines is calculated as the<br>
percentage regarding the most intense peak, and a<br>
percentage of 80-100 is considered very strong (vs). a<br>
percentage of 60-80 is considered strong (s) , a<br>
percentage of 40-60 is considered medium, a percentage of<br>
2 0-40 is considered weak (w) and a percentage of 0-20 is<br>
considered very weak (vw).<br>
The compensation cations in the material in its<br>
uncalcined form, or after thermal treatment, can be<br>
exchanged, in the case of being present, by other<br>
metallic ions, H+ and H+ precursors such as for example<br>
NH+4. Among the cations that can be introduced by ionic<br>
exchange, those that can have a positive role in the<br>
activity of the material as a catalyst are preferred, and<br>
more specifically, cations such as H+' rare earth cations<br>
and metals of the group VIII, as well as of group IIA.<br>
IIIA, IVA, Va, IB, IIB, IIIB, IVB, VB, VIIB of the<br>
periodic chart of elements are preferred.<br>
For the purpose of preparing catalysts, the<br>
crystalline material of the present invention can be<br>
combined closely with hydrogenating-dehydrogenating<br>
agents such as platinum, palladium, nickel, rhenium,<br>
cobalt, tungsten, molybdenum, vanadium, chrome,<br>
manganese, iron. The introduction of these elements can<br>
be carried out in the crystallization step, by exchange<br>
(if appropriate), and/or by impregnation or by physical<br>
mixing. These elements can be introduced in their<br>
cationic form and/or as of salts or other compounds which<br>
by decomposition produce the metallic component or oxide<br>
in its suitable catalytic form.<br>
The material ITQ-21 can be prepared in a basic<br>
medium and in the absence of added fluoride ions, from a<br>
reaction mixture that contains H20, optionally an oxide<br>
or a source of the trivalent element X, such as for<br>
example Al and/or B, an oxide or source of the element or<br>
tetravalent elements Y, such as for example Si; a source<br>
of Ge, such as for example GeO2 and an organic structure<br>
directing agent (R) generally a salt of N(16)-<br>
methylsparteinium, preferably the hydroxide.<br>
The composition of the reaction mixture has the<br>
following composition in terms of molar ratios of oxides:<br>
Crystallization of  the  material  ITQ-21  can be<br>
carried out statically or with stirring, in autoclaves at<br>
a temperature between 80 and 200°C, at sufficient times<br>
to achieve crystallization, for example, between 12 hours<br>
and 3 0 days.<br>
When the crystallization step ends, the ITQ-21<br>
crystals are separated from the mother liquors and are<br>
recovered. It should be taken into account that the<br>
components of the synthesis mixture can come from<br>
different sources and depending thereon, crystallization<br>
times and conditions can be varied. For the purpose of<br>
facilitating synthesis, material ITQ-21 crystals can be<br>
added as seeds to the synthesis mixture, in amounts up to<br>
15% by weight with respect to the total oxides. These<br>
can be added before or during crystallization of the<br>
material ITQ-21.<br>
The organic agent can be eliminated, for example by<br>
extraction and/or by thermal treatment heating at a<br>
temperature above 250°C for a period of time between 2<br>
minutes and 25 hours.<br>
The material of the present invention can be made<br>
into pellets in accordance with known techniques, and can<br>
be used as a component of catalysts of catalytic cracking<br>
of hydrocarbons, catalytic hydrocracking of hydrocarbons,<br>
alkylation of aromatics with olefins and in processes of<br>
esterification, acylation, aniline reaction with<br>
formaldehyde in its acid form and/or exchanged with<br>
suitable cations.<br>
