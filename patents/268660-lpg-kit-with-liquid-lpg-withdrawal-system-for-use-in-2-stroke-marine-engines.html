TITLE<br>
LPG KIT WITH LIQUID LPG WITHDRAWAL SYSTEM FOR MARINE ENGINES<br>
APPLICANT<br>
Vanaz Engineers Ltd. of 85 /1 Paud Road, Pune - 411 029, Maharastra, India, an Indian Company Registered under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in<br>
which it is to be performed<br><br>
TITLE<br>
LPG KIT WITH LIQUID LPG WITHDRAWAL SYSTEM FOR MARINE ENGINES<br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a LPG kit for marine engines used in various watercrafts and marine vessels. This invention particularly relates to a LPG kit with liquid LPG withdrawal system to run gasoline marine engines on Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG). Such engines are ordinarily used in fishing boats and for other marine vessels for different applications. LPG kit of the present invention is suitable for 2/4 stroke single or multi cylinder outboard motors and other engines for marine applications.<br>
Prior Art<br>
At present the boats used in fishing along the Indian coastal areas / belt are mostly powered with 2 stroke single or multi cylinder or even 4 stroke single or multi cylinder outboard motors or engines of various makes ranging from 9.9 HP to 110 HP motors. Out of this range, more popularly used outboard motors are of capacities between 9.9 HP to 40 HP. Even in the above range, the majority of outboard motors are of capacity 9.9 HP to 25 HP engines. All these engines are basically Spark Ignition (SI) type engines which run on conventional fuels like petrol or kerosene or petrol start and kerosene run. Due to the extensive use of these conventional fueled engines, the pollution levels particularly along the coastal zones are regularly increasing to a level which is much higher than the expected level. Moreover, the numbers of such motors are rapidly increasing day by day, thus increasing the pollution to alarming high level causing serious threats and health hazards. This is a matter of great concern. Further, the cost of running these engines on conventional fuels is considerably high. As a result reductions of pollutant emission level and cost of fuel have become important issues and considered to be required immediate attention.<br>
1<br><br>
Invention<br>
To avoid the aforesaid drawbacks a great deal of research works have been done particularly in the automotive sector for utilizing alternative fuels like LPG and CNG for 2, 3 and 4 wheeler, commercial vehicles and heavy commercial vehicles which are powered by 2 stroke or 4 stroke single and / or multi cylinder engines.<br>
The use of LPG for outboard motors and other marine engines has not been successfully developed till date upto the expectation and / or desired requirement of the users. The known kits used for conversion of marine engines employing LPG vapour withdrawal system. In such system LPG is withdrawn from the cylinder in gaseous state, the vaporization takes place in the cylinder itself. As the LPG consumption increases due to the higher fuel demand from the Engine, the vaporization rate of liquid LPG inside the cylinder steadily increases, due to this the LPG cylinder temperature reduces to such an extent that it goes even below zero degree, resulting in to reduction in supply of gaseous LPG from the cylinder and further stopping of Engine itself. Such systems therefore either restrain the engine power capacity or necessitate the use of large capacity or multiple cylinder banks. Multiple cylinders occupy a major space in rather small fishing vessels and also add unnecessary weight to the boat. These ultimately result loss of speed, less storage space for the catch and requires more fuel to run the engine.<br>
Moreover, handling of large capacity or multiple LPG cylinders become inconvenient and difficult. Improper placement of large capacity cylinders sometimes lead to uneven distribution of load and often causing toppling of the vessels in the wavy sea.<br>
One of the objects of the present invention is to mitigate the disadvantages as experienced in the prior art and as described herein above in using the known marine engines particularly for the fishing vessels. In the present invention the liquid LPG is withdrawn from the cylinder and vaporized in the Regulator/Vaporizer with the help of Hot/Warm water circulated from Engine cooling jacket. As liquid is withdrawn from the cylinder, no major vapourization takes place in cylinder itself and thus totally avoids cooling/chilling of the cylinder. This enables to get uninterrupted supply of LPG from the cylinder as per the engine demand.<br>
2<br><br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a LPG kit with liquid LPG withdrawal system having less weight thereby enhancing the speed of the fishing boat.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to provide a LPG kit with liquid LPG withdrawal system having smaller dimension, thereby providing more storage space in the marine vessels namely fishing boats.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a LPG kit with liquid LPG withdrawal system which consumes less fuel for the fishing boat.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to have a liquid LPG kit with liquid withdrawal LPG system for marine engines emitting less pollutant in the surrounding atmosphere, and thus reducing the health hazard.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the LPG cylinder valve withdraws liquid LPG from the cylinder and supplies it to the kit vaporizer where liquid LPG is vaporized and the liquid LPG is supplied to the engine through the gas - air mixer.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, small replaceable cylinders of less weight and capacity are used for convenience since such would occupy less space and at the same time supply sufficient quantity of liquid LPG required for the optimum speed and load performance of the marine engines.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention such LPG cylinders are placed on the floor of the vessel. This lowers the load and balances the centre of gravity which gives more stability of the vessel and more storage space for the catch.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, only required numbers of small LPG cylinders are used for reducing the weight of the marine vessel and such cylinders occupy less area or volume in the vessel.<br>
One more object of the present invention is to produce comparatively smaller, lighter and more economical marine vessel, particularly suitable as fishing boat.<br>
3<br><br>
According to this invention there is provided a LPG kit fitted with a liquid withdrawal system for use in marine engines comprising a replaceable LPG cylinder for holding liquid LPG, a liquid withdrawal cylinder valve fitted at the neck of said LPG cylinder, a dip tube being fixed at the lower end of said liquid withdrawal cylinder valve, the other end of said dip tube enters into extends almost upto the inner bottom surface of said cylinder and remains dipped in liquid LPG; a valve adaptor being fitted on said cylinder valve provided with a knob to turn on or off the LPG supply to the system, a LPG regulator being connected to said LPG valve adaptor with a hose tube, a gas flow control valve being fitted to the outlet of said regulator , a gas- air mixer unit being fitted on the carburetor air intake side adjacent to the air box of an engine, said mixture unit and said gas flow control unit being connected by a LPG hose ; said system includes an oil tank , a vacuum operated on / off valve and an oil flow control unit; said oil tank being connected to said vacuum operated valve by an oil hose said vacuum operated valve being connected to said engine, said engine oil flow unit and said mixer unit  by said oil hoses.<br>

In the LPG kit fitted with the liquid withdrawal system of this invention is provided with a leak proof sealing arrangement with a groove on the collar of the valve in which a pawl or locking balls of the adaptor are used to mesh for retaining said adaptor rigidly on said valve. Quite often a metallic tube is fixed at the bottom of said valve body so that LPG vapour does not escape out of the tank and the length of the tube is maintained such that it remains just above the inner bottom surface of the LPG cylinder to facilitate maximum liquid withdrawal.<br>
4<br><br>
The LPG kit is preferably adapted for 2 -stroke but not particularly limited to 2 strokes marine engines running on bi-fuel where LPG cylinder contains liquid LPG maximum upto 80% of its volume.<br>
In one of the aspect the present invention, the LPG kit is fitted with liquid withdrawal system where the hot / warm water from Engine water jacket is connected to vaporizer through the hot water circulation hoses which is used to vapourise liquid LPG to Gaseous LPG.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the 2 stroke engine is provided with a lubrication system where the engine is run on LPG fuel and the oil is supplied to the engine through a vacuum operated on/off valve and flow control unit connected together by oil hose and one end of said vacuum operated valve being connected to the engine manifold for sensing vacuum.<br>

Working of the System:<br>
The accompanying drawings illustrates a typical layout of a two stoke marine (outboard) engine run on bi -fuel. In this system liquid LPG is withdrawn from the replaceable LPG cylinder (10) by the cylinder valve (12) through its dip tube which is dipped in liquid LPG. The liquid is supplied through the valve adapter (23) to the LPG vaporizer (25) by an LPG hose (30). The liquid LPG is converted into vapour in the vapourizer due to the heat of the circulating water from the engine jacket connected to the vaporizer by water circulation hoses shown in Fig. 1.<br>
The LPG vapour is then supplied to the engine due to engine suction created by the moving pistons of the engine. The amount of LPG supplied is controlled by the gas flow control unit (36) fitted on the vapourizer. The gas and the air entering into the engine are mixed together in the gas - air mixer (43) fitted on the intake side of the carburetor from where the said mixture of gas and air is supplied to the engine for combustion and for generating the required power.<br>
In case of a two stroke engine, a lubrication system is required when the engine is run on LPG fuel. The oil is stored in a separate oil tank (50). It is supplied to the engine through a vacuum operated ON / OFF valve (55) and a flow control unit (62) connected through by oil hoses (70). One end of vacuum operated valve (55) is connected to the engine manifold for sensing vacuum.<br>
6<br><br>
As soon as engine starts, the vacuum operated valve (55) opens and allows the oil to enter from the tank (50) into the engine. The quantity of the oil being fed to the engine is controlled by an oil flow control unit (62).<br>
The description and the operation of the two-stroke engine (outboard) engine running on bi-fuel are only by way of an example. It will be appreciated that other improvements and modifications of such engines, which are well within the knowledge of any person skilled in the art are also intended to be covered within the scope of the present invention.<br>
