				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(a) Field of the Invention<br>
Charging/Discharging Device to be connected into a tank<br>
of identical polarity electrodes, or a tank of dissimilar<br>
polarity electrodes by means of coupling conductors, whereof<br>
current pooling terminals of identical potentials and identical<br>
polarity are in parallel, or serving to be connected with current<br>
pooling teirminals between pole boards of dissimilar polarities<br>
in a tank of dissimilar electrodes, executed in serial<br>
connection or compound serial/parallel connection; on the<br>
exterior side of the electrode board, of positive or negative<br>
polarity, on both sides of the individually installed electrode<br>
tank is executed a low resistance current pool structure of<br>
any chosen geometry to facilitate infeeding/outfeeding of<br>
confluent currents, executed in the form of inflowing/effluent<br>
pooling terminals, or that incorporated with parallel current<br>
pool conductor, or as made from material of better conductivity<br>
with a view to reduce the resistance to infeeding/outfeeding<br>
confluent currents.<br>
(b) Description of the Prior Art<br>
With a. conventional Charging/Discharging Device, any<br>
primary or secondary rechargeable cell, or fuel cell, or still<br>
a capacitor or super capacitor or otherwise electricity storage<br>
or discharge device, for example, such as the unilaterally<br>
installed current pool terminal electrode board, of a prior<br>
art, illustrated in Fig. 1, the idea is to have a current pool<br>
terminal T100 installed on one side of each electrode board<br>
P100, meant to converge outfeeding or infeeding currents, or<br>
alternatively to serve as a serial or parallel conjunction point<br>
for communication with other electrodes, as with such executions<br>
there is but one side instead of both on the electrode board<br>
where infeeding or outfeeding current transits, what follows<br>
inevitably on the electrode boards when larger currents were<br>
transiting as input or output is want of uniformity of current<br>
density on portions of electrode board adjacent to the current<br>
pool terminals and on portions of electrode remote from the<br>
current pool terminal T100, since this is a one-way current<br>
path, the internal impedance is necessarily larger; with more<br>
advanced design, still conventional, current pool terminals<br>
were provided on two or more than two locations, so that the<br>
electrode board is equipped with two or more than two outputting<br>
or inputting current paths, so that the internal impedance is<br>
reduced, further more, the two or more than two current pool<br>
terminals on electrode boards of like polarities and of<br>
identical voltage specifications, disposed in a tank of like<br>
electrodes or dissimilar electrodes are paralleled together<br>
by means of a rod conductor; or alternatively the same rod<br>
conductor serves to interconnect current pool terminals of<br>
dissimilar electrodes in a tank of dissimilar electrodes in<br>
serial or compound serial/parallel combinations; structurally<br>
the positive electrode board and the negative electrode board<br>
is configured circular, or nearly circular, or ellipsoidal,<br>
or triangular or polygonal, including: quadrilateral,<br>
quinquangular, six-sided, seven-sided, eight-sided and<br>
higher-order sided polylaterals, as regards its low impedance<br>
current pool execution it can be: (1) having one or more<br>
individually outwardly extending current pool terminals<br>
installed on two or more sides of the electrode board, shown<br>
in Fig. 2 is an illustration of one current pool terminal fitted<br>
to either side of the electrode board; or instead two or more<br>
than two current pool terminals T100 are mounted on one side<br>
or more sides of the electrode board P100, to thereby account<br>
for two or more than two current input or output paths, thus<br>
achieving a lowering of internal impedance, shown in Fig. 3<br>
is an illustration of two current pool terminals installed on<br>
sides opposite each on the electrode board; or alternatively<br>
(2) having one or more conductive penetration holes S100<br>
installed individually on chosen quarters or middle quarters<br>
on two or more than two sides abutting the exteriority of the<br>
electrode board P100, or instead having same, but at least two,<br>
on chosen quarters on one side or on more sides, and that<br>
complemented with one or more isolation space or insolation<br>
gap reserved in chosen or middle quarters on two or more than<br>
two sides of aforementioned positive electrode board or negative<br>
electrode board, serving to accommodate passage of the rod<br>
conductor B100 once electrode boards of dissimilar polarities<br>
are intercrossed and set in order, without coming into contact,<br>
or instead the same may be replaced with one or more isolated<br>
penetration holes each sized larger than the rod conductor,<br>
so that the electrode board is equiped with two or more that<br>
two input or output current paths, and that in order to reduce<br>
the internal impedance of the battery installations, Fig. 4<br>
illustrates an example of the electrode board equiped with two<br>
penetration holes and two isolation gaps structured accordingly;<br>
such an improved structure, while it, by increasing current<br>
paths in the charge storage/discharging devices, does achieve<br>
in reduction of the internal impedance of the stroage discharge<br>
devices, polylateral and multiple path interconnected in series<br>
or parallel between individual tanks of electrodes involved<br>
in the art will necessarily mean increased production costs<br>
and more time and labor required in the production process.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Charging/Discharging Device featuring one or more current<br>
pool means so that the electrode board is furnished withmultiple<br>
current pool paths, and with current pool terminals in tanks<br>
of like electrode polarities or those in tanks of dissimilar<br>
electrode polarities but alike in voltage specifications and<br>
electrode polarities boards connected in parallel, or<br>
alternatively with current pool terminals between boards of<br>
dissimilar electrode polarities in tanks different in electrode<br>
polarities interconnected in series or in compound serial<br>
parallel combinations, and that complemented by having the<br>
exteriority of the positive or negative electrode board on both<br>
sides of individual electrode tanks made into a low impedance<br>
structure that is favorable to incoming/outgoing confluent<br>
currents.<br>

structure very advantageous to both ingoing and outgoing pool<br>
currents.<br>

of identical polarity electrodes, or a tank of dissimilar<br>

technique or by burial, inlay or otherwise means among<br>
themselves, established outside the positive or negative<br>
polarity electrode boards on both sides of the electrode<br>

A number of examples of a low impedance current pool assembly<br>
for a storage/discharge device incorporating one or more of<br>
the above-mentioned features and their applications will be<br>
described below, lots of geometry do apply for this design,<br>
options are also open as to the number of sides of the current<br>
pool terminals and the number of the terminals themselves, our<br>
description will go with reference to the example given in any<br>
of Fig. 5 through Fig. 35, which by no means serves to delimit<br>
the scope of application of the low impedance current pool<br>
assembly of the subject storage/discharge device, to set off<br>
the chief features of the subject design, casings which had<br>
long been employed in conventional storage/discharge devices<br>
as well as electrolytic isolation shields, isolation mats or<br>
membranes laid between electrode boards of dissimilar<br>
polarities, dielectric coatings applied in-between included,<br>
of a known art applied for or in a conventional<br>
charging/discharging device, will only be mentioned briefly<br>
or omitted altogether in the course of description following<br>
next in the context.<br>
The subject low impedance structure of the low impedance<br>
current pool assembly of the subject storage/discharge device<br>
includes improvement of the exteriority of the positive or<br>
negative polarity electrode board and current pool terminals,<br>
on both sides of each independently installed electrode tank,<br>
as illustrated in Fig. 5 through Fig. 10, noted hereinbefore,<br>
the design in respect of the improvement of the positive or<br>
negative exteriority of the electrode board on both sides of<br>
the independently installed electrode tank is thus: having one<br>
or more piece of paralleled positive electrode board P100 and<br>
as matched thereto, one or more piece of paralleled negative<br>
electrode board P100, set in individual electrode tanks to<br>
constitute individual electrode pairs, then have flat plate<br>
form current pool conductor assembly of chosen material and<br>
made to specified thickness installed way between respective<br>
current pool terminals on the exteriority of positive or<br>
negative electrode board P200 on both sides of each individual<br>
electrode tank, so that it is made that the impedance prevalent<br>
way between the current pool terminals on the periphery of the<br>
external positive or negative electrode board P200 is inferior<br>
to that impedance prevailing across the normal electrode surface<br>
duly applied with one layer of chemically active material in<br>
lattice configurations on the same electrode board; shown in<br>
Fig. 5 is an illustration of the current pool conductor assembly<br>
of a plate form or thickened plate form or integral with the<br>
exteriority of the external electrode board, in individual<br>
electrode tank, of the subject storage/discharge device, the<br>
plate form being uniform or non-uniform in thickness, at a slope<br>
in place; a side view of what is given in Fig. 5 is shown in<br>
Fig. 6; shown in Fig. 7 is an execution of what is shown in<br>
Fig. 5 with like polarity on like polarity paralleling; way<br>
between respective current pool terminal T100, outside the<br>
positive or negative polarity electrode board P2 00 on both sides<br>
of individual electrode pairs installed in aforementioned<br>
individual electrode tank, may be processed straight conductive<br>
assembly of given thickness and in webform, such as that<br>
illustrated in Fig. 8, still pursuant to the invention, a side<br>
view of what is shown in Fig. 8 is given in Fig. 9; an execution<br>
of the example shown in Fig. 8 with like polarity paralleling<br>
is shown in Fig. 10.<br>
In the individual electrode pairs formed in the<br>
independently installed electrode tank, way between the current<br>
pool terminals outside the positive or negative polarity<br>
electrode board P200 on both sides, pieces or webform or stripe<br>
form current pool conductor assembly are interconnected by<br>
soldering, welding, riveting, screw coupling, prestressed<br>
bonding, internal burial, laying or otherwise technique, in<br>
order that the impedance prevailing between the current pool<br>
terminals T100 on the perimeter of the externally provided<br>
positive or negative polarity electrode boards be controlled<br>
inferior to the impedance on the normal electrode surface on<br>
the other side of the same electrode board that is applied with<br>
a lattice work of chemically active coating; shown in Fig. 11<br>
is an illustration of the strip-formed current pool conductor<br>
assembly on the outside of the externally provided electrode<br>
board in each independently installed electrode tank of the<br>
low impedance current pool structure according to the subject<br>
storage/discharge device, a side view of this illustration is<br>
given in Fig. 12, as dependent on Fig. 11, an execution of what<br>
is shown in Fig. 11 with like polarity paralleling is shown<br>
in Fig. 13.<br>
The electrode board with plate form terminals on the outside<br>
as aforementioned is good for connection to two or more than<br>
two independent electrode tanks, and hence good for like<br>
polarity on like polarity paralleling or opposite polarity<br>
serial connection under the same voltage specifications, a<br>
multiple serial combination made with respect to the current<br>
pool terminals on respective independent electrode tank<br>
illustrated in Fig. 5 is illustrated in Fig. 14.<br>
Additionally, where required on that side of the externally<br>
providedplate-f orm terminalled electrode boardmeant to couple<br>
with current pool terminals coming from other electrode tanks<br>
may be mounted two or more than two current pool terminals to<br>
thereby account for multiple coupling possibilities so that<br>
impedance is lowered in the long run; an example of this is<br>
shown in Fig. 15; a side view of this presentation is given<br>
in Fig. 16, as dependent on Fig. 15.<br>
In the subject storage/discharge device in general, in the<br>
low impedance current pool structure, in the current conductor<br>
assembly outside the positive or negative electrode board P200<br>
on both sides of the individual electrode tank in particular,<br>
are provided two current pool terminals T100 to accommodate<br>
serial or parallel combination with each electrode tank where<br>
multiple sets of electrode tanks are deployed for application;<br>
shown in Fig. 17 is as illustration of multiple serial parallel<br>
combination sourced to each current pool terminal on the part<br>
of each independent electrode tank shown in Fig. 5.<br>
In the subject storage/discharge device specifically with<br>
respect to its low impedance current pool structure, with a<br>
view to further reduce the impedance on the part of both the<br>
current pool terminal and of the electrode board, a feasible<br>
approach is to process the current pool terminal trapezoidal<br>
extending outwardly, such that the wider base of the trapezoidal<br>
current pool terminal is coupled to the electrode board, whereby<br>
the internal impedance on the terminal, output or input, of<br>
the electrode board, is duly reduced.<br>
Examples of application of the aforementioned trapezoidal<br>
current pool terminal and electrode boards include: normal<br>
electrode boards P100 with both sides applied with latticed<br>
chemically active coating, two or more than two outputting or<br>
inputting current pool terminal T100 on the outside of the<br>
positive or negative polarity electrode board P200 on both sides<br>
of each electrode tank, possible for mounting on one side or<br>
more sides of the electrode board P100 or the positive or negative<br>
