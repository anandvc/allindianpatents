				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an enzymatic process for the preparation of S-(+)-4-(3-thienyl)phenyl-a-methylacetic acid, by enantioselective hydrolysis of the corresponding racemic ester using an extracellular lipase.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of S-(+)-4-(3-thienyl)phenyl-α-methylacetic acid, of structural formula (3) in the accompanying diagram, by enantioselective hydrolysis of racemic ester of the acid (1), of structural formula (2), in the accompanying diagram, in a buffer medium or buffer containing a co-solvent if required in presence of commercially available lipases derived from the microorganisms of the genera Candida, Mucor, Rhizopus, Pseudomonas and Aspergillus. However, particularly preferred is the lipase from Candida rugosa.<br>
Background and prior art reference<br>
4-(3-thienyl)phenyl-a-methylacetic acid is an intermediate for methyl 4-(3-thienyl)phenyl-α-methylacetate, an antiinflammatory agent approved by WHO under the name Atliprofen. This drug has been found to be effective and well tolerated both in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. In addition, side effects found with other NSAIDs like haematological, renal, hepatic and coagulation abnormalities are absent and gastrointestinal problems are insignificant [Drugs of the Future, 1988, 13 (5), 411-2, www.phanrtabiz.com Nov 20, 2000].<br>
A number of 2-arylpropionic acids are known as antiinflammatory agents and among the best known are ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, ketoprofen, and suprofen (all of which are substituted a-methylbenzeneacetic acids), and naproxen (a substituted a-methylnaphthaleneacetic acid). It is to be recognized that the a-methylarylacetic acid molecule is chiral at the a-carbon atom and, therefore, exists in two enantiomeric forms viz. the R and S forms. The S-enantiomers of these a-methylarylacetic acids possess greater antiinflammatory activity than the R-enantiomers [ Lombardino J.G.(ed.); Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1985, 303]. S-(+)-<br>
naproxen for example, is having 28 times greater antiinflammatory activity than the R-enantiomer [HarrisonJ.T.; Lewis,B.; Nelson,0.; Rooks,W.; Roszkowski,A.; Tomolonis,A.; Fried,J.H., J Med. Chem., 1970, 13, 203].<br>
The chemical synthesis [Marwah, A.K.; Sastry,C.V.R.; Shridhar,D.R., GB2181728 (1987)] of 4-(3-thienyl)phenyl-a-methylacetic acid leads to a racemic mixture of R and S enantiomers. Hence, there is a need to develop a resolution method in order to separate the individual enantiomers from the racemic mixture. The chemical resolution methods reported for other arylpropionic acids are cumbersome and expensive and usually involve selective stoichiometric crystallization of a diastereomeric salt by the use of an expensive amine such as cinchonidine [HarrisonJ.T.; Lewis,B.; Nelson.O.; Rooks,W.; Roszkowski,A.; Tomolonis,A.; FriedJ.H., J Med. Chem., 1970, 13, 203] or α-methylbenzylamine [Manimaran,T; Impastato,FJ,(Ethyl Corp.), US5015764 (1991)].<br>
Alternatively, the racemic acids are also resolved by enantioselective hydrolysis of the corresponding ester by using extracellular lipases from microbial origin [Gu,Q.M.; Chen,C.S.; Sih C.J., Tetrahedron letters, 1763 (1986)]. Similarly, reference may be made to another process reported in prior art [BattistelJE.; Bianchi,D.;.Cesti,P.; Pina,C, Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 1991, 659] wherein a process for the enantioselective hydrolysis of racemic naproxen esters is described for obtaining the S-acid by using a lipase from Candida rugosa.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of 5-(+)-4-(3-thienyl)phenyl-α-methylacetic acid through kinetic resolution of the corresponding racemic esters.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of S-(+)-4-(3-thienyl)phenyl-α-methylacetic acid using an extracellular lipase enzyme in a buffer medium. Summary of the Invention<br>
