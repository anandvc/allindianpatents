TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to the field of cellular radio communications, and more specifically<br>
to a method for generating a group identifier of the random access response message and<br>
a random access method.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a cellular radio communication system mainly comprises terminals,<br>
base stations and a core network (CN). A radio access network (RAN) is a network<br>
formed by the base stations and responsible for the transaction of the access layer, for<br>
example, the management of the radio resources, etc. A physical or logical connection<br>
may exist among the base stations according to the actual conditions, for example, the<br>
connection between the base station 1 and the base station 2 or between the base station 1<br>
and the base station 3 shown in Fig. 1. Each base station can be connected with one or<br>
more core network nodes. The core network is responsible for the transaction of a<br>
non-access layer, for example, the location updating, etc., and it is an anchor point of the<br>
user plane. The terminals refer to various devices for communicating with the cellular<br>
radio communication network, for example, mobile telephones or notebook computers, etc.<br>
The cellular radio communication system takes a radio frame as the basic unit for<br>
identification of the system time, the serial number of the radio frame is known as radio<br>
frame number (SFN). The terminal can acquire the boundary of the radio frame through a<br>
cell search method, thereby achieving time synchronization on a downlink. In the cellular<br>
radio communication system such as the Long Term Evolution (LTE) system , the length of<br>
the radio frame is 10ms (millisecond), and as shown in Fig. 2, as to the Frequency Division<br>
Duplex (FDD) mode, 10 subframes are included in one radio frame, the time length of each<br>
subframe is 1ms, each subframe includes two time slots, and the time length of each time<br>
slot is 0.5ms; as shown in Fig. 3, as to the Time Division Duplex (TDD) mode, generally<br>
<br>
 <br>
speaking, one frame includes two half frames of which the time length is 5ms, each half<br>
frame includes 5 subframes, the time length of each subframe is 1ms, except for subframe<br>
#1 and subframe #6, other subframes also include two time slots, wherein the time length of<br>
the subframe and the time slot are the same with that in the FDD mode respectively;<br>
subframe #1 and subframe #6 respectively include 3 special time slots, i.e., DwPTS, GP<br>
and UpPTS. Subframe #6 can also be a normal subframe in some TDD frame formats, as<br>
shown in Fig. 4.<br>
As to the LTE system, the length of a normal random access time slot is 1ms, i.e.,<br>
occupying the length of one subframe, and in addition, an extended random access time<br>
slot is also introduced, which may occupy the length of 2 or 3 subframes. A short random<br>
access time slot is also introduced in the TDD mode, i.e., transmitting on the UpPTS time<br>
slot.<br>
As to the FDD mode, any subframe in time domain can be configured as a random<br>
access time slot, but only one random access channel exists on one random access time<br>
slot. One random access channel occupies the bandwidth of 6 radio resource blocks (RB)<br>
in frequency domain. As to the TDD mode, subframe #0 and subframe #5 are always<br>
downlink time slots in time domain, therefore, subframe #0 and subframe #5 cannot be<br>
configured as random access time slots, the UpPTS time slots in subframe #1 and<br>
subframe #6 can be configured as random access time slots, whether other time slots<br>
except for the above can be configured as random access time slots is determined by the<br>
method of configuring an uplink time slot and a downlink time slot in the TDD frame<br>
structure, that the time slots configured as uplink subframes can be taken as the random<br>
access time slot. As to the TDD mode, one or more random access channels can exist on<br>
one random access time slot.<br>
In the prior LTE system, the process of the terminal accessing into the cellular radio<br>
communication system comprises three steps as follows:<br>
<br>
 <br>
Step a, the terminal transmits a random access preamble message to the base station<br>
though a certain random access time slot of the radio frame;<br>
Step b, the base station responds the terminal with a random access response<br>
message;<br>
Step c, the terminal determines whether a correct response message is received<br>
according to the group identifier in the random access response message and the index of<br>
the random access preamble.<br>
In step a, one or more terminals may transmit random access preamble messages to<br>
the base station though the same random access time slot, that these random access<br>
preamble messages may be the same with or different from each other, and the base<br>
station can identify the different random access preamble messages on the same random<br>
access time slot.<br>
In step b, the random access response message may contain response information in<br>
response of one or more random access preamble messages. These random access<br>
preamble messages are all transmitted though the same random access time slot.<br>
Probably more than one random access response messages are merged into one<br>
response message, mainly in order to improve the utilization ratio of the radio resources in<br>
the random access process. In order to enable the terminal to identify the random access<br>
response messages, the base station adds a group identifier in the message, and there is a<br>
corresponding relationship between the group identifier and the random access time slot<br>
though which the random access preamble message is transmitted. Meanwhile, the<br>
random access response message may also contain an individual identifier corresponding<br>
to the random access preamble message itself, which is usually an index number of the<br>
random access preamble. The method for setting the group identifier is regulated in the<br>
<br>
 <br>
protocol in advance, and when certain terminal transmits the random access preamble<br>
message to the base station, it has already been known what group identifier and individual<br>
identifier are to be received.<br>
To ensure that the random access response process has certain flexibility, the random<br>
access response message is not synchronous with the random access preamble message,<br>
i.e., there is no fixed relationship between the two in time domain; on the contrast, the<br>
random access response message is allowed to be transmitted in a time window. At the<br>
same time, to increase the flexibility of the scheduling of the radio sources, to respond the<br>
random access preamble message received though certain random access time slot, the<br>
base station can transmit the random access response message corresponding to the<br>
random access preamble message on one or more Transmission Time Intervals (TTIs) in<br>
the time window. The start time of the time window is related to the speed of the base<br>
station to process the random access preamble message, and its end time is related to the<br>
load of the base station to process the random access preamble message and the radio<br>
resources scheduled to the random access response message, and other factors.<br>
In step c, after the terminal receives one random access response message in the<br>
specified time window, firstly, the terminal verifies whether the expected group identifier is<br>
included in the message; if the expected group identifier is included in the message, the<br>
terminal then verifies whether the individual identifier (for example, index number)<br>
corresponding to the transmitted random access preamble message is also included in the<br>
response message; if the expected individual identifier (for example, index number) is<br>
included, it can be determined that the current random access response message<br>
corresponds to the transmitted random access preamble message.<br>
In the prior art, a method for setting the group identifier in step b is provided. Generally,<br>
in these methods a group identifier is calculated according to the absolute location of the<br>
random access time slot in the system time, therefore the group identifier is unique within<br>
<br>
 <br>
the specified time range. These methods have the disadvantages that firstly, the terminal<br>
need to acquire the absolute system time of the cellular system in which the random access<br>
time slot lies, which generally refers to SFN, however, in real application, for example, the<br>
SFN of the target cellular system may be not known by the terminal in advance during the<br>
handover process, the group identifier cannot be calculated, and extra delay and system<br>
processing, for example, reading the system message, are usually needed to acquire the<br>
SFN of the target cellular system, because the SFN is usually broadcast in the system<br>
message.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The technical problems that the invention aims to solve is to provide a method for<br>
generating a group identifier of the random access response message and a random<br>
access method, so that the terminal accesses into the cellular radio communication system<br>
rapidly and accurately.<br>
To solve the problems above, the invention provides a method for generating a group<br>
identifier of the random access response message, and the group identifier is determined<br>
according to the serial number Sn of the subframe in which the random access time slot of<br>
the random access preamble message transmitted by the terminal lies and the serial<br>
number m of the random access channel in which the random access time slot lies.<br>
Further, the group identifier may be determined according to the following formula:<br>
group identifier = Sn + m x 10.<br>
Further, when the random access time slot is an extended random access time slot, the<br>
serial number Sn of the subframe in which the random access time slot lies may refer to the<br>
serial number of the subframe at the start position in a plurality of subframes occupied by<br>
the random access time slot.<br>
<br>
 <br>
To solve the problems above, the invention also provides a random access method for<br>
the cellular radio communication system. The terminal transmits the random access<br>
preamble message to the base station though the random access time slot and then<br>
detects the random access response message corresponding to the random access<br>
preamble message in the time window; the random access response message includes a<br>
group identifier; the group identifier is determined according to the serial number Sn of the<br>
subframe in which the random access time slot lies and the serial number m of the random<br>
access channel in which the random access time slot lies.<br>
Further, the group identifier may be determined according to the following formula:<br>
group identifier = Sn + m x 10.<br>
Further, the terminal may read the parameter of the time window for random access in a<br>
common signaling, and the common signaling may include system messages; or the<br>
terminal may read the parameter of the time window for random access in a dedicated<br>
signaling, and the dedicated signaling may include handover command messages.<br>
Further, when the random access time slot is an extended random access time slot, the<br>
serial number Sn of the subframe in which the random access time slot lies may refer to the<br>
serial number of the subframe at the start position in a plurality of subframes occupied by<br>
the random access time slot.<br>
To solve the problems above, the invention also provides a random access response<br>
method for the cellular radio communication system. The base station receives the random<br>
access preamble message transmitted by the terminal though the random access time slot<br>
and then transmits the random access response message corresponding to the random<br>
access preamble message in the time window; the random access response message<br>
includes a group identifier; and the group identifier is determined according to the serial<br>
<br>
 <br>
number Sn of the subframe in which the random access time slot lies and the serial number<br>
m of the random access channel in which the random access time slot lies.<br>
Further, the group identifier may be determined according to the following formula:<br>
group identifier = Sn + m x 10.<br>
Further, when the random access time slot is an extended random access time slot, the<br>
serial number Sn of the subframe in which the random access time slot lies may refer to the<br>
serial number of the subframe at the start position in a plurality of subframes occupied by<br>
the random access time slot.<br>
By using the method of the invention, the terminal can access into the cellular radio<br>
communication system rapidly and accurately, the determining of the group identifier in the<br>
random access response message by the terminal is not depended upon the reading of the<br>
SFN, and this is especially important for the random access process during the handover<br>
process. In addition, no matter how the configuration of the random access time slot<br>
changes, the same method can be adopted for setting the group identifier, and the<br>
operation is easy for realization.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In the invention, the terminal transmits the random access preamble message to the<br>
base station though the random access time slot and then detects the random access<br>
response message corresponding to the random access preamble message in the time<br>
window; the corresponding random access response message includes a group identifier,<br>
and the group identifier is determined according to the serial number of the subframe in<br>
which the random access time slot lies and the serial number of the random access<br>
channel in which the random access time slot lies.<br>
Preferably, the group identifier is determined according to the following formula:<br>
Group Identifier = Sn + m x 10.<br>
Wherein, the parameter Sn refers to the serial number of the subframe in which the<br>
random access time slot lies, and the parameter m refers to the serial number of the<br>
random access channel in which the random access time slot lies.<br>
The technical scheme of the invention will be described in detail in conjunction with the<br>
embodiments and accompanying drawings as follows.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the random access method for the cellular radio communication<br>
system comprises the following steps:<br>
<br>
 <br>
Step 501, the terminal transmits the random access preamble message to the base<br>
station through the random access time slot, and in the light of the predetermined method<br>
for generating the group identifier, the group identifier expected to be received is<br>
determined according to the serial number of the subframe in which the random access<br>
time slot lies and the serial number of the random access channel in which the random<br>
access time slot lies;<br>
Step 502, the base station determines the group identifier of RA-RNTI (Random<br>
Access-Radio Network Temporary Identifier) in the light of the same method for generating<br>
the group identifier that is used by the terminal, then adds the group identifier together with<br>
the individual identifier corresponding to the random access preamble message into the<br>
random access response message, and then transmits the random access response<br>
message to the terminal;<br>
Step 503, when the terminal detects and determines in the time window that the group<br>
identifier in the received random access response message and the index of the random<br>
access preamble are the expected values respectively determined by the terminal, the<br>
terminal determines that the random access response message is the response message<br>
corresponding to the random access preamble message transmitted by the terminal.<br>
In step 502, the random access response message also includes uplink radio resources<br>
allocated to the terminal by the base station; in step 503, after determining the receiving of<br>
the expected random access response message, the terminal transmits message or data<br>
to the base station through the uplink radio resources.<br>
In step 503, the parameter of the time window for receiving the random access<br>
response message by the terminal can be read in a common signaling by the terminal, and<br>
<br>
 <br>
the common signaling includes system messages; or be read in a dedicated signaling by<br>
the terminal, and the dedicated signaling includes handover command messages.<br>
In step 501 or step 502, the method for generating the group identifier comprises:<br>
The group identifier is determined according to the serial number Sn of the subframe in<br>
which the random access time slot of the random access preamble message transmitted by<br>
the terminal lies and the serial number m of the random access channel in which the<br>
random access time slot lies.<br>
The group identifier can be directly determined according to the following formula:<br>
RA-RNTI = Sn + mx10	(1)<br>
Wherein, Sn refers to the serial number of the subframe in which the random access<br>
time slot in the radio frame lies; when the random access time slot is an extended random<br>
access time slot, Sn refers to the serial number of the subframe at the start position in a<br>
plurality of subframes occupied by the random access time slot; in the TDD mode, if the<br>
random access time slot occupies the UpPTS time slot, Sn refers to the serial number of<br>
subframe #1 and subframe #6;<br>
m refers to the serial number of the random access channel in which the random access<br>
time slot lies. In the FDD mode, only one random access channel is configured, and m is<br>
always 0; in the TDD mode, a plurality of random access channels can be configured, and<br>
m may be greater than 0;<br>
In addition, to determine the group identifier, a range value N can be used in conjunction<br>
with the serial number Sn of the subframe in which the random access time slot lies and the<br>
serial number m of the random access channel in which the random access time slot lies,<br>
<br>
 <br>
and the range value N can be determined according to the time window parameter<br>
configured by the network and can also be a constant.<br>
When the range value N is 10, the generation of the group identifier is determined only<br>
according to the serial number Sn of the subframe in which the random access time slot lies<br>
and the serial number m of the random access channel in which the random access time<br>
slot lies.<br>
The RA-RNTI corresponding to the random access time slot is determined according to<br>
the following formula:<br>
RA-RNTI = RA-RNTI-COUNT + Sn%N + m x N	(2)<br>
Wherein, the parameters Sn and m have been described above and thus, the detailed<br>
description thereof will be omitted herein.<br>
The range value N can be determined according to the length of the time window for<br>
receiving the random access response message by the terminal. For example, when the<br>
length of the time window is equal to or less than 5, the range value N is 5; otherwise, the<br>
range value N is 10; the range value N can also be a constant (fixed value) such as 2, 5 or<br>
10. The length of the time window is configured by the system, and the terminal acquires<br>
the length of the time window through a dedicated signaling (for example, handover<br>
command) or a common signaling (for example, system message).<br>
% indicates a modulus operator, and Sn%N indicates the modulus of Sn to N, i.e., the<br>
remainder obtained by exactly dividing Sn with N.<br>
<br>
 <br>
RA-RNTI-COUNT is a constant set by the system, and the constant has the same<br>
length with the identification C-RNTI configured to the terminal by the system, i.e., the<br>
occupied bits are the same. The value of RA-RNTI-COUNT can be set to be 0.<br>
It can be understood that when N=0, and RA-RNTI-COUNT=0, the formula (2) above is<br>
simplified as follows:<br>
RA-RNTI = Sn%10 + mx 10	(3)<br>
Since Sn is ranged from 0 to 9, Sn%10=Sn, i.e., the formula (3) is identical to the<br>
formula (1):<br>
RA-RNTI = Sn + mx 10<br>
This can be further described by the following detailed embodiments:<br>
The generation of the group identifier is determined according to the formula (1):<br>
As to the FDD mode, the value of m is 0, then RA-RNTI= Sn; therefore the RA-RNTI<br>
corresponding to the random access preamble message transmitted on subframe #2(i.e.,<br>
Sn=2) is 2; the RA-RNTI corresponding to the random access preamble message<br>
transmitted on subframe #8(i.e., Sn=8) is 8.<br>
As to the TDD mode, it is assumed that 4 random access channels are configured, and<br>
the RA-RNTI corresponding to the random access preamble message transmitted on<br>
subframe #2(i.e., Sn=2) in random access channel #0 (m=0) is 2+0*10, i.e., 2; the<br>
RA-RNTI corresponding to the random access preamble message transmitted on<br>
subframe #8(i.e., Sn=8) in random access channel #3(m=3) is 8+3*10, i.e., 38.<br>
<br>
 <br>
The generation of the group identifier is determined according to the formula (2):<br>
As to the FDD mode, the value of m is 0, the received time window is assumed to be 4,<br>
then N=5, the RA-RNTI corresponding to the random access preamble message<br>
transmitted on subframe #3(i.e., Sn=3) is RA-RNTI-COUNT+3%5, i.e.,<br>
RA-RNTI-COUNT+3; the RA-RNTI corresponding to the random access preamble<br>
message transmitted on subframe #7(i.e., Sn=7) is RA-RNTI-COUNT+7%5, i.e.,<br>
RA-RNTI-COUNT+2.<br>
As to the TDD mode, it is assumed that 3 random access channels are configured, the<br>
receiving time window is 6, N=10, and then RA-RNTI corresponding to the random access<br>
preamble message transmitted on subframe #3(Sn=3) in random access channel #0(m=0)<br>
is RA-RNTI-COUNT+3%10+0*10, i.e., RA-RNTI-COUNT+3; the RA-RNTI corresponding<br>
to the random access preamble message transmitted on subframe #7(Sn=7) in random<br>
access channel #2(m=2) is RA-RNTI-COUNT+7%10+2*10, i.e., RA-RNTI-COUNT+27.<br>
It is assumed that the RA-RNTI-COUNT involved in the formula (2) is 0X2008<br>
(represented in hexadecimal format).<br>
Specific embodiment 1: in the FDD mode, the length of the receiving time window is<br>
assumed to be 4ms, N=5, the serial number of the subframe on which the random access<br>
preamble message was transmitted is Sn, then,<br>
RA-RNTI=0X2008 + Sn%5, wherein Sn is ranged from 0 to 9.<br>
When Sn=3, RA-RNTI = 0X2008+3 = 0X200B<br>
When Sn=6, RA-RNTI = 0X2008+1 = 0X2009<br>
<br>
 <br>
Specific embodiment 2: in the TDD mode, the length of the receiving time window is<br>
assumed to be 6ms, N=10; the serial number of the subframe in which the time slot for<br>
transmitting the random access preamble lies is Sn, and the serial number of the random<br>
access channel in which the time slot for transmitting the random access preamble lies is m,<br>
then:<br>
RA-RNTI = 0X2008 + Sn%10 + m x 10, wherein the range of Sn is 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and<br>
9.<br>
When m=0, and Sn=1, RA-RNTI = 0X2008 + 1=0X2009<br>
When m=1, and Sn=3, RA-RNTI = 0X2008 + 3 + 10=0X2015<br>
When m=2, and Sn=6, RA-RNTI = 0X2008 + 6 + 20=0X2022<br>
In the above formulas, the operation of the hexadecimal 0X2008 being directly added to<br>
the decimal Sn%10 and m x10 aims to easily understand formula (2).<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to the specific embodiments,<br>
those skilled in the art should understand that various modifications and variations can be<br>
made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. It is intended that all<br>
these modifications and variations fall within the scope of the invention and the protection of<br>
the claims attached with the invention.<br>

The invention discloses a method for generating a group identifier of the random access<br>
response message. The group identifier is determined according to the serial number of<br>
the subframe in which the random access time slot of random access preamble message<br>
transmitted by the terminal lies and the serial number of the random access channel in<br>
which the random access time slot lies. A random access method and a random access<br>
response method in a cellular radio communication system are also provided. Using the<br>
method of the present invention, the terminal needs not acquire the absolute system time of<br>
the cellular system in which the random access time slot lies, and can access the cellular<br>
radio communication system rapidly and accurately.<br>
