				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is related to the growth of metal/compound nanotube arrays that are aligned in a<br>
particular direction. More specifically, the invention is a method of growing metal/compound<br>
nanotube arrays in a nanoporous template to provide for uniformly-dimensioned metal nanotube<br>
arrays of high aspect ratio.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
The discovery of carbon nanotubes in 1991 initiated the interest on tubular nanostructures<br>
because of their immense fundamental importance as well as their potential applications in the<br>
nanoscale devices, sensors, catalysis, thermal materials, structural composites, field emission,<br>
biomedicine and energy storage/conversion. Porous membranes such as anodic alumina,<br>
polycarbonate membranes, block copolymers etc. have opened up the possibilities of the<br>
synthesis of arrays of ordered nanowires of a number of materials. Electrodeposition is one the<br>
most convenient methods of filling the pores of these membranes to get arrays of nanowires of<br>
various metals. Use of electrodeposition for the synthesis of ordered arrays of nanowires in such<br>
templates is well studied.<br>
However till date there are very few reports of the synthesis of dense arrays of aligned metal<br>
nanotubes using nanoporous templates. Most of the earlier work in this area involve chemical<br>
modification of the pore surface of porous templates to enhance the deposition of the metal on<br>
the pores. Such chemical modifications often add impurities to the nanotubes. Other methods<br>
consist of using special additives or using low deposition current densities. These methods are<br>
often too specific for a particular kind of metal to be deposited and cannot be used for a variety<br>
of materials. Often it is also specific to an application. The processes are time consuming<br>
because of the complexities involved.<br>
Thus a general and efficient method for the synthesis of metal nanotubes (with controlled length,<br>
diameter and wall thickness) still remains a challenge particularly in templates which allow<br>
synthesis of large ordered arrays.<br>
We present here a novel, versatile and general approach for preparing metal and alloy/compound<br>
nanotube (NT) arrays. The method uses a template like anodic alumina and has full control on<br>
length, diameter and wall thickness of the nanotube. The method is general enough and in<br>
principle can be applied to prepare single metal nanotubes of all metals or alloys or multilayers<br>
which can be deposited by electrodeposition technique. This method in principle can also be<br>
used to deposit nanotubes of many semiconductors which can be prepared by electrodeposition.<br>
The method of synthesis of metal nanotube arrays described here exploits the basic principle of<br>
electrodeposition in a rotating electric field, which we believe has never been exploited in such<br>
2<br><br>
synthesis using electrodeposition. The novelty of this method lies in its generality, simplicity<br>
and efficiency. The method also opens up an avenue for structure formation by electrodeposition<br>
by controlling the ion dynamics. As a generic example, the synthesis of single crystalline copper<br>
nanotube arrays by electrodepositing copper into the pores of porous anodic alumina template is<br>
demonstrated.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of growing metal<br>
nanotube (MNT) arrays that are aligned in one direction.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a template method of growing MNT arrays<br>
that yields substantially uniform length and diameter and wall thickness of the MNT arrays.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to have a control on wall thickness of the MNT by<br>
easily controllable external parameters.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a template method of growing MNT<br>
arrays that yields pure MNT arrays.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to provide a template method of growing MNT<br>
arrays that is cost effective and easily adaptive to growth of such MNT arrays of wide variety of<br>
materials.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more obvious hereinafter in<br>
the specification and drawings.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a method of growing metal/compound nanotube arrays<br>
is based on the principle of 'programmed motion of the ions' and electrodeposition on the pore<br>
surface of cylindrical pores of nanoporous templates such as anodic aluminum oxide and<br>
polycarbonate porous membranes. As a generic example we report the synthesis of single<br>
crystalline copper nanotube arrays by electrodepositing copper into the pores of porous anodic<br>
alumina template and polycarbonate membranes in presence of a lateral rotating electric field<br>
which is applied in addition to the longitudinal DC electrodeposition current. The applied<br>
rotating electric field makes the ions graze the surface of the tube in a helical path and thus<br>
makes the deposition selectively occurring in the region near the wall of the nanopores.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to the drawings, FIG. 1A, 1B represent nanoporous membranes used as templates in<br>
the present invention. Most widely used nanoporous templates are Anodic Aluminum Oxide<br>
(AAO) and polycarbonate membranes. The AAO templates are usually prepared by a two step<br>
anodization process and their pore diameters within the range of l0nm to 200nm depending on<br>
the anodization voltage and other condition. Unlike the polycarbonate membranes, the AAO are<br>
very much ordered. AAO templates are used in the present invention for the synthesis of metal<br>
nanotube arrays.<br>
However, the invention is general enough that it can be adapted to a large class of nanoporous<br>
membranes that have arrays aligned pores with axial symmetry.<br>
Metal nanotube arrays are synthesized in pores of AAO template by controlling the ionic<br>
trajectories inside the pores in such a way that they are electrodeposited on the pore walls. This is<br>
achieved by electrodepositing the ions inside the pores in presence of an additional lateral<br>
rotating electric field. Thus the detailed experimental set up consists of mainly two parts.<br>
(1)	The basic electrodeposition set-up for nanowire growth.<br>
The nanowire growth set-up consists of the following parts<br>
(a)	SCE: Saturated Calomel Electrode as the reference electrode.<br>
(b)	Platinum counter electrode<br>
(c)	Basic electrodeposition cell.<br>
(2)	Rotating electric field set-up for changing the nanowire growth mechanism to nanotube<br>
growth.<br>
The first step in the synthesis of arrays of metal nanotubes in this invention consists of coating a<br>
silver/gold layer of 200nm thickness on one side of the porous Aluminum Oxide template. This<br>
5<br><br>
is shown in FIG. 1C, 1D. This silver or gold coating serves as the working electrode in the three<br>
electrode potentiostatic configuration of electrodeposition. The other two electrodes being a<br>
Saturated Calomel Electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode and a platinum electrode as the<br>
counter electrode. The typical designs of a Saturated Calomel Electrode (SCE) and the platinum<br>
counter electrode are shown in FIG. 2A and FIG. 2B respectively. FIG. 2C shows the combined<br>
arrangement of SCE reference electrode and the platinum counter electrode used in the present<br>
invention. FIG. 2D refers to the remaining parts of the electrodeposition cell. These consist of the<br>
glass or plastic vessel opened at the both ends, rubber O-ring, the porous Anodic alumina<br>
template with its silver/gold coated side facing the copper disc beneath it. The copper base serves<br>
as a good electrical contact to the silver/gold coating (working electrode) of AAO template.<br>
Electrical connections are made to the copper disc. The copper disc also gives good mechanical<br>
support to the AAO template. The rubber O-ring is placed on the top of the uncoated bare surface<br>
of the AAO template. The glass or plastic vessel is placed on the rubber O-ring in the same order<br>
as shown in FIG. 2D. The copper base disc and the glass vessel are now pressed using Teflon<br>
clamps (not shown in figure). A complete order of various parts of the electrodeposition cell are<br>
shown in FIG. 3A.<br>
A compact view of the electrodeposition cell with various parts at their respective meant<br>
positions is shown in FIG. 3B. FIG. 3C shows the electrode connections of the cell with the<br>
potentiostat for the electrodeposition. The glass/ plastic vessel remains pressed to the copper base<br>
disc with the help of a Teflon clamp in such a way that the O-ring takes care that no electrolyte<br>
comes out of the vessel and reaches the working electrode from outside. Thus the electrolyte has<br>
its only way to the working electrode through the nanopores of the AAO and hence the<br>
deposition takes place inside the pores. This is very efficient set up for making nanowires of<br>
materials which can be electrodeposited.<br>
The experimental scheme for producing rotating electric field is shown in FIG. 4A, which<br>
basically consists of two pairs of copper electrodes making the four sides of a square. A<br>
sinusoidally varying voltage (E0Sint) from a signal generator was applied to one of the pair of<br>
parallel copper electrodes facing each other. A signal with the same frequency and amplitude,<br>
phase shifted by /2 (E0Cost) was applied to the other pair of copper electrodes. The<br>
electrodeposition cell is placed in the middle of the four electrodes as shown in FIG. 4B.<br>
The electroeposition technique that is widely used to make metal nanowires in templates uses the<br>
deposition field which is essentially longitudinal so that they are along the axis of the pore.<br>
Present invention is based on the programmed motion of ions, i.e., to control the motion of ions<br>
during electrodeposition and restricting the ions to the walls of the pores. This is achieved by the<br>
rotating electric field which is always perpendicular to the electrodeposition field and thus the<br>
additional rotating field forces the ions to graze along the surface of the walls. The rotating<br>
electric field is produced by perpendicular superposition of two sinusoidal electric fields (of<br>
identical amplitude and frequency) to each other, differing by a phase of /2. This is in<br>
accordance with the Lissajous figures where two sinusoidal signals with identical amplitude and<br>
frequency give rise to a circle when superposed perpendicularly with a phase difference of /2.<br>
Since the pores to be filled have circular cross section, we used a phase difference of /2 between<br>
the lateral two sinusoidal fields. The various electric fields applied to achieve the desired<br>
deposition are shown in FIG. 6A.<br>
6<br><br>
The mechanism of the formation of nanotubes can be understood in the following way. Taking ,<br>
the mobility of ions, the velocity V of an ion in an electric field E is proportional to the velocity<br>
with , the mobility of the ion being the proportionality constant<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
These equations essentially imply<br><br>
So the motion of the ion due to the superposition of the electric fields follows a circular orbit<br>
with a radius R<br><br>
When the process of electrodeposition is started, an additional electric field EZ acts along the z-<br>
axis making the trajectory of each ion a helix. The radius of such a helix is given by R which can<br>
be easily be tailored by the field amplitude E0 and frequency (). A typical path is shown in FIG.<br>
5A. FIG.5B show the paths for 10 ions together. Thus each ion gets deposited following such a<br>
trajectory. The trajectory will also depend on the initial position, which we take as random to<br>
start with. Within the pores of the templates the motion of the ions gets constrained by the pore<br>
walls if the radius R is more than or equal to the pore radius. The trajectory of a single ion<br>
getting constrained inside a nanopore is shown in FIG. 5C. This way all ions, irrespective of their<br>
initial positions, upon reaching the pore walls will move stay close to the surface wall of the<br>
pores. FIG. 5E shows the trajectories of 10 ions getting constrained by the walls of the<br>
cylindrical nanopores of the template. Thus inside the template pores the ions always move close<br>
to the pore walls and result in the formation of a tube when they get discharged on the moving<br>
deposition front. In reality the actual electric field experienced by the ions is not constant but it<br>
varies being maximum at the pore surface and minimum at the axis of the pore and this is better<br>
understood by the Debye Screening length which is ~ nm at low ionic concentrations.<br>
Nevertheless, the ions still are able to reach the pore surface after revolving with gradually<br>
increasing radius and once they reach the surface they persist to move on the surface because of<br>
the high field near pore surface because of the high dielectric constant of the liquid and the<br>
relatively less dielectric constant of alumina.<br>
7<br><br>
A computer simulation of the experiment using the above model makes the mechanism further<br>
clear. Each ion, irrespective of its initial position (which is randomly chosen) traverses a helix<br>
grazing the surface of the pore before getting deposited when it comes in contact with the atoms<br>
of the working electrode or the growing deposition front. Formation of a nanotube with diameter<br>
~ 10nm, with 100000 atoms (whose initial positions and velocities are randomized) is shown in<br>
FIG. 5F. The nanotube so formed in the simulation has a wall thickness~2nm. This is a typical<br>
example of a metal nanotube formation.<br>
As a generic example, copper nanotube arrays formed are shown in FIG. 7A. These nanotubes<br>
are formed inside the nanoporous anodic alumina templates having pore diameters ~200nm.<br>
Since radius depends on the amplitude of individual electric fields used to create the<br>
lateral rotating electric field, a lower amplitude implies, a lower radius of the helix which an ion<br>
follows. Thus when the radius of the helix of an ion becomes lower than the radius of pores in<br>
the template, it results in many possible paths touching the pore walls as shown if FIG. 6C (a<br>
cross-sectional view of the paths). This result in increasing the wall thickness of the nanotube<br>
formed inside a nanopore. Thus the amplitude gives a control on the wall thickness of the<br>
nanotubes. Thick nanotubes formed with lower amplitudes of the rotating electric field are<br>
shown in FIG. 7C and FIG. 7D. These copper nanotube arrays are single crystalline in nature and<br>
they are electrically conducting. The resistance vs. temperature data of such an array of copper<br>
nanotube arrays with tube diameter ~200nm with wall thickness of 15-20nm is shown in FIG.<br>
7E.<br>
The principal benefit of this approach is that it is general, and it does not need any chemical<br>
modification or partial coating of the pores for synthesizing the nanotubes. The method also does<br>
not alter the chemistry of the standard electrodeposition that is used for a given material. It only<br>
changes the external electric field configuration, Thus it can be applied to the synthesis of any<br>
metal/compound nanotubes. The simulation of the method gives a physical insight of how metal<br>
nanotubes can be formed inside porous templates. To our knowledge this is the first method<br>
which is not only simple and fast but also based on designing the shape of an electrodeposited<br>
metal by controlling the ionic dynamics inside an electrolyte. The MNT have a constant wall<br>
thickness throughout the length as seen in TEM image FIG. 7F. Thus they can act as hollow<br>
nanoelectrodes and give options of filling them with other materials like semiconductors and<br>
high dielectric constant materials for such applications in fields like nanoelectronics, solar cells,<br>
supercapacitors etc.<br>
The advantages of the present invention are numerous. By constraining NT growth to pre-sized<br>
tubes (cylindrical pores); NT having uniform length, diameter and thickness can be grown easily<br>
and simply. The process yields arrays of NT arrays embedded inside the nanopores of the<br>
template, which can be technologically exploited for applications such as catalysis,<br>
nanoelectronics, solar cells, supercapacitors etc. This inexpensive, simple, efficient method of<br>
growing NT arrays is fastest method of synthesizing NT arrays ever reported.<br>
