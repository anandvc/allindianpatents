COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
A Process for making a Novel Pharmaceutical Composition of a Proton Pump inhibitor with a Prokinetic Agent<br>
M/s Aristo Pharmaceutical Ltd 23-A, Shah Industrial Estate, Off Veera Desai road, Andheri (W), Mumbai - 400 053.<br>
Name of the inventors -<br>
1)   Mr. Manutosh Manohar Acharya, Indian, residing at 4/7, Amaitas Parisar Shahpura, Bhopal (MP), India.<br>
The following complete specification describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
ORG<br><br>
A Process for making a Novel Pharmaceutical Composition of a Proton Pump Inhibitor with a Prokinetic Agent<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(01)	Gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD), reflux oesophagitis, peptic ulcer,<br>
gastric ulcer and other gastric acid related disorders are disorders having a pathogenesis<br>
related to reduced gastric motility, i.e., reduced clearing capacity of the stomach, and<br>
release of excessive gastric acid. Besides from behavioral changes, GERD and gastric<br>
ulcer have been successfully treated with a range of gastric acid inhibitors, such as<br>
ranitidine and omeprazole, which are known as H2 blocker or acid-suppressing drugs.<br>
Stimulation of gastric motility has been proposed to accelerate the healing of gastric<br>
ulcer. Prokinetic drugs, such as itopride, cisapride, are known to enhance gastrointestinal<br>
motility and prevent duodenogastric reflux, and are widely used to treat GERD.<br>
Ranitidine and prokinetic drugs have been used in combination to treat gastric ulcer and<br>
other related disorders.<br>
(2)	H2 receptor antagonists are widely prescribed for GERD. Their higher cost has been compensated by the clinical results obtained both in terms of symptom relief and healing. These advantages have been related to their mode of action, which offered more potent and longer duration of effect on gastric acidity.<br>
(3)	Pyridin-2-ylmethylsulfinyl-lH-benzimidazoles, as disclosed, for example, in EP-A 0005129, EP-A 0166287 and EP-A 0268956 are becoming increasingly important, because of their H+/K+ ATPase-inhibiting action, for the therapy of diseases, which<br><br>
originate from increased gastric acid secretion. The present invention comprises of proton pump inhibitor is pantoprazole. The pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate is expressed as pantoprazole. The pantoprazole and or its salts here after will be termed as "pantoprazole".<br>
(004)	Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor, which rapidly takes share from H2<br>
receptor antagonists, particularly in reflux oesophagitis and healing and prevention of<br>
relapse for reflux oesophagitis.<br>
(5)	Itopride, i. e., N-[p-[2-(dimethylamino) ethoxy] benzyl] veratramide hydrochloride, CAS Registry no 1222898-67-3 is a gastrointestinal prokinetic agent. Itopride hydrochloride and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts will be here after termed as. "itopride". Itopride increases the release of acetylcholine (ACh) through dopamine D2-receptor antagonistic action and inhibits decomposing released ACh through its acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibitory action, resulting in enhancement of gastrointestinal motility.<br>
(6)	A combination therapy comprising an acid suppressing agent and a prokinetic agent is attractive, rational and effective. An acid suppressing agent plus a prokinetic agent could be an alternative to each of them separately in case of failure. However, because of the large number of therapeutical tablets/pills that must be taken each day in such a therapy, the compliance of such a treatment may be a problem. It is well known that patient compliance is a main factor in receiving good results in medical treatments. Administration of two, three or even more different tablets to the patient is not convenient or satisfactory to achieve the most optimal results. The present invention now provides new oral dosage forms comprising two different active substances combined in one fixed unit dosage form, preferably tablet and blend/ granule in a capsule.<br>
(7)	The US Patent 6,132,771 discloses oral pharmaceutical composition comprising a proton pump inhibitor &amp; a prokinetic agent, the proton pump inhibitor claimed is omeprazole &amp; its salt and proknetic agent is Mosapride and Cisapride, the dosage form is<br>
2<br><br>
a multiple unit tableted dosage forms, multilayered tablets, or a capsule filled with more than one pharmaceutically active compound but both in conver|tional dosage form. The dose for proton pump inhibitor mentioned here is omeprazole is the dose is 10/20mg once a day and prokinetic agent mosapride is to be given 5mg thrice a day hence combining the two will have problem of dose adjustment and frequency.<br>
Our patent discloses once a day dosage form containing proton pump inhibitor Pantoprazole 20 /40 mg with Itopride 150 mg SR, which eliminates the problem of dose adjustment &amp; frequency.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
(8)	The present invention comprises co-administration of a proton pump inhibitor, pantoprazole and a prokinetic agent, itopride in a single unit formulation, wherein the proton pump inhibitor and prokinetic agents are formulated and presented in a manner to minimize interaction of pantoprazole with itopride and a single unit dosage form to deliver a enteric coated proton pump inhibitor Pantoprazole along with the immediate release and or sustained/controlled/floating gastroretentive sustained or controlled release prokinetic agent Itopride.<br>
(9)	It is well known that some of the gastric acid suppressing agents, such as proton pump inhibitors are susceptible to degradation/transformation in acid reacting and neutral media. In respect of the stability properties, it is obvious that the one of the active substances being an acid susceptible proton pump inhibitor must be protected from contact with acidic gastric juice by an enteric coating layer.<br>
(10)	There are problems to produce a fixed unit dosage form comprising a rather high amount of active substance. Different active substances with differing physical properties in the same preparation give further problems. In order to obtain a pharmaceutical dosage form of pantoprazole, which prevents it from contact with the itopride and acidic gastric juice, the pantoprazole must be enteric coated or delayed release.<br>
(11)	In order to enhance the storage stability of the enteric coated tablet of pantoprazole, the cores of the tablet must also contain alkalizing agent. When such an alkaline core is enteric coated with an amount of a conventional enteric coating polymer such as, for example, cellulose acetate phthalate, that permits the dissolution of the coating and the active drug contained in the cores in the proximal part of the small intestine, it also will allow some diffusion of water of gastric juice through the enteric coating into the cores, during the time the dosage form resides in the stomach before it is emptied into the small intestine. The diffused water of gastric juice will dissolve parts of the core in the close proximity of the enteric coating layer and there form an alkaline solution inside the<br>
4<br><br>
coated dosage form. The alkaline nature of core will interfere with the enteric coating and eventually dissolve it. The 3-4% of the seal coat of hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose is done in order to prevent the incompatibility of the alkaline nature of the core with the enteric coating.<br>
5<br>
(012) The present invention contains a single unit dosage form of a capsule which contains two parts (tablet and blend/granules in a capsule), first part comprises of a proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole with pharmaceutically acceptable excipient and alkalizing agent compressed in tablet and it is enteric coated and second part comprises of the blend and or granules of itopride with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients in a single unit formulation.<br><br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
(013)	Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor, which rapidly takes share from H2<br>
receptor antagonists, particularly in reflux oesophagitis and healing and prevention of<br>
relapse for reflux oesophagitis. Itopride increases the release of acetylcholine (ACh)<br>
through dopamine D2-receptor antagonistic action and inhibits decomposing released<br>
ACh through its acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibitory action, resulting in<br>
enhancement of gastrointestinal motility.<br>
(14)	A combination therapy comprising an acid suppressing agent and a prokinetic agent is attractive, rational and effective. An acid suppressing agent plus a prokinetic agent could be an alternative to each of them separately in case of failure. However, because of the large number of therapeutical tablets/pills that must be taken each day in such a therapy, the compliance of such a treatment may be a problem. It is well known that patient compliance is a main factor in receiving good results in medical treatments. Administration of two, three or even more different tablets to the patient is not convenient or satisfactory to achieve the most optimal results. The present invention now provides new oral dosage forms comprising two different active substances combined in one fixed unit dosage form, preferably tablet and blend/ granule in a capsule.<br>
(15)	The compatibility (physical and chemical) study was done taking suitable ratio of itopride hydrochloride and Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate with the individual excipients and the combination drugs. The sample mixtures were blended and triturated gently in glass mortar and pestle and these were filled in glass vials and sealed with high viscosity polyethylene closures. Few pinholes were made on the cap for maintaining the relative humidity and the vials were placed on 40° C ± 2° C / 75 % ± 5% RH. Samples were analysed on differential scanning calorimeter and visually for initially, and at the interval of 15 days for one month. The results were compared to check the compatibility (physical and chemical) of the drug with excipients. It was found that the vials containing drug and excipients blend triturate were satisfactory in appearance as compared to individual control samples.<br>
6<br><br>
(16)	In order to screen for formulation stability we have formulated five different types of process for the formulation. The analysis of pantoprazole part was done by HPLC (Make: Agilent 1100 series) using 4.6 X 250 mm, Hypersil BDS C18, 5 u. column using buffer and acetonitrile as mobile phase in ratio of 62:38 respectively and detection was done at 280 nm. The analysis of itopride sustained release part was done by HPLC (Make: Agilent 1100 series) using 4.6 X 150 mm, ds, Zorbax XBD column using buffer (prepared 0.01M potassium di-hydrogen orthophosphatebuffer and adjusted the pH3.0 with diluted ortho-phosphoric acid) and acetonitrile as mobile phase in ratio of 80:20 respectively and detection was done at 260 nm.The stability studies were done as per ICH guidelines for 6 months.<br>
(17)	The dissolution testing of pantoprazole enteric coated tablet part was carried out in 0.1 N hydrochloric acid for 2 hrs and in phosphate buffer pH 6.8 for 45 minutes. As per United States Pharmacopoeia criteria the quantity of the dissolution medium used should be not less than three times that required to form a saturated solution of the drug substance, which complies when used 0.1 N HC1 for itopride hydrochloride, based on the solubility equilibrium of the drug substance. The dissolution of dosage forms carried out by using 900 ml 0.1 N HC1 which complies with the sink conditions mentioned in USP. (Ref. USP/NF, Vol. 27, 2004 Page no. 2514).<br>
Example 1<br>
Pantoprazole 20mg//40 mg delayed release + Itopride 150 mg sustained release Capsule<br>
(018)	The present invention contains a single unit dosage form of a capsule which<br>
contains two parts (tablet and blend/granules in a capsule), first part comprises of a<br>
proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole with pharmaceutically acceptable excipient and<br>
alkalizing agent compressed in tablet and it is enteric coated and second part comprises of<br>
the sustained release or controlled release blend and or granules of itopride with<br>
7<br><br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients in a single unit formulation which releases the drug within 8-12 hours to maintain a prolonged duration of action.<br>
(019) Pantoprazole enteric coated tablet formulation comprises alkaline excipients. Pantoprazole, mannitol, sodium carbonate anhydrous, crosspovidone, sodium lauryl sulphate, sieved through 60 no. mesh and blended for 5 minutes. HPMC E06 was dissolved in purified water to make 10 % w/v solution and the above blend was granulated. The granules were passed from mesh no. 8, air dried and then dried at 40° C till the loss on drying (LOD) of desired value reached of NMT 3.0 % (Make: Mettler Toledo LJ16 moisture analyzer) at 105° C. The dried granules were sieved through 20 mesh. Finally Crospovidone, Calcium Stearate, Sodium Lauryl Sulphate, Colloidal Silicon dioxide (passed through 60 no. mesh) were added and the whole mixture blended for 5 minutes. The tablets were compressed on 16 station compression machine (Make:Cadmach). The hardness of tablets found to be 3-5 kg/cm2.<br>
