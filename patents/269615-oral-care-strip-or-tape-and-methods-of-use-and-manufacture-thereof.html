				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION ORAL CARE STRIP OR TAPE AND METHODS OF USE AND MANUFACTURE<br>
THEREOF BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
 [0001]       The formation of dental plaque is a source of gingival and periodontal disease and subsequent tooth loss. Dental plaque is a mixed matrix of bacteria, epithelial cells, leukocytes, macrophages and other oral exudate. Bacteria comprise approximately three-quarters of the plaque matrix. Any given sample of dental plaque could contain as many as 400 different varieties of microorganisms. This mix includes both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, fungi and protozoa. Viruses have also been found in samples of dental plaque.<br>
[0002]       This matrix of organisms and oral exudate continues expanding and coalesces with other plaque growths situated nearby. The bacteria synthesize levans and glucans from sucrose found in the oral cavity providing energy for the microorganisms. These glucans, levans and microorganisms form an adhesive skeleton for the continued proliferation of plaque.<br>
[0003]       Calculus is a yellow or white mineralized deposit of bacterial plaque. Inorganic in nature, calculus consists primarily of calcium and magnesium phosphate and calcium carbonate. Calculus forms in layers as does plaque and is simply the mineralization of plaque's layered bacteria. Calculus is formed when plaque's protein-carbohydrate matrix accumulates calcium followed by the precipitation and mineralization of crystalline calcium phosphate. Once mineralized calculus is formed, another layer of bacteria adheres to the surface forming yet another layer of plaque which is subsequently mineralized into calculus. [0004]       The failure to retard or stop the proliferation of plaque is detrimental to oral health. Plaque formation leads to dental caries, gingival inflammation, periodontal disease and ultimately tooth loss.   The present inventors recognize these problems and have developed a composition suitable for combating oral disease, preventing tooth loss, and leading to general oral well-being. [0005]       While the prior art discloses the use of various oral compositions for combating plaque, there is still a need for additional formulations, which provide greater availability, improved performance in combating oral disease along with<br>
increased user acceptance. The present inventors have discovered the use of traditional dentifrice ingredients in a base in order to create a non-traditional, portable and consumer desirable toothtape.<br>

[0033]       Illustrative examples of agents that increase the amount of foam include, but are not limited to polyoxyethylene and certain polymers including, but not limited to, alginate polymers.<br>
[0034]       The polyoxyethylene may increase the amount of foam and the thickness of the foam generated by the oral care carrier component of the present invention. Polyoxyethylene is also commonly known as polyethylene glycol ("PEG") or polyethylene oxide. The polyoxyethylenes suitable for this invention will have a molecular weight of about 200,000 to about 7,000,000. In one embodiment the molecular weight will be from about 600,000 to about 2,000,000 and in another embodiment from about 800,000 to about 1,000,000. Polyox® is the trade name for the high molecular weight polyoxyethylene produced by Union Carbide.<br>
[0035]       The polyoxyethylene may be present in an amount from about 1% to 90%, in one embodiment from about 5% to 50% and in another embodiment from about 10% to 20% by weight of the oral care carrier component of the oral care compositions of the present invention.   The dosage of foaming agent in the individual strip or tape (i.e., a single dose) is about 0.01 to 0.9 % by weight, 0.05 to 0.5% by weight, and in another embodiment about 0.1 to 0.2 % by weight.<br>
[0036]       Another agent optionally included in the oral care tape or strips of the invention is a surfactant or a mixture of compatible surfactants. Suitable surfactants are those which are reasonably stable throughout a wide pH range, for example, anionic, cationic, nonionic or zwitterionic surfactants.<br>
[0037]       Suitable surfactants are described more fully, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,959,458, to Agricola et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 3,937,807, to Haefele; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,051,234, to Gieske et al., which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0038]       In certain embodiments, the anionic surfactants useful herein include the water-soluble salts of alkyl sulfates having from 10 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical and the water-soluble salts of sulfonated monoglycerides of fatty acids having from 10 to 18 carbon atoms. Sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate and sodium coconut monoglyceride sulfonates are examples of anionic surfactants of this type. Mixtures of anionic surfactants may also be utilized.<br>
[0039]       In another embodiment, cationic surfactants useful in the present invention can be broadly defined as derivatives of aliphatic quaternary ammonium compounds having one long alkyl chain containing from about 8 to 18 carbon atoms such as lauryl trimethylammonium chloride, cetyl pyridinium chloride, cetyl trimethylammonium bromide, di-isobutylphenoxyethyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride, coconut alkyltrimethylammonium nitrite, cetyl pyridinium fluoride, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0040]       Illustrative cationic surfactants are the quaternary ammonium fluorides described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,535,421, to Briner et al., herein incorporated by reference. Certain cationic surfactants can also act as germicides in the compositions.<br>
[0041]       Illustrative nonionic surfactants that can be used in the compositions of the invention can be broadly defined as compounds produced by the condensation of alkylene oxide groups (hydrophilic in nature) with an organic hydrophobic compound which may be aliphatic or alkylaromatic in nature. Examples of suitable nonionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, the Pluronics, polyethylene oxide condensates of alkyl phenols, products derived from the condensation of ethylene oxide with the reaction product of propylene oxide and ethylene diamine, ethylene oxide condensates of aliphatic alcohols, long chain tertiary amine oxides, long chain tertiary phosphine oxides, long chain dialkyl sulfoxides and mixtures of such materials.<br>
[0042]       In certain embodiments, zwitterionic synthetic surfactants useful in the present invention can be broadly described as derivatives of aliphatic quaternary ammonium, phosphomium, and sulfonium compounds, in which the aliphatic radicals can be straight chain or branched, and wherein one of the aliphatic substituents contains from about 8 to 18 carbon atoms and one contains an anionic water-solubilizing group, e.g., carboxy, sulfonate, sulfate, phosphate or phosphonate. Illustrative examples of the surfactants suited for inclusion into the composition include, but are not limited to, sodium alkyl sulfate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, cocoamidopropyl betaine and polysorbate 20, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0043]       The surfactant or mixtures of compatible surfactants can be present in the compositions of the present invention from about 0.1% to about 5.0%, in another<br>
embodiment from about 0.3% to about 3.0% and in another embodiment from about 0.5% to about 2.0% by weight of the total composition.   The dosage of surfactant in the individual strip or tape (i.e., a single dose) is about 0.001 to 0.05% by weight, 0.003 to 0.03% by weight, and in another embodiment about 0.005 to 0.02 % by weight.<br>
[0044]       The oral care strips or tape compositions of the invention may also include a flavoring agent.   Flavoring agents which are used in the practice of the present invention include, but are not limited to, essential oils as well as various flavoring aldehydes, esters, alcohols, and similar materials. Examples of the essential oils include oils of spearmint, peppermint, wintergreen, sassafras, clove, sage, eucalyptus, marjoram, cinnamon, lemon, lime, grapefruit, and orange. Also useful are such chemicals as menthol, carvone, and anethole.   Certain embodiments employ the oils of peppermint and spearmint.<br>
[0045]       The flavoring agent is incorporated in the oral composition at a concentration of about 0.1 to about 5% by weight and about 0.5 to about 1.5% by weight. The dosage of flavoring agent in the individual strip or tape (i.e., a single dose) is about 0.001 to 0.05% by weight and in another embodiment about 0.005 to 0.015 % by weight.<br>
[0046]       The oral care strips or tape compositions of the invention may also include one or more adhesive agents to aid the tape or strip to adhere to the tissues of the oral cavity. Suitable adhesives include, but are not limited to, both polymers with limited water solubility as well as polymers lacking water solubility. These polymers deposit a thin film on both the oral cavity's soft and hard tissues when saliva combines with the instant composition. Suitable limited water solubility adhesives include, but are not limited to, hydroxy ethyl or propyl cellulose. Adhesives lacking water solubility and suitable for the compositions of the invention include, but are not limited to, ethyl cellulose, polyox resins and silicones. Adhesives lacking water solubility are incorporated into the instant invention by using a small amount of ethyl alcohol or another alcohol safe for use in the oral cavity and the human body.<br>
[0047]       Another possible adhesive suitable for use in the instant composition is<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone ("PVP") with a molecular weight of about 50,000 to about 300,000, a suitable PVP is available from GAF Chemicals Corporation.<br>
[0048]       Still another possible adhesive suitable for use in the instant composition is a combination of Gantrez and the semisynthetic, water-soluble polymer carboxymethyl cellulose ("CMC").   Certain embodiments encompass a mixture of 2:1 to 1:1 (Gantrez to CMC). Suitable for use in the combination is Gantrez with a M.W. of about 30,000 to about 1,000,000 available from GAF Chemicals Corporation and CMC with a M.W. of about 90,000 to about 700,000 available from Aqualon Company.<br>
[0049]       The oral care strips or tape compositions of the invention also may optionally include one or more chelating agents able to complex calcium found in the cell walls of the bacteria. Binding of this calcium weakens the bacterial cell wall and augments bacterial lysis.<br>
[0050]       Another group of agents suitable for use as chelating agents in the present invention are the soluble pyrophosphates. The pyrophosphate salts used in the present compositions can be any of the alkali metal pyrophosphate salts. In certain embodiments, salts include tetra alkali metal pyrophosphate, dialkali metal diacid pyrophosphate, trialkali metal monoacid pyrophosphate and mixtures thereof, wherein the alkali metals are sodium or potassium. The salts are useful in both their hydrated and unhydrated forms. An effective amount of pyrophosphate salt useful in the present composition is generally enough to provide at least 1.0% pyrophosphate ions, from about 1.5% to about 6%, from about 3.5% to about 6% of such ions. The dosage chelating agent in the individual strip or tape (i.e., a single dose) is about 0.01 to 0.6% by weight and in another embodiment about 0.035 to 0.06 % by weight.<br>
[0051]       The oral care strips or tape compositions of the invention also optionally include one or more polymers. Such materials are well known in the art, being employed in the form of their free acids or partially or fully neutralized water soluble alkali metal (e.g. potassium and sodium) or ammonium salts. Certain embodiments include 1:4 to 4:1 copolymers of maleic anhydride or acid with another polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer, for example, methyl vinyl ether<br>
(methoxyethylene) having a molecular weight (M.W.) of about 30,000 to about 1,000,000. These copolymers are available for example as Gantrez AN 139(M.W. 500,000), AN 119 (M.W. 250,000) and S-97 Pharmaceutical Grade (M.W. 70,000), of GAF Chemicals Corporation.<br>
[0052]       Other operative polymers include those such as the 1:1 copolymers of maleic anhydride with ethyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, N-vinyl-2-pyrollidone, or ethylene, the latter being available for example as Monsanto EMA No. 1103, M.W. 10,000 and EMA Grade 61, and 1:1 copolymers of acrylic acid with methyl or hydroxyethyl methacrylate, methyl or ethyl acrylate, isobutyl vinyl ether or N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone.<br>
[0053]       Suitable generally, are polymerized olefinically or ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids containing an activated carbon-to-carbon olefinic double bond and at least one carboxyl group, that is, an acid containing an olefinic double bond which readily functions in polymerization because of its presence in the monomer molecule either in the alpha-beta position with respect to a carboxyl group or as part of a terminal methylene grouping. Illustrative of such acids are acrylic, methacrylic, ethacrylic, alpha-chloroacrylic, crotonic, beta-acryloxy propionic, sorbic, alpha-chlorsorbic, cinnamic, beta-styrylacrylic, muconic, itaconic, citraconic, mesaconic, glutaconic, aconitic, alpha-phenylacrylic, 2-benzyl acrylic, 2-cyclohexylacrylic, angelic, umbellic, fumaric, maleic acids and anhydrides. Other different olefinic monomers copolymerizable with such carboxylic monomers include vinylacetate, vinyl chloride, dimethyl maleate and the like. Copolymers contain sufficient carboxylic salt groups for water-solubility.<br>
[0054]       A further class of polymeric agents includes a composition containing homopolymers of substituted acrylamides and/or homopolymers of unsaturated sulfonic acids and salts thereof, in particular where polymers are based on unsaturated sulfonic acids selected from acrylamidoalykane sulfonic acids such as 2-acrylamide 2 methylpropane sulfonic acid having a molecular weight from 1,000-2,000,000, described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,842,847, Jun. 27,1989 to Zahid, incorporated herein by reference.<br>

particularly those containing proportions of anionic surface-active amino acids such as aspattic acid, glutamic acid and phosphoserine, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,866,161 Sikes et al., incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0056]       The oral care strips or tape compositions of the invention may also optionally include one or more enzymes.   Useful enzymes include any of the available proteases, glucanohydrolases, endoglycosidases, amylases, mutanases, lipases and mucinases or compatible mixtures thereof.   In certain embodiments, the enzyme is a protease, dextranase, endoglycosidase and mutanase. In another embodiment, the enzyme is papain, endoglycosidase or a mixture of dextranase and mutanase. Additional enzymes suitable for use in the present invention are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,000,939 to Dring et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,420; U.S. Pat. No. 4,355,022; U.S. Pat. No. 4,154,815; U.S. Pat. No. 4,058,595; U.S. Pat. No. 3,991,177; and U.S. Pat. No. 3,696,191 all incorporated herein by reference. An enzyme of a mixture of several compatible enzymes in the current invention constitutes from about 0.002% to about 2.0% in one embodiment or from about 0.05% to about 1.5% in another embodiment or in yet another embodiment from about 0.1% to about 0.5%.<br>
[0057]       Water may also be present in the oral compositions of the invention. Water, employed in the preparation of commercial oral compositions should be deionized and free of organic impurities. Water commonly makes up the balance of the compositions and includes from about 10% to 50%, about 20% to 40% or about 10% to 15% by weight of the oral compositions. This amount of water includes the free water which is added plus that amount which is introduced with other materials such as with sorbitol or any components of the invention.<br>
[0058]       In preparing oral care strips or tape compositions, it is sometimes necessary to add some thickening material to provide a desirable consistency. In certain embodiments, the thickening agents are carboxyvinyl polymers, carrageenan, hydroxyethyl cellulose and water soluble salts of cellulose ethers such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose. Natural gums such as karaya, gum arabic, and gum tragacanth can also be incorporated. Colloidal magnesium aluminum silicate or finely divided silica can be used as component of the thickening composition to further improve the composition's<br>
texture. Thickening agents in an amount from 0.5% to 5.0% by weight of the total composition can be used.<br>
[0059]       Within certain embodiments of the oral compositions, it is also desirable to incorporate a humectant to prevent the composition from hardening upon exposure to air. Certain humectants can also impart desirable sweetness or flavor to dentifrice compositions. The humectant, on a pure humectant basis, generally includes from about 15% to 70% in one embodiment or from about 30% to 65% in another embodiment by weight of the dentifrice composition.<br>
[0060]       Suitable humectants include edible polyhydric alcohols such as glycerine, sorbitol, xylitol, propylene glycol as well as other polyols and mixtures of these humectants. Mixtures of glycerine and sorbitol may be used in certain embodiments as the humectant component of the toothpaste compositions herein.<br>
[0061]       In addition to the above described components, the embodiments of this invention can contain a variety of optional dentifrice ingredients some of which are described below. Optional ingredients include, for example, but are not limited to, adhesives, sudsing agents, flavoring agents, sweetening agents, additional antiplaque agents, abrasives, and coloring agents. These and other optional components are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,004,597, to Majeti; U.S. Pat. No. 3,959,458 to Agricola et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 3,937,807, to Haefele, all being incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0062]       The compositions of the present invention can be made using methods which are common in the oral product area.<br>
[0063]       In one illustrative embodiment, the toothtape is made by dissolving acrylate copolymers and PVP In ethanol and mixing for 2 minutes at 2600 rpm to form Premix 1.<br>
[0064]       Actives such as, for example, vitamins, CPC, fluoride, abrasives, and any other desired active ingredients are added to Premix 1 and mixed for 2 minutes at 2600 rpm to form Premix 2.<br>
[0065]       A toothpaste base is added to Premix 2 and mixed for 2 minutes at 3000 rpm. The final slurry is cast on hydrophobic surface with approximately 0.2 mm wet<br>
thickness. Film is dried in air-circulating oven at about 175-180 °C for 1-2 hr.<br>
[0066]       The present invention in its method aspect involves applying to the oral cavity a safe and effective amount of the compositions described herein. These amounts, for example, from about 20 mm2 to 2000 mm2 of the strip or tape, is kept in the mouth from about 15 seconds to about 12 hours. In addition, the oral care strip or tape can be left alone to clean the teeth or can be used with a brush.<br>
