				<td>FIBER FORMING BUSHING ASSEMBLY<br>
HAVING FLANGE SUPPORT<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates in general to fiber forming bushing assemblies and more<br>
particularly to a fiber forming bushing assembly having a flange support.<br>
Fiber forming bushing assemblies are well known in the prior art. An example of a<br>
prior art bushing assembly is illustrated in Fig. 1. The bushing assembly shown comprises<br>
a bushing 16, a frame 18 about the bushing 16, and a refractory material 20 between the<br>
bushing 16 and the frame 18. A throat 30 is provided at the top of the bushing 16. A<br>
flange 34 is provided about the throat 30. A cooling coil 40 is attached to the flange 34.<br>
The bushing 16 has a body 21 that is defined in a lateral direction by opposing end plates<br>
22 and in a longitudinal direction by elongate side walls 24. The end plates 22 extend<br>
downward in a generally vertical direction. Upper portions 38 of the side walls 24 are<br>
slanted or angled outward and beneath the flange 34 while lower portions of the side walls<br>
24 extend downward in a generally vertical direction.<br>
In a fiber forming operation, the bushing assembly is secured beneath a bushing<br>
block 12 at a forming position by clamping the frame 18 to a forehearth steel (not shown).<br>
The flange 34 is adapted to engage an underside of the bushing block 12. Molten glass G<br>
flows from the bushing block 12 into the throat 30 of the bushing 16. The molten glass G<br>
exits the bushing 16 (for example, as glass fibers F) through tip plates 26 provided at the<br>
bottom of the bushing 16.<br>
Ideally, the flange 34 extends perpendicularly from the throat 30 and parallel<br>
relative to the underside of the bushing block 12. An upper surface of the flange 34 is<br>
adapted to engage the underside of the bushing block 12 so as to provide a seal between<br>
the flange 34 and the bushing block 12 to prevent molten glass G from escaping or leaking<br>
between the flange 34 and the bushing block 12. In some instances, a small amount of<br>
molten glass G may leak between the flange 34 and the bushing block 12. However, the<br>
temperature of this small amount of glass G drops significantly as it passes between the<br>
flange 34 and the bushing block 12 and approaches the cooling coil 40 (that is, heat for the<br>
molten glass G dissipates into the cooling coil 40). Molten glass G that reaches the edge<br>
of the flange 34 is solidified due to the effect of the cooling coil 40. The solidified glass<br>
forms a seal to prevent the molten glass G from flowing any further.<br>
Various size bushings are required, depending on the production requirements (for<br>
example, the number of fibers F being formed). The bushing 16 shown has two tip plates<br>
26 and, consequently, is a wider bushing. That is to say, the bushing 16 has greater<br>
dimension from front to back or a lateral direction of the bushing 16 (from left to right, or<br>
vice versa, when viewing Fig. 1). The upper portion 44 of each side wall 24 of this<br>
bushing 16 is at a tighter angle relative to the flange 34 than a narrower bushing.<br>
Therefore, very little clearance is provided between the flange 34 and the cooling coil 40<br>
and the upper portion 44 of each side wall 24. Consequently, it is more difficult to ensure<br>
continuous backfill of refractory material 20 in the area or cavity defined between the<br>
flange 34 and the cooling coil 40 and the upper portion 44 of each side wall 24. A more<br>
continuous backfill can be achieved by raising the moisture content of the refractory<br>
material 20. However, an increased moisture level of the refractory material 20 has an<br>
adverse affect on the strength and integrity of the refractory material 20. Such refractory<br>
material tends to crack and separate from the bushing 16 and frame 18, resulting in<br>
premature failure of the bushing 16.<br>
A discontinuous backfill results in the presence of voids V in the refractory<br>
material 20. The voids V weaken the support provided by the refractory material 20.<br>
Downward forces from the molten glass G against the bushing screen, clamping pressure,<br>
and gravitational force cause plastic and/or creep deformation of the flange 34 and the<br>
upper portion 44 of each side 24. This causes the flange 34 to separate or pull away from<br>
the bushing block 12, as illustrated in Fig. 1 of the prior art. When the flange 34 separates<br>
from the bushing block 12, more molten glass G can penetrate between the flange 34 and<br>
the bushing block 12. As the amount of molten glass G penetrating between the flange 34<br>
and the bushing block 12 increases, the molten glass G does not cool sufficiently by the<br>
time it reaches the edge of the flange 34. Consequently, the molten glass G between the<br>
flange 34 and the bushing block 12 is at a heightened temperature. The cooling coil 40 is<br>
not designed to cool molten glass G at the heightened temperature. Consequently, the<br>
molten glass G leaks beyond the edge of the flange 34 and the cooling coil 40 and results<br>
in a premature failure of the bushing 16.<br><br>
What is needed is a support that provides greater subjacent support for the<br>
peripheral flange in a longitudinal direction of the bushing to prevent the flange from<br>
sagging and thus prevent molten glass from leaking between the flange and the bushing<br>
block, thereby eliminating premature failures and prolonging the life of the bushing.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed toward a fiber forming bushing assembly<br>
comprising a bushing and a support. The bushing includes a bushing body and a flange.<br>
The bushing body is defined at least in part by a throat and a side wall beneath the throat.<br>
The side wall has an upper portion. The flange extends from the throat. The support is<br>
positioned between the flange and an upper portion of the side wall. The support is<br>
formed of a ceramic material.<br>
The present invention is also directed toward a fiber forming bushing assembly<br>
having a bushing body defined at least in part by a throat, opposing end plates extending in<br>
a lateral direction, and elongated side walls extending in a longitudinal direction. The end<br>
plates and side walls are beneath the throat. Each side wall has an upper portion. The<br>
flange extends from the triroat. The flange comprises a lateral portion and an elongate<br>
portion. A support is positioned between each of the elongate portions of the flange and<br>
the upper portion of a corresponding one of the side walls. Each support is formed of a<br>
ceramic material.<br>
Various objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment,<br>
when read in light of the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring now to the drawings, there is illustrated in Fig. 2 a fiber forming position<br>
10 comprising a bushing block 12 and a bushing assembly 14. The bushing assembly 14<br>
basically comprises a bushing 16, a frame 18 about the bushing 16, and a refractory<br>
material 20 (for example, a castable refractory material) between the frame 18 and the<br>
bushing 16. The frame 18 is secured beneath the bushing block 12 by clamping the frame<br>
18 to a forehearth steel (not shown). Molten glass G is supplied to the bushing 16 through<br>
the bushing block 12. The molten glass G passes through the bushing 16 and exits the<br>
bushing 16 in the form of fibers F (for example, glass fibers).<br>
The bushing 16 is basically comprised of an electrically conductive bushing body<br>
21 and an electrically conductive screen located within the bushing body 21. In a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, the bushing body 21 is in the form of a metal box having an<br>
elongate, substantially rectangular shape. The bushing body 21 is defined in part by<br>
opposing end plates 22 and elongate side walls 24 extending between the end plates 22.<br>
The bottom of the bushing body 21 is defined by a tip plate 26 having a plurality of<br>
orifices (not shown) formed therein, preferably including tubular members 28, as described<br>
in commonly-assigned U.S. Patent No. 4,161,646, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference. The tip plate 26 extends in a side to side or longitudinal direction between the<br>
end plates 22 and a front to rear or lateral direction between the side walls 24. An opening<br>
is provided at the top of the bushing body 21 for receiving the molten glass G from the<br>
bushing block 12. The opening is defined by a throat 30.<br>
A pair of opposing electrical terminals or ears 32 is attached to the opposing end<br>
plates 22. The ears 32 are adapted to be connected to a source of current (not shown).<br>
Current is adapted to flow through the ears 32 and further into and through the bushing<br>
body 21 to resistance heat the bushing body 21 and thereby maintain the glass G under the<br>
desired thermal condition.<br>
A flange 34 extends from the throat 30 at the top of the bushing body 21. The<br>
flange 34 includes a lateral portion 36 that extends in the lateral direction adjacent each of<br>
the end plates 22 and an elongate portion 38 that extends in the longitudinal direction<br>
adjacent each of the elongate side walls 24. The flange 34 engages an underside of the<br>
bushing block 12 to form a. seal between the bushing block 12 and the flange 34 to prevent<br><br>
molten glass G from escaping or leaking from between the bushing block 12 and the flange<br>
34.<br>
To further reduce the risk that molten glass G will escape from between the<br>
bushing block 12 and the flange 34, a cooling coil 40 is attached to the flange 34 (for<br>
example, with metal tabs 41 that are welded to the flange 34). In a preferred embodiment<br>
of the invention, the cooling coil 40 is a continuous cooling coil that is attached to an outer<br>
peripheral edge of the flange 34.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a support 42 is positioned beneath the<br>
flange 34 in an area or cavity defined between each elongate portion 38 of the flange 34<br>
and an upper portion 44 of each side wall 24. The support 42 is positioned juxtaposed the<br>
throat 30 of the bushing body 21 and beneath the flange 34 to provide lateral support for<br>
the throat 30 and subjacent support for the flange 34.<br>
The upper portion 44 of each side wall 24 is disposed at an acute angle 6 relative to<br>
the corresponding elongate portion 38 of the flange 34. The measure of the angle 0<br>
depends at least in part upon the width W of the bushing body 21. That is to say, the<br>
measure of the angle 0 is inversely proportional to the width W of the bushing body 21,<br>
assuming a constant bushing height and throat width.<br>
The support 42 is shaped and dimensioned to fit between each elongate portion 38<br>
of the flange 34 and the upper portion 44 of each side wall 24. Consequently, the support<br>
42 is preferably wedge-shaped. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the support 42<br>
has a shape complementary to that of the cavity provided between each elongate portion 38<br>
of the flange 34 and the upper portion 44 of each side wall 24. Moreover, the support 42 is<br>
dimensioned to fit closely relative to each elongate portion 38 of the flange 34 and the<br>
upper portion 44 of each side wall 24. The support 42 preferably fits flush against each<br>
elongate portion 38 of the flange 34 and the upper portion 44 of each side wall 24 or up to<br>
within 0.0625 inch (1.587.5 millimeters) of each elongate portion 38 of the flange 34 and<br>
the upper portion 44 of each side wall 24.<br>
The shape of the support 42 depends at least in part upon the shape of the cavity<br>
defined between each elongate portion 38 of the flange 34 and the upper portion 44 of each<br>
side wall 24. The shape of this cavity depends upon shape of the bushing body 21. For<br>
example, the throat 30 is preferably substantially vertical. The flange 34 is preferably at<br>
about a right angle relative to the throat 30. The upper portion 44 of each side wall 24 is<br><br>
vertically spaced from the flange 34 by the vertical dimension of the throat 30. The upper<br>
portion 44 of each side wall 24 is oriented at an acute angle 9 relative to the flange 34. As<br>
stated above, the measure of the angle 6 is inversely proportional to the width of the<br>
bushing 16. If the cooling coil 40 is mounted to the underside of the flange 34, then the<br>
shape of the support 42 can further depend at least in part upon the space provided<br>
between the throat 30 and the cooling coil 40.<br>
An example of a support 42 according to a preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
is illustrated in Fig. 4. The support 42 shown has a cross-section that is polygonal in<br>
shape. It has an upper surface 46 and an inner surface 48 which preferably extends<br>
downward from the upper surface 46 at about a right angle relative to the upper surface 46.<br>
An outer surface 50 of the support 42 preferably extends downward from the upper surface<br>
46 and at about a right angle relative to the upper surface 46 and substantially parallel to<br>
the inner surface 48. A lower surface 52 of the support 42 extends between the inner and<br>
outer surfaces 48, 50. The lower surface 52 extends at an obtuse angle relative to the inner<br>
surface 48 and an acute angle relative to the outer surface 50. The upper surface 46 is<br>
adapted to engage the underside of the flange 34. The inner surface 48 is adapted to<br>
engage the throat 30. The lower surface 52 is adapted to engage the upper portion 44 of<br>
the side wall 24. The length of the support 42 depends at least in part upon the<br>
longitudinal dimension of the bushing 16. The width or lateral dimension of the upper<br>
surface 46 depends at least in part upon the width or lateral dimension of the flange 34 and<br>
the distance between the throat 30 and the cooling coil 40. The vertical dimension of the<br>
inner surface 48 depends upon the vertical dimension of the throat 30. The dimensions of<br>
the outer surface 50 and the lower surface 52 depend at least in part upon the dimension of<br>
the upper portion 44 of the side wall 24, which is largely dependent upon its angle 0.<br>
It should be clearly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art of the invention<br>
that the shape of the support 42 can vary and that the present invention is not intended to<br>
be limited to the shape shown and described. For example, the outer surface 50 of the<br>
support 42 may extend at an acute or obtuse angle relative to the upper surface 46. The<br>
support 42 can have rounded comers, as shown, or relatively sharp corners (not shown).<br>
Moreover, the ends 54, 56 of the support 42 can be squared off, as shown, or, although not<br>
shown, rounded, similar to the rounded corners. It should also be understood that the outer<br>
surface 50 can have a relief (not shown) for receiving the cooling coil 40.<br><br>
The support 42 is preferably formed from a non-deteriorating material that has a<br>
resistance to high temperature and a high tensile strength. The material is preferably<br>
resistant to high temperatures, for example, in a range of about 2,100 to 2,900 degrees<br>
Fahrenheit. The modulus of rupture (MOR) of the support 42 preferably exceeds that of<br>
the refractory material 20. The MOR of the refractory material 20 is in the range of about<br>
200 to 1000 pounds per square inch (PSI) (140 to 703 kilopascals). A support 42<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the invention would have a MOR of several<br>
thousand PSI.<br>
In the most preferred embodiment of the invention, the support 42 is extruded from<br>
a ceramic material, such as mullite, zircon, alumna, or an equivalent (hereto. Such<br>
materials have tensile strengths capable of withstanding stress endured by the elongate<br>
portion 38 of the flange 34 over its entire span and maintaining rigidity during the service<br>
life of the bushing 16.<br>
It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art of the invention that the<br>
support 42 may be formed from a high temperature-high strength material other than a<br>
ceramic material. Moreover, the support 42 may be formed from a composite material,<br>
such as a ceramic matrix with a high temperature-high strength fiber reinforcement.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the cooling coil 40 is mounted to an<br>
underside of the flange 32 so that a support 42 is held in place between each elongate<br>
portion 38 of the flange 34 and the upper portion 44 of each side wall 24 by the cooling<br>
coil 40. In this way, the cooling coil 40 holds a support 42 between each elongate portion<br>
38 of the flange 34 and the upper portion 44 of each side wall 24 while the refractory<br>
material 20 is cast and permitted to set up. It should be clearly understood that, after the<br>
refractory material 20 sets up, the refractory material 20 holds the support 42 in place.<br>
The support 42 provides a continuous rigid structural support for the upper end of<br>
the bushing 16 and, more particularly, the throat 30 and each elongate portion 38 of the<br>
flange 34. The support 42 fits tightly in the clearance provided between each elongate<br>
portion 38 of the flange 34 and the upper portion 44 of each side wall 24. The support 42<br>
maintains the rigidity and shape of the throat 30 and the flange 34 during the operation of<br>
the bushing 16 and thus reinforces the throat 30 and prevents each elongate portion 38 of<br>
the flange 34 from collapsing during the service life of the bushing 16. Consequently, a<br>
proper seal is maintained between the underside of the bushing block 12 and each elongate<br><br>
portion 38 of the flange 34, thus minimizing the gap between the underside of the bushing<br>
block 12 and each elongate portion 38 of the flange 34. This, in turn, reduces the risk of<br>
glass leaking between the bushing block 12 and each elongate portion 38 of the flange 32.<br>
Any leakage that does occur will be solidified by the cooling coil 40.<br>
In accordance with the provisions of the patent statutes, the principle and mode of<br>
operation of this invention have been explained and illustrated in its preferred<br>
embodiment. However, it must be understood that this invention may be practiced<br>
otherwise than as specifically explained and illustrated without departing from its spirit or<br>
scope.<br>
