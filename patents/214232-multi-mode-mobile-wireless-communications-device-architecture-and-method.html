				<td>MULTI-MODE MOBILE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS<br>
DEVICE ARCHITECTURE AND METHOD<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTIONS<br>
The present inventions relate generally to wireless mobile station<br>
communications, and more particularly to wireless mobile station communication<br>
architectures with multi-mode interoperability, for example communications supporting<br>
time division multiple access (TDMA) based and spread spectrum based modes of<br>
operation, wireless devices having multi-mode architectures and methods therefor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONS<br>
Wireless cellular communication mobile stations with multi-service<br>
interoperability will enable communications in areas served by different<br>
communications protocols, otherwise referred to herein as a heterogeneous<br>
communications environments.<br>
The initial deployment of new communications technologies is<br>
characterized typically by limited areas of new technology service in contiguous<br>
regions served by legacy technologies. In many countries, for example, the W-CDMA<br>
implementation of Universal Mobile Telecommunications Services (UMTS) will be<br>
deployed initially on isolated islands of service in a sea served by existing Groupe<br>
Special Mobile services (GSM)/Generalized Packet Radio Services (GPRS) network<br>
infrastructure.<br>
UMTS services will not be offered over substantial contiguous areas until<br>
new technology infrastructure is installed or until existing infrastructure is upgraded,<br>
but this will require substantial capital outlays by telecommunications services<br>
providers and may not be complete for some time, resulting in a heterogeneous<br>
communications environment in many geographic regions for the foreseeable future.<br><br>
Multi-mode cellular handsets capable of operating in areas served by<br>
emerging and legacy communications infrastructures will provide users earlier access<br>
to the emerging communications technology and hasten its deployment. Multi-mode<br>
wireless communications devices are also desirable for communications in other<br>
heterogeneous environments.<br>
Mobile wireless communications devices will require architectures with<br>
multi-mode interoperability for seamless operation in heterogeneous communications<br>
environments.<br>
The various aspects, features and advantages of the present invention<br>
will become more fully apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon careful<br>
consideration of the following Detailed Description of the Invention with the<br>
accompanying drawings described below.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONS<br>
FIG. 1 is an exemplary heterogeneous communications environment<br>
100 comprising a relatively contiguous GSM/GPRS coverage area 110 and several<br>
isolated W-CDMA coverage areas 120 and 122. The heterogeneous environment<br>
of FIG. 1 is typical of the early stages of deployment of advanced communications<br>
network infrastructure, e.g., a W-CDMA network, in area where an existing<br>
infrastructure, e.g., GSM/GPRS, is already well established. The exemplary<br>
environment 100 is not limited to one served by the exemplary radio access<br>
networks, but may be served more generally by a heterogeneous network<br>
comprising any radio access technologies, for example, one comprising 3rd and 4th<br>
generation communications service and beyond.<br>
For multi-mode wireless communications devices operating in<br>
heterogeneous networks, for example a mobile terminal following user route 130<br>
in FIG. 1, it is desirable for the communications devices to simultaneously monitor<br>
cells of the different radio access networks in idle and active modes to perform cell<br>
selection and handover procedures, including the bi-directional handoff of radio<br>
access bearer services, for example in networks comprising GSM Base Station<br>
Subsystems (BSS) and Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN)<br>
access networks.<br><br>
FIG. 2 is an exemplary multi-mode mobile wireless communications<br>
device architecture 200 comprising generally an application layer 210 interfaced<br>
with a services layer 220 interfaced with a multi-mode layer 230, comprising at<br>
least two interoperable radio access technologies, interfaced with a hardware layer<br>
240.<br>
In FIG. 2, the application layer 200, at the top of the model, comprises<br>
generally one or more application subsystems. In the exemplary architecture 300<br>
of FIG. 3, the application layer 310 includes a single application subsystem<br>
comprising an AT command parser 312, an application manager 314, and, for<br>
example, Synergy applications. The application layer may also include generally<br>
other application subsystems, for example a Java Virtual Machine and its<br>
corresponding applications, among other application subsystems.<br>
In FIG. 3, the exemplary services layer 320 comprises a Data Flow<br>
Service Provider (DFSP) 322, a Data Session Service Provider (DSSP) 324, and<br>
Connection Management (CM) components 326. The application layer interfaces<br>
with the services layers and communications therebetween are performed by<br>
function calls, for example Application Utility Functions (AUF). Communications<br>
also occur within the application and services layers, for example, between the<br>
DFSP 324 and the DSSP 324.<br>
The multi-mode layer comprises generally an interoperability entity<br>
that interconnects the radio access technologies. In FIG. 2, the first radio access<br>
technology 232 is a GSM/GPRS radio access technology, which may include an<br>
extension, for example EDGE or EDGE Classic. The second radio access<br>
technology 234 is a non-GSM technology, for example Wideband Code Division<br>
Multiple Access (W-CDMA) Universal Mobile Telecommunications Services<br>
(UMTS) radio access technology.<br>
In FIG. 2, the multi-mode layer, or engine layer, comprises generally<br>
a common subsystem 236 comprising components shared among the different<br>
radio access technologies, for example mobility management layer, data router,<br><br>
connectivity components, etc. The engine layer also includes a time critical<br>
functionality control component 238, which is shared among the radio access<br>
technologies, for example for measurement control, scheduling, cell selection, etc.<br>
as discussed more fully below.<br>
In the exemplary architecture of FIG. 3, the components shared by<br>
the first and second radio access technologies include the application layer 310 and<br>
the services layer 320. In one embodiment, several components of the multi-mode<br>
layer 330 are also shared by the radio access technologies, including the mobility<br>
management component 332, the Session Management (SM) component 334, the<br>
Radio Link Protocol (RLP) component 336, and other components discussed<br>
further below. In FIG. 3, a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) component 350<br>
includes generally modulation and demodulation functionality for the<br>
corresponding radio access technologies, WCDMA and GSM/GPRS in the<br>
exemplary embodiment.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 3, the architecture includes a<br>
radio resource layer 338 for transitioning between the first and second radio access<br>
technologies. In this exemplary embodiment, the radio resource layer is shared by<br>
the radio access technologies.<br>
FIG. 4 is a more detailed illustration of the radio resource layer 400<br>
comprising a radio resource component 402 including a state transition<br>
component 410 and first and second state machines 420 and 430 for the<br>
corresponding radio access technologies. Other state machines may be included<br>
for embodiments that include additional radio access technologies. The state<br>
transition component 410 generally allocates resources among the first and second<br>
radio access technologies. The state transition component also maintains current<br>
state information while transitioning from one state machine to the other to enable<br>
returning to the current state if the transition is unsuccessful.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 4, the first state machine 420 is<br>
coupled generally to a W-CDMA radio resource entity (RRC) 440, which includes<br><br>
a W-CDMA message parser 442, a message builder 444, and a layer configuration<br>
controller 446, among other known functionality elements. The second state<br>
machine 430 is coupled to the GPRS radio resource (GRR)/ GSM radio resource<br>
(RR) entity 450, which includes a GSM/GPRS message parser 452, a message<br>
builder 454, and a configuration controller 456, among other known elements. The<br>
radio resource entities 440 and 450 and corresponding elements are specific to the<br>
radio access technologies in the device.<br>
In FIG. 3, the radio resource layer 338 communicates radio resource<br>
status and other control information, for example registration area and NAS<br>
system information, PLMN availability, etc., to a mobility management layer, and<br>
in the exemplary embodiment to a mobility management component 332 thereof,<br>
the functionality of which is discussed more fully below.<br>
In FIG. 3, a timing component 340 is coupled to the radio resource<br>
layer 338. The exemplary timing component 340 is divided into a real-time task<br>
processing portion 342, and an interrupt-processing portion 344. The real-time<br>
task portion is coupled to corresponding portions of the radio access technologies<br>
for performing real-time processing, and the interrupt-processing portion is<br>
coupled to the radio access technologies for performing interrupt processing.<br>
Time critical radio access technology functionality, for example,<br>
Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) selection, cell selection and reselection,<br>
signal measurement, handover, etc., is coordinated by a real-time coordinator 343<br>
in the real-time portion of the timing component. The real-time coordinator<br>
reports status and other information to the radio resource layer 338, and the real-<br>
time coordinator controls switching between radio access technologies under<br>
control from the radio resource component 337.<br>
For example, during initial cell selection the radio resource<br>
component 337 controls cell selection on the appropriate radio access technology,<br>
for example GSM or W-CDMA in the exemplary embodiment, commands power<br>
measurement and channel synchronization, commands to read system<br><br>
information scheduled by Radio Resource (RR) component, and follows cell<br>
selection procedure to camp on the most suitable cell. After finding a cell to camp<br>
on, the radio resource component sends an indication to RR/RRC. If no cells are<br>
found suitable on the desired radio access technology, cell selection procedure on<br>
the other radio access technology is selected. If no suitable cells are found, an<br>
available PLMN list is sent to radio resource component.<br>
The timing component also controls interrupt processing, for<br>
example medium access control (MAC) functionality of the first and second radio<br>
access technologies. The W-CDMA Layer I/MAC interruption service routine<br>
(ISR) functionality includes, for example, DSP timing, transport to logical and vice<br>
verse channel mapping, etc. The timing component also controls interrupt<br>
processing for the GSM/GPRS Layer 1 MAC ISR, for example Adaptive Gain<br>
Control (AGC), Adaptive Frequency Control (AFC), waveform generation, MAC<br>
procedures, etc.<br>
Interrupt processing information is communicated from each Layer 1<br>
MAC ISR to the corresponding radio logic control (RLC) components 346 and 348<br>
of the first and second radio access technologies and to a DSP 350 via an Micro<br>
Controller Unit (MCU)/DSP interface 352 common to both radio access<br>
technologies.<br>
FIG. 5 is an exemplary mobility management task layer 500<br>
comprising a mobility management component 510 coupled a GPRS Mobility<br>
Management (GMM), element 520 and to a Mobility Management (MM) element<br>
530. The GMM and MM components include functionality blocks specific to the<br>
integrated radio access technology, for example registration, de-registration and<br>
location management, authentication, message building and parsing, etc.<br>
The mobility management layer interfaces with the radio resource<br>
layer 540, the radio access technology Ll-task layer 550, the GSM Logical Link<br>
Control (LLC) entity 560, the Session Management (SM) entity 570, the MMICM<br>
580, and the DSSP 590. These interfaces are also illustrated generally in FIG. 3.<br><br>
The mobility management layer also interfaces with and provide radio access<br>
technology status information to the data router as discussed below.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 3, a data router 360 is coupled<br>
to the services layer 320, and particularly to the data flow service provider (DFSP)<br>
322 thereof by a bi-direction data bus. The data router 360 is also coupled to the<br>
first and second radio access technologies, and in the exemplary embodiment to a<br>
W-CDMA Packet Data Communications Protocol (PDCP) 362 and to a GSM Sub<br>
Network Dependent Communications Protocol (SNDCP) 364.<br>
The data router 360 generally routes data between the services layer<br>
320 and one of the radio access technologies. In FIG. 3, the radio resource<br>
component 338 is coupled to the data router 360 by the mobility management<br>
module 332, which provides control information to the data router for selecting<br>
one of the radio access technologies. In FIG. 6, the data router 600 is configured<br>
for routing data from the DFSP 610 to the PDCP 620 for W-CDMA radio access<br>
technology (RAT). In FIG. 7, the data router 700 is configured for null mode, as<br>
occurs when the radio access technology is undefined, and FIG. 8 illustrates the<br>
data router 800 configured for routing data from the DFSP 810 to the SNDCP 820<br>
for GSM radio access technology.<br>

be the best modes thereof have been described in a manner that establishes<br>
possession thereof by the inventors and that enables those of ordinary skill in the<br>
art to make and use the inventions, it will be understood and appreciated that<br>
