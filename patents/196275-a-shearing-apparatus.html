The present invention generally relates to a shearing apparatus and, more particularly, a shearing unit for cutting a strip of amorphous magnetic alloy. (Description of the Prior Art)<br>
Recently, amorphous magnetic alloys as material for, for example, transformer cores have received attentions since they exhibit a small magnetic loss  Since an amorphous magnetic alloy is available in the form of an extremely thin strip, a number of core structures have hitherto been employed when the core is desired to be formed by the use of such a strip of amorphous magnetic alloy.<br>
When a wound core is desirably fabricated using the amorphous magnetic alloy, in order to reduce the number of manufacturing steps it is not desirable to treat the single strip of amorphous magnetic alloy, but is desirable to handle a laminated structure of amorphous magnetic alloy in which a predetermined number of, for example, eight to sixteen, strips of amorphous magnetic alloy are stacked one above the other. In making the wound core by the use of the laminated structure of the amorphous magnetic alloy strips, a continuous composite strip which is a lamination of a plurality of strips of amorphous magnetic alloy is cut to provide a plurality of multilayered strips of amorphous magnetic alloy having respective lengths progressively increased by 2 wherein t represents the thickness of the lamination.<br>
The multilayered strips of amorphous magnetic alloy having the respective lengths progressively increasing by 27  are then stacked one above the other in a fashion displaced lengthwise thereof with their opposite ends stepped, to thereby provide a plurality of laminated blocks forming respective parts of the iron core, which are subsequently turned around a mandrel with their opposite ends joined to form butt joints or lapped joints, thereby completing the iron core in which the joints assume a stepped structure.<br><br>
To make the wound iron core of the type discussed above, it is necessary to form the multilayered strips as a basic material in which a predeter¬mined number of strips of amorphous magnetic alloy are laminated and, at the time of formation of such multilayered strips, it is necessary to cut to a predetermined length the continuous composite strip formed by overlapping a plurality of strips of amorphous magnetic alloy.<br>
As a cutting device for cutting the amorphous magnetic alloy strip, a standard shearing apparatus including a lower blade and an upper blade is generally employed. When it comes to cutting of the strip with the use of the shearing apparatus of the type including the lower and upper blades, a relatively large load acts on the blades at the time the strip is to be cut and also at the time the cutting terminates. In particular since the amorphous magnetic alloy is very hard, the load acting on the blades of the shearing apparatus is high.<br>
In the known shearing apparatus utilizing the lower and upper blades for cutting the strip, the relationship in position between both of the lower and upper blades and the strip to be cut thereby is fixed and only respective portions of the lower and upper blades of the shearing apparatus which are utilized at the start of cutting and at the end of cutting are apt to be overworked to such an extent as to result in breakage of those portions of the lower and upper blades. For this reason, the blades in the known shearing apparatus do not last long. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been devised with a view to substantially eliminating the above discussed problem inherent in the prior art shearing apparatus and is intended to provide an improved shearing apparatus of a type for use with a strip of amorphous magnetic alloy wherein the blades can have an increased life expectancy.<br>
In order to accomplish the object, the present invention pertains to a shearing  apparatus  for  cutting   a  strip  of  amorphous  magnetic   alloy,  which<br><br>
comprises a lower blade carried by a lower blade holder, an upper blade carried by<br>
an upper blade holder and a strip feed device for feeding the amorphous magnetic<br>
alloy strip through a cutting gap defined between the lower and upper blades so<br>
that the amorphous magnetic alloy strip can be cut in a direction across the width<br>
thereof.  The present invention is characterized in that a blade indexing device for<br>
intermittently moving the upper and lower blades in a direction parallel to the<br>
widthwise direction of the amorphous magnetic alloy strip.<br>
According to the present invention, the shearing apparatus is so<br>
designed that the upper and lower blades can be adjustably moved in a direction<br>
parallel to the widthwise direction of the amorphous magnetic alloy strip to change<br>
the position of both of the upper and lower blades relative to the amorphous<br>
magnetic alloy strip to be cut.  Accordingly, respective portions of the upper and<br>
be<br>
lower blades which tend to be overworked can advantageously/dispersed over the<br>
length thereof and, hence, varying portions of the upper and lower blades over the<br>
length thereof can be successively utilized to cut the amorphous magnetic alloy<br>
strips.  Therefore  the present invention is effective to avoid premature breakage<br>
of only particular portions of the upper and lower blades, to thereby enabling the<br>
upper and lower blades to be effectively utilized for a prolonged period of time.<br>
The   shearing   apparatus   according   to   the   present   invention   is svxtable particularly      /     for cutting the multilayered strip made up of a lamination of a<br>
plurality of amorphous magnetic alloy strips.<br>
In the known shearing apparatus now in use, the lower blade holder<br>
is fixed  relative to  a cutter frame structure  while the  upper blade holder is<br>
supported for movement up and down so that the upper blade holder can be driven<br>
in a direction close towards and away from the lower blade holder by a blade drive<br>
mechanism.   Where the present invention is to be applied to such a shearing<br>
apparatus, the cutter frame structure has to be supported for movement along a<br>
guide rail extending  in a direction  parallel to the widthwise  direction  of the<br><br>
amorphous magnetic alloy strip that is fed by the strip feed device and the blade indexing device has to be so designed that each time the amorphous magnetic alloy strip is cut a predetermined number of times, the cutter frame structure has to be moved to allow the upper and lower blades to be moved a predetermined unitary distance in a direction parallel to the widthwise direction of the scrip.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the blade indexing device may comprise a frame drive mechanism including at least one nut secured to the cutter frame structure, a ball screw and a drive motor for rotating the ball screw and operable to reciprocately drive the cutter frame structure, and motor control unit for controlling the drive motor so that each time the amorphous magnetic alloy strip is cut a predetermined number of times, the upper and lower blades can be moved a predetermined unitary distance in the direction parallel to the widthwise direction of the strip.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a shearing apparatus for cutting a strip of amorphous magnetic alloy, which comprises a lower blade carried by a lower blade holder, an upper blade carried by an upper blade holder and a strip feed device for feeding the amorphous magnetic alloy strip through a cutting gap defined between the lower and upper blades so that the amorphous magnetic alloy strip can be cut in a direction across the width thereof, characterized in that a blade indexing device for intermittently moving the upper and lower blades in a direction parallel to the widthwise direction of the amorphous magnetic alloy sfrip.<br>
This and other objects and features of the present invention will become clear from the following description taken in conjunction with a preferred embodiment thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like parts are designated by like reference numerals and in which :<br><br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic perspective view of a shearing apparatus embodying the present invention;<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic side view, with portions cut away, of the shearing apparatus shown in Fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 3 is a flowchart showing a control algorithm used to control the sequence of operation of the shearing apparatus; and<br>
Fig. 4 is a schematic explanatory diagram used to explain the relation in position of the upper and lower blades relative to the strip being cut.<br><br>
Referring now to Figs. 1 and 2, a shearing apparatus embodying the present invention includes a cutter frame structure 2 installed through a support structure 3 on a base plate 1 laid down on a floor at the site of installation of the shearing apparatus. The cutter frame structure 2 includes a generally plate-like unit base 4 disposed above and parallel to the base plate 1, a generally plate-like upright frame 5 secured at a lower end to the unit base 4 so as to extend vertically from above the unit base 4, and reinforcement plates 6 and 6' each secured at a lower end to the unit base 4 and at one side to the upright frame 5 and positioned on respective sides of a passage through which a continuous strip S of amorphous magnetic alloy is fed as will subsequently be described. The upright frame 5 lies in a plane perpendicular to the direction of feed of the amorphous magnetic alloy strip S shown by the arrow Y and has a window 5a defined therein so as to extend completely across the thickness of the upright frame 5. The window 5a in the upright frame 5 defines a portion of the passage through which the amorphous magnetic alloy strip S being fed moves.<br>
A lower blade holder 7 is positioned on one side of the upright frame 5 opposite to the reinforcement plates 6 and 6' and in the vicinity of the lower end of the upright frame 5 and bolted to the unit base 4. A lower blade 8 is replaceably secured to a portion of the lower blade holder 7, which confronts the window 5a in the upright frame 5, with its lengthwise direction lying perpendicular to the direction Y of feed of the strip S. This lower blade holder 7 has its opposite ends formed, or otherwise connected, with respective guide rods 10 that extend upwardly therefrom.<br>
An upper blade holder 9 is positioned immediately above the lower blade holder 7 with the guide rods 10 slidingly received in associated guide holes defined in opposite ends thereof. Thus, it will readily be seen that the upper blade holder 9 is supported for movement up and down guided along the guide rods 10 so that an upper blade 11 supported by the upper blade holder 9 with its cutting<br><br>
edge inclined relative to a cutting edge of the lower blade 8 at a predetermined shearing angle as shown in Fig. 4. As is the case with the lower blade 8, the upper blade 11 is replaceably secured to a portion of the upper blade holder 9 that confronts the window 5a in the upright frame 5.<br>
One of the opposite surfaces of the upright frame 5 adjacent the upper blade holder 9 has at least one straight guide rail 12 secured thereto so as to extend vertically. A slider 13 firmly secured to the upper blade holder 9 is slidably supported by the straight guide rail 12 by means of linear bearings 14.<br>
A crankshaft drive motor 15 and a reduction gear unit 16 for reducing the number of revolutions of the drive motor 15 are fixedly mounted on top of the upright frame 5 with an output shaft 16a of the reduction gear unit 16 drivingly coupled eccentrically with a crankshaft 17. The crankshaft 17 is in turn rotatably received in a hole defined in one end of a cranking rod 18, the opposite end of which rod 18 is rotatably coupled with the slider 13 through a connecting pin 19.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment of the present invention, the crankshaft drive motor 1 5, the reduction gear unit 16, the crankshaft 17, the cranking rod 18 and the slider 13 altogether constitute an upper blade drive mechanism 20 for displacing the upper blade holder 9 up and down. This upper blade drive mecha¬nism 20 is so designed and so structured that one complete rotation of the output shaft 16a of the reduction gear unit 16 in one direction resulting from one revolution of the drive motor 15 results in eccentric rotation of the crankshaft 17, eccentrically coupled with the output shaft 16a, around the output shaft 16a. During the first half of the complete eccentric rotation of the crankshaft 17, the latter causes the slider 13 to be displaced downwardly through the cranking rod 18 to bring the upper blade holder 9 close towards the lower blade holder 7. As a result thereof, the upper blade 11 is displaced towards the lower blade 8 to shear the amorphous magnetic alloy strip S. On the other hand, during the later half of the complete eccentric rotation of the crankshaft 17, the latter causes the cranking<br><br>
rod 18 and the slider 13 to be displaced upwardly to bring the upper blade holder 9 to a retracted position.<br>
As clearly shown in Fig. 2, a strip retainer 21 for urging the amorphous magnetic alloy strip S against the lower blade 7 during the cutting of the strip S is supported by a lower end of the upper blade holder 9 adjacent the upper blade 11 for movement up and down and is normally biased downwardly by the action of a biasing spring 22.<br>
A strip feed device 26 is installed on the base plate 1 at a location upstream of the shearing apparatus with respect to the direction Y of feed of the strip S. This strip feed device 26 includes a feed roller 23 adapted to be driven in one direction by an electric drive motor (not shown) and a pinch roller 25 urged towards the feed roller 23 by means of a fluid-operated cylinder 24, said rollers 23 and 25 defining a feed gap therebetween through which the strip S can be fed towards the cutting gap defined between the lower and upper blades 8 and 11. To enable the strip S having passed through the feed gap between the feed and pinch rollers 23 and 25 to be smoothly transferred onto the shearing apparatus without being deformed or drooped, a guide table 27 is disposed between the strip feed device 26 and the lower blade holder 7.<br>
The strip S fed through the strip feed device 26 may be the continuous strip of amorphous magnetic alloy or an elongated lamination comprised of a plurality of such strips.<br>
The support structure 3 supporting the cutter frame structure 2 on the base plate 1 is so designed and so structured as to permit the cutter frame structure 2 to be reciprocately moved in a direction shown by the arrows X and X' that is perpendicular to the widthwise direction of the strip S fed by the strip feed device 26 and also to the direction Y of feed of the strip S. For this purpose, in the illustrated embodiment of the present invention, two guide rails 30 and 31 extending parallel to each other are fixedly installed on the base plate 1 so as to<br><br>
extend also parallel to the widthwise direction of the strip S. On the other hand, linear bearings 32 and 33 are secured to the undersurface of the unit base 4 and are engaged on and with the guide rails 30 and 31, respectively, so that the cutter frame structure 2 can be moved reciprocately in the direction widthwise of the strip S with the linear bearings 32 and 33 guided along the guide rails 30 and 31.<br>
At least one nut 34 is also secured to the undersurface of the unit base 4, through which a ball screw 36 rotatably supported by a bearing device 35 secured to the base plate 1 is threadingly engaged. One end of the ball screw 36 has an externally threaded pulley 37 mounted thereon for rotation together there¬with. On the other hand, a correspondingly externally threaded drive pulley 39 is mounted on an output shaft of an drive unit, fixedly mounted on the base plate 1 and including an electric reversible drive motor 38 and a reduction gear unit. The drive pulley 39 and the pulley 37 are drivingly coupled with each other by means of a timing belt 40 trained therebetween.<br>
Thus, it will readily be seen that so long as the electric drive motor 38 is electrically energized, the ball screw 36 is driven about its own longitudinal axis to drive the nut 24 and, hence, the unit base 4 in a direction widthwise of the strip S along the guide rails 30 and 31. Depending on the direction of rotation of the drive motor 38, the unit base 4 can be moved in one of the directions X and X' opposite to each other.<br>
Although not shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the shearing apparatus embody¬ing the present invention also comprises a control unit for controlling the crankshaft drive motor 1 5, the drive motor for driving the feed roller 23 and the drive motor 38 for driving the cutter frame structure 2. This control unit is so tailored as to control the strip feed device 26 and the upper blade drive mechanism 20 so that the strip S can be cut to a predetermined length and also as to control the drive motor 38 so that each time the amorphous magnetic alloy strip S is cut a predeter¬mined number of times (usually, once or a few times), the cutter frame structure<br><br>
2 can be moved to allow the upper and lower blades to be moved a predetermined unitary distance AX in the direction widthwise of the strip S.<br>
In the event that when as a result of repeated stepwise movement of the cutter frame structure 2 the unitary distance AX in one of the opposite direc¬tions X and X' the upper and lower blades 11 and 8 on the cutter frame structure 2 arrives at a limit position within the stroke of movement thereof, the direction of movement of the cutter frame structure 2 is reversed so that each time the strip S is cut a predetermined number of times, the cutter frame structure 2 can be moved the unitary distance AX in the other of the opposite directions, thereby completing a cycle of complete traverse of the cutter frame structure in the widthwise direction of the strip S. This cycle is repeated a required number of times to complete a series of cutting operations applied to the strip S to provide a number of cut strips.<br>
It is to be noted that in the illustrated embodiment, the nut 34, the ball screw 36, the drive motor 38, the pulleys 37 and 39, the timing belt 40 and the control unit for the drive motor 38 altogether constitute the blade indexing device operable to stepwisely move the upper and lower blades 11 and 8 the predeter¬mined unitary distance in the widthwise direction of the strip S each time the amorphous magnetic alloy strip S is cut the predetermined number of times to provide the cut strips in a number equal to the predetermined number of times over which the alloy strip S is cut.<br>
The control unit for controlling the crankshaft drive motor 15 for driving the upper blade 11, the drive motor for driving the feed roller 23 and the drive motor 38 for driving the cutter frame structure is implemented by a micro¬computer (not shown) which executes a program algorithm shown in Fig. 3 in the form of a flowchart. In the example shown in Fig. 3, it is assumed that as shown in Fig. 4 the effective length of each of the upper and lower blades 11 and 8 (which blades are hereinafter collectively referred to as a shear) is represented by<br><br>
W; the width of the strip S to be cut is represented by L; and the position of the shear is expressed by the distance CP defined between a center of the shear and one end thereof. As shown in Fig. 4, the point at which the center of the shear (i.e., the upper and lower blades) intermediate of the length thereof is aligned with the longitudinal center line of the strip S intermediate of the width of the strip S is defined as an original position, and the variable CP is assumed to take a value C when the shear is held at the original position. Also, one of the opposite directions of movement of the shear widthwise of the strip S and the other of the opposite directions of movement of the shear widthwise of the strip S are referred to as a plus direction and a minus direction, respectively.<br>
Execution of the algorithm shown in Fig. 3 starts with return of the shear to the original position at step 1. The various component parts are then initialized at step 2. Specifically during initialization at step 2, the value C representative of the original position is stored in a random access memory (RAM) which stores the position of the shear and, on the other hand, the unitary distance B of movement over which the shear is moved in the plus direction is stored in a random access memory for storing the unitary distance AX of movement of the shear. Also, the plus-direction limit value max = {(W - L)/2} + CP representative of the limit position of the stroke of movement of the shear in the plus direction and the minus-direction limit value min = {(CP - (W - L)/2} representative of the limit position of the stroke of movement of the shear in the minus direction are calculated in reference to the effective length W of the shear and the width L of the strip S and are then stored in a random access memory.<br>
Then, at step 3, the strip S is fed a predetermined or required distance and, at step 4, the crankshaft drive motor 1 5 is driven to lower the upper blade 11 towards the lower blade 8 to cut the strip S. At subsequent step 5, the drive motor 38 is driven to move the shear the unitary distance AX in the plus direction, with the value AX consequently added to the variable CP descriptive of the position<br><br>
of the shear. At step 6, decision is made to determine if the variable CP descriptive of the position of the shear has exceeded the limit value max. Should the decision at step 6 indicate that the variable CP is smaller than the plus-direction limit value max, another decision is made at step 7 to determine if the variable CP is smaller than the minus-direction limit value min. Should the decision at step 7 indicate that the variable CP is not smaller than the minus-direction limit value min, the program flow returns to step 3 to execute feeding of the strip S.<br>
On the other hand, if the decision at step 6 indicates that the variable CP has exceeded the plus-direction limit value max, step 8 is executed to cause the unitary distance -A of movement in the minus direction is stored in the random access memory for storing the unitary distance AX of movement of the shear, followed by return to step 3.<br>
Again, if the decision at step 7 indicates that the variable CP is smaller than the minus-direction limit value min, step 9 is executed to cause the unitary distance -FB of movement in the random access memory for storing the unitary distance AX of movement of the shear, followed by return to step 3.<br>
The algorithm shown in Fig. 3 is such that each time the strip S is cut to the predetermined or required length, the shear is stepwise moved the unitary distance AX in either direction parallel to the widthwise direction of the strip. After the shear has reached the limit position within the stroke of movement in either one of the opposite directions parallel to the widthwise direction of the strip, the shear is stepwise moved the unitary distance AX in the other of the opposite directions parallel to the widthwise direction of the strip each time the single cutting of the strip is carried out. Considering that the shear is stepwise displaced the distance AX each time the single cutting of the strip is carried out, every portions of the blades along their length can be uniformly utilized to cut the strip to provide the plural cut strips and, therefore, there is no possibility that only particular portions of the blades are exclusively used to cut the strip, thereby preventing any possible<br><br>
premature breakage of the blades on one hand and, on the other hand, increasing the life expectancy of the blades.<br>
It is to be noted that in the example shown in Fig. 3, if the distance B of movement of the shear in the plus direction is chosen to be different from the distance A of movement of the shear in the minus direction, the probability that the strip may be cut at the same positions of the blades can be lowered, making it possible to further increase the life expectancy of the blades.<br>
Where the program shown in Fig. 3 is executed by the microcomputer to control the shearing apparatus, step 3 is implemented by a strip feed means for feeding the strip S of amorphous magnetic alloy intermittently towards the cutting gap between the upper and lower blades and step 4 is implemented by a shear control means for driving the upper blade towards the lower blade to accomplish the strip cutting upon completion of the strip feed. Also, step 5 is implemented by a motor control means for controlling the drive motor 38 for driving the cutter frame structure so that upon detection of completion of the strip cutting, the cutter frame structure is moved to move the upper and lower blades the unitary distance AX in a direction widthwise of the strip.<br>
Also, step 6 is implemented by a first limit position detecting means for detecting arrival of the shear at the limit position within the stroke of movement on either one of the opposite directions parallel to the widthwise direction of the strip, and step 7 is implemented by a second limit position detecting means for detecting arrival of the shear at the limit position within the stroke of movement on the other of the opposite directions parallel to the widthwise direction of the strip.<br>
Step 8 is implemented by a first setting means for setting the unitary distance AX over which, when the arrival of the shear at the limit position within the stroke of movement in either one of the opposite directions parallel to the width of the strip is detected, the shear is to be moved in the other of the opposite directions, and step 9 is implemented by a second setting means for setting the<br><br>
unitary distance AX over which, when the arrival of the shear at the limit position within the stroke of movement in the other of the opposite directions parallel to the width of the strip is detected, the shear is to be moved in such either one of the opposite directions.<br>
In order to increase the life of the blades, it is preferred that as shown in Fig. 3 the shear is stepwise moved the distance AX each time the strip cutting is performed. However, the present invention may not be limited to the case in which the shear is stepwise moved the distance AX each time the strip cutting is performed, and can be equally applied to the case in which the shear is intermit¬tently moved the predetermined distance AX each time the strip cutting is performed a plurality of times.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, the shearing apparatus is so designed that the upper and lower blades can be adjustably moved in a direction parallel to the widthwise direction of the amorphous magnetic alloy strip to change the position of both of the upper and lower blades relative to the amorphous magnetic alloy strip to be cut. Accordingly, respective portions of the upper and lower blades which tend to be overworked can advantageously dispersed over the length thereof and, hence, varying portions of the upper and lower blades over the length thereof can be successively utilized to cut the amorphous magnetic allow strips. Therefore, the present invention is effective to avoid premature breakage of only particular portions of the upper and lower blades, to thereby enabling the upper and lower blades to be effectively utilized for a prolonged period of time.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiment thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims, unless they depart therefrom.<br><br><br><br>
