				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There is frequently a need to deliver biologically active<br>
peptides to animals and humans in formulations providing a<br>
sustained release of the active principle. Such formulations may<br>
be provided by incorporating the active principle in<br>
biodegradable and biocompatible polymers in form of<br>
microcapsules, microgranules or implantable rods, or<br>
alternatively using mechanical devices such as micropumps or non-<br>
biodegradable containers. If the peptide is highly soluble in<br>
aqueous media, it can be formulated as a complex with non-<br>
degradable polymers such as cellulose derivatives, or mixed with<br>
polymer solutions, which form a gel upon parenteral injection,<br>
from which the active peptide is slowly released.<br>
All the above-mentioned formulations have drawbacks and<br>
limitations, such as the large volume of suspending fluids or the<br>
need to remove the non-degradable device. In the case of gel<br>
forming peptides, there is frequently a problem of<br>
bioavailability, which interferes with the desired sustained<br>
action of the active principle.<br>
Some of the problems due to physico-chemical aspects of<br>
peptides have been described in article by R. Deghenghi<br>
"Antarelix" in Treatment with GnRH Analogs: Controversies and<br>
Perspectives", edited by M. Filicori and C. Flamigni, The<br>
Parthenon Publishing Group, New York and London 1996, pages 89-<br>
91. Additional problems were illustrated by J. Rivier "GnRH<br>
analogues towards the next millennium" in GnRH Analogues, edited<br>
by B. Lunenfeld, The Parthenon Publishing Group, New York and<br>
London 1999, pages 31-45 and by other workers such as M.F. Powell<br>
et al. "Parenteral Peptide Formulations: Chemical and Physical<br>
Properties of Native LHRH and Hydrophobic Analogues in Aqueous<br>
Solution" in Pharmaceutical Research, Vol. 8, 1258-1263 (1991).<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for new formulations and methods of<br>
administration that avoid these problems, and this need is addressed by the present<br>
invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method of preventing gel formation of a<br>
hydrophobic peptide. This method advantageously comprises contacting the<br>
hydrophobic peptide with a counter-ion in an amount and at a molar ratio<br>
sufficient to provide a fluid, milky microcrystalline aqueous suspension of the<br>
peptide without formation of a gel.<br>
The invention also relates to a fluid, milky microcrystalline aqueous<br>
suspension of a hydrophobic peptide and a counter-ion in water, wherein the<br>
peptide and counter-ion are present in amounts and at a molar ratio sufficient to<br>
form, upon mixing, the suspension without formation of a gel.<br>
The avoidance of a gel enables an injectable suspension to be formulated.<br>
When these aqueous suspensions are injected parenterally (i.e., subcutaneously or<br>
intramuscularly) into a mammal, such as a human, a sustained release of the<br>
hydrophobic peptide over time is obtained.<br>
Preferably, the counter-ion is a salt of a strong acid, such as trifluoroacetic<br>
acid or sulfuric acid. Also, the hydrophobic peptide may be a GnRH analogue,<br>
and preferably is a GnRH antagonist. More preferred GnRH antagonists are<br>
selected from the groups of Azaline B, Abarelix, Antide, Ganirelix, Cetrorelix, or<br>
FE200486 in the form of their strong acid salts, e.g., trifluoroacetate or sulfate<br>
salts. Ac-D-Nal-D-Cpa-D-Pal-Ser-Tyr-D-Hci-Ieu-Ilys-Pro-D-Ala-NH2<br>
trifluoroacetate and Ac-D-Nal-D-Cpa-D-Pal-Ser-Tyr-D-Hci-Leu-IIys-Pro-D-AIa-<br>
NH2 sulfate are the most preferred compounds.<br>
The hydrophobic peptide salt is preferably suspended in the aqueous<br>
medium at a concentration of equal to or higher than 25 me/ml and has a molar<br>
ratio of at least 1.6:1 of acid:peptide. The peptide salt is at least partially in the<br>
form of needles having a particle size of between about 5 and 150 mm.<br>
If desired, the aqueous suspension can contain an isotonic agent, such as<br>
mannitol. Also, the aqueous suspension may contain a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excjoient Advantageously, the suspension is dried to a lyophilized<br>
state which can be reconstituted by mixing with water or a buffer solution.<br>
Lyophilized compositions comprising these dried suspensions, as well as the<br>
methods for making the dried suspensions, represent additional embodiments of<br>
the invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a graph which illustrates the pharmacodynamic effect<br>
(testosterone suppression) obtained by subcutaneous injection in rats of a<br>
suspension of teverelix® trifluoroacetate according to the invention; and<br>
Figure 2 is graph which illustrates the sustained release of the peptide<br>
teverelix® for several weeks in rats injected with the suspension of teverelix®<br>
trifluoroacetate according to the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
We made the unexpected discovery that a highly concentrated aqueous<br>
suspension of thepeptide of the formula Ac-D-Nal-D-pClPhe-D-Pal-Ser-Tyr-D-<br>
Hci-Leu-Lys(iPr)-Pro-D-Ala-NH2 (teverelix®, a GnRH antagonist) as a<br>
trifluoroacetate (TFA) or sulfate salt does not, as might be expected by its<br>
hydrophobic character, form a gel but instead forms a microcrystalline milky<br>
suspension which is easy to inject parenterally in animals or humans, and which<br>
releases the active principle over several weeks (see Figures 1 and 2). Such<br>
behavior is not elicited by other salts such as the acetate, which result in the<br>
expected, but unwanted, formation of gels with poor bioavailability in vivo.<br>
Our invention represents a simple and elegant solution of the problem of<br>
how to suppress gelation of hydrophobic peptides while obtaining a prolonged<br>
sustained delivery of such peptides in form of micrpcrystalline highly concentrated<br>
suspensions<br>
An additional advantage of our discovery is the small volume of such<br>
suspensions, allowing parenteral injections through a fine needle and thus<br>
improving the local tolerance of the injected material. In such injections, the<br>
amount of peptide ranges from about 0.1 to 5mg per kg body weight of the<br>
mammal to which the suspension is to be administered.<br>
The amount of counter-ion is preferably that which is in excess of what is<br>
necessary to form the salt. This amount is typically at least 1.6 mol acid/mole<br>
peptide and preferably 2mol/mol or greater. In addition, the injectable suspension<br>
should be concentrated to obtained the most desirable release profiles. By<br>
concentrated, we mean that the amount of peptide should be above 2.5% by weight<br>
of the overall formulation.<br>
The suspensions can be dried by freeze-drying or spray drying to form<br>
lyophilized compositions that can be stored as is and reconstituted with water or<br>
buffer solutions when an injectable formulation is to be prepared.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
200mL of 5% mannitol were added to approximately 15mg of the LHRH<br>
antagonist teverelix® trifluoroacetate. The mixture was stirred using vortex<br>
during one minute and a flowing milky pearly suspension was obtained. The<br>
suspension is made of microcrystals of about 10mm length. Microcrystals may<br>
clump together to form urchin like structures. The suspension was injected in rats<br><br>
(1mg) sub-cutaneously and provided the pharmacodynamic effect of testosterone<br>
suppression for more than 45 days (Figure 1). The pharmacokinetic analysis<br>
showed a sustained release of the peptide for several weeks (Figure 2).<br>
Example 2<br>
200mL of water were added to approximately 15mg of the LHRH antagonist<br>
teverelix® trifluoroacetate. The mixture was stirred using vortex during one<br>
minute and a flowing milky pearly suspension was obtained.<br>
Example 3<br>
200 mL of water were added to approximately 15mg of the LHRH antagonist<br>
teverelix® acetate. The mixture was stirred using vortex during one minute and a<br>
transparent gel was obtained. The addition of 20mL of TFA (3mols/mol) to the gel<br>
resulted in the formation of a fluid, flowing milky pearly suspension.<br>
Example 4<br>
200uL of 100mM TFA were added to approximately 15mg of the LHRH<br>
antagonist teverelix® acetate (2mols/mol) to obtain a flowing milky suspension.<br>
In addition, mixing 200mL of 75mM TFA with approximately 15 mg of the LHRH<br>
antagonist teverelix® acetate (1.5mol/mol) resulted in a transparent gel being<br>
obtained after mixing. In another study, 100mL of TFA of various concentrations<br>
were added to 7.5mg of the LHRH antagonist teverelix® acetate, with the<br>
TFA/Teverelix molar ratio ranging from 1 to 3. A flowing milky suspension was<br>
obtained with molar ratios of = 1.6, whereas gels were obtained at other molar<br>
ratios.<br>
Example 5<br><br>
200mL of 150mM TFA were added to amounts of the LHRH antagonist<br>
teverelix® acetate ranging from 5 to 30mg (concentration ranging from 25 to<br>
150mg/ml). A flowing milky suspension was obtained with concentrations up to<br>
100mg/ml.<br>
Example 6<br>
200mL of 150mM TFA were added to approximately 15mg of the LHRH<br>
antagonist teverelix® acetate (3mols/mol) and a flowing milky suspension was<br>
obtained after mixing. The suspension was freeze-dried over-night. 200mL of<br>
water or 5% mannitol were added to the lyophilisate and a flowing milky<br>
suspension was obtained after mixing and reconstitution.<br>
Example 7<br>
1mL of 150mM TFA were added to approximately 75 mg of the LHRH<br>
antagonist teverelix® acetate (3mols/mol) and a flowing milky suspension was<br>
obtained after mixing. The suspension was freeze-dried over-night. 1mL of water<br>
and 0.2M acetate buffer pH 4.0 were added to the lyophilisate and a flowing milky<br>
suspension was obtained after mixing and reconstitution. These suspensions were<br>
stable for at least 3 days at room temperature.<br>
Example 8<br>
100mL of a 250mM H2SO4 were added to 7.5mg of the LHRH antagonist<br>
teverelix® acetate (5mols/mol) and a flowing milky suspension was obtained after<br>
several hours. The suspension is made of microcrystals of about 100mm length.<br>
Microcrystals may assemble together to form urchin like structures. The<br>
suspension was freeze-dried over-night. 100mL of water or 5% mannitol were<br>
added to the lyophilisate and a flowing milky suspension was obtained after<br>
mixing and reconstitution.<br><br>
