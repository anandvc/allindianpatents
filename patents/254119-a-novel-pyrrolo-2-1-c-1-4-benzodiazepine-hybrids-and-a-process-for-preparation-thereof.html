The present invention relates to novel pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepme hybrid This invention also relates to a process for the preparation of novel pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4] benzodiazepine hybrid These novel pyrrolo [2, l-c][l,4]benzodiazepine hybrid are useful as antitumour agents More particularly, it relates to a process for the preparation of 7-methoxy-8-{n-[4-(2-oxo-2H-4-chromenyl)piperazino]alkyl}-oxy-(11aS)-l,2,3,11a-5H-pyrrolo[2,1 -c] [ 1,4]benzodiazepin-5-one   and   7-methoxy-8-{n-[4-(7-alkoxy-8-methyl-2-oxo-2H-4-chromenyl)piperazino]alkyl} -oxy-( 11 aS)-1,2,3,11 a-5H-pyrrolo [2,1 -c] [ 1,4] benzodiazepine-5-one with aliphatic chain length variations for these compounds The structural formula of these novel pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepines is given below<br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br>
wherein R1 is H or alkoxy group selected from methoxy, ethoxy and propoxy groups, R2 is H or CH3 and n is an integer varying from 3-5<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepine antitumour antibiotics are commonly known as anthramycin class of compounds In the last few years, a growing interest has been shown in the development of new pyrrolo [2, l-c][l,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs) These antibiotics react covalently with DNA to form an N2-guamne adduct that lies within the minor groove of duplex DNA via an acid-labile aminal bond to the electrophihc lmine at the N10-C11 position (Kunimoto, S , Masuda, T , Kanbayashi, N , Hamada, M , Naganawa, H , Miyamoto, M , Takeuchi, T , Unezawa, H J Antibiot, 1980, 33, 665 , Kohn, K W and Speous, C L J Mol Biol, 1970, 57, 551 , Hurley, L H, Gairpla, C and Zmyewski, M Biochem Bwphys Acta, 1977, 475, 521 , Kaplan, D J and Hurley, L H Biochemistry, 1981, 20, 7572) The molecules have a right-handed twist, which allows them to follow the curvature of the minor groove of B-form double-stranded DNA<br>
spanning three base pairs A recent development has been the linking of two PBD units through their C-8 positions to give bisfunctional-alkylating agents capable of cross-linking DNA (Thurston, D E , Bose, D S , Thomson, A S , Howard, P W , Leom, A, Croker, S J , Jenkms, T C , Neidle, S and Hurley, L H J Org Chem 1996, 61, 8141)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Recently, PBD dimers have been developed that comprises two C2-exo-methylene substituted DC-81 subunits tethered through their C-8 position via an inert propanedioxy linker (Gregson, S J, Howard, P W, Hartely, J A, Brooks, N A, Adams, L J , Jenkins, T C , Kelland, L R and Thurston, DEJ Med Chem 2001, 44, 737)   Recently,   a  noncross-hnking  mixed  lmine-amide  PBD   dimers  have  been<br>
synthesized that have significant DNA binding ability and potent antitumour activity (Kamal, A , Ramesh, G Laxman, N , Ramulu, P , Snnivas, O , Neehma, K, Kondapi, A K, Snnu, V B , Nagarajaram, H M J Med Chem 2002, 45,4679)<br>
Naturally occurring pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepmes belong to a group of antitumour antibiotics derived from Streptomyces species Recently, there is much impetus for the PBD systems as they can recognize and bind to specific sequence of DNA Examples of naturally occurring PBD's include anthramycin, DC-81, tomaymycin, sibiromycin and neothramycm<br>
However, the clinical efficacy for these antibiotics is hindered by several limitations, such as poor water solubility, cardiotoxicity, development of drug resistance and metabolic mactivation<br>
