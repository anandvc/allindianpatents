				<td>Condom<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a condom, and more<br>
specifically, to a condom which can be fitted without the<br>
fingers touching the penis or the condom body, to a condom<br>
which is easy to fit and air does not enter when the condom<br>
is to be fitted, and to a condom wherein air does not enter<br>
or remain in a sperm retention part or the vicinity of the<br>
glans part.<br>
Background Art<br>
According to the prior art, condoms are fitted by<br>
breaking the seal of a package, removing the condom body and<br>
fitting it on the penis with the fingers, but as the fingers<br>
touch the penis and the condom body when it is fitted, there<br>
is a problem as to hygiene and whether the condom fits<br>
satisfactorily, and if any lubricating oil or powder is used,<br>
it adheres to the fingers and must therefore be wiped off.<br>
Further, as air enters the condom body, the air must be expelled<br>
when it is fitted, which was a nuisance.<br>
A method has been proposed wherein the condom body is<br>
provided with a fitting tape having grip parts which is rolled<br>
up together with the condom, and when the condom is to be fitted,<br>
these grip parts are pulled, e.g., as disclosed in Japanese<br>
Patent Publication Hei 2-33765, Japanese Patents Laid-Open<br>
Hei 8-56978 and Japanese Utility and Design Patent 3029333.<br>
However, the condom body cannot be fitted without removing<br>
from its package, so it must again be touched with the fingers .<br>
In another type of condom fitted without removing it<br>
from its package with the fingers, and without touching the<br>
penis or condom body with the fingers while it is still in<br>
its package, a fitting tape is rolled up together with the<br>
condom, an extension part is formed beyond this rolled part,<br>
and the tip of this part is sealed to the rim of the package,<br>
as disclosed in, e.g. , Japanese Patent Laid-Open Sho 63-195823,<br>
Japanese Patent Publication Hei 3-505173, Japanese Patent<br>
Publication Hei 10-510452 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open Hei<br>
11-19110.<br>
However, although these proposals (creative ideas)<br>
describe how to fit the condom without touching it with the<br>
fingers, it is difficult in practice to fit the condom without<br>
touching it. Further, there are a large number of parts and<br>
steps involved, the construction is complex and manufacture<br>
is difficult. Stability and reliability of steps could not<br>
be expected, no consideration was given to maintaining the<br>
length of the extension part formed at the tip of the rolled<br>
part at a predetermined length, and the condom body unrolled<br>
when the package was opened. Due to these manufacturing<br>
problems, the product was not commercialized.<br>
If the extension part is short, the fitting tape is pulled<br>
and the rolled part is also pulled out when the package is<br>
opened, so the condom body is unrolled too much, and if it<br>
is fitted in this state, air remains in the glans part. On<br>
the other hand, if the extension part is long, although the<br>
condom body does not unroll too much when the package is opened,<br>
the fitting tape is pulled out too long after opening the package ,<br>
and the condom body droops down when it is fitted. Hence,<br>
it was not easy to fix it on the glans, the fitting stroke<br>
was too long, and the user's thigh and hand interfered with<br>
each other which made fitting difficult.<br>
The problem common to all these ideas was that, as the<br>
tip of the extension part and the rim of the package were sealed<br>
simultaneously, the expected length of the extension part<br>
easily tended to increase or decrease . Due to the construction<br>
of the product, in the steps leading to the final step of the<br>
packaging, this could not be resolved and manufacture of the<br>
condom was therefore difficult. Moreover in these proposals ,<br>
no consideration whatever was given to maintaining the length<br>
of the extension part within a predetermined range , or to means<br>
to achieving that end.<br>
In these condom bodies, there is a sperm retention area<br>
in the glans part. Air entered the sperm retention area when<br>
the package was opened or the condom was fitted, and remained<br>
after the condom was fitted.<br>
There have been proposals for designs which expel the<br>
air in the sperm retention part, but in practice, there was<br>
still a risk that air would enter when the condom was fitted.<br>
As there is a sperm retention area in the glans part,<br>
a considerable amount of air is trapped when the package is<br>
opened and the condom body is fitted, and it was difficult<br>
to expel this air completely. Due to this accumulation of<br>
air, the rubber film of the condom body does not fit closely<br>
around the glans, various fatal problems tended to occur such<br>
as loss of sexual sensation, a tendency to rupture of the condom<br>
body or the condom body easily falling off the penis . To expel<br>
the retained air, it was necessary to touch the condom body<br>
or the penis with the fingers which gave rise to the above<br>
problems or difficulties of usage.<br>
To open the package, it must be split into two equal<br>
parts, and as it is generally difficult to split it precisely<br>
into two parts, the idea was conceived of providing a seam<br>
approximately in the center of the front and rear surfaces.<br>
However, it is difficult to make the starting and finishing<br>
points of the seam coincide precisely on both the front and<br>
rear surfaces during packaging and sealing.<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to provide<br>
a condom wherein an extension part of predetermined length<br>
is provided in a fitting tape which is rolled up together with<br>
the condom body, i.e., beyond the rolled part. The tip of<br>
the extension part is fixed to a predetermined position of<br>
the packaging before the package rim is sealed in one piece<br>
so that its length does not fluctuate in the packaging step.<br>
The package material of the rim of the condom body is then<br>
sealed. The condom body can suitably be fixed on the glans<br>
without directly touching the penis or condom body, and without<br>
unrolling the condom body more than necessary when the package<br>
is opened. Hence the condom can be fitted without touching,<br>
and furthermore, air does not enter between the glans and the<br>
condom when the condom is fitted.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
According to this invention, when the condom body is<br>
rolled up, a pair of fitting tapes are laterally disposed to<br>
the left and right of the condom body. One end of these fitting<br>
tapes is disposed in the vicinity of the opening of the condom,<br>
the tapes are rolled up together with the condom body along<br>
its opposite lateral surfaces,' and extension parts are<br>
respectively provided in the vicinity of the glans beyond the<br>
rolled part of the fitting tapes. After the tips of the<br>
extension parts are sealed in one piece with the inner surface<br>
of one of the upper package material and lower package material<br>
of the package, the other package material is placed over the<br>
condom body, and the rims of the package materials are sealed<br>
at positions slightly removed from the rim of the condom so<br>
as to enclose the condom body. In this way, the extension<br>
parts can be maintained at a predetermined length in a step<br>
wherein the rolled condom body is made into a sandwich shape<br>
by the upper and lower package materials, or in an immediately<br>
following step wherein the rim of the condom body is<br>
thermocompression bonded.<br>
The seal part between the extension part of the fitting<br>
tape and the upper package material is set at about 2/3 of<br>
the radius from approximately the outer circumference of the<br>
condombody towards the center of the condom. Hence, the length<br>
of the extension part is rationally determined within the<br>
optimum range from the viewpoint of manufacturing technique,<br>
and can be set to the most preferable length.<br>
This resolves the defects inherent in having the<br>
extension part of the fitting tape too short, and the<br>
disadvantages and difficulties involved in having the<br>
extension part too long. As a result, the condom can be<br>
suitably fixed on the glans without directly touching the penis<br>
or the condom body with the fingers, i.e., a "no touch" fitting<br>
is possible.<br>
It. is preferred that the glans part of the condom body<br>
is fashioned in the shape of a close-cropped monk's head. As<br>
there is no sperm retention area in the glans part, there is<br>
no risk that air will enter the condom body when it is fitted,<br>
and no concern that air will remain. Therefore, the condom<br>
is free from the aforesaid problems and disadvantages<br>
associated with entry of air.<br>
According to this invention, before sealing the tip of<br>
the fitting tape to the package rim in one piece, the extension<br>
part is sealed to the upper package material or lower package<br>
material of the package. Hence, the extension part need not<br>
be eliminated, the shape of the extension part can be maintained,<br>
and it can be firmly sealed to the package rim without the<br>
tip (excess length) of the fitting tape biting. This also prevents rolling back of<br>
excess condom body due to temporary interruptions in pulling the fitting tape, or<br>
to sudden pulling under a load.<br>
According to this invention, a notch for opening the package is provided<br>
substantially in the center of the upper end, and plural rows of tear lines are<br>
provided in the package opening direction substantially in the center of the upper<br>
package material or lower package material, or in both, along the notch. As a<br>
result, the roughness of the package rim disappears, opening the package is<br>
easier, and as tear lines coincide with other parallel tear lines, even if the<br>
positioning of a tear line is slightly to the left or right of the predetermined<br>
position in the package forming step, smooth opening of the package is<br>
enhanced.<br>

Best Modes for carrying out the Invention<br>
This invention will now be described in further detail<br>
with reference to the drawings.<br>
A condom according to this invention basically comprises<br>
a condom body A, a pair of fitting tapes B to the left and<br>
right, and a package C. Before a rim c of the package C is<br>
sealed 9 by thermocompression bonding, the fitting tape B is<br>
sealed 3 to the inner surface of an upper package material<br>
1 or lower package material 2, and the rim c of the package<br>
C is then sealed 9 so as to enclose the condom body A.<br>
The condom body A of this invention is formed as an<br>
ordinary thin film cylindrical envelope of latex rubber or<br>
synthetic resin known in the art in this kind of technical<br>
field. There is no restriction on its shape, i.e., there may<br>
be a sperm retention area in a glans part a or it may be shaped<br>
as a monk's head without a sperm retention part. The monk's<br>
head shape is preferred to prevent entry or retention of air,<br>
the tip is preferably formed in a flat, curved shape, and a<br>
coil is formed in the opening. The coiled width (diameter)<br>
is preferably the same as the standard width for products in<br>
common use, or a larger diameter than the standard width for<br>
products in common use. The pair of fitting tapes B on the<br>
left and right are wound together along the opposite lateral<br>
surfaces of the condom body A, and these tapes B are housed<br>
in the package C such that they are somewhat coiled by winding.<br>
According to this invention, the coiled width (diameter)<br>
of the condom body A is preferably effectively equal to that<br>
of the standard diameter of products in common use, or a larger<br>
diameter than the standard width for products in common use.<br>
By making the width a large width of approximately 53-59 mm<br>
(diameter approximately 34-38 mm) in comparison to the coiled<br>
width of products in common use, which is approximately 51-52<br>
mm (diameter approximately 32-33 mm), idle rotation of the<br>
condom on the glans when the condom is fitted is prevented.<br>
Hence, when the diameter of the condom body A is formed<br>
larger than the standard diameter common products, the condom<br>
can be fitted smoothly without idle rotation on the glans when<br>
it is fitted as described hereabove, it fits easier on the<br>
glans by making the glans part a flat, and fitting by the fitting<br>
tapes B is made still easier.<br>
The flat, curved shape of the tip refers to the relation<br>
between the radius of the condom body A and the diameter of<br>
the apex of the glans part a, where a flat shape resembling<br>
that of a crushed hemisphere is preferable.<br>
The fitting tapes B are tapes of suitable width<br>
comprising any flexible, pliable material such as paper or<br>
plastic which can be rolled together with the condom body along<br>
the opposite lateral faces of the condom body A, e.g. , a pair<br>
of low density left/right polyethylene tapes of width<br>
approximately 10 mm. One end of each of the fitting tapes<br>
B is situated in the vicinity of the opening of the condom<br>
body A, and the other ends are situated to the left and right<br>
along the outer surfaces of the condom so that they can be<br>
extended towards the glans part of the condom, and rolled up<br>
together with the condom body A. Extension parts 5 are formed<br>
in the left and right fitting tapes B beyond a coiled part<br>
4, i.e., in the vicinity of the glans part a, and the tips<br>
of the split extension parts 5 are sealed 3 in one piece with<br>
the inner surface of one of the upper package 1 or lower package<br>
2 prior to sealing the rimc of the package C by thermocompression<br>
bonding or the like.<br>
The position of this seal part 3 may be situated more<br>
towards the inside (Fig. 2) or outside (Fig. 6) than the outer<br>
circumference of the rolled up condom body A, and although<br>
it is not the only possible arrangement, the length of the<br>
extension part 5 is determined by this seal 3.<br>
After opening the package C, the condom body A is unrolled<br>
and fitted by pulling package pieces C' to the left and right<br>
of the part where the pair of left and right fitting tapes<br>
B used in this invention are sealed (3), downwards. It is<br>
therefore indispensable to form the extension parts 5 in a<br>
predetermined length in the left and right fitting tapes B<br>
so the condom body A does not roll out when the package is<br>
opened, and the condom body A does not droop after the package<br>
is opened. Therefore, the length of the extension parts 5<br>
is set in a predetermined range, and they are provided equally<br>
to the left and right on the front surface or the rolled rear<br>
surface in the vicinity of the glans a. The sealing 3 of their<br>
tips to the inner surface of one of the upper package 1 and<br>
lower package 2 prevents recoiling of the condom body A<br>
immediately after the package C is opened, avoids forming an<br>
excess extension part in the fitting tapes B, and makes it<br>
possible to fit the body A appropriately on the glans without<br>
directly touching it with the fingers , i.e. , a "no touch" fitting<br>
is possible.<br>
The length of this extension part 5 is chosen within<br>
a suitable range such that, after opening the package C, subject<br>
to the condition that the condom body A has been fully exposed<br>
from the split package pieces C', the condom body A does not<br>
recoil. To prevent the fitting tape B from being excessively<br>
drawn out after opening the package C, its length is a length<br>
such that the tear ends of the package pieces C' are external<br>
tangents to the condom body A when the condom body A is fitted<br>
on the glans in intimate contact therewith, as shown in Fig.<br>
14 and Fig. 15. Its minimum required length is given by the<br>
following equations (1), (2) (Fig. 17).<br>
When the seal part 3 is situated further inside than<br>
the outer circumference of the condom body A, equation (1)<br>
is used, and when it is situated further outside, equation<br>
(2) is used.<br>
E = r + πr + R- x .............(1)<br>
E = r + πr + R +x .............(2)<br>
where<br>
R = radius of external diameter of condom body A<br>
r = radius of rolled part of condom body A in which fitting<br>
tape B is also rolled<br>
x = distance from outer circumference of condom body A to seal<br>
part 3<br>
E = length of extension part 5<br>
The above equations (1), (2) refer to the case where<br>
the seal 3 is to the upper package material 1 in a center split,<br>
and when the seal part 3 is sealed'to the lower package material<br>
2 or when it is unequally divided to the left and right, the<br>
length may also be calculated based on them.<br>
The distance x from the outer circumference of the condom<br>
body A to the seal part 3 is basically arbitrary, but if a<br>
value of x is used where the following inequality (3) is<br>
satisfied, the condom body A is exposed from the package C<br>
and pulled out further, which is undesirable.<br><br>
The length of the extension part 5 at this time is given<br>
by the following equation (4):<br><br>
The extension part 5 becomes longer the nearer the seal<br>
part 3 approaches to the rim c of the package C outside the<br>
outer circumference of the condom body A, and as excess slack<br>
may be trapped in the seal (thermocompression bond) of the<br>
rim, the distance x from the outer circumference of the condom<br>
body A to this seal part 3 must be a suitable magnitude, and<br>
preferably small.<br>
The minimum length occurs when the seal part 3 is sealed<br>
to the upper package material 1 at about 2/3 of a radius toward<br>
the center (toward the inside) of the condom body A from the<br>
outer circumference of the condom body A, and the length E<br>
of the extension part 5 at this time satisfies the aforesaid<br>
equation (1), which is most preferable.<br>
It is practical to provide the extension part 5 larger<br>
than E computed from the above equations (1) , (2) , but if it<br>
is made too large, the condom body A is pulled out too far<br>
from the; package pieces C' and droops after the package is<br>
opened, which gives rise to the above problems . It is therefore<br>
best not. to adhere strictly to the aforesaid equation, and<br>
to allow a tolerance of several mm (e.g. , -3 mm to +5 mm) in<br>
1/2 of the external radius R when the condom body A is rolled<br>
up together with the fitting tape B.<br>
By sealing the end of the extension part 5 determined<br>
by the aforesaid method in one piece with the inner surface<br>
of one of the upper package material 1 or lower package material<br>
2, the extension part 5 can be maintained at a predetermined<br>
length, entry of air to the glans part a due to the unrolling<br>
of the condom body A immediately after the package C is opened<br>
can be prevented, drooping of the condom body A due to excess<br>
withdrawal of the fitting tape B can be avoided, and the body<br>
A can be appropriately fitted on the glans . Further, the grip<br>
hand and thigh of the user do not interfere with each other.<br>
As described above, this extension part 5 is formed by<br>
rolling up the fitting tape B together with the condom body<br>
A, dividing the fitting tape B to the left and right for<br>
predetermined lengths beyond the coiled part 4, i.e., on the<br>
front surface in the vicinity of the glans or on the coiled<br>
rear surface, and sealing 3 the ends of this divided material<br>
to the inner surface of one of the upper package material 1<br>
or lower package material 2 of the package C. This seal part<br>
3 between the fitting tape B and package C is preferably formed<br>
by adhesive or thermocompression bonding at a position removed<br>
from the peripheral seal between one of the upper package<br>
material 1 and lower package material 2 and the fitting tape<br>
B, which is a position in the vicinity of the coiled part 4<br>
of the condom body A, prior to sealing 9 the rim c of the upper<br>
package material 1 and lower package material 2 . However an<br>
extension part of predetermined length can still be maintained<br>
even if the position of the seal part 3 is the rim c of the<br>
package C as in Fig. 9, and it may also coincide with the position<br>
of the seal part 9 of the rim c which is sealed later.<br>
This is because if the seal 9 by thermocompression<br>
bonding of the rim c of the upper package material 1 and lower<br>
package material 2 , and the seal 3 by thermocompression bonding<br>
with the fitting tape B, are formed in one operation<br>
(simultaneously), the position of the fitting tape B tends<br>
to shift, and there tends to be scatter in the length and<br>
orientation of the extension part 5, which are not constant.<br>
Therefore, the seal 3 between one of the upper package material<br>
1 and lower package material 2 with the fitting tape B beyond<br>
the extension part 5 is formed before the seal 9 of the rim<br>
c between the upper package material 1 and the lower package<br>
material 2. In this way, the length and orientation of the<br>
extension part 5 of the fitting tape B are more precise, and<br>
the extension part 5 can be tightened before fitting without<br>
peeling off the seal 3 when the package is opened.<br>
Due to this seal 3, the end of the fitting tape B can<br>
be brought up to the seal 3, and an excess length 6 beyond<br>
this may be left as it is or extended to the peripheral part<br>
c of the package C, and sealed simultaneously when the seal<br>
9 of the rim c of the package C is formed between the upper<br>
and lower package materials 1,2. Thus, if the excess length<br>
and end of the fitting tape B are gripped between the upper<br>
package material 1 and lower package material 2 so that the<br>
end of the fitting tape B is also firmly sealed in one piece<br>
with the package materials 1, 2, a product can be obtained<br>
which is temporarily sealed even if the seal 3 is peeled off<br>
when the package is opened.<br>
In the package C, the condom body A which is rolled up<br>
together with the pair of left and right fitting tapes B is<br>
fixed to the upper package material 1 or lower package material<br>
2. To maintain the extension part 5 of predetermined length<br>
beyond the rolled part of the fitting tape B, after sealing<br>
3 to the inner surface of one of the upper and lower package<br>
materials , the other package material is placed over the condom<br>
body A so that the condom body A is sandwiched, and then the<br>
seal 9 is formed by thermocompression bonding, etc., of the<br>
peripheral part c of the package materials slightly removed<br>
from the condom body A so as to enclose the condom body A.<br>
An opening notch 7 such as for example a V-shaped notch or<br>
a straight indent is provided in the center part of the rim,<br>
and plural rows of tear lines 8 for opening are formed<br>
substantially in the center of one or both of the upper and<br>
lower package materials.<br>
The package materials 1, 2 comprise films or package<br>
materials having thermocompression bonding properties known<br>
in the art in this kind of technical field. For example, the<br>
upper package material 1 comprises a transparent plastic film<br>
and the lower package material 2 comprises an aluminum foil<br>
package material wherein a sealant is laminated, but the<br>
aluminum foil package material 1 may also be an aluminum foil<br>
package material wherein a sealant is laminated. Too much<br>
openingof thepackage can be prevented, and fitting is assisted,<br>
by displaying the position on the upper package material 1<br>
where the package is to be gripped (held) by both hands, and<br>
the left and right thumbs are to be placed when the package<br>
is opened, or by printing instructions to be used when the<br>
package is opened. Regarding the position of the thumbs, the<br>
tips of the left and right thumbs , or the left and right thumbs ,<br>
are displayed substantially parallel so that the package C<br>
is held by the left and right hands, the notch 7 is gradually<br>
opened, and the thenars (or bases) of the left and right thumbs<br>
come in contact before the package is torn open to the end.<br>
The sealant of the upper and lower package materials<br>
1, 2 and the fitting tape B is preferably comprised of a<br>
polyolefine having good heat seal properties (polyethylene,<br>
random polypropylene or EVA) , polyethylene beingparticularly<br>
convenient.<br>
The tear line 8 is generally straight like a "seam",<br>
but rectilinearity may be conferred by providing a slanting,<br>
thin part in the shape of the Japanese letter "ha" or an inverted<br>
Japanese letter "ha" in the opening direction substantially<br>
in the center of one or both of the package materials on the<br>
front and rear surfaces by die pressing or embossing, as shown<br>
in the drawings. This tear line, which is used for opening<br>
the package, is a thin part which is formed in the shape of<br>
the Japanese letter "ha" or an inverted Japanese letter "ha"<br>
by applying a predetermined pressure from the front and rear/<br>
surfaces of the package materials 1, 2 in the shape of the<br>
Japanese letter "ha" or an inverted Japanese letter "ha", as<br>
described above. By forming plural.(e.g. 2-7) rows of the<br>
tear lines 8, the package can be opened efficiently without<br>
any shift in the tear direction (opening direction) along the<br>
notch 7 in the center part of the upper end of the package<br>
C even if the starting and finishing points of this opening<br>
tear line on the front and rear surfaces do not perfectly<br>
coincide.<br>
This tear line is not limited to the shape of the Japanese<br>
letter "ha" or an inverted Japanese letter"ha". Rectilinearity<br>
can be conferred in the way the package is opened and ease<br>
of opening canbe enhancedby forming the tear line in a staggered<br>
shape as a combination of slanting lines and a straight line,<br>
such as for example in the shape of a letter "Y" or an inverted<br>
letter "Y", or a shape wherein a slanting line is slightly<br>
shifted up or down so that the extrapolation of one slanting<br>
line intersects with the other slanting line.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
Next, the method of using the condom according to the<br>
invention will be described.<br>
As shown in Fig. 10, the package C is gripped with both<br>
hands by placing the thumbs in the thumb grip positions<br>
displayed on the front surface of the package C and placing<br>
the four fingers of the left and right hands on the rear surface ,<br>
the package is gradually torn open from the notch 7 to the<br>
end along the tear line 8 with the little fingers of the left<br>
and right hands still in place (Fig. 11) , the thenars (bases)<br>
of the thumbs of both hands come in contact and the contact<br>
parts are gradually separated (Fig. 12). The parts are<br>
completely separated up to the end of the package C, the<br>
separated package pieces C' are pulled apart while they are<br>
still gripped and the extension parts 5 of the fitting tape<br>
B are pulled out so that the condom body A does not roll back.<br>
Opening is temporarily stopped in the state shown in Fig. 14,<br>
the condom body A is placed in intimate contact with the glans<br>
(Fig. 15) , and the package pieces c', which are split into<br>
two, are pulled toward the base of the penis. The fitting<br>
tape B and condom body A are then rolled back (Fig. 16) so<br>
that it is completely fitted over the penis with the fitting<br>
tape B peeled away from the condom body A.<br>
