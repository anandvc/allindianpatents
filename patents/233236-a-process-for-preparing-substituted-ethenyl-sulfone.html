				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing substituted ethenyl su If one/of formula I. Further, the invention relates to compositions and methods for the treatment of cancer and other proliferative disorders.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Extracellular signals received at transmembrane receptors are relayed into the cells by the signal transduction pathways (Pelech et a/., Science 257:1335 (1992)) which have been implicated in a wide array of physiological processes such as induction of cell proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis (Davis et a/., J. Biol. Chem. 268:14553 (1993)). The Mftogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) cascade is a major signaling system by which cells transduce extracellular cues into intracellular responses (Nishida et a/., Trends Biochem. Sci. 18:128 (1993); Blumer et a/., Trends Biochem. Sci. 19:236 (1994)). Many steps of this cascade are conserved, and homologous for MAP kinases have been discovered in different species.<br>
In mammalian cells, the Extracellular-Signal-Regulated Kinases (ERKs), ERK-1 and ERK-2 are the archetypal and best-studied members of the MAPK family, which all have the unique feature of being activated by phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues by an upstream dual specificity kinase (Posada et a/., Science 255:212 (1992);<br>
Biggs III et a/., Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA 89:6295 (1992); Gamer et a/., Genes Dev. 6:1280 (1992)).<br>
Recent studies have identified an additional subgroup of MAPKs, known as c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases 1 and 2 (JNIK-1 and JNK-2), that have different substrate specificities and are regulated by different stimuli (Hibi etal., Genes Dev. 7:2135 (1993)). JNKs are members of the class of stress-activated protein kinases (SPKs). JNKs have been shown to be activated by treatment of cells with UV radiation, pro-inflammatory cytokines and environmental stress (Derijard et a/., Cell 1025 (1994)). The activated JNK binds to the amino terminus of the c-Jun protein and increases the protein's transcriptional activity by phosphorylating it at ser63 and ser73 (Adler et at., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:5341 (1992); Kwok et a/., Nature 370:223 (1994)).<br>
Analysis of the deduced primary sequence of the JNKs indicates that they are distantly related to ERKs (Davis, Trends Biochem. Sci. 19:470 (1994)). Both ERKs and JNKs are phosphorylated on Tyr and Thr in response to external stimuli resulting in their activation (Davis, Trends Biochem. Sci. 19:470 (1994)). The phosphorylation (Thr and Tyr) sites, which play a critical role in their activation are conserved between ERKs and JNKs (Davis, Trends Biochem. Sci. 19:470 (1994)). However, these sites of phosphorylation are located within distinct dual phosphorylation motifs: Thr-Pro-Tyr (JNK) and Thr-Glu-Tyr (ERK). Phosphorylation of MAPKs and JNKs by an external signal often involves the activation of protein- tyrosine kinases (PTKs) (Giile et a/., Nature 358:414 (1992)), which constitute a large family of proteins encompassing several growth factor receptors and other signal transducing molecules.<br>
Protein tyrosine kinases are enzymes which catalyze a well defined chemical reaction: the phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue (Hunter et a/., Annu Rev Biochem 54:897 (1985)). Receptor tyrosine kinases in particular are attractive targets for drug design since blockers for the substrate domain of these kinases is likely to yield an effective andselective antiproliferative agent. The potential use of protein tyrosine kinase biockers as antiproliferative agents was recognized as early as 1981, when quercetin was suggested as a PTK blocker (Graziani et a/., Eur. J. Biochem. 135:583-589 (1983)).<br>
The best understood MARK pathway involves extracellular signal-regulated kinases which constitute the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade (Boudewijn et a/., Trends Biochem. Sci. 20, 18 (1995)). Once this pathway is activated by different stimuli, MARK phosphorylates a variety of proteins including several transcription factors which translocate into the nucleus and activate gene transcription. Negative regulation of this pathway could arrest the cascade of these events.<br>
What are needed are new anticancer chemotherapeutic agents which target receptor tyrosine kinases and which arrest the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade. Oncoproteins in general, and signal transducing proteins in particular, are likely to be more selective targets for chemotherapy because they represent a subclass of proteins whose activities are essential for cell proliferation, and because their activities are greatly amplified in proliferate diseases.<br>
What is also needed are new cell antiproliferative agents, and anticancer therapeutics in particular, which are highly selective in the killing of proliferating cells such as tumor cells, but not normal cells.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, certain a, {3-unsaturated<br>
sulfones selectively kill various tumor cell types without killing normal<br>
ceils.	The sulfones of the present invention are characterized by<br>
cis-trans isomerism resulting from the presence of a double bond. The compounds are named according to the Cahn-lngold-Prelog system, the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations, Section E: Stereochemistry, in Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, NY, 4th ed., 1992, p. 127-138. Stearic relations around a double bond are designated as T" or "E". Both configurations are included in the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
According to an embodiment of the invention the compound is substituted ethenyl sulfone.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the compound is according to formula I, and has the E-conflguration as shown in formula I. The compounds of formula I are characterized by the presence of two ring systems Qi and Cfe. at least one of which comprises a heterocydic or rnulticyclic system. The other ring system, if not a heterocyclic or rnulticyclic system, comprises a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl radical according to formula II, above.<br>
The ring systems Qi and Q2 are optionally substituted. By "substituted" means that an atom or group of atoms has replaced hydrogen as the substituent attached to a ring carbon atom.<br>
Any degree of substitution is possible on the phenyl ring of formula II. The substituents to replace hydrogen in the phenyl ring of formula II are selected from the group consisting of halogen, C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkoxy, nrtro, cyano, carboxyl, hydroxyl, amino, C1-C6 trifluoroalkoxy and trifluoromethyl. By "halogen" is meant fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. According to preferred embodiments, the substituents on the phenyl ring of formula II are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkoxy and trifluoromethyl. •<br>
Where a substituent is or contains an alkyl or alkoxy group, the carbon chain may be branched or straight, with straight being preferred. Preferably, the alkyl and alkoxy groups comprise C1-C3 alkyl and C1-C3 alkoxy, most preferably methyl and methoxy. The same preference holds true for the carbon chain in C1-C6 trifluoroalkoxy groups.<br>
The phenyl ring may be up to penta-substituted, as shown in formula II. The pattern of multiple substitution with respect to the<br>
position of the phenyl ring of formula II may comprise any pattern o substitution.   For example, tri-substitution may comprise substitution a positions 2, 3 and 4, positions 2, 4 and 5, or positions 2, 4 and 6, foi example.   Likewise, the pattern of tetra-substitution may comprise, foi jxample, substitution at positions 2, 3, 4 and 5, or positions 2, 3, 5 and 6. According to certain embodiments,  the phenyl  ring  oi formula II is tri-substituted, that is, only two of RI through R5 are hydrogen.   Representative combinations of substituents are set forth in Table 1:<br>
Table 1: Tri-Substitution<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
According to certain other embodiments, the phenyl ring of formula II is tetra-substituted, that is, only one of RI through RS is hydrogen. Representative combinations of substituents are set forth in Table 2:<br>
Table 2: Tetra-Substitution<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
According to other embodiments, the phenyl ring of formula II is penta-substituted, preferably with halogen, most preferably with the same halogen.<br>
Where the phenyl ring is mono-substituted (only one of Rr Rs is other than hydrogen), the non-hydrogen substituent is preferably located at the 2- or 4-position (Ri or R3 is other than hydrogen). Where the ring is di-substituted (two of Ri-R5 are other than hydrogen), thfe non-hydrogen substituents are preferably located at the 2- and 4-positions (R1 and R3 are other than hydrogen) , or the 3- and 4-positions (R2 and Rz are other than hydrogen).<br>
According to certain preferred embodiments, the 4-position of the phenyl ring of formula II is substituted, that is, R3 is other than hydrogen. Preferably, R3 is halogen or C1-C6 alkoxy in these embodiments. According to one preferred embodiment, RI is hydrogen or halogen; Rz is halogen, C1-C3 alkoxy or trifluoromethyl; and Ra, R* and R5 are hydrogen.<br>
Where Qi of formula Ms the 5- or 6-member aromatic heterocyclic radical of formula III, preferred radicals include 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyl, 3-thienyl, 2-thienyl-1,1-dioxide, 3-thienyH,1-dioxide, 2-pyridyl and 3-pyridyl. The aforesaid heterocyclic radicals may be optionally mono- or di-substituted with halogen or nitro. Where Q2 of formula I is the 5- or 6-member aromatic heterocyclic radical of formula<br>
IV, preferred radicals include 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyl, 3-thienyl, 2-thienyl-1,1-dioxide, 3-thienyl-1,1-dioxide, 2-thiazolyl, 2-pyrrolyl, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl and 4-pyridyl. The aforesaid heterocyclic radicals may be optionally mono- or di-substrtuted with halogen or nitro.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the a, 3-unsaturated sulfone compound is of the Z-configuration and has the structure of formula V. The heterocyclic ring in formula V may be optionally mono- or di-substituted with halogen or nitro. Preferred heterocyclic radicals include unsubstituted 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyl and 3-thienyl. The preferences for the substituent selection and pattern of substitution on the phenyl ring in formula V is the same as for formula II, above.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the compounds of the invention affect the MARK signal transduction pathway, thereby affecting tumor cell growth and viability. This cell growth inhibition is associated with regulation of the ERK and JNK types of MAPK. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, the sulfones of the present invention may block the phosphorylating capacity of ERK-2.<br>
The compounds of the invention have been shown to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells by inducing cell death. The compounds are believed effective against a broad range of tumor types, including but not limited to the following: breast, prostate, ovarian, lung, colorectal, brain (i.e. glioma) and renal. The compounds are also believed effective against leukemic -cells. The compounds do not kill normal cells in concentrations at which tumor cells are killed.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered to individuals (mammals, including animals and humans) afflicted with cancer.<br>
The compounds are also believed useful in the treatment of non-cancer proliferative disorders, that is, proliferative disorders which are characterized by benign indications. Such disorders may also be known as "cytoproKferative" or "hyperproliferative* in that cells are made<br>
by the body at an atypically elevated rate. Such disorders include, but are not limited to, the following: hemangiomatosis in new bom, secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, chronic progressive myelodegenerative disease, neurofibromatosis, ganglioneuromatosis, keloid formation, Paget's disease of the bone, fibrocystic disease of the breast, Peyronie's and Dupuytren's fibroses restenosis and cirrhosis.<br>
Treatment of this broad range of tumor cells with the a,p-unsaturated sulfone compounds of the invention leads to inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptotic cell death.<br>
Tumor cells treated with the compounds of the invention accumulate in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. As the cells exit the G2/M phase, they appear to undergo apoptosis. Treatment of normal cells with the sulfone compounds does not result in apoptosis.<br>
The (E)-a,p, unsaturated sutfones of formula I may be prepared by Knoevenagel condensation of Cfe-aldehydes with Qi-CH?-sulfonyl acetic acids, according to the Scheme 1 below, wherein Q1 and Cb are defined as for formula I, above. The Qi-OMhioacetic acid B is formed by the reaction of sodium thtoglycollate and a Qi-CHr-CI compound A, The tnioacetic acid compound B is then oxidized with 30% hydrogen peroxide to give a corresponding suKbnyl acetic add compound<br>
•.<br>
C_. Condensation of £ with the aldehyde D via a Knoevenagel reaction in the presence of benzyiamine and glacial acetic acid yields the desired (E)-a,£-iinsaturated sulfone £.<br><br>
The following is a more detailed two-part synthesis procedure for preparing the formula I a,{S-unsaturated sulfones, (E)-QrCH2SO2CH=CH-0.2, according to the above scheme.General Procedure 1: Synthesis (E)-a,£ Unsaturated Sulfones<br>
Part A. To a solution of (8g, 0.2 mol) sodium hydroxide in methanol (200 ml), thioglycollic acid (0.1 mol) is added slowly and the precipitate formed is dissolved by stirring the contents of the flask. Then a compound Q-i-CHr-CI (0.1 mol) is added stepwise and the reaction mixture is refluxed for 2-3 hours. The cooled contents are poured onto crushed ice and neutralized with dilute hydrochloric acid (200 ml). The resulting corresponding thioacetic acid compound Qi-CH2SCH2COOH (0.1 mol) is subjected to oxidation with 30% hydrogen peroxide (0.12 mol) in glacial acetic acid (125 ml) by refluxing for 1 hour. The contents are cooled and poured onto crushed ice. The separated solid is recrystalized from hot water to give the corresponding pure sulfonylacetic acid Qi-CH2SO2CH2COOH.<br>
Part B. A mixture of the sulfonyl acetic acid compound (10 mmol), an aldehyde QrCHO (10 mmol), and benzylamine (200 ml) in glacial acetic acid (12 ml) is refluxed for 2-3 hours. The contents are<br>
cooled and treated with cold ether (50 ml). Any product precipitated out is separated by filtration. The filtrate is diluted with more ether and washed successively with a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate (20 ml), sodium bisulfite (20 ml), dilute hydrochloric acid (20 ml) and finally with water (35 ml). Evaporation of the dried ethereal layer yields the desired a.p-unsaturated sulfone (E)-Q1-CH2SO2CH=CH-Q2 as a solid material.<br>
According to an alternative to Part A, the appropriate sulfonylacetic acids may be generated by substituting a thioglycollate HSCH2COOR for thioglycollic acid, where R is an alkyl group, typically C1-C6 alkyl. This leads to the formation of the alkytthioacetate intermediate (F),<br>
which is then converted to the corresponding thioacetic acid B by alkaline or acid hydrolysis.<br>
The (Z)-a,|3-unsaturated sulfones are prepared by the nucleophilic addition of the appropriate thiols to optionally substituted phenylacetylene with subsequent oxidation of the resulting sulfide by hydrogen peroxide. The procedure is analogous to the procedure generally described by Reddy et a/., Sulfur Letters 13:83-90 (1991) for the production of (Z)-styryl benzylsulfones, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In the first step of the (Z)-a,3-unsaturated sulfone synthesis, the sodium salt of an optionally mono- or di-substituted heterocyclic mercaptan of formula VI<br>
(Formula  Removed)<br>
is allowed to react with phenylacetylene or the appropriate substituted phenylacetylene forming the pure Z-isomer of the corresponding (Z)-cr,p-unsaturated sulfide in good yield.<br>
. In the second step of the synthesis, the (Z)-a,(3-unsaturated sulfide intermediate is oxidized to the corresponding sulfone in the pure Z- isomeric form by treatment with hydrogen peroxide.<br>
The following is a more detailed two-part synthesis procedure for preparing (Z)-a,3-unsaturated sulfones:<br>
General Procedure 2: Synthesis of (Z)-a,p-unsaturated sulfones<br>
Part A. To a refluxing methanolic solution of the sodium salt of a compound of formula VI, prepared from 460 mg (0.02g atom) of (i) sodium, (ii) optionally mono- or di-substituted heterocyclic mercaptan of formula VI (0.02 mol) and (iii) 80 ml of absolute methanol, is added freshly distilled substituted or unsubstituted phenylacetylene. The mixture is refluxed for 20 hours, cooled and then poured on crushed ice. The crude product is filtered, dried and recrystalized from methanol or aqueous methanol to yield a pure (Z)-a,p-unsaturated sulfide.<br>
Part B. An ice cold solution of the (Z&gt;a,j3-unsaturated sulfide (3.0g) in 30 ml of glacial acetic acid is treated with 7.5 ml of 30% hydrogen peroxide. The reaction mixture is refluxed for 1 hour and then poured on crushed ice. The separated solid is filtered, dried, and recrystalized from 2-propanol to yield the pure (Z)-a,|3-unsaturated sulfone. The purity of the compounds is ascertained by thin layer Dhromatography and the geometrical configuration is assigned by analysis of infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectral data.<br>

Effect of Sulfones on Tumor Cell Lines<br>
A.	Cells.<br>
The effect of the sulfones on normal fibroblasts and on tumor cells of prostate, colon, lung and breast origin was examined utilizing the following cell lines: prostate tumor cell line DU-145; colorectal carcinoma cell line DLD-1; non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line H157; and breast tumor cell line BT-20. BT-20 is an estrogen-unresponsive cell line. NIH/3T3 and HFL are normal murine and human fibroblasts, respectively. BT-20, DLD-1 and H157 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. DU145 was cultured in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum containing penicillin and streptomycin. NIH3T3 and HFL cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% calf serum supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. All cell cultures were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.<br>
B.	Treatment with Sulfones and Viability Assay<br>
Cells were treated with test compound at 2.5uM concentration and cell viability was determined after 96 hours by the Trypan blue exclusion method. The results are set forth in Table 1. Activity for each compound is reported as a range of cell induced death (% Death) with the lowest activity in the range of 5-10%.<br>
Normal cells HFL and NIH 3T3 were treated with the same compounds in Table 1 under the same conditions of concentration and time. The normal cells displayed 5% growth inhibition but no appreciable ceil death. The percent cell death is scored hi Table 1 as follows:<br>
