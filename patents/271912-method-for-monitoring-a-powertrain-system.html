CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]       This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/981,903 filed on 10/23/2007 which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]       This disclosure pertains to control systems for hybrid powertrain<br>
systems.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]       The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004]       Known hybrid powertrain architectures include torque-generative<br>
devices, including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which<br>
transfer torque through a transmission device to an output member. One<br>
exemplary hybrid powertrain includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-<br>
mechanical transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving tractive<br>
torque from a prime mover power source, preferably an internal combustion<br>
engine, and an output member. The output member can be operatively<br>
connected to a driveline for a motor vehicle for transferring tractive torque<br>
thereto. Electric machines, operative as motors or generators, generate a<br>
torque input to the transmission, independently of a torque input from the<br>
internal combustion engine. The electric machines may transform vehicle<br><br>
kinetic energy, transferred through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy<br>
that is storable in an electrical energy storage device. A control system<br>
monitors various inputs from the vehicle and the operator and provides<br>
operational control of the hybrid powertrain, including controlling<br>
transmission operating state and gear shifting, controlling the torque-<br>
generative devices, and regulating the electrical power interchange among the<br>
electrical energy storage device and the electric machines to manage outputs<br>
of the transmission, including torque and rotational speed.<br>

device including an input member and a first sensor operative to monitor<br>
rotation of the input member, a plurality of torque machines and a<br>
corresponding plurality of rotational speed sensing devices, an output member,<br>
and first and second control modules includes signally connecting the first<br>
sensor directly to the first control module and directly to the second control<br>
module, signally connecting the rotational speed sensing devices directly to<br>
the second control module, monitoring signal inputs from the first sensor in<br>
the first and second control modules, monitoring signal inputs from the<br>
rotational speed sensing devices in the second control module, determining a<br>
first rotational speed of the input member based upon the signal inputs from<br>
the first sensor, determining a second rotational speed of the input member<br>
based upon the signal inputs from the first sensor.determining rotational<br>
speeds of the torque machines based upon the signal inputs from the rotational<br>
speed sensing devices, calculating a third rotational speed of the input member<br><br>
based upon the rotational speeds of the torque machines, comparing the first<br>
rotational speed to the third rotational speed and comparing the second<br>
rotational speed to the third rotational speed, and detecting an input speed fault<br>
when the third rotational speed differs from the first rotational speed by an<br>
amount greater than a first threshold and the third rotational speed differs from<br>
the second rotational speed by an amount greater than a second threshold.<br>

[0007]       FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary hybrid powertrain,<br>
in accordance with the present disclosure;<br>
[0008]       FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary architecture for a<br>
control system and powertrain, in accordance with the present disclosure;<br>
[0009]       FIG. 3 is a flowchart, in accordance with the present disclosure;<br>

[0010]       FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary hybrid powertrain,<br>
in accordance with the present disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0011]       Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict an exemplary hybrid<br>
powertrain. The exemplary hybrid powertrain in accordance with the present<br>
disclosure is depicted in FIG. 1, comprising a two-mode, compound-split,<br><br>
electro-mechanical hybrid transmission 10 operatively connected to an engine<br>
14 and torque machines comprising first and second electric machines ('MG-<br>
A') 56 and ('MG-B') 72. The engine 14 and torque machines, i.e., the first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72 each generate power which can be<br>
transferred to the transmission 10. The power generated by the engine 14 and<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and transferred to the<br>
transmission 10 is described in terms of input and motor torques, referred to<br>
herein as T|, TA, and TB respectively, and speed, referred to herein as  n1 , NA,<br>
and NB, respectively.<br>
[0012]      The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal<br>
combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transfer torque to<br>
the transmission 10 via an input shaft 12, and can be either a spark-ignition or<br>
a compression-ignition engine. The engine 14 includes a crankshaft (not<br>
shown) operatively coupled to the input shaft 12 of the transmission 10. A<br>
rotational speed sensor 11 monitors rotational speed of the input shaft 12.<br>
Power output from the engine 14, comprising rotational speed and engine<br>
torque, can differ from the input speed  n1  and the input torque T| to the<br>
transmission 10 due to placement of torque-consuming components on the<br>
input shaft 12 between the engine 14 and the transmission 10, e.g., a hydraulic<br>
pump (not shown) and/or a torque management device (not shown).<br>
[0013]      The exemplary transmission 10 comprises three planetary-gear sets<br>
24, 26 and 28, and four selectively engageable torque-transferring devices, i.e.,<br>
clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. As used herein, clutches refer to<br>
any type of friction torque transfer device including single or compound plate<br>
clutches or packs, band clutches, and brakes, for example. A hydraulic control<br><br>
circuit 42, preferably controlled by a transmission control module (hereafter<br>
TCM') 17, is operative to control clutch states. Clutches C2 62 and C4 75<br>
preferably comprise hydraulically-applied rotating friction clutches. Clutches<br>
Cl 70 and C3 73 preferably comprise hydraulically-controlled stationary<br>
devices that can be selectively grounded to a transmission case 68. Each of<br>
the clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 is preferably hydraulically<br>
applied, selectively receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid via the hydraulic<br>
control circuit 42.<br>
[0014]       The first and second electric machines 56 and 72 preferably<br>
comprise three-phase AC machines, each including a stator (not shown) and a<br>
rotor (not shown), and respective first and second resolvers 80 and 82. The<br>
motor stator for each machine is grounded to an outer portion of the<br>
transmission case 68, and includes a stator core with coiled electrical windings<br>
extending therefrom. The rotor for the first electric machine 56 is supported<br>
on a hub plate gear that is operatively attached to shaft 60 via the second<br>
planetary gear set 26. The rotor for the second electric machine 72 is fixedly<br>
attached to a sleeve shaft hub 66.<br>
[0015]       The first and second resolvers 80 and 82 preferably comprise a<br>
variable reluctance device including a resolver stator (not shown) and a<br>
resolver rotor (not shown). The first and second resolvers 80 and 82 are<br>
appropriately positioned and assembled on respective ones of the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72. Stators of respective ones of the resolvers<br>
80 and 82 are operatively connected to one of the stators for the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72. The resolver rotors are operatively<br>
connected to the rotor for the corresponding first and second electric machines<br><br>
56 and 72. The first and second resolvers 80 and 82 are signally and<br>
operatively connected to a transmission power inverter control module<br>
(hereafter 'TPIM") 19, and each senses and monitors rotational position of the<br>
resolver rotor relative to the resolver stator, thus monitoring rotational position<br>
of respective ones of first and second electric machines 56 and 72.<br>
Additionally, the signals output from the first and second resolvers 80 and 82<br>
are interpreted to provide the rotational speeds for first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, i.e., NAand NB, respectively.<br>
[0016]       The transmission 10 includes an output member 64, e.g. a shaft,<br>
which is operably connected to a driveline 90 for a vehicle (not shown), to<br>
provide output power to the driveline 90 that is transferred to vehicle wheels<br>
93, one of which is shown in FIG. 1. The output power at the output member<br>
64 is characterized in terms of an output rotational speed No and an output<br>
torque To. A transmission output speed sensor 84 monitors rotational speed<br>
and rotational direction of the output member 64. Each of the vehicle wheels<br>
93 is preferably equipped with a sensor 94 adapted to monitor wheel speed,<br>
the output of which is monitored by a control module of a distributed control<br>
module system described with respect to FIG. 2, to determine vehicle speed,<br>
and absolute and relative wheel speeds for braking control, traction control,<br>
and vehicle acceleration management.<br>
[0017]       The input torque from the engine 14 and the motor torques from<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 (T1, TA, and TB respectively)<br>
are generated as a result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential<br>
stored in an electrical energy storage device (hereafter 'ESD') 74. The ESD<br>
74 is high voltage DC-coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC transfer conductors 27.<br><br>
The transfer conductors 27 include a contactor switch 38. When the contactor<br>
switch 38 is closed, under normal operation, electric current can flow between<br>
the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19. When the contactor switch 38 is opened electric<br>
current flow between the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19 is interrupted. The TPIM<br>
19 transmits electrical power to and from the first electric machine 56 by<br>
transfer conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical power<br>
to and from the second electric machine 72 by transfer conductors 31 to meet<br>
the torque commands for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in<br>
response to the motor torques TA and TB. Electrical current is transmitted to<br>
and from the ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged<br>
or discharged.<br>
[0018]       The TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters (not shown) and<br>
respective motor control modules 33 and 34 (hereafter 'MCPA', 'MCPB') for<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 that are configured to receive<br>
the torque commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor<br>
drive or regeneration functionality to meet the commanded motor torques TA<br>
and TB. The power inverters comprise known complementary three-phase<br>
power electronics devices, and each includes a plurality of insulated gate<br>
bipolar transistors (not shown) for converting DC power from the ESD 74 to<br>
AC power for powering respective ones of the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, by switching at high frequencies. The insulated gate<br>
bipolar transistors form a switch mode power supply configured to receive<br>
control commands. There is typically one pair of insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors for each phase of each of the three-phase electric machines. States<br>
of the insulated gate bipolar transistors are controlled to provide motor drive<br><br>
mechanical power generation or electric power regeneration functionality.<br>
The three-phase inverters receive or supply DC electric power via respective<br>
ones of the DC transfer conductors 27 and transform it to or from three-phase<br>
AC power, which is conducted to or from the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 for operation as motors or generators via transfer<br>
conductors 29 and 31 respectively.<br>
[0019]       The TPIM 19 preferably comprises a single control module device<br>
including the HCP 5 and the MCPA 33 and MCPB 34. There is a first serial<br>
peripheral interface (hereafter 'SPI') bus 110 between the HCP 5 and the<br>
MCPA 33, and a second SPI bus 112 between the HCP 5 and MCPB 34. Each<br>
SPI bus comprises a full-duplex synchronous serial data link permitting direct<br>
communication between the devices. The MCPA 33 directly and individually<br>
communicates v\ ith the HCP 5 and the MCPB 34 via the first and second SPI<br>
buses 110 and 112, thus achieving high-speed communications between the<br>
devices without communications delays which occur via a vehicle bus or a<br>
hybrid bus. In this embodiment, messages are typically sent from the HCP 5<br>
to the MCPA 33 and MCPB 34 each 6.25 millisecond loop. Furthermore,<br>
messages are sent between the HCP 5 and MCPA 33 and MCPB 34 via the<br>
SPI buses. In the embodiment, there is a serial control interface (not shown)<br>
which effects communication between the MCPA 33 and the MCPB 34.<br>
[0020]       FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram of the distributed control<br>
module system. The elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an<br>
overall vehicle control architecture, and provide coordinated system control of<br>
the exemplary hybrid powertrain described in FIG. 1. The distributed control<br>
module system synthesizes pertinent information and inputs, and executes<br><br>
algorithms to control various actuators to meet control objectives, including<br>
objectives related to fuel economy, emissions, performance, drivability, and<br>
protection of hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. The distributed control module system includes<br>
an engine control module (hereafter 'ECM') 23, the TCM 17, a battery pack<br>
control module (hereafter 'BPCM') 21, and the TPIM 19. A hybrid control<br>
module (hereafter "HCP') 5 provides supervisory control and coordination of<br>
the ECM 23, the TCM 17, the BPCM 21, and the TPIM 19. A user interface<br>
('UI') 13 is operatively connected to a plurality of devices through which a<br>
vehicle operator controls or directs operation of the electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
povvertrain. The devices include an accelerator pedal 113 ('AP'), an operator<br>
brake pedal 112 ('BP'), a transmission gear selector 114 ('PRNDL'), and a<br>
vehicle speed cruise control (not shown). The transmission gear selector 114<br>
may have a discrete number of operator-selectable positions, including the<br>
rotational direction of the output member 64 to enable one of a forward and a<br>
reverse direction.<br>
[0021]       The aforementioned control modules communicate with other<br>
control modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network (hereafter<br>
'LAN') bus 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of states<br>
of operating parameters and actuator command signals between the various<br>
control modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is application-<br>
specific. The LAN bus 6 and appropriate protocols provide for robust<br>
messaging and multi-control module interfacing between the aforementioned<br>
control modules, and other control modules providing functionality including<br>
e.g., antilock braking, traction control, and vehicle stability. Multiple<br><br>
communications buses may be used to improve communications speed and<br>
provide some level of signal redundancy and integrity. Communication<br>
between individual control modules can also be effected using a direct link,<br>
e.g., SPI buses 110 and 112.<br>
[0022]       The HCP 5 provides supervisory control of the hybrid powertrain,<br>
serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, and<br>
BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the user interface 13 and<br>
the hybrid powertrain, including the ESD 74, the HCP 5 determines an<br>
operator torque request, an output torque command, an engine input torque<br>
command, clutch torque(s) for the applied torque-transfer clutches Cl 70, C2<br>
62, C3 73, C4 75 of the transmission 10, and the motor torques TA and TB for<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The TCM 17 is operatively<br>
connected to the hydraulic control circuit 42 and provides various functions<br>
including monitoring various pressure sensing devices (not shown) and<br>
generating and communicating control signals to various solenoids (not<br>
shown) thereby controlling pressure switches and control valves contained<br>
within the hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0023]       The ECM 23 is operatively connected to the engine 14, and<br>
functions to acquire data from sensors and control actuators of the engine 14<br>
over a plurality of discrete lines, shown for simplicity as an aggregate bi-<br>
directional interface cable 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque<br>
command from the HCP 5. The ECM 23 determines the actual engine input<br>
torque, T|, provided to the transmission 10 at that point in time based upon<br>
monitored engine speed and load, which is communicated to the HCP 5. The<br>
ECM 23 monitors input from the rotational speed sensor 11 to determine the<br><br>
engine input speed to the input shaft 12, which translates to the transmission<br>
input speed, N|. The ECM 23 monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to<br>
determine states of other engine operating parameters including, e.g., a<br>
manifold pressure, engine coolant temperature, ambient air temperature, and<br>
ambient pressure. The engine load can be determined, for example, from the<br>
manifold pressure, or alternatively, from monitoring operator input to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113. The ECM 23 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control engine actuators, including, e.g., fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules, none of which are shown.<br>
[0024]       The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of transmission<br>
operating parameters. The TCM 17 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control the transmission 10, including controlling the hydraulic<br>
circuit 42. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include estimated clutch<br>
torques for each of the clutches, i.e., CI 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, and<br>
rotational output speed, No, of the output member 64. Other actuators and<br>
sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM 17 to the<br>
HCP 5 for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure<br>
switches (not shown) and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids (not<br>
shown) and shift solenoids (not shown) of the hydraulic circuit 42 to<br>
selectively actuate the various clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 to<br>
achieve various transmission operating range states, as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0025]      The BPCM 21 is signally connected to sensors (not shown) to<br>
monitor the ESD 74, including states of electrical current and voltage<br>
parameters, to provide information indicative of parametric states of the<br><br>
batteries of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. The parametric states of the batteries<br>
preferably include battery state-of-charge, battery voltage, battery temperature,<br>
and available battery power, referred to as a range PBAT_MINto PBAT_MAX-<br>
[0026]       A brake control module (hereafter 'BrCM') 22 is operatively<br>
connected to friction brakes (not shown) on each of the vehicle wheels 93.<br>
The BrCM 22 monitors the operator input to the brake pedal 112 and<br>
generates control signals to control the friction brakes and sends a control<br>
signal to the HCP 5 to operate the first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br>
based thereon.<br>
[0027J       Each of the control modules ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, BPCM<br>
21, and BrCM 22 is preferably a general-purpose digital computer comprising<br>
a microprocessor or central processing unit, storage mediums comprising read<br>
only memory ('ROM'), random access memory ('RAM'), electrically<br>
programmable read only memory ('EPROM'), a high speed clock, analog to<br>
digital ('A/D') and digital to analog ('D/A') circuitry, and input/output<br>
circuitry and devices ('I/O') and appropriate signal conditioning and buffer<br>
circuitry. Each of the control modules has a set of control algorithms,<br>
comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in one of the<br>
storage mediums and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the control modules is preferably<br>
accomplished using the LAN bus 6 and serial peripheral interface buses. The<br>
control algorithms are executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and<br><br>
diagnostic routines to control operation of the actuators, using preset<br>
calibrations. Loop cycles are executed at regular intervals, for example each<br>
3.125, 6.25, 12.5. 25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing operation of the<br>
hybrid powertrain. Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in response to<br>
the occurrence of an event.<br>
[0028]      The exemplary hybrid powertrain selectively operates in one of<br>
several operating range states that can be described in terms of an engine state<br>
comprising one of an engine-on state ('ON') and an engine-off state ('OFF'),<br>
and a transmission state comprising a plurality of fixed gears and continuously<br>
variable operating modes, described with reference to Table I, below.<br>

[0029)       Each of the transmission operating range states is described in the<br>
table and indicates which of the specific clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4<br>
75 are applied for each of the operating range states. A first continuously<br>
variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 1, or Ml, is selected by applying clutch Cl 70<br>
only in order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set<br><br>
28. The engine state can be one of ON ('MI_Eng_On') or OFF<br>
('Ml_Eng_Off). A second continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 2, or<br>
M2, is selected by applying clutch C2 62 only to connect the shaft 60 to the<br>
carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON<br>
('M2_Eng_On') or OFF ('M2_Eng_Off). For purposes of this description,<br>
when the engine state is OFF, the engine input speed is equal to zero<br>
revolutions per minute ('RPM'), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating.   A<br>
fixed gear operation provides a fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed<br>
of the transmission 10, i.e., N1/NO A first fixed gear operation ('Gl') is<br>
selected by applying clutches Cl 70 and C4 75. A second fixed gear operation<br>
('G2') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C2 62. A third fixed gear<br>
operation ('G3') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C4 75. A fourth<br>
fixed gear operation ('G4') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C3 73.<br>
The fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed increases with increased<br>
fixed gear operation due to decreased gear ratios in the planetary gears 24,26,<br>
and 28. The rotational speeds of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72, NAand NB respectively, are dependent on internal rotation of the<br>
mechanism as defined by the clutching and are proportional to the input speed<br>
measured at the input shaft 12.<br>
[0030]       In response to operator input via the accelerator pedal 113 and<br>
brake pedal 112 as captured by the user interface 13, the HCP 5 and one or<br>
more of the other control modules determine torque commands to control the<br>
torque generative devices comprising the engine 14 and the torque machines<br>
comprising the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 to meet the<br>
operator torque request at the output member 64 and transferred to the<br><br>
drivel ine 90. Based upon input signals from the user interface 13 and the<br>
hybrid powertrain including the ESD 74, the HCP 5 determines the operator<br>
torque request, a commanded output torque from the transmission 10 to the<br>
driveline 90, an input torque from the engine 14, clutch torques for the torque-<br>
transfer clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the transmission 10; and the<br>
motor torques for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72,<br>
respectively, as is described hereinbelow.<br>
[0031]       Final vehicle acceleration can be affected by other factors<br>
including, e.g., road load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The operating range<br>
state is determined for the transmission 10 based upon a variety of operating<br>
characteristics of the hybrid powertrain. This includes the operator torque<br>
request communicated through the accelerator pedal 113 and brake pedal 112<br>
to the user interface 13 as previously described. The operating range state<br>
may be predicated on a hybrid powertrain torque demand caused by a<br>
command to operate the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in an<br>
electrical energy generating mode or in a torque generating mode. The<br>
operating range state can be determined by an optimization algorithm or<br>
routine which determines optimum system efficiency based upon operator<br>
demand for power, battery state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the<br>
engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The control<br>
system manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 based upon an outcome of the executed<br>
optimization routine, and system efficiencies are optimized thereby, to manage<br>
fuel economy and battery charging. Furthermore, operation can be determined<br>
based upon a fault in a component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the torque-<br><br>
generative devices, and determines the power output from the transmission 10<br>
required in response to the desired output torque at output member 64 to meet<br>
the operator torque request. As should be apparent from the description<br>
above, the ESD 74 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 are<br>
electrically-operatively coupled for power flow therebetween. Furthermore,<br>
the engine 14, the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, and the<br>
electro-mechanical transmission 10 are mechanically-operatively coupled to<br>
transfer power therebetween to generate a power flow to the output member<br>
64.<br>
[0032]       FIG. 1 shows a first embodiment of the present disclosure. The<br>
rotational speed sensor 11 is directly and signally connected to the MCPA 33<br>
and directly and signally, connected to the ECM 23. During engine operation,<br>
the speed sensor 11 monitors a crank wheel mounted on the crankshaft (not<br>
shown) of the engine 14. In one embodiment, the crank wheel comprises a<br>
plurality of protruding members, i.e., teeth. Preferably, the teeth are evenly<br>
disposed along the outer perimeter of the crank wheel, with the exception of<br>
one larger gap between two teeth, preferably oriented to coincide with position<br>
of the crankshaft at top-dead-center for cylinder number one of the engine 14.<br>
The speed sensor 11 is operative to detect each tooth using magnetostrictive or<br>
other sensing capability, thereby enabling determining the speed of the crank<br>
wheel based upon an elapsed time between adjacent teeth. The transmission<br>
output speed sensor 84 is directly signally connected to the TCM 17. The<br>
TCM 17, the ECM 23, the MCPA 33, the MCPB 34, and the HCP 5 are<br>
signally connected through the LAN bus 6. The first resolver 80 for the first<br>
electric machine 56 is signally and operatively connected to the MCPA 33.<br><br>
The second resolver 82 for the second electrical machine 72 is signally and<br>
operatively connected to the MCPB 34.<br>
[0033]       FIG. 3 shows a method 250 for detecting a fault in one of the signal<br>
outputs from the first and second motor resolvers 80 and 82 (rotational speed<br>
sensing devices). A sensor fault can be detected by monitoring and<br>
determining rotational speed of the input member 12 using a plurality of<br>
methods. A first rotational speed N[(LAN) of the input member 12 can be<br>
determined based upon a signal input from the rotational speed sensor 11 to<br>
the ECM 23 (200). The first rotational speed is transmitted to the HCP 5 via<br>
the LAN bus 6. A second rotational speed N|(SPI) of the input member 12 can<br>
be determined based upon the signal input from the rotational speed sensor 11<br>
to the TPIM 19 (210). The second rotational speed is transmitted to the HCP 5<br>
via the first SPI bus 110.<br>
[0034]       A third rotational speed N[(CALC) can be determined by<br>
determining rotational speeds of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72 based upon monitored signal inputs from the first and second motor<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 (225). The third rotational speed can be calculated based<br>
thereon.  The third rotational speed is calculated based upon the following<br>
equation:<br>
N[_CALC = XNA+VNB	[1]<br>
wherein<br>
x and y represent known parametric values based upon hardware gear and<br>
shaft interconnections determined for the specific application,<br><br>
NA represents the rotational speed of the first electric machine 56 based<br>
upon the signal input from the first motor resolver 80, and<br>
NB represents the rotational speed of the second electric machine 72 based<br>
upon the signal input from the second motor resolver 82.<br>
[0035]       The HCP 5 executes algorithmic code to detect occurrence of an<br>
input speed fault once the first rotational speed, the second rotational speed,<br>
and the third rotational speed are determined. An input speed fault may be<br>
attributable to any one of the rotational speed sensor 11 and associated signal<br>
communications or first or second motor resolvers 80 and 82 and associated<br>
signal communications. This preferably includes initiating an input speed<br>
fault test. The input speed fault test comprises comparing the first rotational<br>
speed to the third rotational speed and the second rotational speed to the third<br>
rotational speed (230). The input speed fault test detects an input speed fault<br>
when a difference between the first rotational speed and the third rotational<br>
speed exceeds a first predetermined threshold and a difference between the<br>
second rotational speed and the third rotational speed exceeds a second<br>
predetermined threshold. The first and second predetermined thresholds may<br>
change based upon the speeds of the first and second electrical machines 56<br>
and 72. Preferably, for lower engine rotational speeds, e.g., engine idle<br>
conditions, the predetermined threshold ('∆rpm') is in a range of ∆rpm = 700<br>
to 1200rpm. Preferably, for higher engine rotational speeds, the<br>
predetermined threshold is Arpm = lOOrpm.<br>
[0036]       The HCP 5 preferably executes the algorithmic code to detect<br>
occurrence of an input speed fault subsequent to each detected input from the<br>
speed sensor 11 to the ECM 23. The algorithmic code preferably continuously<br><br>
monitors input speed faults in the signal outputs from the first and second<br>
motor resolvers 80 and 82. The HCP 5 preferably executes an 'X of Y' fault<br>
monitor (235), wherein a sensor fault is determined to have occurred or is<br>
indicated when an input speed fault is detected in X of the preceding Y<br>
observations (240). A sensor fault may be attributable to any one of the<br>
rotational speed sensor 11 and associated signal communications or first or<br>
second motor resolvers 80 and 82 and associated signal communications. In<br>
one embodiment, a sensor fault is indicated when an input speed fault is<br>
detected during greater than half of the preceding observations. In another<br>
embodiment, a sensor fault is indicated when an input speed fault is detected<br>
during greater than a small portion of the preceding observations.<br>
[0037]       When a sensor fault is indicated, the HCP 5 may disable or<br>
discontinue torque generation by the first and second electrical machines 56<br>
and 72 and operate the engine 14 to propel the vehicle. Additionally, upon<br>
determination that a sensor fault has occurred, the HCP 5 may use a camshaft<br>
sensor (not show n) to monitor engine rotation and thus monitor the rotational<br>
speed of the input member 12 for control and operation of the system.<br>
[0038]       Additionally, the HCP 5 may track rate changes in the rotational<br>
speed of the input member 12. If a rate of change in the rotational speed of the<br>
input member 12 is greater than a predetermined threshold, the HCP 5 may<br>
disable the first and second electrical machines 56 and 72 and operate the<br>
engine 14 with the transmission 10 in one of the fixed gear operating range<br>
states to propel the vehicle. The predetermined threshold can be set at a rate<br>
of change that is unrealistic for the system to achieve in a predetermined<br>
elapsed time. If the HCP 5 determines, above engine idle conditions, that the<br><br>
rotational speed of the input member 12 has not changed for a predetermined<br>
elapsed time, i.e., a frozen or static rotational speed, the HCP 5 can deem a<br>
fault has occurred and disable the first and second electrical machines 56 and<br>
72. If the HCP 5 determines that frozen rotational speed has been determined<br>
the HCP 5 may wait a predetermined elapsed time before determining whether<br>
the rotational speed is frozen and an input speed fault has occurred.<br>
[0039]       FIG. 4 shows a second embodiment of a system to which the<br>
method described with reference to FIG. 3 for detecting a fault in one of the<br>
signal outputs from the first and second motor resolvers 80 and 82 can be<br>
applied. The rotational speed sensor 11 is directly signally connected to the<br>
ECM 23 via a wire cable, and a second rotational speed sensor 11' is directly<br>
signally connected to the MCPA 33, preferably via a second wire cable. The<br>
TCM 17, the ECM 23, the MCPA 33, the MCPB 34, and the HCP 5 are<br>
signally connected through the LAN bus 6. The first resolver 80 for the first<br>
electric machine 56 is signally and operatively connected to the MCPA 33.<br>
The second resolver 82 for the second electrical machine 72 is signally and<br>
operatively connected to the MCPB 34.<br>
[0040]      Detecting occurrence of a fault in each of the first and second<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 using the second embodiment comprises determining a<br>
first rotational speed of the input member 12 based upon a signal input from<br>
the rotational speed sensor 11 to the ECM 23. The first rotational speed is<br>
transmitted to the HCP 5 via the LAN bus 6. A second rotational speed of the<br>
input member 12 is determined based upon a signal input from the second<br>
rotational speed sensor 11' to the TPIM 19. The second rotational speed is<br><br>
transmitted to the HCP 5 via the first SPI bus 110. A third rotational speed is<br>
calculated as described hereinabove.<br>
[0041]       Once the first rotational speed, the second rotational speed, and the<br>
third rotational speed are determined, the HCP 5 determines if an input speed<br>
fault has occurred. A method for determining if an input speed fault has<br>
occurred comprises initiating an input speed fault test. The input speed fault<br>
test comprises comparing the first rotational speed to the third rotational speed<br>
and the second rotational speed, to the third rotational speed. The input speed<br>
fault test can detect an input speed fault if a difference between the first<br>
rotational speed and the third rotational speed exceeds a first predetermined<br>
threshold and a difference between the second rotational speed and the third<br>
rotational speed exceeds a second predetermined threshold. The first and<br>
second predetermined thresholds may change based upon the speeds of the<br>
first and second electrical machines 56 and 72. Preferably, for lower engine<br>
rotational speeds, e.g., idle conditions, the difference threshold ('∆rpm') is in a<br>
range of Arpm = 700 to 1200rpm. Preferably, for higher engine rotational<br>
speeds, the difference threshold is Arpm = l00rpm.<br>
[0042]       The second embodiment may identify component faults based upon<br>
the fault counter 235 described hereinabove. The second embodiment can<br>
include fault mitigation techniques described hereinabove including<br>
disablement of the first and second electrical machines 56 and 72, and use of<br>
the camshaft sensor (not shown) to determine the rotational speed of the input<br>
member 12. Additionally, input speed faults may be identified based upon<br>
changes in the rotational speed of the input member 12 as described<br>
hereinabove including input speeds faults identified when the change in the<br><br>
rotational speed is above a predetermined threshold and when the rotational<br>
speed is frozen for a predetermined elapsed time period.<br>

of the disclosure. The disclosure has been described with specific reference to<br>
the preferred embodiments and modifications thereto. Further modifications<br>
and alterations may occur to others upon reading and understanding the<br>
