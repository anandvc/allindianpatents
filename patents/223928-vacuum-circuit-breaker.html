VACUUM CIRCUIT BREAKER;<br>
TAVRIDA ELECTRIC INDUSTRIAL<br>
GROUP,	A	CORPORATION<br>
ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF RUSSIA, WHOSE ADDRESS IS UL. MARSHALA BIRJUZOVA, 1, MOSCOW, 123298, RUSSIA.<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
2 TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention is related to electrical engineering, particularly to vacuum circuit breaker.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The vacuum circuit breaker having vacuum interrupter, electromagnetic drive, opening springs and compression springs is known [1].<br>
Its kinematic scheme comprises a large quantity of friction assemblies loaded, which results in low reliability and working life of the apparatus.<br>
The closest in design is the vacuum circuit breaker of TEL line, having drives in segregated - phase arrangement with magnetic latch and synchronizing shaft [2].<br>
Disadvantages of this design include considerable length of pulling insulator, relatively high resistance of movable conducting element (flexible current shunt), complexity of magnetic actuator, low rated current due to hindered natural cooling of contact terminals, difficulty in manual tripping and remote mechanical indication of main contact positions, difficulties in connecting up socket contacts and designing interlock mechanisms for various application projects.<br>
The invention solves the problem of providing a vacuum circuit breaker having reduced dimensions and cost, while increasing main<br><br>
performance parameters.<br>
The technical effect of applying the invention as claimed includes: reduction in traction insulator length, reduction in resistance of movable conducting element, simplification and cost reduction of the magnetic actuator, increase of rated current delete due to improvement in cooling contact terminals, reduction of the force required for manual tripping, solution of the problem of remote mechanical indication for main contacts, connecting up socket contacts and their simplified designs, facilitation of the task of hooking up interlock mechanisms.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The vacuum circuit breaker is characterized in that the traction insulation therein is embodied in such a way that component parts energized by different potentials are covered with insulation, immovable part of the insulation being embodied with a tubular fragment located coaxially inside the insulation sleeve, which is a part of the traction insulator, and resilient conductive spirals are used as movable conducting elements, having a possibility of rolling between surfaces, at least one of which possesses teeth, with the teeth oriented in the direction of motion, two convolutions of said spirals being located between the teeth, and drive magnetic systems constitute two bowl - shaped components made of high - coercively material with a coil located inside, one bowl - shaped component being attached to the circuit breaker base, the other being attached to<br><br>
4 <br>
the traction insulator, and contact terminals are made of aluminium<br>
alloy  using  extrusion  process followed  by subsequent  mechanical<br>
finishing,   and  the  manual   deenergization  generator  constitutes  a<br>
closed magnetic system having a possibility of mechanical opening<br>
thereof, comprising permanent magnet and coil electrically connected<br>
with coils of circuit breaker drives, and the manual deenergization<br>
button is in a rigid connection with the magnetic system element in<br>
such a way that the operation direction coincides with the direction of<br>
magnetic system opening, the vacuum circuit breaker is equipped with<br>
remote   indicator   of   main   contact   positions   connected   with   the<br>
mechanism of the synchronizing shaft with the flexible link embodied<br>
as  an  encapsulated  wire  cable,   and  also  equipped  with   socket<br>
contacts having separators made of aluminium alloy, manufactured<br>
using extrusion process, and equipped with an interlock shaft having a<br>
cam   for   mechanical   opening   and   interlocking   the   drive   in   the<br>
deenergized state, and a lever for electrical interlocking.<br>
The essence of the invention consists in the fact that the traction insulator and immovable insulation tubular  fragment  provide labyrinth air-gap between high potential and the earth in such a way that the breakdown path in the air has segments directed oppositely to the direction of the electrical field.<br>
Spiral conducting elements rolling in the course of vacuum circuit breaker operation between movable and immovable surfaces provide a permanent multiple - point contact because each half - turn is a<br><br>
5 <br>
separate conductor, which makes it possible to reach low values of<br>
transient resistance.<br>
The drive magnetic system consisting of two bowl - shaped component parts made of high - coercivity material makes it possible to implement a simple and reliable drive with magnetic latch.<br>
Manufacturing the contact terminals by extrusion process followed by subsequent cutting the sections of required length from the profile considerably reduces the cost of the ready article in comparison with other processes of component manufacturing, for example, casting.<br>
Employment of the manual deenergization generator facilitates designing distribution devices because the generator is not mechanically connected with the vacuum circuit breaker and may be mounted, similarly to the remote indicator of main contact position, in any convenient place.<br>
Extrusion process of manufacturing followed by subsequent cutting the sections of required length considerably reduces the cost of socket contact separators. Employment of the interlock shaft makes it possible implement interlocking without mechanical loading of the synchronizing shaft in the course of operation of the vacuum circuit breaker,<br>

in cases of one and two toothed surfaces is presented in Fig. 5 and Fig.<br>

presented in Fig. 8.<br>
DETAILED DRAWINGS DESCRIPTION<br>
The vacuum circuit breaker comprises phase modules mounted on metal base 1, inside which drives with magnetic latch are situated,-comprising stator 2, armature 3 and coil 4, opening spring 5, synchronizing 6 and interlock 7 shafts, block contacts. Cam 8 is situated at the end of interlock shaft 7. The phase modules comprise supporting insulators 9, with vacuum chambers 10 embedded in silicone rubber positioned inside, contact terminals 11, 12, compression spring 13 and traction insulators 14.<br>
Drive stator 2 faced to contact terminal 11 is covered with hard insulation 15 with the tubular fragment 16. Spiral conducting elements 17 are situated in the clearance between contact terminal 11 and movable contact bush 18. Indicator of contact positions 19 is connected with synchronizing shaft 6 with the encapsulated-wire shaft. Manual deenergization generator 20 with armature 21 is electrically connected with windings of drive coils 4. Socket contacts 22 comprise separators<br><br>
7 23, lamels 24 and plate springs 25.<br>
THE BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The device operates in the following way. When a current pulse is provided to drive coils 4, closing stator 2 and armature 3 occurs, which is accompanied by compression of opening 5 and compression 13 springs, and closing contacts of vacuum chambers 10 occurs. Stator 2 and armature 3 may be in closed position infinitely, because they are made of high - coercivity material, retaining therein the residual magnetic flux. When a negative - sequence current pulse is provided to coils 4, "resetting" of the magnetic latch from the drive occurs, and by the action of springs 5 and 13, the drive returns to the position presented in Fig. 3, contacts of vacuum chambers 10 are disconnected. In the course of drive operation, the synchronizing shaft turns to a certain angle, moving the indicator 19 from one position to another. Furthermore, the shaft turn brings about actuation of block contacts (not shown in the Fig. 3). When movable contacts of vacuum chambers 10 and bushes 18 are moved, spiral conducting elements 17 roll between elements 18 and 11, ensuring permanent contact between them. Forces of contact pressures are shown by arrows in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 for turns of resilient spiral conducting elements in cases of one (Fig. 5) or two (Fig. 6) toothed surfaces.<br>
The principle of labyrinth insulation is shown in Fig. 2, wherein possible path of the breakdown in air between terminal 11 and component parts energized by the earth potential is indicated by arrows.<br><br>
8 <br>
While working power is lacking, manual deenergization may be performed<br>
using manual deenergization generator 20 by moving its armature 21,<br>
resulting   in  opening  the  magnetic system  enabling  the  permanent<br>
magnet, and inducing a current pulse in the coil of manual deenergization<br>
generator 20, fed to drive coils 4, leading to "resetting" of the latter from<br>
the magnetic latch.<br>
Manual deenergization also may be performed by mechanical disconnection of stator 2 from armature 3 through turning interlock shaft 7, which detaches armature 3 from stator 2 with its cam. Turning of the interlock shaft 7 is performed by 90°, and its design is such that it may be situated only in one of two stable positions of Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.<br>
Toggling of interlock shaft 7 with its latching from the position of Fig. 2 to the position of Fig. 3 is accompanied by disconnecting drive circuits (electrical interlocking, not shown in the Fig. 3), mechanical opening drives, if they are closed, mechanical interlocking drives to prevent its enabling, in case of incapacitation of the electrical interlocking.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The extrusion process of manufacturing articles 11, 12, 23 of complicated spatial shape enables considerable reduction of the cost of the vacuum circuit breaker as claimed. Contact terminals 11 and 12 are also radiators of natural convective cooling of the vacuum circuit breaker, which enables increasing of the current rating.<br>
Multiple contact spiral current collector 17 enables obtaining low values<br><br>
9<br>
 of  transient  resistance,   unobtainable  for  other  designs   of  similar<br>
dimensions.<br>
Manual deenergization generator 20 and indicator of contact position 19 may be mounted in any convenient place because they are not in a rigid mechanical connection with the vacuum circuit breaker.<br>
Application of the interlock shaft makes it possible to develop simple and reliable interlock systems for any type of factory - assembled distribution devices.<br>
