COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"A MULTIFUNCTIONAL RIGID CARRIER FOR A TWO-WHEELED VEHICLE"<br>
PIAGGIO &amp; C.  S.p.A., a company organized under law of the Italian Republic of Viale Rinaldo Piaggio 25, 56025 Pontedera (Pisa), Italy,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
MULTIFUNCTIONAL RIGID CARRIER F0R A TWO-WHEELED VEHICLE<br>
The present invention relates to a multifunctional rigid carrier for a two-wheeled vehicle.<br>
The users of two-wheeled vehicles have always felt the need to fit such vehicles with motorcycle carriers. In fact, many kinds of motorcycle carriers presently exist for two-wheeled vehicles in various shapes, sizes and materials.<br>
The carriers can be,  for example,  with a cover or without,  rigid or soft,  fitted with a handle knob (incorporated or not) for the passenger, acting as a backrest or not, etc.<br>
These carriers are generally placed at the back (in the majority of cases) or at the front of the vehicle and are mechanically fixed to adequate supports to be found and integrated to the vehicle itself.<br>
The demand to fit vehicles with a spare wheel or with a small wheel having the same function, is also very high.<br>
In fact, especially in two-wheeled vehicles, the wheel is often pierced, due to the fact that the vehicle often travels through unsurfaced roads (off-road) or mainly on the internal lane of the road, that is obviously not so "clean". It must remembered the greater inconvenience that the<br><br>
driver has when the vehicle is pierced, as it is less<br>
drivable and manoeuvrable when it is pushed on foot or<br>
when it is driven at a slow speed to reach shelter or<br>
an area of protection.<br>
Furthermore, in such conditions it is clear that the<br>
driver and the possible passenger are exposed to any<br>
possible bad weather conditions (contrary to a car).<br>
It is also stated that since the birth of two-wheeled<br>
vehicles, attempts have been made to fit a spare wheel.<br>
Solutions with a spare wheel placed diagonally across<br>
the rear of the vehicle or lengthwise under a side case<br>
or diagonally/lengthwise between the driver and the<br>
front shield/steering of the vehicle,  often to the<br>
detriment of appearance and the space available of/on<br>
the vehicle itself are generally known.<br>
Furthermore, in such situations, the spare wheel can<br>
always be seen on the vehicle (even if it is contained<br>
within a wheel shaped cover) and therefore is easily<br>
subject to theft.<br>
The object of the present invention is that of creating<br>
a  multifunctional  rigid  carrier  for  a  two-wheeled<br>
vehicle  capable  of  resolving  the  above  mentioned<br>
problems and of satisfying numerous demands, related to<br>
holding capacity and transport.<br>
A further object of the present invention is that of<br>
creating a multifunctional rigid carrier which offers<br><br>
The possibility of transporting numerous objects, placed within a separate area and not in direct contact with the spare wheel, therefore avoiding contact with dirty of wet parts.<br>
According to the present invention these objects are achieved by the creation of a multifunctional rigid carrier for a two-wheeled vehicle, according to claim 1, to which reference is made for sake of brevity.<br>
Further features of the present invention are defined in the claims attached hereto.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a multifunctional rigid carrier for a two-wheeled vehicle, including a moulded cover, which is hinged to a lower moulded portion, connected to the aforesaid vehicle, characterised in that it provides a containment space in order to hold an emergency wheel and in that the aforementioned emergency wheel is associated to a separator element, which helps to define a space destined to hold other objects separately within the above mentioned carrier.<br><br>
The features and advantages of a multifunctional rigid carrier for a two-wheeled vehicle, according to the present invention, will be clear from the' following description, explicative and not limitative, referred to the schematic attached drawings, in which:<br>
figure 1 is an exploded view, in axonometry, of a multifunctional rigid carrier for a two-wheeled vehicle, according to the present invention;<br>
figure 2 is a view, in axonometry, of the multifunctional rigid carrier of drawing 1, in a first configuration of use; and<br>
figure 3 is a view, in axonometry, of the multifunctional rigid carrier of drawing 1, in a second configuration of use.<br>
With particular reference to the mentioned drawings, a multifunctional rigid carrier is illustrated for a two-<br><br>
wheeled vehicle, according to the present invention,<br>
indicated in its whole with the reference numeral 10.<br>
The carrier 10 presents a moulded cover 11, which is<br>
hinged (in 12) to a lower moulded portion 13, which<br>
allows for the provision of a containment space to hold<br>
an emergency wheel 14.<br>
In particular, the emergency wheel 14 can be made up of<br>
a spare wheel (to which reference will be made in the<br>
following of the present description or by a small<br>
wheel).<br>
The multifunctional rigid carrier 10 can be closed<br>
using a lock 16.<br>
Therefore, the spare wheel 14 (or the small wheel with<br>
the same functions and perfectly interchangeable with<br>
the spare wheel 14),  is placed horizontally at the<br>
bottom of the carrier 10.<br>
The lower moulded portion 13 is,  in turn,  rigidly<br>
connected to the vehicle frame (not illustrated in the<br>
drawings attached for simplicity) , using the plate 15<br>
(the fixing screws of which are not illustrated).<br>
The spare wheel 14 placed horizontally at the bottom of<br>
the carrier 10 is held tightly in position by the use<br>
of  the  following  elements:  a  support  17,  firmly<br>
connected (with connection screws not illustrated) to<br>
the plate 15, upon which a lever element 18 is screwed<br>
for fixing of the spare wheel 14 (the screw-threads of<br><br>
the support 17 and the lever element 18 are not illustrated).<br>
Between the spare wheel 14 and the lever 18 a separator element 19 is interposed, opportunely moulded with the function, first of all, of a vital element for the above mentioned tightening.<br>
Secondly, element 19 acts as a separator element between the space of the carrier 10, aimed at holding the spare wheel 14 (dirty, wet wheel etc.), and the upper space of the carrier 10, aimed at holding other objects, which may be placed on top, always contained within the carrier 10.<br>
The separator element 19 can be made from various suitable materials including, as an example, plastic, fibreglass etc.<br>
The carrier 10 can also be fitted with a handle rest for the passenger (not illustrated for simplicity). 'From the description above, the features are clear of the multifunctional rigid carrier for a two-wheeled vehicle, which is the subject of the present invention, just as the advantages do.<br>
The following considerations must be exposed in order to define with greater precision and clarity, the above mentioned advantages.<br>
Firstly, the carrier of the invention allows for a spare wheel or small wheel to always be available on<br><br>
the vehicle and placed in  an area protected from external events,  to the advantage of its duration, taking into account the difficult placement of such a wheel or a similar wheel on the vehicle due to space, to the advantage of appearance and image of the vehicle itself.<br>
Furthermore, the spare wheel is not visible externally and therefore cannot be seen by any possible ill-intentioned people.<br>
The invention constitutes a carrier which also offers the possibility of transporting other objects, which are placed in a separate area and are not in direct contact with the spare wheel.<br>
It is clear that numerous variants can be carried out to the multifunctional rigid carrier for a two-wheeled vehicle, subject of the present invention, without leaving behind the principles of novelty rooted within this inventive idea.<br>
Finally, it is clear that in the practical execution of the invention the materials, the shapes and the sizes of the details illustrated may be any at all, according to requirements, and they may be replaced with others that are technically equivalent.<br><br>
