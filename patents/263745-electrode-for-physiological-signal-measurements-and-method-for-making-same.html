TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Electrode for physiological signal measurements and method for<br>
making same<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an electrode that can be mounted to<br>
a catheter, and a catheter including at least one such electrode. The invention<br>
further includes a method of making the electrode. An assembly of electrodes<br>
in accordance with the present invention is suitable for, amongst other things,<br>
detection of myoelectrical activity in a patient's muscle, such as the diaphragm<br>
or other inspiratory-related muscle.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Triggering of ventilatory support systems is usually dependent upon<br>
respiratory effort of a patient. Respiratory effort can be detected by measuring<br>
myoelectrical activity in a respiratory-related muscle of the patient. A method of<br>
measuring such myoelectrical activity is to insert an electrode catheter into the<br>
patient's respiratory tract or oesophagus, this electrode catheter being<br>
connected to a signal amplifier.<br>
Current manufacturing of electrode catheters typically involves<br>
mounting stiff and large contacts that usually come under the form of rings.<br>
Those electrodes are commonly mounted directly on the outer surface of the<br>
catheter. A large contact area is preferred in catheters of which the electrodes<br>
are used for electrical stimulation. In contrast, however, the measurement of<br>
myoelectrical signals, e.g. respiratory-related muscle activity via electrodes<br>
located in the respiratory tract, does not require such large surface areas.<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/074557	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
Although the use of a ring-shaped electrode is advantageous since<br>
this structure secures the electrode around the body of the catheter, it has<br>
limitations. Typically, ring electrodes are made from sections of rigid or stiff<br>
metal tubing as disclosed for example in U.S. Patent No. 6,588,423 granted to<br>
Christer Sinderby on July 8, 2003. This means that upon insertion of a ring<br>
electrode catheter, for example a size-16 French nasogastric tube typically of<br>
large size relative to the width of the passages in which it is inserted (nostrils,<br>
throat, oesophagus, etc.), the ring electrodes can damage the mucosa of the<br>
nostrils and/or the upper airways of the patient during both insertion and pulling<br>
back of the catheter. In addition to tissue damage, this type of ring electrode<br>
catheters can also cause discomfort to the patient. Therefore, there exists a<br>
need in the industry to replace rigid metal ring electrodes and to develop<br>
narrower and/or smoother electrode catheters that minimise or eliminate tissue<br>
damage caused by both insertion and pulling back of an electrode catheter.<br>
Furthermore, the amount of time and effort involved in manufacturing<br>
catheters is critical to the price of these catheters. Easy and efficient installation<br>
of electrode arrays on a catheter would therefore be of great value.<br>
Last but not least, metals that are approved for the manufacture of<br>
electrodes used in a human body are limited. Many of these implant metals are<br>
expensive while others are difficult to handle. For example, several types of<br>
stainless steel are sanctioned for implantation and can thus be used to make<br>
electrodes. However, a great difficulty with stainless steel is that it is very<br>
difficult to combine and/or connect with other metals/materials. Accordingly,<br>
attachment of stainless steel wires to a connector is not only costly but can also<br>
result in a high level of failed connections.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/074557	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention proposes an electrode made of a thin metallic<br>
thread or wire that overcomes the above discussed drawbacks of the former<br>
electrodes.  Such electrodes can  be mounted  on  a catheter to detect<br>
myoelectrical activity in a patient's muscle such as, for example, the diaphragm .<br>
or other inspiratory-related muscle.<br>
The present invention also proposes a method for making electrodes<br>
out of such a thin wire.<br>
More specifically, the present invention concerns a thin-wire, ring-<br>
type electrode comprising a loop portion and a wire portion. This electrode is<br>
typically made from platinum, gold, titanium, silver, silver chloride or stainless<br>
steel, and has a thickness of about 10"6 m to 10"4 m. In one embodiment, the<br>
electrode comprises a protective coating on the thin wire. Such an electrode is<br>
suitable for use with a host tube such as catheter (i.e., an electromyographic<br>
(EMG) catheter) or a nasogastric tube.<br>
The present invention further includes a method of making a thin-<br>
wire, ring-type electrode as described above, as well a host tube comprising<br>
such an electrode, including a catheter or a nasogastric tube. In one<br>
embodiment, the method of making the electrode comprises:<br>
winding one end of a thin metal wire around a cylinder to form the<br>
loop portion; and<br>
fusing the free end of the loop portion of the thin metal wire to the<br>
wire portion.<br>
A number of electrodes may be made in accordance with the<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/074557	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
invention to produce an electrode assembly that is suitable for a host tube,<br>
such as a catheter. In one embodiment, the method of making such a catheter<br>
comprises:<br>
winding one end of a thin metal wire around a cylinder to form the<br>
loop portion of the electrode;<br>
fusing the free end of the loop portion of the thin metal wire to the<br>
wire portion;<br>
mounting the loop portion onto the catheter; and<br>
inserting the wire portion into the lumen of the catheter.<br>
The electrode catheter itself is comprised of:<br>
an elongated tubular body made of resilient material and having at<br>
least one lumen; and<br>
an electrode assembly consisting of at least one thin-wire, ring-type<br>
electrode having a loop portion and a wire portion, wherein the loop portion<br>
is positioned around the tubular body and said wire portion is positioned<br>
within the lumen of the tubular body.<br>
In an alternative embodiment to the present invention, a wire carrier<br>
may be used to produce an electrode assembly suitable for positioning on a<br>
host tube. This wire carrier comprises:<br>
at least one transversal indent through which the loop portion can be<br>
mounted on the wire carrier; and<br>
a longitudinal, inner groove in which the wire portion of the electrode<br>
can be placed.<br>
Yet another alternative method for making a catheter with a thin-wire,<br>
ring-type electrode having a loop portion and a wire portion in accordance with<br>
the present invention comprises:<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/074557	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
inserting a thin-wire electrode bundle that is bent into a U-shape<br>
through an opening in the catheter using a guide wire having a hook for<br>
engaging the loop part of the U-shaped bundle.<br>
The above and other objects, advantages and features of the<br>
present invention will become more apparent upon reading of the following non<br>
restrictive description of illustrative embodiments thereof, given by way of<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/074557	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
The non-restrictive illustrative embodiments of the present invention<br>
are concerned with an electrode and electrode catheter using thin metallic<br>
threads or wires, for example, microwires having diameters as low as 10-6 to<br>
10-4 meters or less (there is no known lower limit except with regards to tensile<br>
strength of the wire). The embodiments allow for the efficient mounting of at<br>
least one electrode on a catheter, resulting in the creation of a flexible ring-<br>
microelectrode that is suitable for, amongst other things, the detection of<br>
myoelectrical activity in a patient's muscle, such as the diaphragm or other<br>
inspiratory-related muscle. Advantageously, and in contrast to older<br>
techniques, the method of the present invention does not involve a lot of time<br>
consuming wire-by-wire pulling.<br>
Example 1<br>
According to a first non-restrictive illustrative embodiment, a thin-<br>
wire ring-type electrode for use with a catheter consists of a loop portion 10 and<br>
a wire portion 20. A method for making the loop portion 10 and wire portion 20<br>
 is illustrated in Figure 1. A thin wire 30 of suitable metal or alloy from a spool 40<br>
is wound around a hollow cylinder 50 to form a loop 10. The free end 60 of the<br>
thin wire 30 is clamped by a clamp device 70 to the wire section 20 for fusion. If<br>
a coated thin wire is used, both the free end 60 and the wire portion 20 can be<br>
heated by the clamp device 70, thereby heating and fusing the coating. An<br>
alternate method when using a coated or non-coated thin wire is to apply an<br>
extra layer of coating and then letting the coating dry, with or without heat, to<br>
fuse the free end 60 to the wire portion 20. Alternative methods for producing<br>
the loop portion 10 of the thin wire 30 are known and may also be used.<br>
In theory any metal, alloy or conducting material such as conducting<br>
polymers could be chosen as electrode material since the wet environment of<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/074557	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
the oesophagus makes the conducting properties less important. However<br>
since the electrodes are exposed to the human body the metals, alloys, etc.<br>
that can be used are reduced to those that are-non poisonous to the human<br>
body. Such materials include, in particular but not exclusively, platinum, gold,<br>
titanium, silver, silver chloride and stainless steel as is known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art. Although stainless steel will be described as a non-<br>
limitative example for the material of the electrode in the present and following<br>
examples because it is strong, non-corrosive and cheap, other materials such<br>
as those indicated in the foregoing description could also be considered as long<br>
as the wires that can be made therewith are sufficiently thin.<br>
Once the free end 60 and the wire portion 20 of the thin wire 30 have<br>
been fused together, i.e., once the loop 10 of thin wire has been formed, the<br>
wire forming the free end 60 is cut close to the fused area and sealed. The wire<br>
portion 20 is then cut at a desired length.<br>
The process is repeated along the cylinder 50 at desired interspaces<br>
and as many times as required to produce a required number of ring-type<br>
electrodes.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2, the eventual insulation or coating of the<br>
loop portions 10 of thin wire is then removed. A method of removing the coating<br>
consists of dipping the cylinder 50 along with the array 80 of loop portions 10 in<br>
an acid bath or other solvent 90 to dissolve the insulation or coating of the loop<br>
portions 10, thereby leaving the wire portions 20 insulated or coated. In an<br>
alternative embodiment, a non-coated thin wire is used to make the loop<br>
portions 10 and the wire portions 20, and the wire portions 20 are subsequently<br>
coated with electrical insulation using techniques known to those of ordinary<br>
skill in the art.<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/074557	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
Referring now to Figure 3, the loop portions 10 on the hollow<br>
cylinder 50 are then mounted onto a catheter tubing 100 and preferably on a<br>
catheter tubing having a wire lumen 110. The catheter tubing 100 is slid into the<br>
cylinder 50 provided with the thin wire loop portions 10, as shown in Figure 3.<br>
To facilitate sliding of the catheter tubing 100 into the cylinder 50 with the thin<br>
wire loop portions 10, the catheter tubing 100 can be stretched thereby<br>
narrowing its diameter. This can be done by first introducing a guide (not<br>
shown) into the cylinder 50 and attaching it to the distal end 102 of the catheter<br>
tubing 100 to pull onto this distal end. The loop portions 10 are slid off the<br>
hollow cylinder 50 at their respective positions on the catheter tubing 100 as<br>
the hollow cylinder 50 is removed from the catheter tubing 100, as shown in<br>
Figure 4. When the array 80 of loop portions 10 is in the desired position on the<br>
catheter tubing 100, stretching of the catheter tubing 100 is released, thereby<br>
expanding its diameter to tightly fit the loop portions 10 around the catheter<br>
tubing 100 and thereby fixing the array 80 of loop portions 10 in their respective<br>
positions. To avoid entanglement of the free ends of the wire portions 20, the<br>
free ends of the wire portions 20 can be temporarily attached to a suitable<br>
support (see for example 500 in Figure 5) or stored on spools (not shown).<br>
After the operation illustrated in Figure 4 has been completed, the<br>
ring-type electrode array 81 (Figure 5) is in place on the catheter tubing 100,<br>
but the wire portions 20 must still be inserted or passed through the wire lumen<br>
110 of the catheter tubing 100. A method for performing this operation is<br>
illustrated in Figure 5.<br>
According to the method of Figure 5, a needle 120 with an eye 121<br>
near the tip 122 is passed through the wire lumen 110 of the catheter tubing<br>
100 from a proximal end 101 toward the distal end 102 thereof, through the<br>
loop portions 10 until the tip 122 of the needle 120 reaches the most distal loop<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/074557	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
portion 101. Starting from this most distal loop portion 10i, the needle tip 122 is<br>
pushed to pierce the wall of the catheter tubing 100 until at least a portion (for<br>
example, one-half) of the eye of the needle 121 appears on the outside of the<br>
catheter tubing 100, preferably near or at the junction between the loop portion<br>
101	and the wire portion 20.) of the most distal thin-wire ring-type electrode. To<br>
facilitate piercing of the wall of the catheter tubing 100 with the needle tip 122,<br>
transversal cuts or holes may be made through the catheter tubing 100 into the<br>
wire lumen 110 prior to this process. The free end of the wire portion 20i is<br>
then inserted through the eye of the needle 121 and a section of the wire<br>
portion 201 is pulled through the eye of the needle 121. The needle 120 is then<br>
pulled back away from the distal end 102, thereby inserting the wire portion 20i<br>
of the most distal thin-wire ring-type electrode 10^ 20 into wire lumen 110 of<br>
the catheter tubing 100.<br>
Then, the needle 120 is pulled back until its tip 122 is located close<br>
to the second most distal thin-wire loop portion 102 and again the needle tip<br>
122 is pushed to penetrate the wall of the catheter tubing 100 until at least a<br>
portion (for example, one-half) of the eye of the needle 121 appears on the<br>
outside of the catheter tubing 100, preferably near or at the junction between<br>
the loop portion 102 and the wire portion 202 of the second most distal thin-wire<br>
ring-type electrode. The free end 130 of the wire portion 202 is passed though<br>
the eye of the needle 121 and the wire portion 202 is pulled through the eye of<br>
the needle 121. The needle 120 is then pulled back away from the distal end<br>
102	thereby also inserting the wire portion 202 into the wire lumen 110 of the<br>
catheter tubing 100 along with the wire portion 201 of the most distal thin-wire<br>
ring-type electrode.<br>
The above process is repeated for each thin-wire ring-type electrode<br>
103,203 and 104,204 of the catheter tubing 100 such as to pull by means of the<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/074557	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
needle 121 all the wire portions 20 within the wire lumen 110 of the catheter<br>
tubing 100, as shown in Figures 6a and 6b. A method using several needles<br>
for simultaneously piercing several point of the wall of the catheter tubing 100<br>
to simultaneously pull a plurality of wire portions 20 may also be envisaged<br>
without departing from the present invention. Also, the number of thin-wire ring-<br>
type electrodes 10,20 is not restricted to four (4).<br>
Once at least a portion of all the wire portions 201, 202, 203 and 204<br>
have been pulled into the wire lumen 110 of the catheter tubing 100, the needle<br>
120 is pulled from the wire lumen 110 of the catheter tubing 100 such that at<br>
least a portion of each of the wire portions 201, 202, 203 and 204 protrudes from<br>
the proximal end 101 of the wire lumen 110. While the wire portions 201, 202,<br>
203 and 204 are still inserted in the eye of the needle 120, a shield and/or<br>
insulating tubing can be pushed over the end of the needle 120 opposite to the<br>
tip 122. The insulating tubing is pushed past the tip of the needle 122, over the<br>
wire portions 201, 202, 203 and 204 until it reaches the proximal end 101 or a<br>
position close to the proximal end 101 of the wire lumen 110 of the catheter<br>
tubing 100 on which the loop portions 101, 102, 103 and 104 are mounted, such<br>
as to cover at least a portion of the wire portions 201, 202, 203 and 204<br>
protruding from the wire lumen 110. The shield and/or insulating tubing is then<br>
pushed further into the wire lumen 110 of the catheter tubing 100 and secured<br>
to this position such that none of the wire portions 201, 202, 203, 204 are<br>
exposed near the proximal end 101 of the wire lumen 110.<br>
Then, the loop portions 101, 102, 103 and 104 on the outside of the<br>
catheter tubing are covered and the holes created in the wall of the catheter<br>
tubing 100 by the needle 120 are filled. This covering and hole filling is<br>
performed by dipping the electrode array 82 on the catheter tubing 100 (see<br>
Figure 6b) in a coating bath or other alternative device (not shown) while<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/074557	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
ensuring that no dipping material/coating enters the large catheter lumen 115 of<br>
the catheter tubing 100 that bears the loop portions 101, 102,103 and 104.<br>
Referring now to Figure 8, the electrode array 83 on the catheter<br>
tubing 100 is mounted or slid on a nasogastric tube 200. To facilitate the<br>
mounting or sliding of the catheter tubing 100, the nasogastric tube 200 can be<br>
stretched thereby narrowing its diameter. This can be done by first introducing<br>
a guide (not shown) in the large catheter lumen 115 of the catheter tubing 100<br>
and attaching it to the distal end 201 of the nasogastric tube 200 to pull onto<br>
the distal end 201. When the electrode array 83 is in the desired position,<br>
stretching of the nasogastric tube 200 is released, thereby expanding its<br>
diameter and fixing the electrode array 83 in this position. For example, to<br>
ensure that the electrode array 83 is fixedly secured in position on the<br>
nasogastric tube 200, this nasogastric tube 200 can be coated with glue or<br>
similar compound or treated with a solvent prior to the release of the stretch.<br>
Other fastening or securing methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art<br>
may also be used.<br>
The above described method for mounting an electrode array 83 can<br>
be either applied to a separate catheter tubing 100 which is then mounted on a<br>
nasogastric tube 200 as shown in Figure 8, or directly on a nasogastric tube<br>
whereby the operation illustrated in Figure 8 is no longer required.<br>
Use of thin wires, for example microwires having diameters of the<br>
order of 10-6 to 10-4 meters, to form a ring around a catheter can efficiently<br>
serve as an electrode to measure signals when surrounded by bodily fluids or<br>
electrolyte charged materials. Also, when fully annealed and curved, the ring-<br>
like thin-wire electrodes are soft and flexible, allowing them to flex or bend with<br>
the catheter without damaging surrounding tissue.   Moreover, by using thin<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/074557	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
wires it is possible to coat the exterior of the array such that none of the<br>
metallic electrodes actually comes into contact with bodily tissues or fluids,<br>
thereby permitting the use of a wider variety of metals or alloys to manufacture<br>
the electrodes.<br>
The resulting array of thin-wire ring-type electrodes can be dipped<br>
into a solution to control resistivity between the different pairs of laterally<br>
adjacent electrodes, as taught by International patent application No.<br>
PCT/CA2004/000550 filed on April 8, 2004. In the same manner, the resulting<br>
array of thin-wire ring-type electrodes can be used in combination with a<br>
motion-artifact-reducing interface applied to the electrodes to prevent direct<br>
contact between tissues of the living body and the electrodes, as taught by<br>
International patent application PCT/CA99/00652 filed on July 16, 1999. This<br>
applies to all of various embodiments described below.<br>
In a non-restrictive illustrative embodiment, the hollow cylinder 50<br>
shown in Figures 1 and 2 can be replaced by a grooved and indented wire<br>
carrier 400, of which examples are illustrated in Figures 9, 10, 11a and 11b.<br>
The wire carrier 400 can be of any desired shape and size, examples of which<br>
are shown in Figures 9, 10, 11a and 11b. Wire carrier 400 is formed with a<br>
series of transversal indents such as 401 at desired intervals through which the<br>
loop portions 10 can be mounted onto the wire carrier 400 by using, for<br>
example, the method shown in Figures 1,2 and 3 or any other method of fixing<br>
the wire loops onto the wire carrier 400. The wire carrier 400 also has a<br>
longitudinal, inner groove 420 in which the wire portions 20 can be placed as<br>
shown in Figures 10, 11 and 12, thereby not necessitating the insertion of the<br>
insulated wire portions 20 as illustrated in Figures 5, 6a and 6b.<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/074557	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
After the bared wire loop portions 10 have been mounted on the wire<br>
carrier 400 and after the insulated wire portions 20 have been placed inside the<br>
wire carrier 400, the wire carrier 400 can be mounted onto a host tube 440 (for<br>
example a nasogastric tube) with a lumen 460 and a groove 450 adapted to<br>
receive the wire carrier 400, as shown, for example, in Figures 9 and 12. The<br>
wire carrier 400 is secured in the groove 450 using mechanical means such as<br>
clipping, glue or any other method known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
A complete array according to the non-restrictive illustrative<br>
embodiment of Figures 9-12 is shown in Figure 13.<br>
In operation, the thin-wire ring-type electrode array according to the<br>
illustrative embodiments of the present invention must be connected to a<br>
proper amplifier device. Referring now to Figure 7, a method of connecting an<br>
electrode catheter to an amplifier is shown. Instead of soldering a wire to a<br>
connector, which can be problematic when using stainless steel, for example,<br>
and to avoid poor connections due to an intermediate connector, the proposed<br>
method consists of using the wire portions 20 as contact areas for the electrode<br>
array. This method requires no solder equipment. To construct a female<br>
connector 300, the insulation is first removed from each wire portion 20. Each<br>
wire portion such as 20 is wound around a hollow box 305 made of conductive<br>
or non-conductive material with openings from the inside out of the hollow box<br>
305, for example, windows 306 to permit direct contact with the wire portion 20<br>
from the inside of the hollow box 305. The wound wire portion 20 is secured on<br>
the hollow box 305 by encapsulating it with glue, plastic or other adequate<br>
coating (not shown). The operation is repeated individually for each of the other<br>
wire portions 20, each wire being wound around a separate box 305. Each box<br>
is then mounted into a main connector body (not shown). The male connector<br>
310 simply comprises spring loaded wires that, when inserted into the female<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/074557	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
connector 300, will contact the wound wire portion 20 of the female connector<br>
from the inside of the hollow box 305 through the windows 306. The male<br>
connector 310 is connected directly to an amplifier through a wire such as 320.<br>
Alternatively, the wire portion 20 itself can be used as a connector.<br>
For example, the wire portion 20 can be wound onto a spool or otherwise<br>
shaped to form a connector receptacle capable of receiving a male spring-<br>
loaded connector plug. In the same manner, the wire portion 20 can be wound<br>
on a spool or otherwise shaped to form a connector plug capable of being<br>
received into a spring-loaded connector receptacle.<br>
Example 2<br>
The following describes an alternative method of making an<br>
electrode in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Turning now to Figure 14 of the appended drawings, a catheter<br>
tubing 700 provided with three lumens (only one of which is identified, namely<br>
lumen 706). Figure 14 also shows tools used in the placement of electrodes<br>
onto the catheter tubing 700, namely a guide wire 710, which is inserted into<br>
one of the lumens 706, as well as a cutting tool 730 placed adjacent the distal<br>
end 701 of the catheter tubing 700. The catheter tubing 700 is advantageously<br>
made of resilient material, for example plastic material.<br>
According to the non-restrictive illustrative embodiment shown in<br>
Figure 14, the guide wire 710 having a hook 712 at its proximal end is inserted<br>
into the lumens 706 at the proximal end 702 of the catheter tubing 700. As<br>
better illustrated in Figures 15 and 16, the cutting tool 730, which is used to<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/074557	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
make a controlled opening 740 (see Figure 17) into the wall of the catheter<br>
tubing 700 near its distal end 701, comprises a razorblade 732 with elevated<br>
perpendicular knifes 7341, 7342, 7343, 7344, 7345 and a stopper 736 at the top<br>
of the knives 734.<br>
Referring to Figures 16 and 17, when the cutting tool 730 is applied<br>
to the catheter tubing 700, the razorblade 732 creates a lengthwise slit 742<br>
while the knives 7341, 7342, 7343, 7344, 7345 create short rips 7441, 7442, 7443,<br>
7444, 7445 radial to the catheter tubing 700. The stopper 736 defines the depth<br>
of the rips 7441, 7442, 7443, 7444, 7445 into the wall of the catheter tubing 100.<br>
It is to be understood that even though five knives 7341, 7342, 7343, 7344, 7345<br>
are shown, any number of knives may be used depending on the application.<br>
Optionally, as may be better seen from Figure 14, the distal end 714 of the wire<br>
guide 707 may have markings 716 for the positioning of the cutting tool 730<br>
knives 7341, 7342,7343,7344, 7345 onto the wall of the catheter tubing 700.<br>
A thin-wire electrode bundle 720 is bent into a U-shape, the loop part<br>
726 of which is engaged with the hook 712 of the guide wire 710. The thin-wire<br>
electrode bundle 720, shown in Figure 18, is composed of individual thin-wire<br>
electrodes 7201, 7202, 7203, 7204, 7205 which are insulated except for each of<br>
their respective ends 7221, 7222, 7223, 7224. 7225 and 7241, 7242, 7243, 7244,<br>
7245. After the opening 740 has been created into the wall of the catheter<br>
tubing 700 using the cutting tool 730, the guide wire 710 is retracted through<br>
the opening 740 so that the distal end 714 of the guide wire 710 starts<br>
protruding from the lengthwise slit 742. The catheter tube 700 may then bend<br>
so that the guide wire 710 may be pulled through the slit 742, which in turn<br>
pulls the loop part 726 of the electrode wire bundle 720 through the slit 742 as<br>
well.<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/074557	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
After the wire guide 710 has exited the catheter tubing 700 through<br>
the opening 740, the loop part 726 of the thin-wire electrode bundle 720 is<br>
disengaged from the hook 712 of the wire guide 710. For the sake of clarity,<br>
Figure 19 illustrates a single thin-wire electrode 7201 having a loop part 7261<br>
protruding from the opening 740. The loop part 726i is then positioned around<br>
the distal end 701 of the catheter tubing 700 and placed in a corresponding rip<br>
441 (see Figure 20). By pulling the ends 7221, 7241 corresponding to the loop<br>
7261 at the proximal end 702 of the catheter tubing 700, the loop part 7261 is<br>
tightened around the catheter tubing 700. The radial rip 7441 prevents the loop<br>
part 7261 from being tilted towards the proximal end 702 of the catheter tubing<br>
700. The above process is repeated for each of the remaining thin-wire<br>
electrodes 7202, 7203, 7204, 7205-<br>
Once the thin-wire electrodes 7201f 7202, 7203, 7204, 7205 are<br>
positioned within their respective rips 7441, 7442, 7443, 7444, 7445, the opening<br>
740 may be closed by slightly pulling at the respective ends 7221, 7222, 7223,<br>
7224l 7225 and 7241, 7242, 7243, 7244, 7245 of the thin-wire electrodes 7201,<br>
7202, 7203, 7204l 7205. A slight bend of the catheter tubing 700 may help<br>
ensure that the thin-wire electrodes 7201, 7202, 7203, 7204, 7205 are not stuck<br>
in the opening 740 as its closes. In order not to interfere with already positioned<br>
thin-wire electrodes 7201, 7202, 7203, 7204, 7205, it may be advantageous to<br>
start positioning the thin-wire electrodes 7201, 7202, 7203, 7204, 7205 most<br>
towards the proximal end 702 of the catheter tubing 700. Since all the ends<br>
7221, 7222, 7223, 7224, 7225 and 7241, 7242, 7243, 7244, 7245 of each of the<br>
thin-wire electrodes 7201, 7202, 7203, 7204l 7205 are at the proximal end 702 of<br>
the catheter tubing 700, the risk of having loose electrode ends sticking out in<br>
the distal end 701 is eliminated.<br>

Use of thin-wires, for example, microwires having diameters of the<br>
order of 10-6 to 10-4 meters, to form loops around a catheter may efficiently<br>
serve as electrodes to measure signals when surrounded by bodily fluids or<br>
electrolyte charged materials. Also, when fully annealed and curved, the loop<br>
thin-wire electrodes are soft and flexible, allowing them to flex or bend with the<br>

is possible to coat the exterior of the array such that none of metallic electrodes<br>
actually comes into contact with bodily tissues or fluids, thereby permitting the<br>
use of a wider variety of metals or alloys to make the electrodes.<br>
Referring to Figures 21, 22, 23 and 24, and with reference back to<br>
Figures 18, 19 and 20, after the thin-wire electrodes 7201, 7202, 7203, 7204,<br>
7205 have been positioned around the catheter tubing 700, their respective<br>
ends 7221, 7222, 7223, 7224, 7225 and 7241, 7242, 7243, 7244, 7245 may be<br>
wound around a slitted female or male contact pin 755 using a wrapping tool<br>
760 which also releases a spring 752 over the thin-wire electrodes 7201, 7202,<br>
7203, 7204, 7205. The wrapping tool 760 may also be used as an insertion tool<br>
for mounting the contact pin 755 in a plastic contact housing (not shown). For<br>
the sake of clarity, only the female version of the contact pin 755 and one thin-<br>
wire electrode 7201 are illustrated, though it is to be understood that a male<br>
contact pin may be used as well and that the procedure holds for all remaining<br>
thin-wire electrodes 7202,7203, 7204,7205.<br>
The wrapping tool 760 keeps the thin-wire electrodes 7201, 7202,<br>
7203, 7204, 7205 in place as they are wrapped around the contact pin 755. A<br>
notch 762 in the spring support 764 of the wrapping tool 760 acts as a channel<br>
for the thin-wire electrodes 7201, 7202, 7203, 7204, 7205. This means that the<br>
thin-wire electrodes 7201, 7202, 7203, 7204, 7205 are put through the spring<br>
support 764 before the spring 752 is pressed onto the contact pin 755. As the<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2006/074557	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
contact pin 755 is spun using the rotating pin 766, the spring 752 is pushed<br>
away from the spring support 764 by the spring push-out 768 and lands on the<br>
thin-wire electrodes 7201, 7202, 7203, 7204, 7205 that are being spun in the<br>
opposite direction. When the spinning is finished, constant pressure between<br>
the thin-wire electrodes 7201, 7202, 7203, 7204, 7205 and the contact pin 55 is<br>
provided by the spring 752.<br>
As a final step, the distal end 701 of the catheter tubing 700 may be<br>
dipped in a curing solvent such as, for example, D3 that with capillary force fills<br>
the lengthwise slit 742 and seals the radial rips 7441, 7442, 7443, 7444,7445.<br>
Alternatively, the thin-wire electrode ends 7221( 7222, 7223, 7224,<br>
7225 and 7241, 7242, 7243, 7244, 7245 may be used as connectors. For<br>
example, the thin-wire electrode ends 7221, 7222, 7223, 7224, 7225 and 7241,<br>
7242, 7243,7244, 7245 may be wound onto a spool or otherwise shaped to form<br>
a connector receptacle capable of receiving a male spring-loaded connector<br>
plug. In the same, manner, the thin-wire electrode ends 7221, 7222, 7223, 7224,<br>
7225 and 7241, 7242, 7243, 7244, 7245 may be wound on a spool or otherwise<br>
shaped to form a connector plug capable of being received into a spring-loaded<br>
connector receptacle. Furthermore, reliable connection to electrical contacts<br>
may also be improved by using a redundant wire.<br>
Example 3<br>
An alternative to the above described embodiments comprises the<br>
following mechanical modification in respect of an electromyographic (EMG)<br>
catheter.<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2006/074557	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
One of the problems associated with installing a number of isolated<br>
very thin (for example, 60 pm thin) stainless steel wires 830 (Figure 25a) into a<br>
small lumen in the catheter is that it is difficult to keep the wires together, as<br>
they tend to get themselves entangled. This problem makes it difficult to adjust<br>
the wires so that just the part that is without isolation in on the outside of the<br>
catheter.<br>
It has been found practical to collect all wires using a braided tube<br>
(not shown) with just a very thin wall which has a low friction to the catheter and<br>
to the isolation on the wires. The use of cable braids in electrical assemblies is<br>
common, preferably as protective cover keeping multiple cables together. The<br>
braid is a woven mesh like tube made of synthetic material, and has the<br>
property that the diameter of the tube is reduced if the tube is stretched and<br>
vice versa. If the applied stretching of the tube is removed, the tube will expand<br>
to its natural diameter as is well known to a person skilled in the art. Braid like<br>
tubes of silk are also known from medical applications, sutures, but these are<br>
not as resilient /easily expanded as the synthetic braids. A novel method to use<br>
a braid as an active part in EMG catheter will be described in detail herein<br>
below.<br>
The wires can be braided loosely by machine so that the desired<br>
wire length is cut from a spool and the ends are uncovered by removing the<br>
braided tube by heat or other suitable means. Preferably the proximal end 833<br>
has a minor part of the braid uncovered compared to the distal end 834 where<br>
the electrode loops are to. be formed. The wires are then readily isolated.<br>
Alternatively, the wires may be pulled through a prefabricated braided tube 880<br>
using a guide wire 810, as illustrated in Figure 25b and Figure 25c.<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2006/074557	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
To install the wires in the catheter 800, a guide wire 810 with a hook<br>
at its distal end is inserted through a hole in a lumen 806 of the catheter at the<br>
proximal end 801 of the catheter as shown schematically in Figure 26b. When<br>
the hook appears in a hole on the distal end 801 of the catheter, the hook is<br>
inserted into the proximal end 833 of the braid holding the wire bundle. The<br>
braided tube can now be pulled through the lumen 106 to the proximal end 802,<br>
and the proximal end 834 of the braid is pulled out of the lumen 106 at the<br>
proximal end 802 or through the side of the proximal end 802 of the catheter.<br>
Since the braid itself tends to squeeze the wires as the braid is elongated, the<br>
wires are held together by the compression force induced by the hook and a<br>
force holding the braid at the distal end 334, there will be less risk of the wires<br>
getting entangled within the lumen 806 when pulled through the lumen (Figure<br>
26a).<br>
Loops are made in the vicinity of the distal end 801. At the proximal<br>
end 802, the braided hose runs in a plastic tube for protection to a male<br>
connector (not shown).<br>
There are a number of ways to produce said loops without diverting<br>
from the inventive concept of using a compressing braid. An embodiment is<br>
disclosed in Figures 27a and 27b. For the sake of clarity only one unbraided<br>
wire is shown. In Figure 27a, the wire bundle is in position in the lumen 806 apd<br>
the hook is dismantled from the braid, thereby lessening the compression force<br>
to a minimum. In practice, the compression force will be close to zero. It is now<br>
possible to position the individual wire 830 in the lumen 806 by pulling the wire<br>
at its proximal and distal ends 833, 834. The insulation of the wire can be<br>
readily peeled using any suitable method as shown in Figure 27a, or the<br>
coating can be removed afterwards as discussed previously in relation to<br>
Figure 2. It is to be noted that only a length corresponding to the circumference<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2006/074557	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
of the catheter is peeled off the wire, thus leaving the distal end 834 of the wire<br>
coated to avoid short circuiting problems.<br>
A piercing needle 884 with a hook can be used to pierce the outer<br>
wall of the catheter. The catheter may be marked with a series of dots 883 to<br>
indicate the locations of the electrodes, and the needle 884 is pulled out of the<br>
catheter having the wire 830 on the hook, as shown in Figure 27b. A sufficient<br>
length of the wire is pulled out of the catheter to position the loop around the<br>
catheter close to the distal end 801, and the electrode wire loop will position<br>
itself when the wire is pulled into the catheter in a manner similar to what is<br>
shown in Figures 19 and 20. The procedure is repeated for each individual<br>
wire 830 to produce the electrodes. The braid can be left inside the catheter or<br>
removed prior to the electric connection of the wire at its proximal end 833.<br>
The holes that were made in the catheter during the process of<br>
bringing the braided wire bundle into the catheter to make the electrodes are<br>
sealed by any suitable method. Such methods are within the purview of those<br>
of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
As previously stated, other methods using the braid technique may<br>
be used and will be discussed briefly.<br>
A possible method is to follow the procedure disclosed in Figures<br>
27a and 27b but the distal end 834 is peeled completely prior to inserting the<br>
wires into the catheter. This simplifies the method used to peel the wire from its<br>
insulation, since no chemicals need to be used. In this case, the catheter is<br>
provided with a small rip at each electrode position. This can be done prior to<br>
the piercing of the catheter. Instead of bringing out a loop, the entire uncovered<br>
distal end 884 is brought out, wound around the catheter and either fused, tied<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2006/074557	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
or knitted in the rip to enhance the positioning of the electrode loop. The holes<br>
and rips are sealed, as previously described.<br>
Another method is to provide the braided wires with ready-made<br>
loops. For example, the method shown in Figures 14 to 20 may be performed<br>
in reverse with a braided wire bundle pulled into a slit 42 and each wire loop<br>
positioned in a rip 44 defining an electrode position.<br>
Example 4<br>
Yet another alternative to the above described embodiments<br>
comprises the following electrical modification in respect of an EMG catheter.<br>
In catheters using multiple electrode arrangements for measuring,<br>
for example, EMG signals, a common problem is disturbances caused by tribo-<br>
electric charging. This effect occurs in four instances:<br>
1.	Surface contact effects (friction on the molecular level resulting in<br>
chemical bonds that leave imbalanced charges as the surfaces<br>
separate and make contact);<br>
2.	Work function (material ability to hold onto its free electrons);<br>
3.	Charge back flow (two materials that are charged from the above<br>
mechanisms and then separated); and<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2006/074557	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
4. Gas breakdown (due to surface topology with microscopic peaks and<br>
valleys, charges on the peaks cause corona discharge moving<br>
charges through the plasma to the other material).<br>
In the embodiments of the present invention, the braided wires have<br>
been pulled through a catheter lumen. The lumen size must therefore be<br>
slightly larger than the total diameter of the braided wires because of the pulling<br>
tool and in order to adjust the wires. When the ready-made catheter is moved,<br>
the wires inside the lumen will scratch against each other and to the wall of the<br>
lumen. Then, the triboelectric charges give a disturbance because of the high<br>
impedance in the body contact. These movements in the catheter occur when<br>
the catheter is inserted into a patient and the patient moves while breathing,<br>
etc. In other words, a small charge in high impedance of the system can result<br>
in a relatively high output voltage, a noise signal. This is a negative effect,<br>
particularly if the patient is being treated for a severe condition, and a<br>
consequence could be that the equipment connected to the catheter detects a<br>
false pulse and trigger the ventilator in an unwanted way, resulting in a less<br>
effective therapy.<br>
To overcome the above problem and minimize the triboelectric<br>
effect, the material should be carefully selected. Different plastic material<br>
combinations will have higher triboelectric charges than others. However, by<br>
inserting materials that discharge and prevent charges to occur, the choice of<br>
insulators may be made less critically.<br>
An alternative is to introduce conducting materials in the braid. In<br>
Figure 28a, carbon coal fiber is used in the braid. A positive side effect apart<br>
from leveling out induced charges is that the braid may also be used as a<br>
capacitive screen to prevent main disturbances from reaching the wires. Any<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2006/074557   	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
conducting or semi-coriducting material can be considered, such as metals,<br>
conducting polymers, etc.<br>
In one embodiment, a stabilizing cotton core is introduced in the wire<br>
bundle, as illustrated in Figure 28a. The core will keep the thin steel wires in<br>
place and evenly distributed around the core. Thus, the insulation of the wires<br>
will be subject to an even distribution of movement and a more equal<br>
distribution of charges. Cotton is a neutral material that does not cause<br>
charges. Dissipating materials may further remove charges so that they do not<br>
reach the electrodes.<br>
In yet another alternate embodiment shown in Figure 28b, a<br>
conducting braid as described above is used. It is similar to the embodiment<br>
shown in Figure 28a, but differs by not having a cotton core. The electrical<br>
properties will not be as good but will be sufficient. On the other hand, a<br>
smaller lumen can be used, and thus the diameter of the catheter will be<br>
smaller. This may be an important feature to take into account when making<br>
catheters intended for infant use.<br>
Furthermore, a possible embodiment is a configuration with a cotton<br>
core as in Figure 28a but with the difference in having bare wires without<br>
insulation alternating with insulating dummy wires in-between every conductor<br>
to overcome short circuiting problems. This would also require a braid made of<br>
a dissipating material, meaning that the conductivity is less than the<br>
conductivity of a semiconductor but better than an insulator to transport<br>
induced charges. The advantage would be that no peeling of the wires to make<br>
the electrode loops are necessary, chemically or mechanically, but the trade off<br>
is that twice as many wires has to be configured around the cotton core.<br>

to length and prepared for window strip (see 901).<br>
2.	Referring to Figure 30, the ten wires 900 are hooked onto a guide<br>
wire 902 and passed through the hollow core of a 0 US silk leaving<br>
the window strip portion of the wires exposed at the distal end of the<br>
silk.<br>
3.	Referring to Figure 31, the silk 904 containing the wires 900 is<br>
hooked to a guide wire and passed through the wire lumen from the<br>
distal end to the proximal end of a specially designed polyurethane<br>
tube 903.<br>
4.	Referring to Figure 31, the window strip portion 901 is positioned 1<br>
cm distal of the ground ring location.<br>
5.	Referring to Figure 32, a small puncture 905 is made at the marked<br>
location of the Ground Ring with the sharp tip of a forcep, a single<br>
wire 900 is fished out and the window strip 901 is exposed forming a<br>
small loop 906.<br>
6.	Referring to Figure 33, the proximal tip 907 of the tube is carefully<br>
passed through the loop 906 formed by the wire in turn placing the<br>
wire around the tubing 903.<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2006/074557	PCT/CA2006/000049<br>
7.	Referring to Figure 34, both ends of the wire 900 are pulled until the<br>
loop 906 is tightened snugly around the tube 903 insuring that the<br>
window stripped portion 901 of the wire is fully exposed on the<br>
outside of the tube 903.<br>
8.	These above operation 107 are repeated for each remaining ring.<br>
