				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
RIGID POLYURETHANE FOAM<br>
This invention relates to rigid polyurethane or urethane -modified polyisocyanurate foams, to processes for their preparation and to polyol blends for use in said processes.<br>
Rigid polyurethane and urethane- modified polyisocyanurate foams are in general prepared by reacting a stoichiometric excess of polyisocyanate with isocyanate-reactive compounds in the presence of blowing agents, surfactants and catalysts. One use of such foams is as a thermal insulation medium in, for example, buildings.<br>
Polyether polyols or polyester polyols are generally used as isocyanate-reactive compounds .<br>
Polyester polyols impart excellent flame retardancy characteristics to the resulting polyurethane foams and can in some cases even be less expensive than polyether polyols.<br>
Tertiary amines are generally used as catalyst in rigid polyurethane foam systems based on polyester polyols.<br>
A problem encountered when using tertiary amine catalysts in these polyester rigid foam systems is that a cross-linked mass is obtained at a time when the foam has not fully filled the cavity yet (for example, of a laminated building panel) . This leads to dimensional stability problems due to density distribution problems and cell stretching of the obtained foam.<br>
Therefore it is an object of the present invention to provide a process for making rigid polyurethane foams based on polyester polyols not showing the disadvantages mentioned above.<br>
According to the present invention a process for making rigid polyurethane or urethane -modi fied polyisocyanurate foams is provided by reacting an organic polyisocyanate composition with an isocyanate-reactive composition comprising a polyester polyol in the presence of an amine catalyst (B) characterised in that the pKa of the conjugated ammoniumsalt of the amine (BH*) is less than 12, preferably less than 10, more preferably less than 8.<br>
pKa = - log K, = - log [B] [H+] / [BH+]<br>
An acceptable rise profile is obtained having a fast initial foam rise leading to a smooth processability resulting in a better density<br><br>
distribution, lower minimum stable density and fill weights and higher compression strength of the foam.<br>
Preferred catalysts to be used in the process of the present invention include aliphatic or aromatic tertiary amines preferably containing a supplemental heteroatom in the ring or functional groups having a positive inductive and/or positive mesomeric effect (for example, alkyl groups or amino groups). Examples include 2,2'-dimorpholinodiethylether, Texacat DP-914 (available from Texaco Chemical), N,N-dimethylpiperazine, l-methylimidazole, 2-methyl-l-vinylimidazole, 1-allylimidazole, l-phenylimidazole, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylimidazole, 1(3-aminopropyl)imidazole, pyrimidazole, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, 4-pyrrolidinopyridine, 4-morpholinopyridine, 4-methylpyridine, N-dodecyl-2-methylimidazole and triazines such as tris(dimethylaminopropyl)hexahydrotriazine. Especially preferred catalysts are 2,2'-dimorpholinodiethylether, Texacat DP-914, 1-methylimidazole and 4-dimethylaminopyridine.<br>
One or more of the above described catalysts can be used in the process of the present invention.<br>
Some of the above described catalysts are known in polyurethane foam production primarily for flexible foam production (see, for example, US 5430071, US 3645925, US 3661808, US 4228248, EP 672696, EP 401787). Their use in rigid polyurethane foam systems based on polyester polyols has not been described heretobefore.<br>
In general, the catalysts described above are used according to the invention in an amount of between 0.05 and 5 %, preferably between 0.1 and 4 % by weight based on the isocyanate-reactive composition.<br>
In addition to the above described catalyst other catalysts known in rigid polyurethane foam production can be used.<br>
These include aliphatic tertiary amines having pKa values above 12. Examples of additional amine catalysts include dimethylbenzylamine, bis-dimethylaminoethylether (Niax Al available from OSi) and pentamethyl diethylenetriamine (Desmorapid PV available from BASF) . Especially addition of Desmorapid PV is preferred; the reaction profile is further smoothen. Said additional catalysts are generally used in amounts varying between 0.01 and 5 %, preferably between 0.05 and 2 % by weight based on the isocyanate-reactive composition.<br>
The term "polyester polyol" as used herein is meant to include any polyester polyol having a hydroxyl functionality of at least two wherein the majority of the recurring units contain ester linkages and the molecular weight is at least 400.<br>
The polyester polyols for use in the present invention advantageously have an average functionality of about 1.8 to 8, preferably about 2 to 6 and more preferably about 2 to 2.5. Their hydroxyl number values generally fall within a range of about 15 to 750, preferably about 30 to 550 and more preferably about 200 to 550 mg KOH/g. The molecular weight of the polyester polyol generally falls within the range of about 400 to about 10000, preferably about 1000 to about 6000. Preferably the polyester polyols have an acid number between 0.1 and 20 mg KOH/g; in general the acid number can be as high as 90 mg KOH/g.<br>
The polyester polyols of the present invention can be prepared by known procedures from a polycarboxylic acid or acid derivative, such as an anhydride or ester of the polycarboxylic acid, and any polyhydric alcohol. The polyacid and/or polyol components may be used as mixtures of two or more compounds in the preparation of the polyester polyols.<br>
The polyols can be aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic and/or heterocyclic. Low molecular weight aliphatic polyhydric alcohols, such as aliphatic dihydric alcohols having no more than about 20 carbon atoms are highly satisfactory. The polyols optionally may include substituents which are inert in the reaction, for example, chlorine and bromine substituents, and/or may be unsaturated. Suitable amino alcohols, such as, for example, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, or the like may also be used. A preferred polyol component is a glycol. The glycols may contain heteroatoms (e.g., thiodiglycol) or may be composed solely of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. They are advantageously simple glycols of the general formula CnH2n(OH)2 or polyglycols distinguished by intervening ether linkages in the hydrocarbon chain, as represented by the general formula CnH2nOx(OH) 2. Examples of suitable polyhydric alcohols include: ethylene glycol, propylene glycol -(1,2) and -(1,3), butylene glycol -(1,4) and -(2,3), hexanediol -(1,6), octanediol -(1,8), neopentyl glycol, 1,4-bishydroxymethyl cyclohexane, 2-methyl-1,3-propane diol, glycerin, trimethylolethane, hexanetriol -(1,2,6), butanetriol -(1,2,4), quinol, methyl glucoside, triethyleneglycol, tetraethylene glycol and higher polyethylene glycols, dipropylene glycol and higher polypropylene glycols, diethylene glycol, glycerol, pentaerythritol, trimethylolpropane, sorbitol, mannitol, dibutylene glycol and higher polybutylene glycols. Especially suitable polyols are alkylene glycols and oxyalkylene glycols, such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, tetrapropylene glycol, trimethylene glycol, tetramethylene glycol and 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol (1,4-bis-hydroxymethylcyclohexane).<br>
The polycarboxylic acid component may be aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic<br>
and/or heterocyclic and may optionally be substituted, for example, by halogen atoms and/or may be unsaturated.  Examples of suitable carboxylic acids and derivatives thereof for the preparation of the polyester polyols include: oxalic acid, malonic acid, adipic acid, glutaric acid, succinic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, phthalic acid, phthalic acid anhydride,  terephthalic anhydride,  isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, trimellitic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid anhydride, pyromellitic   dianhydrida,   hexahydrophthalic   acid   anhydride, tetrachlorophthalic  acid anhydride,  endomethylene  tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, glutaric acid anhydride, maleic acid, maleic acid anhydride, terephthalic acid dimethylester, terephthalic acid-bis glycol ester, fumaric acid, dibasic and tribasic unsaturated fatty acids optionally mixed with monobasic unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acids.<br>
While the polyester polyols can be prepared from substantially pure reactant materials, more complex ingredients can be used, such as the side-stream, waste or scrap residues from the manufacture of phthalic acid, terephthalic acid, dimethyl terephthalate, polyethylene terephthalate, and the like. These compositions can be converted by reaction with polyols to polyester polyols through conventional transesterification or esterification procedures.<br>
The production of the polyester polyols is accomplished by simply reacting the polycarboxylic acid or acid derivative with the polyol component in a known manner until the hydroxyl and acid values of the reaction mixture fall in the desired range. After transesterification or esterification the reaction product can optionally be reacted with an alkylene oxide.<br>
The term "polyester polyol" as used herein includes any minor amounts of unreacted polyol remaining after the preparation of the polyester polyol and/or unesterified polyol (e.g., glycol) added after the preparation. The polyester polyol can advantageously include up to about 40 % by weight free glycol. Preferably the free glycol content is from 2 to 30, more preferably from 2 to 15 % by weight of the total polyester polyol component.<br>
Aliphatic and/or aromatic polyester polyols can be used according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
Mixtures of two or more different polyester polyols may be used.<br>
and is need an amaunt of beliven 0.005 and 5% by weight losed on the isoayanate reactive composition<br>
Accordingly there is provided process for making rigid polyurethane or urethane-modified polyisocyanurate foams comprising the step of reacting an organic polyisocyanate composition with an isocyanate-reactive composition comprising a polyester polyol in the presence of amine catalyst characterized in that the pKa of the conjugated ammonium salt of said amine is less than 12, wherein said amine catalyst is selected from the group consisting of 2, 2'-dimorpholinodiethylether, 1-methylimidazole, 4-<br>
dimethylaminopyridine saidpolyester polyol  and has an average functionality of 1.8 to 8,  a<br>
hydroxyl number of 15 to 750 mg KOH/g and a molecular weight of 400 to 10000 and constitutes at least 10% by weight of the total isocyanate-reactive compounds.<br>
According to the present invention the polyester polyols described above can constitute the totality of the reactive; miture  reacted with the polyisocyanate; it is understood, however, that these polyols could also be used mixture with other isocyanate-reactive compounds conventionally used in the art; preferably at least 10% by weight, more preferably at least 20%<br>
by weight of the total isocyanate-reactive compounds are polyester polyols as described above.<br>
The isocyanate-reactive compounds which can be employed in combination with the polyester polyols in the preparation of the rigid polyurethane foams of the present invention include any of those known in the art for that purpose. Of particular importance for the preparation of rigid foams are polyols and polyol mixtures having average hydroxyl numbers of from 300 to 1000, especially from 300 to 700 mg KOH/g, and hydroxyl functionalities of from 2 to 8, especially from 3 to 8. Suitable polyols have been fully described in the prior art and include reaction products of alkylene oxides, for example ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide, with initiators containing from 2 to 8 active hydrogen atoms per molecule. Suitable initiators include: polyols, for example glycerol, trimethylolpropane, triethanolamine, pentaerythritol, sorbitol and sucrose; polyamines, for example ethylene diamine, tolylene diamine, diaminodiphenylmethane and polymethylene polyphenylene polyamines; and aminoalcohols, for example ethanolamine and diethanolamine; and mixtures of such initiators. Further suitable polymeric polyols include hydroxyl terminated polythioethers, polyamides, polyesteramides, polycarbonates, polyacetals, polyolefins and polysiloxanes.<br>
Any of the blowing agents known in the art for the preparation of rigid polyurethane or urethane-modified polyisocyanurate foams can be used in the process of the present invention. Such blowing agents include water or other carbon dioxide-evolving compounds, or inert low boiling compounds having a boiling point of above -70°C at atmospheric pressure.<br>
Where water is used as blowing agent, the amount may be selected in known manner to provide foams of the desired density, typical amounts being in the range from 0.05 to 5 % by weight based on the total reaction system.<br>
Suitable inert blowing agents include those well known and described in the art, for example, hydrocarbons, dialkyl ethers, alkyl alkanoates, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorocarbons and fluorine-containing ethers.<br>
Examples of preferred blowing agents include isobutane, n-pentane, isopentane, cyclopentane or mixtures thereof, 1,l-dichloro-2-fluoroethane (HCFC 141b), 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-fluoroethane (HFC 134a), chlorodifluoro-methane (HCFC 22), 1,1-difluoro-3,3,3-trifluoropropane (HFC 245fa). Particular mention may be made of blowing agent mixtures as described in PCT Patent Publication No. 96/12758, incorporated herein by reference, for manufacturing low density, dimensionally stable rigid foam. These blowing<br>
agent mixtures generally comprise at least 3 and preferably at least 4 components of which preferably at least one is a (cyclo)alkane (preferably of 5 or 6 carbon atoms) and/or acetone.<br>
The blowing agents are employed in an amount sufficient to give the resultant foam the desired bulk density which is generally in the range 15 to 70 kg/m3, preferably 20 to 50 kg/m3, most preferably 25 to 40 kg/m3. Typical amounts of blowing agents are in the range 2 to 25 % by weight based on the total reaction system.<br>
When a blowing agent has a boiling point at or below ambient it is maintained under pressure until mixed with the other components. Alternatively, it can be maintained at subambient temperatures until mixed with the other components.<br>
Other optional additives for the polyol blends of the present invention include crosslinking agents, for examples low molecular weight polyols such as triethanolamine, processing aids, viscosity reducers, dispersing agents, plasticizers, mold release agents, antioxidants, fillers (e.g. carbon black), cell size regulators such as insoluble fluorinated compounds (as described, for example, in US 4981879, US 5034424, US 4972002, EP 0508649, EP 0498628, WO 95/18176), non-amine polyurethane catalysts (e.g. stannous salts of carboxylic acids), trimerisation catalysts (e.g. alkali metal carboxylic acid salts), surfactants such as polydimethylsiloxane-polyoxyalkylene block copolymers and non-reactive and reactive fire retardants, for example halogenated alkyl phosphates such as tris chloropropyl phosphate, triethylphosphate, diethylethylphosphonate and dimethylmethylphosphonate. The use of such additives is well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Another useful additive particularly to further improve the reaction profile is an organic carboxylic acid, especially a carboxylic acid containing at least one OH, SH, NH2 or NHR functional group, wherein R is an alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl group.<br>
Such carboxylic acids have the general formula Xn - R' - (COOH)m wherein X is OH, SH, NH2 or NHR, R1 is an at least divalent hydrocarbon moiety, typically an at least divalent linear or branched aliphatic hydrocarbon moiety and/or an at least divalent alicyclic or aromatic hydrocarbon moiety, n is an integer having a value of at least 1 and allows for mono and polyfunctional substitution on the hydrocarbon moiety, m is an integer having a value of at least 1 and allows for mono and polycarboxyl substitution on the hydrocarbon moiety. The "at least divalent hydrocarbon moiety" can be a saturated or unsaturated moiety of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, including a linear aliphatic moiety, a branched aliphatic moiety, an<br>
alicyclic moiety or an aromatic moiety.  Stated otherwise, R1 can, for<br>
example, be a linear or branched alkylene group of 1 to 10 carbon atoms, a<br>
cyclic alkylene group of 4 to 10 carbon atoms, or an arylene, an alkarylene<br>
or an ararylene group of 6 to 20 carbon atoms.  Specific non-limiting<br>
examples of suitable hydrocarbon moieties are methylene, ethylene, n-<br>
propylene, isopropylene, n-butylene, isobutylene, n-amylene, n-decylene, 2-<br>
ethylhexylene, o-, m-, p-phenylene, ethyl-p-phenylene, 2,5-naphthylene,<br>
p,p'-biphenylene,   cyclopentylene,   cycloheptylene,   xylylene,   1,4-<br>
dimethylenephenylene and the like.  While above-noted radicals have two<br>
available substitution sites, at least one for a carboxyl group and one for<br>
a OH, SH, NHj or NHR group, it is contemplated that additional hydrogens on<br>
the hydrocarbon could be replaced with further carboxyl and/or OH, SH, NH2<br>
or NHR groups.<br>
Such carboxylic acids generally have molecular weights below about 250.<br>
The following carboxylic acids are especially suitable: citric acid,<br>
dimethylolpropionic acid, 2-hydroxymethylpropionic acid, bishydroxypropionic<br>
acid, salicylic acid, m-hydroxy benzoic acid, p-hydroxy benzoic acid,<br>
dihydroxybenzoic acid, glycolic acid, 0-hydroxybutyric acid, cresotic acid,<br>
3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid,  lactic acid,  tartaric acid,  malic acid,<br>
resorcylic acid, hydroferulic acid, glycine, alanine, mercaptoacetic acid<br>
and the like.<br>
Preferably X is OH, n is 1, R' is a linear or branched aliphatic hydrocarbon<br>
having 1 to 5 carbon atoms and m is 1, 2 or 3.<br>
Most preferred carboxylic acids are lactic acid, glycolic acid, malic acid<br>
and citric acid.<br>
At least one of said carboxylic acids is used; mixtures of two or more of<br>
these acids can be used as well.<br>
Particularly preferred carboxylic acids are malic acid or a combination of<br>
malic acid and citric acid, preferably in a weight ratio of between 75:25<br>
and 25:75, most preferably in a weight ratio of about 1:1.<br>
The carboxylic acid is generally used in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 5 %<br>
by weight based on the isocyanate-reactive composition, preferably about 1<br>
% to 3 %.<br>
Suitable organic polyisocyanates to be reacted with the isocyanate-reactive composition to form rigid polyurethane or urethane-modified polyisocyanurate foams include any of those known in the art for the preparation of rigid polyurethane or urethane-modified polyisocyanurate foams, and in particular the aromatic polyisocyanates such as diphenylmethane diisocyanate in the form of its 2,4'-, 2,2'- and 4,4'-isomers and mixtures thereof, the mixtures of diphenylmethane diisocyanates (MDI) and oligomers thereof known in the art as "crude" or polymeric MDI (polymethylene polyphenylene polyisocyanates) having an isocyanate functionality of greater than 2, toluene diisocyanate in the form of its 2,4- and 2,6-isomers and mixtures<br>
thereof, 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate and 1,4-diisocyanatobenzene.  Other<br>
organic polyisocyanates which may be mentioned include the aliphatic<br>
diisocyanates such as isophorone diisocyanate, 1,6-diisocyanatohexane and<br>
4 , 4 '-diisocyanatodicyclohexylmethane. Further suitable polyisocyanates for<br>
use in the process of the present invention are those described in EP-A-<br>
0320134.<br>
Modified polyisocyanates, such as carbodiimide or uretonimine modified<br>
polyisocyanates can also be employed.<br>
Still other useful organic polyisocyanates are isocyanate-terminated<br>
prepolymers prepared by reacting excess organic polyisocyanate with a minor<br>
amount of an active hydrogen-containing compound.<br>
Preferred polyisocyanates to be used in the present invention are the<br>
polymeric MDI's.<br>
The quantities of the polyisocyanate composition and the polyfunctional isocyanate-reactive composition to be reacted can be readily determined by the man skilled in the art. In general the NCO:OH ratio falls within the range 0.85 to 1.40, preferably about 0.98 to 1.20. Also higher NCO:OH ratios (for example, up to 3.0) fall within the present invention.<br>
In operating the process for making rigid foams according to the invention, the known one-shot, prepolymer or semi-prepolymer techniques may be used together with conventional mixing methods and the rigid foam may be produced in the form of slabstock, mouldings, cavity fillings, sprayed foam, frothed foam or laminates with other materials such as hardboard, plasterboard, plastics, paper or metal.<br>
It is convenient in many applications to provide the components for polyurethane production in pre-blended formulations based on each of the primary polyisocyanate and isocyanate-reactive components. In particular, many reaction systems employ a polyisocyanate-reactive composition which contains the major additives such as the catalyst and the blowing agent in addition to the polyisocyanate-reactive component or components.<br>
Therefore the present invention also provides a polyfunctional isocyanate-reactive composition comprising a polyester polyol and an amine catalyst as defined above.<br>
In order to stabilise said pre-blended systems (preferably hydroxy-)functionalised carboxylic acids as described above are preferably added.<br>
The foams of the present invention are advantageously used for producing laminates whereby the foam is provided on one or both sides with a facing<br>
sheet. The laminates are advantageously made in a continuous or discontinuous manner by depositing the foam-forming mixture on a facing sheet and preferably placing another facing sheet on the deposited mixture. Any facing sheet previously employed to produce building panels can be employed and can be of a rigid or flexible nature.<br>

Rigid polyurethane foams were made from a polyol composition and a polyisocyanate composition containing the ingredients listed below in Table 1 at an NCO index of 1.15.<br>
The reaction profile was followed in respect of cream time (time taken for the reaction mixture to start foaming) and string time (time taken for the reaction mixture to reach the transition point from fluid to cross-linked mass) . The height of expansion was measured at the string time and also at the end of rise of the foam; from those two figures the expansion factor at string time (height at string/height at end of rise) was determined. The results are also given in Table 1.<br>
The rise profile was also followed by Dynamic Flow Data analysis. Results are presented in Figures 1 and 2 expressing the height of the rising foam versus the reaction time.<br>
These results show that using amine catalysts according to the present invention (Foams no. 2 to 6) leads to improved reaction profiles compared to foams of the prior art (Foam No. 1) (see Figure 1).<br>
Addition of selected classes of other catalysts such as Desmorapid PV (Foam No. 7) further improves the reaction profile (see Figure 2).<br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
Rigid polyurethane foams were made from a polyol composition and a polyisocyanate composition containing the ingredients listed below in Table 2 at an NCO index of 2.20.<br>
The reaction profile was followed in respect of cream time (time taken for the reaction mixture to start foaming) and string time (time taken for the reaction mixture to reach the transition point from fluid to cross-linked mass) . The height of expansion was measured at the string time and also at the end of rise of the foam; from those two figures the expansion factor at string time (height at string/height at end of rise) was determined. The results are also given in Table 2.<br>
The rise profile was also followed by Dynamic Flow Data analysis. Results are presented in Figure 3 expressing the height of the rising foam versus the reaction time.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Panels were made from the formulations 1, 2 and 7 as defined in Table 1 using a high pressure machine (Hennecke HK 650). Temperature of the chemicals: 20°C; output: 681 g/sec; pressure: 150 bar.<br>
A horizontal mould of dimensions 330 x 100 x 10 cm was used with injection sidewards (right hand side) at the initial part thereof. Temperature of the mould: 37°C.<br>
Foams were made to an overpack density of 40 to 41 g/1. Foam No. 7 was also made at even higher overpack (Foam No. 7 bis) .<br>
The following measurements were done on the obtained moulded foams: core and overall density (according to standard ISO 845) in the left and right hand corner of the initial part of the mould (injection part) and of the final part of the mould (end of the panel), compression strength in the three dimensions (according to standard ISO 844) in the centre of the initial part and in the centre of the final part, dimensional stability (according to standard ISO 2796) of the panels (final part) after storage for 24 hours at room temperature and another 48 hours at -25°C, at 70°C and 90% relative humidity and at 100°C, respectively. The results are given in Table 3.<br>
These results show that foams according to the present invention (Foams No. 2 and 7) have a better density distribution profile than foams of the prior art (Foam No. 1); less variation in density is obtained over the whole of the panel. Also the compression strength is more uniform over the whole panel.<br>
Further improvements are obtained by adding Desmorapid PV (Foam No. 7 vis-avis Foam No. 2).<br><br>

EXAMPLE 4<br>
Rigid polyurethane foams were made from a polyol composition and a polyisocyanate composition containing the ingredients listed below in Table<br>
4	at an NCO index of 1.15.<br>
The reaction profile was followed in respect of cream time (time taken for the reaction mixture to start foaming) and string time (time taken for the reaction mixture to reach the transition point from fluid to cross-linked mass) . The height of expansion was measured at the string time and also at the end of rise of the foam; from those two figures the expansion factor at string time (height at string/height at end of rise) was determined. The results are also given in Table 4.<br>
These  results  show  that  the  best  results  are  obtained  when dimorpholinodiethylether or N-ethylmorpholine is used as catalyst.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Rigid polyurethane foams were made from a polyol composition and a polyisocyanate composition containing the ingredients listed below in Table<br>
5	at an NCO index of 1.15.<br>
The reaction profile was followed in respect of cream time (time taken for the reaction mixture to start foaming) and string time (time taken for the reaction mixture to reach the transition point from fluid to cross-linked mass) . The height of expansion was measured at the string time and also at the end of rise of the foam; from those two figures the expansion factor at string time (height at string/height at end of rise) was determined. The results are also given in Table 5.<br>
