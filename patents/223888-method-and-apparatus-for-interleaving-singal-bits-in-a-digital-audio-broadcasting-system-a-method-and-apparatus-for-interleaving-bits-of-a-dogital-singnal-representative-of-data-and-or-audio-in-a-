				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR INTERLEAVING SIGNAL BITS IN A DIGITAL<br>
AUDIO BROADCASTING SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention relates to In-Band On-Channel (IBOC) Digital Audio Broadcasting<br>
(DAB), and more particularly to methods and apparatus for interleaving signal bits in a DAB<br>
system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] IBOC DAB systems are designed to permit a smooth evolution from current<br>
analog Amplitude Modulation (AM) and Frequency Modulation (FM) radio to a fully digital<br>
In-Band On-Channel system. These systems can deliver digital audio and data services to<br>
mobile, portable, and fixed receivers from terrestrial transmitters in the existing Medium<br>
Frequency (MF) and Very High Frequency (VHF) radio bands. Broadcasters may continue<br>
to transmit analog AM and FM simultaneously with the new, higher-quality and more robust<br>
digital signals, allowing conversion from analog to digital radio while maintaining current<br>
frequency allocations.<br>
[0003] Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) can provide digital-quality audio, superior to<br>
existing analog broadcasting formats. Both AM and FM In-Band On-Channel DAB signals<br>
can be transmitted in a hybrid format where the digitally modulated signal coexists with the<br>
currently broadcast analog signal, or in an all-digital format where the analog signal has<br>
been eliminated. IBOC DAB requires no new spectral allocations because each IBOC DAB<br>
signal is transmitted within the spectral mask of an existing AM or FM channel allocation.<br>
IBOC DAB promotes economy of spectrum while enabling broadcasters to supply digital<br>
quality audio to the present base of listeners.<br>
[0004] One AM IBOC DAB system, set forth in U. S. Patent No. 5,588,022, presents a<br>
method for simultaneously broadcasting analog and digital signals in a standard AM<br>
broadcasting channel. Using this approach, an amplitude-modulated radio frequency signal<br>
having a first frequency spectrum is broadcast. The amplitude-modulated radio frequency<br>
signal includes a first carrier modulated by an analog program signal. Simultaneously, a<br>
plurality of digitally modulated carrier signals are broadcast within a bandwidth that<br>
encompasses the first frequency spectrum. Each digitally modulated carrier signal is<br>
modulated by a portion of a digital program signal. A first group of the digitally modulated<br>
carrier signals lies within the first frequency spectrum and is modulated in quadrature with the<br>
first carrier signal. Second and third groups of the digitally-modulated carrier signals lie in<br>
upper and lower sidebands outside of the first frequency spectrum and are modulated both in-<br>
phase and in-quadrature with the first carrier signal. Multiple carriers employ orthogonal<br>
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to bear the communicated information.<br>
[0005] FM IBOC DAB systems have been the subject of several United States patents<br>
including Patents No. 6,510,175; 6,108,810; 5,949,796; 5,465,396; 5,315,583; 5,278,844<br>
and 5,278,826. In an FM compatible digital audio broadcasting system, digitally encoded<br>
audio information is transmitted simultaneously with the existing analog FM signal channel.<br>
The advantages of digital transmission for audio include better signal quality with less noise<br>
and wider dynamic range than with existing FM radio channels. Initially the hybrid format<br>
would be used allowing existing receivers to continue to receive the analog FM signal while<br>
allowing new IBOC DAB receivers to decode the digital signal. Sometime in the future,<br>
when IBOC DAB receivers are abundant, broadcasters may elect to transmit the all-digital<br>
format. Hybrid IBOC DAB can provide virtual CD-quality stereo digital audio (plus data)<br>
while simultaneously transmitting the existing FM signal. All-digital IBOC DAB can<br>
provide virtual CD-quality stereo audio along with a data channel.<br>
[0006] One proposed FM IBOC DAB uses a signal that includes orthogonal frequency<br>
division multiplexed (OFDM) sub-carriers in the region from about 129 kHz to 199 kHz<br>
away from the FM center frequency, both above and below the spectrum occupied by an<br>
analog modulated host FM carrier. An IBOC option, shown in U. S. Patent No. 6,430,227,<br>
permits subcarriers starting as close as 100 kHz away from the center frequency. The<br>
bandwidth of the existing analog FM signal is significantly smaller than the bandwidth<br>
occupied by the OFDM subcarriers.<br>
[0007] OFDM signals include a plurality of orthogonally spaced carriers all modulated at<br>
a common symbol rate. The frequency spacing for the pulse symbols (e.g., BPSK, QPSK,<br>
8PSK or QAM) is equal to the symbol rate. For IBOC transmission of FM DAB signals,<br>
redundant sets of OFDM subcarriers are placed in an upper sideband (USB) and a lower<br>
sideband (LSB) on either side of a coexisting analog FM carrier. The DAB subcarrier power<br>
is set to about -25 dB relative to the FM signal. The level and spectral occupancy of the DAB<br>
signal is set to limit interference to its FM host while providing adequate signal-to-noise ratio<br>
(SNR) for the DAB sub-carriers. Certain ones of the subcarriers can be reserved as reference<br>
subcarriers to transmit control signals to the receivers.<br>
[0008] One feature of digital transmission systems is the inherent ability t6 simultaneously<br>
transmit both digitized audio and data. Digital audio information is often compressed for<br>
transmission over a bandlimited channel. For example, it is possible to compress the digital<br>
source information from a stereo compact disk (CD) at approximately 1.5 Mbps down to 96<br>
kbps while maintaining the virtual-CD sound quality for FM IB0C DAB. Further<br>
compression down to 48 kbps and below can still offer good stereo audio quality, which is<br>
useful for the AM DAB system or a low-latency backup and tuning channel for the FM DAB<br>
system. Various data services can be implemented using the composite DAB signal. For<br>
example, a plurality of data channels can be broadcast within the composite DAB signal.<br>
[0009] United States Patent Application No. 09/382,716, filed August 24,1999, and titled<br>

With Prioritized Messages For Digital Audio Broadcasting" (PCT Published Patent<br>
Application No. WO 0115358) discloses a method and apparatus for assembling modem<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0047] Referring to the drawings, FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram of a transmitter 10<br>
for use in a digital audio broadcasting system. The transmitter includes an input 12 for<br>
receiving a main program service audio signal, an input 14 for receiving station identification<br>
service data, and an input 16 for receiving main program service data, supplemental program<br>
service data, and auxiliary application service data. For hybrid DAB, the analog version of the<br>
main program service audio signal is delayed as shown by block 18 to produce a delayed<br>
analog audio signal on line 20. An audio subsystem 22 encodes and compresses the main<br>
program service audio signal to produce an encoded compressed digital signal on line 24. A<br>
transport and service multiplex subsystem 26 receives the encoded compressed digital signal,<br>
the station identification service data, the main program service data, supplemental program<br>
service data, and auxiliary application service data, and subjects those signals to various<br>
transport signal processing as discussed further below and represented in FIG. 1 as blocks 28,<br>
30 and 32. The resulting signals are multiplexed by service multiplexer 34 and sent to the RF<br>
transmission subsystem 36. The digital signal on line 38 is channel coded as shown by block<br>
40 and the resulting coded signal on line 42 is modulated along with the analog audio signal as<br>
illustrated by block 44. The resulting signal can then be amplified and broadcast by antenna<br>
46 to at least one of a plurality of IBOC DAB receivers 48.<br>
[0048] The system employs coding to reduce the sampled audio signal bit rate and<br>
baseband signal processing and to increase the robustness of the signal in the transmission<br>
channel. This allows a high quality audio signal plus ancillary data to be transmitted in<br>
band segments and at low levels which do not interfere with the existing analog signals.<br>
[0049] IBOC DAB signals can be transmitted in a hybrid format including an analog<br>
modulated carrier in combination with a plurality of digitally modulated carriers or in an all-<br>
digital format wherein the analog modulated carrier is not used.<br>
[0050] Diversity delay provides a fixed time delay in one of two channels carrying the<br>
same information to defeat non-stationary channel impairments such as fading and<br>
impulsive noise.<br>
[0051] FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of a hybrid FM IBOC waveform 50. The<br>
waveform includes an analog modulated signal 52 located in the center of a broadcast<br>
channel 54, a first plurality of evenly spaced orthogonally frequency division multiplexed<br>
subcarriers 56 in an upper sideband 58, and a second plurality of evenly spaced orthogonally<br>
frequency division multiplexed subcarriers 60 in a lower sideband 62. The digitally<br>
modulated subcarriers are broadcast at a lower power level than the analog modulated<br>
carrier to comply with required channel signal masks. The digitally modulated subcarriers<br>
are divided into partitions and various subcarriers are designated as reference subcarriers. A<br>
frequency partition is a group of 19 OFDM subcarriers containing 18 data subcarriers and<br>
one reference subcarrier.<br>
[0052] The hybrid waveform includes an analog FM-modulated signal, plus digitally<br>
modulated Primary Main subcarriers. The subcarriers are located at evenly spaced<br>
frequency locations. The subcarrier locations are numbered from -546 to +546. In the<br>
waveform of FIG. 2, the subcarriers are at locations +356 to +546 and -356 to -546. This<br>
waveform will normally be used during an initial transitional phase preceding conversion to<br>
the All Digital waveform.<br>
[0053] The digital signal is transmitted in primary main sidebands on either side of the<br>
analog FM signal, as shown in FIG. 2. Each primary main sideband is comprised of ten<br>
frequency partitions, which are allocated among subcarriers 356 through 545, or -356<br>
through -545. Subcarriers 546 and -546, also included in the primary main sidebands, are<br>
additional reference subcarriers. The amplitude of each subcarrier can be scaled by an<br>
amplitude scale factor.<br>
[0054] In the hybrid waveform, the digital signal is transmitted in Primary Main (PM)<br>
sidebands on either side of the analog FM signal, as shown in FIG. 2. Each PM sideband is<br>
comprised of ten frequency partitions, which are allocated among subcarriers 356 through<br>
545, or -356 through -545. Subcarriers 546 and -546, also included in the PM sidebands,<br>
are additional reference subcarriers. The amplitude of each subcarrier is scaled by an<br>
amplitude scale factor.<br>
[0055] FIG. 3 is a schematic representation of an extended hybrid FM IBOC waveform<br>
70. The extended hybrid waveform is created by adding primary extended sidebands 72,74 to<br>
the primary main sidebands present in the hybrid waveform. Depending on the service mode,<br>
one, two, or four frequency partitions can be added to the inner edge of each primary main<br>
sideband.<br>
[0056] The Extended Hybrid waveform includes the analog FM signal plus digitally<br>
modulated primary main subcarriers (subcarriers +356 to +546 and -356 to -546) and some<br>
or all primary extended subcarriers (subcarriers +280 to +355 and -280 to -355). This<br>
waveform will normally be used during an initial transitional phase preceding conversion to<br>
the All Digital waveform.<br>
[0057] Each primary main sideband includes ten frequency partitions and an additional<br>
reference subcarrier spanning subcarriers 356 through 546, or -356 through -546. The upper<br>
primary extended sidebands include subcarriers 337 through 355 (one frequency partition),<br>
318 through 355 (two frequency partitions), or 280 through 355 (four frequency partitions).<br>
The lower primary extended sidebands include subcarriers -337 through -355 (one frequency<br>
partition), -318 through -355 (two frequency partitions), or -280 through -355 (four frequency<br>
partitions). The amplitude of each subcarrier can be scaled by an amplitude scale factor.<br>
[0058] FIG. 4 is a schematic representation of an all-digital FM IBOC waveform 80. The<br>
all-digital waveform is constructed by disabling the analog signal, fully expanding the<br>
bandwidth of the primary digital sidebands 82, 84, and adding lower-power secondary<br>
sidebands 86, 88 in the spectrum vacated by the analog signal. The all-digital waveform in the<br>
illustrated embodiment includes digitally modulated subcarriers at subcarrier locations -546 to<br>
+546, without an analog FM signal.<br>
[0059] In addition to the ten main frequency partitions, all four extended frequency<br>
partitions are present in each primary sideband of the All Digital waveform. Each<br>
secondary sideband also has ten Secondary Main (SM) and four Secondary Extended (SX)<br>
frequency partitions. Unlike the primary sidebands, however, the Secondary Main<br>
frequency partitions are mapped nearer to channel center with the extended frequency<br>
partitions farther from the center.<br>
[0060] Each secondary sideband also supports a small Secondary Protected (SP) region<br>
90, 92 including 12 OFDM subcarriers and reference subcarriers 279 and -279. The<br>
sidebands are referred to as "protected" because they are located in the area of spectrum<br>
least likely to be affected by analog or digital interference. An additional reference<br>
subcarrier is placed at the center of the channel (0). Frequency partition ordering of the SP<br>
region does not apply since the SP region does not contain frequency partitions.<br>
[0061] Each Secondary Main sideband spans subcarriers 1 through 190 or -1 through -<br>
190. The upper Secondary Extended sideband includes subcarriers 191 through 266, and the<br>
upper Secondary Protected sideband includes subcarriers 267 through 278, plus additional<br>
reference subcarrier 279. The lower Secondary Extended sideband includes subcarriers -191<br>
through -266, and the lower Secondary Protected sideband includes subcarriers -267 through -<br>
278, plus additional reference subcarrier -279. The total frequency span of the entire All<br>
Digital spectrum is 396,803 Hz. The amplitude of each subcarrier can be scaled by an<br>
amplitude scale factor. The secondary sideband amplitude scale factors can be user selectable.<br>
Any one of the four may be selected for application to the secondary sidebands.<br>
[0062] The various DAB waveforms provide a flexible means of transitioning to a<br>
digital broadcast system by providing three new waveform types: Hybrid, Extended Hybrid,<br>
and All Digital. The Hybrid and Extended Hybrid types retain the analog FM signal, while<br>
the All Digital type does not. All three waveform types conform to the currently allocated<br>
spectral emissions mask.<br>
[0063] The digital signal is modulated using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing<br>
(OFDM). OFDM is a parallel modulation scheme in which the data stream modulates a<br>
large number of orthogonal subcarriers, which are transmitted simultaneously. OFDM is<br>
inherently flexible, readily allowing the mapping of logical channels to different groups of<br>
subcarriers.<br>
[0064] In the Hybrid waveform, the digital signal is transmitted in Primary Main (PM)<br>
sidebands on either side of the analog FM signal in the Hybrid waveform. The power level<br>
of each sideband is appreciably below the total power in the analog FM signal. The analog<br>
signal may be monophonic or stereo, and may include subsidiary communications<br>
authorization (SCA) channels.<br>
[0065] In the Extended Hybrid waveform, the bandwidth of the Hybrid sidebands can be<br>
extended toward the analog FM signal to increase digital capacity. This additional<br>
spectrum, allocated to the inner edge of each Primary Main sideband, is termed the Primary<br>
Extended (PX) sideband.<br>
[0066] In the All Digital waveform, the analog signal is removed and the bandwidth of<br>
the primary digital sidebands is fully extended as in the Extended Hybrid waveform. In<br>
addition, this waveform allows lower-power digital secondary sidebands to be transmitted in<br>
the spectrum vacated by the analog FM signal.<br>
[0067] The OFDM subcarriers are assembled into frequency partitions. Each frequency<br>
partition is comprised of eighteen data subcarriers and one reference subcarrier, as shown in<br>
FIG. 5 (ordering A) and FIG. 6 (ordering B). The position of the reference subcarrier<br>
(ordering A or B) varies with the location of the frequency partition within the spectrum.<br>
[0068] Besides the reference subcarriers resident within each frequency partition,<br>
depending on the service mode, up to five additional reference subcarriers are inserted into<br>
the spectrum at subcarrier numbers -546, -279, 0, 279, and 546. The overall effect is a<br>
regular distribution of reference subcarriers throughout the spectrum. For notational<br>
convenience, each reference subcarrier is assigned a unique identification number between 0<br>
and 60. All lower sideband reference subcarriers are shown in FIG. 7. All upper sideband<br>
reference subcarriers are shown in FIG. 8. The figures indicate the relationship between<br>
reference subcarrier numbers and OFDM subcarrier numbers.<br>
[0069] Each spectrum shown in the drawings includes subcarrier numbers and the center<br>
frequency of certain key OFDM subcarriers. The center frequency of a subcarrier is<br>
calculated by multiplying the subcarrier number by the OFDM subcarrier spacing Af. The<br>
center of subcarrier 0 is located at 0 Hz. In this context, center frequency is relative to the<br>
radio frequency (RF) allocated channel.<br>
[0070] FIG. 9 is a functional block diagram of the signal processing protocol layers 100 of<br>
a transmitter for use in a digital audio broadcasting system. FIG. 9 illustrates how control<br>
signals and information signals are passed through the various layers of the protocol stack to<br>
generate an IBOC signal on the broadcast side.<br>
[0071] The system can be used to provide various services including a Station<br>
Identification Service (SIS) and an Auxiliary Application Service (AAS), as illustrated by<br>
blocks 102 and 104.<br>
[0072] A data service interface 106 receives SIS and AAS signals as illustrated by<br>
arrows 108 and 110. A main program application 112 also supplies a main program service<br>
(MPS) data signal to interface 106 as shown by arrow 114. The data service interface<br>
outputs data to a channel multiplexer 116, which produces transfer frames as illustrated by<br>
arrow 118 for use by the RF/transmission system 120.<br>
[0073] The Main Program Service preserves the existing analog radio-programming<br>
formats in both the analog and digital transmissions. In addition, the Main Program Service<br>
can include digital data that directly correlates with the audio programming. The AM and<br>
FM systems share a common system protocol stack. FM and AM systems differ primarily<br>
in a modem/physical layer designated as Layer 1 (Ll). The upper layers are common to<br>
both the AM and FM systems.<br>
[0074] The SIS provides the necessary control and identification information that<br>
indirectly accommodates user search and selection of digital radio stations, and their<br>
supporting services. The SIS receives inputs from all other applications so that their status<br>
can be broadcast over the Primary IBOC Data Service (PIDS) Ll logical channels and/or<br>
Secondary IBOC Data Service (SIDS) Ll logical channels. The AAS allows a virtually<br>
unlimited number of custom and specialized digital applications to operate concurrently.<br>
Auxiliary applications can be added at any time in the future.<br>
[0075] FIG. 10 is a functional block diagram of modem/physical Layer 1 processing.<br>
Audio and data are passed from the higher protocol layers to the physical layer, the modem,<br>
through a plurality of Layer 1 service access points (SAP) 160.<br>
[0076] The Ll SAP defines the interface between Layer 2 and Layer 1 of the system<br>
protocol stack. Each channel enters Layer 1 in discrete transfer frames, with a unique size<br>
and rate determined by the service mode. Transfer frames that carry information from Layer<br>
2 are referred to as Ll Service Data Units (SDUs).<br>
[0077] The concept of logical channels and their function is central to the transport and<br>
transmission of data through the IBOC system. A logical channel is a signal path that<br>
conducts Layer 1 SDUs through Layer 1 with a specified grade of service. In FIG. 10 the<br>
logical channels are denoted by symbols such as P1, PIDS, S1, etc. The underscore<br>
indicates that the data in the logical channel is formatted as a vector.<br>
[0078] Scrambling randomizes the digital data in each logical channel to "whiten" and<br>
mitigate signal periodicities when the waveform is demodulated in a conventional analog<br>
FM demodulator. The bits in each logical channel are scrambled to randomize the time-<br>
domain data and aid in receiver synchronization. Scrambling is used to prevent long<br>
streams of l's or O's, or periodic data patterns which could cause difficulties in the<br>
synchronization process, or unintended interference due to higher than average frequency<br>
components in the modulated signal. The scrambling is often done at the modulation level<br>
after coding. However, the scrambling in a preferred embodiment of this system is done in<br>
the logical channel prior to encoding for convenience. In this case, the information bits are<br>
scrambled, which results in a somewhat scrambled modulated signal. Another benefit of<br>
scrambling in the logical channel is that some low level of security can be employed since<br>
the receiver must know the scramble code to decode the data. <br>
[0079] The inputs to the scramblers are the active logical channels from the LI SAP, as<br>
selected by the service mode. The outputs of the scramblers are transfer frames of<br>
scrambled bits for each of the active logical channels. The scrambler generates a<br>
pseudorandom code which is modulo-2 summed with the input, data vectors. The code<br>
generator is a linear feedback shift register.<br>
[0080] Channel coding comprises the functions of scrambling, channel encoding, and<br>
interleaving shown in FIG. 10. Each logical channel is scrambled and encoded separately<br>
and in parallel. All parallel scramblers are identical, but operate at different rates,<br>
depending on the active service mode. Each scrambler generates a maximal-length<br>
scrambling sequence using a linear feedback shift register with primitive polynomial. A<br>
given bit of a scrambled transfer frame is generated by modulo-2 adding the associated input<br>
bit with the corresponding bit of the scrambling sequence.<br>
[0081] Layer 1 of the FM system converts information and system control from Layer 2<br>
(L2) into the FM waveform for transmission in the VHF band. Information and control is<br>
transported in discrete transfer frames via multiple logical channels through the Layer 1<br>
service access point (SAP). These transfer frames are also referred to as Layer 1 service<br>
data units (SDUs).<br>
[0082] For each frequency partition, data subcarriers dl through dl8 convey the L1<br>
SDUs, while the reference subcarriers convey system control. Subcarriers are numbered<br>
from 0 at the center frequency to ±546 at either end of the channel frequency allocation.<br>
[0083] The Ll SDUs vary in size and format depending on the service mode. The<br>
service mode, a major component of system control, determines the transmission<br>
characteristics of each logical channel. After assessing the requirements of candidate<br>
applications, higher protocol layers select service modes that most suitably configure the<br>
logical channels. The requirements are also the criteria for selection. They include<br>
selection between hybrid and all-digital signals, band expansions in conjunction with a<br>
hybrid signal or separately with an all-digital signal, desired acquisition robustness, content<br>
latency and desired signal quality. The plurality of logical channels reflects the inherent<br>
flexibility of the system, which supports simultaneous delivery of various classes of digital<br>
audio and data.<br>
[0084] Layer 1 also receives system control from Layer 2 for use by the Layer 1 System<br>
Control Processor. The System Control Channel (SCCH) transports control and status<br>
information. Primary and secondary service mode control, amplitude scale factor select, and<br>
P3 interleaver select are sent from Layer 2 to Layer 1, while synchronization information is<br>
sent from Layer 1 to Layer 2.<br>
[0085] A system control data sequence is a sequence of bits destined for each reference<br>
subcarrier representing the various system control components relayed between Layer 1 and<br>
Layer 2. Several bits of the system control data sequence designated "reserved" are<br>
controlled from layers above Ll via the primary reserved control data interface and the<br>
secondary reserved control data interface.<br>
[0086] A service mode is a specific configuration of operating parameters specifying<br>
throughput, performance level, and selected logical channels. The service modes dictate all<br>
permissible configurations of the logical channels. There are a total of eleven service<br>
modes. The seven primary service modes are MP1, MP2, MP3, MP4, MP5, MP6, and<br>
MP7. They configure the primary logical channels. The four secondary service modes are<br>
MS1, MS2, MS3, and MS4. They configure the secondary logical channels.<br>
[0087] A logical channel is a signal path that conducts Ll SDUs in transfer frames into<br>
Layer 1 with a specific grade of service, determined by service mode. Layer 1 of the FM air<br>
interface provides ten logical channels to higher layer protocols. Not all logical channels are<br>
used in every service mode.<br>
[0088] There are four primary logical channels which are used with both the Hybrid and<br>
All Digital waveforms. They are denoted as P1, P2, P3, and PIDS. Table 1 shows the<br>
approximate information rate supported by each primary logical channel as a function of<br>
primary service mode.<br>
[0089] There are six secondary logical channels that are used only with the All Digital<br>
waveform. They are denoted as S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and SIDS. Table 2 shows the<br>
approximate information rate supported by each secondary logical channel as a function of<br>
secondary service mode.<br>
[0090] Logical channels P1 through P3 and S1 through S5 are designed to convey audio<br>
and data, while the Primary IBOC Data Service (PIDS) and Secondary IBOC Data Service<br>
(SIDS) logical channels are designed to carry IBOC Data Service (IDS) information.<br>
[0091] The performance of each logical channel is completely described through three<br>
characterization parameters: transfer, latency, and robustness. Channel encoding, spectral<br>
mapping, interleaver depth, and diversity delay are the components of these characterization<br>
parameters. The service mode uniquely configures these components within Layer 1 for<br>
each active logical channel, thereby determining the appropriate characterization<br>
parameters. In addition, the service mode specifies the framing and synchronization of the<br>
transfer frames through each active logical channel.<br>
[0092] Some processing stages shown in FIG. 10 are denoted by a logical channel<br>
subscript. For example, logical channel designations are subscripted with an "S" after<br>
scrambling and with a "G" after channel encoding. In addition, the primed notation (as in<br>
P1'g) indicates that the logical channel is processed differently than the "unprimed" channel<br>
and is destined for transmission in a different portion of the spectrum within the allocated<br>
bandwidth. The single underline notation for a logical channel name refers to the fact that<br>
data is passed between the various functions as vectors. Each logical channel has a<br>
dedicated scrambler and channel encoder.<br>
[0093] The L1 SAP 160 defines the interface between Layer 2 and Layer 1 of the system<br>
protocol stack. Each channel enters Layer 1 in discrete transfer frames, with unique size and<br>
rate determined by the service mode. Transfer frames that carry information from Layer 2<br>
are referred to as L1 SDUs.<br>
[0094] The scrambling function, illustrated as block 162, randomizes the digital data in<br>
each logical channel to mitigate signal periodicities. At the output of the scrambling<br>
function, the logical channel vectors retain their identity, but are distinguished by the "S"<br>
subscript, (e.g., "P1s").<br>
[0095] Channel Encoding, as illustrated in block 164, uses convolutional encoding to<br>
add redundancy to the digital data in each logical channel to improve its reliability in the<br>
presence of channel impairments. Channel encoding is used to add redundancy to each of<br>
the logical channels to improve the reliability of the transmitted information. The code rate<br>
defines the increase in overhead on a coded channel resulting from channel encoding. The<br>
code rate is the ratio of information bits to the total number of bits after coding.<br>
[0096] Convolutional encoding is a form of forward-error-correction channel encoding<br>
that inserts coding bits into a continuous stream of information bits to form a predictable<br>
structure. Unlike a block encoder, a convolutional encoder has memory, and its output is a<br>
function of current and previous inputs.<br>
[0097] The size of the logical channel vectors is increased in inverse proportion to the<br>
code rate. The code rate defines the increase in overhead on a coded channel resulting from<br>
channel encoding. It is the ratio of information bits to the total number of bits after coding.<br>
[0098] The encoding techniques are configurable by service mode. Diversity delay is<br>
also imposed on selected logical channels. Diversity delay provides a fixed time delay in<br>
one of two channels carrying the same information to defeat non-stationary channel<br>
impairments such as fading and impulsive noise.<br>
[0100] At the output of the channel encoder, the logical channel vectors retain their<br>
identity, but are distinguished now by the "G" subscript (e.g., "P1g")- In a few service<br>
modes, P1 and S1 are split to provide a delayed and undelayed version at the output.<br>
[0101] Interleaving in time and frequency, as shown in block 166, is employed to<br>
mitigate the effects of burst errors. The interleaving techniques are tailored to the VHF<br>
fading environment and are configurable by service mode. The statistics of multipath fading<br>
in the VHF channel, along with adjacent channel interference affects large groups of<br>
subcarriers, for example, the upper sideband or the lower sideband, or portions of these<br>
sidebands. The interleaving results in placing code bits such that the remaining good code<br>
bits (unaffected by interference) can accommodate a reasonable good "punctured"<br>
noncatastrophic code. Furthermore, the multipath fading statistics in the typical mobile<br>
VHF channel result in fades that are selective in frequency, and vary in time at a fade rate<br>
proportional to the vehicle speed. These frequency and time fading statistics influence the<br>
interleaver time span and frequency interleaving of the code bits. The frequency<br>
interleaving is exploited in the OFDM design. This interleaving results in significantly<br>
more robust performance in the channel. In this process, the logical channels lose their<br>
identity. The interleaver output is structured in a matrix format. Each matrix is comprised<br>
of one or more logical channels and is associated with a particular portion of the transmitted<br>
spectrum. The interleaver matrix designations reflect the spectral mapping. For example,<br>
"PM" maps to the Primary Main portion of the spectrum, and "SX1" maps to the Secondary<br>
Extended (SX) portion of the spectrum.<br>
[0102] System Control Processing, as illustrated in block 168, generates a matrix of<br>
system control data sequences that include control and status (such as service mode), for<br>
broadcast on the reference subcarriers. This data matrix is designated "R" for "Reference."<br>
[0103] OFDM Subcarrier Mapping, shown in block 170, assigns the interleaver matrices<br>
and the system control matrix to the OFDM subcarriers. One row of each active interleaver<br>
matrix is processed every OFDM symbol Ts to produce one output vector X, which is a<br>
frequency-domain representation of the signal. The mapping is specifically tailored to the<br>
non-uniform interference environment and is a function of the service mode. Some control<br>
information is needed at the receiver to enable subsequent deinterleaving and decoding in<br>
the various modes. This control information is generally not interleaved.<br>
[0104] OFDM Signal Generation, as shown in block 172, generates the digital portion<br>
of the time-domain FM waveform. The input vectors are transformed into a shaped time-<br>
domain baseband pulse, yn(t), defining one OFDM symbol.<br>
[0105] The Transmission Subsystem, as shown in block 174, formats the baseband<br>
waveform for transmission through the VHF channel. Major sub-functions include symbol<br>
concatenation and frequency up-conversion. In addition, when transmitting the Hybrid<br>
waveform, this function modulates the analog source and combines it with the digital signal<br>
to form a composite Hybrid signal, s(t), ready for transmission.<br>
[0106] The Extended Hybrid waveform is created by adding Primary Extended<br>
sidebands to the Primary Main sidebands present in the Hybrid waveform, as shown in FIG.<br>
3. Depending on the service mode, one, two, or four frequency partitions can be added to<br>
the inner edge of each Primary Main sideband.<br>
[0107] Each Primary Main sideband includes ten frequency partitions and an additional<br>
reference subcarrier spanning subcarriers 356 through 546, or -356 through -546. The upper<br>
Primary Extended sidebands include subcarriers 337 through 355 (one frequency partition),<br>
318 through 355 (two frequency partitions), or 280 through 355 (four frequency partitions).<br>
The lower Primary Extended sidebands include subcarriers -337 through -355 (one<br>
frequency partition), -318 through -355 (two frequency partitions), or -280 through -355<br>
(four frequency partitions). The amplitude of each subcarrier is scaled by an amplitude<br>
scale factor. There is a match between the significance of the encoded bits and the<br>
partitions assumed to be more subjected to impairments. So more significant code bits are<br>
located in the more protected partitions.<br>
[0108] The All Digital waveform is constructed by disabling the analog signal, fully<br>
expanding the bandwidth of the primary digital sidebands, and adding lower-power<br>
secondary sidebands in the spectrum vacated by the analog signal. The spectrum of the All<br>
Digital waveform is shown in FIG. 4.<br>
[0109] The System Control Channel (SCCH) passes discrete transfer frames of control<br>
and status information between Layer 2 and Layer 1. The control information, passed from<br>
Layer 2 to Layer 1, includes Primary Service Mode Control (PSM), Secondary Service<br>
Mode Control (SSM), and Amplitude Scale Factor Select (ASF). Status information passed<br>
from Layer 2 to Layer 1 is the P3 Interleaver Select (P3IS) (for Extended Hybrid and All<br>
Digital waveforms only). The status information passed from Layer 1 to Layer 2 consists of<br>
Absolute L1 Frame Number (ALFN) and L1 Block Count (BC). In addition, several bits of<br>
the system control data sequence designated "reserved" are controlled from layers above L1<br>
via the primary reserved control data interface and the secondary reserved control data<br>
interface. This status information and the L1 block count and indicators of the state of the<br>
control information (with the exception of ALFN) is broadcast on the reference subcarriers.<br>
[0110] The service mode dictates the configuration and performance of the logical<br>
channels. There are two basic types of service modes: primary, which configures primary<br>
logical channels, and secondary, which configures secondary logical channels.<br>
[0111] All waveforms require the definition of both primary and secondary service<br>
modes. If secondary sidebands are not present, the secondary service mode is set to "None".<br>
In one embodiment of the system, a total of eleven service modes support the delivery of<br>
various combinations and classes of digital audio and data.<br>
[0112] The active primary service modes (PSMs) are designated as MP1, MP2, MP3,<br>
MP4, MP5, MP6, and MP7. The active secondary service modes (SSMs) are designated as<br>
MS1, MS2, MS3, and MS4.<br>
[0113] The Primary Service Mode provides backward compatibility. Backward<br>
compatibility ensures that any new modes of operation still carry the Primary Service mode<br>
that can be decoded by any receiver. Primary service mode bit assignments greater than<br>
binary 000110 are reserved for future expansion. However, to ensure backward<br>
compatibility, all reserved primary service modes must maintain backward compatibility<br>
with one of the service modes MP1-MP6. As a minimum, backward compatibility includes<br>
the PIDS logical channel, the system control data sequence (matrix R) conveyed over the<br>
reference subcarriers, and at least one logical channel which can support medium quality<br>
digital audio. Any service mode that is backward compatible with hybrid service modes<br>
MP1-MP4 is also a hybrid service mode and the secondary service mode must be set to<br>
"None".<br>
[0114] A primary service mode may maintain backward compatibility with primary<br>
service modes MP5 and MP6 in one of two configurations. Both the P1 and P1' or only the<br>
P1' logical channels may be supported.<br>
[0115] When broadcasting secondary sidebands in the All Digital waveform, active<br>
primary and secondary service modes are both required. Service modes MP1 through MP4<br>
are invalid for the All Digital waveform. Only primary service modes MP5 through MP7<br>
may be paired with secondary service modes MS1 through MS4 when broadcasting the AH<br>
Digital waveform. Any combination of these primary and secondary service modes is<br>
allowable.<br>
[0116] Primary service mode control (PSM) and secondary service mode control (SSM)<br>
are received from Layer 2 via the SCCH at the rate Rf. Service mode changes are invoked<br>
only on an L1 frame boundary. However, not all service mode changes can be effected<br>
seamlessly (without disruption of Layer 1 service).<br>
[0117] In service modes MP2 - MP5 and MP7, the P3 logical channel may utilize either<br>
a short or long interleaver depth (time span). The long interleaver depth is more robust than<br>
the short interleaver depth. However, the long interleaver (about 1.48 seconds) results in a<br>
long decode time which affects receiver tuning time before audio can be heard. This long<br>
tuning time is unacceptable in some cases, so a short interleaver is used.<br>
[0118] Long or short interleaver is a relative term, in regards to the PDU length. A short<br>
interleaver encapsulates an amount of bits of a signal PDU, while a long interleaver can<br>
encapsulate bits from several consecutive PDUs. The length of the long interleaver is a<br>
parameter. There is a tradeoff between robustness and content availability delay. If delay is<br>
considered, at a time by a specific user for a specific case, to be the more important factor,<br>
then a short interleaver may be selected, resulting in limited robustness. If robustness is<br>
considered, under a given time and content combination, to be the more important factor,<br>
then a long interleaver may be selected.<br>
[0119] P3 Interleaver Select (P3IS) is received from L2 via the SCCH. When the<br>
system is transmitting in service modes MP1 or MP7 this bit is ignored by L1. When the<br>
state of P3IS changes (as detected on an L1 frame boundary) while transmitting in service<br>
mode MP2 - MP5 or MP7, there will be a discontinuity in the transmission of the P3 logical<br>
channel. Changes in the state of P3IS do not affect the operation of any other logical<br>
channel.<br>
[0120] The transmitted signal may be regarded as a series of unique L1 frames of<br>
duration Tf. A transfer frame is an ordered, one-dimensional collection of data bits of<br>
specified length originating in Layer 2, grouped for processing through a logical channel. In<br>
order to reference all transmissions to absolute time, each L1 frame is associated with an<br>
Absolute L1 Frame Number (ALFN). This universal frame numbering scheme assumes that<br>
the start of ALFN 0 occurred at 00:00:00 Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) on January 6,<br>
1980. The start of every subsequent L1 frame occurs at an exact integer multiple of Tf after<br>
that instant in time. The current ALFN can be a binary number determined by subtracting<br>
the GPS start time (00:00:00 on January 6, 1980) from the current GPS time (making<br>
allowance for the GPS epoch), expressing the difference in seconds, and multiplying the<br>
result by the frame rate, Rf. A new GPS epoch starts every 1024 weeks. The second epoch<br>
began at midnight between August 21 and August 22,1999.<br>
[0121] The ALFN, which is passed to Layer 2 via the SCCH at the rate Rf, is used to<br>
schedule the delivery of time-critical programming. It is not broadcast as part of the<br>
transmitted signal.<br>
[0122] Each L1 frame may be considered to include sixteen L1 blocks of duration Tb.<br>
The L1 Block Count (BC) indicates the position of the current L1 block within the L1<br>
frame. An L1 block count of 0 signifies the start of an L1 frame, while a BC of 15<br>
designates the final L1 block in an L1 frame.<br>
[0123] The BC is passed to Layer 2 via the SCCH at the rate Rb. It is broadcast on the<br>
reference subcarriers and is used by the receiver to aid in synchronization.<br>
[0124] An illustration of the relationship of L1 blocks to L1 frames is shown in FIG. 11.<br>
The primary sidebands and secondary sidebands are independently scaled in amplitude. The <br>
primary sideband scale factors, ao and a1, are fixed scale factors determined by the choice of <br>
service mode. One of four amplitude scale factors, a2 through a5, is selected by a<br>
broadcaster for application to all of the secondary sidebands. The secondary sideband <br>
amplitude scale factor selection (ASP) is received from L2 via the SCCH. When<br>
transmitting the Hybrid or Extended Hybrid waveform, this field is ignored. When<br>
transmitting the All Digital waveform, changes to ASF can be effected seamlessly at an L1<br>
frame boundary without discontinuity or disruption in Layer 1 service.<br>
[0125] The primary system control data sequence contains three bits designated reserved<br>
and the secondary system control data sequence contains six bits designated reserved.<br>
These bits are controlled by layers above L1 via the primary reserved control data interface<br>
and the secondary reserved control data interface.<br>
[0126] A logical channel is a signal path that conducts L1 SDUs through Layer 1 with a<br>
specified grade of service. The primary logical channels are P1, P2, P3, and PIDS. The<br>
secondary logical channels are S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and SIDS. Logical channels are defined<br>
by their characterization parameters and configured by the service mode.<br>
[0127] For a given service mode, the grade of service of a particular logical channel may<br>
be uniquely quantified using three characterization parameters: transfer, latency, and<br>
robustness. Channel code rate, interleaver depth, diversity delay, and spectral mapping are<br>
the determinants of the characterization parameters.<br>
[0128] Transfer defines the throughput of a logical channel. The block-oriented<br>
operations of Layer 1 (such as interleaving) require that it process data in discrete transfer<br>
frames, rather than continuous streams. As a result, throughput is defined in terms of<br>
transfer frame size (in bits) and transfer frame rate (in Hz, or the number of transfer frames<br>
per second). This Layer 1 framing effectively defines the alignment of L1 SDUs.<br>
[0129] Each transfer frame is uniquely identified by its transfer frame number Fnm1:m2,<br>
where n is the ALFN with which the transfer frame is associated, and ml:m2 is the BC<br>
range that is spanned by the transfer frame within L1 frame n. Thus, the BC range indicates<br>
the position of the transfer frame within the L1 frame. The transfer frame number is not<br>
broadcast as part of the transmitted HD Radio signal.<br>
[0130] All transfer frames are conducted through Layer 1 at one of three rates:<br><br>
The ratio of the transfer frame rate to the L1 frame rate is termed the transfer frame<br>
modulus. For a transfer frame modulus of 1, the BC range is always 0:15. For a transfer<br>
frame modulus of 16, the BC range is always a single integer between 0 and 15. Signal<br>
transfer between Layer 2 and Layer 1 is illustrated in FIG. 11. The transfer frame rate<br>
relationships are illustrated in FIG. 12.<br>
[0131] FIG. 13 illustrates an undivided transfer frame 180, a transfer frame 182 divided<br>
into block pairs, and a transfer frame 184 divided into blocks.<br>
[0132] Spectral mapping and channel code rate determine the transfer of a logical<br>
channel, since spectral mapping limits capacity and coding overhead limits information<br>
throughput. Interleaver depth is also a factor, because transfer frames are normally<br>
conducted through Layer 1 at rates corresponding to the interleaver depth of their logical<br>
channel.<br>
[0133] Latency is the delay that a logical channel imposes on a transfer frame as it<br>
traverses Layer 1. The latency of a logical channel is defined as the sum of its interleaver<br>
depth and diversity delay. It does not include processing delays in Layer 1, nor does it<br>
include delays imposed in upper layers.<br>
[0134] The interleaver depth determines the amount of delay imposed on a logical channel by an interleaver. One embodiment of the system employs three interleaver depths:<br>
L1 block, L1 block pair, and L1 frame. Diversity delay is also employed on some logical<br>
channels.<br>
[0135] Higher layers assign information to logical channels with the requisite latency<br>
through service mode selection. Six latencies are specified for the system.<br>
[0136] Robustness is the ability of a logical channel to withstand channel impairments<br>
such as noise, interference, and fading. There are eleven relative levels of robustness in<br>
Layer 1 of the FM air interface. A robustness of 1 indicates a very high level of resistance<br>
to channel impairments, while a robustness of 11 indicates a lower tolerance for channel-<br>
induced errors. As with latency, Layer 2 must determine the required robustness of a logical<br>
channel before selecting a service mode.<br>
[0137] Spectral mapping, channel code rate, interleaver depth, and diversity delay<br>
determine the robustness of a logical channel. Spectral mapping affects robustness by<br>
setting the relative power level, spectral interference protection, and frequency diversity of a<br>
logical channel. Channel coding increases robustness by introducing redundancy into the<br>
logical channel. Interleaver depth influences performance in multipath fading, thereby<br>
affecting the robustness of the logical channel. Finally, some logical channels in certain<br>
service modes delay transfer frames by a fixed duration to realize time diversity. This<br>
diversity delay also affects robustness, since it mitigates the effects of the mobile radio<br>
channel.<br>
[0138] Information throughput of a logical channel at the L1 SAP can be calculated<br>
using these tables and the following formula:<br>
throughput (bits / sec) = transfer frame size (bits) • transfer frame rate (Hz)<br>
[0139] For a given service mode, each logical channel is applied to a group of OFDM<br>
subcarriers or frequency partitions, as illustrated in FIGs. 14-17. In these figures, the<br>
annotated frequencies represent offsets from the channel center frequency.<br>
[0140] The logical channels share a common, absolute time reference, so that all transfer<br>
frames are precisely aligned as they enter the L1 SAP. Each transfer frame is assigned a<br>
unique transfer frame number Fnm1:m2, where n is the ALFN, and m1:m2 is the BC range that<br>
designates the position of the transfer frame within the indexed L1 frame. This numbering<br>
scheme allows-all transfer frames to be referenced to an absolute transmission time.<br>
[0141] FIG. 18 through FIG. 20 show the timing and alignment of all transfer frames<br>
received at the L1 SAP for each service mode. The diagrams illustrate that, depending on<br>
the service mode, logical channels carry information in transfer frames of varying duration:<br>
L1 frame (Tf), L1 block-pair (Tp), or L1 block (Tb). Each diagram spans several L1 frames,<br>
around an arbitrary L1 frame boundary at ALFN n. At each L1 frame boundary, the transfer<br>
frames are precisely aligned. The Layer 1 service access point (SAP) is a parameterized<br>
conceptual interface between Layer 2 and Layer 1 that is common to both the AM and FM<br>
systems. It serves to aid the understanding of the structure of the protocol stack. It does not<br>
imply a specific implementation, but rather provides a formal definition of the services that<br>
flow between Layer 1 and Layer 2, and their use.<br>
[0142] The SAP is described using primitives. Each primitive describes the exchange<br>
of a particular type of information (control and/or user content) with a specific L1 Logical<br>
Channel or with L1 itself. L2 user content, to be delivered unaltered to the receiver entity, is<br>
called a service data unit or SDU. SDUs are requested by L1 using an IND (Indication)<br>
primitive asserted by L1. L2 responds with a RESP (Response) primitive carrying the data requested. Other exchanges between Layer 1 and Layer 2 are control information, and may<br>
or may not be transmitted as part of the waveform.<br>
[0143] The bits in each logical channel are scrambled to randomize the time-domain<br>
data and aid in receiver synchronization. As shown in FIG. 18, there are ten parallel<br>
scramblers, one for each logical channel.<br>
[0144] The inputs to the scramblers are the active logical channels from the L1 SAP, as<br>
selected by the service mode. These inputs are delivered in discrete transfer frames. The<br>
outputs of the scramblers are transfer frames of scrambled bits for each of the active logical<br>
channels. These transfer frames are passed to the channel encoding process for forward<br>
error correction.<br>
[0145] All parallel scramblers are identical, but operate at different rates, depending on<br>
the active service mode. A schematic diagram of the scrambler is shown in FIG. 19. Each<br>
scrambler generates a maximal-length scrambling sequence using a linear feedback shift<br>
register 190 with primitive polynomial P(x) = l(Bx2 @x". A given bit of a scrambled<br>
transfer frame is generated by modulo-2 adding the associated input bit with the<br>
corresponding bit of the scrambling sequence.<br>
[0146] The first bit of a scrambled transfer frame is generated by modulo-2 adding the<br>
first bit of the input transfer frame with the scrambling bit generated when the shift register<br>
is set to the initial state. The process then continues until the last bit of the input transfer<br>
frame is scrambled.<br>
[0147] Channel encoding improves system performance by increasing the robustness of<br>
the signal in the presence of channel impairments. As shown in FIG. 20, the channel<br>
encoding process is characterized by two main operations: time delay 200 (for diversity<br>
delay and transmit alignment) and convolutional encoding 202.<br>
[0148] The inputs to the channel encoding process are transfer frames of scrambled bits<br>
carried through the active logical channels. The outputs of the channel encoding process are<br>
transfer frames of encoded bits associated with each of the active logical channels. The<br>
output transfer frames are passed to the interleaving function.<br>
[0149] In the ensuing sections, for notational convenience, the logical channel vectors at<br>
a particular stage of processing are represented in shorthand notation by their subscript.<br>
[0150] Depending on the service mode, logical channels P1 and S1 may be split into<br>
two channels and delayed as they enter the channel encoding process. The delay provides <br>
time, diversity to the affected logical channels. If applied, the value of the diversity delay is<br>
fixed at NddTf, where Ndd is the number of transfer frames and Tf is the duration of a<br>
transfer frame. An additional delay called Transmit Alignment is imposed on the diversity<br>
delayed signals to ensure that the delayed channels (P1' and S11) are precisely positioned in<br>
time relative to the un-delayed channels (P1 and S1) with the same content to accommodate<br>
diversity combining in the receiver.<br>
[0151] Convolutional encoding includes three primary operations: mother code<br>
generation, puncturing, and parallel-to-serial conversion. Each of these operations is<br>
described below.<br>
[0152] A convolutional encoder employs select generator polynomials to form a group<br>
of mother codes. A rate — convolutional encoder outputs n encoded bits gh,1 for every input<br>
bit Si, i = 0,1,K , N -1 in S, creating a codeword matrix G of dimension nxN:<br>
where N is the length of S, and h = 1,2,K , n indexes the codeword bits for a given input bit.<br>
In the FM system, n = 3 or 4. Each column of G represents the encoded output for a given<br>
input bit.<br>
[0153] Some service modes require puncturing of a mother codeword to produce a<br>
slightly higher code rate, thereby allowing a higher information rate through the same<br>
physical bandwidth. The codeword matrix G is punctured over a puncture period P. For<br>
every P encoded bits, certain bits ghi are not transmitted. A puncture matrix spanning the<br>
encoded bits over a puncture period defines which encoded bits are transmitted. Repeating<br>
the puncture matrix over all encoded bits of a transfer frame forms the puncture pattern.<br>
[0154] After the mother code bits are appropriately punctured, the parallel-to-serial<br>
converter multiplexes them by concatenating the columns of £ into a single vector G as<br>
follows:<br>
Another serial encoded bit sequence can be:<br>
[0155] The last 6 bits of a given transfer frame are used to initialize the delay'elements<br>
of the corresponding convolutional encoder for that transfer frame. The use of transfer<br>
frames that define the encoding blocks is important in maintaining alignment between<br>
different logical channels.<br>
[0156] The channel encoding process for each logical channel in each service mode is<br>
specified below. In Service Mode MP1 only P1 and PIDS logical channels are active. Only<br>
P1, P3, and PIDS logical channels are active in service modes MP2, MP3, and MP4.<br>
[0157] Only P1, P2, P3, and PIDS logical channels are active in service mode MP5.<br>
Only P1, P2, and PIDS logical channels are active in service mode MP6. Only P1, P2, P3,<br>
and PIDS logical channels are active in service mode MP7. Only S4, S5, and SIDS logical<br>
channels are active in service mode MS1. Only S1, S2, S3, S5, and SIDS logical channels<br>
are active in service mode MS2. Only S1, S2, S5, and SIDS logical channels are active in<br>
service mode MS3. Only S1, S2, S3, S5, and SIDS logical channels are active in service<br>
mode MS4.<br>
[0158] Interleaving is comprised of six parallel interleaving processes (IPs): PM, PX,<br>
SM, SX, SP, and SB, shown in FIG. 21. An IP contains one or more interleaves, and, in<br>
some cases, a transfer frame multiplexer. The interleaving process (IP) is a series of<br>
manipulations performed on one or more coded transfer frames (vectors) to reorder their bits<br>
into one or more interleaver matrices whose contents are destined for a particular portion of<br>
the transmitted spectrum.<br>
[0159] The service mode determines which inputs and IPs are active at any given time.<br>
In addition, for those service modes where the P3 logical channel is active, the P3IS control<br>
bit obtained from L2 determines whether a long or short interleaver is employed. The<br>
universe of inputs for interleaving are the channel-encoded transfer frames from the primary<br>
logical channels P1 through P3 and PIDS, and the secondary logical channels S1 through S5<br>
and SIDS.<br>
[0160] Interleaver matrices of bits from all active parallel IPs are transferred to OFDM<br>
Subcarrier Mapping, which maps a row of bits from each interleaver matrix to its respective<br>
upper and lower sidebands.<br>
[0161] An interleaver is a function that takes a vector of bits as its input, and outputs a<br>
matrix of reordered bits. The reordering of bits before transmission mitigates the impact of<br>
burst errors caused by signal fades and interference.<br>
[0162] The interleaver function uses a two-dimensional matrix to reorder a vector of<br>
channel-encoded bits. The interleaver allows individual encoded bits or groups of encoded<br>
bits to be directed to a specific interleaver partition within the interleaver matrix. An<br>
interleaver partition can be viewed as a smaller independent interleaver.<br>
[0163] FIG. 22 shows an interleaver matrix used by the PM IP. This interleaver matrix<br>
contains 20 interleaver partitions. In general, the interleaver matrix is divided into.J<br>
interleaver partitions. Each interleaver partition is divided into B interleaver blocks. An<br>
interleaver block spans 32 rows and C columns. Thus the dimensions for each interleaver<br>
partition in a given interleaver matrix are (B -32)xC . For a given interleaver within an IP,<br>
the interleaver matrix size can vary with service mode. An interleaver partition is a logical<br>
subdivision of the overall interleaver matrix. Each interleaver partition contains C columns<br>
(C= 24 or 36) and 32.B rows where B is the number of interleaver blocks.<br>
[0164] The input to each interleaver is a vector of channel encoded bits indexed from i =<br>
0, 1,..., N-l. The output of each interleaver is a (B • 32)x (J • C) matrix of bits destined for<br>
OFDM Subcarrier Mapping.<br>
[0165] The mapping of each encoded bit to a location in the interleaver matrix is<br>
calculated using a set of equations. In one embodiment of a digital broadcasting system that<br>
can include this invention, there are four types of interleaves that are used to process<br>
signals in the various channels.<br>
[0166] This invention relates to a convolutional interleaver that provides one of the<br>
interleaver functions in the DAB system. The interleaver equation set for the convolutional<br>
interleaver is set forth below. Table 3 identifies the various parameters of the convolutional<br>
interleaver equations.<br>
[0167] With a convolutional interleaver, each write to the interleaver matrix must be<br>
followed by a read from the interleaver matrix. Since the total number of bits being .<br>
interleaved is greater than the transfer frame size, an additional matrix is needed to manage<br>
this flow. Thus, the terminology associated with the convolutional interleaver is as follows:<br>
? Internal interleaver matrix - The interleaver matrix of dimension (B . 32)x (J • C) to<br>
which bits are written using the interleaver equation set, and from which bits are<br>
read sequentially across rows. It may take multiple transfer frames to fill this matrix.<br>
It is full after N bits have been processed.<br>
? Output interleaver matrix - A matrix of dimension<br>
containing b<br>
interleaved bits read from the internal interleaver matrix. The number of bits in this<br>
matrix is equal to the size of the input transfer frame or parameter b. Bits are written<br>
to this matrix sequentially across rows starting at row 0, column 0. Note that the<br>
number of transfer frames per interleaver matrix equals N/b.<br>
[0168] For a given convolutional interleaver, the steps needed to process each encoded<br>
bit of an input sequence of length N are as follows:<br>
1. Assign values to parameters J, B, C, M, v, b, and N using Tables 4 and 5 set<br>
forth below.<br>
2. Initialize the partition assignment counter vector, pt, to all zeros. The length<br>
of this vector equals J.<br>
3. For each i = O to N-l,<br>
? Write a bit to the internal interleaver matrix using a calculated bit<br>
address based on the equations set forth below. Calculate<br>
partition!, fetch pt [partitioni], and calculate blocki, row, and<br>
column,. Write the ith input bit to this location in the internal<br>
interleaver matrix.<br>
? Read a bit from the following row and column of the internal<br>
interleaver matrix:<br>
readRow = INT(i MOD C)<br>
readColumm = i MOD C<br>
? Write the bit read from the internal interleaver matrix to the<br>
following row and column of the output interleaver matrix:<br>
writeRow = INT((i MOD b)MOD C)<br>
writeColumn = (i MOD b)MOD C<br>
? Increment pt [partitioni].<br>
[0169] The interleaver equations are set forth below. The interleaver of this invention<br>
can be used by the PX IP when P3IS = 1 to interleave P3g transfer frames. To implement<br>
the invention, first define a supporting parameter which represents the number of bits in an<br>
interleaver block:<br>
Bk_bits = 32. C<br>
[0170] Then define a second supporting parameter:<br>
Bk_adj = 32-C-l<br>
[0171] An index into v can be computed to retrieve the interleaver partition assignment<br>
using:<br>
[0172] A vector of partition assignment counters, pt, can be assigned with each counter<br>
having a length equal to the number of partitions. The appropriate counter for partition, is<br>
then:<br>
The partition assignment counter for a given partition is incremented each time an allocation<br>
is made to that partition. The initial value of each of the partition assignment counters is set<br>
to O.<br>
[0173] Using the applicable parameters, a Block Assignment within the Interleaver<br>
Partition is determined by applying the following equation:<br>
[0174] The Row Assignment within the interleaver block is determined by using the<br>
applicable parameters, apply the following equation:<br>
[0175] The Column Assignment within the interleaver block is determined using the<br>
applicable parameters, apply the following equation:<br>
[0176] The Primary Main Interleaving Process (IP) interleaves the bits mapped to the<br>
Primary Main sidebands depicted in FIG. 2 through FIG. 4. This IP is active in all primary<br>
service modes (MP1 through MP7). The PM IP disperses multiple logical channels into a<br>
single interleaver matrix, PM-<br>
[0177] The interleaving process must maintain a specific transfer frame alignment and<br>
synchronization at its output. For a given logical channel, the BC range ml:m2 indicates<br>
which L1 blocks are spanned by the designated transfer frame. The ALFN n is the absolute<br>
L1 frame number.<br>
[0178] FIG. 23 shows the PX IP for service modes MP2 through MP4 when P3IS=1. In<br>
these service modes, the PX IP interleaves P3G transfer frames into an internal interleaver<br>
matrix and outputs them to PX1 (the output interleaver matrix) using the Interleaver of this<br>
invention. The service mode dependent interleaver parameter values are shown in Tables 4<br>
and 5. Although the transfer frame rate is common, the size of the P3g transfer frames<br>
varies with service mode. Consequently, the number of interleaver partitions in the PX1<br>
interleaver matrix also varies.<br>
[0179] Although the size of the internal interleaver matrix is 16 P3g transfer frames, the<br>
interleaver is described as processing one P3g transfer frame at a time. Every time a bit is<br>
written to the internal interleaver matrix used by the interleaver, a bit is read sequentially<br>
from this matrix and output sequentially to PX1. The size of PX1 is equal to the length of<br>
one P3g transfer frame for consistency with the P3IS=0 case. Thus for every P3g txansfer<br>
frame processed by the interleaver, the PX1 output matrix is completely filled. Describing<br>
the process in this manner makes the subcarrier mapping procedures described below<br>
completely transparent to the state of P3IS. After the interleaver has consumed 16 P3g<br>
transfer frames and 16 PX1 matrices have been filled and output, the internal interleaver<br>
matrix is completely filled, and the processing flow resets.<br>
[0180] In practical applications, because the interleaver is convolutional, the number of<br>
bits input to and output from the interleaver can be any length less than or equal to N, the<br>
capacity of the internal interleaver matrix. The concept of an internal interleaver matrix is<br>
described here for notational convenience.<br>
[0181] Under the direction of the upper layers, System Control Processing assembles<br>
and differentially encodes a sequence of bits (system control data sequence) destined for<br>
each reference subcarrier. There are up to 61 reference subcarriers, numbered 0 ... 60,<br>
distributed throughout the OFDM spectrum. The number of reference subcarriers broadcast<br>
in a given waveform depends on the service mode. However, System Control Processing<br>
always outputs all 61 system control data sequences, regardless of service mode.<br>
[0182] The bits in each column of the 32 x 61 matrix r, assembled by the System<br>
Control Data Sequence Assembler, are differentially encoded in accordance with FIG. 24,<br>
and are output to the matrix R in the same order. Conceptually, this process can be viewed<br>
as 61 parallel differential encoders. For an individual differential encoder, the bits of a<br>
single column j of r are processed sequentially, from i = 0 ... 31. One system control data<br>
sequence bit is input to a differential encoder at a time. This input bit is modulo-2 added<br>
with the previously stored output bit R[i-l][j] to form the latest output bit, R[i-1][j]. The<br>
resulting output bit stream will reverse polarity each time the input bit is a 1. The initial<br>
state of each differential encoder is 0.<br>
[0183] OFDM Subcarrier Mapping assigns interleaver partitions to frequency partitions.<br>
For each active interleaver matrix, OFDM Subcarrier Mapping assigns a row of bits from<br>
each interleaver partition to its respective frequency partition in the complex output vector<br>
X. In addition, system control data sequence bits from a row of R. are mapped to the active<br>
reference subcarrier locations in X. The service mode dictates which interleaver matrices<br>
and which elements of R are active. FIG. 25 shows the inputs, output, and component<br>
functions of OFDM Subcarrier Mapping.<br>
[0184] The inputs to OFDM Subcarrier Mapping are a row of bits from each active<br>
interleaver matrix and a row of bits from R, the matrix of system control data sequences.<br>
[0185] The output from OFDM Subcarrier Mapping for each OFDM symbol is a single<br>
complex vector, X, of length 1093. The vector is indexed from k =0,1,2,...,1092. The kth<br>
element of X corresponds to subcarrier (k-546).<br>
Active elements in a row of R and the associated row from each active interleaver matrix are<br>
assigned to the same instance of X.<br>
[0186] The Signal Constellation Mapper translates pairs of bits read from interleaver<br>
partitions and individual bits read from R to complex constellation values. The Sealer<br>
function applies the appropriate amplitude gain factor to these complex values. The gain<br>
factor is determined by the desired signal level. The OFDM Subcarrier Mapper maps the<br>
scaled complex constellation values to the appropriate elements of the output vector X.<br>
Elements of X corresponding to unused subcarriers are set to the complex value0 + j0.<br>
[0187] For each active interleaver matrix, a row of bits is processed every Ts. Rows are<br>
processed sequentially, starting with the first row (row 0). When all rows of an interleaver<br>
matrix have been processed, the next instance of that interleaver matrix is processed,<br>
starting with the first row.<br>
[0188] For a given row of an interleaver matrix, bits are processed by interleaver<br>
partition. Pairs of adjacent columns within an interleaver partition are mapped to individual<br>
complex, quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK)-modulated data subcarriers within a<br>
frequency partition. This mapping proceeds sequentially. The first two columns (0 and 1)<br>
of an interleaver partition are mapped to the starting subcarrier number of a frequency<br>
partition, and the last two columns of an interleaver partition are mapped to the ending<br>
subcarrier number of a frequency partition.<br>
[01891 To map each adjacent column pair within an interleaver partition to a subcarrier<br>
location within the vector X, the following steps are taken:<br>
1. Read a pair of bits from adjacent columns within an interleaver partition. For a given column pair, the bit read from the lower indexed column is mapped<br>
as an I bit, and the bit read from the higher indexed column is mapped as a Q<br>
bit.<br>
2. Map the bit pair from Step 1 to a complex constellation value. The I bit<br>
maps to the real component and the Q bit maps to the imaginary component<br>
of the constellation value.<br>
3. Scale the I and Q components of the complex constellation value from Step 2<br>
using an appropriate amplitude scale factor. The amplitude scale factor is<br>
chosen based on subcarrier location and, for the secondary sidebands, the<br>
value of ASF.<br>
4. Map the scaled constellation value from Step 3 to the appropriate element of<br>
X.<br>
[0190] Reference subcarrier matrix R is read one row at a time and a row of R is<br>
processed every Ts. Each row of R is a vector of bits of length 61, indexed from 0 to 60.<br>
Selected bits of this vector are mapped to reference subcarriers according to service mode.<br>
[0191] Since the output vector X contains complex values, the following steps are taken<br>
to map a row of R to an element of X:<br>
1. Read a bit value from a row vector of R.<br>
2. Map the bit to a complex, binary phase shift keying (BPSK)-modulated<br>
constellation value.<br>
3. Scale the I and Q components of the complex constellation value using the<br>
appropriate amplitude scale factor and, for secondary subcarriers, according<br>
to the state of ASF.<br>
4. Map the scaled constellation value to the appropriate element of X for the<br>
current service mode.<br>
[0192] OFDM Signal Generation receives complex, frequency-domain OFDM symbols<br>
from OFDM Subcarrier Mapping, and outputs time-domain pulses representing the digital<br>
portion of the FM signal. A conceptual block diagram of OFDM Signal Generation is<br>
shown in FIG. 26.<br>
[0193] The input to OFDM Signal Generation is a complex vector Xn of length L,<br>
representing the complex constellation values for each OFDM subcarrier in OFDM symbol<br>
n. For notational convenience, the output of OFDM Subcarrier Mapping described above<br>
did not use the subscript n. Rather, it referred to the vector X as representing a single<br>
OFDM symbol. In the following description, the subscript is appended to X because of the<br>
significance of n to OFDM Signal Generation.<br>
[0194] The output of OFDM Signal Generation is a complex, baseband, time-domain<br>
pulse yn(t), representing the digital position of the FM HD Radio signal for OFDM symbol n.<br>
Let Xn[k] be the scaled constellation points from OFDM Subcarrier Mapping for the nth<br>
symbol, where k = 0, 1, .... L-l indexes the OFDM subcarriers. Let yn(t) denote the time-<br>
domain output of OFDM Signal Generation for the nth symbol. Then yn(t) is written in<br>
terms of Xn[k] as follows:<br>
is the total number of OFDM subcarriers, and Ts<br>
and Af are the OFDM symbol duration and OFDM subcarrier spacing, respectively.<br>
[0195] The pulse-shaping function h(£) is defined as:<br>
where a is the cyclic prefix width, and T = — is the reciprocal of the OFDM subcarrier<br>
spacing.<br>
[0196] The Transmission Subsystem formats the baseband FM waveform for<br>
transmission through the VHF channel. Functions include symbol concatenation and<br>
frequency up-conversion. In addition, when transmitting the Hybrid or Extended Hybrid<br>
waveforms, this function modulates the baseband analog signal before combining it with the<br>
digital waveform.<br>
[0197] The input to this module is a complex, baseband, time-domain OFDM symbol,<br>
yn(t), from the OFDM Signal Generation function. A baseband analog signal m(t) is also<br>
input from an analog source, along with optional subsidiary communications authorization<br>
(SCA) signals, when transmitting the Hybrid or Extended Hybrid waveform. The output of,<br>
this module is the VHF FM waveform.<br>
[0198] Refer to FIG. 27 for a functional block diagram of the All Digital Transmission<br>
Subsystem, and FIG. 28 for a functional block diagram of the Hybrid and Extended Hybrid<br>
transmission subsystems.<br>
[0199] When broadcasting the Hybrid or Extended Hybrid waveform, the analog-<br>
modulated FM RF signal is combined with the digitally-modulated RF signal to produce the<br>
VHF FM waveform, s(t). When broadcasting service modes MP1 - MP4 the upper layers<br>
establish precise timing relationship between the analog and digital signals. In this case,<br>
service mode changes to any other Hybrid or Extended Hybrid waveform shall not cause any<br>
interruptions or discontinuities in the analog signal. In service modes MP5 - MP7, no<br>
precise timing relationship is required. Both the analog and digital portions of the<br>
waveform are centered on the same carrier frequency.<br>
[0200] This invention provides a method for interleaving bits of a digital signal<br>
representative of data and/or audio in a digital audio broadcasting system, the method<br>
comprising the step of: writing a plurality of bits of the digital signal to a matrix; and reading<br>
the bits from the matrix, wherein at least one of the writing and reading steps follows a non <br>
sequential addressing scheme. "Non-sequential addressing scheme" means allocating matrix<br>
addresses by one or more patterns and/or formulas, wherein the addresses are not in<br>
contiguous order. A set of such formulas is described above.<br>
[0201] The number of bits in the matrix can be equal to the number of bits in a transfer<br>
frame of the digital signal. The bits in the matrix are arranged in a plurality of partitions, and<br>
each of the partitions can include a plurality of blocks.<br>
[0202] Each of the partitions can include a group of the bits representative of a logical<br>
channel, and the bits of the logical channels can be scrambled.<br>
[0203] The invention also encompasses a method of broadcasting digital information<br>
representative of data and/or audio in a digital audio broadcasting system, the method<br>
comprising the steps of: receiving a plurality of bits of a digital signal to be transmitted;<br>
writing the bits to a matrix; reading the bits from the matrix, wherein at least one of the writing<br>
