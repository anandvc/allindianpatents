				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a plasma reaction apparatus and a plasma reaction method<br>
using the same, and more particularly, to a plasma reaction apparatus which generates<br>
rotating arc plasma and which is applied to the reforming of fuel and the chemical<br>
treatment of persistent gas, using the rotating arc plasma, and a plasma reaction method<br>
using the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
In general, states of matters are divided into three states, i.e., a solid, a liquefied<br>
and a gas. When energy is applied to a solid, the sold becomes a liquefied, and when the<br>
energy is further applied to the liquefied, the liquefied becomes a gas. When the higher<br>
energy is applied to the gas, there is generated plasma in a fourth state of matter which<br>
consists of electrons and ions having electric polarity. In nature, plasma is observed in<br>
the form of lightening, an aurora, and an ion layer in the air. In daily life, artificially<br>
produced plasma is included in a fluorescent lamp, a mercury lamp and a neon sign.<br>
When a gas with high kinetic energy is collided at ultra high temperature,<br>
electrons with negative electric charges are dissociated from atoms or molecules, thereby<br>
making the plasma. The plasma means the gaseous state which is divided into the<br>
electrons with negative electric charges and the ions with positive electric charges.<br>
Plasma has the degree of ionization of the electric charges which is significantly high.<br>
Plasma generally contains the negative electric charges and the positive electric charges in<br>
about equal numbers, so that the electric charges are distributed in about equal density.<br>
Therefore, plasma is almost in an electrically neutral state.<br><br>
The plasma is classified as high temperature plasma and low temperature plasma.<br>
The high temperature plasma has high temperature like an arc. The low temperature<br>
plasma has nearly normally room temperature because the energy of the ions is low<br>
whereas the energy of the electrons is high. The plasma is generated by applying the<br>
electrical methods, such as direct current, super-high frequency and electron beam, and is<br>
maintained by using the magnetic field.<br>
A plasma generating technique and plasma practical use considerably vary<br>
depending on the pressure condition at which the plasma is generated. Since the plasma<br>
is stably generated on the vacuum condition with low pressure, the plasma generated in<br>
this manner is used for chemical reaction, deposition and corrosion in a semiconductor<br>
device fabrication process and a new material composition process. The plasma<br>
generated on the air pressure condition is used for processing a harmful gas to<br>
environment or manufacturing a new matter.<br>
A plasma reaction apparatus for using the plasma needs to have the operability to<br>
start a reaction promptly, the high durability, and the efficiency on reaction. Upon the<br>
plasma reaction, the forms of an electrode and a furnace and the conditions for reaction<br>
(for example, a voltage and an additive) are decisive factors for the plasma reaction.<br>
Accordingly, a desirable constitution of the plasma reaction apparatus needs to be<br>
presented to correspond with the required performance, and a technique of a plasma<br>
reaction method needs to be presented for the optimization of the reaction conditions.<br><br>
Disclosure<br>
Technical Problem<br>
Technical Solution<br>
The present invention provides a plasma reaction apparatus which enables a raw material<br>
to be sufficiently reacted within a plasma reaction space having a restrictive volume and<br>
enables a high plasma reaction to be faster performed, and a plasma reaction method using<br>
the same, and various plasma apparatuses relating to the plasma reaction apparatus and the<br>
plasma reaction method using the same, in which a plasma reaction zone is expanded to<br>
temporarily stay before it is discharged, thereby excluding the discontinuity of the plasma<br>
reaction zone.<br>
The present invention also provides, as an application field, a plasma reaction method of a<br>
persistent gas, which effectively resolves a persistent gas by maintaining a plasma region,<br>
which is formed inside a furnace, at higher temperature, increasing an average collision<br>
path of electrons, and generating radicals and ions with high reactivity.<br>
The present invention also provides, as another application field, a plasma reactor which<br>
independently supplies a reducing ambient gas of high temperature, which does not<br>
interfere an operation of an engine, and which promptly supplies the ambient gas by a<br>
prompt reaction which is the characteristic of a plasma reforming reaction when needed,<br>
and an apparatus for decreasing NOx by an occlusion catalyst, using the plasma reactor.<br>
The present invention also provides a plasma reactor which realizes the simplification of<br>
the constitution by receiving fuel from a storage for supplying the fuel to an engine so that<br>
is realized and which insignificantly improves the reforming performance of the fuel by<br><br>
effectively mixing the liquefied fuel and gas being supplied to the plasma reactor, and an<br>
apparatus for decreasing NOx by an occlusion catalyst, using the same.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
As described above, when persistent gas, hydrocarbon fuel and an oxidizer as<br>
partial oxidation conditions are flowed into the inside of a furnace and a plasma region is<br>
maintained at higher temperature by heat generated by the oxidation reaction of the fuel,<br>
an average collision path of electrons is increased and radicals and ions with high<br>
reactivity in the oxidation reaction are generated, thereby effectively resolving the<br>
persistent gas.<br>
Furthermore, a plasma reaction zone generated upon a plasma reaction is stayed<br>
by an expansion section formed in a furnace and by a tip part formed upon the expansion,<br>
thereby realizing a continuous plasma reaction.<br>
Furthermore, a raw material is flowed into an intake hole having a swirl structure<br>
and the raw material progresses in a rotating flow, thereby enabling the raw material to be<br>
sufficiently reacted in a plasma reaction space with a restrictive volume and enabling a<br>
faster high temperature plasma reaction to be formed.<br>
Furthermore, prior to discharge, a plasma reaction zone is expanded through a<br>
broad area chamber formed as an upper width of a furnace is expanded, and the plasma<br>
reaction zone is temporarily stayed, thereby removing discontinuity of the plasma reaction<br>
zone.<br><br>
Consequently, the above-described effects achieve the objects of the present<br>
invention to improve the reaction efficiency upon the reforming reaction of raw materials<br>
being supplied or upon the process of harmful matters and to enhance the reliability of<br>
resultant products and to be advantageous to environment.<br>

Best Mode<br>
Mode for Invention<br>
The present invention will now be described more fully and clearly hereinafter with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention<br>
are shown.<br>
FIG. 1 is a vertical sectional view illustrating a plasma reaction apparatus according to a<br>
first embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 2 is a vertical sectional view illustrating a<br>
plasma reaction zone which is expanded by the plasma reaction apparatus of FIG. 1, and<br>
FIG. 3 is a cross sectional view illustrating a structure in which a raw material inflow pipe<br>
is operatively connected to a furnace in the plasma reaction apparatus of FIG. 1.<br><br>
A plasma reaction apparatus comprises: a furnace, a raw material inflow pipe, and an<br>
electrode. The furnace is hollow and includes a discharge opening, formed at an upper<br>
part of the furnace, for discharging a plasma reactant. The raw material inflow pipe for<br>
supplying a raw material for a plasma reaction to the inside of the furnace is operatively<br>
connected to a lower part of the furnace, and an intake opening positioned inside the<br>
furnace is formed to be tilted at a predetermined angle to a normal direction of an outer<br>
circumference surface of the furnace, so that the raw material being supplied is progressed<br>
in the form of a rotating flow inside the furnace. The electrode for generating a discharge<br>
voltage for the plasma reaction of the raw material being supplied to the inside of the<br>
furnace is positioned at the bottom of the furnace and is spaced from an inner wall of the<br>
furnace at a predetermined interval. The furnace is characterized in that the width of a<br>
section positioned above the electrode is expanded. Accordingly, when the raw material<br>
being supplied to the inside of the furnace makes the plasma reaction, the furnace expands<br>
a plasma reaction zone, thereby forming a broad chamber to temporarily stay the plasma<br>
reaction zone.<br>
A plasma reaction method using a plasma reaction apparatus, comprises: supplying a raw<br>
material for a plasma reaction to the inside of a furnace by operatively connecting a raw<br>
material inflow pipe to the furnace, wherein the furnace is hollow and includes a discharge<br>
opening, formed at an upper part of the furnace, for discharging a plasma reactant, and the<br>
raw material inflow pipe includes an intake opening positioned inside the furnace which is<br>
formed to be tilted at a predetermined angle to a normal direction of an outer<br>
circumference surface of the furnace, so that the raw material being supplied is progressed<br>
in the form of a rotating flow inside the furnace; allowing the raw material being supplied<br>
to make a plasma reaction by a discharge voltage between an inner wall of the furnace and<br><br>
an electrode, wherein the electrode is positioned at the bottom of the furnace and spaced<br>
from the inner wall of the furnace at a predetermined interval; and forming a broad area<br>
chamber inside the furnace by expanding the width of a section positioned above the<br>
electrode, so that a plasma reaction zone is expanded and temporarily stayed in the broad<br>
area chamber upon the plasma reaction of the raw material being supplied to the inside of<br>
the furnace.<br>
As illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 3, a plasma reaction apparatus 50 comprises a furnace 10,<br>
an electrode 30 and a raw material inflow pipe 20.<br>
The furnace 10 is formed, including a hollow to form a space for a plasma reaction. The<br>
specific structure and shape of the furnace will be described later.<br>
The electrode 30 for generating a discharge voltage for the plasma reaction of a raw<br>
material being supplied to the inside of the furnace 10 is positioned at the bottom of the<br>
furnace 10 and spaced from an inner wall of the furnace 10 at a predetermined interval.<br>
The electrode 30 has the following characteristics in shape.<br>
The electrode 30 includes an upper part in a conical shape and a lower part extended in a<br>
cylindrical shape. Accordingly, in the electrode 30, the width of an about middle part is<br>
relatively expanded compared to the other parts. The extended lower part in the<br>
cylindrical shape of the electrode 30 is relatively narrow in width, compared to the upper<br>
part of the electrode 30. The summit of the conical shape and the portion connecting the<br>
conical shape and the cylindrical shape are curved roundly.<br><br>
According to the characteristic shape of the electrode 30, a reaction chamber 15 is formed<br>
in a section in which the electrode 30 is positioned inside the furnace 10. In the reaction<br>
chamber 15, a plasma reaction is performed by a raw material flowing from a raw material<br>
inflow pipe 20, described later, and a raw material inflow chamber 13 to which the raw<br>
material inflow pipe 20 is operatively connected. That is, the raw material inflow chamber<br>
13 and the reaction chamber 15 are divided by a middle portion (corresponding to a lower<br>
part of the conical shape) in which the width of the electrode 30 is expanded. The raw<br>
material inflow chamber 13 is extendedly formed in a narrow cylindrical shape. Since<br>
the interval between the portion in which the width of the electrode 30 is expanded and the<br>
inner wall of the furnace 10 becomes relatively narrow, the raw material being flowed into<br>
the furnace does not immediately progress to the reaction chamber 15. Rather, after the<br>
raw material is temporarily stayed in the raw material inflow chamber 13 of a relatively<br>
large volume and is sufficiently mixed, the raw material is progressed to the reaction<br>
chamber 15. That is, the above-described shape of the electrode 30 enables the section in<br>
which the electrode 30 is formed inside the furnace 10 to divide the raw material inflow<br>
chamber 13 and the reaction chamber 15, enables the raw material inflow chamber 13 to<br>
have a sufficient volume, and enables the raw material supplied from the raw material<br>
inflow chamber 13 to be restrictively progressed into the reaction chamber 15 so that the<br>
raw material is sufficiently mixed.<br>
The raw material inflow pipe 20 is operatively connected to a lower part of the furnace 10,<br>
to allow the raw material for the plasma reaction to flow into the raw material inflow<br>
chamber 13 inside the furnace 10. The number of the raw material inflow pipes is not<br>
limited. An intake opening (hereinafter, referred to as a inflow hole) positioned in the<br>
furnace connected to the raw material inflow pipe 20 is formed to be tilted to a wall<br>
surface of the furnace 10, that is, the inflow hole 21 has a swirl shape. The inflow hole<br><br>
21 allows the raw material to form a rotating flow and progress in the furnace. This<br>
enables the raw material to form the rotating flow and progress in the reaction chamber 15.<br>
Accordingly, the raw material rotates in a circumference direction and moves upwardly<br>
rather than it directly moves upwardly along a length direction of the furnace 10. The<br>
rotating progress of the raw material enhances the efficiency on the plasma reaction to the<br>
same volume.<br>
According to the first embodiment of the present invention, the structure and shape of the<br>
furnace 10 is desirably presented as follows:<br>
The furnace 10 is formed including a hollow. The appearance of the furnace 10 has<br>
nearly a cylindrical shape. As described above, the lower part of the furnace 10 is<br>
connected to the raw material inflow pipe 20. The upper part of the furnace 10 is opened<br>
to form a discharge opening 11. The discharge opening 11 is formed to discharge a<br>
plasma reactant. The upper part of the furnace 10 is expanded in width, thereby forming<br>
a broad area chamber 17 at the upper part in the furnace 10. The broad area chamber 17<br>
may be positioned above the top tip of the electrode 30. That is, the furnace 10 has the<br>
wider section positioned above the electrode 30. According to the above description, the<br>
raw material inflow chamber 13, the reaction chamber 15 and the broad area chamber 17<br>
are sequentially formed from the lower position to the upper position in the furnace 10.<br>
Since the broad area chamber 17 is expanded than the reaction chamber 15, when the raw<br>
material makes the plasma reaction in the reaction chamber 15, a plasma reaction zone is<br>
expanded through the broad area chamber 17 and is temporarily stayed. Then, the time<br>
for which a plasma reaction product is stayed is increased, thereby making it favorable for<br>
an additional high temperature reaction and resulting in the acting effect of excluding the<br>
discontinuity of plasma formation. The point to divide the broad area chamber 17 and<br><br>
the reaction chamber 15 in the furnace 10, that is, the start point at which the inside of the<br>
furnace 110 is expanded, may be formed in a pointed end 19 rather than a round curve.<br>
For this purpose, the section positioned above the electrode 30 in the furnace 10 is formed<br>
and expanded in a right-angled shape. According to the structure in which the furnace 10<br>
is expanded in the right-angle shape, the horizontal expansion of the plasma reaction zone<br>
in the broad area chamber 17 is increased, and the plasma reaction is continuously<br>
performed since the pointed end 19 with plasma is rotated.<br>
When staying plasma is formed by the broad area chamber 17, rotating plasma is formed<br>
through the pointed end 19 formed between the reaction chamber 15 and the broad area<br>
chamber 17 from the top tip of the electrode 30. The distance from the pointed end 19<br>
formed between the reaction chamber 15 and the broad area chamber 17 to the top tip of<br>
the electrode 30 is a factor to decide a thermal characteristic of the plasma being formed.<br>
An auxiliary raw material inflow pipe 25 for supplying an additional raw material to the<br>
broad area chamber 17 is operatively connected to the furnace 10, thereby enabling an<br>
additional reaction by the added raw material in the broad area chamber 17.<br>
When the diameter of the discharge opening 11 is formed to be smaller than the diameter<br>
of the broad area chamber 17 in the furnace 10, the plasma reactant may more stay or stop<br>
in the broad area chamber 17. In the first embodiment, the upper part of the furnace is<br>
expanded once but it may be expanded in a number of steps and/or in a number of times.<br>
Such modification is within the scope of the present invention.<br>
In the shape of the reactor, when the expanded region is formed, in the form of a step, at<br>
the rear of the reactor, the plasma being formed on conditions does not leave and is<br><br>
attached to the tip of the electrode while it continuously discharges and rotates. On the<br>
conditions that hydrocarbon fuel is partially oxidized, the staying plasma becomes<br>
persistent due to the high temperature and the concentration of a matter with high<br>
reactivity (for example, electrons and ions), thereby improving the performance in<br>
resolving the gas and in reforming the fuel.<br>
FIG. 4 is a vertical sectional view illustrating a plasma reaction apparatus<br>
according to a second embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 5 is a vertical sectional<br>
view illustrating a plasma reaction zone which is stayed by the plasma reaction apparatus<br>
of FIG. 4, and FIG. 6 is a cross sectional view illustrating the plasma reaction apparatus of<br>
FIG 4.<br>
The second embodiment of the present invention will be described, in detail, as<br>
follows:<br>
A plasma reaction method of resolving a persistent gas comprises: flowing a<br>
persistent gas, hydrocarbon fuel and an oxidizer into a furnace through a raw material<br>
inflow pipe operatively connected to the furnace, so that when the persistent gas makes a<br>
plasma reaction by a discharge voltage generated between an electrode installed in the<br>
furnace and an inner wall of the furnace, a plasma region is in a higher temperature state<br>
by heat generated by an oxidation reaction of the fuel and is lower in density; making a<br>
continuous plasma reaction by allowing a plasma reaction zone generated upon the plasma<br>
reaction to stay in an expanded section formed as the width of a section positioned above<br>
the electrode in the furnace is expanded, forming a step at a right angle in a length<br>
direction of the furnace; and forming a number of inflow holes on a wall surface of the<br>
furnace and so as to be tilted at a predetermined angle to a normal direction of the inner<br><br>
wall of the furnace, the inflow holes for operatively connecting the raw material inflow<br>
pipe and the inside of the furnace.<br>
The present invention having the above-described characteristics will be more<br>
clearly described with reference to a preferred embodiment thereof.<br>
Before the preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described, it is<br>
noted that the present invention relates to a method of resolving a persistent gas by a<br>
plasma reaction and the persistent gas may be any one of typical gases causing the global<br>
warming, such as CF4, C2F6, SF6 and NF or a mixture thereof but any other persistent<br>
gases are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
According to the second embodiment of the present invention, the desirable<br>
constitution and structure of a plasma reaction apparatus 50 for a plasma reaction of a<br>
persistent gas is presented.<br>
A raw material inflow pipe 20 for allowing the inflow of a persistent gas,<br>
hydrocarbon fuel and an oxidizer which are subject to a plasma reaction is connected to a<br>
furnace 10 including a hollow. An electrode 30 for generating a discharge voltage for the<br>
plasma reaction between the electrode 30 and the inner wall of the furnace 10 is installed<br>
in the furnace 10.<br><br>
In the structure of operatively connecting the raw material inflow pipe 20 to the<br>
furnace 10, a number of inflow holes 21 are formed on a wall surface of the furnace 10,<br>
for the operative connection between the raw material inflow pipe 20 and the inside of the<br>
furnace 10. The inflow holes 21 are formed to be tilted at a predetermined angle to a<br>
normal direction of the inner wall of the furnace 10. A space 21a in which the gases (the<br>
persistent gas, the fuel and the oxidizer) to flow into the furnace 10 are temporarily stayed<br>
is formed between the inflow holes 21 of the furnace 10 and the raw material inflow pipe<br>
10.<br>
According to the foregoing, the gases flowing through the raw material inflow<br>
pipe 20 temporarily stay in the space 21a and then uniformly spread inside of the furnace<br>
10 through the number of inflow holes 21. As the inflow holes 21 are formed to be tilted,<br>
the gases being flowed into form a rotating flow and progress inside the furnace 10.<br>
As described above, a broad area chamber 17 for staying a plasma reaction zone<br>
generated upon the plasma reaction is formed inside the furnace 10. The broad area<br>
chamber 17 is formed as the width of a section positioned above the electrode 30 is<br>
expanded in the furnace 10.<br>
The section positioned above the electrode 30 in the furnace 10 is expanded<br>
forming a step at a right angle in a length direction of the furnace 10. Accordingly, a<br>
pointed end 19 is formed at a start point when the expanded section is formed in the<br>
furnace 10.<br>
In the plasma reaction apparatus 50 with the above-described structure, the<br>
persistent gas, the hydrocarbon fuel and the oxidizer are first flowed into the furnace<br><br>
through the raw material inflow pipe 20 on the partial oxidization conditions. In the<br>
second embodiment, CH4 is used as the fuel and O2 is used as the oxidizer.<br>
Any other combustible gases may be used as the fuel and any other gases to<br>
induce an oxidation reaction of the fuel may be used as the oxidizer.<br>
The persistent gas, the fuel and the oxidizer may be sequentially or simultaneously<br>
flowed into the furnace 10.<br>
That is, after the fuel and the oxidizer are flowed into the furnace 10, the<br>
persistent gas may be flowed into the furnace 10. Or the fuel, the oxidizer and the<br>
persistent gas may be flowed into the furnace 10 simultaneously.<br>
As described above, when the persistent gas, the fuel and the oxidizer are flowed<br>
into the furnace 10, the persistent gas makes the plasma reaction by the discharge voltage<br>
generated between the electrode 30 being installed inside the furnace 10 and the inner wall<br>
of the furnace 10. Then, the plasma region is in a higher temperature state by the heat<br>
generated by the oxidation reaction of the fuel, thereby lowering the density of the plasma<br>
region. In the expanded plasma reaction zone, the density of electrons is increased<br>
since an electric current becomes higher, and the dissolution of the persistent gas is<br>
speeded up as radicals with high reactivity generated during the collision with the<br>
electrons and the oxidation reaction are rapidly increased. In addition, the radicals and<br>
ions with the high reactivity are generated during the oxidation reaction of the fuel,<br>
thereby improving the reactivity.<br><br>
Consequently, the fuel and the oxidizer increase the efficiency on the plasma<br>
reaction of the persistent gas, thereby enhancing the resolvability of the persistent gas.<br>
Furthermore, the broad area chamber 17 formed inside the furnace 10 enables the<br>
continuous plasma reaction of the persistent gas.<br>
According to the second embodiment of the present invention, the broad area<br>
chamber 17 formed in the furnace 10 expands the plasma reaction zone generated by the<br>
plasma reaction of the persistent gas inside the furnace 10, and the pointed end 19 formed<br>
at the start point of the broad area chamber 17 holds the plasma reaction zone, so that the<br>
plasma reaction zone is stayed in the broad area chamber 17 rather than it is directly<br>
discharged through a discharge opening 37 of the furnace 10. Furthermore, since the<br>
persistent gas flowed into the furnace 10 forms the rotating flow inside the furnace 10 as<br>
described above, the plasma reaction zone is likely to be more attached to the pointed end<br>
19 of the broad area chamber 17.<br>
As described above, when the plasma reaction zone is stayed inside the furnace 10,<br>
the persistent gas which is subsequently flowed into the furnace 10 continuously makes<br>
the plasma reaction by the plasma reaction zone being once generated. Consequently, the<br>
continuous plasma reaction is made, thereby preventing a loss on reaction caused by the<br>
discontinuous plasma reaction made by the plasma reaction zone which is periodically and<br>
repeatedly generated.<br>
FIG. 7 is a vertical section view illustrating a plasma reaction apparatus according<br>
to a third embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 8 is a cross sectional view<br>
illustrating a structure in which an inflow path is formed at an electrode in the plasma<br><br>
reaction apparatus of FIG. 7. The third embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
described as follows:<br>
A plasma reaction apparatus according to the third embodiment of the present<br>
invention comprises: a furnace; an electrode and a heat absorption tank. The furnace<br>
includes a lower part side to which a raw material inflow pipe for supplying a raw material<br>
for a plasma reaction is connected, an upper part at which a discharge opening for<br>
discharging a plasma reactant is formed, and a hollow in which a section positioned above<br>
an electrode is expanded in width, thereby forming a broad area chamber for temporarily<br>
staying a plasma reaction zone when the raw material being supplied to the inside of the<br>
furnace makes the plasma reaction. The electrode is protruded towards the inside of the<br>
furnace, for generating a discharge voltage for the plasma reaction of the raw material<br>
being supplied. The electrode is put into and connected to the bottom of the furnace and<br>
spaced from the wall surface of the furnace at a predetermined interval. The heat<br>
absorption tank is operatively connected to each of a liquefied raw material inflow pipe for<br>
allowing a liquefied raw material to flow into a chamber formed in the furnace and a<br>
liquefied raw material supply pipe with one side connected to the furnace, for supplying<br>
the liquefied raw material flowed into the chamber to the inside of the furnace. The heat<br>
absorption tank is positioned in the broad area chamber, so that the liquefied raw material<br>
flowed into the chamber absorbs heat in the chamber.<br>
The plasma reaction apparatus with the above-described characteristics will be<br>
more clearly described with reference to a preferred embodiment thereof.<br><br>
The plasma reaction apparatus according to the preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention will be described, in detail, with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
Before the plasma reaction apparatus according to the third embodiment is<br>
described, it is noted that the present invention relates to an apparatus for performing a<br>
reforming reaction of a liquefied or gaseous raw material by a plasma reaction or an<br>
apparatus for disposing of a raw material of various harmful matters, such as, waste matter<br>
and automobile exhaust gas, by a plasma reaction, and that the raw material mentioned<br>
below includes chemical compositions and various harmful matters which are harmful to<br>
environment.<br>
As illustrated in FIGS. 7 and 8, the plasma reaction apparatus 50 according to the<br>
third embodiment largely comprises a furnace 10, an electrode 30 and a heat absorption<br>
tank 93.<br>
The furnace 10 includes a hollow for providing a space for a plasma reaction and<br>
has an about cylindrical shape. The furnace 10 includes a lower part side to which a raw<br>
material inflow pipe 91 for receiving a raw material for the plasma reaction is connected,<br>
and an upper part at which a discharge opening 92 for discharge a plasma reactant is<br>
formed.<br>
The characteristic structure and shape of the furnace 10 will be more specifically<br>
described as follows:<br><br>
In the upper part of the furnace 10, a broad area chamber 17 is formed as the<br>
width of a section positioned above the electrode 30 is expanded. When the broad area<br>
chamber 17 is formed inside the furnace 10, a plasma reaction zone, which is formed by<br>
the plasma reaction in the section in which the electrode 30 is positioned in the furnace 10,<br>
is expanded through the broad area chamber 17 and is temporarily stayed there.<br>
Accordingly, the time for which a plasma reaction product is stayed is increased, thereby<br>
making it favorable to an additional reaction at a high temperature and resulting in the<br>
acting effect of excluding the discontinuity of plasma formation. Since the plasma<br>
reaction zone is stayed, a region of a higher temperature is formed in the broad area<br>
chamber 17. This is favorable for a liquefied raw material to absorb heat in the heat<br>
absorption tank 93, which will be described later. The upper part of the furnace 10 is<br>
bent, forming a step at a right angle. The discharge opening 92 formed at the top in the<br>
upper part of the furnace 10 is not positioned at a vertically extending line of the broad<br>
area chamber 17. According to the above-described structure, the plasma reaction zone<br>
is more stayed in the broad area chamber 17. As a deriving acting effect, a more reliable<br>
region of a high temperature is formed in the broad area chamber 17.<br>
The electrode 30 is protruded towards the inside of the furnace 10 and generates a<br>
discharge voltage for the plasma reaction of the raw material being supplied to the inside<br>
of the furnace 10. The electrode 30 is spaced from the wall surface of the furnace 10 at a<br>
predetermined interval and is put through the bottom of the furnace 10 to be connected<br>
thereto. The electrode 30 is connected to an outside power supply (not shown) for<br>
generating the voltage. The electrode 30 has the following characteristics in shape:<br>
An upper part of the electrode 30 has a conical shape and a lower part thereof has<br>
an extended cylindrical shape. Accordingly, in the electrode 30, the width of an about<br><br>
middle part corresponding to the bottom of the conical shape is relatively expanded,<br>
compared to the other parts. The lower part being extendedly formed in the cylindrical<br>
shape is relative narrow in width, compared to the upper part of the electrode 30. The<br>
summit of the conical shape and the portion connecting the conical shape and the<br>
cylindrical shape are roundly curved in the electrode 30. According to the above-<br>
described structure, the interval between the electrode 30 and the inner wall of the furnace<br>
10 is different depending on a height direction of the electrode 30. That is, the interval<br>
between the electrode 30 and the inner wall of the furnace 10 is narrow around the middle<br>
part of the electrode 30, and the interval maintains a relatively broad space from the inner<br>
wall of the furnace 10 in the upper part and lower part around the middle part of the<br>
electrode 30. Accordingly, when the raw material is flowed into a section positioned<br>
below the middle part of the electrode 30 in the furnace 10, since the interval between the<br>
middle part of the electrode 30 and the inner wall of the furnace 10 is narrow, the raw<br>
material is temporarily stayed and is sufficiently mixed at the lower part of the electrode<br>
30 and is progressed rather than it is directly progressed to the upper part of the electrode<br>
30.<br>
Further, the electrode includes a structure for additionally supplying a liquefied<br>
raw material, and this will be described below:<br>
A raw material inflow chamber 35 with a predetermined space is formed inside<br>
the electrode 30. An auxiliary liquefied raw material supply pipe 31 for allowing a<br>
liquefied raw material to flow into the raw material inflow chamber 35 is connected to the<br>
bottom of the electrode 30. An inflow path 94 for supplying the raw material in the raw<br>
material inflow chamber 35 to the inside of the furnace 10 (preferably, to the lower part of<br>
the electrode) is formed through the inner wall of the electrode 30. Accordingly, the<br><br>
liquefied raw material is additionally supplied to the inside of the furnace 10, without<br>
connecting any additional pipes to the furnace 10.<br>
An auxiliary gas supply pipe 33 is operatively connected to the auxiliary liquefied<br>
raw material supply pipe 31. Accordingly, the liquefied raw material and the gas for<br>
separating the liquefied raw material in fine particles are flowed into the raw material<br>
inflow chamber 35, thereby enabling the liquefied raw material to be sufficiently dispersed<br>
inside the raw material inflow chamber 35 and the furnace 10.<br>
The heat absorption tank 93 is installed in the furnace 10, to be positioned in the<br>
broad area chamber 17. The heat absorption tank 93 has a sphere shape in appearance.<br>
A chamber 55 with a predetermined space is formed inside the heat absorption tank 93.<br>
The heat absorption tank 93 is operatively connected to a liquefied raw material inflow<br>
pipe 51 for allowing the liquefied raw material to flow into the chamber 55. The heat<br>
absorption tank 93 is operatively connected to a liquefied raw material supply pipe 57 for<br>
supplying the liquefied raw material which flows into the chamber 55 to the inside of the<br>
furnace 10. That is, the liquefied raw material supply pipe 57 has one side being<br>
operatively connected to the furnace 10 and the other side being operatively connected to<br>
the heat absorption tank 93, thereby allowing the liquefied raw material in the chamber 55<br>
to be supplied to the inside of the furnace 10. The one side of the liquefied raw material<br>
supply pipe 57 may be operatively connected to the lower part of the furnace 10,<br>
preferably, to the section positioned below the middle part of the electrode 30, and may be<br>
wound around the outer circumference surface of the furnace 10 to sufficiently absorb the<br>
heat from the furnace 10. Preferably, the liquefied raw material inflow pipe 51 may be<br>
operatively connected to the upper part of the heat absorption tank 93 and may be<br>
perpendicular to the bottom of the furnace 10. This structure allows the liquefied raw<br><br>
material to be vertically supplied from the upper part to the lower part to the chamber 55<br>
of the heat absorption tank 93. Accordingly, the liquefied raw material supplied to the<br>
chamber 55 more directly and more easily reaches the bottom surface of the heat<br>
absorption tank 93 in contact with a high temperature plasma reaction zone inside the<br>
furnace 10, thereby enhancing the efficiency on heat absorption. The liquefied raw<br>
material inflow pipe 51 may be horizontal to the bottom of the furnace 10 and may be<br>
operatively connected to a side of the heat absorption tank 93. This structure is favorable<br>
when a number of liquefied raw material inflow pipes 51 are operatively connected to the<br>
heat absorption tank 93. For example, when a plurality or a number of liquefied raw<br>
material inflow pipes 51 are operatively connected to the heat absorption tank 93 to face<br>
each other, the liquefied raw material supplied to the chamber 55 of the heat absorption<br>
tank 93 through each liquefied raw material inflow pipe 51 is more effectively mixed.<br>
The third embodiment illustrates a single liquefied raw material inflow pipe 51 which is<br>
operatively connected to the upper part of the heat absorption tank 93 and which is<br>
perpendicular to the bottom of the furnace 10. Since the structure in which the liquefied<br>
raw material inflow pipe 51 is operatively connected to the heat absorption tank and is<br>
horizontal to the bottom of the furnace is considered to be easily applicable and carried out<br>
by those skilled in the art, based on the third embodiment of the present invention, it is not<br>
presented in drawings. The third embodiment illustrates that the liquefied raw material<br>
inflow pipe 51 is operatively connected to the heat absorption tank 93 in order to supply<br>
the liquefied raw material to the heat absorption tank 93. However, the liquefied raw<br>
material may be injected into the chamber 55, using an injecting device (not shown) being<br>
operatively connected to the heat absorption tank 93. This modification is obviously<br>
within the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
A gas supply pipe 53 is operatively connected to the liquefied raw material inflow<br>
pipe 51, thereby allowing the liquefied raw material and the gas for separating the<br>
liquefied raw material in fine particles to flow into the chamber 55. When the liquefied<br>
raw material and the gas (for separating the liquefied raw material in fine particles) flow<br>
into the chamber through the gas supply pipe 53, the liquefied raw material is more<br>
effectively spread or activated.<br>
A heater 59 as a heating unit for forcibly heating the liquefied raw material<br>
flowing into the chamber 55 is installed in the heat absorption tank 93. At a start point<br>
when a high temperature environment is incompletely formed in the broad area chamber<br>
17 of the furnace 10, that is, at the beginning of operating the plasma reaction apparatus 50,<br>
the heater 59 forcibly heats or vaporizes the liquefied raw material flowing into the<br>
chamber 55.<br>
The heater 59 is electrically connected to an outside power source (not shown).<br>
The heater 59 is positioned in the heat absorption tank 93 and protrudes in the chamber 55<br>
of the heat absorption tank 93. Although the heater 59 may be installed inside a wall<br>
frame of the heat absorption tank 93, it is installed to protrude in the chamber 55 so that<br>
the raw material directly contacts with the surface of the heater 59 in the chamber 55 and<br>
is effectively vaporized. When the heater 59 is installed, components and portions for the<br>
electrical connection need to be coated with an insulating material in order to prevent an<br>
electric short inside the furnace 10.<br>
According to the heat absorption tank 93 and its relevant constitution and<br>
structure as described above, the liquefied raw material flowing through the liquefied raw<br>
material inflow pipe absorbs heat in the chamber 55 and is dispersed or activated to be<br><br>
supplied to the inside of the furnace 10 through the liquefied raw material supply pipe 57.<br>
Accordingly, the liquefied raw material being supplied is more easily mixed with other<br>
raw materials (for example, the gaseous raw material) and is spread on the entire surface<br>
of the electrode, thereby enabling the plasma reaction to be more effectively performed.<br>
FIG. 9 is a vertical section view illustrating a plasma reaction apparatus according<br>
to a fourth embodiment of the present invention. In the plasma reaction apparatus<br>
according to the fourth embodiment, a mixing tank 70 is formed at an outer wall of the<br>
furnace 10, and a raw material inflow pipe 91 and a liquefied raw material supply pipe 57<br>
are operatively connected to the furnace 10 by the mixing tank 70. A mixing chamber 75<br>
of a predetermined volume is formed inside the mixing tank 70. Accordingly, the raw<br>
materials which respectively progress from the raw material inflow pipe 91 and the<br>
liquefied raw material supply pipe 57 are mixed in the mixing chamber 75 formed inside<br>
the mixing tank 70 and are supplied to the inside of the furnace 10. That is, the mixing<br>
tank 70 is operatively connected to the raw material inflow pipe 91, the liquefied raw<br>
material supply pipe 57 and the furnace 10. The constitution of the mixing tank 70 as<br>
described above improves the mixability of the raw materials which are supplied through<br>
the raw material inflow pipe 91 and the liquefied raw material supply pipe 57. An<br>
additional heating unit (not shown) may be installed in the mixing tank 70 if necessary.<br>
FIG. 10 is a schematic view illustrating an apparatus for decreasing NOx<br>
according to the present invention; FIG. 11 is a sectional view of a plasma reactor in an<br>
apparatus for decreasing NOx, according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention,<br>
and FIG. 12 is a sectional view of a flow of a fluid in the plasma reactor of FIG. 11. An<br>
apparatus for decreasing NOx moves an exhaust gas, which is released from an engine<br>
using hydrocarbon fuel supplied from a storage, to an occlusion catalyst; adsorbing NOx<br><br>
of the exhaust gas to the occlusion catalyst, and then reducing NOx to be removed. The<br>
apparatus for decreasing NOx comprises a plasma reactor which is connected to a path<br>
through which the exhaust gas is moved from the engine to the occlusion catalyst and<br>
which reforms the hydrocarbon fuel partially supplied from the storage to a reducing<br>
ambient gas of high temperature from the plasma reactor by a plasma reaction.<br>
The apparatus for decreasing NOx comprises a body; an electrode; and a liquefied<br>
fuel injection unit. The body includes a furnace and a base. The furnace includes a<br>
discharge opening and a hollow. The discharge opening is formed at one side of the<br>
furnace. The hollow includes a heat absorption path formed in a wall frame forming the<br>
thickness of the furnace, and the heat absorption path allows a gas flowing from a gas<br>
inflow opening to move and to absorb heat. The base forms the bottom of the furnace<br>
and includes a mixing chamber. The mixing chamber is operatively connected to the heat<br>
absorption path and the inside of the furnace through an inflow hole formed at the furnace.<br>
The electrode is spaced from an inner wall of the furnace, fixed to the base and protrudes<br>
in the furnace, in order to form a discharge voltage for a plasma reaction in the furnace.<br>
The electrode includes a heat absorption chamber which is operatively connected to the<br>
mixing chamber. Liquefied fuel flows into the heat absorption chamber. The liquefied<br>
fuel injection unit is fixed to the body and supplies the liquefied fuel to the heat absorption<br>
chamber of the electrode.<br>
The apparatus for decreasing NOx with the above-described characteristics will be<br>
more clearly described with reference to a preferred embodiment thereof.<br><br>
The apparatus for decreasing NOx according to the preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention will be described, in detail, with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
As illustrated in FIGS. 10 through 12, an apparatus 200 for decreasing NOx<br>
according to the present invention moves an exhaust gas, which is released from an engine<br>
220 using hydrocarbon fuel supplied from a fuel tank 21 which is a storage storing the<br>
hydrocarbon fuel, to an occlusion catalyst 30 and removes NOx of the exhaust gas.<br>
The occlusion catalyst 30 is called a lean NOx trap (LNT) catalyst. When NOx<br>
of the exhaust gas being moved is adsorbed, the occlusion catalyst 30 reduces NOx to be<br>
removed. Since the detailed constitution and action of the occlusion catalyst 30 are well<br>
known, no description thereof will be presented.<br>
The apparatus 200 for decreasing NOx comprises a plasma reactor 50. When<br>
NOx is reduced by the occlusion catalyst 30, the plasma reactor 50 injects a reducing<br>
ambient gas of high temperature to be supplied to the occlusion catalyst 30. The plasma<br>
reactor 50 is connected to the fuel tank 210. The plasma reactor 50 acts as a reformer for<br>
reforming the hydrocarbon fuel, which is partially supplied from the fuel tank 210 to the<br>
plasma reactor 50, to the reducing ambient gas of high temperature by a plasma reaction.<br>
In the plasma reactor 50, a discharge opening 62 may be installed towards the<br>
occlusion catalyst 30 so that the reducing ambient gas reformed by the plasma reaction is<br>
discharged from the plasma reactor 50 and is injected to the occlusion catalyst 30. The<br>
discharge opening 62 of the plasma reactor 50 may be simply operatively connected to a<br>
movement pipe 40 through which the exhaust gas is moved, as shown.<br><br>
The characteristic constitution of the plasma reactor for generating the reducing<br>
ambient gas of high temperature from the hydrocarbon fuel will be described below:<br>
The plasma reactor 50, which is used as the reformer in the apparatus 200 for<br>
decreasing NOx according to the present invention, largely comprises: a body 60, an<br>
electrode 70 and a liquefied fuel injection unit.<br>
The body 60 includes a furnace 61 and a base 65.<br>
The furnace 61 includes a hollow and has an about cylindrical shape. A<br>
discharge opening 62 is formed at one side of the furnace 51 and discharges a reacted<br>
matter after the plasma reaction. A gas inflow opening 63 is formed in the furnace 6land<br>
allows a gas to flow into the inside of the furnace 61. A heat absorption path 64 is<br>
formed inside a wall frame forming the thickness of the furnace 61 and allows the gas<br>
flowing from the gas inflow opening 63 to move along a circumference direction and to<br>
absorb heat. The heat absorption path 64 is formed in an about coil shape, along the<br>
circumference direction of the furnace 61.<br>
The base 65 forms the bottom of the furnace 61. A mixing chamber 67 of a<br>
predetermined volume is formed in the base 65. The mixing chamber 67 is operatively<br>
connected to the heat absorption path 64 formed in the wall frame of the furnace 61 and is<br>
simultaneously operatively connected to the inside of the furnace 61 through an inflow<br>
hole 68 formed at the furnace 61. Preferably, the inflow hole 68 may be formed to be<br>
tilted at a predetermined angle to a normal of an inner wall of the furnace 61, that is, in a<br>
swirl structure.<br><br>
The furnace 61 and the base 65 may be formed in one body or may be separately<br>
formed to be connected to each other. The base 65 needs to include an insulator (not<br>
shown), such as ceramic, to prevent the application of an electric current between a lower<br>
part of the electrode 70, which will be described below, and the furnace 61.<br>
The electrode 70 is to generate a discharge voltage for the plasma reaction in the<br>
furnace 61. For this purpose, the electrode 70 is spaced from the inner wall of the<br>
furnace 61 at a predetermined interval and is fixed to the base 65 to protrude in the furnace<br>
61. The electrode has an about conical shape. A heat absorption chamber 75 is formed<br>
in the electrode. The heat absorption chamber 75 is operatively connected to the mixing<br>
chamber 67. Liquefied fuel being supplied from the liquefied fuel injection unit flows<br>
into and temporarily stays in the heat absorption chamber 75.<br>
The liquefied fuel injection unit is connected to the fuel tank 210 and supplies the<br>
liquefied fuel stored in the fuel tank 210 to the heat absorption chamber 75 of the electrode<br>
70. The liquefied fuel injection unit is fixed to the body 60. A liquefied fuel injection<br>
device 80 or an injector (not shown) may be used as the liquefied fuel injection unit. The<br>
liquefied fuel injection device 80 injects the liquefied fuel to the absorption chamber 75 by<br>
a movement force of a gas supplied from the fuel tank 210, together with the liquefied fuel.<br>
The injector (not shown) directly injects the liquefied fuel to the heat absorption chamber<br>
75 of the electrode 70.<br>
FIGS. 11 and 12 illustrates the liquefied fuel injection device 80 used as the<br>
liquefied fuel injection unit.<br><br>
That is, the liquefied fuel injection device 80 includes the liquefied fuel supply<br>
pipe 81, which is operatively connected to the fuel tank 210 and supplies the liquefied fuel,<br>
and a gas supply pipe 82, which is operatively connected to an outside gas supply source,<br>
independently from the liquefied fuel supply pipe 81, and supplies a gas, thereby allowing<br>
the inflow of the liquefied fuel and the gas simultaneously. The side from which the<br>
liquefied fuel and gas are injected face towards the heat absorption chamber 75 of the<br>
electrode.<br>
An operational example of the apparatus for decreasing NOx according to the<br>
present invention will be described below:<br>
An exhaust gas, which is generated according to the operation of an engine 220, is<br>
moved to an occlusion catalyst 30 through a movement pipe 40. The movement pipe 40<br>
is operatively connected to the side of a discharge opening 62 of a plasma reactor 50, so<br>
that a reducing ambient gas of high temperature generated from the plasma reactor 50 is<br>
moved to the occlusion catalyst 30 and speeds up a reducing action of NOx in the<br>
occlusion catalyst 30.<br>
The action of the plasma reactor 50 will be described in more detail. The plasma<br>
reactor 50 receives hydrocarbon fuel supplied from a fuel tank 210 through a liquefied fuel<br>
injection device 80 and simultaneously allows an inflow of air including O2, which acts as<br>
an oxidizer needed upon a reforming reaction of the liquefied fuel (hydrocarbon fuel)<br>
being supplied, through a gas inflow opening 63. When temperature sufficiently rises<br>
and is activated, the air is moved to a mixing chamber 67 through a heat absorption path<br>
64. When the liquefied fuel, which is moved to a heat absorption chamber 75 of an<br>
electrode 70 through the liquefied fuel injection device 80, absorbs heat in the heat<br><br>
absorption chamber 75 and is vaporized and activated, the liquetied fuel is moved to the<br>
mixing chamber 67 to be mixed with the air in the mixing chamber 67 and then flows into<br>
a furnace 61 through an inflow hole 68.<br>
In accordance with the forgoing, it is noted that after the air and the liquefied fuel<br>
being supplied are sufficiently mixed in the mixing chamber 67, they flow into the furnace<br>
61. Furthermore, since the liquefied fuel is directly injected from the heat absorption<br>
chamber 75 and the liquefied fuel is prevented from directly contacting with the outer<br>
surface of the electrode 70, the wetting and coking phenomena of the liquefied fuel are<br>
prevented. Furthermore, since the liquefied fuel absorbing heat in the heat absorption<br>
chamber 75 is immediately mixed with the air in the mixing chamber 67, the liquefied fuel<br>
is basically prevented from being liquefied during its movement.<br>
The mixed fuel of the liquefied fuel and the air which are supplied to the inside of<br>
the furnace through the inflow hole 68 makes a plasma reaction with relatively high<br>
efficiency, compared to a volume, because of the characteristic structures of the inflow<br>
hole 68 and the electrode 70. That is, in accordance with the present invention, since the<br>
electrode 70 has a conical shape and the inflow hole 68 is formed in the swirl structure, the<br>
mixed fuel flowing into the furnace through the inflow hole 68 continuously makes the<br>
plasma reaction, along the circumference direction of the electrode 70.<br>
In the plasma reactor 50 as described above, the reducing ambient gas, which is<br>
generated by reforming the liquefied fuel and the air as the oxidizer being first supplied,<br>
may be hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) or hydrogen (H2). On the conditions<br>
that the ambient gas is supplied, NOx is reduced to a nitrogen (N2) gas.<br><br>
Furthermore, when the plasma reactor 50, which is illustrated in FIG. 10 as the<br>
schematic view of the apparatus for decreasing NOx according to the present invention,<br>
uses the constitution of the plasma reaction apparatus 50 described with reference to the<br>
first through fourth embodiments, the same effects as the fifth embodiment are obtained.<br>
While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to<br>
exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art<br>
that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims.<br><br>
