DESCRIPTION COMBINATION DRUG<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical agents comprising a dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) inhibitor and a biguanide agent, which enhance the effects of active circulating glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and/or active circulating glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2).<br>
Background Art<br>
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a hormone known to be secreted in response to food intake from L cells in the distal part of the small intestine.    It enhances the secretion sf insulin from pancreatic [3 cells in a glucose-dependent manner.    GLP-1 is degraded and rapidly inactivated by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV).    Thus, DPPIV inhibitors can be used as preventive and/or therapeutic agents for diseases such as diabetes (particularly typell diabetes) and obesity, with which GLP-1 levels are associated.    DPPIV inhibitors have been under development in clinical trials and are disclosed in Patent documents 1, 2, and 3.<br>
Metformin, a biguanide agent, has commonly been used as a preventive and/or therapeutic agent for diabetes.<br>
In recent years, new findings have been reported successively: GLP-1 levels are increased in obese non-diabetic patients upon administration of metformin (Non-patent document 1); and a combination of metformin and GLP-1 is effective to treat typell diabetes (Non-patent document 2).    However, even if the level of GLP-1 is elevated transiently by metformin, GLP-1 is rapidly degraded and inactivated by DPPIV as described above. Therefore, the elevated level of GLP-1 does not have a long duration, and thus GLP-1 effects are extremely reduced.   This is a problem to be solved.<br>
Non-patent documents 3 and 4 suggest the applicability of the combined use of a DPPIV inhibitor and metformin.    Patent documents 4 to 8 describe the combined use of a DPPIV inhibitor and a biguanide agent.    However, these documents have not disclosed particular test results for the combined use of these agents.    In other words, there is no combination drug that contains a DPPIV inhibitor and metformin, which is known to enhance the effects of GLP-1.<br>
It has been reported that glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is a hormone secreted in response to food intake from L cells in the distal part of the small intestine like GLP-1, and that it can be used for preventing and/or treating gastrointestinal diseases (Non-patent documents 5 to 9).    However, like GLP-1, GLP-2 is rapidly degraded and inactivated by DPPIV.<br><br>
Consequently, there has been demand to develop agents suppressing the degradation of GLP-2,<br>
and therefore enhancing GLP-2 effects.   However, there are no reports describing increases in<br>
the GLP-2 level upon administration of metformin or the enhancement of GLP-2 effects by the<br>
combined use of a DPPIV inhibitor and metformin.<br>

Each test compound or distilled water was given orally at the above dose, twice daily (at 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.), for 14 days. The rats were tested for glucose tolerance on the first day of the administration series.   In the test, distilled water and the test compounds were given 0.5 hour before glucose load. [Procedure of blood collection and determination of the levels of blood glucose and GLP-1]<br>
For the glucose tolerance test, an unanesthetized rat was lightly cut at the caudal vein with a razor blade and bled immediately before the administration of a test compound or distilled water. and immediately before, and at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 hours after glucose load.   250 |iL of blood was collected from the rat using a heparinized capillary and transferred into a centrifugation tube.

During the glucose tolerance test, the level of active GLP-1 was elevated significantly in the group administered the DPP IV inhibitor, while there was no significant increase in the active GLP-1 level in the group administered metformin.    However, the level of active GLP-1 was increased synergistically in the group administered both metformin and the DPPIV inhibitor. This result suggests that the active GLP-1 level was increased through enhanced GLP-1 secretion induced by metformin, and suppressed GLP-1 degradation due to the DPPIV inhibitor, as described above.<br>
The glucose tolerance test revealed that glucose tolerance was improved in each group singly administered either metformin or the DPPIV inhibitor.    However, glucose tolerance was improved synergistically in the group administered metformin and the DPPIV inhibitor in combination, when compared with the groups administered either compound singly.<br>
During the glucose tolerance test, the level of insulin was increased significantly in a glucose-dependent fashion in the group administered the DPPIV inhibitor singly, while there was no significant increase in the level of insulin in the groups administered either metformin alone, or metformin and the DPPIV inhibitor in combination.    This result suggests that the effect observed in the metformin-administered group was based on the extra-pancreatic action of this agent, while the effect in the DPPIV inhibitor-administered group was based on the glucose-dependent increase in the insulin level, due to the increase in the level of active GLP-1. On the other hand, it is suggested that the group administered metformin and the DPPIV inhibitor in combination had synergistically improved glucose tolerance due to the enhanced susceptibility to insulin, based on the extra-pancreatic action of metformin, and the synergistic increase in the level of active GLP-1 resulting from the combined administration.<br>
Furthermore, decreases in food intake and suppression of weight gain were observed only in the group administered metformin and the DPPIV inhibitor in combination for 14 days.<br><br>
It may be concluded that the synergistic increase in the level of active GLP-1 due to the combined use of metformin and the DPPIV inhibitor, led to the decrease in food intake via the hypothalamus, which in turn resulted in the suppression of weight gain.<br>
In addition, synergistic decreases in the levels of blood glucose and insulin during fasting were found in the group administered metformin and the DPPIV inhibitor in combination for 14 days.   It is conceivable that this resulted from enhanced glucose metabolism, due to the synergistic improvement in glucose tolerance and suppressed weight gain in the group administered metformin and the DPPIV inhibitor in combination.   This suggests that the combined use of metformin and a DPPIV inhibitor is effective to treat typell diabetes.<br>

Influence of metformin on the level of GLP-2 in DPPIV-deficiencv rats<br>
Animals: DPPIV-deficient male Fischer rats (purchased from Charles River Japan, Inc.)<br>
Methods:<br>
[Preparation and administration of test compound]<br>
The test compound was suspended in a solution of 0.5% methyl cellulose at the dose indicated in Table 11, and then administered orally at a volume of 5 mL/kg.   The vehicle control group was orally administered an aqueous solution of 0.5% methyl cellulose at a volume of 5 mL/kg. [Blood collection and determination of GLP-2 level]<br>
An unanesthetized rat was lightly cut at the caudal vein with a razor blade and bled immediately before, and at 1, 3. and 5 hours after administration of a test compound or a solution of 0.5% methyl cellulose.   250 )-iL of blood was collected from the rat using a heparinized capillar}' and transferred intaacentrifugation tube.   The supernatant obtained by centrifugation (at 10000 g at 4°C for 2 minutes) was assayed for GLP-2 level using GLP-2 ELISA kit (Yanaihara Institute Inc.). Results:<br>
The result is represented as an "average value ± standard error".   The respective values were assessed and compared by t-test, which are shown in Table 11.<br>
[Table 11]<br><br>
Test compound	Dose (mg/kg)	GLP-2 concentration at each time point (hr) after oral administration (ng/ml)<br><br><br>
	0	1	3	5<br>
Vehicle control		1.39±0.05	1.31±0.Q2	1.36±0.04	1.28±0.07<br>
Metformin	300	1.32±0.02	1.65±0.06~*	2.08±0.07~*	2.15±0.05~*<br><br>
***; P 
In the group administered metformin, the level of GLP-2 was significantly elevated in plasma at 1, 3, and 5 hours after administration in DPPIV-deficient rats.    This result suggests that the combined use of metformin and the DPPIV inhibitor could synergistically enhance the action of GLP-2, and thus could be effective to treat gastrointestinal diseases.<br>
[Assay Example 71<br>
Influences of metformin and the DPPIV inhibitor fvaline pvrrolidide (Val-Pvr)\ used singly or in<br>
combination, on the atrophy of small intestine caused by 5-fluoro uracil (5-FU)<br>
Animals: BALB/c AnCrj mice (purchased from Charles River Japan, Inc.)<br>
Methods:<br>
[Preparation and administration of test compounds]<br>
5-FU (purchased from Sigma) was suspended in a solution of 0.5% methyl cellulose, and then administered orally at a volume of 10 mL/kg/day (8 a.m. to 9 a.m.) for 3 days (60 mg/kg).    Each test compound was suspended in a solution of 0.5% methyl cellulose at the doses indicated in Table ,12, and then administered orally twice a day, at a volume of 10 mL/kg (8 a.m. to 9 a.m., and 3 p.m. to 4 p.m.).    The vehicle control group was orally administered a solution of 0.5% methyl cellulose at a volume of 10 mL/kg.    A group which did not receive 5-FU is defined as the normal control group. [Collection of samples of small intestine]<br>
Mice were fasted for 18 hours following the afternoon administration on the third day of the administration series.    On the following day, the mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and then the whole small intestine was excised and the wet weight was measured. Results:<br>
The result is represented as an "average value ± standard error".    The respective values were assessed and compared by Tukey's test, which are shown in Table 12.<br>
[Table 12]<br><br><br>
**: P 
5-FU significantly decreased the wet weight of mouse small intestine.    The administration of either metformin or the DPPIV inhibitor alone resulted in no alteration in the wet weight of small intestine in the group of mice treated with 5-FU.    In contrast, the combined administration of metformin and the DPPIV inhibitor resulted in a significant increase in the wet weight of small intestine.    The increase can be caused by the enhancement of GLP-2 activity resulting from the combined use of metformin and the DPPIV inhibitor.    This suggests that the combined use of metformin and the DPPIV inhibitor can be used to treat gastrointestinal diseases, as the increase in the level of GLP-2 results in suppression of apoptosis and enhancement of growth of epithelial cells of the small intestine.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
Pharmaceutical agents comprising a DPPIV inhibitor and a biguanide agent according to the present invention enhance the action of active circulating GLP-1 and/or active circulating GLP-2, and can be used as preventive and/or therapeutic agents for diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, gastrointestinal diseases, and such.    In addition, if the pharmaceutical agents according to the present invention are used in combination, the respective agents can be administered at lesser doses as compared with cases where each agent is given singly, which may reduce the risks of adverse side effects of biguanide agents (for example, symptoms of gastrointestinal system, such as diarrhea).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
