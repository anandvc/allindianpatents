				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a metal joining process of welding using electric arc as<br>
the source of heat for melting the joinable metals. More particularly, the<br>
invention relates to a system for diagnosing the dynamic characteristics of arc<br>
welding power source.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Welding power source is an electrical equipment specifically designed to cater to<br>
different types of arc welding applications. Such power supply systems are<br>
manufactured worldwide; M/s. Lincoln Electric, Esab, Memco are some of the<br>
well-known industries manufacturing such systems.<br>
The electric power supplied by the welding power source generates arc between<br>
the electrode and the work piece. This arc is a source of heat for melting the<br>
materials to be joined. Continuous and stable arc is essential for achieving good<br>
quality welding. Welding equipment manufacturers test the power sources for<br>
electrical characteristics and safety requirements according to standard of the<br>
respective nation. Standards pertaining to welding power sources are : BS-7570,<br>
BS-672 etc. Static characteristics of a power source are evaluated by testing<br>
under static conditions without the welding arc. Dynamic characteristics tests are<br>
carried out during welding operation. Dynamic characteristics of the power<br>
source are generally not carried out by the manufacturers.<br>
The static characteristics of the welding power source are evaluated by using<br>
standard electrical measuring instruments, by adapting the procedure defined by<br>
the testing methods. Understanding dynamic characteristics of the welding<br>
power source is required to evaluate the behavior of the welding power source<br>
during welding. This dynamic characteristic requires special purpose evaluation<br>
system and cannot be evaluated using standard electrical measuring and testing<br>
instruments.<br>
Assesing the dynamic behaviour of a power source is very important to ensure<br>
the quality of the welding produced. Unfortunately, this dynamic behaviour or<br>
dynamic characteristics of a welding power source is not evaluated by the<br>
manufacturers because there is no standard instrument available to evaluate<br>
these dynamic characteristics.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a system for diagnising the dynamic<br>
characteristics of arc welding power source to produce better welding qualities.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a system for diagnising the dynamic<br>
characteristics of arc welding power source, which determines the stability,<br>
ignition characteristics and the spatter characteristic of the arc for evaluating the<br>
dynamic characteristics of the power source.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a system for diagnising the<br>
dynamic characteristics of arc welding power source in which welding voltage<br>
and current of a power source is captured in real time for subsequent processing<br>
and evaluation based on the recorded data thereby evaluating the dynamic<br>
characteristics of the power source.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An exclusive power source diagnostic system characterizes the welding power<br>
source for its welding qualities. The system employs a computerized diagnostic<br>
interface using microprocessor hardware and software for data acquisition and<br>
evaluation of dynamic characteristics of the welding power sources, such as the<br>
stability, ignition characteristics and the spatter characteristics of the arc. Thus<br>
the performance of the welding power source can be uniquely evaluated by this<br>
diagnostic system. The diagnostic system essentially collects the voltage and<br>
current signals during welding and analyses the dynamic characteristics using a<br>
computer program, thus evaluating the quality level of the arc welding power<br>
source in relation to one another.<br>
The diagnostic system is adapted to carry-out evaluation of the dynamic<br>
characteristics of the welding power source. The evaluation comprises<br>
determining the dynamic behaviour of the power source during real-time welding<br>
operation. A data acquisition module captures welding voltage and current in real<br>
time and the recorded data is processed by a computer through a software and<br>
the following index values are calculated and displayed along with the waveform<br>
recording.<br>
a. Arc stability index<br>
b. Arc ignition index<br>
c. Spatter index<br>
The arc stability index value indicates the stability of the arc produced by the<br>
power source under evaluation while keeping the quality of the welding<br>
consumable, welding parameter and the welder constant. The arc ignition index<br>
indicates the re-ignition characteristic of the arc during short / open circuits. The<br>
spatter index is an indication of spatter level produced by the arc during welding.<br>
In addition, the routine tests are to be conducted as per relevant standards.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a system for on-line diagnosing the<br>
dynamic characteristics of an arc welding power source, comprising atleast one<br>
voltage sensor for sensing the welding voltage, atleast one current sensor for<br>
sensing the arc current signal, an analog signal conditioner receiving the voltage<br>
and current data in the form of analog signals from the atleast one voltage<br>
sensor and the atleast one current sensor and converting the analog signals to<br>
digital signals, a micro controller based data acquisition module receiving the<br>
digital signals from the analog signal conditioner for processing and storing the<br>
processed data; and an apparatus receiving the processed data from the data<br>
acquisition module and having a computer program operable to interpret the<br>
dynamic characteristics of the power source.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
As shown in Fig - 1 Welding power source (1) supplies current and voltage for<br>
the weld zone. A work piece (5) is connected to a return terminal of the power<br>
source (1) through a return cable (3A). An welding electrode (6) is connected to<br>
the source terminal of the power source (1) through a cable first (3). A welding<br>
arc (7) is generated between the electrode (6) and the work piece (5). A Voltage<br>
sensor (2) senses the welding voltage and sends a signal to a signal conditioner<br>
module (10) through a second cable (8). A current sensor (4) senses the welding<br>
current and sends a signal to the signal conditioner module (10) through a third<br>
cable (9). The conditioned signal is fed to a micro-controller based hardware (12)<br>
through a fourth cable (11). A personal computer (14) evaluates the power<br>
source under diagnosis. A serial communication interface (13) links the personal<br>
computer (14) to the micro controller hardware (12).<br>
The welding power source (1) is connected to the electrode (6) and the welding<br>
arc (7) is ignited between the electrode (6) and the work piece (5). Generally,<br>
the voltage and current data are monitored using, analog / digital meters. To<br>
evaluate the dynamic characteristics of the power source (1), the current and<br>
voltage data are to be continuously recorded and stored in the personal<br>
computer memory for evaluation.<br>
The details of the diagnostic system, for evaluating dynamic characteristics of<br>
the arc welding power source are shown in fig. 2. This system consists of two<br>
sensors - one is a current sensor (4) and the other is a voltage sensor (2). The<br>
current and voltage output from the welding power source under test are given<br>
to these sensors as input. The signal outputs from the sensors (2,4) are<br>
processed by a signal conditioner module (10) and then sent to an analog to<br>
digital converter (ADC). Power supply unit (1) supplies DC power to the signal<br>
conditioner (10) and the analog to digital converter (ADC). Mains power supply<br>
230V AC (21) is converted to generate DC power required for operation of the<br>
module (10). The digital information from the ADC is read by the micro controller<br>
CPU (12) of the micro controller module (9) and the digital data is stored in a<br>
memory (15) of the hardware (9). A timer function (16) of the micro controller<br>
(9) is used for programming the sampling rate of the data collected from the<br>
ADC. A keypad (17) and a display (18) are used for inputting data and viewing<br>
the status during hardware debugging. The data is collected over a period of<br>
time set by the software option and is stored in the volatile memory (15) of the<br>
micro controller (9). The stored data is then transferred to the host PC (14)<br>
through RS 232 serial port (13) for processing and calculation of the index<br>
values. Serial communication cable (19) interlinks the diagnostic hardware (12)<br>
and personal computer (14). A diagnostic software (20) being a menu driven<br>
program runs on the PC (14) and controls the flow of the operation. The data<br>
acquisition and processing software (20) has been developed using Visual Basic<br>
platform. The pattern of the weld current and voltages are plotted as shown in<br>
the fig. 3 and the index levels are indicated on the PC screen.<br>
According to the embodiment of the invention illustrated in fig - 2, the voltage<br>
sensor (2), and the current sensor (4) are non contact type sensors commercially<br>
available in the market. The personal computer (14) is a standard PC operating<br>
on MS Windows platform. Module (9) is a commercially available 8051 based<br>
micro controller board, programmed for this application. Module (7) is a board<br>
consisting of analog signal conditioner. ADC and power supply and was made to<br>
requirement.<br>
