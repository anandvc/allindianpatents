				<td>HELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method of checking the presence of objects, which<br>
are characterized by noncontact readable data carriers, wherein each noncontact readable data<br>
carrier can be identified unambiguously or in groups, wherein the data carriers of those<br>
objects whose presence is to be checked are allocated to one check group.<br>
The invention further relates to a device for checking the presence of objects,<br>
which are characterized by noncontact readable data carriers, wherein each noncontact<br>
readable data carrier can be identified unambiguously or in groups, wherein the data carriers<br>
of those objects whose presence is to be checked are allocated to one check group.<br>
The invention further relates to a system for checking the presence of objects,<br>
which are characterized by noncontact readable data carriers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A reminding system and method used for reminding a user of missing portable<br>
electronic devices are known from document US 6 462 660. For this purpose, the reminding<br>
system transmits a signal to every portable electronic device that is to be detected by the<br>
reminding system upon occurrence of an activation event. If one or more of the addressed<br>
portable electronic devices do not respond to this signal, the reminding system alarms the<br>
user of the missing devices.<br>
It has proved to be a disadvantage in the known reminding system and method<br>
that the generation of the activation event is not achieved satisfactorily. It is therefore<br>
proposed in this document to consider the leaving on of an automobile, the opening or<br>
closing of a door or the expiry of a preset period to be an activation event. All these proposed<br>
events, however, demand constructive measures such as the installation of switches on<br>
devices that have nothing to do with the reminding system per se or that either an interaction<br>
of the user for setting the time is required on the expiry of a preset period, or it is possible<br>
that a fixed preset expiry period is not suitable for the individual case.<br>
OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to create a presence checking method of the<br>
type indicated in the opening paragraph, a presence checking device of the type indicated in<br>
the second paragraph and a presence checking system of the type indicated in the third<br>
paragraph, in which the disadvantages mentioned earlier are avoided.<br>
To achieve the above-mentioned object, a presence checking method as<br>
invented has features such that a method as invented can be characterized in the manner<br>
mentioned below, namely:<br>
A method of checking the presence of objects, which are characterized by<br>
noncontact readable data carriers, wherein each noncontact readable data carrier can be<br>
identified unambiguously or in groups, wherein the data carriers of those objects whose<br>
presence is to be checked are allocated to one check group, the method comprising the<br>
detection of data carriers by data carrier reading means, the detection whether at least one of<br>
the detected data carriers is allocated to an activation group and the activation of the presence<br>
check, if at least one of the detected data carriers is allocated to the activation group, wherein<br>
it is checked at the time of the presence check whether all the data carriers allocated to the <br>
check group are detected by the data carrier reading means and, if not, an alarm signal is<br>
transmitted.<br>
To achieve the above-mentioned object, features as invented are provided on a<br>
presence check device as invented, such that a device as invented can be characterized in the<br>
manner mentioned below, namely:<br>
A device for checking the presence of objects, which are characterized by<br>
noncontact readable data carriers, wherein each noncontact readable data carrier can be<br>
identified unambiguously or in groups, wherein the data carriers of those objects whose<br>
presence is to be checked are allocated to one check group, the device comprising data carrier<br>
reading means for detection of data carriers, detection means for detecting whether at least<br>
one of the data carriers detected by the data carrier reading means is allocated to an activation<br>
group and for activation check means if at least one of the detected data carriers is allocated<br>
to the activation group, wherein the check means are arranged for comparing whether all the<br>
data carriers allocated to the check group are detected by the data carrier reading means and,<br>
if they are not, for transmitting an alarm signal.<br>
To achieve the above-mentioned object in such a system for checking the<br>
presence of objects characterized by noncontact readable data carriers, a device as invented<br>
for checking the presence, as well as a plurality of noncontact readable data carriers are<br>
provided, wherein a first set of the data carriers is allocated to a check group and a second set<br>
of data carriers is allocated to an activation group and optionally also to the check group.<br>
It is achieved by means of the features as invented that the checking of<br>
presence of certain objects is linked to the presence of certain conditions such that it is<br>
possible to prevent undesired alarms from being generated as often happens if the presence<br>
check is carried out constantly. Unlike state of the art systems, which assess activation<br>
events, it is not necessary according to the invention to provide measures unrelated to the<br>
check system on devices such as installation of switches on automobiles, doors, bags or such.<br>
Such additional measures are not accepted by users and therefore hamper dissemination of<br>
these known systems. The invention can moreover be integrated very well into portable<br>
electronic devices such as mobile telephones or PDAs, which often already contain all<br>
assemblies required for the realization of the invention, such that the invention can be<br>
integrated into such devices without additional expenditure. For example, there are already<br>
mobile telephones and PDAs, in which reading devices for noncontact data carriers are<br>
available. It is therefore proposed to deliver, together with such devices, a number of data<br>
carriers, which can be glued to objects whose presence is to be checked i.e. and which are<br>
allocated to a check group or whose presence is to give cause to check the presence of other<br>
objects i.e. which are allocated to an activation group. The serial numbers of the data carriers<br>
supplied along can already be pre-stored under their allocation to the check group and/or to<br>
the presence group in the delivered device, such that the expenditure for the user is reduced<br>
to sticking the data carrier to the desired objects.<br>
The advantage derived according to the measures as claimed in Claims 2 and 6<br>
is that the creation of the check group and the activation group takes place in a manner that is<br>
extremely simple and comfortable to the user, in which operating errors are largely<br>
eliminated.<br>
The advantage derived according to the measures as claimed in Claims 3 and 7<br>
is that the presence check is executed only in a defined, short period or that there is a onetime<br>
check run, thus preventing undesired alarm signals that would be triggered, for example,<br>
if a user were to bring one of these objects intentionally out of range of the data carrier<br>
reading means, after establishing by means of the invention that all the desired objects are<br>
present.<br>
The advantage derived according to the measures as claimed in Claims 4 and 8<br>
is that a condition is formulated on the basis of the detected direction of movement, whether<br>
the presence check is to be carried out or not. The term "direction of movement" is to be<br>
understood to mean that even the approach or retreat is regarded as direction information. For<br>
example, a user would like to check on leaving his residence or his office whether he is<br>
carrying all the objects defined in the check group. Conversely, he may not be interested in a<br>
check on entering the residence or the office, because he is intentionally not carrying objects<br>
that are defined in the check group but are not available (or it is too late to collect them).<br>
The advantage derived according to the measures as claimed in Claim 9 is that<br>
the invention can be integrated into existing electronic devices without additional expense.<br>
Mobile telephones and PDAs thus already have Near Field Communication (NFC) reading<br>
devices for noncontact reading-in data carriers that can be used for the invention. Similarly,<br>
these devices have input means (keys etc.) and output means such as indicator tone generator,<br>
displays and vibrators, through which the operation by a user and the output of alarms can be<br>
realized.<br>
These and further aspects of the invention are apparent from and will be<br>
elucidated with reference to the example of embodiment described hereinafter.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will be described in the following with reference to one<br>
example of embodiment represented hi the single Figure, to which embodiment the invention<br>
is not restricted, however.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS<br>
The single figure (Fig. 1) shows a block circuit diagram of a system according<br>
to the invention for checking the presence of objects characterized by noncontact readable<br>
data carriers. By way of example, four objects are shown, viz. an umbrella 1, a ticket 2, a<br>
camera 3 and a notepad 4. Each of these four objects is provided with a noncontact readable<br>
data carrier Tl, T2, T3, T4. Two other data carriers T5, T6 are not allocated to any object. A<br>
requirement for these data carriers Tl to T6 is that they are unambiguously identifiable (e.g.<br>
through a serial number) or at least identifiable in groups (through a group number). The data<br>
carriers Tl to T6 are arranged as RFID tags in this example of embodiment. It may be<br>
observed that the data carriers Tl to T6 have identical design. The advantage that this offers<br>
is that the functions allocated according to the invention to the respective data carriers Tl to<br>
T6 can be interchanged at any time.<br>
The system for checking the presence of objects, as invented, further<br>
comprises a device 10 for checking the presence of objects characterized by noncontact<br>
readable data carriers. This presence check device 10 comprises data carrier reading means 5,<br>
which are arranged to detect the data carriers Tl to T6, if they are within range of the data<br>
carrier reading means 5. The data carrier reading means 5 can, for example, be arranged as a<br>
Near Field Communication (NFC) Device. The data carrier reading means define the identity<br>
of the codes identifying the data carriers detected by them (e.g. serial numbers) in a data<br>
carrier table TL. This table TL is updated with every reading-in routine. Moreover, a check<br>
group t)G is stored in the presence check device 10, which group contains all those data<br>
carriers whose presence is to be checked. In the example of embodiment shown these are the<br>
data carriers Tl to T4, i.e. a check is to be made whether the objects 1 to 4 are present.<br>
Moreover, an activation group AG is stored in the presence check device 10. This group<br>
presently contains the data carriers T4 and TS. According to the invention, detection means 6<br>
are present in the presence check device 10, the function of which detection means being to<br>
check whether at least one of the data carriers currently entered in the data carrier table TL is<br>
a member of the activation group AG. If so, the detection means 6 activate the check means 7<br>
arranged in the presence check device 10. These check means 7 carry out the actual presence<br>
check by comparing whether all data carriers Tl to T4 contained in the check group UG are<br>
also entered in the data carrier table TL; in other words, whether the data carrier reading<br>
means 5 can currently detect all the data carriers Tl to T4 contained in the check group. If<br>
they could not detect them, then the check means 7 transmit an alarm signal AL to the alarm<br>
means 8, to inform the user that one or more of the objects that should actually be present are<br>
missing, whereupon the alarm signal AL can obtain the exact information as to which of the<br>
objects are missing. Depending on the configuration of the alarm means 8 as acoustic, visual<br>
or tactile alarm means, the information to the user can be designed to be a simple buzz tone<br>
up to clear text display about the missing objects. It should be observed that the data carrier<br>
table TL, the check group tJG and the activation group AG can be stored in different areas of<br>
the same physical memory 9. Of course, storage in different memories is also possible.<br>
In the present example of embodiment, when the presence is checked of the<br>
data carriers T4 or T5, the presence would also be checked of the data carriers Tl to T4, or<br>
the presence of the objects associated with them, umbrella 1, ticket 2, camera 3 and notepad<br>
4, as the case may be, is checked at the time of detection. One recognizes from this that the<br>
notepad 4 or the data carrier T4 attached to it, respectively, is a member of the check group<br>
t)G as well as the activation group AG. In this respect this is suitable if also the checking of<br>
the presence of the data carriers Tl to T4 is activated when the data carrier T5 is detected.<br>
The data carrier T5 is a that time not allocated to any object, but it could be placed, for<br>
example, in the passenger compartment of a automobile, such that each time a user carrying<br>
the presence check device 10 on him gets into the automobile, the checking is activated<br>
whether the objects 1 to 4 are also in the automobile. It may further be observed that, though<br>
only one check group UG is shown in the present example of embodiment, mere may be<br>
various check groups which are associated with different activation groups. For example, an<br>
activation group could be defined, which contains only the data carrier T4 and a check group<br>
containing only the data carriers T2 and T3 could be allocated to this activation group, such<br>
that each time the notepad 4 arrives within the detection range of the data carrier reading<br>
means 5, the detection means 6 detect that the associated data carrier T4 is present and in<br>
which activation group the associated data carrier is present and, with the help of the detected<br>
activation group, select a check group and pass the information ZI about the selected check<br>
group on to the check means 7 in addition to the activation signal AS. It may further be<br>
observed that due to the similar construction of the data carriers Tl to T6 the functions of the<br>
data carriers can be interchanged any time i.e. one or more of the data carriers Tl to T3 from<br>
the check group t)G can be deleted and added to the activation group AG in turn. In a similar<br>
manner, the data carrier T5 could be shifted from the activation group AG to the check group<br>
CTG.<br>
As can be seen, the data carrier T6 is then allocated neither to the check group<br>
t)G nor to the activation group AG. With the help of this data carrier T6 it will now be<br>
explained how the inclusion in one of the groups takes place hi preferred manner. Let it be<br>
assumed that the data carrier T6 is to be included in the activation group AG, e.g. so that it<br>
can thus be fixed hi another automobile automobile and is used there for activating the<br>
checking. For this purpose, the data carrier T6 is placed selectively hi the detection range of<br>
the data carrier reading means 5 and the detection means 6 are switched into a mode, by<br>
means of a signal S1 that is triggered by the user, for example, by pressing a key, hi which<br>
mode they add all the data carriers contained hi the data carrier table TL (at that time there is<br>
only the data carrier T6 hi it) to the activation group AG (possible on prior deletion of all<br>
existing entries to the activation group AG). The detection means can also be switched into a<br>
mode by the signal SI in which they add all the data carriers contained hi the data carrier<br>
table TL to the check group CO.<br>
To preclude undesired alarms, a further provision can be made that the<br>
activation signal AS activates the check means 7 only for a short predefined period or for a<br>
one-time check run, hi which run a comparison is made only once for each of the entries<br>
contained in the check group t)G, whether at that time there is a corresponding entry in the<br>
data carrier table TL.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the detection means 6 are arranged to<br>
detect a direction of movement of the data carriers and to active the check means 7 only if the<br>
detected direction of movement lies within a predetermined range. In the simplest case, this<br>
can be realized in such a manner that the detection means 6 cyclically check the data carrier<br>
table TL to detect if a data carrier has been newly entered into or removed from the data<br>
carrier table TL. This makes it possible to recognize approach or retreat of this data carrier to<br>
or from the detection range of the data carrier reading means 5. In a more expensive<br>
embodiment the detection means 6 can assess information through the signal strength<br>
produced by the data carriers or a plurality of data carrier reading means 5 can be provided<br>
whose results are assessed. In yet another embodiment, the detection of a direction of<br>
movement is effected by detection of two data carriers at different times. For example, the<br>
data carrier TS may be attached to a door of a residence and the data carrier T6 (with prior<br>
allocation to the activation group AG) may be arranged further inside the residence. The<br>
detection means 6 in this embodiment are arranged such that after each detection of the two<br>
data carriers T5, T6 they can recognize whether a user is entering or leaving the residence.<br>
The sequence T5 -» T6 means entering the residence, whereas the sequence T6 -&gt; T5 means<br>
leaving the residence. Depending on the sequence, various data carriers Tl to T4 contained in<br>
the check group CFG can be queried i.e. various query profiles can be defined. Similarly, the<br>
alarm signal AL could be triggered only when leaving the residence, if objects are missing,<br>
because only in such a case can the objects be taken away.<br>
The presence check device 10 as invented can be integrated eminently into<br>
portable electronic devices, such as a mobile phone or a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA).<br>
Already now, such devices have Near Field Communication (NFC) reading devices for<br>
noncontact reading-in of data carriers that can be used for the invention. Similarly, these<br>
devices have input means (keys etc.) and output means such as indicator tone generators,<br>
displays and vibrating means, through which the operation by a user and the output of alarms<br>
can be realized.<br><br><br><br><br>
