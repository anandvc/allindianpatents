				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION;<br>
The invention relates to the manufacture of semiconductors and solar<br>
photovoltaics in general and to a gas delivery system for diffusion of<br>
dopant in particular.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Dopant diffusion in silicon using a liquid dopant source is carried out for<br>
the manufacture of silicon solar cells and many other silicon based<br>
semiconductors devices. POCl3 (phosphorus oxy chloride) is the most<br>
commonly used liquid source. In the prior art, the equipment for<br>
automatic and controlled delivery of POCl3 vapours into the diffusion<br>
furnace formed a part of the diffusion furnace itself and was available at<br>
an exorbitant cost. The essential components of the gas delivery system<br>
are the gas manifold with proper design and the automatic controller.<br>
The present invention provides an automatic and simpler gas delivery<br>
system in place of the existing gas line plumbing and automatic<br>
controller of prior art. Moreover the equipment in prior art is largely<br>
imported.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION;<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a gas delivery system, which is<br>
easier to install and maintain.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a gas delivery system, which<br>
is economical.<br><br>
A further object of the invention is to reduce dependence on foreign<br>
suppliers of such equipment.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION;<br>
The automatic gas delivery system for diffusion in silicon using liquid<br>
diffusion source in accordance with the invention, works on the principle<br>
of opening and closing of a set of air-operated valves in a combination of<br>
programmed sequences to allow various gases, namely carrier nitrogen,<br>
dilution nitrogen and oxygen through different routes laid out in a gas<br>
manifold for mixing inside the diffusion furnace for the dopant diffusion<br>
in silicon. The gases are supplied in predetermined sequence and<br>
quantities to ensure optimum delivery and mixing of the gases in the<br>
diffusion furnace.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS;<br>
Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of the automatic controller.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a schematic diagram of the gas manifold according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Table 1 shows the sequence and combination of valve opening in the<br>
diffusion process.<br>
Fig. 3 is a photograph of the automatic gas delivery system for diffusion<br>
in silicon.<br><br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention as depicted in the<br>
accompanying drawings will now be explained in details. However, there<br>
can be several other embodiments, all of which are deemed covered by<br>
this specification.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the control system comprises a programmable logic<br>
controller (PLC) (1.1), a display cum keyboard panel (1.6), a relay card<br>
(1.2) and a manifold of solenoid valves (1.3) actuating a corresponding<br>
set of pneumatic gas valves (1.4) in a gas manifold (2.0). Failure of any of<br>
these results in an audio-visual output for corrective action. Each valve<br>
position has a dedicated toggle switch and an LED to display on/off<br>
status. It enables passage of a variety of process and carrier gases<br>
through different routes for mixing inside the diffusion furnace for the<br>
purpose of dopant diffusion in silicon.<br>
The PLC based controller (1.1) as shown in Fig. 1 consists of the input<br>
port, output port and logic controller. The input port receives signal from<br>
the auto/manual selector switch (1.9) for selection of mode of operation<br>
i.e. manual or semi-auto or auto (1.9), the display cum keyboard panel<br>
(1.6) and safety interlock (1.7). The logic controller generates the output<br>
signal on the basis of preprogrammed sequence of operation and delivers<br>
to the output port. The output signals drive the relay card (1.2), which in<br>
turn switches on or off a set electro-pneumatic solenoid valves (1.3) by<br>
activating the 24 V DC supply (1.5). Accordingly, the corresponding air-<br>
operated valves (1.4) are opened or closed allowing the desired gas<br>
through the gas manifold. Each combination of valve opening is given an<br>
identity i.e. Recipe 1, Recipe 2 etc (Table —1).<br><br>
The safety interlocks (1.7) incorporated in the set up are<br>
1)	over pressure in liquid diffusion source bubbler as indicated by<br>
a pressure switch<br>
2)	recipe 7 not to run before recipe 9<br>
3)	recipe 8 not to run before recipe 9<br>
4)	compressed air failure<br>
5)	exhaust failure<br>
6)	nitrogen gas failure and<br>
7)	oxygen gas failure.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the gas manifold is also fitted with mass flow<br>
controllers (MFC-2.1) .The automation is based on PLC and the software<br>
controlling the sequence of valve operation/ actuation (AVI To AV13)<br>
together with safety interlocks are uploaded to the controller from a PC.<br>
The Controller together with gas manifold allows in a desired manner<br>
introduction of certain gases (carrier nitrogen, dilution nitrogen and<br>
oxygen) in a diffusion furnace that is maintained at a high temperature.<br>
The carrier nitrogen is made to bubble through the liquid diffusion<br>
source (2.2.) and carry its vapours inside the diffusion tube where it<br>
reacts with oxygen to form the necessary solid diffusion source.<br>
The display cum keyboard (1.6) displays the status of operation, on/off<br>
position of the valves, sequence of process, duration and elapsed time of<br>
the current process recipe, safety interlock that hold up the process. It<br>
also enables resulting of process timings as well as change of process<br>
sequence.<br><br>
The controller operates in three different modes i.e. manual, semi-<br>
automatic and fully automatic mode that can be selected from the<br>
auto/manual selector switch (1.9) on front panel. In the manual mode,<br>
the set of valves required for a particular process have to be manually<br>
switched on and after ensuring the correctness of the valves activated,<br>
enabled from the enable switch (3.3) on the front panel.<br><br>
