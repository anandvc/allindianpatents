The invention relates to a low shock ball-lock separation mechanism for separating upper stage and satellites from a space launch vehicle.<br>
Considerable difficulty has been experienced in designing launch vehicle separation mechanism, which will result in the immediate separation of its payload from the launch vehicle. A clean and immediate break between the space vehicle and payload resulting in low shock, free from contamination and flying debris is particularly important to avoid any possible damage to sensitive components.<br>
In the prior art &gt; a series of explosive bolts provided at equally spaced intervals about the periphery of the connecting interface have been, used as a separation device for satellite separation. This arrangement provided a sure method of separating the satellite. However, the problem of detonating each bolt simultaneously to obtain an immediate break and to control the shock induced has never been satisfactorily solved.<br>
Another mechanism utilized for separating satellite from a launch vehicle is that of the expanding tube assembly (XTA), This arrangement also provided a sure way of separating the satellite by the severance of tiie connecting structure. However it has been found practically impossible to control the shock induced,<br><br>
A- series of V shaped blocks mounted over the interface flanges and preloaded by thin bands which are connected by sever able tension bolts have been used as a separation device for satellite separation, This arrangement though provided a sure method of separating the satellite, the problem of applying uniform tension along the circumference for small diameter interfaces and associated shock has never been satisfactorily solved.<br>
The invention provides a mechanism which overcomes the problems discussed above. This is accomplished by locking interface rings by means of balls and keeping them in locked condition by a relatable retainer ring provided with radial holes for the release of balls during separation. The retainer ring is actuated by a pair of thrusters preferably pyrotechnic thrusters. The entire separation technique is dependent only on the actuation of any one of the thrusters thus improving reliability-<br>
Thus the invention provides a low shook ball-look separation mechanism for separating upper stage and satellites of a space launch vehicle, comprising an upper adaptor forming part of the upper stage of the space launch vehicle, the said upper adaptor being provided with an annular groove on its hub to receive a Dortion  of a set of steel balls, a flange having a set of  holes<br><br>
t or   attacking  the  upper stage and  plurality  of  compression fjprings bearing on the surface of the flange to act on the  upper adapter,  a lower adaptor attached to lower stage and having  one portion  mated with the said upper adaptor, a set of steel  balls positioned  in  the holes provided on the hub of the  said  lower adaptor.  a  relatable retainer ring having a lock  position  and release position to keep  the balls in the holes provided on  the    of  the lower adapter in lock position, radial  holes  being provided in the said retainer ring for the escape of balls in the release position, at least a pair of thrusters being provided for rotating the retainer ring with respect to the lower adaptor to a predetermined   position   and   a   mechanical   stopper   being mounted  on  the lower adapter for stoping the  rotation  of  the retainer ring and move the locking balls radically outwards due to the  action  of the compression springs  positioned  between  the flanges  of the upper adapter and lower adapter for forcing  them apart  and  separating the upper stages from the  launch  vehicle upon in 11    of the Fade thrusters .<br>
It is an objective of this invention to provide a .separation mechanism which will facilitate an immediate and even separation of the satellite from a launch vehicle.<br>
Vet   of this invention is to prov3de a separation mechanism for satellites, which will induce extremely low shock while separation.<br><br>
still another objective of this invention is to provide a   mechanism which will induce no contamination or flying debris during separation.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to provide a separation mechanism with releasing means for releasing all the locking points simultaneously to avoid a condition termed "tip off" daring separation.<br>
Another objective of this invention is to provide a separation mechanism for spacecraft separation which is extremely simple in design yet highly reliable.<br>
These and other objectives and advantages of this invention will become more apparent upon reading the specification in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

Fig  4 is a sectional elevation of the ball lock  separation mechanism according to the invention along YY in fig. 3.<br>
Fig.  5  air’s a Judgmental view showing a cross  section  of  a prior art separation mechanism,<br>
The  seperation  mechanism according to the invention  is  a separable  ,joint   similar  in concept to a   bal 1  bearing.   11<br><br>
essentially  consists  of an upper adapter for satellite  and<br><br>
a<br><br>
lower adapter for vehicle mated in a tongue and groove configuration . Tile are yield together by means of balls fjecured in position by a rotatable retainer ring. The balls are radially preloaded between the inner and outer rings which are provided witti annular groove to accommodate tlte balls, The middle ring is provided with number of holes to tiold the balls in position and is axially pre-loaded. The retainer ring has two posit ions, namely a look position and a release position. It is provided with radial holes and when aligned with the balls in the middle r ing ,  <br><br>
transfered  from  the  inner ring to the middle  ring which are<br>
*<br>
attached to the separating masses. The separation of the satellite is achieved by displacement of the outer ring from the lock position to the release position by means of the pyrothrusters. The rotary motion of the retainer ring is restricted by a stopper. Precompressed helical springs positioned in between the flanges of the adapter rings provide the relative velocity during separation. A telescopic spring guide may be used as a strut for preloading the joint.<br>
Referring to fig. 1, only a portion of the upper stage and satellite are illustrated to show the environment in which the separation mechanism is operational. Obviously, the principles could be applied to the separation of any of the various upper stages in a multistage vehicle.<br>
The upper stage (12) of a space vehicle (10) is provided with a pay load deck (14) for mounting auxiliary payloads. The satellite (15) is mounted over the separation mechanism (18) according to the invention in a conventional manner such as bolting.* The integrated assembly is mounted over the payload deck (14) by bolting. The details of the separation mechanism according to the invention are illustrated in figs. 2 to 4.<br><br>
initiated rotate  the retainer ring (20) to its release position.<br>
Helical  compression springs thrusters (26) mounted  between  the<br>
*<br>
upper adapter and lower adapter, provide the relative velocity to the separated stages. The spring thruster (26) which is telescopic is mounted to lower adapter (18) is held captive to the lower stage on separation.<br>
Fig.  5  illustrates  a prior art  arrangement.   The  upper adaptor  (27) mated to the lower adaptor (28)  in a  tongue  and groove  configuration are attached by bolting.  Both the legs  of the upper adaptor are pre-notched to define the severance  plane. Mild delouating cord (MDC) contained within an extruded elastomer matrix  introduced into an elliptically deformed  stainless  tube (29)  is embeded in the groove of the upper adaptor  (27).   Both ends  of  the cords are connected to electrical detonators  (30) through  detonator transfer joints.  Disconnection of the  stages is  achieved  by the severance of the structure  at  the  notched location  due to the expansion of the elleptically deformed  tube (29)  into  a  circular  section by the  detonation  of  the  MDC resultir^g in a shock pulse.<br>
The  operation of the seperation mechanism according to  the invention is as follows,<br><br>
Brior to separation of the satellite, the mechanism is checked to satisfy that it withstands all flight loads and environmental conditions. The satellite is free to separate from the launch vehicle when the retainer ring is rotated. Once the final stage is in orbit, and at the desired orientation, the satellite is ready to be separated from the launch vehicle. This is accomplished by igniting the pressure cartridges  of the pyrothruster (24) thrusting against the lug of the rotatable retainer ring (20) will rotate the retainer ring (20) after shearing the screws (21) and all the balls (19) are released. Due to the spring force available at the interface, the separation is immediate and simultaneous along the entire circumference.<br>
With the locking balls (19) removed, there is nothing to hold together the lower and upper adapters and the satellite is jettisoned. The entire operation takes place in a short Interval of time and with the necssary symmetry, the problem of tip-off is minimised. The rotation of the retainer ring (20) has to overcome only the frictional forces at the ball contact points, and the force required for the failure of shear screws 
 <br>
The  Rftparati on mechanism (16 &gt; consists of an upper  adapter (17&gt; provided with a flange for attachment with the satellite and a  hul» liaving an annular groove to receive a portion of a set  of balls    interfacing with a lower adaper  (18)     The  Jower adapter  tiaving  a i*ub mating with the upper adapter  (17&gt;  in  a tongue  and groove arrangement and a f lange for bolting witti  t Ite payload  iler.di   is provided  with  a number of holes   to locate a set of balls (19).  The  balls (19)  interposed between the upper adapter and lower  adapter  is held in position by a rotatable retainer ring (20 ) ,  The reta ii^er ring (20) has two positions  namely a lock position and a release position.   The retainer ring (20) is provided with radial  holes (20A) for the escape of balls during release.  The retainer  ring 
The retairjer ring v 20 &gt; is rotated through a specified angular displacement and is limited by a stopper (22). The stripper ( 22 &gt; is mounted over the lower adapter ( 18) by bolts (23) and locating pin. A pyrothruster (24) for driving the retainer ring ( 20 &gt; is mounted r»n a l^racket ( 2b &gt; throvjgh threads provided on ttiem . Th*-; bn^ctiet, 1;^ mourt teri over t tie lower adopter ( IB ) by bo ( Is  ( I 3 &gt;  ruirl  1 ».»*;at i?»g  p in .  'I'tic  pyro  thruster  (24)  when<br><br>
The  operation  of the prior art evtbodinent shown in fig.  5 is similar to the embodiment of the separation mechanism shown in figs.  1 to 4.  However* it differs in the manner the  separation is achieved.  The disconnection of the stages is achieved by  the severance  of  the connecting structure by the expansion  of  the elleptically deformed tube into a circular one by the  explosive action  associated  with  high  shock  level.   From  the   above description, it can be seen that this invention has a particular advantage over prior art devices since it provides an arrangement which will allow separation of the stages with little or no  "tip off" and  shock level.  It is further evident that the  structure is  extremely simple in design, with a minimum number  of  moving parts  all of which enhance its reliability.  The  components  of the separation mechanism are designed for ease of assembly.   The separation  structure  is of minimum weight, the  weight  of  the upper stage being further reduced by the method of attachment  of all  components  to  the lower adaptor.   The  operation  of  the separation  mechanism according to the invention is  achieved by the  initiation  of  any one of the  pyrothrusters,  providing  a foolproof arrangement and high reliability.<br>
The bpper adapter and lower adaptor are mated in a tongue and groove ^cint configuration and is axially preloaded to improve the .ioxnt characteristics. Spring thrusters combined with<br><br>
preloading struts maintained between the flanges enhance its load carrying capability.  The retainer ring is radially preloaded and secured  in position by a pair of brass shear screws and is made to  rotate  by  the  action of pyro  thruster  only.   After  the shearing  of the said shear screws the separation of  the  stages occur.  The rotation of the retainer ring by the action of a pair of pyro thrusters is achieved by initiation of any one of  them. All  components mounted on the lower adaptor  ring  automatically falls upon  separation  of  the upper  and  lower  stages,  thus reducing  the mass carried on the upper stage.   The rotation  of the retainer ring is capable of effecting simultaneous relase  of all  balls  thus effecting a clean separation of  the  satellite. The  separation  is  achieved  with all  the  balls  and  sheared portion of the shear screw fully contained thus making the system free from flying debris and contamination.    The rotation of the retainer ring has to overcome only the  frictional forces and the force  required to shear the shear screws.  Therefore the  energy released  by  the  system  on  separation  is  considerably  less resulting in a low shock.<br>
The low shock ball-look separation mechanism according to the invention provides excellent results when used in launch vehicles.<br><br><br><br><br>
