				<td>The invention relates to a method for machining material in accordance with the preamble of patent claim 1 and to a material-machining device in accordance with the preamble of patent claim 4.<br>
Prior art<br>
Material machining using laser radiation is used in a very wide variety of ways for cutting, boring, welding, marking and generally for removing material. To make it possible to commence removal of material, a predetermined intensity of the radiation has to be reached on the material surface which is to be machined. This high radiation intensity used to be achieved by focusing the laser radiation at the focal point. However, a drawback of this technique is the small axial extent of the focal point (beam width) in which this high intensity was reached. If deep cuts or holes are to be made, the location of the focal point had to be maintained with a very high level of accuracy or even tracked. The beam tapers conically toward the focal point, meaning that particularly in the case of deep cuts, starting on the surface it was always necessary to remove sufficient amounts of material for the conical beam to be able to reach the machining location. However, deep cuts or holes always have to be made with inclined side walls.<br>
To avoid having to track the focal point and to be able to make narrow cuts and holes with approximately vertical side walls, it has been proposed in US-A 5 773 791, EP-A 0 515 983, DE-A 36 43 284 and WO 95/32834, to inject laser radiation into a liquid jet, as a light conductor, which is directed on to the workpiece to be machined.<br>
In DE-A 36 43 284, the laser radiation was supplied by means of a glass fiber. The end of this<br><br>
glass fiber had a water jet which was directed onto the workpiece to be machined flowing around it. The known device had the drawback that the diameter of the water jet was never allowed to be smaller than that in the glass fiber carrying the laser radiation. A further drawback resulted from a region of dead water beneath the end of the glass fiber, causing, among other things, disturbances in the water jet flow and ultimately leading to this jet rapidly breaking down into drops.<br>
EP-A 0 515 983 has attempted to avoid these drawbacks by designing an optics unit with a nozzle block which shapes the water jet. Upstream of the nozzle which shapes the water jet was a water retention chamber having a water inlet and a focusing lens, which closes off the chamber from the nozzle entry, for focusing the laser radiation. The location and focal length of the focusing lens were selected in such a manner that the focal point of the laser radiation was located in the axial center inside the nozzle channel. In operation during machining, it has been found that the nozzle was very quickly damaged by the laser radiation, and consequently the shaping of the radiation was no longer perfect.<br>
An improvement to the way in which the laser beam is injected into the liquid jet was made in WO 95/32834, in which the focal point of the laser radiation to be injected was placed in the plane of the nozzle opening and the water retention chamber in front of the nozzle opening was eliminated. The nozzle which shapes the liquid jet is in this case positioned in a liquid supply space which extends radially with respect to the nozzle axis and into which a plurality of coaxially distributed, axial liquid channels open out. Even with this arrangement, the nozzle was damaged during operation for the machining of material.<br><br>
object of the invention<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a method for machining the material and a material-machining device having a laser beam which is injected into a liquid jet, which method and device ensure that material can be machined over a prolonged running time. Interruption in machining is to occur only at predetermined service intervals. There should be no possibility of unforeseeable interruption, in particular caused by damage to the nozzle block which shapes the liquid jet.<br>
Solution to the object<br>
The solution to the object for the process according to the invention is described by the features of patent claim 1 and for the material-machining device according to the invention is described by the features of patent claim 4.<br>
According to the invention, it is ensured that, on the one hand, the radiation to be injected into the liquid jet is focused into the nozzle entry plane of the nozzle channel which shapes the liquid, and the liquid is supplied to the nozzle entry flowing at a high velocity (without liquid retention spaces) and without turbulence. These three requirements together are satisfied by a corresponding design of an optics unit as described below.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention<br>
Examples  of  the  process  according  to	the<br>
invention and the device according to the invention	are<br>
explained in more  detail  below with  reference	to<br>
figures.  Further  advantages  of  the  invention  will<br>
emerge from the following descriptive text.  In	the<br>
drawing:<br><br>
Fig. 1 shows a cross section through an optics unit of the material machining device according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a longitudinal section through the optics unit illustrated in Figure 1, with an enlarged view of the liquid feeds to the nozzle block which shapes the liquid jet,<br><br>
Fig. 3 shows a longitudinal section through the nozzle block which is illustrated in Figure 2 and is held in a nozzle mount,<br>
Fig. 4 shows a cross section on line IV - IV in Figure 2,   and<br>
Fig. 5 shows an enlarged view of the illustration in Figure 3, showing in particular the generation and guidance of the liquid jet in the nozzle channel.<br>
The optics unit 1,  which is illustrated in cross section in Figure 1, of the material-machining device according to the invention is connected to a laser  radiation  source  6 by means  of  a  radiation conductor 3 via a radiation conductor connector 5. The radiation source 6 is only diagrammatically illustrated in this figure. It is a high-power laser, such as a Nd:YAG laser.  The  radiation  7  emerging  from  the radiation conductor 3 in the connector 5 is collimated by means of a collimator 9 to form a beam 10. The beam 10 is guided to a beam-expanding unit 11. The beam-expanding unit 11 can be used to change, i.e. expand, the diameter of the beam 10 which enters it to that of the beam 13 which emerges from it. A diameter factor of from two to eight is envisaged for the beam expansion. This expanding ratio makes it possible to vary the beam width 15 (diameter of the focal point) of the laser beam 13 which is described below. The beam-expanding factor of the beam expanding unit can be changed by motor means through signals of an adjustment unit which is not shown ("motorized beam expander"). The expanded beam 13 is then deflected through 90° by a deflecting mirror 17 and is diverted onto focusing optics 23 as focusing unit by means of a further deflecting mirror 21 which has an adjustment unit 19. The way in which  the  adjustment  unit  19  operates  and  is  used  is described below.<br><br>
It should be pointed out that the theoretical focal point of the focusing optic 23 does not necessarily have to coincide with the beam width 15 of the focused laser beam 13. A deviation of both locations results from beam divergence of the laser beam 13, which can be influenced, inter alia, by the beam-expanding unit 11.<br>
A nozzle block 27 having a nozzle channel 29 is used to shape a liquid jet 25. The focusing optic 23 and the beam-expanding unit 11 are adjusted or arranged in such a manner that the beam width 15 of the focused beam 13 comes to lie in the nozzle-channel entry plane 30 of the nozzle-channel opening 28. The nozzle-channel entry plane 30 continues on both sides into the surface of the nozzle block 27. Figures 2 to 5 show the area immediately surrounding the entry to the nozzle channel 29 which shapes the liquid jet. Figure 3 shows the nozzle block 27 on an even larger scale than Figure 2. The nozzle channel 29 is of cylindrical design. The nozzle block 27 is made from a material which is transparent to the laser radiation (in this case with a wavelength of 1.06 μm) and is mechanically hard, such as for example quartz. However, since it is extremely small, it may also consist of diamond. Compared to a nozzle block 27 made from quartz, a nozzle block 27 made from diamond has a longer service life, the end of the service life making itself obvious through a liquid jet 25 which breaks up even after a short liquid jet length.<br>
The nozzle block does not necessarily have to consist of a material which is transparent to the laser radiation in order to utilize the conditions of total reflection against the nozzle-channel wall. It may also consist of a material which is not transparent and absorbs radiation, provided that the nozzle-channel wall is provided with a coating which reflects the laser radiation and should be able to resist abrasion from the liquid jet. In the case of a nozzle block<br><br>
material which is not transparent, the nozzle surface should also have a reflective coating (to protect against adjustment errors), and so should the underside of the nozzle block (to protect against radiation which is thrown back onto the workpiece from the workpiece of the cloud of plasma)..<br>
The nozzle block 27 illustrated in Figure 3 has a planar surface 30 to which the axis 32 of the nozzle channel 2 9 runs perpendicular.  The edge 31 at the nozzle-channel opening 28 between the surface 30 and the  channel  wall  is  of  sharp-edged  design  and preferably has a radius of less than 5 μm.   This rounded edge 31 is one of further preconditions, which are described below,  for generating a liquid jet 25 of great  length.  This  is  because  it  suppresses  the formation of turbulence in the liquid. The nozzle block 27 is inserted into a nozzle mount 33. The transition 34 between nozzle mount 33 and nozzle block 27 is designed  in  such a manner  that  there  is  no  step present. A step would likewise generate turbulence in the liquid, and this would propagate into the liquid jet 25 shapeed with the nozzle channel 29. The nozzle block  27  illustrated in  Figure  3 has  an  external diameter of 2 mm and a height of 0.9 mm. A nozzle block of this order of magnitude can be manufactured from a diamond at acceptable cost.<br>
As has already been stated above, the nozzle channel 29 which shapes the liquid jet is of cylindrical design, in this case, for example, with a diameter of 150 μm and a length of approximately 300 μm. The length of the nozzle channel 29 should be no greater than twice the diameter of the nozzle channel. The exit of the nozzle channel 29 is adjoined by a conically expanded opening 26. The cone apex angle is in this case eighty degrees. The inner lateral surface 35 of this cone merges continuously into the nozzle mount 33.<br><br>
The conical design of the inner lateral surface 35 makes it easier to apply a reflective coating, does not interfere with the liquid jet in any way and, on account of its inclination, intensifies the reflection for any radiation which emerges from the liquid jet 25 on account of mechanical inhomogeneities (shock wave, contaminations which have passed through despite filtering ...) . The cone angle is selected to be sufficiently great for radiation which emerges from the liquid jet not to impinge thereon at all or to impinge thereon at only a very shallow angle.<br>
The liquid is supplied to the nozzle channel 29 via a narrow, disk-like inner space 36, the height of which corresponds to approximately half the diameter of the nozzle channel 29. The diameter of the inner space 36 corresponds to the diameter of the nozzle mount 33. Twenty feed lines 37, which are round in cross section and the adjacent side walls of which merge into one another as they enter the inner space 36, .open into this  inner  space  36  in  a  star-shaped  arrangement radially with respect to the axis 32 of the nozzle channel 29.  This arrangement of the feed lines 37 promotes turbulence-free (radial) supply of liquid to the nozzle channel 27. A pressure-reducing filter 39 is arranged at the entry side of the feed lines 37. This filter 39 is adjoined by an annular space 40 which is supplied with liquid via a supply line 41. The filter 39 is used to generate a uniform liquid pressure in the twenty feed lines 37, resulting in a symmetrical flow of liquid to the nozzle entry. Since the supply line 41 is on only one side, without filter 39 the feed lines 37 adjacent to the supply line 41 would be at a higher pressure than those lying opposite the supply line. Consequently,  it  is  impossible  for  tangential  flow components to form in the region of the nozzle-channel opening 28. To allow the laser radiation to reach the nozzle-entry opening, the disk-like inner space 36 is<br><br>
covered in a liquid-tight manner by a cover 43 which is transparent to the laser radiation used.<br>
The low height of the inner space 36 provides a high flow velocity of the liquid. Due to the high flow velocity,  there is no  (or a considerably reduced) possibility of the liquid being heated in the focusing cone 38 by the laser radiation passing through it. On account of the design described above, the disk-like inner space 36 is such that it is impossible,  in particular in the radiation-focusing cone 38 of the laser radiation, for a liquid retention space, which would preferentially promote the formation of a thermal lens through radiation absorption, to form. A thermal lens would make perfect, stable focusing of the laser beam into the center (axis 32) of the nozzle-channel opening 28 impossible. The presence of a thermal lens would  cause  the  focusing  of  the  radiation  to deteriorate, since the thermal lens acts as a diverging lens. The laser radiation would impinge on the edge of the opening of the nozzle and/or the nozzle surface and would therefore damage the nozzle. Furthermore,  the thermal lens formed as a result of the liquid heating would not have a stable location. The radiation would no longer be optimally injected into the liquid jet 25. On  account  of  the  star-shaped   (radial) arrangement of the feed 37, a pressure-reducing filter 39 between the entry to the feeds 37 and the annular space 40, a continuous transition 34 in the flow region of the liquid between nozzle block 27 and nozzle mount 33, and the small rounding (radius &gt;5 μm) of the edge 31 where the liquid enters the nozzle, for the first time turbulence-free flow is achieved as a precondition for a liquid jet 25 of great length.  Furthermore, degassing of the liquid and removal of particles from the liquid have a positive effect on the production of a great jet length. It should also be ensured that the supply of liquid is free of pressure pulses. This is because the cylindrical shape of the free liquid jet is<br><br>
unstable. On account of its surface tension, the liquid seeks to change into a different shape, namely that of a bail. Therefore, after a certain spreading length, the jet of liquid breaks down into individual drops. An infinitesimally small radial disturbance in the liquid jet during its shaping becomes rapidly more intensive, so that the jet may become constricted, causing it to break up into drops. The air surrounding the jet which is entrained by friction additionally increases this effect. A liquid jet of great length can only be produced by the measures listed above for creating a liquid supply which is free from disturbance.<br>
Furthermore,  it has surprisingly been found that, when the liquid jet 25 impinges on an as yet unmachined workpiece surface, a shock wave begins to rise upward in the jet. This shock wave means that the flow of liquid is no longer laminar and some of the laser radiation which has been injected into the liquid jet 25 at the entry to the nozzle opening emerges from the liquid jet 25 on account of irregularities on the lateral surface of the liquid jet caused by the shock wave.  This emerging radiation would then come into contact with the nozzle block 27, would pass through the latter and would then be thrown onto the metal wall of the nozzle mount 33. Then, the radiation would be absorbed on this wall causing local heating. This could lead to the material of the nozzle mount 33 melting or vaporizing,  which would lead to destruction of the nozzle mount 33 and the nozzle block 27. To prevent this from happening, the inner wall 35 is of conical design and is provided with a reflective coating. The laser radiation emerging on account of irregularities in the lateral surface of the liquid jet is therefore reflected by this coating and cannot penetrate through the nozzle block 27 to the absorbent material. Once the workpiece 4 5 has been bored or cut through, there are no shock waves or only shock waves with a minimal energy formed.<br><br>
The nozzle block 27 although having a long life in the arrangement described here, is arranged so that it can easily be exchanged. To exchange the nozzle block, it is merely necessary to unscrew an insert 46.<br>
To check that a seal is produced, the insert 4 8 accommodating the transparent cover 43 has a groove 54 which runs around its outer lateral surface and opens into a monitoring bore 50. If there is liquid in the monitoring bore 50, the sealing ring 58a has lost its seal. If the sealing ring 58b were then also to lose its seal, liquid could reach the surface 60 of the transparent cover 43, which would considerably impair the focusing and guidance of the laser beam. To avoid this, the sealing rings 58a and 58b are exchanged whenever liquid is registered in the monitoring bore 50.<br>
A force sensor 47 is arranged beneath the workpiece 45 which is to be machined. The position of the force sensor 47 is selected in such a manner that it emits a maximum electrical signal to a control device 49 when the liquid jet 25 is fully impinging on it (without any deflection) . The force sensor 47 is arranged in the geometric axis 32 of the liquid jet 25. If the liquid jet 25 with the laser beam which has been  injected into it impinges on a workpiece 45 which has not yet been machined, there is no signal, since the jet 25 first has to bore through the workpiece 45. If the workpiece 45 has already been bored through or if there is an initial cut through which the jet 25 is passing, the jet 25 impinges on the slot side wall or bored hole wall when the workpiece 45 is moving. In this case, still only part of the jet 25 impinges on the force sensor 47. The signal emitted to the control device 4 9 is lower than if the full beam 25 were impinging on it. Therefore, the amount of material which has been removed can be determined by means of the force sensor 47.<br><br>
The control device 4 9 is also connected to a displacement  device  for  the  workpiece  45.  The displacement device is only diagrammatically indicated in Figure 1 by two double arrows in the horizontal directions x and y 51a and 51b, intending to indicate that displacement is possible in one plane and two dimensions. Now, depending on the value determined by the force sensor 47, the control device 49 controls the displacement speed of the workpiece 4 5 according to a predetermined cutting pattern in the two directions 51a and 51b. The advance of the workpiece 45 which is to be machined can therefore be regulated and optimized in terms of energy by means of the force sensor 47 in that the workpiece  45  is  displaced whenever  sufficient amounts of material have been removed.<br>
The control device 4 9 is also connected to the radiation source 6. Therefore, the laser output power can also be adjusted as a function of the measured value from the force sensor and the workpiece displacement velocity. If, in the case of a pulsed laser, by way of example a stepper mode is used for workpiece displacement, the laser emits a plurality of pulses at one location before the workpiece 45 is moved one step onward. The stepper mode may, for example, take place with a step sequence frequency of 100 Hz.<br>
In addition to the guidance of the laser beam which has already been explained above, the optics unit 1, as can be seen from Figure 1, also has means for optimum adjustment and monitoring of the position of the laser beam width (focal point of the radiation), with respect to the nozzle entry opening or the axis 32 of the nozzle channel 29. For this purpose, the radiation 52 from a white light source 53 is superimposed congruently on the expanded laser beam 13. This is carried out by means of the deflecting mirror 17. The deflecting mirror 17 fully reflects the laser radiation but transmits the white light radiation 52 from the white light source 53 behind it. The radiation<br><br>
from the source 53, together with the laser radiation, is guided via the deflecting mirror 21 into the focusing unit 23 and, given correct optical orientation in the nozzle entry plane 30, is focused at the location of the axis 32. The deflecting mirror 21 is designed to partially transmit the white light radiation 52.<br>
To check the correct beam adjustment, only the radiation from the source 53 is used without a laser beam. If there is any incorrect adjustment, the white light radiation which has been focused by means of the focusing unit 23, illuminates the nozzle edge 31 or the area surrounding it. The surface area surrounding the nozzle-entry opening is observed by means of a video camera 55 via a telescope 56 and the deflecting mirror 21, which partially transmits the white light radiation. As it passes through the deflecting mirror 21, on account of the thickness of the latter, the white light undergoes beam displacement. This beam displacement is corrected by a plane-parallel glass sheet 57.<br>
The deflecting mirror 21 can be tilted by an adjustment unit 19. The adjustment elements are then used to tilt the deflecting mirror 21 in such a manner that the focal point of the white light beam comes to lie symmetrically with respect to the location of the channel axis 32.<br>
To achieve this, the procedure is as follows: the deflecting mirror 21 is tilted until radiation reflection can be determined at the nozzle-channel edge 31, and is then tilted in the opposite direction, while measuring the tilting angle (~ displacement distance of the beam on the nozzle-channel opening) until radiation reflection of the same reflected intensity can also be determined on the opposite nozzle-channel edge 31, and this is followed by a further movement involving tilting back by half the tilting angle. The focal point is then in a plane which includes the nozzle-channel<br><br>
axis 32. For alignment onto the location of the channel axis 32, a further, similar adjustment of the beam axis is then carried out perpendicular to the previous direction of tilting.<br>
The white light source 53 can be dispensed with if  the  deflecting • mirror  21  is  made  slightly transparent (approximately 2%) for the radiation of the laser source 6. In this case too, the telescope and the glass sheet 57 have to be designed for the laser radiation and provided with an antireflective coating. The video camera 55 must be provided with a chip which is sensitive to the laser radiation. In this case, in the event of incorrect adjustment, the laser radiation is reflected from the nozzle edge or its surrounding region. The reflected radiation is then observed by the video camera 55 via the telescope and an adjustment is performed via the adjustment unit 19 described above and the beam-expanding unit 11. To prevent damage to the  nozzle  channel  and  the  nozzle  surface,  the adjustment is carried out with reduced laser power. Since  the  laser  beam  properties  at  high  beam intensities may change compared to  those  at  lower power, the adjustment of the deflecting mirror 21 and if  appropriate  of  the  beam-expanding  unit  11  is commenced with a continuous  increase in the laser power.<br>
To check the central setting, the output lens of the beam-expanding unit 11 can then be adjusted in such a manner that the diameter of the beam width of the laser beam 13 is increased until the nozzle-channel edge 31 (i.e. the nozzle-channel opening 28) is uniformly illuminated. Only if illumination is uniform has central alignment been achieved beforehand. The output lens of the beam-expanding unit 11 is then displaced in the opposite direction until uniform illumination of the nozzle-opening edge once again occurs. The position between these two settings then provides optimum focusing onto the nozzle-channel entry<br><br>
plane with the focused beam lying symmetrically with respect to the channel axis 32.<br>
If a Nd:YAG laser is used, the liquid used for the liquid jet may be water. Water exhibits low radiation absorption at 1.06 |im. However, this low  absorption may be sufficient for the formation of thermal lenses in front of the nozzle entry. Therefore, for certain applications it is preferable to use a silicone oil in particular selected from the group of polymethylsiloxanes.<br>
If  the  liquid  used  is  water,  the  laser radiation used should have an absorption of less than 0.2 cm-1 preferably of less than 0.15 cm1. If radiation with higher absorption is used,  too much radiation power is aborbed in the liquid jet. High levels of radiation  absorption  in  the  liquid  may  lead  to evaporation effects. It is then also impossible, for example, to sufficiently suppress the formation of the thermal lens in the focal point ahead of the nozzle entry even with optimized flow. Low absorption levels with water used as the liquid result at radiations in the wavelength range from 150 nm to 1100 nm, preferably from 190 nm to 920 nm and between 1040 nm and 1080 nm (there is an absorption peak, in the range around 1000 nm) . Therefore, it is preferably possible to use diode lasers, YAG lasers, frequency-doubled YAG lasers, excimer lasers and copper vapor lasers. A YAG laser has the   advantage,   for   example,   that   developed, commercially available units are available; they are also able to achieve high mean powers.<br>
The radiation may be continuous or pulsed. In the case of pulsed radiation, the liquid can cool cut edges produced using the process explained above. Heat generated by absorbed radiation in the liquid jet is also dissipated. Therefore, since water has a very high heat absorption capacity, it is possible for high radiation powers to be injected into the liquid jet in pulsed fashion. If a Nd:YAG laser and water as the<br><br>
liquid are used, up to 20 kW pulsed power can be injected with pulse lengths of some 20 to 500 μs, a mean power of 600 W and a pulse rate of up to 5 kHz.<br>
However, it is also possible to use Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers with pulse lengths of typically 50 to 250 ns with a mean power of 20 to 120 W and a pulse rate of up to 60 kHz. It is also possible to use mode-coupled lasers with pulse lengths in the femtosecond range.<br>
Continuously emitting lasers (e.g. cw YAG) can also be used. In this case, however, the mean power is limited by the lack of interruption to the radiation. It is then only possible to inject approximately 700 W radiation power from an NdrYAG laser into a water jet which is 80 μm thick. At higher laser power densities, the water would be heated to such an extent by the radiation absorption that evaporation would commence beyond a certain jet length. Consequently, the jet would begin to break up into drops; perfect beam guidance would no longer be possible.<br>
The nozzle block 27 described above was produced from quartz or diamond, i.e. from a material which is transparent to the laser radiation. The nozzle exit and the adjoining wall of the nozzle mount 33 were of conical design and were provided with a reflective coating for the laser radiation. It is then also possible to produce the nozzle block 27 from a material which is highly reflective for the laser radiation. For laser radiation of 1.06 μm, it is possible to use a nozzle block made from gold. Since pure gold is too soft, traces of copper and silver have to be added in order to reach a hardness of some 150 to 225 HV.<br><br><br>
