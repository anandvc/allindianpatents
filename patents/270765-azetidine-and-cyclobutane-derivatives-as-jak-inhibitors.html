(See section 10, rule 13)<br>
"AZETIDINE AND CYCLOBUTANE DERIVATIVES AS JAK<br>
INHIBITORS"<br>
INCYTE CORPORATION, a corporation of the State of Delaware, United States of America, having a principal place of business at Experimental Station Building 336, Route 141 &amp; Henry Clay Road, City of Wilmington, State of Delaware, United States of America.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
AZETIDINE AND CYCLOBUTANE DERIVATIVES AS JAK INHIBITORS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to azetidine and cyclobutane derivatives, as well as their compositions and methods of use and preparation, which are JAK inhibitors useful in the treatment of JAK-associated diseases including, for example, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, as well as cancer.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Protein kinases (PKs) are a group of enzymes that regulate diverse, important biological processes including cell growth, survival and differentiation, organ formation and morphogenesis, neovascularization, tissue repair and regeneration, among others. Protein kinases exert their physiological functions through catalyzing the phosphorylation of proteins (or substrates) and thereby modulating the cellular activities of the substrates in various biological contexts. In addition to the functions in normal tissues/organs, many protein kinases also play more specialized roles in a host of human diseases including cancer. A subset of protein kinases (also referred to as oncogenic protein kinases), when dysregulated, can cause tumor formation and growth, and further contribute to tumor maintenance and progression. Thus far, oncogenic protein kinases represent one of the largest and most attractive groups of protein targets for cancer intervention and drug development.<br>
The Janus Kinase (JAK) family plays a role in the cytokine-dependent regulation of proliferation and function of cells involved in immune response. Currently, there are four known mammalian JAK family members: JAKI (also known as Janus kinase-1), JAK2 (also known as Janus kinase-2), JAK3 (also known as Janus kinase, leukocyte; JAKL; L-JAK and Janus kinase-3) and TYK2 (also known as protein-tyrosine kinase 2). The JAK proteins range in size from 120 to 140 kDa and comprise seven conserved JAK homology (JH) domains; one of these is a functional catalytic kinase domain, and another is a pseudokinase domain potentially serving a regulatory function and/or serving as a docking site for STATs.<br>
Blocking signal transduction at the level of the JAK kinases holds promise for developing treatments for inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, myeloproliferative<br><br>
diseases, and human cancers, to name a few. Inhibition of the JAK kinases is also envisioned to have therapeutic benefits in patients suffering from skin immune disorders such as psoriasis, and skin sensitization. Accordingly, inhibitors of Janus kinases or related kinases are widely sought and several publications report effective classes of compounds. For example, certain JAK inhibitors, including pyrrolopyridine and pyrrolopyrimidines, are reported in U.S. Sen No. 11/637,545, filed December 12, 2006.<br>
Thus, new or improved agents which inhibit kinases such as Janus kinases are continually needed for developing new and more effective pharmaceuticals to treat cancer and other diseases. The compounds and processes described herein are directed toward these needs and other ends.<br>

The compounds described herein can be asymmetric (e.g., having one or more stcrcoccnters). All stereoisomers, such as enantiomers and diastereomers, are intended unless otherwise indicated. Compounds of the present invention that contain asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms can be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. Methods on how to prepare optically active forms from optically active starting materials are known in the art, such as by resolution of racemic mixtures or by stereoselective synthesis. Many geometric isomers of olefins, ON double bonds, and the like can also be present in the compounds described herein, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present<br><br>
invention. Cis and trans geometric isomers of the compounds of the present invention are described and may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated isomeric forms.  Where a compound capable of stereoisomerism or geometric isomerism is designated in its structure or name without reference to specific R/S or cis/lrans configurations, it is intended that all such isomers arc contemplated.<br>
Resolution of racemic mixtures of compounds can be carried out by any of numerous methods known in the art. An example method includes fractional recrystallizaion using a chiral resolving acid which is an optically active, salt-forming organic acid. Suitable resolving agents for fractional recrystallization methods are, for example, optically active acids, such as the D and L forms of tartaric acid, diacetyltartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, mandelic acid, malic acid, lactic acid or the various optically active camphorsulfonic acids such as p-camphorsulfonic acid. Other resolving agents suitable for fractional crystallization methods include stcreoisomerically pure forms of a-methylbenzylamine (e.g., S and R forms, or diastereomerically pure forms), 2-phenylglycinol, norephedrine, ephedrine, N-methylephedrine, cyclohexylethylamine, 1,2-diaminocyclohexane, and the like.<br>
Resolution of racemic mixtures can also be carried out by elution on a column packed with an optically active resolving agent (e.g., dinitrobenzoylphenylglycine). Suitable elution solvent composition can be determined by one skilled in the art.<br>
Compounds of the invention also include tautomeric forms. Tautomeric forms result from the swapping of a single bond with an adjacent double bond together with the concomitant migration of a proton. Tautomeric forms include prototropic tautomers which are isomeric protonation states having the same empirical formula and total charge. Example prototropic tautomers include ketone - enol pairs, amide - imidic acid pairs, lactam - lactim pairs, amide - imidic acid pairs, enamine - imine pairs, and annular forms where a proton can occupy two or more positions of a heterocyclic system, for example, 1H- and 3H-imidazole, III-, 211- and 4H- 1,2,4-triazole, IH- and 2H- isoindole, and 1H- and 2H-pyrazole. Tautomeric forms can be in equilibrium or sterically locked into one form by appropriate substitution.<br>
Compounds of the invention further include hydrates and solvates, as well as anhydrous and non-solvated forms.<br>
The term, "compound," as used herein is meant to include all stereoisomers, geometric iosomers, tautomers, and isotopes of the structures depicted.<br><br>
All compounds, and pharmaceuticaly acceptable salts thereof, can be found together with other substances such as water and solvents (e.g. hydrates and solvates) or can be isolated.<br>
Compounds of the invention can also include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the intermediates or final compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. For example, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium.<br>
In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention, and salts thereof, are substantially isolated. By "substantially isolated" is meant that the compound is at least partially or substantially separated from the environment in which it was formed or detected. Partial separation can include, for example, a composition enriched in the compound of the invention. Substantial separation can include compositions containing at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 97%, or at least about 99% by weight of the compound of the invention, or salt thereof. Methods for isolating compounds and their salts are routine in the art.<br>
The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.<br>
The expressions, "ambient temperature" and "room temperature," as used herein, are understood in the art, and refer generally to a temperature, e.g. a reaction temperature, that is about the temperature of the room in which the reaction is carried out, for example, a temperature from about 20 °C to about 30 °C.<br>
The present invention also includes pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described herein. As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by converting an existing acid or base moiety to its salt form. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids; and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention include the conventional non-toxic salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by<br><br>
conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile (ACN) are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1985, p. 1418 and Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 66, 2 (1977), each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Synthesis<br>
Compounds of the invention, including salts thereof, can be prepared using known organic synthesis techniques and can be synthesized according to any of numerous possible synthetic routes.<br>
The reactions for preparing compounds of the invention can be carried out in suitable solvents which can be readily selected by one of skill in the art of organic synthesis. Suitable solvents can be substantially non-reactive with the starting materials (reactants), the intermediates, or products at the temperatures at which the reactions are carried out, e.g., temperatures which can range from the solvent's freezing temperature to the solvent's boiling temperature. A given reaction can be carried out in one solvent or a mixture of more than one solvent. Depending on the particular reaction step, suitable solvents for a particular reaction step can be selected by the skilled artisan.<br>
Preparation of compounds of the invention can involve the protection and deprotection of various chemical groups. The need for protection and deprotection, and the selection of appropriate protecting groups, can be readily determined by one skilled in the art. The chemistry of protecting groups can be found, for example, in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3'  Ed., Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York (1999), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Reactions can be monitored according to any suitable method known in the art. For example, product formation can be monitored by spectroscopic means, such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (e.g., lH or l3C), infrared spectroscopy, spectrophotometry (e.g., UV-visible), mass spectrometry, or by chromatographic methods such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or thin layer chromatography (TLC).<br>

The JAK inhibitors described herein, as well as other JAK inhibitors capable of influencing IL-6/STAT3 signalling, can further be used to treat inflammation-associated proliferative diseases. Inflammation has been shown to be linked to the development of certain types of cancers. For example, patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis have been shown to have a much higher risk of developing colorectal cancer. These types of inflammation-linked cancers have been termed colitis-associated cancer (CAC). Several studies have shown that the IL-6/STAT3 signaling is involved in promoting CAC. For example, mice deficient in STAT3 intestinal epithelial cells had decreased tumor size and incidence in an animal model of CAC. Bromberg, et al., 'Inflammation and cancer: IL-6 and STAT3 complete the link", Cancer Cell, 15:79-80 (2009). Similar results were obtained with IL-6 deficient mice, which developed fewer and smaller adenomas than wild-type mice. Grivennikov, et al., "IL-6 and STAT3 are required for survival of intestinal epithelial cells and the development of colitis-associated cancer", Cancer Cell, 15:103-11 I (2009). See also, Bollrath, et al., "gp!30-Mediated STAT3 activation in entcrocytes rcgulatrcs cell survival and cell-cycle progression during colitis-associated tumorigenesis", Cancer Cell, 15:91-102 (2009); and Kortylewski, et al., "Regulation of the IL-23 and 1L-12 balance by Stat3 signaling in the tumor microcnvironmenl", Cancer Cell, 15:114-123 (2009).<br>
Accordingly, in some embodiments, JAK inhibitors of the invention and those which influence IL-6/STAT3 signaling, can be used to treat inflammation-associated cancers. In some embodiments, the cancer is associated with inflammatory bowel disease. In some embodiments, the inflammatory bowel disease is ulcerative colitis. In some embodiments, the inflammatory bowel disease is Crohn's disease. In some embodiments, the inflammation-associated cancer is colitis-associated cancer. In some embodiments, the inflammation-associated cancer is colon cancer or colorectal cancer. In some embodiments, the cancer is gastric cancer, gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor, gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), adenocarcinoma, small intestine cancer, or rectal cancer. In addition to the compounds<br><br><br>
provided herein, example JAK inhibitors that can be used in the treatment of inflammation-associated cancers include those described in US 2006/0106020; US 2006/0183906; US 2007/0149506; US 2007/0135461; US 2008/0188500; US 2008/0312258; US 2008/0312259; and U.S. Scr. No. 12/270,135.<br>
JAK inhibitors can be tested in animal models for potential efficacy in treating inflammation-associated cancers. For example, CAC can be induced in treated (e.g., with JAK inhibitors) or untreated mice by the method summarized in Grivennikov, et al., "IL-6 and STAT3 are required for survival of intestinal epithelial cells and the development of colitis-associated cancer", Cancer Cell, 15:103-111 (2009). Progression of the disease can be followed by measuring body weight and monitoring for signs of rectal bleeding and diarrhea. After sacrifice of the animals, portions of the distal colon are removed for analysis.<br>
In some embodiments, the JAK inhibitors described herein can further be used to treat a dry eye disorder. As used herein, "dry eye disorder" is intended to encompass the disease states summarized in a recent official report of the Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS), which defined dry eye as "a multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface that results in symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface. It is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and inflammation of the ocular surface." Lemp, "The Definition and Classification of Dry Eye Disease: Report of the Definition and Classification Subcommittee of the International Dry Eye Workshop", The Ocular Surface, 5(2), 75-92 April 2007, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Dry eye is also sometimes referred to as keratoconjunctivitis sicca. In some embodiments, the treatment of the dry eye disorder involves ameliorating a particular symptom of dry eye disorder, such as eye discomfort, visual disturbance, tear film instability, tear hyperosmolarity, and inflammation of the ocular surface.<br>
As summarized in the DEWS report, dry eye can be classified into two different classes: aqueous tear-deficient dry eye and evaporative dry eye, which in turn encompass various subclasses. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the dry eye disorder is aqueous tear-deficient dry eye (ADDE). In further embodiments, the dry eye disorder is evaporative dry eye. In further embodiments, the dry eye disorder is selected from any of the subclasses of ADDE or evaporative dry eye disorder, or appropriate combinations thereof. As noted by the author of the DEWS report, however, the various classes and subclasses are not mutually exclusive. Hence, dry eye can occur via different mechanism in different subclasses or a dry eye disease state originating in one subclass can lead to events that cause dry eye by a mechanism in another subclass.<br><br><br>
The first class of dry eye, aqueous tear-deficient dry eye (ADDE), is also known as tear deficient dry eye and lacrimal tear deficiency. In ADDE, dry eye is believed to be due to a failure of lacrimal tear secretion. While not wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that dryness results from reduced lacrimal tear secretion and volume, causing tear hyperosmolarity. Tear film hyperosmolarily can cause hypcrosmolarity of the ocular surface epithelial cells, stimulating inflammatory events involving various kinases and signaling pathways.<br>
Two subclasses of ADDE are Sjogren syndrome dry eye (SSDE), where the lacrimal glands are targeted by an autoimmune process, and non-Sjogren syndrome dry eye (NSSDE) . Accordingly, in some embodiments, the eye disorder is SSDE. In other embodiments, dry eye disorder is non-Sjogren syndrome dry eye. In SSDE, it is believed that activated T-cells can infiltrate the lacrimal glands, causing cell death of acinar and ductular cells and hyposecrction of tears. The effects of locally released cytokines or circulating antibodies can amplify the effects of hyposecretion. The two major forms of SSDE are primary and secondary forms. Primary SS can occur in combination with dry mouth (xerostomia). Secondary SSDE occurs with the symptoms of primary SSDE together with an autoimmune connective disease such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosis, polyarteritis nodosa, Wegener's granulomatosis, systemic sclerosis, primary bilary sclerosis, or mixed connective tissue disease. Diagnostic criteria for each of these connective diseases is known in the art. Further, primary SSDE may be associated with systemic manifestations of disease which may involve the lungs, kdneys, liver, blood vessels and joints.<br>
In NSSDE, the systemic autoimmune characteristics of Sjogren syndrome dry eye are excluded. Forms of NSSDE include primary lacrimal gland deficiencies (including age-related dry eye, congenital alacrima, and familial dysautonomia), secondary lacrimal deficiencies (including inflammatory infiltration of the lacrimal gland by sarcoid granulomata, lymphomatous cells, and AIDS related T-cclls; that associated with graft vs. host disease; and that resulting from lacrimal gland ablation or lacrimal gland denervation), obstruction of the lacrimal gland ducts (including that caused by cicatrizing conjunctivitis including trachoma, cicatricial pemphigoid and mucous membrane pemphigoid, erythema multiforme, and chemical or thermal burns), and reflex hyposecretion (including reflex sensory block, such as that associated with contact lens wear, diabetes mellitus, and neurotrophic keratitis, and reflex motor block, including that associated with VII cranial nerve damage, multiple neuromatosis, and exposure to systemic drugs such as antihistamines,<br><br>
beta blockers, antispasmodics, diuretics, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and other psychotropic drugs).<br>
The second major class of dry eye disorder is evaporative dry eye, which is caused by excessive water loss from the exposed ocular surface in the presence of normal lacrimal secretory function. Intrinsic causes of evaporative dry eye include Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) (including that caused by a reduced number of glands due to congenital deficiency acquired-MGD; MGD associated with dystichiasis, dystichiasis lymphedema syndrome, and metaplasia; hypersecretory MGD associated with Meibomian seborrhea, hypersecretory MGD associated with retinoid therapy, primary and secondary obstructive MGD, focal or diffuse obstructive MGD, simple or cicatricial obstructive MGD, atrophic or inflammatory obstructive MGD; Simple MGD primary or secondary to anterior blepharitis, acne rosacea, scborrhoeic dermatitis, ectrodactyly syndrome, Turner syndrome, systemic toxicity from 13-cis retinoic acid, polychlorinated biphenyls, and epinephrine; and cicatricial MGD primary or secondary to chemical burns, pemphigoid, acne rosacea, erythema multiforms, VKC and AKC), disorders of the lid aperture and lid/globe congruity or dynamic (such as that occurring with craniostenosis, endocrine and other forms of proptosis, myopia, and after plastic surgery on the lids), and low blink rate (including that caused by an extrapyramidal disorder such as Parkinson's disease). Extrinsic causes of evaporative dry eye include ocular surface disorders (including xerophthalmia caused by vitamin A deficiency; and that associated with topical drugs and preservatives such as topical anesthesia and bcnzalkonium chloride), contact lens wear, ocular surface disease (including allergic eye disease), allergic conjunctivitis (including aseasonal allergic conjunctivitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, and atopic keratoconjunctivitis), and the use of anti-histamines.<br>
Patients in need of treatment of a dry eye disorder can be identified by a variety of diagnostic methods known in the art, including the diagnostic methods summarized in Bron, et al., "Methodologies to Diagnose and Monitor Dry Eye Disease: Report of the Diagnostic Methodology Subcommittee of the International Dry Eye Workshop (2007)", The Ocular Surface, 5(2), 108-152 (April 2007), which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Pharmaceutical Formulations and Dosage Forms<br>
When employed as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of the invention can be administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. These compositions can be prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art, and can be administered by a variety of routes, depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical (including transdermal, epidermal, ophthalmic and to mucous membranes including intranasal, vaginal and rectal delivery), pulmonary (e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer; intratracheal or intranasal), oral or parenteral. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal intramuscular or injection or infusion; or intracranial, e.g., intrathecal or intraventricular, administration. Parenteral administration can be in the form of a single bolus dose, or may be, for example, by a continuous perfusion pump. Pharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable. Coated condoms, gloves and the like may also be useful.<br><br>
This invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions which contain, as the active ingredient, one or more of the compounds of the invention above in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (excipienls). In making the compositions of the invention, the active ingredient is typically mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient or enclosed within such a carrier in the form of, for example, a capsule, sachet, paper, or other container. When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders.<br>
In preparing a formulation, the active compound can be milled to provide the appropriate particle size prior to combining with the other ingredients. If the active compound is substantially insoluble, it can be milled to a particle size of less than 200 mesh. If the active compound is substantially water soluble, the particle size can be adjusted by milling to provide a substantially uniform distribution in the formulation, e.g. about 40 mesh.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be milled using known milling procedures such as wet milling to obtain a particle size appropriate for tablet formation and for other formulation types. Finely divided (nanoparticulate) preparations of the compounds of the invention can be prepared by processes known in the art, for example see International Patent Application No. WO 2002/000196.<br>
Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup, and methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention can be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing procedures known in the art.<br>
The compositions can be formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 5 to about 1000 mg (I g), more usually about 100 to about 500 mg, of the active ingredient. The term "unit dosage forms" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary'<br><br>
dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipicnt.<br>
The active compound can be effective over a wide dosage range and is generally administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. It will be understood, however, that the amount of the compound actually administered will usually be determined by a physician, according to the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.<br>
For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, the active ingredient is typically dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition can be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from, for example, about 0.1 to about 1000 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention.<br>
The tablets or pills of the present invention can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.<br>
The liquid forms in which the compounds and compositions of the present invention can be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.<br>
Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutical^ acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders.<br><br>
The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. In some embodiments, the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in can be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be breathed directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device can be attached to a face masks tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions can be administered orally or nasally from devices which deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.<br>
The amount of compound or composition administered to a patient will vary depending upon what is being administered, the purpose of the administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the patient, the manner of administration, and the like. In therapeutic applications, compositions can be administered to a patient already suffering from a disease in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease and its complications. Effective doses will depend on the disease condition being treated as well as by the judgment of the attending clinician depending upon factors such as the severity of the disease, the age, weight and general condition of the patient, and the like.<br>
The compositions administered to a patient can be in the form of pharmaceutical compositions described above. These compositions can be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. Aqueous solutions can be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration. The pH of the compound preparations typically will be between 3 and 11, more preferably from 5 to 9 and most preferably from 7 to 8. Tt will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts.<br>
The therapeutic dosage of the compounds of the present invention can vary according to, for example, the particular use for which the treatment is made, the manner of administration of the compound, the health and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. The proportion or concentration of a compound of the invention in a pharmaceutical composition can vary depending upon a number of factors including dosage, chemical characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity), and the route of administration. For example, the compounds of the invention can be provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution containing about 0.1 to about 10% w/v of the compound for parenteral administration. Some typical dose ranges are from about 1 fig/kg to about 1 g/kg of body weight per day. In some embodiments, the dose range is from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100<br><br>
mg/kg ofbody weight per day. The dosage is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, formulation of the excipient, and its route of administration. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.<br>

Accordingly, in some embodiments, the methods comprise administration of the compound, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and an ophthalmically acceptable carrier. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is a liquid composition, semi-solid composition, insert, film, microparticles or nanooparticles.<br>
In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is a liquid composition. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is a semi-solid composition. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is an topical composition. The topical compositions include, but are not limited to liquid and semi-solid compositions. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is a topical composition. In some embodiments, the topical composition comprises aqueous solution, an aqueous suspension, an ointment or a gel. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is topically applied to the front of the eye, under the upper eyelid, on the lower eyelid and in the cul-de-sac. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is sterilized. The sterilization can be accomplished by known lechniques like sterilizing filtration of the solution or by heating of the solution in the ampoule ready for use. The ophthalmic compositions of the invention can further contain pharmaceutical excipients suitable for the preparation of ophthalmic formulations. Examples of such excipients are preserving agents, buffering agents, chelating agents, antioxidant agents and salts for regulating the osmotic pressure.<br>
As used herein, the term "ophthalmically acceptable carrier" refers to any material that can contain and release the compound, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or N-oxide (hereof, and that is compatible with the eye. In some embodiments, the ophthalmically acceptable carrier is water or an aqueous solution or suspension, but also includes oils such as those used to make ointments and polymer matrices such as used in ocular inserts. In some embodiments, the composition may be an aqueous suspension comprising the compound, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or N-oxide thereof. Liquid ophthalmic compositions, including both ointments and suspensions, may have a viscosity that is suited for the selected<br><br>
route of administration. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition has a viscosity in the range of from about 1,000 to about 30,000 centipoise.<br>
In some embodiments, the liquid composition further comprises a polymer. These polymers may be used to improve the bioavailability, raise viscosity, or reduce drainage from the eye for a liquid formulation. In some embodiments, the polymers include, but are not limited to, those described in Wagh, et al., "Polymers used in ocular dosage form and drug delivery systems", Asian J. Pharm., pages 12-17 (Jan. 2008), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments, the polymer is sodium hyaluronase, chitosan, a cyclodcxtrin (e.g., hydroxypropyl p-cyclodextrin), polygalactoronic acid, xyloglucan, xanthan gum, gellan gum, a thiomer, a poly(ortho ester) (e.g., as described in Einmahl, Adv. Drug. Deliv. Rev. 53:45-73 (2001), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), or a tamarind seed polysaccharide (e.g., as described in Ghelardi, et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 48:3396-3401 (2004), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).<br>
In some embodiments, the ophthalmic compositions may further comprise one or more of surfactants, adjuvants, buffers, antioxidants, tonicity adjusters, preservatives (e.g., EDTA, BAK (benzalkonium chloride), sodium chlorite, sodium perborate, polyquaterium-l), thickeners or viscosity modifiers (e.g., carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxymethyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, glycol 400, propylene glycol hydroxymethyl cellulose, hydroxpropyl-guar, hyaluronic acid, and hydroxypropyl cellulose) and the like. Additives in the formulation may include, but arc not limited to, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, sorbic acid, methyl paraben, propyl paraben, chlorhcxidine, castor oil, and sodium perborate.<br>
Aqueous ophthalmic compositions (solutions or suspensions) generally do not contain physiologically or ophthalmically harmful constituents. In some embodiments, purified or deionized water is used in the composition. The pH may be adjusted by adding any physiologically and ophthalmically acceptable pll adjusting acids, bases or buffers to within the range of about 5.0 to 8.5. Ophthalmically acceptable examples of acids include acetic, boric, citric, lactic, phosphoric, hydrochloric, and the like, and examples of bases include sodium hydroxide, sodium phosphate, sodium borate, sodium citrate, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, tromethamine, trishydroxymethylamino-methane, and the like. Salts and buffers include citrate/dextrose, sodium bicarbonate, ammonium chloride and mixtures of the aforementioned acids and bases.<br><br>
In some embodiments, the osmotic pressure of the ophthalmic composition may be from about 10 milliosmolar (mOsM) to about 400 mOsM, or from 260 to about 340 mOsM. In some embodiments, the osmotic pressure can be adjusted by using appropriate amounts of physiologically and ophthalmically acceptable salts or excipients. In further embodiments, sodium chloride may be used to approximate physiologic fluid. In other embodiments, the composition comprises sodium chloride ranging from about 0.01% to about 1% by weight, or from about 0.05% to about 0.45% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition. Hquivalcnt amounts of one or more salts made up of cations such as potassium, ammonium and the like and anions such as chloride, citrate, ascorbate, borate, phosphate, bicarbonate, sulfate, thiosulfate, bisulfate, sodium bisulfate, ammonium sulfate, and the like can also be used in addition to or instead of sodium chloride to achieve osmolalities within the above stated range. Similarly, a sugar such as mannitol, dextrose, sorbitol, glucose and the like can also be used to adjust osmolality.<br>
In some embodiments, the methods involve forming or supplying a depot of the therapeutic agent in contact with the external surface of the eye. A depot refers to a source of therapeutic agent that is not rapidly removed by tears or other eye clearance mechanisms. This allows for continued, sustained high concentrations of therapeutic agent be present in the fluid on the external surface of the eye by a single application. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that absorption and penetration may be dependent on both the dissolved drug concentration and the contact duration of the external tissue with the drug containing fluid. As the drug is removed by clearance of the ocular fluid and/or absorption into the eye tissue, more drug is provided, e.g. dissolved, into the replenished ocular fluid from the depot. Accordingly, the use of a depot may more easily facilitate loading of the ocular tissue for more insoluble therapeutic agents. In some embodiments, the depot can remain for up to eight hours or more. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic depot forms includes, but is not limited to, aqueous polymeric suspensions, ointments, and solid inserts.<br>
In some embodiments, a semi-solid composition is a liquid formulation which increases in viscosity upon application to the eye, usually because of a polymer in the liquid formulation. This viscosity increase may be triggered by a change in temperature, pH, or electrolyte concentration. In some embodiments, the polymer include, but are not limited to, those described for semi-solid dosage forms in Wagh, et al., "Polymers used in ocular dosage form and drug delivery systems", Asian J. Pharm., pages 12-17 (Jan. 2008), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments, the polymer is cclluloseacetophthalate, polyacrylic acid, gellan gum, hyaluronase, chitosan, salts of alginic<br><br>
acid (e.g., sodium alginate), or a block copolymer of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide (e.g., Pluronic®, BASF; poloxamer). In some embodiment, the polyacrylic acid is crosslinked acrylic acid (e.g., Carbopol®). In some embodiments, the semi-solid composition comprises a mixture of carbopol and a block copolymer of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide; a mixture of methyl cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose; or a mixture of polyethylene glycol and a block copolymer of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide.<br>
In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is an ointment or gel. In some embodiment, the ophthalmic composition is an oil-based delivery vehicle. In some embodiments, the composition comprises a petroleum or lanolin base to which is added the active ingredient, usually as 0.1 to 2%, and excipients. Common bases may include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, petrolatum and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the ointment is applied as a ribbon onto the lower eyelid.<br>
In some embodiment, the ophthalmic composition is an ophthalmic insert. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic insert is biologically inert, soft, bio-erodible, viscoelastic, stable to sterilization after exposure to therapeutic agents, resistant to infections from air borne bacteria, bio- erodible, biocompatible, and/or viscoelastic. In some embodiments, the insert comprises an ophthalmically acceptable matrix, e.g., a polymer matrix. The matrix is typically a polymer and the therapeutic agent is generally dispersed therein or bonded to the polymer matrix. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent may slowly released from the matrix through dissolution or hydrolysis of the covalcnt bond. In some embodiments, the polymer is biocrodible (soluble) and the dissolution rate thereof can control the release rate of the therapeutic agent dispersed therein. In another form, the polymer matrix is a biodegradable polymer that breaks down such as by hydrolysis to thereby release the therapeutic agent bonded thereto or dispersed therein. In further embodiments, the matrix and therapeutic agent can be surrounded with an additional polymeric coating to further control release. In some embodiments, the insert comprises a biodegradable polymer such as polycaprolactone (PCL), an cthylcne/vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), polyalkyl cyanoacrylate, polyurelhane, a nylon, or poly (dt-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), or a copolymer of any of these. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent is dispersed into the matrix material or dispersed amongst the monomer composition used to make the matrix material prior to polymerization. In some embodiments, the amount of therapeutic agent is from about 0.1 to about 50%, or from about 2 to about 20%. In further embodiments, the biodegradable or bioerodible polymer matrix is used so that the spent insert does not have to<br><br><br>
be removed. As the biodegradable or bioerodible polymer is degraded or dissolved, the therapeutic agent is released.<br>

In some embodiments, the ion-exchange resin includes, but is not limited to, those described in Wagh, ct al., "Polymers used in ocular dosage form and drug delivery systems", AsianJ. Pharm., pages 12-17 (Jan. 2008), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments, the ion-exhange resin is a partially neutralized polyacrylic acid.<br>
In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is an aqueous polymeric suspension. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent or a polymeric suspending agent is suspended in an aqueous medium (e.g., having the properties as described above). In some embodiment, the therapeutic agent is suspended. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent is in solution. In further embodiments, the suspending agent serves to provide stability to the suspension, to increase the residence time of the dosage form on the eye, or to enhance the sustained release of the drug in terms of both longer release times and a more uniform release curve. Examples of polymeric suspending agents include, but arc not limited to, dcxtrans, polyethylene glycols, polyvinylpyrolidone, polysaccharide gels, Gelrite®, cellulosic polymers like hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and carboxy-containing polymers such as polymers or copolymers of acrylic acid, as well as other polymeric demulcents. In some embodiments, the polymeric suspending agent is a water swellable, water insoluble polymer, especially a crosslinked carboxy-containing polymer. In some embodiments, the polymeric suspending agent comprises from at least about 90% to about 99.9%, or from about 95% to about 99.9%, by weight based on the total weight of monomers present, of one or more carboxy-containing monoethylenically unsaturated monomers. In some embodiments, the carboxy-containing monoethylenically unsaturated monomer includes acrylic acid, methaerylic acid, ethacrylic acid, methylacrylic acid (crotonic acid), cis- a-methylcrotonic acid (angelic acid), trans-a-methylcrotonic acid (tiglic acid), a-butylcrotonic acid, a-phenylacrylic acid, a-bcnzylacrylic acid, α-cyclohexylacrylic acid, phenylacrylic acid<br><br>
(cinnamic acid), coumaric acid (o-hydroxycinnamic acid), and umbellic acid (p-hydroxycoumaric acid). In some embodiments, the polymers may be crosslinked by a polyfunctional crosslinking agent (e.g., a difunctional crosslinking agent). In further embodiments, the amount of crosslinking should be sufficient to form insoluble polymer particles, but not so great as to unduly interfere with sustained release of the therapeutic agent. In some embodiment, the polymers are only lightly crosslinked. In some embodiments, the crosslinking agent is contained in an amount of from about 0.01% to about 5%, or from about 0.1 % to about 5.0%, or from about 0.2% to about 1%, based on the total weight of monomers present. In some embodiments, the crosslinking agents are nonpolyalkcnyl polyethcr difunctional crosslinking monomers such as divinyl glycol, 2,3-dihydroxyhexa-!,5-diene, 2,5-dimethyl-l,5-hexadiene, divinylbenzene, N,N-diallylacrylamidc, N,N-diallymelhacrytamide; polyalkenyl polyether crosslinking agents containing two or more alkenyl ether groupings per molecule, e.g., alkenyl ether groupings containing terminal H2C=C<groups prepared by etherifying a polyhydric alcohol containing at least four carbon atoms and three hydroxyl groups with an alkenyl halide such as allyl bromide or the like e.g. polyallyl sucrose pentaerythritol diolefinic non-hydrophilic macromeric crosslinking agents having molecular weights of from about to insoluble diacrylates polyacrylates methacrylates diols polyols diisocyanate hydroxyalkyl acrylate methacrylate reaction products isocyanate terminated prepolymers derived polyester polyether polysiloxane hydroxyalkylmethacrylates like.></groups>
In some embodiments, the crosslinked polymers may be made from a carboxy-containing monoethylcnically unsaturated monomer or monomers as the sole monoclhylcnically unsaturated monomer present, together with a crosslinking agent or agents. In some embodiments, the polymers are ones in which up to about 40%, and preferably from about 0% to about 20% by weight, of the carboxy-containing monoethylcnically unsaturated monomer or monomers has been replaced by one or more non-carboxyl-containing monocthylenically unsaturated monomer or monomers containing only physiologically and ophthalmically innocuous substituents, including acrylic and mcthacrylic acid esters such as methyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, 2-cthylhcxylacrylate, octyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate, 3-hydroxypropylacrylate, and the like, vinyl acetate, N-vinylpyrrolidone, and the like (see Mueller ct al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,548,990, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, for a more extensive listing of such additional monoethylcnically unsaturated<br><br>
monomers). In some embodiments, the polymers include polycarbophil (Noveon AA-1), Carbopol®, and DuraSitc®. Tn some embodiments, the crosslinked polymers are prepared by suspension or emulsion polymerizing the monomers, using conventional free radical polymerization catalysts, to a dry particle size of not more than about 50 urn in equivalent spherical diameter. In some embodiments, the average dry particle size is from about 1 to about 30 }μm, or from about 3 to about 20 urn in equivalent spherical diameter. In some embodiments, the polymer particles are obtained by mechanically milling larger polymer particles.  In further embodiments, such polymers will have a molecular weight from about 250,000 to about 4,000,000, and from 3,000,000,000 to 4,000,000,000. In other embodiments, the particles of crosslinked polymer are monodisperse, meaning that they have a particle size distribution such that at least about 80%, about 90% or about 95%, of the particles fall within aμ.m band of major particle size distribution. In further embodiments, the monodisperse particle size means that there is no more than about 20%, about 10%, or about 5% particles of a size below 1 μm In some embodiments, the aqueous polymeric suspension comprises from about 0.05 to about 1%, from about 0.1 to about 0.5%, or from about 0.1 to about 0.5%, of the therapeutic agent and from about 0.1 to about 10%, from about 0.5 to about 6.5%, from about 0.5 to about 2.0%, from about 0.5% to about 1.2%, from about 0.6 to about 0.9%, or from about 0.6 to about 0.8% of a polymeric suspending agent. Although referred to in the singular, it should be understood that one or more species of polymeric suspending agent can be used with the total amount falling within the stated ranges. In one embodiment, the amount of insoluble lightly crosslinked polymer particles, the pH, and the osmotic pressure can be correlated with each other and with the degree of crosslinking to give a composition having a viscosity in the range of from about 500 to about 100,000 cenlipoisc, and preferably from about 1,000 to about 30,000 or about 1,000 to about 10,000 centipoise, as measured at room temperature (about 25° C.) using a Brookfield Digital LVT Viscometer equipped with a number 25 spindle and a 13R small sample adapter at 12 rpm. In some embodiments, the viscosity is from about 10 to about 400 centipoise, from about 10 to about 200 centipoiscs or from about 10 to about 25 centipoise.<br>
In some embodiments, the aqueous polymeric suspensions may be formulated so that they retain the same or substantially the same viscosity in the eye that they had prior to administration to the eye. In some embodiments, they may be formulated so that there is increased gelation upon contact with tear fluid. For instance, when a formulation containing DuraSite® or other similar polyacrylic acid-type polymer is administered to the eye at a pH<br><br>
of less than about 6.7, the polymer may swell upon contact with tear fluid since it has a higher pFI (around 7). This gelation or increase in gelation may lead to entrapment of the suspended particles, thereby extending the residence time of the composition in the eye. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent is released slowly as the suspended particles dissolve over time. In some embodiments, this delivery route increases patient comfort and increased therapeutic agent contact time with the eye tissues, thereby increasing the extent of drug absorption and duration of action of the formulation in the eye. The therapeutic agents contained in these drug delivery systems may be released from the gels at rates that depend on such factors as the drug itself and its physical form, the extent of drug loading and the pH of the system, as well as on any drug delivery adjuvants, such as ion exchange resins compatible with the ocular surface, which may also be present.<br>
The compositions of the invention can further include one or more additional pharmaceutical agents such as a chemotherapeutic, steroid, anti-inflammatory compound, or immunosuppressant, examples of which are listed hereinabove.<br>
The invention will be described in greater detail by way of specific examples. The following examples are offered for illustrative purposes, and are not intended to limit the invention in any manner. Those of skill in the art will readily recognize a variety of noncritical parameters which can be changed or modified to yield essentially the same results.<br>

Step I. cis- and tranS'3-(benzyloxy)-N,N~dimethylcyclobutanesu[fonamide<br><br>
To a solution of methanesulfonamide, N,N-dimethyl- (7.45 g, 60.5 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (190 mL) at -78 °C was added a solution of 2.50 M of n-butyllithium in<br><br>
hcxane (31 mL, 77.5 mmol). The reaction was stirred at -78 °C for 45 minutes, was then warmed to 0 °C and stirred for 15 minutes, then was re-cooled to -78 °C. A solution of 2-(benzyloxy)-propane-l,3-diyl bis(4-methylbenzenesulfonate) (prepared as described in Chemical Communications v. 30, pp. 3190-3192 (2006); 29.1 g, 59.3 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (120 mL) was added dropwise, rapidly. The reaction was stirred at -78 DC for 15 minutes following complete addition, then the bath was removed and the reaction allowed to warm to ambient temperature over 1.5 hours. The solution was re-cooled to -78 °C and 2.50 M of n-butyllithium in hexane (31 mL, 77.5 mmol) was added. After 15 min, the bath was removed and the reaction again allowed to reach ambient temperature and stir for 16 hours. As the reaction was judged incomplete by TLC, it was cooled again to -78 °C and a further portion of 2.50 M of n-butyllithium in hexane (10 mL, 25 mmol) was added. Upon warming to room temperature, the reaction was quenched by the addition of water and the mixture was extracted with three portions of ethyl acetate. The combined organic extracts were washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution followed by brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. Flash chromatography, eluting with a gradient of 20-50% ethyl acetate in hexancs afforded desired product. The isomers were characterized separately but were recombined for the subsequent transformation as a mixture of cis and trans isomers (7.06 g, 44%).<br>

To a solution of Dcss-Martin piuumaut ^it.j g, JJ./ mmol) in methylene chloride (200 mL) was added cis- and trans-3-hydroxy-N,N-dimethylcyclobutanesulfonamide (5.75 g, 32.1 mol) in methylene chloride (200 mL). The reaction was stirred at ambient temperature for 16 hours. The volume of DCM was reduced to 100 mL in vacuo. This solution was filtered through a plug of basic alumina, rinsing with further DCM. The filtrate was evaporated. The resulting yellow sticky solid was extracted by stirring vigorously with several portions of diethyl ether in succession. The extracts were filtered through a plug of solid sodium carbonate and again filtered through another plug of basic alumina, rinsing finally with an additional small portion of ethyl acetate to afford clean product (4 g, 70%).

pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (7.09 g, 22.5 mmol) and crude 3-(cyanomethylene)-N,N-dimethylcyclobutanesulfonamide (prepared above) in acetonitrile (200 mL) was added 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (3.36 mL, 22.5 mmol). The reaction was stirred for 16 hours. The crude product was purified by flash column chromatography, eluting with a gradient of 0-10% MeOH in DCM (dichloromethane). The product collected from this pre-purification was further purified using preparative-HPLC/MS (XBridge C18 column, eluting with a gradient of McCN/IhO containing 0.15% NH4OH) to afford a mixture of isomers. The cis-and trans- isomers were separated using a portion of this mixture by the following method; Chiral Technologies Chiralcel OJ column, 30 x 250 mm, 5\i packing material, eluting with 60% ethanol in hexanes at a flow rate of 14.5 mL/min and column loading of 65 mg/injection.

Example A: In vitro JAK Kinase Assay<br>
Compounds herein were tested for inhibitory activity of JAK targets according to the following in vitro assay described in Park etal, Analytical Biochemistry 1999, 269, 94-104. The catalytic domains of human JAK1 (a.a. 837-1142), JAK2 (a.a. 828-1132) and JAK3 (a.a. 781 -1124) with an N-terminal Flis tag were expressed using baculovirus in insect cells and purified. The catalytic activity of JAK1, JAK2 or JAK3 was assayed by measuring the phosphorylation of a biotinylated peptide. The phosphorylated peptide was detected by homogenous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF). IC50S of compounds were measured for each kinase in the reactions that contain the enzyme, ATP and 500 nM peptide in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.8) buffer with 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, and 0.1 mg/mL (0.01%) BSA. The ATP concentration in the reactions was 90 uM for Jakl, 30 u.M for Jak2 and 3 uJvl for Jak3. Reactions were carried out at room temperature for 1 hr and then stopped with 20 uL 45 mM EDTA, 300 nM SA-APC, 6 nM Eu-Py20 in assay buffer (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA). Binding to the Europium labeled antibody took place for 40 minutes and HTRF signal was measured on a Fusion plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA). The compounds of Examples 1-60, 82, and 83 were found to have IC50 values less than 60 nM for at least one of JAK 1, JAK2, and JAK3.<br>
Example B: Cellular Assays<br><br>
One or more compounds herein were tested for inhibitory activity of JAK targets according to at least one of the following cellular assays.<br>
Cancer cell lines dependent on cytokines and hence JAK/STAT signal transduction, for growth, were plated at 6000 cells per well (96 well plate format) in RPMI 1640, 10% IBS, and 1 nG/mL of appropriate cytokine. Compounds were added to the cells in DMSO/mcdia (final concentration 0.2% DMSO) and incubated for 72 hours at 37 °C, 5% C02. The effect of compound on ceil viability was assessed using the CellTiter-GIo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) followed by TopCount (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA) quantitation. Potential off-target effects of compounds were measured in parallel using a non-JAK driven cell line with the same assay readout. All experiments were performed in duplicate.<br>
The above cell lines can also be used to examine the effects of compounds on phosphorylation of JAK kinases or potential downstream substrates such as STAT proteins, Akt, Shp2, or Hrk. These experiments can be performed following an overnight cytokine starvation, followed by a brief preincubation with compound (2 hours or less) and cytokine stimulation of approximately I hour or less. Proteins are then extracted from cells and analyzed by techniques familiar to those schooled in the art including Western blotting or ELISAs using antibodies that can differentiate between phosphorylated and total protein. These experiments can utilize normal or cancer cells to investigate the activity of compounds on tumor cell survival biology or on mediators of inflammatory disease. For example, with regards to the latter, cytokines such as IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, or IFN can be used to stimulate JAK activation resulting in phosphorylation of ST AT prolein(s) and potentially in transcriptional profiles (assessed by array or qPCR technology) or production and/or secretion of proteins, such as IL-17. The ability of compounds to inhibit these cytokine mediated effects can be measured using techniques common to those schooled in the art.<br>
Compounds herein can also be tested in cellular models designed to evaluate their potency and activity against mutant JAKs, for example, the JAK2V617F mutation found in myeloid proliferative disorders. These experiments often utilize cytokine dependent cells of hematological lineage (e.g. BaF/3) into which the wild-type or mutant JAK kinases are cctopically expressed (James, C, et al. Nature 434:1144-1148; Staerk, J., et ai. JBC 280:41893-41899).  Imdpoints include the effects of compounds on cell survival, proliferation, and phosphorylated JAK, STAT, Akt, or Erk proteins.<br>
Certain compounds herein have been or can be evaluated for their activity inhibiting T-ccll proliferation. Such as assay can be considered a second cytokine (i.e. JAK) driven<br><br>
proliferation assay and also a simplistic assay of immune suppression or inhibition of immune activation. The following is a brief outline of how such experiments can be performed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are prepared from human whole blood samples using Ficoll Hypaque separation method and T-cells (fraction 2000) can be obtained from PBMCs by elutriation. Freshly isolated human T-cells can be maintained in culture medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at a density of 2 x 106 cells/ml at 37 °C for up to 2 days. For IL-2 stimulated cell proliferation analysis, T-cells arc first treated with Phytohemagglutmin (PHA) al a final concentration of 10 μg/mL for 72h. After washing once with PBS, 6000 cells/well are plated in 96-well plates and treated with compounds at different concentrations in the culture medium in the presence of 100 U/mL human IL-2 (ProSpec-Tany TechnoGenc; Rchovot, Israel). The plates arc incubated at 37 °C for 72h and the proliferation index is assessed using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent reagents following the manufactory suggested protocol (Promcga; Madison, WI).<br>
Example C: In vivo anti-tumor efficacy<br>
Compounds herein can be evaluated in human tumor xenograft models in immune compromised mice. For example, a tumorigenic variant of the INA-6 plasmacytoma cell line can be used to inoculate SCID mice subcutaneously (Burger, R., et al. Hematol J. 2:42-53, 2001). Tumor bearing animals can then be randomized into drug or vehicle treatment groups and different doses of compounds can be administered by any number of the usual routes including oral, i.p., or continuous infusion using implantable pumps. Tumor growth is followed over time using calipers. Further, tumor samples can be harvested at any time after the initiation of treatment for analysis as described above (Example B) to evaluate compound effects on JAK activity and downstream signaling pathways. In addition, selectivity of the compound(s) can be assessed using xenograft tumor models that are driven by other know kinases (e.g. Bcr-Abl) such as the K562 tumor model.<br>
Example I):  Murine Skin Contact Delayed Hypersensitivity Response Test<br>
Compounds herein can also be tested for their efficacies (of inhibiting JAK targets) in the T-ccll driven murine delayed hypersensitivity test model, 'flic murine skin contact delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response is considered to be a valid model of clinical contact dermatitis, and other T-Iymphocyte mediated immune disorders of the skin, such as psoriasis (Immunol Today. 1998 Jan;19(l):37-44). Murine DTH shares multiple<br><br>
characteristics with psoriasis, including the immune infiltrate, the accompanying increase in inflammatory cytokines, and kcratinocyte hyperproliferation. Furthermore, many classes of agents that are efficacious in treating psoriasis in the clinic are also effective inhibitors of the DTH response in mice (Agents Actions. 1993 Jan;38(l-2):116-21).<br>
On Day 0 and 1, Balb/c mice are sensitized with a topical application, to their shaved abdomen with the antigen 2,4,dinitro-fluorobenzene (DNFB). On day 5, ears are measured for thickness using an engineer's micrometer. This measurement is recorded and used as a baseline. Both of the animals' cars arc then challenged by a topical application of DNFB in a total of 20 uL (10 uL on the internal pinna and 10 uL on the external pinna) at a concentration of 0.2%. Twenty-four to seventy-two hours after the challenge, cars are measured again.   Treatment with the test compounds was given throughout the sensitization and challenge phases (day -I to day 7) or prior to and throughout the challenge phase (usually afternoon of day 4 to day 7). Treatment of the test compounds (in different concentration) was administered cither systemicaily or topically (topical application of the treatment to the cars).  Kfficacics of the test compounds are indicated by a reduction in ear swelling comparing to the situation without the treatment. Compounds causing a reduction of 20% or more were considered efficacious. In some experiments, the mice are challenged but not sensitized (negative control).<br>
The inhibitive effect (inhibiting activation of the JAK-STAT pathways) of the test compounds can be confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. Activation of the JAK-STAT pathway(s) results in the formation and translocation of functional transcription factors. Further, the influx of immune cells and the increased proliferation of keratinocylcs should also provide unique expression profile changes in the ear that can be investigated and quantified. Formalin fixed and paraffin embedded ear sections (harvested after the challenge phase in the DTH model) are subjected to immunohistochemical analysis using an antibody that specifically interacts with phosphorylated STAT3 (clone 58E12, Cell Signaling Technologies). The mouse ears are treated with test compounds, vehicle, or dexamcthasone (a clinically efficacious treatment for psoriasis), or without any treatment, in the DTI I model for comparisons, 'lest compounds and the dexamcthasone can produce similar transcriptional changes both qualitatively and quantitatively, and both the test compounds and dexamcthasone can reduce the number of infiltrating cells. Both systemicaily and topical administration of the test compounds can produce inhibitive effects, i.e., reduction in the number of infiltrating cells and inhibition of the transcriptional changes.<br><br>
Example E: In vivo anti-inflammatory activity<br>
Compounds herein can be evaluated in rodent or non-rodent models designed to replicate a single or complex inflammation response. For instance, rodent models of arthritis can be used to evaluate the therapeutic potential of compounds dosed preventative I y or therapeutically. These models include but are not limited to mouse or rat collagen-induced arthritis, rat adjuvant-induced arthritis, and collagen antibody-induced arthritis. Autoimmune diseases including, but not limited to, multiple sclerosis, type I-diabctes mellitus, uveoretinilis, thyroditis, myasthenia gravis, immunoglobulin nephropathies, myocarditis, airway sensitization (asthma), lupus, or colitis may also be used to evaluate the therapeutic potential of compounds herein. These models are well established in the research community and are familiar to those schooled in the art (Current Protocols in Immunology, Vol 3., Coligan, J.E. et at, Wiley Press.; Methods in Molecular Biology: Vol. 225, Inflammation Protocols., Winyard, P.O. and Willoughby, D.A., Humana Press, 2003.).<br>
Example V:  Animal Models for the Treatment of Dry Eye, Uveitis, and Conjunctivitis<br>
Compounds may be evaluated in one or more preclinical models of dry eye known to those schooled in the art including, but not limited to, the rabbit concanavalin A (ConA) lacrimal gland model, the scopolamine mouse model (subcutaneous or transdermal), the Botulinumn mouse lacrimal gland model, or any of a number of spontaneous rodent autoimmune models that result in ocular gland dysfunction (e.g. NOD-SOD, MRL/lpr, or NZB/NZW) (Barabino ct al., Experimental Eye Research 2004, 79, 613-621 and Schrader et al., Developmental Opthalmology, Karger 2008, 41, 298-312, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Endpoints in these models may include histopathology of the ocular glands and eye (cornea, etc.) and possibly the classic Schirmer test or modified versions thereof (Barabino el al.) which measure tear production. Activity may be assessed by dosing via multiple routes of administration (e.g. systemic or topical) which may begin prior to or after measurable disease exists.<br>
Compounds may be evaluated in one or more preclinical models of uveitis known to those schooled in the art. These include, but are not limited to, models of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) and endotoxin induced uveitis (EIU). EAU experiements may be performed in the rabbit, rat, or mouse and may involve passive or activate immunization. For instance, any of a number or retinal antigens may be used to sensitize animals to a relevant immunogen after which animals may be challenged ocuarly with the same antigen. The EIU model is more acute and involves local or systemic administration of lipopolysaccaride at<br><br>
sublethal doses. Endpoints for both the EIU and EAU models may include fundoscopic exam, histopathology amongst others. These models are reviewed by Smith et al. (Immunology and Cell Biology 1998, 76, 497-512, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Activity is assessed by dosing via multiple routes of administration (e.g. systemic or topical) which may begin prior to or after measurable disease exists. Some models listed above may also develop scleritis/episcleritis, chorioditis, cyclitis, or iritis and are therefore useful in investigating the potential activity of compounds for the therapeutic treatment of these diseases.<br>
Compounds may also be evaluated in one or more preclinical models of conjunctivitis known those schooled in the art. These include, but are not limited to, rodent models utilizing guinea-pig, rat, or mouse. The guinea-pig models include those utilizing active or passive immunization and/or immune challenge protocols with antigens such as ovalbumin or ragweed (reviewed in Groneberg, D.A., et al.. Allergy 2003, 58, 1101-1113, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Rat and mouse models are similar in general design lo those in the guinea-pig (also reviewed by Groneberg). Activity may be assessed by dosing via multiple routes of administration (e.g. systemic or topical) which may begin prior to or after measurable disease exists. Endpoints for such studies may include, for example, histological, immunological, biochemical, or molecular analysis of ocular tissues such as the conjunctiva.<br>
