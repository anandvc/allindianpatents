POLYMERIZATION CATALYST FOR POLYTHIOURETHANE-BASED OPTICAL MATERIAL, POLYMERIZABLE COMPOSITION CONTAINING THE CATALYST, OPTICAL MATERIAL OBTAINED FROM THE COMPOSITION, AND METHOD FOR PREPARING THE OPTICAL<br>
MATERIAL<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a polymerization catalyst for a polythiourethane-based optical material, a polymerizable composition for a polythiourethane-based optical material including the catalyst, an optical material obtained by polymerization of the composition, and a method for preparing the optical material. The polythiourethane resins obtained by the present invention are used for optical materials such as plastic lenses, prisms, optical fibers, information recording substrates, filters, light emitting diodes, and the like, and in particular, suitably used as plastic lens materials for spectacles.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
In recent years, improving harmony with the global environment and decreasing the environmental burden have become significant goals of the industry and the development of products and technologies has been speeded up out of concern for the environment. There has been a similar movement in the technical field of the present invention,<br><br>
in particular, the regulation of the use of an organotin compound has been strengthened among developed countries, since it has become a problem that the organotin catalyst, which is widely used as a catalyst for a polyurethane resin, is harmful for human bodies due to its high toxicity, environmental hormones, and the like. In the spectacle lens industry which uses this polythiourethane resin, there is a need for the development of a catalyst to replace the organotin catalyst. As for tin-free non-metal catalysts capable of giving common thermocurable resins, an amine compound, an amine carboxylate, phosphine, and the like are known (Patent Documents 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) .  In addition, a quaternary ammonium salt compound is known to be used in combination with a carboxylic acid metal compound (Patent Document 6).<br>
[0003]<br>
Furthermore, to prepare a polythiourethane resin as a material for a plastic lens, a casting polymerization method in which a polymerizable composition is injected into a mold for heat curing is generally employed.  In this method, the polymerization reaction is carried out while the temperature is gradually raised from a low temperature to a high temperature over a period of several hours to several tens of hours. At that time, in order to obtain an optically homogeneous plastic lens, it is necessary to add a catalyst to slowly carry out a heat controlled polythiourethanization reaction, thereby preventing the occurrence of thermal inhomogeneity while the temperature is raised. Furthermore, in order to fully realise the physical properties of the resin including its optical properties, heat resistance, and strength, it is necessary to complete the<br><br>
polymerization. In order to complete the polymerization, a method in which a catalyst with strong polymerization activity is used, or a method in which the amount of the catalyst is increased might be considered. However, such methods have problems such as the polymerization reaction progresses until the prepared polymerizable composition is injected into a mold, in other words, sufficient pot life cannot be secured. Furthermore, there is another problem that exothermic heat is locally generated during polymerization and then optical inhomogeneity occurs frequently in the lenses. As a method of solving this problem, there have been reports, for example, of a case in which the low-temperature activity is suppressed using a Lewis acid in combination with a tertiary amine with strong activity (Patent Document 6). [0004]<br>
However, if a conventionally known non-metal catalyst is used as a catalyst for polythiourethanization, the catalyst activity in the low-temperature zone is too strong, and runaway polymerization occurs. Thus, such a catalyst is not good enough as the catalyst for producing the optical transparent resin for a plastic lens for spectacles, and the like, since sufficient heat resistance may not be obtained and cloudiness is generated in the obtained resin depending on the resins to be cured.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]<br>
The present invention provides a non-metallic polymerization catalyst that does not include a metal compound such as the organotin compound that has been conventionally used as a catalyst for polythiourethane resin, and further, is capable of giving a stable quality to a polythiourethane resin making it suitable for use as an optical transparent resin.<br>
[0006]<br>
The present inventors have conducted extensive studies in order to solve the above-described problems, and as a result, they have found that a compound in which the anions of a quaternary ammonium salt or a quaternary phosphonium salt are a sulfonic acid group can be stably dissolved in polyiso (thio) cyanates, and can have excellent catalytic activity equivalent to or more than that of an organotin-based catalyst used as a catalyst for the preparation of optical material made from polythiourethane resin prepared from the polyiso(thio)cyanates and active hydrogen compounds. It was demonstrated that if the catalyst of the present invention is used, the increase in the viscosity of a monomer mixture before the monomer mixture is injected into a mold at a low temperature is slow, and accordingly, the pot life can be greatly increased even without cooling the monomer mixture, and furthermore, even in an amount of the catalyst to be added in which the increase in the viscosity in a low-temperature zone is slower than the organotin catalyst,<br>
sufficient catalytic activity is exhibited at medium- to high-temperature zones and the polymerization is completed, and the heat resistance of the obtained resin is equivalent to or more than that of the organotin catalyst. They have found that a compound in which the anion group of a quaternary ammonium salt or a quaternary phosphonium salt is a sulfonic acid group can be used as an excellent non-metal catalyst to replace the organotin-based catalyst, thereby completing the present invention.<br>

[0091]<br>
Next, a method for preparing the polythiourethane resin of the present invention will be described.<br>
In the present invention, a molar ratio of the functional groups of the iso(thio)cyanato groups contained in the<br>
polyiso(thio)cyanates to the hydroxyl groups and/or mercapto groups contained in the active hydrogen compounds, in the monomer mixture including the polyiso(thio)cyanates and the active hydrogen compounds, is usually in the range of 0.5 to 3.0, preferably in the range of 0.6 to 2.0, and more preferably in the range of 0.8 to 1.3.<br>
[0092]<br>
Furthermore, the content of the polymerization catalyst for a polythiourethane-based optical material of the present invention is, for example, 0.0005 parts by weight to 5 parts by weight, and preferably 0.005 parts by weight to 2 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the monomer mixture.<br>
[0093]<br>
At the time of molding the polythiourethane resin of the present invention, a variety of substances such as a chain extender, a  <br>
cross-linking agent, a light stabilizer, an ultraviolet absorber, an anti-oxidant, an anti-coloring agent, an oil-soluble dye, a filler, an external or internal mold release agent, an adhesion improving agent, may be added, depending on the purposes, as is done in conventional molding methods. When a plastic lens is produced with the polythiourethane resin of the present invention, it can usually be obtained by the casting polymerization.  It is preferable that an internal mold release agent including typical examples of phosphoric acid esters is added in advance to the polymerizable composition in the present invention in order to accelerate the release of the lens from the mold after the polymerization. Alternatively, the mold can be treated with an external mold release agent in advance.<br>
[0094]<br>
Next, a method for preparing the monomer will be described.<br>
In the present invention, when the polyiso(thio)cyanates, the active hydrogen compounds, a reaction catalyst, a mold release agent, and other additives are mixed before the polymerization to prepare a polymerizable composition, the order of addition of the catalyst, the mold release agent and other additives will vary depending on their solubility into the monomers. However, they may be added to polyiso (thio) cyanates and dissolved therein in advance, added to the active hydrogen compounds and dissolved therein in advance, or added to a mixture of the polyiso(thio)cyanates and the active hydrogen compounds and dissolved therein. Alternatively, the catalyst, the mold release agent, and other additives may be dissolved in a part of the monomers in use to prepare a master solution, and then the<br>
master solution may be added to the monomer mixture. As for the mixing of the compound represented by the general formula (2) and the sulfonic acid derivative represented by the general formula (3), they may be mixed in advance, and then added to the monomers or a part thereto and dissolved therein, or mixed in the monomers in use or a part thereof and dissolved therein. The order of addition is not restricted to these exemplified methods, and should be properly selected on the basis of operability, safety, expediency, and/or the like.  For example, a method in which the polymerization catalyst for polythiourethane-based optical material of the present invention, the mold release agent, and other additives are be added to the polyiso(thio)cyanates and dissolved in apart of the polyiso(thio)cyanates to prepare a master solution, and then the master solution is added to the monomer mixture is a preferable.<br>
[0095]<br>
When the polyiso(thio)cyanates and the active hydrogen compounds, the reaction catalyst, the mold release agent and other additives are mixed to prepare a polymerizable composition, the temperature at that time can be 25 degrees C or higher. Since the polymerization catalyst for polythiourethane-based optical material of the present invention has low activity at a low temperature, it is usually 25 degrees C or lower. From the viewpoint of increased pot life of the composition, it is sometimes preferable to employ a lower temperature than 25 degrees C. However, when the solubility of the reaction catalyst, the mold release agent, and the additives into the monomers is insufficient, it is also possible to heart them in advance and then to dissolve them in the polyiso(thio)cyanates<br>
or the active hydrogen compounds that are the monomers, or a monomer mixture. In addition, it is preferable to prepare these polymerization compositions under a nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
[0096]<br>
As a typical polymerization method for obtaining the polythiourethane resin (for example, plastic lens) of the present invention from the thus obtained monomer mixed composition, casting polymerization may be considered. Namely, the polymerizable composition of the present invention is injected between molds held by a gasket, a tape, and the like. At this time, depending on the physical properties required for the obtained plastic lens, it is preferable that such processes as a defoaming process under reduced pressure, a filtration process such as under an applied pressure, a reduced pressure, and the like, may be employed as necessary in many cases.<br>
Subsequently, the composition can be subjected to curing by heating the mold in a heating apparatus such as an oven, in water, and then the resin can be taken out therefrom.<br>
[0097]<br>
In order to obtain the transparent resin of the present invention, the type and amount of the reaction catalysts, and the like, and the type and ratio of the monomers will vary depending on the configuration of the composition to be polymerized, and are not absolutely restricted. However, the aforementioned conditions are preferred in many cases.<br>
[0098]<br>
The conditions of the heat polymerization of the composition<br>
of the present invention to be injected into the mold will vary significantly depending on the composition of the polymerizable composition of the present invention, the type of reaction catalysts, the shape of the molds, and the like, and thus, cannot be restricted. However, the polymerization is conducted at a temperature of about -50 to 200 degrees C over 1 to 100 hours.<br>
In some cases, the composition is preferably polymerized by keeping or gradually raising the temperature within a range of 10 to 130 degrees C for 1 to 24 hours.<br>
[0099]<br>
In addition, the resin taken out from the mold may be subjected to a treatment such as annealing, as necessary. The annealing temperature is usually from 50 to 200 degrees C, preferably from 90 to 150 degrees C and more preferably from 100 to 130 degrees C.<br>
[0100]<br>
The resin obtained by curing the composition for optical material of the present invention is a resin that is excellent in color hue. The transparent resin of the present invention can be produced as a molded article in various shapes by changing the mold at the time of casting polymerization. The resin can be used for various applications such as optical resins for spectacle lenses, camera lenses, light emitting diodes (LED). In particular, the transparent resins are suitable for use as optical material or an optical element of spectacle lenses, camera lenses, light emitting diodes, and the like.<br>
[0101]<br>
For the purposes of improving anti-reflection, granting high<br>
durability, improving wear resistance, improving chemical resistance, granting anti-clouding property, granting fashionability and photochromic properties, and the like, known physical or chemical treatments such as surface polishing, antistatic treatment, a coating treatment on one or both surfaces, a dyeing treatment and a photochromic treatment can be performed as necessary on a plastic lens using the polythiourethane resin of the present invention.<br>
[0102]<br>
As a coating layer formed by the coating process, a primer layer, a hard coat layer, an anti-reflection film layer, an anti-clouding coating film layer, an anti-fouling layer, a water repelling layer, and the like may be mentioned. These coating layers may each be used singly or a plurality of coating layers may be used in a multi-layered structure. When the coating layers are applied on both surfaces of the lens, the same coating layer or different coating layers may be applied on each surface.<br>
[0103]<br>
These coating layers may each be used together with an ultraviolet absorber for the purpose of protecting the lenses or the eyes from ultraviolet rays, an infrared ray absorber for the purpose of protecting the eyes from infrared rays, a light stabilizer or an anti-oxidant for the purpose of improving the weather resistance of the lenses, a dye or a pigment for the purpose of enhancing the fashionability of the lenses, or furthermore, a photochromic dye or a photochromic pigment, an anti-static agent, and other known additives for improving the performances of lenses. Various leveling agents may be used for the purpose of improving the coating property<br>
of the layer to be coated by the coating process.<br>
[0104]<br>
The primer layer is usually formed between a hard coat layer to be described below and the optical lens. The primer layer is a coating layer for the purpose of improving the adhesion between the hard coat layer to be formed thereon and the lens, and the impact resistance can also be improved in some cases.<br>
Any material can be used for the primer layer as long as it has high adhesion to the obtained optical lens, but usually a primer composition, and the like containing a urethane-based resin, an epoxy-based resin, a polyester-based resin, a melanin-based resin or a polyvinyl acetal, and the like as the main component is used. A suitable solvent which does not affect the lens may be used in the primer composition for the purpose of adjusting the viscosity of the composition. Alternatively, no solvent may be employed.<br>
[0105]<br>
The primer composition can be applied by any coating method or dry method. When the coating method is employed, the primer layer is formed by a known coating method such as spin coating and dip coating, and then solidified to form a primer layer. When the dry method is employed, the primer layer is formed by a known dry method such as a CVD method and a vacuum deposition method. Upon forming a primer layer, the surface of the lens may be subjected to a pre-treatment such as an alkaline treatment, a plasma treatment and an ultraviolet treatment, as necessary for the purpose of improving the adhesion of the primer layer.<br>
[0106]<br>
The hard coat layer refers to a coating layer for the purpose of providing the surface of the lens with properties such as abrasion resistance, wear resistance, humidity resistance, hot water resistance, heat resistance and weather resistance.<br>
[0107]<br>
The hard coat layer is generally formed from a hard coat composition is used which contains an organic silicon compound having curing properties and one or more fine oxide particles containing at least one or more elements selected from the element group of Si, Al, Sn, Sb, Ta, Ce, La, Fe, Zn, W, Zr, In and Ti, and/or one or more fine particles comprising composite oxides of two or more elements selected from that element group.  It is preferable that the hard coat composition contains at least one of the following: amines, amino acids, complexes of metal acetylacetonate, metal salts of organic acids, perchloric acids, salts of perchloric acids, acids, metal chlorides, and polyfunctional epoxy compounds, in addition to the aforementioned components. A suitable solvent which does not affect the lens may be used in the hard coat composition. Alternatively, no solvent may be employed.<br>
[0108]<br>
The hard coat layer is usually formed by applying the hard coat composition using a known coating method such as spin coating and dip coating, and then curing the resulting material. As for the curing method, methods for curing by thermal curing, or by irradiation with energy beams such as ultraviolet rays, visible rays or the like can be considered. The difference of the refractive index between the hard coat layer and the lens is preferably in a range of ± 0.1<br>
to supress the generation of interference fringes.<br>
[0109]<br>
An anti-reflection layer is usually formed on the aforementioned hard coat layer as needed. As for the anti-reflection layer, there are inorganic-based layers and organic-based layers. In the case of the inorganic-based layer, the layer is formed by a dry method such as a vacuum deposition method, a sputtering method, an ion plating method, an ion beam assisted method and a CVD method using an inorganic oxide such as Si02 and Ti02. In the case of the organic-based layer, the layer is formed by a wet method using a composition containing an organic silicon compound and silica-based fine particles having internal pores.<br>
[0110]<br>
The anti-reflection layer is composed of a single layer or multi layers. When composed of a single layer, it is preferable that its refractive index is lower by at least 0.1 or more than that of the hard coat layer. In order to effectively exhibit an anti-reflection function, a multi-layered anti-reflection film is preferable. In this case, a low refractive index film and a high refractive index film are alternately stacked. In this case, it is also preferable that the difference the refractive index between the low refractive index film and the high refractive index film is 0.1 or more. As for the high refractive index film, films of ZnO, Ti02, Ce02, Sb205, Sn02, Zr02, Ta205, and the like can be exemplified. As for the low refractive index film, a Si02 film, and the like may be exemplified.<br>
[0111]<br>
On the anti-reflection film layer, an anti-clouding coating<br>
film layer, an anti-fouling layer or a water repelling layer may be formed as necessary. As for methods of forming an anti-clouding coating layer, an anti-fouling layer or a water repelling layer, so far as they do not adversely affect the anti-reflection function, the treating methods, treating materials and the like are not particularly limited. Known anti-clouding coating treating methods, anti-fouling treating methods, water repelling treating methods and materials can be used. For example, in the anti-clouding coating treating method and anti-fouling treating method, there can be exemplified a method for covering the surface with a surfactant, a method for adding a hydrophilic film to the surface for the water absorbent property, a method for making the surface concave and convex for enhancing its water absorbency, a method for improving water absorbency by using photocatalytic activity, a method for conducting an ultra-water repelling treatment to prevent attachment of waterdrops and the like. Furthermore, as  for  the water repelling treatment method, there can be exemplified methods for forming a water repelling treatment layer by subjecting a fluorine-containing silane compound or the like to deposition or sputtering, a method for forming a water repelling treatment layer by dissolving the fluorine-containing silane compound in a solvent, and then coating the surface, and the like.<br>
[0112]<br>
The lens can be dyed by a known dyeing method. However, it is usually dyed with one of the following methods:<br>
(1) a method involving immersing the lens in a dye solution, (2) a method involing coating the lens using a coating agent containing<br>
a pigment or a method involving forming a coating layer capable of being dyed and dyeing the coating layer, (3) a method involving adding a material capable of being dyed into the raw material monomer and then being polymerized, and (4) a method involving heating a sublimation pigment for sublimation.<br>
[0113]<br>
The method in (1) generally refers to a method involving immersing a predetermined optical surface-finished lens material in a pigment solution with a dye in use dissolved or homogeneously dispersed therein (the dyeing process) and then, as required, heating the lens to solidify the pigment (the annealing process after dyeing) . The pigment used in the dyeing process is not particularly limited as long as it is a known pigment. However, an oil soluble dyestuff or a disperse dye is usually used. The solvent used in the dyeing process is not particularly limited as long as the pigment in use can be dissolved or homogeneously dispersed therein. In this dyeing process, a surfactant for dispersing the pigment in the dye solution or a carrier for promoting dyeing may be added as required. The dyeing process involves dispersing a pigment and a surfactant to be added as needed in water or a mixture of water and an organic solvent to prepare a dye bath, immersing the optical lens in the dye bath and dyeing it at a predetermined temperature for a predetermined time. The dye temperature and the time vary depending on the desired coloring concentration, but the temperature is usually 120 degrees C or lower, and the time taken from about several minutes to several tens of hours. The dye concentration of the dye bath is from 0.01 to 10 weight %. Furthermore, when dyeing is difficult, it may be carried out under<br>
an applied pressure. The annealing process after the dyeing has been conducted as required is a process for heating the dyed lens material. The heating process is carried out such that water remaining on the surface of the lens material dyed in the dyeing process is removed using a solvent, and the like, or the solvent is air dried, and then the lens material is left, for example, in a furnace such as an infrared heating furnace, a resistance heating furnace or the like in an ambient atmosphere for a predetermined time. The annealing process after dyeing involves preventing the decolorization of the dyed lens material (the decolorization-preventing process) and at the same time eliminating any water that has penetrated to the inside of the lens material at the time of dyeing.<br>
[0114]<br>
The method in (2) refers to a method involving applying an organic coating solution in which a pigment is dispersed or dissolved to the plastic lens without directly dyeing the plastic lens material, and then curing it in order to form a dyed coating layer on the lens surface, or a method involving adopting the method in (1) after forming a coating layer capable of being dyed on the surface of the plastic lens, that is, immersing the plastic lens in a dye solution, and heating for dyeing.<br>
[0115]<br>
The method in (3) refers to a method for dissolving a dye in a raw material monomer of the plastic lens in advance, and then peforming polymerization. The pigment in use is not particularly limited as long as it is capable of being homogeneously dissolved in a raw material monomer, or dispersed to the extent that the optical<br><br>
property is not damaged.<br>
[0116]<br>
As for the method in (4) , there are (a) a method involving the sublimation of a solid sublimation pigment for dyeing the plastic lens, (b) a method involving putting a base obtained by applying a solution containing a sublimation pigment opposite to the plastic lens at a non-contact state, and heating the base and the lens for dyeing, and (c) a method involving transferring a transfer layer composed of a coloring layer containing a sublimation pigment and an adhesive layer onto the plastic lens and then heating for dyeing. The optical lens of the present invention may be dyed by any of these methods. The pigment in use is not particularly limited as long as it is a pigment with a sublimation property.<br>

The tests of the viscosity of composition after keeping it at 20 degrees C for 5 hours, the transparency of the resin, the performances (refractive index, Abbe number, and heat resistance) of the lens were evaluated by the following testing methods.<br>
[0119]<br>
Viscosity: The polymerizable composition comprising polyiso(thio)cyanates, thiol compounds, catalysts and additives was kept at 20 degrees C for 5 hours, and then its viscosity (mPa-s) was<br><br>
measured by using a B-type viscometer. The process is usually conducted at 25 degrees C or lower from the mixing of the polymerization composition to the injection into a mold.  If the viscosity of the polymerization composition is too high, optical distortion, and the like occur in the obtained resin after injecting the polymerization composition into the mold, and thus it is not preferable. Accordingly, the lower the viscosity of the polymerization composition is after keeping it at 20 degrees C for 5 hours, the further it is possible to increase the pot life, and operability is good.<br>

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY [0143]<br>
The catalyst of the present invention is a tin-free catalyst having an excellent catalytic activity capable of replacing an organotin catalyst that has been conventionally used as a catalyst for the preparation of a polythiourethane-based optical material. The catalyst of the present invention is useful as a novel catalyst to replace the organotin catalyst, the regulation of use of which has been strengthened in recent years. The catalyst of the present invention allows the pot life to be greatly increased even without any cooling of the monomer mixture, since the activity at a low temperature is particularly low, and the increase in the viscosity of a monomer mixture until injection into a mold is slow, in comparison to the organotin catalyst. Furthermore, the polythiourethane resin obtained by the catalyst of the present invention sufficiently satisfies the physical properties necessary for an optical material,<br>
and accordingly, the catalyst of the present invention is useful as an excellent non-metal catalyst to replace the organotin-based catalysts.<br>
The polythiourethane-based optical materials of the present invention, obtained by using the polythiourethane resin, are used for optical materials in plastic lenses, prisms, optical fibers, information recording substrates, filters, light emitting diodes, and the like, and are particularly suitable for use as plastic lens materials for spectacles.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
