				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of subterranean exploration and<br>
drilling and, more particularly, to a system and method for multiple wells from a<br>
common surface location.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Subterranean deposits of coal contain substantial quantities of entrained methane gas.<br>
Limited production in use of methane gas from coal deposits has occurred for many<br>
years. Substantial obstacles, however, have frustrated more extensive development in<br>
use of methane gas deposits in coal seams. The foremost problem in producing<br>
methane gas from coal seams is that while coal seams may extend over large areas of up<br>
to several thousand acres, the coal seams are fairly shallow in depth, varying from a few<br>
inches to several meters. Thus, while the coal seams are often relatively near the<br>
surface, vertical wells drilling into the coal deposits for obtaining methane gas can only<br>
drain a fairly small radius around the coal deposits. Further, coal deposits are not<br>
amenable to pressure fracturing and other methods often used for increasing methane gas<br>
production from rock formations. As a result, once the gas easily drained from a<br>
vertical well bore in a coal seam is produced further production is limited in<br>
volume. Additionally, coal seams are often associated with subterranean water,<br>
which must be drained from the coal seam in order to produce the methane.<br>
Horizontal drilling patterns have been tried in order to extend the amount of coal<br>
seams exposed to a drill bore for gas extraction. Such horizontal drilling<br>
techniques, however, require the use of a radiused well bore which presents<br>
difficulties in removing the entrained water from the coal seams. The most efficient<br>
method for pumping water from a subterranean well, a sucker rod pump, does not<br>
work well in horizontal or radiused bores.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention provides a system and method using multiple articulated<br>
and drainage wells from a common surface well that substantially eliminates, reduces,<br>
or minimizes the disadvantages and problems associated with previous systems and<br>
methods. In particular, certain embodiments of the present invention provide a<br>
system and method using multiple articulated and drainage wells from a single surface<br>
well for efficiently producing and removing entrained methane gas and water from a<br>
coal seam without requiring that multiple wells be drilled from the surface.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a system for<br>
accessing a subterranean zone from an entry well including an entry well extending<br>
from the surface. The entry well has a substantially vertical portion. One or more<br>
drainage wells extend from the entry well to a subterranean zone. One or more<br>
articulated wells extend from the entry well to the subterranean zone. At least one of<br>
the articulated wells intersects at least one of the one or more drainage wells at a<br>
junction proximate the subterranean zone. A drainage pattern is formed coupled to<br>
the junction and operable to conduct fluids from the subterranean zone to the junction.<br>
The technical advantage of the present invention include providing a method<br>
and system for using multiple articulated and drainage wells from a common surface<br>
well. In particular, a technical advantage may include the formation of an entry well,<br>
a plurality of drainage wells, a plurality of articulated wells, and drainage patterns<br>
from a single surface location to minimize the number of surface wells needed to<br>
access a subterranean zone for draining of gas and liquid resources. This allows for<br>
more efficient drilling and production and greatly reduces costs and problems<br>
associated with other systems and methods.<br>
Other technical advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to<br>
one skilled in the art from the following figures, description, and claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
FIGURE 1 is a diagram illustrating a system 10 for accessing a subterranean<br>
zone using multiple articulated and drainage wells from a common surface well in<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In particular embodiments,<br>
the subterranean zone is a coal seam. However, it should be understood that other<br>
subterranean zones can be similarly accessed using system 10 of the present invention<br>
to remove and/or produce water, hydrocarbons and other fluids from the zone, to treat<br>
minerals in the zone prior to mining operations, or to inject, introduce, or store a fluid<br>
or other substance into the zone.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 1, system 10 includes an entry well 12, drainage wells<br>
14, articulated wells 16, cavities 18, and sumps 20. Entry well 12 extends from<br>
surface 22 towards subterranean zone 24. Drainage wells 14 extend from the<br>
terminus of entry well 12 to subterranean zone 24, although drainage wells 14 may<br>
alternatively extend from any other suitable portion of entry well 12. Articulated<br>
wells 16 also may extend from the terminus of entry well 12 to subterranean zone 24<br>
and may each intersect a corresponding drainage well 14. Cavity 18 and sump 20<br>
may be located at the intersection of an articulated well 16 and a corresponding<br>
drainage well 14.<br>
Entry well 12 is illustrated as being substantially vertical; however, it should<br>
be understood that entry well 12 may be formed at any suitable angle relative to<br>
surface 22 to accommodate, for example, surface geometries and attitudes and/or the<br>
geometric configuration or attitude of a subterranean resource. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, drainage wells 14 are formed as slant wells that angle away from entry<br>
well 12 at an angle designated a. The angle a depends, in part, on the depth of<br>
subterranean zone 24. It will be understood that drainage wells 14 may be formed at<br>
other angles to accommodate surface topologies and other factors similar to those<br>
affecting entry well 12. Furthermore, although drainage wells 14 are illustrated as<br>
having the same angle of slant over their entire length (below entry well 12), drainage<br>
wells 14 may have two or more portions below entry well 12 that are at different<br>
angles. For example, the portion of drainage wells 14 from which cavity 18 is formed<br>
and/or which is intersected by the corresponding articulated well 16 may be<br>
substantially vertical. In the illustrated embodiment, drainage wells 14 are formed in<br>
relation to each other at an angular separation of (3 degrees. In one embodiment, the<br>
angle p equals twice the angle ot. It will be understood that drainage wells 14 may be<br>
separated by other angles depending likewise on the topology and geography of the<br>
area and location of subterranean zone 24.<br>
In particular embodiments, an enlarged cavity 18 may be formed from each<br>
drainage well 14 at the level of subterranean zone 24. As described in more detail<br>
below, cavity 18 provides a junction for the intersection of drainage well 14 by a<br>
corresponding articulated well 16 used to form a subterranean drainage bore pattern in<br>
subterranean zone 24. Cavity 18 also provides a collection point for fluids drained<br>
from subterranean zone 24 during production operations. In one embodiment, cavity<br>
18 has a radius of approximately eight feet; however, any appropriate diameter cavity<br>
may be used. Cavity 18 may be formed using suitable under-reaming techniques and<br>
equipment. A portion of drainage well 14 may continue below cavity 18 to form a<br>
sump 20 for cavity 18. Although cavities 18 and sumps 20 are illustrated, it should be<br>
understood that particular embodiments do not include a cavity and/or a sump.<br>
Each articulated well 16 extends from the terminus of entry well 12 to cavity<br>
18 of a corresponding drainage well 14 (or to the drainage well 14 if no cavity is<br>
formed). Each articulated well 16 includes a first portion 34, a second portion 38, and<br>
a curved or radiused portion 36 interconnecting portions 34 and 38. In FIGURE 1,<br>
portion 34 is illustrated substantially vertical; however, it should be understood that<br>
portion 34 may be formed at any suitable angle relative to surface 22 to accommodate<br>
surface 22 geometric characteristics and attitudes and/or the geometric configuration<br>
or attitude of subterranean zone 24. Portion 38 lies substantially in the plane of<br>
subterranean zone 24 and intersects the large diameter cavity 18 of a corresponding<br>
drainage well 14. In FIGURE 1, the plane of subterranean zone 24 is illustrated<br>
substantially horizontal, thereby resulting in a substantially horizontal portion 38;<br>
however, it should be understood that portion 38 may be formed at any suitable angle<br>
relative to surface 22 to accommodate the geometric characteristics of subterranean<br>
zone 24. Each articulated well 16 may be drilled using an articulated drill string 26<br>
that includes a suitable down-hole motor and a drill bit 28. A measurement while<br>
drilling (MWD) device 30 may be included in articulated drill string 26 for<br>
controlling the orientation and direction of a well bore drilled by the motor and bit 28.<br>
Any suitable portion of articulated well 16 may be lined with a suitable casing.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, drainage well 14 is sufficiently angled away<br>
from a corresponding articulated well 16 to permit the large radiused curved portion<br>
36 and any desired portion 38 to be drilled before intersecting cavity 18. In particular<br>
embodiments, curved portion 36 may have a radius of one hundred to one hundred<br>
fifty feet; however, any suitable radius may be used. This angle a may be chosen to<br>
minimize the angle of curved portion 36 to reduce friction in articulated well 16<br>
during drilling operations. As a result, the length of articulated well 16 is maximized.<br>
After cavity 18 has been successfully intersected by articulated well 16,<br>
drilling is continued through cavity 18 using articulated well string 26 to provide a<br>
drainage bore pattern 32 in subterranean zone 24. In FIGURE 1, drainage bore<br>
pattern 32 is illustrated substantially horizontal corresponding to a substantially<br>
horizontally illustrated subterranean zone 24; however, it should be understood that<br>
drainage bore pattern 32 may be formed at any suitable angle corresponding to the<br>
geometric characteristics of subterranean zone 24. During this operation, gamma ray<br>
logging tools and conventional MWD devices may be employed to control and direct<br>
the orientation of drill bit 28 to retain drainage bore pattern 32 within the confines of<br>
subterranean zone 24 and to provide substantially uniform coverage of a desired area<br>
within subterranean zone 24. Drainage bore pattern 32 may comprise a single<br>
drainage bore extending into subterranean zone 24 or it may comprise a plurality of<br>
drainage bores. Further information regarding an example drainage bore pattern 32 is<br>
described in more detail below. In addition, although pattern 32 is illustrated as<br>
extending from cavity 18, portion 38 of articulated wells 16 may be extended<br>
appropriately so that portion 38 serves the function of draining fluids from the<br>
subterranean zone 24.<br>
During the process of drilling drainage bore pattern 32 in a coal seam or other<br>
appropriate formations, drilling fluid or "mud" may be pumped down articulated drill<br>
string 26 and circulated out of drill string 26 in the vicinity of a bit 28, where it is used<br>
to scour the formation and to remove formation cuttings. The cuttings are then<br>
entrained in the drilling fluid which circulates up through the annulus between drill<br>
string 26 and the walls of articulated well 16 until it reaches surface 22, where the<br>
cuttings are removed from the drilling fluid and the fluid is then recirculated. This<br>
conventional drilling operation produces a standard column of drilling fluid having a<br>
vertical height equal to the depth of articulated well 16 and produces a hydrostatic<br>
pressure on the well bore corresponding to the well bore depth. Because coal seams<br>
tend to be porous and fractured, they may be unable to sustain such hydrostatic<br>
pressure, even if formation water is also present in subterranean zone 24.<br>
Accordingly, if the full hydrostatic pressure is allowed to act on subterranean zone 24,<br>
the result may be loss of drilling fluid in entrained cuttings into the formation. Such a<br>
circumstance is referred to as an "over-balanced" drilling operation in which they<br>
hydrostatic fluid pressured in the well bore exceeds the ability of the formation to<br>
withstand the pressure. Loss of drilling fluids and cuttings into the formation not only<br>
is expensive in terms of the lost drilling fluids, which must be made up, but also tends<br>
to plug the pores in subterranean zone 24, which are needed to drain the coal seam of<br>
gas and water.<br>
To prevent over-balanced drilling conditions during formation of drainage<br>
bore pattern 32, air compressors or other suitable pumps may be provided to circulate<br>
compressed air or other suitable fluids down drainage wells 14 and back up through<br>
corresponding articulated wells 16. The circulated air or other fluid will mix with the<br>
drilling fluid in the annulus around the articulated drill string 26 and create bubbles<br>
throughout the column of drilling fluid. This has the effect of lightening the<br>
hydrostatic pressure of the drilling fluid and reducing the down-hole pressure<br>
significantly that drilling conditions do not become over-balanced. Aeration of the<br>
drilling fluid reduces down-hole pressure to approximately 150-200 pounds per<br>
square inch (psi). Accordingly, low pressure coal seams and other subterranean zones<br>
can be drilled without substantial loss of drilling fluid and contamination of the zone<br>
by the drilling fluid. Alternatively, tubing may be inserted into drainage well 14 such<br>
that air pumped down through the tubing forces the fluid back through the annulus<br>
between the tubing and drainage well 14.<br>
In yet another embodiment, a pumping 40 may be installed in cavity 18, as<br>
illustrated in FIGURE 1, to pump drilling fluid and cuttings to surface 22 through<br>
drainage well 14. This eliminates the friction of air and fluid returning through<br>
articulated well 16 and may reduce down-hole pressure to nearly zero.<br>
Foam, which may be compressed air mixed with water, may also be circulated<br>
down through the articulated drill string 26 along with the drilling mud in order to<br>
aerate the drilling fluid in the annulus as articulated well 16 is being drilled and, if<br>
desired, as drainage bore pattern 32 is being drilled. Drilling of drainage bore pattern<br>
32 with the use of an air hammer bit or an air-powered down-hole motor will also<br>
supply compressed air or foam to the drilling fluid. In this case, the compressed air or<br>
foam which is used to power the down-hole motor and bit 28 exits articulated drill<br>
string 26 in the vicinity of drill bit 28. However, the larger volume of air which can<br>
be circulated down drainage wells 14 permits greater aeration of the drilling fluid than<br>
generally is possible by air supplied through articulated drill string 26.<br>
FIGURE 2 illustrates production of fluids from drainage bore pattern 32a and<br>
32b in subterranean zone 24 in accordance with one embodiment of the present<br>
invention. In this embodiment, after wells 14 and 16, respectively, as well as desired<br>
drainage bore patterns 32, have been drilled, articulated drill string 26 is removed<br>
from articulated wells 16. In particular embodiments, articulate wells may be suitably<br>
plugged to prevent gas from flowing through articulate wells 16 to the surface 22.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 2, the inlets for down-hole pumps 40 or other suitable<br>
pumping mechanisms are disposed in drainage wells 14 in their respective cavities 18.<br>
Each cavity 18 provides a reservoir for accumulated fluids allowing intermittent<br>
pumping without adverse effects of a hydrostatic head caused by accumulated fluids<br>
in the well bore. Each cavity 18 also provides a chamber for gas/water separation for<br>
fluids accumulated from drainage bore patterns 32.<br>
Each down-hole pump 40 is connected to surface 22 via a respective tubing<br>
string 42 and may be powered by sucker rods extending down through wells 14 of<br>
tubing strings 42. Sucker rods are reciprocated by a suitable surface mounted<br>
apparatus, such as a powered walking beam 46 to operate each down-hole pump 40.<br>
Each down-hole pump 40 is used to remove water and entrained coal finds from<br>
subterranean zone 24 via drainage bore patterns 32. In the case of a coal seam, once<br>
the water is removed to the surface, it may be treated for separation of methane which<br>
may be dissolved in the water and for removal of entrained finds. After sufficient<br>
water has been removed from subterranean zone 24, pure coal seam gas may be<br>
allowed to flow to surface 22 through the annulus of wells 14 around tubing strings 42<br>
and removed via piping attached to a well head apparatus. At surface 22, the methane<br>
is treated, compressed and pumped through a pipeline for use as fuel in a conventional<br>
manner. Each down-hole pump 40 may be operated continuously or as needed to<br>
remove water drained from subterranean zone 24 into cavities 18.<br>
FIGURE 3 illustrates one embodiment of the subterranean patterns 32a and<br>
32b for accessing subterranean zone 24 or other subterranean zone. The patterns 32a<br>
and 32b may be used to remove or inject water, gas or other fluids. The subterranean<br>
patterns 32a and 32b each comprise a multi-lateral pattern that has a main bore with<br>
generally symmetrically arranged and appropriately spaced laterals extending from<br>
each side of the main bore. As used herein, the term each means every one of at least<br>
a subset of the identified items. It will be understood that other suitable multibranching<br>
or other patterns including or connected to a surface production bore may<br>
be used. For example, the patterns 32a and 32b may each comprise a single main<br>
bore. Referring to FIGURE 3, patterns 32a and 32b each include a main bore 150<br>
extending from a corresponding cavity 18a or 18b, respectively, or intersecting wells<br>
14 or 16 along a center of a coverage area to a distal end of the coverage area. The<br>
main bore 150 includes one or more primary lateral bores 152 extending from the<br>
main bore 150 to at least approximately to the periphery of the coverage area. The<br>
primary lateral bores 152 may extend from opposite sides of the main bore 150. The<br>
primary lateral bores 152 may mirror each other on opposite sides of the main bore<br>
150 or may be offset from each other along the main bore 150. Each of the primary<br>
lateral bores 152 may include a radiused curving portion extending from the main<br>
bore 150 and a straight portion formed after the curved portion has reached a desired<br>
orientation. For uniform coverage, the primary lateral bores 152 may be substantially<br>
evenly spaced on each side of the main bore 150 and extend from the main bore 150<br>
at an angle of approximately forty-five degrees. The primary lateral bores 152 may<br>
be shortened in length based on progression away from the corresponding cavity 18a<br>
or 18b. Accordingly, the distance between the cavity or intersecting well bore and the<br>
distal end of each primary lateral bore 152 through the pattern may be substantially<br>
equally for each primary lateral 152.<br>
One or more secondary lateral bores 152 may be formed off one or more of<br>
the primary lateral bores 152. In a particular embodiment, a set of secondary laterals<br>
154 may be formed off the primary lateral bores 152 of each pattern 32a and 32b<br>
closest to the corresponding cavity 18a and 18b. The secondary laterals 154 may<br>
provide coverage in the area between the primary lateral bores 152 of patterns 32a and<br>
32b. In a particular embodiment, a first primary lateral 154 may include a reversed<br>
radius section to provide more uniform coverage of subterranean zone 24.<br>
The subterranean patterns 32a and 32b with their central bore and generally<br>
symmetrically arranged and appropriately spaced auxiliary bores on each side may<br>
provide a substantial uniform pattern for draining fluids from subterranean zone 24 or<br>
other subterranean zone. The number and spacing of the lateral bores may be<br>
adjusted depending on the absolute, relative and/or effective permeability of the coal<br>
seam and the size of the area covered by the pattern. The area covered by the pattern<br>
may be the area drained by the pattern, the area of a spacing unit that the pattern is<br>
designed to drain, the area within the distal points or periphery of the pattern and/or<br>
the area within the periphery of the pattern as well as surrounding area out to a<br>
periphery intermediate to adjacent or neighboring patterns. The coverage area may<br>
also include the depth, or thickness of the coal seam or, for thick coal seams, a portion<br>
of the thickness of the seam. Thus, the pattern may include upward or downward<br>
extending branches in addition to horizontal branches. The coverage area may be a<br>
square, other quadrilateral, or other polygon, circular, oval or other ellipsoid or grid<br>
area and may be nested with other patterns of the same or similar type. It will be<br>
understood that other suitable drainage bore patterns may be used.<br>
As previously described, the well bore 150 and the lateral bores 152 and 154<br>
of patterns 32a and 32b are formed by drilling through the corresponding cavity 18a<br>
or 18b using the drill string 26 in appropriate drilling apparatus. During this<br>
operation, gamma ray logging tools and conventional MWD technologies may be<br>
employed to control the direction and orientation of drill bit 28 so as to retain the<br>
drainage bore pattern within the confines of subterranean zone 24 and to maintain<br>
proper spacing and orientation of wells 150 and 152. In a particular embodiment, the<br>
main well bore 150 of each pattern 32a and 32b is drilled with an incline at each of<br>
the plurality of lateral branch points 156. After the main well bore 150 is complete,<br>
the drill string 26 is backed up to each successive lateral point 156 from which a<br>
primary lateral bore 152 is drilled on each side of the well bore 150. The secondary<br>
laterals 154 may be similarly formed. It will be understood that the subterranean<br>
patterns 32a and 32b may be otherwise suitably formed. Furthermore, as described<br>
above, a pattern (as illustrated in FIGURE 3) or otherwise may be formed off of<br>
portion 38 of articulated well 16 (which would function as well bore 150) such that<br>
cavities 18 are located at the end of portion 38/well bore 150.<br>
FIGURE 4 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for preparing subterranean<br>
zone 24 for mining operations in accordance with particular embodiments of the<br>
present invention. The example method begins at step 400 in which entry well 12 is<br>
drilled substantially vertically from the surface. At step 402, a casing with guide<br>
tubes is installed into the entry well 12. At step 404, the casing is cemented in place<br>
inside entry well 12.<br>
At step 406, drill string 26 is inserted through entry well 12 and one of the<br>
guide tubes in the guide tube bundle. At step 408, drill string 26 is used to drill<br>
approximately fifty feet past the casing. At step 410, the drill is oriented to the<br>
desired angle of the drainage well 14 and, at step 412, drainage well bore 14 is drilled<br>
down into and through target subterranean zone 24.<br>
At step 414, down-hole logging equipment may be utilized to identify the<br>
location of the subterranean zone 24. At step 416, cavity 18a is formed in first<br>
drainage well 14 at the location of subterranean zone 24. As previously discussed,<br>
cavity 18 may be formed by underreaming and other conventional techniques. At<br>
decisional step 418, if additional drainage wells are to be drilled, the method returns<br>
to step 406. If no additional drainage wells 14 are to be drilled, then the method<br>
proceeds to step 420.<br>
At step 420, articulated well 16 is drilled to intersect cavity 18. At step 422,<br>
drainage bore pattern 32 is drilled into subterranean zone 24. At step 424, production<br>
equipment is installed into drainage wells 14 and at step 426 the process ends with the<br>
production of fluids (such as water and gas) from the subterranean zone 24.<br>
Although the steps have been described in a certain order, it will be<br>
understood that they may be performed in any other appropriate order. Furthermore,<br>
one or more steps may be omitted, or additional steps performed, as appropriate.<br>
FIGURE 5 A illustrates formation of a casing with associated guide tube<br>
bundle as described in step 402 of FIGURE 4. Three guide tubes 48 are shown in side<br>
view and end view. The guide tubes 48 are arranged so that they are parallel to one<br>
another. In the illustrated embodiment, guide tubes 48 are 9 5/8" joint casings. It will<br>
be understood that other suitable materials may be employed. As an example, guide<br>
tubes 48a and 48b serve as the tubes through which drainage wells 14a and 14b are<br>
drilled, respectively. In this example, guide tube 48c serves as the tube through which<br>
both articulated wells 16a and 16b are drilled. It will be understood that other suitable<br>
arrangements may be employed. In another embodiment, guide tubes 48 may be<br>
attached to a casing collar such that the guide tubes 48 and casing collar make up the<br>
guide tube bundle.<br>
FIGURE 5B illustrates entry well 12 with guide tubes 48 and a casing collar<br>
50 cemented in entry well 12. Entry well 12 is formed from the surface 22 to a target<br>
depth (in particular embodiments, approximately three hundred feet). In a particular<br>
embodiment, entry well 12 has a diameter of approximately twenty-four inches.<br>
Forming entry well 12 corresponds with step 400 of FIGURE 4. Guide tubes 48 are<br>
shown attached to a casing collar 50. Casing collar 50 may be any casing suitable for<br>
use in down-hole operations. Inserting casing collar 50 and guide tubes 48 into entry<br>
well 12 corresponds with step 402 of FIGURE 4.<br>
Corresponding with step 404 of FIGURE 4, a cement retainer 52 is poured or<br>
otherwise installed around the casing inside entry well 12. The cement casing may be<br>
any mixture or substance otherwise suitable to maintain casing 50 in the desired<br>
position with respect to entry well 12.<br>
In operation, drill string 26 is positioned to enter one of the guide tubes 48. In<br>
order to keep drill string 26 relatively centered in casing 50, a stabilizer 54 may be<br>
employed. Stabilizer 54 may be a ring and fin type stabilizer or any other stabilizer<br>
suitable to keep drill string 26 relatively centered. To keep stabilizer 54 at a desired<br>
depth in well bore 12, stop ring 56 may be employed. Stop ring 56 may be<br>
constructed of rubber or metal or any other foreign down-hole environment material<br>
suitable. Drill string 26 may be inserted randomly into any of a plurality of guide<br>
tubes 48, or drill string 26 may be directed into a selected guide tube 48a. This<br>
corresponds to step 406 of FIGURE 4.<br>
Although the present invention has been described with several embodiments,<br>
various changes and modifications may be suggested to one skilled in the art. It is<br>
