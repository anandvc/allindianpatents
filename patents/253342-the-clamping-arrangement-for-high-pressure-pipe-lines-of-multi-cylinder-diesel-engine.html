PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to internal combustion engines and more particularly it relates to mounting/ clamping arrangement of high pressure fuel pipe lines (hpp) for multi-cylinder diesel engines.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Multi-cylinder diesel engines are widely used for automotive as well as industrial applications. The direct injection (DI) or open combustion chamber diesel engine has gained more popularity and undergone intense development because of its superior fuel economy as compare to other types of diesel engines. The successful ignition of the fuel in the combustion chamber of an engine depends mainly upon the atomization and distribution of the fuel in it. This is performed by the fuel injection system. Fuel injection system in general comprises of fuel injection pump (FIP), high pressure pipe lines (hpp) and fuel injectors. High pressure pipe lines are connected at the FIP exit, which delivers the pressurized fuel to each injectors and thus provide fuel separately to each cylinder. Conventionally, the length of hpp lines is about 60 to 80 cm and is subjected to a higher system pressures. Thus, hpp lines are subjected to high vibrations and resonance and results in hpp line cracking results in fuel leakage in the circuit especially at the FIP exit.<br>
In conventional multi cylinder engine system, a FIP is being used for uniform distribution of metered fuel among various cylinders. High pressure pipe lines move parallelly first at the FIP exit and then shaped to diverge towards injectors to provide diesel fuel separately to each cylinder. To overcome the problem of noise, vibrations and thus fuel leakage, hpp lines are clamped together at intervals. In addition to this, hpp lines are supported by a support piece with sleeves at the FIP<br>
2<br><br>
exit, followed by a hinged clamp. The hinged clamp assembly is then bolted to the engine crankcase through special bracket. This helps to minimize the failure of hpp lines to some extent, but could not entirely stop the noise and vibrations.<br>
OBJECT OF THIS INVENTION:<br>
The main object of this invention is to provide a clamping arrangement for high pressure pipe lines (hpp) of multi-cylinder diesel engine to avoid the failure of hpp lines and thus to prevent the fuel leakage.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a clamping arrangement for high pressure pipe lines (hpp) of multi-cylinder diesel engine to add robustness to hpp lines to keep the system free from noise and vibrations.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a clamping arrangement for high pressure pipe lines (hpp) of multi-cylinder diesel engine which is simple in construction and cost effective.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Clamping arrangement in accordance with this invention basically comprises of at least one clamp assembly, at least one supporting means and multiple sleeves. Wherein said clamp assembly comprises of inserting bracket, closing bracket and said brackets are connected to each other by a hinge joint with the help of a hinge pin and are provided with opening at other end to provide the access for mounting. Said supporting means is provided with multiple openings parallel to its axis on its periphery to support sleeves. Said sleeves are provided with openings, to provide access and hold hpp lines and collars at ends, to prevent the movement of said clamp assembly.<br>
All hpp lines of multi cylinder engine at FIP end are passed through said sleeves by providing the said sleeves on said lines, said sleeves are then supported on a support means, said supporting means along with hpp lines is clamped circumferentially with the help of clamp assembly and finally bolted to the engine crankcase.<br>
This arrangement provides a rigid support to hpp lines and gives rigidity to the system against high system pressure which prevents the failure of hpp lines, vibrations etc.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>

5<br><br>
Fig. 1 shows an isometric views of clamp assembly (A), Support means (B) and Rubber sleeve (C)<br>
Fig. 2 shows the clamping arrangement for hpp lines showing the clamp assembly with support means and rubber sleeves<br>
Fig. 3 Right side view from engine showing the clamping arrangement of hpp lines<br>
Referring to figs. 1 to 3, clamping arrangement basically comprises of at least one clamp assembly (A), at least one supporting means (B) and multiple sleeves (C). Wherein said clamp assembly comprises of inserting bracket (1), closing bracket (2) and said brackets are connected to each other by a hinge joint with the help of a hinge pin (3) and are provided with opening (4) at other end to provide the access for mounting. Said supporting means (B) is provided with multiple openings (5) parallel to its axis on its periphery to support sleeves. Said sleeves (C) are provided with openings (6, 7), to provide access and hold hpp lines (9) and collars (8) at ends, to prevent the movement of said clamp assembly.<br>
All hpp lines (9) of multi cylinder engine at FIP end are passed through said sleeves (C) by providing the said sleeves on said lines, said sleeves are then supported on a support means (B), said supporting means along with hpp lines (9) is clamped circumferentially with the help of clamp assembly (A) and finally fitted to the engine crankcase with the help of fastener (10).<br>
Clamping arrangement in accordance with this invention manages to prevent the vibrations caused by the hpp lines by holding all together and clamping to the crankcase, and thus minimize the failure of hpp lines during operation which intern prevent the fuel leakage.<br>
6<br><br>
This invention provides a novel technique of holding the high pressure fuel pipe (hpp) lines in the multi-cylinder engines with individual cushioning elements for each of the hpp lines and all are held in position by a circumferential clamping arrangement which is finally connected to the crankcase. This technique ensures increased rigidity of the hpp lines and the assembly that will prevent the hpp lines individually and jointly from vibrating. Sleeves acts as cushioning elements to ensure optimum clamping of the hpp lines without any direct clamping stress due to rigid metal to metal contact. Also anchoring of the circumferential clamp in the crankcase ensures rigid support for the assembly of clamp and the hpp lines.<br>
