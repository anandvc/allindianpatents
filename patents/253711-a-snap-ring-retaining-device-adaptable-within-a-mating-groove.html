SNAP-RING WITH ADDITIONAL LOOP<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]       The present invention relates to an improved snap-ring retaining device<br>
for use within a vehicle transmission.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]       A circlip or snap-ring is a substantially circular or annular retaining<br>
device having a break or opening which divides the ring into two interconnected<br>
curvilinear members. The members may be deflected or flexed to facilitate insertion<br>
into a mating groove. Snap-rings are typically formed, stamped, or otherwise<br>
constructed from a relatively thin layer of metal which directs a retaining or<br>
clamping force along the circumference or periphery of the snap-clip when properly<br>
inserted into the groove. The directional force is most commonly used to retain or<br>
clamp together various mating components.<br>
[0003]       The force vector imparted by the snap-ring varies with the type or style<br>
of snap-ring that is used and the location of the ring relative to the parts retained or<br>
mated. Two main styles of snap-ring are available: an internal snap-ring positioned<br>
within a mating internal groove and used for applying outwardly-directed clamping<br>
force, and an outer snap-ring positioned within a mating external groove for<br>
applying inwardly-directed clamping force. Of these two main types of snap-ring,<br>
internal snap-rings are of particular beneficial use within an automatic vehicle<br>
transmission.<br>
[0004]       With an internal snap-ring, the ring is compressed or contracted by<br>
deflecting the curvilinear beams or members of the ring and then inserted or<br>
"snapped" into a continuous groove cut into an inner circumferential surface of a<br>
drum, shaft, cylinder, or other component having an approximately circular cross<br>
section. Once inserted into the groove, the snap-ring is then released or retracted<br>
into its installed position, directing circumferential clamping force along the groove<br>
wall within the relatively restricted space of the groove. In this manner a snap-ring<br><br>
GP-307819-PTT-DLT<br>
2<br>
may restrict or minimize any undesirable lateral or axial motion between two or<br>
more mating parts, such as within a flange or flanges of a clutch hub and a mating<br>
drum within a transmission clutch assembly.<br>
[0005]       The insertion and removal of a snap-ring during the transmission<br>
assembly or build process may be relatively time or material intensive due to the<br>
difficulty of accessing various confined areas within the housing. For instance, a<br>
person installing a snap-ring must often insert or place the ring into an area having<br>
limited accessibility or installation clearance, while simultaneously exerting a<br>
substantial amount of force on the curvilinear beams of the snap-ring in order to<br>
open or close the ring. The space and force limitations may be considerable enough<br>
to necessitate the use of special-purpose capital equipment, potentially adding<br>
substantial cost to the assembly process. Additionally, the requisite strength or<br>
rigidity for higher-load applications may require a snap-ring formed from a<br>
proportionately thicker layer of material, which in turn may lead to an undesirable<br>
increase in overall axial space within a transmission case or other housing, resulting<br>
in the need for a larger case and/or the re-arrangement of other components within<br>
the system.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]       Accordingly, an improved retaining device is provided having a primary<br>
or main loop, a variable-width or compressible opening dividing the main loop into<br>
adjoining curvilinear beams or portions operable to exert a circumferential force<br>
when inserted into a mating groove or channel, and an additional minor or<br>
secondary loop connecting the curvilinear portions, and operable to modify the<br>
deflection or compressive force required to compress or deflect the curvilinear<br>
portions.<br>
[0007]       In one aspect of the invention, the opening comprises a plurality of<br>
generally parallel tabular extensions, each extension having sufficient surface area<br>
for applying compressive force to the main loop for flexing or bending of the<br>
curvilinear portions to facilitate installation of the retaining device. The tabular<br><br>
GP-307819-PTT-DLT<br>
3<br>
extensions are further configured to prevent rotation of the snap-ring within the<br>
mating circumferential groove.<br>
[0008]       In another aspect of the invention, a retaining device having an improved<br>
compressive or deflection force is provided in which an externally-projecting<br>
secondary loop reduces the compressive force required to compress or deflect the<br>
curvilinear portions of the main loop, thereby facilitating the installation of the<br>
retaining device.<br>
[0009]       In another aspect of the invention, a retaining device having improved<br>
rigidity is provided in which an internally-projecting secondary loop increases the<br>
compressive or deflection force required to compress or deflect the curvilinear<br>
portions of the main loop, thereby providing increased rigidity to the main loop.<br>
[0010]       In another aspect of the invention, a circular flange assembly is<br>
provided for use within a vehicle transmission, in which a substantially annular<br>
retaining device having a main loop and a minor secondary loop is inserted into<br>
continuous circumferential or peripheral groove in a flange wall, the main loop<br>
having a plurality of tabular extensions configured to prevent rotation of the main<br>
loop within the circumferential or peripheral groove.<br>
[0011]       In another aspect of the invention, a clutch assembly is provided for use<br>
within a vehicle transmission, in which an improved snap-ring retaining device is<br>
insertable in the mating grooves of a dual-flanged clutch hub and mating clutch<br>
drum to thereby retain the clutch hub and drum.<br>
[0012]       The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of<br>
the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0020]       Referring to the drawings wherein like reference numbers correspond to<br>
like or similar components throughout the several figures, there is shown in Figure<br>
1A a substantially annular or circular snap-ring 10a comprising a primary or main<br>
loop 20 having a width 11 and configured by a main radius 44 drawn from a main<br>
center point 32. An outwardly-projecting minor or secondary extend loop 22a,<br>
preferably circular in shape, is configured by a secondary radius 46a drawn from a<br>
secondary center point 30a, the extend loop 22a projecting radially outward from the<br>
circular periphery of main loop 20. A pair of tabular extensions or tabs 24a, 24b,<br>
preferably aligned in a substantially parallel manner and positioned approximately<br>
180° opposite secondary loop 22a, define a normal unflexed or "free state" break or<br>
opening 26a in main loop 20. The unflexed opening 26a is represented by the<br>
phantom or dotted-line profile in Figure 1A. Center points 30a, 32 are preferably<br>
aligned along a main loop axis 38 bisecting main loop 20 and secondary extend loop<br>
22a. Thus, main loop 20 has a first and second curvilinear beam portion 40, 42 being<br>
at least partially flexible, compressible, or deflectable, by actuating tabs 24a, 24b<br><br>
GP-307819-PTT-DLT<br>
5<br>
disposed at the end of portions 40, 42, respectively. When curvilinear portions 40,<br>
42 are deflected by the application of a contracting clamping force to tabs 24a, 24b,<br>
a reduced-width or compressed opening 26b results, as shown by the solid line in<br>
Figure 1A.<br>
[0021]       In a preferred embodiment, main radius 44 and secondary radius 46a are<br>
proportionately related by a ratio of approximately 25:1, with compressed opening<br>
26b, when substantially flexed or compressed, having a width approximately 0 to<br>
5% of main radius 44. When curvilinear portions 40, 42 are in a "free state", i.e.<br>
undeflected or unflexed, tabs 24a, 24b preferably form an unflexed opening 26a, as<br>
shown by the phantom line in Figure 1A, with a relative angle of approximately 40°<br>
between tabs 24a, 24b, although those skilled in the art will recognize that other<br>
deflection angles and loop ratios may be adapted and modified as necessary<br>
depending on the application. Tabs 24a, 24b are further preferably configured with a<br>
notch or series of notches 25 being sized and/or shaped to fit a ring compression tool<br>
(not shown), such as a pair of pliers, for assisting in compressing and inserting ring<br>
10a into, for example, a flange groove in the wall of a clutch housing<br>
[0022]       Turning to Figure 2A, a circular drum 54, depicted herein as a<br>
representative clutch drum, is shown with a captive snap-ring 10a as described<br>
hereinabove. Snap-ring 10a is inserted into a channel or peripheral flange groove 50<br>
positioned along the inner circumferential or peripheral surface 52 of the drum 54,<br>
the groove represented in Figure 2A as a dotted line. A first window or slot 55a is<br>
positioned at one end of drum 54 generally opposite secondary loop 22a, slot 55a<br>
being appropriately sized to accept the elastically-deflectable tabs 24a, 24b of snap-<br>
ring 10a to prevent relative rotation or spin of the snap-ring 10a within the flange<br>
groove 50. To obtain the rotational balance as well as to accommodate insertion and<br>
flexing of secondary outer loop 22a, the bottom or opposite end of the drum 54<br>
likewise has a substantially similar and preferably identical slot 55b positioned<br>
approximately 180° opposite slot 55a. Once compressed or deflected and inserted<br>
into flange groove 50, and subsequently released, snap-ring 10a returns to a position<br>
short of "free state" or unflexed opening 26a (See Figure 1A), and so exerts a<br><br>
GP-307819-PTT-DLT<br>
6<br>
continuous outward circumferential clamping force along the surface of groove 50,<br>
thereby providing axial support and noise reduction between the mating parts, such<br>
as, for example, between clutch drum 54 of Figure 2A and mating clutch hub 62 of<br>
Figure 2B.<br>
[0023]        Clutch hub 62 of Figure 2B has a continuous outer circumferential<br>
channel or hub groove 60 disposed between a first and second flange 63a, 63b.<br>
Snap-ring 10a is inserted into groove 60 between flanges 63a, 63b and compressed<br>
at tabular extensions 24a, 24b (see Figure 1 A) as described previously herewithin.<br>
While holding snap-ring 10a in a compressed position, hub 62 is inserted into<br>
mating clutch drum 54 (see Figure 2A). Tabular extensions 24a, 24b are held in<br>
compressed position until hub 62 is fully inserted into clutch drum 54. Once the<br>
snap ring 10a is aligned with flange groove 50, the tabular extensions 24a, 24b of<br>
snap-ring 10a are released, and the snap-ring 10a partially opens or decompresses to<br>
at least partially fill mating flange groove 50 (see Figure 2A) while remaining at<br>
least partially within hub groove 60. Tabular extensions 24a, 24b snap into place<br>
within slot 55a, thereby preventing relative rotation of the snap ring 10a within<br>
grooves 50, 60. For example, in the case of clutch hub 62 of Figure 2B, the snap-<br>
ring 10a would thereby retain the hub and drum, as would any splines on the mating<br>
surfaces of clutch drum 54 and hub 62. For simplicity, mating splines are not shown<br>
on surface 52 of clutch drum 54 of Figure 2A or on flanges 63a, 63b of hub 62 of<br>
Figure 2B, which are the respective mating surfaces on which splines could be<br>
employed. By utilizing the described double-flange design, the contact area or power<br>
density between snap-ring 10a and flanges 63a, 63b is thereby doubled, which may<br>
permit the amount and/or type of metal strengthening support components within the<br>
transmission component, such as splining, to be reduced in number and/or otherwise<br>
modified in appearance.<br>
[0024]       In an alternative embodiment of Figure IB, a snap-ring 10b has an<br>
inwardly-projecting minor or secondary inner loop 22b having a center point 30b<br>
and a secondary radius 46b. The primary advantages of a secondary inner loop are<br>
twofold. First, by positioning a secondary inner loop 22b on the inside of main loop<br><br>
GP-307819-PTT-DLT<br>
7<br>
20, the outer dimension or periphery of snap-ring 1 Ob may be completely hidden<br>
within a groove positioned within a circular wall of, for example, a clutch hub.<br>
Additionally, in some circumstances installation space may be restricted or limited,<br>
and consequentially, a secondary extend loop of the type shown in Figure 1A may<br>
not fit properly within the flange. Second, a secondary inner loop 22b may be used<br>
to enhance the rigidity of a snap-ring 10b, as an inwardly-disposed secondary loop<br>
requires greater force to achieve a given amount of annular deflection than does an<br>
outer-loop design, as discussed hereinbelow.<br>
[0025]       The deflection effect on a main surface due to the addition of a secondary<br>
surface of various size and position may be explained by using the simplified linear-<br>
beam profile of Figure 3A in which a straight beam 70a having a length LI is<br>
attached to ground 74 and subjected to an applied load P. In this example, load P<br>
imparts to beam 70a a deflection 8, in which 8 = P*(L1)3/(3*E*I). In this deflection<br>
equation, variable E is Young's Modulus, commonly referred to as the modulus of<br>
elasticity, with variable I being the moment of inertia. Those skilled in the art will<br>
recognize that Young's Modulus E is a material-specific quantity, with a stiffer<br>
material providing a reduced magnitude of deflection, while the moment of inertia I<br>
varies with the shape of the beam profile.<br>
[0026]       Figure 3B modifies the single-beam design by adding an outwardly-<br>
disposed minor beam 72a having a length L2. Under this modified configuration, the<br>
force-deflection equation is modified to 8 = P * (LI + L2)3/(3*E*I). That is, the<br>
addition of an outwardly-disposed minor-beam 72a increases deflection 8 for a given<br>
load P. In designing a snap ring according to the invention, deflection can therefore<br>
be customized by adapting a specific size and shape for the inner and outer loops, by<br>
changing ring material, or by modifying the shape of the ring, as indicated by the<br>
force-deflection equations.<br>
[0027]       By contrast, Figure 3C shows an inwardly-disposed minor beam 72b<br>
having a length L2 equal to length L2 of Figure 3B. In this example, deflection δ =<br>
P*(L1-L2)3/(3*E*I). The addition of minor-beam 72b therefore decreases deflection<br>
8 for a given load P, that is, 72b imparts stiffness or rigidity to the beam as described<br><br>
GP-307819-PTT-DLT<br>
8<br>
previously herewithin. When this deflection effect is applied to a curved beam or a<br>
beam of another non-linear shape, such as a snap-ring, the corresponding force-<br>
deflection equations consider the radii of the inner and outer loops in determining<br>
beam length and linear deflection. Note, however, that the general relationship of<br>
inverse proportionality between deflection and both moment of inertia and Young's<br>
Modulus, as illustrated in the simplified designs of Figures 3A-C, holds true<br>
independent of beam shape and can be used by those skilled in the art to design a<br>
snap-ring for a given application, in accordance with the teachings of this invention.<br>
While the minor beams (secondary loop 22a, 22b of Figures 1A, IB) are preferably<br>
circular, they may also take another suitable shape such as an oval or a parabola to<br>
further increase or reduce the moment of inertia in the aforementioned manner.<br>
[0028]            While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been<br>
described in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will<br>
recognize various alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention<br>
within the scope of the appended claims.<br><br>

a snap-ring retaining device having a main loop including an<br>
opening having a width which is reducable by compression of said main loop, the<br>
opening at least partially separating said main loop into a pair of operatively<br>
connected curvilinear portions, and a minor secondary loop connecting said pair of<br>
said curvilinear portions for facilitating flexing of said curvilinear members;<br>
wherein said clutch hub is insertable into said clutch drum,<br>
and wherein said snap-ring retaining device is insertable within both of said hub<br>
groove and said flange groove to thereby retain said clutch hub with said clutch<br>
drum.<br><br>
GP-307819-PTT-DLT<br>
12<br>
15.       The clutch assembly of claim 14, wherein said secondary loop<br>
is an internally-projecting inner loop operable to increase the compressive force<br>
required to deflect said curvilinear portions.<br>
16.       The clutch assembly of claim 14, wherein said secondary loop<br>
is an externally-projecting extend loop operable to reduce the compressive force<br>
required to deflect said curvilinear portions.<br>
17.       The clutch assembly of claim 14, said clutch drum including a<br>
first flange slot and a second flange slot positioned approximately opposite said first<br>
slot, wherein said main loop comprises a plurality of tabular extensions at least<br>
partially defining said opening and insertable into one of said slots to thereby<br>
minimize rotation of said snap-ring within said hub groove and said flange groove.<br>
18.       The clutch assembly of claim 14, wherein the radius of said<br>
main loop and the radius of said secondary loop are proportionately related by a<br>
ratio of approximately 25:1.<br>
19.       The clutch assembly of claim 14, wherein the width of said<br>
opening is approximately 0 to 5% of the main radius of said main loop when said<br>
opening is fully compressed.<br>
20.       The clutch assembly of claim 17, including a secondary loop<br>
which is insertable into one of said slots to thereby allow flexing motion of said<br>
secondary loop.<br><br>
A retaining device or snap-ring for retaining a mating hub and drum<br>
within a transmission is provided. The device is insertable into a groove along the<br>
inner circumference of a circular flange and includes a main outer loop, an opening<br>
for dividing the snap-ring into two deflectable curvilinear portions and at least<br>
partially defined by a tabular extension projecting from each curvilinear member.<br>
The tabular extensions provide sufficient surface area for applying deflective or<br>
compressive force to the snap-ring and are contoured to facilitate use of a deflection<br>
tool. The snap-ring further comprises an externally-projecting secondary loop for<br>
reducing deflection force, or an internally-projecting secondary loop for increasing<br>
deflection force. The snap-ring may be used within a double-flange hub having a<br>
plurality of slots for facilitating insertion of the secondary loop and the tabular<br>
extensions within the flange groove.</td>
