CLOSING ELEMENT FOR COMPRESSED AIR CARRING POLYGONAL TUBES ON A SPINNING MACHINE<br>
The invention relates to a closing element for compressed air carrying polygonal tubes as defined in the preamble of claim 1.<br>
On drafting systems for spinning machines, pneumatically loadable top roller support and weighting arms are used, which are secured by means of brackets to a mounting rod of the machine. The mounting rod is hollow and serves at the same time as a compressed air line. A drafting system of this type is described, for example, in DE 198 29 403 Al.<br>
The generic DE 198 30 048 Al discloses a mounting rod that is formed from polygonal, tube sections, with each tube section being provided at its ends with closing elements. A mounting rod that is composed of individual tube sections permits a modular construction of the mounting rod and compressed air supply for spinning machines of different lengths. The ends of the polygonal tube sections between the polygonal tube sections, the compressed air is conducted through connecting tube sections between the closing elements.<br>
Sealing of non-circular hollow sections with elastic sealing elements, such as O-rings with a circular cross section, or with special section rings presents problems, in as much as Irregularities of the special section of the sealing element causes in the latter only a equalization of internal tension, without the sealing element filling all zones of the hollow section in a uniform and sealing manner. It is therefore preferred to use in the case of polygonal hollow sections, pasty sealing substances of a suitable viscosity, which must completely fill a sealing channel that is formed by the hollow section and an inserted sealing element. It is however difficult to fill the sealing channel evenly and completely, as well as in a process-safe manner in the case of series production. This requires a great expenditure for production and testing. The sealing effect is often not stable for a long duration because of the aging behavior of the sealing substance and because of operational stress, for example as a result of pressure<br>
2<br><br>
changes. A reliable lasting sealing is not ensured if leakages occur in operation, sealing elements of this type are only hard to disassemble and cannot be reused. It is often necessary to exchange the entire special-section tube length. Likewise the sealing substance is in a position to only a very limited extent to retain besides it sealing function the sealing element in the-required position against the inner pressure in the special-section tube. This requires additional special measures, for example the installation of pins for securing the sealing element against axial displacement.<br>
If an adhesive is used as sealing substance to increase the hold of the sealing element in its position at the end of the polygonal tube, it will be only difficult and costly to disassemble the closing element. In this case the closing elements and possibly even the polygonal tube will no longer be suited for immediate reuse.<br>
At their ends, the polygonal tubes are supported in recesses of brackets that are also known as stands and secured in position by means of screw connections. To this end a mounting screw extends through the special-section tube in its end region, which also mounts the respective closing element. By tightening the mounting screw, the polygonal hollow section may undergo elastic or plastic deformations, whereby the sealing effect is additionally put at risk.<br>
Based on the foregoing state of the art, it is an object of the invention to improve the known closing elements.<br>
In accordance with the invention, this object is accomplished by a closing element with the features of claim 1.<br>
Further advantageous configurations of the closing element are subject matter of the dependent claims.<br>
The closing element of the invention seals the polygonal tube in a reliable and stable manner for a long duration.   It is no longer necessary to secure it in addition, for<br>
3<br><br>
example, by means of formfitting retaining pins against displacement by the air pressure that builds up in the interior of the polygonal tube, since the closing element is adequately secured in force locking engagement when it's sealing function is activated. In comparison with closing elements of the known art assembly and disassembly of the closing elements are facilitated. The closing elements and polygonal tubes are reusable without having to perform additional labor such as for example, cleaning.<br>
A closing element as defined in claim 2 permits applying axial pressure to the sealing element in a uniform manner and achieving a reliable sealing effect.<br>
The closing element of claim 3 permits sealing and securing at the same time when a closing element is already inserted into the polygonal tube. It is easy and simple to release the closing element from its secured position and to remove it from the polygonal tube.<br>
A closing element of claim 4 offers adequate space for the compressed air channel, which ensures the necessary passage of the compressed air, and it permits in addition the screw to engage a counterpart in the center which counteracts a tilting of the counterpart when the screw is tightened. In addition, the configuration of the end piece and counterpart in the region of the compressed air channel makes it possible to prevent the parts of the closing element from being joined in an incorrect position.<br>
The insertion of a connecting tube into the opening of the closing element which is formed in its face end by the compressed air channel ensures the passage of compressed air between two polygonal tubes in a simple manner.<br>
A closing element of claims 6 and 7 ensures an adequate and reliable sealing effect.<br>
A closing element of claim 8 is universally suited for different types of brackets or stands.<br>
4<br><br>
A supporting contour provided on both sides of the recess of the closing element counteracts a deformation of the hollow section even in the case of an excessive starting torque of the mounting screws.<br>
The closing element is constructed such that it seals the interior of the polygonal tube toward the recess. As a result the mounting points of the polygonal tube section are arranged in a region of the closing element which does not carry compressed air. The openings in the polygonal tube through which the mounting screws of a screw connection extend between the polygonal tube and the machine need not be sealed. The shape and the position of the recess ensure an adequate staying of the end of the polygonal tube.<br>
The closing element of the invention seals the interior of the polygonal tube in a . reliable and stable manner for a long duration. Simultaneously with the sealing effect, it is possible to secure the closing element in its position against the air pressure prevailing in the interior of the polygonal tube without additional auxiliary means. A possibly needed repair of the polygonal tube that form the mounting rod is easily possible and requires little labor for disassembly and assembly also when the polygonal tube is installed as a part of a mounting rod between other polygonal rubes.<br>
Further details of the invention become apparent from the embodiment that is described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying Figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of the individual parts of a closing element before its assembly;<br>
Figure 2 is a partially sectioned view of the parts of the closing element shown in Figure 1; and<br>
Figure 3 is a sectional view of the end region of two polygonal tubes, each with a closing element, and a connecting tube section along the line A-A of Figure 1.<br>
5<br><br>
A closing element 1 comprises an end piece 2, a sealing element 3, a counterpart 4, a screw 5, and a sealing washer 6. The end piece 2 comprises a guide section 7, whose outer contour is adapted to the inner contour of a polygonal tube 8 shown in phantom lines in Figure 1. The polygonal tube 8 is made squares. Adjacent the guide section 7 is a sealing section 9 with an outer contour of the same shape. The width and height of the outer contour of sealing section 9 are made somewhat smaller than the width and height of the guide section 7. At the end of the end piece 2 that faces the sealing section 9, a stop 10 is formed, which interacts with an end face 11 of the polygonal tube 8, and prevents the closing element 1 from being pulled or pushed into the polygonal tube 8 beyond a desired position. The guide section 7 includes a recess 12. Through this recess 12 and bore holes 13, a mounting screw extends, which is not shown for reasons of simplification and which is used to secure the polygonal tube to a bracket or stand. On both sides of the recess 12 a supporting contour 14, 15 is formed which counteracts a deformation of the hollow polygonal tube 8. The recess 12 in end piece 2 is dimensioned adequately large for the mounting screw, so as to be universally suited and usable for different screw sizes and screw positions that are dependent on the design of the stands. In its center the stop 10 includes an opening of a feed channel 16 for screw 5 and in off-center relationship an outlet of a connecting channel 17 for carrying the compressed air.<br>
The contoured shape of the sealing element 3 corresponds to the polygonal tube 8 and sealing section 9 with the inner contour of the sealing element 3 being adapted to the outer contour of the sealing section 9, and the outer contour of the sealing element 3 to the inner contour of the polygonal tube 8. The sealing element 3 consists of rubber. The wall thickness T of the sealing element 3 is somewhat smaller than the spacing that is present between the inner side of the polygonal tube 8 and the outer side of the guide section 7, when the closing element 1 is inserted into the polygonal tube 8. The length L of the sealing element 3 amounts to a multiple of the wall thickness T, and is dimensioned such that the counterpart 4 can adequately bias the sealing element 3 with axial pressure.<br>
6<br><br>
The counterpart 4 comprises a hollow section 18 of the same contoured shape as the sealing element 3 and is closed at one end by a rear wall 19 as best seen in Figure 2. The rear wall 19 includes an inward directed relationship a support, element 20 and a channel element 21 with its edge 22, the hollow section 18 projects beyond the support element 20. The channel element 21 projects even beyond the edge 22. The counterpart 4 can be joined in mating relationship with the end piece 2 only, when the somewhat projecting channel element 21 assumes its correct position. In the embodiment shown in figure 1, the correct position of the channel element 21 is on the top left in the counterpart 4. This ensures the necessary flow of the compressed air. Through the center of the rear wall 19 and support element 20, a bore 23 extends, into which a screw thread is cut. Both the end piece 2 and the counterpart 4 consist of die-cast zinc.<br>
The sectional view of Figure 2 shows further details of the configuration of closing element 1. In the interior of end piece 2 the feed channel 16 changes to a smaller diameter. The transition to the smaller diameter of the feed channel 16 is shaped as a rest 24. The connection channel 17 changes to a compressed air channel 25 which has a smaller operative cross section than the connection channel 17.<br>
In the counterpart 4 one can note a passageway opening 26 for the compressed air. The channel element 21 forms a part of the extension of compressed air channel 25.<br>
When assembling the closing element 1, one begins with sliding the sealing element 3 onto the sealing section 9 of the end piece 2 as far guide section 7. subsequently one inserts the screw 5 together with the sealing washer 6 into the feed channel 16,with the sealing washer 6 being placed on rest 24. The end of screw 5 is turned into threaded bore 23 of the counterpart 4 only so far that it engages the screw thread, and that the counterpart 4 does not yet exert an axial pressure on the sealing element 3.<br>
Preassembled closing element 1 is inserted into the end of the polygonal tube 8 upto the stop 10. Subsequently, one tightens the screw 5, whose head includes a hexagon socket 27, so that the end piece 2 axially exerts with its edge 22 a pressure on the<br>
7<br><br>
sealing element 3. This causes the sealing element 3 to lie against the inner side of the polygonal tube 8 to secure the position of the closing element 1 against the air pressure developing in the interior of the polygonal tube 8 and to seal in an airtight manner between the polygonal tube 8 and the end piece 2.<br>
A closing element 1 in this state is shown in Figure 3. The compressed air is allowed to flow through the closing element 1 from the passageway opening 26, via the compressed air channel 25 to the connection channel 17 or in the opposite direction. Adjacent at a Small distance from the polygonal tube 8 is a second polygonal tube 28. A closing element 29 inserted into the polygonal tube 28 is made mirror-inverted with closing element 1. The closing element 1 and closing element 29 are interconnected by a connection tube 30, which is inserted with its ends into the connection channel 17 and connection channel 31. With that compressed air is allowed to flow unimpeded between the polygonal tube 8 and polygonal tube 28 through compressed air channels 25 and 33. The connection tube 30 is sealed by means of O-ring seals 32 as disclosed in DE 198 30 048 Al.<br>
The invention is not limited to the described embodiments. Within the scope of the invention, alternative configurations are possible, in particular of the end piece and the counterpart.<br>
