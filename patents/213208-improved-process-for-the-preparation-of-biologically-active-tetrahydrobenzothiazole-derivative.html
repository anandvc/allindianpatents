The following specification particularly describes the nature of This invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of (S)-(-)-2-Amino-6-(n-prqpyamino)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzothiazole of formula (I) and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates and (S)- 2,6-diamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro benzothiazole an intermediate compound of formula II for formation of Pramipexole of Formula (I). The compound of formula I is commonly known as Pramipexole which is used in the chemotherapy of Parkinson" b disease and schizophrenia .More particularly, the present invention is pertaining to an improved process for the preparation of Pramipexole dihydrochloride<br><br><br><br>
H3C<br><br><br>
(")<br><br>
(H)<br><br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
A general process for the preparation of compounds of formula (I) and (II) has been described in US '4*86812, EP 186087 and EP 207696 . The process comprises the protection of amino function of 4-aminocyclohexanol (III) to give the compound of formula (IVa) wherein, R\ is acyl or alkoxycarbonyl and R2 is hydrogen or R\ and R2 together form an amino protective group such as pthalimido group which on oxidation with an oxidising agent, followed by halogenatio. (preferably bromination) of protected ketone of formula (Va) to give alpha halogenatedketone (Via) which on reaction with thiourea, followed by deprotection yielded the racemic 2,6-diaminotetrahydrobenzothiole (VIII). Reductive alkylation of (VIII) with n-propanal furnished the racemic pramipexole . Although the (S) isomer of pramipexole is mentioned therein, it is not clasr A what stage the chiral resolution i.e, stage (VIII) or at final stage has been carried out. The general process steps are indicated in Scheme-1 below.<br>
2<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Another process for preparing optically pure pramipexole dihydrochloride was disclosed in J. Med. Chem. 1987, 30,494-498 , where in, racemic 2,6-diamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro benzothiazole was resolved, using L (+) tartaric acid to give optically pure (S)- 2,6-diamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro benzothiazole which was converted to optically pure pramipexole by reacting (S)- 2,6-diamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro benzothiazole with propionic anhydride in THF and followed by reduction with borane THF complex . The reaction steps are shown in Scheme-2 as under:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
3<br><br>
The processes described above, suffer with the following drawbacks:<br>
(i)       Although, phthalamido protected 4-aminocyclohexanol gives better yield compared to monoprotected 4-aminocyclohexanol during oxidation and halogenation, the protection of 4-aminocyclohexanol with phthalic anhydride requires longer duration, approximately 36 hrs, hence will increase utility, manpower &amp; overall cost of production. Furthermore, the efforts to repeat the reaction in the reported conditions were futile, <br>
(ii)      Bromination is carried out with hydrobromic acid in acetic acid, which is corrosive in nature.   Work up of the reaction is very tedious. Moreover, diethyl ether has been used to remove the impurities.  Diethyl ether is highly flammable and has low flash point, hence caused fire hazards at commercial scale, <br>
(iii)     Moreover,      2-amino-6-phthalimido-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro,     benzothiazole     requires laborious column chromatography to isolate and purify the 2-amino-6-phthalimido-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro benzothiazole. Use of column chromatography is not feasible at commercial scale and gives low yield i.e. 50%. <br>
(iv)      Yet another disadvantage of the process lies in preparation and isolation of 2,6-diamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro benzothiazole dihydrochloride as it also requires column chromatography and give very poor yield i.e. 26%. Overall, the process disclosed in US 4886812, EP 186087 and EP 207696 for the preparation of pramipexole, are lengthy, low yielding, requires laborious column chromatography for several steps and use of corrosive and highly flammable materials. Therefore, there is a need to develop a process for preparing pramipexole and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, which should be free from the above mentioned defects and should be simple, cost effective, high yielding and does not involve laborious column chromatography. Also, process should be devoid of highly flammable and corrosive material for commercial production. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus one object of the invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of (S)-2,6-diamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro benzothiazole of formula (II), which is a key intermediate for the synthesis of Pramipexole.<br>
4<br><br>
Another object of this invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of pramipexole of formula (I) and its pharmaceutic ally acceptable salts, solvates if desired free from the above-mentioned defects.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide commercially viable process for the preparation of pramipexole and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates.<br>
Yet another object of the process is to reduce the time of condensation of phthalic anhydride with 4-aminocyclohexanole.<br>
Yet another object of the process is to simplify the work up of halogenation without using flammable solvent.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of Pramipexole, devoid of column chromatography at every stage of the process.<br>
Further object of the invention is to overcome the problems associated with prior art process and to prepare Pramipexole by cost effective way.<br>
In summary, the object of the present invention is to provide a simple, efficient, cost effective, devoid of corrosive, highly inflammable material, high yielding process for the preparation of Pramipexole of formula (I) and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates.<br>
