METHOD FOR THE PRODUCTION OF VITAMIN K^DEPENDENT PROTEINS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel method for preparing vitamin K-dependent proteins and in particular coagulation factor VII (FVII). Furthermore the present invention re¬lates to novel co-transfected eucaryotic host cells and recombinant vectors to be used in this improved method for preparing vitamin K-dependent proteins.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The biosynthesis of vitamin K-dependent proteins includes several posttranslational processing steps before a mature functional protein is obtained.<br>
Vitamin K is a necessary cofactor for the gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues in these vitamin K-dependent proteins, including the procoagulant factors thrombin, factor VII. IX, and X; the anticoagulants protein C and protein S; and other proteins such as osteocalcin (bone Gla protein), matrix Gla protein, and proline-rich Gla protein 1. This car-boxylation is required for normal hemostasis, because it enables calcium binding and at¬tachment of the procoagulants and anticoagulants to phospholipids.<br>
Gamma-glutamyl carboxylase is an integral membrane microsomal enzyme located in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It carboxylates glutamate residues located in the Gla domain of the vitamin K-dependent proteins. Human gamma-glutamyl carboxylase cDNA has recently been isolated and sequenced (Wu SM et al. Science 254:1634, 1991). Studies of the biosynthesis of Vitamin K-dependent proteins in BHK and CHO cells, shovi/ that the car¬boxylase is present in both the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex, and that the propeptide, containing the carboxylase recognition site is cleaved after completion of the gamma-carboxylation.<br>
It has been speculated whether the propeptide can stimulate the carboxylase activity (Sigiura. I. et al. (1997) Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci,, 9, 9069-9074. Knobloch and Suttie (1987) J.Biol.Chem. 262. 15334-19337. Furie et al (1999) Blood, 93, 1798-1808).<br>
Blood coagulation is a process consisting of a complex interaction of various blood components, or factors, which eventually gives rise to a fibrin clot. Generally, the blood com¬ponents which participate in what has been referred to as the coagulation "cascade" are pro-enzymes or zymogens, enzymatically inactive proteins which are converted to proteolytic en¬zymes by the action of an activator, itself an activated clotting factor. Coagulation factors that have undergone such a conversion and generally referred to as 'active factors," and are des¬ignated by the addition of a lower case "a" suffix (e.g., activated factor VII (FVIIa)).<br><br>
Activated factor X (FXa) is required to convert prothrombin to thrombin, which then converts fibrinogen to fibrin as a final stage in forming a fibrin clot. There are two systems, or pathways, that promote the activation of FX. The "intrinsic pathway" refers to those reactions that lead to thrombin formation through utilization of factors present only in plasma. A series of protease-mediated activations ultimately generates factor IXa which, in conjunction with factor Villa, cleaves FX into FXa. A similar proteolysis is effected by FVila and its co-factor, tissue factor, in the "extrinsic pathway" of blood coagulation. Tissue factor is a membrane bound protein and does not normally circulate in plasma. Upon vessel disruption, however, it can complex with FVIIa to catalyze FX activation or factor IX activation in the presence of Ca++ and phospholipid. While the relative importance of the two coagulation pathways in hemostasis is unclear, in recent years FVII and tissue factor have been found to play a piv¬otal role in the regulation of blood coagulation.<br>
FVII is a trace plasma glycoprotein that circulates in blood as a single-chain zymo¬gen. The zymogen is clot inactive. Single-chain FVII may be converted to two-chain FVIIa by FXa, factor Xlla, factor IXa or thrombin in vitro. FXa is believed to be the major physiological activator of FVIL Like several other plasma proteins involved in hemostasis, FVII is depend¬ent en vitamin K for its biosynthesis, which is required for the gamma-carboxyiation of 10 glu¬tamic acid residues in the amino terminus of the protein. The intracellular post-translational processing of FVII takes place in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex. Besides the vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylation, FVII is subjected to limited proteoly¬sis to remove the N-terminal propeptide, and glycosylation of asparagine-145 and -322, and serine-52 and -60 (fig 1).<br>
The gamma-carboxylated glutamic acid (Gla) residues are required for the metal-associated interaction of FVII with phospholipids.<br>
In the presence of tissue factor, phospholipids and calcium ions, the two-chain FVIIa rapidly activates FX or factor IX by limited proteolysis.<br>
Protein C is a serine protease and naturally occurring anticoagulant that plays a role in the regulation of homeostasis by inactivating factors Va and Villa in the coagulation cas¬cade. Human protein C is made in vivo primarily in the liver as a single polypeptide of 461 amino acids. This single chain precursor molecule undergoes multiple post-translational modifications including carboxylation of nine glutamic acid residues, resulting in nine Gla residues.<br>
Protein S also exhibits anticoagulant activity in in vitro clotting assays. Protein S demonstrates anticoagulant cofactor activity for activated protein C. Protein S has also been shown to be an anticoagulant factor in the absence of activated protein C as it can inhibit prothrombinase activity in assays free of activated protein C and binds to Factor Va or Factor Xa and functions as an anticoagulant without activated protein C.<br><br>
Protein S is physiologically a very important antithrombotic factor since hereditary or ac¬quired deficiencies of protein S are associated with venous and arterial thrombotic disease. A deficiency of free protein S with a normal level of total protein S has been described in some patients with thrombotic disease.<br>
It is often necessary to selectively block the coagulation cascade in a patient. Anti¬coagulants such as protein C or protein S may be used, for example, during kidney dialysis, or to treat deep vein thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a patient at risk for acute thrombosis, protein S deficiency, sepsis, inflammation, cancer, patients under¬going surgery and a host of other medical disorders.<br>
Osteocalcin is composed of 49 amino acid residues which include three Gla resi¬dues. The function of this protein is thought to be to suppress excessive mineralization. Os¬teocalcin is a bone-specific protein that is secreted by osteoblasts. A fraction of newly syn¬thesized osteocalcin is released into the bloodstream, where its concentration correlates with the indices of osteoblastic activity and bone formation rate. In humans, changes in circulating osteocalcin levels have been associated with metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis and hyperparathyroidism.<br>
Matrix Gla Protein (MGP) is composed of 79 amino acids including 5 Gla residues. This protein is usually found in demineralized matrix and believed to have a certain function in the initiation of bone formation.<br>
There is still a need in the art for improved systems for the production of recombi¬nant vitamin K-dependent proteins and particular recombinant coagulation factors. The pre¬sent invention fulfills this need by providing a method that gives a more efficient, faster pro¬duction and/or higher yield of recombinant vitamin K-dependent proteins, in particular FVII,<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel method for preparing vitamin K-dependent proteins and in particular coagulation factor VII (FVII).<br>
The N-terminal processing steps and in particular the gamma-carboxylation of glu¬tamic acid residues of vitamin K-dendent proteins have been shown to be the limiting steps in the biosynthesis of these proteins, as exemplified with FVII by the present inventors. A method for increasing the gamma-carboxylation have been shown to increase the expression of recombinant vitamin K-dependent proteins.<br>
The propeptide of the vitamin K-dendent proteins is essential for binding to the car¬boxylase, and it has to be covalently attached to the vitamin K-dependent protein in order for the Glu residues, in what will become the N-terminal of the later mature protein, to be car-boxylated. We hypothesize that the free propeptide functions as an allosteric regulating<br><br>
molecule in the sense that when the concentration of free propeptide increases the activity of the gamma-carboxylation process also increases.<br>
A direct Increase in the concentration of free propeptides can be obtained by co-expression of free propeptide(s) per se. This can be done by transfection with the polynu¬cleotide encoding free propeptide(3) with or without mutations and truncations, In one or more copies, and co-express this together wrth a polynucleotide encoding the vitamin K-dependent protein. The latter might contain another propeptide sequence, than that normally associated with the vitamin K-dependent protein. Expression of a polynucleotide encoding the vitamin K-dependent protein can be obtained either by transfecting the gene of interest into a cell or by activating (i,e., turning on) an endogenous gene encoding the vitamin K-dependent protein already present in primary, secondary, or immortalized cells of vertebrate origin, which is normally not expressed in the cells or is not expressed at physiologically sig¬nificant levels in the cells as obtained. For activating genes of interest, homologous recombi¬nation can be used to replace or disable the regulatory region normally associated with the gene in cells as obtained with a regulatory sequence which causes the gene to be expressed at levels higher than evident in the con'esponding nontransfected ceil, or to display a pattern of regulation or induction that is different than evident in the corresponding nontransfected cell.<br>
In a first aspect, the invention relates to a eucaryotic host cell expressing a first polynucleotide encoding a first propeptide and FVll or variants thereof in a first expression unit and expressing a second polynucleotide encoding a second free propeptide in a second expression unit. It is to be understood that the first polynucleotide is located in a first expres¬sion unit and that the second polynucleotide is located in a second expression unit, wherein the first and second expression units are different.<br>
In second aspect, the invention relates to a eucaryotic host cell transfected with a first polynucleotide encoding a first propeptide and FVl) or variants thereof in a first expres¬sion unit and transfected with a second polynucleotide encoding a second free propeptide in a second expression unit. It is to be understood that-the first polynucleotide is located in a first expression unit and that the second polynucleotide is located in a second expression unit, wherein the first and second expression units are different. The actual order of transfec¬tion is off course trivial and thus, the host cell may be transfected first with the second polynucleotide or vice versa. The use of the terms "first propeptide" and "second propeptide" are merely out of convenience, thus the first and second propeptide may be the same or dif¬ferent.<br>
The term **a eucaryotic host celf, as used herein, represent any cell, including hybrid cells, in which heterologous DMA can be expressed. Typical host cells includes, but are not limited to insect cells, yeast cells, mammalian cells, including human cells, such as BHK.<br><br>
CHO, HEK, and COS cells, in practicing the present invention, the host cells being cultivated are preferably mammalian cells, more preferably an established mammalian cell line, includ¬ing, without limitation, CHO (e.g., ATCC CCL 61), COS-1 (e.g., ATCC CRL 1650), baby hamster kidney (BHK) and HEK293 (e.g., ATCC CRL 1573; Graham et al., J. Gen. Virol. 36:59-72, 1977) ceil lines.<br>
A preferred BHK cell line is the tk' ts13 BHK ceil line (Waechter and Baserga, Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA 79:1106-1110. 1982). hereinafter referred to as BHK 570 cells. The BHK 570 cell line is available from the American Type Culture Collection. 12301 Parklawn Dr.. Rockviile. MD 20852, under ATCC accession number CRL 10314. A tk' ts13 BHK cell line is also available from the ATCC under accession number CRL 1632.<br>

Namalwa cells, myelomas and fusions of myelomas with other ceils.<br>
The term "a polynucleotide" denotes a single- or double-stranded polymer of deoxy-ribonucleotide or ribonucleotide bases read from the 5' to the 3' end. Polynucleotides include RNA and DNA, and may be isolated from natural sources, synthesized in vitro, or prepared from a combination of natural and synthetic molecules. The length of a polynucleotide mole¬cule is given herein in terms of nucleotides (abbreviated *'nt") or base pairs (abbreviated "bp"). The term "nucleotides" is used for both single- and double-stranded molecules where the context permits. When the term is applied to double-stranded molecules it is used to de¬note overall length and will be understood to be equivalent to the term "base pairs". It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that the two strands of a double-stranded polynucleo¬tide may differ slightly in length and that the ends thereof may be staggered as a result of enzymatic cleavage; thus all nucleotides within a double-stranded polynucleotide molecule may not be paired. Such unpaired ends will in general not exceed 20 nt in length.<br>
The term "a propeptide^ as used herein, represent any amino acid sequence, which can bind a gamma-glutamyl carboxylase. Typical propeptides that directs a gamma-carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent proteins, are found at the N-terminal of a vitamin K-dependent protein and serves as a docking site or recognition sequence for interaction with gamma-glutamyl carboxylase, which carboxylatesglutamate residues usaliy located in the Gla domain of vitamin K-dependent proteins. There may be more than one binding sites for the gamma-glutamyl carboxylase, e.i. gamma-glutamyl carboxylase recognition sequence, in one propeptide. One example of a propeptide within this definition is thus the natural propeptide sequence of FVII. Another example within this definition is the natural propeptide<br><br>
sequence of FVII connected to the natural propeptide sequence of factor IX within the same amino acid sequence.<br>
The term "free propeptide", as used herein, is intended to mean a propeptide which is not connected to a vitamin K-dependent protein to be gamma-carboxylated. An example of a free propeptide is thus the propeptide of FVH without being connected to the amino acid sequence of FVU.<br>

The term "factor Vila", or "FVIIa" as used herein means a prod¬uct consisting of the activated form (factor Vlla). This includes proteins that have the amino acid sequence 1-406 of native human factor FVII or FVlla. It also includes proteins with a slightly modified amino acid sequence, for instance, a modified N-terminal end including N-terminal amino acid deletions or additions so long as those proteins substantially retain the activity of FVIIa. "FVII" or "FVIIa" within the above definition also includes natural allelic varia¬tions that may exist and occur from one individual to another. Also, degree and location of glycosylation or other post-translation modifications may vary depending on the chosen host cells and the nature of the host cellular environment.<br>
The tenm "variants", as used herein, is intended to designate FVII wherein one or more amino acid residues of the parent protein have been substituted by another amino acid residue and/or wherein one or more amino acid residues of the parent protein have been deleted and/or wherein one or more amino acid residues have been added to the parent protein. Such addition can take place either at the N-terminal end or at the C-terminal end of the parent protein or both.<br>
The term "an expression unit", as used herein, means a polynucleotide comprising the following operably linked elements: (a) a transcription promoter; (b) a polynucleotide sequence encoding an amino acid sequence; and (c) a transcription terminator An example of an expression unit is thus a DNA vector comprising the following linked elements: (a) a transcription promoter, (b) a cDNA sequence encoding a free propeptide; and (c) a transcription tenninator.<br>
The term "a vector, as used herein, means any nucleic acid entity capable of the amplification in a host cell. Thus, the vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e. a vector, which exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g. a plasmid. Alternatively, the vector may be one which, when introduced into a host cell, is integrated into the host cell genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated. The choice of vector will often depend on the host cell into which it is to be introduced. Vectors include, but are not limited to plasmid vectors, phage vectors, vimses or cosmid vectors. Vectors usually contains a replication origin and at least one selectable gene, i.e., a gene which encodes a product which is readily detectable or the presence of which is essential for cell growth.<br><br>
The term "a promoter" denotes a portion of a gene containing DNA sequences that provide for the binding of RNA polymerase and initiation of transcription. Promoter se¬quences are commonly, but not always, found in the 5' non-coding regions of genes.<br>

The term "binding sequence for a gamma-glutamyl carboxylase" as used herein means the nessesary amino acid residues within a sequence (i,e. recognition sequence) for binding or docking or interaction with a gamma-giutamyl carboxylase.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention the first propeptide has a higher affinity (as measured by the inhibition constant (K)) for the carboxylase than the second free propeptide. Provided there are two separable functions of the propeptides of vitamin K-dependent pro¬teins on the carboxylase, substrate binding and activity regulation, different affinities and concentrations of the covalently attached propeptide and of the free propeptide might influ¬ence the overall capacity of a producer cell to carboxylate recombinant vitamin K-dependent protein. Co-expression of free propeptide and covalently attached propeptide, and combina¬tions thereof might increase the production of functional recombinant FVll (rFVII). In order not to inhibit the carboxylation of the newly synthesized Glu-containing vitamin K-dependent protein it is preferred that the second free propeptide has a lower affinity than the propeptide covalently attached to the vitamin K-dependent protein to be gamma-carboxylated.<br>
Ki for free propeptides are determined according to Stanley et al (Biochemistry, 38,<br>
15681-15687(1999) and J.Biol.Chem. 274, 16940-16944.)<br>
In a further embodiment the free propeptide to be co-expressed with the vitamin K-dependent protein are preferably selected from the lists as summarized in table 2 and 3:<br><br><br><br><br>
The invention also relates to a method of preparing vitamin K-dependent proteins as mentioned above. The vitamin K-dependent proteins are preferably produced by recombinant DNA techniques. To this end, DNA sequences encoding the vitamin K-dependent proteins may be isolated by preparing a genomic or cDNA library and screening for DNA sequences coding for all or part of the protein by hybridization using synthetic oligonucleotide probes in accordance with standard techniques (cf. Sambrook at al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989), For the present purpose, the DNA sequence encoding the protein is preferably of human origin, i.e. derived from a human genomic DNA or cDNA library.<br>
The invention also relates to a method of activating (i.e., turning on) a gene encoding a vitamin K-dependent protein present in primary, secondary, or immortalized cells of vertebrate origin, which is normally not expressed in the cells or is not expressed at physiologically significant levels in the cells as obtained. Homologous recombination can be used to replace or disable the regulatory region normally associated with the gene in cells as obtained with a regulatory sequence which causes the gene to be expressed at levels higher than evident in the corresponding nontransfected cell, or to display a pattern of regulation or induction that is different than evident in the corresponding nontransfected cell. The invention, therefore, also relates to a method of preparing vitamin K-dependent proteins by turning on or activating an endogenous gene which encodes the vitamin K-dependent protein in transfected primary, secondary, or immortalized cells. Activation of endogenous genes may be performed as described in US 5,968.502The DNA sequences encoding the vitamin K-dependent proteins may also be prepared synthetically by established standard methods, e.g. the phosphoamidite method described by Beaucage and Caruthers, Tetrahedron Letters 22<br><br>
(1981), 1859-1869, or the method described by Matthes et al.. EMBQ Journal 3 (1984), 801 -805. According to the phosphoamidite method, oligonucieotides are synthesized, e.g. in an automatic DMA synthesizer, purtfied, annealed, irgated and cloned in suitable vectors.<br>
The DNA sequences may also be prepared by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers, for instance as described In US 4.683.202, Saiki et al, Science 239 (1988), 487 - 491. or Sambrook et al., supra.<br>
The DNA sequences encoding the vitamin K-dependent proteins are usually inserted into a recombinant vector which may be any vector, which may conveniently be subjected to recombinant DNA procedures, and the choice of vector will often depend on the host celi into which it is to be introduced. Thus, the vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e. a vector, which exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which (s independent of chromosomal replication, e.g. a plasmid. Alternatively, the vector may be one which, when introduced into a host cell, is integrated into the host cell genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated.<br>
The vector is preferably an expression vector in which the DNA sequence encoding the vitamin K-dependent proteins is operably linked to additional segments required for transcription of the DNA. In general, the expression vector is derived from plasmid or viral DNA, or may contain elements of both. The term "operably linked' indicates that the segments are arranged so that they function in concert for their Intended purposes, e.g. transcription initiates in a promoter and proceeds through the DNA sequence coding for the polypeptide.<br>
The promoter may be any DNA sequence, which shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice and may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to the host cell.<br>
Examples of suitable promoters for directing the transcription of the DNA encoding the vitamin K-dependent protein in mammalian ceils are the SV40 promoter (Subramanl et al., Mgl. Cell Biol. 1 (1981), 854 -864), the MT-I (metallothionein gene) promoter (Palmiter et al., Sdence 222 (1983), 809 - 814), the CMV promoter (Boshart et a!., Cell 41:521-530, 1985) or the adenovirus 2 major late promoter (Kaufman and Sharp, Mol, Cell. Biol, 2:1304-1319, 1982).<br>
An example of a suitable promoter for use in insect cells is the polyhedrin promoter (US 4.745,051; Vasuvedan et aL. FEBSLett. 311., (1992) 7 -11), the PI0 promoter (J.M. Vlak et al., J. Gen. Virologv 69. 1988, pp. 765-776), the Autographa califomica polyhedrosis virus basic protein promoter (EP 397 485), the bacuiovirus immediate earty gene 1 promoter (US 5.155,037; US 5,162,222), or the bacuiovirus 39K delayed-eariy gene promoter (US 5,155,037; US 5,162.222).<br>
Examples of suitable promoters for use in yeast host cells include promoters from yeast glycolytic genes (Hitzeman et al., J, Biol, Chem. 255 (1980), 12073 -12080; Alber and<br><br>
Kawasaki. J. Mol. Appl. Gen. 1 (1982). 419 - 434) or alcohol dehydrogenase genes (Young et al., in Genetic Engineering of Microorganisms for Chemicals (Hollaender et al, eds.), Plenum Press. New York. 1982). or the IPM (US 4.599.311) or ADH2'4c (Russell et al.. Nature 304 (1983). 652 - 654) promoters.<br>
Examples of suitable promoters for use in filamentous fungus host cells are, for instance, the APH3 promoter (McKnighl et al., The EMBO J. 4 (1985). 2093 - 2099) or the tpiA promoter. Examples of other useful promoters are those derived from the gene encoding A, oryzae TAKA amylase, Rhizomucor miehei aspartic proteinase, A. ni'ger neutral a-amylase, A. niger acid stable a-amylase, A. niger or A. awa/nonglucoamylase (gluA), Rhizomucor miehei lipase, A. oryzsie alkaline protease. A, or/zae triose phosphate isomerase or A, nidulans acetamidase. Preferred are the TAKA-amylase and giuA promoters. Suitable promoters are mentioned in, e.g. EP 238 023 and EP 383 779.<br>
The DNA sequences encoding the vitamin K-dependent proteins may also, if necessary, be operably connected to a suitable terminator, such as the human growth hormone terminator (Palmiter et al,. Science 222.1983. pp. 809-814) or the TPI1 (Alber and Kawasaki, J, Mol. Appl. Gen. 1. 1982. pp. 419^34) or ADH3 (McKnight et al.. The EMBO J. 4. 1985. pp. 2093-2099) terminators. The vector may also contain a set of RNA splice sites located downstream from the promoter and upstream from the Insertion site for the FVII sequence itself. Prefen-ed RNA splice sites may be obtained from adenovirus and/or immunoglobulin genes. Also contained in the expression vectors is a polyadenylation signal located downstream of the insertion site. Particularly preferred polyadenylation signals include the early or late polyadenylation signal from SV40 (Kaufman and Sharp, ibid,), the polyadenylation signal from the adenovirus 5 Elb region, the human growth hormone gene terminator (DeNoto et al. Nuc. Acids Res. 9:3719-3730. 1981) or the polyadenylation signal from the human FVII gene or the bovine FVII gene. The expression vectors may also include a noncoding viral leader sequence, such as the adenovirus 2 tripartite leader. located between the promoter and the RNA splice sites; and enhancer sequences, such as the SV40 enhancer<br>
The recombinant vector may further comprise a DNA sequence enabling the vector to replicate in the host cell in question. An example of such a sequence (when the host cell is a mammalian cell) is the SV40 origin of replication.<br>
When the host cell is a yeast cell, suitable sequences enabling the vector to replicate are the yeast plasmid 2\x replication genes  REP 1-3 and origin of replication.<br>
The vector may also comprise a selectable marker, e.g. a gene the product of which complements a defect in the host cell, such as the gene coding for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) or the Schizosaccharomyces pombe TPI gene (described by P.R. Russell, Gene 40, 1985, pp. 125-130), or one which confers resistance to a dnjg, e.g. ampicillin, kanamycin.<br><br>
tetracyclin, chloramphenicol, neomycin, hygromycin or methotrexate. For filamentous fungi, selectable markers include amdS. pvrG. argB. niaD or sC.<br>
To direct the vitamin K-dependent proteins of the present invention into the secretory pathway of the host cells, a secretory signal sequence (also known as a leader sequence, prepro sequence or pre sequence) may be provided in the recombinant vector. The secretory signal sequence is joined to the DNA sequences encoding the vitamin K-dependent proteins in the correct reading frame. Secretory signal sequences are commonly positioned 5' to the DNA sequence encoding the peptide. The secretory signal sequence may be that, normally associated with the protein or may be from a gene encoding another secreted protein.<br>
For secretion from yeast cells, the secretory signal sequence may encode any signal peptide, which ensures efficient direction of the expressed vitamin K-dependent proteins into the secretory pathway of the cell. The signal peptide may be naturally occuning signal peptide, or a functional part thereof, or it may be a synthetic peptide. Suitable signal peptides have been found to be the a-factor signal peptide (cf. US 4,870,008), the signal peptide of mouse salivary amylase (cf. O. Hagenbuchle et al.. Nature 289.1981, pp. 643-646), a modified carboxypeptidase signal peptide (cf. L.A. Vails et al.. Cell 48, 1987, pp. 887-897), the yeast BAR1 signal peptide (cf. WO 87/02670), or the yeast aspartic protease 3 (YAP3) signal peptide (cf. M. Egel-Mitani et al.. Yeast 6. 1990. pp. 127-137).<br>
For efficient secretion in yeast, a sequence encoding a leader peptide may also be inserted downstream of the signal sequence and upstream of the DNA sequence encoding the vitamin K-dependent proteins. The function of the leader peptide is to allow the expressed peptide to be directed from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and further to a secretory vesicle for secretion into the culture medium (i.e. exportation of the vitamin K-dependent proteins across the cell wall or at least through the cellular membrane into the periplasmic space of the yeast cell). The leader peptide may be the yeast a-factor leader (the use of which is described in e.g. US 4,546,082. US 4.870,008, EP 16 201, EP 123 294, EP 123 544 and EP 163 529). Alternatively, the leader peptide may be a synthetic leader peptide, which is to say a leader peptide not found in nature. Synthetic leader peptides may. for instance, be constnjcted as described in WO 89/02463 or WO 92/11378.<br>
For use in filamentous fungi, the signal peptide may conveniently be derived from a gene encoding an Aspergillus sp. amylase or glucoamylase, a gene encoding a Rhizomucor miehei lipase or protease or a Humicola lanuginosa lipase. The signal peptide is preferably derived from a gene encoding A. oryzae JAKA amylase, A. niger neutral a-amylase, A. niger acid-stable amylase, or^. n/ger glucoamylase. Suitable signal peptides are disclosed in, e.g. EP 238 023 and EP 215 594.<br><br>
For use in insect cells, the signal peptide may conveniently be derived from an insect gene {cf. WO 90/05783). such as the lepidopteran Manduca sexta adipokinetic hormone precursor signal peptide (cf. US 5,023,328).<br>
The procedures used to ligate the DNA sequences coding for the vitamin K-dependent proteins, the promoter and optionally the terminator and/or secretory signal sequence, respectively, and to insert them into suitable vectors containing the information necessary for replication, are well known to persons skilled in the art (cf.. for instance, Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratony Manual. Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989).<br>
Methods of transfecting mammalian cells and expressing DNA sequences introduced in the cells are described in e.g. Kaufman and Sharp, J. Mol. Biol. 159 (1982), 601 - 621; Southern and Berg. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1 (1982). 327 - 341; Loyter et a!.. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79 (1982), 422 - 426; Wigler et al.. Cell 14 (1978), 725; Corsaro and Pearson, Somatic Cell Genetics 7 (1981), 603. Graham and van der Eb. Virolopv 52 (1973). 456; and Neumann et al., EMBQ J. 1 (1982), 841 - 845.<br>
Selectable markers may be introduced into the cell on a separate plasmid at the same time as the gene of interest, or they may be introduced on the same plasmid. If on the same plasmid, the selectable marker and the gene of interest may be under the control of different promoters or the same promoter, the latter arrangement producing a dicistronic message. Constructs of this type are known in the art (for example, Levinson and Simonsen, U.S. Pat. No. 4.713,339). It may also be advantageous to add additional DNA, known as "carrier DNA," to the mixture that is introduced into the cells.<br>
After the cells have taken up the DNA, they are grown in an appropriate growth me¬dium, typically 1-2 days, to begin expressing the gene of interest. As used herein the term "appropriate growth medium" means a medium containing nutrients and other components required for the growth of cells and the expression of the vitamin K-dependent protein of in¬terest. Media generally include a carbon source, a nitrogen source, essential amino acids, essential sugars, vitamins, salts, phospholipids, protein and growth factors. For production of gamma-carboxylated proteins, the medium will contain vitamin K, preferably at a concentra¬tion of about 0.1 µg/ml to about 5 µg/mL Drug selection is then applied to select for the growth of cells that are expressing the selectable marker in a stable fashion. For cells that have been transfected with an amplifiable selectable marker the drug concentration may be increased to select for an increased copy number of the cloned sequences, thereby increas¬ing expression levels. Clones of stably transfected cells are then screened for expression of the vitamin K-dependent protein of interest.<br>
The host cell into which the DNA sequences encoding the vitamin K-dependent pro¬teins is introduced may be any cell, which is capable of producing the posttranslational modified vitamin K-dependent proteins and includes yeast, fungi and higher eucaryotic cells.<br><br>
Examples of mammalian cell lines for use in the present invention are the COS-1 (ATCC CRL 1650), baby hamster kidney (BHK) and 293 (ATCC CRL 1573; Graham et a(., J. Gen. Virol. 36:59-72, 1977) cell lines. A preferred BHK cell line is the tk.sup.- ts13 BHK cell line (Waechter and Baserga, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79:1106-1110, 1982. incorporated herein by reference), hereinafter referred to as BHK 570 cells. The BHK 570 cell line has been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Dr., Rockvilie, Md. 20852, under ATCC accession number CRL 10314. A tk.sup.- ts13 BHK ceil line is also available from the ATCC under accession number CRL 1632. In addition, a number of other cell lines may be used within the present invention, including Rat Hep I (Rat hepatoma; ATCC CRL 1600), Rat Hep U (Rat hepatoma; ATCC CRL 1548), TCMK (ATCC CCL 139), Human lung (ATCC HB 8065), NCTC 1469 (ATCC CCL 9,1), CHO (ATCC CCL 61) and DUKX cells (Uriaub and Chasin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216-4220, 1980).<br>
Examples of suitable yeasts cells include cells of Saccharomyces spp, or Schizosac-charomyces spp., in particular strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Saccharomyces kluyveri. Methods for transforming yeast cells with heterologous DNA and producing heterologous poly¬peptides there from are described, e.g. in US 4,599,311, US 4.931.373, US 4.870,006. 5,037,743, and US 4,845»075, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Transformed cells are selected by a phenotype determined by a selectable marker, commonly drug resis¬tance or the ability to grow in the absence of a particular nutrient, e.g. leucine. A preferred vec¬tor for use in yeast is the P0T1 vector disclosed in US 4,931.373. The DNA sequences encod¬ing the vitamin K-dependent proteins may be preceded by a signal sequence and optionally a leader sequence, e.g. as described above. Further examples of suitable yeast ceils are strains of Kluyveromyces, such as K lactis, Hansenula, e.g. H polymorpha, or Pichia, e.g. P. pastoris (cf. Gleeson et aL. J. Gen. Microbiol. 132.1986, pp. 3459-3465; US 4,882,279).<br>
Examples of other fungal cells are cells of filamentous fungi, e.g. Aspergillus spp., Neurospora spp.. Fusarium spp. or Trichodemia spp., in particular strains of A. oryzae, A, nidulans or A. niger The use of Aspergillus spp. for the expression of proteins is described in, e.g., EP 272 277. EP 238 023, EP 184 438 The transfonnation of F. oxysporum may. for instance, be carried out as described by Malardier et al., 1989, Gene 78: 147-156. The transformation of Trichodemia spp. may be performed for instance as described in EP 244 234.<br>
When a filamentous fungus is used as the host cell, it may be transformed with the DNA construct of the invention, conveniently by integrating the DNA construct in the host chromosome to obtain a recombinant host cell. This integration is generally considered to be an advantage as the DNA sequence is more likely to be stably maintained in the cell. Integration of the DNA constructs into the host chromosome may be performed according to conventional methods, e.g. by homologous or heterologous recombination.<br><br>
Transformation of insect ceils and production of heterologous polypeptides therein may be performed as described in US 4,745,051; US 4,879.236; US 5.155.037; 5.162,222; EP 397.485) all of which are incorporated herein by reference. The insect cell line used as the host may suitably be a Lepidoptera cell line, such as Spodoptera frugiperda ceils or Trichoplusia ni cells (cf. US 5,077,214). Culture conditions may suitably be as described in, for instance, WO 89/01029 or WO 89/01028, or any of the aforementioned references.<br>
The transfonned or transfected host cell described above is then cultured in a suitable nutrient medium under conditions permitting expression of the vitamin K-dependent protein after which all or part of the resulting peptide may be recovered from the culture. The medium used to culture the cells may be any conventional medium suitable for growing the host cells, such as minimal or complex media containing appropriate supplements. Suitable media are available from commercial suppliers or may be prepared according to published recipes (e.g. in catalogues of the American Type Culture Collection). The vitamin K-dependent protein produced by the cells may then be recovered from the culture medium by conventional procedures including separating the host cells from the medium by centrifugation or filtration, precipitating the proteinaqueous components of the supernatant or filtrate by means of a salt, e.g. ammonium sulphate, purification by a variety of chromatographic procedures, e.g. ion exchange chromatography, geffiltration chromatography, affinity chromatography, or the like, dependent on the type of polypeptide in question.<br>
For the preparation of recombinant human R/11 or variants thereof, a cloned wild-type FVII DNA sequence is used. This sequence may be modified to encode the desired FVll protein or variants thereof. The sequence is then inserted into an expression vector, which is in turn transformed or transfected into host cells. Higher eucaryotic cells, in particular cul¬tured mammalian cells, are preferred as host cells. The complete nucleotide and amino acid sequences for human FVI! are known. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,784,950, which is incorporated herein by reference, where the cloning and expression of recombinant human FVll is de¬scribed. The bovine FVll sequence is described in Takeya et al., J. Biol. Chem. 263:14868-14872 (1988). which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The amino acid sequence alterations may be accomplished by a variety of tech¬niques. Modification of the DNA sequence may be by site-specific mutagenesis. Techniques for site-specific mutagenesis are well known in the art and are described by, for example, Zoller and Smith (DNA 3:479*488, 1984). Thus, using the nucleotide and amino acid se¬quences of FVll, one may introduce the alterations of choice.<br>
DNA sequences for use within the present invention will typically encode a pre-pro peptide at the amino-terminus of the FVII protein to obtain proper post-translational process¬ing (e.g. gamma-cartDOxylation of glutamic acid residues) and secretion from the host cell. The pre-pro peptide may be that of FVII or another vitamin K-dependent plasma protein,<br><br>
such as factor IX, factor X. prothromoin, protein C or protein S  AS win oe apprecated by those skilled in the art, additional modifications can be made in the amino acid sequence of FVII where those modifications do not significantly impair the ability of the protein to act as a coagulation factor. For example, FVII in the catalytic triad can also be modified in the activa¬tion cleavage site to inhibit the conversion of zymogen FVII into its activated two-chain form, as generally described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,629, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Within the present invention, transgenic animal technology may be employed to produce the vitamin K-dependent protein. It is preferred to produce the proteins within the mammary glands of a host female mammal. Expression in the mammary gland and subse¬quent secretion of the protein of interest into the milk overcomes many difficulties encoun¬tered in isolating proteins from other sources. Milk is readily collected, available in large quantities, and well characterized biochemically. Furthermore, the major milk proteins are present in milk at high concentrations (typically from about 1 to 15 g/1). From a commercial point of view, it is clearly preferable to use as the host a species that has a large milk yield. While smaller animals such as mice and rats can be used (and are preferred at the proof of principle stage), within the present invention it is preferred to use livestock mammals includ¬ing, but not limited to, pigs, goats, sheep and cattle. Sheep are particularly preferred due to such factors as the previous history of transgenesis in this species, milk yield, cost and the ready availability of equipment for collecting sheep milk. See WIPO Publication WO 88/00239 for a comparison of factors influencing the choice of host species. It is generally desirable to select a breed of host animal that has been bred for dairy use, such as East Friesland sheep, or to introduce dairy stock by breeding of the transgenic line at a later date. In any event, animals of known, good health status should be used.<br>
To obtain expression in the mammary gland, a transcription promoter from a milk protein gene is used. Milk protein genes include those genes encoding caseins (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,304,489, incorporated herein by reference), beta-lactoglobulin, a-lactalbumin, and whey acidic protein. The beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) promoter is preferred. In the case of the ovine beta-lactoglobulin gene, a region of at least the proximal 406 bp of 5' flanking se¬quence of the gene will generally be used, although larger portions of the 5' flanking se¬quence, up to about 5 kbp, are preferred, such as about 4.25 kbp DNA segment encompass¬ing the 5' flanking promoter and non-coding portion of the beta-lactoglobulin gene. See Whitelaw et al., Biochem J. 286: 31-39 (1992). Similar fragments of promoter DNA from other species are also suitable.<br>
Other regions of the beta-lactoglobulin gene may also be incorporated in constructs, as may genomic regions of the gene to be expressed. It Is generally accepted in the art that constaicts lacking introns, for example, express poorly in comparison with those that contain such DNA sequences (see Brinster et al.. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85: 836-840 (1988);<br><br>
Palmiter et al., Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 478-482 (1991); Whitelaw et al.. Transgenic Res. 1: 3-13 (1991); WO 89/01343; and WO 91/02318. each of which is incorporated herein by reference). In this regard, it is generally preferred, where possible, to use genomic se¬quences containing all or some of the native introns of a gene encoding the protein or poly¬peptide of interest, thus the further inclusion of at least some introns from, e.g. the beta-lactoglobulin gene, is preferred. One such region is a DNA segment which provides for intron splicing and RNA polyadenylation from the 3' non-coding region of the ovine beta-lactoglobulin gene. When substituted for the natural 3' non-coding sequences of a gene, this ovine beta-lactogiobuiin segment can both enhance and stabilize expression levels of the protein or polypeptide of interest. Within other embodiments, the region surrounding the ini¬tiation ATG of the sequence encoding the vitamin K-dependent protein is replaced with cor¬responding sequences from a milk specific protein gene. Such replacement provides a puta¬tive tissue-specific initiation environment to enhance expression. It is convenient to replace the entire pre-pro sequence of the vitamin K-dependent protein and 5' non-coding sequences with those of. for example, the BLG gene, although smaller regions may be replaced.<br>
For expression of a vitamin K-dependent protein in transgenic animals, a DNA seg¬ment encoding the vitamin K-dependent protein is operably linked to additional DNA seg¬ments required for its expression to produce expression units. Such additional segments in¬clude the above-mentioned promoter, as well as sequences which provide for termination of transcription and polyadenylation of mRNA. The expression units will further include a DNA segment encoding a secretory signal sequence operably linked to the segment encoding the vitamin K-dependent protein. The secretory signal sequence may be a native secretory sig¬nal sequence of the vitamin K-dependent protein or may be that of another protein, such as a milk protein. See, for example, von Heinje. Nuc. Acids Res. 14: 4683-4690 (1986); and Meade et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,873.316. which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Construction of expression units for use in transgenic animals is conveniently car¬ried out by inserting a sequence encoding the vitamin K-dependent protein into a pfasmid or phage vector containing the additional DNA segments, although the expression unit may be constructed by essentially any sequence of ligations. It is particularly convenient to provide a vector containing a DNA segment encoding a milk protein and to replace the coding se¬quence for the milk protein with that of the vitamin K-dependent protein, thereby creating a gene fusion that includes the expression control sequences of the milk protein gene. In any event, cloning of the expression units in plasmids or other vectors facilitates the amplification of the vitamin K-dependent protein. Amplification is conveniently carried out in bacterial (e.g, E. coll) host cells, thus the vectors will typically include an origin of replication and a select¬able marker functional in bacterial host cells.<br><br>
The expression unit is then introduced into fertilized eggs (including early-stage em¬bryos) of the chosen host species. Introduction of heterologous DNA can be accomplished by one of several routes, including microinjection (e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,191). retroviral infection (Jaenisch, Science 240: 1468-1474 (1988)) or site-directed integration using em¬bryonic stem (ES) cells (reviewed by Bradley et al., Bio/Technology 10: 534-539 (1992)). The eggs are then implanted into the oviducts or uteri of pseudopregnant females and allowed to develop to tenn. Offspring carrying the introduced DNA in their germ line can pass the DNA on to their progeny in the normal, Mendelian fashion, allowing the development of transgenic herds.<br>
General procedures for producing transgenic animals are known in the art. See, for example. Hogan et aL, Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1986; Simons et al., Bio/Technology 6: 179-183 (1988); Wall et aL. Biol. Reprod. 32: 645-651 (1985); Buhler et al., BiorTechnology 8: 140-143 (1990); Ebert et aL, Bionrechnology 9: 835-838 (1991); Krimpenfort et aL, Bio/Technology 9: 844-847 (1991); Wall et aL, J. CelL Biochem. 49: 113-120(1992); U.S.Pat. Nos. 4.873,191 and 4,873,316; WIPO publications WO 88/00239. WO 90/05188, WO 92/11757; and GB 87/00458, which are incorporated herein by reference. Techniques for introducing foreign DNA sequences into mammals and their germ cells were originally developed in the mouse. See. e.g., Gor¬don et al., Proc. NatL Acad. Sci. USA 77: 7380-7384 (1980); Gordon and Ruddle, Science 214: 1244-1246 (1981); Palmiterand Brinster, Cell 41: 343-345 (1985); Brinster et aL, Proc. NatL Acad. Sci. USA 82: 4438-4442 (1986); and Hogan et al. (ibid.). These techniques were subsequently adapted for use with larger animals, including livestock species (see e.g.. WIPO publications WO 88/00239. WO 90/05188, and WO 92/11757: and Simons et aL. Bio/Technology 6: 179-183 (1988). To summarize, in the most efficient route used to date in the generation of transgenic mice or livestock, several hundred linear molecules of the DNA of interest are injected into one of the pro-nuclei of a fertilized egg according to established techniques. Injection of DNA into the cytoplasm of a zygote can also be employed. Produc¬tion in transgenic plants may also be employed. Expression may be generalized or directed to a particular organ, such as a tuber. See, Hiatt, Nature 344:469-479 (1990); Edelbaum et aL, J. Interferon Res. 12:449-453 (1992); Sijmons et al., Bio/Technology 8:217-221 (1990); and European Patent Office Publication EP 255,378.<br>
FVII produced according to the present invention may be purified by affinity chroma¬tography on an anti-FVII antibody column. It is preferred that the immunoadsorption column comprise a high-specificity monoclonal antibody. The use of calcium-dependent monoclonal antibodies, as described by Wakabayashi et aL, J. Biol. Chem, 261:11097-11108, (1986) and Thim et aL, Biochem. 27: 7785-7793, (1988), incorporated by reference herein, is particularly prefen"ed. Additional purification may be achieved by conventional chemical purification<br><br>
means, such as high performance liquid chromatography. Other methods of purification, in¬cluding barium citrate precipitation, are known in the art, and may be applied to the purifica¬tion of the FVII described herein (see, generally, Scopes, R., Protein Purification, Springer-Verlag, N.Y., 1982). Substantially pure FV!I of at least about 90 to 95% homogeneity is pre¬ferred, and 98 to 99% or more homogeneity most preferred, for pharmaceutical uses. Once purified, partially or to homogeneity as desired, the FVII may then be used therapeutically.<br>
Conversion of single-chain FVII to active two-chain FVlIa may be achieved using factor Xlla as described by Hedner and Kisiel (1983. J. Clin. Invest. 71: 1836-1841), or with other proteases having trypsin-like specificity (Kisiel and Fujikawa, Behring Inst. Mitt. 73: 29-42, 1983). Alternatively FVII may be activated by passing it through an ion-exchange chro¬matography column, such as mono Q.RTM. (Pharmacia Fire Chemicals) or the like (Bjoern et ai,. 1986, Research Disclosures 269:564-565). The FVII molecules of the present inven¬tion and pharmaceutical compositions thereof are particularly useful for administration to hu¬mans to treat a variety of conditions involving intravascular coagulation.<br>
Vitamin K-dependent proteins of the present invention can be used to treat certain types of hemophida. Hemophilia A is characterized by the absence of active factor Vlll, factor Villa, or the presence of inhibitors to factor Vlll. Hemophilia B is characterized by the ab¬sence of active factor IX, factor IXa. FVII deficiency, although rare, responds we!! to factor Vil administration (Bauer, K. A., 1996, Haemostasis, 26:155-158. suppl. 1). Factor Vlll replace¬ment therapy is limited due to development of high-titer inhibitory factor Vlll antibodies in some patients. Alternatively, FVlla can be used in the treatment of hemophilia A and B. Fac¬tor IXa and factor Villa activate factor X. Factor Vila eliminates the need for factors IX and Vlll by activating factor X directly, and can overcome the problems of factor IX and VIII defi¬ciencies with few immunological consequences.<br>

The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples which, however, are not to be construed as limiting the scope of protection. The features disclosed in the forego¬ing description and in the following examples may, both separately and in any combination thereof be material for realising the invention in diverse forms thereof.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
COEXPRESSION OF FVIl AND THE FVIl PROPEPTIDE IN CH0-K1 CELLS<br>
A plasmid vector pLN174 for expression of human FVIl has been described (Pers-son and Nielsen. 1996. FEBS Lett. 385: 241-243). Briefly, it carries the cDNA nucleotide se¬quence encoding human FVIl including the propeptide under the control of a mouse metal-lothionein promoter for transcription of the inserted cDNA. and mouse dihydrofolate reduc¬tase cDNA under the control of an SV40 early promoter for use as a selectable marker.<br>
For construction of a plasmid vector encoding a gamma-carboxylation recognition sequence, a cloning vector pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene) containing cDNA encoding FVIl including its propeptide was used (pLN171). (Persson et a!. 1997. J. Biol. Chem. 272: 19919-19924). A nucleotide sequence encoding a stop codon was inserted into the cDNA encoding FVIl after the propeptide of FVIl by inverse PCR-mediated mutagenesis on this cloning vec¬tor. The template plasmid was denatured by treatment with NaOH followed by PCR with Pwo (Boehringer-Mannheim) and Taq (Perkin-Elmer) polymerases with the following primers:<br>
a)   5^-AGC GTT TTA GCG CCG GCG CCG GTG CAG GAC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 19)<br><br>
b)   5'-CGC CGG CGC TAA AAC GCT TTC CTG GAG GAG CTG CGG CC-3' (SEQ ID NO:20)<br>
The resulting mix was digested with Dpnl to digest residual template DNA and Es¬cherichia CO//were transformed with the PCR product. Clones were screened for the pres¬ence of the mutation by sequencing. The cDNA from a correct clone was transferred as a BamHI-EcoRI fragment to the expression plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The resulting pias-mid was termed pLN329.<br>
CHO K1 cells (ATCC CCI61) were transfected with equal amounts of pLN174 and pLN329 with the Fugene6 method (Boehriner-Mannheim). Transfectants were selected by the addition of methotrexate to 1µM and G-418 to 0.45 mg/ml. The pool of transfectants were cloned by limiting dilution and FVII expression from the clones was measured.<br>
A high producing clone was further subcloned and a clone E11 with a specific FVil expression of 2.4 pg/cell/day in Dulbecco-modified Eagle's medium with 10 % fetal calf se¬rum was selected. The clone was adapted to serum free suspension culture in a commer¬cially available CHO medium (JRH Bioscience).<br>
The adapted cells were propagated sequentially in spinner cultures and as the cell number increased, the volume was gradually increased by addition of new medium.<br>
After 25 days. 6 I of spinner culture were* inoculated into a SO-liter bioreactor. The cells were propagated in the bioreactor and as the cell number increased, the volume was gradually increased by addition of new medium.<br>
Finally. 50 I of seed culture were inoculated into a 500-liter production bioreactor containing macroporous Cytopore 1 carriers (Pharmacia), after which the suspension cells became immobilized in the carriers. The culture was maintained at 36°C at a pH of 7.0-7.1 and a Dissolved Oxygen Tension (DOT) of 50% of saturation. The volume in the bioreactor was gradually increased by addition of new medium as the cell number increased. When the cell density reached approximately 10-12 x 105 cells/ml. the production phase was initiated and a medium change was performed every 24 hours: agitation was stopped to allow for sedimentation of the cell-containing carriers, and 80% of the culture supernatant was then harvested and replaced with new medium. The harvested culture supernatant was filtered to remove non-trapped ceils (i.e. cells that were not immobilized in carriers) and cell debris and was then transfenred for further processing.<br>
During the production phase the cells reached 2-3 x 107 cells/ml and a titer of 8 mg factor Vll/liter.<br><br>

COMPARISON OF FVII EXPRESSING CH0-K1 CELLS AND CELLS COEXPRESSING FVII AND A FREE FVII PROPEPTIDE<br>
CH0-K1 cells were transfected with pLN 174 and 1) empty pcDNA3.1 + vector or 2) FVII propeptide in pcDNAS.I-t', as described in Example 1. Pools of transfectants were ana¬lysed for FVII expression and cell numbers. The FVli yields pr. cell pr. 24 hours are outlined in Figure 3. The results show that coexpression of the FVII propeptide increases FVII yields pr. cell from approximately 1 pg/cell/day to 4 pg/cell/day. Results are shown in figure 3.<br><br><br>
