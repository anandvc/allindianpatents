				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to absorbent articles. The<br>
absorbent articles comprise an absorbent core material<br>
which is covered by an apertured film. Absorbent articles<br>
of the invention are useful in various applications<br>
including sanitary protection products, diapers, and<br>
bandages.<br>
Absorbent products such as sanitary napkins, disposable<br>
diapers and bandages are used to absorb body fluids such<br>
as menses, urine and wound exudate. These absorbent<br>
products generally require that the absorbent pad or<br>
absorbent article thereof be able to absorb a significant<br>
amount of body fluid. In some instances, the absorbent<br>
component must be capable of absorbing an amount of body<br>
fluid whose weight is greater than the weight of the<br>
absorbent material itself. It is also desirable that the<br>
body contacting surface of an absorbent product be dry, or<br>
relatively dry, even after the absorbent product has<br>
absorbed the body fluid, which it is designed to receive.<br>
United States Patent Number 3,929,135 discloses an<br>
absorptive structure comprising an absorbent material and<br>
an apertured film. The absorbent material may be, for<br>
example, comminuted wood pulp. The apertured film serves<br>
as a top sheet for the absorptive structure. The<br>
apertured film is smooth on one side, and has<br>
protuberances on the other side. The protuberances of the<br>
apertured film face the absorbent material thereby<br>
forming the absorptive structure.<br>
United States Patent Number 4,341,217 discloses a<br>
disposable absorbent article. The absorbent article has<br>
an absorbent core made of a material such as comminuted<br>
wood pulp. An apertured film encloses the absorbent core.<br>
The apertured film has protuberances which face both major<br>
surfaces of the absorbent core.<br>
Despite the disclosure of the above-mentioned patents,<br>
there is a continuing need for an absorbent article with<br>
the ability to absorb a significant amount of fluid yet<br>
provide a dry feeling against the skin of the user after<br>
absorbing the fluid.<br>
The present invention provides an absorbent article<br>
comprising an inner absorbent core material having a first<br>
major surface and a second major surface; a bottom layer;<br>
and a top layer. The bottom layer of the absorbent<br>
article comprises an apertured film having an open area<br>
and protuberances, and is oriented such that the<br>
protuberances face the inner absorbent core material. The<br>
top layer of the absorbent article comprises an apertured<br>
film having an open area and protuberances, and is<br>
oriented such that the protuberances face away from the<br>
inner absorbent core material.<br>
Due to the design of the article of the invention, based<br>
on the orientation of the protuberances of the apertured<br>
film comprising the top and bottom layers, the article of<br>
the invention absorbs significant amounts of fluid. The<br>
bottom layer of the article of the invention faces the<br>
liquid to be absorbed. Fluids flow through the bottom<br>
layer of the absorbent article into the absorbent core.<br>
The absorbent core absorbs the fluids.. The top layer of<br>
the absorbent article, owing to the specific orientation<br>
of its protuberances, tends to prevent liquids from<br>
entering into the absorbent article.<br>
The absorbent core may be made from various materials<br>
including rayon fibers; natural fibers, such as, but not<br>
limited to, cotton fibers and wood pulp fibers; synthetic<br>
fibers, such as, but not limited to, polyester fibers,<br>
polyamide fibers, and polyolefin fibers,, and combinations<br>
thereof. The fibers may be bicomponent fibers. For<br>
example, the bicomponent fibers may be in a sheath-core<br>
configuration in which the sheath comprises one polymer<br>
and the core comprises a different polymer. Bicomponent<br>
fibers having the other configurations, e.g., a side-by-<br>
side configuration, may also be used.<br>
Preferably the fibers comprising the absorbent core are<br>
bonded at the points where they cross over and are in<br>
contact with each other. The bonding may be achieved,<br>
e.g., by heating the fibers so that they soften and fuse<br>
together at their crossover points. Alternatively, the<br>
fibers may be bonded by the use of an adhesive which can<br>
be applied by, e.g., spraying or gravure printing methods.<br>
Typically, the fibers are solid fibers? however, the<br>
fibers, or portions thereof, may be hollow fibers. Fibers<br>
having deniers ranging from about 3 to 10 may be<br>
advantageously used for the absorbent core. The basis<br>
weight for the absorbent core is not limited, but<br>
typically may range from 0.003 g/cm2 to 0.015 g/cm2.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the absorbent core comprises a<br>
nonwoven fabric made from bicomponent fibers which have<br>
been fusion-bonded using hot air. The bicomponent fibers<br>
are sheath-core fibers in which the sheath material<br>
comprises polyethylene and the core material comprises<br>
polyester. The denier of the sheath-core fibers is about<br>
3. The nonwoven fabric has a basis weight of about 2<br>
oz/yd2.<br>
The top layer and the bottom layer of the article of the<br>
invention are made from an apertured film having an open<br>
area and a plurality of protuberances. Such apertured<br>
films are disclosed in United States Patent Number<br>
3,929,135, United States Patent Number 4,324,246, United<br>
States Patent Number 4,342,314, United States Patent<br>
Number 4,463,045, and United States Patent Number<br>
5,006,394, the disclosure of each of which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
Particularly useful apertured films include Vispore®<br>
apertured film supplied by Tredegar. Such apertured films<br>
include, but are not limited to, those available<br>
commercially under the designations Tredegar X-6799,<br>
Tredegar X-6845, Tredegar X-6923, Tredegar X-6944, and<br>
Tredegar X-6844. The film has a female side, which is<br>
smooth, and a male side, which is somewhat less smooth,<br>
due to the protuberances. The apertured films may be made<br>
from any polymeric material including, but not limited to,<br>
polyethylene, metallocene catalyzed polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene, and copolymers thereof, and ethylene vinyl<br>
acetate copolymers. An apertured film of one type may be<br>
used for the top layer, while a apertured. film of another<br>
type may be used for the bottom layer. Usually, however,<br>
the same apertured film is used for both the bottom and<br>
top layers.<br>
The open area of the apertured film comprising the bottom<br>
layer and the top layer of the absorbent article of the<br>
invention is defined as the area occupied by apertures.<br>
The open area for the top layer and the bottom layer of<br>
the article of the invention may range from 5 percent to<br>
3 0 percent, preferably from 10 percent to 25 percent of<br>
the total area of the apertured film.<br>
The bottom layer of the article of the invention may be<br>
treated with a hydrophilic surfactant including, but not<br>
limited to, laurate esters of sorbitol and sorbitol<br>
anhydrides condensed with ethylene oxide, such as<br>
polysorbate 20, polysorbate 40, polysorbate 60, and<br>
polysorbate 80; ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymers;<br>
octyl phenol ethoxylates; nonyl phenol ethoxylates; and<br>
ethoxylated alcohols. The term "treated" means that the<br>
bottom layer has had a hydrophillic surfactant<br>
incorporated therein during the polymerization process<br>
used to manufacture the polymeric resin from which the<br>
bottom layer is made, or the hydrophilic surfactant is<br>
incorporated with the polymer during the process by which<br>
the apertured film is made, or the bottom layer is coated<br>
with the hydrophillic surfactant after the bottom layer<br>
has been made.<br>
The apertured film may, if desired, comprise Triclosan or<br>
a like anti-bacterial agent in an anti-bacterially<br>
effective amount. The apertured film comprises a smooth<br>
side and a side having protuberances. The bottom layer of<br>
the absorbent article of the invention is oriented such<br>
that the protuberances of the apertured film face the<br>
bonded absorbent core. The top layer of the article of<br>
the invention is oriented such that the protuberances of<br>
the apertured film face the outside of the absorbent<br>
article.<br>
The bottom layer and the top layer of the absorbent<br>
article of the invention may be secured to the absorbent<br>
core material by means known in the art. For example, a<br>
suitable adhesive may be applied to the top of the<br>
absorbent core material, and the top layer may then be<br>
applied to the absorbent core. Then the bottom of the<br>
absorbent core may be coated with the adhesive and the<br>
bottom layer may be applied to the bottom of the absorbent<br>
core. Other means known in the art, e.g. ultrasonic<br>
bonding, may also be used.<br>
The adhesives may be made from any polymerization process<br>
including solution or dispersion processes. The adhesives<br>
may be hot melt adhesives. Examples of suitable adhesives<br>
include, but are not limited to those based on styrenic<br>
block copolymers and tackifying resins such as HL-1491<br>
from HB-Fuller Co. (St. Paul MN), H-2543 from ATO-Findley<br>
(Wawatausa, WI), and 34-5534 from National Starch &amp;<br>
Chemical (Bridgewater, NJ). Ethylene copolymers,<br>
including ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers, may also be<br>
useful. Suitable adhesives also include acrylic based,<br>
dextrin based, and urethane based adhesives as well as<br>
natural and synthetic elastomers. The adhesives may also<br>
include amorphous polyolefins including amorphous<br>
polypropylene, such as HL-1308 from HB Fuller or Rextac RT<br>
2373 from Huntsman (Odesssa, TX). The adhesive may be<br>
compounded with Kraton® synthetic rubber and the like, or<br>
natural rubber with a tackifier and antioxidant process<br>
aids.<br>
The adhesive can be applied in the molten stage, sprayed,<br>
or slot die coated. The spray can be applied by control<br>
coating, control weaving, control fiberization,<br>
meltblowing, flexo coating, screen printing, or other<br>
discontinuous coating methods.<br>
The present invention also provides a method which<br>
utilizes the materials described above. The method<br>
includes: placing an apertured film having protuberances<br>
on a surface with the protuberances facing up; applying<br>
an adhesive to the top surface of an absorbent core<br>
material; placing the top surface of the absorbent core<br>
material on the apertured film; placing a second apertured<br>
film having protuberances on a surface with the<br>
protuberances facing up; applying an adhesive to the top<br>
surface of the second apertured film; and placing the<br>
bottom surface of the absorbent core material on the top<br>
surface of the second apertured film; whereby the<br>
absorbent article is formed.<br>
The absorbent article of the invention may be made in any<br>
desired shape, including, but not limited to, round, oval,<br>
rectangular, square, and triangular. The size of the<br>
absorbent article of the invention will vary depending on<br>
the desired application.<br>
Absorbent articles of the invention may be used as, or as<br>
components of, various products including, but not limited<br>
to, bandages, sanitary protection pads, diapers, and<br>
implements for carrying and/or dispensing anti-itch<br>
agents, acne treating agents, moisturizers, and the like.<br>
For bandages, the absorbent article of the invention may<br>
be square, rectangular, round, oval, or triangular in<br>
shape. The size of the bandage will depend on the shape<br>
of the bandage and the size of the wound meant to be<br>
covered by the bandage. Generally, a square bandage may<br>
range in size from 5 cm x 5 cm to 15 cm x 15 cm,<br>
preferably from 7.5 cm x 7.5 cm to 12.5 cm x 12.5 cm. The<br>
length of a rectangular bandage may range from 5 cm to 15<br>
cm, preferably from 7.5 cm to 12.5 cm. The width of a-<br>
rectangular bandage may range from 0.5 cm to 5 cm,<br>
preferably from 1 cm to 3 cm. A circular bandage may<br>
range in outer diameter from 5 cm to 2 0 cm, preferably<br>
from 7.5 cm to 17.5 cm, more preferably from 10 cm to 15<br>
cm.<br>
The thickness of the absorbent article of the invention<br>
will vary depending on the application, but generally may<br>
range from 0.25 mm to 5 mm, preferably 1 mm to 3 mm, more<br>
preferably 1 mm to 2 mm.<br>
When the absorbent article of the invention is used as the<br>
wound contacting pad of a bandage, the bottom layer of the<br>
absorbent article is oriented toward the user's skin and<br>
serves as a wound release layer, meaning that the layer<br>
will not stick to the wound to which the bandage is<br>
applied.. The bottom layer is made of the same apertured<br>
film described above. The top layer of the bandage is<br>
also made of the apertured film described above.<br>
When used as the wound contacting pad of an adhesive<br>
bandage, the open area of the top layer of the absorbent<br>
article and the open area of the bottom layer of the<br>
absorbent article may be the same or may be different. In<br>
order to reduce the contact area of the bandage against<br>
the wound, the open area of the bottom layer of the<br>
absorbent article may range from 5 percent to 3 0 percent,<br>
preferably from 10 percent to 25 percent of the total area<br>
of the apertured film. The reduction in contact area<br>
against the wound reduces the wound release force. This<br>
results in a lower re-injury occurrence of the wound. The<br>
top layer of the absorbent article may have a smaller open<br>
area than the bottom layer of the bandage. The use of a<br>
top layer having a reduced open area tends to prevent<br>
undesirable escape of liquid from the inner absorbent<br>
core.<br>
In one embodiment of an adhesive bandage, the absorbent<br>
article of the invention is secured, as by adhesive, to a<br>
backing comprising a polyethylene foam of any density, or<br>
conbinations of various density polyethylenes. The<br>
density of the foam may range from 0.008 g/cm3 to 0.160<br>
g/cm3. The foam may be perforated or apertured. The size<br>
of the perforation or aperture may range from 0.01 mm to 5<br>
mm. The total open area may range from 10 percent to 80<br>
percent of the total foam area. The perforations or<br>
apertures may be made by extrusion, mechanical, hot-<br>
pinning or ultrasonic perforation. The thickness of the<br>
bandage may range from 1 mm to 3 mm.<br>

FIG. 5 is a schematic perspective of a second embodiment<br>
of an adhesive bandage in accordance with the teachings of<br>
the present invention; and<br>
FIG. 6 is a cross section taken along line 6-6 of FIG. 5.<br>
Referring now to the accompanying drawngs, there is shown<br>
a first embodiment of an absorbent article in accordance<br>
with the teachings of the present invention. Referring to<br>
FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, absorbent article 2 0 comprises an<br>
absorbent core 24, a bottom layer 28 and a top layer 32.<br>
Absorbent core 24 has a first major, or upper, surface 25<br>
and a second major, or lower, surface 26. Top layer 32 is<br>
secured, e.g., by adhesive, to upper surface 25 of<br>
absorbent core, while bottom layer 28 is secured, e.g., by<br>
adhesive, to lower surface 26 of the absorbent core.<br>
Those skilled in the art will understand that top and<br>
bottom layers 32, 28 can be secured to the absorbent core<br>
by means other than adhesive, for example, by heat-<br>
sealing. When adhesive is used, it is preferably applied<br>
in discontinuous fashion, for example, by spraying, screen<br>
printing, gravure printing or the like. Similarly, heat-<br>
sealing is preferably done in a discontinuous manner.<br>
Absorbent core 24 may comprise a single fibrous web of any<br>
desired thickness. Alternatively, absorbent core 24 may<br>
comprise two or more such webs. As seen in FIG. 2,<br>
absorbent core 24 comprises three fibrous webs, 24a, 24b<br>
and 24c.<br>
Bottom layer 2 8 preferably comprises an apertured plastic<br>
film which, as seen in FIG. 3, comprises a plurality of<br>
protuberances 3 7 each having a base 3 8 in the plane, P, of<br>
the film and an apex 40 remote therefrom. Apex 40 has an<br>
apex opening 42. Base 38 has a base opening 44. Base<br>
opening 44 is larger than apex opening 42. Bottom layer 28<br>
is placed against lower surface 2 6 of absorbent core 24<br>
such that apices 40 of its protuberances 3 7 come into<br>
contact with said lower surface of the absorbent core and<br>
the bases 3 8 of its protuberances 37 are remote from the<br>
lower surface of the absorbent core.<br>
Top layer 32 of absorbent article 2 0 preferably comprises<br>
the same apertured plastic film as that used for bottom<br>
layer 28. However, the orientation of top layer 32 with<br>
respect to the absorbent core is different from the<br>
orientation of bottom layer 28. Specifically, as will be<br>
seen by reference to FIG. 3, top layer 32 is placed<br>
against upper surface 25 of absorbent core 24 such that<br>
apices 40 of its protuberances 37 are remote from the<br>
upper surface of the absorbent core and the bases 3 8 of<br>
its protuberances are disposed adjacent said upper surface<br>
of the absorbent core.<br>
Each of top layer 32 and bottom layer 2 8 has a true<br>
caliper, Cl, and an apparent caliper, C2. True caliper,<br>
Cl, is the thickness of the material before protuberances<br>
37 have been formed therein. Apparent caliper, C2, is the<br>
"in-use" thickness of the material after formation of<br>
protuberances 3 7 and is measured from base 3 8 to apex 4 0<br>
of protuberance 37.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 4, there is shown a perspective view<br>
of an adhesive bandage which uses the absorbent article of<br>
the present invention as its wound contacting pad.<br>
Adhesive bandage 5 0 comprises a backing 52 which may<br>
comprise, e.g., a foam or a thin plastic film comprising,<br>
e.g., polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, polyurethane or<br>
the like. One major surface, 53, of backing 52 has an<br>
adhesive 54 (illustrated in FIG. 4 by stippling) applied<br>
thereto. Adhesive 54 may be any of the adhesives well<br>
known and used in the art and it may be applied to surface<br>
53 using any well known adhesive application method.<br>
Adhesive bandage 50 further comprises a wound contacting<br>
pad 58 which is secured to backing 52 by adhesive 54 in<br>
known manner. In the embodiment under discussion, wound<br>
contacting pad 58 is co-extensive in width with backing<br>
material 52 but is shorter in length than the backing.<br>
Wound contacting pad 58 is centered end-to-end of backing<br>
52 as is known in the art.<br>
Wound contacting pad 58 has the three-layer structure of<br>
absorbent article 2 0 illustrated in FIG.. 1 and described<br>
hereinabove. Preferably, pad 58 is oriented on the<br>
adhesive coated surface of backing 52 so that<br>
protuberances 37 of top layer 32 (see FIG. 3) of absorbent<br>
article 20 come into contact with adhesive 54. As a<br>
result, that surface of bottom layer 28 which lies in<br>
plane P (see FIG. 3) faces away from adhesive coated<br>
surface 53 and, in use, contacts the wound which the user<br>
of the bandage desires to protect and/or treat.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 5 and 6 of the drawings, there is<br>
shown another embodiment of an adhesive bandage in<br>
accordance with the present invention. Adhesive bandage<br>
70 comprises a backing 72 to one major surface 73 of which<br>
is applied an adhesive 74. Adhesive bandage 70 further<br>
comprises a wound contacting pad 78. In this embodiment,<br>
backing 72 comprises an apertured film of the kind<br>
discussed earlier herein, that is, the apertured film has<br>
an open area and protuberances 37. Wound contacting pad<br>
78 is secured by underlying adhesive 74 to backing 72.<br>
Wound contacting pad 78 comprises a fibrous layer 80 and a<br>
cover layer 82. Wound contacting pad 78 is oriented on<br>
backing 72 so that its fibrous layer 8 0 comes into contact<br>
with adhesive 74. As a result, cover layer 82 faces away<br>
from the adhesive and, in ultimate use, comes into contact<br>
with the wound, W, which the user desires to protect or<br>
otherwise treat.<br>
Cover layer 82, as was the case with backing layer 72,<br>
comprises an apertured film having an open area and a<br>
plurality of protuberances 37. As illustrated in FIG. 6,<br>
cover layer 82 is oriented on fibrous layer 8 0 such that<br>
its protuberances 3 7 face end come into contact with<br>
fibrous layer 80.<br>
The following examples are intended to demonstrate the<br>
absorbent article of this invention. The examples should<br>
not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1 - Preparation Of Absorbent Pads<br>
Tredegar X-6799 apertured film was unwound, cut into a 20<br>
cm x 27 cm square, and placed with the protuberances up.<br>
Findley HM 3210 adhesive was applied to the entire top<br>
surface of a 20 cm x 27 cm piece of PGI FB035C non-woven<br>
(a bonded bicomponent fiber). The non-woven pad was placed<br>
adhesive side down on top of the upwardly projecting<br>
protuberances of the apertured film. This was the source<br>
for the bandage pads. The source for the bandage pads was<br>
cut into 2.1 cm x 1.2 cm bandage pads. A second piece of<br>
Tredegar X-6799 apertured film was unwound and cut into<br>
7.6 cm x 1.9 cm strips. The strips were placed with the<br>
protuberances facing down. Findley 3210 adhesive was<br>
applied to the upwardly facing surface of the strips. The<br>
bandage pads, prepared as described above, were placed<br>
non-woven side down onto the centers of the strips.<br>
The process above was repeated substituting various<br>
apertured films for the Tredegar X-6799. Samples were<br>
prepared utilizing Tredegar X-6845, Tredegar X-6923,<br>
Tredegar X-6944, and Tredegar X-6844.<br>
Example 2 - Wound Release Test<br>
For bandages, it is important that the layer of the<br>
bandage that contacts the wound does not stick to the<br>
wound. Therefore, a wound release test is utilized to<br>
determine the quality of the bandage, in terms of not<br>
sticking to the wound. The absorbent pads prepared in<br>
Example 1 were tested and compared to a commercial product<br>
known for good wound release characteristics. The test<br>
was performed on female Yorkshire swine. On the day<br>
before the test, the animal was sedated and fur was<br>
removed from the animal's back and flank with electric<br>
clippers. A depilatory lotion was applied to the area.<br>
After 10 minutes, the lotion was removed with a metal<br>
spatula. The area was washed with mild isoap and swabbed<br>
dry. The next day, the animal was sedated and a single<br>
row of twelve 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm superficial wounds was<br>
created on each flank, parallel to the spinal column using<br>
a Brown Dermatome set at a depth of 0.0 8 cm. The wounds<br>
were wiped with a gauze sponge and the bandages were<br>
applied perpendicular to the spinal column. A stretch<br>
bandage was applied over the bandages to prevent movement<br>
or removal of the bandages.<br>
Approximately 24 hours later, the animal was sedated. A<br>
Chatillon Digital Force Gauge Model DFGS2 with a<br>
chromatography clip attached to the bottom post of the<br>
unit by 5 cm of string was used to measure the bandage<br>
removal force. The stretch bandages were removed from the<br>
animal. The adhesive portions of the bandages were cut<br>
and removed from the animal, leaving only the pad on the<br>
wound. The chromatography clip was attached to the top or<br>
bottom edge of each bandage and the force gauge was<br>
zeroed. The gauge was lifted perpendicular to the plane<br>
of the wound surface until the string was taught. The<br>
gauge was pulled back at a steady even rate until the<br>
bandage was removed from the wound surface. The force<br>
required to remove each bandage (Mean Removal Force) was<br>
recorded (in grams). The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
The data above demonstrate that the absorbent articles of<br>
this invention are useful as bandages and have improved<br>
wound release characteristics as compared with a<br>
commercial product known to have good wound release<br>
characteristics.<br>
Example 3 - Absorbency Test<br>
The potential applications for the articles of this<br>
invention all require that the article have high liquid<br>
absorbency. Therefore, the absorbency test was run on the<br>
absorbent pads prepared in Example 1 and a commercially<br>
available pad to determine how fast the article absorbs<br>
liquids, and how much liquid is retained in the article<br>
when pressure is applied (known as rewet). The test was<br>
performed by a modified IDANA 150.1-90 liquid strike-<br>
through time test. The results are shown in Table 2.<br>
The data above demonstrate the articles of this invention<br>
are useful in applications where high liquid absorbency is<br>
required, as they absorb more liquid than a commercial<br>
product known to have good liquid absorbency.<br>
Example 4 - Moisture Evaporation Rate<br>
While absorbent articles are required to have high liquid<br>
absorbency, they should also have high moisture<br>
evaporation rates. High moisture evaporation rates allow<br>
the liquid to pass from the upper surface of the absorbent<br>
article to the atmosphere. Therefore, the moisture<br>
evaporation rate test was run on the absorbent pads<br>
prepared in Example 1 and a commercially available pad to<br>
determine how fast liquids can pass from the absorbent<br>
article to the atmosphere. The test was performed by<br>
measuring the loss of water in the absorbent pads (by<br>
weight) and calculating the rate of loss (at 3 7°C).<br>
A microscope glass slide and adhesive bandage was<br>
weighed(Wl), a syringe was used to add approximately 100<br>
mg of deionized water on the pad, and the weight was<br>
checked (W2). The bandage was turned with the pad facing<br>
the glass and both edges of the pad areas were sealed with<br>
a light tape, such as Scotch® Tape. The weight of the<br>
slide, bandage, water and the tape was checked (W3). This<br>
was the T 0 point. The sample was placed in an oven at<br>
37°C and it's weight was rechecked at specified intervals<br>
until no changes were observed. The time table was 0, 5,<br>
10, 20, 30, 60, and 90 minutes.<br>
Calculations: W2-W1 is the determination of the amount<br>
of water added and is used as tbe base (100%) for<br>
calculations at T 0 minutes. Weight differences between<br>
W3 at T 0 min and W3 at T x min will determine moisture<br>
loss in mg for the time tested. The results are expressed<br>
in % loss after the conversion from mg loss. The results<br>
are reported in Table 3.<br>
The data above demonstrate that the absorbent articles of<br>
the present invention provide better moisture evaporation<br>
rates than a commercial product known for good moisture<br>
evaporation. Therefore, the articles of the present<br>
invention will be useful in terms of providing a dry-<br>
surface against the skin of the user.<br>
