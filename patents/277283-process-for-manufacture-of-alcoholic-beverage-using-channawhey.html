				<td>The key object of the study was to standardize the process for manufacturing of alcoholic whey beverage by utilizing the whey a by-product left over during the manufacture of paneer, chakka and channa. The whey system was defatted (by hand operated cream separator) deproteinized (at 85°C/30 min), adjusted to pH 4.5 with citric acid. The strain NCIM-3566 of (Kluyveromyces fragilis) and NCIM-3300 of (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was prudently selected and inoculated at 10 per cent level (mixed or simultaneous). The period of fermentation was decided 7 days (168 hr) incubated at 28°C. Supplementation with crystalline cane sugar as a source of carbohydrate at the rate of 18 per cent found suitable.</td>

4. DESCRIPTION<br>
Whey is the vital by-product of milk industry in the process of manufacturing products like Channa, Panner, Chakka, Casein, Cheese etc. During the process about 10-20 per cent portion of milk is recovered as the desired end product and left over 80-90 per cent watery portion is the whey. Whey is rich source of carbohydrates (Lactose 4-5 %), minerals 0.60 % (Ca, P, Na, Mg etc.), and whey proteins a-lactalbumin (22% of whey protein), β-lactoglobulin (59% of whey protein), serum albumin (6% of whey protein) and water soluble vitamin i.e. B complex (Ghosh and Singh, 1997 and Parekh, 1997). Whey or their preparations are used as nutraciticals and items of functional food. In the face of significant gains, majority of whey is being thrown away as waste in gutter in absence suitable process technique, through which more than 50 per cent of milk solids are lost as a waste.<br>
In India, the major source of whey is from making of Channa. paneer and Chakka. Where, Channa and paneer whey contribute around 80 per cent of entirety whey (Gupta, 2008), and majority is predisposed off as a waste. Looking forward with disposal problems and to harness the benefits of nutritious solids needs transformation in to suitable products. With this hypothesis the present investigation entitled 'whey utilization in preparation of alcoholic beverage' is designed. The technology standardized by this study provides the pace for commercialization at household, small and large scale dairy industry in India. Which helps to boost net profit of milk processers, can get assured monitory advantage and safe guarding environment.<br>
 <br>
An example of preparation of alcoholic whey beverage<br>
The apparent defatted, deproteinized whey systems were supplemented with 18 per cent of sugar. It was transferred in 500 ml conical flasks in sets containing 200 ml quantity and inoculated (mixed culture) with 10 per cent of yeast cultures. Each flask was closed with the help of rubber cork with a hole through which glass tube. The other end of tube was dipped in to conical flask, containing water. After that flask was sealed with wax to avert the exchange of gases. The assembly was then transferred to the incubator maintained at 28 C temperature. The status of fermentation was indicated by development of air bubbles in the flask containing water connected through rubber tubing. During the active process of fermentation foam formation was observed in the fermentation flasks. End of the fermentation was indicated by the interruption of foaming and bubbling. After 7 days fermentation, assembly was dismantled. The fermentation flasks were pasteurized at 63° C for 30 min to inactivate the yeast and stop further fermentation. On cooling, bentonite powder was added as a clarifying agent @ 0.1- 0.5g/ 100ml, mixed well and allowed to stand about 2-3 hr. for clarification. Then the content was centrifuged at 5500 rpm/20 min and clear alcoholic whey beverage was collected in sterilized bottles. The bottles containing alcoholic beverage were sealed and stored at 0-5 C. In case where simultaneous culture was used the pasteurization was done after first stage fermentation. There after sugar and second inoculum was added. After then further process remains same as that of used in case of mixed culture.<br>

5. CLAIMS<br>
I/We claim:	<br>
1.	Whey systems viz. paneer, chakka and channa are suitable for the manufacturing of alcoholic beverage. Amongst them channa whey systems is most suitable for the preparation of alcoholic beverage.<br>
2.	Defatting of whey helps to sreer clear cream line formation and also avoid the deterioration of end<br>
product due to rancidity, if any.<br>
3.	Deproteinization (at 85° C for 30 min) would help to avoid the sedimentation of protein particles and cloudy appearance to have lucid end product.<br>
4.	Cooling at room temperature for setting of denatured protein (for 1-1 1/2 hr) for easy separation of denatured protein.<br>
5.	The strain Kluyveromyces fragflis (NCIM-3566), showed better utilization of lactose after 168 hr (7 days).<br>
6.	The most advantageous period of incubation was finalized as 7 days on the basis of lactose utilization.<br>
7.	The strains NCIM 3300 Saccharomyces cerevisiae. produced better product as compared to NC1M-3287.<br>
s Alcoholic whey beverage prepared with incorporation of 18 per cent sugar (as a source of carbohydrate) was most appreciable in sensory quality. Though, the higher level of alcohol was produced in the sample prepared with 21 per cent sugar but did not liked because of sharp and unpleasant flavor, more astringent and acidic, which resulted in to assaults taste buds.<br>
9.	The' samples prepared with the jaggary (as a source of carbohydraie)bad showed cloudy appearance, musty flavor and more astringent and tasted acidic. Moreover flavor of jagerry masked the alcoholic flavor of beverage.<br>
10.	The rate of inoculums (2-10 %) tried for fermentation where, the 10 per cent proved to be better and effective either inoculated as mixed (50:50) or simultaneously.<br>
11.	Alcohol content of whey beverage ranged from 10.00 to 10.20 per cent<br>
12.	All the lactose present in whey systems was utilized by the yeast (Kluyveromyces fragilis NCTM 3566).<br>
13.	Practically no protein was detected in the alcoholic beverages.<br>
 <br>
14. Centrifugation at 5500 rpm at 20 min, help to steer clear of the end products and remove the lees,<br>
solid particles etc. is.   In case where simultaneous culture is adopted firstly use Kluyveromyces fragilis. followed by<br>
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The mixed culture system found better than simultaneous one.<br>
