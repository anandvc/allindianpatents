				<td>Electrical isulation film<br>
The present invention relates to electrical insulation films, in particular capacitor films, and their use.<br>
Capacitor films must withstand extreme conditions like high temperatures and high electrical breakdown strength. Additionally it is appreciated that capacitor films possess good mechanical properties like a high stiffness. Up to now there is the prevailing opinion in the technical field of capacitor technology that high electrical breakdown strength can be only achieved with a low level of electrical conduction caused by residual metals such as titanium, aluminium and boron. However traditional polypropylenes produced with a Ziegler-Natta catalyst are contaminated with high amounts of residual catalyst components. To achieve the desired very low levels of impurities to make the polypropylene suitable for capacitor films, the polypropylenes must be troublesome washed, a process which is time consuming and cost-intensive. To overcome the washing step polypropylenes produced in the presence of supported single-site catalysts have been developed, as for instance described in WO 02/16455 Al, with low levels of impurities including metallic and non-metallic impurities, like aluminium, titanium, silicon, and halogen (such as CI and F). However to achieve this goal of low levels of impurities the process conditions must be controlled very carefully. Moreover such polypropylenes have the drawback that they cannot be processed in a stable way. In particular films based on polypropylenes produced in the presence of supported single-site catalysts suffer fix)m sagging and break easily when manufactured.<br>
Therefore the object of the present invention is to provide a capacitor film withstanding a high electric field strength without causing failure of the same and said film having in particular good mechanical properties, such as a high stiffness. Preferably such a capacitor film has additionally a high temperature resistance.<br><br>
The present invention is based on the finding that an improved breakdown behaviour can be acconpJished by using a polypropylene for the capacitor film featured by a rather high amount of thin lamellae determined by stepwise isothermal segregation technique (SIST). Such a capacitor film reaches a balance of high thermal resistance, high electrical breakdown strength and good mechanical properties. It has been in particular found out that the good properties can be achieved independently fk&gt;m the amount of impurities present, i.e. whether the polypropylene comprises rather high amounts of aluminium, titanium, silicon, halogen (such as CI and F) and/or boron.<br>
Accordingly, the object outlined above is solved by providing a capacitor film comprising a biaxially oriented polypropylene wherein<br>
a)	said polypropylene has a draw ratio in machine direction of at least 4.0 and a draw ratio in transverse direction of at least 4.0, and<br>
b)	said polypropylene and/or said capacitor film has(have) an electrical breakdown strength EB63% according to lEC 60243-part 1 (1988) of at least 300 kV/mm at a draw ratio in machine direction of 4.0 and at a draw ratio in transverse direction of 4.0.<br>
Preferably the capacitor film is further characterized that said film and/or the polypropylene of said film has/have xylene solubles of some extent, i.e. of at least 0.50 wt.-%.<br>
Moreover it is preferred, that the biaxially oriented polypropylene as defined in the instant invention is the only polymer component of the capacitor film.<br>
Such capacitor films have superior properties compared to the films known in the art. Especially, the inventive capacitor films have high values of electrical breakdown strength also in case relatively high amounts of impurities are present in the film. Thus no troublesome washing steps are necessary as with polypropylenes known in<br><br>
the art. Moreover the capacitor films according to this invention have in addition a high temperature resistance and are obtainable at high process stability and low process temperature. Moreover and surprisingly the inventive film has in addition good mechanical properties at a high stiffness expressed in tensile modulus. Additionally it has been observed that the new capacitor films according to this invention show a significant increase of electrical breakdown strength with increasing the draw ratio.<br>
A first requirement of the present invention is that the polypropylene of the capacitor film is biaxially oriented, i.e. has a draw ratio in machine direction of at least 4.0 and a draw ratio in transverse direction of at least 4.0. Such ratios are appreciated as commercial biaxially oriented polypropylene films must be stretchable at least to the above defined extent without breaking. The length of the sample increases during stretching in longitudinal direction and the draw ratio in longitudinal direction calculates from the ratio of current length over original sample length. Subsequently, the sample is stretched in transverse direction where the width of the sample is increasing. Hence, the draw ratio calculates from the current width of the sample over the original width of the sample. Preferably the draw ratio in machine direction of the biaxially oriented polypropylene ranges ft*om 4.0 to 8.0, more preferably from 4.5 to 6.5. The draw ratio in transverse direction of the biaxially polypropylene ranges preferably from 6.0 to 10.0, more preferably from 7.0 to 9.5. In a preferred embodiment the biaxially polypropylene has a draw ratio in machine direction fix)m, 4.5 to 7.0. in particular from 4.5 to 5.0, and a draw ratio in transverse direction from 6.0 to 10.0, in particular from 8.0 to 10.<br>
To obtain such a biaxially polypropylene preferably a process is applied as described below in the instant invention.<br><br>
The second requirement of the present invention is, that the biaxiaily polypropylene and/or said capacitor film has(have) a rather high electrical breakdown strength EB63%, i.e. an electrical breakdown strength EB63% according to lEC 60243-part 1 (1988) of at least 300 kV/mm, at a draw ratio in machine direction and in transverse direction of 4.0. More preferably the electrical breakdown strength EB63% of the biaxiaily polypropylene and/or said capacitor film at a draw ratio in machine direction and in transverse direction of 4.0 is(are) at least 350 kV/mm, still more preferably at least 400 kV/mm and yet more preferably at least 430 kV/mm. Further details about the measurement of the electrical breakdown strength are provided below in the examples.<br>
As stated above, the biaxiallly polypropylene is in particular characterized in that the electrical breakdown strength EB63% of the bixially oriented polypropylene disproportionately increases with increase of the stretching ratio, as can be seen in figure 2. Thus it is preferred that the electrical breakdown strength EB63% of the biaxiaily oriented polypropylene and/or of the capacitor film at a draw ratio in machine direction and in transverse direction of 5.0 is(are) at least 500 kV/mm, still more preferably at least 550 kV/mm and yet more preferably at least 580 kV/mra<br>
Moreover it is preferred that the capacitor film and/or the polypropylene of said capacitor film has/have xylene solubles of some extent, i.e. of at least 0.50 wt.-%. Xylene solubles are the part of the polymer soluble in cold xylene determined by dissolution in boiling xylene and letting the insoluble part crystallize from the cooling solution (for the method see below in the experimental part). The xylene solubles fraction contains polymer chains of low stereo-regularity and is an indication for the amount of non-crystalline areas.<br>
Preferably, the polypropylene component of the film has xylene solubles of more than 0.60 wt.-%. On the other hand, the amount of xylene solubles should not be too<br><br>
high since they represent a potential contamination risk. Accordingly it is preferred that the xylene solubles are not more than 1.00 wt.-% and still more preferably not more than 0.90 wt.-%. In preferred embodiments the xylene solubles are in the range of 0.60 to 1.00 wt.-% and more preferably in the range of 0.60 to 0.90 wt.-%.<br>
Preferably, the capacitor film has xylene solubles of more than 0.60 wt.-%. Even more preferred, the capacitor film has xylene solubles of not more than 1.00 wt.-% and more preferably of not more than 0.90 wt.-%. In particular, the film has xylene solubles in the range of 0.60 wt.-% to 1.00 wt.% and more preferably of 0.60 wt.-% to 0.90 wt.-%.<br>
Moreover it is preferred that the capacitor film according to this invention is further specified by its lamellar thickness distribution (see figure 7). It has been recognized that higher electrical breakdown strength is achievable in case the polymer comprises rather high amounts of thin lamellae. Thus the acceptance of the film as a capacitor film is independent fix)m the amounts of impurities present in the polypropylene but fix)m its crystalline properties. The stepwise isothermal segregation technique (SIST) provides a possibiUty to determine the lamellar thickness distribution. The exact method is defined in the example section. In the instant invention under lamellar thickness is understood the lamellar thickness of the polymer measured according to the stepwise isothermal segregation technique (SIST) method as defined in the example section. Rather high amounts of polymer fi:actions crystallizing at lower temperatures indicate a rather high amount of thin lamellae.<br>
Thus the inventive capacitor film and/or the polypropylene of the film is(are) characterized by a rather high amount of thin lamellae; i.e. a rather high amount of lamellae having a thickness of 
 <br>
Accordingly it is preferred that the inventive capacitor film and/or the polypropylene of the film comprise(s) at least 20 wt.-%, more preferred at least 30 wt.-%, yet more preferred at least 35 wt.-%, still more preferred at least 40 wt.-%, still yet more preferred at least 45 vvt.-% and most preferred at least 50 wt.-%, of a fi-action of lamellae with a thickness of 
More precisely and preferably the inventive capacitor film and/or the polypropylene of the film comprise(s) at least 12 wt.-%, more preferably at least 20 wt.-%, yet more preferably of at least 25 wt.-%, of a fraction of lamellae in the range of 5.55 nm to 7.19 nm. Furthermore it is preferred that the inventive capacitor film and/or the polypropylene of the film comprise(s) at least 5 wt.-%, more preferably at least 7 wt.-%, yet more preferably of at least 10 wt.-%, of a fraction of lamellae in the range of 4.52 nm to 5.55 nm.<br>
Thus it is preferred that the inventive capacitor fihn and/or the polypropylene of the fihn<br>
(a)	comprise(s) at least 20 wt.-%, more preferred at least 30 wt.-%, yet more preferred at least 35 wt.-%, still more preferred at least 40 wt.-%, still yet more preferred at least 45 wt.-% and most preferred at least 50 wt.-%, of a fraction of lamellae with a thickness of 
(b)	said fraction of lamellae with a thickness of 
(c)	at least 5 wt.-%, more preferably at least 7 wt.-%, yet more preferably of at least 10 wt.-%, of a fraction of lamellae in the range of 4.52 nm to 5.55 nm<br>
The method for determining the lamellar thickness distribution is described in detail in the example section. The weight percentages are based on the total amount of capacitor film and/or the polypropylene measured by SIST.<br><br>
The molecular weight distribution (MWD) is expressed as the ratio of weight average molecular weight (Mw) and number average molecular weight (Mn). The number average molecular weight (M„) Is an average molecular weight of a polymer expressed as the first moment of a plot of the number of molecules in each molecular weight range against the molecular weight. In effect, this is the total molecular weight of all molecules divided by the number of molecules. In turn, the weight average molecular weight (Mw) is the first moment of a plot of the weight of polymer in each molecular weight range against molecular weight.<br>
The number average molecular weight (M„) and the weight average molecular weight (Mw) as well as the molecular weight distribution (MWD) are determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using Waters Alliance GPCV 2000 instrument with online viscometer. The oven temperature is 140 °C. Trichlorobenzene is used as a solvent (ISO 16014).<br>
It is preferred that the capacitor film of the present invention comprises a polypropylene which has a weight average molecular weight (Mw) fi'om 10,000 to 2,000,000 &amp;'mol, more preferably from 20,000 to 1,500,000 g/mol.<br>
The number average molecular weight (M„) of the polypropylene is preferably in the range of 5,000 to 750,000 g/mol, more preferably from 10,000 to 750,000 g/mol.<br>
As a broad molecular weight distribution (MWD) improves the piocessability of the polypropylene the molecular weight distribution (MWD) is preferably up to 20.00, more preferably up to 10.00, still more preferably up to 8.00. However a rather broad molecular weight distribution stimulates sagging. Therefore, in an alternative embodiment the molecular weight distribution (MWD) is preferably between 1.00 to 8.00, still more preferably in the range of 1.00 to 4.00, yet more preferably in the range of 1.00 to 3.50.<br><br>
Furthermore, it is preferred that the polypropylene component of the film of the present invention has a melt flow rate (MFR) given in a specific range. The melt flow rate mainly depends on the average molecular weight. This is due to the fact that long molecules render the material a lower flow tendency than short molecules. An increase in molecular weight means a decrease in the MFR-value. The melt flow rate (MFR) is measured in g/10 min of the polymer discharged through a defined die under specified temperature and pressure conditions and the measure of viscosity of the polymer which, in turn, for each type of polymer is mainly influenced by its molecular weight but also by its degree of branching. The melt flow rate measured under a load of 2.16 kg at 230 °C (ISO 1133) is denoted as MFR2. Accordingly, it is preferred that in the present invention the capacitor film comprises a polypropylene which has an MFR2 up to 10.00 g/lOmin, more preferably up to 6.00 g/lOmin. In another preferred embodiment the polypropylene has MFR2 up to 4 g/lOmin. A preferred range for the MFR2 is 1.00 to 10.00 g/10 min, more preferably in the range of 1.00 to 8.00 g/IOmin, yet more preferably in the range of 1.00 to 6.00 g/lOmin.<br>
As cross-linking has a detrimental effect on the extensional flow properties it is preferred that the polypropylene according to this invention is non-cross-linked.<br>
More preferably, the polypropylene of the film according to this invention shall have a rather high isotacticity measured by meso pentad concentration (also referred herein as pentad concentration), i.e. higher than 91 %, more preferably higher than 93 %, still more preferably higher than 94 % and most preferably higher than 95 %. On the other hand pentad concentration shall be not higher than 99.5 %. The pentad concentration is an indicator for the narrowness in the regularity distribution of the polypropylene and measured by NMR-spectroscopy.<br>
In addition, it is preferred that the polypropylene of the capacitor film has a melting temperature Tm of higher than 148 °C, more preferred higher than 150 °C. In a<br><br>
preferred embodiment, melting temperature Tm of the polypropylene component is higher than 148 °C but below 156 °C. The measuring method for the melting temperature Tm is discussed in the example section.<br>
The melting temperature Tm of the capacitor film is preferably at least 148 °C, more preferably at least 150 °C. In a preferred embodiment, the melting temperature Tm of the capacitor film is higher than 150°C but below 160°C.<br>
Furthermore a rather high tensile modulus at a draw ratio of 4 in machine direction and a draw ratio of 4 in transverse direction is appreciated since biaxially oriented polypropylene fihns commercially are stretched with a draw ratio of 4 to 8, more preferably 4 to 6, in machine direction and with a draw ratio of 5 to 10, more preferably of 6 to 8, in transverse direction.<br>
Thus the polypropylene component of the film of the present invention has a tensile modulus of at least 800 MPa, measured according to ISO 527-3 at a cross head speed of Imm/min (with thickness of 100 |4,m). More preferably, the polypropylene component has a tensile modulus of at least 850 MPa, even more preferably 900 MPa, and yet more preferably at least 1000 MPa.<br>
Preferably, the biaxially oriented polypropylene film of the present invention has a tensile modulus of at least 1800 MPa at a draw ratio of 4.0 in machine direction and in transverse direction, wherein the tensile modulus is measured according to ISO 527-3 at a cross head speed of Imm/min (exact measuring method is provided in the example section). More preferably, the polypropylene film has a tensile modulus of at least 1900 MPa, even more preferably 1950 MPa, and most preferably at least 2200 MPa at a draw ratio of 4.0 in machine direction and in transverse direction.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the film has a stretching stress of at least 2.5 MPa in machine direction and at least 2.5 MPa in transverse direction at a stretching<br><br>
temperature of 152 °C or less and a draw ratio of 4 in machine direction and in transverse direction. Preferably, the stretching temperature mentioned above is at least 2°C, more preferably at least 3°C below the melting temperature of the film.<br>
In addition it is appreciated that the inventive capacitor film has good optical properties. Thus it is preferred that capacitor film has a haze of not more than 15, still more preferred not more than 10 measured according to ASTM D 1003-92 (exact measuring method is provided in the example section). In turn the transparency of the film shall be rather high. Thus it is preferred that the capacitor film has a transparency of at least 90 % measured according to ASTM D 1003-92.<br>
Preferably the polypropylene of the film according to this invention has low levels of impurities, i.e. low levels of aluminium (Al) residue and/or low levels of silicon residue (Si) and/or low levels of boron (B) residue. Accordingly the aluminium residues of the polypropylene can be lowered to a level of 12.00 ppm. Thus the aluminium residue content of the polypropylene of the film according to this invention is preferably below 20 ppm, more preferably below 18 ppm and yet more preferably 15 ppm. Preferred ranges of aluminium residues are 12 to 20 ppm, more preferred 12 to 18 ppm and yet more preferred 12 to 15 ppm. As stated above the polypropylene of the film according to this invention may comprise low values of silicon residue (Si) and/or boron (B) residue, i.e. below 40 ppm, more preferably below 20 ppm, yet more preferably below 10 ppm. Hence in one preferred embodiment the film according to this invention comprises a polypropylene which is preferably essentially free of any boron and/or silicon residues, i.e. residues thereof are not detectable (The analysis of residue contents is defined in the example section). Further it is preferred that the polypropylene of the film according to this invention is free of titanium and/or magnesium residues. In other words the polypropylene according to this invention has been preferably not produced with a catalyst system comprising titanium and/or magnesium. On the other hand the<br><br>
properties of this invention are not detrimentally influenced by the presence of residues.. In another preferred embodiment the polypropylene of the film according to this invention comprises boron and/or silicon in detectable amounts, i.e. in amounts of more than 0.10 ppm of boron residues and/or silicon residues, still more preferably in amounts of more than 0.20 ppm of boron residues and/or silicon residues, yet more preferably in amounts of more than 0.50 ppm of boron residues and/or silicon residues. In still another preferred embodiment the polypropylene component of the film according to this invention comprises Al residues in an amount of more than 12.00 ppm, even more preferred in an amount of more than 20.00 ppm, yet more preferred in an amount of more than 25.00 ppm. In yet another prefeiTcd embodiment the polypropylene component of the film according to this invention comprises boron and/or silicon in detectable amounts, i.e. in amounts of more than 0.20 ppm of boron residues and/or silicon residues, and aluminium residues in an amount of more than 12.00 ppm, even more preferred in an amount of more than 20.00 ppm and yet more preferred in an amount of more than 25.00 ppm.<br>
Moreover preferably the capacitor film according to this invention has low levels of impurities, i.e. low levels of aluminium (Al) residue and/or low levels of silicon residue (Si) and/or low levels of boron (B) residue. Accordingly the aluminium residues of the film can be lowered to a level of 12.00 ppm. Thus the aluminium residue content of the film according to this invention is preferably below 20 ppm, more preferably below 18 ppm and yet more preferably 15 ppm. Preferred ranges of aluminium residues are 12 to 20 ppm, more preferred 12 to 18 ppm and yet more preferred 12 to 15 ppm. As stated above the film according to this invention may comprise low values of silicon residue (Si) and/or boron (B) residue, i.e. below 40 ppm, more preferably below 20 ppm, yet more preferably below 10 ppm. Hence in one preferred embodiment the film according to this invention is preferably essentially fi-ee of any boron and/or silicon residues, i.e. residues thereof are not detectable (The analysis of residue contents is defined in the example section).<br><br>
Further it is preferred that the film according to this invention is fi-ee of titanium and/or magnesium residues. In other words the polypropylene according to this invention has been preferably not produced with a catalyst system comprising titanium and/or magnesium. On the other hand the properties of this invention are not detrimentally influenced by the presence of residues. Hence in one preferred embodiment the film according to this invention is preferably essentially fi-ee of any boron and/or silicon residues, i.e. residues thereof are not detectable (The analysis of residue contents is defined in the example section). In another preferred embodiment the film according to this invention comprises boron and/or silicon in detectable amounts, i.e. in amounts of more than 0.10 ppm of boron residues and/or silicon residues, still more preferably in amounts of more than 0.20 ppm of boron residues and/or silicon residues, yet more preferably in amounts of more than 0.50 ppm of boron residues and/or silicon residues. In still another preferred embodiment the film according to this invention comprises Al residues in an amount of more than 12.00 ppm, even more preferred in an amount of more than 20.00 ppm and yet more preferred in an amount of more than 25.00 ppm. In yet another preferred embodiment the film according to this invention comprises boron and/or silicon in detectable amounts, i.e. in amounts of more than 0.20 ppm of boron residues and/or silicon residues, and aluminium residues in an amount of more than 12.00 ppm, even more preferred in an amount of more than 20.00 ppm and yet more preferred in an amount of more than 25.00 ppm.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the polypropylene as defmed above (and fiirther defined below) is preferably unimodal. In another preferred embodiment the polypropylene as defined above (and further defined below) is preferably multimodal, more preferably bimodal.<br>
"Muhimodal" or "multimodal distribution" describes a frequency distribution that has several relative maxima (contrary to unimodal having only one maximum). In<br><br>
particular, the expression "modality of a polymer" refers to the forai of its molecular weight distribution (MWD) curve, i.e. the appearance of the graph of the polymer weight fraction as a function of its molecular weight. If the polymer is produced in the sequential step process, i.e. by utilizing reactors coupled in scries, and using different conditions in each reactor, the different polymer fractions produced in the different reactors each have their own molecular weight distribution which may considerably differ from one another. The molecular weight distribution curve of the resulting final polymer can be seen at a super-imposing of the molecular weight distribution curves of the polymer fraction which will, accordingly, show a more distinct maxima, or at least be distinctively broadened compared with the curves for individual fractions.<br>
A polymer showing such molecular weight distribution curve is called bimodal or multimodal, respectively.<br>
In case the polypropylene of the capacitor film is not unimodal it is preferably bimodal.<br>
The polypropylene of the film according to this invention can be a homopolymer or a copolymer. In case the polypropylene is unimodal the polypropylene is preferably a polypropylene homopolymer. In turn in case the polypropylene is multimodal, more preferably bimodal, the polypropylene can be a polypropylene homopolymer as well as a polypropylene copolymer. However it is in particular preferred that in case the polypropylene is multimodal, more preferably bimodal, the polypropylene is a polypropylene homopolymer. Furthermore it is preferred that at least one of the fractions of the multimodal polypropylene is a polypropylene according to this invention, more preferably a polypropylene homopolymer according to the instant invention.<br><br>
The polypropylene of the capacitor film according to this invention is most preferably a unimodal polypropylene homopolymer.<br>
The expression polypropylene homopolymer as used in this invention relates to a polypropylene that consists substantially, i.e. of at least 97 wt%, preferably of at least 99 wt%, and most preferably of at least 99.8 wt% of propylene units. In a preferred embodiment only propylene units in the polypropylene homopolymer are detectable. The comonomcr content can be measured with FT infrared spectroscopy. Further details are provided below in the examples.<br>

The temperature of said stretched sheet during the longitudinal drawing is preferably controlled in such a way as to be within the temperature range of the melting point of the polypropylene as defined herein (-15 or + 5°C). The uniformity of the film thickness on transverse drawing can be evaluated with the method in which a fixed region on the film is masked after drawing in the length direction and measuring the actual drawing factor by measuring the spacing of the said masking after transverse drawing.<br>
Subsequently, the film can treated by corona discharge in air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide gas or any of the mixtures on the surface to be metallized, lo improve the adhesive strength to the metal to be deposited, and wound by a winder.<br>

P.       SIST<br>
Stepwise Isothermal Segregation Technique (SIST): The isothermal crystallisation<br>
for SIST analysis was performed in a Mettler tA820 DSC on 3±0.5 mg samples at<br>
decreasing temperatures between 200°C and 105°C.<br>
(i)	The samples were melted at 225 °C for 5 min.,<br>
(ii)	then cooled with 80 °C/min to 145 °C<br><br>
(iii)	held for 2 hours at 145 °C,<br>
(iv)	then cooled with 80 °C/min to 135 °C<br>
(v)	held for 2 hours at 135 °C,<br>
(vi)	then cooled with 80 °C/min to 125 °C<br>
(vii)	held for 2 hours at 125 °C,<br>
(viii)	then cooled with 80 °C/min to 115 °C<br>
(ix)	held for 2 hours at 115 °C,<br>
(x)	then cooled with 80 °C/min to 105 °C<br>
(xi)	held for 2 hours at 105 °C.<br>
After the last step the sample was cooled down to ambient temperature, and the<br>
melting curve was obtained by heating the cooled sample at a heating rate of<br>
10°C/min up to 200°C. All measurements were performed in a nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
The mch enthalpy is recorded as function of temperature and evaluated through<br>
measuring the meh enthalpy of fractions melting within temperature intervals as<br>
indicated for example E 1 in the table 6 to 8.<br>
The melting curve of the material crystallised this way can be used for calculating<br>

Q.      Electrical breakdown strength (EB63%)<br>
It follows standard lEC 60243- part 1 (1988).<br>
The method describes a way to measure the electrical breakdown strength for<br>
insulation materials on compression moulded plaques.<br>
Definition:<br><br><br>
The electrical field strength in the test sample at which breakdown occurs. In homogeneous plaques and films this corresponds to the electrical breakdown strength divided by the thickness of the plaque/film (d), unit: kV/mm. The electrical breakdown strength is determined at 50 Hz within a high voUage cabinet using metal rods as electrodes as described in IEC60243-1 (4.1.2). The voltage is raised over the film/plaque at 2 kV/s until a breakdown occurs.<br>

A biaxiaily oriented film is prepared as follows:<br>
In the biaxial stretching Device Bruckner Karo IV, film samples are clamped and extended in both, longitudinal and transverse direction, at constant stretching speed. The length of the sample increases during stretching in longitudinal direction and the stretch ratio in longitudinal direction calculates from the ratio of current length over original sample length. Subsequently, the sample is stretched in transverse direction where the width of the sample is increasing. Hence, the stretch ratio calculates from the current width of the sample over the original width of the sample. In Table 5 the ci7Stallization behaviour of samples is determined via stepwise isothermal segregation technique (SIST).<br>
