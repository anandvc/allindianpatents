				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an air conditioning apparatus, and more particularly, to an air conditioner which employs a low-pressure pump and utilizes air-energy to drive the cooling and heating cycles.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
The differential heat-exchanging tube (hereinafter abbreviated as J tube) is a high efficiency heat transfer device in which large quantities of heat flowing over a unit area thereof is possible and the temperature difference at the end point of heat transfer approaches zero. An air conditioner which uses evaporating J tubes, condensing J tubes and a low-pressure heat pump is known to have higher efficiency. However, only the theory of operation for the cooling/heating cycle of the above air conditioner is provided in the prior art. Other aspects such as increasing the heat-exchanging rate and the thermal cycle efficiency of the J tube remain unknown. Furthermore, there are still some problems with the use of J tubes, especially the cooling weight ratio, volume ratio, manufacturing technique and cost. Therefore, it is difficult to solve the three major problems (high energy consumption, low air quality and limited use of CFCS) for air conditioners with the J tubes. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTON<br>
To solve the aforementioned problem, the present invention provides a high EER ah conditioner which comprises differential heat exchangers (J1, J2) and a low-pressure pump (M).<br>
In the heat exchanger J,: There are a plurality of J, pieces interlaced in layers with a plurality of square wave shaped fins, which are securely clamped by a frame formed by ribbed clamp plates and rods. A soft gasket is attached at the position where the clamp plate and the square wave shaped fin touch. A <br><br>
substantially rectangular air flue is formed by the square wave shaped fins and J, piece. The air flue has an S shape in the direction of air flow. A plurality of long, heat-isolation apertures are respectively set in each vertical wall of the square wave shaped fin. A slender rectangular pad is provided at each of the two terminals of each square wave shaped fin. The square wave shaped fin is made of thin aluminum pieces (or hydrophilic aluminum). Several equally spaced flat tubes are provided in each J, piece, each flat tube (14) being inserted with an inner wave-shaped plate made of thin aluminum thereby forming a continuous non-isothermal (t|~tj flowing channel for the working medium. A curved path (6) is set on the flowing channel. The flat tube has two ends respectively connected to a liquid-intake sub-tube and a vapor-outlet sub-tube for the entrance and exit of the flowing of the vvorking medium. The vapor-outlet sub-tube is connected in parallel to a parallel tube for connection with a vapor-outlet tube. The liquid-intake sub-tube is connected in parallel to a distributor for connection with a capillary tube which is connected to a liquid-outlet tube.<br>
In the heat exchanger J2: A plurality of J2 pieces are interlaced in layers with a plurality of fms, which are securely clamped by a frame formed by ribbed clamp plates and rods. A soft gasket is attached at the position where the clamp plate and the fins touch. A substantially rectangular air flue is formed by the fms and Jj piece. The air flue has an S shape in the direction of air flow. A plurality of long, heat-isolation apertures are respectively set in each vertical wall of the fin. A slender rectangular pad is provided at each of the two terminals of each fin. Several equally spaced metal (copper or aluminum) flat tubes are provided in each J3 piece. Each flat tube is inserted with an inner wave-shaped plate made of thin aluminum thereby forming a confinuous non-isothermal (ti"-tn") flow channel for the working medium. A curved path is set on the flow channel. The flat tube having two ends respectively connected to a vapor-inlet sub-tube and a liquid-outlet sub-tube for the entrance and exit of the flow of the working medium. The vapor-inlet sub-tube is connected in parallel to a parallel tube for<br><br>

FIG. 1 schematically illustrates the circulation theory of the present invention, in which J,, J2, M, m stand for J, tube bundle, J; tube bundle, low-pressure pump and capillary tube, respectively. The low-pressure pump (M) is connected between the vapor-inlet tube of J2 and the vapor-outlet tube of J;. If a heat pump is used, a four-way valve is further provided. The capillary tube (m) is connected between the liquid-outlet tube of Jj and the liquid-intake tube of J,.<br>
Because the J tube has a high heat-exchange efficiency, it is possible to have heat-conducting temperature differences of 0.1-0.5 °C when each of the J, tube bundles and J2 tube bundles is partitioned into 2-5 temperature zones.<br>
The working pressure of the J, tube bundle is P, and the working pressure of<br><br>
the J2 tube bundle is P2.<br>
The ambient outside air (a3) flows the J, tube bundle to be cooled from tn„ to t| to become the conditioned air {a2) wherein a2 has a temperature of t1, and a3 has a temperature of tn.<br>
The indoor ambient air (al) flows through the J1 tube bundle to be heated from t1" to tn" to become the exhaust air (a4) after absorbing humidity wherein t1," approaches the wet bulb temperature of al.<br>
The dilute solution X1, which is formulated from absorbent and corresponding refrigerant, flows through the Jj tube bundle to be cooled to a temperature of t,", and the pressure thereof is decreased by the capillary (m) to P,. Then the solution X2 is gradually heated in J, tube by flowing through t1,~t„ to transform to a mixture X3, which contains over-heated refrigerant vapor and concentrated absorbent solution, with a temperature approaching the dry bulb temperature of a3. The mixture X3 is transformed to X, by increasing its pressure from P| to P2 by the low-pressure pump (M), and then it flows through J; to be gradually cooled from tn" to t1," and returns to the dilute solution X^. The concentrated absorbent solution cooled by flowing through J2 from t^," tot," has a relatively low surface pressure thereby being strongly capable of absorbing the vapor refrigerant. Therefore, the balanced condensing pressure of the Jj tube bundle is lower than P2.<br>
A base plate is provided for a window-type air conditioner or the outdoor unit of a split-type air conditioner with the high efficiency J tube. The base plate stores a predetermined amount of aqueous solution or the like. The condensed water on J, drops to the base plate via a drain pipe, and a predetermined amount is periodically sprayed over the air flues (F) of J; under the control of a water circulation system. The air flue (F) is capable of carrying and absorbing water so that a huge surface evaporating water film can be formed when the air flue (F) is wet, and further, the internal water layer thereof has good heat conductivity. Therefore, j2 dissipates heat in a continuous all-wet state so that t," can approach<br><br>
the wet bulb temperature of al and the temperature increase of t1"~-tn" is relatively small. The above description is known as "8-shaped circulation".<br>
When the air flowing through the J, tube bundle to be cooled is the indoor air (al) and the cold air flowing through J3 is the outdoor air a3, X3 can only be heated to the dry bulb temperature of al (al<a3 and the lowest temperature t1 of j2 tube bundle can only be wet bulb a3 wherein is higher than that al. because changes in properties air flowing through j bundles circulation evolved to a circulation.></a3>
In comparison with the conventional air conditioner, the J, tube bundle is equivalent to the evaporator, and the J2 tube bundle is equivalent to the condenser. The differences consist of the evaporating pressure P, of J, being higher than that of the conventional air conditioner while the condensing temperature and pressure P2 are lower than those of the conventional air conditioner. Therefore, less than i/3 net power is required for the low-pressure pump (M) to drive an air conditioner when compared with a compressor to drive a conventional air conditioner with the same flux. However, the refrigerating capacity is more than doubled.<br>
With reference to FIG, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, the heat exchanger J2 comprises a plurality of J2 pieces (1) interlaced in layers with a plurality of fms (2) which are securely clamped together by a frame formed by ribbed clamp plates (3) and rods (4). The air flues (F) to allow passage of the cooling air (al-a4) are formed by the fms (2) and J2 pieces (1). There is a slender rectangular pad (7) at each end of each row of fms (2). A soft gasket (18) is attached at the position where the clamp plate (3) and the fms (2) touch. Each J2 piece (I) forms a complete non-isothermal (t„"-t|") working medium channel in a flat tube (14). At the entrance for the working medium, a vapor-inlet sub-tube (8) is connected in parallel to a parallel tube (9) (or distributor) of a vapor-inlet tube (10). At the exit for the working medium, a liquid-outlet sub-tube (11) is connected in parallel to a<br><br>
parallel tube (12) (or distributor) of a liquid-outlet tube (13).<br>
In FIG. 3 and 4, two equally spaced flat tubes (14) are shown in the Jj piece (1). Each flat tube (14) has an inner wave-shaped plate (15) made of thin aluminum inserted to augment the heat-dissipation area of the working medium. A curved path is set on the place where the working medium makes a turn. The entrance and exit positions for the working medium are connected to the liquid-outlet sub-tube (11) and vapor-inlet sub-tube (8) respectively. The flat tube (14) is surrounded with a moisture evaporation film (16). Two water-carrying yam strips (20) are inserted between the flat tube (14) and the moisture evaporation film (16). The water-carrying yam strip (20) is divided by a heat-isolation strip (19) made of heat-isolation material to form two temperature zones. Therefore, each flat tube (14) forms an isothermal heat-exchanging zone. The narrow, thin flat tube (14) can be manufactured by pressing thin metal tubes with a thickness of about ij) 6mm.<br>
FIG. 5 is a cross sectional view of the J2 piece wherein the slender round tubes (14"), each with an inner wave-shaped plate (15), form the flow channel for the working medium. Each slender round tube (14") constitutes an isothermal heat-exchanging zone by taking the heat-isolation strip (19) as the border. The use of slender round tubes (14") has advantages in having multiple temperature zones and reducing the pressure on the wave-shaped fin (2) and clamp plate (3). The flat tube (14) and the slender round tube (14") can be made from metal with heat-resistance and erosion-resistance characteristics.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5 and 6, the wave-shaped fin (2) is shown, which is formed by a thin metal piece or metal net having two faces bonded with non-woven fabric. A square wave shaped fins (21) having two faces covered by ladder film (22) are further provided to constitute the fin (2). The fin(2) is provided with a long heat-isolation aperture (17) in the vertical wall of the upper portion of the heat-isolation strip (19) to partition the temperature zones. Further, cooled air moves swiftly in the he at-isolation aperture (17) thereby enhancing<br><br>
the heat-exchange. The square wave shaped fins (21), which is used as a supporting skeleton, can be made of extremely thin and erosion-resistant metal (such as stainless steel) piece or fine metal net. The moisture evaporation film (16), ladder film (22) and water-carrying yam strip (20) can be made from erosion-resistant non-woven fabric with good water-carrying and water-absorbing characteristics. When wet, the moisture evaporation film (16), ladder film (22) and water-carrying yam strip (20) are all full of water. The air flue (F) formed by the ladder film (22) and moisture evaporation film (16) has a huge evaporating surface area. Further, the wet layer has good heat conductivity. The water contained in the water-carrying yam-strip (20) makes the surface of the air flue (F) continuously wet thereby extending the time interval between spraying water as long as possible and further increasing the heat-conductivity between the J2 piece (1) and wave film (1). Because the air flue (F) is continuously wet, X2 can be cooled to the wet bulb temperature of al. In addition, the shape of the above ladder-shaped air flue (F) can be designed in an S shape for air flow to enhance the heat exchange.<br>
The mixture X1, which has a pressure of P2 by the low-pressure pump (M) and contains over-heated refrigerant vapor and condensed absorbent solution, enters each air-inlet sub-tube (8) via the vapor-inlet tube (10) and parallel tube (9). In the flat mbe (14) or slender round tube (14"), the mixture Xi transforms to dilute solution X2 by passing through t^"-t," and being gradually cooled to the wet bulb temperature of ah The solution X; then enters the parallel tube (12) via each liquid-ouflet sub-tube and further flows toward the J, mbe bundle via the liquid-outlet tube (13).<br>
FIG. 7 is a cross sectional view of an arc-shaped J2" tube bundle, wherein the J2 piece (1) bas three equally spaced flat tubes (14) arranged in the direction of the arc and form corresponding concentric circle segments. The wave fin (2) and the air flue (F) are arranged in a fan shape. The other stmcture of the J2" tube bundle is the same as that of the J1 tube bundle. The J2" tube bundle further<br><br>
increases the heat-dissipation area and reduces the air resistance, the cooling weight ratio and the volume ratio.<br>
Either J2 or J2" is an all-wet type heat exchanger with very high heat exchanging efficiency. They can be applied in various situations. Generally, they are used as condensers. However, they can be used as evaporators.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, 9 and 10, the J, heat-exchanger comprises a plurality of J, pieces (30) interlaced in layers with a plurality of square wave shaped fins (31) and ftirther securely clamped by a frame formed by ribbed clamp plates (3) and rods (4). The air flue (F") for cooling air (a3-a2) is formed by the square wave shaped fin (31) and J, piece (30). There is a slender rectangular pad (7) at each end ofthe rowof square wave shaped fins (31). A soft gasket (18) is attached at the position where the clamp plate (3) and square wave shaped fms (31) touch. Each J1 piece (30) forms a complete non-isothermal (tn-t1") working medium channel in a flat tube (14). At the entrance for the working medium, liquid-intake sub-tubes (23) connect to a distributor (24) of a capillary tube (25). At the exit for the working medium, air-outlet sub-tubes (27) connect to a parallel tube (28) (or distributor) of an air-outlet tube (29).<br>
The square wave shaped fin (31) is made of thin aluminum. The dimension (height and length) of the ladder-shaped air flue (F") is designed according to the heat-dissipation characteristic of air and the temperature difference in heat transfer for refrigeration. The curvature of the ladder-shaped air flue (F") is relatively small and therefore the shape of the air flue (F") is close to a rectangle. In addition, the shape of the above ladder-shaped air flue (F") can be an S shape to enhance the air flow heat exchange. A plurality of long heat-isolation apertures (17) are respectively set in each vertical wall of the square wave shaped fin (31) above a heat-isolation cavity (32) to partition the temperature zones and enhance the heat exchange efficiency.<br>
In FIG. 9 and 10, there are three equally spaced flat tubes (14) in the J, piece (30), each with an inner wave-shaped plate (15) in order to augment the heat-<br><br>
dissipation area of the working medium. A curved path (6) is provided where the working medium makes a turn. The flat tube (14) is surrounded by a thin aluminum piece such that the air flue (F") is a continuous and uniform channel. Because the thin aluminum piece is used at the position where the J, piece (30) and the square wave shaped fm (31) are combined, electrolytic corrosion does not easily result therebetween. The closed chamber formed between the thin aluminum piece and the flat tube (14) is a heat-isolation cavity (32), which is used to partition temperature zones for heat-conductivity such that each flat tube forms an isothermal heat exchange zone. The flat tube (14) preferably has a small width and thin wall thereby reducing the pressure on the square wave shaped fin (31) and clamp plate (3) and having better expansion effect to make the J| piece (30) and square wave shaped fin (31) more close for enhancing the heat exchange performance.<br>
The dilute solution X2, which contains absorbent and refrigerant, enters a distribution point (34) from the liquid-outlet tube (13) and flows toward each capillary tube (25) to further enter the respective set of distributors (24) and flow to the ■working medium channel of J1 via each liquid-intake sub-tube (23). The solution X2 is gradually heated by the outdoor air to the dry bulb temperature of a3 and transforms to the mixture X3, which contains over-heated refrigerant vapor and concentrated absorbent solution. The mixture X3 enters the parallel tube (28) (or distributor) from the vapor-outlet sub-tube (27) to be extracted by the low-pressure motor (M) via the vapor-outlet tube (29). Meanwhile, the outdoor air a3 becomes al by being cooled and dehumidified in the air flue (F), wherein the temperature of al is close to the evaporating temperature of the refrigerant in the J, piece (30). The water-leakage yam-strip (33) on the left side of the J1 piece (30) results in forming a continuous water-flowing surface on the output face of the air flue (F") of J, tube thereby removing the condensed water on the surface of the square wave shaped fm (31). The material for manufacturing the square wave shaped fin (31) and the thin aluminum piece for<br><br>
surrounding the J1 piece (30) should be hydrophilic aluminum.<br>
Similar to the J2 tube, an arc-shaped J," tube can be manufactured by modifying the J, tube. In general, the J, tube is used as an evaporator; however, it can be used as a condenser in a J1-J1 type air conditioner. Because the J1 tube is a high efficiency heat exchanger, it can be used in various situations.<br>
FIG. 11 schematically illustrates the architecture of a J1-J2 knife-shaped circulation split-type air conditioner wherein the J1 tube bundle is used as an evaporator and the J2 tube bundle is used as a condenser.<br>
The indoor unit includes a J1 (or J1") tube and a fan (37) installed in front of the J1 tube bundle. The indoor air al is drawn by the fan (37) to flow through a filter (36) to the J, tube bundle to be cooled and become a2, which is then directed from the adjustable air-door (35) to indoors. The temperature of a2 can be set by the pressure status of P|. Condensed water is directed to a base plate of the outdoor unit by a drain tube (41) connected to an opening (38). The liquid-outlet tube (13) is connected to an opening (39), and the air-outlet tube (29) is connected to an opening (40). Because the air resistance of J[ (or J,") tube is low, the fan (37) can be an axial flow fan.<br>
The outdoor unit includes a J2 (or J2") tube bundle, a fan (26), a low-pressure pump (M), a base plate, a water level controller and a water circulation system, The outdoor air a3 is drawn by the fan (26), arranged to the right of the J2 tube bundle, to flow through a water baffle (50) to the air flue (F) of J2 tube to be heated and dehumidified to become a4 which is then exhausted outdoors. The water level in the base plate is controlled by the water-supply tube of the water level controller. The water circulation system comprises a water pump (47), a filter (48) and spraying no22le(s) (49), which are connected together by tubes, to automatically and periodically spray a predetermined amount of water over the windward face of J2. The low-pressure pump (M) is installed inside the base plate, and the water baffle (50) is mounted on the air-inlet opening to nrevent water from splashing out.<br><br>
The use of the connection tube of the J1-J2 knife-shaped circulation spilt-type air conditioner is the same as that of a conventional air conditioner. The liquid-outlet tube (13) is connected to a valve (45) in the outdoor unit. The vapor-outlet tube (29) is connected to another valve (44) in the outdoor unit. The drain tube (41) is connected to an opening (46) in the outdoor unit to direct condensed water to the base plate.<br>
The J1-J2 knife-shaped circulation spilt-type air conditioner has high thermal cycle efficiency. Although its outdoor unit can work with the indoor unit of the conventional spiit-type air conditioner, the efficiency may be decreased.<br>
FIG. 12 schematically illustrates the architecture of a J1-J2 knife-shaped circulation window-type air conditioner wherein the J, tube bundle is used as an evaporator and the J2 tube bundle is used as a condenser. Its ventilation structure is the same as that in the conventional air conditioner. A centrifugal fan (55) is installed on the back of J2 to draw air through J,. The indoor air al at one side of the panel is drawn via a filter (36) to the air flues (F") of J, to be cooled and become a3 which is directed through a filtering channel to an air door (35) at the side of the panel to flow indoors. The outdoor air a3 is drawn to the air flue (F) of J2 via a water baffle for being heated and dehumidified and becomes al which is exhausted outdoors by a fan (26). The water level in the base plate is controlled by a slender water-supply lube (51) and a water level controller comprising a floating ball (54), a clutch opening (53) and a supporting post (52). A water circulation system comprising a water pump (47) and a filter (48) automatically and periodically sprays a predetermined amount of water (generally spraying for 15 seconds every 20 minutes) over the windward face of J2. A low-pressure pump (M) is installed inside the base plate. Water baffles are mounted on the air-inlet openings at two sides of the unit.<br>
FIG. 13 schematically illustrates the architecture of a J,"-!:" knife-shaped circulation window-type air conditioner. A fan (37) is ananged in the concave portion of the indoor side of the air conditioner. The fan (37) draws the indoor air<br><br>
al through the air-inlet openings (58) on the two indoor sides of the air conditioner, the filter (36), and the air flues (F") from the convex face of J1 to be cooled to become a2 which is directed indoors via an adjustable air-door (35). Further, a fan (26) is arranged in the concave portion of the outdoor side of the air conditioner. The fan (26) draws the outdoor air a3 through the water baffles (50) at the sides of the air conditioner outside the wall (56) and the air flues (F) from the convex face of J2" to be heated to become a4 which is directed outdoors.<br>
A protection grille (59) is provided at the outdoor side to protect the fan (26). The arc-shaped partition (57) in the middle of the air conditioner is used for heat-isolation and to separate the air flues (F, F"). Similarly, a water circulation system, a water-level controller and the low-pressure pump (M) are installed in the base plate of the air conditioner.<br>
FIG. 14 schematically illustrates the architecture of a J1"-J2" 8-shaped circulation window-type air conditioner. Two fans (37, 26) are arranged in the concave portion of the indoor outdoor side of the air conditioner, respectively. The fans (37) draws the outdoor air a3 through the filter (36) from two oblique windows (60) at the sides of the air conditioner outside the wall (56) and through the air flues (F") from the convex face of J," to be cooled to become a2 which is directed indoors via an adjustable air-door (35). The temperature of a2 is set by the pressure P1. The indoor air al is drawn through the air-inlet openings (58) at the sides of the air conditioner inside the wall (56) and into the air flues (F) from the convex face of J2" to be heated to become a4 which is directed outdoors. A water circulation system, a water-level controller and a low-pressure pump (M) are also installed in the base plate of the air conditioner.<br>
Both of the aforementioned knife-shaped circulation and 8-shaped circulation window-type air conditioners are provided with the water circulation system and water level controller so that the water waste is limited. If a water shortage is encountered, a proper amount of non-volatile glycerin or glycol aqueous solution is added to the base plate whereby a balanced water supply<br><br>
circulation environment is provided.<br>
FIG. 15 schematically illustrates the structure of a J2"-J2" knife-circulation heat-pump window-type air conditioner which uses J2" tube bundles as the condenser and the evaporator for heat transfer when generating hot air. If cold air is generated, its fan, J tube bundle and ventilation structure are the same as those of the J1"-J2" knife-shaped circulation window-type air conditioner shown in FIG. 13. The difference is that each air-inlet opening (58) at the indoor side is modified to an adjustable air-door. The adjustable air-door can be used as a water baffle when generating hot air. The base plate is divided by a partition (57) into an indoor base plate and an outdoor base plate, each containing aqueous solution. Each J2" tube bundle is provided with a water circulation system comprising a water pump, filters, spraying nozzle and connection tubes. Non¬volatile glycerin or glycol aqueous solution may be added to the base plate to form a balanced water circulation environment.<br>
When generating cold air, the water pump (47) pumps the dilute aqueous solution in the indoor base plate to automatically and periodically spray a predetermined amount of the solution on the outdoor J2" tube. Meanwhile, the water pump (47") pumps the concentrated aqueous solution in the outdoor base plate to automatically and periodically spray a predetermined amount of the solution on the indoor J2" tube, thereby forming a balanced water circulation system.<br>
When generating hot air, the indoor Jj" tube bundle is used as a condenser and the outdoor J2" tube bundle is used as an evaporator by employing a communication valve and the rotation directions of the indoor fan (37) and outdoor fan (26) are all reversed. The indoor air a3 flows through the adjustable air-door (35) and enters the air flue (F") from the convex face of J2" to be heated and humidified to become a4 which is directed indoors via an adjustable air-door (35). The outdoor air a3 flows through the protection grille (59) enters the air flue (F") from the convex face of J," to be cooled and dehumidified to become a2<br><br>
which is directed outdoors via the water baffles (50) at two sides of the air conditioner outside the wall (56). Similarly, the water pump (47) pumps the concentrated aqueous solution in the indoor base plate to automatically and periodically spray a predetermined amount of the solution on the convex portion of the outdoor J2" tube bundle to prevent frosting on the surface of the air flue. Meanwhile, the water pump (47) pumps the dilute aqueous solution in the outdoor base plate to spray over the convex portion of the indoor J2" tube bundle to adjust the humidity of al, thereby a balanced water circulation environment is formed and the required humidity is provided.<br>
When a lithium chloride or lithium bromide aqueous solution is added in the base plate, anti-eroding stainless steel must be used to manufacture the flat tube (14) or the slender round tube (14") ofthe J2 piece. When generating cold air, it is applicable to simply use water in the base plate as the working medium for external circulation.<br>
The J2;-J2" knife-shaped circulation heat-pump window-type air conditioner I can be divided into an indoor part and an outdoor part along the partition. Therefore, a J2-J2 knife-shaped circulation heat-pump split-type air conditioner can be made with the same theory and architecture.<br>
FIG. 16 schematically illustrates the structure of a J2"-J2" 8-shaped circulation heat-pump window-type air conditioner which uses J2" tube bundles as the condenser and the evaporator for heat transfer. When used to generate cold air, its air circulation is the same as that of the J2"-J2" 8-shaped circulation window-type air conditioner shown in FIG. 14. The base plate is divided by a partition (61) into an indoor base plate and an outdoor base plate. Each J2" tube bundle is provided with a water circulation system. Non-volatile glycerin or glycol aqueous solution may be added to the base plate to be used for the working medium for external circulation.<br>
When generating cold air, the water pump (47) pumps the dilute aqueous solution in the indoor base plate to automatically and periodically spray a<br><br>
predelermined amount of the solution on the outdoor J2" tube bundle. Meanwhile, the water pump (47") pumps the concentrated aqueous solution in the outdoor base plate to automatically and periodically spray a predetermined amount of the solution on the indoor J2" tube bundle, thereby forming an external working medium circulation. It is noted that the indoor fan (37) and outdoor fan (26) must stop rotating when the solution is sprayed.<br>
When generating hot air, the indoor J2" tube bundle is used as a condenser and the outdoor J2" tube bundle is used as an evaporator by employing a communication valve. The indoor air al flows through the adjustable air-door (58) at the indoor sides to the outdoor J2" tube to be cooled to become a2 which is directed outdoors. The outdoor air a3 flows through the oblique windows located at the external top portion of the wall (56) to the indoor J2" bundle to be heated and humidified to become a4 which is directed indoors via an adjustable air-door (35). The working medium for external circulation and the water circulation system are the same as those of the J2"-J2" knife-shaped circulation heat-pump window-type air conditioner.<br>
The purpose of using absorbent and corresponding refrigerant as the working medium pair to circulate in the above knife-shaped circulation and 8-shaped circulation air conditioners is to store the heat released in the cooling process into the absorbent solution as much as possible (transferring into chemical energy for absorbing). In other words, the absorbent solution is heated and concentrated by the cooled air to lower the condensing pressure (P2) as much as possible thereby providing a minimum AP (P2-P1) for the low-pressure pump (M). The working medium can be formed from either a single type of refrigerant or mixed refrigerants (instead of working medium pair) for circulating in one J-tube air conditioner to obtain the maximum cooling capacity. However, the air conditioner is operated in accordance with a Kano or Lawrence circulation.<br>
The best working medium for external circulation of the J1(J1")-J2(J2")8-<br><br>
shaped circulation or knife-shaped circulation air conditioner is water which can greatly decrease the condensing pressure (P2) and temperature of the J2 tube. The purpose of adding glycerin or glycol aqueous solution into the base plate is to enhance the condensing capability of the J2 tube bundle when a water shortage is encountered (the water supply is not continuous).<br>
The J1(J1")-j2(J2) 8-shaped circulation or knife-shaped circulation air conditioner is constituted by two J2 tubes, each having a water circulation system. When the working medium in the base plate is a lithium bromide, lithium chloride or calcium chloride saline aqueous solution, concentrated saline aqueous solution sprays on the air-output face of J2 tube bundle, which is used as an evaporator, such that the surfaces of the moisture evaporation film (16) of the air flues (F) and the fins (2) are uniformly covered with the aqueous solution. The cooled air in the air flues (F) results in a strong effect for humidifying and heating thereby greatly enhancing the heat exchanging performance of the J2 tube bundle. The working medium circulated in the J2 piece can also obtain heat energy from the air being cooled as much as possible. Moreover, the evaporating temperature and the pressure (P,) can be set high so that the air flues (F) absorbs heat and moisture from the air being cooled to prevent frosting on the surface thereof in heating operation. The concentrated saline aqueous solution is gradually diluted after absorbing water and releasing heat on the surface of the air flues (F) and then flows to the base plate.<br>
The water circulation system in the condensing J2 tube bundle periodically extracts the cooled air (or the heated air when the air conditioner is used as a heater) sprayed toward the J2 tube. The extracted air is dehumidified and heated on the surface of the air flues (F) and gradually transforms to concentrated saline aqueous solution for flowing to the base plate. The water circulation system in the evaporating j2 tube bundle operates in a similar manner. The functions of the two J2 tube bundles can be exchanged for generating cold air or heated air. The previous described circulation refers to an external 8-shaped circulation which<br><br>
can enhance the thermal cycie efficiency by increasing the evaporating pressure of P1. In particular, it can increase the temperature and humidity of the air being heated and prevent defrosting on the surface of the air flues (F) of the evaporating tube J2.<br>
Glycerin or glycol aqueous solution-can be used as working medium for external circulation to prevent defrosting on the surface: of the air flue.(F) of the evaporating tube J2 and increase the temperature.and;humidity.of.the.hot air output from the condensing J2 tube bundle thereby making the air more comfortable when the air conditioner is used as a heater and ensuring that the water supplied by the slender water-supply tube is insufficient when the air conditioner is used to cool.<br>
Although the present invention has been explained in relation to its preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that many other possible modifications and variations can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed.<br><br><br>
