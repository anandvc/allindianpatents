				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the field of MFP (Multi Functional Peripheral). Further, this invention relates to continuous handling of different jobs in MFPs. More particularly, this invention explains a method for automatic continuous function handling of the documents fed in automatic documents feeder.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
US patent number 6,581,923 titled "Automatic sheet feeder" relates to a mechanism of Automatic Document Feeder used in MFP.<br>
The related art explains the usage of a generic Document Feeder that is used in MFP's. Generally an automatic document feeder (ADF) is used in a facsimile machine, photocopier or the like. In the prior art a sheet path from a sheet inlet to outlet is defined by lower, intermediate and upper frames of the ADF. The sheet path is generally shaped like "C" when viewed laterally. The intermediate frame has a pivotable member that can be opened and closed, and a guide member for guiding a sheet passing over a platen glass. An elastic member is provided for biasing the guide member on the platen surface from a turning portion of the C-shaped sheet path. Therefore, it is possible to maintain a clearance between the platen surface and guide member and prevent the sheet from flapping. A retard roller is removably supported by the pivotable member. Further, the pivotable member is a one-piece element and made from resin. A plurality of ribs extending in a sheet feed direction are provided near the sheet inlet and/or outlet.<br>
In the current invention, the documents fed from the ADF are dynamically separated for the various functionalities provided by MFP. Dynamic separation of documents for continuous job processing is not a feature supported by ADF in prior art.<br><br>
An automatic document feeder (ADF) is generally used in facsimile machines, photocopiers or the like to feed the documents for scanner unit. This enables easier handling of more document pages for scanning in comparison to a flat-bed scanner.<br>
Automatic Documents Feeder supplies paper to be scanned to ADF and feeds papers one by one to the scanning unit.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention is therefore to provide a method for automatic continuous function handling of the documents fed by an automatic document feeder.<br>
This invention relates to the field of MFP in which, a method to automatically perform job (functions - Fax/ ScanToEmail / NetScan) without user intervention is provided. The user can place all the documents for the different jobs to be performed at one time. The user can input information for automatic separation of the documents fed in ADF.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method for automatic continuous function handling of the documents fed into automatic documents feeder comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	scanning a default standard separator sheet and storing the said sheet in the reserved memory space of the MFP where the said sheet details the functionalities available in the MFP;<br>
(b)	providing a space for the user to select the functionality and inputs for the corresponding functionality in the said sheet;<br>
(c)	printing the said sheet through the user interface provided in the MFP and filling in the details by the user after printing the said sheets;<br><br>
(d)	placing the corresponding documents below the said filled sheet and placing the entire set of documents in the ADF where the ADF feeds the sheets one by one to the scanner;<br>
(e)	scanning the first sheet by the scanner and comparing the scanned image with the default standard separator sheet which is stored in the memory;<br>
(f)	extracting the user fed information from the scanned image if the scanned image and the default image matches except for the region of user inputs;<br>
(g)	mapping corresponding values of input extracted from the pre-defined portion of the scanned image to the functionality of the MFP;<br>
(h) initiating the functionality of the MFP according to the said mapping; and (i)  scanning and feeding the sheets as input for the initiated functionality until<br>
the sheet scanned matches with another separator sheet or reaches the<br>
end of document.<br>
In the invention the functionality of the MFP can be Fax, ScanToEmail, or NetScan, etc. The user enters the phone numbers/mail IDs of the receiving MFP along with the number of pages the MFP has to scan to do the said functionality. In the said method the end of job is identified when the count of the scanned pages equals the number of pages input by user. The end of job can also be identified when paper type used for separator differ from the paper type used for the source document. Similarly, end of job is identified when blank page is determined by the scanner. In the invention the standard separator page contains phone number/E-mail id of the receiving MFP for each job.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 clearly illustrate how the automatic continuous Function handling of the documents fed in ADF is achieved.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
This invention relates to the field of MFP in which, a method to automatically perform jobs (functions - Fax / ScanToEmail / NetScan) without user intervention is provided. The user can place all the documents for the different jobs to be performed at one time. The user can input information for automatic separation of the documents fed in ADF.<br>
Figure 5 shows the work flow diagram of one of the embodiments of the present invention. A standard separator sheet is placed in the top of the documents to be scanned and arranged in the ADF. The function parameters such as the phone<br><br>
numbers / email ids and separator details such as the number of pages, paper type or blank page, etc. are obtained by the MFP in the form of user inputs.<br>
Figure 6 is a continuation workflow diagram of the earlier one. After function parameters and separator details are entered the MFP start processing the job. If the said details and limitations are complied with the MFP checks if there are more pages to be worked on with. If no more pages are there then the job is stopped. While checking if MFP finds that there is another separator page then the same procedure is repeated till end of document is notified.<br>
Methods of Operation:<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, a standard separator sheet (Sheet 1 - default sheet) as shown in figure 1 is scanned and stored in the reserved memory space of the MFP. This sheet details the functionalities available in the MFP and also provides a space for the user to select the functionality and inputs for the corresponding functionality. The sheet is printed through the user interface provided in the MFP. After printing the sheet the user fills in the details. Example see sheet 2 where the user has blackened the BOX for selecting the function and also he has entered the email id in the space provided. Then the user places the corresponding documents below the sheet. Then the user places the entire set of documents in the ADF. The ADF starts feeding the sheets one by one to the scanner. The scanner scans the first sheet. After scanning the MFP compares the scanned image with the Sheet 1 which is already in memory. If both the image matches except for the region of user inputs then the MFP extract the user fed information from the scanned image. In the given example sheet 2 the MFP identifies the functionality selected as scan to email from the blackened portion. Also it extracts the email id information. The places from where the information is extracted and the mapping to the functionality are programmed in the MFP i.e. if the BOX in the first line is blackened then it is mapped to Scan to Email Functionality as shown in figure 4, and the corresponding values of input email id are extracted from the pre-defined portion of the scanned image. Having taken all the input values the MFP initiates the Functionality. The sheets that follow are<br><br>
scanned and fed as input for the initiated functionality, until the sheet scanned is found to match the Sheet 1, in which case the end of document for the current job is identified and steps through 9 to 11 are repeated till all sheets in the ADF are over.<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
The user arranges the documents to be sent to different MFP's in order and places in the ADF. The user then enters the phone numbers/mail ids of the receiving MFP followed by number of pages respectively. When the count of the scanned pages equals the number of pages input by user the end of the job is identified. The count of scanned pages is initialized to zero. The end of job (functions - Fax / ScanToEmail / NetScan) is identified from the count. The said process is repeated for the next job without any user intervention.<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
The user arranges the documents to be sent to different MFP's in order and places in the ADF. The user then enters the phone numbers/mail ids of the receiving MFP followed by paper type used for separator different from the source document used respectively. The end of the job (functions - Fax/ ScanToEmail / NetScan) is identified by means of any standard paper type sensor which determines the paper type as specified by user for separator type. The said process is repeated for the next job without any user intervention.<br>
Embodiment 3<br>
The user arranges the documents to be sent to different MFP's in order and places in the ADF. The user places an blank page as separator between documents. The user then enters the phone numbers/E-mail ids of the receiving<br><br>
MFP. The blank page is determined by scanner. The end of the job (functions -Fax/ ScanToEmail / NetScan) is identified by blank page. The said process is repeated for the next job without any user intervention.<br>
Embodiment 4<br>
The user places a standard separator page in between documents. The standard separator page contains phone number / E-mail id of the receiving MFP for each job. The user places arranged documents to be sent to different MFP's in order in the ADF. The standard separator page is scanned by scanner. The information in the separator page (phone number/E-mail id ) is retrieved from scanned data and respective function gets initiated. The end of the job (functions - Fax/ ScanToEmail / NetScan) is identified when the next standard separator page is scanned. The said process is repeated for the next job without any user intervention.<br>
ILLUSTRATION 1:<br>
Selecting and setting for the FAX feature in MFP.<br>
The standard separator sheet is printed through the User Interface provided by the MFP. The printed sheet looks like that shown in figure 1. The BOX for selecting the FAX function is blackened as shown in figure 2. The Input values i.e. the number for which the document should be faxed is entered as shown in figure 3. The documents to be scanned for faxing is kept below the above sheet and all are placed in the ADF. The scan operation is initiated by pressing the Start key. The ADF starts feeding the sheets one by one to the scanner. The scanner scans the sheet. The scanned sheet is stored in the Memory of the MFP. A function (i.e. DCIF) will be newly implemented as a part of the invention (Dynamic Compare and Initiate or Forward) for comparing the scanned images is called. The function (DCIF) compares the scanned data compares the scanned data to that in memory Standard   separator   sheet   by   means   of  any   standard   image   comparison<br><br>
mechanisms, say by overlay. If both the images matches then the function (DCIF) also extracts the input details, i.e. the blackened portion and the values entered (phone number) through OCR. Then the function (DCIF) initiates the functionality (here Fax functionality) as the box corresponding to the functionality (FAX) was blackened and sends the phone number as an input to the initiated functionality. Thus the FAX functionality gets initiated. If both images don't match then the scanned data is considered as the input data and is forwarded by the function (DCIF) to the initiated function. Repeat steps from 8 till there are no documents / Sheets left in ADF.<br>
The following are the advantages of this invention:<br>
1)	User need not wait for individual job completion.<br>
2)	User can pre-configure for more than one job at one time.<br>
3)	User intervention in-between jobs is not needed.<br>
4)	User can configure to send faxes / ScanToEmail / Netscan for multiple MFP's and also choose to have multiplicity of functions available.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a computer, mobile communication device, mobile server or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from.<br><br>
