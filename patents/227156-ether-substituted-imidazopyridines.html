ETHER SUBSTITUTED EVflDAZOPYRIDINES<br>
Field This invention relates to imidazopyridine compounds that have ether or thioether substitution at tbe 1 -portion, and that may contain additional functionality. The invention also provides pharmaceutical corapositiouB containing these compounds and methods of inducing cytokine biosynthesis by administration of the compounds.<br><br><br>
Despite these recent discoveries of compouode that are useful as immune response modifiers, there is a continuing need for compounds that have the ability to modulate the immune response, by induction of cytokine biosynthesis or other mechanisms.<br>
Summary In one aspect, the invention provides imidazwpyridine compounds that have ether substitution at the 1-position. These compounds have the general formula (la):<br><br>
wherein X, V?, and The various R variables are as defined herein, hi other aspects, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds and methods of using the compounds to achieve a therapeutic effect, Such effects include the induction of cytokine biosynthesis, the induction of interferon biosynthesis, treatment of viral conditions and treatment of neoplastic conditions, m other aspects, the invention additionally provides methods of making the compounds and intermediate compounds useful in their syntheait.<br>
Many of the compounds of the invention have an ether linkage at the 1-position of the compounds, The compounds may include additional substitution that occurs after the initial ether linkage, such as aryl, heteroaryl, hetarocyclyi, amido, sulfonamide, urea, and the like. An additional set of compounds provided by the invention contain a thioether linkage at the 1-position; these thioether compounds may also have additional substitution after the initial thioether linkage, including alkyl, aryl heteroaryl, and heterocyclyl-<br><br>
Detailed Description Several classes of ether and thioether substituted imidazopyridine compounds ore disclosed herein. Although each has a different type of substitution at the 1 -position of the compound, many of the substituents at the other positions of the imidazopyridine core can be independently selected from the same group of radicals. Therefore, the following system is used to describe some embodiments of the invention: different classes of compounds are each described by a different general structure of Formula la, such as lb, I-l, 1-2, and so on. Corresponding different Ri substituents for those compounds will be similarly identified as Ri.i, Ru, and so on. The other substituents, which havotlie same definitions for each* class of compounds, will have common designations such as X, Y, Z, Rz, R3, R4, Rs, and so on. If the same variable appears twice in a particular substituent or compound, such as in " - NfRsy, men each instance of the variable can be independently selected from the permitted values for the variable.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

It is understood that one skilled in the art will select the appropriate reaction schemes and steps therein to prepare a compound described in the various aspects and cmbcdimentB of the invention to avoid or minimize undesired or conflicting reactions. For example, when Rj is chloro a reaction scheme which does not involve a tetrazolo intermediate can be selected.

CYTOKINE INDUCTION IN HUMAN CELLS An in vitro human blood cell system is used to assess cytokine induction. Activity is based on the measurement of intorferon-a and tumor necrosis factor-a (IFN-a and TNF-<br><br>
a, respectively) secreted into culture media as described by Testennan et. al. In "Cytokine Induction by the Immunomodulfltore muquiraod and 5-27609", Journal of Leukocyte Biology, 58.355-372 (September, 1995).<br>
Blood Cell Preparation for Culture<br>
Whole blood from healthy human donors is collected by venipuncture into EDTA VKutainer tubes, Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are separated from whole blood by density gradient centrimgition using Hiatopaque4H077, Blood ie diluted 1:1 with Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS) or Hank's Balanced Salts Solution (HBSS). The PBMC layer is collected and washed twice with DPBS or HBSS and retuspended at 4 x 106 cells/mL in RPMI complete. The PBMC suspension is added to 48 well fiat bottom sterile tissue culture plates (Costax, Cambridge, MA or Becton Dickinson Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ) containing an equal volume of RPMI complete media containing test compound.<br>
Compound Preparation<br>
The compounds are Bolubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The DMSO concentration should not exceed a final concentration of 1% for addition to the culture wells. The compounds are generally tested at concentrations ranging from 30-0,014 uM.<br>
Incubation<br>
The solution of test compound is added at 60 uM to the first well containing RPMI complete and serial 3 fold dilutions are made in the wells. The PBMC suspension is then added to the wells in an equal volume, bringing the test compound concentrations to the desired range (30-0.014 uM). The final concentration of PBMC suspension is 2 x 106 cells/mL. The plates are covered with sterile plastic lids, mixed gently and then incubated for 18 to 24 hours at 37°C in a 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere.<br>
Separation<br>
Following incubation the plates are csnirifuged for 10 minutes at 1000 rpm (-200 x g) at 4°C. The cell-free culture supernatant is removed with a sterile polypropylene pipet and transferred to sterile polypropylene tubes, Samples are maintained at -30°C to -70°C<br><br>
until analysis, The wimples are analyzed for IFN-a by ELISA and for TNF-a by ELISA or 1GEN Assay.<br>
IFN-a and TFN-a Analysis by ELISA<br>
IFN-a concentration is determined by ELISA using a Human Multi-Species kit from PBL Biomedical Laboratories, New Brunswick, KT. Results are expressed in pg/mL.<br>
TNF-a concentration is determined using El-ISA Idts available from Biosource International, Camariuo, CA. Alternately, the TNF-ct concentration can be determined by Origen® M-Series Immunoassay and read on an K3EN M-8 analyzer from K3EN International, Gailhereburg, MD. The immunoassay us« a human TNF-a capture and detection antibody pair from Biosource International, CamariUo, CA. Results are expressed in pg/mL.<br>
