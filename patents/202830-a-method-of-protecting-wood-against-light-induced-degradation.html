				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a method of protecting wood against light-induced degradation with a water solution or emulsion of a sterically hindered amine N-oxyl or N-hydroxyl against damage by heat and light and to the use of a sterically hindered amine N-oxyl or N-hydroxyl in water for the stabilization of wood.<br>
Surfaces of wood which are exposed to intense sunlight are damaged primarily by the UV component of sunlight. This process is even enhanced by heat due to the absorbed infrared radiation from the sun. The polymeric constituents of the wood are degraded, leading to a roughening and discoloration of the surface. Subsequently, further damage results from infestation by microorganisms, especially by fungi.<br>
The usual method of protecting wood against damage by light without giving up the visual image of the wood surface is to coat it with a colourless varnish containing a light stabilizer, in particular a UV absorber.<br>
Wood protective coatings which contain a UV absorber, an antioxidant and an insecticide are disclosed for example in JP-A-59/115805.<br>
EP-A-0479075 discloses sterically hindered amine stabilizers for wood stains which are substituted at the nitrogen atom by hydrogen, alkyl, allyl, hydroxymethyl, hydroxyethyl, acyl, benzoyl or benzyl.<br>
EP-A-943665 discloses a wide range of sterically hindered amine N-oxyls or N-hydroxyls which are applied to the wood substrate as solutions comprising at least one organic solvent. Described are also water miscible systems which contain in addition to the organic solvent a certain amount of water and optionally a polymer binder. The document does not mention impregnating solutions which contain exclusively water.<br>
It has now been found that selected sterically hindered amine N-oxyls or N-hydroxyls have an improved stabilizing activity light-induced degradation if they are applied from a pure water stain or impregnation to the wood. A top coat of a conventional binder which may contain further light stabilizers may additionally be applied to the wood substrate.<br>
The present invention provides supeR10r weatherability to wood substrates as compared to pR10r art techniques. In many cases it is for example not necessary to apply an additional<br><br>
coating. If such a coating is applied a very thin or transparent coating is mostly sufficient. This is in many cases desirable for aesthetical reasons.<br>
Wood is a complex polymeric material containing essentially cellulose , hemicellulose and lignin. Lignin itself is a complex mixture of high molecular weight products which are derived from conyferyl alcohol.<br>
Particularly lignin causes discoloration and undergoes degradation upon exposure to actinic radiation. It is therefore also an object of the present invention to prevent the photochemical degradation of the lignin part of wood. In addition, preventing lignin breakdown may remove a source of nutrition for fungi and thus reduce or prevent fungal attack. Therefore reduced amounts or essentially no biccides may be used in some cases.<br>
Accordingly, the invention relates to a method of protecting wood against light-induced degradation by treatraent with an impregnation which penetrates the surface of the wood comprising<br>

In one preferred embodiment of the oresent invention an additional too coat is aoDlied tn tho wood.<br>
Any coating composition suitable for coating wood may be used as additional top coat. It will normally contain a binder, dissolved or dispersed in an organic solvent or in water or a mixture of water and solvent. The binder may typically be a surface coating resin which dries in the air or hardens at room temperature. Exemplary of such binders are nitrocellulose, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl chloride, unsaturated polyester resins, polyacrylates, polyurethanes, epoxy resins, phenolic resins, and especially alkyd resins. The binder may also be a mixture of different surface coating resins. Provided the binders are curable binders, they are normally used together with the hardener and/or accelerator.<br>
Typical examples of organic solvents which may suitably be used for the coating compositions are aliphatic, aromatic or cycioaliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, esters, ketones or chlorinated hydrocarbons.<br>
Water/solvent mixtures are typically mixtures of water and lower alcohols, glycols or glycol ethers.<br>
The top coat may also be a radiation-curable, solvent-free formulation of photopolymerisable compounds. Illustrative examples are mixtures of acrylates or methacrylates, unsaturated polyester/styrene mixtures or mixtures of other ethylenically unsaturated monomers or oligomers.<br>
The top coat may contain a soluble dye and/or a pigment and/or a filler. The pigment may be an organic, inorganic or metallic pigment. The pigments may be opaque or transparent such as for example transparent iron oxides. The filler may be typically kaolin, calcium carbonate or aluminium silicate. Preferably the top coat is a clear varnish, i.e. it contains no undissolved components.<br>
Although the stain or impregnation contains the sterically hindered amine of formula (I) and affords good protection against light, it may be advantageous to add the sterically hindered amine of fomiula (I) and/or other conventional light stabilizers to the top coat. Illustrative examples of suitable conventional light stabilizers are the following compounds:<br><br>

A further subject of the present invention is the use of a hindered amine compound of formulas A to R and A* to R* for preventing wood from light induced degradation. Examples and preferences for the substituents have been already mentioned and apply also for the above subject of the invention.<br>
The present invention is particularly useful for the following applications: in house applications, such as furniture, parquet floors, chipboards or timber work; outdoor applications such as fences, construction parts, wooden fronts, window frames and the like.<br>
Other areas are: Waterborne sap stain protectants for the temporary protection of freshly sawn wood parts, waterborne tinting baths for wood veneers, waterborne wood presen/ative formulations, waterborne formulations for the pressure treatment of wood construction parts and waterborne sealers.<br>
In cases where maximum stabilization is required a complete wood protection system may be applied. The wood protection system comprises an impregnation according to the present invention, optionally an intermediate layer and a final top coat, which may be stabilized as described before.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention.<br>
Example 1:<br>
2 % of the compounds given in Table 1 are dissolved in water (comparative example in ethanol). The respective solution is brushed on a panel of Ayous Obeche wood. The sample is dried for 2 hours at room temperature.<br>
The samples are exposed for three days under six TL 40W/03 fluorescent lamps (Philips) at a distance of 20 cm.<br>
The yellowness index (Yl) is measured against a white standard according to ASTM D 1925. The yellowness index of the untreated wood is given in the first row of the table.<br><br><br><br>
Example 2: Inhibition of yellowing of fir panels with an aqueous N-Oxid-HALS primer and an alkyd top coat<br>
0,5 % of the compounds given in Table 2 are dissolved in water. The solution is brushed as a primer on fir panels. The samples are dried for 2 hours at room temperature and coated afterwards with an alkyd lacquer containing 1,5 % Tinuvin 384 and 1,5 % Tinuvin 292. Formulation of top coat:<br>
53,48 parts of an Alkyd Resin (Jagalyd Antihydro®, E. Jager KG, 60% solution in white<br>
spirit)<br>
10,69 parts of a thixotropic agent (Jagalyd Antihydro-Thix®, E. Jager KG, 50% solution)    <br>
1,92 parts of an accelerator (Jager Antihydro-Trockner®)<br>
33.44 parts of a solvent (Terlitol® 30)<br>
0,32 parts of an antiskinning agent (Ascinin® P, BAYER)<br>
0,15 parts of an antiskinning agent (Luactin® M, BASF)<br>
Comparison 1 is a sample without primer and without stabilizers in the top coat. A sample with top coat and without primer is used as comparison 2.<br>
The color change A E (DIN 6174) in comparison to an unexposed sample is measured after 800 hours weathering. The results are given in Table 2.<br><br><br>
Tinuvin® 384 is a commercial benzotriazol UV-absorber of Ciba Specialty Chemicals Inc. Tinuvin® 292 is a commercial sterically hindered amine of Ciba Specialty Chemicals Inc.<br><br><br><br><br>
