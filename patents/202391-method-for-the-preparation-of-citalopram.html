				<td>The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of key intermediates in the process for the preparation of the well known antidepressant drug citalopram, 1-3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Citalopram is a well known antidepressant drug that has now been on the market for<br><br>
reuptake inhibitor, accordingly having antidepressant activities. The antidepressant activity of the compound has been reported in several publications, eg. J. Hyttei, Prog Neuro-PsychoPharmacol. &amp; Biol. Psychiat., 1982, 6, 277-295 and A. Gravem, Acta Psychiatr. Scand,, 1987, 75, 478-486. The compound has further been disclosed to show effects in the treatment of dementia and cerebrovascular disorders, EP-A 474580.<br>
Citalopram can be prepared by several disclosed methods. A method and an intermediate for the preparation of citalopram were described in U.S. Patent No. 4,650,884. Commercially useful processes are disclosed in International patent application Nos. WO 98019511, WO 98019512 and WO 98019513.<br>
With respect to the above methods for the preparation of citalopram, the process comprising exchange of the 5-bromo group with cyano proved not to be very convenient in commercial scale, since the yield was rather low, the product was impure and, in particular, since it was difficult to separate the resulting citalopram from the corresponding 5-bromo compound.<br><br>
It has now been found that in a new process for the preparation of citalopram, this key intermediate may be obtained in a high yield as a very pure product by a new catalytic process in which a halogen or a group of the general formula CF3-(CF2)n-SO2- wherein n is any suitable whole number between 0 and 7, situated in the 5-position of a 3-H-isobenzofuran-l-one, is exchanged with a cyanide group. By obtaining the correct cyanide substitution at an early stage of the citalopram synthesis, the extensive work up of the old cyanide exchange processes of the previous described processes is avoided. The intermediates of the presently described process are easily purified and obtained in very high yields. The key intermediate is then subjected to two successive Grignard reactions, i.e. with 4-tluorophenyl magnesium halogenide and N.N-dimethylaminopropyl magnesium halogenide, respectively, whereby citalopram is obtained.<br>
The preparation of the key intermediate of the invention is described earlier in J.Chem. Soc, 1931, 867 and by Tiroflet, J. in Bull. Soc. Sci. Betagne, 26, 35, 1951. The process for preparation of the compound is a three step synthesis starting from 5-nitro-phtalimide with low yields, especially in the last step of the synthesis.<br><br><br>
wherein R" is C1, Br, 1 or a group of the formula CF3-(CF2)n-S02-, wherein n is 0-7, with a cyanide source in the presence or absence of a catalyst, whereby 5-cyano-isobenzofuran-1-one is obtained. This intermediate product can be further reacted to citalopram as described above.<br>
The reaction of IV till 5-cyanophtalide may be carried out in more convenient solvents, at a low temperature and at a minimal excess of CN". The process has environmental  advantages  in that  it only uses small amounts of heavy  metals.<br>
The cyano sources may conveniently be selected from a group consisting of cyanide sources such as (R"4)CN wherein each R" represents C1-8-alkyl optionally two R" together with the nitrogen form a ring structure; NaCN, KCN, Zn(CN)2 or Cu(CN).<br>
The reaction of the present invention is performed in the presence or absence of a catalyst. The catalysts are i.e. Ni (0), Pd{0} or Pd(Il) catalysts as described by Sakakibara et. al. in Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 61, 1985-1990, (1988). Preferred catalysts are NiCPPhj)3 or Pd(PPh3)4, Pd(dba)3. or Pd(PPh)2Cl2.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, a Nickel(O) complex is prepared in situ before the cyanide exchange reaction by reduction of a Nickel(II) precursor such as NiC12 or NiBr2 by a metal, such as zinc, magnesium or mangan in the presence of excess of complex ligands, preferably triphenylphosphin.<br>
The Pd or Ni-catalyst is conveniently used in an amount of 0.5-(0, preferably 2-6, most preferably about 4-5 mol %.<br>
Cu" and Zn  may be added to the reaction mixture in substoichiometric amounts and may function as recycleable cyanide sources, which receives the cyanide from other cyanide sources such as NaCN or KCN. Substoichiometric amounts of Cu+ and Zn2+, respectively, means 1-20%, preferably 5-10%.<br><br>
The reactions may be performed in any convenient solvent as described in Sakakibara et. al. in Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 61, 1985-1990, (1988). Preferred solvents are acetonitrile, elhylacetate, THF, DMF or NMP;<br>
In one aspect of the invention, a compound of Formula IV wherein R is C1 is reacted with NaCN in the presence of a Ni(PPh3)3 which is preferably prepared in situ as described above.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, a compound of formula IV, wherein R is Br or 1, is reacted with KCN, NaCN, CuCN or Zn(CN)2 in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4. In a particular aspect of the invention, substoichiometric amounts of Cu(CN) and Zn(CN)2 are added as recycleable cyanide sources.<br>
In another aspect of same invention, the Cu(CN) is the cyanide source and without catalyst. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the reaction is performed at elevated temperature.<br>
In a particular aspect of this invention, the reaction is performed as a neat reaction i.e. without added solvent.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the reaction is performed in an ionic liquid of the general formula R4N+, X , wherein R are alkyl-groups or two of the R groups together form an ring and X" is the counterion. In one embodiment of the invention, R4N+X" represents<br><br><br>
In another particular aspect of this invention, the reaction is conducted with apolar solvents such as benzene, xylene or mesitylene and under the influence of microwaves by using i,e, Synthewave 1000TM by Prolabo. In a particular aspect of this invention, the reaction is performed without added solvent.<br>
The temperature ranges are dependent upon the reaction type. If no catalyst is present preferred temperatures are in the range of W0-200°C. However, when the reaction is conducted under the influence of microwaves the temperature in the reaction mixture may raise to above SOCC. More preferred temperature ranges are between 120-170oC. The most preferred range is 130-150°C.<br>
If catalyst is present the preferred temperature range is between 0 and 100oC. More preferred are temperature ranges of 40-90°C. Most preferred temperature ranges are between 60-90oC.<br>
Other reaction conditions, solvents, etc. are conventional conditions for such reactions and may easily be determined by a person skilled in the art.<br><br>
