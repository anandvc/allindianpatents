It could be segregated into three segments; the base plate, the main body and the stainless steel drum placed one above the other in that order. The base plate houses the prime mover, the main body houses the transmission system consisting of helical gears and belt drives, whereas the drum houses the bottom stone and the roller assembly. Roller stones are placed above the bottom stone in such a manner that the height of the roller axis remains the same at the any point, whereas Lie axes of the drum, bottom stone and the drive gear are on the same line. The alignment of the motor and the main drive shaft through a series of drives always remain perpendicular. The bottom stone is thickest at the center and tapers to least thickness at the periphery</td>

This Invention relates to a Wet Grinder. Conventional Grinders hitherto known, basically consisted of a Base Stone, upon which one or more roller stones of either cylindrical or conical cross-section would press against and were held together by gravity, spring force or any other suitable means. The relative motion between the base stone and the roller stones consequence m rubbing and rolling action between the contacting surface and thus the grinding of the food particles took place. The main disadvantage in this system was that the constant friction generated between contact surface lead to more wear and tear on the stone surfaces. Further, since rubbing action was dominant in this process, it would create a lot of heat thereby deteriorating the quality of the ground food substance.<br>
In the conventional wet grinders, the base stone and the roller stone/stones would be on one side and the motor adjacently placed and the base stone and the metallic cylinder deriving its rotary motion through a pulley-belt drive. In this "IMPROVISED WET GRINDER", a new concept has been developed in the wet grinder technology in respect of the drive system and the assembly, incorporating the access to high technology we have these days, which has resulted in a technically advanced, compact and a more efficient 'Wet Grinder', which is versatile in nature, easy to carry thereby making it portable also. All this has been achieved without compromising on the grinding capacity and quality.<br>
In the conventional Wet Grinder Models, the bottom stone which is housed in a metallic cylindrical drum, preferably stainless steel is rotated through a motor drive, wherein in the driver and the driven articles are<br><br>
Placed adjacently. The transmission of the driving force is by a belt in case of a conventional Wet Grinder, tilting and tabletop Wet Grinder and is through a belt and Gearbox assembly in the others.<br>
In this Invention "IMPROVISED WET GRINDER", the driver i.e., the Motor (29), as shown in Fig: A on Sheet No: 1, is kept beneath the base-stone-drum assembly (21 &amp; 27), as shown in Fig: A on Sheet No: 1 and the motor is designed in such a way that the required wet grinding speed is attained by the belt and the gears by selecting a suitable gear ratio proportion. The axis of the main shaft (17), as shown in Fig: B on Sheet No: 2 and the motor (29), as shown in Fig: B on Sheet No: 2, are perpendicular here.<br>
The base stone along with the drum assembly is detachable, which is kept above the gear and made to revolve in the same axis as that of the gear. The Drum (27) along with Bottom Stone (21) and Drive Gear (6) as shown in Fig: A on Sheet No: 1, is rotating around a detachable shaft which is fixed on the top of the motor in such away that all of them lie on the same axis.<br>
In this "IMPROVISED WET GRINDER", the bottom stone is designed in such a way that the taper is from the center of the stone towards the periphery. To elaborate on this point, the thickness of the stone is more at the center, which goes on decreasing proportionately as we come to the periphery. Thus minimum thickness of the base stone is at the peripheral level. This profile of the base stone has resulted in availability of more area for the grinding purpose.<br><br>
Another advantage of this profile of the base stone is that the ground particles automatically move towards the periphery of the stone, owing to gravitational and centrifugal forces, which facilitates easy collection and removal of the ground paste. More the surface area and faster the paste movement makes the grinding fast. Two more rollers (22) are kept above the bottom stone (21), as shown in Fig: 6 on Sheet No: 2, in such a way that the height of the roller axis remains the same at any point on moving from the center of the bottom stone. The roller assembly is detachable in nature, consisting of a Roller Stud (18), Roller Bush (19) and Spring (20) assembly, as shown in Fig: A on Sheet No: 1, which determine the position of the rollers (22) on the base stone (21). A spring cover (10) covers the spring (20), which is an integral part of the Drum Lid (4) and a closer knob (13), as shown in Fig: A on Sheet No: 1, acts as a holder for the Drum Lid (4).<br>
This IMPROVISED WET GRINDER' could be basically segregated into three units i.e., the Base Plate (1), the Main Body (2) and the Stainless Steel Drum (27), as shown in Fig: A on Sheet No: 1.<br>
The Base Plate (1) houses the Motor(29) and the Main Body (2) is meant for the transmission assembly consisting of the Gears. The Steel Drum (27) houses the roller assembly and the bottom plate (21), where the grinding action takes place.<br>
Motor (29) is mounted on the Base Plate (1) with special End Covers (3) on both ends, vertically positioned beneath the Bottom Plate.<br><br>
The Drive from the Motor Pulley (25)to the V-Pulley (7) is connected to the stud (15), as shown in Fig: D on Sheet No: 4, in which lot helical Gear (6) is an integral part. The Stud (15) is fixed to the motor end cover (3). The 10 T helical gear (6) drives the 20 T helical gears (5). Helical gear (5) is fixed and rotates around a stud (15) and is detachable. Base Stone (21) along with the stainless steel drum (27) around the main shaft (17) driven by helical gear (5) supported by a stone bush (8) and washer (9). The base stone is designed in such a way that it could be detached from the gear. The Bottom Stone (21) actuates the roller stones (22) which is fixed in the collar (16) with the roller guide bush (11) and collar lock (12). The movement of the paste is guided by stopper plate (24). Switch assembly (14), Closer Knob (13), Cooling Fan (30), Leg Bush (23), as shown in Fig. A, form other parts of the IMPROVISED WET GRINDER<br>
The resulting IMPROVISED WET GRINDER is technically very much advanced gut at the same time is very simple in operational aspects, compact and totally detachable, thereby facilitating easy packing and carrying.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
