Compounds of formula (I), as intermediates for the preparation of other compounds, may be conveniently functionalised, as disclosed in WO2005/080382. An example is reported in the present Experimental Section.<br>
The preparation of compounds of formula (I) described in WO2005/080382 employed 1-<br>
hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) together with 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC).<br>
The disadvantages of this reagents at an industrial level may be summarised as follows:<br>
HOBt and its by-products have an explosive nature and DCC and its by-product are<br>
always difficult to fully remove.<br>
The process solves the above problems by using n-propane phosphonic cyclic anhydride,<br>
T3P, as condensation agent.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
The T3P was first used in the petide synthesis in 1980 by H. Wlssmann (Angew. Chem., 1980, 92, 129) and is steadily gaining importance in organic synthesis because is less toxic and safer compared to other common condensation agents, such as DCC. The reagent does not afford any water insoluble by-product. T3P is used as 50% solution in ethyl acetate in the process of the present invention and does not need the isolation of the intermediate hydrazine-carbothiamide. Similarly, T3P is available as 50% solution in DMF (dimethylformamide) and may be employed in the process of the present invention.<br>
The process of the present invention can be depicted in more details as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
The starting material, the heterocyclic carboxylic acid, generally commercially available or which may be prepared according to known methods in the literature, in an amount of 1 equivalent may be conveniently dissolved in the appropriate solvent (for example dimethylformamdide; ethyl acetate; acetonitrile and tetrahydrofurane and other polar aprotic solvent) and treated with a slightly excess of derivatives of 3-thiosemicarbazide (1.10eq)., such as 4-methyl derivative. Then an organic base (e.g. triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine and possibly other aliphatic of aromatic amines) is added at RT.<br>
N-propane phosphonic cyclic anhydride (50% w/w in ethyl acetate) may be then added at a temperature ranging from from 0 to 40 degrees dropwise. In case the addition is made at about 0°C, the temperature is then maintained below 15°C over 20-60 minutes. The resulting mixture was then stirred at 20°C for 2-16 hours.<br>
The mixture is then diluted with an aqueous solution of an appropriate inorganic base until basic pH was reached. The suitable base may be selected among: potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide.<br>
The resulting bi-phasic mixture (when observed) is then allowed separating and the upper organic layer discarded. The aqueous layer is then heated to 50-90°C (internal temperature) for half an hour to several hours until reaction completion.<br>
After cooling down to 20°C, an appropriate mineral acid, (e.g HCI 37%) is then slowly added to adjust the pH as needed. (4 to 8).<br>
The suspension is then generally stirred for 2-16 hours, then the solid was filtered, washed with pure water and dried in a vacuum oven at 40-60°C until dryness. The final product is isolated from the aqueous mixture uncontaminated by phosphorous derivatives.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
In the Examples unless otherwise stated:<br>
All temperatures refers to °C. Infrared spectra were measured on a FT-IR instrument. Compounds were analysed by direct infusion of the sample dissolved in acetonitrile into a mass spectra operated in positive electro spray (ES+) ionisation mode. Proton Magnetic Resonance (1H-NMR) spectra were recorded at 400 MHz, chemical shifts are reported in ppm downfield (d) from Me4Si, used as internal standard, and are assigned as singlets (s), broad singlets (bs), doublets (d), doublets of doublets (dd), triplets (t), quartets (q) or multiplets (m). Column chromathography was carried out over silica gel (Merck AG Darmstaadt, Germany). The following abbreviations are used in the text: T3P = N-propane Phosphonic Cyclic Anhydride, EtOAc = ethyl acetate, DIPEA = N,N-diisopropylethylamine.<br>
