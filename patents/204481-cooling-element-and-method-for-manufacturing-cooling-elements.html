COOUNO ELEMENT AND METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING COOLING ELEMENTS<br><br><br><br><br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES<br>
THE NATURE OF THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER WHICH IT IS<br>
TO BE PERFORMED<br><br><br><br><br>
COOLING ELEMENT AND METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING COOLING ELEMENTS<br>
The present invention relates to a cooling element according to the preamble of 5  the patent claim 1. The invention also relates to a method for manufacturing cooling elements.<br>
In connection with industrial furnaces, such as flash smelting furnaces, blast furnaces and electric furnaces, there are used massive cooling elements that<br>
10 are typically made of copper. They are used in extreme working conditions, where copper is subjected to intensive corrosion strains caused by the furnace atmosphere and even by contacts with the molten material. For example, in an SO2 atmosphere, copper corrosion is caused, among others, by oxidizing and sulphatizing reactions, which in the worst case can result in material losses of<br>
15  even tens of millimeters on the corroded surfaces.<br>
The object of the invention is to realize a cooling element whereby the problems known in the prior art can be avoided. Thus the object of the invention also is to achieve a cooling element that has a longer working life than the ones known in 20 the prior art. Another object of the invention is to realize a method for manufacturing a cooling element that is more resistant than the ones known in the prior art.<br>
The invention is based on an idea according to which on the surface of a 25 cooled element consisting mainly of copper there is attached, by means of a diffusion joint, a steel surface that has a better corrosion resistance.<br>
The invention is characterized by what is specified in the appended claims.<br>
30 The invention has several remarkable advantages. The method of applying a surface layer by means of a diffusion joint enables an excellent heat transfer over the junction. The suggested joining method allows the surface layer to be<br><br>
joined to the cooling element housing at temperatures that are even hundreds of degrees lower than the melting point of copper., The cooling element according to the invention has a remarkably better corrosion resistance than the cooling elements of the prior art. Consequently their working life before 5  replacement is remarkably longer than in the prior art.<br>
In this application, the term copper relers to, apart from objects made of copper, also to alloy materials with a copper content that essentially includes at least 50% copper. The term stainless steel in this application refers mainly to 10 austenitic alloy steels, such as stainless and acid-proof steels.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail with reference to the appended drawings, where<br>
15  Figure 1  illustrates a cooling element according to the invention in cross-section,<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the junction according to the method of the invention in a simplified cross-section prior to heating, 20<br>
Figure 3 illustrates another junction according to the method of the invention in a simplified cross-section prior to heating, and<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a third junction according to the method of the invention in a. â€” 25 simplified cross-section prior to heating.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates in cross-section a cooling element used particularly in furnaces. The element comprises a housing 1 mainly made of copper or copper alloy and provided with a cooling channel system 6 for cooling medium 30 circulation. According to the invention, at least in a part of the surface of the cooling element housing 1, there is arranged, by means of a diffusion joint, a corrosion-resistant surface layer 2. Said surface layer 2 is made of steel,<br><br>
particularly refined steef. Typically the steef is for example acid-proof steel. The surface layer 2 is applied only on a part of the surface of the element housing 1. The cooling element illustrated in figure 1 is a cooling element of a flash smelting furnace. Naturally the cooling element may belong to another type of 5 furnace, particularly a furnace that is used in the manufacturing or refining of metals. The shape and size of the cooling element is dependent on the particular target of usage in each case. A preferred embodiment according to the invention is that the element is a cooled element, a so-called chute element, particularly used in conducting melt. In that case the surface layer can be 10 arranged for instance in that part of the surface where it gets into contact with the melt.<br>
According to the method of the invention, the surface layer 2 is attached, by means of a diffusion joint, to the element housing 1. In between the junction 15 surfaces of the surface layer 2 and the housing 1, there is provided at least one intermediate layer 3, 4, 5 prior to forming the joint. The employed surface layer 2 is steel, particularly refined steel.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates an embodiment of the joining method according to the<br>
20  invention in cross-section prior to the thermal treatment. A housing 1 essentially<br>
consisting mainly of copper, and a surface layer 2 consisting of refined steel, for<br>
example austenitic stainless steel, are thereby joined together. In the junction<br>
between the two objects, there are arranged intermediate layers 3, 4. The first<br>
intermediate layer 3 placed against the surface layeF2, "which iayer is mainly<br>
25  designed for preventing the nickel loss from steel, typically includes mainly<br>
nickel (Ni). In addition, when creating the joint, there is advantageously used at<br>
least a second intermediate layer 4, i.e. a so-called activator layer, which in the<br>
case of the example is for instance tin (Sn). Tin functions as the activator and<br>
results in a lowering of the temperature, which is required in the creation of the<br>
30 joint.<br><br>
The first intermediate layer 3 can be formed on the surface layer surface by means of a separate treatment. When nickel is used as the first intermediate layer 3, said layer can be created on the surface layer surface for example by means of electrolysis. Nickel-plating is typically carried out so that the 5 passivation layer provided on the stainless steel surface does not present an obstacle to the material transfer on the junction surface between stainless steel and nickel. The first intermediate layer 3 can also exist in the form of foil.<br>
In the method according to the invention, in between the junction surfaces of<br>
10 the surface layer 2 and the cooling element housing 1, to be joined together,<br>
there is provided a first intermediate layer 3 on the junction surface of the<br>
surface layer 2 or against said surface, and a second intermediate layer 4 on<br>
the junction surface of the housing 1 or against said surface, so that the<br>
junction surfaces including their intermediate layers 3, 4 are pressed together,<br>
15  and in said method, at least the junction area is heated. The first intermediate<br>
layer 3 may include mainly nickel (Ni) or chromium (Cr), or an alloy or mixture<br>
thereof. The second intermediate layer 4 consists of an activator with a melting<br>
temperature that is lower than that of the objects that should be joined together.<br>
The second intermediate layer 4 includes mainly silver (Ag) and/or tin (Sn), or,<br>
20  as an alloy or mixture, silver and copper (Ag+Cu), aluminum and copper<br>
(Al+Cu) or tin and copper (Sn+Cu).<br>
When heating the junction area, there is created a diffusion joint on the surfaces-of the objects to be joined together; this takes place as a result of the<br>
25 nickel diffusion on one hand, and as a result of the diffusion of the copper and steel components on the other. The forming of the diffusion joint, and the structures created therein, are activated by means of an extremely thin second intermediate layer 4, i.e. the soldering agent layer, required by the applied manufacturing conditions and the desired joint, or by means of a mixture of<br>
30 several intermediate layers 4, 5 placed on the junction surface between the nickel-plated surface layer 2 and the housing 1.<br><br>
The employed soldering agents and diffusion activators of the intermediate layers 4, 5 can be silver-copper alloys and tin in pure form or in specific sandwich structures. Mechanically strong joints are obtained within the temperature range of 600 - 850Â° C. The selection of thermal treatment periods<br>
5 can be carried out so that the creation of brittle intermetallic phases in the final joint are avoided. The soldering agent thicknesses, as well as the thermal treatment temperature and duration of the intermediate layers, are chosen so that the nickel loss from steel is prevented as a result of the alloy with a high nickel content provided on the surface thereof. An advantage of a low joining<br>
10 temperature is that the thermal stresses created in the junction area are minimal.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention. There at least a second intermediate layer 4 and at least a third<br>
15 intermediate layer 5 is provided, and the melting temperature of the second intermediate layer 4 is lower than that of the third intermediate layer 5. The third intermediate layer 4 consists mainly of silver (Ag) or of both silver (Ag) and copper (Cu), either as an alloy or in a mixture. In a preferred embodiment, the third intermediate layer consists of an Ag+Cu soldering agent, advantageously<br>
20 in the form of foil. According to a preferred embodiment, the second intermediate layer includes, in percentages by weight, Ag 71% and Cu 29%. Advantageously the soldering agent has, with a given alloy composition, a eutectic composition with copper. The junction area is heated in one step. According to a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention,<br>
25 the second intermediate layer 4 is brought onto the surface of the third intermediate layer 5. Typically, but not necessarily, at least one of the intermediate layers 3, 4, 5 is brought to the junction area in the form of foil. The employed soldering agents and diffusion activators of the intermediate layers 4, 5 can be silver-copper alloys and tin, either in a pure form or as specific<br>
30 sandwich structures. Mechanically strong joints are obtained within the temperature range of 600 - 850Â° C. The selection of thermal treatment periods can be carried out so that the creation of brittle intermetallic phases in the final<br><br>
joint are avoided. The soldering agent thicknesses, as well as the thermal treatment temperature and duration are chosen so that the nickel loss from steel is prevented as a result of the alloy with a high nickel content provided on the surface thereof. An advantage of a low joining temperature is that the 5  thermal stresses created in the junction area are minimal.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates yet another embodiment of the method according to the invention prior to heating the surface layer and the housing joint. There a second intermediate layer 4 is provided on both surfaces of the third 10 intermediate layer 5, or against said surfaces. In this embodiment, there can typically be used a sandwich foil, where one or both surfaces of the foil are treated for instance with tin.<br>
The thicknesses of the intermediate layers used in the method vary. The<br>
15  thickness of the Ni layer employed as the first intermediate layer 3 is typically<br>
2 - 50 urn. After electrolysis, it is typically 2-10 |im, as a foil of the order 20 - 50<br>
urn The thickness of the Ag or Ag+Cu foil employed as the third intermediate<br>
layer 5 is typically 10 - 500 urn, preferably 20-100 urn. The thickness of the<br>
second intermediate layer 4 is typically dependent on the thickness of the third<br>
20  intermediate layer 5, and is for instance 10 - 50% of the thickness of the third<br>
intermediate  layer.  Extremely high-quality joints have  been  achieved by<br>
applying for instance a 5 -10 urn tin layer on the surfaces of a 50 u,m thick<br>
Ag+Cu soldering agent foil. The tin layers can be formed for example by<br>
immersing the soldering agent in the form of foil in molten tin, and when<br>
25  necessary, by thereafter rolling the foil to be smooth.<br>
The selected material for the surface layer can be the most suitable type of steel.<br>
30<br><br>
I<br>
EXAMPLE I<br>
Acid-proof steel (AISI 316) and copper (Cu) were joined together. On the steel junction surface, there was provided, as a first intermediate layer, a nickel (Ni) layer with the thickness of 7 |im. As a diffusion activator and soldering agent,<br>
5 there was used an Ag+Cu soldering agent having a eutectic composition, including in percentages by weight 71% Ag and 29% Cu. The soldering agent was in the form of foil with the thickness of 50 urn, and on the foil surface there was also formed a tin (Sn) layer with a thickness of the order 5-10 urn. The objects to be joined together were placed against each other, so that the foil<br>
10 was left in between the junction surfaces. The objects were pressed together, and the junction area was heated above the melting temperature of the soldering agent, up to a temperature of about 800Â° C. The holding time was about 10 minutes. The junction according to the example succeeded excellently. The obtained result was a metallurgical^ compact joint.<br><br>
