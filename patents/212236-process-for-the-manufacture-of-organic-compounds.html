In one embodiment of the invention, the calcium salt is pitavastatin calcium.<br>
The processes described herein above are conducted under inert atmosphere, preferably under nitrogen atmosphere. It is within the scope of the invention to use a molecular sieve during the preparation of the compounds of the invention, especially in the step of condensing a disilyloxydiene with an aldehyde of Formula (Q1), (Q2), or (Q3), in the presence of a titanium (IV) catalyst. Water may optionally be added to the molecular sieve prior to using the molecular sieve. In one embodiment, the water content of the molecular sieve is preferably from about 1 wt % to about 15 wt %, more preferably from about 2.6 wt % to about about 10 wt %, based on the total weight of the titanium (IV) catalyst.<br>
The type of reactor used to prepare the compounds of the invention include batch, continuous, and semicontinuous reactors. It is within the scope of the invention to prepare the compounds in an external recycle reactor which allows: (i) in-situ pre-treatment or post-treatment of the solid mol sieves (ii) elimination of mole sieves filtration at the end of the reaction and (iii) easy re-use of the mol sieves for possible multicycle operation.<br>
In starting compounds and intermediates, which are converted to the compounds of the invention in a manner described herein, functional groups present, such as amino, thiol, carboxyl and hydroxy groups, are optionally protected by conventional protecting groups that are common in preparative organic chemistry. Protected amino, thiol, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups are those that can be converted under mild conditions into free amino thiol, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups without the molecular framework being destroyed or other undesired side reactions taking place.<br>
The purpose of introducing protecting groups is to protect the functional groups from undesired reactions with reaction components under the conditions used for carrylng out a desired chemical transformation. The need and choice of protecting groups for a particular<br><br>
reaction is known to those skilled in the art and depends on the nature of the functional group to be protected (hydroxyl group, amino group, etc.), the structure and stability of the molecule of which the substituent is a part and the reaction conditions. Well-known protecting groups that meet these conditions and their introduction and removal are described, e.g., in McOmie, -Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry-, Plenum Press, London, NY (1973); and Greene, -Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis-, Wiley, NY (1991).<br>
The compounds of the invention may be prepared in high enantiomeric purity, and therefor, eliminate the need for resolution. As used herein, high enantiomeric purity or enantioselectivity means at least 70% optical purity, preferably at least 80% optical purity, most preferably at least 97% optical purity.<br>
The compounds of the invention are especially useful for treating or preventing atherosclerosis. In one embodiment of the invention, the compounds inhibit the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase which has been identified as a rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway.<br>
The following examples are intended to illustrate the invention and are not to be construed as being limitations thereon. Temperatures are given in degrees Centrigrade. If not mentioned otherwise, all evaporations are performed under reduced pressure, preferably between about 15 and 100 mmHg (= 20-133 mbar). The structure of final products, intermediates and starting materials is confirmed by standard analytical methods, e.g., microanalysis, melting point (mp) and spectroscopic characteristics, e.g., MS, IR and NMR. Abbreviations used are those conventional in the art.<br><br><br>
temperature. 200 mL of hexane is then added and the mixture stirred in an ice bath for 1 hour. The mixture is filtered and the solids are washed with 50 mL of cold hexane. Evaporation of the combined filtrate and washings gives 46 g of 3-trimethylsilanyloxy-but-2-enoic acid ethyl ester as a colorless, slightly cloudy oil. This material is used without further purification in the following step.<br><br>
Under nitrogen atmosphere, 600 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and 38 mL of diisopropylamine (0.271 mole) is cooled to -5°C. 121 mL of 2.5 M n-butyllithium (in hexane) is added while keeping the internal temperature at -3 ± 3°C. The mixture is then cooled to -78°C with a dry ice acetone bath, 45.2 g (0.22 mole) of the compound of Example 1, 3-trimethylsilanyloxy-but-2-enoic acid ethyl ester is added, keeping the internal temperature below '70°C. After stirring 25 minutes, 44 mL of trimethylsilyl chloride (0.347 mole) is added while keeping the internal temperature below -70°C. The mixture is then allowed to warm up to room temperature. After evaporation of solvents, the residue is stirred in 250 mL of hexane, cooled with an ice bath and stirred for 1 hour, followed by filtration to remove solids. The filtrate is evaporated to obtain 64.7 g of 1-ethoxy-1,3-bis-trimethyl-silanyloxy-buta-1,3-diene as a yellow oil, which is used without further purification in the following step. The material is protected from moisture and stored in a freezer ('35°C).<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of (E)-(5S)-7-[2-cyclopropyl-4-(4-fiuoro-phenyl)-quinolin'3-yl]-5-hydroxy-3-oxo-hept-6-enoic acid ethyl ester.<br><br><br>
Method 1:<br>
To a dry 500 mL flask under nitrogen atmosphere are charged 25.4 g of (E)-3-t2-cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-quinolin-3'yl]-propenal, prepared according to a process described in -Synthesis and Biological Evaluations of Quinoiine-based HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors-, Bioorganic Med Chem., Vol. 9, pp. 2727-2743 (2001), 0.080 mole, 0.91 g (S)-BINOL (4 mole%) and 5 g of molecular sieves (4A activated powder). 200 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added and the mixture is stirred for 40 minutes 0.95 mL (4 mole%) of titanium (IV) isopropoxide is then added dropwise. The mixture becomes dark red immediately. After stirring 30 minutes at room temperature, 39.2 g (about 44 mL, 0.143 mole) of the compound of Example 2, 1-ethoxy-1,3-bis-trimethylsilanyloxy-buta-1,3-diene is added dropwise over 10 minutes. The flask is kept in a 18°C water bath to maintain an internal temperature below 25°C. The mixture is stirred at room temperature and the disappearance of (E)-3-[2-cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-quinolin-3-yl]'propenal is monitored by TLC (33% ethyl acetate/hexane, R1 aldehyde = 0.65). Reaction time varies from 1 hour to 72 hours depending on the amount of catalyst used. After the reaction is complete, 50 mL of water is added and the mixture is cooled with an ice bath, then 10 mL of 1:1 (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid/water is added. The mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature over about 30 minutes. At this time desilyation is complete as judged by TLC (disappearance of silyloxy aldol adduct R1 = 0.75, appearance of desilylated product R, = 0.22). The mixture is added to a rapidly stirred flask containing 400 mL of ethyl acetate and 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate. After stirring 5 minutes, the mixture is filtered to remove molecular sieves. The organic layer is separated and washed with brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. After solvent removal by evaporation, about 150 mL of hexane is added to the resulting oil over 45 minutes to induce precipitation. The mixture is stirred in an ice bath for additional 45 minutes. The precipitated solids are collected by vacuum filtration, washed with cold hexane and dried overnight under vacuum at 35°C to form 33.8 g (94%) of (E)-(5S)-7-[2-cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluoro-phenyl)'quinolin-3-yl]-5-hydroxy-3-oxo-hept-6-enoic acid ethyl ester in 97.4% optical purity (HPLC: Chiralpak AD; eluent, hexane/i-PrOH - 94/6; flow rate 1 mL/min.; UV @254 nM).<br>
Method 2:<br>

Example 8<br>
Seven disilyloxydiene reagents with different R1 groups have been evaluated for enantioselectivity in the aldol condensation according to the procedure set forth in Method 1 of Example 3 to form 5(S)-hydroxy-3-ketoesters as follows:<br><br><br><br>
5(S)-hydroxy-3-ketoester (S1) was prepared using an external recycle reactor. The reactor contained a 0.5-L jacketed vessel equipped with a retreat-curve impeller and temperature sensor to determine the batch temperature; a recycle pump; a 1--0D tube packed with solids; two three-way valves placed, respectively, at the inlet and exit of the tube; connecting tubing to form an external recycle loop; and a dosing pump for adding liquid to the recycle loop<br>
The 1'-0D tube was packed with 5.06 g of 4A mol sieve pellets (Aldrich, Cat, No. 334304, Batch No.07701 LS) having a diameter of 1.6-mm. The 4A mol sieves were confined to the middle part the 1--tube using metal mesh screens. The top and bottom of the tube were packed with 3-mm Pyrex glass beads.   The sieves were heated to 115°C under a flow of N2 (100 cm3/min) and kept at this temperature for 12.5 h. Heating was accomplished using an electrical heating tape wrapped around the tube. The temperature of the bed of solids was determined using a movable RTD placed inside a 1/8- tube mounted co-axially inside the 1- tube. The two three-way valves were than switched to allow flow into the tube from the vessel, and out of the tube back to the vessel<br>
The vessel was purged of air with nitrogen, and charged with:0.4788 g of (S)-Binol, 10,70 g of aldehyde, and 222.03 g of tetrahydrofuran, and sealed. The agitator was turned on at 250 rpm, and the vessel headspace was purged of air. Flow to the recycle loop was started by turning on the recycle pump (recycle flow rate = 825 cm3/min) and the agitation rate was reduced to 225 rpm. The batch temperature was controlled at 19°C.<br>
After about 30 min, 45.44 g of a solution (comprised of 1.00 g of titanium (IV) isopropoxide in 88.95 g of THF) was added using the dosing pump over 6 min. About 20-min after this addition, 4.31 g of disilyloxydiene were added over 6 min. After 1 h, a second portion of disilyloxydiene (8.9 g over 2 min) was added. After 1 h, a third portion of disilyloxydiene (8.8 g over 2 min) was added.. After 2 days, the aldehyde disappearance was complete based on TLC analysis. The vessel and recycle loop were emptied and the reaction mixture was worked up in a separate flask by adding slowly 25 mL of 20% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid keeping the internal temperature below 10 °C (ice bath cooling).<br><br>
The mixture was then warmed to room temperature and stirred for 30 minutes. TLC showed conversion of the initial trimethylsilyl adduct to (S1) was complete. 300 mL of f-BuOMe and 200 mL of saturated NaHCO3 were added and the mixture was stirred thoroughly. After filtering the mixture to remove a small amount of insolubles, the layers were separated and the organic layer was rotoevaporated to obtain an oil which was distilled with /&gt;BuOH (2 x 160 mL,45 °C bath temp, about 20 mbar) to remove ethyl acetoacetate (formed by hydrolysis of the excess disilyloxydiene during workup). Based on NMR analysis of the crude product, an (S1) yleld of 81,6% was obtained, and the amount of undesired enantiomer was below the limit of detection.<br>
Example 10<br>
The vessel recycle loop used in Example 9 was rinsed three times, each time with at least 250 mL of tetrahydrofuran, and subsequently dried by flowing nitrogen at room temperature. The dry vessel was charged with: 0.48 g of (S)-binol, 10.67 g of aldehyde, and 222 g of tetrahydrofuran. The loop and vessel were purged of air with nitrogen. The agitator was turned on, and recycle flow was started at the same flow rate as in Example 9. with the batch temperature controlled at 19°C.<br>
After 20 min, 44.96 g of a solution of titanium (IV) isopropoxide (prepared by adding 1 g of the latter to 89.10 g of THF) was added over 4 min. After 30 min, 4.4 g of disilyloxydiene were added over 10 min. A second portion of disilyloxydiene was added (8.6 g over 2 min) one hour later. A third disilyloxydiene portion (8.8 g over 2 min) was added after 1 hour. After 2 days, the reaction was stopped and the reaction mixture was worked up as in Example 9. The yleld of (S1), based on NMR analysis of the crude, was 90%, and the amount of undesired enantiomer was below the limit of detection.<br>
