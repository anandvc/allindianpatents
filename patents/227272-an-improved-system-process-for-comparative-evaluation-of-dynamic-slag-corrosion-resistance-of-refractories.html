				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved system and process for comparative evaluation of dynamic slag corrosion resistance of refractories. More particularly, it relates to an improved system and a process for comparative evaluation of slag corrosion resistance of different quality refractories with desired slag chemistry and quantity at a high, specified temperature and duration in presence of specified grade and amount of liquid steel or metal.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In many applications, refractories are used in contact with liquid metal and slag. As for example, MgO-C bricks, used as refractory lining material in Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) come is contact with liquid steel and slag at a temperature of 1600 to 1700Â°C during operation. In steel ladles, MgO-C, high Al2O3, Al2O3-MgO-C bricks are generally used. Now-a-days different secondary metallurgical operations are carried out in these ladles and refractories are subjected to different kind of slag. It is, therefore, necessary to evaluate slag corrosion resistance of different varieties of refractories with different slags.<br>
Two types of slag corrosion resistance tests are generally carried out. One is static test and other is dynamic test. In the static test, measured quantity of powdered slag is put in a refractory crucible prepared from the test refractory brick/material and fired at a specified temperature for a specified duration. Remaining thickness and degree of slag penetration is measured after cooling.<br>
The main disadvantage of static test is that the slag become saturated with reaction product and becomes inactive.<br>
Another disadvantage of the static test is that the total refractory becomes hot but in actual application, there is a temperature gradient from the hot face to cold face.<br>
In ASTM method, a cylindrical drum lined with different test specimen is used. The drum is kept slightly inclined to the horizontal and there is an arrangement for rotation of the drum. The inside refractory lining of the drum heated by a burner from lower end and slag powder is added from the upper end of the rotating drum. The slag is melted due to high temperature,<br>
2<br><br>
reacts with the refractory and then falls from the lower end. After the test, remaining thickness is measured to evaluate comparative slag corrosion resistance. However, in this method temperature control is difficult and liquid steel is not present during the test.<br>
Thus, there is a need to provide a system and a process for evaluating slag corrosion resistance of different quality refractories with slag of desired chemistry and quality at high, specified temperature and duration in presence of specified grade and amount of liquid steel/metal and giving a clear indication about the performance of refractory in actual application like Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF), ladles, blast furnace (BF) etc..<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
The basic object of the present invention is to provide comparative evaluation of slag corrosion resistance of different quality of refractories with a desired slag chemistry and quantity in presence of liquid metal/steel.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide fast slag corrosion. The other object is to reduce evaluation time and cost of operation.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The system of the present invention for comparative evaluation of slag corrosion of refractories with metal and slag at high temperature comprises Medium Frequency Induction Furnace having capacity of melting 100 Kg. of steel. The induction furnace adapted for comparative evaluation is a vertical type crucible furnace of out side cross-section of 730 x 600 mm and 700 mm height.<br>
The refractory lining of the furnace comprises 50 mm thickness of ramming mass and 5 mm thick asbestos sheet inside the induction coil of the medium frequency induction furnace. The dimensions of the test specimens of the present invention are 228 to 232 mm (length) x 35 to 40 mm (width) x 25 to 30 mm (thickness). The combination of the samples and dimensions are such that ultimately leads to an appropriate inner volume of the furnace adapted to melt<br>
4<br><br>
18 to 20 kg of steel. 10 number of test specimens and an additional (dummy) refractory specimen are adapted for lining inside the induction furnace. The induction furnace of the present invention comprises safety backup lining prepared by ramming mass. The lining also comprises of 50 mm thick ramming mass and 5 mm thick asbestos sheet as insulation.<br>
Hollow steel pipe of 140 mm outside diameter and 250 mm height is adapted to format the said lining with test specimens inside the induction furnace. The annular gap between the rammed lining and the said format comprises ten test specimens and one dummy sample. Moist ramming mass inside the gap in the spaces between the test specimens is adapted for resisting the metal/slag attack. The said moist ramming mass comprises solution of MgSO4 with magnesia adapted to form highly refractory material at temperature higher than 1000Â°C.<br>
The process for formation of the system of the present invention involves the following process steps:<br>
1. Modification of original lining of the  induction furnace for evaluation of slag<br>
corrosion of the refractories.<br>
2. Sample preparation by cutting from the sample bricks and drying at 110Â°C for 24 hrs.<br>
3. Lining of induction furnace.<br>
4. Drying of lining.<br>
5. Melting of steel and temperature measurement at an interval of 30 minutes.<br>
6. Addition of 1st lot of slag after reaching desired temperature (e.g.l650Â°C).<br>
7. Removal of reacted slag and addition of fresh slag at an interval of 15 minutes.<br>
8. Removal of steel and slag after the evaluation for 3 to 4hrs.<br>
9. Cooling of furnace and dismantling of reacted test specimens.<br>
10. Casting of test specimens after slag corrosion in Plaster of Paris for strengthening.<br>
11. Cutting of test specimens vertically through the middle and wear measurement for<br>
comparison.<br>
5<br><br>
In the present invention, the process for comparative evaluation of dynamic slag corrosion resistance of refractories comprises major steps for comparative evaluation of 10 refractory specimens in induction furnace.<br>
At first refractory test specimens of sizes 228 to 232 mm long, 35 to 40 mm width and 25 to 30 mm thickness are cut from different quality of refractory bricks or prepared by casting/ramming from different monolithic refractories, which are to be comparatively evaluated.<br>
In the process step of lining ten test specimens and one additional refractory dummy specimen are lined inside a previously lined medium frequency induction furnace having capacity of melting about 100 kg of steel. The previously lined furnace works as safety backup lining and is prepared by ramming 90% MgO based ramming mass. Behind 50 mm thickness of ramming mass and 5 mm thick asbestos sheet are provided for lining over the induction coil.<br>
The said backup safety lining is prepared adapting a form to keep a cylindrical cavity of 220 mm diameter and 300 mm height. Then the backup lining is air dried for 48 hours and slowly preheated to 110Â°C for 24 hours. The backup safety lining is further strengthened by heating and melting 100 kg steel bars inside the induction furnace. The liquid metal thus formed is kept at 1650Â°C for 30minutes and then drained out from the furrnace<br>
10 test specimens and 1 dummy specimen are placed vertically inside the annular gap between the rammed lining and format placed centrally inside the induction furnace. The gap between the test specimens and rammed lining is filled with moist ramming mass and rammed slowly. Ramming is also done upto 25 mm above the test specimens for proper positioning and fixing of the test specimens. The format is then removed and the bottom of the furnace is rammed with moist ramming mass for embedding the test specimens by 25 mm from the lower side. The working height of the specimens range between 170mm and 175 mm adapted for melting about 20 kg of steel. The gap between the test specimens are filled with special filling such that it should not become hard after the melting operation in the induction furnace and is adapted to resist metal/ slag attack. The said gap is filled with solution of MgSO4 with magnesia. At room temperature it gives strength but at higher temperature (&gt;1000Â°C) MgSO4 dissociates to form MgO, which is highly refractory material.<br>
6<br><br>
The furnace, lined with test specimens is air dried for 16 hours and then electric bulb is adapted for slow drying of the furnace.<br>
Specified quantity of steel bar is charged inside the furnace and gradually heated by induction power for melting the steel. After melting, the temperature of the furnace is maintained by measuring temperature at regular intervals and measured quantity of desired slag powder is added. Then a part of reacted slag is taken out from the induction furnace and 25 to 50 gm of fresh slag powder is added at regular interval of 15minutes during the specified duration of 3 to 4 hrs. This helps in acceleration of corrosion reducing the evaluation time and cost.<br>
After completion of the process, metal and slag are drained out from the furnace and allowed to cool. Then the test specimens are taken out by sacrificing the additional sample (i.e. the dummy sample). The dummy sample is used along with the test specimens to facilitate dismantling by breaking. This helps in the easy removal of test specimens after the evaluation run is completed. The weak samples are strengthened by embedding the specimens in Plaster of Paris. The samples thus formed are dried before cutting.<br>
The test specimens are cut longitudinally and the wear is measured from the difference of original and final thickness. From the wear measurement, comparative evaluation is done. The comparative evaluation of refractory test specimens of different qualities is performed with liquid slag of any desired chemistry or metallurgical furnace [e.g. BOF, Ladle Furnace (LF), Vacuum Arc Degassing (VAD), etc.] in presence of liquid metal or steel in medium frequency induction furnace. Two standard test specimens in each evaluation are used so mat one set of comparative evaluation can be further compared with another set. The comparative evaluation is carried on at desired temperature of 1550 to 1650 Â°C and holding time in induction furnace of capacity 100 kg with variation of slag as well as metal.<br>
Results of slag corrosion evaluation are given in Table-1. In the process of evaluation five different qualities of bricks are evaluated by taking 2 test specimens from each quality. One of the quality (5GS-2) is taken as standard. Average wear (mm) is calculated from wear of 2 samples of same quality. Corrosion index is calculated by considering average wear of standard sample as 100. Corresponding index of other samples are determined by using the following relationship:<br>
7<br><br>
Average wear of sample A<br><br><br>
Corrosion index of sample A =<br><br>
x 100<br><br>
Average wear of standard sample<br>
Test temperature and slag chemistry, slag amount and test duration are also indicated. For further comparison of one set of results with other sets, standard sample from same refractory is used in all sets of tests. Then corrosion index is used for comparative evaluation. The comparative numerical values are given in Table 1. Test temperature, slag chemistry, slag amount and test duration are also indicated in the Table. For further comparison of one set of results with other sets, standard sample from same refractory is used in all sets of tests. Then corrosion index of one set can be compared with other sets of evaluation. Table-2 indicates details of different experiments and other possibilities for getting an idea of the process of evaluation in induction furnace.<br><br>
