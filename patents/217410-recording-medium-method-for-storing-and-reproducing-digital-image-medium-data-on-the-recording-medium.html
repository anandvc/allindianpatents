and reproducing digital image medium data on the recording medium. It is applicable to a<br>
medium information reproducing system for reproducing the medium data, and both<br>
video data and audio data can be simultaneously reproduced during the reproducing<br>
process.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Video images are an important medium for communication. Conventional<br>
cameras were first invented ISO years ago, and had gone through several phases of<br>
technical innovations. The new item in line is the digital camera, which greatly simplifies<br>
the image post-processing tasks in comparison with the images taken by the conventional<br>
camera. The image taken by a digital camera can be directly loaded into a display for<br>
instant viewing and future processing. Thereby, the reproduced image is more interesting<br>
and attractive for the viewers.<br>
However, the current image display does not provide atmospheric audio to<br>
complement the silent image. It is desirable to integrate the audio to the image so that the<br>
atmosphere of the image viewing can be further enhanced, and the mood can be recreated.<br>

In step 703, the file configuration data is first loaded into memory unit 601.<br>
According to the starting address of medium data structure file area 103, the recording<br>
medium management information is read to determine if the recording medium matches a<br>
pre-determined data format If not, the invention continues to proceed the next recording<br>
medium, then returns to step 701; otherwise, recording medium identifier 201 matches a<br>
pre-determined data format, and the invention proceeds the step 70S. In step 70S, the<br>
medium data management information in the medium data header of the medium data<br>
area #N is read according to an input number N. In step 709, video codec 603 and audio<br>
codec 60S are set, and the medium data in video data area 103b and audio data area 103c<br>

starting address of the medium data structure file area 103 is read. In step 803, the<br>
recording medium management information is read with the starting address of the<br>
medium data structure file area 103, and loaded into memory unit 601. The recording<br>
9<br><br>
medium management information comprises at least a recording medium identifier 201,<br>
the number of medium data areas 205, and the starting addresses 211-21N of medium<br>
data areas. In step 805, this invention checks and determines if the recording medium<br>
identifier 201 matches a pre-determined data format If not, the current recording medium<br>
is skipped, and the invention continues to proceed the next recording medium and returns<br>
to step 701; otherwise, the invention goes to step 705.<br>
FIG. 9A shows a flowchart illustrating the steps of setting video codec and<br>
audio codec. In step 901, the header starting code 401 is checked to determine if it is<br>
correct If not, the current data is skipped, and the invention continues to process the next<br>
data and goes to step 705. Otherwise, the invention takes the step 903 to transmit video<br>
format 405 and video resolution 406 to video codec 603, and transmit audio format 410<br>
and audio bit-rate 411 to audio codec 605. Finally, it goes to step 905.<br>
FIG. 9B shows a flowchart illustrating the steps of reproducing video data and<br>
audio data. In step 905, the video data and the audio data are respectively loaded into<br>
memory unit 601 according to the starting address 403 of a video data area, the length<br>
404 of a video data area, the starting address 408 of an audio data area, and the length<br>
409 of an audio data area. The video and audio data in memory unit 601 is then<br>
transmitted to video codec 603 and audio codec 605, respectively. In step 907, the<br>
invention starts to reproduce the video and audio for a specified play time 414. In step<br>
909, the invention checks if the repeat mode is activated. If so, it returns to step 907;<br>
otherwise, it takes step 911 to determine if the reproducing process is to be continued. If<br>
so, it continues to process the next data and goes to step 705; otherwise, it ends up me<br>
reproducing process.<br>
10<br><br>
In summary, the present invention allows the user to store and edit digital<br>
medium data by means of the structure of the recording medium. When the video images<br>
