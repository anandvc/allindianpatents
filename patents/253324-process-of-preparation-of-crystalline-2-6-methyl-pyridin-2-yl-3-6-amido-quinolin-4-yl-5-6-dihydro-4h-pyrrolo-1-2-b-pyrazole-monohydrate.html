				<td>A PYRIDIN QUINOLIN SUBSTITUTED PYRROLO[1,2-B]PYRAZOLE MONOHYDRATE AS TGF- BETA INHIBITOR<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-ß) is a prototype for a large family of growth and differentiation factors that regulate development. TGF-P family members activate transmembrane serine/threonine receptor kinases, thereby initiating a signaling cascade via Smads, a novel class of intracellular signaling effectors that regulate gene expression. TGF-P is a potent inducer of growth arrest in many cell types, including epithelial cells. This activity is the basis of the tumor suppressor role of the TGF-p signaling system in carcinomas. Other activities, including TGF-p-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal differentiation, contribute to cancer progression.<br>
TGF-p family signaling is of special relevance in mesenchymal differentiation, including bone development. Deregulated expression or activation of components of this signaling system can contribute to skeletal diseases, e.g. osteoarthritis. See Wakefield, et al. (2002) Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development 12:22-29; Siegel, et al. (2003) Nature Reviews (Cancer) 3:807-820; Dumont, et al. (2003) Cancer Cell 3:531-536.<br>
PCT patent application WO 02/0948332 describes a genus of<br>
dihydropyrrolopyrazole compounds useful for treating disorders associated with enhanced TGF-P signaling activity or overproduction. PCT patent application WO 04/04382 describes an anhydrous form of 2-(6-methyl-pyridhi-2-yl)-3-[6-amido-quinolin-4-yl)-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[ 1,2-b]pyrazole.<br>
It has been surprisingly discovered that 2-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-3-[6-amido-quinolin-4-yl)-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[l,2-b]pyrazole can be prepared in a crystalline monohydrate form having the advantageous properties relative to the anhydrous form of superior solid handling properties on a large scale, ease of purification by crystallization, and thermodynamic stability under conditions of pharmaceutical processing and storage. A manufacturing process for the new form has also been discovered.<br><br>

In one of its method aspects, this invention is directed to a method for treating susceptible neoplasms comprising administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of 2-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-3-[6-amido-quinolin-4-yl)-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[l,2-b]pyrazole monohydrate.<br>
The present invention provides 2-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-3-[6-amido-quinolin-4-yl)-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[l,2-b]pyrazole monohydrate for use in therapy. The present<br><br>
invention provides for the use of 2-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-3-[6-amido-quinolin-4-yl)-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[l,2-b]pyrazole monohydrate for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of disorders associated with enhanced TGF-ß signaling activity or overproduction.<br>
In another embodiment this invention provides a process for making 2-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-3-[6-amido-quinolin-4-yl-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[l,2-b]pyrazole monohydrate and novel intermediates useful for making crystalline 2-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-3-[6-amido-quinolin-4-yl)-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[ 1 ,2-b]pyrazole monohydrate: 6-cyano-4-methyl-quinolinehydrochloride, 2-(6-cyano-quinolin-4-yl)-l-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-ethanone; l-amino)-2-pyrrolidinone, p-toluene sulfonate; l-[(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-2-(6-cyano-quinolin-4-yl)-ethylideneamino]-pyrrolidin-2-one; and 3-(6-cyano-quinolin-4~yl)-2-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[l,2-b]pyrazole.<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
The term "l-[(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-2-(6-cyano-quinolin-4-yl)-ethylideneamino]-pyrrolidin-2-one" refers to<br><br><br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
The term "effective amount" of a compound of the present invention refers to an amount, that is, the dosage which is effective in treating the disorders described herein.<br>
An effective amount can be readily determined by the attending diagnostician, as one skilled in the art, by the use of conventional techniques and by observing results obtained under analogous circumstances. In determining an effective amount, the dose of a compound of the present invention, a number of factors are considered by the attending diagnostician, including, but not limited to: the compound of the present invention to be administered; the co-administration of other therapies, if used; the species of mammal; its size, age, and general health; the specific disorder involved; the degree of involvement or the severity of the disorder, the response of the individual patient; the mode of administration; the bioavailability characteristics of the preparation administered; the dose regimen selected; the use of other concomitant medication; and other relevant circumstances.<br>
An effective amount of a compound of the present invention is expected to be delivered QD or BID at 10 mg to 1 g total daily dose, preferably from 100-200 mg preferred flat dose. An effective amount could also be once a day or once a week dosing with sustained release formulations. More preferred amounts can be determined by one skilled in the art.<br>
It is understood that TGF-ß includes both TGF-ßl and TGF-ß2.<br>
Conditions "characterized by enhanced TGF-ß activity" include those wherein TGF-p synthesis is stimulated so that TGF-p is present at increased levels or wherein<br><br>
TGF-ß latent protein is undesirably activated or converted to active TGF-ß protein or wherein TGF-p receptors are upregulated or wherein the TGF-ß protein shows enhanced binding to cells or extracellular matrix in the location of the disease. Thus, in either case "enhanced activity" refers to any condition wherein the biological activity of TGF-P is undesirably high, regardless of the cause.<br>
There are several types of cancer, i.e., susceptible neoplasms, where TGF-P1 produced by the tumor may be deleterious. These include prostrate cancer (e.g., Steiner and Barrack (1992) Mol. Endocrinol 6:15-25), colorectal cancer (e.g., Neurath et al. (2004) Immunity. 21:491-501), breast cancer (e.g.,Arteaga, et al. (1993) Cell Growth and Differ. 4:193-201), non-small cell lung cancer (e.g., Ready et al., (Apr 2005) Semin Oncol. 32(2 Suppl 3):S35-41, ovarian cancer (e.g., Dr. Gustavo C. Rodriguez, (March 2-7, 2001) 32nd Annual Meeting of the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists. Nashville, TN), endometrial cancer (e.g., Dowdy et al, (Feb 2005) Gynecol Oncol. 96(2): 368-73), testicular cancer (e.g., Morera et al., (1992) Endocrinology. 130:831-836), osteosarcoma (e.g., Kloen et al., (Aug 1,1994) Int J Cancer. 58(3):440-5), and multiple myeloma (e.g., Cook et al., (1999) Journal of Leukocyte Biology, Vol 66, Issue 6:981-988). See also PCT patent application WO 02/0948332.<br>

X-Ray Powder Diffraction<br>
The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern of the crystalline monohydrate was obtained on a Siemens D5000 X-ray powder diffractometer, equipped with a CuKa source (λ= 1.54056 A) and a Kevex solid state Si(Li) detector, operating at 50 kV and 40 mA. Each sample was scanned between 3 and 40 in 29, with a step size of 0.02° in 29 and a scan rate of 9.0 seconds/step, and with 1 mm divergence and receiving slits and a 0.1 mm detector slit. The dry powder was packed into recessed top-loading sample holder and a smooth surface was obtained using a glass slide. The monohydrate crystal form diffraction pattern, collected at ambient temperature and relative humidity, was adjusted based on the NIST 675 standard peak at 8.85 degrees 2-theta.<br><br>

Thus, a properly prepared sample of 2-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-3-[6-amido-quinolin-4-yl-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[l,2-b]pyrazole monohydrate may be characterized by X-ray diffraction pattern using CuKa radiation as having diffraction peaks (2-theta values) as described in Table 1, and in particular having peaks at 9.05 in combination with one or more of the peaks at 11.02,11.95, and 14.84; and more particularly having a peak at 9.05; with a tolerance for the diffraction angles of 0.1 degrees, more preferably .01 degrees.<br>
Solid-State 13C NMR Spectroscopy<br>
13C Cross polarization / magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) NMR (solid-state NMR or SSNMR) spectra were obtained for the crystalline monohydrate using a Varian Unity Inova 400 MHz NMR spectrometer operating at a carbon frequency of 100.573 MHz and equipped with a complete solids accessory and a Chemagnetics 4.0 mm T3 probe. Ramped-amplitude cross-polarization (RAMP-CP) at 62 kHz and two-pulse phase modulation (TPPM) decoupling at 70 kHz were used. Acquisition parameters were as follows: 90° proton radio frequency pulse width 4.0 jis, contact time 2.0 ms, pulse<br>
repetition time 60 s, MAS frequency 10 kHz, spectral width 50 kHz, and acquisition time 50 ms. Chemical shifts were referenced to the methyl group of hexamethylbenzene (8 = 17.3 ppm) by sample replacement.<br>
13C chemical shifts of monohydrate crystal form: 20.5, 22.5,26.3,48.7,108.8,115.6, 122.6,127.9, 128.8, 130.5, 136.4,146.8,149.0,151.3, 152.0, 153.2,157.9, and 171.0 (+/-<br>
0.2) ppm.<br>
Thus, crystalline 2-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-3-[6-amido-quinolin-4-yl-5,6-dihydro-<br>
4H-pyrrolo[l,2-b]pyrazole monohydrate may be characterized by solid state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance having chemical shift (ppm) of 108.8,115.6,122.6, and 171.0 (+/-0.2) ppm.<br>
In another embodiment this invention provides a process for preparing 2-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-3-[6-amido-quino]in-4-yl-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[l,2-b]pyrazole monohydrate comprising crystallizing 2-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-3-[6-amido-quinolin-4-yl-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[l,2-b]pyrazole from an appropriate solvent containing an organic solvent to water ratio of 0-90% under conditions which yield 2-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-3-[6-amido-quinolin-4-yl-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrro!o[l,2-b]pyrazole monohydrate.<br>
2-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-3-[6-amido-quinolin-4-yl-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[l,2-bjpyrazole monohydrate may be prepared by crystallization under controlled conditions. In particular, the monohydrate of the present invention can be prepared by crystallization from an aqueous solvent. A suitable solvent is one that has an organic solvent to water ratio of 0-90% organic solvent. Preferred is an organic solvent to water ratio between 60:40 to 85:15. More preferred is an organic solvent to water ratio of 75:25. Preferred organic solvents are acetonitrile, acetone, tetrahydrafuran (THF), methyl ethyl ketone, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethyl formamide (DMF), N,N-dimethyl acetamide, and N-methyl pyrrolidinone. In practice, it has been found that acetone is most preferred. After suspending anhydrous, monohydrated, or partially hydrated 2-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-3-[6-amido-quinolin-4-yl-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[l,2-b]pyrazole in a suitable solvent, the mixture is stirred at 20 to 100 °C, preferably 60 °C. For lower boiling point solvents such as acetonitrile, acetone, and methyl ethyl ketone, the volume of the resulting solution is reduced, preferably by distillation, to between 35-70% of the initial volume, preferably 50%. For higher boiling point solvents, an appropriate amount of additional water may<br>
need to be added to precipitate the product. During the reduction, seed crystals of monohydrate may be added. Slowly cool the solution to 0-5 °C, preferably in two stages wherein the solution is first cooled to 20-25 °C over 90 minutes followed by cooling to 0-5 °C over 30-40 minutes. Hold the slurry at 0-5 °C for an additional 30 minutes to 25 hours, preferably 2-3 hours. Filter the slurry and rinse the product, preferably with water or aqueous organic solvent. Dry the product, preferably at 45 °C.<br>
In another embodiment 2-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-3-[6-amido-quinolin-4-yl)-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[l,2-b]pyrazole monohydrate can be prepared by reslurrying 2-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-3-[6-amido-quinolin-4-yl)-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[l,2-b]pyrazole in water or aqueous DMSO.<br>
2-(6-Methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-3-[6-amido-quinolin-4-yl-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[l,2-b]pyrazole monohydrate may be prepared by stirring in 10 volumes of 0-90% organic solvent to water at room temperature for 1-2 hours, filtering, and drying at 35-45 °C, preferably 45 °C under vacuum. In cases where organic solvent is used, the reaction mixture may be diluted with water (2-5 times the volume of organic solvent used) to improve recovery.<br>
Crystalline 2-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-3-[6-amido-quinolin-4-yl)-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[l,2-b]pyrazole monohydrate can be prepared by a variety of procedures, some of which are illustrated in the examples below. It will be recognized by one of skill in the art that the order of the individual steps in the following may be varied to provide crystalline 2-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-y])-3-[6-amido-quinolin-4-yl)-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[ 1,2-b]pyrazole monohydrate:<br>
