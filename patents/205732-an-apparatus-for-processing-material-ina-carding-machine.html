				<td>The Carding machines are provided with feeding device comprising a feed roller and a feed plate cooperating therewith. The fibre batt supplied to the carding machine is firmly held between the feed roller and the feed plate and due to the rotation of the feed roller the fibre batt is slowly advanced into the licker-in zone. The Carding machines are provided with a licker-in roller. The fibre batt is opened by the clothing of the licker-in roller and the opened fibres are carried by the licker- in roller for delivery on to the card cylinder, clothed with wire points for subsequent opening and so on. For the removal of waste and dirt from the opened batt, stationary carding elements, also known as combing segment associated with mote knife and discharge opening is present in the carding machine.<br>
The licker- in roller present immediately next to the feed roller rotates significantly faster than the feed roller and the fibres opened by the licker-in roller passes through the stationary carding element, mote knife and the discharge opening present in the licker-in under casing zone. The opened fibres carried by the licker-in roller is further opened by the stationary carding elements gently. The loose fibres carried by the licker-in roller is stripped by the mote knife and dropped in to the discharge opening, which may be collected in a chamber provided and removed by suitable suction means.<br>
It is found advantageous to open the fibre in between the feed roller and cylinder by employing plurality of licker-in rollers. Also it is found advantageous to open the fibre gently by using plurality of licker-in rollers associated with stationary carding elements/combing segments, mote knives and discharge openings. The licker-in rollers can be arranged such that the circumferential speed of the licker- in rollers are gradually increasing from feed roller zone to the cylinder zone to facilitate smooth transfer of fibre. The licker-in rollers are normally provided with clothing/saw tooth wires such that the saw tooth wire points provided on the 2nd licker-in roller is finer â€¢ than that of the 1st licker-in roller. Likewise the saw tooth wire points present in the 3 rd licker-in roller is finer than that of the 2nd licker-in roller.<br>
The batt opened by the 1st licker-in roller is transported to the 2nd licker-in roller, and from 2nd licker-in roller to the 3rd licker-in roller and then the opened fibre is carried by the wire points present in the cylinder.<br>
Since the 2nd and the 3rd licker-in rollers are also provided with stationary carding elements, mote knife and waste discharge opening, the fibre reaches the cylinder in the carding machines employing multiple licker-in is well opened and well cleaned. The fibres carried by the cylinder in cooperation with revolving flats is fully opened and parallelized and the fibres are subsequently doffed by the doffer and detaching device and present to the delivery rollers in sliver form, through a web doffing device, which is normally present in high production cards . The sliver delivered by the delivery rollers is transferred to the revolving sliver cans through the coiler calender rollers and can coiler.<br><br>
Though it is found that the 1st licker-in roller in combination with unitary stationary carding element in association with mote knife and waste discharge opening in multiple licker-in roller arrangement opens the fibres to the required level, it is found advantageous to use plurality of arcual combing segments, mote knives in combination with discharge opening between stationary carding elements provided to the 1st licker-in roller, for the improved opening and cleaning of the material due to the fact that the arcual combing segments are provided with opening points arranged at a radius matching with the radius of the licker-in roller<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide plurality of arcual stationary carding elements, mote knives to the 1st licker-in roller. Another object of the invention is to arrange the licker-in rollers at an inclination to advantageously use the gravitational force at the gentle flow path for the dropping of the hard waste stripped by the mote knives. It also aids in more comfort for work underneath the licker-in rollers , space advantage and easy access for inspection of parts underneath 3 rd licker-in roller from 1st roller position.<br>
Accordingly this invention provides an apparatus and method for processing fibre material in a carding machine comprises feed plate with associated feed roller plurality of licker-in rollers with associated carding elements/combing segment, mote knives and waste discharge openings characterized in that combing segments located underneath the 1st licker-in roller are  of arcual construction.<br>

Figure 9 schematically illustrates one view of the arcual combing segments (6) and (7) according to this invention, constructed with pins in which the population of pins per unit area in the arcual combing segment (7) is greater than that of the population of pins per unit area in the arcual licker-ins (6).<br>
Figure 10 schematically illustrates one view of the arcual combing segments (6) and (7) according to this invention, constructed with pins in which the population of pins per unit area are different in different zones of the arcual combing segments (6) and (7).<br>
The fibre is presented to the nip between the slowly rotating feed roller (1) and the feed plate (2). Immediately down stream said feed roller (1) and feed plate (2), 1st licker-in roller ( 3) clothed with metallic wires or constructed with pins is present. Underneath said licker-in roller (3) of multiple licker-in (3,4,5) ,the combing segments (6,7) are present and the same are constructed with cleaning elements in the form of laminas (20) or pins (22) which are arranged in a radius (R) corresponding to the radius of the licker-in roller (3), there by known as arcual combing segments. On the other hand in the known replaceable carding elements , the cleaning points are arranged in straight line fashion resulting ineffective working since only few wire points are in cleaning action. . Because of the arcual construction of the combing segments according to the invention, all the cleaning points are located at the same radial distance from the licker-in roller wire points, which results in more effective opening and cleaning of the fibre material.<br>
Said arcual combing segments (6,7) are advantageously made of laminas(20) arranged at a predetermined distance by using spacer (21) in between them and at a predetermined radius by suitable means, for example ,using araldite molding such that when said arcual combing segment is assembled in the carding machine , all the cleaning and opening points of said arcual combing segment (6,7) is at equal radial distance from the wire points of said   1st   licker-in roller (3)  . The spacing between<br><br>
said laminas can be suitably adopted to vary the density of cleaning and opening points of said arcual combing segments(6,7) by varying the thickness "t" of spacer(21) in the range 0.8 to 3mm preferably 2.5mm. Also said laminas can be constructed with different profile (20a) with pitch "p" in the range 4 to 5.5 mm preferably 4.7mm, height "h" in the range 2.3 to 3.3mm preferably 2.8 mm and the angle "B" in the range 36 to 50 degrees preferably 43 degrees to suit different material being processed. The arcual combing segments (6,7) may also be constructed using profiled block (23) made of light weight material for example aluminium, araldite mould - in which holes are made according to the pre determined patern and required pre determined population of pins(22) in the range 40 to 86 pins per square inch preferably 42 pins per square inch .The pins(22) are pressed in the holes provided on the profiled block (23), such that when said arcual combing segments are assembled in the carding machine , all the points of the pins (22) of said arcual combing segment (6,7) are at equal radial distance from the wire points of said 1st licker-in roller ( 3) . The arcual combing segments (6) and (7) may be constructed either with the same population of pins per unit area or the arcual combing segment (7) may be constructed with population of pins greater by 1.3 to 1.6 times preferably 1.5 times than that of the population of pins per unit area present in the arcual combing segment (6). Alternatively the arcual combing segments may be constructed with pins arranged in 2 to 4 zones, preferably in 3 zones such that the population of pins per unit area are different in different zones within the arcual combing segments, which progressively increases along the flow direction of the material indicated by arrow in figures 8,9 and 10. In the arcual combing segments (6,7) the laminas (20) or the pins (22) are arranged at an helix angle (A)along the direction of flow of the material in the range 5 degrees to 15 degrees, preferably 7.5 degrees. The helix angle (A) is arranged in counter clock wise direction with respect to the flow direction of material in the arcual combing segment (6) while the same is arranged in clock wise direction with respect to the flow direction of material in the arcual combing segment (7). Said arcual combing segments (6,7) are arranged on the carding machine such that it is provided with means for adjusting the radial distance ( D2 ) between said 1st licker-in roller (3) and said arcual combing segment (6) and the radial distance (D4) between said 1st licker-in roller (3) and said arcual combing segments (7). Also means are provided for the clamping of said arcual combing segments (6,7) at the required position. At the fibre entry region of each of said arcual combing segments (6,7) mote knives (6a&amp;7a) are provided respectively , with means for adjusting the distance (Dl) between the knife edge of said mote knife(6a) and said licker-in roller (3) and the distance (D3) between the knife edge of said mote knife(7a) and said licker-in roller (3) .In between said arcual combing segments (6,7) , a waste discharge opening ( D5 ) is provided for dropping of the waste. Waste chamber (10,11,12 ) are provided for collecting the waste removed from said 1st licker-in roller (3). Said waste chambers (10,11,12) are advantageously connected to a suction system for collection and disposal of the waste. It is found from experience , said arcual combing segments (6,7) using laminas are more advantageous for the removal of hard waste rather than the replaceable type carding elements in said Is licker-in roller zone.<br>
Immediately  down stream to  said 1st licker-in roller ( 3) ,  2nd      licker-in roller (4) and 3rd licker-in roller (5)   are provided. Said 2nd licker-in roller (4) co-operates with<br><br>
said 1st and 3rd licker-in rollers (3, 5) and said 3rd licker-in roller ( 5) cooperates with the cylinder (14) . The said cylinder (14) is provided in the known way for the opening and transportation of the fibre for subsequent processing by the carding machine . The sense of rotation of said feed roller ( 1) , said licker-in rollers ( 3,4,5 ) are denoted with arrows and shown in figure 1 .Said 2nd licker- in roller ( 4) is provided with carding element (8) in association with mote knife (8a) and a deflector (8b) to control the waste discharge . Said 3rd licker-in roller ( 5 ) is also provided with carding element (9) in association with mote knife (9a) and a deflector (9b) to control the waste discharge. It is found advantageous to use said carding elements ( 8,9 ) as replaceable type due to the fact that it is enough to provide gentle opening in said 2nd and 3rd licker-in roller zone , since the fibres are already opened substantially by said 1st licker-in roller. Said licker-in rollers (3,4,5 ) are arranged on a frame (13) as a module and are provided with independent means for driving, may be by a separate motor (15). Means are provided for setting the distance between said licker-in rollers (3,4,5). Said licker-in roller module can be attached to the carding machine frame at the pre determined position to get the required setting between said 1st licker-in roller (3) and said feed roller (1) as well as between said 3rd licker-in roller (5) and said cylinder (14).<br>
Said licker-in rollers (3 ,4,5 ) are driven by said motor (15) through belt(16) and pulleys (17,18,19 ). The diameter of said pulleys (17,18,19 ) can be adopted according to the speed requirement of said licker - in rollers ( 3,4 5 ) to facilitate smooth transfer of fibre material.<br>
As explained earlier , in this invention said plurality of the licker- in rollers (3,4,5) are arranged on a separate module. Said licker-in rollers (3,4 ,5 ) are arranged in said frame(13) such that the axis of said licker-in rollers are at an angle 10 to 25deg, preferably 15deg with respect to the horizontal axis to facilitate gravitational droppings of the waste. Also keeping said licker-in rollers at an inclination resulting in lesser floor space occupied by the carding machine per kg of production of sliver. More over such inclined arrangement facilitates easy access to the inspection of parts present underneath said 3rd licker-in roller from said 1st licker-in roller position. More space under said 1st licker-in roller results in more comfort for working.<br>
