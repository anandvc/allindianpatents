HELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a  method for treating or reducing the likelihood of acquiring problems affecting the layer lamina propria or the layer muscularis of the vagina using sex steroid precursors alone or in a novel combination therapy on susceptible warm-blooded animals, including humans. In particular, the combinations include administering a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and raising the patient's level of precursors of sex steroids, said precursor being selected from the group consisting of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), and androst-5-ene-3ß,17ß-di6l (5-diol). Estrogens may also be administered to conteract the potential effects of some SERMs on hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms. Type 5 cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor may also be adrninistered to improve sexual activity. The invention also relates to kits and pharmaceutical compositions for practicing the foregoing combination.<br>
[0002] In US 5,843, 932, was reported the effect on vaginal atrophy of one, three or six months treatment with DHEA administered at a<br>
dose of 30 mg twice daily in a solution of 50% ethanol-50% propylene glycol on an area of 2 cm2 of the dorsal skin in ovariectomized rat. Histopathologic examination showed proliferation and murification of the vaginal epithelium and reversal of vaginal mucosal atrophy in the rats treated with DHEA<br>
[0003] The study performed with the rat when DHEA was applied on the dorsal skin for 1, 3 and 6 months examined only the effect on the vaginal epithelium (Sourla et al,, 1998, J. Steroid Biochem Mol Biol., 66(3): 137-149) and not on the two other layers, namely the lamina propria and the muscularis. It was then observered that DHEA was about 10 times more efficient on the vaginal epithelium when applied topically than when administered on the skin at a site distant from the vagina, thus requiring systemic absorption to exert its action.<br>
[0004] In a previous study on the effect of DHEA administered on the skin in posrmenopausal women for 12 months in a 10% DHEA cream, only the estrogenic activity of DHEA was evaluated (Labrie et al., 1997, J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., 82: 3498-3505). It was indicated (page 3500) "Vaginal cytology was examined as specific parameter of the estrogenic action of DHEA". This is due to the method of evaluation, namely vaginal smear which is limited to the superficial and easily removed cells of the epithelium.<br>
[0005] The present invention describes the effects of DHEA and other components on the three layers of the vagina, namely the muscularis, the lamina propria and the epithelium with novel benefits at the three levels. The beneficial effects of DHEA on the lamina propria and muscularis are believed to be of major importance for the<br>
positive action of inhibitors of type 5 cGMP phospho-diesterase, such as viagra and other compounds or prostaglandin El.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE RELATED ART<br>
[0006] Vaginal dryness affects about 50% of postmenopausal women at the age of 50 to 60 years and 72% after 70 years (Rossin-Amar, 2000, Gynecol Obstet Fertil, 28(3): 245-249). Of .these women, about 80% experience urogenital disorders, especially vaginitis and dyspareunia (Pandit and Ouslander, 1997, Am} Med Sci, 314(4): 228-31). Since these problems are believed to be at least partially related to a deprivation of sex steroids, appropriate local hormonal replacement therapy should be considered at menopause. It has recently been recognized that postmenopausal women are not only deprived of all ovarian estrogens but they are also progressively deprived of the androgens originating from the peripheral intracrine transformation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) into both androgens and estrogens (Labrie et al., 1991, Mol Cell Endocrinol,'78: C113-C118; Labrie et al., 1995, Ann NY Acad Sci, 774:16-28; Labrie et al, 2003, End Rev, 24(2): 152-182). In fact, serum DHEA and DHEA-S progressively decrease from the age of 30 to 40 years (Labrie et al., 2003, End Rev, 24(2): 152-182; Orentreich et al., 1984, J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 59: 551-555; Labrie et al., 1997, J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 82: 2396-2402). A series of studies indicate that low levels of DHEA and DHEA-S are associated with a series of age-related morbidity and diseases (Labrie et al., 1997, J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., 82: 3498-3505; Helzlsouer et al., 1992, Cancer Res, 52(1): 1-4; Szathmari et al., 1994, Osteoporos hit, 4(2): 84-88; Thoman and Weigle, 1989, Adv Immununol, 46: 221-261; Barrett-Connor et al., 1999, J Reprod Med, 44(12): 1012-1020; Barrett-Connor et al., 1999, J Am Genatr Soc, 47(6): 685-691).<br>
[0007] An efficient approach to alleviate vaginal dryness and other menopausal symptoms is the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (Greendale and Judd, 1993, J Am Geriatr Soc, 41(4): 426-436; Studd et al., 1980, Pasetto, Paleotti and Ambrus Eds, MT Press, Lancaster, p: 127-139). Recent clinical studies, however, have indicated that combining estrogens and progestihs increases the incidence of breast cancer with a potential negative impact on cardiovascular events (Colditz et al., 1995, N Engl J Med, 332: 1589-1593; Ross et al., 2000, J Natl Cancer Inst, 92(4): 328-332; Rossouw et al., 2002, JAMA, 288(3): 321-333). Meanwhile, there is an increasing interest in the potential of combined estrogen-androgen replacement therapy (Rosenberg et al., 1997, J Reprbd Med, 42(7): 394-404; Burd et al., 2001, Curr Women Health Rep,l(3):202-205), although the use of the estrogenic component is limited by the potential complications mentioned above. Based upon recent advances in our understanding of human sex steroid physiology,- especially in postmenopausal women (Labrie et al., 1991, Mol Cell Endocrinol, 78: C113-C118; Labrie et al., 2003, End Rev, 24(2): 152-182), the use of DHEA becomes a possibility to provide postmenopausal women with the appropriate levels of androgens and estrogens synthesised in specific tissues by intracrine mechanisms, with no systemic effects (Labrie et al., 1997, J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., 82: 3498-3505: 16-28; Labrie et al., 2003, End Rev, 24(2): 152-182; Labrie, 2001, Ref Gyn Obstet, 8: 317-322; Lasco et al., 2002, 145: 457-461). The restauration of androgen-sensitive elements of vaginal function should also help the action of inhibitors of type 5 cGMP phosphodiesterase or prostaglandin El.<br>
[0008] The selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) Acolbifene (EM-652) is a benzopyran derivative originally developed for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer (Gauthier et al., 1997, ]<br>
Med Chem, 40: 2117-2122). Acolbifene is the compound having the highest affinity of all known compounds for the ER (Gauthier et al, 1997, J Med Chem, 40: 2117-2122; Labrie et al., 1999, J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol, 69 (1-6): 51-84; Tremblay et al., 1997, Mol. Endocrinol., 11: 353-365) and it exerts its activity on both ERa and ERp (Tremblay et al., 1998, Endocrinology, 139: 111-118). This compound displays a pure and highly potent antiestrogenic activity in the mammary gland and endometrium while decreasing serum cholesterol and triglycerides and preventing bone loss, at least in the rat (Labrie et al., 1999, J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol, 69 (1-6): 51-84). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the administration of DHEA, not only does not interfere, but does exert an additive inhibitory effect with the pure antiestrogen Acolbifene on human breast tumour growth in the nude mouse (Dauvois et al., 1991, Cancer Res, 51: 3131-3135; Luo et al., 1997, Endocrinology, 138: 4435-4444). Combined treatment of DHEA and Acolbifene has been proposed as a beneficial chemopreventive and therapeutic approach in breast cancer (Labrie, 2001, Ref Gynecol Obstet, 8: 317-322). In fact, the inhibitory effect of DHEA on the growth of human breast cancer xenografts in nude mice supports its use as hormone replacement therapy (Dauvois et al., 1991, Cancer'Res, 51: 3131-3135; Couillard et al., 1998, J Natl Cancer Inst, 90: 772-778).<br>
[0009] WO 99/63974 disclosed medical uses of a selective estrogen receptor modulator in combination with sex steroid precursors<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00010]	It is accordingly an object of the present invention to<br>
provide effective methods of treatment for vaginal problems, more particularly vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and sexual dysfunction<br>
which can lead to decrease in sexual desire and activity while minimizing undesirable side effects.<br>
[00011]	It is another object to provide methods of reducing the<br>
risk of acquiring the above problems.<br>
[00012]	In one embodiment, the invention pertains to a method<br>
of treating or reducing the risk of acquiring vaginal dryness comprising increasing levels of a sex steroid precursor selected from the group consisting of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S) and androst-5-ene-3β,17β-diol (5-diol), in a subject or patient in need of said treatment or said steroid precursor, and further comprising administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SEKM) as part of a combination therapy.<br>
[00013]	In    another    embodiment,    the    invention    includes<br>
additional administration of estrogens to conteract the effects of SERMs on hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms.<br>
[0014]	In   another   embodiment,   the   invention   includes<br>
additional administration of a Type 5 cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor or prostaglandin E1 to improve sexual activity.<br>
[0015] As used herein, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) is a compound that either directly or through its active metabolite functions as an estrogen receptor antagonist ("antiestrogen") in breast tissue, yet provides estrogenic or estrogen-like effect on bone tissue and on serum cholesterol levels (i.e. by reducing serum cholesterol). Non-steroidal compounds that<br>
function as estrogen receptor antagonists in vitro or in human or rat breast tissue (especially if the compound acts as an antiesrrogen on human breast cancer cells) is likely to function as a SERM. Conversely, steroidal antiestrogens tend not to function as SERMs because they tend not to display any beneficial effect on serum cholesterol. Non-steroidal antiestrogens we have tested and found to function as SERMs include EM-800, EM-01538, Raloxifene, Tamoxifen, Droloxifene, Toremifene, Idoxifene, TSE-424, ERA-923, Lasoxifene (CP 336156), Arzoxifene (LY 353 381) and GW-5638. We have tested the steroidal antiestrogen ICI 182,780 and found not to function as SERM. SERMs, in accordance with the invention may be administered in the same dosage as known in the art when these compounds are used as antiestrogens.<br>
[0016J Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that SERMs, many of which, preferably, have two aromatic rings linked by one to two carbon atoms, are expected to interact with the estrogen receptor by virtue of the foregoing portion of the molecule that is best recognized by the receptor. Preferred SERMs have side chains which may selectively cause antagonistic properties in breast tissue without having significant antagonistic properties in other tissues. Thus, the SERMs may desirably functions as antiestrogens in the breast while surprisingly and desirably functioning as estrogens (or providing estrogen-like activity) in bone and on the blood components (where concentrations of lipids and/or cholesterol are favorably affected). The favorable effect on cholesterol and/or lipids potentially translates to a favorable effect against atherosclerosis which is known to be adversely affected by improper levels of cholesterol and lipids.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0028]	Figure 1 shows the Division along the longitudinal axis<br>
of the rat vagina into seven cross-segments, from the external orifice (ostium) (segment 1) to the cervix level (segment 7) (portio vaginalis uteri).<br>
[0029]	Figure      2      shows      the      vaginal      epithelium<br>
histomorphology of segment 5 in the nine groups of rats.  Ear in (J),<br>
(A)	As   representative  of  the  estrogenic   effect,  the   stratified<br>
squamous epithelium of cycling rats at estrous consists of four main<br>
layers: one cell layer of stratum basale (b), 6 to 7 cell layers of stratum<br>
spinosum (s) and a stratum granulosum of 5 to 6 layers (g) overlaid by<br>
the stratum corneum (c) made of tightly packed flattened cornified<br>
cells.<br>
(B)	Cycling  rats  at  proestrus  which  are under  an  estrogenic-<br>
progestational influence, are used to illustrate mucification. In most<br>
segments 2 to 7, one basal cell layer (b) was overlaid by 5 to 6 cell<br>
layers of stratum spinosum (s),  and a stratum mucification  (m)<br>
consisting of 3-4 layers of mucous cells.<br>
(C)	In the OVX control, a basal cell layer (b) was overlaid by a layer<br>
of atrophic cuboidal cells (a).<br>
(D)	The vaginal epithelium of OVX rats treated with an daily oral<br>
dose of Acolbifene, (2.5 mg/kg) shows atrophy, but with an outer<br>
layer of low columnar mucous cells (m) overlying the basal cell layer (b),<br>
(E)	Vaginal epithelium of OVX rats treated with an daily oral dose of<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0047] After cessation of estrogen secretion by the ovaries at menopause, practically all androgens and estrogens are synthesized in peripheral target tissues by intracrine mechanisms from dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) of adrenal origin. In fact, in the absence of ovarian estrogens, the gradual decrease in serum DHEA is likely to play an important role in the vaginal dryness, inflammation, dyspareunia and sexual dysfunction frequently associated with menopause. In order to assess the specific estrogenic and/or androgenic effects of a potential novel hormone replacement therapy that could, among other beneficial effects; alleviate vaginal dryness, we have examined the morphology of the rat vagina eight months after ovariectomy (OVX) and treatment of OVX animals with DHEA, conjugated estrogens (Premarin) and the selective estrogen receptor modulator Acolbifene, administered alone or in combination. In intact animals at estrus and in OVX rats treated with Premarin, the typical vaginal estrogenic pattern is a keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. OVX led to a general atrophy associated with<br>
inflammatory changes while Acolbifene reduced the inflammation incidence and increased the number, and size of mucous cells in the vaginal epithelium. At the doses used, Premarin completely reversed the OVX-induced epithelial atrophy, while DHEA partially reversed the atrophy. In fact, the vaginal epithelium of OVX animals treated with DHEA became hyperplastic with 3-5 layers of columnar mucous and goblet cells typical of an androgenic effect. The addition of Premarin to DHEA led to an epithelium thicker than in intact animals. Moreover, compactness of the collagen fibers in the lamina propriu was increased by DHEA. On the other hand, treatment with Acolbifene alone showed a tendency for an increase in the lamina propriu thickness, which reached intact values when combined with DHEA.<br><br>
[0048] After OVX, the vaginal muscular layer was decreased by 46%, an effect which was 41% and 100% reversed by DHEA and Premarin, respectively. On the other hand, the 50% decrease in total vaginal wall thickness following OVX was 42% and 93% reversed by DHEA and Premarin, respectively, while the combination of DHEA and Acolbifene reversed total vaginal wall thickness to a value not significantly different from intact control animals.<br>
[0049] Immunohistochemistry revealed strong androgen receptor (AR) labeling in all DHEA-treated groups. On the other hand, estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) and progesterone receptor (PR) labeling were not detected in any of the Acolbifene-treated groups.<br>
[0050] In conclusion, treatment with DHEA or the combination of DHEA arid Acolbifene partially or completely prevents the OVX-induced atrophic changes observed in various layers of the vaginal wall through a predominant androgenic effect, as revealed by<br><br>
epithelial mucification and AR up-regulation. The present data also show particularly interesting effects of DHEA on the three layers of the vaginal wall, namely a highly mucified epithelium, an increased compactness of the collagen fibers in the lamina propria as well as an increase of the muscularis thickness. DHEA thus exerts both androgenic and estrogenic effects on the vaginal mucosa, thus providing a more physiological replacement therapy. While each of the examined compounds has potential beneficial effects on vaginal function, DHEA alone or in combination could well optimally relieve vaginal dryness and restore global vaginal physiology and help, correcting sexual dysfunction associated with menopause. DHEA and other components could be administered locally or systemically.<br>

EXAMPLE OF EFFICAY OF THE INVENTION Example 1<br>
MATERIALS AND METHODS<br>
Animals and treatments<br>
[0061] Ten to twelve week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats (Crl:CD®(SD)Br VAF/Plus™) (Charles River Laboratory, St-Constant, Canada) weighing approximately 220-270g at start of the experiment were used. The animals were acclimatized to the environmental conditions (temperature: 22 ± 3°C; humidity: 50 ± 20%; 12-h light-12-h dark cycles, lights on at 07:15h) for at least one week before starting the experiment. The animals were housed individually and were allowed free access to water and rodent food (Lab Diet 5002, Ralston Purina, St-Louis, MO). The experiment was conducted in accordance with the CCAC Guide for Care and Use of Experimental Animals in an animal facility approved by the<br>
Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) and the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC).<br>
[0062] A total of 126 female rats were randomly distributed into 9 groups of 14 animals each as follows: 1) Intact control; 2) Ovariectomized control (OVX); 3) OVX + Acolbifene (2.5 mg/kg); 4) OVX + Premarin (0.5 mg/kg); 5) OVX + Premarin + Acolbifene; 6) OVX + DHEA (80 mg/kg); 7) OVX + DHEA + Acolbifene; 8) OVX + DHEA + Premarin; 9) OVX + DHEA + Acolbifene + Premarin. On the first day of the study, the animals of all groups (except group one) were bilaterally ovariectomized (OVX) under isoflurane-induced anesthesia. Premarin and Acolbifene were administered by oral gavage (0.5 ml/rat) as suspensions in 0.4% methylcellulose while DHEA in 50% ethanol-50% propylene glycol (0.5 ml/rat), was topically applied on a shaved area of 2 x 2 cm of the dorsal skin. Dosage selection for Premarin corresponds to the minimal dose sufficient to reverse OVX-induced uterine atrophy, while Acolbifene was administered at a dose sufficient to cause uterine atrophy similar to OVX after its administration to Premarin-treated OVX animals. The dose of DHEA used gave DHEA blood levels at 70-100 nmol/L. Treatments were initiated on day 2 of the study and the compounds were administered once daily for 36 weeks. Animals from the intact arid OVX control groups received the vehicle alone.<br>
[0063] Twenty-four hours after the last dosing, overnight fasted animals were sacrificed under isofiurane anesthesia by exsanguination at the abdominal aorta (9 animals per group) or by intracardiac perfusion with 10% neutral buffered formalin (5 animals per group). Vaginae from non-perfused animals were collected and<br>
weighed, while the vaginae collected from perfused animals were marked with black ink on the ventral side, and then trimmed as described below.<br>
Histological procedures<br>
[0064] The entire vagina of each perfused animal was post-fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Each vagina was then divided into seven equal cross-segments as illustrated in Figure 1, routinely processed and embedded altogether in the same paraffin block. Within the paraffin block, the seven vaginal cylindrical segments were positioned in a sequence corresponding to their original anatomical position and oriented perpendicular to the surface of the block, thus allowing the segments to be cut in cross-sections. For each animal, a 4 urn-thick paraffin section was cut and stained with haematoxylin-eosin for morphological examination.<br>
Histomorphometry<br>
[0065] Measurements of the different vaginal layers were performed on the fifth segment (Fig.l), which is approximately halfway between the middle region and the portio vaginalis uteri (segment 7). This fifth segment was found to display a representative epithelial surface and a sufficient thickness of smooth muscle. Images were captured with a DC-330 3CCD color camera (Dage-MTI, Michigan City, IN, USA) and quantified using Image-Pro , Plus 3.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA). Thus, using a x5 objective (Leica Microsystems, Willowdale, Ont., Canada), 3 to 4 thickness measurements per layer were obtained from representative areas of the epithelium and muscularis, and for the three vaginal layers together. The total vaginal thickness, the thickness of the epithelium and the thickness of the muscularis were thus measured. The<br>
thickness of the lamina propria was obtained by subtracting the thickness of the epithelium and muscularis from total vaginal thickness,<br>
Immunohistochemistry<br>
[0066] Immunostaining was performed using Zymed SP kits (San Francisco, CA). Paraffin sections (4μm) were deparaffinized in toluene and rehydrated through ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase activity was eliminated by preihcubation with 3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min. A microwave retrieval technique using citrate buffer (Tacha and Chen, 1994) was applied. After cooling the slides, non specific binding was blocked using 10% goat serum for 20 min. Sections were then incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature with ERa (AB-1, Calbiochem, California), AR (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, California) or PR (Ab-4, NeoMarkers, California) antibodies, at 1:200, 1:250 and 1:250 respectively. After washing in PBS buffer, sections were incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 10 min and thereafter with streptavidin-peroxidase for another 10 min. Diaminobenzidine was used as the chromogen to visualize the biotin/streptavidin-peroxidase complex, under microscope monitoring. Counterstaining was performed using #2 Gill's hematoxylin for 30 sec. For controls, immunoabsorption with an excess of the peptide used to raise the antibody, or substitution with non immune rabbit IgG, was performed. Semiquantitative evaluation of the number and intensity of immunostained nuclei was performed as indicated in Table 2.<br>

 [0067] Data are presented as means ± SEM of 8-9 animals per group for vaginal weight or 5 animals per group for vaginal layer thickness determinations. Statistical significance was determined according to the multiple-range test of Duncan-Kramer (Kramer, 1956, Biometrics, 12: 307-310).<br>
RESULTS<br>
Morphology and thickness of the different layers of rat vagina<br>
[0068] To examine with precision and detail the three layers of the rat vaginal wall, namely the epithelium, lamina propria and muscularis, seven segments obtained along the longitudinal axis (Fig. 1) were first examined. While important morphological differences were observed between the groups, in general, the differences were uniform in all animals of the same group and segments 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 have shown a similar epithelial morphology. The few exceptions observed will be mentioned later. Segment 5 was thus used to illustrate the effect of the various treatments on the vaginal epithelium.<br>
[0069] In the OVX group, the absence of ovarian stimulation led to an atrophy of the vaginal epithelium which characterized all segments (Table 1 and Fig 2C) with the presence, of some small mucous cell areas. Most importantly, moderate to severe inflammation with many foci of intraepithelial riticroabcesses (small areas of agglomerated leucocytes within the epithelium) were a frequent finding These changes were frequently accompanied by focal erosion (zones where the epithelial layer partially disappears) and ulceration (complete disappearance of the epithelial layer) (Fig 3).<br>
 [0070] In OVX animals treated with Acolbifene, segment 1 showed a keratinized stratified squamous epithelium similar to that of the intact group, except that it included 9-11 cell layers compared to the 10-"15 layers found in animals at estrus or when OVX animals received Premarin (Fig 4). The epithelial thickness of Acolbifene-treated animals in segment 1 was thus higher than that of OVX rats, which comprised only 4-6 cell layers. In the other segments (Table 1), the basal layer was covered by a layer of low columnar mucous cells (Pig 2D), which were more developed than in OVX animals. In the OVX + Acolbifene group, only three out of five animals showed signs of minimal inflammation while moderate to severe inflammatory changes were general findings in all OVX animals.<br>
[0071] In all groups, segment 1 showed a comparable stratified squamous epithelium, except in the animals of the OVX group where atrophy was a predominant characteristic (Fig 4). Moreover, in the OVX + DHEA and OVX + DHEA + Acolbifene groups, mucous cells frequently accompanied the dominant stratified squamous epithelium of segment 1 (not shown).<br>
[0072] The seven segments of the vaginal epithelium of OVX animals which received DHEA were composed of large multilayered columnar mucous cells with distended cytoplasmic 'vacuoles, a feature typical of an androgenic effect (Table 1, Fig 2G). Several large imaginations characterized the epithelium after DHEA treatment. A similar epithelial morphology was found in all segments of the OVX + DHEA + Acolbifene group, except that the size of the mucous cells and the number of their layers were decreased (Table 1, Fig 2H). In<br>
the DHEA + PREMARIN-treated animals, a thick stratified epithelium of a "mixed" type composed of different ratios of squamous epithelium covered by layers of mucous cells (Table 1, Fig 21) was observed from the second to the fifth segment, thus revealing combined estrogenic and androgenic effects. In this group, three animals displayed mucification over the above-mentioned segments, while in the other two animals, a stratified squamous epithelium was observed in all segments (Table 1). When PREMARIN was combined with DHEA and Acolbifene, the epithelium was similar to that of the DHEA + Acolbifene group, thus indicating a blockade of the estrogen-induced squamous cell proliferation by Acolbifene (Table 1 and Fig 2J),<br>
[0073] The administration of DHEA to OVX animals increased thickness of the vaginal epithelium to 38 ± 4 um, while the addition of Acolbifene to DHEA did not change the epithelial thickness which remained at 37 ± 5 um. When Premarin and DHEA were coad ministered to OVX animals, a high thickness of 84 ± 6 um was observed, a value not significantly different from that of the group of animals which received Premarin alone. Finally, the combination of Premarin, DHEA and Acolbifene resulted in an epithelium of 32 ± 3 urn-thick, a value similar to that of the groups which received DHEA alone or DHEA combined with Acolbifene.<br>
Lamina propria<br>
[0074] The degree of compactness of collagen fibers in the vagina was categorized as low, moderate and high (Fig. 6), as observed in the area proximal to the epithelium. «Low» and «moderate compactness" were associated with the presence of coarse collagen<br>
libers loosely or less loosely aggregated together, respectively, while «high compactness)) was the term used to describe tightly packed line collagen fibers, displaying a smooth, textured appearance. In all the animals, there were relatively few fibrocytes in proportion to the amount of collagen, and they appeared predominantly flattened and shrunken.<br>
[0075] Careful examination of each animal (Table 1) reveals that, in general, the compactness of the collagen fibers in segment 1 is moderate (except low in rats at estrus and in Premarin-treated OVX animals, or high in OVX and DHEA-treated OVX rats), while increasing in compactness in segments 2 and 3 to reach a plateau that generally remains constant until segment 7. Thus, along the longitudinal axis of the vagina in intact rats at estrus, compactness of the collagen fibers was low in segments 1 to 3 and moderate in segments 4 to 7. Atrophy was often associated with increased compactness of collagen fibers in the OVX and OVX + Acolbifene groups (Table 1). In Premarin-treated OVX animals, compactness in segment 1 was low and moderate in segments 2 and 3, while in the other segments, compactness of the collagen fibers increased gradually to become high in segments 6 and 7.<br>
[0076] Visual light microscope examination of the lamina propria thickness along the vagina generally revealed that is was moderately thick in segment 1 while thinner in segments 2 to 4. In segments 5 to 7, the thickness increased progressively to a level similar to segment 1. The corresponding mean values of lamina propria thickness measured in segment 5 (Fig SB) indicate that OVX led to a significant decrease in lamina propria thickness (76 ± 2 um versus 135 ± 28 urn in<br>
the intact group) with a non significant decrease induced by Acolbifene (60 ± 8 (am). The increase observed after Premarin or Premarin + Acolbifene administration in OVX animals remained below the intact group (100 ± 9 um and 90 ± 3 um, respectively versus 135 ± 28 um). The administration of DHEA led also to a statistically non significant increase in lamina propria thickness (96 ± 20 um), and the addition of Acolbifene led to further increased thickness (136 ± 17 μm), reaching that of intact animals. Treatment of OVX animals with Premarin + DHEA significantly increased the thickness, (144 ± 14 um) when compared to DHEA alone. Finally, the animals treated with Premarin + DHEA + Acolbifene displayed a thickness (99 ± 9 um) similar to that of the group treated with DHEA alone, and lower than that of the Premarin + DHEA group, although the difference was not statistically significant.<br>
[0077] DHEA induced a moderate increase in muscularis thickness (50 ± 2 um), which was slightly decreased by the addition of Acolbifene (41 ± 3 urn). Finally, treatment with Premarin and DHEA combined resulted in a notable thickness increase (62 ± 3 um), when compared to animals treated with DHEA alone. When Acolbifene was added to Premarin and DHEA, muscularis thickness decreased (46 ± 5 ug) to a value comparable to DHEA and Acolbifene.<br>
[0078] When total vaginal wall thickness was measured (Fig 5D), the outer thin layer of connective tissue composing the adventitia was not included. OVX led to a marked (51%) vaginal wall atrophy (128 ± 3 um, versus 262 ± 39 um in the intact) and the addition of Acolbifene to OVX had no effect (108 ± 8 um) (Fig 7 A, B and C). Premarui treatment maintained the total thickness to a value (253 ±<br>
10 um) similar to that of intact animals while the addition of Acolbifene to Premarin reversed the effect of Premarin (150 ± 4 μm) (Fig 7D and E, respectively). Total vaginal thickness achieved by DHEA treatment (184 ± 21 urn) was about 25% lower than that of the Premarin alone-treated group (Fig 7F). On the other hand, the addition of Acolbifene to DHEA led to a non significant thickness increase (213 ± 20 μm), which became non significantly different from the intact group (Fig 7G). Finally, coadministration of Premarin and DHEA to OVX animals markedly increased the thickness (290 ± 13 um) to a value similar to that of intact animals (Fig 7H). The addition of Acolbifene to DHEA and Premarin reversed the effect to a value (176 ±11 μm) not significatively different from DHEA alone (Fig 71).<br>
Vaginal weight<br>
[0079] After eight months of treatment, the changes observed in vaginal weight between the different groups (Fig 8) generally follow the above-described morphological observations. Indeed, vaginal weight after OVX decreased by about 50% (101 ± 5 mg) compared to the intact group (205 ± 11 mg) while treatment of OVX animals with Acolbifene alone had no effect on vaginal weight. On the other hand, administration of Premarin led to a vaginal weight increase that did not yet reach the value of intact animals (170 ± 9 mg) while the addition of Acolbifene to Premarin reversed the estrogen-induced weight gain to a value similar to that of OVX animals (96 ± 4 mg). Conversely, when DHEA was given to OVX animals, vaginal weight increased to a value (171 ± 12 mg), similar to that of the Premarin-treated group, and the combination of Acolbifene and DHEA resulted in a decrease in weight (135 ± 9 mg), which remained above that of the OVX group. Finally, coadministration of Premarin and DHEA in OVX animals resulted in a vaginal.weight gain (179 ± 10 mg) reaching a value similar to those of the OVX + DHEA and OVX + Premarin groups. The addition of Acolbifene to this combination had no significant effect (194 ± 12 mg).<br>
[0080] DHEA treatment of OVX animals led to the strong labeling or AR of many nuclei in the three vaginal layers, the same pattern being found when the combinations of DHEA + Acolbifene and DHEA + Premarin were used, with the exception of a smaller number of labeled nuclei in the superficial layers of the epithelium in the latter group. The combination of DHEA, Premarin and Acolbifene also resulted in a strong staining of the majority of the nuclei in the three vaginal wall layers.<br>
DISCUSSION<br>
[0081] Vaginal dryness or atrophic vaginitis, also referred to as urogenital atrophy, with sexual dysfunction is a common problem in postmenopausal women (Notelovitz, 2000, Menopause, 7(3): 140-142). The most common symptoms are dryness, burning, pruritus, irritation and dyspareunia, thus leading to decreased libido and quality of life (Berman et al., 1999, Curr Opin Urol, 9(6): 563-568). Since estrogen loss is known to be involved, estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) and HRT are the treatments of choice. However, as new information on sex steroid physiology in women strongly suggests an important role of androgens (Labrie et al., 2003, End Rev, 24(2): 152-182), the present study compares the overall hormonal effects of an alternative to HRT or ERT, namely DHEA alone or in association with the pure antiestrogen Acolbifene and also with Premarin on rat vaginal morphology and sex steroid receptor expression, DHEA was administered percutaneously to avoid first pass through the liver (Labrie et al., 1996, Endocrinol, 150: S107-S118).<br>
[0082] Finally, our results have shown a significant vaginal weight increase with Premarin treatment, when compared to OVX animals, the value being similar to that observed in DHEA-treated group. It is appropriate to recall that, although vaginal and uterine weigh I increases in rodents are commonly used as measures of estrogenicity, these organs can also respond to progesterone and testosterone, among other compounds (Emmens and Martin, 1964, Dorfman Ed, Ed Academic Press NY: 1).<br>
 [0083] In the potential triple combination, the equine estrogen Fremarin is aimed at acting in the brain to relieve the vasomotor symptoms. In fact, the benefits of co-administration of the pure selective antiestrogen Acolbifene with an estrogen in order to neutralize the unwanted peripheral effects of the estrogen have been well described by Labrie et al. (Labrie et al., 2003, Endocrinol, 144 (11); 4700-4706). In the present study, when Acolbifene was given to OVX animals, the most typical morphological feature induced by the SERM was the appearance of a superficial layer of well-aligned small mucus cells overlying a basal cell layer, a pattern which was slightly more pronounced in the Premarin + Acolbifene group and which remained preponderant in all .groups treated with Acolbifene, including when the SERM was added to DHEA. Vaginal epithelium mucification under treatment with an antiestrogen has been reported in immature (Anderson and Kang, 1975, Am J anat, 144(2): 197-207) and adult (Yoshida et al., 1998, Cancer Lett, 134(1): 43-51) rats. Although this morphological pattern has been compared to the<br><br>
progesterone-induced mucification (Anderson and Kang, 1975, Am J anat, 144(2): 197-207), the molecular mechanism by which an antiestrogen induces epithelial mucification remains unknown.<br>
[0084] Many beneficial effects of DHEA have been reported in postmenopausal women (Labrie et al., 1997, J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., 82: 3498-3505; Labrie et al., 1991, Mol Cell Endocrinol, 78: C113-C118). Since no specific receptor for DHEA has been characterized, the morphological changes observed in the rat vagina after DHEA treatment reflect its intracrine conversion into active sex steroids having androgenic and/or estrogenic action through intracrine mechanisms (Labrie et al., 1991, Mol Cell Endocrinol, 78: C113-C118), Those changes comprise intense epithelial mucification, high compactness of delicate, finely woven lamina propria collagen<br><br>
fibers and moderate muscularis thickness increase when compared to OVX animals. The two first morphological changes are typical of androgenic effects while the third shows an estrogen-like activity, which is further supported by a concomitant increase in progesterone receptor expression in the muscularis layer.<br>
[0085] Since DHEA is transformed into either or both androgens and estrogens in peripheral tissues, the thick mucified multilayered epithelium observed in the present study after treatment of OVX animals with DHEA, suggests a predominant androgenic effect of mucification in the rat vagina, an effect which could mask any potential coexisting minor estrogenic effect at the epithelial level. A previous study has shown the same mucification effect in the rat vagina (Sourla et al., 1998, J Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol., 66(3): 137-149); In that previous study, the intravaginal application of DHEA achieved a significant effect at a dose ten times lower than that found to be active following application of DHEA on the dorsal skin.<br>
[0086] The present data indicate co-existing major androgenic and minor estrogenic actions of DHEA in the rat vagina. Moreover, the present results are well supported by the observation of the vaginal epithelium of OVX animals which received the same topical application of DHEA than that used in our study, plus a subcutaneous dose of the antiandrogen Flutamide (FLU) (unpublished results). Indeed, the androgenic effect of mucification produced by the androgenic component of DHEA was completely reversed by FLU and resulted in a stratified squamous epithelium, typical of an estrogenic effect (data not shown). If DHEA would have an exclusive androgenic effect (mucification) in the rat vagina, this effect would be reversed by FLU and an atrophic epithelium similar to that of OVX animals should then be observed. Previous<br>
studies in gonadectomized 'male and female rats have clearly established that treatment with DHEA leads to stimulatory androgenic and/or estrogenic effects on the prostate, seminal vesicle and uterus, depending upon the target tissue under investigation (Labrie et al., 1988, Endocrinol, 123:1412-1417).<br>
[0087] The combination of DHEA + Acolbifene, on the other hand, shows a reduction in the extent of epithelial mucification, thus displaying the alternance of a well-aligned mucus cell layer - an Acolbifene effect - and imaginations of multilayered hypertrophied mucous cells, which correspond to the androgenic effect of DHEA. Accordingly, Acolbifene inhibits the partial estrogenic effect of DHEA, while the major androgenic counterpart of DHEA is maintained and a small estrogen-like effect of Acolbifene is added, the latter being best seen at the ostium level. The vaginal weight decrease observed after the addition of Acolbifene to DHEA is smaller than that obtained after addition of Acolbifene to Premarin, thus illustrating the smaller estrogenic component of DHEA which is reversed by the antiestrogen, while the major androgenic component is not affected. In addition, the increases in lamina propria thickness and in compactness of the collagen fibers, when compared to those of OVX and intact animals respectively, in the DHEA + Acolbifene group, suggest, again, a potential role of androgens in increasing collagen compactness and thickness, since the estrogenic component of DHEA is blocked by Acolbifene.<br>
[0088] Other studies have demonstrated that the action of DHEA in the rat mammary gland (Sourla et al., 1998, Endocrinol, 139: 753-764), skin sebaceous glands (Sourla et al., 2000, J Endocrinol, 166(2): 455-462) and bone mineral density (Martel et al., 1998, J Endocrinol, 157: 433-442) is almost exclusively androgenic. Nevertheless, the<br>
presence of an estrogenic action of DHEA in the rat vagina has been previously demonstrated through induction of vaginal opening and precocious ovulation in immature rats treated with this compound, while DHT, an androgen not aromatizable to estrogens, did not produce such effects (Knudsen and Mahesh, 1975, Endocrinol, 97(2): 458-468). The capacity of rat vaginal tissue to aromatize androgens, especially Testo, is likely to account for the major part of the estrogenic effect of DHEA in this organ (Lephart et al., 1989, Biol Reprod, 40(2): 259-267). Androst-5-ene-3p, 17p-diol (5-diol), a DHEA metabolite known to bind the estrogen receptor (Shao et al., 1950, J Biol Chem, 250: 3095-3100; Poortman et al., 1975, J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 40(3): 373-379; Van Doom et al., 1981, Endocrinol, 108: 1587-1594; Adams et al., 1981, Cancer Res, 41: 4720-4726), could also contribute to the estrogenic effect (Poulin and Labrie, 1986, Cancer Res, 46: 4933-4937). The proposed combination of the antiestrogen Acolbifene with DHEA would thus prevent any unwanted stimulatory effect of 5-diol. On the other hand, acolbifene would show additional benefits by preventing bone loss (Martel et al., 2000, J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol, 74 (1-2): 45-56).<br>
[0089] To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has shown the stimulatory effects of DHEA on the compactness and morphology of the lamina propria's collagen fibers and, to a lesser extent, on the muscularis. Such actions of DHEA-derived androgens and estrogens could have beneficial effects on vaginal function in poslmenopausal women and should provide the substrates required for the action of inhibitors of type 5 phosphodiesterase such as sildenafil or tadalafil, possibly via androgen or estrogen-induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-mediated facilitation of vaginal smooth muscle relaxation (reviewed in Munarriz et al., 2003, ] Urol, 170 (2 Pt 2): S40-S44, Discussion S44-S45). In fact, Acolbifene<br>
has been found to induce eNOS in human and rat endothelial cells (Simoncim et al., 2002, Endocrinol, 143(6): 2052-2061).<br>
[0090J The results obtained in all the groups involving DHEA treatment reveal that AR expression is up-regulated by the androgens derived from the inrracrine transformation of DHEA in the rat vagina, in a similar fashion in the three tissue compartments.<br>
[0091] The beneficial morphological changes, observed coacomitantly with the strong modulation of rat vaginal AR by undrogens, suggest that decreased serum levels of DHEA-derived androgens in postmenopausal women could contribute to the decreased vaginal health and eventually to the loss of libido and sexual enjoyment observed in this age group. Decreased serum total Testo, free Testo and DHEA-S were indeed found in women who consulted for decreased sexual desire (Guay and Jacobson, 2002, J Sex Marital Ther, 28 Suppl 1:129-142).<br>
[0092] In the present study, we have shown that treatment of OVX female rats with DHEA or the combinahon of DHEA with Acolbifene and of DHEA with Acolbifene and Premarin reversed the OVX-induced atrophic changes found in the vagina through a predominant androgenic effect, via AR, which was reflected by intense epithelial mucification and increased compactness of the collagen fibers in the lamina propria. Treatment with DHEA alone also moderately increased muscularis thickness. Such data underline the importance of sex steroids synthesized locally from DHEA and DHEA-S in peripheral target tissues. In addition to these beneficial effects, Acolbifene reduced the inflammation incidence, possibly through an estrogen-like induction of a protective keratinized<br>
squamous epithelium at the ostiurn level and an antiestrogenic effect of mucification at the internal level.<br>
[0093] Various attempts have been made to solve the problem of vaginal dryness, often linked to dyspareunia and loss of sexual enjoyment. As an example, local vaginal estrogen preparations are often prescribed to provide relief but the endometrium may be stimulated by the unopposed estrogen (Mattson et al., 1989, Maturitas, 11: 217-222). In hysterectomized postmenopausal women, ERT is still used but with the well-known increased risk of developing breast cancer. Moreover, ERT decreases serum androgen levels by increasing sex hormone binding globulin, which may induce a relative ovarian and adrenal androgen deficiency, thus creating an additional rationale for concurrent physiologic androgen replacement (Casson et al., 1997, Obstet Gynecol, 90(6): 995-998).<br>

METHODS<br>
Animals and treatment<br>
[0094]Ten to twelve week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats (Crl:CD(SD)Br) (Charles River Laboratory, St-Constant, Canada) weighing 215-265 g at time of ovariectomy were used. The animals were housed individually in an environmentally-controlled room (temperature: 22 ± 3°C; humidity: 50 ± 20%; 12-h light-12-h dark cycles,' lights on at 07:15h). The animals were allowed free access to tap water and a certified rodent feed (Lab Diet 5002 (pellet), Ralston Purina, St-Louis, MO). The experiment was conducted in an animal facility approved by the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) and the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) in accordance with the CCAC Guide for Cure and Use of Experimental Animals.<br>
 [0095)Different experiments were performed: two 20-day and two 8-month studies. In each of the two first experiments, the animals were randomly distributed between 3 groups of 13 or 14 animals as follows: 1) Intact control; 2) Ovariectomized (OVX) control; 3) OVX + raloxifene (0.5 mg/kg), or, 3) OVX + LY 363381 (0,5 mg/kg). In one 8-month study, the animals were randomly distributed between 5 groups of 7-8 animals as follows: 1) Intact control; 2) Ovariectomized (OVX) control; 3) OVX + Acolbifene (0.5 mg/kg); 4) OVX + ERA-923 (0.5 mg/kg); 5) OVX + TSE-424 (0.5 mg/kg). In the other 8-month study, the animals were randomly distributed between 3 groups of 10-11 animals as follows: 1) Intact control; 2) Ovariectomized (OVX) control; 3) OVX + lasofoxifene (0.5 mg/kg). On the first day of the study, the animals of the appropriate groups were bilaterally Ovariectomized (OVX) under isoflurane anesthesia. The tested compounds were then given once daily by oral gavage as a suspension in 0.4% methylcellulose (0.5 ml/rat) from day 1 to day 20 of the study or from day 1 to week 32 of the study.<br>
[0096] Twenty-four hours after the last dosing, the animals were sacrificed under isoflurane anesthesia by exsanguination. The vaginae were collected and immersed in 10% neutral buffered formalin immediately after resection. The vaginae were then either cut in 7 cross-segments (for Acolbifene, ERA-923 and TSE-424) or cut to sample only the middle cross-segment, (raloxifene, lasofoxifene or LY 363381), The segments were then routinely processed and embedded in paraffin blocks. When appropriate, all the segments were positioned in the paraffin block in a sequence corresponding to their original anatomical position and oriented perpendicular to the surface of the block, thus allowing the segments to be cut in cross-<br>
sections.  For each animal, a 4 um-thick paraffin section was cut and stained with haematoxyJin-eosin for morphological examination.<br>
[0097] In figures 10 and 11 is shown a comparison between different SERMs: vaginal epithelium morphology, in the OVX rat, at magnification 200X. Pictures A to D show the epithelial morphology of the first segment of the vagina (ostium). While the epithelium of the OVX animals is thin (4-6 cell layers), atrophic and does not display a visible granular layer in A, the same epithelium is thicker' in the 3 SERMs (8-11 cell layers) and displays a multilayered granular compartment, in B,C and D. In E to K, a segment situated in the middle of the vagina is illustrated. In the OVX animals, the vaginal epithelium is thin and atrophic (2-3 cell layers), in E, while the thickness is increased in all the treated groups (F to K), due to the presence of one (Acolbifene, ERA-923 and TSE-424) or many (raloxifene, lasofoxifene or LY 363381) mucous cell layer(s) overlying the basal cell layer.<br>
Example 3 MATERIALS AND METHODS<br>
[0098]	Ten to twelve week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats<br>
(Crl:CD®(SD)Br VAF/Plus™) (Charles River Laboratory, St-Constant, Canada) weighing approximately 250-275g at start of the experiment were used. The animals were acclimatized to the environmental conditions (temperature: 22 ± 3°C; humidity: 50 ± 20%; 12-h light-12-h dark cycles, lights on at 07:15h) for at least one week before starting the experiment. The animals were housed individually arid were allowed free access to water and rodent food (Lab Diet 5002, Ralston Purina, St-Louis, MO). The experiment was conducted in accordance with the CCAC Guide for Care and Use of<br>
Experimental Animals in an animal facility approved by the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) and the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC).<br>
[0099]	A total of 25 female rats were randomly distributed into<br>
5 groups as follows: 1) Three ovariectomized untouched control<br>
(OVX); 2) Four OVX + placebo suppository; 3) Six OVX + 0.33 rng<br>
DHEA suppository; 4) Six OVX + 0.66 mg DHEA suppository; 5) Six<br>
OVX + 1.00 mg DHEA suppository. On the first day of the study, the<br>
animals of all groups were bilaterally ovariectomized (OVX) under<br>
isoflurane-induced anesthesia. The insertion into the vagina of one<br>
suppository began on day 5 of the study and was continued once<br>
daily until day 18 of the study, for a total of 14 days of treatment. The<br>
suppository was gently placed in the vaginal opening and then<br>
delicately pushed about 2-3 mm inside the vagina with the help of a<br>
small, smooth glass stick, disinfected in 70% alcohol and dried<br>
between each animal.	<br>
[0100]	Twenty-four hours after the last ^dosing, the animals<br>
were sacrificed under isoflurane anesthesia by exsanguination. Vagina -including the urethra- and uterus were collected, and then trimmed as described below. For further analysis, two pieces of inguinal mammary gland were sampled, as well as a square piece of about 2X2 cm of shaved dorsal skin, the latter being put and gently flattened on a piece of carton.<br>
Preparation of the suppositories<br>
[0101]	DHEA suppositories were prepared using Whitepsol<br>
H-15 base (Medisca, Montreal, Canada). Any other lipophilic base such as Fattibase, Wecobee, cocoa butter, theobroma oil or other combinations of Whitepsol bases could also be used. The proper<br>
amounts of DHEA were weighed to give final concentrations of 0.33 mg or 0.66 mg or 1.00 mg per suppository of a final volume of 50 μ1 ± 3 μl. The proper amount of suppository base pellets to weight in order to obtain the final volume needed was calculated based on the previously measured density of the suppository base, which was 47.5 mg per 50 μl. The suppository base was put in a small beaker, melted in microwave at power 50% for about 3 min and 30 sec and then transferred on a heating plate, which was adjusted at the lowest power in order to keep the suppository base at a temperature of 50 ± 30C. The DHEA micronized powder (obtained from Scheweizerhall Inc. at a purity of 100%) was then added in the base, all at once, the whole clump left to sink and to wet for 3 min before being meticulously and slowly crushed and dissolved with a smooth rounded-end glass rod. Finally, the base with the dissolved DHEA (the placebo was the base without DHEA) was poured, using a 1000 μl-Gilson pipette with a pre-heated pipette tip, in tube racks containing a series of 50 μl-moulds. These moulds were made from microcemrifuge tubes, each of them previously calibrated with 50 μ1 of water and cut at the level of the line drawn at the water surface. After 30 min of cooling at room temperature, the suppositories were put at 40C for another 30 min. Finally, the excess of base was trimmed with a razor blade and the suppositories were removed from their moulds and stored in closed glass bottles at 4°C until use. They were allowed to reach room temperature before being applied to die animals. Histological procedures<br>
[01021	The organs were immersed in 10% neutral buffered<br>
formalin immediately after resection. Each vagina and uterus was divided into 8 equal cross-segments and 4 cross-segments including two from the cervix and two from each of the two proximal and<br><br>
distal horns, respectively. The segments were then routinely processed and embedded all together in the same paraffin block. Within the paraffin block, all the segments were positioned in a sequence corresponding to their original anatomical position and oriented perpendicular to the surface of the block, thus allowing the segments to be cut in cross-sections. For each animal, a 4 um-thick paraffin section was cut and stained with haematoxylin-eosin for morphological examination. RESULTS<br>
Morphology of the epithelium<br>
[0103]	After examination of all vaginal segments, it was found<br>
that segments 4 and 6 are representative to compare between treatments. Segment 4 was the most proximal to the ostium which did not display features of the external skin, and was not or to a lesser extent affected by the slight to moderate inflammatory changes usually found in the external area of the vaginal mucosa in control animals. Segment 6 represented the deeper vaginal mucosa and is separated from the uterine cervix by only one segment. In general, the ventral side of the vagina displays a thicker and a more mucified epithelium when compared to the dorsal side.<br>
INTACT<br>
[0104]	As shown in figure 13, at estrus, which is under major<br>
estrogeruc influence, the vaginal epithelium is thick and keratinized. It displays from 12 to 18 cell layers in segment 4, and 12 to 15 layers in segment 6. Contrary to the thick stratified squamous epithelium seen at the ostium, the granular layers are not obvious in the internal vaginal epithelium. At metestrus, under minimal hormonal influence, the vaginal epithelium is thinner. It displays 6 to 10 cell layers in segment 4, and 5 to 7 layers in segment 6. OVARIECTOMIZED UNTOUCHED<br>
 [0105J	As shown in figure 14, in segment 4, the vagina is lined<br>
by a squamous stratified epithelium of 2 to 6 cell layers. The thickness of this segment is quite variable between animals. In segment 6, complete atrophy is observed, with 2 to 3 cell layers of flat cells. Some rare foci of small cylindrical mucous cells could be seen throughout the whole vagina of these animals. Of the three animals of this group, two displayed mild inflammatory changes in the external three segments. PLACEBO<br>
[0106J	As shown in figure 15, in comparison with the OVX<br>
untouched group, the vaginal squamous stratified epithelium of the placebo group was slightly thicker, with segment 4 displaying 4 to 8 cell layers. However, in segment 6, the same morphology found in the OVX untouched group was observed, with 2-3 epithelial cell layers. As in OVX untouched animals, foci of small cylindrical mucous cells could be found throughout the vagina, slightly more when compared with the OVX untouched animals. Of the four animals of this group, three displayed mild inflammatory changes in the external three segments. DHEA 0.33 mg / suppository<br>
[0107]	As shown in figure 16, in general, at low doses, the<br>
morphological effect of DHEA is characterized by well-aligned cylindrical mucous cells, while at higher doses, the mucous cells enlarge (hypertrophy), vacuolate and pile up. In the present group, the effect of DHEA is slightly discernible in segment 2 and gradually increases in segments 3-4, where there is 'an alternance of well-aligned and hypertrophied mucous cells. The DHEA effect slowly decreases in segments 5 and 6 where almost only well-aligned mucous cells can be observed. The effect becomes very little in segment 7 and disappears in the lateral vaginal folds of segment 8 (which includes the beginning of the cervix). Thus, in segment 4, the<br>
vaginal epithelium is stratified squamous with 3 to 7 cell layers. About 20 to 60% of the vaginal lining consists of well-aligned mucous cells in alternance with 15 to 50% hypertrophied mucous cells, overlying one or more squamous stratified epithelium layers, and with non-mucified areas. In segment 6, the epithelial thickness is reduced to almost the thickness found in OVX untouched animals. It consists of a squamous stratified epithelium of 2 to 5 cell layers, covered by a layer of well-aligned mucous cells. A large variation in the occurrence of mucous cells was observed, these cells covering from 5 to 75% of the vaginal surface, in alternance with non-mucified areas. Of the six. treated animals, four of them displayed mild inflammation, unevenly distributed over the whole vagina. DHEA 0.66 mg / suppository<br>
[0108]	As shown in figure 17, in this group, the effect of DHEA<br>
is discernible in segment 2 and increases significatively in segments 3-4 and 5 where a majority of hypertrophied mucous cells are observed. The number of hypertrophied mucous cells decreases in segments 6 and 7 where the majority of cells are well-aligned mucous cells. Thus, in segment 4, the stratified squamous epithelium is 3 to 6 cell layer-thick. About 5 to 20% of the vaginal lining consists of well-aligned mucous cells in alternance with 10 to 75% of hypertrophied mucous cells, overlying one or more squamous stratified epithelium layers. Non-mucified epithelial areas are also present. In segment 6, the epithelial thickness is reduced and consists of a squamous stratified epithelium of 2 to 4 cell layers, surmounted by a layer of well-aligned mucous cells. The amount of mucified areas varied from 20 to 80% of the vaginal surface, in alternance with non-mucified areas. Of the six treated animals, two displayed mild inflammation in the three external segments. DHEA 1.00 mg / suppository<br>
 [0109]	As shown in figure 18, In this group, the effect of<br>
DHEA is also discernible in segment 2, but it increases significatively in segments 3-4 and 5 where the vast majority of hypertrophied mucous cells are observed, and very slowly decreases in segments 6-7 and 8, where the vast majority of well-aligned mucous cells are observed. Thus, in segment 4, the stratified squamous epithelium displays 3 to 9 cell layers. Hypertrophied mucous cells overlying 3 to 4 squamous cell layers cover 50 to 70% of the vaginal surface, while well-aligned mucous cells cover 5 to 30% of the vaginal surface. Non-mucified areas are interspersed between mucified cells. In segment 6, the epithelial thickness is also reduced and consists of 2 to 4 cell layers. Hypertrophied mucous cells overlying 1 to 3 squamous cell layers cover about 30 to 100% of the vaginal surface while well-aligned mucous cells cover 0 to 70%. Few interspersed non-mucified areas are also observed. Of the six treated animals, four of them displayed mild inflammation in the four external segments..<br>
CONCLUSIONS<br>
