				<td>Antibody molecµLes having specificity for human IL-6<br>
The present invention relates to antibody molecµLes having specificity for antigenic detenninants of IL-6. The present invention also relates to the therapeutic uses of the antibody molecµLes and methods for producing the antibody molecµLes.<br>
IL-6 is a pleiotropic mµLti-functional cytokine produced by a variety of cell types. It was originally identified as a B-cell differentiation factor (BSF-2) that induced the final maturation of B-cells into antibody producing cells (Hirano et al, 1986 Nature 324, 73-76). IL-6 has been shown to play a central role in immune regµLation, inflammation, heamatopoiesis and oncogenesis. Within the immune system, IL-6 induces B-cell antibody production increasing the amount of polyclonal immunoglobµLin. It also induces interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor expression on T-cells (Nomo et al, 1987, Immunol, letters, 15, 3, 249-253) and promotes IL-2 production in activated T-cells thereby inducing both the growth and the differentiation of cytototoxic T-cells (Okada et al, 1988 J Immunol, 141, 5, 1543-1549). IL-6 is also known to determine the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages (ChomaratP et al, 2000 Nature Immunol.,6, 510-514).<br>
The function of IL-6 is not restricted to the immune response as it acts in hematopoiesis, thrombopoiesis, osteoclast formation, elicitation of hepatic acute phase response resµLting in the elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) protein. It is known to be a growth factor for epidermal keratinocytes, renal mesangial cells, myeloma and plasmacytoma cells (Grossman et al, 1989 Prot Natl Acad Sci., 86, (16) 6367-6371;Horiie at al., 1989, J Immunol, 143,12, 3949-3955; Kawano et al, 1988, Nature 332, 6159, 83-85). IL-6 is produced by a wide range of cell types including monocytes/ macrophages, fibroblasts, epidermal keratinocytes, vascµLar endothelial cells, renal messangial cells, glial cells, condrocytes, T and B-cells and some tumour cells (Akira et al, 1990, FASEB J., 4, 11, 2860-2867). Except for tumour cells that constitutively produce IL-6, normal cells do not express IL-6 unless appropriately stimµLated.<br>
IL-6 is a glycoprotein, a 184 amino acid molecµLe with a molecµLar weight of 21 to 28 kD depending on posttranslational modifications. Alternate splice variants are found in some cell types (Kishimoto et al, 1995, Blood, 86, 4,1243-1254). The IL-6 receptor (TL-6R) complex is comprised of two functionally different membrane proteins, an 80kD IL-6 specific binding chain (gp80) and a 130kD signal transduction chain (gpl30). Although IL-6 cannot<br>
directly bind gp 130, it can bind to IL-6R to generate a high-affinity ternary complex of IL-6/IL-6R/ gpl30. The IL-6R binds IL-6 with low affinity, however, IL-6R does not have an intracellµLar signal transduction domain therefore this ligation alone does not lead to cellµLar activation. Similarly, cell surface expression of IL-6R does not mean the cell is responsive to IL-6 stimµLation. Proteolytic cleavage leads to the release of soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R; sgp80) which can bind circµLating IL-6 and increase the half-life of IL-6. For cellµLar activation, IL-6 first binds to either cell bound IL-6R or sIL-6R; the heterodimeric IL-6/IL-6R complex then associates with cell surface glycoprotein gpl30. The resµLting tripartite heterocomplex binds another rL-6/IL-6R/gpl30 and signal transduction ensues (Bravo and Heath 2000, EMBO J., 19, (11), 2399-2411; BoµLanger et al, 2003, Science, 300, 5628, 2101-2104), hence both cell-bound and soluble IL-6R contribute to cellµLar activation. IL-6 signaling through cell bound IL-6R has been termed cis signaling whilst cellµLar activation via soluble IL-6R has been described as trans signaling. Cells expressing gpl30 but not IL-6R can be stimµLated by IL-6 through sIL-6R.<br>
Neutralising murine antibodies to human IL-6 are known to be able to interfere with the binding of human IL-6 to the IL-6R (site 1) or to gpl30 (sites 2 and 3) (Kalai et al, 1997, Eur.J.Biochem.249, 690-700; Brakenhoff et al, 1990, Journal of Immunology, 145, 561-568; Wendling et al, 1993, Journal of Rheumatology, 29, 259-262).<br>
US patent 5,856,135 discloses reshaped human antibodies to human IL-6 which block IL-6 binding to IL-6R. These antibodies were derived from a mouse monoclonal antibody SK2 in which the complementarity determining regions (CDR's) from the variable region of the mouse antibody SK2 are transplanted into the variable regions of a human antibody.<br>
Also known are neutralising human auto-antibodies to IL-6 (Hansen et al, Eur. J. Immunol, 1995, 25, 348-354).<br>
A site I chimeric murine/human anti-IL-6 antibody was described in WO2004039826 for use in therapy.<br>
A humanised anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody is in phase in clinical trials for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (Kishimoto, 2005, Annu Rev Immunol. 23:1-21).   It has also been reported that the same antibody is efficacious in a phase II study of Crohn's disease. Efficacy has also been demonstrated with both anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-6R antibodies in lupus-like disease in NZB/W F1 mice (Fink et al, 1994 J. Clin. Invest. 94, 585; Mihara et al, 1998, Clin. Exp. Immunol. 112, 397). A neutralizing antibody to the murine IL-6 receptor suppressed colitis in an adoptive transfer model of disease (Yamamoto et al, 2000<br>
 Journal of Immunology, 164, 4878; Atreya et al, 2000 Nature Med 6, 583). The latter study also demonstrated efficacy with an anti-receptor antibody in the IL-10 knock-out mouse model of colitis and in the TNBS model of gut inflammation<br>
We have now identified a high affinity neutralising anti-IL-6 antibody that is particµLarly efficacious in vivo, for example in the in vivo model described herein.<br>
The residues in antibody variable domains are conventionally numbered according to a system devised by Kabat et al. This system is set forth in Kabat et al, 1987, in Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, US Department of Health and Human Services, NTH, USA (hereafter "Kabat et al. (supra)"). This numbering system is used in the present specification except where otherwise indicated.<br>
The Kabat residue designations do not always correspond directly with the linear numbering of the amino acid residues. The actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids than in the strict Kabat numbering corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a structural component, whether framework or complementarity determining region (CDR), of the basic variable domain structure. The correct Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment of residues of homology in the sequence of the antibody with a "standard" Kabat numbered sequence.<br>
The CDRs of the heavy chain variable domain are located at residues 31-35 (CDR-Hl), residues 50-65 (CDR-H2) and residues 95-102 (CDR-H3) according to the Kabat numbering system. However, according to Chothia (Chothia, C. and Lesk, A.M. J. Mol. Biol., 196, 901-917 (1987)), the loop equivalent to CDR-H1 extends from residue 26 to residue 32. Thus 'CDR-H1', as used herein, comprises residues 26 to 35, as described by a combination of the Kabat numbering system and Chothia's topological loop definition.<br>
The CDRs of the light chain variable domain are located at residues 24-34 (CDR-L1), residues 50-56 (CDR-L2) and residues 89-97 (CDR-L3) according to the Kabat numbering system.<br>
As used herein, the term 'neutralising antibody' describes an antibody that is capable of neutralising the biological signalling activity of IL-6, for example by blocking the site 3 binding of IL-6 to the gp 130 receptor.<br>
Antibodies for use in the present invention may be obtained using any suitable method known in the art. The IL-6 polypeptide or cells expressing the polypeptide can be used to produce antibodies which specifically recognise IL-6. The IL-6 polypeptide may be the 'mature' polypeptide or a biologically active fragment or derivatives thereof. Preferably the IL-6 polypeptide is the mature polypeptide. IL-6 polypeptides may be prepared by processes well known in the art from genetically engineered host cells comprising expression systems or they may be recovered from natural biological sources.   In the present application, the term "polypeptides" includes peptides, polypeptides and proteins. These are used interchangeably unless otherwise specified. The IL-6 polypeptide may in some instances be part of a larger protein such as a fusion protein for example fused to an affinity tag.   Antibodies generated against the IL-6 polypeptide may be obtained, where immunisation of an animal is necessary, by administering the polypeptides to an animal, preferably a non-human animal, using well-known and routine protocols, see for example Handbook of Experimental Immunology, D. M. Weir (ed.), Vol 4, Blackwell Scientific Publishers, Oxford, England, 1986).   Many warmblooded animals, such as rabbits, mice, rats, sheep, cows or pigs may be immunized. However, mice, rabbits, pigs and rats are generally preferred.<br>
Antibodies for use in the present invention include whole antibodies and functionally active fragments or derivatives thereof and may be, but are not limited to, monoclonal, humanised, fµLly human or chimeric antibodies.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies may be prepared by any method known in the art such as the hybridoma technique (Kohler &amp; Milstein, 1975, Nature, 256:495-497), the trioma technique, the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor et at, 1983, Immunology Today, 4:72) and the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, pp77-96, Alan R Liss, Inc., 1985).<br>
Antibodies for use in the invention may also be generated using single lymphocyte antibody methods by cloning and expressing immunoglobµLin variable region cDNAs generated from single lymphocytes selected for the production of specific antibodies by for example the methods described by Babcook, J. et al., 1996, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93(15):7843-78481; WO92/02551; WO2004/051268 and International Patent Application number WO2004/106377.<br>
Humanised antibodies (which include CDR-grafted antibodies) are antibody molecµLes from non-human species having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs)<br>
 from the non-human species and a framework region from a human immunoglobµLin molecµLe (see, e.g. US 5,585,089; W091/09967). It will be appreciated that it may only be necessary to transfer the specificity determining residues of the CDRs rather than the entire CDR (see for example, Kashmiri et al., 2005, Methods, 36, 25-34).   Humanised antibodies may optionally further comprise one or more framework residues derived from the non-human species from which the CDRs were derived.<br>
Chimeric antibodies are those antibodies encoded by immunoglobµLin genes that have been genetically engineered so that the light and heavy chain genes are composed of immunoglobµLin gene segments be IL-ing to different species.<br>
The antibodies for use in the present invention can also be generated using various phage display methods known in the art and include those disclosed by Brinkman et al. (in J. Immunol. Methods, 1995,182: 41-50), Ames et al. (J. Immunol. Methods, 1995,184:177-186), Kettleborough et al. (Eur. J. hnmunol. 1994, 24:952-958), Persic et al. (Gene, 1997 187 9-18), Burton et al. (Advances in Immunology, 1994, 57:191-280) and WO 90/02809; WO 91/10737; WO 92/01047; WO 92/18619; WO 93/11236; WO 95/15982; WO 95/20401; and US 5,698,426; 5,223,409; 5,403,484; 5,580,717; 5,427,908; 5,750,753; 5,821,047; 5,571,698; 5,427,908; 5,516,637; 5,780,225; 5,658,727; 5,733,743 and 5,969,108.<br>
FµLly human antibodies are those antibodies in which the variable regions and the constant regions (where present) of both the heavy and the light chains are all of human origin, or substantially identical to sequences of human origin, not necessarily from the same" antibody. Examples of fµLly human antibodies may include antibodies produced for example by the phage display methods described above and antibodies produced by mice in which the murine immunoglobµLin variable and constant part genes have been replaced by their human counterparts eg. as described in general terms in EP0546073 Bl, US 5,545,806, US 5,569,825, US 5,625,126, US 5,633,425, US 5,661,016, US5,770,429, EP 0438474 Bl and EP0463151 Bl.<br>

It will be appreciated that one or more amino acid substitutions, additions and/or deletions may be made to the CDRs provided by the present invention without significantly altering the ability of the antibody to bind to IL-6 and to neutralise IL-6 activity.   The effect of any arnino acid substitutions, additions and/or deletions can be readily tested by one skilled in the art, for example by using the methods described in the Examples to determine IL-6 binding and neutralisation.

As used herein, the term 'CDR-grafted antibody' refers to an antibody wherein the heavy and/or light chain contains one or more CDRs (including, if desired, one or more modified CDRs) from a donor antibody (e.g. a rat antibody) grafted into a heavy and/or light chain variable region framework of an acceptor antibody (e.g. a human antibody). For a review, see<br>
 Vaughan et al, Nature Biotechnology, 16, 535-539,1998. Preferably one or more of the CDRs have been obtained from the rat antibody 132E09 (SEQ ID NOS:5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10). In one embodiment rather than the entire CDR being transferred, only one or more of the specificity determining residues from any one of the CDRs described herein above are transferred to the human antibody framework (see for example, Kashmiri et al., 2005, Methods, 36, 25-34). In one embodiment only the specificity detenriining residues from one or more of the CDRs described herein above are transferred to the human antibody framework. In another embodiment only the specificity determining residues from each of the CDRs described herein above are transferred to the human antibody framework.<br>
When the CDRs or specificity determining residues are grafted, any appropriate acceptor variable region framework sequence may be used having regard to the class/type of the donor antibody from which the CDRs are derived, including rat, mouse, primate and human framework regions. Preferably, the CDR-grafted antibody of the present invention has at least one variable domain comprising human acceptor framework regions as well as one or more of the CDRs derived from the donor antibody as referred to above. Thus, provided is a neutralising CDR-grafted antibody wherein the variable domain comprises human acceptor framework regions and non-human, preferably rat, donor CDRs.<br>
Examples of human frameworks which can be used in the present invention are KOL, NEWM, REI, EU, TUR, TEI, LAY and POM (Kabat et al, supra). For example, KOL and NEWM can be used for the heavy chain, REI can be used for the light chain and EU, LAY and POM can be used for both the heavy chain and the light chain. Alternatively, human germline sequences may be used; the sequences of these are available at: http ://vbase.mrc-cpe.cam.ac.uk/<br>
In a CDR-grafted antibody of the present invention, the acceptor heavy and light chains do not necessarily need to be derived from the same antibody and may, if desired, comprise composite chains having framework regions derived from different chains.<br>
The preferred framework region for the heavy chain of the CDR-grafted antibody of the present invention is derived from the human sub-group VH3 sequence 1-4 3-72 together with JH4 (shown in Figure 2; SEQ ID NOS:19 and 20). Accordingly, provided is a neutralising CDR-grafted antibody comprising at least one non-human donor CDR wherein the heavy chain framework region is derived from the human subgroup sequence 1-4 3-72 together with JH4. The sequence of human JH4 is as follows: (YFDY)WGQGTLVTVSS<br>
 (SEQ ID NO:20). The YFDY motif is part of CDR-H3 and is not part of framework 4 (Ravetch, JV. et al, 1981, Cell, 27, 583-591). The donor sequence is the 132E09 VH sequence (SEQ ID NO:2) shown in Figure 2 and the donor CDRs (SEQ ID NOs: 5, 6 and 7) are underlined.<br>
The preferred framework region for the light chain of the CDR-grafted antibody of the present invention is derived from the human germline sub-group VK1 sequence 2-l-(l) 012 together with JK2 shown in Figure 2 (SEQ ID N0:21 and 22). Accordingly, provided is a neutralising CDR-grafted antibody comprising at least one non-human donor CDR wherein the light chain framework region is derived from the human subgroup sequence VK1 2-l-(l) 012 together with JK2. The JK2 sequence is as follows: (YT)FGQGTKLEIKR (SEQ ID NO:22). The YT motif is part of CDR-L3 and is not part of framework 4 (Hieter, PA., et al., 1982, J. Biol. Chem., 257, 1516-1522). The donor sequence is the 132E09 VL sequence (SEQ ID N0:4) shown in Figure 2 and the donor CDRs (SEQ ID NOs 8, 9 and 10) are underlined.<br>
Also, in a CDR-grafted antibody of the present invention, the framework regions need not have exactly the same sequence as those of the acceptor antibody. For instance, unusual residues may be changed to more frequently-occurring residues for that acceptor chain class or type. Alternatively, selected residues in the acceptor framework regions may be changed so that they correspond to the residue found at the same position in the donor antibody (see Reichmann et al, 1998, Nature, 332, 323-324). Such changes shoµLd be kept to the minimum necessary to recover the affinity of the donor antibody. A protocol for selecting residues in the acceptor framework regions which may need to be changed is set forth in WO 91/09967.<br>
Preferably, in a CDR-grafted antibody molecµLe of the present invention, if the acceptor heavy chain has the human VH3 sequence 1-4 3-72 together with JH4, then the acceptor framework regions of the heavy chain comprise, in addition to one or more donor CDRs, a donor residue at at least position 49 (according to Kabat et al.,(supra)). Accordingly, provided is a CDR-grafted antibody, wherein at least the residue at position 49 of the variable domain of the heavy chain is a donor residue.<br>
Preferably, in a CDR-grafted antibody molecµLe according to the present invention, if the acceptor light chain has the human sub-group VK1 sequence 2-l-(l) 012 together with JK2, then no donor residues are used in the acceptor framework regions of the light chain and only one or more donor CDRs are transferred.<br>
 Donor residues are residues from the donor antibody, i.e. the antibody from which the CDRs were originally derived, which in the case of the present invention is the rat antibody 132E09.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an antibody in which the heavy chain variable region comprises the sequence of gH13 (Figure 2; SEQ ID NO:l 1).<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the antibody comprises a heavy chain, wherein the variable domain of the heavy chain comprises a sequence having at least 60% identity or similarity to the sequence given in SEQ ED NO:ll. Preferably, the antibody comprises a heavy chain, wherein the variable domain of the heavy chain comprises a sequence having at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 98% identity or similarity to the sequence given in SEQ ID NO:ll.<br>
In addition, the present invention provides an antibody in which the light chain variable region comprises the sequence of gLIO (Figure 2; SEQ ID NO:13).<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the antibody comprises a light chain, wherein the variable domain of the light chain comprises a sequence having at least 60% identity or similarity to the sequence given in SEQ ID NO:13.  Preferably, the antibody comprises a light chain, wherein the variable domain of the light chain comprises a sequence having at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 98% identity or similarity to the sequence given in SEQ ID NO: 13.<br>
Preferably a CDR-grafted antibody according to the present invention comprises a heavy chain comprising the sequence of gH13 (SEQ ID NO:l 1) and a light chain comprising the sequence of gLIO (SEQ ID NO: 13).<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the antibody comprises a heavy chain and a light chain, wherein the variable domain of the heavy chain comprises a sequence having at least 60% identity or similarity to the sequence given in SEQ ID NO: 11 and the variable domain of the light chain comprises a sequence having at least 60% identity or similarity to the sequence given in SEQ ID NO: 13. Preferably, the antibody comprises a heavy chain, wherein the variable domain of the light chain comprises a sequence having at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 98% identity or similarity to the sequence given in SEQ ID NO:l 1 and a light chain, wherein the variable domain of the light chain comprises a sequence having at<br>
 least 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 98% identity or similarity to the sequence given in SEQ ID NO:13.<br>
The antibody molecµLes of the present invention may comprise a complete antibody molecµLe having fµLl length heavy and light chains or a fragment thereof and may be, but are not limited to Fab, modified Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv, single domain antibodies, scFv, bi, tri or tetra-valent antibodies, Bis-scFv, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above (see for example Holliger and Hudson, 2005, Nature Biotech. 23(9):1126-1136; Adair and Lawson, 2005, Drug Design Reviews - Online 2(3), 209-217). The methods for creating and manufacturing these antibody fragments are well known in the art (see for example Verma et al., 1998, Journal of Immunological Methods, 216,165-181), Other antibody fragments for use in the present invention include the Fab and Fab' fragments described in International patent applications WO2005/003169, WO2005/003170 and WO2005/003171.   MµLti-valent antibodies may comprise mµLtiple specificities or may be monospecific (see for example WO 92/22853 and WO05/113605).<br>
The constant region domains of the antibody molecµLe of the present invention, if present, may be selected having regard to the proposed function of the antibody molecµLe, and in particµLar the effector functions which may be required. For example, the constant region domains may be human IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG or IgM domains. In particµLar, human IgG constant region domains may be used, especially of the IgGl and IgG3 isotypes when the antibody molecµLe is intended for therapeutic uses and antibody effector functions are required. Alternatively, IgG2 and IgG4 isotypes may be used when the antibody molecµLe is intended for therapeutic purposes and antibody effector functions are not required, e.g. for simply blocking IL-6 activity. It will be appreciated that sequence variants of these constant region domains may also be used. For example IgG molecµLes in which the serine at position 241 has been changed to proline as described in Angal et al, MolecµLar Immunology, 1993, 30 (1), 105-108 may be used.  ParticµLarly preferred is the IgG4 constant domain comprising this change. It will also be understood by one skilled in the art that antibodies may undergo a variety of posttranslational modifications. The type and extent of these modifications often depends on the host cell line used to express the antibody as well as the cµLture conditions. Such modifications may include variations in glycosylation, methionine oxidation, diketopiperizine formation, aspartate isomerization and asparagine deamidation. A frequent modification is the loss of a carboxy-terminal basic residue (such as lysine or arginine) due to<br>
 the action of carboxypeptidases (as described in Harris, RJ. Journal of Chromatography 705:129-134,1995).   Accordingly, the C-terminal lysine of the antibody heavy chain of SEQ ID NO: 16 may be absent.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the antibody provided by the present invention is a neutralising antibody having specificity for human IL-6 in which the heavy chain constant region comprises the human IgG4 constant region in which the serine at position 241 has been substituted by proline as described in Angal et al., supra. Accordingly, the present invention provides an antibody in which the heavy chain comprises or consists of the sequence given in SEQ ID NO: 16. Preferably the light chain constant region is cKappa.<br>

Examples of such methods include screening peptides of varying lengths derived from IL-6 for binding to the antibody of the present invention with the smallest fragment that can specifically bind to the antibody containing the sequence of the epitope recognised by the antibody. The IL-6 peptides may be produced synthetically or by proteolytic digestion of the IL-6 polypeptide. Peptides that bind the antibody can be identified by, for example, mass spectrometric analysis. In another example, NMR. spectroscopy can be used to identify the epitope bound by an antibody of the present invention, as described in the Examples herein.  Once identified, the epitopic fragment which binds an antibody of the present invention can be used, if required, as an immunogen to obtain additional neutralising antibodies which bind the same epitope.<br>

Accordingly, the present invention also provides a neutralising antibody having specificity for human IL-6, which cross-blocks the binding of any one of the antibodies described above to human IL-6 and/or is cross-blocked from binding IL-6 by any one of those antibodies. In one embodiment, such an antibody binds to the same epitope as an antibody described herein above.

In another embodiment the cross-blocking neutralising antibody of this aspect of the invention does not bind to the same epitope as an antibody of the present invention or an epitope that borders and/or overlaps with said epitope.<br>
 Cross-blocking antibodies can be identified using any suitable method in the art, for example by using competition ELISA or BIAcore where binding of the cross blocking antibody to human IL-6 prevents the binding of an antibody of the present invention or vice versa.<br>

Preferably an antibody molecµLe according to the present invention has a binding affinity for human IL-6 of less than 500pM. Preferably an antibody molecµLe according to the present invention has a binding affinity for human IL-6 of less than 50pM. Accordingly, in one embodiment an antibody molecµLe of the present invention has a binding affinity of between about 1 and about 500pM. In one embodiment the antibody molecµLe of the present invention has a binding affinity of between about 1 and about 50 pM. Preferably the antibody molecµLe of the present invention has a binding affinity for human IL-6 of between about 1 and about 20pM. In one embodiment the antibody of the present invention has a binding affinity for human IL-6 of between 8 and 12pM. It will be appreciated that the affinity of antibodies provided by the present invention may be altered using any suitable method known in the art. The present invention therefore also relates to variants of the antibody molecµLes of the present invention, which have an improved affinity for human IL-6. Such variants can be obtained by a number of affinity maturation protocols mcluding mutating the CDRs (Yang et al, J. Mol. Biol, 254, 392-403,1995), chain shuffling (Marks et al, Bio/Technology, 10, 779-783, 1992), use of mutator strains of E. coli (Low et al, J. Mol.

If desired an antibody according to the present invention may be conjugated to one or more effector molecµLe(s). It will be appreciated that in one embodiment the effector molecµLe may comprise a single effector molecµLe or two or more such molecµLes so linked as to form a single moiety that can be attached to the antibodies of the present invention. Where it is desired to obtain an antibody fragment linked to an effector molecµLe, this may be prepared by standard chemical or recombinant DNA procedures in which the antibody fragment is linked either directly or via a coupling agent to the effector molecµLe. Techniques for conjugating such effector molecµLes to antibodies are well known in the art (see, Hellstrom et al, Controlled Drug Delivery, 2nd Ed., Robinson et al, eds., 1987, pp. 623-53; Thorpe et al, 1982 , Immunol.

See generally U.S. Patent No. 4,741,900 for metal ions which can be conjugated to antibodies for use as diagnostics. Suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; suitable<br>
 prosthetic groups include streptavidin, avidin and biotin; suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride and phycoerythrin; suitable luminescent materials include luminol; suitable bioluminescent materials include luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin; and suitable radioactive nuclides include 125L 13lI, 111In and 99Tc.<br>
la another example the effector molecµLe(s) may increase the half-life of the antibody in vivo, and/or reduce irnmunogenicity of the antibody and/or enhance the delivery of an antibody across an epithelial barrier to the immune system. Examples of suitable effector molecµLes of this type include polymers, albumin, albumin binding proteins or albumin binding compounds such as those described in WO05/117984 (published 15.12.05).<br>
Where the effector molecµLe is a polymer it may, in general, be a synthetic or a naturally occurring polymer, for example an optionally substituted straight or branched chain polyalkylene, polyalkenylene or polyoxyalkylene polymer or a branched or unbranched polysaccharide, e.g. a homo- or hetero- polysaccharide.<br>
ParticµLar optional substituents which may be present on the above-mentioned synthetic polymers include one or more hydroxy, methyl or methoxy groups.<br>
ParticµLar examples of synthetic polymers include optionally substituted straight or branched cliain poly(ethyleneglycol), poly(propyleneglycol) poly(vinylalcohol) or derivatives thereof, especially optionally substituted poly(ethyleneglycol) such as methoxypoly(ethyleneglycol) or derivatives thereof.<br>
ParticµLar naturally occurring polymers include lactose, amyiose, dextran, glycogen or derivatives thereof.<br>
"Derivatives" as used herein is intended to include reactive derivatives, for example thiol-selective reactive groups such as maleimides and the like. The reactive group may be linked directly or through a linker segment to the polymer. It will be appreciated that the residue of such a group will in some instances form part of the product as the linking group between the antibody fragment and the polymer.<br>
The size of the polymer may be varied as desired, but will generally be in an average molecµLar weight range from 500Da to 50000Da, preferably from 5000 to 40000Da and more preferably from 20000 to 40000Da. The polymer size may in particµLar be selected on the basis of the intended use of the product for example ability to localize to certain tissues such<br>
 as tumors or extend circµLating half-life (for review see Chapman, 2002, Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 54, 531-545). Thus, for example, where the product is intended to leave the circµLation and penetrate tissue, for example for use in the treatment of a tumour, it may be advantageous to use a small molecµLar weight polymer, for example with a molecµLar weight of around 5000Da. For applications where the product remains in the circµLation, it may be advantageous to use a higher molecµLar weight polymer, for example having a molecµLar weight in the range from 20000Da to 40000Da.<br>
ParticµLarly preferred polymers include a polyalkylene polymer, such as a poly(ethyleneglycol) or, especially, a methoxypoly(ethyleneglycol) or a derivative thereof, and especially with a molecµLar weight in the range from about 15000Da to about 40000Da.<br>
In one example antibodies for use in the present invention are attached to poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) moieties. In one particµLar example the antibody is an antibody fragment and the PEG molecµLes may be attached through any available amino acid side-chain or terminal amino acid functional group located in the antibody fragment, for example any free amino, imino, thiol, hydroxyl or carboxyl group.   Such amino acids may occur naturally in the antibody fragment or may be engineered into the fragment using recombinant DNA methods (see for example US 5,219,996; US 5,667,425; W098/25971).   In one example the antibody molecµLe of the present invention is a modified Fab fragment wherein the modification is the addition to the C-terminal end of its heavy chain one or more amino acids to allow the attachment of an effector molecµLe. Preferably, the additional amino acids form a modified hinge region containing one or more cysteine residues to which the effector molecµLe may be attached.   MµLtiple sites can be used to attach two or more PEG molecµLes.<br>
Preferably PEG molecµLes are covalently linked through a thiol group of at least one cysteine residue located in the antibody fragment. Each polymer molecµLe attached to the modified antibody fragment may be covalently linked to the sµLphur atom of a cysteine residue located in the fragment. The covalent linkage will generally be a disµLphide bond or, in particµLar, a sµLphur-carbon bond. Where a thiol group is used as the point of attachment appropriately activated effector molecµLes, for example thiol selective derivatives such as maleimides and cysteine derivatives may be used. An activated polymer may be used as the starting material in the preparation of polymer-modified antibody fragments as described above. The activated polymer may be any polymer containing a thiol reactive group such as an α-halocarboxylic acid or ester, e.g. iodoacetamide, animide, e.g. maleimide, a vinyl<br>
 sµLphone or a disµLphide. Such starting materials may be obtained commercially (for example from Nektar, formerly Shearwater Polymers Inc., Huntsville, AL, USA) or may be prepared from commercially available starting materials using conventional chemical procedures. ParticµLar PEG molecµLes include 20K methoxy-PEG-amine (obtainable from Nektar, formerly Shearwater; Rapp Polymere; and SunBio) and M-PEG-SPA (obtainable from Nektar, formerly Shearwater).<br>
In one embodiment, the antibody is a modified Fab fragment or diFab which is PEGylated, i.e. has PEG (poly(ethyleneglycol)) covalently attached thereto, e.g. according to the methods disclosed in EP 0948544 or EP1090037 [see also "Poly(ethyleneglycol) Chemistry, Biotechnical and Biomedical Applications", 1992, J. Milton Harris (ed), Plenum Press, New York, "Poly(ethyleneglycol) Chemistry and Biological Applications", 1997, J. Milton Harris and S. Zalipsky (eds), American Chemical Society, Washington DC and "Bioconjugation Protein Coupling Techniques for the Biomedical Sciences", 1998, M. Aslam and A. Dent, Grove Publishers, New York; Chapman, A. 2002, Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 2002, 54:531-545]. In one example PEG is attached to a cysteine in the hinge region. In one example, a PEG modified Fab fragment has a maleimide group covalently linked to a single thiol group in a modified hinge region. A lysine residue may be covalently linked to the maleimide group and to each of the amine groups on the lysine residue may be attached a methoxypoly(ethyleneglycol) polymer having a molecµLar weight of approximately 20,000 Da. The total molecµLar weight of the PEG attached to the Fab fragment may therefore be approximately 40,000 Da.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a neutralising antibody molecµLe having specificity for human IL-6, which is a modified Fab fragment having a heavy chain comprising the sequence given in SEQ ID NO: 11 and a light chain comprising the sequence given in SEQ ID NO: 13 and having at the C-terminal end of its heavy chain a modified hinge region containing at least one cysteine residue to which an effector molecµLe is attached. Preferably the effector molecµLe is PEG and is attached using the methods described in (W098/25971 and WO2004072116) whereby a lysyl-maleimide group is attached to the cysteine residue at the C-terminal end of the heavy chain, and each amino group of the lysyl residue has covalently linked to it a methoxypoly(ethyleneglycol) residue having a molecµLar weight of about 20,000 Da. The total molecµLar weight of the PEG attached to the antibody is therefore approximately 40,000Da.<br>
 In another example effector molecµLes may he attached to antibody fragments using the methods described in International patent applications WO2005/003169, WO2005/003170 and WO2005/003171.<br>
The present invention also provides an isolated DNA sequence encoding the heavy and/or light chain(s) of an antibody molecµLe of the present invention. Preferably, the DNA sequence encodes the heavy or the light chain of an antibody molecµLe of the present invention. The DNA sequence of the present invention may comprise synthetic DNA, for instance produced by chemical processing, cDNA, genomic DNA or any combination thereof.<br>
DNA sequences which encode an antibody molecµLe of the present invention can be obtained by methods well known to those skilled in the art. For example, DNA sequences coding for part or all of the antibody heavy and light chains may be synthesised as desired from the detennined DNA sequences or on the basis of the corresponding amino acid sequences.<br>
DNA coding for acceptor framework sequences is widely available to those skilled in the art and can be readily synthesised on the basis of their known amino acid sequences.<br>
Standard techniques of molecµLar biology may be used to prepare DNA sequences coding for the antibody molecµLe of the present invention. Desired DNA sequences may be synthesised completely or in part using oligonucleotide synthesis techniques. Site-directed mutagenesis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques may be used as appropriate.<br>
Examples of suitable DNA sequences are provided in SEQ ID NO:l; SEQ ID NO:3; SEQ ED NO:12; SEQ ID NO:14; SEQ ID NO:15 and SEQ ID NO:17. Nucleotides 1-57 in SEQ ID NO 15 and 1-60 in SEQ ID NO 17 encode the signal peptide sequence from mouse antibody B72.3 (Whittle et al., 1987, Protein Eng. 1(6) 499-505.) which is cleaved to give a neutralising antibody molecµLe of the present invention. Accordingly the present invention also provides an isolated DNA sequence encoding the heavy chain of an antibody of the present invention which comprises nucleotides 58-2008 of SEQ ID NO:15. The present invention also provides an isolated DNA sequence encoding the light chain of an antibody of the present invention which comprises nucleotides 61-705 of SEQ ID NO: 17.<br>
The present invention also relates to a cloning or expression vector comprising one or more DNA sequences of the present invention. Accordingly, provided is a cloning or expression vector comprising one or more DNA sequences encoding an antibody of the<br>
 present invention. Preferably, the cloning or expression vector comprises two DNA sequences, encoding the light chain and the heavy chain of the antibody molecµLe of the present invention, respectively. Preferably, a vector according to the present invention comprises the sequences given in SEQ ID NOS:15 and 17.- Nucleotides 1-57 in SEQ ID NO 15 and 1-60 in SEQ ID NO 17 encode the signal peptide sequence from mouse antibody B72.3 which is most preferably cleaved to give a neutralising antibody molecµLe of the present invention.<br>
General methods by which the vectors may be constructed, transfection methods and cµLture methods are well known to those skilled in the art. In this respect, reference is made to "Current Protocols in MolecµLar Biology", 1999, F. M. Ausubel (ed), Wiley Interscience, New York and the Maniatis Manual produced by Cold Spring Harbor Publishing.<br>
Also provided is a host cell comprising one or more cloning or expression vectors comprising one or more DNA sequences encoding an antibody of the present invention. Any suitable host cell/vector system may be used for expression of the DNA sequences encoding the antibody molecµLe of the present invention. Bacterial, for example E. coli, and other microbial systems may be used or eukaryotic, for example mammalian, host cell expression systems may also be used, see Verma et al, 1998, Journal of Immunological Methods, 216, 165-181. Suitable mammalian host cells include CHO, NSO, myeloma or hybridoma cells. Examples of suitable expression systems include the glutamine synthetase expression system described in WO87/04462.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the production of an antibody molecµLe according to the present invention comprising cµLturing a host cell containing a vector of the present invention under conditions suitable for leading to expression of protein from DNA encoding the antibody molecµLe of the present invention, and isolating the antibody molecµLe.<br>
The antibody molecµLe may comprise only a heavy or light chain polypeptide,' in which case only a heavy chain or hght chain polypeptide coding sequence needs to be used to transfect the host cells. For production of products comprising both heavy and light chains, the cell line may be transfected with two vectors, a first vector encoding a Hght chain polypeptide and a second vector encoding a heavy chain polypeptide. Alternatively, a single vector may be used, the vector including sequences encoding Hght chain and heavy chain polypeptides.<br>
As the antibodies of the present invention are usefµL in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of a pathological condition, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical or diagnostic composition comprising an antibody molecµLe of the present invention in combination with one or more of a phannaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent or carrier. Accordingly, provided is the use of an antibody of the invention for the manufacture of a medicament. The composition will usually be supplied as part of a sterile, pharmaceutical composition that will normally include a phannaceutically acceptable carrier. A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may additionally comprise a pharmaceutically-acceptable adjuvant.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for preparation of a pharmaceutical or diagnostic composition comprising adding and mixing the antibody molecµLe of the present invention together with one or more of a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent or carrier.<br>
The antibody molecµLe may be the sole active ingredient in the pharmaceutical or diagnostic composition or may be accompanied by other active ingredients including other antibody ingredients, for example anti-TNF, anti- IL-lß, anti-T cell, anti-IFN or anti-LPS antibodies, or non-antibody ingredients such as xanthines.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions preferably comprise a therapeutically effective amount of the antibody of the invention. The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein refers to an amount of a therapeutic agent needed to treat, ameliorate or prevent a targeted disease or condition, or to exhibit a detectable therapeutic or preventative effect. For any antibody, the therapeutically effective amount can be estimated initially either in cell cµLture assays or in animal models, usually in rodents, rabbits, dogs, pigs or primates. The animal model may also be used to determine the appropriate concentration range and route of administration. Such information can then be used to determine usefµL doses and routes for administration in humans.<br>
The precise therapeutically effective amount for a human subject will depend upon the severity of the disease state, the general health of the subject, the age, weight and gender of the subject, diet, time and frequency.of administration, drug combination(s), reaction sensitivities and tolerance/response to therapy. This amount can be determined by routine experimentation and is within the judgement of the clinician. Generally, a therapeutically<br>
 effective amount will be from 0.01 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg, preferably 0.1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg. Pharmaceutical compositions may be conveniently presented in unit dose forms containing a predetermined amount of an active agent of the invention per dose.<br>
Compositions may be administered individually to a patient or may be administered in combination (e.g. simµLtaneously, sequentially or separately) with other agents, drugs or hormones.<br>
The dose at which the antibody molecµLe of the present invention is administered depends on the nature of the condition to be treated, the extent of the inflammation present and on whether the antibody molecµLe is being used prophylactically or to treat an existing condition.<br>
The frequency of dose will depend on the half-life of the antibody molecµLe and the duration of its effect. If the antibody molecµLe has a short half-life (e.g. 2 to 10 hours) it may be necessary to give one or more doses per day. Alternatively, if the antibody molecµLe has a  IL- half life (e.g. 2 to 15 days or 2 to 30 days) it may only be necessary to give a dosage once per day, once per week or even once every 1 or 2 months.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier shoµLd not itself induce the production of antibodies harmfµL to the individual receiving the composition and shoµLd not be toxic. Suitable carriers may be large, slowly metabolised macromolecµLes such as proteins, polypeptides, liposomes, polysaccharides, polylactic acids, polyglycolic acids, polymeric amino acids, amino acid copolymers and inactive virus particles.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used, for example mineral acid salts, such as hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, phosphates and sµLphates, or salts of organic acids, such as acetates, propionates, malonates and benzoates.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers in therapeutic compositions may additionally contain liquids such as water, sahne, glycerol and ethanol. Additionally, auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emµLsifying agents or pH buffering substances, may be present in such compositions. Such carriers enable the pharmaceutical compositions to be formµLated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsµLes, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries and suspensions, for ingestion by the patient.<br>
Preferred forms for administration include forms suitable for parenteral administration, e.g. by injection or infusion, for example by bolus injection or continuous<br>
 infusion. Where the product is for injection or infusion, it may take the form of a suspension, solution or emµLsion in an oily or aqueous vehicle and it may contain formµLatory agents, such as suspending, preservative, stabilising and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the antibody molecµLe may be in dry form, for reconstitution before use with an appropriate sterile liquid.<br>
Once formµLated, the compositions of the invention can be administered directly to the subject. The subjects to be treated can be animals. However, it is preferred that the compositions are adapted for administration to human subjects.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered by any number of routes including, but not limited to, oral, intravenous, intramuscµLar, intra-arterial, intramedµLlary, intrathecal, intraventricµLar, transdermal, transcutaneous (for example, see WO 98/20734), subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, enteral, topical, sublingual, intravaginal or rectal routes. Hyposprays may also be used to administer the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Typically, the therapeutic compositions may be prepared as injectables, either as liquid solutions or suspensions. Solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid vehicles prior to injection may also be prepared.<br>
Direct delivery of the compositions will generally be accomplished by injection, subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intravenously or intramuscµLarly, or delivered to the interstitial space of a tissue. The compositions can also be administered into a lesion. Dosage treatment may be a single dose schedµLe or a mµLtiple dose schedµLe.<br>
It will be appreciated that the active ingredient in the composition will be an antibody molecµLe. As such, it will be susceptible to degradation in the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, if the composition is to be administered by a route using the gastrointestinal tract, the composition will need to contain agents which protect the antibody from degradation but which release the antibody once it has been absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
A thorough discussion of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers is available in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Company, N.J. 1991).<br>
It is also envisaged that the antibody of the present invention may be administered by use of gene therapy. In order to achieve this, DNA sequences encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody molecµLe under the control of appropriate DNA components are<br>
introduced into a patient such that the antibody chains are expressed from the DNA sequences and assembled in situ.<br>

 The present invention further provides the use of an antibody molecµLe according to the present invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of pain.<br>
An antibody molecµLe of the present invention may be utilised in any therapy where it is desired to reduce the effects of IL-6 in the human or animal body. IL-6 may be circµLating in the body or may be present in an undesirably high level localised at a particµLar site in the body, for example a site of inflammation.<br>
An antibody molecµLe of the present invention is preferably used for the control of inflammatory disease.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of treating human or animal subjects suffering from or at risk of a disorder mediated by JL-6, the method comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of the antibody molecµLe of the present invention.<br>

DNA manipµLations and general methods<br>
E. coli strain INVaF' (Invitrogen) was used for transformation and routine cµLture growth. DNA restriction and modification enzymes were obtained from Roche Diagnostics Ltd. and New England Biolabs. Plasmid preparations were performed using Maxi Plasmid purification kits (QIAGEN, catalogue No. 12165). DNA sequencing reactions were performed using the ABI Prism Big Dye terminator sequencing kit (catalogue No. 4304149) and run on an ABI 3100 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Data was analysed using the program Auto Assembler (Applied Biosystems). Oligonucleotides were obtained from INVITROGEN. Synthetic genes were built at Entelechon. The concentration of Fab and IgG was determined using assembly ELISA.<br>
Example 1;  Isolation of 132E09<br>
Rats were immunised by subcutaneous injection of recombinant human IL-6 (Peprotech) at three weekly intervals, initially with Freund's Complete Adjuvant and subsequently with Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant. Spleens were harvested one-two weeks after the last immunisation, and single cell suspensions prepared. Immune rat lymphocytes were cµLtured in the presence of irradiated mouse thymoma EL4 cells and rabbit T cell conditioned media for one week in 96 well microtitre plates. Supematants were screened for the presence of antibodies specific for human IL-6 in ELISAs. Positives were further screened for the ability to neutralise the biological effects of human IL-6 in a DS1 cell line assay (Bock et ai, 1993, Cytokine, 5,480-489).<br>
Individual B cells secreting antibody with appropriate binding characteristics were isolated from positive microtitre wells according to the Selected Lymphocyte Antibody Method (Babcook et al., 1996, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93, 7843-7848; WO92/02551), and heavy and light chain variable region genes were cloned via reverse transcription PCR from single rat B cells. Variable regions were expressed in recombinant IgG format to confirm binding,<br>
 and antibody 132E09 was selected for humanisation and further study.   The rat variable region sequence was registered as CA030_00240. The V-region sequences are shown in SEQ ED NOS:l to 4.<br>
Example 2: CDR-grafting of 132E09<br>
A series of humanised VL and VH regions were designed in which the CDR hypervariable regions plus a varying number of framework residues from 132E09 were grafted onto human V-region acceptor frameworks.<br>
Ten grafted VL regions (gLl-10) were designed and genes were built by oligonucleotide assembly and PCR mutagenesis. A total of 13 grafted VH regions were also constructed (gHl-13) using two different framework regions, VH3 1-4 3-72 and VH3 1-3 3-21. The light chain grafted sequences were sub-cloned into the human light chain expression vector pKHl0.l which contains the DNA encoding the human C-Kappa constant region (Km3 allotype). The heavy chain grafted sequences were sub-cloned into the human gamma-4 expression vector pVhg4P FL, which contains the DNA encoding the human gamma-4 constant region containing the hinge stabilising mutation S241P (Angal et al, supra). Plasmids were co-transfected into CHO cells and the antibodies produced screened for activity in IL-6 binding and in vivo assays. Transfections of CHO cells were performed using the Lipofectamine™ 2000 procedure according to manufacturer's instructions (InVitrogen, catalogue No. 11668).<br>
Of the 13 heavy chain grafts produced, two contained only a single framework donor residue (Ala) at position 49 and these were produced using both of the two different heavy chain frameworks. The VH3 1-3 3-21 graft expressed poorly in CHO cells and showed a reduced affinity for IL-6. In contrast, the graft using the VH3 1-4 3-72 framework expressed well and retained the affinity of the donor antibody. This heavy chain graft, comprising only a single donor framework residue, was selected in combination with the light chain graft gLIO in which only the CDRs were transfered.<br>
Figure 1 shows an alignment between the donor rat sequence 132E09 and the acceptor human frameworks. The heavy chain acceptor framework is the human germline sequence VH3 1-3 3-72, with framework 4 corning from this portion of the human JH-region germline JH4. The light chain acceptor framework is the human germline sequence VK1 2-1-(1) 012, with<br>
 framework 4 corning from this portion of the human JK-region germline JK2. The graft sequences for gH13 and gLIO are shown in Figure 1 (SEQ ID NOS: 11, 12, 13 and 14).<br>
This grafted antibody was termed CA030_00240.gl. This was produced as a whole IgG4 comprising the serine to proline substitution at position 241 as describe above. The complete translated heavy and light chain sequences are shown in Figures 2a and 2b respectively. The complete amino acid sequence of the heavy chain is provided in SEQ ID NO 16 and the light chain in SEQ ID NO 18. The DNA sequence encoding the heavy and the light chain are provided in SEQ ID Nos 15 and 17 respectively. Nucleotides 1-57 in SEQ ID NO 15 and in Figure 2a encode the signal peptide sequences from mouse antibody B72.3 VH and nucleotides 1-60 in SEQ ED NO 17 and in Figure 2b encode the signal peptide sequences from mouse antibody B72.3 VL.<br>
Mouse antibody B72.3 is described in Whittle et al, 1987, Protein Eng. 1(6) 499-505.<br>
Example 3: Binding affinity<br>
CA030_00240.gl binding affinity measurements<br>
The BIAcore technology monitors the binding between biomolecµLes in real time and without the requirement for labelling. One of the interactants, termed the ligand, is either immobilised directly or captured on the immobilised surface while the other, termed the analyte, flows in solution over the captured surface. The sensor detects the change in mass on the sensor surface as the analyte binds to the ligand to form a complex on the surface. This corresponds to the association process. The dissociation process is monitored when the analyte is replaced by buffer. In the affinity BIAcore assay, the hgand is CA030_00240.gl whole IgG4 and the analyte is human IL-6.<br>

Assay Method<br>
 BIA (Biamolecular Interaction Analysis) was performed using a BIAcore 3000 (BIAcore AB). Affmipure F(ab')2 Fragment goat anti-human IgG, Fc fragment specific (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was immobilised on a CM5 Sensor Chip via amine coupling chemistry to a capture level of «5000 response units (RUs). HBS-EP buffer (l0mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005 % Surfactant P20, BIAcore AB) was used as the running buffer with a flow rate of 10µl/min.. A 10 u,l injection of CA030_240.gl at 4 µg/mL was used for capture by the immobilised anti-human IgG-Fc. Human IL-6 was titrated over the captured CA030_240.gl at various concentrations at a flow rate of 30 uL/min. The surface was regenerated by a 10 µL injection of 40 mM HC1, followed by a 5 uX injection of 5 mM NaOH at a flowrate of 10µL/min.<br>
Background subtraction binding curves were analysed using the BlAevaluation software (version 3.2) following standard procedures. Kinetic parameters were determined from the fitting algorithm.<br>
One batch of CA030_240.gl was used in this study. The affinity was measured at human IL-6 concentrations at or below 20 nM. The affinity value determined for CA030_240.gl was in the range 9.02-10.50 pM with a mean ± s.e.m. of 9.76 + 0.74 pM (Table 1.1). It was not possible to measure the affinity with the human IL-6 immobilised on the BIAcore chip as immobilising the IL-6 resulted in a loss of native conformation.<br>
Because it was not possible to quantify the Cynomologous monkey or Rhesus monkey IL-6 it was also not possible to determine true kinetic parameters for their interaction with CA030_00240.gl. However, visual inspection of the binding sensorgrams indicates that CA030_00240.gl binds these non-human primate IL-6's with a similar affinity to that for )     human IL-6.<br>

Example 5: In vitro neutralisation assays<br>
The potency of antibody CA030 00240.gl, henceforth abbreviated to 240.gl, was determined using two different assays. The first assay employed a mouse IL-6 dependent cell line, called T1165, that proliferates in response to mouse, rhesus, cynomolgus and human IL-6. This direct signalling of IL-6 to cell surface IL-6 receptor, in conjunction with a signalling receptor sub-unit called gpl30, is termed czs-signalling. The second assay used human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) stimulated with IL-6 plus soluble IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) with the readout being production of monocyte chemoatractant protein-1 (MCP-1). In this assay IL-6 was either added exogenously or could be produced by stimulating HUVECs with the cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17). These two assay variants were termed trans-signalling as HUVECs do not express IL-6R and can only respond i.e. produce MCP-1 when IL-6 and soluble IL-6R are both added exogenously.<br>
Using these various assays it was possible to generate ND50 (neutralisation dose 50%) values for 240.gl against human (recombinant and natural), rhesus, cynomolgus and mouse IL-6.<br>

Measurement of240.gl activity using the IL-6 dependent proliferation ofT1165 cells.<br>
Tl 165 cells were thawed 4 days prior to use and cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, antibiotics, glutamine and  IL-/ml of human IL-6. Cell viability was monitored using trypan blue exclusion, only cells deemed to be at least 90% viable were used. Prior to use cells were washed, twice, in RPMI1640 in the absence of human IL-6. Cells were then counted and dispensed into 96 well flat bottomed plates at a density of 5xl04/cell per well. In separate plates a serial dilution of 240.gl was incubated in the presence of either human recombinant, human mammalian-derived (also referred to as human CHO IL-6), rhesus, cynomolgus or mouse LL-6 at a fixed concentration of lng/ml (0.038nM). The pre-mixed complex of 240.gl and IL-6 was then transferred to wells containing Tl 165 cells which were incubated for 48 hours at 37°C in a humidified 5%CO2 atmosphere. During the last six hours of incubation 20ml of CellTiter 96® AQueous was added to determine the number of proliferating cells. The inhibition of IL-6-dependent proliferation of T1165 cells by 240.gl was expressed as a percentage inhibition of wells treated with IL-6 only minus control wells that contained cells but no LL-6.<br>
The activity of 240.gl against human recombinant, human mammalian-derived, rhesus, cynomolgus and mouse IL-6 induced proliferation of the cell line Tl 165 can be seen in figure 3 a. 240.gl potently inhibited human recombinant, human mammalian-derived, rhesus, cynomolgus but not mouse IL-6 activity.<br>
The ND50 for human recombinant IL-6 was 1.1 ± 0.5 ng/ml (7.26 ± 3.3 pM). The ND50 for human mammalian derived IL-6 was 3.6 ± 2.4 ng/ml (23.76 ± 15.84 pM). The ND50 for rhesus IL-6 was 2.2 ± 1.1 ng/ml (14.52 ± 7.26 pM). The ND50 for cynomolgus IL-6 was 5.4 ±1.1 ng/ml (35.64 ± 7.26 pM).<br>
Measurement of2401.gl activity using IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor induced MCP-1 production in HUVECs.<br>
HUVECs (TCS Cellworks, UK) were grown in large vessel endothelium cell basal medium (LVECBM) and passaged in culture no more than five times. Cells were grown until 75% confluence before use. Cells were detached using trypsin/EDTA, resuspended and washed once in fresh LVECBM. Cells were then counted and dispensed into 96 well flat bottomed plates at a density of 2xl04/cells per well. Cells were then cultured overnight at 37°C in a humidified 5%CC&gt;2 atmosphere. The next day cells were washed in fresh medium supplemented with biotinylated thrombin (3U/ml), and set aside. In separate plates a serial dilution of 240.gl was incubated in the presence of human recombinant IL-6 (50ng/ml; 3.84nM) and sIL-6R at a fixed concentration of 500ng/ml (10.15nM). In addition 240.gl was also incubated with human recombinant IL-17 (25ng/ml;1.18nM), which stimulates HUVECs to produce IL-6, and sIL-6R at a fixed concentration of 500ng/ml (10.15nM). The pre-mixed complex of 240.gl and IL-6/sIL-6R or IL-17/sIL-6R was then transferred to wells containing HUVECs which were incubated for 24 hours at 37°C in a humidified 5%CO2 atmosphere. After the incubation period cell free supernatant was collected and human MCP-1 levels determined by sandwich ELISA (protocol given below). The inhibition of rL-6/sIL-6R or IL-17/sIL-6R induced MCP-1 production by 240.gl was expressed as a percentage inhibition of wells treated with IL-6/sIL-6R or rL-17/sIL-6R minus control wells that contained cells but no stimuli. In addition controls were added to indicate the response of cells to the addition human TL-6 in the absence of sIL-6R.<br>

Nunc Maxisorp plates were coated with anti-MCP-l capture antibody at a concentration of 2[xg/ml. Plates were incubated at +4°C overnight then washed twice in PBS plus 0.1% tween20 (wash buffer). Plates were blocked for 1 hour in PBS plus 5% bovine serum<br>
albumin. Plates were then washed four times with wash buffer and standards and samples added. Plates were incubated for two hours at room temperature. Plates were then washed and biotinylated anti-MCP-l antibody added at a concentration of lmg/ml. Plates were incubated for a further 2 hours then washed four times. A 1:5000 dilution of streptavidin-HRP was then added and plates incubated for 30 minutes. Plates were washed a final four times and TMB substrate was added. Colourimetric readings were taken at 630nm and background readings at 492nm. MCP-1 concentrations were derived, from a standard curve using a four-parameter logistic curve fit, on Genesis II software.<br>
The activity of 240.gl against human recombinant IL-6 and sIL-6R induced trans-signallmg in HUVECs can be seen in Figure 3b. 240.gl potently inhibited human recombinant IL-6 and sIL-6R induced MCP-1 production by HUVECs. The ND50 was 64 ± 62 ng/ml (422 ± 409 pM).<br>
The activity of 240.gl against IL-17 induced endogenous IL-6 and sIL-6R induced trans-signalling in HUVECs can be seen in Figure 3c. 240.gl potently inhibited IL-17 induced endogenous IL-6 and sIL-6R induced MCP-1 production by HUVECs. The ND50 was 93 ± 70 ng/ml (614 ± 462 pM).<br>
Conclusion<br>
240.gl is capable of neutralising the bioactivity of human recombinant, human mammalian-derived, rhesus and cynomolgus but not mouse IL-6 in an IL-6 cz's-signalling assay. In addition 240.gl can neutralise IL-6 trans-signalling induced by either recombinant or endogenous IL-6. Example 6: In vivo activity<br>
IL-6 is known to induce acute phase proteins. In mice the most prominent acute phase protein is serum amyloid A (SAA). Human IL-6 is able to act on the mouse receptor so it is possible to inject human IL-6 into mice and measure SAA production in the serum.<br>
Balb/c mice were injected s.c. with the site 3 specific anti-hIL-6 antibody, CA030_240.gl whole IgG4. 24 hours later, mice were injected i.p. with hIL-6 at 30u-g/kg (Peprotech catalogue number 200-06, lot number 0203B16). After 20 hours the blood was taken by cardiac puncture and serum collected for assessment of serum amyloid A (SAA) by ELISA<br>
 (Tridelta lot number 22KT022). As noted in Figure 4, S AA induction by hIL-6 was inhibited by CA030_240.gl with statistically significant reduction in SAA being noted at doses of 0.3, 0.1 and 0.03mg/kg.<br>
n=7-8/group, except PBS n=6. Statistical analysis by ANOVA with Bonferroni post test, ** P
2 further experiments confirmed significant inhibition of IL-6 (30ug/kg)-induced SAA by CA030_240.gl at doses of 0.3 and 0.1 mg/kg.<br>
Example 7: CA030 Q0240.gl Epitope Mapping<br>
The epitope on human IL-6 that CA030_00240.gl recognises was mapped using NMR technology using 240.gl as a Fab' fragment. This required that human IL-6 was expressed in E. coli and uniformly labelled with 15N/13C/2H stable isotopes. Complete sequence-specific backbone resonance assignments were obtained for free IL-6 and changes in the position of these signals induced by the binding of the Fab' fragment of CA030_00240.gl were detected using a 3D TROSY HNCO spectrum.<br>
Expression and purification of recombinant human IL-6:<br>
Human IL-6 was prepared from an E. coli expression vector (pET3d) containing the coding sequence of the mature form of the protein. The protein was expressed in Tuner (DE3) pLysS ceUs, resulting in high yields of an insoluble product. 15N, 15N/13C and 15N/13C/2H labelled samples of IL-6 were prepared from cells grown on appropriately labelled rich media (Celtone).<br>
The IL-6 was purified from transformed E. coli cells using well established procedures. Initially, cells harvested from 11 of culture media were resuspended in 40 mL buffer A [100 mM KC1, 2 mM DTT, lOmM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 25 % (w/v) sucrose, disolved protease inhibitor tablet (Boehringer)]. 10 mL of buffer B [300 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5,100 mM EDTA, 4 mg/ml lysozyme] was added and the suspension incubated on ice for 10-30 minutes with occasional swirling.   50 ml of buffer C [1 M LiCl, 20 mM EDTA, 0.5 % (v/v) NP-40] was then added and the suspension put through the French Press twice at 20,000 psi. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 16,000g rpm for 15 minutes at 4 °C and the pellet retained. The pellet was resuspended in 40 ml buffer D [10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M LiCl, 0.5 % (v/v) NP-40,1 mM DTT, disolved protease tablet] and put through the French Press and centrifuged as before. This stage is repeated. The pellet is then<br>
 resuspend in 40 ml buffer E [10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 % (v/v) NP-40, 1 mM DTT, disolved protease tablet] and put through French Press and centrifuged as before. Repeat this stage. The final pellet is dissolved in 6 mL 6 M GuHCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and clarified by centrifugation at 48,000 g for 30 minutes at 4 °C. The supernatant is retained and the solubilised IL-6 quantified spectrophotometrically.<br>
The solubilised IL-6 diluted to 2.5 mg/rnL in 5 M GuHCl, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM GSH, 0.2 mM GSSG, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 and incubated at 25 °C for 1 hour. The samples was then further diluted, in a drop wise fashion to 250 |ig/mL in 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM GSH, 0.2 mM GSSG, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 and incubated 25 °C for 3 hours. Any precipitate formed at this stage is removed by centrifugation at 30,000 g for 30 minutes at 4 °C. The clarified material is dialysed against 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 % (v/v) glycerol, pH 9.0 for a minumum of 16 hours at 4 °C with two changes of buffer. After dialysis the solution is clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 g for 30 minutes at 4 °C. The supernatant is retained and loaded onto an 8 mL monoQ (Amersham Biosciences) ion exchange column and eluted with a linear gradient of sodium chloride (0-1.0 M). Fractions containing the refolded IL-6 were identified by SDS-PAGE and then pooled and difiltered into 25 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, 0.01 % (w/v) NaN3, pH 6.5.<br>
The Fab' fragment of CA030_00240.gl was generated, purified and formulated in 25 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, 0.01 % (w/v) NaN3, pH 6.5. The 1:1 complexes between IL-6 and the Fab' fragment of CA030_00240.gl was prepared for NMR analysis by mixing equimolar amounts of the proteins at a concentration of about 0.2 - 0.6 mM.<br>
NMR spectroscopy:<br>
The NMR experiments were carried out on 0.35 ml samples of the proteins and complexes in a 25 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM sodium chloride and 0.01% (w/v) sodium azide buffer at pH 6.5 (95% H2O and 5% D20). The 1:1 complex between 15N/l3C/2H labelled IL-6 and the unlabelled Fab' fragment of CA030 00240.gl was prepared for NMR analysis by mixing equimolar amounts of the proteins to achieve a final concentration of 0.1 mM. The NMR data were acquired at 25°C for free IL-6 and for the IL-6:Fab' fragment of CA030_00240.gl .. complex on a 800 MHz Bruker Avance spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance (15N/13C/1H) cryoprobe. Standard HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH and HNCO spectra (Wittekind, M., and Mueller, L. (1993) JMagn Reson, Series B 101(2), 201; Grzesiek, S., and Bax, A.<br>
 (1993) JBiomol NMR 3(2), 185-204; Muhandiram, D. R., and Kay, L. E. (1994) JMagn Reson, Series B 103(3), 203; Grzesiek, S., and Bax, A. (1992) JMagn Reson 96(2), 432) were used to make complete sequence-specific backbone resonance assignments (15N, 13C and !H) for free IL-6 using a 0.9 mM uniformly 15N/13C labelled sample.<br>
Changes in the positions of IL-6 backbone signals induced by Fab' fragment of CA030_00240.gl binding were detected using a 3D TROSYHNCO spectrum (Salzmann, M. et al, (1998) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 95(23), 13585-13590). Typical acquisition parameters for all the 3D NMR experiments are provided in table 1.<br>
All the spectra were processed using NMRPipe (Delaglio, F. et ah, (1995) JBiomol NMR 6(3), 277-293), with linear prediction used to extend the effective acquisition time in the 15N dimension of 3D data to about 30 ms. Mild resolution enhancement was applied in all dimensions using a shifted sine-squared function. Analysis of the spectra was carried out using Sparky (Goddard, T. D., and Kneller, D. G. SPARKY 3. In., University of California, San Francisco).<br>
Analysis of Fab binding data:<br>
The minhnal shift approach (Farmer, B. T. et al, (1996) Nat Struct Mol Biol 3(12), 995; Muskett, F. W. et al., (1998) J Biol Chem 273(34), 21736-21743) was used to determine the changes in the positions of IL-6 NMR signals resulting from Fab' fragment of CA030_00240.gl binding. Initially, all peaks hi the 3D HNCO spectrum of free IL-6 and 3D TROSYTTNCO spectrum of IL-6 bound to gl32E09 Fab were picked in their centres. The 15N and 1H chemical shift values of backbone resonances were corrected for the difference in temperature between spectra of the complex and free protein (-0.8 ppm for 15N and -0.05 ppm for 1H) (Baxter, N. J., and Williamson, M. P. (1997) JBiomol NMR 9(4), 359-369). The minimum change in position for peaks between free and Fab-bound IL-6 was obtained by using Microsoft Excel to calculate the combined chemical shift difference in 15N, 13C and lH for each assigned peak in the HNCO spectrum of the free protein compared to all observed peaks in TROSY-HNCO spectrum of Fab complex. The combined amide proton, nitrogen and carbon chemical shift differences (A5) were defined according to the following equation (Equation 1), where ∆δNH, ∆δN and A8c correspond to the differences in lH, 15N and 13C shifts between pairs of compared HNCO peaks and αN and αc are scaling factors of 0.2 and 0.33 required to account for differences in the range of amide proton, amide nitrogen and carbon<br>
 chemical shifts. For each individual HNCO peak, the minimal shift induced by Fab binding was taken as the lowest possible combined shift value (A5).<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
To identify the Fab binding sites (epitopes) on IL-6, a histogram of combined minimal shift versus protein sequence was used to reveal regions of IL-6 containing significantly perturbed signals. If the size of the combined chemical shift change for individual amino acids exceeded a threshold value of the mean of the combined chemical shift change for all the amino acids plus one standard deviation from that mean, these residues were selected for further evaluation as possible contact residues in the Fab binding site. The locations of candidate binding site residues were finally examined on the high resolution structure of IL-6 (Xu, G. Y.et al, (1997) JMol Biol 268(2), 468-481) and only residues positioned on the protein surface were considered to be available for Fab binding.<br>
Two different thresholds were applied to identify residues bound by the Fab, the mean minimal shift + 1SD (0.143) and the mean rmnimal shift +2SD (0.213). The binding site of the antibody was found to encompass the critical site 3 signature residue of Trpl57 (Boulanger et al, 2003, Science, 300, 2101-2104). Using the amino acid numbering used in Boulanger et ah, supra the antibody 240g.l was found to bind at least the following residues (mean+2SD (0.213)) S47, C50, E93, R104, F105, E106, T149, K150, A153, Q156, Q159 and S169. The antibody may bind all of the following residues (mean +1SD (0.143)) C44, S47, C50, S53, A58, E93, V96, R104, F105, E106, T149, K150, Q152, A153' Q154, N155, Q156, W157, Q159, T163, L165, S169 and E172.<br>
It will be appreciated that the same residues may also be numbered based on the amino acid numbering of the unprocessed precursor of IL-6 (Swiss Prot Accession number P05231). Using this numbering the antibody 240g.l binds to at least the following residues S75, C78, E121, R132, F133, E134, T177, K178, A181, Q182, Q187 and S197. The antibody may bind all of the following residues C72, S75, C78, S81, A86, E121, V124, R132, F133, E134, T177, K178, Q180, A181, Q182, N183, Q184, W185, Q187, T191, L193, S197 and E200.<br>
