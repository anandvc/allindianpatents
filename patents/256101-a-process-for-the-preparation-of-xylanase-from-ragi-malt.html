				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of xylanase<br>
from ragi malt.<br>
The invention is aimed at obtaining xylanase from ragi malt which yielded<br>
high activity.<br>
Xylanases (E.C.3.2.1.8) are hydrolases which depolymerize the xylan<br>
backbone of heteroxylans producing xylooligosaccharides varying in their<br>
degree of polymerization (D.P.2-10). Xylan is the major component of the<br>
plant cell walls especially hemicelluloses. Xylans differ structurally in their<br>
composition with respect to arabinose: xylose ratio, glucuronic acid and<br>
percentage of acetic and ferulic acids. Thus the enzymatic degradation of<br>
arabinoxylans to their monomers, i.e. xylose and arabinose is a complex<br>
process involving a battery of enzymes. Endoxylanase and p-xylosidase are<br>
the most important enzymes involved in xylan hydrolysis. Side chain<br>
cleaving enzymes such as ot-arabinofuranosidase, a-glucuronidase and<br>
acetyl xylan esterase play important roles in the removal of side substituents<br>
of heteroxylans. Subtituent groups in xylan are limiting factors in achieving<br>
the efficient hydrolysis of the substrate.<br>
The interest in xylanases has increased greatly in the past decade due to their<br>
potential biotechnological applications, especially in the paper industry. Due<br>
to their growing usage intensive investigations have been undertaken mainly<br>
with xylanolytic enzymes derived from mesophilic fungi and bacteria.<br>
However due to the environmental concern, disposal problems and safety<br>
aspects coming into forefront plant enzymes are being prefered over<br>
microbial enzymes due to the simple cost effective procedures for the<br>
preparation of starting material i.e. cereal malts. Xylanases from cereal malts<br>
are prefered due to their properties which are intermediate between fungal<br>
and bacterial xylanases. So there is ample scope for utilizing the cereal malts<br>
as a substituent for widely used microorganisms for obtaining xylan<br>
degrading enzymes.Ragi malt is used in infant, geriatric and health foods. It<br>
is having more xylanase activity compared to arabinase and 1,3/1,4 P-Dglucanase.<br>

Deconynck, M. and Delcour, J.A. Plant Physiol.1997, 113, 377-386 wherein<br>
xylanase was extracted from wheat flour and reported low activity, whereas,<br>
in the present invention xylanase was extracted from ragi malt to get high<br>
activity.<br>

low activity and used Azurine crosslinked (AZCL)- xylan which is a costly<br>
substrate, whereas, in the present invention Larchwood xylan is used as the<br>
substrate for the xylanase assay which is cost effective compared to AZCLxylan<br>
and yielded high activity.<br>
Reference may be made to Liu, W., Zhu, W., Lu,Y., KongJ. and Ma,G.<br>
Proc. Biochem., 1998, 38, 331-336 wherein they have isolated xylanase<br>
from Trichosporon cutaneum SL409 employing enrichment culture, which is<br>
costly, cumbersome, time consuming and involves the usage of more<br>
quantity of chemicals and reported low yield.<br>
Reference may be made to Sengupta et al, United States Patent, 6,569,646,<br>
May 27, 2003, Wherein they have isolated xylanase from culture broth of<br>
Termitomyces clypeatus having accession no. 11CB-411 and consumed<br>
costly media ingredients such as micronutrients, soya- peptone, ammonium<br>
nitrate and bacto peptone.<br>
Reference may be made to Ratanakhanokchai, K., Kyu, K.L., and<br>
Tanticharoen, M., 1999, 65, 694-697, wherein xylanase was isolated from<br>
the culture supernatant of Bacillus sp. Strain K-l, which involves the usage<br>
of costly culture media, viz, Berg's mineral salt media and Tris buffer<br>
whereas, in the present invention acetate buffer is used which is cost<br>
effective compared to Tris buffer and yielded high xylanase activity.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
preparation of xylanase from ragi malt which obviates the drawbacks as<br>
mentioned above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to use ragi, which is having at<br>
present low economic value compared to wheat, barley and microorganisms.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to have maximum xylanase<br>
activity by using acetate buffer which is cost effective compared to tris, MeS<br>
and phosphate buffers.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to use Larchwood xylan which<br>
is a cost effective substrate for xylanase assay.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of<br>
xylanase from ragi malt, which comprises the steps of:<br>
a) extracting ragi malt in acetate buffer having pH in a range of 4.5-6.0<br>
and ionic strength ranging from 0.05-0.2 M in order to obtain ragi malt<br>
extract;<br>
b) adding reduced glutathione, ionic detergent, phenolic adsorbent and<br>
metal ion to extract solution obtained in step (a) in order to obtain<br>
dispersed solution of ragi malt extract;<br>
c) stirring the dispersed solution of ragi malt extract obtained in step<br>
(b) fo a period in the range of 55-65 min consecutively for two times<br>
at a temperature in the range of 4- 6 degree C;<br>
d) centrifuging, the resultant extract obtained in step (c), at an angular<br>
speed in the range of 6000-7500 rpm for a period of 10- 20 min. at a<br>
temperature ranging from 4- 6 degree C in order to obtain the<br>
supernatant containing xylanase; AND<br>
e ) dialysing the supernatant containing xylanase obtained in step (d)<br>
against the extraction buffer at a temperature in the range of 4-6 degree<br>
C in order to to obtain the said xylanase.<br>
In one of the embodiments the reduced glutathione used in step (b) is<br>
at the concentration in the range of 2.5 to 10 mM.<br>
Another embodiment provides a process wherein the ionic detergent used<br>
in step (b) is preferably Triton X-100 at the concentration in the range of<br>
0.25 to 1 percent (v/v).<br>
Yet another embodiment provides a process wherein the phenolic<br>
adsorbent used in step (b) is preferably polyvinyl polypyrrolidine (PVPP) at<br>
the concentration in the range of 0.25 to 1 percent (v/v).<br>
Yet another embodiment provides a process, wherein the metal ion used<br>
in step (b) is preferably calcium chloride at the concentration in the range of<br>
5 to 20 mM (milli mole).<br>
Yet another embodiment provides a process, wherein the activity of<br>
xylanase obtained is in the range of 1.0-1.55 micro moles per minute<br>
estimated using Dinitro Salicylic acid (DNS) method.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention ragi malt is extracted<br>
twice to get the maximum activity.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention ragi malt extract is<br>
dialysed to remove salt and free sugars.<br>
Process in detail:<br>
In the present invention ragi malt was dispersed in acetate buffer (pH 4.5-<br>
6.0) of varying ionic strength (0.05-0.2 M) consisting of reduced glutathione<br>
(2.5- 10 mM), polyvinyl polypyrrolidine (0.25-1.0%), Triton X-100 (0.25-<br>
1.0 %), calcium chloride (5- 20 mM ) and magnesium chloride. (5- 20 mM).<br>
Extraction was carried out consecutively twice using a magnetic stirrer at<br>
4-6 degree C for 55-60 min. and centrifuged at 6000-7500 rpm at<br>
4-6 degree C for 10-20 min. to get the supernatant The supernatants of<br>
extraction 1&amp; 11 were pooled and dialysed against the acetate buffer<br>
overnight at 4-6 degree C. Dialysed supernatant was designated as the<br>
enzyme extract and assayed for xylanase activity. The enzyme extract was<br>
incubated with Larchwood xylan at 50°C for 1 h and xylanase activity was<br>
expressed as the reducing sugar liberated and estimated using dinitro<br>
salicylic acid (DNS) method.<br>
Novelty of the present invention:<br>
1) Use of ragi malt as a source of xylanase.<br>
2) Use of acetate buffer in combination with reducing agent, phenolic<br>
adsorbent, detergent and metal ion in a defined concentration to get<br>
high xylanase activity.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present<br>
invention and therefore should not be considered to limit the scope of<br>
the present invention.<br>

all the conditions constant as mentioned above. The supernatants obtained<br>
from first, second and third extractions were collected separately and<br>
dialysed overnight against 0.1 M acetate buffer, pH 6.0 at 4 degree C. The<br>
xylanase activity was determined by DNS (Dinitro salicylic acid) method<br>
