PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention concerns a shredder which has been specially designed to carry out the initial treatment of recyclable industrial waste such as tyres, aluminium frames, wood panels, domestic appliances, electronic scrap material, electric conductors etc. specifically at the shredding stage for subsequent separation of their components.<br>
The object of the invention is to obtain a practically universal shredder, that is, one which is able to shred a varied selection of materials, according to their nature and size, with minimum wear of the cutting tools and with easy maintenance, with the addition of excellent performance from a functional or operational perspective.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There are various different types of shredders on the market which are mainly restricted in terms of the fact that each is designed for a specific type of product to be shredded, so that if the specific application is changed for any reason or if there is a need to shred different types of products in the shredder, its performance is reduced, and greater maintenance is required, resulting from breakage or premature wear of the cutting tools, which leads to stoppages in the production process with the associated exploitation costs that this entails.<br>
There are also problems in shredding large scale objects such as agricultural tyres, or those used in civil engineering work<br>
Another frequent problem is the agglomeration of material to be shredded in the shredding chamber due to the effect of the force applied to the cutting tools which then causes the machine to jam.<br>
-2-<br><br>
The maintenance operations for changing the cutting tools tend to be slow and laborious and in addition, wear, mechanical deformation, dirtiness of the shredding zone and fitting parts which need to be changed, considerably hinder replacement operations.<br>
There is a high level of wear in specific components of the machines, particularly in the shredding zone, such as metal plates, rotor, etc.<br>
All this leads to a low shredding capacity in these machines, as in order to avoid mechanical deformation or considerable wear, it is necessary to work at low power and as a result the shredding capacity is similarly diminished.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The shredder proposed in this invention resolves in a fully satisfactory manner all<br>
the various aspects mentioned in the problems expressed above.<br>
Therefore, in a more specific manner and using the basic structure of a conventional shredder, which includes a hopper which holds the recyclable waste, the base of which contains a duly motorised rotor, the characteristics of this shredder are based fundamentally on the aforementioned rotor, and more specifically on the cutting elements which are included and which collaborate with it. constituting the actual shredding elements which act with a "scissors" effect, maximising the effectiveness of the shredder.<br>
Specifically, on one of the sides of the lower opening of the hopper, the one on which rotor blades act at the outlet of the hopper, there are a number of fixed blades, distributed with a convenient distance between each other in order to permit the moving blades associated with the rotor to pass between them, and which have two significant characteristics, on one hand, their upper or operating edges are set at different heights so that by means of an alternating arrangement in respect to higher<br>
-3-<br><br>
or lower blades, optimum distribution of effort is achieved, the cutting effect does not occur simultaneously on all of them but first on one half and then the other, which for the same applied power results in a greater effectiveness and capacity of shredding, while at the same time, and complementary to this effect, these fixed blades are attached by means of screws, the heads of which are embedded in the blades themselves, and therefore those heads are not subject to any wear or mechanical deformation and thus in turn this considerably facilitates their dismantling during maintenance tasks.<br>
These blades also have various useful surfaces, so that by simply changing their position, their useful life may be extended with the consequent reduction in maintenance costs.<br>
In accordance with another of the characteristics of the invention, the power is applied to the rotor by two identical motors which, by means of reducing gears which are also identical, transmit movement to the drive axle on both ends in a completely homogeneous manner, thus avoiding asymmetric wear of the gears.<br>
Each motor is coupled to the corresponding gear by means of an elastic coupling which avoids any problems due to "knocking" between the rotor and the shredder stator which may occur during shredding.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
In order to complete the present description and to help provide a better understanding of the characteristics of the invention, in accordance with a preferential example of the practical embodiment of the same, a set of drawings is attached hereto by way of illustration as an integral part of this description and in no way restrictively, representing the following:<br>

Figure 7 - Shows a plan view and a section of a fixed blade.<br>
Figure 8 - Shows a similar representation to figure 7 but that corresponding to a<br>
moving blade.<br>
PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the light of the figures indicated it may be seen how the shredder proposed in this invention incorporates the essential hopper (1) for depositing the industrial waste to be shredded, with a lateral groove (2) at its opening which facilitates the deposit of the waste inside the hopper (1) which, together with its accompanying mechanisms, rests on a bedplate (3) which appropriately elevates it above ground, a maintenance platform (4) being located next to it which is accessed with a step ladder (5).<br>
In the lower opening of the hopper (1) the rotor (6) is located, which receives movement from both ends, supplied by the respective electric motors (7-7*) which, by means of elastic couplings (8-81) supply movement to the mechanical and symmetrical reducing gears (9-9'), the axle arrangement of which is schematically represented in figure 2, reducing gears (9-91) which are finally and by means of mechanical rigid couplings (10-10'), fixed to the respective ends of the axle (11) of the rotor (6).<br>
-5-<br><br>
In the lower opening (12) of the hopper (1), where the rotor (6) operates and specifically in one of the edges parallel to this, there are a number of fixed blades (13) such as the blade represented in detail in figure 7, which are attached by means of screws which pass though holes (14) and whose heads are embedded in the blades themselves (13) specifically in widenings (15) of those holes (14) so that the heads will remain clear of the working area of the shredder, and perfectly protected in the groove (15).<br>
These fixed blades (13) are uniformly distributed along the edge of the entrance (12) to the hopper (1), leaving empty spaces between each other (16) for the passage of the moving blades (17), which shall be described 5 below.<br>
In addition, and as may be seen in figure 6. the fixed blades (13) are set at different heights, so that the moving blades (17) firstly attack one half of the fixed blades (13) and immediately after attack the other half, so that as the blades (13 ) of one and the other height are alternately arranged as may be seen in figure 6, an improvement the cutting effect is achieved, specifically the aforementioned "scissors" effect, as at all times a moving blade (17) acts on a fixed blade (13) and subsequently on the other.<br>
Returning once more to the moving blades (17), these are mounted on the front of the respective supports (18) in the form of a half moon, duly attached to the rotor (6) so that the moving blades (17) are noticeably parallel to the fixed blades (13) at the moment of cutting, with the aforementioned moving blades (17) attached to their supports (18) by means of screws (19) the heads of which are equally embedded and protected inside the blades, thus not being subject to any wear or mechanical deformation.<br>
The moving blades (17) are also mounted slightly out of phase as may be seen specifically in figure 4 in order to participate in the aforementioned "scissors" effect.<br>
-6-<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
