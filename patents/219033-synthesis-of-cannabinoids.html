COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"SYNTHESIS OF CANNABINOIDS"<br>
JOHNSON MATTHEY PUBLIC LIMITED COMPANY, a British body corporate of 2-4 Cockspur Street, Trafalgar Square, London SWIY 5BQ, United Kingdom,<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the    nature    of   the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a novel process that can be used to produce (-)-A -tetxahydrocannibinol and related cannibinoid compounds.    The invention further 5 relates to novel compounds used in the process.<br>
(-)-A9-TetrahydrocannibinoI (A9-THC) is the active ingredient in marijuana. It is used therapeutically as an inhalant or an "oral drug for stimulation of appetite among AIDS and cancer chemotherapy patients. Related carmibinoid compounds that show llo pharmacological activity are also known. In particular, there have been attempts to produce water soluble analogues of A9-THC ('The Total synthesis of Cannibinoids' in The Total Synthesis of Natural Products, Vol 4, John ApSirnon, Wiley, 1981, pp 239-243).<br><br><br>
A9-THC<br><br>
	The chemical synthesis and isolation of A9-THC are both challenging. A9-THC<br>
is a very high boiling, viscous liquid. It is very prone to acid-catalysed isomerization to the thermodynamically more stable A* isomer, it is easily oxidized by oxygen to inactive cannibinol, and it is sensitive to light and heat.   All of these factors make<br>
purification difficult, especially on an  industrial scale, and  chromatography has 2i   generally been used.<br>
29<br>
2<br><br>
WO 0 W6S99<br><br><br><br>
Previous syntheses of A9-THC have tended to be either lengthy or low-yielding. Most involve coupling of a chira! terpene to a resorcinol derivative. The primary difficulty has been lack of selectivity in the coupling. Acid catalysed couplings have generally led to mixtures of products (Crombie et al, J Chem Soc. Perkin Trans. I 1988 k 1243). Attempts to avoid the selectivity problem by using base-catalysed coupling reactions have involved lengthier syntheses overall (Rickards et al, J. Org. Chem. 1984 49 572). Syntheses not using chiral terpenes have yielded racemic product (Childers et al, J: Org. Chem. 1984 49 5276),<br>
	In seemingly the best known method (US 5,227,537), Stoss claims that acid-<br>
catalysed coupling of (+)-/?-menth-2-ene-l,8-diol (1) with olivetol (2) can be stopped at the intermediate Friedel-Crafts product (3), and then the intermediate (3) can be isolated and converted in good yield to A9-THC using ZnBr2 (24 hours, reflaxing CH2CI2). The present inventors have encountered several problems with this scheme.<br>
lfc The initial /Holuenesulfonic acid catalysed Friedel-Crafts reaction was difficult to stop cleanly at the intermediate (3) under Stoss' conditions and gave mixtures of the intermediate (3) and A9-THC, the ring-closed product. Any A9-THC formed is likely to isomerize to A8-THC under the disclosed conditions. The use of a heavy metal such as ZnBr2 in the last step of an industrial process is highly undesirable as it may lead to<br>
 traces of metal in the product, and this is especially undesirable for pharmaceuticals. Stoss' method therefore appears to offer no real advantage in yield or purity of A -THC over a one-pot coupling that goes directly to A9-THC. Razdan has published a one-pot method for coupling of (+)-p-menth-2-ene-l,8-diol (1) with olivetol (2) to produce A -THC (Razdan et al, Tet. Lett. 1983 24 3129). This also suffers from several problems:<br>
 it uses nearly 14 equivalents of ZnC2 as the acid, and uses six equivalents of olivetol (2). Even under these conditions, the yield is still only 28% from (+)-p-menth-2-ene-1,8-diol (1).<br><br><br><br>
OH<br>
(1)<br>
3<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Thus there is a need for a short, practical, high-yielding synthesis of A9-THC that can be practised on an industrial scale. This is the problem that the present inventors have set out to address.<br>
fi	Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the production of a<br>
compound of general formula A:<br><br><br>
3       Compound A<br><br>
wherein Rc, Rd and Rc are independently H, alkyl, or substituted alkyl; and RL to R4 are independently H, OH, OR' (R' is alkyl, aryl, substituted alkyl or aryl, silyl, acyl, or iui phosphonate), alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, acyl, halide, amine, nitrate, sulphonate or phosphonate; comprising reacting compound B with compound C:<br><br><br><br>
5j wherein Ra is H, alkyl, aryl, acyl or silyl; Rb is alkyl, aryl or acyl; Rc, Rd, Rc and R1 to R4 are as hereinbefore defined; and comprising, when necessary, a ring closure reaction.<br>
4<br><br>
:<br><br><br><br>
:<br><br><br>
Preferably the reaction of compound B with compound C is carried out in the presence of an acid catalyst.<br>
A substituted alkyl group may contain substituents such as halide, hydroxy!,      amine and thiol. Alkyl groups may be saturated or unsaturated, acyclic or cyclic.<br>
Compound B is similar to the (+)-P-menth-2-ene-l,8-diol used in the Stoss method. However, compound B is not a diol, and contains one or more ether or ester groups. R is alkyl, aryl or acyl, and preferably Ra is independently alkyl, aryl or acyl. 10<br>
In a preferred embodiment, Rb is acyl, and ORb is an ester group. Suitable ester groups include . acetate, propionate, butyrate, trimethylacetate, phenyl acetate, phenoxyacetate, diphenylacetate, beazoate, p-nitrobenzoate, phthalate and succinate.<br>
15	In an especially preferred embodiment both Ra and Rb are acyl groups so that<br>
compound B is a diester. The two ester groups are suitably chosen independently from acetate, propionate, butyrate, trimethylacetate, pheny (acetate, phenoxyacetate, diphenylacetate, benzoate, p-nitrobenzoate, phthalate and succinate. An especially preferred compound has ORa = ORb = diphenylacetate:<br><br>
Rc, Rd and Rc can be varied independently of Rs and Rb and will affect the structure of the product, compound A. Rc is suitably Me or H, preferably Me. R and Rc are suitably Me or CH2OH, preferably Me.<br><br>
-      $-<br>
25-NOV-2333 21 = 25	2115 9242327	97%	<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Compound C is a phenolic compound and is preferably a resorcinol derivative such as olivetol (3).<br>
R   is preferably OR" wherein R" is H, alky], substituted aikyl, acy] or silyl $ Most preferably R' is OH.<br>
Preferably, R2 and R4 are H.<br>
R   is suitably an alkyl  group or substituted alky! group.     In a preferred     embodiment, R3 is CsH11-    R3 may contain groups that promote water solubility, eg ketone, ester, hydroxyl or amine groups.   In one embodiment of the invention, RJ contains a thioketa] (this can be further converted to an aldehyde).<br>
Most preferably, compound C is olivetol (3), wherein R1 is OH, R2 is H, R3 is « C5H11 and R4 is H.<br>
Suitably, one equivalent of compound B is reacted with approximately one equivalent of compound C.<br>
	In a preferred embodiment of the invention compound B is an ether or ester of<br>
(+)-Jp-menth-2-ene-l,8-diol (Rc = Me, Rd = Me, Re = Me), compound C is olivetol (R1 = OH, R2 = H, R3 = CsH11, H4 = H) and the product, compound A, is 69-THC.<br><br><br><br>
The present invention therefore provides a novel synthesis of A'-THC.<br>
The present invention provides both a one-step and a two-step process for the production of compound A. In the one-step process the reaction of compound B and compound C produces compound A directly.   In the one-step process, suitably about<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
one equivalent of acid catalyst is used, eg between 0.8 to 1.5 equivalents.  Preferably the reaction is carried out below 0CC, most preferably from -20°C to 0°C.<br>
In the two-step process the reaction of compound B and compound C produces a ring-opened product, compound D:<br><br>
B	C	Compound D<br>
For the two-step process, suitably less than one equivalent of acid is used, preferably from 0.1 to 0.5 equivalents. Preferably the reaction is carried out below 0°C, more    preferably below -10°C. A ring closure step is then carried out. Suitable reagents for the ring closure step include acids such as BF3.(OEt)2 or TsOH. One possible advantage of the two-step process is that if compound D is a crystalline solid, purification of the intermediate is straightforward and this may lead to higher purity in the final product, compound A.<br><br>
The present invention provides one-step and two-step syntheses that can be used<br>
to produce A9-THC.   The syntheses show improved selectivity and yield compared to<br>
prior art methods. The amount of isomers generated is small and purification is simple.<br>
The phenolic reactant (compound C) is not used in excess.   The process is suitable for<br>
       scale-up to an industrial process.<br>
Preferably the yield of the synthesis of A9-THC is greater than 50%, more<br>
preferably the yield is greater than 75%.   The process also provides high purity A -<br>
THC.    Preferably A9-THC is obtained in greater than 70% purity, more preferably<br>
35 greater than 90% purity.   Methods known in the art can be used to further purify the<br>
products of the reaction.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The process of the present invention is suitably carried out in a polar aprotic solvent, preferably methylene chloride.<br>
Suitable acid catalysts include most Lewis acids. Non-metallic catalysts such as  BF3.0Et2 and toluenesulfonic acid are preferred. Non-metallic catalysts offer advantages over the zinc catalysts used in the Stoss and Razdan methods because there is no possibility of a metal residue in the product. BF3.0Et2 is preferred because it is easily removed from the reaction mixture, and is less prone to causing isomerisation of A -THC to A -THC than p-TsOH. Suitably about one equivalent of catalyst or less is    used, eg 0.1 to 1.5 equivalents. This offers a clear improvement over Ra2dan's method where 14 equivalents of acid are used.<br>
Procedures for isolating the product, compound A, from the reaction mixture<br>
are well known to those in the art. Chromatography can be used to purify the product.<br>
5<br>
Certain compounds of structure B are novel and are particularly advantageous when used in the presenr invention. Compounds wherein both ORa and ORb are chosen independently from acetate, propionate, butyrate, trimethylacetate, phenylacetate, phenoxyacetate, diphenylacetate, benzoate,P-nitrobenzoate, phthalate and succinate    (provided that only one of OR3 and OR is acetate) represent a further aspect of this invention. Preferably the groups are chosen so that compound B is a solid. Preferably both OR1 and ORb are diphenylacetate. Preferably, R; Rd and Rc are Me.<br>
Compound B can be produced by a variety of methods. Compounds wherein R3 2|5 - H or silyl can be prepared by the ring-opening of epoxides (5) with an alcohoI, a carboxylic acid or silylated derivatives of alcohols and carboxylic acids. Reactions of this type are described in a co-pending patent application by the present inventors.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Compounds wherein Ra and R6 are both the same can be produced by base catalysed reaction of the corresponding diol (6) with anhydrides or chlorides.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Re    OH<br><br>
Re     ORa<br><br>
5	Compounds wherein R3 is not H or silyl and wherein Ra and Rb are different can<br>
be produced by base-catalysed reaction of mono-ethers or mono-esters (7) with ethers or chlorides.<br><br><br><br><br>
RC    OH<br><br>
