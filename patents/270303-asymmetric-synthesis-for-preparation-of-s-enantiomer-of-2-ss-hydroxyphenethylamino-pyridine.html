The present invention still further relates to compositions containing the novel isomers of Phenyramidol.<br>
Background and prior art of the Invention:<br>
Formula I<br>
2<br>
Phenyramidol (also known as Fenyramidol or IN 511 or MJ 505) is a drug attributed for its analgesic and muscle relaxant property. Chemically, Phenyramidol of formula I is<br><br><br>
2-((b-hydroxyphenethylamino)pyridine. The molecular formula for Phenyramidol is Ci3H14N20. Preparation of Phenyramidol was first described in 1959 in Journal of American Chemical society. Phenyramidol is indicated for treatment of several types of pain.<br>
Pain is often classified under various categories e.g. acute and chronic; nociceptive and neuropathic; pain accompanying inflammation (secondary to tissue injury); visceral (smooth muscle) pain and pain (body ache) associated with fever (Temperature) etc.<br>
Pain is defined by the 'International Association for the study of Pain' as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage. Under normal circumstances pain is a result of stimulation of peripheral receptors which transmit impulses to the brain through pain pathway. Early treatment of pain is important as unrelieved pain can have profound psychological effect on the patient.<br>
Opium is one of the most ancient pain reliever known to man however both habituation propensity and the addiction potential of opium are well known.<br>
The search for safe, effective and non habituating analgesic has been everlasting and continues even today, in 21st Century. Many drugs pertaining to pure analgesic or analgesic with anti pyretic /anti inflammatory activity; analgesic and muscle relaxant activity etc have been invented with varied degree of claims on superiority and safety. This range includes NSAIDS, COX-2 inhibitors, Aspirin, Codeine and its derivatives, Morphine and its derivatives, Caffeine and even Corticosteroids to relieve head aches; etc.<br>
Serious Side effects, including fatal episodes with COX-2 inhibitors have raised some serious thoughts in medicinal research community regarding development of New Chemical Entities (NCEs) for analgesic, anti-inflammatory, muscle relaxant and antipyretic therapeutic segment.<br>
3<br><br>
For past few years, the attention is directed towards search for new therapeutic indications from existing products and/or to examine already existing old racemic molecules for their isomers for enhanced therapeutic activity.<br>
Phenyramidol (2- {beta-hydroxyphenethylamino}- pyridine) introduced originally as an analgesic has shown excellent skeletal muscle relaxant activity at very low doses when used parentally as well as orally. Phenyramidol is unique in its biological effects in that, it possesses measurable analgesic and muscle relaxant properties.<br>
Of equal importance is the fact that other central effects observed with other analgesics or muscle relaxant drugs (such as sedation, euphoria, and mental confusion) have not been apparent in pharmacological studies of Phenyramidol. The analgesic activity of Phenyramidol is of the order of Codeine and its muscle relaxant activity can abolish abnormal muscle tone without impairing normal neuromuscular function.<br>
Phenyramidol molecule has an asymmetric carbon (Chiral centre) centre and possesses optical activity. Presently this molecule is used as it is in form of a 'racemic' mixture and till date no effort has been made to resolve and subject its individual isomers to therapeutic evaluation for existing or new indications.<br>
Dosage forms like tablets, capsules and injections are manufactured using racemic Phenyramidol and they are actively promoted as safe and effective analgesic and muscle relaxant. Since its first introduction in 1959 Phenyramidol has been actively promoted in Turkey, Greece, Philippines, and EU markets by different Companies under different brand names and has not shown any untoward side effects, despite the use over past decades.<br>
US patent 4,168,308 discloses a composition for enhancing parenteral administration comprising a stable, oil-in-water emulsion containing a pharmacologically inert lipoid as a hydrophobic phase dispersed in a hydrophilic phase and an effective dose of a pharmacologically active, oil-soluble agent predominantly dissolved in said lipoid at a fraction ratio thereto in the hydrophobic phase. The oil-soluble pharmacological agent is a muscle relaxant from the compounds of Phenyramidol.<br>
4<br><br>
GB1229967 discloses pharmaceutical compositions for enteral, parenteral and intranasal application comprise an oil-soluble therapeutic and/or diagnostic agent dispersed in a diluent comprising an emulsion or dispersion of a pharmaceutically inert lipid and water, at least 50% by weight of the active material being in the lipid phase. Numerous types of medicaments are mentioned and examples relate to preparations comprising Phenyramidol, hexobarbital, hexyl ether, mecamylamine and quinidine.<br>
Chiral Chemisty of all kind from kinetic resolution to asymmetric synthesis, chiral chromatographic separation, racemisation and stereochemical inversion, to name a few -have formed the most dynamic subsection of the Research Activity involved in the development of New Chemical Entities.<br>
There are no prior Art relating to the L- or D- isomers of Phenyramidol or the process for their resolution or for their chiral synthesis in patent literature.<br>
Object of the Invention:<br>
Inspite of Phenyramidol being a 1959 molecule, no chiral synthesis or characterization and therapeutic evaluation of optical enantiomers of Phenyramidol have been reported or attempted till date. In this invention we have met this long felt need for patient benefit.<br>
The object of the present invention relates to (R) and (S) Styrene Oxide based Asymmetric Synthesis for production of novel Phenyramidol isomers. These R and S enantiomers of Phenyramidol have been synthesized and characterized for the first time.<br>
Another object of the present invention is the use of (R) and (S)-Styrene Oxide during Asymmetric Synthesis Process providing enantiomers of Phenyramidol with high chiral purity.<br>
In yet another object as per the present invention a process for isolation of 98% pure R-isomer of Phenyramidol is provided.<br>
5<br><br>
As per another object of the present invention, the (R) and (S)-Styrene Oxide based Asymmetric Synthesis Process provides huge advantages, including more effective use of starting material, less formation of unwanted product and requires milder conditions of operation with less energy consumption and lower pressure requirements.<br>
Further object of the invention is the use of multi-step lab scale processes to ensure cost effective practical manufacturing models to transfer the technology from Lab scale to kilos and to tons of final product have been carried out which provides therapeutic benefits as well as economic cost benefit.<br>
Still, further object of invention is clinical evaluation of R and S enantiomers of Phenyramidol for enhanced therapeutic benefits.<br>
Compositions' containing the novel isomers of Phenyramidol is another object of the present invention.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>

Description of the Invention:<br>
The present invention describes an (R) and (S) Styrene Oxide based Asymmetric Synthesis for production of novel Phenyramidol isomers with high chiral purity. These R and S enantiomers of Phenyramidol have been synthesized and characterized for the first time.<br>
Phenyramidol molecule has an asymmetric carbon (Chiral centre) centre and possesses<br>
optical activity. This observation, lead the inventors of the present invention to arrive at a<br>
new important possibility of development of a molecule which can be explained as<br>
follows:<br>
i) The Greater part of therapeutic action of Phenyramidol is likely to be by the virtue of<br>
either of its Laevo- rotatory OR its Dextro- rotatory enantiomeric form since both being<br>
present in active pharmaceutical ingredient [API] of racemic Phenyramidol.<br>
ii) Segregation of the Laevo and Dextro enantiomers from Phenyramidol API and<br>
subjecting the    same    to    in-vitro/in-vivo    studies    (Animal    -Toxicological    and<br>
Pharmacodynamic, Phased Clinical studies) to scientifically confirm that a particular<br>
laevo or dextro form shows better therapeutic activity.<br>
The inventors of the present invention employed (R) and (S) Styrene Oxide based Asymmetric Synthesis for production of Chiral Phenyramidol isomers. Use of (R) and (S)-Styrene Oxide during Asymmetric Synthesis Process provides with enantiomers of high chiral purity.<br>
The following examples, which include preferred embodiments, will serve to illustrate the practice of this invention, it being understood that the particulars shown are by way of example and for purpose of illustrative discussion of preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
Process for synthesis of (-)-Phenyramidol:-<br>
1 mole of 2-aminopyridine is dissolved in dimethylformamide at 0-30°C and added to<br>
0.8-2.0 Moles of lithium amide, suspended in dimethylformamide at 0-50°C. The pH of<br>
the reaction mass is basic to very highly basic.<br>
After complete addition, the reaction mixture is stirred at 0-20°C for 10-60 minutes. Subsequently, the temperature is maintained between 25 to 80°C.<br>
Then, 1-1.5 moles of (R)-styreneoxide is added drop wise at 0-100°C. The Reaction mass is then stirred at 0-100°C for 1- 7 hr. After 1-7 hr dimethylformamide is distilled under reduced pressure. Water is added to the reaction mass at 0-90°C and is extracted with an organic solvent added at 0-90°C. The organic layer is separated, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and evaporated under vacuum to get red coloured viscous liquid, which solidifies with time.<br>
Specific Rotation: [&amp;] = -40.29 (c=0.5, methanol) Yield: 45%-90%<br>
The above synthesis was performed in different solvents such as N-methyl -2-pyrollidone (NMP), tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), dimethylacetamide (DMA) instead of dimethylformamide. The above synthesis was also tried out with sodium amide in liquid ammonia.<br>
The crude product is crystallized from either toluene or benzene or xylene or aqueous methanol or ethanol.<br>
Chiral HPLC Purity :&gt; 96% [&amp;] = - 34.7 (c=0.5, methanol) [d] = -190.9 (c=0.8, chloroform)<br>

0.8-2.0 Moles of lithium amide, suspended in dimethylformamide at 0-50°C.<br>
After complete addition, the reaction mixture is stirred at 0-20°C for 10-60 minutes. Subsequently, the temperature is maintained between 25 to 80°C.<br>
Then, 1-1.5 moles of (S)-styrene oxide is added drop wise at 0-100°C. The Reaction mass is then stirred at 0-100°C for 1- 7 hr. After 1-7 hr dimethylformamide is distilled under reduced pressure. Water is added to the reaction mass and is extracted with an organic solvent. The organic layer is separated, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and evaporated under vacuum to get red coloured viscous liquid, which solidifies with time.<br>
Specific Rotation: [d] = +36.29 (c=0.5, methanol) Yield: 70%-90%<br>
The above synthesis was performed in different solvents such as N-methyl -2-pyrollidone (NMP), tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), dimethylacetamide (DMA) instead of dimethylformamide. The above synthesis was also tried out with sodium amide in liquid ammonia.<br>
The crude product is crystallized from either toluene or benzene or xylene or aqueous methanol or ethanol.<br>
Chiral HPLC Purity :&gt; 96% [d] = +35.2 (c=0.5, methanol) [d] = +152.9 (c=0.5, chloroform)<br>
