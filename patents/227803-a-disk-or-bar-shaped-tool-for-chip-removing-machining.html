				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a disk- or bar-shaped tool for chip-removing machining,<br>
in particular for cutting profiles in a workpiece such as a rotationally driven<br>
crankshaft to be machined, having several peripheral cutting inserts radially<br>
clamped to a tool mount.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Disk-shaped high-speed tools are described in EP 0,830,228 which are driven<br>
such that material is machined off at rotation speeds above 160 RPM. In<br>
particular when machining a crankshaft and in particular for forming undercuts,<br>
disk millers are used where the tool mounts, to whose periphery the cutting<br>
inserts are radially clamped, are formed as complete circular disks. During<br>
external milling of a crankshaft, both the crankshaft and the milling tool are<br>
rotated.<br>
In a single rotary system a linear tool is radially moved toward the rotating<br>
workpiece. In a double rotary system a row of cutting inserts carried on a part-<br>
circular periphery of a flat tool mount are indexed along a drum periphery. This<br>
tool is moved along an arc radially toward the rotating workpiece as described in<br>
principal in EP 0,313,644 or EP 0,286,771. Both in the single rotary system as<br>
well as with disk millers or in the double rotary system using radially clamped<br>
cutting inserts, as for example having the shape shown in WO 99/12686, there is<br>
in the constructions known from the prior art no possibility of axial and radial fine<br><br>
adjustment. Manufacturing tolerance alone in the tools and tool mounts thus<br>
produce production errors.<br>
The German Patent DE 10027945 discloses a side-milling cutter (15, 16) for<br>
machining cylindrical contours On a workpiece, in particular a crankshaft (10).<br>
Said cutter comprises several cutting inserts, titled at an axial angle of inclination<br>
(x), arranged on the periphery of a disc-shaped tool carrier. One part of said<br>
inserts is mounted radially and the other part of said inserts tangentially on the<br>
tool carrier.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a tool that allows axial and/or radial<br>
adjustment of the cutting inserts radially clamped to the tool mount. This tool<br>
should be simple in construction and easy to use.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
This object is attained by a tool in which at least one cutting insert is fixed in a<br>
cassette-shape holder and the cassette-shaped holder is axially adjustable by<br>
means of an adjustment wedge near where it bears on the cutting inset and/or is<br>
radially adjustable by an adjustment wedge. The cutting inserts, which need to<br>
be axially and/or radially adjusted, are each mounted on a cassette-shaped<br>
holder (and not as in the prior art directly on the tool mount), and this holder is<br>
axially and/or radially adjustable by the adjustment wedge.<br><br>
According the invention provides a disk- or bar-shaped tool for chip-removing<br>
machining, in particular for cutting profiles in a workpiece such as a rotationally<br>
driven crankshaft to be machined, having several peripheral cutting inserts<br>
radially clamped to a tool mount, at least one cutting insert is fixed in a cassette-<br>
shaped holder. The cassette-shaped holder is axially adjustable by means of<br>
adjustment wedge near where it bears on the cutting insert and /or is radially<br>
adjustable by an adjustment wedge, the cassette-shaped holder comprises a<br>
doubly bent shape with an upper part having a front face forming the support<br>
surface for the cutting insert and a back face bearing on an adjustment wedge,<br>
and a lower part extending parallel to but being offset from the upper part fixed<br>
on the disk-shaped mount by means of a mounting screw passing through a<br>
bore, the upper and lower parts being connected by a central transverse web,<br>
and the adjustment wedge can shift the upper part into different axial positions<br>
by bending.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention and further features are described in the<br>
dependent claims.<br>
In particular the cassette-shaped holder has a doubly bent shape with an upper<br>
part having front face forming the support surface for the cutting insert and a<br>
back face bearing on an adjustment wedge, and a lower part extending parallel<br>
to but offset from the upper part is fixed on the disk-shaped mount by means of<br><br>
a mounting screw passing through a bore, the upper and lower parts being<br>
connected by a central transverse web. The adjustment wedge can shift the<br>
upper part into different axial positions by bending. The Z-shape of the cassette-<br>
shaped part produces a certain elasticity so that the upper part of this holder can<br>
pivot to a certain extent about an axis passing generally through the transverse<br>
web. Since the cutting insert if fixed on the upper part of the cassette-shaped<br>
holder, it is thus pivotal. Preferably the axial range of adjustment is between 0.1<br>
mm and 0.3 mm, which can be ensured by the material and the geometric shape<br>
of the cassette-shaped holder. The upper limit lies well below the amount that<br>
would create plastic deformation of the cassette-shaped holder.<br>
For mounting on the disk-shaped tool mount, the lower part of the cassette-<br>
shaped holder has a threaded bore into the rear of which engages a screw<br>
seated in the tool mount. Preferably a cap screw is used that is screwed into the<br>
lower part of the cassette-shaped holder from the back.<br>
Should only or additionally a radial adjustment of the cutting tool be desired,<br>
there is an adjustment wedge that bears on a lower side face of the holder and<br>
that is movable to effect a radial adjustment of the holder. According to the<br>
change is position of this adjustment wedge, the cassette and its cutting insert<br>
are radially shifted.<br>
Preferably, the lower part of the cassette-shaped holder has a stepped bore<br>
accommodating a shaft and a head of a mounting screw head bears with a face<br>
on a complementary shoulder of the bore. A shaft of the mounting screw<br><br>
engages in a threaded bore of the disk-shaped tool mount. Unlike the above-<br>
described embodiment, the clamping screw is fitted from the front side into the<br>
lower part of the cassette-shaped holder and is threaded into a complementary<br>
bore of the disk-shaped tool mount until it is tight.<br>
The adjustment wedge preferably has a throughgoing threaded bore receiving a<br>
threaded end of a double-threaded screw whose other end is engaged in a<br>
threaded bore of the disk-shaped tool mount. Rotation of this double-threaded<br>
screw can thus change the relative positions of the adjustment wedge and the<br>
cassette-shaped holder.<br>
To clamp the cassette-shaped holder in place there is a counter screw that<br>
engages in a stepped bore of the disk-shaped tool mount and a threaded blind<br>
bore in a back face of the upper part of the cassette-shaped support.<br>
To further improve exact position of the cutting insert, according to a further<br>
embodiment of the invention the mounting screw for clamping the cassette-<br>
shaped holder 12 bears with axially and/or radial prestress on the disk- or bar-<br>
shaped tool mount.<br>
Preferably the cutting insert is indexable and has a PKD insert.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention in additional to the radial<br>
clamped cutting inserts on the disk-shaped tool mount there is at least one<br>
tangentially clamped cutting insert or a bar-shaped tool mount carries on its<br>
upper edge a clamped cutting insert. This additional cutting insert that is<br><br>
tangentially clamped or clamped to the upper edge is radially adjustable for<br>
working the outer surface profile of a workpiece, in particular for machining the<br>
outer surfaces of the crank pins of a crankshaft. This or these cutting inserts are<br>
also radially adjustable.<br>
Preferably, the tangentially or upper-edge mounted cutting insert is fixed in a<br>
cassette that is mounted in a tool-count seat and is adjustable raidally by an<br>
adjustment wedge. To position the cassette and its cutting insert radially there is<br>
at least one adjustment wedge. There is also preferably a clamping wedge for<br>
holding the cassette in place.<br>
The clamping wedge and/or the adjustment wedge are engaged by a double-<br>
threaded screw having one end engaged in a throughgoing hole of the<br>
adjustment wedge or of the clamping wedge and another end in a threaded bore<br>
of the tool mount.<br>
In order to make a shallow cut when lathing and to provide a maximum possible<br>
number of cutting inserts on the tool mount being used, the tangential or edge-<br>
mounted cutting inserts can be mounted as described in DE 100 27 945. In this<br>
publication preferably axial set angles and relative spacings of the cutting inserts<br>
are described.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF<br>
INVENTION<br>
As already stated, according to the selected machining method a tool mount 10<br>
can be formed as a disk miller or as a bar for use in single or double rotary<br>
machining or can be formed as a body that is a part-circular segment. The tool<br>
mount has along its periphery or edge radially clamped cutting inserts; in this<br>
case three on each side. The cutting inserts have shapes designed for cutting<br>
profiles, in particular groves or undercuts on crankshafts. For example cutting<br>
inserts of the type described in WO 99/12685 are used. In this embodiment<br><br>
illustrated in Figure 1 all of the cutting inserts 11 are axially adjustable. To this<br>
end a cassette-like holder 12 and an adjustment wedge 13 with a wedge face 14<br>
are used. The cassette-shaped holder 12 has an upper part 15, a transverse web<br>
16, and a lower part 17 that are unitarily formed with each other and that<br>
generally form a Z-shape. Each cutting insert 11 is fixed by a respective<br>
mounting screw 18 to the respective cassette-shaped support 12. The tool<br>
mount 10 has seats complementary to the Z-shaped supports 19 so that a lower<br>
face of the support 12 sits on a face 20 and a back face lies on a face or back<br>
side 12 and a back face of the upper part on a face 22.<br>
The adjustment wedge 13 has a throughgoing threaded bore in which is<br>
engaged one threaded end of a double-threaded screw 23 whose other end is<br>
threaded into a bore 24 of the tool mount. Rotation of the double-threaded<br>
screw 13 shifts the adjustment wedge linearly along a longitudinal axis of the<br>
double-threaded screw. Since the wedge face 14 bears on the back face of the<br>
upper part 15, such movement of the adjustment wedge 13 exerts pressure on<br>
the back face 26 (see Figure 3) of the upper part 15 leading to an outward<br>
flexing of the upper part 15 about a line 25 extending between points 27 and 28<br>
(see Figure 3). In this region of elastic deformation of holder 12, the cutting<br>
insert 11 can be shifted axially up to 0.3 mm. When the desired axial position of<br>
the cutting insert 11 is reached, a cap-head screw 29 is engaged into a threaded<br>
bore 30 opening at the back face 26 to clamp it in place. To clamp the lower part<br>
17 of the holder 12 in place there is preferably a somewhat larger cap screw 31<br>
that engages with its threaded shaft into a threaded bore 32 of the lower part 17<br>
of the holder 12. The cutting inserts 11 are spaced apart on each side and<br>
alternate from side to side, so that between two adjacent cutting inserts on one<br><br>
side there is space for the throughgoing holes to accommodate the screws 29<br>
and 31 for the staggered and opposite plates.<br>
In addition to the axial adjustment, the cutting inserts 11 according to the<br>
embodiment of Figures 4 and 5 can be radially adjusted (see Figures 4 and 5).<br>
For radial adjustment of the holder 12 there is an adjustment wedge 33 that is<br>
similar to the adjustment wedge 13 and linearly shiftable by a double-threaded<br>
screw 34. This adjustment wedge bears on the lower face of the holder 12.<br>
Turning the double-threaded screw 34 in one direction shifts the holder 12 and<br>
the cutting insert 11 carried on it radially outward. In contrast to the system of<br>
Figures 1 to 3 with only axial adjustment, the wedge face (instead of the face<br>
20) of the adjustment wedge 33 serves as a base support. In order to clamp the<br>
holder 12 in place there is a clamping screw 35 that engages within shaft in a<br>
bore 36 of the tool mount 10. The lower part 17 of the holder has on its front<br>
face a stepped bore 40 with an annular shoulder face 37 that bears in the<br>
clamped position on a complementary annular face 38 of the clamping screw 35.<br>
The axial adjustment is effected as described above with reference to Figures 1<br>
to 3. The bores 40 and 39 (see Figures 3 and 4) must be dimensioned such that<br>
the screws 35 and 29 can shift into any selected position o the cutting insert<br>
without being blocked. The clamping is effected however by surface contact of<br>
the annular faces of the stepped bores and the screw heads.<br>
In addition, in order to ensure exact positioning of the cutting insert 11, the<br>
clamping screw is prestressed radially (see arrow 41) and axially (see arrow<br>
42). This exerts additional force toward the support face 20 (see Figure 1) or<br>
radially toward the adjustment wedge 33 and axially toward the faces 43 and 44.<br><br>
This type of presterssing can be used with only axial adjustment as well as with<br>
axial and radial adjustment of the cutting insert.<br>
In contrast to the tool of Figures 1 to 5, a tool mount 50 is set up as a disk miller<br>
holding both radially clamped cutting inserts as well as tangentially clamped<br>
cutting inserts 51. An outer periphery of the disk miller is formed with a row of<br>
pairs of radially clamped cutting inserts and alternating tangentially clamped<br>
cutting inserts 51. The radial adjustment of the radially clamped cutting inserts<br>
51, which have in top view a rectangular and in particular square outer face, are<br>
set in seats of respective cassettes 52 and secured in place by mounting screws.<br>
The cassettes 52 are held in position by a clamping wedge 53 and a double-<br>
threaded screw 54 in respective seats of the mount 50. Each cassette 52 is<br>
radially adjusted by an adjustment wedge 55 that has a threaded bore in which<br>
one end of a double-threaded screw 56 whose other end is engaged. Actuation<br>
of the double-threaded screw shifts the adjustment wedge 55 that bears radially<br>
outward with its face 47 on the cassette 53 and shifts it radially outward or<br>
inward. To radially adjust the cassette 52 and its cutting insert 51, first the clamp<br>
wedge 3 is loosened, then the adjustment wedge 53 is set for the desired radial<br>
position, and then the cassette is fixed in place by the clamping wedge.<br>
The tool shown in Figure 6 can in particular be used for machining a crankshaft.<br>
The cutting inserts 11 like the cutting insert 51 can have a PCD insert and/or be<br>
made indexable.<br><br>
