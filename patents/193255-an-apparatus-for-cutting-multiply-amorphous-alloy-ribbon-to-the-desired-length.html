This invention relates to an apparatus for cutting multiply amorphous alloy ribbon to desired length and is particularly useful in making transformer cores.<br>
Transformer cores are formed by winding amorphous alloy ribbons. Conventionally a large number of amorphous alloy ribbons are wound to produce a transformer core. Variations in the physical properties of the different pieces of single ply ribbons that go into the making of a core, affect the stacking factor and uniformity of the cores produced.<br>
In order to overcome this drawback, we developed an apparatus for multiply winding of amorphous alloy ribbon which is the subject matter of our copending patent application no.l410/MA/96. This apparatus consists of a plurality of uncoilers for single ply amorphous alloy ribbons. These are fed to a single recoiler through shaking or aligning means to produce a multiply amorphous core ribbon suitable for making transformer cores.<br>
The multiply amorphous alloy ribbons must be cut to the desired length and then wound to fonn transformer cores. The ribbon may be annealed prior to core tbrmation. Mechanical or manual cutting is time consuming as the wound ribbon will have to be uncoiled and the desired length measured before manually cutting the same. Stacking the cut plys will amount to additional labour. In order to overcome these disadvantages, we have developed an automatic machine which uncoils the multiply ribbon to a predetermined length, cuts it and makes it ready for stacking.<br><br>
The apparatus consists of a single uncoiler, a core feeder assembly, shearing means, conveying means, stacking means and sensors connected to a control panel with control means and power supply. The different parts of the apparatus are described in detail hereinbelow.<br>
The Uncoiler :<br>
The uncoiler is for uncoiling a wound spool of multiply amorphous alloy ribbon. It consists of a drivable gear housed in a metallic body. An AC motor with variable speed motor controlled by an ultrasonic sensor through a programmable logic control circuit is connected to the gear for driving the same. The uncoiler has expansion and collapsible means which are operated by hydraulic cylinders driven by a DC motor. The expansion and collapse means uncoils the spool from the wound coil of multiply amorphous alloy ribbon mounted in the uncoiler. The rate of uncoiling is controlled by infra-red sensors provided to sense the loop length.<br>
The core feed roller assembly :<br>
The feed roller assembly consists of two feed rollers drivable by a gear. The assembly has pneumatic lifting means such as pneumatic cylinders which will move the top roller up and down. The gear assembly is housed in a metallic housing and the entire feeder roller assembly is mounted on a structure preferably  a  metallic  frame.  The feeder  roller  assembly  is<br><br>
Connected to a pulse taohometer for measuring the speed of rotataion to feed the uncoiled multiply filament from the uncoiler to the feeder rollers as per requirements.<br>
The Shear :<br>
The shear is a means for shearing or cutting the uncoiled multiply ribbon at the desired length. The shearing means consists of two Tungston Carbide blades fixed to a frame or a metal body. These blades are adjustable with the help of adjusting means operable hydraulically.<br>
The Conveyor :<br>
The conveyor consists of a belt supported by support rollers and is drivable by a geared motor. Preferably, the conveyor is a belt with mechanical metal structure. The conveyor is connected to the shearing means at one end and to the stacking table at the other end and carry the cut material from the shearing means to the stacking table.<br>
The Stacking table :<br>
Consists of structure with its top surface aligning with the conveyor belt. The table is preferably metallic. The cut multiply ribbons received from the conveyor belt is stacked on the stacking table.<br><br>
The Sensors :<br>
Are known electronic sensing means consisting of sensing elenents and signal transfer elements. The sensors are preferably infrared sensors and they control the uncoiled loop received from the uncoiler before the sane is fed to the shearing neans.<br>
The Control Panel :<br>
Controls the operation of the apparatus. The Control panel consists of push button stations connected to the motor for rotating the uncoiler. Drive can be in the forward and reverse direction. The Control panel is also provided with means for expansion and collapse of the uncoiler mandrel for controlling the speed of the ply uncoiled from the spool to the shearing means. Means for controlling the up and down movements of the feeder rollers for controlling the shearing is also provided. The control panel is also provided with means for emergency stopping of the system.<br>
The apparatus for cutting multiply amorphous alloy ribbon to desired length according to this invention comprises an uncoiler for uncoiling wound spools from a oore of multiply amorphous alloy ribbon, for feeding the said spools to a feed roller assembly, shearing means for cutting the spools to the desired length, conveyor means for conveying the said cut spools from the<br><br>
shearing means to a stacking means, sensing means for sensing and controlling the uncoiled spools from the uncoiler to a predoternined length, and a control panel for controlling the operation of the apparatus.<br>
The apparatus according to this invention and the method of its operation will now be described in detail with reference to the single figure in the accompanying drawing.<br>
Reference letter A stands for the uncoiler for uncoiling a spool of wound multiply amorphous alloy ribbon which is pulled through a feeder roller assembly indicated by (B) sensing means 0 controls the length of the uncoiled spool (F) and stops uncoiling or pulling when a predetermined length is reached. The shearing means C to which the length of the spool is fed from the feeder roller cuts the multiply ribbon with the Tungston cutting blades which is then transferred through the conveyor means (D) to a stacking table E. The apparatus is electrically connected through control panel H which has push buttons for controlling the operations. The cutting operations are programmed to continue sequentially till the desired number of lengths are cut. Sensing mechanism consists of sensing elements and signal transfer elements which transfer the signals to programmable logic control circuits. The programmed sequential operation of this apparatus Increases the efficiency of cutting and avoids the drawbacks of mechanical shearing and cutting of multiply ribbons. Reference letter F shows the uncoiled ribbon flowing to the feeder rollers.<br><br>
It will be obvious to persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and modifications are possible without departing from the basic inventive concept. All such modifications and variations are to be considered within the scope of the present invention, the nature of which is described hereinabove and claimed in the appended claims.<br><br><br>
