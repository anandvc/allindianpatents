The present invention relates to benzimidazole derivatives and their use in medical therapy particularly for the treatment or prophylaxis of virus infections such as those caused by herpes viruses. The invention also relates to the preparation of the benzimidazole derivatives and pharmaceutical formulations containing them.<br>
Of the DNA viruses, those of the herpes group are the sources of the most common viral illnesses in man. The group includes herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hximan herpes virus type 6 (HHV-6) and human heipes virus type 7 (HHV-7). HSV-1 and HSV-2 are some of the most common infectious agents of man. Most of these viruses are able to persist in the host's neural cells; once infected, individuals are at risk of recurrent clinical manifestations of infection which can be both physically and psychologically distressing.<br>
HSV infection is often characterised by extensive and debilitating lesions of the skin, mouth and/or genitals. Primary infections may be subclinical although tend to be more severe than infections in individuals previously exposed to the virus. Ocular infection by HSV can lead to keratitis or cataracts thereby endangering the host's sight. Infection in the new-bom, in immunocompromised patients or penetration of the infection into the central nervous system can prove fatal.<br>
VZV is a herpes virus which causes chickenpox and shingles. Chickenpox is the primary disease produced in a host without immunity, and in young children is usually a mild illness characterised by a vesicular rash and fever. Shingles or zoster is the recurrent form of the disease which occurs in adults who were previously infected with VZV. The clinical manifestations of shingles are characterised by neuralgia and a vesicular skin rash that is unilateral and dermatomal in distribution. Spread of inflammation may lead to paralysis or convulsions. Coma can occur if the meninges become affected. VZV is of serious concern in patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs for transplant purposes or for treatment of malignant neoplasia and is a serious complication of AIDS patients due to their impaired immune system.<br><br>
-2-<br>
In common with other herpes viruses, infection with CMV leads to a lifelong association of virus and host. Congenital infection following infection of the mother during pregnancy may give rise to clinical effects such as death or gross disease (microcephaly, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, mental retardation), retinitis leading to blindness or, in less severe forms, failure to thrive, and susceptibility to chest and ear infections. CMV infection in patients who are immunocompromised for example as a result of malignancy, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs following transplantation or infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus, may give rise to retinitis, pneumonitis, gastrointestinal disorders and neurological diseases.<br>
The main disease caused by EBV is acute or chronic infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever). Examples of other EBV or EBV associated diseases include lymphoproliferative disease which frequently occurs in persons with congenital or acquired cellular immune deficiency, X-linked lymphoproliferative disease which occurs namely in young boys, EBV-associated B-cell tumours, Hodgkin's disease, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt lymphoma, non-Hodgkin ?-cell lymphoma, thymomas and oral hairy leukoplakia. EBV infections have also been found in association with a variety of epithelial-cell-derived tumours of the upper and lower respiratory tracts including the lung.<br>
HHV-6 has been shown to be a causative agent of infantum subitum in children and of kidney rejection and interstitial pneumonia in kidney and bone marrow transplant patients, respectively, and may be associated with other diseases such as multiple sclerosis. There is also evidence of repression of stem cell counts in bone marrow transplant patients. HHV-7 is of undetermined disease aetiology.<br>
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a viral pathogen of world-wide major importance. The virus is aetiologically associated with primary hepatocellular carcinoma and is thought to cause 80% of the world's liver cancer. Clinical effects of infection with HBV range fi-om headache, fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pains. Replication of the virus is usually controlled by the immune response, with a course<br><br>
-3-<br>
of recovery lasting weeks or months in humans, but infection may be more severe leading to persistent chronic liver disease outlined above.<br>
PCX Patent Specification Nos. WO 92/07867 and WO 94/08456 describe certain antiviral polysubstituted benzimidazole nucleoside analogues including ?-D-ribofuranosyl riboside analogues. PCT Patent Specification No. WO 93/18009 describes certain antiviral benzimidazole analogues in which the sugar residue is replaced by a carbocyclic group.<br>

The present invention further includes the use of a compound according to the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for simultaneous or sequential administration with at least one other therapeutic agent, such as those defined hereinbefore.<br>
The compounds according to the invention, also referred to herein as the active ingredient, may be administered for therapy by any suitable route including oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including transdermal, buccal and sublingual), vaginal and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal and intravitreal). It will be appreciated that the preferred route will vary with the condition and age of the recipient, the nature of the infection and the chosen active ingredient.<br>
In general a suitable dose for each of the above-mentioned conditions will be in the range of 0.01 to 250 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient (e.g. a human) per<br><br>
-11-<br>
day, preferably in the range of 0.1 to 100 mg per kilogram body weight per day and most preferably in the range 0.5 to 30 mg per kilogram body weight per day and particularly in the range 1.0 to 20 mg per kilogram body weight per day. (Unless otherwise indicated, all weights of active ingredient are calculated as the parent compoimd of formula (I); for sahs or esters thereof, the weights would be increased proportionally.) The desired dose may be presented as one, two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses administered at appropriate intervals throughout the day. In some cases the desired dose may be given on alternative days. These sub-doses may be administered in unit dosage forms, for example, containing 10 to 1000 mg or 50 to 500 mg, preferably 20 to 500 mg, and most preferably 100 to 400 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.<br>
Ideally, the active ingredient should be administered to achieve peak plasma concentrations of the active compound from about 0.025 to about 100 ?M, preferably about 0.1 to 70 ?,M, most preferably about 0.25 to 50 ?,M. This may be achieved, for example, by the intravenous injection of a 0.1 to 5% solution of the active ingredient, optionally in saline, or orally administered as a bolus containing about 0.1 to about 250 mg/kg of the active ingredient. Desirable blood levels may be maintained by a continuous infusion to provide about 0.01 to about 5.0 mg/kg/hovir or by intermittent infusions containing about 0.4 to about 15 mg/kg of the active ingredient.<br>
While it is possible for the active ingredient to be administered alone it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical formulation. The formulations of the present invention comprise at least one active ingredient, as defined above, together with one or more acceptable carriers thereof and optionally other therapeutic agents. Each carrier must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to the patient. Formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including transdermal buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal and intravitreal) administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients.   In general, the<br><br>
-12-<br>
formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product.<br>
The present invention further includes a pharmaceutical formulation as hereinbefore defined wherein a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof and at least one further therapeutic agent are presented separately from one another and as a kit of parts.<br>
Compositions suitable for transdermal administration may be presented as discrete patches adapted to remain in intimate contact with the epidermis of the recipient for a prolonged period of time. Such patches suitably contain the active compovind 1) in an optionally buffered, aqueous solution or 2) dissolved and/or dispersed in an adhesive or 3) dispersed in a polymer. A suitable concentration of the active compound is about 1% to 25%, preferably about 3% to 15%. As one particular possibility, the active compound may be delivered from the patch by electrofransport or iontophoresis as generally described in Pharmaceutical Research. 3 (6), 318 (1986).<br>
Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion.
