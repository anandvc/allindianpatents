CROSS-REFERENCES TO BELATED APPLICATIONS <br>
[0001]   This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119(e) of US, Provisional Patent Application No. 60/555,908, filed April 27,2004 (Attorney Docket No. 20695C-006800US), the entire disclosure of which is herein, incorporated by reference for all purposes.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
 [0002]   The present invention relates to a stirred-tank reactor system and methods of preparing such systems. The present invention further encompasses the use of the stirred-tank reactor system as a disposable bioreactor and in kits with disposable elements.<br>
BACKGROUND OFTHE INVENTION<br>
[0003]   Bioreaotors or fermenters include containers used for fermentation, enzymatic reactions, cell culture, biologtcals, chemicals, biopuarmaceuticals, tissue engineering, microorganisms, plant metabolites, food production and the like. Bioreactors vary in size from benehtop fermenters to stand-alone units of various sizes. The stringent asepsis requirements for sterile production in some bioreactors can require elaborate systems to achieve the desired product volumes, Consequently, the production of products in aseptic bioreactors can be costly which provides the motivation for pursuing improved systems.<br>
[0004]   Conventional bioreactors perfuse nutrient media through a single type of hollow fiber. The various disadvantages of such bioreactors may include heterogeneous cell mass, difficult procurement of representative cell growth samples, poor performance due to inefficient oxygenation and an inability to control oxygen levels, and problems with contamination of cell cultures, morover  micro-environmental factors such as pH may not be effeotively controlled and a mixed cultured or co-culture of cells may not be possible.<br>
Some known bioreactors include a reaction container, through which a central strand of porous hollow fibers extends, through which a nutrient solution is pumped. This central strand of hollow fibers is concentrically surrounded by a plurality of strands of hollow fibers, through which a gaseous medium is conveyed. The hollow fibers of these strands are also constituted in such a manner that the gaseous medium-for example oxygen or carbon dioxide—can at least partly emerge from these strands or enter into these strands respectively. This type of bioreactor can achieve enhanced nutrient media oxygenation as compared to other known devices. However, occasional contamination of cell cultures and an inability to control pH levels effectively may continue to present difSculties.<br>
[0005]    The expense of producing cells, biophannaceuticals, biologjcals and the Hke in aseptic bioreactors is often exacerbated by the required cleaning, sterilization and validation of the standard bioreactors (Le., stainless steel or glass reactors). Attempts have been made to solve this problem with the development of pre-sterilized disposable bioreactor systems that need not be cleaned, sterilized or validated by end users. The use of such disposable bioreactor systems could provide significant savings. Furthermore, plastics are lightweight, easyto transport, and rcquire less room mân stainless steel or glass reactors. Somehave reported the use of disposable elemente m bioreactors that include a reactor chamber with a support housing. The interior chamber of the support housing is lined with a disposable liner and sealed with a head plate attachedto the liner to form asealed chamber. As the liner is open at the top, it is typically used in a vertically oriented bioreactor to preveni the contamination of the head plate. Although this system provides a disposable liner, the head plate and the interior chamber may still require cleaning and sterilization.<br>
[0006]    Others have attempted to develop flexible, disposable plastic vessels that do not require cleaning or steriHzation and require onlynrinimal validation efforts. Such approaches can include a flexible, disposable, and gas permeable cell culture chamber that is horizontally rotated. The cell culture chamber is made of twosheets of plastic fused together. maddition, the culture chamber is made of gas permeable material and is mounted on a horizontally rotating disk drive mat supports the flexible culture chamber without blocking airflow over the membrane surfaces. The chamber is placed in an incubator and oxygen transfer is controlled by controlling the gas pressure ni the incubator accordingto the penneability coefficientofthebag. ITierotationofthebagaSsistBinttiixingthewmtentsofthebag. However, the cell culture chamber willoftobemnitedto use wimin a controlled gas environment Particularly, the cell culture chamber may have no support apparatus and may be limited to small volumes. Furthermore, the chamber may not provide an inlet and an outlet for media to be constantly pumped into and out of the chamber duringrotation.<br>
[0007]   Some companies have developed a range of pre-sterilc, disposable bioreactors that do not require cleaning or sterilizing. Such reactors are made of sheets of flexible, gas impermeable material to form a bag. The bag is partially filled with media and ţhen inflated with air that continuallypasses through the bag's headspace. The media is mixed and aerated<br>
by rockiag the bags to increase the air-liquid interface. However, since there is typically no solid houaing that Bupport the bags, the bags may become cumbersome and difficult ta handle as they increase in size. Furmermore, the wave action witbin fhe rocking bag can create darnaging turbulent forces. Certain cell cultures, particularly human cell cultures, may benefit ftom more gentle condiţiona.<br>
[0008]   Thus, thete ia a ccmtinuing need to develop flexible, pre-sterilized, disposable bioreactors that are easyto handle and require little training to operate, yet provide tbe necessary gas transfer and nutrient mbdng reqoired for successful cell and tissue cultures. Snch disposable bioreactors would be equally useful for ihe productionofchemicals, biopharmaceuticals, biologicals, cells, microorganisms, plant metaboh'tes, foods and the like.<br>

The impeller of the instant invention includes, but is not limited to, a Rushton, a marine, a ' hydrofbil, a pitched blade, and any other commercially available impeller.<br>
[0065]   to some embodiments, a 'Tiydrodynamic" environment of the instant invention may refer to an environment that is influenced by the motion of fluids and the forces acting on solid bodies immersed in these fluids within the stirred-tank reactor system.<br>
[0066]   The present invention includes single use bioreactors, stirred tank reactors, and the<br>
like. Such reactors have a variety of applications, such as for the production of merapeutic<br>
proteins via batch cell culture. Relatedly, these systems can be used to provide for cell<br>
growra and anhTx&gt;dy production for CBO and o^	%ehydrodynatnic<br>
environment withifl me reactors can be well diaracterized,and,assuch,maybescaledto other stirred tank bioreactors.<br>
[0067]   Single use bioprocess containers can be used for thestorage of biopharmaceutical media, buffers, and omerproducts. Using mese storage container systems, several mixing systems for preparation of media and buffers can be developed, often to commeroial scale up to 10,000 liters or more. Such mixing systems and bioreactors can use various means for mixing the reactor contenta, such as apulsating disk, apaddle mixer, a rockingplatfbnn, an impeller, and the like. These systems are well suited for use in chemical processing. The<br>
operating characteristics of the reactors can be well defined, and can be readily predicted and scaled to various sizes. In the biopharmaceutical industry, such stirred tank biorcactors can be established as a means far manufacture of biologic products from a wide range of biological systems, including animal cell culture. Processes for biological systems can be developed using stirred tank bioreactors at the bench scale and transferred to stirred tank bioreactors at the commercial scale, up to 10,000 liters or greater, using well established scale-up methodologies. For a stirred tank bioreactor, design parameters such as tip speed, power input, Reynolds number, and oxygen transfer coefficient can be readily determined and used for scale-up.<br>
[0068]   A single use portion of the system can include a flexîble plastic container with the following single use integrated components: a bearing, shaft, and impeller assembly, a sparger assembly, ports for sterile attachment of sensor probes; and various ports for inlet and outlet of liquids and gases. A single use bioreactor can be manufactured using medical grade film. In some cases, other components of the single use bioreactor can be manu&amp;ctured from readily machined materials that are not necessarily TJSP Class VI materials. The impeller can be a pitched-blade impeller that is attached to a bearing assembly by a flexible sheath. The impeller and sheath can rotate along with an inner bearing assembly, which is isolated from the exterior bearing assembly using various seal assemblies. An outer bearing assembly can be directly affîxed to the single use container. A sparger can include a porous membrane mat is sealed to the bottora of the single use container. Sparge gas can be introduced to the space between the porous membrane and bottom of me container tfarough a port after passing through a pre-attached sterilization filter. The pH and dO2 sensors may or may not be part of the single osc container and can connected to me bioreactor using Pali Kleenpack® cormectors. lodiistry-standard 12 mm sensors can be cah^rated, men steam sterilized with onehalfofthe(XJnnector. Theomerhalfofmew&gt;nnectorcanbeprc-attachedtothe container, allowmg the sensor to be inserted in direct contact with the reactor contenta. Ports and tubing for headspace gas, thermo well, media inlet, titrant, aainpţing, harvest, and various puise feeds can be pre-attached and pre-storilized with the container.<br>
[0069]   A permanent swpportvessel mat contams a motor and drive shaft assembly, heat jacket, and openings for inlets, outiets, and probes can hold a single use container. A drive shaft can fit through the single-use bearing, through the flexible sheath, and lock into the impeller. This shaft can be driven using a standard bioreactor mixer motor of suffîcient power. Heat can be provided to the bioreactor contenta, for example, by electric heat banda<br>
that are in direct contact with sides of the single-use container. The pennanent support vessel can be mobile, and can be placed on a weigh scale for control of reactor volume.<br>
[0070]    The system can beoperatedusing standard sensors and controllers that have industry-accepted track recorda of performance. In some embodiments, no control system may be required for steam sterilization or clean in place, and a controller commonly used for bench-scale bioreactors may be sufficient for control of the pH, dO2 concentration, and temperature of the single ase bioreador. A single ase bioeactor oâen requires no cleaning or sterilization in-place. As such, the capital and operating costs of control systems and utilities, such as clean steam, required for steam sterilzation of a large pressure vessel may be eliminated. The <x>st for febrication of a rigid-waUed pressure vessel designedtohandle the stresses exerted during steam-in-place sterilization may also be eliminated Likewise, the capital and operating costs for clean-in-place control systems and utilities may be urmecessary. The design elements of tradiţional stainlcss steel vessels dictated by cleanabih'ty requirements may similarly be eliminated.<br>
[0071]   In some embodiments, a single use bioreactor can be a closed system mat is discardedafteruse. This may eliminate the need for cleaning validation studies. The potenţial for cross contamination between production batches may also be reduced. In some embodiments, the capital expenditure required to accommodate multiple products simultaneously in single use bioreactors can be low compared to the cost of the fîxed assets and utilities required to segregate traditional bioreactor systems. A single use bioreactor can be manufactured using medical grade film, and regulatory documentation for the film may be currently available. Other product contact componente of a single use bioreactor canbe manufactured ftom USP Qass VI materials.

[0072]   As note above, a stkred tank single use bioreactor according to the present invention can provide a well-characterized hydrodynamic environment for cell growth, Mîxing characteristics can be readily calculated and can be translatedtolargersthTedtankreactors. Thus, processes developed at the lab or pilot scale may be scalod up directly to commercial scale, either in larger single use bioreactors or larger traditional stkred tank bioreactors. Scale-up parameters such as power input per unit volume, tip speed, oxygen transfer coefficient, or geometric similarity may be mamtained at the larger scale, m some<br>

Such designa can provide efFcctivc and efficient means of transmitting tbe energy required for mixing and mass transfer to the reactor contents.<br>
[0073]   Thepresentinvention can also include or be compatible with industry-standard sensor and controller tecbnology. A standard tfaat has developed in the industry is the use of 12 mm diameter pH and dQ2 sensors inserted through DN25 (Inglold-style) ports in direct contact with the reactor contents. Systems such as a single use bioreactor can incorporate the same 12 mm diameter pH and dO2 sensors in direct contact with the reactor contents. Calibration and standaraization procedures for mese sensors can be readily perfbrmed during operation of the bioreactor. m addition, outputs firom these sensors can be compatible with current controllers used by industry. The use of PID controllere to maintain pH, dO2 concentration, and temperature can be used in such biorcactors. As a stirred tank bioreactor with standard sensors, mese control strategica can be directly translatable to a single use bioreactor. Because it can be a stand-alone unit, the single use bioreactor may be controlled using whichever controller type that is preferred by a given facility.<br>

The probe may be, for exemple, a ternperature probe, a pH probe, a dissolved gas sensor, an oxygen sensor, a carbon dioxide sensor, a cell mass sensor, a nutrient sensor, an osmometer or any other probe that allows for testing or checking the culture or production. In another preferred embodiment, the system includes at least one port in the bag allowing for me connection of a device to the port. Such a device includes, but is not limited to, a tube, a filter, a connector, a probe, and a sampler. The inoorporation of various ports into the bag allows for gas flow in and out of the bag as well as liquid flow m and out of the bag. Such ports also allow fixr sampling or testing the media or culture inside the bag. Tubing, filters, connectors, probes, samplers or other devices can be connected to the ports by using any desirable tubing connection technology. Pouches and ports that are sealed or affixed to the bag are disposable with the bag. The bag may also include a sparger (i.e.t the component of a reactor mat sprays air into the medium) sealed to the bag wbich can be disposed offwith the bag.<br>
[0079]   Particulady, ports may be incorporated at any place on the flexible bag to accommodate the following:<br>

[0080]   Each port may have floxible tubing attached to the port, to which media bags, sample devices, filtera, gas lines, or harvest pumps may be attached with sterile or aseptic connections. In one embodiment, the ports are sealed onto the flexible bag during bag manufacture, and are sterilizedwith the bag assembly.<br>
[0081]   Devices that may be used to make aseptic connections to the flexible tubing are the following:<br>

[0082]   In another embodiment, flexible tubing mat is attached to an appropriate stainless-• steel valve assembly may be sterilized separately (e.g., via atrtoclave), and then used as a way to cormect the disposable bioreactor to tradiţional reactors or process piping. The valve assembly is used to make a tradiţional steam-in-place (ŞIP) connection to a traditional reactor or other process, and the flexible tubing is used to make a sterile or aseptic cormection to a port on thadisposable reactor.<br>
[0083]   Rcforrmgto the drawings,Mgure 2 dc^cts a probe corneei employed with me Btirred-tank reactor system accordhlg to one embodiment of the instant invention. As shown in Hgnre 2, me probe 201 can be connected to a flexible sleeve 202 or bag which extends to one half of a PALL connector 203. The PALL cormector 203 can be connected to the other half of the PALL connector 205 to provide far a sterile cormection between the probe and the stirred-tank reactor system. The PALL connectors 203,205 include covers 204 and filters 207 to keep the connection site sterile. Sterile tubing 206 extends from the other half of the PALL connector 205 to a reactor port 208 of the reactor vessel 209 of the stirred-tank reactor system. m ordertoattach the probe, the PALL connection is made by removing the covers 204, mating the connectors 203,205, removing<br>
the filters 207, and sliding the movable part of the connector into position. The probe sensor tip 212 is then pushed into the reactor as the flexible sleeve or bag bunches or compresses 210. The probe senor tip 212 is tfaen in direct contact with the inside of the reactor vessel 209. A clamp 211 is placed around the probe and tubing to seal the reactor contents from the PALL connection assembly. Thus, when a sterile connection is made between the two halves of the PALL connectors 203,205, the flexible sleeve 202 or bag becomes compressed 210 and the probe is in contact with the culture or production media.<br>
[0084]   Ia one embodiment, the probes may be sterilized separately (e.g., via autoclave) then attached to the reactor via a sterile or aseptic connection. For example, a probe assembly may be made by inserting a probe 201 into one half of a PALL KLEENPAK connector 203 and sealing the probe to the connector using a flexible sleeve or bag 202 as described abovc and shown in Fignre 2. The sleeve extends from the outside end of the probe to the barb of the PALL connector. Tbis assembly is steriUzed separately. Theother half of the PALL connector 205 is connected to a port 208 on the reactor 209 via flexible tubing 206 that will accommodate the probe. Tbis assembly is steriUzed as part of the reactor. The PALL connector is described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 6,655,655, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>

In tuni, impeller 340 agjtates the contente of container 302. As hub 320 is rotated by drive shaft 304, seal(s) 392 provide a seal between wear plate 382 and hub 320 as they both rotate in unison, relative to casing 360. As casing 360 remains stationary, seal(s) 384 provide a seal between wear plate 382 and casing 360, where wear plate 382 rotates relative to casing 360. Li some embodiments, seal(s) 384 provide a hermetic seal between wear plate 382 and casmg 360. As shown bere, seal(s) 384 can be in co-planar arrangement with one anofher.<br>

embodiment of the present invention. Sparger body 1500 can închide a sheet of penneable material. In some embodiments, sparger body 1500 includea a vapor-permeable and water-resistant material. In related embodiments, sparger body 1500 includes a high density polyethylene fiber. For example, sparger body 1500 can include Tyvek® material. Sparger body 1500 can be in fluid communication with a port of a contamer (not shown) via a sparger conduitlSlO. As shown in Flgure 15, sparger body 1500 can be in the shq» of a donut or ring. Relatedly, sparger body 1500 can include abase 1502 whichis adapted to anchorto an interior surface of a container (not shown.). The base may or may not include a gas penneable material. In omor embodiments, one or more sheets of gas permeable material can be directly sealed with me interior of the container, whereby the interior of the sparger body 1500 includea a gas penneable matorial on one ride (e.g. top side of body), and a corresponding portion of the container on me other side (e.g. bottom side of body).<br>

Similarfy, the sparger may be constructed so as to only altow gas to pass through the permeable material whenitissubject tosufficiently high gas pressure. Often, a sparger body will închide a soft, flexible material. Li some embodiments, sparger body 1500 may be welded directly onto container so as to ensure proper placement and alignment When coupled with a flexible container such as a flexible bag, sparger body 1500 can effoctively be folded up wim me bag for storage and<br>
transport, sterilized simultaneously with the bag, and disposed of so as to eliminate subsequent cleaning. Sparger body 1 500 can provide for minute gas bubbles which can increase diffusion of gas into the fluid. It is appreciated that other types of spargere can be used with the present system.<br>
[0117]   A variety of materials or assemblies can be used to provide gas transfer into growth chambers. These include, for example, porous materials in the farm of tubing made of Teflon® (PTFE), polysulfbne, polypropylene, silicone, Kynar® (PVDF), and the like. In some embodiments, used to provide gas transfer into growth chambers. As noted above, sparger body 1500 can include Tyvek® material, which can be usedmabioreactorfbrme use of active gas diffiision. Similarly, this material can be used in a growth cham<br>
passive gas transfer. Penneability of Tyvek® film can be measured using the quantitative property of Qurley Hill Porosity. In some embodiments, such materials range in values between about 6 to about 30 (sec/lOOcc IN2). Permeabih'ty rated according to the methods of<br>

[0118]   In some embodiments, a permeable material will have bigh permeability wbile maintaming hydrophobicity, strength, weldability, biocompatibility, and gamma stability. Often, it is desirable to have a flexible material mat welds readily to common materials used in the film or port configurations, often found in the manufacture of bioprocessing containere (BPCs). For example, the flexible nature of a soft or paper bice film can allow it to be folded during manufacturing, packaging, loading, and use of the bioreactor. It may also be desirous to allow for the surface area and shape of the sparge material to easily be modified or changed according to weld or cut pattern. Optionally, instead of providing a sparger body to be immersed in the contents of a container, a permeable envetope could be used encapsulate the liquid contenta of thd oiorMkâtor» thus proviânig'a%toad area for difEusion.<br>
[0119]   Welding me sparger body on a port or container surface can provide for a bigh level of surface area wbile providing a low-profile sparge. In some embodiments, this can reduce turbulence near the impeller and/or reduce the possibih'ty of cells accumulating in cracks, seams, or crevices. Often, convenţional sparge configurations rely on the use of spargmg rings mat have small hole perfbrations mat are placed bellow the impeller. Spargere can also include the use of extremely cr"ftH pore sizes. Such porous materials are commonly seen as sintered metal or ceramic matmals. Using a single use disposable material such as Tyvek® maybehdpfUmavoidingOTreducingcontaniina<br>
associated with some convenţional spargere, which sometimes involve cleaning numerous holes, pores, and crevices of such units. For example, small void areas in some spargere may present areas for cell debris to lodge and accumulate leading to increased occurrence of contamination. In some cases, this may carry over in subsequent cell nins.<br>
[0120]   One purpose of a sparge unit in a cell culture is to aid in the mass transfer of oxygen (kLa), which is often necessary for the respiration of the growing cells. An advantage of a sparge approach used in a single use bioreactor is that the tortuous porc structure of a gas permeable membrane such as Tyvek® can allow for a beneficia! effect on mass transfer of oxygen fiom the bulk gas introducedthroughtbesparger. Iu some embodiments, it is desirable to have small bubbles introduced into the bioreactor as they can benefit mass transfer. Mass transfer across a permeable membrane can occur independent of mass transfer resulting fiom a gas bubble. Relatedly, a long gas retention tune within me fluid column and a higher surface to volume ratios are often desirable effects. It is generally accepted that the bubble size can be dominated by surface tension effects, rnherently related to the component ratio of salts, proteins, sugara, and micro and macro component» of the nutrient media. Experimentally calculated kLa values, visual observation, and data fiom bioreactor nms often indicate that bubble size and perhaps improved mass transfer are qualities of the present sparge approaches. The composition and rheological properties of the liquid, mixing intensity, tumover rate of the fluid, bubble size, presence of cell chnnping, and interfacial absorption characteristics all influence mass transfer of gas such as oxygen to the cells. Main driving forces of mass transfer include surface arca and concentration gradient hi many cases, a main source of resistance of oxygen mass transfer in a stirred tank bioreactor can be the liquid •fikn surrovmding the gas bubble.<br>
[0121]   A spargiag matmial such «B Tyvek® can provide forthe transfer of gas across the membrane. Relatedly, by incorporatnig Tyvek® and similar gas permeable membranes, the surfiacearea can easilybe increased. In some embodiments, the oxygen gradient betweenthe membrane and the liquid interface can be maintained at a Mghlevelthrough constant replenishmentdirectlythrough a sparge inlet Fur&amp;er, a rapid mixing intensity can also benefit mass transfer as the impellerpumps media directly down onto a sparger surface. The use of a membrane can allow for mass transfer of oxygen across the bulk film surface, which can be in addraontothefonnation of bubbles uiatrise within the fluid column. In many cases, small bubbles can leadto greaţa foammg atme top of a bioreactor, which can have negative effects oncell viability andkLaatxx&gt;rdingtoHenry's law andthe solubility of gases<br>
related to parţial pressures. Ibis boundary layer often results in a reduced ability to control dissolved oxygen levels within the bulk liquid. Typically, it is desirable to avoid or mitigate the presence of foam, as excessive amounts can result in exhaust fîlter blocking and nm failure. The novei sparger approaches described herein can providc the desired mass transfer properties, often with reduced levels of foam generated as compared to convenţional systems. This may be due to greater efficacy and less gas being introducea through the sparger to a target oxygen solubility.<br>
[0122]   Tyvek®is similar is some aspecte to the material Gore-Tex®inthatithas hydrophobic qualities but will still allow water vapor to pass through. For medical grades of Tyvek® a large relative pore size can be about 20 (micrometers) and the surface energy can be about 25 to about 32 (dynes/cm). As mentioned elsewhere herein, it may be beneficia! to use a check valve in a gas inlet stream near a sparger to reduce undesirable transfer of water vapor through the membrane when the sparger is submerged while not in use. Actual moisture transmission rates may vary largely with the media used and the particular appfication. Moisture Vapor Transmission Rates (MTVR) often range ftom about 1500 to about 1640 (g/m2/24hrs). The present invention also contemplates the use of these sparger approaches in the form of a replaceable retrofît kit, which may be adapted for use with convenţional bioreactors. Such kits can improve kLa and replace a piece of hardware commonly used in steam sterilized bioreactors that may be difficult to sterilize or clean.<br>
[0123]   It is appreciated that any of a variety of permeable membranes may be used as a spargjng material. In some embodiments, such membranes may be comprised of high density polyethylene fîbers mat are beat sealed into a web having a thickness in a range between about 50 mlcrons to about 250 microns.

culture which is supplied with either ftesh nutrients (e.g„ growm-tirniting substrates) or<br>
additives (e.g., precursors to products). A continuous culture can be a suspension culture that<br>
is continuously supplied with nutrients by the inflow of fresh medium, wherein the culture volume is usually constant. Similarly, continuous fermentation can refer to a. process in which cells or micro-organisms are mamtained in culture in the exponenţial growth pbase by the continuous addition of fresh medium that is exactly balanced by the removal of cell suspension fiom the bioreactor. Furthermore, the stirred-tank reactor system can be used for suspension, perfusion or microcanier cultures. Generally, the stirred-tank reactor system can be operated as any convenţional stirred-tank reactor with any type of agitator such as a Rushton, hydrofoil, pitched blade, or marine. With reference to Figure l, the agitation shaft 112 can be mounted at any angle or position relative to the housing 111, such as upright centered, upright oflset, or 15° ofisct. The control of the stirred-tank reactor system can be by convenţional means without me nced for steam-in-place (ŞIP) or clean-in-place (CIP) control, hi fact, the system of the instant mvention is not limited to sterile bioreactor operation, but can be used in any operation in which a clean product is to be mixed using a stirred tank, for example, food production or any clean-room mixing without the need for a clean-room.<br>
D.   TheKit<br>
[0138]   The mvention encompasses a kit that includea a stirred-tank reactor system and instructions for use. In one embodiment, the kit includes a disposable stirred-tank reactor system. Accordingly, the kit includes at least one disposable element such as the bag, Ihe shaft, the impeller, or the bearing. The kit can be entirely disposable. The flccrible, disposable bag may be affixed to Ihe shaft and the bearing through at least one seal or o-ring such that Ihe inside of the bag remains sterile. In addition, the bag may include a pH sensor and a dissolved-oxygen sensor, wherein the sensors are incorporated into the bag and are disposable with the bag. The Mt may alao Mode o^^^<br>

Theprobemaybeatemperatureprobe, apH probe, a dissolved gas sensor, an oxygen sensor, a carbon dioxide (CO2) sensor, a cell mass sensor, a nutrient sensor, an osmometer, and the like. Furthennore, the system may include at least one port in the bag allowing for the connection of a device to me port, wherein the device includes, but is not limited to, a tube, a filter, a sampler, a probe, a connector, and the like. The port allows for sampling, titration, adding of chcmostat reagents, spargmg, and the like. The advantage of this kit is that it is optionally entirely disposable and easy-to-use by following the attached instructions. This Mt comes in diflferent sizes depending on the<br>
preferred culture volume and can be employed with any desired reaction chamber or barrel. This kit is pre-sterilized and requires no validation or cleaning. The kit can be used for cell culture, culture of microorganisms, culture of plant metabolites, food production, chemical production, biopharmaceutical production, and others.<br>
[0139]   In another embodiment the kit includes a housing or barrel that holds the disposable bag. Such a housing or barrel can be supplied with the bag or provided separately.<br>
E.   Examples<br>
[0140]   The following specific examples are intended to ilhistrate the invention and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the claims.<br>
[0141]    (1)   A Dfeposable Bioreactor<br>
[0142]   One example of a stirred-tank reactor aystem of the instant invention is a disposable bioreactor, or single use bioreactor (SUB). The bioreactor is similar to a 250 liter media bag with built-in agitatum and attachable sensors (e.g., pH sensors, temperature sensors, dissolved oxygen (dO2) sensors, etc.). The reactor is operated via convenţional controllere. The agitator (e.g., agitation shaft and impeller) and bearing are disposable and built into the bag. The motor attaches to a support (e.g., motor and bearing support) or bracket(s) on the 250 liter barrel that holds the bag. Insize, shape, and operation, this bioreactor appears similar to a stamless steel reactor wim a sterile liner, however, the bioreactor of tins invention provides a multitude of advantages compared to a convenţional atainless steel reactor. It can be appreciated mat the size and volume of such media bags can be scaled both upward and downward^accontingtoindustryneeds.<br>
Most importantiy, theneadfbr cleaniog and steam sterilization is eliminated. The bag is I&gt;re-sterili7^by iffadiatiOtt and, tiius, ready foruse. In fect, no cleaning, sterilization, validation or tcsting is required at culture start-up or between culture runs. Consequently, the bioreactor provides a culture environment of zero cross-contamination between nins. In convenţional systems, the majority of costs are related to clean-in-progress (CIP) and steam-in-progress (ŞIP) as well as fee design of a sMd and control system to oversee these functions. These costs are eliminated in the disposable bioreactor and multiple producte may be cultured or manu&amp;ctnred simultaneousiy and with much greater ease.<br>
[0143]   The disposable bioreactor can be easily scaled-up by using larger culture bags and larger barrels to hold the bags. Multiple bioreactors can be operated at the same time without<br>
any need for extensive engjneering or cleaning. The bioreactor is a truc stiired tank with wcll characterized mixing. As such, the bioreactor has the added advantage that it can be scaled and its contents transferred to a stainless steel reactor if desired. Notably, the bioreactor combines ease of usc with low cost and flexibility and provides, thus, a new technical pktform for cell culture.<br>
[0144]    (2)   CeU Culture<br>
[0145]   The disposable bioreactor of the instant invention can be used for a batch culture in which cells are inoculated into fresh media. As the cells grow, they consume the nutrients in the media and waste producte accumulate. For a secreted product, when me culture has run its course, cells are separated from the product by a filtration or centrifugation step. For viral-vector production, cells are infected with a virus during the growth phase of the culture, allowing expression of the vector followedbyharvest Smce mere is zero cross-contamination in the bioreactor it works well with batch cultures.<br>
[0146]   The bioreactor can also be used for perfusion cultures, wherein product and/or waste media is continuously removed and the volume removed is replaced with fresh media. The constant addition of fresh media, while elmiinating waste products, provides the cells with the nutrients they require to achieve higher cell concentrations. Unlike the consfantly changing conditions of a batch culture, the perfusion method ofiers the means to achieve and maintain a culture in a state of equiHbrium in which cell concentration and productivity may be maintained in a steady-state condition. This can be accomplished in me disposable bag as easily as in any convenţional stainless steel reactor. For viral- vector production, the perfusion process allows for an increase in the cell concentration and, thcreby the post-infection virus titer. For a secreted product, periMon m me bioreactor offere opportunity to increase flie productivity by sin^lyincreasmgttiesiaaofmeOTlturebag. Most importantly, there is no need for sterilization, validation, or cleaning because the system experiences zero cross-oraiamination during the production process.<br>

[0148]   Figure 29 provides a graph of data that was generated using a reactor system according to one embodiment of the present invention. Human embryonic Mdney (HEK) 293 cells m 200 Utere of CDM4 culture medium were incubated in a 250 h'ter capacity reactor system. Among other parameters shown in the graph, the viable cell density of me reactor system culture increased for about the first 14 days of the batch run.<br>

[0150]    FIgures 30-34 illustrate data obtained fiom a single use bioreactor system for mammalian cell culture according to one embodiment of the present invention. The scaleable mass transfer characteristics of the single use stirred tank bioreactor are descrîbed. Cell growth and metabolism, antibody production, and antibody characterization data from batoh culture using a 250-liter ptototype system are presented and compared to results from a tradiţional stainless-steel bioreactor of similar scale.<br>
[0151]   Materials and Methods - Mixing Studies. Mixing time in the bioreactor was estimated at various agjtation rates by tracking the change in pH in the reactor over time in response to addition of a base solution. The reactor was filled to worldng volume of 250 h'tera with typical cell culture media. At time zero, 500 ml of IN NaOH was added at the top of the reactor, and a combined pH glass electrode was used to measure pH fiom time zero until the pH hâd stabilized. The pH versus time was plotted, and the time reqirired to reach 95% of the final pH was estimated from the graph.<br>
[0152]   Key scde-up parameters were determined using standard calculations that have been well established in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry.<br>
[0153]    The mixing Reynolds number, NRB is the ratio of fluid kmetic and inerţial forces and is used to determine the mixing regune, either laminar or turbulent:<br>
[0154]    NRB = NDj2p/ji<br>
[0155]   The energy input into the reactor, P0) per volume of the reactor, V, relates to the scale at wMch fluid mixing and mass transfer occurs and is dependent on the impeller power number, Np:<br>
[0156]   Po/V^NppNW/V<br>
[0157]   The impeller power number depends on the design of the impeller and is a fimction of number of blades, blade width, and blade pitch. Np is also a fimction of the clearance of the impeller fiom the sides and bottom of the reactor. For various impeller types, the power number is well documented.<br>
[0158]   Tip speed of the impeller, \\, relates to the fluid shear stress in the vicinity of the unpeller:<br>
[0159]  <br>
[0160]   In the above equations, N = impeller rotational speed, D{ = impeller diameter, p = fluid density, and \i = fluid viscosity.<br>
[0161]   Materials and Methods - Oxygen Transfer Studies. The volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient, kLa, was estimated at various agitation and spargjng rates by tracking the change in dissolved oxygen, dOz, concentration over tinie at the appropriate condition. The reactor was fîlled to me working volume of 250 litera with typical cell culture media, and a dCfe sensor was InstaUed in the reactor. To prepare for each experiment, nitrogen was sparged mrough the bioreactor until the dOz concentration dropped below approximately 20% saturation with air. For each experiment, the agitation rate was set, and then air was sparged at the desired rate. The dOj concentration was measured versus time until it reached approximately 80% saturation with air. The value of k^a can be estimated from a graph of CL versus dQ/dt, based on the following mass balance equation:<br>
[0162]   dCi/dt - kta(C -<br>
[01 63]   where CL is the concentration, and C is the equilibrium value for CL.<br>
[0164]   Materials and Methods - Cell Culture Procedures. A cell culture process that hâd been developed for a tradiţional stainless-steel reactor of 300-liter working volume was used to demonstrate the perfonnance of the single use bioreactor. The cell line, media, and process parameters that hâd been demonstrated m the tradiţional reactor wererepeated in the single use reactor.<br>

Cells were then expanded fram T-flasks into custom 1-liter expansion baga prior to being introduced into a tradiţional stainless-steel 1 10-Kter inocula bioreaotor. Oace wllsreaoiied a concentration of 1.6 x ^ cells/ml, 45 litera from me traditional 1 1 0-h'ter bioreactor were used as inocula for the single use bioreactor. Thus, exponentially growing cells from a controlled bioreactor at a pre-determined cell concentration were provided as inocula for the single use bioreactor.<br>
[0166]   A standard, commercially available, chemically defined cell culture medium was used. At a spccified point in the batch culture, a commercially available nutrient feed that is of non-animal origin but is not chemically defined was added. Solutions of D-glucose and L-glutamine were added daily as required during the batch culture to a concentration<br>
of D-glucose between l and 3 mg/Iitcr and a concentration of L-glutamine between l and 3 mMol/liter throughout the batch.<br>
[0167]   Control of the single use bioreactor was accomplished using standard, industry-acceptcd sensors and controllers. The temperature, pH, and dOi feedback controllere operated using proporţional, integral, and differential (PJD) control. Temperature was measured by a platinum resistance thermometer inserted in a thermo well in the reactor, and was controlled at 37 °C via a electric beat jacket. The pH was measured using a combined pH glass electrode that was in direct contact with the bioreactor contents. The pH was controlled at a value of 7. l via addition of CCfe into the headspace or addition of IM Na2CO3 to the culture. The dOj concentration was measured using a dQz sensor that was in direct contact with the bioreactor contents. The dOj concentration was controlled at 30% saturation with air via sparging of 62 at approximately 0.2 liters/min. Agitation was not controlled by feedback but was rnaintained at a single set point of 110 rpm and checked daily. Level in the bioreactor was measured using a weigh scale.<br>
[0168]   A sampling system was attached to the bioreactor using a sterile connection device, and was used to withdraw 10-ml samples as required during the batch culture. Samples were withdrawn at least once daily. Samples were immediately analyzed using a Nova BioProfîle 200 analyzer, which provided culture pH, dQz, dCOît D-glucose, and L-glutamine concentrations. The pH probe was standardized, as required, and D-glucose and L-glutamine solutions were added based on the Nova measurements. Viable and total cell concentrations were determined for each sample based on hemacytometer counts using trypan blue dye exclusion. Samples were fîltered through a 0.2 um fîlter and stored for later analysis using an Igen based assay for antibody titer.<br>

[0171]   Results fiom a series of batch culturcs using a tradiţional stainless-steel bioreactor of similar scale were available for comparison with the single ase results. The ranges of values tabulated for the tradiţional bioreactor are the 95% prediction intervals for a single future observation:<br>

[0174]   The single ase bioreactor supematant was harvested, clarifîed by filtration and purifîed (protein A-based affiniry purification combined with ion exchange chromatography) using the procedures established for the tradiţional stamless bioreactor manufacturing process. The resultant purified antibody was characterized and compared to antibody derived fiom the tradiţional stamless steel process. Carbohydrate (CHO) profile, SDS-PAGB (reduced and non reduced), SEC-HPLC, SEC-MALS (Multi-Angle Light Scattering), BIACore Binding, RP-HPLC, Capillary Electrophoresis Isoelectric Focusing (CEIEF) and MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry assays were utilized to characterize Ine purified antibody derived fiom the single use bioreactor. The results obtained were compared to those seen for antibody produced in a tradiţional stainless steel bioreactor.<br>

 [0178]   Results-Oxygen Transfer Studios. The volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient, kta was determined for various flowrates of air througb the sparger and for various agitation speeds, shown in Figure 30. As expected, kLa increased with increasing air flowrate and wim increasing agitation speed, with one exception. At 200 rpm, kua was lower than fhat at 100 rpm. Tbis discrepancy may be due to an increased surface effect on kta at the higher agitation rate. (Due to the experimental procedure, the beadspace contained a mixture of nitrogen and air.)

[0180]   Results -BatchCell Culture. To demonstrate the suitability of mesingleuse bioreactor for cell culture production, CHO cells producing a hnmanized monoclonal<br>
antibody were grown in batch culture and compared to historical results firom the same cell line and process carried out in a tradiţional stainless steel bioreactor of similar scale. This process has been repeated five times in a 300-liter Abec tradiţional stainless steel reactor that is specifically designed for cell culture. Key cell culture parameters firom the two reactors are compared in Table 4.<br><br>

 [0181]   The single use bioreactor was an iniţial prototype. Asaprototypebeingusedforthe firet tune, adjustments to the controller PID parameters were made several times during the batch culture. Temporary excursions in pH, dO2 Concentration, sparger flowrate, and agitation speed occurred at times during the batch duc to these adjustments. Despite these excursions, results fixnn this bioreactor are equivalent to results from the tradiţional stainless steel bioreactor.
