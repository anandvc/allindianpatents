PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRITION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br>
1<br><br>
Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to jacks used in automobiles and more particularly this invention relates to jack built into the vehicle and is able to lift and rotate the vehicle in its position.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
Jack is a very essential device for lifting vehicle. The conventional jacks available in the market is either hydraulic or mechanical operated and is used in most of the places like service station, auto garages. Small portable jacks are carried along with the vehicle to replace tyres. Some jacks are capable of lifting vehicle completely to greater heights in places such as for service station &amp; garages. These jacks generate lifting power either by hydraulic or by mechanical means such as screw and nut by obtaining power from a power source externally such as electrical motor, engine or compressed air. These jacks are capable of lifting the vehicle completely. The hydraulic heavy jack used in service station mostly consist of a heavy cylinder fixed in such a way that the cylinder is buried in the ground and only the heavy piston rod along with a platform extends out during lifting of vehicle. The cylinder is mostly single acting, the piston rod along with platform retracts by the action of gravity. The heavy mechanical jacks mostly used in garages consists at least two columns which houses a screw and nut The nut is connected to the arms projecting outward from the columns to lift the vehicle . The rotation of the screw on each of the column is synchronized by the drive connecting the screws for the uniform lifting of the vehicle. In some cases these screw and nut are replaced with hydraulic cylinder.<br>
Some other smaller jack units are used to lift only a portion of the vehicle for replacing the tyres. These are mostly manually operated or some of them are integrated with motors. These jacks may be a simple screw and nut or small hydraulic cylinder along with hand pump to pump oil into the cylinder to<br>
2<br><br>
provide lift. In some jacks mechanical linkages are provided along with these screw nut and hydraulic cylinder to make it compact and to amplify the lifting capacity or height of the lift. In some cases huge air bags are used as jack, which can be put under the vehicle and inflated by connecting the hose on these bags to the silencer of vehicle to lift the vehicle.<br>
The draw back associated with the existing jacks.<br>
1.	These jacks are heavier and fixed on to the ground in order to lift the vehicle off the ground completely.<br>
2.	Additional leverage has to be provided to operate these jacks manually.<br>
3.	More effort is required to operate these jacks because of the restricted<br>
access below the vehicle.<br>
4.	Limited surface area of the jack and limited clearance below the vehicle makes it   impossible to pull out the vehicle when caught in the sludge.<br>
5.	On spot rotation of the vehicle is not possible using these jacks unless it is fixed on to the ground.<br>
6.	The air bags take time to inflate and are not stable.<br>
7.	Time consuming and tiered some operation.<br>
8.	This jack unit has a limitation for both lifting and on spot rotation of the vehicle.<br>

Brief description of the invention<br>
The improved jack to lift and rotate the vehicle in its position consists of a rotating unit with long arms projecting radial outward from the rotating unit. The long arms stabilize the eccentric weight/moment on the jack acting because of vehicles ladden and unladden weight and even when the vehicle is in an inclined plane and is to be turned. The rotating unit is fixed on to the sliding column by means of bearings and is capable of rotating in the sliding column. The rotating unit consists of a ring gear that meshes with the gear on the motor shaft. The motor may be hydraulic or electrical actuated and is fixed on to the sliding column by<br>
4<br><br>
means of a support. The rotation of the motor causes the rotating unit to rotate. The sliding column slides in and out of the fixed frame. The mainframe is mounted on to the vehicle in between the space available and near to the center of gravity and at the center of the vehicle. The main frame is capable of taking the total load of the vehicle when it is in the lifted position. The sliding column unit movement in and out of the fixed frame causes the vehicle to be lifted off and brought back on to the ground respectively. The sliding column unit movement is caused by action linear hydraulic actuator either double acting or telescopic fixed to the main frame and sliding column unit at each opposite ends respectively. The linear hydraulic actuator, hydraulic motor is fed with pressurized oil from the solenoid valves, delivered from hydraulic pump coupled to the engine by means of electromagnetic clutch. When the sliding unit slides out to lift the vehicle there are sensor provided to sense the position of the sliding column unit and the rotating units arm position. Mechanical locks are provided on the main frame for safety. This mechanical lock unit locks the sliding column unit into the main frame. Thus provides safety when the vehicle is under movement. These locks can also be manually operated. A manually operated screw fixed on to the fixed frame is provided to lift the jack off the ground in case of complete failure so that it does not disrupt vehicle movement.<br>
The Microcontroller unit is placed along with RF receiver either on the fixed frame or in any place available in the vehicle. This Microcontroller unit receives all the feed back from sensor and switches through cables/connectors and performs the necessary operation. The system can be made to operate manually by the switches provided or by means of a RF transmitter which is interfaced with its receiver in the vehicle. The axis of lift, rotation and the point of diagonal intersection of the vehicle may be co-axial in case of front wheel driven vehicle and the axis of sliding is offset Ted from the axis of the rotation and the point of diagonal intersection of the vehicle in order to accommodate space for the drive component of the rear wheel drive.<br>

Now with reference to Fig 1 and Fig 2. Where in the mainframe (1) is fixed onto the vehicle at the chassis or reinforcement member of the vehicle body. The mainframe (1) is capable of taking all the load of the vehicle laden and unladden weight. The sliding column (2) is housed inside the mainframe (1).The sliding column unit slides in and out of the fixed frame by the action of the linear hydraulic actuator (3) and is not capable of turning in the mainframe. The linear hydraulic actuator (3) is connected to the mainframe(l) at the top by means of pin (10) and to the sliding column unit(2) at the bottom by means of pin (11). The pressurized oil pumped by means of pump (13) coupled to the engine is fed into the linear hydraulic actuator (3) through solenoid valve (12) causes the vehicle to lift and get it down as per solenoid valve(12)direction. The rotating unit (4) is mounted onto the sliding column unit (2) at the bottom by means of bearings (5), the bearings are held onto the sliding column by lock nut (16). The rotating unit consists of a ring gear (9) which meshes with the gear (8) fixed on shaft of the hydraulic or electric motor (7). The hydraulic or electrical motor (7) is mounted onto the sliding column unit (2) and rotates the rotating unit (4) either in clockwise or anticlockwise direction when actuated. At least three arms (6) are fixed onto the rotating unit (4). The arm(6) stabilizes the vehicle from toppling because of any uneven weight. At the end of each arm is provided a adjustable spacer (18) to provide extra height of lift when needed. The weight carried by the arm (6) is transmitted to the rotating unit (4) further transmitted on to the sliding column unit (2) by means of the bearings (5) provided. A mechanical safety lock (14) mounted on the mainframe (1) locks the sliding column unit (2) into the main frame (1). The lock (14) provides safety while the vehicle is in motion The sliding column unit (2) will not slide out of the mainframe (1) unless the lock is released manually even though the jack is operated. The lock is operated manually and can be kept in unlock position when the jack is frequently used. The jack is also provided with pull back Screws and nut unit(15), which is fixed on to the mainframe (1) and can be made to connect with the sliding column unit (2) manually. The function of this pull back Screws and nut unit is to pull back the sliding unit (2) into the mainframe(l) manually by means of handle provided for the rotation of the screws when the jack completely fails to operates.<br>
7<br><br>
Thus avoiding any obstruction for the vehicle movement because of the jack failure.<br>
The operation of the system: The vehicle is lifted by sliding out of the sliding column unit (2) from the mainframe (1) caused by the linear hydraulic actuator(3).Once the vehicle is lifted and the wheels are released from the ground the vehicle can be turned to any desired angle by the action of the hydraulic/electric motor (7).After the rotation/turning of the vehicle is complete the vehicle is brought back to the ground by action of the linear hydraulic actuator (3) by pulling the sliding column unit (2) into the main frame (1).<br>
FIG 3. Shows the top view of the jack fitted to the vehicle with a rear drive. The point of intersection (19) of the diagonals (20) of the vehicle coincides with the center (21) of the rotating unit (4). The mainframe (1) axis and the sliding column (2) axis coincide at point (22) and is offset from the point of intersection (19) of the diagonals (20) of the vehicle and the center (21) of the rotating unit (4). This in done in order to provide provision for the transmission parts such as the propeller shaft and the joint in case a vehicle with rear wheel drive, as shown by dotted lines. The offset shown is towards right side and may vary to the left side as per the space required for the transmission in different types of rear wheel drive vehicle. The center of rotation (21) must coincide with the point of intersection (19) of the diagonals (20) so that all the corners of the vehicle will pass equally when vehicle is lifted and rotated. All the arms (6) are projected radial outwards as much as possible towards the sides of the vehicle seeing that it does not project out of the vehicle. This extension is given in order to stabilize the vehicle from toppling while turning in an inclined terrain and when unevenly loaded. The mainframe (1) is supported onto the chassis or any other reinforcement. The hydraulic pump (17) is connected to the engine directly or by means of electromechanical clutch (24). The solenoid valves (12, 13) required for the controlling the jack actuation are mounted on the mainframe (1). The reservoir (23) for hydraulic oil is placed either on the mainframe (1) or any other convenient space available.<br>
8<br><br>
FIG 4. Shows the top view of the jack fitted to the vehicle with a front wheel drive. The point of intersection (19) of the diagonals (20) of the vehicle coincides with the center (21) of the rotating unit (4). The mainframe (1) axis and the sliding column unit(2) axis coincidence at point (22). The point (22) also coincides with the point (19) of intersection of the diagonal (20) of the vehicle and the center (21) of the rotating unit. This is possible because the transmission is provided to the front wheel and need not be taken to the rear wheel thus eliminating any offset required as in case of rear wheel drive. The center of rotation (21) must coincide with the point of intersection (19) of the diagonal so that all the corners of the vehicle will pass equally when vehicle is lifted and rotated. The mainframe (1) is fixed to the reinforcement provided in shell type body construction. The hydraulic pump (17) is connected to the engine directly or by means of electromechanical clutch (24) or run directly by means of electric motor connected to the battery. The solenoid valves (12, 13) required for the controlling the different actuation of the jack are mounted on the mainframe (1). The reservoir (23) for hydraulic oil is placed either on the mainframe (1) or any other convenient space available.<br>
FIG 5 Shows the hydraulic circuit for lifting and rotating of the vehicle. For the jack to operate, different types of hydraulic circuit can be applied, but the circuit should serve the basic requirement for linear actuation and the rotation required to lift the vehicle and to rotate. The hydraulic pump (17) is coupled to the engine. The pump flow is transmitted through hoses to the manifold block which consist of a relief valve (25) solenoid valve (12) &amp; (13) flow control valve (26) and these solenoids are in turn connected to the linear hydraulic actuator (3) and hydraulic motor (7) respectively. The flow from the pump (17) is transmitted to the solenoid valve by providing a relief valve (25) connection immediately next to the pump (17). The relief valve (25) safe guards the hydraulic system and maintains the determined pressure in the system. The solenoid valve (12) pertaining to the linear hydraulic actuator (3) when electrically actuated allows oil to flow into the<br>
9<br><br>
linear hydraulic actuator (3) and the vehicle gets lifted and now when the solenoid (13) pertaining to the hydraulic motor (7) is actuated it either turns the vehicle in clockwise or anti clock wise direction as per the valve (13) direction. The speed of the motor (7) is controlled by a flow control valve (26) provided in series with the solenoid valve (13) and the hydraulic motor (7). Now when the solenoid valve (12) direction is reversed pertaining to hydraulic linear actuator (3) the vehicle is brought back to the ground from the lifted position.<br>
FIG 6 Shows another embodiment of this invention having hydraulic circuit for lifting and electrical circuit for rotating the vehicle.<br>
The thicker line connecting the component indicates hydraulic hoses forming a hydraulic circuit and shown inside a dotted box and thinner line indicate electrical wire forming a electrical circuit outside the dotted box. In this case the vehicle can be lifted and rotated without starting the engine.<br>
The hydraulic pump (17) is coupled to the D.C motor (27).The flow from the pump is transmitted through hoses to the manifold block which consist of a relief valve (25) solenoid valve (12) the solenoid is in turn connected to the hydraulic linear actuator (3). The flow from the hydraulic pump (17) is transmitted to the solenoid valve by providing a relief valve (25) immediately next to the pump (17) The relief valve (25) safe guards the hydraulic system and maintains the determined pressure in the system. The solenoid valve (12) pertaining to the linear hydraulic actuator (3) when electrically actuated allows oil to flow into the linear actuator (3) and the vehicle gets lifted because of the extension of linear hydraulic actuator (3).When the solenoid valve (12) direction is reversed pertaining to linear hydraulic actuator (3) the vehicle is brought back to the ground from the lifted position. The speed of the D.C motor (27) connected to the hydraulic pump (17) is controlled by the motor control unit (28) which is in turn connected microcontroller^) shown in fig8 The motor control unit(28) helps to adjust the speed of lifting the vehicle and getting it back to ground.<br>
The power required by the D.C motor (7) for rotation of the vehicle is delivered from the battery (29) and the battery is charged by the dynamo in the<br>
10<br><br>
vehicle. The D.C motor (7) for the rotation of the vehicle is connected to a motor control unit (28) which is in turn connected to the battery (29). The switch for operation of the motor(7) is connected to the motor control unit (28). When the switches on the switch panel is pressed the motor control unit (28) senses it and turns the electrical motor (7) either in clockwise or anticlockwise direction as required. The speed of the D.C motor (7) can be controlled by the adjustment on the motor control unit (28).<br>
FIG 7 Shows the position of various sensors used in jack with each sensor sensing specific position of the jack, controlling certain operation and some acting as safety sensor. These sensor inputs are fed to micro-controller to control complete operation of the jack and some functional features related to it. Sensor(30) mounted on the mainframe(l) helps in arrest arm rotation until the sliding column unit (2) slides a little out of the mainframe (1), so that the arm (6) may not hit any vital components of the vehicle until there is a clear space for the arm (6) to rotate below the vehicle during its automatic positioning. Sensor (31) mounted on the mainframe (1) helps to stop the retraction of the sliding column unit (8) in to the main frame at a determined position at which the arm (6) should fly back to its original position and is called as automatic positioning,<br>
Sensor (32) mounted on the sliding column unit (2) helps in sensing whether the arm (6) has reached its original position during the automatic positioning, When this condition is achieved the sensor(32) provides signal for the further retraction of the sliding column unit (2) into the main frame (1).<br>
Sensor (33) mounted on the mainframe (1) helps to see whether the system is locked mechanically by the manual lock (14) and gives an indication stating it. Sensor (34) mounted on the mainframe (1) helps in safety, to indicate accidentally sliding out of the sliding column unit (2) when the vehicle is moving. Sensor (35) mounted on the pullback unit senses, whether the pullback screw (15) on the fixed frame is engaged with the nut on the sliding column unit (2). If so, then the jack will not operate instead it will indicate the locking until the<br>
11<br><br>
locking is released, thus avoiding excessive loading on the pull back screw(15) causing it to fail if at all the sliding column(2) slides out because of linear actuation by the hydraulic actuator (3).<br>
Sensor (36) placed on the four outer most corner of the vehicle senses whether the vehicle will hit any obstacle while turning. If obstacle found it ceases further rotation of the vehicle.<br>
FIG 8 Shows the block diagram of the Micro controller(37) interfaced with sensing, switching, RF receiver, relay drive, motor control unit along with transmitter interfaced to the receiver. The micro-controller (37) takes the control of all the functioning of the jack by the input from the sensors, switches (42), RF receiver (38). The micro-controller (37) fed with input from sensors, switches(42) and RF transmitter(39) performs lot of logic sequences and controls the total jack by switching the relays (41) through relay drives(40) and controlling electrical motor(26,7) through motor control unit(27). These relays(41) are numbered so that the microcontroller^) identifies each one of them thus knowing to what they are further connected. These relays(41) are connected to varies hydraulic solenoid valves(12,13), relays carrying greater current, buzzer, indicator to indicate specific operation and safety systems and sensors. The RF receiver(38) and transmitter(39) connected to the microcontroller^) also helps in lifting vehicle on and off the ground ,also to turn the vehicle either clockwise or in the anticlockwise direction from a safe place by remote means, thus avoiding any collision while turning. The remote starting and stopping of the vehicle is also possible.<br>
The sensors feeds micro-controller(37) with vital information regarding the position of sliding column unit(2) the rotating arm(6), the manual lock(14) position, the screw and nut unit(15) whether locked or not, whether the vehicle will collide with any obstacle while turning. The microcontroller^) will sense the input form each sensor and perform the functioning of the jack as mention in figure7.Also the sensor provide information to the Microcontroller^), whether the hand brake is applied or not, whether the gear  of the vehicle is in neutral<br>
12<br><br>
position or not. It also sense whether the vehicle has started or in off condition to see that it does not start it if already started so as to avoid any damage to the starter unit. The switches (42) are provided for the manual operation of the system The switches input are fed to microcontroller (37) which carries out particular operation pertaining to that switch.<br>
