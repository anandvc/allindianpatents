Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates, in general, to surgery and, more particularly, to<br>
a method of performing a surgical procedure on the digestive system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0003] The percentage of the world population suffering from morbid obesity is<br>
steadily increasing. Severely obese persons are susceptible to increased risk of heart<br>
disease, stroke, diabetes, pulmonary disease, and accidents. Because of the effect of<br>
morbid obesity to the life of the patient, methods of treating morbid obesity are being<br>
researched.<br>
[0004] Numerous non-operative therapies for morbid obesity have been tried with<br>
virtually no permanent success. Dietary counseling, behavior modification, wiring a<br>
patient's jaws shut, and pharmacologic methods have all been tried, and though<br>
temporarily effective, failed to correct the condition. Further, introducing an object in<br>
the stomach, such as an esophago-gastric balloon, to fill the stomach have also been<br>
used to treat the condition; however, such approaches tend to cause irritation to the<br>
stomach and are not effective long-term.<br>
[0005] Surgical treatments of morbid obesity have been increasingly used with<br>
greater success. These approaches may be generalized as those that reduce the<br>
effective size of the stomach, limiting the amount of food intake, and those that create<br>
malabsorption of the food that it is eaten. For instance, some patients benefit from<br>
adjustable gastric bands [AGB) that are advantageously laparoscopically placed about<br>
the stomach to form a stoma of a desired size that allows food to fill an upper portion<br>
of the stomach, causing a feeling of satiety. To allow adjustment of the size of the<br>
stoma after implantation, a fluid conduit communicates between an inwardly<br>
presented fluid bladder of the AGB to a fluid injection port subcutaneously placed in<br>
front of the patient's sternum. A syringe needle may then inject or withdraw fluid as<br>
desired to adjust the AGB.<br>
[0006] Although an effective approach to obesity for some, other patients may find<br>
the lifestyle changes undesirable, necessitated by the restricted amount of food intake.<br>
In addition, the medical condition of the patient may suggest the need for a more<br>
permanent solution. To that end, surgical approaches have been used to alter the<br>
portions of the stomach and/or small intestine available for digesting food. Current<br>
methods of performing a laparoscopic anastomoses for a gastric bypass include<br>
stapling, suturing, and placing biofragmentable rings, each having significant<br>
challenges. For instance, suturing is time consuming, as well as being technique and<br>
dexterity dependent. Stapling requires placement of an anvil, which is a large device<br>
that cannot be introduced through a trocar port. Having to introduce the port through a<br>
laparotomy presents an increased incidence of wound site infection associated with<br>
intralumenal content being dragged to the laparotomy entry site.<br>
[0007] As an example of the latter approach, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,543,456 a method for<br>
gastric bypass surgery includes the insertion of proximal and distal anastomosis<br>
members [e.g., anvils) transorally with grasping forceps. The stomach and the small<br>
intestine are transected endoscopically by a surgical severing and stapling instrument<br>
to create a gastric pouch, a drainage loop, and a Roux limb. An endoscopically<br>
inserted circular stapler attaches to the distal anastomosis member to join the drainage<br>
loop to a distal portion of the intestine, and the circular stapler attaches to the<br>
proximal anastomosis member to join the Roux limb to the gastric pouch. Thereafter,<br>
the anastomosis members are removed to create an orifice between joined portions of<br>
the stomach and intestine. This method reduces the number of laparoscopic ports,<br>
avoids a laparoscopic insertion of an anastomosis instrument (e.g., circular stapler)<br>
into an enlarged surgical port, and eliminates the need for an enterotomy and an<br>
enterotomy closure.<br>
[0008] While methods such as that described are a marked improvement over<br>
generally known gastric bypass and similar surgical treatments for morbid obesity, it<br>
would be desirable to achieve a gastric bypass with yet fewer procedural steps and<br>
with fewer laparoscopic insertions. Such an approach is described in U.S. Pat, Appl.<br>
Publ. No. US 2003/0032967 to Park et al., wherein gastrointestinal or enteric<br>
(including biliary) anastomosis is achieved by insertion of a sheath that perforates the<br>
walls of two tissue passages, such as the stomach and small intestine. A three-<br>
dimensional woven tube of wire of having a thermal shape memory effect (SME) is<br>
presented by a cannula of the sheath on both sides of the openings. Use of SME<br>
material in a cuff-like arterial bypass has been previously used, as described in U.S.<br>
Pat. Nos. 5,676,670, 5,797,920 and 6,007,544. Deployment of the woven tube causes<br>
the outer loops or ends of the tube to fold or loop back to hold the luminal interface of<br>
the anastomosis site in apposition. Thereby, the need for a mechanical compression<br>
component in a delivery system is reduced or avoided, reducing the size and<br>
complexity of the delivery device.<br>
[0009] While this generally known ring device is a significant advancement in the<br>
treatment of morbid obesity, it is believed that further improvements would be<br>
desirable for clinical effectiveness. In particular, the known ring device is a woven<br>
tube, or stent, that is purported to be a self-actuating anastomotic ring. Thus, an<br>
applier described for inserting the known ring device merely positions the ring device<br>
at the anastomotic site and deploys the ring device by pushing it off of a cannula,<br>
relying upon SME attributes of the ring device to cause actuation. Unfortunately, the<br>
generally known ring device sometimes will not actuate or transform from its stressed<br>
cylindrical state to its relaxed clamping state, perhaps due to irregularities in<br>
undulations of its woven designs create friction. One particular difficulty of known<br>
SME anastomotic rings are that they are designed to move from a generally<br>
cylindrical shape to a hollow rivet shape ("ring shape") by having wires that form the<br>
device move across one another. In particular, wires must move within a nodal point<br>
(i.e., an indentation or valley) created by the wire bend and must climb back out of the<br>
indentation. In some instances, the device fails to fully actuate on its own due to these<br>
sources of friction.<br>
[0010] While improvements to the ring device are also desirable, what would mitigate<br>
the shortcomings of the generally known ring device is a surgical tool, or applier, that<br>
affirmatively and rapidly forms the attachment at an anastomotic surgical site, without<br>
having to wait for SME actuating to slowly, if at all, effect attachment. However, such<br>
an applier would advantageously allow a single lumen access, unlike the previously<br>
known anastomosis procedures that required insertion of anvils and circular staplers.<br>
[0011] Moreover, it is believed that having to rely upon an SME actuation sufficiently<br>
strong to move from the stressed, unactuated position to the relaxes, actuated position<br>
limits the range of material properties and dimensions that otherwise may be selected.<br>
For instance, a thinner gauge wire strand may advantageously provide sufficient<br>
holding strength until the anastomosis attachment heals, yet releases easily later for<br>
letting the now unnecessary ring device to pass out of the patient. Yet, this thinner<br>
gauge wire strand would be unable to incorporate sufficient SME strength to<br>
overcome internal friction and to draw together apposite tissue walls during actuation.<br>
[0012] In addition, a current challenge for using a single lumen anastomosis<br>
procedure is that it is desired for clinical efficiency and for minimizing patient<br>
recovery time that the anastomosis site be approached from one side of the apposite<br>
pair of tissue walls of two adjacent tissue passages (e.g., stomach and small intestine).<br>
Yet, only one of the tissue walls and a proximal side of a deployed ring device are<br>
readily visible from this vantage point, when viewed by an endoscope or similar<br>
optical imaging device. Confirming that a successful anastomotic attachment has<br>
occurred is highly desirable.<br>
[0013] Consequently, there is a general need for an approach to anastomosis that will<br>
use existing trocar ports (e.g., 12 mm size) with a minimum of suturing. Moreover,<br>
aspects of the method should have application to endoscopic surgery. To that end, a<br>
significant need exists for an anastomosis device that reliably and effectively deploys<br>
and actuates to eliminate the need for surgical stapling and suturing to form an<br>
anastomosis.<br>
Brief Summary of the Invention<br>
[0014] The invention overcomes the above-noted and other deficiencies of the prior<br>
art by providing a<br>
[0015] In one aspect of the invention, a surgical instrument has an actuating member<br>
that is moveable between a cylindrical, unactuated position and a hollow rivet<br>
forming shape for implanting an anastomotic ring device. A handle of the instrument<br>
has an actuation mechanism produces a compressive actuating force that is transferred<br>
down an elongate cannula that distally supports the actuating member to actuate the<br>
actuating member. Thereby, the anastomotic ring device is affirmatively placed into<br>
position without having to rely solely upon a self-actuating capability of the ring<br>
device.<br>
[0016] These and other objects and advantages of the present invention shall be made<br>
apparent from the accompanying drawings and the description thereof.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0029] Turning to the Drawings, wherein like numerals denote like components<br>
throughout the several views, FIG. 1 depicts an applier 10 that advantageously<br>
laparoscopically or endoscopically deploys and actuates an anastomotic ring device<br>
12 from a generally cylindrical shape to one having properties of a hollow rivet, or<br>
ring, capable of forming an astomotic attachment at an anastomosis target site, such as<br>
in a bariatric gastric bypass of a morbidly obese patient 16. In the illustrative version,<br>
the anastomotic ring device 12 comprises a shape memory effect (SME) material such<br>
as nitinol that further assists in actuation to an engaging hollow rivet shape.<br>
[0030] It will be appreciated that the terms "proximal" and "distal" are used herein<br>
with reference to a clinician gripping a handle of the applier 10. It will be further<br>
appreciated that for convenience and clarity, spatial terms such as "right", "left",<br>
"vertical" and "horizontal" are used herein with respect to the drawings. However,<br>
surgical instruments are used in many orientations and positions, and these terms are<br>
not intended to be limiting and absolute. In addition, aspects of the invention have<br>
application to surgical procedures performed endoscopically and laparoscopically, as<br>
well as an open procedure. Use herein of one of these or similar terms should not be<br>
construed to limit the present invention for use in only one category of surgical<br>
procedure.<br>
[0031] Anastomotic Ring Device Applier.<br>
[0032] In FIG. 2, the applier 10 has the anastomotic ring device 12 advantageously<br>
retained in a generally cylindrical shape upon a cannula 13 protected by an outer tube<br>
(or sheath) 18 that covers the ring device 12 until a knob 19 is rotated, drawing back<br>
the outer tube 18 to expose the ring device 12 prior to actuation. The ring device 12 is<br>
received upon a molded actuation member 20 that is connected at its midpoint to a<br>
stationary tube 22. Distal to the molded actuation member 20 is a tapered tip 24. This<br>
tapered tip 24 may include a distal piercing surface 26 to assist in forming an<br>
anastomotic opening 28 through apposite tissue walls 30, 32 of two gastrointestinal<br>
passages. As discussed below, the tapered tip 24 may advantageously include<br>
illumination features that allow confirmation of placement and actuation of the<br>
anastomotic ring device 12 when viewed from a proximal direction through<br>
translucent tissue walls 30, 32.<br>
[0033] The molded actuation member 20 may be formed as a generally rectangular<br>
piece that is wrapped around a mandrel. Then the longitudinal edges that come<br>
together may be adhered or fused together. Alternatively, snap rings may be attached<br>
over each longitudinal end (i.e., proximal and distal) and the midpoint to hold the<br>
molded actuation member 20 together.<br>
[0034| With reference to FIGS. 2-5, a handle 34, proximal to the cannula 13, includes<br>
a pair of longitudinally aligned triggers 36, 38. The proximal trigger 36, shown at its<br>
most proximal, unfired position, is coupled to proximal leaves 40 of the molded<br>
actuation member 20 via an intermediate tube 42 of the cannula 13. Distal movement<br>
of the proximal trigger 36 thus causes longitudinal distal movement of the<br>
intermediate tube 42 and proximal leaves 40, which outwardly actuate like an<br>
umbrella by a cantilevered, hinged relationship to a central portion 44 of the molded<br>
actuation member 20, which in turn is mechanically grounded to a distal end of the<br>
stationery tube 22 that extends out of the intermediate tube 42. Similarly, the distal<br>
trigger 28, shown at its most distal, unfired position, is coupled to distal leaves 46 of<br>
the molded actuation member 20 via an internal tube 48 that is coupled for movement<br>
within and extends distally out of the stationary tube 22. Proximal movement of the<br>
distal trigger 38 causes longitudinal proximal movement of the internal tube 48 and<br>
distal leaves 50 of the molded actuation member 20, which outwardly actuate by a<br>
hinged relationship to the central portion 44.<br>
[0035] It should be appreciated that thus either trigger 36, 38 may be moved<br>
individually to actuate only a proximal or a distal portion of the actuating member 20.<br>
Thus, the proximal leaves 40 may be actuated within a proximal lumen in order to use<br>
the cannula 13 to position the proximal lumen to the distal lumen prior to inserting the<br>
tapered tip 24 into the distal lumen. Alternatively, the cannula 13 may be inserted into<br>
the distal lumen, the distal leaves 46 may be actuated, and the distal lumen drawn<br>
back into contact with the proximal lumen.<br>
[0036] Inserting the cannula 13 into the distal lumen and later withdrawing the<br>
cannula 13 from both the distal and proximal lumens is facilitated by incorporating a<br>
tapered tip 24 with a distal piercing surface 26 in the form of a veress needle that<br>
avoids inadvertent damage to tissue and may advantageously inflate the lumens. The<br>
veress needle has a syringe knife tip within which a ball translates. As the veress<br>
needle 26 is pressed against the tissue walls 30, 32, the ball springedly withdraws into<br>
the veress needle 26 exposing the piercing surfaces. Once through, tissue more distal<br>
is generally not positioned under tension and is displaced by the extended ball rather<br>
than traumatically encountering the knife tip. The veress needle 26 may<br>
advantageously be in pneumatic communication with a hollow internal tube 48 with<br>
the ball presenting a lateral orifice when extended. Thus, air pressure may be<br>
introduced into the proximal and distal lumens so that the actuating member may<br>
actuate without being impeded by collapsed tissue and also be withdrawn without<br>
impediment. An air port on the handle 34 that communicates with the veress needle<br>
26 provides a port for the insufflation. For a relatively small port (e.g., 1/16 inch), the<br>
port may be left unclosed when not in use without allowing a significant amount of air<br>
loss through the instrument 10.<br>
[0037] As depicted in FIG. 3 in phantom, the tapered tip 24 may further include a<br>
distal sheath 51 that cooperates with the outer tube 18 to shield the actuating member<br>
20 during insertion and removal from the patient.<br>
[0038] As best viewed in FIGS. 4-5, within the handle 34, a cavity 52 includes<br>
proximal and distal apertures 54, 56 to allow the longitudinal movement of the<br>
proximal and distal triggers 36, 38 respectively. Each trigger 36, 38 includes a right<br>
opening aperture 58 that engage for longitudinal movement a leftward projecting<br>
track 60 formed within the cavity 52 of a right half shell of the handle 34.<br>
10039] Moving from most distal to most proximal, a first, second and third lateral<br>
ridge 62, 64, 66 across the bottom of the cavity 52 define a first, second, third, and<br>
fourth cavity segment 68, 70, 72, 74 respectively. A first block 76, formed from left<br>
and right halves 78, 80 is positioned for movement within the first cavity segment 68.<br>
A longitudinal central hole 82 defined between the two halves 78, 80 engages and<br>
moves with a terminating proximal end 84 of the intermediate tube 42.<br>
[0040] The stationary tube 22 passes out proximally from the intermediate tube 42<br>
into the second cavity segment 70. A second spacer block 90 locked within the second<br>
cavity segment 70 has a longitudinal central hole 92 defined between its left and right<br>
halves 94, 95 that engages the stationary tube 22, locking it into place relative the<br>
handle 34.<br>
[0041] The internal tube 48 passes proximally out of the stationary tube 22 on<br>
through the third and fourth cavity segments 72-74 into sliding contact with a hole 86<br>
passing through a proximal end 88 of the handle 34. A third sliding block 96 has a<br>
longitudinal central hole 98 defined between its upper and lower halves 100,102 that<br>
engage and move with the internal tube 48. A lower portion 104 of the distal trigger<br>
38 is attached to a distal face of the third sliding block 96. A fourth sliding block 106<br>
within the fourth cavity segment 74 has a longitudinal central hole 108 that slidingly<br>
contacts the internal tube 48. A lower portion 114 of the proximal trigger 36 is<br>
attached to a proximal face of the fourth sliding block 106. A link 116 is attached to<br>
the left sides of the first and fourth sliding blocks 76, 106.<br>
[0042] In FIG. 6, the triggers 36, 38 have been slid toward one another to actuate the<br>
molded actuating member 20. Specifically, the distal trigger 38 has been moved<br>
proximally, moving the third sliding block 96 and internal tube 48, the distal<br>
terminating end of the latter being attached to tapered tip 24. The tapered tip thus<br>
moves toward the distal end of the intermediate tube 42. The proximal trigger 36 has<br>
been moved distally, moving fourth sliding block 106, link 116, first sliding block 76,<br>
and intermediate tube 42 also distally. The distal portion of the molded actuating<br>
member 20 is compressed between the inwardly moving tapered tip 24 and the central<br>
portion 44 that is arrested by the stationary tube 22. The distal leaves 50 actuate<br>
lateral to the longitudinal axis, and move toward and interdigitate with the proximal<br>
leaves 40, the latter having been actuated by distal movement of the intermediate tube<br>
48 compressing against the central portion 44. This movement expedites actuating of<br>
an anastomotic ring device (not shown in FIG. 6).<br>
[0043] In use, the tapered tip 24 of the applier 10 is inserted through a trocar port into<br>
a tissue passage that has been placed proximate to another tissue passage that are to be<br>
anastomotically joined (See FIGS. 1-2). The tapered tip 24 and a distal half of the<br>
molded actuating member 20 and anastomotic ring device 12 are inserted through an<br>
anastomotic opening 28 formed therebetween and then the applier is actuated, with a<br>
partially actuated applier 10 being depicted in FIGS. 7-8. Positioning of the distal and<br>
proximal lumens is facilitated by separately actuating half of the actuating member 20<br>
and by inflating the lumens by passing pressurized air through the instrument 10.<br>
With particular reference to FIG. 8, the proximal and distal leaves 40, 50 are shown as<br>
having gripping slots 118 that grip respective petals 120 of the anastomotic ring<br>
device 12, especially in its unactuated, generally cylindrical shape. An inwardly<br>
directed retention tip 121 or other gripping features in the gripping slots 118 may be<br>
incorporated to enhance retention. These gripping slots 118 assist in preventing the<br>
anastomotic ring device 12 from slipping off of the applier 10 or being<br>
inappropriately placed thereon for actuation. In FIGS. 9-10, the applier 10 has been<br>
fully actuated, forming the anastomotic ring device 12 into a hollow rivet shape to<br>
form the anastomotic attachment between tissue walls 30, 32. The fully actuated<br>
proximal and distal leaves 40, 50 cause the petals 120 to disengage from the gripping<br>
slots 118. Thereafter, the applier 10 is returned to an unactuated condition and the<br>
actuated anastomotic ring device 12 deployed by withdrawing the tapered tip 24 from<br>
the anastomotic opening 28 and ring device 12, as depicted in FIG. 11.<br>
[0044] Deployment Illumination.<br>
[0045] In FIGS. 7, 9, a distal portion of the anastomotic ring device 12 are depicted in<br>
phantom to illustrate their actuated position. This phantom depiction is also<br>
suggestive of a clinical advantage of being able to view the deployment condition<br>
from a proximal point of view. Typically, an endoscope will view the anastomotic<br>
opening 28 from a proximal position. Returning to FIGS, 2-7, adding a deployment<br>
illumination feature to the applier 10 provides this ability to view deployment through<br>
translucent tissue walls. Specifically, an illumination power source (e.g., battery) 150<br>
and control (e.g., switch) 152 are incorporated into the handle 34 with a conductor,<br>
depicted as a twisted wire pair 154 passing through the internal tube 48 to the tapered<br>
tip 24, which includes a proximally directed electroluminescence device 156.<br>
Alternatively conductive ink traces may be applied longitudinally down portions of<br>
the applier 10 to provide an electrical circuit to the tapered tip 24. An externally<br>
accessible push button 158 drives the power source 150 against the control 152,<br>
creating an illumination circuit with the electroluminescence device 156.<br>
[0046] Alternatively or in addition, the molded actuating member 20 may be formed<br>
of a fluorescent or electroluminescent material that is either stimulated prior to<br>
insertion or receives light from a light source of the applier 10.<br>
[0047] While the present invention has been illustrated by description of several<br>
embodiments and while the illustrative embodiments have been described in<br>
considerable detail, it is not the intention of the applicant to restrict or in any way<br>
limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail. Additional advantages and<br>
modifications may readily appear to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0048] As one example of an equivalent structure that may be used to implement the<br>
present invention, hydraulics, electronics, or pneumatics may be used to move<br>
cannula 13 relative to handle 34. Computer control could be used with electronics and<br>
a feedback loop to move tube 14 and to selectively tension a force element based on<br>
the amount of tissue force applied. As a further example of an equivalent structure<br>
that may be used to implement the present invention, robotics could be used with<br>
anastomosis device 10 attached to a controlled robotic arm that moves the mechanism<br>
of anastomosis device 10 to effect an anastomosis.<br>
[0049] As a further example of an equivalent structure, cannula 13 could become a<br>
flexible tube, and the mechanisms within cannula 13 may become flexible to<br>
maneuver through a long lumen, such as a section of small bowel, to effect an<br>
anastomosis through a long, flexible lumen. Such a long, flexible tube may be used<br>
laparoscopically or endoscopically.<br>
[0050] As a further example of an equivalent structure, applier 10 could have a long,<br>
rigid, curved tube, or a long, rigid, straight tube, and applier 10 could be placed<br>
through an obturator port and used laparoscopically or endoscopically. Length and<br>
curvature becomes advantageous in endoscopic or laproscopic surgery, especially<br>
when performing a surgical procedure on a bariatric patient. In either a rigid or a<br>
flexible form of an applier 10, restriction of gas flow through the instrument becomes<br>
advantageous when maintenance of a pneumoperitoneum is desired as in, for<br>
example, endoscopic surgery.<br>
[0051] As a further example of an equivalent structure and method that may be used<br>
to implement the present invention, applier 10 may have a geometry small enough to<br>
be conveniently placed through the opening of a hand port used for hand-assisted<br>
laproscopic surgery, such as, for example, the Lap-Disk® hand port sold by Ethicon<br>
Endo-Surgery in Cincinnati, Ohio. A surgeon using applier 10 through a hand port<br>
may use an endoscope through a secondary port for visualization, and may also<br>
maintain a pneumoperitoneum. The surgeon may also make use of trocars, graspers,<br>
cutters, and other endoscopic instruments inserted through auxiliary ports to assist in<br>
grasping lumens or creating otomies in lumens to perform surgical procedures such as<br>
anastomoses.<br>
[0052] As a further example of an equivalent structure and method that may be used<br>
to implement the present invention, a long, rigid version of applier 10, or a long,<br>
flexible embodiment of applier 10 may be used through an auxiliary port while tissue<br>
is manipulated by the surgeon using a hand placed through a hand port.<br>
[0053] As other examples of equivalent structures, the surface of tapered tip 24 may<br>
take many forms advantageous for various types of tissue manipulation, such as a<br>
conical tipped nose that is blunted for low tissue trauma and for good visibility past<br>
the distal end. As another example, a nose that is fluted to allow torque to be applied<br>
to tissue. As yet a further example, a nose may have a convex curve for rapid dilation<br>
of an otomy in a short space or a nose having a concave surface for gentle dilation of<br>
friable tissue. An offset swept nose may be used because of its asymmetry for better<br>
visibility to one side and may be used to assist in manipulation by using its<br>
asymmetry to minimally grasp tissue. A spherical nose may be used to produce a<br>
short length for operation in limited space and to reduce the chance of tissue trauma.<br>
Combinations of these surfaces may also be advantageous, for example, a nose having<br>
a concave surface may also possess flutes. Other combinations may occur to one<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
