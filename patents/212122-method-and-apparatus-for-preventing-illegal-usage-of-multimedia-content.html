				<td>Method and apparatus for preventing illegal usage of multimedia<br>
content<br>
The invention relates to a method for preventing illegal content<br>
copies of multimedia content while preserving sufficient<br>
flexibility for the legitimate content user.<br>
Background<br>
Current digital media like DAT and MiniDisk include a mechanism<br>
that prevents the generation of multiple digital copies<br>
of a content item. In that case, only one digital copy is authorized.<br>
With future digital multimedia systems, copy protection<br>
will become more sophisticated and even more enforcable.<br>
This may have the disadvantage that the legitimate user cannot<br>
freely move the content between different storage media<br>
(i.e., disks, tapes) since such a move implies that the content<br>
item is considered as "copied". Therefor further copies<br>
become illegal and will be prohibited by the device.<br>
If copies from digital multimedia sources are not made digitally<br>
but in the analog domain, copying is not restricted by<br>
the currently existing digital audio and video, however the<br>
quality is sacrificed.<br>
Otherwise, digital multimedia content, like digitally coded<br>
music in MP3 format can currently be downloaded with subscription<br>
from the Internet and afterwards freely copied<br>
without loss of quality and additional fees to the content<br>
owner.<br>
Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to disclose a novel<br>
method for preventing illegal usage of multimedia content<br>
while preserving sufficient flexibility for the legitimate<br>
content user and an apparatus performing such method.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by means<br>
of the features specified in main claims. Advantageous<br>
designs and developments are specified in subclaims.<br>
With the advent of digital multimedia content distribution<br>
formats, including digital music, video or software, the unauthorized<br>
copying of multimedia content items becomes more<br>
and more a problem from the perspective of the content author<br>
or rights owner. Restrictions on content accessibility are<br>
needed, however, they should not be a nuisance to a legitimate<br>
owner of the rights to use such a content item.<br>
It is assumed that multimedia content in future will be<br>
stored on mass storage devices, or media servers, that become<br>
part of the home entertainment equipment. On the other hand,<br>
there will be mobile devices used for play back. A content<br>
descriptor associated to each multimedia content item forms<br>
the basis for managing the use of content in a flexible manner<br>
from the perspective of the user, while still guaranteeing<br>
that any restrictions in the usage of the content are observed.<br>
Most notably, such content descriptors help to avoid<br>
unnecessary copying of the content item itself, by allowing<br>
to just move the right to use the content item from one device<br>
to another, instead of moving the complete multimedia<br>
content item, as detailed in this invention. Moving of the<br>
rights means that the multimedia content item at its new location<br>
is now the legitimate original that may be played back<br>
and from which, for example, one further copy may be derived,<br>
if permitted by the associated rights.<br>
In a simple embodiment, this can be accomplished by swapping<br>
the value of a flag indicating original or copy between the<br>
previous original and the new version of the item. In future<br>
digital systems with encrypted or partially encrypted content, this can be<br>
accomplished by the said content descriptor that describes the rights associated<br>
to a multimedia content item and that includes a location-specific decryption key.<br>
Advantageously, the original multimedia content item need not be deleted from<br>
the primary mass storage device, or media server, allowing for a temporary tease<br>
of play back rights to secondary, possibly mobile devices.<br>
Digital multimedia material, like audio, video, text, games, software, etc., will be<br>
available both on consumer electronics and computer platforms. The invention<br>
holds independent of the location of the item of multimedia content. It actually<br>
becomes more important in such a situation.<br>
Exemplary embodiments<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention are explained in more detail in the<br>
following description.<br>
The invention proposes multimedia content items 1 to be accompanied by<br>
content descriptors 2 that specify the legitimate rights that are associated to the<br>
content item 1 as depicted in Figure 1. Content descriptors 2 can be associated<br>
to multimedia content items by referencing object or stream identifiers related to<br>
the content item 1 in the content descriptor 2. In order to make such an<br>
association unambiguous and to ensure that it cannot be easily broken,<br>
advantageously a unique signature 3 for a content item 1 can be included in the<br>
content signal itself by means such as watermarking. The same signature 3 can<br>
then be referenced in the content descriptor 2. The content descriptor 2 is<br>
considered not visible to the user and made tamper-proof by means of<br>
authentication.<br>
Such a secure tie between the content descriptor conveying the usage rights<br>
information and the content item itself allows to establish procedures, as claimed<br>
in this invention, to copy the actual multimedia content item freely while<br>
maintaining tight control over the ability to use it. This is specifically important<br>
when content items are frequently swapped between different storage and play<br>
back devices, for example, a media server located in the users" home and a<br>
portable player device. Depending on the storage size of the portable device,<br>
frequently played content need not be copied from the media server each time.<br>
As long as the item is still physically present on the portable device, only the<br>
usage license, which is a rather small amount of data, has to be swapped<br>
between the media server and the portable device. Hence, content that is only<br>
authorized for a limited number of concurrently existing copies can be used<br>
efficiently on multiple devices.<br>
The procedure to transfer a multimedia content item and its associated usage<br>
rights, embedded in a content descriptor, from a primary storage device to a<br>
secondary device, possibly a player device, has to be tamper-proof. The<br>
following steps must be followed as shown in Figure 2. First the multimedia<br>
content item itself is copied 12 to the secondary device, if it is not yet present<br>
there 11. Secondly, the content descriptor is copied 13 to the secondary device.<br>
In case of encrypted or partially encrypted content, this descriptor will contain<br>
the decryption key valid for the primary device. Thirdly, the content descriptor<br>
on the primary device is removed 14. Then, fourthly, a new decryption key for<br>
use of the multimedia content item on the secondary device is generated and<br>
inserted in the copied content descriptor.<br>
The said procedure advantageosuly assumes that decryption keys are valid only<br>
for a single storage device or a single player application. Therefor, the copied<br>
multimedia content item with the copied content descriptor will not be playable<br>
on the secondary device before a new key has been generated.<br>
In that case the procedure is tamper-proof with respect to<br>
illicit duplication of licenses by interruption of the procedure .<br>
Advantageously, this procedure is handled by a piece of<br>
trusted software or dedicated hardware. In order to further<br>
improve security of this procedure, a secure communication<br>
channel should be used between the devices, especially if the<br>
transaction occurs in a wide area network, such as the Internet.<br>
Optionally, the trusted software or dedicated hardware<br>
may as well establish a secure communication channel to a<br>
third party that authorizes the said procedure. After this<br>
procedure, the multimedia content item is physically present<br>
on both the primary and the secondary device. However, it is<br>
only playable on the secondary device until the license, in<br>
the form of the content descriptor, is given back to the primary<br>
device.<br>
Optionally, an additional license may be generated, after<br>
payment of the applicable dues, to make the content on the<br>
primary device accessible independent of the license that has<br>
been transfered to the secondary device. Conversely, if the<br>
multimedia content item is no longer needed on the primary<br>
device, it can be physically deleted, since the secondary device<br>
now contains a copy that has all the rights previously<br>
associated to the original version of the item. Specifically,<br>
this includes usage rights and the right to move the multimedia<br>
content item to a further third device at any time. Usage<br>
rights might include the permission to generate one or more<br>
copies of the multimedia content item.<br>
Preferrably, the media server maintains a complete data base<br>
of multimedia content items at all times. The number of authorized<br>
playable copies from this data base may be controlled<br>
with the aforementioned procedure. Each time a copy<br>
is made, the license data base of the server is updated ap-<br>
propriately? Depending on the status of the license information,<br>
it may not be possible to derive further copies.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the content descriptor<br>
consists of a number of flags including an original/copy<br>
flag. The rights associated to the original include the permission<br>
to generate one digital copy of the content item,<br>
while no further copies may be generated from a content item<br>
already marked as copy.<br>
Moving the rights of a multimedia content item in that case<br>
corresponds to the following procedure: Copy the item of multimedia<br>
content first with the original/copy flag set to indicate<br>
"copy". Then reset the original/copy flag in the<br>
original file to "copy" status and set the original/copy flag<br>
in the new file to indicate "original". This is tamper-proof,<br>
since in case of power failure, etc. in the worst case both<br>
versions of the item will be labeled as copies. Optionally a<br>
verifying process can be invoked and, as a last step, the<br>
original item may be deleted if it is not retained as a copy.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment this procedure can apply<br>
not only to multimedia contents but to software applications<br>
like multimedia-players, dictionary, route-planner themselves.<br>
A content descriptor for multimedia content items contains at<br>
least one of the following elements:<br>
• A key for decryption<br>
• A cryption descriptor indicating the parts of the media<br>
file that are encrypted and the encryption scheme<br>
• A flag indicating the file is an original or a copy<br>
(orig/copy flag),<br>
• Copy bits for indicating the copy status, for example:<br>
CGMS bits and a copies-made counter<br>
A media active bit indicating the media file is usable by<br>
the device<br>
