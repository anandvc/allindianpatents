				<td>This invention relates to processes for synthesizing siloxane-imide-epoxy resins. The siloxane-imide-epoxy resins are obtained through the reaction of siloxane linkage containing diimide-diacids with siloxane epoxy resin or through the reaction of imide-diacids/diimide-diacids with siloxane epoxy resins or by epoxidation of siloxane linkage containing diimide-dtacids followed by curing with epoxy resin curatives.<br>
Presence of imide unit in the resins imparts toughness to the coating while siloxane group provides flexibility and atomic resistance. Epoxy groups or Structural units derived therefrom make the system versatile as in the case of other epoxy reains.<br>
Siloxane containing epoxy resins are synthesised either by reacting silands or linear siloxanes with spichlorohydrin in the presence of alkali or by the hydrosilylation reaction of allyl gtycidyl ether with silanes in the presence of Pt csftalyst Siloxane epoxy resins are widefy used as coatings, matrix resins for composites and as modifiers for conventional epoxy resins for imparling flexibility and thermal stability thereto.<br><br>
Siloxane-imides are synthesised by the reaction of siloxane linkage contaoing anhydrides with aromaticteliphatic diamines or by the reaction of siloxane linkage containing diamines with dianhydrides follwed by chemical or thermal inrtidization. these compounds find wide use in membrane production, atomic oxygen resistant coatings, structural adhesives and matrix resins for composites.<br>
Though considerable amount of literature is available on the synthesis of siloxane-epoxy resins and siloxane imides, synthesis of resins having a polymer backbone containing att the three units, namely, siloxane units, imide units and epoxy functional groups or structural units derived from epoxy functk)nal groups has not been reported. This type of resins are hereinafter referred to as siloxane-imide-epoxy resins.<br>
The main object of this invention is directed to a process for the preparation of a siloxane-imide-epoxy polymer or resin. Siloxane-imide-epoxy resin according to the invention may be prepared by reacting an .imide-diacid with an epoxy reein wherein either or both the imide diacid and the epoxy resin contains siloxane linkage. For instance thei resin of the subject  invention may be prepared by reacting siloxane epoxy resin with a diimkie-diacid or imide-diacid. It<br><br>
is also possible to achieve the same result by reacting an epoxy resin with a diimide-diacid containing siloxane linkage. Alternately, both the epoxy resin and the diimide-diacid may contain siloxane linkage)<br>
This invention relates to a process for the synthesis of siloxane-imide-epoxy resin which comprises reacting imide-diacid with epoxy resins, wherein the imide-diacid and/or the epoxy resin contain siloxane linkages, under known polymerization conditions and thereafter recovering the resin produced in a known manner.<br>
The imide-diacid used in the reaction may be a diimide-diacid which may be synthesised by the reaction of aliphatic or aromatic aminocarboxylic acid with trimellitic anhydride in an organic solvent such as acetone, dimethyl acetamide, dimethyl formamide or N-methyl pyrrollidone followed by imidization in a known manner.<br><br>
Preferably. 1 mole of imide-diacid or diimide-diacid is mixed with 1 mole erf siloxane containing diepoxy resm and cured at 140o for 30 mte, 170°C for 1 hour and 730oC fx 30 mts to obtain siloxane-imide-epoxy resin.<br>
In another altemative, siloxane containing diimide diacid is reacted with diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A. Siloxane containing diimide-diacid may be prepared by reading 1 mole of siloxane linkage containing diamine with two moles of trimellitic anhydride in an organic solvent such as acetone, dimethyl acetamide. dimethyl fromamide and the like followed by known imidization reaction. One mole of diimide-diacid obtained by this method is mixed with 1 mole of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol resin and cured at 135oC for 30 mts. 170oC for 1 hr and finally at 230oC for 30 mts.<br>
In another altemative siloxane containing diimide-diacid is reacted with siloxane containing epoxy resin. 1 mole of siloxane containing diimide-diacid is mixed with 1 mole of siloxane containing epoxy resin and cured at 210o C for 30 mts., 245oC for 1 h and finally at270°Cfor30mts,<br><br>
Siloxane-imide-epoxy resins disclosed hereinabove, are advantageous over siloxane imides, epoxy imides and siloxane epoxy resins as siloxane-imide-epoxy resins combine the features of all the three units namely, siloxane, epoxy and imide in one resin. Further, the siloxane, imide and epoxy content may be varied as desired.<br>
This invention also includes a process for synthesising atomic oxygen resistant coating. Siloxane containing epoxy imide resin is made to react with a siloxane containing diepoxy resin, a siloxane containing oligomeric diamine, and amine terminated polydimethyl<br><br>
siloxane in an organic solvent such as tatrahydrofuran, diglyme, dioxane, ethyl ketone and tsobuty) methyl ketone to get a 10% to 30% resin. This may the applied directly on substrates such as polyimide film, C-polyimide and glass polyimide composites. Coatings may be cured at 100oC to 160oC for 8 to 10 hours.<br>
Coated and uncoated samples of Kapton® polyimide film, C-plyimide, and glass polyimkie compositee are exposed to atomb oxygen. It is noticed that uncoated Kapton® film sample of thickness 25 μm (one side aluminized) tost 3 mg/Cm2 whereas the coated sample lost only 0.12 mg/Cm2 when exposed to atomk; oxygen fluence of 4.4 x 1020 atoms/Cm2. The mass loss of the coated sample gradually increases and reaches a value of 0.41 mg/Cm2 when exposed to atomic oxygen fluence of 2 x 1021 atoms/Cm2. Uncoated Kapton® film of thickness 125 μm (one side aluminized) lost 10.2 mg/Cm2 whereas the coated film tost only 0.49 mg/Cm2 on exposure to atomic oxygen fluence of 2 x 1021 atoms/Cm2. Similarly uncoated C-polyimkle composite tost 90.18 mg/cm2 on exposure to atomto oxygen fluence of 9.6 x 1020 atoms/Cm2 whereas the coated composito lost only 0.52 mg/Cm2 even after exposure to atomic oxygen fuence of 2.3 x 1021 atoms/Cm2. An uncoated glass polyimkle composite lost 11.68<br><br>
mg/Cm2 on exposure to atomic oxygen fluence of 9.6 x 1020 atoms/Cm2 while the coated subsetrarte loat only 0.4 mgfom2 even after exposure to atomic oxygen fluence of 2.3 x 1021 otomatem2. This dearly indicates that siloxane imide-epoxy baaed coating offers excellent protection to substrates which ars susceptible to atomic oxygen attack. Scanning electron microscopic studies of coated and uncoated sutbstrates furthsr confirmed that siloxane imide epoxy reain coating protects substrates susceptible to atomic oxygen attack.<br>

The reaction product is washed with water repeatedly to remove the catalyst and glycerol dichlorohydrin formed during the reaction. Excess of epichlorohy drin is removed by cfistillation under vacuum. The resultant resin is dried under vacuum for for 6 hours. The resin produced has an epoxy value of 1.7 eqv/kg. The resin is characterized by GPC. IR and 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra. The absorption peak due to oxtrane ring is observed at 910 cm-1 Absorption peaks at 1777 and 1717 cm"o we ckje to the presertce of imide groups. In the 13C-NMR spectrum of the resin, peaks corresponding to 13COOH is absent The sitoxane imkle epoxy resin prepared by this process contains epoxy functional groups which can be cured by treating with any known curatives such as aliphatic or aromatic diamines, diol, dithiol, diacid, or anhydride to obtain a cured resin.<br>
EXAMPLE 6;<br>

The mass loss of the coated sample increases gradually till a value of 0.41 mg/cm2 is reached when the sample is exposed to atomic oxygen fluence of 2 x 1021 atoms/cm2. Uncoated Kapton® polyimide film of thicknes8 125 μm lost 10.2 mg/cm2 whereas the coated film lost only 0.49 mg/Cm2 on exposure to atomic oxygen fluence of 9.6 x 1020 atoms/Cm2, whereas the coated sample k)st only 0.52 mg/Cm2 even after exposure to atomic oxygen fluence of 2.3 x 1021 atoms/Cm2. Similarly, uncoated glass polyimide composite lost 11.68 mg/Cm2 on exposure to atomic oxygen fluence of 9.6 x 1020 atoms/Cm2 while the coated sample lost only 0.4 mg/Cm2 after exposure to atomic fluence of 2.3 x 1021 atoms/Cm2.
