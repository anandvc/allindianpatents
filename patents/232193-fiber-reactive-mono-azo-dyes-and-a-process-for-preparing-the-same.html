When a fiber-reactive dyestuf! of tormula (I) is in its salt-form, the cation associated with the sulpho-groups is not critical and may be any of those non-chromophoric cations conventional in the field of fiber-reactive dyestuffs provided that the corresÂ¬ponding salt is substantially water-soluble. Examples of such cations are alkali metal cations, for example potassium, lithium or sodium ions and ammonium cations, e.g. mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-methyl or mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-ethyl ammonium cations. The cations may be the same or different, i.e. the compounds may be in mixed salt-form.<br><br><br><br>
wherein all substituenls have the meanings as defined above. Due to the process of forming such a mixture, each substituent has the same meaning in formula (lb), (Ic) (Id) and (le) and every group is fixed at the same position in formula (lb), (Ic), (Id) and (le).<br>
A preferred mixture comprises about<br>
5 - 45 weight-%   of a compound of formula (lb) and<br>
40 - 55 weight-% of a mixture of a compound of formula (Id) and (le)<br>
5 - 50 weight-%   of a compound of formula (Ic).<br><br>
The total of a mixture is 100%. The weight percents (wt-%) refer to the total amount of the 3 components.<br>
A fiber-reactive dyestuff of formula (I) or a mixture thereof or a mixture of compounds of formula (lb), (Ic), (Id) and (le) display good compatibility with other known dyestuffs. Accordingly, it may be mixed with other dyestuffs to form a composition, which can be used to dye or print suitable substrates. Said other dyestuffs must be compatible with a compound of formula (I) or its mixtures, that is, they must have similar dyeing or printing properties, for example fastness properties.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides in another of its aspects a dyeing or printing composition comprising a fiber-reactive dyestuff of the formula (I) or a mixture of compounds of formula (lb), (Ic), (Id) and (le).<br>
In another aspect of the invention there is provided a process of forming a fiber-reactive dyestuff of formula (I) or a salt thereof comprising the step of reacting a diazotized compound of the formula (II)<br><br><br>
wherein all substituents have the meanings as defined above.<br>
The process is preferably carried out In an aqueous medium at a temperature of from 0 to 40'C, more preferably 0 to 25'C and at a pH of between 1 to 7, more preferably 1 to 6.<br>
A fiber-reactive dyestuff of formula (I) may be isolated in accordance with known methods, for example by salting out, filtering and drying optionally in vacuum and at slightly elevated temperature-Depending on the reaction and/or isolation conditions, a fiber-reactive dyestuff of the formula {!) may be obtained in free-acid or salt-form or mixed salt-form, containing for example one or more of tfie above-mentioned cations. A fiber-reactive dyestuff of formula (I) may be converted from salt-form or mixed salt-form to free-acid form or vice versa using conventional techniques.<br>
The compounds of formula (III) are obtainable by a condensation reaction of<br><br>
wherein all substituents have the meanings as defined above.<br>
The compounds (II) are derivable by well-known syntheses from commonplace starting materials well known to persons skilled in the art.<br><br>
In another aspect of the invention there is provided a process of tormtng mixtures of compounds of formula (lb), (Ic). (Id) and (le) as described above, characterized in that a compound of formula (lb)<br><br>
wherein all substituents are defined above is reacted w/ith NaOH.<br>
The process is preferably carried out in an aqueous medium at a temperature of from 10 to 40Â°C and at a pH of between 6 to 11.<br>
By the variation of the mol-ratio of the NaOH in relation to the starting compound (formula (lb)) the ratio of these components in the mixture can be varied.<br>
A fiber-reactive dyestuff of the formula (I) or a mixture thereof or a mixture of compounds of formula (lb), (Ic), (Id) and (le) are useful as a fiber-reactive dyestuff for dyeing or printing hydroxy-group-containing or nitrogen-containing organic substrates. Preferred substrates are leather and fibrous materials, which comprise natural or synÂ¬thetic polyamides and, particularly, natural or regenerated cellulose such as, cotton, viscose and spun rayon. The most preferred substrates are textile materials comprising cotton.<br>
Accordingly, in another aspect of the invention there is provided the use of a fiber-reactive dyestuff according to the formula (I) or a salt thereof or a mixture thereof or a mixture of compounds of formula (lb), (Ic), (Id) and (le) as a fiber-reactive dyestuff for dyeing or printing hydroxy-group-containing or nitrogen-containing organic substrates.<br>
Dyeing or printing may be carried out in accordance with known methods conventional in the fiber-reactive dyestuff field.<br><br>
In a preferred dyeing process the exhaust-dyeing method is used at temperatures withÂ¬in the range of from 40 to lOCC. more preferably 50 to SCC. A fiber-reactive dyestuff of formula (1) or a mixture thereof or a mixture of compounds of formula (lb), (Ic), (Id) and (le) give good exhaust and fixation yields. Moreover, any unfixed dyestuff is easily washed from the substrate.<br>
In a preferred printing process, the padding method is used, for example pad-steam, pad-thermofix, pad-dry, pad-batch, pad-jig and pad-roll.<br>
Alternatively, printing may be carried out using ink-jet methods. The preparation of ink-jet inks comprises the use of a dyestuff or a mixture of dyestuffs according to the formula (I) or a salt thereof or a mixture thereof or a mixture of compounds of formula (lb), (Ic), (Id) and (le). A dyeing or print obtained with said fiber-reactive dyestuff exhibits good fastnesses.<br>
The dyes and the mixtures of the dyes are taken up by the fibers very quickly which leads to rapid process cycles in, for example, the continuous dyeing processes. The built up properties are good as well.<br>
Dyeings and prints obtained using mixtures of dyestuffs display good fastness properties which are comparable with those fastness properties obtained with a compound of formula (I) alone.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention. In the examples all parts and percentages are by weight unless indicated to the contrary, and all temperatures are given in degrees Centigrade.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
63.8 parts of 1-amino-8-hydroxynaphthalene-4,6-disulfonic acid are dissolved in 600 parts of water at 10Â°C to 15Â°C. The pH is adjusted with sodium hydroxide solution at 6 to 7. This solution is added in portion to a suspension that was prepared out of 200 parts of a water/ice mixture and 37 parts of 2,4,6-trichlorotria2ine in the presence of a surface-active agent. After the condensation is finished, 70 parts of 3-ethylamino-phenyl-(2'sulfatoethyl)sulfone are added and the pH is increased to 3.5 - 4 by addition<br>
^O<br><br>
of 15% sodium carbonate solution during 3 - 4 hours. The coupling component of the following formula (Hid)<br><br>
is salted out, filtered off and dried under vacuum at SO^C or dried by spray drying. The obtained compound dyes cellulose fibers in red shades. The resultant dyeings exhibited excellent light and wet fastness properties whereby the unfixed dyestuff can easily be washed out, even from deep dyeings. The dyestuff has an excellent behavior of migration in the salt phase.<br>
The following examples 2-18 are made according the methods described in example 1.<br><br><br>
The following examples 16-31 are made according to the method described in example 1, But the obtained compounds according to formula (lb) are reacted to compounds according to formula (Ic) by adding 2 mol of NaOH.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The obtained formulation dyes cellulose fibers in red shades. The resultant dyeings exhibited excellent light and wet fastness properties whereby the unfixed dyestuff can easily be washed out, even from deep dyeings. The dyestuff mixture has an excellent behavior of migration in the salt phase. The ration of these components can be varied by the mol-amount of NaOH that is added.<br>
The following examples 32 - 45 are made according to the method described in example 31. The obtained dyestuff mixture contains the same ratio of each component<br>
(lb), (Ic), (Id)and(le).<br><br><br><br><br>
0.3 Part of the dyestuff of Example 1 is dissolved in 150 parts of demineralized water and 12 parts NaCI. The dyebath is heated to 60Â°C, then 10 parts of cotton fabric (bleached) are added. After 30 minutes at 60Â°C, 3 part of sodium carbonate (calcined) are added to the bath. The addition is done in portion of 0.1, 0.3, 0.6 and 2 parts each 10 min. During the addition of sodium carbonate the temperature is kept at 60'C. SubÂ¬sequently, the dyebath is heated to OO^C, and dyeing is effected for a further one hour at ecc. The dyed fabric is then rinsed with running cold water for 3 minutes and afterÂ¬wards with running hot water for a further 3 minutes. The dyeing is washed at the boil for 15 minutes in 500 parts of demineralized water in the presence of 0.25 part of Marseille soaps. After being rinsed with running hot water (for 3 minutes) and centri-fuged, the dyeing is dried in a cabinet drier at about 70'C. A red cotton dyeing with excellent light and wet fastness properties is obtained .<br>
Similarly, the dyestuffs as well as the mixtures of Table 1, 2 and 3 are employed to dye cotton in accordance with the method described in Application Example A.<br><br><br>
APPLICATION EXAMPLE B<br>
