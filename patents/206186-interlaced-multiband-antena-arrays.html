The present invention relates to interlaced multiband antenna<br>
arrays.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
The present invention consists of antenna arrays which can be operated simultaneously in various frequency bands thanks to the physical disposition of the elements that constitute it, as well as the multiband behaviour of some elements situated strategically in che array.<br>
The array configuration is described on a basis of the juxtaposition or interleaving of various conventional single-band arrays operating in the different bands of interest. In those positions where elements of different multiband arrays come together, use is made of a multiband antenna which covers the different working frequency bands.<br>
The use of a multiband interleaved antenna array (hereinafter simply Multiband Interleaved Array, MIA) implies a great advantage over the classical solution of employing an array for each frequency band: there is a cost saving in the overall radiating system and in its installation (one array replaces several) , its size is reduced as well as its visual and environmental impact in the case of base and repeater stations for communication systems.<br><br>

The present invention finds its application in the field of telecommunications and more specifically in radio commununication systems.<br>
Background and Summary of the Invention<br>
Antennas started to be developed at the end of the nineteenth century based on the fundamental . laws of electromagnetism postulated by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864.  The invention of the first antenna has to be attributed to Heinrich Hertz in 1886 who demonstrated the transmission through air of electromagnetic waves. In the mid-1940's the fundamental restrictions regarding the  reduction  in  size  of  antennas  were  shown  with respect  to wavelength  and at  the beginning of  the sixties   appeared   the   first   frequency-independent antennas (E.C. Jordan, G.A. Deschamps, J.D.Dyson, P.E. Mayes,   "Developments   in   Broadband   Antennas,"IEEE Spectrum,  vol.1,  pp.  58-71,  Apr.  1964;  V.H.Rumsey, Frequency-Independent Antennas. New York Academic,.1966; R.L. Carrel,  "Analysis and design of the log-periodic dipole array," Tech. Rep. 52, Univ. of Illinois Antenna Lab.,  Contract AF33  (616)-6079, Oct 1961;  P.E. Mayes, "Frequency   Independent   Antennas   and   Broad-Band Derivatives Thereof",  Proc.  IEEE,  vol.80,  no.l,  Jan. 1992) . At that time proposals were made for helical, spiral,  log-periodic  arrays,  cones  and  structures defined   exclusively   by   angle   pieces   for   the implementation of broadband antennas.<br>
Antenna array theory goes back to the works of Shelkunoff (S.A. Schellkunhoff, "A Mathematical Theory of  Linear  Arrays,"  Bell  System  Technical  Journal,<br><br>
22,80), among other classic treatises on antenna theory. Said  theory establishes  the basic design rules  for shaping   the   radiation  properties  of   the  array (principally  its  radiation  pattern),   though  its application is restricted mainly to the case of mono-band arrays. The cause of said restriction lies in the frequency behaviour of the array being highly dependent on  the  ratio  between  the  distance  between  elements (antennas) of the array and the working wavelength. Said spacing  between  elements  is  usually  constant  and preferably less than one wavelength in order to prevent the appearance of diffraction lobes. This implies that once  the  spacing  between  elements  is  fixed,  the operating frequency (and the corresponding wavelength) is also fixed, it being particularly difficult that the same  array  work  simultaneously Â¦ at  another  higher frequency, given that in that case the magnitude of the wavelength is less than the spacing between elements.<br>
The log-periodic arrays suppose one of the first examples of antenna arrays capable of covering a broad range of frequencies (V.H.Rumsey, Frequency-Independent Antennas,  New  York  Academic,   1966;  R.L.   Carrel, "Analysis and design of the log-periodic dipole array," Tech. Rep.  52,  Univ.  Illinois Antenna Lab., Contract AF33  (616)-6079,  Oct  1961;  P.E.  Mayes,  "Frequency Independent   Antennas   and   Broad-Band   Derivatives Thereof",  Proc  IEEE,  vol.80,  no.1,  Jan.1992).  Said arrays  are based on distributing the  elements  that constitute it in such a. manner that the spacing between adjacent elements and their length vary according to a geometric  progression.  Although  said  antennas  are capable of maintaining a same radiation and impedance<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
pattern  over  a  broad  range  of  frequencies,  their application in practice is restricted to some concrete cases due to their limitations regarding gain and size. Thus for example,  said antennas are not employed in cellular telephony base stations because they do not have sufficient gain (their gain is around 10 dBi when the usual requirement  is for about  17 dBi for such application),  they  usually  have  linear  polarisation whilst in said environment antennas are required with polarisation diversity, their pattern in the horizontal plane  does  not  have  the width  necessary and  their mechanical structure is too bulky.<br>
The technology of individual multiband antennas is markedly more developed. A multiband antenna is understood to be an antenna formed by a set of elements coupled to each other electromagnetically which interact with each other in order to establish the radio-electric behaviour of the antenna, behaviour which with respect to radiation and impedance patterns is similar in multiple frequency bands (hence the name multiband antenna). Numerous examples of multiband antennas are described in the literature. In 1995 antennas of the fractal or multifractal type were introduced (the coining of the terms fractal and multifractal is attributable to B.B. Mandelbrot in his book The Fractal Geometry of Nature, W.H. Freeman and Co. 1983), antennas which by their geometry have a multifrequency behaviour and, in determined cases, a reduced size (C. Puente, R. Pous, J. Romeu, X. Garcia "Antenas Fractales o Mulitfractales", (Spanish patent P9501019). Subsequently multi-triangular antennas were introduced (Spanish patent P9800954) which could work simultaneously in the<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
GSM 900 and GSM 13 00 bands and, more recently, multilevel antennas (Patent PCT/ES99/00296) , which offer a clear example of how it is possible to shape the geometry of the antenna in order to achieve a multiband behaviour.<br>
The present invention describes how multiband antennas can be combined in . order to obtain an array that works simultaneously in several frequency bands.<br>
A Multiband Interleaved Array (MIA) consists of an array of antennas which has the particularity of being capable of working simultaneously in various frequency bands.  This is achieved by means of using multiband antennas  in  strategic  positions  of  the  array.  The disposition of the elements that constitute the MIA is obtained from the juxtaposition of conventional mono-band  arrays,  employing  as  many  mono-band  arrays  as frequency bands that it is wished to incorporate in the Multiband Interleaved Array. In those positions in which one .or various elements originating in the conventional mono-band arrays coincide,  a single multiband antenna (element) shall be employed which covers simultaneously the different bands.  In the remaining non-concurrent positions,  it can be chosen to employ also the same multiband antenna or else recur to a conventional mono-band antenna which works at the pertinent frequency. The excitation at one or various frequencies of each element of the array depends therefore on the position of the element in the array and is controlled by means of the signal distribution network.<br><br>

The present invention further provides interlaced multiband antenna array which works simultaneously on various frequencies the position of the elements in the array being obtained from the juxtaposition of as many mono-band arrays as there are working frequencies required, wherein a single multiband antenna, capable of covering the different working frequencies, is provided in those positions of the array in which the positions of two or more elements of the mono-band arrays coincide.<br><br>
- 6 -Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The characteristics expounded in the foregoing, are presented in graphical form making use of the figures in the drawings attached, in which is shown by way of a purely  illustrative  and  not  restrictive  example,  a preferred form of embodiment. In said drawings:<br>
Figure 1 shows the position of the elements of two classic mono-band arrays which work at frequencies f and f/2 respectively, and the disposition of elements in a multiband interleaved array, which has a dual frequency behaviour (at frequencies f and f/2), working in the same manner as classic arrays but with a smaller total number of elements.<br>
Figure 2 shows another particular example of multiband interleaved array but with three frequencies in this case, and-the respective three classic mono-band arrays which constitute it. It is a matter of extending the case of figure 1 to 3 frequencies f, f/2 and f/4.<br>
Figure 3 shows another particular example of multiband interleaved array, in which the different working frequencies are not separated by the same scale factor. It is a matter of extending the case of figures 1 and 2 to 3 frequencies f, f/2 and f/3.<br>
Figure 4 shows a further particular example of multiband interleaved array, in which the different working frequencies are not separated by the same scale factor. It is a matter of extending the case of figure 3 to 3 frequencies f, f/3 and f/4.<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
Figure 5 shows a multiband interleaved array configuration which requires a repositioning of the elements to obtain frequencies that do not correspond to an integer factor of the highest frequency. In this particular example the frequencies f, f/2 and f/2,33 have been chosen.<br>
Figure 6 shows the extension of. the design of an-MIA to the two-dimensional or three-dimensional case, specifically, an extension of the example of figure 1 to two dimensions.<br>
Figure 7 shows one of the preferred of operating modes (AEM1) . It is a matter of an MIA in which the multiband elements are multi-triangular elements. The array works simultaneously at dual frequencies, for example in the GSM 900 and GSM 1800 bands.<br>
Figure 8 shows another of the preferred operating modes (AEM2) . It is a matter of an MIA in which the multiband elements are multilevel elements. The array works simultaneously at dual frequencies, for example in the GSM 900 and GSM 1800 bands.<br>
Figure 9 shows another of the preferred operating modes (AEM3) . It is a matter of an MIA in which the multiband elements are multilevel elements. The configuration is similar to that of Figure 8 (AEM2 mode) , the difference being that the new disposition permits the total width of the antenna to be reduced.<br>
Figure 10 shows another example of multiband antenna which can be employed in MIAs. It is a matter of<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
a stacked patch antenna, which in this specific example works at two dual frequencies (for example, GSM 900 and GSM 18 00) .<br>
Figure 11 shows the disposition of said patches in the MIA type array (AEM4 configuration). Observe that, in contrast to the previous cases, in this case multiband antennas are employed only in those positions where it is strictly necessary; in the remainder mono-band elements are employed the radiation pattern of which is sufficiently like that of the multiband element in the pertinent band.<br>
Figure 12 shows another configuration (AEM5), in which the elements have been rotated through 45Â° in order to facilitate the procurement of double polarisation at +45Â° or -45Â°.<br>
Description of the Preferred Embodiment of the Invention<br>
In making the detailed description that follows of the  preferred  embodiment  of  the  present  invention, reference shall constantly be made to the Figures of the drawings, throughout which use has been made of the same numerical references for the same or similar parts.<br>
A multiband interleaved array (MIA) is constituted by the juxtaposition of various conventional mono-band arrays. The conventional antenna arrays usually have a mono-band behaviour (that is, they work within a relatively small frequency range, typically of the order of 10% about a centre frequency) and this is not only because the elements (antennas) that constitute it have<br><br>
wavelength. Typically, the conventional mono-band arrays are designed with a spacing between elements of around a half-wavelength, spacing which may be increased in some configurations in order to enhance directivity, though it is usually kept below one wavelength to avoid the appearance of diffraction lobes.<br>
This purely geometric restriction (the magnitude of the wavelength conditions the geometry of the elements of the array and their relative spacing)  signifies a major drawback in those environments and communication systems in which various frequency bands have to be employed simultaneously.  A clear example  is  the GSM cellular mobile telephony system. Initially located in the 900 MHz band, the GSM system has turned into one of the most widespread on a world scale. The success of the system and the spectacular growth in demand for this type of service has led to the cellular mobile telephony operators expanding- its service into a new band,  the 18 00 MHz band,  in order to provide coverage  for a greater customer base. Making use of classic mono-band antenna  technology,  the  operators have  to duplicate their  antenna  network  in order  to  provide  coverage simultaneously to GSM 900 and GSM 1800. Using a single MIA.  specially  designed  for  the  system  (like  that described in the particular cases of figures 7 through 12) , the operators reduce the cost of their network of base stations, the time to expand into the new band and the   visual   and   environmental   impact   of   their installations (through the simplification of the overall radiating structure).<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
It is important to point out that the scenario which has just been outlined above deals only with one particular example of a type of MIA and its application; as may well be gauged by anyone familiar with the subject, in no way are the MIAs which are described in the present invention restricted to said specific configuration and can easily be adapted to other frequencies and applications.<br>
The multiband interleaved arrays base their operation on the physical disposition of the antennas which constitute them and on the particular type of element that is employed in some strategic positions of the array.<br>
The  positions  of  the  elements  in  an  MIA  are determined from the positions of the elements in as many mono-band arrays as there are frequencies or frequency bands required. The design of the array is,  in that sense, equal to that of the mono-band arrays insomuch as it is possible to choose the current weighting for each element,  in  order  to  shape  the  radiation  pattern according  to  the  needs  of  each  application.  The configuration  of  the  MIA  is  obtained  from  the juxtaposition of the positions of the different mono-band  arrays.  Naturally,   such  juxtaposition  proves difficult to implement in practice in those positions in which various antennas of the different arrays coincide; the solution proposed in this invention rests in the use   of a multiband antenna  (for example of the fractal, multi-triangular, multi- level, etc. type) which covers all the frequencies associated with its position.<br><br>
- ]] -<br>
A. basic and particular example of how to arrange<br>
the elements in an MIA is described	<br>
columns of the figures (1.1)and(l.2)twoconventional  <br>
mono-band arrays are which the the positions of the <br>
elements    circles  and  the circumference respectively, are chosen in such a manner that the spacing between elements is typically less than the working wavelength. Thus, taking as reference the working frequency f of the array (1.1), the array (1.2) would work at a frequency f/2 as the elements have a spacing double that of the previous case.  In figure (1.3) the disposition is shown of the elements in the MIA which is capable of working simultaneously on the frequencies Â£ and f/2 conserving basically the same facilities as the two arrays (1.1) and (1.2) .  In the positions in which elements of the two conventional arrays o(indicated in figure  (1.3) by means of black circles  located  at  the  centre  of  a  circumference) coincide,  a multiband antenna is employed capable of working in the same manner (same impedance and pattern) on the frequencies (1.1) and (1.2). The remaining not common elements (indicated either by a black  circle, or by a circumference) can be implemented either by means of the same multiband element employed in the common positions (and selecting the working frequency by means of the signal distribution network of the array), or by employing  conventional  mono-band  elements.  In  this example the array (1.3) has a dual behaviour frequency-wise (at frequencies f and f/2) , working in the same manner as the arrays (1.1) and (1.2) but with a smaller total number of. elements (12 instead of 16) -<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
Multiple examples of multiband antennas are already-described in the state of the art. Antennas with fractal geometry, multi-triangular antennas, multi-level antennas even stacked patch antennas are some examples of antennas capable of working in like manner in multiple frequency bands. These, and other multiband elements can be employed in the positions of the MIAs in which elements of various mono-band arrays come together.<br>
In the following figures other MIA configurations are shown, based on the same inventive concept, though having the disposition of the elements adapted to other frequencies. In Figure 2 the configuration described is that of a tri-band MIA working at frequencies f, f/2 and f/4. The disposition of elements in the three classic mono-band arrays at the frequencies f, f/2 and f/4 is illustrated in 'the figures  (2.1),  (2.2)  and  (2.3)  by means  of  black  circles,  circumferences  and  squares respectively. The position of the elements of the MIA is determined from the configuration of the three mono-band arrays designed for each one of the three frequencies. The three arrays come together in the MIA that is shown in figure (2.4). In those positions where elements of the three arrays would come together (indicated in the drawing by the juxtaposition of the different geometric figures  identifying  each  array)  use  is  made  of  a multiband element. The three-frequency array of figure (2.4) behaves in the same manner as the three arrays (2.1),  (2.2)  and  (2.3)  at  their respective working frequencies, but employing only 13 elements instead of the  21 required in the total of the three mono-band arrays.<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
Figures 3, 4 and 5 describe, by way of example and not restrictively, the design of other MIAs based on the same principle though at other frequencies. In the first two cases the frequencies employed are integer multiples of a fundamental frequency; in the case of figure 5 the ratio between  frequencies  is  not  restricted to any particular rule, though it supposes an example of array in which the frequencies the GSM 900, GSM 1800 and UMTS services can be combined.<br>
Specifically,   Figure   3   illustrates   another<br>
particular example of multiband interleaved array,  in<br>
which  the  different  working  frequencies  are  not<br>
separated by the same scale factor.  It concerns the<br>
extension  of  the  case  of  Figures  1  and  2  to  3<br>
frequencies f, f/2 and f/3. The disposition of elements<br>
of the- three classic mono-band arrays at the frequencies<br>
f,  f/2 and f/3 is shown in figures (3.1),  (3.2)  and<br>
(3.3)  by means of black circles,  circumferences and<br>
squares respectively. The column of figure (3.4) shows <br>
the disposition of elements in the tri-band interleaved<br>
array. In those positions in which elements of the three<br>
arrays come together (indicated in the drawing by the<br>
juxtaposition  of  the  different  geometric  figures<br>
identifying each array) ,  use is made of a multiband<br>
element;  the  same  strategy  is  followed  in  those<br>
positions in which elements of two arrays coincide: use<br>
should  be  made  of  a  multiband  element  capable  of<br>
covering the  frequencies pertinent  to  its position,<br>
preferentially the same element as that used in the<br>
 remaining positions, selecting those frequencies which<br>
are necessary by means of the feeder network. Notice<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
that  as  the  three-frequency  array  of  figure  (3.4) behaves in the same manner as the three arrays (3.1) , (3.2) and (3.3) at their respective working frequencies, but  employing  only  12  elements  instead  of  the  21 required in the total of the three mono-band arrays.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a new particular example of multiband  interleaved array,  in . which  the  different working frequencies are not separated by the same scale factor. It concerns the extension of the case of Figure 3 to 3 frequencies f, f/3 and f/4. The disposition of elements of the three classic mono-band arrays at the frequencies f, f/3 and f/4 are shown in figures (4.1) , (4.2)   and   (4.3)   by   means   of   black   circles, circumferences and squares respectively. The column of figure (4.4) shows the disposition of elements in the tri-band interleaved array.  In those positions where elements  of  the  three  arrays  would  come  together (indicated in the drawing by the juxtaposition of the different geometric figures identifying each array), use is made of a multiband element.  The three-frequency array of figure (4.4) behaves in the same manner as the three arrays (4.1),  (4.2) and (4.3) at their respective working  frequencies,  but  employing only  15  elements instead of the 24 required in the total of the three mono-band arrays.<br>
It is convenient to re-emphasise that in the particular cases of Figures 3 and 4 the arrays can work at 3 frequencies simultaneously. The disposition of elements is such that the three frequencies do not "always^ coincide in  all the elements; nonetheless, by employing a tri-band antenna in those positions and<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
selecting the working frequencies for example by mean, of a conventional frequency-selective network, it is possible to implement the MIA.<br>
In  some  configurations  of multiband  interleavec array,  especially  in  those  in  which  the  different frequencies do not correspond to an integral factor of the  highest  frequency  1,  it  is  required  that  the elements  be  repositioned,  as  in  Figure  5.  in  this particular example the frequencies f,  f/2 and f/2,33 have been chosen.  The disposition of elements of the three classic mono-band arrays at the frequencies f, f/2 and f/2,3 3 is represented in figures (5.1),  (5.2) and (5.3)  by means of black circles,  circumferences and squares respectively. The column of figure  (5.4)  shows what would be the disposition of elements in the tri-band interleaved array according to the same plan as in the previous examples. Notice how' in this case the ratio of frequencies involves the collocation of elements at intermediate  positions   which  make   its   practical implementation difficult. The solution to be adopted in this case consists in displacing the position of the element of the array that works at the lowest frequency (indicated by arrows) until it coincides with another element (that nearest) of the highest frequency array; then the two or more coincident elements in the new position are  replaced with a multiband element.  An example of the final configuration once the elements have been repositioned, is shown in figure (5.5). It is important that the element displaced be preferentially that of the lowest frequency array,  in this way the  relative displacement In terms of the working wavelength<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
is the least possible and the appearance of secondary or diffraction lobes is reduced to the minimum.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates how the configuration MIAs is not limited to the linear (one-dimensional) case, but it also includes arrays in 2 and 3 dimensions (2D and 3D) . The procedure for distributing the elements of the array in the 2D and 3D cases is the same, replacing also the different coincident elements with a single multiband antenna.<br>
More examples of particular configurations of MIAs are described below. In the five examples described, various designs are presented for GSM 900 and GSM 1800 systems (890 MHz-960 MHz and 1710 MHz-1880 MHz bands). It is a question of antennas for cellular telephony base stations, which present basically the same radiofrequency behaviour in both bands; by employing such versions of MIA antenna the operators reduce the number of antennas installed to one half, minimising the cost and environmental impact of their base stations.<br>
AEM1 MODE<br>
The AEM1 configuration, represented in Figure 7, is based on the use of GSM 900 and GSM 1800 multi-triangular elements. The array is obtained by interleaving two conventional mono-band arrays with spacing between elements less than one wavelength ( ) in the pertinent band (typically a spacing is chosen less than 0.9 in order to minimise the appearance of the diffraction lobe in the end-fire direction). The origanal arrays can have 8 or 10 elements, depending on the gain required by the operator. The juxtaposition of<br><br>

both arrays in a single MIA is achieved in this case by employing dual multi-triangular elements. Such elements incorporate two excitation points (one for each band), which allows the working band to be selected according to their position in the array, in figure 7 the position of the elements is shown,  as well as their working frequencies.  The  elements  shown  in  white  indicate operation in the GSM 900. band; the elements shown in black indicate operation in the GSM 1800 band and the elements marked in black in the lower triangle and in white in their two upper triangles indicate simultaneous operation  in both bands.  Precisely the  simultaneous operation in both bands via a single multiband element (the multi-triangular element) in such positions of the array (those positions at which those of the original mono-band  arrays  coincide) ,  is  one  of  the  main characteristic features of the MIA invention.<br>
The manner of feeding the elements of the AEM1 array is not characteristic of the invention of the MlAs and recourse may be had to any conventionally known system. In particular and given that the multi-triangular elements are excited at two different points, it is possible to make use of an independent distribution network for each band. Another alternative consists in employing a broadband or dual band distribution network, by coupling a combiner/diplexer which interconnects the network and the two excitation points of the multi-triangular antenna.<br>
  Finally, the antenna may therefore come with two  input/output connectors (one for each band), or combined<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
in a single connector by means of a combiner/diplexer network.<br>
AEM2 MODE<br>
This  particular  configuration of AEM2,  shown  in Figure 8, is based on a multilevel antenna which acts as a   multiband   element.   In   addition   to   working simultaneously .in the GSM 900 and GSM 1800 bands, Â¦ the antenna has also double linear polarisation at +4 5Â° and -45Â° with respect to the longitudinal axis of the array. The  fact  that  the  antenna  has  double  polarisation signifies  an  additional  advantage  for  the  cellular telephony  operator,   since  in  this  manner  he  can implement a diversity system which minimises the effect of  fading  by  multipath  propagation.  The  multilevel element which is described in Figure 8 is more suitable than the multi-triangular element described previously since the element itself has a linear polarisation at +45Â° in GSM 900 and at -45Â° in GSM 1800.<br>
The array o is obtained by interleaving two conventional mono-band arrays with spacing between elements less than one wavelength ( ) in the pertinent band (typically a spacing less than 0.9 is chosen in order to minimise the appearance of the diffraction lobe in the end-fire direction). The original arrays can have 8 or 10 elements depending on the gain required by the operator. The juxtaposition of both arrays in a single MIA is achieved in this case by employing in-band dual multilevel elements. Such elements incorporate two points of excitation (one for each band), which permits the working band to be selected according to their position in the array. In Figure 8 the position of the<br><br>
- 19 -<br>
elements is shown, as well as their working frequencies. . The elements shown in white indicate operation in the GSM 90 0 band;  the elements shown in black indicate operation in the GSM 1800 band and the elements marked in black in their lower triangle and in white in the upper triangles indicate simultaneous operation in both bands.  Precisely the  simultaneous operation  in both bands via a single multiband element  (the multilevel element) in such positions of the array (those positions in  which  those  of  the  original  mono-band  arrays coincide), is one of the main characteristic features of the MIA invention.<br>
It is possible to achieve double polarisation on a<br>
basis of  exciting  the multilevel  element at various<br>
points on its surface; nonetheless in order to augment<br>
the   isolation   between   connectors   of   different<br>
polarisation, it is chosen in the example described to<br>
implement  a  double  column  to  separate  the  +45Â°<br>
polarization  (left-hand  column)  from  that . of  -45Â°<br>
(right-hand column). To increase the isolation between<br>
bands,   it  is  even  possible  to  interchange  the<br>
polarisation inclination in the columns of the array in<br>
one of the bands (for example in DCS).<br>
The manner of feeding the elements of the array AEM2 is not characteristic of the invention of the MIAs and recourse can be had to any conventionally known system. In particular and given that the multi-triangular elements are excited at two different points, it is possible to make use of an independent distribution, network for each band and polarisation. Another alternative consists in employing a broadband or<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
dual "band distribution network, by coupling a combiner/diplexer which interconnects the network and the two excitation points of the multilevel antenna. The antenna may then come with four input/output connectors (one for each band and polarisation) , or else combined in only two connectors {one for each independent polarisation) by means of combiner/diplexer network in each polarisation.<br>
AEM3 MODE<br>
The AEM3 configuration, as shown in Figure 9, is very similar to the AEM2 (the position of the multilevel elements and the type of element itself is the same as in the previous case) , with the difference that the right-hand column is reversed with respect to that on the left. In this manner an antenna with dual band and polarisation is obtained, the total width of the antenna being reduced with respect to the previous case (in this particular example the width is reduced by about 10%) . In order to increase the isolation between the columns of double polarisation it is convenient that oblique fins be inserted between contiguous elements. In that case, lateral fins are also incorporated in all the elements which work in GSM 1800, fins which contribute to narrowing the radiation beam in the horizontal plane (plane at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the array).<br>
Nor is the signal distribution system especially characteristic of the MIA configuration and the same system  can be used, as in the previous case.<br><br>
- 21 - AEM4 MODE<br>
Another example of multiband interleaved array is that termed herein AEM4 and which is shown in schematic form in Figure 11. In this case, the multiband element is a stacked square patch antenna (Figure 10), though it is obvious for anyone familiar with the subject that patches of other shapes could be employed. Square- or circular-shaped types are preferred in the event that is wished to work with double polarisation. In the example of Figure 10 the particular case is described of square patches.<br>
The lower patch is of appropriate size for its resonant frequency (associated typically with the patch fundamental mode) to coincide with the lower band (GSM 900 in this specific case); moreover, this patch acts in turn as ground plane of the upper patch. The latter is of a size such that its resonance is centred in the upper band (GSM 1800) . The elements of the array are mounted on a metallic or metal-coated surface which acts as ground plane for all the elements of the array. The feeder system is preferentially of the coaxial type, a cable being employed for the lower patch and band and another for the upper patch and band. The excitation points are collocated on the bisectors of the patches (for example, the approximate excitation points are marked by means of circles on the plan view of the antenna) if vertical or horizontal polarisation is desired, or on the diagonals if, on the other hand, linear polarisation inclined at 45Â° is desired. In the "event it is desired that the array work with double polarisationon, each   of the patches   is   excited<br><br>
- 22 -<br>
additionally  on  the  bisector  or  diagonal  opposite (orthogonal) to the first.<br>
The feeding of the elements of the array AEM4 is not characteristic of the invention of the MlAs and recourse can be had to any conventionally known system. In particular and given that the stacked patch antenna is excited at two different points, it is possible to make use of an independent distribution network for each band and polarisation. Another alternative consists in employing a broadband or dual band distribution network, by coupling a combiner/diplexer which interconnects the network and the two excitation points of the multilevel antenna.<br>
The antenna may then come with four input/output connectors {one for each band and polarisation), or else combined in only two connectors (one for each independent polarisation) by means of a combiner/diplexer network in each polarisation.<br>
AEM5 MODE<br>
The AEM5 configuration,  as shown in Figure	12,<br>
adopts the same approach as the AEM4, though all	the<br>
elements are rotated through 45Â° in the plane of	the<br>
antenna.  In  this  manner  the  radiation  pattern	is<br>
modified  in  the  horizontal  plane,  in  addition	to<br>
rotating the polarization through 45*.<br>
It is of interest to point out that both in the AEM4 configuration and in the AEM5, the multiband element constituted by the stacked patches is really only strictly necessary in those strategic positions in<br><br>
- 23 -<br>
which elements originating in the conventional mono-band arrays coincide. In the remaining positions, it shall 1 possible to employ indistinctly multiband or mono-bar elements that work at the frequency determined for it location, as long as its radiation pattern i sufficiently like that of the stacked patch antenna i order to avoid the appearance of diffraction lobes.<br>
