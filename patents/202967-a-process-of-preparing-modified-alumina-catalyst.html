FILED OF THE INVENTION:    This invention relates to a process for the preparation of an<br>
active alumina catalyst Impregnated with a metal hydroxide chosen<br>
from alkali or alkaline earth metal. The solid catalyst thus obtained is<br>
then used to protect, in a wide variety of chemical transformations and<br>
for the nudeophilic substitution of aromatic halides containing an<br>
electron withdrawing group.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Protection of compounds containing an active hydrogen like, amine, phenols and thiols forms an integral part of synthesis. Conventional protecting groups are t-BOC (di-tert-butyl dicarbonate) which reacts with amines to form a carbamate. Introduction of this BOC protection group is normally carried out by reacting the amine with BOC anhydride in the presence of a base. The other protecting groups normally used are 9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl chloride (FMOC-Chloride) for introducing the fluoromenthyl group, Alloc-Chloride for introducing the allyl carbamate group and Benzylchloroformate (CBZ-chloride) for introducing the benzyloxy carbamate group in the case of amines.<br>
Traditionally different reaction conditions are employed to introduce specific protective groups, namely a basic reaction medium for introducing the BOC and Alloc groups and an acidic medium for introducing the FMOC groups.<br>
The present invention describes a simple and efficient method for introducing different protecting groups essentially by a single<br><br>
reaction condition, namely, alumina impregnatea with a basic hydroxide under mild conditions.<br>
Aromatic nudeophilic substitution is carried out by the displacement of a halo group using strong nucleophilies. The reaction conditions are harsh and the ylelds are often very poor. Improved methods were developed for the displacement using a metal based catalyst like copper and a strong base like potassium tert-butoxide. The reaction is specific and the ylelds are poor. Mixture of palladium based reagents like, palladium acetate, palladium hydroxide or palladium dibenzylidiene acetone complex and a phosphine ligand in the presence of base like sodium tert-butoxide offers a versatile procedure for the nuceiophilic displacement of the aromatic halo group. The reaction utilizes phosphines, which are not readily available and palladium reagents which are expensive and possess disposal problems and thus not suitable for industrial scale operations.<br>
The process for this invention could be used for the nudeophilic substitution of aromatic halides containing electron withdrawing groups to give substituted aromatics, which finds extensive use in the preparation of fine chemicals, which are starting materials for active pharmaceutical intermediates.<br>
A variety of methods are available in the literature for the nudeophilic substitution of aromatic halides which are herein incorporated as reference. Palladium is the chosen metal of choice for effecting the coupling of aromatic halides with a variety of nudeophiles. Often the reaction conditions involves the use of trialkyl or triaryl phosphine and a palladium catalyst. Stephen Buchwald et.al., (J. Org. Chem., 2000, 65,  1158-1174 and references cited<br><br><br>
therein) describes an efficient method for the amination of aryl chlorides, bromides and triflates using aryl phosphines, palladium complex and a base.<br>
Scott Sawyer et. al., (J. Org Chem, 1998, 63, 6338-6343) have demonstrated the synthesis of diaryl ethers, diaryl thioethers and diaryl amines by nudeophilic substitution of the aryl halides using KF-alumina, 18-crown-6 conditions. The disadvantage of this method is the usage of 18-crown-6 as a complexing agent for the reaction. The reaction also requires a more tedious work up by partitioning the reaction mixture with an organic solvent and aqueous media.<br>
Conventional methods employ the nudeophilic conditions using K2CO3-DMF conditions, which employs high reaction temperatures, which may not be readily employed In industrial scale operations. OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the main objective of this invention is to provide a solid catalyst, which can easily be removed from the reaction mixture and thus facilitates easy work-up procedures for the incorporation of protecting groups for amines, alcohols and thiols and for the nudeophilic substitution.<br>
Another important feature is the easy handling and disposal procedure of the spent catalyst.<br>
The reaction avoids the use of toxic and expensive solvents and thus Is environmentally friendly<br>
The reaction conditions are simple and hence can be easily employed for industrial scale preparations.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main finding of this invention Is that, the said catalyst shows remarkable activity in the reactions for introducing protecting groups for amines, alcohols, phenols and thiols. A wide variety of protecting groups can be introduced in a mild and efficient manner at ambient temperatures.<br>
Other important finding of this invention is that the reaction conditions are so mild and simple that it can be easily scaled up for industrial scale preparations.<br>
The main advantages of the process of this invention over the prior art processes for such reactions are as follows:<br>
1.	The active catalyst can be very easily prepared in large quanities<br>
and can be stored without any appreciable loss of activity.<br>
2.	The catalyst can be used for introducing protective groups of a wide range as indicated on practically any amines, alcohols, phenols or thiols.<br>
3.	The catalyst used being heterogenous can be separated from the reaction products by simple filtration.<br>
4.	The reaction can be carried out in any solvent, polar or non-polar as demonstrated using dioxane, dicholoromethane etc.<br>
5.	The catalyst in non-corrosive and hence can be easily handled in very large volumes.<br>
6.	The catalyst in non-toxic and hence offers very easy disposal methods and also affords environmental friendly reaction conditions.<br><br>

PREPARATION OF CATALYST<br>
1.	Example For preparation of alumina impregnated with<br>
LiOH (Solvent - DCM, base - LiOH)<br>
To a solution of LiOH (9.6 g, 0.4 mol) in water (100 ml) basic alumina (100 g) was added and stirred for 30 minutes. Dichloromethane (250 ml) was added to the above mixture and evaporated. The residue was treated again with dichloromethane (250 ml) and evaporated. The resulting solid residue was dried at 100-120°C for 2 hours to yleld alumina impregnated with lithium hydroxide.<br>
2.	Example For preparation of catalyst (Solvent - acetonitrile,<br>
base - NaOH)<br>
To a solution of NaOH (30 g, 0.75 mol) in water (100 ml) basic alumina (100 g) was added and stirred for 45 minutes. Acetonitrile (500 ml) was added to the above mixture and evaporated. The residue was treated again with acetonitrile (500 ml) and evaporated. The resulting solid residue was dried at 100-120 °C for 5 hours to yleld alumina impregnated with sodium hydroxide.<br>
3.	Example For preparation of catalyst (Solvent - toluene,<br>
base - KOH)<br>
To a solution of KOH (30 g, 0.53 mol) in water (150 ml) basic alumina (120 g) was added and stirred for 1 hour. Toluene (500 ml) was added to the above mixture and evaporated. The residue was treated again with toluene (500 ml) and evaporated. The resulting solid residue was dried at 100-120°C for 4 hours to yleld alumina impregnated with potassium hydroxide.<br>
USE OF CATALYST<br>
1.   Example for use of alumina impregnated with NaOH<br>
To a solution of aniline (5 g, 0.053 mol)) in dichloromethane (50 ml), alumina impregnated with sodium hydroxide (5 g, prepared as per<br><br>
example 2) was added and the contents were stirred for 5 minutes. Benzyl chloroformate (9 g, 0.053 mol) was added slowly over a period of 10 minutes at room temperature. After 3 hours, the catalyst was filtered off and the solid bed was washed thoroughly with dichloromethane. The clear filtrate was concentrated and product was crystallized by addition of petroleum ether.<br>
2.   Example for use of alumina Impregnated with KOH<br>
To a solution of aniline (5 g, 0.053 mol)) in dichloromethane (50 ml), alumina impregnated with sodium hydroxide (5 g, prepared as per example 3) was added and the contents were stirred for 5 minutes. A solution of Boc-anhydride (12 g, 0.054 mol) in dichloromethane (10 ml) was added slowly over a period of 10 minutes at room temperature. After 5 hours, the catalyst was filtered off and the solid bed was washed thoroughly with dichloromethane. The clear filtrate was concentrated and product was crystallized by addition of petroleum ether.<br><br><br>
