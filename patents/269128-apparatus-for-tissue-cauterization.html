APPARATUS FOR TISSUE CAUTERIZATION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates generally to tissue cauterization. More particularly, the invention relates to an improved electrode for tissue cauterization.<br>
2.	Description of the Background Art<br>
Tissue and organ removal are required in a number of surgical procedures for a number of purposes. A major concern in all tissue removal procedures is hemostasis, i.e. cessation of bleeding. All blood vessels supplying an organ or a tissue segment to be removed have to be sealed, either by suturing or cauterization, to inhibit bleeding when the tissue is removed. For example, when the uterus is removed in a hysterectomy, bleeding must be inhibited in the cervical neck which is resected, as well as along the vessels which supply blood to the uterus along its sides. Similarly, blood vessels within the liver must be individually sealed when a portion of the liver is resected in connection with removal of a tumor or for other purposes. The liver is a highly vascularized organ and sealing of the blood vessels is quite time consuming. Achieving hemostasis is necessary in both open surgical procedures and in minimally invasive surgical procedures. In the latter case, however, because of the limited access through cannula and other small passages, sealing of blood vessels can be even more time consuming and problematic.<br>
Achieving hemostasis is particularly important in laparoscopic and other limited access procedures where the organ or other tissue must be morcellated prior to removal. Most organs are too large to be removed intact through a cannula or other limited access passage, thus requiring that the tissue be morcellated, e.g. cut, ground, or otherwise broken into smaller pieces, prior to removal. It will be appreciated that morcellation of vascularized tissue can be very problematic.<br>
For these reasons, it would be desirable to provide improved methods, systems, and apparatus, for achieving hemostasis in connection with organ and tissue removal procedures. In particular, it would be desirable to provide<br><br>
WO 2006/124595	PCT/US2006/018440<br>
methods and systems which permit a surgeon to achieve hemostasis in a time-efficient manner, using readily available surgical equipment e.g. radio frequency power supplies as discussed below, while reducing risk and trauma to the patient. It would be further desirable if the methods and systems are applicable to a wide variety of tissue removal procedures, including at least hysterectomies, liver tissue resection, cholecystectomies, prostate removal, lung resection, and the like. It would be still further desirable if the methods could provide for complete or substantially complete coagulation and hemostasis of an entire volume of tissue to be removed to facilitate such procedures as a subsequent morcellation. The ability to, for example, morcelate tissue while minimizing bleeding will be of substantial benefit to the performance of laparoscopic and other minimally invasive procedures, as well as other surgical procedures.<br>
The use of radio frequency (RF) energy to necrose body organs or portions thereof is known. U.S. Patent No. 4,979,948 describes a balloon electrode which is inflated in the interior of a uterus and used to apply RF energy to necrose the endothelial lining of the uterus. U.S. Patent No. 3,845,771 describes a glove having flexible electrodes on the thumb and middle finger. The glove is intended for conducting RF current to conventional forceps, scalpels, etc. U.S. Patent No. 4,972,846 describes electrode patch pairs useful as defibrillator leads which are engaged directly on the epicardium. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,178,618 and 5,078,736 describe stents which can be energized to apply RF energy on the interior of a body lumen. Lorentzen et al. (1996) Mm. Ivas. Then Allied Technol. 5:511-516 describes a loop electrode that can be rotated within tissue to excuse a tissue volume.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,203,541 discloses an automatic circuit that controls a surgical instrument, having a pair of bipolar electrodes. The circuit comprises a means for measuring the current between the pair of electrodes, an impedance detection circuit that is in electrical communication with the current measuring means, a comparator that has an electrical communication with the impedance detection circuit, and a controller that is electrically connected to the comparator. The impedance detection circuit calculates the impedance<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/124595	PCT/US2006/018440<br>
between the electrodes based on the measured currents and generates a first signal indicative of the calculated impedance. The comparator processes the first signal and generates an activation signal if the calculated impedance falls within a predetermined range of impedance values and generates a deactivation signal if the calculation impedance exceeds a deactivation threshold. The controller receives the activation and deactivation signals and transmits the first control signal to a radio frequency energy output stage to activate the electrodes in response to the activation signal and transmits the second control signal to the radio frequency output stage to deactivate the electrodes in response to the deactivation signal.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,398,779 teaches a method for electrosurgically sealing a tissue that concludes the steps of applying an initial pulse of RF energy to the tissue, the pulse having characteristics selected so as not to heat the tissue appreciably; measuring the value of the impedance of the tissue and response to the applied pulse; and in accordance with the measured impedance value, determining an initial set of pulse parameters for use during a first RF energy pulse as applied to the tissue. The invention teaches varying the pulse parameters of individual ones of subsequent RF energy pulses in accordance with at least one characteristic of an electrical transient that occurs during subsequent RF energy pulses. The method terminates the generation of subsequent RF energy pulses upon a determination that the electrical transient is absent or that a minimum output voltage has been reached.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,443,463 teaches a coagulating forceps for selectively coagulating blood vessels or tissue containing blood vessels. The method taught involves the placement of the blood vessels or tissue containing blood vessels between the prongs of the forceps, with the jaws of the forceps containing a plurality of electrodes which are energized by radio frequency power. A plurality of sensors are associated with the electrodes, and in contact with the vessels or tissue, to measure the temperature rise of the tissue or blood vessels and to provide a feedback to the radio frequency power to control the heating to perform coagulation of vessels or tissue. The<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/124595	PCT/US2006/018440<br>
invention also teaches that the upper prong of the device may be split into two parts with the cutting blade between the two upper parts to provide for cutting of the coagulated vessels subsequent to the coagulation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides methods, systems, and apparatus which facilitate tissue cauterization in connection with such procedures as tissue resection and removal from patients undergoing a wide variety of procedures. The procedures may involve removal of an entire organ, e.g. hysterectomies, cholecystectomies, prostate removal, lung resection, and the like. Alternatively, the methods may involve removal of a portion of an organ or other tissue, such as tumor removal, often from highly vascularized organs, such as the liver, lung, or the like. The methods generally involve two steps, where the tissue is first necrosed or cauterized in whole or in part using radio frequency energy. In particular, the cauterization is effected at least along a desired resection plane within the tissue. The tissue is then resected along said plane(s). Advantageously, it has been found that resection within the necrosed or cauterized tissue substantially minimizes, and in some cases eliminates, the bleeding caused by the tissue resection. Preferably, the tissue cauterization is effected over a target volume of tissue, typically an entire organ or a portion thereof, e.g. the uterus, the lobe of a liver, a lung section, the prostate, or the like. By effecting substantially complete cauterization of a target tissue volume, the bleeding capacity of that tissue is reduced or eliminated, thus facilitating subsequent morcellization and tissue removal. Thus, organ and tissue removal is greatly facilitated with a substantial reduction in bleeding and the time needed for the surgical procedure.<br>
In a first specific aspect, methods according to the invention comprise engaging at least a first electrode structure and a second electrode structure against spaced-apart surfaces of a tissue mass, typically against opposed surfaces of the tissue mass. The first and second electrode structures may have generally similar geometries to contact tissue in a symmetric fashion. Alternatively, the electrode structures may have dissimilar geometries, e.g. one of the electrode structures may be configured as a probe for insertion into a natural body orifice with the other electrode structure being configured for engagement against an exterior tissue surface spaced-apart from said orifice.<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/124595	PCT/US2006/018440<br>
In some instances, more than two electrode structures may be employed, but at least two electrode structures (or separate regions of a single structure) are energized with opposite polarity to provide for application of the radio frequency energy to the tissue. In some other instances, the electrode structures may be different regions formed as part of a single support structure, e.g. a single elastic tube or shell which may be placed over an organ or other tissue mass and which has two or more electrode surfaces formed thereon. The different electrode surfaces are, of course, isolated from each other when they are intended to apply high frequency energy of opposite polarities. It is equally important for the electrodes not be in contact if they are of like polarity as well. In still other instances, a single electrode structure may have a plurality of electrically conductive or active regions, where the electrically conductive regions may be energized with the same or an opposite polarity. In other instances, electrode structures may be provided with tissue-penetrating elements to enhance electrode-tissue contact and increase the total available area of the electrically active region(s) on the electrode structure to deliver high frequency energy to the tissue. The use of such tissue-penetrating elements may be in addition to or in place of the use of conformable or rigid surface electrodes. In all instances, the electrode structures, or electrically active regions thereof, are configured to engage a substantially continuous segment or portion of the tissue surface having a minimum area as set forth below. When tissue-penetrating elements are used, they typically are dispersed in a general uniform matter over the electrically active area of the electrode structure.<br>
High frequency (usually radio frequency) power is applied to the tissue mass through the electrically active regions(s) of the electrode structures, and the power is applied for a time and in an amount sufficient to cauterize or necrose tissue between said electrodes, preferably at least along a desired resection plane. Often, a volume of the tissue is resected by morcellating, e.g. grinding, comminuting, cutting into small pieces, or the like. Such morcellation is greatly facilitated by necrosis of the target tissue volume. By necrosed, it is meant that the cells of the tissue have been killed and that bleeding of the tissue, upon subsequent resection, has been substantially inhibited. The tissue are usually resected along a plane within the necrosed tissue mass, with minimal bleeding as described above.<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/124595	PCT/US2006/018440<br>
The electrically active regions of the electrode structures have an area of at least 1 cm2, more usually at least 2 cm2, often having areas of 5 cm2 or larger, more often having areas of 10 cm2 or larger, still more often having areas of 50 cm2 or larger. The electrodes may have a wide variety of characteristics, may generally be rigid, flexible, elastic, malleable, conformable, or the like. Preferably, the electrodes flexible to facilitate engagement of the electrode against, and conformance to, a tissue surface. In at least some instances, it is desirable to provide flexible, elastic electrodes which may be conformed about the outer periphery of a tissue or organ surface, where the elastic nature of the electrode assures firm engagement and electrode contact. In other instances, however, the electrodes may be specifically configured to have a desired geometry for engaging a particular tissue surface.<br>
The high frequency energy applied to the organ or tissue is generally provided at radio frequency typically, but not limited to the range from 100 kHz to 10 MHz, usually from 200 kHz to 750 kHz. The power levels depend on the surface area and volume of tissue being treated, but generally fall within the range from 10 W to 500 W, usually from 25 W to 250 W, more usually from 50 W to 200 W. Power is usually applied at a level of from 1 W/cm2 to 500 W/cm2, more usually from 10 W/cm2 to 100 W/cm2. The power is applied for a time sufficient to raise the tissue temperature in the tissue mass being treated to above a threshold level required for cauterization or necrosis, usually being above at least 60° C, frequently being above 70° C, and often above 80°C, or higher. The application of energy should be limited, however, so that adjacent tissue is not significantly heated or otherwise damaged. The use of opposed, bipolar electrodes is particularly advantageous in this regard because it concentrates the energy flux between the electrodes and limits the effect on adjacent tissue which are not confined within the opposed electrodes. The resulting necrosed tissue may comprise substantially the entire organ being treated, or in other cases may comprise a more narrow region, e.g. a planar region.<br>
In another aspect, the invention comprises systems including at least a plurality of electrodes, and a power supply that is connectable to the electrodes for applying, for example, bipolar, high frequency power therebetween. The electrodes may be configured generally as described above, and are usually carried by an electrosurgical probe to facilitate deployment. The probe may have a wide variety of configurations, but usually<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/124595	PCT/US2006/018440<br>
comprises at least a shaft and a handle for manipulating the shaft. The electrodes are mounted at a distal end of the shaft and are usually manipulable from the proximal end of the shaft so that they may be opened and closed relative to each other to engage and capture an organ or other tissue mass therebetween. The electrodes may have any of the properties described above, and may in particular comprise metallic or metallized mesh which can elastically engage and conform to tissue surfaces. The electrosurgical probes may be used in a conventional bipolar manner, i.e. where each electrode is powered at an opposite polarity. Alternatively, the electrode surfaces may be powered at the same polarity with another electrode or electrodes used for completing the high frequency circuit. Typically, the other electrode(s) are in the form of one or more probes which may be inserted into a natural body orifice or lumen or may be introduced into an organ or other tissue mass. The probe(s) may conform to a natural lumen and/or saline or other electrically conductive fluid may be introduced into the lumen to help establish the conductive path.<br>
In a specific embodiment, an electrosurgical device may comprise a single conformable structure, such as an elastically or non-elastically expansible tubular member, e.g. an expansible tubular braid mesh. The electrodes are formed on a plurality of locations over the conformable support structure and are usually isolated from each other, e.g. either by applying insulation or by relying on the inherently non-conductive nature of the conformable support structure.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS<br>
The methods, systems, and apparatus of the invention are useful for treating a variety of organs, portions of organs, or other solid tissue regions in a patient. The organ or other tissue mass have spaced-apart tissue surfaces, usually opposed tissue surfaces, which are accessible to electrode structures and which permit the application of radio frequency power between said surfaces. The tissue surfaces may be readily accessible or may require pre-treatment to gain access, e.g. blunt dissection, resection of small tissues or blood vessels using conventional surgical techniques, or the like. Organs which may be treated by the invention include the uterus, liver, prostate, kidney, bowel, pancreas, lung, breast, muscle, and the like.<br>
The organs and other tissue are treated with bipolar radio frequency power directed at target tissue regions which are defined by spaced-apart placement of the electrode structures. The radio frequency power may be supplied by conventional general purpose electrosurgical power supplies operated at any accepted frequency, typically in the ranges set forth above. Power supplies may employ conventional sinusoidal or non-sinusoidal wave forms and may operate with fixed or controlled power levels, where the voltage, current, or both may be selected. Suitable power supplies are available from commercial suppliers, such as Valleylab, Aspen, and Bovie. In some instances, it will be desirable to use impedance matching transformers between the power supply and the electrodes to enhance the efficiency of energy delivery.<br>
The electrodes may be configured in any manner suitable for engaging a tissue surface. Thus, the electrodes can be rigid, flexible, elastic, inelastic (non-distensible), planar, non-planar, or the like, and may optionally employ tissue-penetrating elements to enhance electrical contact between the electrode structure and the tissue, as well as to increase the electrode area. Preferred electrode configurations are either conformable so that they can be engaged against and conform to widely differing tissue surfaces (see, for example, U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 11/371,988 (Attorney Docket No. ARGA0003), the entirety of which is incorporated herein by this reference<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/124595	PCT/US2006/018440<br>
thereto), or they are specifically configured to have a geometry intended to engage a particular organ or tissue geometry. In both instances, the electrode structures may further be provided with tissue-penetrating elements. Examples of each are discussed hereinafter.<br>
One electrode configuration uses a metallized mesh which is both flexible and elastic. Such meshes are suitable for use on retractable electrodes, such as retractable electrodes useful for minimally invasive procedures. The meshes may be suspended on or between more rigid frame members, where the frame members may be themselves expanded or contracted to deploy the mesh electrodes. Such meshes are also useful for fabricating elastic tubes or shells which may be placed over an organ or tissue mass like a sock. In the case of such tubular electrodes, it often desirable to form two or more discrete electrode surfaces on a single mesh, where the electrode surfaces are isolated, usually by virtue of the material properties of the mesh itself, i.e. they are polymeric and non-conductive. The elastic meshes can be in the form of a braid or other woven structure, e.g. as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,431,676; 5,234,425; and 4,018,230, the full disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. The use of radially expansible braid structures is desirable because the diameter of the tissue-receiving lumen therein can be controlled by axial elongation. That is, the braid can be expanded by shortening its length and contracted by extending its length. All such mesh and braid structures can be metallized by conventional electroless plating techniques. Suitable for metals for plating include gold, silver, copper, stainless steel, and combinations and alloys thereof. Suitable elastomeric mesh materials include a wide variety of elastomers. Suitable braided mesh materials include nylon and other generally non-distensible polymers.<br>
All types of electrode structures may be configured to have a conductive surface and a non-conductive surface. This is usually accomplished by leaving one surface as an exposed metallic face, while the other surface of the electrode is covered or insulated. In the case of rigid electrodes, the insulation can be laminated, coated, or otherwise applied directly to the opposed surface. In the case of flexible and elastic electrodes, it is necessary that the insulating layer also be flexible so that it can be expanded and contracted together with the electrode without loss or removal. In some cases, it is desirable to employ a separate sheet of material which is<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/124595	PCT/US2006/018440<br>
expanded together with the electrode and which covers the face which is desired to be insulated.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 1, a system 10 according to the invention comprises a first, compound electrode 12, a second electrode 14, and a radio frequency power supply 16. The first electrode comprises a plurality of rigid plates that are independently connected to one pole of the power supply 16 and the second electrode is a rigid plate connected to the opposite pole. In other embodiments, the second electrode could be non-rigid and could represent multiple electrodes as well. In fact, multiple return electrodes are preferable in certain cases. The electrodes 12 and 14 can be engaged against a tissue mass T to engage opposed surfaces thereof. Radio frequency power is then selectively applied to the tissue through any combination of the plurality of rigid plates which form electrode 12 (as discussed in greater detail below) to cauterize the mass of tissue which is captured between the electrodes 12 and 14 completely. After the tissue is cauterized, it may be resected along a line within the cauterized region of tissue. Advantageously, resection within the cauterized tissue minimizes bleeding and simplifies hemostasis.<br>
For use in cauterizing the tissue of, for example, the uterus, conformable electrodes and may be placed over opposed exterior surfaces of the uterus. Rather than applying high frequency energy of opposite polarities, as generally described above, the electrodes may be powered at a common polarity by a power supply. A probe may be inserted into the uterine cavity and powered at the opposite polarity. In this way, the opposed tissue surfaces comprise the interior lining of the uterine cavity on the one hand and the exterior surface of the uterus on the other hand. In the case of the uterus, it is generally desirable to cauterize substantially the entire tissue mass, with the possible exception of the cervical neck. In the case of other body organs and tissue masses, however, it may be desirable to cauterize only a portion of the tissue. The high frequency energy can be directed to limited portions of the tissue by choosing the configurations of the electrodes.<br>
Preferably, the electrodes comprise a plurality of different electrically conductive regions, where the regions may be electrically isolated from each other or may be electrically coupled to each other. Single electrode structures may include three, four, five and as many as ten or more discrete electrically conductive regions thereon. Such electrically conductive regions are usually<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/124595	PCT/US2006/018440<br>
defined by electrically insulating regions or structure therebetween. When it is desired that two or more of the electrically conductive regions be electrically coupled, small electrical connections can be provided to bridge the insulation between the regions. Usually, at least some of the isolated, electrically conductive regions on the electrode structures are powered at opposite polarities, and in some instances the methods of the invention can be performed using only a single electrode structure having multiple electrically conductive regions thereon. Alternatively, isolated, electrically conductive regions on a single electrode structure may be powered at the same polarity, where a primary purpose of the different regions is to control or configure the high energy electrical flux being delivered into the tissue mass. For example, it may be desirable to deliver high frequency electrical energy into spaced-apart regions of a tissue mass without cauterizing other areas in between or adjacent to the region to be cauterized. In such cases, the electrode structures can be configured by appropriate placement of the electrically conductive regions.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a system 300 that comprises a pair of electrode structures 302 and 304. At least one of the electrode structures 304 comprises a plurality of individual electrically conductive strips 310 which are spaced apart such that they are electrically isolated from each other. In other embodiments, the conductive strips may be separated by an electrically insulating material. The electrically conductive strips 310 may be selectively powered at different polarities in virtually any pattern. Often, it is desirable to energize the strips so that adjacent strips have opposite polarities. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the electrodes may be discrete or that they may be formed by such techniques as screening, electrodeposition, and the like.<br>
To this point in the description, the electrically conducted surfaces of the electrode structures have generally comprised rigid or conformable components having continuous surface geometries, i.e. surface geometries which are selected to create an uninterrupted interface with the tissue surface against which they are engaged. In some instances, it may be desirable to provide additional structure or components on the electrode structures to enhance or increase the effective electrical contact area between the electrode structure and the tissue surface. In particular, it is often desirable to provide tissue-penetrating elements on the electrode structures to both enhance electrical contact, i.e. reduce electrical impedance between the<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/124595	PCT/US2006/018440<br>
electrode and the tissue and, more importantly, to increase the total surface contact area between the electrode and the tissue. The tissue-penetrating elements may be needles, pins, protrusions, channels, or the like, but are usually pins having sharpened distal tips so that they can penetrate through the tissue surface and into the underlying tissue mass. The pins may have depths in the rage from 1 mm to 5 cm, usually being from 3 mm to 1 cm. The diameters of the pins may be from 0.1 mm to 5 mm, usually being from 0.5 mm to 3 mm. Usually, the pins are evenly distributed over the tissue-contact area of an electrode structure, with a pin density in the range from 0.1 pin/cm2 to 10 pin/cm2, usually from 0.5 pin/cm2 to 5 pin/cm2. Usually, the pins or other tissue-penetrating elements are provided in addition to an electrically conductive conformable or rigid electrode surface, but in some instances the pins may provide the total electrically conductive or active area of an electrode structure.<br>
A system comprising a pair plurality of electrode structures can include electrically conductive strips separated, for example, by insulating rods. In addition, however, tissue-penetrating pins can be disposed along each of the electrically conductive strips. It is appreciated that a plurality of pins are disposed along the length of each strip. The electrode structures are generally of a curved configuration so that they may be placed over a tubular body structure or tissue mass. It is appreciated, however, that the strips may be formed from conformable meshes which permit the electrode structures to be flattened out or to assume a wide variety of other configurations. Additionally, the insulating structures may also be formed from a flexible or conformable material, permitting further reconfiguration of the electrode structures.<br>
The electrically conductive strips may be energized in an alternating polarity configuration. Most simply, adjacent strips are connected to opposite polls on a single power supply. It is a simple matter, however, to rearrange the electrical connections to power the strips in virtually any pattern. Moreover, it is also possible to isolate different regions of each strip electrically e.g. nos. 1 and 2 to permit powering those regions at different polarities.<br>
Using the system 300, a variety of different tissue cauterization patterns can be achieved by selective energization of different ones of the electrode surfaces or regions. By selectively energizing two adjacent electrode<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/124595	PCT/US2006/018440<br>
surfaces in a bipolar fashion, while leaving all other surfaces non-energized, a limited tissue region is cauterized. In contrast, by energizing other electrode surfaces e.g. nos. 4, 5, 6, and 7, a much larger region is cauterized. Slightly different patterns are achieved depending on the precise pattern of electrode surface polarity. The electrode surfaces can be energized in an alternating pattern of polarity (+, -, +, -) to produce a tissue cauterization pattern. Patterns of (+, +, -, -); (+, -, -, +); (-, +, +, -) etc., could also be used to produce somewhat different patterns of cauterizedtissue.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates an electrosurgical probe 50 that includes a pair of jaws 56 having a distal end 58 and a proximal end 60. Alternatively, this probe may comprise a shaft that is typically a cylinder sized for introduction through a conventional cannula of the type used in minimally invasive surgery. Thus, the shaft typically has a diameter in the range from 5 mm to 15 mm, usually being nominally 5 mm, 10 mm, or 12 mm, to be consistent with conventional cannulas. The length of the shaft typically in the range from 10 cm to 30 cm, with the particular range depending on the intended procedure.<br>
The electrosurgical probe 50 includes a handle assembly 62 that is attached to the proximal end 60 of the jaws56. The handle includes a lever assembly 64 which is connected to actuate the electrodes 304 after they are deployed. The handle also includes a coaxial connector for connecting the electrodes to an electrosurgical power supply, as described herein, although the electrodes may be powered by conventional power supplies as well.<br>
The electrosurgical probe 50 may be employed to cauterize and resect a portion of liver. For example, the probe may be introduced through a cannula, and the electrodes advanced and opened so that they can capture a portion of the liver L which is to be removed. After the electrodes are closed against opposed surfaces of the liver, the radio frequency energy may be applied, as described above. After the tissue is fully cauterized, it may be resected along any line within the necrosed tissue mass. Optionally, the electrosurgica! probe may be used to cauterize a series of tissue masses adjacent each other to cauterize and resect a larger tissue mass than would be possible using only a single application of radio frequency energy.<br>

WO 2006/124595	PCT/US2006/018440<br>
In one embodiment, the electrodes may be used, for example, to cauterize and resect a uterus. The uterus comprises a main body having fallopian tubes extending from each side. In addition to the fallopian tubes, several large blood vessels extend generally from the midline of the uterus. The electrodes may be placed over the anterior and posterior surfaces of the uterus with the fallopian tubes remaining attached and extending outwardly from between the electrode structures. Depending upon the procedure, in some cases the fallopian tubes would be included in the sealed, cauterized, and dissected region and, in others, the choice may be not to seal and cauterize the fallopian tubes. This decision is based upon whether the ovaries are to be removed along with the uterus or not. Radio frequency power may then be applied to the uterus, typically at a power level in the range from 10 W/cm2 to 100 W/cm2 for a time in the range from 10 sec. to 20 min., until the body of the uterus is substantially completely necrosed. Because of the geometry of the electrodes the necrosed body of the uterus terminates along a line generally at the cervical end of the uterus, as well as along lines adjacent the fallopian tubes. The uterus may then be resected along lines within the cauterized tissue region but adjacent the cervix and fallopian tubes. Resection within the cauterized regions of the uterus substantially minimizes bleeding and facilitates hemostasis. The uterus may then be removed, either intact in the case of open surgical procedures. In the case of minimally invasive procedures, the uterus may optionally be morcellated (comminuted into small pieces) prior to removal.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, parallel electrodes are provided along the device, thus preventing positive-to-negative contact if opposing jaws and electrodes are brought into contact. In this embodiment, the oppositely charged electrodes that are mounted in the same jaws must be mounted in a non-conductive material to prevent shorting.<br>
The jaws can be offset by a soft compressive material, such as a foam rubber, to prevent the electrodes from contacting, while assuring secure contact with all intermediate tissue. This embodiment of the invention can accommodate variable tissue thicknesses, which are expected to be likely over 5-10 cm of tissue.<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/124595	PCT/US2006/018440<br>
To prevent local areas of high impedance from impacting the overall system impedance along the entire electrode, and thus potentially reducing the power output of the entire system as the voltage reaches its maximal capacity, multiple electrodes could be located physically in series. These electrodes may be powered simultaneously or in a repetitive sequential or other series. The electrodes may also be powered entirely independently of each other. In this manner, if one area that has already been well sealed and has thus reached high impedance value, it does not affect other regions in which the tissue is not yet sealed, and is thus at a lower impedance, i.e. impedance goes up as sealing occurs and this can limit power transmission. Each electrode or electron pair can have unique power and energy delivery profiles, based on the properties of the tissue in a specific electrode location/position.<br>
As should be apparent from the disclosure herein, there is a benefit to using longer electrosurgery electrodes or other high-energy sealing impedance mechanisms to save operating time in a number of surgical procedures. For example, depending on the makeup of the tissue involved and its thickness along the length of tissue to be cauterized, geometry variations of both the electrosurgical jaws and power supply may be optimized to facilitate surgical removal of part or all of particular organs.<br>
For example, the connective tissue or ligaments of the uterus are relatively thin and of relatively low impedance, i.e. less than three Ohms in many cases before energy is delivered to the tissue, based on animal models. However, this impedance is not constant, both along the length of tissue being cauterized, and during the course of cauterization. Therefore, a power supply with a capacity of, for example, less than 100 volts is not adequate to seal and coagulate all tissue and blood vessels supporting the organ fully because it is often necessary to ramp up the voltage after initially applying power to cauterize the tissue to maintain power levels in light of increasing impedance as the sealing and cauterization process progresses. Further, for thicker tissue or organs, such as the liver, lungs, or bowel, or for longer segments of tissue, significantly higher voltages are likely to be required. For more delicate tissues or locations, high voltage power energy levels may not be safe. In<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/124595	PCT/US2006/018440<br>
addition, due to the higher impedance of some of these organs and tissues, the power supply must have sufficient cut-off for discontinuing power to the organ at the end of the sealing cycle. Thus, the power supply should automatically terminate current flow to the tissue once the power supply has determined the completion of the sealing cycle. Although manually discontinuing power delivery is an option, it is less desirable because it is subjective and it is less likely to include an accurate analysis of the condition of the tissue or organ. The automatic feedback system disclosed herein prevents excessive heating or burning of surrounding healthy tissues and organs, as well as minimizing tissue adhesion to the electrodes, while assuring adequate vessel sealing. Therefore, the power supply herein has multiple adjustable settings that the user can select based on the organ to be treated. A prior characterization of each organ determines preset voltage limits and curves, as well as final shutdown (endpoint) parameters based on time, impedance, voltage, current, temperature or energy data, or some combination of these for each specific organ. Therefore, processes that optimize safety and efficacy for the specific procedure are used. Based on the degree of vascularity and size of the blood vessels present, various tissues and organs may require different settings as well.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention runs a test burst of current through the tissue for a short, i.e. less than five seconds, time period, at a low, safe power level. The profile data generated during this period are quickly, i.e. less than five seconds, and automatically programmed into an algorithm that optimizes the voltage, energy, time, and/or power delivery based on the conditions determined during the test period to seal the tissue or organ safely and effectively.<br>
Likewise, the geometry of the jaws/electrodes are optimized for each indication. The length of the jaws and handle segments is optimized for the length of the tissue and location to be sealed and dissected. The force and/or minimum compression gap generated by the jaws is optimized for the tissue selected as well. A minimum force is required to ensure adequate uniform sealing among the entire length of tissue. However, excessive force may<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/124595	PCT/US2006/018440<br>
result in undesired damage to the tissue and cause significant bleeding prior to the sealing process. The optimal compression force is either predetermined for each organ or the compression handles are designed to exert a predefined force level for a particular organ. In one embodiment of the invention, this is controlled via a slip clutch-type mechanism similar to a torque wrench, or by a travel limiter for the jaws. Thus, there are separate devices designed for each application or once device that could have multiple individual settings that are adjusted to predetermined settings for the organ or thickness of organ to be operated on or removed. In some embodiments, force may be adjusted automatically and dynamically by sensing pressure along the length of one or both jaws with one or more strain gauges associated therewith.<br>
The force exerted by the jaws in other embodiments may be limited by the materials used for the jaws themselves. In the case of an organ or a tissue where the force required to compress and seal the tissue safely is low, a material with a lower flexural modulus may be more appropriate, while in a tissue that can be safely clamped at a higher level to assure effective sealing, a higher modulus material may be used.<br>
In another embodiment, the thickness of the jaws is adjusted by inflating a hollow chamber within the jaws with a pressurized fluid.<br>
The angle between the handles and the jaws of the device may also be optimized to the application. This is determined mainly by the angle of attack of the procedure in the surgical environment. Rather than an abrupt angle, the device may have a gentle or gradual curve for certain applications.<br>
The cutting or dissecting portion of the process may be optimized for specific organs as well. In the case where the cutting is performed by a sharp-edged blade, the width of the blade may vary based on the thickness of the tissue or organ to be removed. The thickness of the cutting material may also be optimized based on how readily the specific thickness/tissue cuts. More tenacious tissue may require more of a saw motion or a thicker or serrated blade or scissor mechanism, which, again, is predetermined for a specific<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/124595	PCT/US2006/018440<br>
application. If high energy systems are used to dissect the tissue, these may also be optimized for the application, as previously described in the power supply section above.<br>
With regard to a multiple electrode algorithm as taught herein, each electrode is treated independently in terms of energy transmission and RF cycle monitoring, modulation, and termination. The parameters to be monitored in the presently preferred embodiment of the invention are current, voltage, impedance, energy, power, time, and temperature. Any combination of these parameters may be monitored, as well as the values of other parameters. These values may be monitored in a mathematical model that combines them into a single algorithm that determines the quality of the RF sealing process based on prior empirical analysis. The energy and/or power output may be modulated to optimize artery and vein sealing in the shortest time possible, preferably less than one minute, and desirable less than 30 seconds, without excessive heat transmission that could damage surrounding healthy tissue or result in excessive heat that could bond the tissue to the electrode surface. The optimization of the cycle can be based on an algorithm program into the power generator software/firmware that modulates and ultimately terminates the cycle when conditions have been met that have been empirically determined to safely and repeatedly satisfy the conditions of the surgical procedure being performed. For example, reaching a certain impedance and/or temperature value and continuing the power level for a predetermined amount of time beyond this point, or reducing (or conversely increasing) the power level once a certain impedance and pressure or temperature threshold have been reached.<br>
Once desiccation of tissue has occurred, impedance tends to reach a plateau and becomes less of a measure of the quality of the sealing process which occurs after the point that desiccation has begun. Therefore, impedance measurement alone may not be an accurate determinant of successful vessel/tissue sealing. Thus, multiple modulations, step functions, or continuous changes in power, voltage, and/or energy, are provided to optimize the sealing cycle. The cycle changes or modulation may result in<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/124595	PCT/US2006/018440<br>
upward or downward complex variable changes to optimize the blood vessel/tissue sealing conditions. As a result, each electrode or electrode pair may have different cycle times and power, current, voltage, and energy profiles as a result of the feedback data for the specific segment of tissue contacting the specific electrode. The modulation/determination program may be a complex algorithm based on monitoring multiple variables and responding to a combination of predetermined conditions to adjust and terminate the cycle.<br>
With regards to these variables, the following are typical:<br>
Power 10-1000 watts/ channel or electrode pair, typically 100-500 watts/channel or electrode pair;<br>
Impedance 2-500 Ohms, typically 2-200 Ohms; Voltage 5-500 volts, typically 50-250 volts; Time space 1-1200 seconds, typically 5-30 seconds; and Energy 1-30,000 joules, typically 1,000-10,000 joules.<br>
In a presently preferred embodiment, the power generator is comprised of a constant output power design as opposed to a constant voltage or constant current design. In the inventive design, the power output is manifested based upon the load on the system. Thus, if the system sees a very high impedance load, the voltage is maintained at a reasonable level to avoid arcing. In the application to which the power generator is put, i.e. electro-cauterization, the impedance range may vary between, for example, two ohms and 150 ohms during the cauterization of tissue. By applying constant power, the presently inventive power source provides significant current at low impedance to achieve initial desiccation when the tissue is first being cauterized and, as cauterization proceeds, to apply higher voltage to complete the tissue sealing process. Thus, the invention provides larger current and smaller voltage at<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/124595	PCT/US2006/018440<br>
the beginning of the cauterization process and a higher voltage and lower current at the sealing phase of the process. Control of such power generator only requires that the system monitor power.<br>
In the presently preferred embodiment, the power source is provided with a mechanism for setting the desired power. This can in accordance with a profile or otherwise, as discussed below. Pulse width modulation is used in connection with a flyback transformer. The system charges a primary of the flyback transformer and produces a regulated output. The secondary may be regulated, for example 15 volts at a desired number of amperes to produce the desired power output. Based upon the period, as determined by the width of the pulse which charges the primary, the power curve is determined. Thus, the invention establishes a certain level of power in the primary of the flyback transformer and the same level of power is provided by the secondary without regard to impedance of the load, i.e. the tissue.<br>
In the preferred embodiment invention, the power generator is a source of power for multiple electrodes in the electrical surgical appliance. Accordingly, the power generator is provided with a plurality of output channels, each of which is independently adjustable. In Figure 3, a block diagram is provided that shows a electrical surgical appliance 300 including a plurality of electrodes 310 as discussed above in connection with Figures 1 and 2. The electrical surgical appliance includes a conductive path 55 which typically comprises a plurality of conductors, one for each power generator output channel, for receiving power from power generator 16, and a return path 360 for providing a ground path and/or feedback to a power generator which may comprise any of information concerning current, voltage, impedance, energy, power, and temperature. Appropriate sensors are provided in the electro-surgical appliance. For example, a thermistor can be used to sense temperature, while impedance can be measured between any two or more of the electrodes. Alternatively, a ground plane may be provided on one jaw of the electro-surgical appliance and the individual electrodes may be placed on the other jaw of the electro-surgical appliance, such that a path is provided from and addressed from the electrode through the return electrode. Thus,<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2006/124595	PCT/US2006/018440<br>
the one jaw may establish a ground plane for the electrodes that are placed on the other jaw. Additionally, the power generator may be connected to the electrodes at its positive and/or negative terminals. Accordingly, the electronics within the power generator may reassign the polarity and/or use of the various terminals 310 within the appliance in real time. For example, one of the electrodes, or terminals, may be retained as a impedance sensing element. In other embodiments of the invention, this element may be dedicated for purposes of sensing impedance throughout the process.<br>
The power generator 16 is comprised of a power source 335 that has multiple outputs which are controlled by control electronics 50 and thus routed to the individual electrodes in the electro-surgical appliance, as discussed above. The multiple outputs are independently operated by a microprocessor or other control mechanism 330 and are readily modulated and assignable. Thus, an output may be assigned to any one or more of the electrode elements at a certain point in operation of a cauterization cycle, and may be dynamically reassigned at other points of time. For example, if the power source were a four channel power source and the electro-surgical device had 16 electrodes, ,then each channel may support four electrodes in electro-surgical device. However, this arrangement may altered so that some channels support more electrodes than others.<br>
The microprocessor 330 may be configured through a series of profiles 340 to operate the device with a power curve and power distribution amongst the various electrodes in accordance with the procedure to be performed. Thus, for a hysterectomy a certain profile may be established for the electro-surgical appliance, while for a liver procedure a different profile may be established. Additionally, a smart card reader 365 may be provided that both configures the system for a particular procedure and that provides memory for recording information as to the operation of the power generator during the procedure. For example, the application of power to each channel, impedance sensed, the temperature sensed, and the like is captured to document the procedure.<br>
Figure 4 is a flow diagram showing an algorithm for power modulation<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2006/124595	PCT/US2006/018440<br>
according to the invention. At the start of the process, the user determines the profile (400) to be applied for a particular procedure. For example, some tissues or procedures may require a higher initial power level and then provide a reduction in the power level during the cauterization process.<br>
The probe (electro-surgical appliance) is positioned (405) and the power for the power source is turned on (410). The system initializes itself (415), for example by taking initial impedance readings along the various electrodes in the electro-surgical appliance to develop a profile for the tissue to be cauterized. Initialization may also include the taking of initial temperature readings, strain pressure readings which are indicative of the thickness of the tissue along the surgical appliance surface, and other readings. A pilot signal may be transferred through the electro-surgical appliance to determine these values. For example, an initial low voltage may be provided to measure impedance. In this way, a real time profile may be developed for the actual tissue to be cauterized that may be used as an adaptation to the pre-established profile for a particular procedure. Thus, the profile which is established for the procedure may be modified in accordance with measurements related to the tissue to be cauterzied.<br>
The system then sets thresholds (420) which determine when an endpoint is approached. These thresholds may be determined by measurements such as impedance, current, voltage, energy, power, and temperature. The thresholds may also operate in connection with a time element. Thus, when a threshold is reached, the system may continue to operate for a certain period of time to assure that an appropriate endpoint is reached, such that cauterization is complete. In some embodiments, power generator channels that are assigned to electrodes for portions of the tissue that have reached an endpoint may be reassigned to those electrodes that are still actively cauterizing tissue to provide additional power to the process and thus hasten its conclusion.<br>
Power is applied to the electro-surgical appliance (425) to commence cauterization. The system monitors two or more parameters during this<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2006/124595	PCT/US2006/018440<br>
process and determines when a threshold is reached (430). Once the threshold is reached, an endpoint procedure (435) is implemented. The endpoint procedure may be as simple as ramping the power down or it may also involve setting a timer. It is important to note that the application of power, while constant across a wide range of impedance may be modulated during the process of cauterization such that a power curve is applied for the procedure. Because the invention provides multiple channels of power for multiple electrodes, some electrodes may reach an endpoint before others. In this case, power to these electrodes is terminated while power is continued to be applied to the other electrodes. Thus, each electrode may have a difference power curve that is modulated in real time. If all endpoints are not reached (440), then the process continues (445); else the power to the system is turned off (450) and the procedure is complete.<br>
The electro-surgical appliance incorporates sensors for capturing various process parameters in real time in accordance with the algorithm. Thus, impedance may be measured between selected electrode pairs or groups of electrodes; temperature may be measured in connection with one or more physical transitions along the surface of the appliance; and the effect of cauterization may be measured with local strain gauges situated along the length of one or both probe jaws (in this embodiment, strain gauges may also be used to precompute a cauterization profile). In this regard, each electrode may be thought of as a separate device which is independently operated for a particular region along the surface of tissue that is contacted by the probe jaws.<br>
Although the invention is described herein with reference to the preferred embodiment, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that other applications may be substituted for those set forth herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, in some embodiments the power generator senses whether or not tissue is present at each electrode at the beginning of a cauterization cycle by measuring any of impedance, pressure, or any combination of these and/or other parameters. If<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2006/124595	PCT/US2006/018440<br>
for any electrode pair no tissue is present, then such electrode pair is idle and an indication to this effect is provided to a power generator operator. The power generator may also provide a status indicator for each electrode pair that indicates whether the sealing cycle is active or completed with regard to each electrode pair. In this embodiment, each electrode pair can comprise a mode status indicator, such as an LED for example, that indicates any of an idle, active, or complete condition, once a cauterization cycle is commenced.<br>
