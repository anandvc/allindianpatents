Description<br>
Composition for the impregnation of fibers, fabrics and nettings imparting a protective<br>
activity against pests<br>
The present invention relates to an insecticide composition for application to a textile material or plastics material selected from the group consisting of yarn, fibers, fabric, knitgoods, nonwovens, netting material, foils, tarpaulins and coating compositions, which insecticide composition comprises a mixture including at least one insecticide and/or at least one repellent, and at least one binder; an impregnated textile material or plastics material comprising at least one insecticide and/or at least one repellent, and at least one binder; processes for impregnation of a textile material or plastics material and a process for coating of a textile material or plastics material.<br>
Infectious diseases cause huge damages by debilitating or even killing humans and animals in many countries, especially in tropical countries. Many of these diseases (e.g. malaria, dengue and yellow fever, lymphatic filariasis, and leishmaniasis) are transmitted by insects. Since many medical methods like vaccination or medical treatments are either impossible or too expensive or have been rendered ineffective due to spreading resistance against drugs, efforts have been concentrated on controlling the transmitting insects. Methods to control these insects comprise treating surfaces of huts and houses, air spraying and impregnation of curtains and bednets. The latter treatment is up to now mostly done by dipping the textile material into emulsions or dispersions of insecticides or spraying them onto the nets. Since this provides only a loose adhesion of the insecticide molecules on the surface of the fibers, this treatment is not wash-permanent and has to be repeated after each washing. Studies have proven long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) to be more reliable in preventing carrier-borne diseases in comparison with conventional nets, which have to be re-impregnated with insecticide after each washing. Experience shows, however, that washed nets are not re-treated in many cases leaving them without any biological activity. WHO, UNICEF and global relief organisations therefore recommend pre-treated, long-lasting insecticide-treated nets which are wash-permanent as an effective means for the containment of deadly tropical diseases, especially malaria and dengue fever. This is not only comfortable for the user but gives him an economic advantage as well, saving the costs for the repeated impregnation. It is an ecological advantage as well, since the permanent treatment is done under controlled conditions in textile finishing plants.<br>
WO 01/37662 discloses impregnated nettings or fabrics for insect or tick killing and/or repellent of an insect or tick comprising an insecticide and/or a repellent, and a film<br><br>
forming component reducing the wash off and degradation of the insecticide component from the netting or fabric by forming a water- and optionally an oil-resistant film. The film forming component preferably comprises one or more components selected from paraffin oil or wax derivatives, silicon derivatives, silicon oils or wax derivatives, and polyfluorocarbon derivatives. The netting or fabric is impregnated by adding a solution or a water emulsion of an insecticide and/or repellent and a film forming component successively (in two steps) or in one process step. According to the specification of WO 01/37662 is the insecticide and/or repellent dissolved in an organic solvent in the process for impregnation of a fabric or a netting.<br>
WO 03/034823 discloses an insecticide composition for application to a fabric material, which composition comprises a mixture including an insecticide, a copolymeric binder, that, after drying and while the fabric material is dry, imparts hydrophobicity to the insecticide, and a dispersing agent, that, after application of the composition to a fabric and upon wetting the fabric, reduces the hydrophobicity imparted to the insecticide by the binder to permit limited insecticide release. The copolymeric binder is prepared as a copolymer emulsion that is derived by an emulsion polymerization technique from monomers selected from at least one of the groups including a) vinyl esters of aliphatic acid having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, such as vinyl acetate and vinyl versatate; b) acrylic and methacrylic esters of an alcohol having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, such as butyl acry-late, 2-ethylhexylacrylate, and methyl acrylate; and c) mono- and di-ethylenically un-saturated hydrocarbons, such as styrene, and aliphatic diens, such as butadiene. The preferred copolymeric binder is prepared by emulsion polymerisation of two different monomers. The insecticide composition of WO 03/034823 is applied to the fabric or netting by dipping, spraying, brushing, and the like. According to the examples the insecticides have to be dissolved in organic solvents before applying the insecticide composition to a fabric material.<br>
US 5,631,072 discloses the manufacture of fabric intended to be made into washable garments, more specifically to the placement of an insecticide such as permethrin in the fabric by impregnation with polymeric binders and a cross-linking agent, or by surface coating with a polymeric binder and a thickening agent to improve the efficiency as an insect repellent and retention of the permethrin in the fabric as an effective insecticide through successive washings of the garments. According to the examples, suitable binders are acrylic binders and polyvinylacetate binders, which are not further specified. The amount of insecticide in the solutions for impregnation of the fabric is very high (1250 mg insecticide per m2).<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an insecticide composition for application to a textile material or plastics material, wherein the insecticide is not washed out<br><br>

The aim of the invention is to control a variety of pests, such as ticks, cockroaches, bed bugs, mites, fleas, lice, leeches, houseflies, mosquitoes, termites, ants, moths, spiders, grasshoppers, crickets, silverfish, also in form of their larvae and eggs, and other flying and crawling insects, and molluscs, e.g. snails and slugs, and rodents, eg. rats and mice as well as fungi, e.g. fungi causing athlete's foot.<br>
The textile material or plastics material may be made form a variety of natural and synthetic fibers, also as textile blends in woven or non-woven form, as knit goods, yarns or fibers. Natural fibers are for example cotton, wool, silk, jute or hamp. Synthetic fibers are for example polyamides, polyesters, polyacryl nitriles, polyolefines, for example<br>
■a<br>
polypropylene or polyethylene, Teflon, and mixtures of fibers, for example mixtures of synthetic and natural fibers. Polyamides, polyolefins and polyesters are preferred. Polyethylene terephthalate is especially preferred.<br>
According to the present invention the term textile material or plastics material also discloses non-textile substrates such as coating compositions, leather, synthetic adaptions of leather, flocked fabrics, sheetings, foils and packaging material.<br>
Most preferred are nettings made from polyester, especially polyethylene terephthalate.<br>
The textile material or plastics material may be in form of coverings, for example bedclothes, mattresses, pillows, duvets, cushions, curtains, wall coverings, carpeting and window, cupboard and door screens. Further typical textile materials or plastics materials are geotextiles, tents, inner soles of shoes, garments, such as socks, trousers, shirts, i.e. preferably garments, e.g. uniforms, used in body areas exposed to insecticide bites and the like as well as horse blankets. The nettings are for example used as bed nets for example mosquito nets, or for covering or as nets in agriculture and viniculture. Other applications are movable fences for the protection of humans and animals against air-borne low-flying insects. Fabrics or nettings may be used for packages, wrapping sacks, containers for food, seeds and feed thus protecting the material from attack by insects but avoiding direct contact with the insecticide-treated nets or fabrics.<br>
Treated foils or tarpaulins can be used on all human premises which are permanently or temporarily inhabited such as refugee camps.<br><br>
It is further possible to use the treated nettings in dwellings having mud walls. A treated netting is pressed into a fresh, wet wall mud before it dries. The mud will ooze into the holes in the net but the yam of the net will not be covered. When this wall covering is dried the insecticide and/or repellent of the treated net is slowly released and can repell or kill pests that corne into contact with the wall.<br>
The insecticide composition of the present invention is particularly suitable for application to polyester nettings as used for mosquito nets.<br>
The insecticide composition of the present invention may be applied to textile materials or plastics materials before their formation into the desired products, i.e. while still a yam or in sheet form, or after formation of the desired products.<br>
Insecticide and/or repellent (component A)<br>
According to the present invention the term insecticide and/or repellent also discloses besides insecticides and repellents rodenticides, fungicides, molluscicides, larvicides and ovicides.<br>
Preferably, the insecticide and/or repellent is an insecticide and/or repellent with a fast paralyzing or killing effect of the insect and very low mammalian toxicity. Suitable insecticides and/or repellents are known by a person skilled in the art. Suitable insecticides and repellents and suitable dosages are for example mentioned on the webside of the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/whopes/recommendations/en/), especially in "Malaria Vector Control", "Insecticides for Indoor Residual Spraying" by Dr. J.A. Najera &amp; Dr. M. Zaim, 2001.<br>

The insecticide compositions comprising the specific binder as claimed in the present invention are wash resistant while permitting continuous release of the insecticide at a controlled rate, in order to provide the required bioavailability of the insecticide. It is not necessary to add for example a dispersing agent that, after application of the composition to a fabric and upon wetting of the fabric, reduces the hydrophobicity imparted to the insecticide by the binder to permit limited insecticide release. Preferably, the insecticide composition of the present invention does therefore not comprise a dispersing agent in addition to the acrylic binder.<br>

The acrylic binder of the present invention is obtainable by emulsion polymerization of the monomers mentioned before. Suitable process conditions are known by a person skilled in the art.<br>
The monomers are polymerized under usual conditions of temperature and pressure, Le. at from atmospheric pressure to 10 bar and in general at temperatures of from 20 to 100 °C, preferably 50 to 85 °C, depending on the initiator used- Usually the polymerization is carried out in a stirred reaction vessel under an inert atmosphere.<br>
The copolymerization is generally carried out in water. However, it is also possible to add before, within or after the polymerization process up to 80 % by weight, relating to the aqueous phase, of a lower alcohol like methanol, ethanol or isopropanol or a lower ketone like acetone. Preferably the copolymerization is carried out in water without addition of further solvents.<br>
The polymerization process may be carried out continuously or batch-wise, and it is<br>
possible to employ the usual methods of batch-wise polymerization, e.g. mixing all po<br>
lymerization components at once or feeding emulsified monomers and catalysts from<br>
one or more metering vessels to a batch containing a portion of a monomer. It is possi<br>
ble to add polymer seed to the polymerization mixture to adjust the particle size of the<br>
emulsion polymers obtained.	 <br>
The emulsion polymerization is preferably carried out in the presence at least one initiator which form radicals under the polymerization conditions. Suitable initiators are for example all common peroxy compounds or azo compounds.<br>
Suitable peroxides are for example alkali metal peroxodisulfates, for example sodium peroxodisulfate, ammonium peroxodisulfate; hydrogen peroxide; organic peroxides, for example diacetyl peroxide, di-tert-butyl peroxide, diamylperoxide, dloctanoyl peroxide, didecanoyl peroxide, dilauroyl peroxide, dibenzol peroxide, bis-(o-toloyl)peroxide, suc-cinyl peroxide, tert-butyl peracetate, tert-butyl permaleinate, tert-butyl perpivalate, tert-butylperoctoate, tert-butyl perneodecanoate, tert-butyl perbenzoate, tert-butyl peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, tert-butyl-peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate, and diisopropyl peroxodicarbamate. Further suitable initiators are azo compounds, for example azobis isobutyronitrile, anzobis(2-amidopropane)dihydrochloride, and 2,2'-azobis(2-methylbutyronitrile).<br>
The initiators are added in usual amounts, for example in an amount of 0.05 to 5 % by weight, preferably 0.05 to 2 % by weight, based on the total weight of monomers.<br>
If the polymerization is carried out at low temperature, use may be made of conventional redox catalysts. For example, it is possible to use, in addition to the peroxide catalysts of the above kinds, from 0.05 to 2 % by weight, based on the total of monomers, of reducing agents such as hydrazine, soluble oxidizable sulfoxy compounds such as alkali metal salts of hydrosulfites, sulfoxylates, thiosuifates, sulfites, and bisul-fites, which may be optionally activated by the addition of traces of heavy metals, e.g. salts of Ce, Mo, Fe, and Cu, in the usual manner. Preferred redox catalysts are redox catalysts of acetone disulfite and organic peroxides like tert-C4Hg-OOH; Na2S2O5 and organic peroxides like tert-C4~Hg-OOH; or HO-CH2SO2H and organic peroxides like tert-C4Hg-OOH.

iii)    optionally removing surplus aqueous formulation or surplus melt; and iv)    drying and/or curing the textile material or plastics material.<br>
In the context of the present invention an aqueous formulation may be a solution, an emulsion or a suspension/dispersion.<br>
The aqueous formulation or the melt preferably comprises the insecticide composition as disclosed in the present invention, which is preferably employed in form of an aqueous formulation.<br>
!n the nontext of the present invention "impregnation" is a process for applying the insecticide composition. This process may include a process for curing the applied insecticide composition to achieve a coating onto the textile material or plastics material, if desired. An Impregnated textile material or plastics material" is a material onto which the insecticide composition is applied. The Impregnated textile material or plastics ma-teriaT may be coated by curing the applied insecticide composition, if desired.<br>
The insecticide composition of the present invention may also be applied onto the textile or plastics material by transfer printing, inkjet printing, a screen process, and powder printing-Suitable textile materials or plastics materials are mentioned before, it is possible to impregnate the textile or plastics material in form of its finished product (end of line treatment, discontinuous treatment). In this case no further pass is necessary after impregnation. However, it is also possible to impregnate the textile or plastics material in form of a yarn or fibers, which have to be further processed after impregnation to obtain<br><br>
the desired finished product (in line treatment). Preferred insecticides and/or repellents used are also defined before as well as preferred acrylic binders and/or polyurethanes.<br>
The discontinuous treatment may be performed in factories, in local treatment centers (local factories) or even with mobile equipment which is e.g. mounted on trucks or pickups (e.g. in re-treatment antimalaria campaigns). The discontinuous treatment may be done on new (untreated textile materials oer plastics materials, preferably nettings, in use or made-up form (preferably as nets) or on used textile materials or plastics materials (preferably nets), preferably after washing.<br>
It is one advantage of the present invention that the impregnation is carried out in an aqueous formulation or in a melt. It is not necessary to add any organic solvents. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the treatment bath is an aqueous formulation which does not comprise any further solvents, especially no organic solvents.<br>
It is advantageous to avoid the use of organic solvents because the textile material or plastics material of the present invention may be used in close contact to the human body. The textile material or plastics material impregnated by the method of the present invention does not comprise any organic solvent residue which is beneficial both from a human toxicological and an ecological point of view.<br>
The aqueous formulation or the melt employed in the impregnation process may further comprise one or more ingredients selected from the group consisting of preservatives, detergents, stabilisers, agents having UV-protecting properties, spreading agents, anti-migrating agents, foam-forming agents, wetting agents, anti-soiling agents, thickeners, further biocides, plasticizers, adhesive agents, fragrance, pigments and dyestuffs.<br>
In a further embodiment the aqueous formulations or the melts employed for impregnation of the textile material or plastics material comprise in addition to the at least one insecticide and/or repellent and the at least one acrylic binder and/or at least one poly-urethane at least one pigment and/or at least one dyestuff. These aqueous formulations or melts are suitable for impregnation of the textile material or plastics material with at least one insecticide and/or repellent and additionally coloring the textile material or plastics material at the same time. Many of the textile materials or plastics materials which are impregnated with at least one insecticide and/or repellent are preferably colored. With the process of the present invention it is possible to color and impregnate the textile material or plastics material with an insecticide and/or repellent at the same time. The method of the present invention is therefore very economical, because the coloring and impregnation with an insecticide and/or repellent is carried out in one step.<br><br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention the present invention therefore relates to a process for impregnation of a textile material or plastics material as described before, wherein the dyeing of the textile material or plastics material is carried out simultaneously with the impregnation of the textile material or plastics material, wherein an aqueous formulation is formed further comprising at least one dyestuff and/or at least one pigment<br>
Suitable amounts of pigments are in general 0,01 to 20 % by weight, preferably 0.1 to 10 % by weight, more preferably 0.2 to 5 % by weight, based on the weight of the aqueous formulation used for impregnation. Suitable dyestuffs are employed in general in an amount of from 0,01 to 20 % by weight, preferably 0,1 to 10 % by weight, more preferably 0.2 to 5 % by weight, based on the weight of the aqueous formulation used for impregnation.<br>
Step i) Forming an aqueous formulation comprising an insecticide and/or repellent and at least one acrylic binder and/or at least one polyurethane and optionally further ingredients<br>
The aqueous formulation is formed by mixing all ingredients necessary for impregnation of the textile material or plastics material with water. The aqueous formulation is generally formed at temperatures of from 10 to 70 °C, preferably 15 to 50 °C, more preferably 20 to 40 °C. Suitable aqueous formulations comprise an insecticide composition for application to a textile material or plastics material as described in the present invention.<br>
Step ii) Applying the aqueous formulation comprising an insecticide and/or repellent and at least one acrylic binder and/or at least one polyurethane and optionally further ingredients to the textile material or plastics material<br>
Step iia)<br>
The insecticide composition is applied by passing the textile material or plastics material through the aqueous formulation. This step is known by a person skilled in the art as padding. In a preferred embodiment the textile material or plastics material is completely submerged in the aqueous treatment liquor (aqueous formulation) either in a trough containing the liquor or passed through the treatment bath (aqueous formulation) which is held between two horizontally oriented rollers.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the textile material or plastics material may either be passed through the aqueous formulation or the aqueous formulation may be passed through the textile material or plastics material. These processes are preferred for im-<br><br>
pregnating open-width material which is later tailored into nets. For small-scale production or re-impregnating of non-treated nets, use of a simple hand-held roller might be sufficient.<br>
Step lib)<br>
It is further possible to apply the aqueous formulation onto the textile material or plastics material by one-side only-coating applications methods. Suitable one-side only-coating application methods are for example knjfe-/doctor-blade-coating, roller coating or screen-printing. By this methods it is possible to impregnate only one side of the textile material or plastics material which is advantageous, if e.g. direct contact of the human skin with insecticide-treated material is to be avoided.<br>
Knife-Zdoctor-blade-coating systems are for example knife-over-air-systems, knife-over-roller systems, knife-over-table systems or knife-over-rubber-belt systems. Further knife coating systems are for example commabar or Mayerbar knife systems.<br>
Roller-coating systems are for example kiss-coating systems with one, two, three or more rollers, reverse-roll-coater systems and raster roll systems. In these roller-coating systems at least one roller is partly dipped into the aqueous formulation thus applying the aqueous formulation to the side of the textile material or plastics material in contact with the roller (kiss-rolling).<br>
Screen-printing systems are for example rotary-screen printing systems and flat-screen printing systems. With these applications methods a dot coating or a full-surface coating can be applied to the textile material or the plastics material, for example by using an additional whisper-blade behind the rotary-screen.<br>
A person skilled in the art will adjust the viscositiy of the aqueous formulation used by applying thickeners where appropriate.<br>
Step He)<br>
It is further possible to apply the aqueous formulations to the textile material or plastics material by double-side coating application methods, for example double-side knife-coating systems, foulard with two air-knifes or foulard with squeezing rollers.<br>
By using the double-side-knife-coating system or by passing two times through a one-side-only coating system, it is possible to apply the aqueous formulation only to the surfaces of both sides of the textile material or plastics material and thus to reduce the quantitiy of the aqueous formulations needed for a certain effect<br><br>
Step iid) and step He)<br>
It is further possible to apply the aqueous formulation by spraying the solution or emulsion onto the textile material or plastics material. Further it is possible, to apply the emulsion in the form of a foam which is applied to the textile material or plastics material. A foam comprises less water than the solution or emulsion mentioned above. The drying process may therefore be very short.<br>
Step iff), iig) and step iih)<br>
It is further possible to apply the aqueous formulation onto the textile material or plastics material by submerging the textile material or plastics material into the aqueous formulation, brushing the aqueous formulation onto or into the textile material or plastics material, or pouring the aqueous formulation onto the textile material or plastics material. Said methods are known by a person skilled in the art.<br>
Impregnation of the fabric material or netting in step iia), iib), iic), iid), iie), iif), iig), or iih) is carried out at temperatures of in general from 10 to 70 °C, preferably 15 to 50 °C, more preferably 20 to 40 °C.<br>
Step Hi) Optionally removing the surplus aqueous formulation<br>
The surplus aqueous formulation is usually removed by squeezing the textile material or plastics material, preferably by passing the textile material or plastics material rollers as known in the art, preferably by means of doctor blade, thus achieving a defined liquor uptake. The squeezed-off liquor is usually re-used.<br>
The surplus aqueous formulation may alternatively be removed by centrifuging or vacuum suction.<br>
Step iv) Drying and/or curing the textile material or plastics material<br>
The drying is in general carried out temperatures below 200 °C. Preferred temperatures are from 50 to 170 °C, more preferably from 70 to 150 °C. The temperature choice is a function of the evaporation temperature and mobility of the insecticide in the formulation.<br><br>
It should be noted that the drying process may be a passive drying as the process may be carried out in rather hot climates. An active drying process would normally be performed during high scale processing.<br>
After or simultaneously to the drying, the impregnated textile material or plastics material is optionally finally cured and/or fixated. A person skilled in the art knows how to carry out a curing and/or fixation. The curing process is in general carried out at a temperature which may be higher than the drying temperature. Preferred temperatures for curing are 60 to 170 °C, preferably 70 to 170 °C, more preferably 80 to 150 °C. Drying and curing can be advantageously be performed during one single process, e.g. in stenters with different compartments which can be heated to different temperatures. If a reactive crosslinking agent is used temperatures may be lower, e.g. 30 to 130°C, preferably 30 to 100°C.<br>
The drying and/or curing may be achieved in any equipment usually applied in textile mills for these purposes, such as stenters, loop dryers, hotflues, tumble dryers, pad steam machines etc. In one embodiment of the present invention, equipment for continuous drying and/or curing is applied. In another embodiment of the present invention, equipment for discontinuous (batch-wise) drying and/or curing is used. Such equipment may comprise rotary or tumble dryers used in professional laundries, combined laundry/dryers which may be heated to the treatment temperatures, e.g. jeans stone-wash. The treatment chemicals may be added as a liquid or be sprayed onto the netting material and then brought to a homogeneous distribution by rotating the wet material before or during drying/curing. The treatment liquor may be added in excess if it is possible to remove the excess liquor e.g. by centrifuging. A person skilled in the art will be aware that treatment times might be longer than in the continuous process at the same temperature.<br>
The curing process may also include or consist of passing the textile material or plastics material by a heated surface under pressure such as an iron or a heated roller. During drying processes and curing the textile material or plastics material is preferably mechanically fixated in a way to prevent change of the form e.g. shrinkage or dimensional deformation. Further, is is prevented that the insecticide and/or repellent is washed out. The curing and/or fixation may be alternatively carried out by a dual-cure process combining heat and UV-light or only by UV-light. Suitable processes are known by a person skilled in the art.<br><br>
The acrylic binder and/or the polyurethane may advantageously be applied with a fixative agent for improved attachment of the insecticide and/or repellent on the textile material or plastics material. The fixative agent may comprise free isocyanate groups.<br>
Suitable fixative agents are for example isocyanurates comprising free isocyanate groups. Preferably the isocyanurates are based on alkylene diisocyanates having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkylene unit, like 1,12-dodecane diisocyanate, 2-ethyltetramethylene diisocyanate-1,4, 2-methylpentamethylene diisocyanate-1,5, tetramethylene diisocyanate-1,4, lysinester diisocyanate (LDI), hexamethylene diisocy-anate-1,6 (HMDI), cyclohexane-1,3-and/or-1,4-diisocyanate, 2,4-and 2,6-hexahydro-toluylene diisocyanate as well as the corresponding isomeric mixtures 4,4'-2,2'- and 2,4'-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate as well as the corresponding mixtures, 1-isocyanato-3,3,5-trimethyi-5-isocyanatomethyl cyciohexane (IPDI), 2,4- and/or 2,6-toluylene diisocyanate, 4,4'-, 2,4' and/or 2,2'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (mono-meric MDI), polyphenylpolymethylene polyisocyanate (polymeric MDI) and/or mixtures comprising at least 2 of the isocyanates mentioned before. More preferably the isocyanurates are based on hexamethylene diisocyanate-1,6 (HMDI).<br>

Examples of use (B01 to B14)<br>
The long-lasting insecticidal treatment was performed with aqueous dispersions according to examples A1 - A17 on commercially available white polyester netting material (fiber titer 75 denier, 156 mesh, weight 28-32 g/m2) without prior washing. The aqueous treatment baths were prepared by mixing the aqueous dispersions with commercially available emulsions of insecticide and/or repellent, setting pH with buffer solutions and adding a fixative (if needed). The concentrations of the treatment baths were adjusted according to the liquor uptake possible (LU between 60 and 100 %). The treatment baths were applied by using a padder-stenter equipment on a laboratory scale (Mathis AG, Switzerland). The netting material is fully immersed into the treatment bath and excess liquor is removed by passing it through cylinders which move in counter-direction. By choosing a defined uisianoe between these cylinders (and thus a defined pressure) the liquor uptake can be controlled. The liquor uptake is measured by weighing an impregnated piece of netting and subtracting the weight of the dry, untreated netting and is given as % weight of liquor on weight of netting. The drying/curing step was performed in a laboratory stenter which allows to control the temperature and time of the treatment.<br>
The treated nettings have been washed different times as mentioned in table 2 (see column "Knock-down 60 min"; the statement in parenthesis (number plus w) indicates how often the netting has been washed before the tesing was carried out). The washing was carried out by the "Montpellier washing procedure" (as described in the annex WHO PVC, 3/07/2002 "Evaluation of wash resistance of long-lasting insecticidal nets"): Net samples are washed individually in beakers containing 0.5 L deionised water and 2 g/L soap (pH 10-11) at 30 °C in a water bath shaken for 10 minutes in clean water at<br><br>
155 movements per minute. The soap used comprises (among further components like etidronic acid and sodium hydroxide or coconut acid, tetra sodium EDTA and limonene) the following ingredients: Sodium tallowate, water, sodium palm kemelate or sodium cocoate, perfume, glycerol, sodium chloride and some dyestuff (C.I. 77891).<br>
Samples were bioassayed according to the cone testing procedure described below. Testing procedure:<br>
The testing follows the basic guidelines of WHO cone testing procedures with a few modifications. Cones (WHO cones (WHOPES 96.1): clear plastic cone structures (11 cm diam.) with a flat flange around the bottom edge and a hole at the apex) are held against treated net pieces (25 x 25 cm) via a hand-made manifold apparatus modeled similarly to CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) methodology. The manifold device used is made by cutting four holes (9 cm diameter) in a plastic serving tray (30.5 x 41.0 cm, Consolidated Plastics). An unmodified tray of the same dimensions acts as a base. Onto the surface of the base tray two pieces of blotter paper are placed, cut to fit inside the tray. A piece of treated netting is then placed onto the blotter paper followed by four WHO cones placed to roughly correspond to the positioning of the holes cut in the manifold (top) tray. This top tray is then placed over the cones so they pass through the holes. The top tray is then securely fastened to the base tray using four large binder clips. The blotter paper helps to ensure a reasonably tight fit of the cones to the netting. Mixed sex mosquitoes, 1-5 days old, are removed from a rearing cage with an aspirator and ca. 5 mosquitoes placed into each cone. A lab timer is started after the introduction of insects into the first cone with each cone supplied with mosquitoes ca. 15 seconds apart, taking one minute to fill all the cones. Each cone is plugged with a rubber stopper immediately after introduction of the insects. Mosquitoes are held in each cone for three minutes where each insect typically rests on the netting surface (if treatment is not strongly repellent). If any mosquito rests on the wall of a cone then the cone can be tapped gently to relocate the insect to the netting. After three minutes, the insects are all removed by aspirator and placed into a plastic holding cup, combining mosquitoes from all four cones, which represent a single replicate. Four replicates of each treatment are recommended. The holding cup consists of a clear plastic cup (9 cm tall x 6.5 cm wide) with a plastic screw-on lid. A 1 cm hole in the lid is used to insert the aspirator for insect deposition. One set of mosquitoes from each cone is collected and deposited into the holding container at a time.<br><br>
Between insertions of the aspirator tip into the container lid, an overhead transparency marker is used to plug the hole to prevent insect escape. After all four cones have been emptied of insects into the holding container, the hole is then plugged with a cotton dental wick soaked with 10% sugar water. The end of the wick sticking out of the cup should have the end manually flattened somewhat to ensure that it doesn't fall into the cup and allow mosquito escape. Knockdown (KD) data are generally taken from the pooled mosquitoes at 60 minutes and 24-hours. A 30-minute (or other) reading can be included if deemed necessary. For speed of knockdown, the mosquito can be left in the cone and the time to KD recorded for each individual mosquito. Each KD mosquito is removed as it goes down to prevent recounting that insect if it once again flies. All mosquitoes are then held as described previously for a 24-hour Mortality count.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

5 kg untreated netting material was put into a rotary dryer and 5 Liters of treatment bath, comprising 10 g/L of polymer according to example A17, 6.4 g/L Alphacyperme-thrin as a dispersion, 0.66 g/L fixative agent (isocyanurate based on HMDI which is hydrophilized with a polyethylene oxide and which is dissolved in propylene carbonate (70 % by weight of HMDI in 30 % by weight of propylene carbonate);the amount of free isocyanate groups is 11 to 12 % by weight, based on the amount of isocyanate used as staring material for the preparation of the isocyanurate;the boiling point of the fixative agent is 240-245°C, and the viscosity is 280 mPa.s (Brookfield 100 U/rnin) and set to pH 6 with a buffer solution, were sprayed onto the material at room temperature. The dryer was heated to 80 °C while rotating the material and kept at 80 °C for 15 minutes while rotating. The treated netting was washed up to 15 times following the protocol described earlier ("Montpellier washing procedure") and bioassayed as described above-Results: Knock-down after 60 minutes: 98.9 % Mortality after 24 hours: 93.5 %.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
