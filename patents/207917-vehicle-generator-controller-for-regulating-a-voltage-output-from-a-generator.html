The constant voltage power supply circuit 8 is composed of a series circuit inserted between the key switch 10 and the ground and including a pull-up resistor 801 and a Zener diode 802.<br>
With this arrangement, when the key switch 10 is<br>
turned on, the constant power source A is created from the<br>
i<br>
*<br>
point where the pull-up resistor 801 is connected to the<br>
Zener diode 802 based on the battery voltage VB.	j<br>
Next, operation of the conventional vehicle<br>
generator controller shown in FIG. 4 will be described with<br>
reference to the waveform view of FIG. 5.	.<br>
First, when the key switch 10 is turned on, the<br>
I<br>
battery voltage VB of the battery 9 is turned on the Zenfer<br>
*	i<br>
diode 802 through the resistor 801 and the constant power source A which is clamped by the Zener diode 802 is created from the point where the resistor 801 is connected to the Zener diode 802.<br>
With this operation, although the controller of the generator 1 is made to an operable state, since the generator 1 does not yet start power generation, the signal level on the non- inverting input terminal ( + ) side of the<br><br>
comparator 405 in the voltage regulator 4 is lower than the reference voltage VR on the inverting terminal (~) thereof<br>
and  accordingly  the  comparator  405  outputs  the  voltage<br>
i<br>
detection signal D of a level.<br>
At the time, since the capacitor 503 in the smoothing circuit 5 is not charged, the voltage VC has a zero potential. Therefore, the signal level on the non-inverting input terminal ( + ) side of the comparator 702 in the comparison circuit 7 is lower than a triangle voltage VT and the gradual increase control signal E is fixed to a low level and the transistor 712 remains in an off-state.<br>
Consequently, the transistor 407 is turned on and the field current IF flows to the field coil 102 to thereby put the generator 1 to a power generation possible state.<br>
When the internal combustion engine starts operation and the generator 1 starts power generation by<br>
i<br>
being driven by the, internal combustion engine, the signal<br>
level on the non-inverting input terminal (+) side of the<br>
comparator 405 in the voltage regulator 4 is increased 'by<br>
the increase of the battery voltage VB.  When the signal<br>
level on the non-inverting input terminal (+) side becomes<br>
i higher than the reference voltage VR, the voltage detection<br>
signal D is switched from the low level to a high level and<br>
i<br>
the transistor 407 is switched from a conducting State to. a<br>
!<br>
shut-off state*<br><br>
As described above, the voltage regulator 4 detects the battery voltage VB at all times and when, for example, it detects the drop of the battery voltage VB, it increases the conducting ratio of the transistor 407 through the comparator 702.<br>
Since the field current IF is increased by the increase of the conducting ratio of the transistor 407 and the battery 9 is charged by the increase of the output from<br>
the generator 1, the battery voltage VB is controlled to a<br>
i<br>
constant rated voltage.<br>
When, for example, the switch 12 is turned on and the electric load 11 is turned on, the comparator 702 is operated and the field current IF is increased by the drop of the battery voltage VB.<br>
At the time, although the comparator 405 which<br>
responds to the battery voltage VB creates the voltage<br>
detection signal D of a low level by increasing the<br>
conducting duty of the field current IF, since the<br>
discharging time constant of the smoothing circuit 5 is jset<br>
longer than the charging time constant thereof, the<br>
comparator 702 in the comparison circuit 7 increases ;the<br>
conducting ratio of the transistor 407 so as to gradually<br>
increase the duty as shown in FIG. 5.	j<br>
i<br>
Therefore, the field current IF gradually increase<br>
i<br>
as the conducting ratio of the transistor 407 increases; so<br>
i<br><br>
i<br>
that the output from the generator 1 gradually increases while suppressing a response shock.<br>
However, when the gradual increase control is simply executed just after the electric load 11 is turned on, the voltage drop caused by the supply of the power to the electric load 11 cannot be instantly compensated.<br>
As are result,  the battery voltage VB greatly<br>
drops just after the electric load 11 is turned on as shown<br>
i<br>
in FIG. 5 and the quantity of light of, for example, head lights is lowered, which makes the driver uncomfortable.<br>
To suppress the drop of the battery voltage VB,<br>
1	i<br>
there is proposed a technology for iricreasing the conducting ratio of the transistor 407 to a predetermined value a % (about 10%) before the start of the gradual increase control as disclosed in,  for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Publication No. 2-32726.<br>
i<br>
FIG. 6 is a waveform view when the conducting ratio is increased to the predetermined value (a %) just before the gradual increase control.<br>
In this case, the switching duty (conducting ratio) for intermittently controlling the field current IF is not gradually increased from 0% but it is abruptly increased to a % (about 10%) in order to that the field current IF (generated current) is increased at an inclination faster than that in a gradually increasing time<br><br>
and thereafter gradually increased at a certain inclination.<br>
i I<br>
With this operation,  although the drop of the<br>
i<br>
battery voltage VB is suppressed to some degree, since the conducting ratio is set to the relatively low value of a % (about 10 %) at the beginning of the control, the insufficient charge of the battery 9 cannot be sufficiently compensated.<br>
Further, since a certain degree of delay is caused during a time until the generated current is increased by a % as compared with a controller in which the field current IF is not gradually increased, the drop of the battery voltage VB is also increased.<br>
As described above, the conventional vehicle<br>
generator controller, which simply gradually increases the<br>
generated current when the electric load is turned on, has a<br>
problem that the battery voltage VB greatly decreases at the<br>
beginning of the control, which makes the driver<br>
uncomfortable.	!<br>
Further, the conventional vehicle generator controller, which increases the generated current (corresponding to the field current IF) to a % (about 10%) at the inclination faster than that when it is gradually increased before the field current IF is gradually increased ^ at the certain inclination when the electric load is turned on, has a problem that the battery voltage VB also greatly<br><br>
drops because the insufficient charge of the battery is not<br>
sufficiently compensated although the drop of the battery<br>
voltage VB is slightly suppressed.<br>
An object of the present invention made to s olive<br>
the  above  problems  is  to  provide  a  vehicle  generator<br>
controller which suppresses a response torque shock caused<br>
when an electric load is turned on as well as sufficiently<br>
i suppresses the drop of a battery voltage.<br>

In FIG. ,1 , the main output terminal 201 of a rectifier 2A also acts as an output terminal for exiting a field coil 102, by which the series circuit composed of the diode 111 and the resistor 112 in FIG. 4 is omitted.<br>

The inverter circuit 501 inverts a voltage detection signal D and the transistor 502 executes switching<br>
operation in synchronism with the output signal from jthe<br>
&gt;<br>
i<br>
inverter circuit 501.   The capacitor 503 is charged and<br><br>
discharged by the switching of the transistor 502 and the<br>
resistors  504 and 505 determine the charging/discharging<br>
i<br>
time constant of the capacitor 503.<br>
The gradual increase prohibition circuit	20<br>
includes a conducting time measurement circuit 6	for<br>
measuring the conducting time of a field current IF and	the<br>
conducting time measurement circuit 6 includes an emitter-<br>
grounded transistor 601 having a base connected to	the<br>
output terminal of the comparator 405, a capacitor	602<br>
inserted between the collector of the transistor 601 and	the<br>
emitter thereof and a resistor 603 inserted between	the<br>
constant power source A and the collector of the transistor<br>
i<br>
601 .<br>
The gradual increase prohibition circuit 20 includes resistors 703 and 704 inserted . in series between the constant power source A and the ground and a comparator 705 having an inverting input terminal (-) connected to the point where the resistor 703v is connected to the resistor . 704 and a non-inverting input terminal (+) connected to an<br>
end of the capacitor 602-<br>
The transistor 601 is switched in synchronism with the voltage detection signal D and the capacitor 602 is charged and discharged by the intermittent operation of the transistor 601.<br>
The  resistor  603  constitutes  a  time  constant<br><br>
circuit together with the capacitor 602 and determines the<br>
charging time constant of the capacitor 602.	,<br>
The resistors 703 and 704 divide the voltage of the constant power source A and creates a reference voltage VR2.<br>
The comparator 705 compares the voltage VC2 of the capacitor 602 with the reference voltage VR2 and when the voltage VC2 of the capacitor 602 is lower than the reference voltage VR2, the comparator 705 outputs a conducting signal F of a low level, whereas when the voltage VC2 of the capacitor 602 reaches the reference VR2, the comparator 705 outputs the conducting signal F of a high level.<br>

First, when a key switch 10 is turned on, the constant power source A is created by the constant voltage power supply circuit 8 likewise the mentioned above and the<br><br>
controller 3 is made to an operable state.<br>
At the time, since the generator 1 does not yet<br>
■ generate  power,  the voltage detection signal  D from the<br>
comparator 405 in the voltage regulator 4A is set to the low<br>
level.<br>
Therefore,  the output  signal  from the  inverter<br>
circuit 501 in the smoothing circuit 5A is set to the high<br>
level and the transistor 502 is conducted.<br>
I<br>
At the time, since the voltage VC of the capacitor<br>
i<br>
503 has a zero potential and the comparator 702 in the comparison circuit 7A outputs the gradual increase control signal E of the low level, the signal output from the AND circuit 706 is set to the low level.<br>
On the other hand, since the transistor 601 in the conducting time measurement circuit 6 is shut off by the voltage detection signal D of the low level, the capacitor 602 is charged by the constant power source A through the resistor 603.<br>
Therefore, the voltage VC2 of the capacitor 602 input to the comparator 705 is larger than the reference voltage VR2 created by the constant power source A and the resistors 703, 704.<br>
The circuit constant values of the capacitor 602 and the resistor 603 in the conducting time measurement circuit 6 are set such that the charging time constant of<br><br>
the capacitor 602 is made to 100 milliseconds. Further, the circuit constant values of the capacitor 602 and the resistor 603 as Well as the resistance values of the resistors 703 and 704 in the gradual increase prohibition circuit 20 are set such that the charging time during which<br>
the voltage VC2 of the capacitor 602 reaches the reference<br>
i<br>
voltage  VR2  from  the  zero  potential  is  made  to  a<br>
i<br>
predetermined time (for example, 30 milliseconds).<br>
i<br>
As a result, since the voltage detection signal D<br>
of the low level and the low-level signal from the AND<br>
i circuit 706 are input to the NOR circuit 406 in the voltage<br>
regulator 4, the signal output from the NOR circuit 406 is<br>
made to the high level.<br>
Therefore, the transistor 407 is conducted and the field current IF flows to the field coil 102, so that the generator 1 is permitted to generate power.<br>
Next, when the generator 1 starts power generation by the start-up of an internal combustion engine and the input level of the non-inverting input terminal (+) of the comparator 405 is made higher than the reference voltage VR, the voltage detection signal D is switched from the low level to the high level.<br>
With this operation, since the high level signal is input to the input terminal of the NOR circuit 406, the<br>
i<br>
output signal from the NOR circuit 406 is made to the low<br><br>
level and the transistor 407 is switched from the conducted<br>
I<br>
state to a shut-off state.<br>
At the time, the transistor 601 in the conducting time measurement circuit 6 is conducted in response to the voltage detection signal D of the high level to thereby instantly discharge the voltage VC of the capacitor 602 to the zero potential.<br>
Therefore, the signal level on the non-inverting input terminal (+) side of the comparator 705 in the gradual increase prohibition circuit 20 is made lower than the reference voltage VR2 and the conducting signal F is made j to the low level. With this operation, the low-level signal from the AND circuit 706 is imposed on one of the input terminals of the NOR circuit 406.<br>
On the other hand, if the field current , IF decreases  to thereby drop the voltage generated by the<br>
i<br>
generator 1 and the battery voltage and the input signal level of the comparator 405 in the voltage regulator 4A is made lower than the reference voltage VR, the voltage detection signal D is switched to the low level.<br>
With this operation, the transistor 601 in the conducting time measurement circuit 6 is shut off and the capacitor 602 is charged.<br>
However, since the predetermined time T during which the voltage VC2 of the capacitor 602 reaches the<br><br>
reference voltage VR2 is set to, for example, 30 millisecond, the conducting signal F from the gradual increase prohibition circuit 20 is maintained to the low level for 30 milliseconds.<br>
Consequently, the signal output from the AND circuit 706 is maintained to the low level only for 30 milliseconds and at the time both of a pair of the input signals of the NOR circuit 406 are made to the low level.<br>
As a result, the output signal from the NOR circuit 406 is switched to the high level, the transistor 407 is conducted to thereby increase the field current i IF and the voltage generated by the generator 1.<br>
As described above, the transistor 407 intermittently controls the field current IF by being intermittently and repeatedly turned on and off to thereby regulate the voltage generated by the generator 1 to; a predetermined value.<br>
At the time, since the inverter circuit 501 in the smoothing circuit 5A is operated in synchronism with the operation of the comparator 405 and intermittently operates the transistor 502, the capacitor 503 is charged to the voltage VC which is in proportion to the conducting ratio of the transistor 407,<br>
Note, it is sufficient to set the predetermined time  T  to  the  range  of  about  20  milliseconds  -  50<br><br>
milliseconds  although  it  is  different  depending  upon a<br>
required specification and a circuit specification.<br>
Next, operation when the electric load 11 in FIG.<br>
i 1  is turned on will be described with reference to the<br>
waveform view of FIG. 2.<br>
Since  the battery voltage VB  is  secured to a<br>
predetermined value when the generator 1 normally generates<br>
power,  the comparator 405 outputs the voltage detection<br>
i<br>
signal D of the high level which is switched to the low level through the NOR circuit 406 and shuts off the transistor 407.<br>
At the time, since the transistor 601 in the conducting time measurement circuit 6 is conducted and the voltage VC of the capacitor 602 is discharged to the zero potential, the conducting signal F output from the comparator 705 is to the low level and the signal output from the AND circuit 706 is fixed to the low level.<br>
Since the signal level on the non-inverting inpiut terminal ( + ) side of the comparator 405 is made lower than the reference voltage VR when the electric load 11 is turned on by turning on the switch 12, the voltage detection signal D is made to the low level to thereby intend to increase the<br>
conducting ratio of the transistor 407 through the smoothing<br>
i<br>
circuit 5A and the comparison circuit 7A.<br>
However, since the voltage VC of the capacitor 602<br><br>
in the conducting time measurement circuit 6 is not instantly charged even if the transistor 601 is shut off, the capacitor 602 is maintained in a state which is lower than the reference voltage VR2 for the predetermined time T (30 millisecond) and the comparator 705 outputs the conducting signal F of the low level at the time.<br>
Therefore, since the AND circuit 706 outputs a low- level signal in response to the voltage detection signal D of the low level from the comparator 405 ancl the conducting signal F of the low level from the comparator 705, both the input signals of the NOR circuit 406 are made to the low level and the output signal from the NOR circuit 406 is made to the high level.<br>
Consequently, the transistor 407 is conducted for the predetermined time T (30 milliseconds, the conducting ratio is 100%) to thereby increase the field current IF by a duty of 100% as shown in FIG. 2,<br>
With this operation, the drop of the battery voltage VB just after the electric load 11 is turned on is sufficiently suppressed.<br>
Since the transistor 601 in the conducting time<br>
measurement circuit 6 is shut off for a long time when the<br>
i<br>
electric load 11 is large and the voltage detection signal D exhibits the low level for a long time, the voltage VC2 of the capacitor 602 is gradually increased.<br><br>
1<br>
j<br>
When the shut-off time of the transistor 601 exceeds the predetermined time T (30 milliseconds) and the voltage VC2 of the capacitor 602 is made higher than the reference voltage VR2, the conducting signal F from the comparator 705 is switched to the high level.<br>
Therefore, the AND circuit 706 permits the gradual increase control signal E from the comparator 702 to pass as it is.<br>
At the time, the output signal from the inverter circuit 501 in the smoothing circuit 5 is made to the high level in response to the voltage detection signal D of the low level, so that the transistor 502 is conducted to thereby intend to discharge the capacitor 503.<br>
However, since the circuit constant values of the capacitor 503 and the resistors 504, 505 are set so as to make the discharging time constant of the capacitor 503 large (about a few seconds), the voltage VC of the capacitor 503 is not instantly discharged.<br>
Therefore, the comparator 702, which compares the<br>
voltage VC of the capacitor 503 with a triangle voltage VT,<br>
operates to intermittently control the transistor 407 by<br>
conducting and shutting off it at a predetermined cycle in<br>
response to the gradual increase control signal E until the<br>
voltage  generated  by  the  generator   1   reaches  the<br>
i predetermined value.<br><br>
At the time, the AND circuit 706 outputs the gradual increase control signal E from the comparator 702 as it is and the NOR circuit 406 outputs the signal which is obtained by inverting the output signal from the AND circuit 706.<br>
Consequently, the transistor 407 controls the field current IF by intermittently controlling it based on the duty ratio as shown in FIG. 2 to thereby delay the generation of the output current from the generator 1 so as to sufficiently suppress a torque shock likewise the conventional apparatus.<br>
Thereafter, the voltage detection signal D is made<br>
the high level at a time tl when the current output from the<br>
generator 1 reaches a current value corresponding to the<br>
electric load 11 and the voltage output from the generator 1<br>
reaches the predetermined value.	!<br>
With this operation, the transistor 601 in the conducting time measurement circuit 6 is conducted, the voltage VC2 of the capacitor 602 is instantly made to the zero potential, the conducting signal F from the comparator 705 is made to the low level and the output signal from the AND circuit 706 is made to the low level.<br>
Therefor, the transistor 407 is ordinarily controlled in accordance with the operation of the comparator 405.<br><br>
As described above, since the conducting signal F is maintained to the low level for the predetermined timd T and the gradual increase control signal E is made ineffective for the predetermined time T when the field<br>
current IF is increased by the turn-on of the electric load<br>
i<br>
11, the field current IF can be increased to the predetermined current at the conducting ratio of 100% likewise the apparatus in which the gradual increase control is not executed at the beginning of the control.<br>
With this operation, since the insufficient charge of the battery 9 can be compensated by sufficiently securing the generated current and the drop of the battery voltage VB can be sufficiently suppressed, no comfortable feeling is applied to the driver.<br>
Thereafter, the torque shock caused in response to the turn-on of the electric load 11 can b£ suppressed by gradually increasing the field current IF by setting the conducting signal F to the high level and making the gradual increase control signal E effective. Embodiment 2<br>
Note, although the conducting time measurement circuit 6 and the comparator 705 are used in the embodiment<br>
i<br>
1 to set the time for making the conducting ratio of the transistor 407 to 100% just after the electric load 11 is turned on, the time for making the conducting ratio of the<br><br>
transistor 407 to 100% may be set based on the increased<br>
amount of the field current.	j<br>
i FIG. 3 is a circuit diagram showing an embodiment<br>
2 of the present invention, wherein the same components as<br>
those mentioned above are denoted by the same numerals and<br>
the description thereof is not made in detail here.<br>
In this case, a controller 3B includes a gradual<br>
i<br>
increase prohibition circuit 20B (gradual increase urgent means) for determining a gradual increase control canceling period based on the increasing state of the field current IF, in addition to the voltage regulator 4A, the smoothing circuit 5A, the comparison circuit 7A and the constant voltage power supply circuit 8 which are mentioned above.<br>
The gradual increase prohibition circuit 20B includes a resistor 21 inserted between the emitter of a transistor 407 and the ground, a field current detection circuit 22 connected to an end of the resistor 21 and an increased amount detection circuit 23 for outputting a conducting signal F based on a detected value If detected from the field current detection circuit 22.<br>
The field current detection circuit 22 creates the detected value If which corresponds to the field current IF from the voltage value from the end of the resistor 21.;<br>
The increased amount detection circuit 23 maintains the conducting signal F to a low level in response<br><br>
to a voltage detection signal D of a low level and sets the conducting ratio of the transistor 407 to 100% and thereafter switches the conducting signal F to a high level when the increased amount of the detected value If from the field current detection circuit 22 exhibits a value larger than a predetermined value to thereby start the gradual increase control of the field current IF.<br>
With thi§ operation, when an electric load 11 is turned on, the gradual increase prohibition circuit pOB first sets the conducting ratio of the transistor 407 to 100% and detects that the field current IF has been increased by a predetermined value and thereafter the control of the field current IF is switched to the gradual<br>
increase control.	!<br>
i Therefore, the transistor 407 gradually increases<br>
the field current IF in response to the conducting signal F<br>
from the increased amount detection circuit 23.<br>
As a result, the drop of a battery voltage VB<br>
which is caused when the electric load 1 1 is turned on can<br>
be  sufficiently  suppressed  as  well  as  a  torque  shock<br>
resulting from the turn-on of the electric load 11 can be<br>
sufficiently suppressed.<br><br><br><br><br>
