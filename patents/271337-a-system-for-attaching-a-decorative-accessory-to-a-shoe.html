FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] The present invention relates to systems and methods for securing accessories to clothing. In particular, but not by way of limitation, the present invention relates to systems and methods for securing accessories to shoes with stretchable holes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] Clothing manufacturers have recently begun manufacturing articles such as shoes and belts made from a stretchable material (e.g., foam). For example, shoe manufacturers have recently begun manufacturing molded shoes that include expandable holes in the upper portion of the shoe. These shoes are generally formed of a foam material with an outer protective layer. CROCS â„¢, located in Boulder, Colorado, is one manufacturer of these types of shoes. FIG. 1 illustrates a typical molded shoe 100 with expandable holes 105 in the upper 110.<br>
[0006] Accessorizing these molded shoes has presented a significant challenge because of the proximity of the expandable holes 105 in the upper 110 to the wearer's foot. Moreover, these molded shoes are often used for outside activities, so durability of any accessory is important. In addition, children's and adults' models of these molded shoes may have holes of different sizes, and the upper portions may be of different thicknesses. These differences make it difficult to design accessories that fit all types of shoes. The same challenges regarding different hole sizes and thicknesses of material apply to other articles of clothing such as belts or hats.<br>
[0007] It is thus apparent that there is a need in the art for an improved system and method for securing accessories to clothing.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008] Illustrative embodiments of the present invention that are shown in the drawings are summarized below. These and other embodiments are more fully described in the Detailed Description section. It is to be understood, however, that there is no intention to limit the invention to the forms described in this Summary of the Invention or in the Detailed Description. One skilled in the art can recognize that there are numerous modifications, equivalents, and alternative constructions that fall within the spirit and scope of the invention as expressed in the claims.<br>
[0009] The present invention can provide a system and method for securing accessories to clothing. One illustrative embodiment is a system for attaching a decorative accessory to a shoe, the system comprising a shaft having first and second ends; a first shoulder secured to the first end of the shaft, the first shoulder being configured for insertion through an expandable hole in an upper portion of the shoe and configured to engage an inner surface of the upper portion of the shoe; a second shoulder secured to the second end of the shaft, the second shoulder being configured to engage the shoe; and a third shoulder adjacent to the second shoulder, the third shoulder comprising the decorative accessory.<br>
[0010] Another illustrative embodiment is a system for securing a decorative accessory to a shoe, the system comprising a shoe having an upper portion, the upper portion having an inner surface, an outer surface, and at least one stretchable hole; a shaft having first and second ends; a first shoulder secured to the first end of the shaft, the first shoulder being configured for insertion into the at least one stretchable hole in the upper portion of the shoe and to engage the inner surface of the upper portion of<br>
the shoe; a second shoulder secured to the second end of the shaft, the second shoulder being configured to engage the shoe; and a third shoulder adjacent to the second shoulder, the third shoulder comprising the decorative accessory. These and other embodiments are described in more detail herein.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0012] Referring now to the drawings, where like or similar elements are designated with identical reference numerals throughout the several views, and referring in particular to FIG. 2A, it illustrates a system 200 for attaching a decorative accessory 205 to clothing in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the invention. In the illustrative embodiment of FIG. 2A, system 200 attaches decorative accessory 205 to a molded shoe 100 through one of the expandable holes 105. Molded shoe 100 is shown in FIG. 2A for illustrative purposes only. In other embodiments, the shoe may be a type other than a molded shoe. In still other embodiments, system 200 can attach decorative accessory 205 to other articles of clothing, including, without limitation, belts, hats, and scarves with stretchable holes for insertion of a securing portion of<br>
system 200. For example, a belt or hat may be made of a foam material. A scarf may be knitted from a stretchable material such as yarn and have holes through which a securing portion of system 200 can be inserted.<br>
[0013] FIG. 2B illustrates a system 200 for attaching a decorative accessory 205 to clothing in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the invention. FIG. 2B shows a side view of system 200. In this illustrative embodiment, system 200 includes a shaft 210, a first shoulder 215 secured to one end of shaft 210, a second shoulder 220 secured to the opposite end of shaft 210, and a third shoulder 225 that is adjacent to second shoulder 220. For reasons that will become apparent, first shoulder 215 may be termed an "inner shoulder," and second and third shoulders (220 and 225) may be termed "outer shoulders."<br>
[0014] First shoulder 215 is configured for insertion through an expandable hole in an article of clothing (e.g., an expandable hole 105 in molded shoe 100). Since first shoulder 215 is larger than the expandable hole when the expandable hole is in its unexpanded state, first shoulder secures system 200 to the article of clothing. First shoulder 215 engages the inner surface of the clothing material (e.g., the inner surface of molded shoe 100). Since, when attached to molded shoe 100, first shoulder 215 is close to the wearer's foot, it is advantageous for first shoulder 215 to be a low-profile shoulder for greater comfort. In embodiments in which first shoulder 215 is removably secured to shaft 210, shaft 210 may be inserted into expandable hole 105, and first shoulder 215 may be placed on the inside of the article of clothing and secured to shaft 210.<br>
[0015] Second shoulder 220 engages the article of clothing (e.g., molded shoe 100), but how it engages the article of clothing varies depending on the embodiment, as will be explained more fully in connection with FIGS. 2C and 2D.<br>
[0016] In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2B, third shoulder 225 is flush mounted to second shoulder 220. Flush mounting can be accomplished in a variety of ways. In one embodiment, third shoulder 225 is glued to second shoulder 220. In some embodiments, decorative accessory 205 is separate from third shoulder 225 and is attached to third shoulder 225 by a suitable chemical (e.g., glue) or mechanical fastener. In other embodiments, decorative accessory 205 is fully or partially integrated (e.g., molded) with third shoulder 225. In some embodiments, third shoulder 225 and decorative accessory 205 are one and the same. For example, decorative accessory may be a design such as a "smiley face" that is stamped or embossed, optionally in relief, on the exposed surface of third shoulder 225.<br>
[0017] Shaft 210, first shoulder 215, second shoulder 220, and third shoulder 225 may vary in their lateral cross-sectional shape, depending on the embodiment. For example, in embodiments in which third shoulder 225 and decorative accessory 205 are one and the same, third shoulder 225 may be in the shape of a frog, butterfly, heart, or any other decorative shape. In one embodiment, shaft 210 and second shoulder 220 are cylindrical in shape, and first shoulder 215 is circular and concave in shape, the bottom of the "dish" facing away from the inner surface of the clothing material. FIGS, 2E and 2F are bottom views of first shoulder 215 illustrating alternative lateral cross-sectional shapes, in accordance with other illustrative embodiments of the invention. In FIGS. 2E and 2F, second shoulder 220 and third shoulder 225 have been omitted for clarity.<br><br>
[0018] In some embodiments, shaft 210, first shoulder 215, second shoulder 220, and third shoulder 225 (which may include decorative accessory 205) are all integrally formed as a single piece (e.g., they are molded from single piece of plastic). In other embodiments, either or both of first shoulder 215 and second shoulder 220 are removably secured to shaft 210. In some embodiments, third shoulder 225 is removably secured to second shoulder 220. In the embodiments having a removably-attached shoulder, the removable shoulder can be attached to shaft 210 by a snap fastener, adjustable barrel nut, bayonet fastener, or other suitable fastener.<br>
[0019] FIG. 2C shows system 200 after insertion of first shoulder 215 through an expandable hole in an article of clothing, in accordance with another illustrative embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, second shoulder 220 is configured to fit within expandable hole 105 in its unexpanded state, allowing third shoulder 225 to engage the outer surface of the article of clothing (e.g., the outer surface of upper 110 of molded shoe 100). The embodiment shown in FIG. 2C accommodates relatively thicker material and relatively larger-diameter expandable holes 105, such as might be found in an adult-model molded shoe 100. Since second shoulder 220 sits within expandable hole 105 in its unexpanded state, it provides additional lateral stability to system 200.<br>
[0020] In the illustrative embodiment shown in FIG. 2C, second shoulder 220 and third shoulder 225 are secured to each other by a pin 230. Third shoulder 225 is molded around a head portion 235 of pin 230, and second shoulder 220 is molded around a needle portion 240 of pin 230 that forms a pop rivet during manufacturing.<br><br>
(0021] FIG. 2D shows system 200 after insertion of first shoulder 215 through an expandable hole in an article of clothing, in accordance with yet another illustrative embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, second shoulder 220 is larger than expandable hole 105 in its unexpanded state. Consequently, second shoulder 220 engages the outer surface the article of clothing (e.g.. the outer surface of upper 110), acting as a spacer. The embodiment shown in FJG. 2D accommodates relatively thinner material and relatively smaller-diameter expandable holes 105, such as might be found in a child-model molded shoe 100. In the illustrative embodiment shown in FIG. 2D, second shoulder 225 is molded around a fourth shoulder 245 that extends from the top surface of second shoulder 220.<br>
[0022] The shoulders of system 200 can be made of any material, including plastic, metal, and rubber. Additionally, the shoulders can include an inner rigid portion, such as metal, and a softer outer portion, such as rubber, that provides increased comfort for the wearer. Further, shaft 210 can be made of any material, including plastic, metal, and rubber. The shaft 210 can include a rigid inner portion and a softer outer portion to provide the wearer with increased comfort.<br>
[0023] In embodiments other than those illustrated in FIGS. 2B-2D, system 200 may include only two shoulders (e.g., first shoulder 215 and second shoulder 220). In those embodiments, second shoulder 220 is analogous to third shoulder 225 in the embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 2B-2D. For example, decorative accessory 205 may be fully or partially integrated with second shoulder 220 in such two-shoulder designs.<br><br>
[0024] FIGS. 3-15C illustrate variations in the shape and size of the shoulders of a system for attaching a decorative accessory 205 to clothing and variations in how one or more shoulders of the system can be removably attached to shaft 210, in accordance with illustrative embodiments of the invention. In most of the embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 3-15C, only two shoulders are shown. A third shoulder can, of course, be added to those embodiments, if desired.<br>
[0025] FIG. 3 illustrates a system 300 for securing a decorative accessory 205 to a molded shoe 100 or other article of clothing, in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the invention. This embodiment includes two equally-sized shoulders 305 and 310 at either end of shaft 210. At least one shoulder (305 or 310) may be a low-profile shoulder.<br>
[0026] FIG. 4 illustrates a system 400 for securing a decorative accessory 205 to a molded shoe 100 or other article of clothing, in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the invention. In system 400, shoulders 410 and 415 are different in size. In this illustrative embodiment, the larger shoulder 415 is a low-profile shoulder and is positioned on the inside of the article of clothing (e.g., molded shoe 100). The smaller shoulder 410 is configured to engage the outer surface of the article of clothing or to fit within an expandable hole in its unexpanded state, as explained above.<br>
[0027] FIG. 5 illustrates a system 500 for securing a decorative accessory 205 to a molded shoe 100 or other article of clothing, in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the invention. System 500 includes a barrel nut, which may be made of metal or other suitable material. The barrel nut includes two equally-sized<br><br>
shoulders 505 and 510. One of the shoulders is part of the female portion of the barrel nut, and the other shoulder is part of the male portion of the barrel nut. The threaded barrel nut allows system 500 to be adjusted for different thicknesses of material. As illustrated in FIG. 5, one or both shoulders of system 500 may be rounded in shape (see shoulder 505) or other shapes. In FIG. 5, the two portions of the barrel nut are shown screwed together.<br>
[0028] FIG. 6 illustrates a system 600 for securing a decorative accessory 205 to a molded shoe 100 or other article of clothing, in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the invention. System 600 includes two unequally-sized shoulders 605 and 610, at least one of which is rounded and at least one of which is a low-profile shoulder.<br>
[0029] FIGS. 7 A and 7B illustrate a system 700 for securing a decorative accessory 205 to a molded shoe 100 or other article of clothing, in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the invention. System 700 includes a male portion 705 of a button snap (FIG. 7A) that includes one shoulder and shaft 210 and a matching female portion 710 of the button snap (FIG. 7B) that includes a second shoulder.<br>
[0030] FIGS. 8A-8D are schematics of a system 800 for securing a decorative accessory 205 to a molded shoe 100 or other article of clothing, in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the invention. System 800 includes a locking fastener that uses the compressibility of the clothing material (e.g., foam) itself as a spring. FIG. 8A illustrates, in cross section, a portion of system 800 that includes fixed shoulder 805 and shaft 210. The fixed shoulder 805 could, as the inner shoulder, include a low-profile shoulder to minimize a wearer's discomfort. Alternatively, the fixed<br><br>
shoulder 805 could, as an outer shoulder, be attached to the decorative accessory 205 or be integrated with decorative accessory 205.<br>
[0031] In this embodiment, the end 810 of shaft 210 opposite fixed shoulder 805 includes a rectangular flange 815. Rectangular flange 815 is configured to be inserted through a rectangular cutout in a mating receiver. When rectangular flange 815 is rotated (twisted) 90 degrees while the clothing material is slightly compressed, rectangular flange 815 engages a rectangular depression in the receiver. Releasing the pressure on the clothing material acts as a spring to lock flange 815 it into place and to establish the receiver as a second shoulder. FIG. 8B shows another side view of the portion of system 800 shown in FIG. 8A.<br>
[0032] FIG. 8C illustrates, in cross section, a receiver 820 of system 800. The receiver 820 is rounded to present a low-profile to the wearer's foot or other body part. FIG. 8D is a bottom view of receiver 820 that shows rectangular cutout 825 and rectangular depression 830.<br>
[0033] FIGS. 9A-9C illustrate a system 900 for securing a decorative accessory 205 to a molded shoe 100 or other article of clothing, in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the invention. System 900 includes lip rings 905 and 910 on shaft 210 (FIG. 9A) for engaging a removable shoulder 915 (FIG. 9B and 9C). Removable shoulder 915 can be slid onto shaft 210 and forced past one or both lip rings (905 and/or 910), providing adjustability for different thicknesses of clothing material. For example, the lower lip 905 can be used to secure system 900 to a thicker adult's molded shoe 100. The upper lip 910 can be used to secure system 900 to a thinner child's molded shoe 100.<br>
 [0034] FIG. 9C is a side view of removable shoulder 915 illustrating that removable shoulder 915 may have a rounded shape on the bottom and that removable shoulder 915 may include a circumferential ridge 920 (see dashed lines in FIG. 9C indicating hidden lines) along the inside of a hole in its center. Circumferential ridge 920 can be forcefully slid past one or both lip rings (905 and/or 910) to secure removable shoulder 915 in place.<br>
[0035] FIGS. 10A and 10B illustrate a system 1000 for securing a decorative accessory 205 to a molded shoe 100 or other article of clothing, in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the invention. Referring to FIG. 10A, system 1000 includes a single-tab-and-slot bayonet-type fastener. Shaft 210 with tab 1005 is inserted into hole 1007 and aligned with slot 1010 through sufficient compression of spring (e.g., piece of foam) 1015. Rotating shaft 210 to bring tab 1005 to the limit of slot 1010 and releasing the compression of spring 1015 locks the fastener into place. FIG. 10B shows system 1000 after the two portions of system 1000 have been fastened together.<br>
[0036] FIGS. 11A and 1 IB illustrate a system 1100 for securing a decorative accessory 205 to a molded shoe 100 or other article of clothing, in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the invention.
