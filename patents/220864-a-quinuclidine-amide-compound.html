				<td>NEW QUINUCLIDINE AMIDE DERIVATIVES<br>
This invention relates to new therapeutically useful quinuclidine amide derivatives, to some processes for their preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
The novel structures according to the invention are antimuscarinic agents with a potent and long lasting effect. In particular, these compounds show high affinity for M3 muscarinic receptors. This subtype of muscarinic receptor is present in glands and smooth muscle and mediates the excitatory effects of the parasympathetic system on glandular secretion and on the contraction of visceral smooth muscle (Chapter 6, Cholinergic Transmission, in HP. Rang etal., Pharmacology, Churchill Livingstone, New York , 1995).<br>
M3 antagonists are therefore known to be useful for treating diseases characterised by an increased parasympathetic tone, by excessive glandular secretion or by smooth muscle contraction (R.M. Eglen and S.S. Hegde, (1997), Drug News Perspect., 10(8):462-469).<br>
Examples of this kind of diseases are respiratory disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, bronchial hyperreactivity, asthma, cough and rhinitis; urological disorders such as urinary incontinence, pollakiuria, neurogenic or unstable bladder, cystospasm and chronic cystitis; gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, spastic colitis, diverticulitis and peptic ulceration; and cardiovascular disorders such as vagally induced sinus bradycardia (Chapter 7, Muscarinic Receptor Agonists and Antagonists, in Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 10th edition, McGraw Hill, New York, 2001).<br>
The compounds of the invention can be used alone or in association with other drugs commonly regarded as effective in the treatment of these diseases. For example, they can be administered in combination with p2-agonists, steroids, antiallergic drugs, phosphodiesterase IV inhibitors and/or leukotriene D4 (LTD4) antagonists for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in the treatment of a respiratory disease.<br>
The new quinuclidine amide derivatives of the invention have the chemical structure of formula (I):<br>

Pharmacological Action<br>
The results on human muscarinic receptors binding and in the test on bronchospasm in guinea pig, were obtained as described below.<br>
Human muscarinic receptor studies.<br>
The binding of [3H]-NMS to human muscarinic receptors was performed according to Waelbroeck et al (1990), Mol. Pharmacol., 38: 267-273. Assays were carried out at 25°C. Membrane preparations from stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells (CHO) expressing the genes for the human M3 muscarinic receptors were used.<br>
For determination of IC50, membrane preparations were suspended in DPBS to a final concentration of 89 ug/ml for the M3 subtype. The membrane suspension was incubated with the tritiated compound for 60 min. After incubation the membrane fraction was separated by filtration and the bound radioactivity determined. Non-specific binding was determined by addition of 10"4 M atropine. At least six concentrations were assayed in duplicate to generate individual displacement curves.<br>
Our results show that the compounds of the present invention have high affinities for M3 muscarinic receptors, preferably human muscarinic receptors. Thus, the IC5o of the preferred compounds of the invention is lower than 100 nM. Most preferred compounds, such as the compounds of examples 1, 3, 4, 8, 10, 11, 14, 19, 30 and 32 described below, have an IC50 lower than 60 nM.<br>
Test on bronchospasm in guinea pig<br>
The studies were performed according to H. Konzett and F. Rossler (1940), Arch. Exp. Path. Pharmacol. 195: 71-74. Aqueous solutions of the agents to be tested were nebulized and inhaled by anaesthetized ventilated male guinea pigs (Dunkin-Hartley). Bronchial response to intravenous acetylcholine challenge was determined before and<br><br>
after drug administration and the changes in pulmonary resistance at several time-points were expressed as percent of inhibition of bronchospasm.<br>
The compounds of the present invention inhibited the bronchospasm response to acetylcholine with high potency and a long duration of action.<br>
From the above described results one of ordinary skill in the art can readily understand that the compounds of the present invention have excellent M3 antimuscarinic activity and thus are useful for the treatment of diseases in which the M3 muscarinic receptor is implicated, including respiratory disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, bronchial hyperreactivity, asthma, cough and rhinitis; urological disorders such as urinary incontinence, pollakiuria, neurogenic or unstable bladder, cystospasm and chronic cystitis; gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, spastic colitis, diverticulitis and peptic ulceration; and cardiovascular disorders such as vagally induced sinus bradycardia.<br>
The present invention further provides a compound of formulae (I) or (II) or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a compound of formulae (I) or (II) for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body by therapy, in particular for the treatment of respiratory, urological or gastrointestinal disease or disorder.<br>
The present invention further provides the use of a compound of formulae (I) or (II) or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a compound of formulae (I) or (II) for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a respiratory, urological or gastrointestinal disease or disorder.<br>
Further, the compounds of formulae (I) or (II) and pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of formulae (I) or (II) can be used in a method of treating a respiratory, urological or gastrointestinal disease or disorder, which method comprises administering to a human or animal patient in need of such treatment an effective, non-toxic, amount of a compound of formulae (I) or (II) or a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formulae (I) or (II).<br>
Further, the compounds of formulae (I) or (II) and pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of formulae (I) or (II) can be used in combination with other drugs<br><br>
effective in the treatment of these diseases. For example with p2 agonists, steroids, antiallergic drugs, phosphodiesterase IV inhibitors and/or leukotriene D4 (LTD4) inhibitors, for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in the treatment of a respiratory disease.<br>
