				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a bio-active keratin-silica matrix for industrial applications. More particularly, the present invention relates to silica embedded keratin matrix exhibiting bioactivity. The invention further provides a process for the preparation of the said novel keratin-silica matrix. The product of the present invention is envisaged to have enormous potential application as filler-cum-binder in leather finishing industry to improve the aesthetics and protection characteristics of the finished leathers. Thus, the matrix provides an important bio-alternative to replace the conventional fillers and binders for leather finishing. The keratin-silica matrix could also be used as retanning agent in leather processing that will influence the uptake of subsequently applied auxiliaries such as dyestuffs and fatliquors. Besides, this matrix may also be used as exhaustive aid in chrome tanning process. In addition, this novel product could also be used in chromium free and pickle free leather tanning process.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Keratins belong to the family of fibrous structural proteins. It is essentially characterized by disulfide linkage that confers additional strength and rigidity by permanent, thermally-stable crosslinking. While this protein exhibits toughness and insolubility, several attempts have been made to hydrolyze it to ensure appropriate utilization of the protein, which is abundantly available in animal sources, for different industrial purposes. Blanchard, et al. (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,159,496, 6,274,163) have provided a method of oxidative cleavage of disulfide linkage for using the product in biomedical application. Cowsar (U.S. Pat. Application No. 20030228353) has provided a method of isolation of biologically active keratin peptides by breaking the<br>
disulfide linkage with oxidants followed by formulating composition for pharmaceutical or topical administration. All these disclosures relate to partial or complete cleavage of the disulfide linkage of keratin to utilize the resulting peptides for biomedical or pharmaceutical applications. The biological activity of these peptides may relate to cell growth activation or inhibition, healing activity of the damaged skin, to stimulate growth of fibroblasts useful for the treatment of damaged, aged or diseased epithelial tissue and skin. The major limitation of these products is that they are essentially insoluble keratin degradative substances, which do not find application in leather processing industry and other water based processing industries because of their insolubility in aqueous medium.<br>
This has prompted researchers to provide soluble products by way of hydrolyzing keratinous substances, whereby the resulting keratin hydrolysate finds wider industrial applications as reported by Karthikeyan et al (Journal of Scientific and Industrial Research, 66, 710, 2007).<br>
Several attempts have been made to prepare keratin hydrolysate by alkali hydrolysis method.<br>
Our earlier work (Indian Patent No. 180394) provided a process for hydrolyzing keratinous wastes by controlled alkali hydrolysis to get a soluble hydrolysate suitable for leather processing particularly in filling cum retanning and as an exhaustive aid in chrome tanning process in leather industry. Fleischner (U.S. Pat. No. 4,818,520) provided a method of alkaline hydrolysis of keratinous substances for cosmetic applications. However, the hydrolysate produced by alkali hydrolysis requires further<br>
treatment of neutralization to ensure that it is suitable for industrial applications, such as leather processing.<br>
Flork and Michel (US4874893), Kutsakova et.al (RU2289945) and Masakazu et.al (JP2134348) prepared keratin hydrolysate by acid hydrolysis method. But the product exhibits a pH in the range of 1.0-2.0. Hence, this product also requires neutralization to ensure that it can be used effectively.<br>
Savolainen (U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,307) provided a method of enzymatic hydrolysis of keratinous substances to produce keratin hydrolysate that requires further treatment for application in animal feed and cosmetic industries.<br>
Thus the major limitation associated with all these hitherto known hydrolysis methods is that the product requires further treatment for industrial application. Moreover, the products do not exhibit any antimicrobial property, thereby limiting the shelf life of the products to not more than 3-6 months. This limitation of these products eventually affects the economy of application adversely.<br>
Conventionally, silicates have been used for the preparation of various industrial products exhibiting antimicrobial property. Sugizaki et al (US 6544641) has provided a method for the preparation of silicate-containing sheet having antimicrobial and antifouling properties. Hidenobu et al (US 6592858) has provided a fibre structure with antifungal and antibacterial properties suitable for textiles, where the fibre structure comprising a zeolite layer and an alkyl silicate layer.<br>
Morin (GB 100163) obtained the first patent of silica tanning. Fernald and Her (US 2395472) provided a process for the production of acid soluble double silicates of an alkali metal and a metal for leather tanning. The use of silicates for the preservation hides and skins is reported by Munz (Journal of the American Leather Chemists Association, 102, 16, 2007). Alkali silicates also have been used to improve the exhaustion of added auxiliaries, especially of chrome tannins in leather processing as reported by Munz (Journal of the American Leather Chemists Association, 98, 159,2003).<br>
No prior art is available on any product comprising keratin and silica, embedded in the form of a matrix. The product obtained with all the hitherto known hydrolysis methods require further treatment for industrial applications especially in leather processing industry. Moreover, the products do not exhibit any antimicrobial property, thereby limiting the shelf-life of the product to not more than 3 to 6 months. Whereas, in the present invention, the keratin polypeptides are hydrolyzed with silica salt, thereby ensuring not only the antimicrobial property of the product, but also obtaining the product in the pH range of 7.5 to 9.0 without further neutralization with acid and enabling to store the product for longer periods of time upto more than 9 months.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is thus to provide a novel bioactive keratin-silica matrix, which obviates the limitations of the hitherto known prior art as detailed above.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to provide a hydrolysis process to obtain keratin-silica matrix at pH 7.5-9.0 without treatment with acid.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a bioactive keratinous product exhibiting antimicrobial property.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a product comprising keratin embedded with silica.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a process to hydrolyze keratinous substance with silica to provide keratin-silica matrix. Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a bioactive keratin-silica matrix exhibiting a neutral to slightly alkaline pH range.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a bioactive keratin-silica matrix, exhibiting a molecular weight not more than 6KDa.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a bioactive keratin-silica matrix, characterized in that it comprises bio- molecules such as peptides and amino acids embedded with silicate species, the said matrix having a molecular weight in the range of 2KDa - 6KDa and particle size in the range of 2000-5000nm and exhibiting pH in the range of 7.5-9.0.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
Keratinous material is treated with 75-150% w/v of known solvent for a period of 30-120 min and then dried at a temperature in the range of 35-70°C for a period of 60-300 min. The defatted keratinous material, thus obtained, is digested with 20-35% w/w of silica salt in the presence of 200-400%w/v of water at a pH in the range of 11.0-14.0. The temperature and pressure for the digestion are maintained in the range of 100-140°C and 15-35psi pressure respectively. The reaction is continued till the pH of the solution is in the range of 7.5-9.0 to obtain keratin-silica matrix in liquid form. The liquid is optionally subjected to drying at a temperature in the range of 110 -250 °C to obtain keratin-silica matrix in the powder form.<br>
The characteristic features of the keratin-silica matrix are presented below.<br>
The   keratin-silica   matrix   consists   of  biomolecules   (peptides   and   amino   acid<br>
composition) being embedded with silicate species through electrostatic interaction<br>
