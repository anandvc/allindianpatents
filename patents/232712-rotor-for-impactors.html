				<td>The present invention relates to rotor for impactors.<br>
The invention concerns a rotor for impactors comprising a plurality of cast steel rotor discs which are welded together at their widened touching hubs and featuring a widened outer rim which, compared with the hub is half as wide on both sides to provide the space necessary between adjacent outer rims to allow for insertion of a welding tool through to the hubs, and the outer rims of the rotor discs are interrupted by peripheral recesses in all rotor discs arranged in alignment with one another to form blow bar holders.<br>
Such a rotor is known from DE 41 02 692 C2, whereby DE 41 27 875 C2 shows a further embodiment of this rotor in respect of the welding together of the rotor discs at their hubs.<br>
As the first of the above documents in particular shows, the rotor is used in conjunction with blow bars which are pressed by wedges against supporting bodies and by means of ribs provided thereon together with corresponding grooves in the bars are thus secured against radial movement outwards resulting from centrifugal force. In this known rotor, the wedges are manipulated by hydraulic pressure elements and retained in the clamped position as described in DE 41 03 301 C2. Blow bar changing is effected by releasing the wedges and withdrawing or pushing the blow bars axially from their holders, or also by removing the wedges and removing the blow bars radially from out of the peripheral recesses, for which purpose the rotor has to be rotated into such a position that the blow bar to be removed lies flat on its back. To do this, however, it must be lifted over the supporting body ribs, which are also designated as blow bar holder. The fitting of a new or even a turned blow bar is effected in the reverse sequence.<br>
A rotor with hydraulic pressure elements is expensive and also susceptible to breakdown. Furthermore, the blow bars in the known rotor are not vertically removable, i.e. cannot be taken out from the top, since due to their extreme weight there are<br>
problems during removal of the wedges, also the pressure elements and the pressure line rails carrying them can be damaged.<br>
Mechanically manipulated pressure elements like those known, for example, from DE -GM 80 12 521 and DE - GM 85 20 900, cannot be used with rotors of the generic type, since the widened outer rims do not allow access for such parts, in particular tools required for the tightening or loosening of such parts. Sometimes, mechanical pressure elements and their screw spindles or similar need to be removed by flame cutting. Such lack of accessibility is valid in particular to small and medium-sized rotors where, for cost reasons, mechanical pressure elements and retaining pieces respectively are needed specifically for those sizes.<br>
The aim of the invention is to improve access to the gap between the neighbouring rotor discs of a rotor of the generic type and thus facilitate the use of mechanical pressure elements and retaining pieces in order to reduce fabrication and maintenance costs. This aim is achieved by tapering the sides of the partial sections of the outer rims formed circumferentially by the axis-parallel peripheral recesses in the direction opposite to the rotation direction of the rotor.<br>
By tapering the partial sections of the outer rims, adequate space is created between adjacent rotor discs to allow retaining pieces to be fitted by hand and to use conventional tools for their fitting and removal. For this, it is advantageous for the taper to first commence from a section of the outer rim with parallel sides, which should be of adequately strong design to withstand the forces exerted on the outer rims through the blow bars, whereby the subsequent taper is designed to gradually assume the thickness of the rotor disc as a support.<br>
The present invention relates to rotor for impactors comprising a plurality of steel cast rotor discs welded together at their widened hubs which touch one another and which feature a widened outer rim, said rim compared with the hub being half as narrow on both sides as is required as gap between adjacent outer rims for the insertion to of a welding tool to the hubs, and the outer rims of the rotor discs are interrupted by peripheral recesses arranged flush with one another in all rotor discs to form blow bar holders, characterized in that the partial sections of the outer rims thus formed are tapered circumferentially on both sides (arrow b) in the direction opposite to the rotation direction (arrow a).<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the outer contour of the rotor discs formed by the outer rims and beginning with the maximum diameter essentially forms a curve with reducing diameter in the direction opposite to the rotating direction of the rotor inwardly towards the rotor centre. This design improves still further the accessibility of retaining pieces or similar located deeper within the rotor. This curve and the inward routing of the rotor disc contour is executed according to the penetration depth into the rotor of the<br>
material to be processed, so that the impact surface of the following blow bar is fully utilised, but at the same time wear along this contour is avoided, because the outer face of the rotor casing lies in the shadow of the forerunning blow bar.<br>
To improve the durability, the invention further proposes that, to strengthen the rotor discs, thick web-like flanges are provided on the side surfaces of the rotor discs, running approximately radially from the partial sections of the outer discs through to the hubs, the height of the said flanges not protruding above the corresponding outer disc in the axial direction of the rotor.<br>
According to the invention, a particularly uncomplicated rotor is created in that the peripheral recesses are inclined inwardly, starting from the outer circumference of the rotor in the direction opposite to the rotation direction of the rotor and thus overlapped by the partial sections of the outer rims to form a support for the blow bars.<br>
The peripheral recesses advantageously feature at their front in the circumferential direction a further recess, one outwardly- orientated face of which runs parallel to and at a distance behind the sectional plane passing through the rotor axis, as well as a further, inner surface running approximately at rightangles to the outwardly-orientated face and serving as a base, and in which further recess is inserted a retaining piece, by means of which the blow bar in question is held against its corresponding support.<br>
Even if it is obvious that the peripheral recesses of the rotor discs are matched to the blow bars to be accommodated therein, it is of inventive significance that the peripheral recesses for the blow bars feature an alignment corresponding to the vertical axis of each blow bar, and that the vertical axis runs at an angle a between 8° and 20° -preferably 13° - to the outwardly-orientated face of the further recesses.<br>
Whereas known mechanical pressure elements are provided under the wedges within the rotor discs, the invention proposes that a flange be cast on both sides of the rotor discs underneath the further recess and approximately tangential to an imaginary rotor circle and/or parallel to the inner surface of the further recess, and that this flange is provided with a drilled hole which is in alignment with a hole drilled in the retaining<br>
piece, and that these drilled holes have a screw connection for securing the retaining piece to the rotor body. Since such a flange and such a screw connection are provided on each side of the particular rotor disc, the retaining piece is particularly secure. As screw connection, simple bolts, e.g. cheese-head bolts with nuts can be used, which are easily removable by flame cutting as necessary. Thanks to the space created by the invention between the rotor discs and in front of the blow bars, these screw connections are also accessible for power-operated screwdrivers. Even so, the screw connections are protected against wear by the corresponding forerunning blow bar or forerunning partial section of the outside rims.<br>
The design of the blow bar support according to the invention in respect of its vertical axis which inclines inwardly opposite to the rotation direction of the rotor and in conjunction with the retaining pieces arranged in front of the blow bars provides without any additional thrust forces a more than ample blow bar seating with no stress reversal, the advantage of this being that the contact surfaces of retaining pieces, blow bars and supporting bodies cannot move or become otherwise deformed.<br>
Should a retaining piece become jammed, the design according to the invention of the outwardly-orientated surface of the further recess is such that this surface is bevelled in the axial direction of the rotor, this bevel and that of the associated retaining piece featuring a self-locking angle of 5° to the axial direction which provides the facility of easily releasing the retaining piece by application of a hammer blow to the retaining piece in the widening direction of the bevel.<br>
In the drawing, the invention is illustrated as follows:<br>
Fig. 1 is a face view of a rotor for an impactor according to the<br>
invention<br>
Fig. 2 is a large-scale section of the rotor, and Fig. 3 is a side and part-section view of a rotor according to the<br>
invention corresponding to a line of intersection A - A in<br>
Fig. 1, half-side and half-side lateral view.<br>
The illustrated rotor 1 comprises a plurality of cast steel rotor discs 2 welded together at their widened hubs 3 which are touching each other. The rotor discs 2 feature a widened outer rim 4 which, compared with the hub 3 is half as wide on both sides as the distance necessary between adjacent outer rims 4 for the insertion of a welding tool to the hubs 3. In other words, the outer rims are spaced at a distance from each other.<br>
They are interrupted by peripheral recesses 5, Fig. 1, which extend into the rotor discs 2. The peripheral recesses of all rotor discs are in alignment with one another and form holders for blow bars 6, see Fig. 2. Through the peripheral recesses, the outer rims 4 are divided into partial sections 7, the sides of which are tapered circumferentially in the direction opposite to the rotation direction according to arrow a; Fig. 3 arrow b shows such a taper. However, the taper does not immediately commence at the particular peripheral recess, rather the sides 9 of the outer rims 4 run parallel initially, as a consequence of which design appropriate stability is provided to withstand the forces from the blow bars 6 acting on the outer rims 4, as shown in Fig. 3. The subsequent taper of partial sections 7 of the outer rims 4 is designed as a support, gradually assuming the thickness of the rotor disc, see Figs. 1 and 3.<br>
As Fig. 1 clearly shows, the outer contour of the rotor discs 2 starts with a maximum diameter and runs opposite to the rotation direction of the rotor to the next peripheral recess, essentially describing a reducing curve inwards towards the centre of the rotor.<br>
The peripheral recesses 5 are, as further shown in Fig. 1, inwardly inclined, starting from the outer circumference of the rotor 1 and running opposite to the rotation direction of the rotor arrow a and are overlapped by the partial sections 7 of the outer rims 4, so that they form a support for the blow bars 6.<br>
As further apparent from Fig. 1, each peripheral recess 5 features at its front in the circumferential direction a further recess 11 with one outwardly-orientated surface 12 running parallel to a sectional plane 13 passing vertically through rotor axis x and at a distance 14 behind the sectional plane in the circumferential direction. Arranged at approximate rightangles to this outwardly-orientated surface 12 is a further surface 15<br>
forming a base. In this further recess 11 thus designed is fitted a retaining piece 16, with which the inserted blow bar 6 is held against the corresponding support.<br>
The position of blow bars 6 in the peripheral recesses 5 is shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The peripheral recesses are provided in the direction of their bases with an alignment corresponding more or less with the alignment of the vertical axis 17 running through the blow bars, whereby the vertical axis is at an acute angle of some 8° to 20° -preferably 13 °- to the outwardly-orientated surface 12 and to the vertical sectional plane running parallel thereto through the rotor axis, with an alignment of the rotor according to Fig. 1.<br>
As this figure further shows, underneath each further recess 11 and running more or less at a tangent to an imaginary rotor circle and parallel to the inner face 15 of the further recess 11 is a cast-on flange 18 with drilled hole 19, which hole lines up flush with a drilled hole 20 in the retaining piece. Inserted into the drilled holes is a screw connection 21, by means of which the retaining piece is secured to the rotor body. Such a fixing device is provided on both sides of the rotor discs 2, see also Figs. 2 and 3.<br>
To facilitate the removal of the retaining pieces 16, the outwardly-orientated surface 12 of the further recess 11 is slanted in the axial direction of the rotor 1, whereby in connection with a correspondingly sloped face on the retaining pieces 16 a wedge effect is produced, which is less to serve the wedging of the blow bars than to simplify the removal of the retaining pieces, should these have become jammed, Fig. 2.<br>
As emerges from the description in conjunction with the drawing, this creates a rotor, the blow bars of which are securely held by simple and easy manipulation of the blow bar retaining means. In particular, easy access to these means is provided.<br><br><br>
