				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] 1. Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to a process for preparing intrinsically conducting 1, 4- polyisoprene (natural rubber) films from pre-vulcanised latex and fabrication of a photovoltaic device using the same.<br>
[0003] 2, Description of the Prior Art<br>
[0004] Electrically conducting rubbers from fresh latex of natural rubber as well as unvulcanised natural rubber are generally prepared by conducting a doping reaction using different doping agents such as iodine &amp; and SbCb using the two doping methods, viz gas phase doping and solution doping.<br>
[0005] Amongst the conventional processes for doping with iodine utilize the technique of adding specific amounts of iodine into a solution of fresh latex or into a solution of uncrosslinked NR solution in toluene, cyclohexane or the like. After the completion of the reactions, end solution is evaporated on suitable substrates to get conducting films. For gas phase reaction fresh NR latex or an uncrosslinked dry rubber is first made into films by evaporating the solvent followed by vacuum drying. In the second step the resulting films are kept in an evacuated chamber containing iodine vapour for specific time periods. However all such known in the art about the development of intrinsic electric conductivity in the 1, 4-polyisoprene are about unvulcanised rubber. A major disadvantage of fresh latex is its lack of enough mechanical strength and this limits its potential especially in thin film form. Another disadvantage of applying the known methods of preparing unvulcanised conducting film to pre-vulcanised latex is that on adding iodine solution in toluene for doping, the pre-vulcanised latex gets coagulated and the product will be lumps of swelled rubber pieces, which makes film preparation process impossible. Hence, with conventional solution process for producing electrically conducting NR films, it has proved difficult to obtain a NR based conducting film having good mechanical characteristics with high electrical condjuctivity.<br><br>
[0006] It is known that the photovoltaic materials based on organic semiconductors differ<br>
from, inorganic semiconductors in various aspects such as photo generated excitations<br>
(excitons) are strongly bound and do not spontaneously dissociate into separate charges;<br>
charge transport proceeds by hopping between localized states, rather than transport<br>
within a band.<br>
[0007] Recently it has been reported that in polymeric planar heterojunction or bilayer<br>
device the p-type conjugated polymer (donor) and n type conjugated polymer (acceptor)<br>
interface separates excitons much more efficiently than the organic metal interface in a<br>
single layer device.<br>
[0008] Polymer PVs are advantageous for the formation of a film having large area and<br>
reduction in cost since an organic layer can be easily formed by coating using a<br>
polymeric electro luminescent substance.<br>
[0009] Conventionally MEH-PPV is the most used semi conducting polymer for PV<br>
devices since they are soluble in common solvents and can be processed from solution at<br>
room temperature to uniform larger area, however the synthesis procedure is rather found<br>
to be tedious and not cost effective.<br>
[0010] The object of the present invention is to develop iodine doped pre-vulcanized<br>
natuj'al rubber as a novel p- type conjugated polymer and use it to fabricate polymer<br>
photovoltaic cell (Py) with n-type conjugated polymer.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF T^E UNVf NTIpN<br>
[0011] The objept of the present invention is to develop mechanically stronger and intrinsically conducting flexible films of cis 1,4-polyisoprene by solution processing and fabricate a photovoltaic (PV) device using the same.<br>
[0012] According to this invention there is provided a process in which, the fresh latex taken in a rotating vessel system is first prevulcanized by gamma (^^C, 7.38 x 10^"^ Bq) radiation source at a rotating speed of lO-rev min'^ at a temperature of 25^^C. The dose rate is 0.565-kpy h' (total dose = 12). 2-ethy]hexylacrylate and CCU are used as the sensitizers. The pre-vulpanized latex having various DRC of 50, 53.8 and 55 % are stabilized by adding sterric stabilizers such as starch or Do-decylbenzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) ranging frpm 2 % weight/weight (w/w) to 15 % weight/weight (w/w) of latex that sterically prevents the latex particles from coagulation followed by the addition of iodine solution in toluene or cyclqhexane at two different [C= C]/[l2] molar ratios of 8 and 12 at different reaction temperatures of 20^ C or 50^ C under nitrogen atmosphere. Thin film of the 4oped solution are casted on the ITO coated glass substrate by spin coating and dried under vacuum. A thin film of C 6o is spin coated on it. A metallic electrode of Indiurq (Ip) or Aluminium (Al) is then deposited on the top of C6o film through vacuum eyapofation technique.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERI^ED EM^pIjJ^ENTS<br>
[0013] As follows is ^ more detailed description of the present invention<br>
[0014] In this descriptipn, the term "pre-vulcanization" refers to the partial cross linking<br>
of the latex prior to any chemical treatment and this is achieved by exposing the fresh<br>
latex to gamma irradiation under the conditions described above. This latex can ensure<br>
eno^gh mechanical strength to the fabricated latex fi^ms.<br>
[0015]   A number of methods such as sulfur vujcanizatjon, pej-pxide vulcanization,<br>
chemical grafting, gajttima-irradiation etc are well known for cfiefpical modification of<br>
NR latex. In the pif^Sgnt invention the process of gamma irra^i^tjon is selected for pre-<br>
vulcanization since it 4oes not irjvolve any chemical ingredients, which may adyprsely<br>
affect the doping re^ption.<br>
[0016] Sterric S^iU?:ers<br><br>
[0017] The sterric stabilisers starch or DBSA is used to stabihze the latex from coagulation on addition of any foreign materials to the latex solution and here iodine-toluene or iodine - cyclohexane solution are the foreign materials. The adsorption of the stabiliser molecule to the rubber moieties is in fact the probable mechanism for the stabilization of the latex.<br>
[0018] In the present invention the doping reaction was carried out for each different quantity of stabilizer (between 2-15 % weight/weight of latex)<br>
[0019] Starch and DBSA are particularly selected as stabilizer for the reason that the stabilizer should be capable of providing latex the required stability and also it should not cause any coloration for the latex.<br>
[0020] There are no restrictions on the methods used to add the stabilizer, and typically used methods include addition of the stabilizer directly while stirring or adding the stabilizer as a water based solution.<br>
[0021] In the present invention adding sterric stabilizer enables the initial stabilization of the latex and the electrical stability of the product polymer. The stabilizer has a retarding function in the doping rate and the decreased doping rate enables the effective control of the electrical conductivity of the product polymer.<br>
[0022] Methods for measuring the molar ratio of C=C double bonds of Polyisoprene in the reaction medium are well known. The molar ratio is calculated using the basic equation [€<: weight of latex taken in g x></:>
68 [0023] With the mixture undergoing constant stirring, a pre-determined quantity of a predetermined doping agent (iodine at 0.00623 g/ml) in a pre-determined solvent (toluene or cyclohexane) was added and the doping reaction was allowed to proceed. The molar ratio of iodine is calculated from the equation [I2] == weight of iodine taken in ^ml x 1000<br>
258 [0024] Here the [C=C] /[I2] is calculated to be 8. After 24 h, part of the solution was casted on glass substrates and dried under dynamic vacuum (10"^ torr). Rest of the doped solution was coated at subsequent time intervals of 24 h each up to 240 h.<br><br>
[0025] Using the same method, the doping reaction was carried out for different concentrations of iodine ( 0.0046 g/ml)<br>
[0026] The decrease in iodine concentration results in an increase in the ratio [C=C] /[I2] to 12 resuhing in lower doping rate as inferred from the color changes. [0027] There are no particular restrictions on the doping time of the system and typical time values are from 24 h to 240 h. [002 §] Polymerization Conditions ,   [0029] In a production process of the present invention, the reaction temperature is varied in the range of 20" 50 V. [0030] Other Conditions<br>
[0031] In a production process of the present invention, the reaction was carried out with latex of ditferent dry rubber content (DRC) of 50, 53.8 and 55%.<br>
[0032] Next, the polymer fabrication of PV cell of the present invention v^ll be illustrated. The polymer PV of the present invention is a polymer PV comprising of a pair of electrodes composed of an anode and a cathode and at least one of which is transparent or semitransparent with the p-type and n-type polymers sandwiched between the electrodes.<br>
[0033] As the film is formed from a solution, coating methods such as a spin coating method, solution casting method and dip coating method can be used. [OO34] The method for forming the electron-transporting layer is not particularly restricted, and in this case, a method of film-forming from a solution is employed. [0035] The thickness of the electron-transporting layer is, for example, from 1 nm to 1 )i.m, preferably from 2 nm to 500 nm, further preferably from 5 nm to 200 nm. [0036] The substrate forming the polymer PV of the present invention may preferably be that does not change in forming an electrode and layers of organic materials, and there are exemplified glass, plastics, polymer film, silicon substrates and the like. In the present invention, it is preferable that an anode is transparent or semitransparent, and as the materia of this anode, electron conductive metal oxide films, semitransparent metal thin films and the like are used. Specifically, there are used indium oxide, zinc oxide, tin<br><br>
oxide, and films (NESA and the like) fabricated by using an electron conductive glass composed of indium tin oxide (ITO), indium' zinc oxide and the like, which are metal oxide complexes, and gold, platinum, silver, copper and the like are used, and among them, ITO, indium- zinc -oxide, tin oxide are preferable.<br>
[0037] The thickness of the anode can be appropriately selected while considering transmission of a light and electrical conductivity, and for example, from 10 nm to 10 |i.m, preferably from 20 nm to 1 |a.m, further preferably from 50 nm to 500 nm. [0038] As the material of a cathode used in the polymer PV of the present invention, that having lower work ftmction is preferable. For example, there are used metals such as lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, aluminum, scandium, vanadium, zinc, yttrium, indium, cerium, samarium, europium, terbium, ytterbium and the like, or alloys comprising two of more of them, or alloys comprising one or more of them with one or more of gold, silver, platinum, copper, manganese, titanium, cobalt, nickel, tungsten and tin, graphite or grapl^ite intercalation compounds and the like. Examples of alloys include a magnesium-silver alloy, magnesium-indium alloy, magnesium-aluminum alloy, indium-silver alloy, lithium-aluminum alloy, lithium-magnesium alloy, lithium-indium alloy, calcium-aluminum alloy and the like. The cathode may be formed into a laminated structure of two or more layers. The thickness of the cathode can be appropriately selected while considering transmission of a light and electric conductivity, and for example, from 10 nm to 10 ji.m, preferably from 20 nm to 1 ^i.m, further preferably from 50 nm to 500 nm. [0039] As the method for fabricating a cathode, there are used a vacuum vapor deposition methpd is used.<br>

Thin film of the doped solution is casted on the ITO coated glass substrate by spin coatipg technique and are dried under vacuum. The metallic electrode Indium (In) is then deposited on the top of Ceo film through vacuum evaporation technique.<br><br><br><br>
We Claim<br>
1.	A process of producing intrinsically conducting 1,4 polyisoprene (natural rubber) films<br>
by solution doping process, from natural rubber latex prevulcanized by gamma<br>
irradiation, said process comprising prevulcnized cis 1,4 polyisoprene latex stabilized by<br>
adding sterric satabilizers, wherein the said sterric stabilizers being starch or Do-<br>
decylbenzene sulfonic acid (DBSA), doping the said stabilized latex by adding dopants,<br>
said dopant being iodine, said solvents for dopants being toluene or cyclohexane, stirring<br>
the solution under nitrogen atmosphere at a temperatures 20^C or 50^^C, keeping the<br>
solution occasionally stirred and spin coating the said solution on to glass substrate at<br>
time intervals of 24, to 240 hrs, and drying under dynamic vacuum of 10'^ Torr, to obtain<br>
thin films.<br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the said step of iodine doping reaction consists of adding iodine - cyclohexane or iodine- toluene solution at a molar ratio, [C = C]/[l2]-8&amp;12.<br>
3.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the DRC of prevulcanized rubber latex is from 53 to 55 %.<br>
4.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the steps of stabilization consists in adding to<br>
the prevulcanized latex, 2, 5, 10, and 15 weight % of starch or 2, 5, 10 and 15 weight %<br>
of DBSA.<br>
5.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the step of doping reaction consists in stirring the reaction mixture of stabilized, prevulcanized 1,4 polyisoprene latex at temperatures 20^C or  50^C for a period of 24 to 240 hours..<br>
6.	A process for the fabrication of a polymer photovoltaic device, wherein a thin film of intrinsically conducting pre-vulcanised natural rubber latex solution is spin coated on to an Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate, followed by spin coating a thin film of Ceo on the top of it and finally a third layer of Aluminium (Al) or Indium (In) deposited above it by vacuum evaporation method.<br><br></synthesis></td>
