CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/779,289, filed March 3, 2006, and U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/827,556, filed September 29, 2006, which are both incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
L Technical Field<br>
[0002|    This invention relates generally to sleeves for covering bundles of wires and<br>
more particularly to low profile textile sleeves.<br>
2. Related Art<br>
[0003| Electrical wires are often bundled together in a round bundle and protected by a tubular sleeve. Sometimes the round bundle causes difficulties in that the package size is too bulky. For example, when wires are to be routed under carpeting in a vehicle or flush along a surface, the round profile presents a problem and often requires alternative routing options to be considered.<br>
[0004] Some sleeve products offer a flatter profile which enables the wires to be bundled fiat, but often these types of sleeves are generally rigid (e.g., molded plastics material) and are not easily routed when bends and tums in the path are necessary. When using these products, alternative routing options may need to be considered. [0005] A sleeve according to the present invention overcomes or greatly minimizes the foregoing limitations of the prior art described above.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] According to one presently preferred aspect of the invention, a low profile fold protective textile sleeve for use in fiat bundling of a plurality of wires comprises longitudinally and laterally interlaced monofilament warp and fill yams that are heat-set to a generally flat fold configuration. In one presently preferred embodiment, fiat profile monofilaments are employed in the warp direction and round monofilaments in the fill direction, also referred to synonymously as the weft direction.   The flat<br>
 <br>
monotnamenis proviae me sleeve wnn nexiDUity ana Denaing out oi me plane oi uie sleeve to assist in routing tlie bundle of wires around corners and along contoured surfaces. The flat monofilaments also provide the sleeve with a low profile, as the yams are considerably wider than they are thick. The round monofilaments may be sized so that their diameter is about the same as the thickness of the flat monofilaments. Accordingly, the round monofilaments can be grouped or bundled together so that the effective width of each bundle approximates the width of the flat monofilament yariis with which they are intertwined. The round monofilaments are heat-set along at least a portion of their length to provide biased living hinge regions of the sleeve, while also lending strength and sfiffness to the sleeve along the fill direction.<br>
[0007] One presently preferred sleeve configuration includes a base section and at least two folding secfions extending from laterally opposite sides of the base section. The folding sections are joined to the base section by respective living hinge regions adjacent the opposite sides, enabling the folding sections to fold inwardly toward one another into overlying relation to one another and to the base section. As mentioned, the hinge regions are fonned by a heat-set region of the bundles of fill yarns. The interlaced warp and fill yams provide a generally open structure to the sleeve to permit the passage of moisture.<br>
(0008J According to another aspect of the invention, the hinge regions of the sleeve can be reinforced by interlacing stiffening yams therein. The stiffening yams are different than those of the warp and fill yams, and caji be provided as muhifilament yam. The stiffening yams provide a generally closed structure in the hinge regions as opposed to the generally open structure of the base and folding sections. Accordingly, the reinforced hinge regions provide stnictural integrity and body to the to overall construction of the sleeve, and particularly to the hinge regions to facilitate biasing the two folding sections toward the folded positions overlying the base secfion.<br>
[0009] As such, the sleeve is useful for taking a bundle of wires and maintaining them in a low profile generally fiat bundle configuration for routing the wires in areas where there are space constraints or where a generally flat bundle is preferred. The choice of materials and sizes of materials for the warp and fill monofilaments and the interlacing of the stiffening yams at the hinge regions presents a sleeve that is itself<br>
 <br>
generally !ow in profile, yet able to apply sufficient closing force on a wire bundle to urge and support the bundle in a flat configuration.<br>
[0010] The combination of the monotllament fill and warp yams yields a sleeve that has an open structure of interstices so that moisture is free to escape through the sleeve. The stiffening yarns may be provided as multifilament yam that can be intertwined or woven to stiffen the hinge regions and to make them generally solid reinforced living hinges. The folding portions may be dimensioned such that when in the folded condition, the free ends of the folding portions overlap one another. In one embodiment, one of the folding portions is wider than the other, wherein the shorter folding portion serves as a relatively rigid flap beneath which the free end of the wider folding portion is tucked to facilitate retention of the sleeve in the closed condition once arranged about the wire bundle or bundles.<br>
[0011] The flat fold construction may be one which results in either a true fold flat sleeve where the folding portions rest on or slightly spaced from the base section, or may be somewhat box-shaped where the folding portions are spaced sufficiently from the base section when in the folded condition to accommodate a larger bundle of . wires. This latter box shaped constrtiction is well suited for flat bundling a bunch or a plurality of bunches of round electrical wires while maintaining rigidity along the length of the sleeve such that it does not sag or bow along its length under the weight of the wires. Accordingly, in accordance with another aspect of the invention, the degree of box shape of the sleeve can be controlled by the intertwined stiffening yarns, with a wider course of the yams yielding a wider effective hinge region forming essentially closed sides of the box structure.<br>
[0012J In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, the degree of box shape can be controlled while heat setting the weft monofilaments in the hinge region. Rather than fonning a single hinge at the opposite sides of the sleeve, a pair of hinges can be heat set on each side of the sleeve, thereby providing the sleeve with opposite sidewalls of the desired height.<br>
(0013) In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, the sleeves can be constructed by interlacing multifilament warp yams with the fill monofilaments, such that the multifilaments extend along the length of the sleeve in the base portion and/or folding portions. The multifilaments act to maintain the fill monofilaments in their intended   location   relative   to   the   warp   monofilaments.      As   such,   the   warp<br>
 <br>
multifilaments can be laterally spaced and unifonnly distributed about the circumference of the sleeve to maintain unifonn interstices or openings between the interlaced waip and fill monofilaments.<br>
[0014] The choice of materials for the yams may be of a number of materials and combinations of materials may be employed, including those that are fire rated. The choice of materials may be governed in part by the conditions in which the sleeve will operate, and considerations such as temperature rating, flammability, wear resistance, noise, EMI may be taken into account when selecting the material.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
|0027] RefeiTing in more detail to the drawings. Figures 1-2 show a low profile protective textile sleeve for use in bundling a plurality of wires generally at 10. The sleeve 10 includes a plurality of longitudinally extending monofdament warp yams 12 and a plurality of latitudinally extending weft or fill monofilament yams 14. The yarns 12, 14 are inteitwined with one another and heat-set to form a generally flat fold configuration of the sleeve 10. The intertwined yams 12, 14 yield an open structure of the sleeve 10. The yams 12, 14 may be intertwined through weaving, such as on a narrow fabric needle loom or broadloom, for example, or warp knitting (for example, Raschel or Crochet). The openings or interstices are identified at 15 in the drawings and provide open spaces through which moisture can pass so as to minimize any buildup of moisture against the wire bundle in the sleeve 10, while also lending to a reduced weight sleeve structure.<br>
[0028] The sleeve 10 includes a base portion or section 16 and at least two folding portions or sections 18, 20. The folding sections 18, 20 extend fi^om opposite lateral sides of the base section 16 and are joined to the base section 16 by living hinge regions 22, 24 adjacent the lateral sides. The living hinge regions 22, 24 enable the folding sections 18, 20 to fold inwardly toward one another into overlying relation to the base section 16 to yield the generally fiat fold condition of the sleeve 10, while also allowing the folding sections IS, 20 to be biased under an applied force outwardly for insertion or removal of the wire bundle.<br>
[0029] The hinge regions 22, 24 are formed by heat-set regions of the fill yams 14 and, when in the relaxed state, the hinge regions 22, 24 urge the sleeve 10 toward the folded condition. Opening the sleeve 10 by spreading the folding sections 18. 20 back is met with resistance of the heat-set hinge regions 22, 24 which counteract to force the sleeve 10 closed when the force is removed.   The hinge regions 22, 24, such as<br>
 <br>
best shown in Figure 4, may be reinforced with stiffening yams 26 which are intertwined tightly in the warp direction with the fill yarns 14 in the region of the hinges 22, 24.   The stiffening yams 26 add structural integrity to the hinge regions and assist the heat-set yarns 14 in exerting a strong closing force on the folding sections 18, 20 to flatten and support the wire bundle within the sleeve 10. (0030]    The folding sections 18, 20 may be of different width, with the section 18, by way of example and without limitations, being wider than that of the section 20. As best shown in Figure 1, the free end of the wider section 18 may be tucked under the free edge of the shorter, and thus stiffer, section 20 to help retain the folding sections 18, 20 in the closed condition when in use.   The stiffening yams 26 are preferably multifilament and may be woven in a 2/2 pointed broken twill pattern, for example.   The monofilaments 12, 14 may be woven in a plain weave pattern with a dual fill insertion of the fill yams 14, also by way of example and without limitation. [0031]    The types and sizes of inaterials for the warp 12 and weft 14 monofilaments and the interlacing of the stiffening yams 26 in the hinge regions 22, 24 presents the sleeve 10 with a generally low profile while providing sufficient closing force on a wire bundle to help urge and maintain the bundle in a flat configuration.   The warp yams 12 may be fiat profile monofilaments. This helps keep the sleeve 10 flexible for bending out of the plane of the sleeve 10 to assist in routing the bundle of wires around comers and along contoured surfaces. The flat monofilaments 12 also lend to a low profile, as the yams are preferably considerably wider than they are thick.  The fiat monofilaments 12 may have a width ranging from about 0.02 to 0.059 inches and a thickness ranging from about 0.004 to 0.059 inches, though these dimensions could be varied dependent upon the application.   In the illustrated embodiment shown in Figures 1-4, the flat monofilaments 12 have a width of about 0.01 inches and a thickness of about 0.04 inches.<br>
[00321 The yams used for the fill 14 may be round monofilaments. As best shown in Figure 3, these may be sized relative to the flat monofilament yams 12 so that the diameter of the round monofilaments 14 is about the same as the thickness of the flat monofilaments 12. For example, the round monofilaments 14 may have a diameter ranging from about 0.006 to 0.050 inches, and in the illustrated embodiment, the round filaments 14 have a diameter of about 0.01. The round monofilaments 14 may be grouped together (via dual insertion) so that the effective width Wl of a group or<br>
 <br>
bundle of the round filament yams 14 approximates the width W2 of the flat monofilament yams 12 with which they are intertwined. In the illustrate example, the round monofilaments 14 are presented in groups of three, which approximates the width W2 of the flat monofilaments 12, and yields the open structure of the sleeve 10. While the flat nature«of the monofilaments 12 provides the sleeve 10 with flexibility for bending and routing out of its plane in installation, the round monofilaments 14 are better able to be heat-set to add strength and integrity to the living hinge regions 22, 24 so that the sleeve 10 applies a strong closing force on the wire bundle when place in the sleeve 10 to urge and maintain the wires in a tlat bundled configuration. The heat-set round monofilaments 14 further cooperate with the stiffening yarns 26 to enhance the closing force on the folding portions ] 8, 20.<br>
[0033] The fiat or low profile fold construction may be one which results in either a tme fold flat sleeve where the folding sections 18, 20 rest on the base section 16, or may be somewhat box-shaped where the folding sections are spaced from the base section when in the folded condition. This latter box construction, as discussed in relation to another presently preferred embodiment hereafter, is well suited for fiat bundling a bunch or bunches of round electrical wires as the open center of the sleeve fomis, in effect, a low profile rectangular conduit or jacket in which the wires can be accommodated. The degree of box-shape can be controlled by the intertwined stiffening yams 26, with a wider course of the yams yielding a wider effective hinge region forming essentially closed sides of the box structure of the sleeve 10. The degree of box-shape can also be controlled via the heat-set configuration of the weft monofilaments 14 in the hinge regions 22, 24. The sleeve 10 may be initially processed flat, and then it can be formed with the assistance of heat and pressure to the flat fold (truly flat or box-shaped 3D) profile.<br>
|00341 The choice of materials for the monofilament and multifilament yams 12, 14 may be selected from any of a number of materials, and combinations of materials may be employed, including those that are fire rated. The choice of materials may be governed in part by the conditions in which the sleeve 10 will operate, and considerations such as temperature rating, flammability, wear resistance, noise, EMI may be taken into account when selecting the material. Material choices for the flat and round monofilaments 12, 14 include, but arc no limited to: PET, Nylon, PPS, PEEK, PP, PE, PFA, bi-component, and fire-retardant (FR) versions of PET, Nylon.<br>
 <br>
The multifilament stiffening yams 26 may be made from other materials as well, including, but not limited to: PET, Nylon, PPS, PP, PE, PTFE, Panox, Nomex, Kevlar, and other meta-Aramids, fiberglass, and silica.<br>
[0035] Figures 5 and 6 illustrate a low profile textile sleeve constructed according to another presently preferred embodiment of the invention generally at 110. The sleeve 110 is constructed similarly as disclosed above, and thus, reference numbers offset by 100 are used to identify like features. The sleeve 110 has taller hinge regions 122, 124 than shown in the previous embodiment, thereby providing the sleeve 110 with a generally rectangular boxed-shape in lateral cross-section. Each of the hinge regions 122, 124 is fonned by a pair of heat-set folds 32, 34 at opposite sides of sidewalls 36, 38 forming the box-shaped sleeve. It should be recognized that the sides 36, 38 can be formed having a height as desired for the intended application. Accordingly, the sleeve 110 has an increased height from that of the flat fold embodiment, and thus, is able to accommodate increased diameter wire bundles. [0036] In addition to having generally flat warp monofilaments 112 as in the previous embodiment, the sleeve 110 has multifilament warp yams 30 interlaced with and generally perpendicular to the weft monofilaments 114 along the length of the sleeve 10. The multifilament yams 30 provide stability and a source of friction on the weft monofilaments 114, and thus, act to maintain the weft monofilaments 114 in their intended location relative to the warp monofilaments 112. Accordingly, the interlaced filaments of the sleeve 110 maintain their spacing relative to one another, thereby maintaining unifonn openings or interstices between the respective yams in use.<br>
[0037] Each of the multifilament warp yams 30 can comprise dual multifilament yams (Figure 8), although single multifilament yams 30 can be used. The warp yams 30 are can be evenly spaced relative to one another across the width of the base section 116 and the folding sections 118, 120. though they could be spaced otherwise, if desired. It is preferred to space the multifilaments 30 laterally about 5mm to 20mm in generally parallel relation from one another, generally corresponding to about a 4-8 warp spacing, and shown here, by way of example and without limitations, as a 6 warp spacing. Accordingly, a pair of multifilament yams 30 extending along the warp direction are present every 6 warp monofilaments 112 unifonnly about the circumference of the sleeve 110.<br>
 <br>
[0038] Sleeves 210, 310 constructed in accordance with additional aspects of the invention are illustrated in Figures 9 and 10, respectively. The sleeve 210 is constructed similarly to the sleeve 10, however, the multifilament warp yams 26 from the sleeve 10 are not introduced into the hinge regions 222, 224 the sleeve 210. Accordingly, other than the missing multifilament warp stiffening yams 26, the sleeve 210 is the same as the sleeve 10. The sleeve 310 is constructed similarly to the sleeve 110, however, the muhifilament warp yams 30 from the sleeve 110 are not incorporated in the sleeve 310. Accordingly, other than the lacking the multifilament warp yams 30, the sleeve 310 is the same as the sleeve 110.<br>
[0039] In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the watp monofilaments of the sleeves 10, 110, 210, 310 can be provided as generally square or otherwise shaped hollow round monofilaments 40 initially, and thereafter flattened (Figure 11), such as through controlled application of heat and/or pressure. As such, the respective sleeve 10, 110, 210, 310 can be constructed, and during a heat-setting process used to form the heat-set living hinge sections, the hollow monofilaments 40 can also be heated and flattened. The hollow monofilaments 40 inJierently retain air pockets 42 to provide enhanced insulation properties to the sleeves. [0040] The sleeves 10, 110, 210, 310 constructed in accordance with the invention are not limited to the use of flat waip monofilaments 12, 112, 212, 312 and round weft monofilaments 14, 114, 214, 314. Both warp and weft yarns could be round, or both flat, but the illustrated embodiments are presently preferred.
