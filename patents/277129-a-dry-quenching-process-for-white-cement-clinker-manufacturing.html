A DRY QUENCHING PROCESS FOR WHITE CEMENT CLINKER MANUFACTURING<br>
GRASIM INDUSTRIES LIMITED.<br>
an Indian Company<br>
of Birlagram, Nagda - 456331,<br>
Madhya Pradesh, India.<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
 <br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for manufacturing white cement.<br>
Particularly, the present invention relates to a dry quenching process for manufacturing white cement clinker.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The conventional manufacturing process for white cement, as shown in Figure 1, involves crushing of the raw materials primarily comprising a mixture of limestone (or calcareous material) and clay, typically kaolin (or argillaceous material) in a crusher. The crushed mixture is further sent to a raw mill for grinding. The fine mixture primarily containing limestone and kaolin is then calcined at a temperature of 1500 - 1550 deg C in a rotary kiln to chemically fuse the raw materials and produce a white cement clinker. The resulting white cement clinker thus formed in the rotary kiln is to be quenched with water to prevent the re-oxidation of the iron and thus maintain the whiteness of the cement clinker. The quenching process is done by passing the cement clinker through a quencher or a decoloriser/dryer , as shown in Figure 1, wherein in a reduced atmosphere the clinker temperature is rapidly lowered from 1200 deg C to below 600 deg C.<br>
Conventionally, a wet quenching process, as disclosed in Figure 1 &amp; 2, is used which involves dropping the hot cement clinker in cold water. Referring to Figure 2 of the accompanying drawings, red hot clinker from the rotary kiln having a temperature of above 1200 deg C are discharged in a decoloriser/quencher where water is added for quenching. During wet quenching by water, clinker is dried by super heated steam, dry white<br>
 <br>
cement clinker having temperature below 200 deg C is formed and super heated steam along with flue gases and clinker dust is discharged. The super heated steam thus discharged has a temperature between 200 - 400 deg C and is laden with dust and gases. The exhaust gas stream comprising 55% steam and 45% air is passed through cyclone separators then through an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) or bag house to remove the dust particles and then released into the atmosphere. The temperature of the exhaust gas stream leaving the cyclone separator is in the range of 160 - 220 deg C. Referring to Figure 1, the white cement clinker from the decoloriser/dryer, after a drying stage, is ground to cement.<br>
The water used in the conventional wet quenching process for cooling the red hot white cement clinker, as disclosed in Figure 1, exchanges heat with the white cement clinker and is converted into steam having very high temperatures. This steam is eliminated along with the exhaust gases into the atmosphere through ESP/ bag House. The cement manufacturing process is already very energy-sensitive, in the conventional process large quantity of energy is lost as the thermal energy contained in the steam is discharged into the atmosphere unused. Also, large quantity of water is used in the wet quenching process, where water conservation in industries is becoming a very crucial issue.<br>
In the conventional process, as disclosed in Figure 1, dust particles and exhaust gases are emitted from the grinding, calcining, quenching and drying processes. These exhaust gases contain substantial quantity of dust particles which have detrimental heath and environmental impacts. The dust particles are to be removed by a cyclone separator and the gas stream must<br>
 <br>
be further passed through an electrostatic precipitator /Bag House to remove the particulate matter before discharging into the atmosphere to comply by the pollution board discharge standards.<br>
Unlike the Portland Grey cement, the production of white cement clinker requires special care during quenching process, for avoiding any deterioration of the degree of the whiteness of the cement. As evidenced from the prior art, the quenching process involved in the production of white cement clinker generally comprises of using the water stream for rapidly lowering down the temperature of cement clinker from 1200 °C-1400 °C to approximately 600 °C, in a few seconds as it leaves the kiln. The conventional wet quenching processes as disclosed in Figure 1 suffers from number of drawbacks which include high particulate matter, wastage of energy and high usage of water.<br>
The dry cooling method for hot bulk materials is also one of the most widely used methods. The dry cooling method comprises of cooling the hot bulk materials with a stream of inert gas/gases in a closed circuit. However, most of the studies available on the dry cooling of hot bulk materials are related to coke. In comparison to the wet cooling processes, the dry cooling of the hot bulk materials provides substantial advantages to the environment and better recovery of energy.<br>
Therefore, there is felt a need for the development of white cement manufacturing process that overcomes the drawbacks of conventional process.<br>
 <br>

 <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which do not limit the scope and ambit of the invention. The description provided is purely by way of example and illustration.<br>
In comparison to the ordinary grey Portland cement, the production of white cement is extremely complex and far more expensive because of lower product out put and more energy demand. The decisive factor for the whiteness of the cement is the cement clinker cooling/quenching process. Among commercially utilized methods for cooling of hot bulk materials, the dry cooling methods are more significant because of providing substantially better recovery of energy thereby making the process more energy efficient and cost effective.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention envisages a process for manufacturing white cement using a dry quenching system, as represented in Figure 3.<br>
The first step of the process for manufacturing white cement clinker of the present invention comprises of manufacturing the hot cement clinker by using conventional process. The process steps of crusing, grinding, bending and clinkering constitute the part of the conventional process.<br>
For the production of white cement clinker, the selection of raw materials is of great importance. The lime stones and clay (kaolin) containing negligible amount of iron, manganese oxide and the substances that give grey color to the cement are the most preferred materials for the production of white cement clinker.<br>
 <br>
In accordance with the present invention as provided in Figure-3, the lime stones, clay and other useful ingredients are fed in Crusher Stacker Reclaimer independently to obtain the said materials in reduced size.<br>
After crushing, the crushed raw materials are proportioned and fed to Raw Meal Grinder to obtain the fine particulate matter. Afterward, the fine particulate materials are blended and fed in kiln, operating at a temperature of about 1450 °C to 1500 °C; at a high temperature condition, the blended fine particulate matter undergoes series of chemical reactions to obtain hot cement clinker.<br>
The hot cement clinker is then subjected to cooling/quenching process. In the production of white cement clinker, the cooling/quenching process is a very crucial step.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a dry quenching process for the production of white cement clinker, as shown in Figure 4.<br>
The dry quenching process of the present invention comprises of circulating the dry inert gas through closed chamber containing red hot cement clinker. The purity of the inert gas also plays a very decisive role; hence the purity of the inert gases is maintained at highest level.<br>
The red hot white cement clinker from the rotary kiln having a temperature above 1200 °C are sent to decoloriser/dryer/quencher/closed chamber where the hot white cement clinker is dry quenched by passing inert gas in a closed<br>
 <br>
environment, refer Figure 4. In order to complete the quenching process in a short period of time, quantity of the inert gas circulated through the closed chamber is also regulated.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the inert gas used in the dry quenching system is a single element or a mixture of inert<br>
gases.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the inert gas is at least one gas selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, argon, neon, helium, krypton, xenon and radon.<br>
In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention, the inert gas is nitrogen.<br>
The inert gas flowing through the closed chamber absorbs the heat from the hot white cement clinker, thus, cooling the hot clinker below temperature in the range of 160 °C to 220 °C.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the hot cement clinker is cooled to a temperature below 200 °C.<br>
The inert gas stream circulated through the dry quenching system, as shown in Figure 4 of the present invention, gains heat from the red hot white cement clinker and becomes very hot having temperatures around 500 -800°C.<br>
 <br>
In accordance with the present invention, as shown in Figure 3 &amp; 4, the hot inert gas will be emitted from the decoloriser/dryer/quencher/closed chamber. The thermal energy released through the exhaust gas stream from the decoloriser/dryer/quencher/closed chamber of the dry quenching system is extracted through any waste heat recovery system.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the hot inert gas stream is introduced into the waste heat recovery system where the sensible heat of the inert gas is recovered.<br>
By recovering the sensible heat contained in the red hot white cement clinker, the energy efficiency of the clinkerisation process is improved.<br>
The dry quenching system, of the present invention, reuses the thermal energy generated during dry quenching by the inert gas, thus conserving about 15 to 30% of the energy in comparison with the conventional wet quenching process, for the manufacture of white cement clinker thereby reducing Green house Gases . The heat liberated per ton of cement clinker produced is found to be in the range of 1,00,000 Kcal to 2,75,000 Kcal.<br>
Since, water is not used during the dry quenching process of the present invention; the dry quenching process is able to save around 400 to 450 liters of water per ton of clinker.<br>
In accordance to the present invention, referring to Figure 3, in the process for manufacturing white cement clinker using the dry quenching system of<br>
 <br>
the present invention, the exhaust gases are emitted only from the grinding and the calcining processes<br>
The decolorized white cement clinker thus obtained by dry quenching process of the present invention is sent to Cement Grinder to obtain the white cement.<br>
The white cement is then subjected to chemical analysis and whiteness measurement. Whiteness of the white cement is the most important characteristic feature of white cement manufacturing process. The dry quenching system of the present invention provides a whiteness of about 90 -95 on hunter whiteness scale.<br>
 <br>
