The terpolyesters prepared by the process of the present invention are poly (4-phenylene terephthalate -co-oxyphenyl acetate/propionate)s poly (4,4'-biphenylene terephthalate-co-oxyphenyl acetate/propionate)s poly (2,6-naphthylene terephthalate-co-oxyphenyl acetate/propionate)s and are liquid crystalline polymers that can be used in electronics (eg.

Tower packing saddles to replace ceramics). The invention can be applied in plastic, electronics and computer industries.<br><br>
Background of the invention<br>
Thermotropic liquid crystalline terpolyesters obtained from rigid monomers such as 4-hydroxybenzoic acid are intractable, insoluble and not processable because the}' decompose prior to melting and their transition temperatures are too high for the existing equipment to process them.

There have been a large number of attempts to bring down the transition Temperatures to a processable range (W. J. Jackson, Jr. and H. F. Kuhfuss,/. Appl. Polym. Sci., 25, 1685 (1985). A. J. East. L.

synthesis and characterization of Aromatic polyesters; C. K. S. Pillai, D. C. Sherrington and A. Sneddon, Polymer, 33, 3968 (1992)). A number of chemical approaches have been devised to arrive at structures that have lower transition temperatures and lower symmetries. These approaches involve disrupting the ordered structures of the homopolyesters by introducing<br><br>
chain disrupters such as flexible unit, a kink structure, or crank shaft structure etc. or by copolymerising with suitable comonomers that bring down the transition temperatures. A number of copolyesters have thus been prepared out of which a few commercial polymers such as Vectra\ and Xydar*, are well known. It is, however, now realised that these copolyesters still have a processing temperature above 300°C and iience require newer methods or structures to overcome this problem. In this situation, 4-hydroxy phenyl acetic acid, and 3(4 - hydroxyphenyl propionic acid), the monomers that possesses a GH,- unit between the carboxyl and die rigid phenyl unit and hence expected to bring down the transition temperature when copolymerised stands a significant chance for contributing to solving this problem. The drawbacks of the currently marketed liquid crystalline polyesters are that, polyesters of 4-hydroxy benzoic acid do not form a melt below its decompositon temperature and liquid crystalline copolyesters like 4-hydroxy benzoic acid / polyethylene terepthalate system (Eastman X7G) has several short comings in that the heat distortion temp is low (300°C) processing is rather<br>
difficult.<br>
The homopolyester of 4-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid and its copolyester with 4-hydroxy benzoic acid are melt processable liquid crystalline polymers exhibiting clear nematic phase. The terpolyesters of 4- hydroxyphenyl acetic acid and 3(4-hydroxy phenyl)propionic acid widi hydroquinone/ 4,4' biphenol/ 2,6-naphthylene diol and terephthalic acid are .expected to be melt processable with lower melt transition temperatures than that of commercial<br><br>
terpolye.sters like Xydar1. Although this is die easiest route to achieve melt processabiliry. there is no publication or patent on the preparation of the terpolyester. Though homopolymerisation of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid is well studied, only a few reports are available on the polymerisation and characterisation of 4- hydroxybenzoic acid containing methylene units between aromatic ring and the carboxyl groups such as 4-hydroxy phenyl acetic acid and 3-(4- hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid. There is one report on the preparation of poly [4-hydroxyphenyl) acetate (Hans-G. Elias, Robert J. Warner, MakromoL Chem. 182, 681-686 (1981). However, the molecular weight of the polymer is low and the mesophase behaviour was not studied. Hans R. Kricheldorf, et al have synthesised the homopolyesters of 3(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid. However, the homopolyesters do not show any liquid crystalline properties. On the contrary, its copolyesters with 4-hydroxy benzoic acid showed liquid crystalline transitions. (Hans R. Kricheldorf and A. Conradi /. Polym. Sci. PartA: Polym.Chem. Ed. 25, 489 (1987). However, this disclosure does not teach the synthesis of liquid crystalline terpolyesters containing terepthalic acid.<br>
Biodegradable thermotropic copolyesters and terpolyestes of 3(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid with vanillic acid, 6- hydroxy -2-naphthoic acid, 4-hydroxy cinnamic acid and 4' -hydroxybiphenyl -4-carboxylic acid were also reported (H. R. Kricheldorf, T. Stukenbrock Macromol. Chem. Phys. 198, 3753-3767 (1997); H. R. Kricheldorf, T. Stukenbrock, Polymer 38(13), 3373, 1997). However, this disclosure does not teach the synthesis of liquid crystalline terpolyesters containing terepthalic acid.<br>
The preparation of the terpolyester of (4-hydroxyphenyl) acetic acid/ 3(4-hydroxy phenyl) propionic acid with hydroquinone/ 4,4' biphenol/ 2,6-naphthylene diol and terephthalic acid would be advantageous when the cost of the final product is compared with commercial products such as Xydar* and Vectra*. These commercial terpolyesters use comonomers that are expensive. Therefore, the commercial liquid crystalline polymers are highly costly. In contrast, 4-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid/ 3(4hydroxy phenyl) propionic acid are<br><br>
comparatively cheap and hence, it is possible to achieve a cost effective process for the production of liquid crystalline copolyesters through this route. Another disadvantage of prior art terpolyesters is low decomposition temperature resulting in their decomposition before ir.elting. Prior art terpolyesters also have a higher transition temperature and thus require a higher temperature for melt processing.<br>

These terpolyesters are thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers having thermal stability value of Ti (Temperature at which thermahdeconiposition is initiated) (g^iKFCrand- better melt proccssability at @260°C.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The process of the present invention has essentially the following steps: in situ acetylation of the monomers, 4-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid/ 3(4-hydroxy phenyl) propionic acid and hydroquinone/ 4,4' biphenol/ 2,6-naphthalene diol in presence of excess acetic anhydride and acidolysis polycondensation of the acetoxy derivative of the hydroxy acid and<br><br>
the diol with terephthalic acid by acidolysis pelycondensation in presence of transesteriflcation catalysts such as magnesium acetate, antimony trioxide, lead acetate etc. at higher temperatures in the order of 240-2SO°C for 2-6 hrs in inert atmosphere. Polymerisation was further continued under reduced pressure of 1mm of Hg at a temperature range of 260-280 °C for a period of 1 - 6 hrs. This was followed by a post-polymerisation step carried out at a temperature in the range of 260-280°C under inert atmosphere for 24-72hrs and a purification step involving soxhlet extraction using solvent mixtures such as acetone-medianol, acetone- methyl ethyl ketone, acetone -isopropanol mixtures.<br>
Acetylation in presence of acetylating agents and catalysts followed by polymerisation at higher temperatures in the presence of a high temperature solvent or without the solvent media, with or without catalyst at a temperature range of 240-300°C for a period of about 6-24 hrs in the absence of a catalyst or in presence of transesterification catalysts such as acetates of lead, magnesium, cobalt, antimony etc. under reduced pressure for the efficient removal<br>
of acetic acid to effect higher molecular weight formation with post polymerisation effected at higher temperatures below the decomposition temperature for longer times and purification<br>
involving soxhlet extraction using solvent mixtures such as acetone-alcohol, acetone-methyl ethyl ketone etc.<br>

In a 60 ml polymerisation tube 0.02 mol of (4-hydroxyphenyl)acetic acid ,0.04 mol of 2,6-naphthalene diol, and 0.02 mol of terephthalic acid were taken mixed with O.OSmol of acetic anhydride and 0.01 mmol of lead acetate were added and heated under slow stirring in a slow purge of nitrogen to 140 °C and continued the heating for 1/2 hr. Then temperature was increased to 250-280 °C and continued for 2-4 hrs. Polymerisation was further continued at 0.01mm of Hg pressure for 1-6 hrs. Then the polymer was chipped out of the tube, powdered and purified by soxhlet extraction using acetone-isopropanol mixture for about 18 hrs and dried in an air oven at 60°C for about 3 hrs at reduced pressure. Then the product was post polymerised at 300°C for 24 hrs under inert atmosphere. Then it was cooled to ambient conditions and the polymer was chipped out of the tube, washed with acetone, filtered, dried in an air oven at 65°C for 2 hrs, powdered in an agate mortar and further purified by extracting for 24 hrs in a soxhlet extractor using acetone- isopropanol mixture. It was then further dried under reduced pressure in an air oven at 65°C. Example 6<br>

Then temperature was increased to 240-260 °C and continued for 12 hrs. in presence of 3ml of high temperature solvent Dowtherm*. Polymerisation was further continued at<br><br>
0.01 mm of Hg pressure for 6-12 hrs. Then the polymer was chipped out of the tube, washed, powdered and purified by soxhlet extraction using acetone-isopropanol mixture for about 18 hrs and dried in an air oven at 60°C for about 3 hrs at reduced pressure.<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of melt processable liquid crystalline terpolyester from 4- hydroxyphenyl acetic acid/ 3 (4 hydroxy phenyl) propionic acid and hydroquinone/ 4, 4' biphenol/ 2, 6-naphthalene diol. The liquid crystalline terpolyester obtained from 4- hydroxyphenyl acetic acid/ 3 (4- hydroxy phenyl) propionic acid and hydroquinone/ 4, 4' biphenol/ 2, 6-naphthalene diol of formula I has a transition temperature @ 260°C, which is lower than those (300°C) of the commercial liquid crystalline copolyester such as Vectra* and terpolyesters such as Xydar*. Hence, the liquid crystalline terpolyester obtained by the process of the present invention can be melt processed at a lower temperature dian that of Vectra* and Xydar6 and this may solve many of the processing problems associated with the existing commercial liquid crystalline polymers. The liquid crystalline terpolyesters obtained by the process of the present invention do not decompose before melting whereas poly 4- hydroxy benzoate decomposes prior to melting. As the present invention described by the present process of preparation of liquid crystalline terpolyester from 4- hydroxy phenyl acetic acid/ 3 (4- hydroxy phenyl) propionic acid and hydroquinone/ 4,4' biphenol/2,6-naphthalene diol does not use a comonomer which is too expensive, the cost of the liquid crystalline terpolyester obtained by the present process is rather low when compared to those of Vectra* and Xydar*. Commercial copolyesters use comonomers such as<br>
derivatives of hydroxynaphthoic acid  which are expensive and therefore, the commercial liquid crystalline polymers are costly. In contrast, 4-hydroxy phenyl acetic acid, and hydroquinone the comonomers used in the preparation of the terpolyester prepared by die process of the present invention, is comparatively cheaper. The process of the present invention has a step of post-polymerisation whereby a higher molecular weight is obtained so diat the properties of the polymer are better. This terpolyester has got comparatively higher<br><br>
decomposition temperature, Ti of @390°C. The cost of the terpolyesters are comparatively less compared to the commercial copolyesters. It shows drastic reduction in viscosity due to nematic mesophase, which is required for further processing by injection molding and extrusion.<br><br><br><br><br>
