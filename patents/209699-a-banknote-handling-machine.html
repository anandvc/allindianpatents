THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>
[39 OF 1970]<br>
&amp;<br>
THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
" A BANKNOTE HANDLING MACHINE "<br>
NYBOHOV DEVELOPMENT AB, of P. O. Box 47041, S-10074, Stockholm, Sweden,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a banknote handling machine and more specifically to a machine that includes an infeed part for customer identification and for receiving banknotes deposited by the customer from outside the machine, detection means for checking the validity of the deposited banknotes, and means for printing information in respect of customer deposited banknotes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION -<br>
Automatic telling machines that are provided with means for detecting false banknotes are known to the art. Any false banknote that is detected is not returned to the depositing customer, but is stored in the machine and later becomes the subject of a separate investigation.<br>
The procedure undertaken with such an investigation can be relatively complicated and tediously long, which makes it difficult to establish the source of the raise banknote, or may make such establishment impossible. The object of the present invention is to endeavour to eliminate the aforesaid drawback and other drawbacks, among other things.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A banknote handling machine of the aforedescribed kind includes a process unit which functions to control the transportation of a banknote which the detector means suspects to be false, to a separate unit tor storing and encasing, packaging, suspected false banknotes, and also controls means for printing customer related Information, and information relating to any possibly false banknoces detected<br><br>
in conjunction with storing and packaging the suspected false banknote.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings, in which Fig. 1 illustrates an inventive banknote handling machine; Fig. 2 illustrates in somewhat larger scale a unit for storing and packaging suspected false banknotes included in the machine according to Fig. 1; and<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a packaging mechanism included in the machine according to Fig. 1.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The inventive banknote handling machine includes an infeed part 1 and an outfeed part 2.<br>
The infeed part 1 includes a deposit compartment 10, detector means 11, a process unit 12, a conveyor path 13'-13"-13, first storage means 14, second storage means 15, first stacker means 16, second stacker means 17, and   a packaging or encasing unit 18.<br>
Banknotes deposited in the machine are bundled and placed into the deposit compartment 10, possibly in different denominations, said compartment accommodating up to 500 banknotes. These banknotes are separated one after the other and conveyed along an upper conveyor path 13', pas- the detector means 11 and up to guide means  direction changing; 13", which lead the banknotes down to a lower conveyor path 13.<br>
The detector means 11 is placed in the close proximity of the deposit compartment 10 and is adapted tc sort false<br>
banknotes, poor quality banknotes and other banknotes from the arriving banknotes. By sorting is meant here that passing banknotes are "marked" in some way so that respective banknotes can be handled as being "possibly false", "poor quality" or "accepted" in the subsequent transportation of the banknotes.<br>
The storage device 14, and also other similar storage devices in the machine, has two belts between which banknotes are stored, a storage drum 141 and two unwinding drums 142 and 143. The leading edge of a banknote arriving at the said storage device actuates a sensor 144 which therewith starts-up three motors which each drive a respective drum 141-143. The banknote is drawn about 120 mm in between the belts, which are together wound-up on the storage drum 14 1, which can accommodate about 500 banknotes. As the belts are coiled on the drum, information relating to the banknotes is sent to the process unit 12, whereby an account can be kept of the sequence between the banknotes. When banknotes are taken from the device 14, impulses are sent to the motors causing the drums to be driven in opposite directions.<br>
A manipulator 19 provided along the conveyor path close to the storage devices 14, 15 functions to c:rre:: the positions of any banknotes that may  have been twisted or displaced laterally during their transportation.<br>
Each of the stacker device 16, 17 includes a so-called stacker wheel which gathers sequentially arriving banknotes into a bundle in a storage compartment. When the bundle contains the intended number of banknotes, the bundis is clarped by a pair of arms and   fed down to the packaging unit 18.<br>
The packaging unit 13 includes two rollers that carry packaging material (plastic material). A banknote bundle to<br><br>
be packaged is drawn down into a pocket that consists of two plastic strips of the same length and width, one from each roll. The plastic strips are pressed together around the bundle and welded along their edges with the aid of a TeflonÂ®-coated heating wire. The reader is referred to U.S. Patent Specification 5,031,379 for a more detailed explanation of this known technique.<br>
The process unit 12 controls the transportation of poor quality banknotes along the conveyor path 13 to the units 16 and 18 for storage and packaging of these banknotes. This unit is comprised of the stacker device 16 and the packaging device 18.<br>
The process unit 12 also controls the transportation of at least some of the remaining genuine and accepted banknotes to unit 14-17-18 for storing and packaging these banknotes in accordance  with their denominations. This unit is comprised of the storage device 14, the stacker device 17 and the packaging unit 18.<br>
The manner in which the process unit 12 controls the passage of banknotes along different parts of the conveyor path 13 to their different destinations, with the aid cf path selectors, detectors, etc., is known to the art and will r.:: therefore be described in detail here.<br>
Any suspect banknotes encountered in the detere tor device 11 can be transported to the stacker device 16 fir instance, and from there to the packaging unit 13 where they are rarkaged together with an automatically printed receipt that includes the number of banknotes, the date, etc., and also information relating to the customer depositing the banknotes, e.g. through the medium cf an account number. This enables the source of false or suspect banknotes to be investigated.<br><br>
Fig. 2 illustrates the stacker device 16 and the packaging device 18 in positions in which they form a unit 16-18 for storing and packaging suspected false banknotes. A printing device 181 is provided for printing directly on the inner surface of packaging material (the plastic strip) in mirror image customer related information and information relating to encountered suspect banknotes (preferably several such banknotes). Transportation of the banknote (the banknotes) and printing of said information is controlled by the process unit 12. Thus, in the event of detecting several banknotes that are suspected of being false on one and the same depositing occasion, these banknotes will be collected in one and the same package on which durable information disclosing the contents of the package has been printed.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates the actual packaging mechanism, including the rolls 182, 183 of plastic packaging material 184. The ends of the material taken from the two rolls are welded together at 185 (after a preceding packaging operation) and form the bottom of a disposable cassette or package for receiving a banknote (banknotes) fed down from above. The printing device 131 is mounted above and close :o the roll 182 with the printing head 1811 of said device close to a guide roller 136 and  at the upper side of the plastic material 184, this side thus becoming the inside cf the package or cassette when a banknote (banknotes; is fed down in between two plastic lengths, one from each roil, ar.d said lengths are then welded together tc form a closed package or cassette. It is important that the print is applied close tc the weld j oin 185.<br><br><br>
