				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to arylmethyl-carbonylaminothiazole derivatives ar more specifically relates to 2-(arylmethyI-carnylamino)-l,3-thiazole derivatives, to a process for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions contaimng them, and to th" use as therapeutic agents, particularly in the treatment of cancer and cell proliferative disorders.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Several cytotoxic drugs such as, e.g. fluorouracil (5-FU), doxorubicin and caraptothecins, cause damage DNA or affect cellular metabolic pathways and thus cause many cases, an indirect block of the cell cycle. Therefore, by producing an irreversible damage to both nonnal and tumor cells, these agents result in a significant toxicity and s effects.<br>
In this respect, compounds capable of being highly specific antitumor agents by selectively leading to tumor cell arrest and apoptosis, with comparable efficacy but redu toxicity than the cuirentiy available drugs, are desirable,<br>
It is well known that progression through the cell cycle is governed by a series o checkpoint controls, otherwise refened to as restriction points, which are regulated by a family of enzymes known as the cycUn-dependent kinases (cdk).<br>
In their turn, the cdks themselves are regulated at many levels such as, for instan binding to cycUns.<br>
The coordinated activation and inactivation of different cyclin/cdk complexes is necessary for noimal progression through the cell cycle. Both the critical Gl-S and G2-J transitions are controlled by the activation of different cyclin/cdk activities. In Gl, both cyclin D/cdk4 and cyclin E/cdk2 are thought to mediate the onset of S-phase. Progressic through S-phasc requires the activity of cyclin A7cdk2 whereas the activation of cyclin<br><br>
A/cdc2 (cdkl) and cyclin B/cdc2 are required for the onset of metaphases.  For a general reference to cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases see, for example, Kevin R. Webster et al. in Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs, 1998, Vol, 7(6), 865-887.<br>
Checkpoint controls are defective in tumor cells due, in part, to disreguiation of cdk activity. For example, altered expression of cyclin E and cdk"s has been observed in tumor cells, and deletion of the cdk inhibitor p27 KIP gene in mice has been shown to result in a higher incidence of cancer.<br>
Increasing evidence supports the idea thai the cdks are rate-limiting enzymes in cell cycle progression and, as such, represent molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. In particular, the direct inhibition of cdk/cyclin kinase activity should be helpfiil in restricting the unregulated proliferation of a tumor cell,<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide compounds which are useful in treating cell proliferative disorders associated with an altered cell dependent kinase activity. It is another object to provide compounds which have cdk/cyclin kinase inhibitory activity.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide compounds which are useful in therapy as antitumor agents but lack, in terms of both toxicity and side effects, the drawbacks associated with currently available antitumor drags discussed above.<br>
The present inventors have now discovered that 2-amino-l ,3-thiazole derivatives are endowed with cdk/cyclin kinase inhibitory activity and are thus useful in therapy as antitumor agents and lack, in terms of both toxicity and side effects, the aforementioned drawbacks associated with currently available antitumor drags.<br>
More specifically, the compounds of this invention are usefii! in the treatment of a variety of cancers including, but not limited to; carcinoma such as bladder, breast, colon, kidney, liver, lung, including small cell lung cancer, esophagus, gall-bladder, ovary, pancreas, stomach, cervix, thyroid, prostale, and skin, including squamous ceJ) carcinoma; hematopoietic tumors of lymphoid lineage, including leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, T-cell-lymphoma, Hodgkin"s lymphoma, non-Hodgkin"s lymphoma, hairy cell lymphoma and Burkett"s lymphoma; hematopoietic<br><br>
tumors of myeloid lineage, including acute and chronic myelogenous ieukemias, myclodysplastic syndrome and promyeiocytic leukemia; tumors of mesenchymal origin, including fibrosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma; tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system, including astrocytoma, neuroblastoma, glioma and schwannomas; other tumors, including melanoma, seminoma, teratocarcinoma, osteosarcoma, xenoderoma pigmentosum, keratoctanthoma, thyroid follicular cancer and Kaposi"s sarcoma.<br>
Due to the key role of cdks in the regulation of cellular proliferation, the 2-amino-l,3-thiazoie derivatives are also useful in (he treatment of a variety of cell proliferative disorders such as, for instance, benign prostate hyperplasia, familial adenomatosis polyposis, neuroÂ¬fibromatosis, psoriasis, vascular smooth cell proliferation associated with atherosclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, arthritis glomerulonephritis and post-surgical stenosis and restenosis.<br>
The compotmds of the invention can be useful in the treatment of Alzheimer"s disease, as suggested by the fact that cdk5 is involved in the phosphorylation of tau protein (J, Biochem., 117,741-749, 1995).<br>
The compounds of this invention, as modulators of apoptosis, could be useful in the treatment of cancer, viral infections, prevention of AIDS development in HIV-infected individuals, autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative disorder.<br>
The compounds of this invention may also be useful in inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and metastasis.<br>
The compounds of this invention may also act as inhibitors of other protein kinases, e.g. protein kinase C, her2, rafl, MEKl, MAP kinase, EGF receptor, PDGF receptor, IGF receptor, PI3 kinase, weel kinase, Src, Abl and thus be effective in the treatment of diseases associated with other protein kinases.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for the treatment of cell proliferative disorders associated with an altered cell dependent kinase activity, by administering to a mammal in need thereof an effective amount of a 2-amino-1,3-thiazole represented by formula (I) or (11):<br><br><br>

Pharmacology<br>
The compounds of formula (I) or (II), are active as cdk/cyclin inhibitors as they gave positive results when tested according to the following procedure.<br>
The inhibiting activity of putative cdk/cychn inhibitors and the potency of selected compounds was determined through a method of assay based on the use of the MultiScreen-PH 96 well plate (Millipore), in which a phosphocellulose filter paper was placed at each well bottom allowing binding of positive charged substrate after a washing/filtration step.<br>
When a radioactivity labelled phosphate moiety was transferred by the ser/threo kinase to the filter-bound histone, light emitted was measured in a scintillation counter.<br>
The inhibition assay of cdk2/Cyclin A activity was performed according to the following protocol:<br>
Kinase reaction: 1.5 M histone HI substrate, 25 M ATP (0.5 uCi P33g-ATP), 100 ng Cyclin A/cdk2 complex, JO Minhibitorin afinal volume of 100 ^iL buffer (THIS HC) JO mM, pH 7.5, MgC12 10 mM, 7,5 mM DTT) were added to each well of a 96 U bottom well plate. After 10 min at 37 C incubation, reaction was stopped by 20 p.L EDTA 120 mM.<br>
Capture: 100 1 were transferred from each well to MultiScreen plate, to allow substrate binding to phosphocellulose filter. Plates were then washed 3 times with 150 pi/well PBS Ca-H-/Mg++ free and filtered by MultiScreen filtration system.<br><br>
Detection; filters were allowed to dry at 37 C, then 100 1/well scijitillant were added and 33P labelled histone HI was detected by radioactivity counting in the Top-Count instnimeiit.<br>
Results: data were analysed and expressed as % inhibition referred to total activity of enzyme (=100%).<br>
Ail compounds showing inhibition &gt; 50 % were further analyzed in order to study and define the kinetic-profile of inhibitor through Ki calculation.<br>
The protocol used was the same described above, except for ATP and substrate concentrations. Either the concentration of ATP and hislone HI substrate were varied: 4, 8,12, 24, 48 AM for ATP (containing proportionally diluted P33g-ATP) and 0.4, 0.8,1.2, 2,4, 4.8 AM for histone were used in absence and presence of two different, properly chosen inhibitor concentrations.<br>
Experimental data were analysed by the computer program "SigmaPlot" for Ki determination, using a random bireactant system equation:<br><br>
where A=ATP and B=histone HI.<br>
As an example, herewith reported is the inhibiting activity towards the CDk2/cyclin A complex, expressed as 1C50 value, of a compound of the invention namely, 2-[2-(acetylamino)i,3-thiazol-4-yl]-N-(5-isopropyl-l,3-thiazol-2-yl)acetamide [0.5 (M)],<br>
In addition, the inhibiting activity of putative cdk/cyciin inhibitors and the potency of selected compounds was determined through a method of assay based on the use of a SPA (Scintillation Proximity Assay) 96 well plate assay. The assay is based on the ability of<br><br>
streptavidin coated SPA beads to capture a biotinylated peptide derived from a phosphorylation site of histone.<br>
When a radioactivity labelled phosphate moiety was transferred by the ser/threo kinase to the biotinylated histone peptide, light emitted was measured in a scintillation counter.<br>
The inhibition assay of cdk5/p25 activity was performed according to the following protocol:<br>
Kinase reaction: 1,0   M biotinylated histone peptide substrate, 0,25 uCi P33g-ATP, 4 nMcdk2/p25 complex, O-IOO M inhibitor in a final volume of 100 ! buffer (Hepes 20 mM pH7.5,MgC12 15 mM, 1 mMDTT) were added to each well of a 96 U bottom well plate. After 20 min at 37 C incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 ug SPA beads in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 uM ATP and 5 mM EDTA. The beads were allowed to settle, and the radioactivity incoiporated in the 33P-labelled peptide was detected in a Top Count scintillation counter.<br>
Results: Data were analyzed and expressed as % Inhibition using the formula:<br>
100X(1 - (Unknown - Bkgd) / (Enz. Control - Bkgd))<br>
IC50 values were calculated using a variation of the four parameter logistics equation:<br>
Y = ] 00/f 1 + 10 -^((LogECSO - X)*SIope)]<br>
Where X =log(uM) and Y = % Inhibition.<br>
