COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10, Rule 13)<br>
BUTTERFLY GATE FOR USE ON ANICUTS<br>
GODBOLE PRABHAKAR DAMODAR<br>
2/B, BUTY PLOTS, DHARAMPETH,<br>
NAGPUR, MAHARASHTRA STATE,<br>
INDIA, INDIAN CITIZEN<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br>
5 MAY 2004  <br><br>
The conventional design of anicuts incorporates a number of masonry or concrete piers at approx. 1.5 -2 m. c/c. Wooden or steel needles are inserted in the grooves provided in the piers for storing water during the lean season. These needles are removed before the onset of rainy season for allowing the flood water to pass without causing any damage to the river banks &amp; the river bed. For enabling insertion &amp; removal of needles an R.C.C. deck slab is provided on top of piers.<br>
Insertion &amp; removal of needles is a time consuming &amp; laborious process. Moreover, due to extensive deforestation in the catchment areas of the rivers, most of the rivers are no longer perennial. The flow in the river stops as soon as the rainy season is over. Even during the rainy season, the frequency &amp; quantum of rainfall is becoming unpredictable. If the needles are inserted too early, the anicut gets outflanked due to flash floods in October. If the needles are inserted too late say in November, no water is stored in the anicut.<br>
The present invention solves this problem by eliminating the need for insertion &amp; removal of needles frequently. The invention consists of an elliptical drum rotating about a vertical axis supported on vertical axles, at its top and bottom ends. The top axle is supported on the inspection bridge and the bottom axle is supported in the anicut crest concrete.<br>
The gate can be opened or closed by rotating it about a vertical axis by 90Â° in either direction. The gate can be rotated by an actuator mounted on the inspection bridge and operated by a Hydraulic pump. The gate can be locked in fully open, partially open or fully closed position.<br>
The bearings provided are of the oil less type, needing no lubrication or maintenance.<br>
2<br><br>
The bottom rubber seals are in the form of a circular ring eliminating the possibility of damage due to twisting. Similarly, there is very little possibility of debris being entrapped between bottom seals &amp; seal seats.<br>
Broad details of installation of the Butterfly gate on the anicut are explained with the help of figures 1A, IB. Figure 1A shows a diagrammatic representation of two spans of an anicut in sectional front elevation and figure IB shows the same anicut in plan view. The RCC piers which form consecutive gate spans are marked<br>
'A'.<br>
The Butterfly gate marked 'B' is shown in fully open position in the left span &amp; fully closed position in the right span.<br>
The deck bridge (generally of steel) is marked 'C and the actuating mechanism is marked 'DThe Butterfly gate comprises of six main components :-<br>
i)	The Rotating Gate Leaf<br>
ii)	Bottom Gate support Frame<br>
iii)	Inspection Bridge<br>
iv)	Bottom sealing system<br>
v)	Side sealing system<br>
vi)	Actuating mechanism<br>
Figure 2A shows the details of construction of the rotating gate leaf in sectional front elevation &amp; figure 2B shows the gate leaf in plan view.<br>
The gate leaf is generally made from structural steel plates &amp; rolled sections. It is formed in the shape of an elliptical drum marked ' 1' closed by an elliptical end plate marked '2' at its top and a circular end plate marked '3' at its bottom. The bottom end plate is provided with circumferential rim marked '4' to<br>
3<br><br>
support a stainless steel ring marked '5'. The elliptical drum is also provided with two vertical stainless steel seal seats marked '6' at its two ends.<br>
The upper end plate marked '2' is provided with a top axle marked '7' and the bottom end plate marked '3' is provided with a bearing housing marked '8'. The bearing housing is also provided with oil-less bush bearing marked '9'. The bottom end plate is also provided with a circular wheel track marked '10' an inner circular stiffener ring marked '11' and radial stiffeners marked '12'.<br>
Figure 3A shows the details of construction of the Bottom gate support frame in sectional front elevation and figure 3B shows the same gate support frame in plan view.<br>
The gate support frame marked '13' is shown to be of octagonal shape. However any other shape can also be adopted. This frame carries a central vertical axle marked '14' out of stainless steel, a set of 4 wheel assemblies marked '15' to take the vertical water load acting on the rotating gate leaf and the self weight of the rotating gate leaf and a seal base support plate marked '16' for enabling welding of bottom seal base ring.<br>
Each wheel assembly has two vertical plates for supporting the axles of wheels, one horizontal axle made out of stainless steel, one wheel which is provided with an oil-less bush bearing which mates with the stainless steel axle.<br>
Figure 4A shows in sectional front elevation the deck bridge and figure 4B shows the same bridge in plan view.<br>
The deck bridge which is made from structural steel rolled sections is provided with checkered plate marked '17' on top and a small rectangular plate marked '18' at its bottom, in its central portion. These two plates together support a bearing housing marked '19', which is provided with an oil-less bush bearing. This<br>
4<br><br>
bush bearing mates with the upper axle of gate leaf marked '7' in figure 2A (shown in dotted lines for reference).<br>
Figure 5A shows the bottom sealing system in sectional front elevation and Figure 5B shows the same system in plan view.<br>
A seal base ring marked '20' is welded on top of the seal base support plate (marked '16' in figures 3A &amp; 3B) . A rubber sealing ring marked '21', a seal clamping ring marked '22' and clamping bolts marked '23' complete the bottom sealing system.<br>
Figure 6A shows the side sealing system in front elevation and figure 6B shows the same system in sectional plan view. Anchor channels marked '24' are embedded in RCC piers. Seal base support angles marked '25' are welded to the anchor channels. Seal bases marked '26' are welded to the seal base support angles. Rubber seals marked '27', seal clamps marked '28' and clamping bolts marked '29' complete the side sealing system.<br>
Figure 7A shows the actuating mechanism in front elevation and figure 7B shows the same mechanism in plan view.<br>
An actuating lever marked '30' (with its rectangular slotted end) fits over the rectangular end of the upper axle of the gate leaf (marked '7' in figure 2A &amp; 2B). The upper axle &amp; part of gate leaf are shown by dotted lines for reference.<br>
A hydraulic cylinder marked '31' is attached to other end of the actuating lever marked '30' through a stainless steel pin marked '32'. The piston rod end of the hydraulic cylinder is provided with an eyelet fitted with an oil-less bush bearing (not marked). The rear end of the hydraulic cylinder is also provided with an eyelet fitted with an oil-less bush bearing (not marked).<br>
5<br><br>
The rear end of the hydraulic cylinder is supported over another stainless steel pin marked '33', which is welded to the inspection bridge.<br>
The hydraulic pump marked '34' (which connects its oil delivery &amp; oil return hoses to the hydraulic cylinder) completes the actuating system.<br>
Sequence of operation :-<br>
When the gate is rotated to its closed position by means of the actuator operated from the bridge deck, water starts to collect in the pond formed on the upstream side of the anicut. When the water level reaches the designed reservoir level &amp; tends to exceed this level, one or two gates are opened partially or fully to ensure that the quantity of out-flowing water is nearly equal to the quantity of water in-flowing into the pond. As the river flow decreases, the partially opened gates are fully closed.<br>
Before the rainy season starts, all the gates are rotated to their fully open position &amp; locked until the end of the rainy season. The gates are again closed after the end of the rainy season.<br>
1 claim:<br>
1.   A butterfly gate for use on anicut comprising of<br>
i.	an elliptical drum rotating about a vertical axis, its upper end closed by<br>
an elliptical end plate and its lower end closed by a circular plate, the upper end plate being provided with an axle and the bottom end plate being provided with a bush bearing, the upper end axle being supported on the inspection bridge and the lower bush bearing supported in the anicut crest concrete and<br>
6<br><br>
ii. an actuating mechanism consisting of an actuating lever arm attached to the upper axle of the elliptical drum, an actuator mounted on the inspection bridge and operated by a hydraulic pump to enable rotation of gate from its closed position to open position and vice versa.<br><br>
2. A butterfly gate for use on anicut as claimed in claim 1 wherein rubber seals are clamped on periphery of the circular bottom end plate for providing sealing at the bottom and rubber seals are clamped on seal base angles embedded in the end pier of the anicut by nut bolts to prevent leakage in gate closed position.<br><br>
