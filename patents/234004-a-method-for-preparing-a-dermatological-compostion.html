				<td>A METHOD FOR PREPARING A DERMATOLOGICAL COMPOSITION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to the field of dermatology. In particular, the<br>
invention is a novel method for treating primary non-inflammatory acne or closed<br>
comedones by topically administering dapsone.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Sebaceous glands are associated with hair follicles and secrete an oily<br>
substance called sebum into the upper part of the follicles. These glands are found<br>
everywhere on the human skin, except for the soles and dorsa of the feet and the palms. In<br>
each gland, a common excretory duct is supplied by smaller ducts that originate in the acini<br>
of the gland. As the sebaceous cells move toward the center of the gland, lipid synthesis<br>
within the cells continues until there is a 100 to 150 fold increase in cell volume. The cells<br>
then rupture and lipid is expelled into the excretory stream of the gland, passing through the<br>
follicular canal and into the upper third of the hair follicle. On the skin of the face, the<br>
sebaceous glands are the predominant portion of the follicles and are called sebaceous<br>
follicles.<br>
[0003] The follicular canal contains keratinous material, i.e., dead skin cells, from<br>
the wall of the canal, sebum from the sebaceous glands, and bacteria, predominately<br>
Propionibacterium acnes. In the follicular canal of patients with acne, these dead skin cells<br>
clump together to form a keratin plug. This altered pattern of keratinization is the primary<br>
structural change in the follicular canal that leads to an acne lesion.<br>
[0004] When the follicular canal becomes blocked, a comedone is formed. The<br>
primary manifestation of acne is the closed comedone, which are small, circumscribed,<br>
elevated lesions of the follicle that are often without a visible central plug. Closed<br>
comedones (whiteheads) are non-inflammatory acne lesions. Open comedones<br>
(blacklieads) consist of small follicular lesions having a central black keratin plug as a<br>
result of oxidation of melanin pigment. Open comedones develop from closed comedones<br>
as the orifice dilates. The open comedone is not an inflammatory lesion unless<br>
traumatized, i.e. picked at, by the patient. Comedones, either open or closed, are non-<br>
inflammatory. While the comedone is the primary lesion of acne, comedones are not<br>
unique to acne since they may be seen in other conditions such as senile comedones or<br>
trophic skin resulting from x-ray therapy.<br>
[0005] Closed comedones are potential precursors to large inflammatory lesions.<br>
The dead skin cells of the comedone are permeated with lipid and P. acnes, and as the<br>
follicle dilates from the expanding mass of keratin and lipid, inflammation develops along<br>
the follicular wall. This can lead to follicular wall rupture which extrudes the entire<br>
contents of the comedone into the dermis, generating a greater inflammatory response.<br>
Inflammatory lesions can be small papules with an encircling inflammatory region or,<br>
depending on the site and extent of the rupture, a pustule or large tender nodule may form.<br>
Papules, pustules and nodules are the three clinical descriptions for inflammatory acne.<br>
[0006] As summarized by Strauss (J. S. Strauss. (1991). "Biology of the Sebaceous<br>
Gland and Pathophysiology of Acne Vulgaris," Chapter 13 in Pathophysiologv of<br>
Dermatologic Diseases, Second Edition. N. A. Sotor and H. Baden eds., McGraw-Hill,<br>
New York: pp. 195-210) there are four principles of acne therapy: 1) correct the pattern of<br>
altered keratinization within the follicle; 2) decrease sebaceous gland activity; 3) decrease<br>
the P. acnes population and/or decrease the generation of inflammatory substances by the<br>
bacterial population; and 4) produce non-inflammatory effects.<br>
[0007] Topical retinoids such as tretinoin primarily function by correcting altered<br>
patterns of keratinization. Oral isotretinoin (13-cis retinoic acid) primarily functions by<br>
decreasing sebaceous gland activity. Antibiotic therapies such as oral minocycline or<br>
topical clindamycin primarily function by reducing the numbers or activity of P, acnes.<br>
Furthermore, steroids can be injected into acne lesions to produce an anti-inflammatory<br>
effect. However, topically applying steroids to acne results in an increase in acne lesions.<br>
[0008] Dapsone was first synthesized in 1908 and has been used medically as an<br>
antibiotic and an anti-inflammatory. Dapsone is a bis(4-aminophenyl)sulfone also known<br>
as 4',4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone, 4,4'-sulfonylbisbenzeneamine, 4,4'-sulfonyldianiline,<br>
and diaphenylsulfone. Dapsone has been used orally for the treatment of acne (C. M. Ross,<br>
Br. J. Dermatol. 73:367, (1961)) and been found to have a minimum inhibitory<br>
concentration with regard to P. acnes of about 1 microgram per milliliter (K. L. Godowski<br>
et al., J. Invest. Dermatol. 114:862 (2000)).<br>
[0009] Dapsone analogs and related compounds have been described in U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 4,829,058 and 4,912,112 to Seydel et al. The '058 patent discloses substituted bis(4-<br>
aminophenyl)sulfones useful for inhibiting growth of bacteria, mycobacteria, and<br>
plasmodia. Some of these compounds were also tested against dapsone for toxicity and<br>
anti-inflammatory activity (Coleman et al., Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology<br>
2:389-395(1996)). In the 112 patent, substituted 2,4-diamino-5-ben2yl pyrimidines havmg<br>
antimicrobial activity particularly against mycobacteria are described. Some of these<br>
compounds were also tested against dapsone for toxicity (Coleman et al., J. Pharm.<br>
Pharmacol, 48:945-950 (1996)) and anti-inflammatory activity (Coleman et al., J. Pharm.<br>
Pharmacol., 49:53-57 (1997)). The teachings of these references in combination with<br>
subsequent publications showed that these analogs and related compounds have activity<br>
similar to dapsone and would be expected to have similar treatment efficacy.<br>
[0010] Topical dapsone formulations have been described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,733,572 to Unger et al., and U.S. Patent Nos. 6,056,954; 6,056,955; 6,254,866;<br>
6,248,324; and 6,277,399 to Fischetti et al. However, these compositions are not used to<br>
treat acne lesions.<br>
[0011] U.S. Patent No. 6,200,964 discloses a topical silicone gel having salicylic<br>
acid, and optionally, a dermatological agent such as dapsone. In this formulation, salicylic<br>
acid is described as the anti-acne agent. Dapsone is not specifically included in this<br>
composition to treat acne.<br>
[0012] While inflammatory acne lesions are currently treated in various ways, effective<br>
treatments for non-inflammatory acne lesions are lacking. Thus, new treatments for non-<br>
inflammatory acne are needed. In particular, a topical composition having dapsone is needed for<br>
the treatment of non-inflammatory acne.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013] The present invention is a method for treating acne conditions such as<br>
inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne by topically applying a dermatological composition<br>
that includes dapsone. The dermatological composition preferably includes a mixture of<br>
dissolved and microparticulate dapsone. Typically, dapsone is delivered using a semisolid<br>
aqueous_gel, but other pharmaceutical carriers such as creams, lotions, solutions, ointments, and<br>
sprays may also be used. The dermatological composition that is topically applied may also<br>
include additives such as preservatives, antioxidants, fragrances, colorants, or sunscreens.<br>
Besides treating acne, the dermatological composition having dapsone may also be topically<br>
applied to prevent non-inflammatory acne lesions from progressing to inflammatory acne<br>
lesions.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014] The inventive method treats acne conditions, e.g., inflammatory or non-<br>
inflammatory acne, by the topical application of a dermatologic composition comprising<br>
dapsone. A topical composition including dapsone for acne treatment has been described in<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,863,560, and 6,060,085 to Osbome which are herein incorporated by<br>
reference in their entirety. The composition is a combination of microparticulate and dissolved<br>
dapsone that allows optimal delivery of dapsone to the upper follicle and drug penetration to the<br>
site of inflammation. As used herein, the term "treat", "treatment", or "treating" refers to the<br>
reduction in number and/or severity of individual acne lesions, prevention of the development of<br>
acne lesions, or global improvement in the appearance of acne lesions.<br>
[0015] The term "topical" as used herein refers to the route of administration of a<br>
dermatological composition that involves direct application to the body part being treated, e.g.,<br>
the skin. Examples of topical application include application to the skin of gels or other<br>
semisolids to rub-on, solutions to spray, or liquids to be applied by an applicator. Rinse-off<br>
application with washes, cleansers, or shampoos are also examples of topical application.<br>
Typically, areas of the body suitable for application of the dermatological composition include<br>
the skin of the face, throat, neck, scalp, chest, back, ears, and other skin sites where acne lesions<br>
may occur.<br>
[0016] P. acnes is a primary factor in the formation of papules, pustules, and nodules,<br>
the iriflammatoryjesions of acne. The antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties of<br>
dapsone have been well described over the nearly 100 year use of the drug, implicating dapsone<br>
as a favorable drug candidate for the treatment of inflammatory acne. The role of P. acnes,<br>
while not fully understood, is not considered a primary factor in the development of non-<br>
inflammatory lesions. Thus, it would be unexpected that topical dapsone would significantly<br>
reduce the number of non-inflammatory lesions. However, our experimental data demonstrates<br>
that the number of non-inflammatory acne lesions are reduced as a result of treatment with<br>
topical dapsone.<br>
TOPICAL DAPSONE COMPOSITIONS<br>
[0017] By use of the term "dapsone" it is meant the chemical compound dapsone<br>
having the chemical formula C12H12N2O2S as well as bis(4-aminophenyl)sulfone, 4'.4'-<br>
diaminodiphenyl sulfone and its hydrates, 4,4'-sulfonylbisbenzeneamine, 4,4'-sulfonyldianiline,<br>
diaphenylsulfone, dapsone analogs, and dapsone related compounds. "Dapsone analogs" refers<br>
to chemical compounds that have similar chemical structures and thus similar therapeutic<br>
potential to dapsone such as the substituted bis(4-aminophenyl)-sulfones. "Dapsone related<br>
compounds" refers to chemical compounds that have similar therapeutic potential, but are not as<br>
closely related by chemical structure to dapsone such as the substituted 2,4-diamino-5-<br>
benzylpyrimidines.<br>
[0018] In one embodiment, non-inflammatory acne is treated by topically applying a<br>
dermatological composition comprising dapsone. Preferably, the dermatological composition is<br>
part of a novel pharmaceutical carrier system that is a semisolid aqueous gel, wherein the<br>
composition exhibits an optimal balance between dissolyed dapsone that is available to cross<br>
through the stratum corneum to become systemically available, and microparticulate dapsone<br>
that is retained in or above the stratum comeum to serve as a reservoir or to provide dapsone to<br>
the supracomeum zone. The microparticulate dapsone may comprise a crystalline precipitant or<br>
an amorphous precipitant.<br>
Dapsone Topical Gel<br>
[0019] Optimal balance is accomplished by having a semisolid gel carrier system in<br>
which microparticulate dapsone precipitates are formed in reproducible ratios with respect to the<br>
dissolved dapsone. For the composition to have a wide range of applicability, the<br>
microparticulate to dissolved dapsone ratio preferably should be no greater than five, at<br>
therapeutic levels of applied active dapsone.<br>
[0020] A composition having a microparticulate to dissolved dapsone ratio of less than<br>
two may provide the greatest amount of pharmaceutical available for immediate partition out of<br>
the stratum comeum and into the viable epidermis. This should provide minimum reservoir<br>
capacity, but may not maintain sustained delivery or provide maximum activity in the<br>
supracomeum zone. A composition having a microparticulate to dissolved dapsone ratio of two<br>
or greater may have a reduced amount of drug available for immediate partition out of the<br>
stratum corneum and into the viable epidermis. This provides maximum reservoir capacity, and<br>
maintains sustained delivery, providing maximum activity in the supracomeum zone. In an<br>
example of a dermatological composition of this inventive method, the ratio for microparticulate<br>
dapsone to dissolved dapsone should be no greater than 50, preferably no greater than 10, and<br>
most preferably no greater than 5. Drug delivery from the microparticulate/dissolved dapsone<br>
formulation may be optimized to provide higher levels of drug to the supracomeum zone, while<br>
maintaining the level of drug partitioning out of the stratum corneum and into the viable<br>
epidermis, despite 10-fold increases in the amount of pharmaceutical applied to the skin.<br>
(0021] In one embodiment, the dermatological composition that is applied comprises a<br>
semi-solid or gel-like vehicle that may include a polymer thickener, water, preservatives, active<br>
surfactants or emulsifiers, antioxidants, sunscreens, and a solvent or mixed solvent system. The<br>
solvent or mixed solvent system is important to the formation of the microparticulate to<br>
dissolved dapsone ratio. The formation of the microparticulate, however, should not interfere<br>
with the ability of the polymer thickener or preservative systems to perform their functions.<br>
[0022] Polymer thickeners that may be used include those known to one skilled in the<br>
art, such as hydrophilic and hydroalcoholic gelling agents frequently used in the cosmetic and<br>
pharmaceutical industries. Preferably, the hydrophilic or hydroalcoholic gelling agent<br>
comprises "CARBOPOL®" (B.F. Goodrich, Cleveland, OH), "HYPAN®" (Kingston<br>
Technologies, Dayton, NJ), "NATROSOL®" (Aqualon, Wilmington, DE), "KLUCEL®"<br>
(Aqualon, Wilmington, DE), or "STABILEZE®" (ISP Technologies, Wayne, NJ). Preferably,<br>
the gelling agent comprises between about 0.2% to about 4% by weight of the composition.<br>
More particularly, the preferred compositional weight percent range for "CARBOPOL®" is<br>
between about 0.5% to about 2%, while the preferred weight percent range for "NATROSOL®<br>
and "KLUCEL®" is between about 0.5% to about 4%. The preferred compositional weight<br>
percent range for both "HYPAN®" and "STABILEZE®" is between about 0.5% to about 4%.<br>
[0023] "CARBOPOL®" is one of numerous cross-linked acrylic acid polymers that are<br>
given the general adopted name carbomer. These polymers dissolve in water and form a clear or<br>
slightly hazy gel upon neutralization with a caustic material such as sodium hydroxide,<br>
potassium hydroxide, triethanolamine, or other amine bases. "KLUCEL®" is a cellulose<br>
polymer that is dispersed in water and forms a uniform gel upon complete hydratiori. Other<br>
preferred gelling polymers include hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, cellulose<br>
gum, MVA/MA copolymers, MVE/MA decadiene crosspolymer, PVM/MA copolymer, or a<br>
combination thereof. Preservatives may also be used in this dermatological composition and<br>
preferably comprise about 0.05% to 0.5% by weight of the total composition.^The use of<br>
preservatives assures that if the product is microbially contaminated, the formulation will<br>
prevent or diminish microorganism growth. Some preservatives useful in this invention include<br>
methylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, chloroxylenol, sodium benzoate, DMDM<br>
Hydantoin, 3-Iodo-2-Propylbutyl carbamate, potassium sorbate, chlorhexidine digluconate, or a<br>
combination thereof.<br><br>
[0024] Titanium dioxide may be used as a sunscreen to serve as prophylaxis against<br>
photosensitization. Alternative sunscreens include methyl cinnamate. Moreover, BHA may be<br>
used as an antioxidant, as well as to protect ethoxydiglycol and/or dapsone from discoloration<br>
due to oxidation. An alternate antioxidant is BHT.<br>
[0025] In one embodiment, the dermatological composition that is applied includes<br>
0.5% to 4.0% carbomer and about 0.5% to 10% dapsone that exists in both a dissolved state and<br>
a microparticulate state. In another embodiment, the dermatological composition comprises<br>
about 1% carbomer, about 80-90% water, about 10% ethoxydiglycol, about 0.2%<br>
methylparaben, and about 0.3% to 3.0% dapsone including both microparticulate dapsone and<br>
dissolved dapsone, and about 2% caustic material. More particularly, the carbomer may include<br>
"CARBOPOL® 980" and the caustic material may include sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
[0026] In a preferred embodiment, the composition comprises dapsone and<br>
ethoxydiglycol, which allows for an optimized ratio of microparticulate drug to dissolved drug.<br>
This ratio determines the amount of drug delivered, compared to the amount of drug retained in<br>
or above the stratum comeum to function in the supracomeum domain. The system of dapsone<br>
and ethoxydiglycol may include purified water combined with "CARBOPOL®" gelling<br>
polymer, methylparaben, propylparaben, titanium dioxide, BHA, and a caustic material to<br>
neutralize the "CARBOPOL®."<br>
Dapsone Topical Cream or Lotion<br>
[0027] In another embodiment, dapsone may be applied as a topical cream or lotion in<br>
which dapsone is dissolved or dispersed or both partially dissolved and partially dispersed.<br>
Topical creams or lotions may be either oil-in-water emulsions or water-in-oil emulsions. The<br>
oil phase may include but is not limited to fatty alcohols, acids, or esters such as cetyl palmitate,<br>
cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, stearic acid, isopropyl stearate, glycerol stearate, mineral oil, white<br>
petrolatum, or other oils alone or in combination.<br>
[0028] Emulsifiers that may be added to the composition include, but are not limited to,<br>
steareth 20, ceteth 20, sorbitan sesquioleate, sorbitan mono-oleate, propylene glycol stearate,<br>
dosium lauroyl sarcosinate, polysorbate 60, or combination. Preservatives, antioxidants,<br>
fragrances, colorants, sunscreens, thickeners, and other additives required to achieve<br>
pharmaceutical or cosmetically acceptable or preferred product may also be included. However,<br>
topical creams and lotions are not limited to these components since one skilled in the art will be<br>
aware of additional components useful in the formulation of topical creams and lotions.<br>
Dapsone Topical Solution or Suspension,<br>
[0029) In another embodiment dapsone may be applied as a solution or suspension.<br>
These are fluid solvent or mixed-solvent systems including, but not limited to, water, ethanol,<br>
propylene glycol, glycerol, polyethylene glycol, ethyl acetate, propylene carbonate, n-methyl<br>
pyrolidone, triethanolamine, 1,4-butanediol, triacetin, diacetin, dimethyl isosorbide alone or in<br>
combination. Preservatives, antioxidants, fragrances, colorants, sunscreens, thickeners,<br>
suspending agents, enhancers, and other additives required to achieve pharmaceutically or<br>
cosmetically acceptable or preferred product may also be included. Again, topical solutions or<br>
suspensions are not limited to these components, since one skilled in the art will be aware of<br>
additional components useful in the formulation of topical solutions or suspensions.<br>
Other Dapsone Topical Formulations<br>
[0030] Dapsone may also be applied using a pharmaceutical or cosmetic carrier form<br>
such as an ointment, roll-on or stick product, micro-emulsion, shake powder, an aerosolized<br>
spray or mousse, a pump spray or mousse, or bath additive. Examples of ointments include<br>
essentially non-aqueous mixtures of petrolatum, lanolin, polyethylene glycol, plant or animal<br>
oils, either hydrogenated or otherwise chemically modified. An ointment may also contain a<br>
solvent in which dapsone is either folly or partially dissolved. Additional pharmaceutical<br>
carriers will be known to those skilled in the art and this list should not be considered to be<br>
limiting.<br>
METHOD FOR PREPARING THE DAPSONE DERMATOLOGICAL<br>
COMPOSITION<br>
[0031] The present invention also provides methods for preparing the dermatological<br>
compositions described above. In a general form, the method for producing a dermatological<br>
gel composition having dissolved dapsone and microparticulate dapsone precipitates comprises<br>
the steps of completely dissolving dapsone in a solvent or solvent mixture; adding and<br>
adequately dispersing a polymeric thickener in water; and combining the dissolved dapsone with<br>
the dispersed polymeric thickener. Alternatively, water may be slowly added to the dissolved<br>
dapsone, followed by the addition of a polymeric thickener. Ethoxydigylcol and l-methyl-2-<br>
pyrollidone are preferred solvents for use in the topically applied dermatological composition.<br><br>
[0032] In one preferred embodiment, the method for preparing a topically applied<br>
dermatological composition having dissolved and microparticulate dapsone comprises the steps<br>
of forming a homogenous dispersion by stirring purified water vigorously enough to form a<br>
vortex and sifting gel polymer into the vortex formed in the water while continuing to stir;<br>
forming a pharmaceutical component by dissolving methyl paraben and propylparaben in<br>
ethoxydiglycol by mixing to form a solution, and mixing dapsone with the solution until the<br>
pharmaceutical is dissolved; mixing the pharmaceutical component with the homogenous<br>
dispersion to form a microparticulate dapsone dispersion; and adding a caustic material.<br>
[0033] The order in which reagents are combined may be important, depending on the<br>
particular reagents necessary for the target mixture. For example, after a pharmaceutical such as<br>
dapsone is dissolved in a solvent such as ethoxydiglycol, water may be slowly added to the<br>
dapsone in the ethoxydiglycol solution, or the dapsone in ethoxydiglycol solution may be added<br>
to the water with mixing. Adding the dapsone in ethoxydiglycol solution to water may result in-<br>
less polydispersity in the size of the microparticulates than adding water to the dapsone in<br>
ethoxydiglycol solutions. The carbomer is generally dispersed in the water component of the<br>
formulation, while the remaining ingredients will be dissolved or dispersed in whichever of the<br>
two components are best for dissolving or dispersing the ingredient. For example, it is<br>
suggested to dissolve methylparaben, propylparaben, and BHA in ethoxydiglycol. After the<br>

SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS OF TOPICAL DAPSONE<br>
[0034] In one preferred embodiment of the invention, a method for treating acne is<br>
employed by topically applying dapsone. Specifically, the invention includes a method for<br>
reducing the number of non-inflammatory acne lesions by topically applying a dermatological<br>
composition comprising dapsone. Furthermore, in another embodiment, a method is provided<br>
for topically applying a dermatological composition having dapsone to prevent closed<br>
comedones (non-inflammatory acne) from becoming inflamed papules, pustules, or nodules.<br>
However, if the follicular canal ruptures, dapsone would also help to reduce the resultant<br>
inflammation. Typically, the dermatological composition having dapsone is applied once daily,<br>
but may be applied more frequently if desired.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0035] The following examples are provided to show that topically applied dapsone has<br>
unexpected therapeutic benefit in the treatment of non-inflammatory acne lesions. Dapsone was<br>
expected to reduce the degree of inflammation and the number of inflammatory lesions. The<br>
known mechanisms of dapsone activity did not anticipate an improvement in the number of<br>
non-inflammatory lesions.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0036] A 20-year-old white male applied 1 % dapsone topical gel once daily as part of<br>
an open label, pharmacokinetic clinical study. This patient had 115 non-inflammatory lesions<br>
(closed comedones) at baseline. The number of non-inflammatory lesions decreased to 103<br>
after seven days of treatment, 31 non-inflammatory lesions after 24 days, and 13 non-<br>
inflammatory lesions after 21 days of treatment with 1 % dapsone topical gel applied once daily.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0037] A four week, open label, dose-ranging study was completed in 18 - 39-year-old<br>
patients having mild to moderate acne. The number of pustules, papules, comedones, and<br>
nodules were counted at baseline and after 28 days of topical dapsone therapy for each patient.<br>
The number of papules, pustules, and nodules were combined to give the total number of<br>
inflammatory lesions while the number of comedones provided the total non-inflammatory<br>
lesion count. Four males and seven females applied 1% dapsone topical gel once daily; five<br>
males and seven females applied 1% dapsone topical gel twice daily; seven males and six<br>
females applied 5% dapsone topical gel once daily; and four males and eight females applied 5%<br>
dapsone topical gel twice daily. The average percent lesion reduction for each of the four<br>
dosage groups after 28 days of treatment is shown in Table 1. These results can be compared to<br>
a 0.1% Tretinoin cream. (FOI Services, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, releasable documents for<br>
ANDA 75-213). This maximum strength topical retinoid produced a 26% (test article) to 27%<br>
(reference article) reduction in non-inflammatory lesions after four weeks of treatment.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
[0038] Table 2 shows the results from a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-<br>
design study in which patients were randomized to receive either 3 % dapsone topical gel, 5%<br>
dapsone topical gel, or vehicle control once daily for 12 weeks. Inflammatory lesion counts<br>
include data from Portland, Cheery Creek, Orange County, and Denver Center clinical sites,<br>
with the number of patients being 20,15, and 18 for the 5% dapsone, 3% dapsone, and vehicle<br>
control groups respectively. Patients were male or female aged 13-years or older. This was the<br>
first study in which a vehicle control was used. Thus, any reduction in non-inflammatory lesions<br>
beyond about 13% is due to the effect of topical dapsone.<br>
[0039] Those skilled in the art will recognize that while specific embodiments have<br>
been illustrated and described, various modifications and changes may be made without it<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
