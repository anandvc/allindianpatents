FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods, compositions and therapeutic<br>
combinations for treating vascular conditions in mammals comprising blood<br>
modifier(s) and sterol absorption inhibitor(s).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Vascular disease is a term that broadly encompasses all disorders of blood vessels including small and large arteries and veins and blood flow. The most prevalent form of vascular disease is arteriosclerosis, a condition associated with the thickening and hardening of the arterial wall. Arteriosclerosis of the large vessels is referred to as atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the predominant underlying factor in vascular disorders such as coronary artery disease, aortic aneurysm, arterial disease of the lower extremities and cerebrovascular disease.<br>
One major risk factor for arteriosclerosis is high serum cholesterol. A total cholesterol level in excess of 225-250 mg/dl is associated with significant elevation of risk of vascular disease, particularly coronary heart disease.<br>
Cholesteryl esters are a major component of atherosclerotic lesions and the major storage form of cholesterol in arterial wall cells. Formation of cholesteryl esters is also a step in the intestinal absorption of dietary cholesterol. Thus, inhibition of cholesteryl ester formation and reduction of serum cholesterol can inhibit the progression of atherosclerotic lesion formation, decrease the accumulation of<br><br>
cholesteryl esters in the arterial wall, and block the intestinal absorption of dietary cholesterol.<br>
The regulation of whole-body cholesterol homeostasis in mammals and animals involves the regulation of dietary cholesterol and modulation of cholesterol biosynthesis, bile acid biosynthesis and the catabolism of the cholesterol-containing plasma lipoproteins. The liver is the major organ responsible for cholesterol biosynthesis and catabolism and, for this reason, it is a prime determinant of plasma cholesterol levels. The liver is the site of synthesis and secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) which are subsequently metabolized to low density lipoproteins (LDL) in the circulation. LDL are the predominant cholesterol-carrying lipoproteins in the plasma and an increase in their concentration is correlated with increased atherosclerosis. When intestinal cholesterol absorption is reduced, by whatever means, less cholesterol is delivered to the liver. The consequence of this action is decreased hepatic lipoprotein (VLDL) production and an increase in the hepatic clearance of plasma cholesterol, mostly as LDL. Thus, the net effect of inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption is a decrease in plasma cholesterol levels.<br>
U.S. Patents Nos. 5,767,115, 5,624,920, 5,668,990, 5,656,624 and 5,688,787, respectively, disclose hydroxy-substituted azetidinone compounds and substituted p-lactam compounds useful for lowering cholesterol and/or in inhibiting the formation of cholesterol-containing lesions in mammalian arterial walls. JJ.S. Patents Nos. 5,846,966 and 5,661,145, respectively, disclose hydroxy-substituted azetidinone compounds or substituted p-lactam compounds in combination with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors for preventing or treating atherosclerosis and reducing plasma cholesterol levels.<br>
PCT Patent Application No. WO 00/38725 discloses cardiovascular therapeutic combinations including an ileal bile acid transport inhibitor or cholesteryl ester transport protein inhibitor in combination with a fibric acid derivative, nicotinic acid derivative, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor, cholesterol absorption antagonist, phytosterol, stanol, antihypertensive agent or bile acid sequestrant.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,698,527 discloses ergostanone derivatives substituted with disaccharides as cholesterol absorption inhibitors, employed alone or in combination<br><br>
with certain other cholesterol lowering agents, which are useful in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and related disorders.<br>
Vascular conditions are often associated with thrombotic events sometimes resulting in myocardial infarction, stroke and ischemic attack. A thrombotic event is one associated with the formation or presence of a thrombus e.g.(blood clot), which results from an aggregation of blood factors, primarily platelets and fibrin with entrapment of cellular elements, frequently causing vascular obstruction at the point of its formation.<br>
Blood coagulation is a process consisting of a complex interaction of various blood components, or factors, which eventually gives rise to a fibrin clot. Generally, the blood components which participate in what has been referred to as the coagulation "cascade" are proenzymes or zymogens, enzymatically inactive proteins, which are converted to proteolytic enzymes by the action of an activator, itself an activated clotting factor. Coagulation factors that have undergone such a conversion are generally referred to as "active factors", and are designated by the addition of the letter "a" to the name of the coagulation factor (e.g. fVlla).<br>
Activated factor X (fXa) is required to convert prothrombin to thrombin, which then converts fibrinogen to fibrin as a final stage in forming a fibrin clot. There are two systems or pathways that promote the activation of factor X. The "intrinsic pathway" refers to those reactions that lead to thrombin formation through utilization of factors present only in plasma. A series of protease-mediated activations ultimately generates factor IXa, which, in conjunction with factor Villa, cleaves factor X into Xa. An identical proteolysis is effected by fVlla and its cofactor TF in the "extrinsic pathway" of blood coagulation. TF is a membrane bound protein and does not normally circulate in plasma. Upon vessel disruption, however, it is exposed and forms a complex with fVlla to catalyze factor X activation or factor IX activation in the presence of Ca2+ and phospholipid. While the relative importance of the two coagulation pathways in hemostasis is unclear, in recent years fVlla and TF have been found to play a pivotal role in the initiation and regulation of blood coagulation.<br>
FVII is a trace plasma glycoprotein that circulates in blood as a single-chain zymogen. The zymogen is catalytically inactive. Single-chain fVII may be converted to two-chain fVlla by factor Xa, factor Xlla, factor IXa, fVlla or thrombin in vitro. Factor<br><br>
Xa is believed to be the major physiological activator of A/I I. Like several other plasma proteins involved in hemostasis, fVIl is dependent on vitamin K for its activity which is required for the gamma-carboxylation of multiple glutamic acid residues that are clustered in the amino terminus of the protein. These gamma-carboxylated glutamic acids are required for the metal-associated interactions of fVIl with phospholipids.<br>
The conversion of zymogen fVIl into the activated two-chain molecule occurs by cleavage of an internal Arg152-lle 153 peptide bond. In the presence of TF, phospholipids and calcium ions, the two-chain fVlla rapidly activates factor X or factor IX by limited proteolysis.<br>
It is often desirable to selectively block or inhibit the coagulation cascade in a patient. Blood modifiers such as heparin, coumarin, derivatives of coumarin, indandione derivatives, thrombin inhibitors, factor Xa inhibitors, modified fVIl or other agents may be used.<br>
The use of drugs to modify blood is beneficial in a number of vascular disease states including atherosclerosis. Proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the vessel wall is an important event in the formation of vascular lesions in atherosclerosis, after vascular reconstruction or in response to other vascular injury. SMC proliferation typically occurs within the first few weeks and up to six months after injury.<br>
In about 30% or more of patients treated by angioplasty or bypass grafts, thrombosis and or SMC proliferation causes re-occlusion of the vessel. This closure of the vessel subsequent to surgery is known as restenosis.<br>
Modified FVlla has been shown to effectively suppress the restenosis process possibly as a result of a decreased procoagulant activity and thrombin generation initially afterjtreatment of the constricted vessel (see e.g. US Patent No. 5,639,739).<br>
Other blood modifiers have been used to treat thrombotic events associated with vascular conditions (see for example, WO 01/21/21259). Despite recent improvements in the treatment of vascular disease, there remains a need in the art for improved compositions and treatments.<br><br>

"Hemorrheologic agent" as used herein describes those compounds which improve the flow properties of blood by decreasing its viscosity. A suitable hemorrheologic agent of the present invention is pentoxifylline (1H-Purine-2,6-dione, 3,7-dihydro-3,7-dimethyl-1-(5-oxohexyi)- (9CI) (CA INDEX NAME) Theobromine, 1-(5-oxohexyl)- ,CAS Registry Number 6493-05-6 for example, TRENTALI® Tablets available from Aventis).<br>
Pentoxifylline and its metabolites (which can be useful in the present invention) improve the flow properties of blood by decreasing its viscosity. In patients with chronic peripheral arterial disease, this increases blood flow to the affected microcirculation and enhances tissue oxygenation. The precise mode of action of pentoxifylline and the sequence of events leading to clinical improvement are still to be defined. Pentoxifylline administration has been shown to produce dose-related hemorrheologic effects, lowering blood viscosity, and improving erythrocyte flexibility. Leukocyte properties of hemorrheologic importance have been modified in animal and in vitro human studies. Pentoxifylline has been shown to increase leukocyte deformability and to inhibit neutrophil adhesion and activation. Tissue oxygen levels<br><br>
have been shown to be significantly increased by therapeutic doses of pentoxifylline in patients with peripheral arterial disease.<br>
Lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor (LACI) is a serum glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 38,000 Kd useful as a blood modifier of the present invention It is also known as tissue factor inhibitor because it is a natural inhibitor of thromboplastin (tissue factor) induced coagulation (US Patent Nos., 5,110,730 and 5,106,833 described tissue factor and are hereby incorporated by reference their entireties). LACI is a protease inhibitor and has 3 Kunitz domains, two of which are known to interact with factors VII and Xa respectively, while the function of the third domain is unknown. Many of the structural features of LACI can be deduced because of its homology with other well studies proteases. LACI is not an enzyme, so it probably inhibits its protease target in a stoichiometric manner; namely, one of the domains of LACI inhibits one protease molecule (see US Patent No. 6,063,74 herein incorporated by reference).<br>

Also useful with the present invention are compositions or therapeutic combinations that can further comprise at least one (one or more) activators for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR). The activators act as agonists for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Three subtypes of PPAR have been identified, and these are designated as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARa), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARy) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR6). It should be noted that<br><br>
PPAR6 is also referred to in the literature as PPARp and as NUC1, and each of these names refers to the same receptor.<br>
PPARa regulates the metabolism of lipids. PPARa is activated by fibrates and a number of medium and long-chain fatty acids, and it is involved in stimulating p-oxidation of fatty acids. The PPARy receptor subtypes are involved in activating the program of adipocyte differentiation and are not involved in stimulating peroxisome proliferation in the liver. PPAR6 has been identified as being useful in increasing high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels in humans. See, e.g., WO 97/28149.<br>

Compositions and therapeutic combinations of the present invention having the above-described sterol absorption inhibitors are also useful for treating or preventing vascular inflammation or for reducing c-reactive protein levels in a mammal in need of such treatment. Vascular inflammation refers to arterial damage and bodily responses thereto. For example, choiesteryl esters are a major component of atherosclerotic lesions which results in vascular inflammation and an increase in plasma c-reactive protein levels. The inhibition of choiesteryl ester formation and reduction of serum cholesterol can inhibit the progression of atherosclerotic lesion formation, thereby treating or preventing vascular inflammation. Moreover, these sterol absorption inhibitors are useful lowering or controlling c-reactive protein blood levels in a mammal to less than about 3.4 mg/dL, desirably to less than 1.0 mg/dL, and more desirably to less than 0.4 mg/dL.<br>
Mixtures of any of the pharmacological or therapeutic agents described above can be used in the compositions and therapeutic combinations of these other embodiments of the present invention.<br>
The compositions and therapeutic combinations of the present invention can be administered to a mammal in need of such treatment in a therapeutically effective<br><br>
amount to treat vascular conditions such as vascular conditions. The compositions and treatments can be administered by any suitable means that produce contact of these compounds with the site of action in the body, for example in the plasma, liver or small intestine of a mammal.<br>
The daily dosage for the various compositions and therapeutic combinations described above can be administered to a patient in a single dose or in multiple subdoses, as desired. Subdoses can be administered 2 to 6 times per day, for example. Sustained release dosages can be used. Where the blood modifiers and sterol absorption inhibitor(s) are administered in separate dosages, the number of doses of each component given per day may not necessarily be the same, e.g., one component may have a greater duration of activity and will therefore need to be administered less frequently.<br>
The pharmaceutical treatment compositions and therapeutic combinations of the present invention can further comprise one or more pharmaceutical^ acceptable carriers, one or more excipients and/or one or more additives. Non-limiting examples of pharmaceutical^ acceptable carriers include solids and/or liquids such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. The amount of carrier in the treatment composition can range from about 5 to about 99 weight percent of the total weight of the treatment composition or therapeutic combination. Non-limiting examples of suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and additives include non-toxic compatible fillers, binders such as starch, disintegrants, buffers, preservatives, anti-oxidants, lubricants, flavorings, thickeners, coloring agents, emulsifiers and the like. The amount of excipient or additive can range from about 0.1 to about 90 weight percent of the total weight of the treatment composition or therapeutic combination. One skilled in the art would understand that the amount of carrier(s), excipients and additives (if present) can vary.<br>
The treatment compositions of the present invention can be administered in any conventional dosage form, preferably an oral dosage form such as a capsule, tablet, powder, cachet, suspension or solution. The formulations and pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared using conventional pharmaceutically acceptable and conventional techniques. Several examples of preparation of dosage formulations are provided below.<br><br>

Screen the dried granules and blend with Item No. 3 and the remainder of Item 5. Add Item No. 7 and mix. Compress the mixture to appropriate size and weight on a suitable tablet machine.<br>
For coadministration in separate tablets or capsules, representative formulations comprising a sterol absorption inhibitor such as are discussed above are well known in the art and representative formulations comprising a blood modifier such as are discussed above are well known in the art. It is contemplated that where the two active ingredients are administered as a single composition, the dosage forms disclosed above for sterol absorption inhibitor may readily be modified using the knowledge of one skilled in the art.<br><br>
Since the present invention relates to treating vascular conditions or reducing the plasma sterol (especially cholesterol) concentrations or levels or controlling properties of the blood, such as viscosity, by treatment with a combination of active ingredients wherein the active ingredients may be administered separately, the invention also relates to combining separate pharmaceutical compositions in kit form. That is, a kit is contemplated wherein two separate units are combined: a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one blood modifier and a separate pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one sterol absorption inhibitor as described above. The kit will preferably include directions for the administration of the separate components. The kit form is particularly advantageous when the separate components must be administered in different dosage forms (e.g., oral and parenteral) or are administered at different dosage intervals.<br>
The treatment compositions and therapeutic combinations of the present invention can inhibit the intestinal absorption of cholesterol in mammals, and can be useful in the treatment and/or prevention of vascular conditions, such as vascular inflammation, atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia and sitosterolemia, stroke, vascular conditions and lowering of plasma levels of cholesterol in mammals, in particular in humans.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the compositions and therapeutic combinations of the present invention can inhibit sterol absorption or reduce plasma concentration of at least one sterol selected from the group consisting of phytosterols (such as sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol and avenosterol), 5a-stanols (such as cholestanol, 5a-campestanol, 5a-sitostanol), cholesterol and mixtures thereof. The plasma concentration can be reduced by administering to a mammal in need of such treatment an effective amount of at least one treatment composition or therapeutic combination comprising at least one blood modifier and at least one sterol absorption inhibitor described above. The reduction in plasma concentration of sterols can range from about 1 to about 70 percent, and preferably about 10 to about 50 percent. Methods of measuring serum total blood cholesterol and total LDL cholesterol are well known to those skilled in the art and for example include those disclosed in PCT WO 99/38498 at page 11, incorporated by reference herein. Methods of determining levels of other sterols in serum are disclosed in H.<br><br>
