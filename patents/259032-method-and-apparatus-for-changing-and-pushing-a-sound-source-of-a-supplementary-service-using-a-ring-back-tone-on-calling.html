DESCRIPTION<br>
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CHANGING AND PUSHING A SOUND SOURCE OF A SUPPLEMENTARY SERVICE USING A RING BACK TONE ON CALLING<br>
5<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates, in general, to a method<br>
10   of changing the ringback tone replacing sound of a called<br>
party to the sound source of another supplementary service of<br>
a calling party using a dual tone multi-frequency shortcut<br>
key during the placing of a call, a method of changing the<br>
ringback tone replacing sound or service sound source {title<br>
15   song)  of the calling party to the sound source of the<br>
supplementary service of the called party,  a method of<br>
pushing the service sound source of the calling party as the<br>
service sound source of the called party in real time during<br>
the placing of a call, and apparatuses for performing the<br>
20   methods.	<br>
Background Art<br>
25 Generally, a ringback tone refers to a signal tone sent from an switching center to a calling terminal subscriber to inform the calling terminal subscriber that a calling signal is transmitting to a called terminal subscriber in a Public Switched Telephone Network(PSTN) or a mobile communication<br>
30 network. Recently, various ringback tone replacement services for replacing typical ringback tones represented by a conventional simple signal tone have been developed and used. For example, services, such as 2Ring, COLORing or FeelRing of Korea that allow a user to select a ringback tone<br>
35 replacing sound for replacing a ringback tone equally provided depending on the recommendations of the<br><br>
However, in a â€¢ conventional ringback tone replacement service, sound sources can be changed only when a user subscribes to a communication service provider having a corresponding sound source. In this way, various current 5 supplementary services, such as a ringback tone replacement service, a background music service, a ringer service, a Karaoke service, a music mail service and a Music-On-Demand (MOD) /Video-On-Demand (VOD) service, are limited in that a user can use the services only when he or she has subscribed<br>
10 to a communication service provider having corresponding sound sources. Further, there is an inconvenience in that, in order to change the sound sources of conventional supplementary services, a user should access the home page, wireless Internet or Automatic Response System (ARS) of a<br>
15 communication service provider providing supplementary services, and enter the phone number of a called party.<br>
Further, a conventional method of changing the sound sources of supplementary services is problematic in that, even when, for example, a calling party listens to the<br>
20 ringback tone replacing sound of a called party and is impressed thereby, the calling party cannot immediately set the sound source of his or her supplementary service, such as a ringback tone replacement service, to the sound source of the ringback tone replacing sound of the called party.<br>
25 Moreover, the conventional sound source change method for supplementary services is disadvantageous in that, since a supplementary service subscriber cannot change the sound sources of corresponding supplementary services in real time, the subscriber may forget that he or she will change a sound<br>
30 source later or forget the phone number of a called party, so that there may occur the case where he or she cannot change the sound sources of supplementary services.<br>
Further, communication services providing various pieces of information to mobile information terminals, such as the<br>
35 mobile phones of subscribers, through various channels have recently increased with the development of electrical.<br><br>
International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication (ITU-T), have been tremendously popularized. Such a ringback tone replacement service is described in detail below.<br>
First, if a calling terminal subscribes to a ringback 5 tone replacement service and requests a call connection to a called terminal managed by a called party's Mobile Switching Center (MSC), a calling party's MSC requests call termination location information (location request) from a Home Location Register (HLR). The HLR requests routing information<br>
10 (routing request) from the called party's MSC in response to the request for the call termination location information, received from the calling party's MSC. The called party's MSC transmits routing information (Temporary Local Directory Number: TLDN) to the HLR in response to the routing<br>
15 information request signal received from the HLR. Thereafter, the HLR transmits call termination location information to the calling party's MSC using the received routing information.<br>
The calling party's MSC requests an Integrated Services<br>
20 Digital Network (ISDN) User part (ISUP) call connection from the called party's MSC on the basis of the routing information. The called party's MSC reads ringback tone replacement service setting information, previously stored in a storage device, in response to the ISUP call connection<br>
25 request signal transmitted from the calling party's MSC. Thereafter, in the case where a user corresponding to the called terminal has subscribed to the ringback tone replacement service, the called party's MSC transmits the ISUP call connection request signal to a sound source control<br>
30 device, which is an Intelligent Peripheral (IP), through the Use of the previously stored routing information of the sound source control device. At this time, the ISUP call connection request signal includes a called terminal identifier and calling terminal identifier. As a result of<br>
35    the above procedure, channels are established between the<br><br>
calling party's MSC, the called party's MSC and a sound<br>
-source providing, device. <br>
The sound source providing device requests a sound source code from a sound source proving control server, which 5 is a Service Control Point (SCP), on the basis of the called terminal identifier and calling terminal identifier. After the sound source providing control server searches for a sound source code, stored in connection with the called terminal identifier or the calling terminal identifier, in<br>
10 response to the sound source code request signal, and transmits the searched sound source code to the sound source providing device. Thereafter, the sound source providing device transmits a ringback tone replacing sound corresponding to the sound source code, received from the<br>
15 sound source providing control server, to the calling terminal through the established channel. When recognizing that the called terminal answers during the transmission of the ringback tone replacing sound to the calling terminal, the called party's MSC requests the sound source providing<br>
20 device to release the ISUP call. After receiving the ISUP call release request signal from the called party's MSC, the sound source providing device releases a channel established with the calling terminal. Thereafter, the called terminal performs normal communication using a channel established<br>
25   with the calling terminal.<br>
As described above, a conventional ringback tone replacement service allows a called terminal subscriber to let a calling terminal subscriber listen to a ringback tone replacing sound that is selected by the called terminal<br>
30 subscriber and replaces a typical uniform ringback tone, through the use of the ringback tone replacement service. The reason that such a ringback tone replacement service commercially achieves success would be the fact that the service satisfies the desires of modern people for expressing<br>
35   their individualities to some degree.<br><br>
electronic   and   communication   fields.    . Under   such environments, communication service providers. provide supplementary services, such as a ringback tone replacement service, a background music service, a ringer service, a 5   Karaoke service, a music mail service and a VOD/MOD service, to subscribers to comply with the demands of the subscribers desiring to use communication services more interestedly and individually.  Recently, these supplementary services have been spotlighted by subscribers.<br>
10 For example, a subscriber can wait for the establishment of a channel without tediousness while listening to an individual ringback tone replacing sound set by a calling party or called party, instead of a simple ringback tone, during the placing of a call. Further, the subscriber may<br>
15 freely register the popular songs of singers, popular sound effects and mentions, classical music, his or her own sound effects, etc., and use them as his or her ringers. Further, the subscriber may select a desired song or music as a background sound, and then talks to an opposite party while<br>
20 listening to the background sound during telephone conversation. In this way, conventional supplementary services allow the subscriber to more individually and interestedly use various communication services using the sound sources of the supplementary services selected by the<br>
25    subscriber.<br>
However, in the conventional supplementary services, sound sources can be changed only when a user subscribes to a communication service provider having a corresponding sound source. That is, various current supplementary services,<br>
30 such as a ringback tone replacement service, a background music service, a ringer service, a Karaoke service, a music mail service and a Music-On-Demand (MOD)/Video-On-Demand (VOD) service, are limited in that a user can use the services only when he or she has subscribed to a<br>
35 communication service provider having corresponding sound sources. Further, there is an inconvenience in that, in<br><br>
order  to  change  the  sound  sources  of  conventional<br>
supplementary services, a user should access the home page,<br>
wireless Internet or Automatic Response System (ARS) of a communication  service  provider  providing  supplementary 5   services, and enter the phone number of a called party.<br>
Further, a conventional method of changing the sound sources of supplementary services is problematic in that, even when, for example, a calling party listens to the ringback tone replacing sound of a called party and is<br>
10 impressed thereby, the calling party cannot immediately set the sound source of his or her supplementary service, such as a ringback tone replacement service, to the sound source of the ringback tone replacing sound of the called party. Moreover, the conventional sound source change method for<br>
15 supplementary services is disadvantageous in that, since a supplementary service subscriber cannot change the sound sources of corresponding supplementary services in real time, the subscriber may forget that he or she will change a sound source later or forget the phone number of a called party, so<br>
20 that the subscriber cannot easily change the sound sources of supplementary services at a desired time. Moreover, the conventional supplementary services are disadvantageous in that a calling party cannot immediately push his or her service sound source as the service sound source of a called<br>
25 party in real time while the calling party listens to the ringback tone replacing sound of the called party.<br>

FIG. 3 is a view showing a service of allowing a calling<br>
20 party to set the souna source of his or her supplementary service to the sound source of the ringback tone replacing sound of a called party using a DTMF shortcut key during the placing of a call according to a first embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 4 is a signal flowchart showing the<br>
25 signal processing method of the service according to a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, if the calling party places a call to a called party who has subscribed to a ringback tone replacement service, the calling party receives the<br>
30 ringback tone replacing sound of the called party depending on a ringback tone replacement service scenario at step 401. At this time, if the calling party is impressed thereby the ringback tone replacing sound of the called party and desires to change the ringback tone replacing sound to his or her own<br>
35 service sound source, the calling party presses a DTMF shortcut key for the service sound source on a calling<br><br>
terminal at step 403.  The service IP server detects the   corresponding shortcut key  and transmits information on a<br>
calling party phone number (calling party Mobile Identification Number: MIN), a called party phone number 5 (called party MIN), a ringback tone replacing sound code and a DTMF shortcut key, which the service IP server collects for a current service, to the service providing system at step 405. The shortcut key for the service sound source is preset in such a way that, for example, 1# is used to change a<br>
10 ringback tone replacing sound, 2# is used to change background music, 3# is used to change a ringer, 4% is used to change a music mail, 5# is used to change MOD, and 6# is used to change VOD. Further, the service providing system includes a gateway (G/W) as the service providing apparatus<br>
15   of the present invention.<br>
Next, the service providing system analyzes data received from the service IP server. That is, after analyzing at least the DTMF shortcut key, the service providing system transmits subscriber information and sound<br>
20 source information to the ringback tone replacement service MCP so as to detect the sound source information of the called party, for example, the name of a singer and the title of a song at step 407. The ringback tone replacement service MCP extracts the name of the singer name and the title of the<br>
25 song corresponding to the ringback tone replacing sound code and transmits the extracted information to the service providing system at step 409.<br>
The service providing system requests a sound source code, which will be used for a supplementary service whose<br>
30 sound source is to be adopted in response to the request of the calling party and which corresponds to the name of the singer and the title of the song, from the CP server interworking with the service providing system to perform the service of the present invention at step 411. In response to<br>
35 the request, the CP server extracts the sound source code and transmits the extracted sound source code to the service<br><br>
providing system at step 413. The service providing system<br>
 requests a cprresponding suppleinentary service providing MCP<br>
that provides the supplementary service of the calling party<br>
to set and change a sound source using the received sound<br>
5   source code at step 415.<br>
The supplementary service providing MCP, having received the sound source change request signal from the service providing system, changes service setting information set with respect to the calling party at step 417. At this time,<br>
10 if the service to be changed is a ringback tone replacement service, the supplementary service providing MCP requests the SCP to change the sound source of the ringback tone replacing sound of the calling party at step 419. Thereafter, the service providing system may notify the calling party of the<br>
15 sound source change results using SMS, as shown in FIG. 3 (10). If the calling party does not subscribe to the corresponding service yet, the service providing system may request the WISE (CS) to register the calling party as a new subscriber, allow the calling party to automatically<br>
20 subscribe to the corresponding service, and notify the calling party of sound source change results together with the subscription contents thereof. After a telephone conversation, the calling party accesses the ARS using a callback number or URL address included in an SMS message to<br>
25 subscribe to the service, listen to the sound source, and confirm the change of the sound source (11) .<br>
FIG. 5 is a signal flowchart showing the signal processing method of the service according to a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
30 Referring to FIG. 5, if the CP server is constructed to include a plurality of MCP functions of providing respective supplementary services, the present invention can provide the service through a simplified procedure compared to the above-described embodiment. In detail, if the calling party places<br>
35 a call to a called party, who has subscribed to a ringback tone replacement service, the calling party receives the<br><br>
ringback tone replacing sound of the called party depending <br>
			on a ringback tone replacement service scenario at Step 501<br>
At this time, if the calling party is impressed thereby the ringback tone replacing sound of the called party and desires 5 to change the ringback tone replacing sound to his or her supplementary service sound source, the calling party presses a DTMF shortcut key for the service sound source on a calling terminal at step 503. The service IP server detects the corresponding shortcut key, and transmits information on a<br>
10 calling party phone number (calling party MIN), a called party phone number (called party MIN), a ringback tone replacing sound code and a DTMF shortcut key, which the service IP server collects for a current service, to the service providing system at step 505.<br>
15 The service providing system detects a service request from the calling party by analyzing data received from the service IP server. Thereafter, the service providing system transmits subscriber information and sound source information to the CP server that provides the service of the present<br>
20 invention while interworking with the service providing system at step 507. At this time, the CP server recognizes the received information as a sound source change request signal for the specific supplementary service of the calling party, and changes the service setting information for the<br>
25 specific supplementary service of the calling party at step 509. If the service requested to be changed by the calling party is the ringback tone replacement service, the CP server requests the SCP to change the sound source of the ringback tone replacing sound of the calling party at step 511.<br>
30 Thereafter, the service providing system notifies the calling party of the sound source change results using SMS at step 513. If the calling party does not subscribe to the ringback tone replacement service yet, the service providing system may request the WISE (CS) to register the calling party as a<br>
35 new subscriber, allow the calling party to automatically subscribe to the corresponding service, and notify the<br><br>
calling party, of sound source change results together with 			the subscription. contents thereof using. SMS, as descrabed in the above-embodiment. After a telephone conversation, the calling party accesses the ARS using a callback number or URL 5   address included in an SMS message to subscribe to the service, 1isten to the sound source, and confirm the change of the sound source.<br>
As described above, the service providing system according to the first embodiment of the present invention<br>
10 receives sound source information, such as the name of a singer and the title of a song, from the above-described ringback tone replacement service MCP, requests and obtains a sound source code corresponding to the sound source information from the CP server providing the present service.<br>
15 Thereafter, the service providing system extracts the corresponding sound source code from the CP server and changes the service setting information without requesting the above-described supplementary service providing MCP to change a sound source, thus providing the service of the<br>
20 present invention. At this time, the CP server includes the sound source information of respective ringback tone replacement service MCPs, and the service providing function of the supplementary service providing MCP. Especially, the CP server includes a mapping table formed to allow the sound<br>
25 source codes of various supplementary services, provided from the supplementary service providing MCPs, to refer to each other through the use of the sound source codes corresponding to ringback tone replacing sounds provided from the ringback tone replacement service MCP. The information in the mapping<br>
30   table is periodically updated by the respective MCPs.<br>
FIG. 6 is a signal flowchart showing the signal processing method of the service according to a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, if the CP server is constructed to<br>
35 include a plurality of MCP functions of providing respective supplementary services, the present invention can provide the<br><br>
service through a simplified procedure compared to the above-described embodiment. In detail, if a calling party places a call to a called party, who has subscribed to the ringback tone replacement service, the calling party receives the 5 ringback tone replacing sound of the called party depending on a ringback tone replacement service scenario at step 601. At this time, if the calling party is impressed thereby the ringback tone replacing sound of the called party and desires to change the ringback tone replacing sound to his or her own<br>
10 service sound source, the calling party presses a DTMF shortcut key for the service sound source on a calling terminal at step 603. The service IP server detects the corresponding shortcut key, and transmits information on a calling party phone number (calling party MIN), a called<br>
15 party phone number (called party MIN), a ringback tone replacing sound code and a DTMF shortcut key, which the service IP server collects for a current service, to the service providing system at step 605,<br>
The service providing system requests a sound source<br>
20 code, which will be used for a supplementary service whose sound source is to be changed, from the CP server that provides the service of the present invention while interworking with the service providing system at step 607. At this time, the CP server extracts a sound source code from<br>
25 a mapping table by applying the subscriber information and the ringback tone replacing sound code, received from the service providing system, to the mapping table, and then transmits the sound source code to the service providing system at step 609. Further, the service providing system<br>
30 requests the supplementary service providing MCP that provides the supplementary service requested to be changed by the calling party to change the sound source using the received sound source code at step 611.<br>
The supplementary service providing MCP, having received<br>
35 the sound source change request signal from the service providing system, changes service setting information set<br><br>
with respect to the calling party at step 613. At this time, if the sound source to be changed is a ringback tone replacing sound source, the supplementary service providing MCP requests the SCP to change the sound source of the 5 ringback tone replacing sound of the calling party at step 615. Thereafter, the service providing system may notify the calling party of the sound source change results using SMS. If the calling party does not subscribe to the corresponding service yet, the service providing system may request the<br>
10 WISE (CS) to register the calling party as a new subscriber, allow the calling party to automatically subscribe to the corresponding service, and notify the calling party of sound source change results together with the subscription contents thereof using SMS, as described in the above-described<br>
15 embodiments. After a telephone conversation, the calling party accesses the ARS using a callback number or URL address included in an SMS message to subscribe to the service, listen to the sound source, and confirm the change of the sound source.<br>
20 As described above, the service providing system according to the first embodiment of the present invention may be adapted to request and obtain subscriber information and a sound source code corresponding to the ringback tone replacing sound code of the called party from the CP server<br>
25 and then request the supplementary service providing MCP to change the sound source, without receiving sound source information, such as the name of a singer and the title of a song, from the above-described ringback tone replacement service MCP. At this time, the CP server includes the sound<br>
30 source information of respective ringback tone replacement service MCPs. Especially, the CP server includes a mapping table adapted to map the sound source codes of various supplementary services, provided from the supplementary service providing MCPs, through the use of subscriber<br>
35 information and the ringback tone replacing sound codes provided from the ringback tone replacement service MCPs.<br><br>
The information in the mapping table is periodically updated<br>
								by at least MCPs provided in called and calling, party Sides<br>
FIG. 7 is a view showing the CP server according to a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>

conversion of sound source codes shown in Table 1, thus<br>
enabling, for example, a calling party to use the ringback<br>
tone replacing sound of a called party as the supplementary<br>
service sound source of the calling party while interworking<br>
25   with  the  service  providing  system,  the  ringback  tone<br>
replacement  service  MCP  and  the  supplementary  service<br>
providing MCPs.<br><br>
FIG;  8  is  a  signal  flowchart  showing  the  signal<br>
 	 processing method of the service of allowing a callings party to set the supplementary service sound source of a called party to the ringback tone replacing sound source of the 5 calling party or a title song, designated by the calling party through a Web/WAP (ME) or ARS, through the use of a DTMF shortcut key during the placing of a call using a mobile phone according to a first embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 9 is a diagram showing the processing method<br>
10 of the service according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, there is described a method of allowing a calling party to gift his or her preset sound source or ringback tone replacing sound to a called party as the sound source of the supplementary service of the called<br>
15   party during the placing of a call.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 8 and 9, if the calling party places a call to a called party, who has subscribed to a ringback tone replacement service, the calling party receives the ringback tone replacing sound depending on the ringback tone<br>
20 replacement service scenario of the called party at step 801. At this time, the calling party presses a DTMF shortcut key for the service sound source on a calling terminal when desiring to gift his or her preset specific sound source (hereinafter referred to as a "title song") or ringback tone<br>
25 replacing sound to a called party as the sound source of the supplementary service of the called party at step 803. For example, DTMF shortcut keys for service sound sources may include a shortcut key "*+l" for a gift of a ringback tone replacing sound, a shortcut key "*+2" for a gift of<br>
30 background music, a shortcut key "*+3" for the gift of a ringer sound source, a shortcut key "*+4" for the gift of a music mail sound source, a shortcut key "*+5" for the gift of a MOD sound source, and a shortcut key "*+6" for the gift of a VOD sound source.<br>
35 If the shortcut key for the service sound source is input from the calling terminal, the service IP server<br><br>
detects  the  corresponding shortcut  key, and  transmits  information  on a palling party phone number (calling party MIN), a called party phone number (called party MIN), a ringback tone replacing sound code and a DTMF shortcut key, 5   which the service IP server collects for the current ringback tone replacement service, to the service providing system at step 805.  The service providing system includes a gateway (G/W)  as the service providing apparatus of the present invention.<br>
10 The service providing system requests the registration of a gift while requesting first service information including the title song information of the calling party from the CP server that interworks with the service providinq system to provide the present service at step 807. Further,<br>
15 the service providing system receives the first service information from the CP server at step 809. If the title song of the calling party is registered, the service providing system notifies the called party of the request for the setting of the sound source using SMS at step 811.<br>
20 If the title song of the calling party is not registered, the service providing system transmits calling party information to the ringback tone replacement service MCP of the calling party, and receives the name of a singer and the title of a song corresponding to the ringback tone<br>
25 replacing sound from the ringback tone replacement service MCP at steps 813 and 815. Further, the service providing system requests the registration of a gift while requesting second service information including a sound source code corresponding to the name of a singer and the title of a song<br>
30 to be used for the gift service from the CP server at step 817. Further, the service providing system receives the second service information from the CP server at step 819. Thereafter, the service providing system notifies the called party of a setting request for a gift of the sound source<br>
35 using SMS at step 821. The called party accesses the CP ARS to listen to, set and change the sound source at steps 823<br><br>
H<br>
and 825. At this time, if, for example, the called party is<br>
 								a non-subscriber. to the. ringback. tone replacement service, the called party may subscribe to the service depending on the guidance of the CP ARS.<br>
5  As described above, the calling terminal subscriber gifts his or her title song or ringback tone replacing sound to the called party as the sound source of the supplementary service of the called party through the above procedure. That is, the service providing system of the present<br>
10 invention prepares the setting of the sound source of the specific supplementary service of the called party to correspond to the service request shortcut key of the calling terminal subscriber. The called party can access the service providing system through the CP ARS to more<br>
15 conveniently set the sound source of the specific supplementary service of the called party to the sound source gifted from the calling party. Further, if the called party is a non-subscriber to the service, the called party can conveniently subscribe to the service depending on the<br>
20 guidance of the accessed CP ARS. In the meantime, if communication service providers to which the calling party and the called party subscribe are different, there should be interworking therebetween. This case is described in detail below.<br>
25 FIG. 10 is a diagram showing a service of allowing a calling party to set the sound source of his or her supplementary service to the sound source of the ringback tone replacing sound of a called party having subscribed to another communication network using a DTMF shortcut key<br>
30 during the placing of a call using a mobile phone according to a first embodiment of the present invention. For ease of understanding of this embodiment, numerals (1) to (11) are expressed in FIG. 10.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, if the calling party places a call<br>
35 to a called party, who has subscribed to a ringback tone replacement service, the calling party listens to the<br><br>
ringback tone replacing sound of the called party depending<br>
 					on a ringback tone replacement service -scenario At this<br>
time, if the calling party is impressed thereby the ringback<br>
tone replacing sound of the called party and desires to<br>
5   change the ringback tone replacing sound to his or her own<br>
service sound source,  the calling party presses a DTMF<br>
shortcut key for the service sound source contracted between<br>
mobile communication service providers on a calling terminal,<br>
for example, "1#" used to change a ringback tone replacing<br>
10 sound (1) . Then, the service IP server in a communication service provider network (a first communication service provider network), to which the called party subscribes, detects the corresponding shortcut key (2) . The service IP server transmits information on a calling party phone number<br>
15 (calling party MIN), a called party phone number (called party MIN), a ringback tone replacing sound code, and a DTMF shortcut key, which the service IP server collects for a current service, to a first service providing system in the first communication service provider network (3).<br>
20 Next, the first service providing system, having received the collected information from the service IP server, analyzes the information (DTMF key analysis) and transmits the analyzed results to the ringback tone replacement MCP (a first MCP) of the called party (4). The<br>
25 first MCP extracts the name of a singer and the title of a song of the corresponding ringback tone replacing sound code, and transmits the extracted information to the first service providing system. Thereafter, the first service providing system transmits the collected information (for example,<br>
30 calling party/called party information including calling party MIN/called party MIN) and the singer name and song title corresponding to the ringback tone replacing sound of the called party to a second service providing system in a communication service provider network (a second<br>
35 communication service provider network) to which the calling party subscribes (5).<br><br>
Next the second service providing . system transmits<br>
					information indicating, whether the calling party Subscribes<br>
to the corresponding service and sound source information to the second MCP while interworking with a corresponding 5 service MCP (for example, the ringback tone replacement MCP of the calling party: a second MCP), thus requesting a sound source code corresponding to the name of a singer and the title of a song for the ringback sound replacing sound of the called party from the second MCP (6) . The second service<br>
10 providing system transmits sound source information, including the sound source code corresponding to the singer name and the song title, to the CP server in the second communication service provider network, and receives a new sound source code to be used for the supplementary service of<br>
15 the calling party from the CP server (7) . Thereafter, the second service providing system requests the second MCP to change the service sound source using the calling party information and the received new sound source code (8) . If the calling party is a non-subscriber to the service, the<br>
20 service providing system allows the calling party to automatically subscribe to the ringback tone replacement service. Further, the second MCP requests the SCP server to change the sound source of the calling terminal subscriber (9) . Further, the second service providing system notifies<br>
25 the calling terminal of the sound source change results using SMS after transmitting billing information to the IDR server for billing processing (10) . If the calling party does not subscribe to the corresponding service yet, the second service providing system allows the calling party to<br>
30 automatically subscribe to the service, and then notifies the calling terminal of subscription contents together with sound source change contents using SMS. Then, the calling party accesses the CP ARS after a telephone conversation to listen to the sound source and confirm the change of the sound<br>
35    source.<br><br>
FIG. 11 is a diagram showing a service: of allowing a<br>
				calling party to  gift his or her  preset title song or<br>
ringback tone replacing sound to a called party,  having subscribed  to  another  communication  network,  as  the 5   supplementary service sound source of the called party through the use of a DTMF shortcut key during the placing of a call using a mobile phone according to a first embodiment of the present invention.  For ease of understanding of this embodiment, numerals (1) to (13) are expressed in FIG. 11. 10<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, if the calling party places a call<br>
to a called party having subscribed to a ringback tone<br>
replacement service, the calling party receives the ringback<br>
tone replacing sound of the called party depending on a<br>
15   ringback tone replacement service scenario.   In the case<br>
4<br>
where the calling party desires to gift a specific sound source, such as a title song set through the Web/ME (WAP) or ARS by the calling party, or a ringback tone replacing sound to the called party as a supplementary service sound source,<br>
20 the calling party presses a shortcut key for a service sound source on a calling terminal, for example, "1*" to change a ringback tone replacing sound (1) . Then, a first service IP server in a communication service provider network (a first communication service provider network), to which the called<br>
25 party subscribes, detects the corresponding shortcut key (2). The first service IP server transmits information on a calling party phone number (calling party MIN), a called party phone number (called party MIN), and a ringback tone replacing sound code, which the first service IP server<br>
30 collects for a current service, to a first service providing system in the first communication service provider network (3) .<br>
Next, the first service providing system transmits the data received from the first service IP server to a second<br>
35 service providing system in a communication service provider network (a second communication service provider network) to<br><br>
which the calling, party subscribes (4). The second service 					 providing system requests and receives the information of the<br>
title song of the calling party from a second CP server in the second communication service provider network (5) .If 5 the title song of the calling party is registered, the second service providing system transmits the sound source information of the calling party to the first service providing system (7).<br>
Next, the first service providing system requests the<br>
10 title song information of the calling party and the registration of a gift from the first CP server in the first communication service provider network, and receives the sound source code of a corresponding sound source (8). Further, the first service providing system notifies the<br>
15   called party of a message indicating the setting request for the sound source or the receipt of the gift of the sound source  using  SMS  (9).   Thereafter,  the  first  service providing system transmits information, indicating that the gift of the sound source has been given, to the second<br>
20 service providing system (10). The called party having received the SMS message accesses the CP ARS in the first communication service provider network to subscribe to the service and listen to and set the sound source (11).<br>
In the meantime, after the procedure (5) , if the title<br>
25 song of the calling party is not registered, the second service providing system transmits calling party information to the calling party's MCP in the second communication service provider network, and then receives the name of a singer and the title of a song corresponding to the ringback<br>
30 tone replacing sound of the calling party (6). Further, the second service providing system transmits the sound source information, including the name of the singer and the title of the song, to the CP server in the second communication service provider network and then receives a sound source<br>
35 code to be used for the supplementary service. Thereafter, the second service providing system requests the calling<br><br>
party' s MCP to change the sound source using the calling party information and the received, sound  source code Next procedures (7) to (11) are performed in the same manner as those of the above-embodiment.<br>
5 Further, if the supplementary service of the called party requested by the calling party at the above procedure (8) is a ringback tone replacement service, the first CP server requests the called party's MCP, that is, the ringback tone replacement MCP of the called party side in this case,<br>
10 to set/change the sound source of the ringback tone replacement sound of the called party (12). Then, the called party's MCP requests the first SCP server in the first communication service provider network to set/change the sound source of the ringback tone replacing sound of the<br>
15   called party.<br>
FIG. 12 is a signal flowchart showing a subscription procedure for a sound source change service according to a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
 Referring to FIG. 12, if a calling terminal subscriber<br>
20 requests a subscription to the communication supplementary service of the present invention (sound source change service) at step 1201, information indicating whether the calling terminal subscriber subscribes to the service may be stored in a subscriber database (DB). Thereafter, the<br>
25    subscriber DB transmits service subscription information, including at least calling terminal identifier provided from the calling terminal subscriber when subscribing to the sound source change service, to a Home Location Register (HLR) at step 1203.  The HLR sets the sound source change service in<br>
30 the profile of a corresponding calling terminal subscriber on the basis of the received service subscription information at step 1205. Further, the subscriber DB transmits the subscriber information of the calling terminal subscriber, who has applied for the sound source change service of the<br>
35 present invention, to the service providing apparatus at step 1207. The service providing apparatus sets a sound source<br><br>
	change service code using the received subscriber information<br>

30 sound of the called party, and a shortcut key "6+#" used to change the sound source of VOD to the sound source of the ringback tone replacing sound of the called party.<br>
Further, the calling terminal subscriber sets shortcut keys used to set the sound source change service or to gift a<br>
35 sound source on or to the called terminal of an opposite party. That is, the calling terminal subscriber sets the<br><br>
shortcut keys to use them for a service of gifting the title<br>
 song or ringback tone replacing sound of the calling terminal subscriber to the called party as at least one supplementary service sound source of the called party (hereinafter 5 referred to as a "second sound source change service"). For example, the shortcut keys for the second sound source change service include a shortcut key "1+*" used to set the sound source of the ringback tone replacing sound of the called party to the sound source of the title song or ringback tone<br>
10 replacing sound of the calling party, a shortcut key "2+*" used to set the sound source of the ringer of the called party to the sound source of the title song or ringback tone replacing sound of the calling party, a shortcut key "3+*" used to set the sound source of the background music of the<br>
15 called party to the sound source of the title song or ringback tone replacing sound of the calling party, a shortcut key "4+*" used to set the sound source of the music mail of the called party to the sound source of the title song or ringback tone replacing sound of the calling party, a<br>
20 shortcut key "5+*" used to set the sound source of MOD of the called party to the sound source of the title song or ringback tone replacing sound of the calling party, and a shortcut key "6+*" used to set the sound source of VOD of the called party to the sound source of the title song or<br>
25   ringback tone replacing sound of the calling party.<br>
As described above, the present invention defines the DTMF shortcut keys on the calling terminal so as to use the sound source change services. In the meantime, such a shortcut key may be added or changed depending on the<br>
30 definition of the services. The above-described supplementary services include at least one supplementary service, to which the calling or called terminal subscriber subscribes through at least one specific communication service provider. The setting information for the<br>
35 supplementary services may be stored in the database of a corresponding contents provider or master contents provider,<br><br>
or a database, system, such as SCP. For example, the 		supplementary rservice setting information is set with respect to the calling or called terminal subscriber, as shown in Table 2.<br><br>

FIG 17 is a signal flowchart showing the subscription<br>
	 procedure of the sound. source push service according to a<br>
second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 17, if a calling terminal user 5 requests a subscription to the supplementary service of the present invention (sound source push service) at step 1701, whether the calling terminal user subscribes to the service is stored in the subscriber database DB. Thereafter, the subscriber DB transmits service subscription information<br>
10 including at least calling terminal identifier, provided from the calling terminal user when subscribing to the sound source push service, to a Home Location Register (HLR) at step 1703. The HLR sets the sound source push service on the profile of the corresponding calling terminal subscriber on<br>
15 the basis of the received service subscription information at step 1705. Further, the subscriber DB transmits the subscriber information of the calling terminal subscriber, having applied for the sound source push service of the present invention, to the service providing apparatus at step<br>
20 1707. Further, the service providing apparatus sets a sound source push service code using the received subscriber information at step 1709. The sound source push service code corresponds to at least one piece of subscriber information set by the user. As described above, the calling terminal<br>
25 user can subscribe to the present service through the wired/wireless Internet, the ARS, an agency/customer center, etc. and then push his or her service sound source as the service sound source of a called party.<br>
FIG. 18 is a signal flowchart of a process of setting a<br>
30 service sound source in the sound source push service according to a second embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, a procedure of automatically subscribing to the present service is described.<br>
Referring to FIG. 18, while listening to the ringback<br>
35 tone replacing sound of a called party after calling the called party at step 1801, a calling party presses a DTMF<br><br>
shortcut key on a calling terminal so as to push his or her<br>
				set supplementary service sound source as the sound source of<br>
a supplementary service preset by the called party.  At this<br>
time, the DTMF shortcut key signal of the calling terminal is<br>
5   transmitted to a service IP server through a MSC in a<br>
communication network at step 1803.  The service IP server<br>
recognizes the received DTMF signal as an intelligent network<br>
service call, and detects the DTMF shortcut key signal at<br>
step 1805.   Thereafter,  the service IP server transmits<br>
10 collected information, including a calling terminal identifier corresponding to a calling terminal, a called terminal identifier corresponding to a called terminal, sound source information for the ringback tone replacing sound, and the DTMF shortcut key information, to the service providing<br>
15   system at step 1807.<br>
The service providing system requests from the CP server information, indicating whether the supplementary service sound source selected through the push service by the calling party exists, and the supplementary service sound source at<br>
20 step 1809. In this case, the CP server includes the service providing MCP system that provides the service according to the second embodiment of the present invention. The CP server searches the subscriber database for information indicating whether the calling and called parties subscribe<br>
25 to the present service through the use of data including the subscriber information of the calling terminal identifier and the called terminal identifier, received from the service providing system, at step 1811. If the calling or called party does not subscribe to the present service, the CP<br>
30 server requests the WISE (Customer care System: CS) of a communication service provider to allow the calling or called party to subscribe to the service at step 1813. Further, the CP server responds to the request from the service providing system at step 1815.<br>
35 As described above, in the present invention, the service providing system automatically performs a service<br><br>
subscription procedure even though the calling or called<br>
				party does not subscribe to the present service yet Through the above procedure, the calling party can push his or her at least one supplementary service sound source or ringback tone 5 replacing sound source, or a basic sound source provided from the present service provider, as at least one supplementary service sound source of the called party through the wired/wireless Internet of the Web/WAP (ME) and the ARS, or compulsorily set at least one supplementary service sound<br>
10 source of the called party to at least one service sound source of the calling party.<br>
FIG. 19 is a view showing the definition of shortcut keys for the sound source push service according to a second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
15 Referring to FIG. 19, the calling terminal subscriber uses shortcut keys on a calling terminal so as to push the sound source of his or her supplementary services, such as a title song, ringback tone replacing sound, ringer, background music, music mail, MOD and VOD, as at least one supplementary<br>
20 service sound source of the called party. For example, if sound sources set by the calling party correspond to service types, that is, if the calling party respectively sets the service sound sources, such as the ringback tone replacing sound source, ringer sound source, and background music sound<br>
25 source, the shortcut keys for the sound source push service may be used in such a way that a shortcut key "1+*" is used to set the ringback tone replacing sound source of the called party to the ringback tone replacing sound source of the calling party, a shortcut key "2+*" is used to set the ringer<br>
30 sound source of the called party to the ringer sound source of the calling party, a shortcut key "3+*" is used to set the background music sound source of the called party to the background music sound source of the calling party, a shortcut key "4+*" is used to set the music mail sound source<br>
35 of the called party to the music mail sound source of the calling party, a shortcut key "5+*" is used to set the MOD<br><br>
sound source of the called party to the MOD sound source of the calling party and  a shortcut key "6+*"  is used to set the VOD sound source of the called party to the VOD sound source of the calling party.<br>
5 Further, if the service sound source (title song) set^by the calling party is composed of a single sound source or if the calling party uses his or her ringback tone replacing sound as the title song (service sound source) without setting the service sound source, shortcut keys for the sound<br>
10 source push service may be used in such a way that a shortcut key "1+*" is used to set the ringback tone replacing sound source of the called party to the service sound source of the calling party, a shortcut key "2+*" is used to set the ringer sound source of the called party to the service sound source<br>
15 of the calling party, a shortcut key "3+*" is used to set the background music sound source of the called party to the service sound source of the calling party, a shortcut key "4+*" is Used to set the music mail sound source of the called party to the service sound source of the calling<br>
20 party, a shortcut key "5+*" is used to set the MOD sound source of the called party to the service sound source of the calling party, and a shortcut key "6+*" is used to set the VOD sound source of the called party to the service sound source of the calling party.<br>
25 The definition and example of the above-described shortcut keys are summarized and shown in Table 3. The definition of the shortcut keys for the sound source push service, or the definition of the service may be changed with the operations of the service. Further, the definition may<br>
30   be extended depending on the addition of services.  Further, the calling terminal subscriber can freely change and set the shortcut keys for the sound source push service within an allowable range defined by a service operator.<br><br>

For example, if the calling party requests the sound source push service by<br>
10 pressing the shortcut key "i+*" on the calling terminal during the placing of a call, the service sound source set by the calling party using the sound source push service is pushed as the supplementary service sound source of the called party. This method may be more efficiently used in<br>
15 the case where the called subscriber does not know how to use a method of subscribing to the supplementary service and changing a service sound source.<br>
FIG. 20 is a view showing the subscription to the sound source push service and the setting of service sound sources,<br>

Referring to FIG. 20, a subscriber having subscribed to<br>
30 the present service can designate and manage at least one sound source as his or her supplementary service sound source. For example, the subscriber can designate a service<br><br>
sound source provided from the first MCP as his or her<br>
								service sound source (title song) If the subscriber designates and uses a plurality of service sound sources according to respective services, supplementary service sound 5 sources, such as a ringback tone replacing sound (ringback tone) source provided from the first MCP, a ringer sound source provided from the second MCP, a background music sound source provided from the third MCP, a morning call sound source provided from the fourth MCP, a music mail sound<br>
10 source provided from the fifth MCP, and a MOD/VOD sound source provided from the sixth MCP, are stored in a storage space of the subscriber coupled to the Internet. Further, the subscriber can manage the supplementary service sound sources stored in his or her storage space in the form of a<br>
15 homepage 2001 through the use of the wired/wireless Internet, ARS, etc. At this time, the subscriber can perform pre-listening for the service sound source designated by the subscriber through the wired Internet by clicking a corresponding sound source Further, in the sound source<br>
20 push service according to the second embodiment of the present invention, dates and opposite parties' phone numbers for transmitted supplementary service sound sources can be recorded and stored at the homepage 2001 provided from the communication service provider, as shown in FIG. 20. In this<br>
25 way, the service sound sources designated by the subscriber are used to be pushed as the supplementary service sound sources of the called party in real time using the DTMF shortcut key during the placing of a call or the listening of a ringback tone replacing sound.<br>
30 Referring to FIG. 21, as described above, the subscriber having subscribed to the present service can store and manage at least one supplementary service sound source of a ringback tone replacing sound source, a ringer sound source, a background music sound source, a morning call sound source, a<br>
35 music mail sound source and a MOD/VOD sound source provided from at least one MCP, as his or her supplementary service<br><br>
sound source, in his or her storage space accessible by a<br>
mobile communication terminal  In this case the storage<br>
space includes a predetermined space within a storage device<br>
provided  from the  service  provider  to  the  subscriber<br>
5   Further, the user can subscribe to the present service, set<br>
his or her at least one service sound source, manage the list<br>
of service sound sources pushed by the subscriber to the<br>
called party, and utilize services, such as the way of using<br>
the present service, on a menu screen 2101.  In this way, at<br>
10 least one service sound source designated (set) by the subscriber is used to be pushed as the supplementary service sound source of the called party in real time using the DTMF shortcut key during the placing of a call or the listening of a ringback tone replacing sound.<br>
15 FIG. 22 is a signal flowchart showing the sound source push service according to a second embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 23 is a diagram showing the sound source push service according to a second embodiment of the present invention. For reference, numerals are expressed in FIG. 23<br>
20   for ease of understanding of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 22 and 23, if a calling party places a call to a called party having subscribed to a ringback tone replacement service, the called party receives a ringback tone replacing sound depending on a ringback tone replacement<br>
25 service scenario at step 2201  At this time, the calling party presses a DTMF shortcut key for a service sound source on a calling terminal in the case where the calling party desires to push at least one of his or her preset supplementary service sound sources as at least one<br>
30 supplementary service sound source of the called party at step 2203. For example, service sound source shortcut keys includes a shortcut key "i+*" used to push a ringback tone replacing sound, a shortcut key "2+*" used to push a background music sound source, a shortcut key "3+*" used to<br>
35 push a ringer sound source, a shortcut key "4+*" used to push a music mail sound source, a shortcut key "5+*" used to push<br><br>
a MOD sound source, and a shortcut key "6+*" used to push a VOD sound source.<br>
If the shortcut key for the service sound source is input from the calling terminal, the service IP server 5 receives the service sound source shortcut key from the MSC at step 2205. Further, the service IP server detects a specific DTMF signal used as the service sound source shortcut key at step 2207. Thereafter, the service IP server transmits information on a calling party phone number<br>
10 (calling party MIN), a called party phone number (called party MIN), a ringback tone replacing sound code and a DTMF shortcut key, which the service IP server collects for a current ringback tone replacement service, to the service providing system at step 2209. In this case, the service<br>
15 providing system includes a gateway G/W as a service providing apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The service providing system requests the title song information and sound source push service information of the<br>
20 calling party from the CP server interworking with the service providing system to provide the present service at step 2211. In response to the request, the CP server searches a database at step 2213. Thereafter, if the title song exists in the database, the CP server transmits a<br>
25   response signal, including the sound source information of<br>
the title song, to the service providing system at step 2215.<br>
If the title song of the calling party does not exist in<br>
the database at step 2213, the CP server transmits a response<br>
Signal, indicating that the title song is not registered in<br>
30 the database, to the service providing system at step 2215. The service providing system, having confirmed that the title Song of the calling party is not registered, transmits calling party information to a first MCP that provides a supplementary service selected using a DTMF shortcut key by<br>
35 the calling party (hereinafter referred to as a "first supplementary service"), and then receives the name of a<br><br>
singer and the title of a song corresponding to the sound source of the first supplementary service from the first MCP at step 2219. Thereafter, the service providing system requests from the CP server a sound source code corresponding 5 to the name of the singer and the title of the song, to be used for the supplementary service of the called party (hereinafter referred to as a "second supplementary service"), which is selected using the DTMF shortcut key, at step 2221. At this time, a service registration request<br>
10 signal for allowing the called party, who is an object to the sound source push service, to automatically subscribe to the service is transmitted to the CP server together with the sound source code request signal (refer to FIG. 18) . In response to the request from the service providing system,<br>
15 the CP server transmits the sound source code to the service providing system at step 2223. In this case, the sound source code is extracted from a mapping table formed to allow sound source codes, singer names and song titles for various supplementary services, provided from a plurality of MCPs, to<br>
20    refer to each other.<br>
Next, the service providing system transmits a sound source setting/change request signal to a second MCP that provides a second supplementary service at step 2225. The sound source change request signal includes the sound source<br>
25 information of the title song of the calling party, or the sound source code of the first supplementary service and called party information, such as a called terminal identifier. At this time, if the second supplementary service is a ringback tone replacement service or background<br>
30 music service, the second MCP transmits the sound source change request signal to the SCP at step 2227. Thereafter, the service providing system notifies the called terminal that the first supplementary service sound source is pushed as a second supplementary service sound source using SMS of<br>
35 the SMSC at steps 2229 and 2231. Through the above process, the calling party conveniently pushes his or her<br><br>
supplementary service sound source as the supplementary<br>
				service sound source of the called party and then sets the . supplementary service sound source of the called party using a DTMF shortcut key during the placing of a call. Meanwhile, 5 in this embodiment, the called party accesses the CP ARS connected to the CP server to listen to a sound source, confirm sound source information and change the sound source, and to newly subscribe to the present service and change subscription information. If the called party changes a<br>
10 sound source, the sound source change information thereof is transmitted to a corresponding MCP.<br>
FIG. 24 is a view schematically showing a procedure of providing the sound source push service according to a second embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 24, numerals<br>

20 providing MCP system-through the wired/wireless Internet, such as Web or WAP (ME), or ARS, and sets the sound source of his or her sound source push service to at least one title song (1) . If the calling party does not set the title song, the ringback tone replacing sound of the calling party or a<br>
25 basic sound source provided from a service provider can be used as the sound source of the present service. Next, the calling party presses a DTMF shortcut key on a calling terminal so as to push the title song in the sound â€¢ source push service, set by the calling party, or a specific<br>
30   supplementary service sound source (hereinafter referred to as  a  "first  service  sound  source")  as  at  least  one supplementary service sound source of the called party (hereinafter referred to as a "second service sound source") in real time using a DTMF shortcut key while listening to the<br>
35 ringback tone replacing sound at the time of placing a call (2) . The supplementary service sound source of the calling<br><br>
or called party includes a ringback tone replacing sound  source a ringer sound source a background music sound source, a music mail sound source, a morning call sound source and a MOD/VOD sound source.<br>
5 Next, the IP server (service IP server), providing the sound source push service according to the second embodiment of the present invention, receives a DTMF shortcut key from a MSC. Further, the service IP server detects an intelligent network service call from the DTMF shortcut key received from<br>
10 the MSC (DTMF detection) (3). Thereafter, the service IP server transmits collected information, including the phone number information of calling and called terminals, the ringback tone replacing sound source information of the called party and the DTMF shortcut key information, to the<br>
15 service providing system (4). In detail, the collected information includes the subscriber information (calling number and called number), the DTMF shortcut key information and the ringback tone replacing sound source code.<br>
Next, the service providing system requests the sound<br>
20 source information of the first service sound source from the CP server using the data received from the IP server and receives a response signal to the request (5). Further, the service providing system transmits a sound source change request signal to a MCP having the second service sound<br>
25 source (6) . Thereafter, the service providing system notifies the called party of the sound source information pushed by the calling party in the form of an SMS message through the SMSC (7). At this time, the SMS message includes the details of the sound source push service used by the<br>
30 calling party and a callback number to the CP ARS, or a callback URL to the Web/WAP (ME) server.<br>
Next, the service providing system transmits a completion message, indicating that the notification message for the results of the sound source push service has been<br>
35 transmitted to the called terminal, to the CP server (8) . The CP server performs an automatic subscription procedure<br><br>
for the present service with respect, to the called party<br>
 			through the WISE (CS) (9) Such a subscription prooedure is performed in the case where the called party does not subscribe to the present service.  Further, the CP server 5   transmits the details of the use of the sound source push service to the Internet Detain record (IDR) system so as to bill the calling party for the sound source push service (10).<br>
In  the  meantime,  the  called  party  accesses  a<br>
10 corresponding service MCP system using a callback number to the CP ARS or Web/WAP (ME) callback URL included in the SMS message (11). At this time, if the supplementary service of the called party is a ringer download service, the called party accesses a ringer MCP using the callback URL. Further,<br>
15 if the supplementary service of the called party is one of the ringback tone replacement service, the background music service, the music mail service and the MOD/VOD service, the called party may access the CP ARS, and the MCP system providing the corresponding service. Further, the CP server<br>
20 requests the SCP to allow the called party to subscribe to the corresponding service and set a corresponding sound source if the called party is a non-subscriber to the service (12).<br>
Next,  an  interworking  procedure  between  service<br>
25 providers of the sound source push service according to the second embodiment of the present invention is described. That is, if communication network service providers to which the calling party and the called party subscribe are different, the sound source push service of the present<br>
30 invention is performed by interworking between the communication network service providers. FIG. 25 is a view showing a procedure of allowing a calling party to push the sound source of at least one supplementary service (first supplementary service), preset by the calling party, as the<br>
35 sound source of at least one supplementary service (second supplementary service) of a called party having subscribed to<br><br>
another communication network using a DTMF shortcut key<br>
during the placing of a call in the sound source push service<br>
according to a second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In FIG. 25, numerals are expressed for ease of understanding<br>
5   of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 25, if a calling party places a call to a called party having subscribed to a ringback tone replacement service, the called party receives a ringback tone replacing sound depending on a ringback tone replacement<br>
10 service scenario. At this time, the calling party presses a service sound source shortcut key (DTMF shortcut key) on a calling terminal so as to push his or her set title song, a specific supplementary service sound source, or a basic sound source provided from the present service provider, as the<br>
15 supplementary service sound source of the called party (1) . A first service IP server in a first communication service provider network (B service provider network), to which the called party has subscribed, detects the service sound source shortcut key (DTMF detection) (2). Further, the first<br>
20 service IP server transmits information on a calling party phone number (calling party MIN), a called party phone number (called party MIN), a ringback tone replacing sound code, and a DTMF shortcut key, which the first service IP server collects for a current service, to a first service providing<br>
25 system in the first communication service provider network (3).<br>
Next, the first service providing system transmits data received from the first service IP server to a second service providing system in a second communication service provider<br>
30 network (A service provider network) to which the calling party has subscribed (4) . The second service providing system requests and receives the title song information of the calling party from the second CP server in the second communication service provider network (5), At the procedure<br>
35 (5) , if the title song of the calling party is not registered, the second service providing system transmits<br><br>
I<br>
calling party information to the second MCP providing the<br>
second supplementary service and receives the name of a singer and the title of a song corresponding to the sound source of the second supplementary service (6). Further, the 5 second service providing system requests and receives a sound source code corresponding to the singer name and song title from the second CP server. At this time, the second CP server interworks with the first CP server and extracts the sound source code using a mapping table formed to allow sound<br>
10 source codes, singer names and song titles for various supplementary services, provided from respective MCPs, to refer to each other.<br>
Next,  if the title song of the calling party is registered, the second service providing system transmits the<br>
15 sound source information of the title song of the calling party to the first service providing system (7) , The first service providing system requests the title song information of the calling party and the registration of the sound source push service from the first CP server in the first<br>
20 communication service provider network, and receives the sound source code corresponding to the title song (8) . The first service providing system notifies the called party of the details of the use of the sound source push service using SMS (9) . Further, the first service providing system<br>
25 transmits a completion message, indicating that the sound source push service has been completed, to the second service providing system (10).<br>
Thereafter, the called party accesses the ARS connected to the first CP server using the callback number or URL<br>
30 included in the SMS message, and then subscribes to the service and listen to and change the sound source (11). At this time, the subscription of the called party to the service and sound source setting request information thereof is transmitted from the ARS to the MCP, or transmitted to the<br>
35    SCP if necessary (12 and 13).<br><br><br>
