BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A variety of disorders in humans and other mammals involve or are associated with abnormal bone resorption. Such disorders include, but are not limited to, osteoporosis, glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis, Paget's disease, abnormally increased bone turnover, periodontal disease, tooth loss, bone fractures, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, periprosthetic osteolysis, osteogenesis imperfecta, metastatic bone disease, hypercalcemia of malignancy, and multiple myeloma. One of the most common of these disorders is osteoporosis, which in its most frequent manifestation occurs in postmenopausal women. Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by a low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. Osteoporotic fractures are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly population. As many as 50% of women and a third of men will experience an osteoporotic fracture. A large segment of the older population already has low bone density and a high risk of fractures. There is a significant need to both prevent and treat osteoporosis and other conditions associated with bone resorption. Because osteoporosis, as well as other disorders associated with bone loss, are generally chronic conditions, it is believed that appropriate therapy will typically require chronic treatment.<br>
Osteoporosis is characterized by progressive loss of bone architecture and mineralization leading to the loss in bone strength and an increased fracture rate. The skeleton is constantly being remodeled by a balance between osteoblasts that lay down new bone and osteoclasts that breakdown, or resorb, bone. In some disease conditions and advancing age the balance between bone formation and resorption is disrupted; bone is removed at a faster rate. Such a prolonged imbalance of resorption over formation leads to weaker bone structure and a higher risk of fractures.<br>
Bone resorption is primarily performed by osteoclasts, which arc multinuclear giant cells. Osteoclasts resorb bone by forming an initial cellular attachment to bone tissue, followed by the formation of an extracellular compartment or lacunae. The lacunae are maintained at a low pH by a proton-ATP pump. The acidified environment in the lacunae allows for initial demineralization of bone followed by the degradation of bone proteins or collagen by proteases such<br><br>
as cysteine proteases. See Delaisse, J. M. et ai, 1980, Biochem J 192:365-368; Delaisse, J. et al.9 1984, Biochem Biophys Res CommunAA 1 -447; Delaisse, J. M. et aL, 1987, Bone Â£:305-313, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Collagen constitutes 95 % of the organic matrix of bone. Therefore, proteases involved in collagen degradation are an essential component of bone turnover, and as a consequence, the development and progression of osteoporosis.<br>
Cathepsins belong to the papain superfamily of cysteine proteases. These proteases function in the normal physiological as well as pathological degradation of connective tissue. Cathepsins play a major role in intracellular protein degradation and turnover and remodeling. To date, a number of cathepsin have been identified and sequenced from a number of sources. These cathepsins are naturally found in a wide variety of tissues. For example, cathepsin B, F, H, L, K, S, W, and Z have been cloned. Cathepsin K (which is also known by the abbreviation cat K) is also known as cathepsin O and cathepsin 02. See PCT Application WO 96/13523, Khepri Pharmaceuticals, Inc., published May 9, 1996, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Cathepsin L is implicated in normal lysosomal proteolysis as well as several diseases states, including, but not limited to, metastasis of melanomas. Cathepsin S is implicated in Alzheimer's disease and certain autoimmune disorders, including, but not limited to juvenile onset diabetes, multiple sclerosis, pemphigus vulgaris, Graves' disease, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythemotasus, rheumatoid arthritis and Hashimoto's thyroiditis; allergic disorders, including, but not limited to asthma; and allogenic immunbe responses, including, but not limited to, rejection of organ transplants or tissue grafts. Increased Cathepsin B levels and redistribution of the enzyme are found in tumors, suggesting a role in tumor invasion and matastasis. In addition, aberrant Cathpsin B activity is implicated in such disease states as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, pneumocystisis carinii, acute pancreatitis, inflammatory airway disease and bone and joint disorders.<br>
Cysteine protease inhibitors such as E-64 (7r<ms-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamide- butane are known to be effective in inhibiting bone resorption. see delaisse j. m. et al which is hereby incorporated by reference its entirety. recently cathepsin k was cloned and found specifically expressed osteoclasts tezuka k. al.9 j biol chem shi g. p. al9 febs lett bromrne d.></ms-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamide-><br>
Okamoto, K., 1995, Biol Chem Hoppe Seyler 376:379-384; Bromme, D. et al, 1996, ./ Biol Chem 271:2126-2132; Drake, F. H. et al, 1996, J Biol Chem 271:12511-12516, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Concurrent to the cloning, the autosomal recessive disorder, pycnodysostosis, characterized by an osteopetrotic phenotype with a decrease in bone resorption, was mapped to mutations present in the cathepsin K gene. To date, all mutations identified in the cathepsin K gene are known to result in inactive protein. See Gelb, B. D. et al, 1996, Science 273:1236-1238; Johnson, M. R. et al, 1996, Genome Res 6;1050-1055, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Therefore, it appears that cathepsin K is involved in osteoclast mediated bone resorption.<br>
Cathepsin K is synthesized as a 37 kDa pre-pro enzyme, which is localized to the lysosomal compartment and where it is presumably autoactivated to the mature 27 kDa enzyme at low pH. See McQueney, M. S. et al, 1997, J Biol Chem 272:13955-13960; Littlewood-Evans, A. et al, 1997, Bone 20:81-86, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Cathepsin K is most closely related to cathepsin S having 56 % sequence identity at the amino acid level. The S2P2 substrate specificity of cathepsin K is similar to that of cathepsin S with a preference in the PI and P2 positions for a positively charged residue such as arginine, and a hydrophobic residue such as phenylalanine or leucine, respectively. See Bromme, D. et al, 1996, J Biol Chem TJ\_: 2126-2132; Bossard, M. J. et al, 1996, J Biol Chem 271:12517-12524, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Cathepsin K is active at a broad pH range with significant activity between pH 4-8, thus allowing for good catalytic activity in the resorption lacunae of osteoclasts where the pH is about 4-5.<br>
Human type I collagen, the major collagen in bone is a good substrate for cathepsin K. See Kafienah, W., et al, 1998, Biochem J 331:727-732, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In vitro experiments using antisense oligonucleotides to cathepsin K, have shown diminished bone resorption in vitro, which is probably due to a reduction in translation of cathepsin K mRNA. See Inui, T, et al, 1997, J Biol Chem 272:8109-8112, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The crystal structure of cathepsin K has been resolved. See McGrath, M. E., et al, 1997, Nat Struct Biol 4:105-109; Zhao, B., et al, 1997, Nat Struct Biol 4: 109-11, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br><br>
Also, selective peptide based inhibitors of cathepsin K have been developed See Bromme, D., et al.9 1996, Biochem J 315:85-89; Thompson, S. K., et al., 1997, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94:14249-14254, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Accordingly, inhibitors of Cathepsin K can reduce bone resorption. Such inhibitors would be useful in treating disorders involving bone resorption, such as osteoporosis.<br>

The compounds of the present invention are inhibitors of cathepsins and are therefore useful to treat or prevent cathepsin dependent diseases or conditions in mammals, preferably humans. Specifically, the compounds of the present invention are inhibitors of Cathepsin K and are therefore useful to treat or prevent Cathepsin K dependent diseases or conditions in mammals, preferably humans.<br>
"Cathepsin dependent diseases or conditions" refers to pathologic conditions that depend on the activity of one or more cathepsins. "Cathepsin K dependent diseases or conditions" refers to pathologic conditions that depend on the activity of Cathepsin K. Diseases associated with Cathepsin K activities include osteoporosis, glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis, Paget's disease, abnormally increased bone turnover, periodontal disease, tooth loss, bone fractures, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, periprosthetic osteolysis, osteogenesis imperfecta, metastatic bone disease, hypercalcemia of malignancy, and multiple myeloma. In treating such conditions with the instantly claimed compounds, the required therapeutic amount will vary according to the specific disease and is readily ascertainable by those skilled in the art. Although both treatment and prevention are contemplated by the scope of the invention, the treatment of these conditions is the preferred use.<br>
An embodiment of the invention is a method of inhibiting cathepsin activity in a mammal in need thereof, comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of any of the compounds or any of the pharmaceutical compositions described above.<br>
A class of the embodiment is the method wherein the cathepsin activity is cathepsin K activity.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is a method of treating or preventing cathepsin dependent conditions in a mammal in need thereof, comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of any of the compounds or any of the pharmaceutical compositions described above.<br>
A class of the embodiment is the method wherein the cathepsin activity is cathepsin K activity.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is a method of inhibiting bone loss in a mammal in need thereof, comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of any of the compounds or any of the pharmaceutical   compositions  described  above.     Another  embodiment  of the<br><br>
invention is a method of reducing bone loss in a mammal in need thereof, comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of any of the compounds or any of the pharmaceutical compositions described above. The utility of cathepsin K inhibitors in the inhibition of bone resorption is known in the literature, see Stroup, G.B., Lark, M.W., Veber, DF., Bhattacharrya, A., Blake, S., Dare, L.C., Erhard, K.F., Hoffman, S.J., James, I.E., Marquis, R.w., Ru, Y., Vasko-Moser, J.A., Smith, B.R., Tomaszek, T. and Gowen, M. Potent and selective inhibition of human cathepsin K leads to inhibition of bone resorption in vivo in a nonhuman primate. J. Bone Miner. Res., 16:1739-1746;2001; and Votta, B.J., Levy, M.A., Badger, A., Dodds, R.A., James, I.E., Thompson, S., Bossard, M.J., Carr, T., Connor, J.R., Tomaszek, T.A., Szewczuk, L., Drake, F.H., Veber, D., and Gowen, M. Peptide aldehyde inhibitors of cathepsin K inhibit bone resorption both in vivo and in vitro. J. Bone Miner. Res. 12:1396-1406; 1997.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is a method of treating or preventing osteoporosis in a mammal in need thereof, comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of any of the compounds or any of the above pharmaceutical compositions described above. The utility of cathepsin K inhibitors in the treatment or prevention of osteoporosis is known in the literature, see Saftig, P., Hunziker, E., Wehmeyer, O., Jones, S., Boyde, A., Rommerskirch, W., Moritz, J.D., Schu, P., and Vonfigura, K. Impaired osteoclast bone resorption leads to osteoporosis in cathepsin K-deficient mice. Proc. Natl. acad. Sci. USA 95:13453-13458; 1998.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is a method of treating or preventing rheumatoid arthritic condition in a mammal in need thereof, comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of any of the compounds or any of the pharmaceutical compositions described above. It is known in the literature that progressive destruction of the periarticular bone is a major cause of joint dysfunction and disability in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), see Goldring SR, " Pathogenesis of bone erosions in rheumatoid arthritis". Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2002; 14: 406-10. Analysis of joint tissues from patients with RA have provided evidence that cathepsin K positive osteoclasts are the cell types that mediate the focal bone resorption associated with rheumatoid synovial lesion, see llou, W-S, Li, W, Keyszer, G, Weber, E, Levy, R, Klein, MJ, Gravallese, EM, Goldring, SR, Bromme, D, "Comparision of Cathepsin K and S expression within<br><br>
the Rheumatoid and Osteoarthritic Synovium", Arthritis Rheumatism 2002; 46: 663-74. In addition, generalized bone loss is a major cause of morbility associated with severe RA. The frequency of hip and spinal fractures is substantially increased in patients with chronic RA, see Gould A, Sambrook, P, Devlin J et al, " Osteoclastic activation is the principal mechanism leading to secondary osteoporosis in rheumatoid arthritis". J. Rheumatol. 1998; 25: 1282-9. The utility of cathepsin K inhibitors in the treatment or prevention of resorption in subarticular bone and of generalized bone loss represent a rational approach for pharmacological intervention on the progression of rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is a method of treating or preventing the progression of osteoarthritis in a mammal in need thereof, comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of any of the compounds or any of the pharmaceutical compositions described above. It is known in the literature that osteoarthritis (OA) is accompanied with a well-defined changes in the joints, including erosion of the articular cartilage surface, peri-articular endochondral ossification/osteophytosis, and subchondral bony sclerosis and cyst formation, see Oettmeier R, Abendroth, K, " Osteoarthritis and bone: osteologic types of osteoarthritis of the hip", Skeletal Radiol. 1989; 18: 165-74. Recently, the potential contribution of subchondral bone sclerosis to the initiation and progression of OA have been suggested. Stiffened subchondral bone as the joint responding to repetitive impulsive loading, is less able to attenuate and distribute forces through the joint, subjecting it to greater mechanical stress across the articular cartilage surface. This in turn accelerates cartilage wear and fibrillate, see Radin, EL and Rose RM, " Role of subchondral bone in the initiation and progression of cartilage damage", Clin. Orthop. 1986; 213: 34-40. Inhibition of excessive subarticular bone resorption by an anti-resorptive agent such as a cathepsin K inhibitor, will lead to inhibition of subchondral bone turnover, thus may have a favorable impact on OA progression. In addition to the above hypothesis, cathepsin K protein expression was recently identified in synovial fibroblasts, macrophage-like cells, and chondrocytes from synovium and articular cartilage specimens derived from OA patients, see Hou, W-S, Li, W, Keyszer, G, Weber, E, Levy, R, Klein, MJ, Gravallese, EM, Goldring, SR, Bromme, D, "Comparison of Cathepsin K and S expression within the Rheumatoid and Osteoarthritic Synovium", Arthritis Rheumatism 2002; 46: 663-74; and Dodd, RA, Connor, JR, Drake, FH, Gowen, M,<br><br>
"Expression of Cathepsin K messenger RNA in giant cells and their precursors in human osteoarthritic synovial tissues". Arthritis Rheumatism 1999; 42: 1588-93; and Konttinen, YT, Mandelin, J, Li, T-F, Salo, J, Lassus, J et al. "Acidic cysteine endoproteinase cathepsin K in the degeneration of the superficial articular hyaline cartilage in osteoarthritis", Arthritis Rheumatism 2002; 46: 953-60. These recent studies thus implicated the role of cathepsin K in the destruction of collagen type II in the articular cartilage associated with the progression of osteoarthritis. The utility of cathepsin K inhibitors in the treatment or prevention of osteoarthritis as described in this invention thus comprise of two different mechanisms, one is on the inhibition of osteoclast-driven subchondral bone turnover, and two is on the direct inhibition of collagen type II degeneration in the synovium and cartilage of patients with OA.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is a method treating cancer in a mammal in need thereof, comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of any of the compounds or any of the pharmaceutical compositions described above. It is known in the literature that cathepsin K is expressed in human breast carcinoma, see Littlewood-Evans AJ, Bilbe G, Bowler WB, Farley D, Wlodarski B, Kokubo T, Inaoka T, Sloane J, Evans DB, Gallagher JA, "The osteoclast-associated protease cathepsin K is expressed in human breast carcinoma." Cancer Res 1997 Dec l;57(23):5386-90.<br>
Exemplifying the invention is the use of any of the compounds described above in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment and/or prevention of osteoporosis in a mammal in need thereof. Still further exemplifying the invention is the use of any of the compounds described above in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment and/or prevention of: bone loss, bone resorption, bone fractures, metastatic bone disease and/or disorders related to cathepsin functioning.<br>

Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the like. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and/or flavoring agents may be added. For intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and intravenous use, sterile solutions of the active ingredient are usually prepared, and the pH of the solutions should be suitably adjusted and buffered. For intravenous use, the total concentration of solutes should be controlled in order to render the preparation isotonic.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines.<br>

soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamide-phenol, polyhydroxy-ethylaspartamide-phenol, or polyethyleneoxide-polylysine substituted with palmitoyl residues. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, copolymers of polyactic and polyglycolic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates and crosslinked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.<br>
The instant compounds are also useful in combination with known agents useful for treating or preventing osteoporosis, glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis, Paget's disease, abnormally increased bone turnover, periodontal disease, tooth loss, bone fractures, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, periprosthetic osteolysis, osteogenesis imperfecta, metastatic bone disease, hypercalcemia of malignancy, and multiple myeloma. Combinations of the presently disclosed compounds with other agents useful in treating or preventing osteoporosis or other bone disorders are within the scope of the invention.

1 -hydroxy-2-(3-pyridinyl)-ethylidene-l,l-bisphosphonic acid (risedronate).<br>
(4-chlorophenyl)thiomethane-l,l-disphosphonic acid (tiludronate) as described in U.S. Patent 4,876,248, to Breliere et al., October 24, 1989, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
1 -hydroxy-2-( 1 H-imidazol-1 -yl)ethylidene-l, 1 -bisphosphonic acid (zoledronate).<br>
Nonlimiting examples of bisphosphonates include alendronate, cimadronate, clodronate, etidronate, ibandronate, incadronate, minodronate, neridronate, olpadronate, pamidronate, piridronate, risedronate, tiludronate, and zolendronate, and pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts and esters thereof A particularly preferred bisphosphonate is alendronate, especially a sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium or ammonium salt of alendronic acid. Exemplifying the preferred bisphosphonate is a sodium salt of alendronic acid, especially a hydrated sodium salt of alendronic acid. The salt can be hydrated with a whole number of moles of water or non whole numbers of moles of water. Further exemplifying the preferred bisphosphonate is a hydrated sodium salt of alendronic acid, especially when the hydrated salt is alendronate monosodium trihydrate.<br>
It is recognized that mixtures of two or more of the bisphosphonate actives can be utilized.<br>
The precise dosage of the organic bisphosphonate will vary with the dosing schedule, the particular bisphosphonate chosen, the age, size, sex and condition of the mammal or human, the nature and severity of the disorder to be treated,   and   other  relevant  medical   and   physical   factors.     Thus,  a   precise<br><br>
pharmaceutically effective amount cannot be specified in advance and can be readily determined by the caregiver or clinician. Appropriate amounts can be determined by routine experimentation from animal models and human clinical studies. Generally, an appropriate amount of bisphosphonate is chosen to obtain a bone resorption inhibiting effect, i.e. a bone resorption inhibiting amount of the bisphosphonate is administered. For humans, an effective oral dose of bisphosphonate is typically from about 1.5 to about 6000 \ig/kg body weight and preferably about 10 to about 2000 ng/kg of body weight. For alendronate monosodium trihydrate, common human doses which are administered are generally in the range of about 2 mg/day to about 40 mg/day, preferably about 5 mg/day to about 40 mg/day. In the U.S. presently approved dosages for alendronate monosodium trihydrate are 5 mg/day for preventing osteoporosis, 10 mg/day for treating osteoporosis, and 40 mg/day for treating Paget's disease.<br>
In alternative dosing regimens, the bisphosphonate can be administered at intervals other than daily, for example once-weekly dosing, twice-weekly dosing, biweekly dosing, and twice-monthly dosing. In a once weekly dosing regimen, alendronate monosodium trihydrate would be administered at dosages of 35 mg/week or 70 mg/week.<br>
"Selective estrogen receptor modulators" refers to compounds which interfere or inhibit the binding of estrogen to the receptor, regardless of mechanism. Examples of estrogen receptor modulators include, but are not limited to, estrogen, progestogen, estradiol, droloxifene, raloxifene, lasofoxifene, TSE-424, tamoxifen, idoxifene, LY353381, LY117081, toremifene, fulvestrant, 4-[7-(2,2-dimethyI-l-oxopropoxy-4-methyl-2-[4-[2-(l-piperidinyl)ethoxy]phenyl]-2H-l-benzopyran-3-yI]-phenyI-2,2-dimethylpropanoate, 4,4'-dihydroxybenzophenone-2,4-dinitrophenyl-hydrazone, and SH646.<br>
An "estrogen receptor beta modulator" is a compound that selectively<br>
agonizes or antagonizes estrogen receptor beta (ERP). Agonizing ER|3 increases transcription of the tryptophan hydroxylase gene (TPH, the key enzyme in serotonin synthesis) via an ERp mediated event. Examples of estrogen receptor beta agonists can be found in PCT International publication WO 01/82923, which published on Novembwer 08, 2001, and WO 02/41835, which published on May 20, 2002, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
"Androgen receptor modulators" refers to compounds which<br><br>
interfere or inhibit the binding of androgens to the receptor, regardless of mechanism. Examples of androgen receptor modulators include finasteride and other 5a-reductase inhibitors, nilutamide, flutamide, bicalutamide, liarozole, and abiraterone acetate.<br>
"An inhibitor of osteoclast proton ATPase" refers to an inhibitor of the proton ATPase, which is found on the apical membrane of the osteoclast, and has been reported to play a significant role in the bone resorption process. This proton pump represents an attractive target for the design of inhibitors of bone resorption which are potentially useful for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis and related metabolic diseases. See C. Farina et al., "Selective inhibitors of the osteoclast vacuolar proton ATPase as novel bone antiresorptive agents," DDT, 4: 163-172 (1999)), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
"HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors" refers to inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. Compounds which have inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase can be readily identified by using assays well-known in the art. For example, see the assays described or cited in U.S. Patent 4,231,938 at col. 6, and WO 84/02131 at pp. 30-33. The terms "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor" and "inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase" have the same meaning when used herein.<br>
Examples of HMG-CoA  reductase inhibitors that may be used<br>
include but are not limited to lovastatin (MEVACORÂ®; see U.S. Patent Nos.<br>

(LESCOLÂ®; see U.S. Patent Nos. 5,354,772, 4,911,165, 4,929,437, 5,189,164,<br>
5,118,853, 5,290,946 and 5,356,896), atorvastatin (LIPITORÂ®; see U.S. Patent Nos. 5,273,995, 4,681,893, 5,489,691 and 5,342,952) and cerivastatin (also known as<br>
rivastatin and BAYCHOLÂ®; see US Patent No. 5,177,080). The structural formulas of these and additional HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that may be used in the instant methods are described at page 87 of M. Yalpani, "Cholesterol Lowering Drugs", Chemistry &amp; Industry, pp. 85-89 (5 February 1996) and US Patent Nos. 4,782,084 and 4,885,314. The term HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor as used herein includes all pharmaceutical^ acceptable lactone and open-acid forms (i.e., where the<br><br>
lactone ring is opened to form the free acid) as well as salt and ester forms of compounds which have HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity, and therefor the use of such salts, esters, open-acid and lactone forms is included within the scope of this invention. An illustration of the lactone portion and its corresponding open-acid<br>
form is Shown below as Qtnirtnrpc I anH IT<br>
In HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors where an open-acid form can<br>
exist, salt and ester forms may preferably be formed from the open-acid, and all such<br>
forms are included within the meaning of the term "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor"<br>
as used herein. Preferably, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is selected from<br>
lovastatin and simvastatin, and most preferably simvastatin. Herein, the term<br>
"pharmaceutically acceptable salts" with respect to the HMG-CoA reductase<br>
inhibitor shall mean non-toxic salts of the compounds employed in this invention<br>
which are generally prepared by reacting the free acid with a suitable organic or<br>
inorganic base, particularly those formed from cations such as sodium, potassium,<br>
aluminum, calcium, lithium, magnesium, zinc and tetramethylammonium, as well as<br>
those salts formed from amines such as ammonia, ethylenediamine, N-<br>
methylglucamine,	lysine,        arginine,        ornithine,        choline,        N,N'-<br>
dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, diethanolamine, procaine, N-benzylphenethylamine, l-p-chlorobenzyl-2-pyrrolidine-r-yl-methylbenz-imidazole, diethylamine, piperazine, and tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane. Further examples of salt forms of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may include, but are not limited to, acetate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bicarbonate, bisulfate, bitartrate, borate, bromide, calcium edetate, camsylate, carbonate, chloride, clavulanate, citrate, dihydrochloride, edetate, edisylate, estolate, esylate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glutamate, glycollylarsanilate, hexylresorcinate, hydrabamine, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, hydroxynapthoate, iodide, isothionate, lactate, lactobionate, laurate, malate, maleate, mandelate, mesylate, methylsulfate, mucate, napsylate, nitrate,<br><br>

Ester derivatives of the described HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor compounds may act as prodrugs which, when absorbed into the bloodstream of a warm-blooded animal, may cleave in such a manner as to release the drug form and permit the drug to afford improved therapeutic efficacy.<br>
As used above, "integrin receptor antagonists" refers to compounds which selectively antagonize, inhibit or counteract binding of a physiological ligand to the avP3  integrin, to compounds which selectively antagonize,  inhibit or<br>
counteract binding of a physiological ligand to the av(35 integrin, to compounds which antagonize, inhibit or counteract binding of a physiological ligand to both the avP3 integrin and the avP5 integrin, and to compounds which antagonize, inhibit or counteract the activity of the particular integrin(s) expressed on capillary endothelial cells. The term also refers to antagonists of the ctvP6&gt; avP8, ot] Pi, ot2Pl, asPi, a6Pl and ot6p4 integrins. The term also refers to antagonists of any combination of<br>
avp3, avP5, otvP6, avp8, alPl, a2Pl, asPl, a6Pl and ot6p4 integrins. H.N. Lode and coworkers in PNAS USA 96: 1591-1596 (1999) have observed synergistic effects between an antiangiogenic av integrin antagonist and a tumor-specific antibody-cytokine (interleukin-2) fusion protein in the eradication of spontaneous tumor metastases. Their results suggested this combination as having potential for the treatment of cancer and metastatic tumor growth. avP3 integrin receptor antagonists inhibit bone resorption through a new mechanism distinct from that of all currently available drugs. Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane adhesion receptors that mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The a and p integrin subunits interact non-covalently and bind extracellular matrix ligands in a divalent cation-dependent manner. The most abundant integrin on osteoclasts is avP3 (&gt; 10 /osteoclast), which appears to play a rate-limiting role in cytoskeletal organization important for cell migration and polarization. The avP3 antagonizing effect is selected from inhibition of bone resorption, inhibition of restenosis, inhibition of macular degeneration, inhibition of arthritis, and inhibition of cancer and metastatic growth.<br><br>
"An osteoblast anabolic agent" refers to agents that build bone, such as PTH. The intermittent administration of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or its ami no-terminal fragments and analogues have been shown to prevent, arrest, partially reverse bone loss and stimulate bone formation in animals and humans. For a discussion refer to D.W. Dempster et al., "Anabolic actions of parathyroid hormone on bone," Endocr Rev 14: 690-709 (1993). Studies have demonstrated the clinical benefits of parathyroid hormone in stimulating bone formation and thereby increasing bone mass and strength. Results were reported by RM Neer et al., in New Eng J Med 344 1434-1441 (2001).<br>
In addition, parathyroid hormone-related protein fragments or analogues, such as PTHrP-(l-36) have demonstrated potent anticalciuric effects [see M.A. Syed et al., "Parathyroid hormone-related protein-(l-36) stimulates renal tubular calcium reabsorption in normal human volunteers: implications for the pathogenesis of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy," JCEM 86: 1525-1531 (2001)] and may also have potential as anabolic agents for treating osteoporosis.<br>
If formulated as a fixed dose, such combination products employ the compounds of this invention within the dosage range described below and the other pharmaceutically active agent(s) within its approved dosage range. Compounds of the instant invention may alternatively be used sequentially with known pharmaceutical ly acceptable agent(s) when a combination formulation is inappropriate.<br>
The term "administration" and variants thereof (e.g., "administering" a compound) in reference to a compound of the invention means introducing the compound or a prodrug of the compound into the system of the animal in need of treatment. When a compound of the invention or prodrug thereof is provided in combination with one or more other active agents (e.g., a cytotoxic agent, etc.), "administration" and its variants are each understood to include concurrent and sequential introduction of the compound or prodrug thereof and other agents. The present invention includes within its scope prodrugs of the compounds of this invention. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the compounds of this invention which are readily convertible in vivo into the required compound. Thus, in the methods of treatment of the present invention, the term "administering" shall encompass the treatment of the various conditions described with the compound specifically disclosed or with a compound which may not be<br><br>
specifically disclosed, but which converts to the specified compound in vivo after administration to the patient. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs," ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Metabolites of these compounds include active species produced upon introduction of compounds of this invention into the biological milieu.<br>
As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein means that amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician.<br>
The terms "treating" or "treatment" of a disease as used herein includes: preventing the disease, i.e. causing the clinical symptoms of the disease not to develop in a mammal that may be exposed to or predisposed tothe disease but does not yet experience or display symptoms of the disease; inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting or reducing the development of the disease or its clinical symptoms; or relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease or its clinical symptoms.<br>
The term "bone resorption," as used herein, refers to the process by which osteoclasts degrade bone.<br>
The present invention also encompasses a pharmaceutical composition useful in the treatment of osteoporosis or other bone disorders, comprising the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds of this invention, with or without pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents. Suitable compositions of this invention include aqueous solutions comprising compounds of this invention and pharmacologically acceptable carriers, e.g., saline, at a pH level, e.g., 7.4. The solutions may be introduced into a patient's bloodstream by local bolus injection.<br>
When a compound according to this invention is administered into<br><br>
a human subject, the daily dosage will normally be determined by the prescribing physician with the dosage generally varying according to the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, as well as the severity of the patient's symptoms.<br>
In one exemplary application, a suitable amount of compound is administered to a mammal undergoing treatment for a cathepsin dependent condition. Oral dosages of the present invention, when used for the indicated effects, will range between about 0.01 mg per kg of body weight per day (mg/kg/day) to about 100 mg/kg/day, preferably 0.01 to 10 mg/kg/day, and most preferably 0.1 to 5.0 mg/kg/day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100 and 500 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. A medicament typically contains from about 0.01 mg to about 500 mg of the active ingredient, preferably, from about 1 mg to about 100 mg of active ingredient. Intravenously, the most preferred doses will range from about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg/minute during a constant rate infusion. Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three or four times daily. Furthermore, preferred compounds for the present invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes, using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittant throughout the dosage regimen.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with other agents useful for treating cathepsin-mediated conditions. The individual components of such combinations can be administered separately at different times during the course of therapy or concurrently in divided or single combination forms. The instant invention is therefore to be understood as embracing all such regimes of simultaneous or alternating treatment and the term "administering" is to be interpreted accordingly. It will be understood that the scope of combinations of the compounds of this invention with other agents useful for treating cathepsin-mediated conditions includes in principle any combination with any pharmaceutical composition useful for treating disorders related to estrogen functioning.<br><br>
The scope of the invetion therefore encompasses the use of the nstantly claimed compounds in combination with a second agent selected from: an organic bisphosphonate; an estrogen receptor modulator; an androgen receptor nodulator; an inhibitor of osteoclast proton ATPase; an inhibitor of HMG-CoA -eductase; an integrin receptor antagonist; an osteoblast anabolic agent, such as PTH; and the pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts and mixtures thereof.<br>
These and other aspects of the invention will be apparent from the teachings contained herein.<br>
Definitions<br>
The compounds of the present invention may have asymmetric centers, chiral axes, and chiral planes (as described in: E.L. Eliel and S.H. Wilen, Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1994, pages 1119-1190), and occur as racemates, racemic mixtures, and as individual diastereomers, with all possible isomers and mixtures thereof, including optical isomers, being included in the present invention. In addition, the compounds disclosed herein may exist as tautomers and both tautomeric forms are intended to be encompassed by the scope of the invention, even though only one tautomeric structure is depicted. For example, any claim to compound A below is understood to include tautomeric structure B, and vice versa, as well as mixtures thereof.<br><br>
When any variable (e.g. Rl, R2, Ra etc.) occurs more than one time in any constituent, its definition on each occurrence is independent at every other occurrence. Also, combinations of substituents and variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. Lines drawn into the ring systems from substituents indicate that the indicated bond may be attached to any of the substitutable ring carbon atoms. If the ring system is polycyclic, it is intended that the bond be attached to any of the suitable carbon atoms on the proximal ring only.<br><br>
It is understood that substituents and substitution patterns on the compounds of the instant invention can be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art to provide compounds that are chemically stable and that can be readily synthesized by techniques known in the art, as well as those methods set forth below, from readily available starting materials. If a substituent is itself substituted with more than one group, it is understood that these multiple groups may be on the same carbon or on different carbons, so long as a stable structure results. The phrase "optionally substituted with one or more substituents" should be taken to be equivalent to the phrase "optionally substituted with at least one substituent" and in such cases the preferred embodiment will have from zero to three substituents.<br>

A comprehensive list of suitable protective groups can be found in T.W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1981, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The protected derivatives of compounds of Formula I can be prepared by methods well known in the art.<br>
Whenever the term "alkyl" or "aryl" or either of their prefix roots appear in a name of a substituent (e.g., aryl Co-8 alkyl) it shall be interpreted as<br>
including those limitations given above for "alkyl" and "aryl."

The novel compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to the following general procedures using appropriate materials and are further exemplified by the following specific examples. The compounds illustrated in the examples are not, however, to be construed as forming the only genus that is considered as the invention. The following examples further illustrate details for the preparation of the compounds of the present invention. Those skilled in the art will<br><br>
readily understand that known variations of the conditions and processes ui mw following preparative procedures can be used to prepare these compounds. All temperatures are degrees Celsius unless otherwise noted.<br>
SCHEMES<br>
Compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to Scheme 1, as indicated below. Thus an a-amino ester may be added to a haloalkyl ketone to form an aminal which may be dehydrated to an imine in the presence of a dehydrating agent such as TiCU, MgS04 or isopropyl trifluoroacetate. Reduction of the imine with a reducing agent such as sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium borohydride provides the amine. Ester hydrolysis and amide formation with an appropriately substituted aminoacetonitrile provides compounds of the current invention. If the substituent on D system is a halogen, a palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling with an appropriate boronic acid provides additional compounds of the current invention.<br>
SCHEME 1<br><br><br>
Compounds of the present invention may also be prepared according to Scheme 2, as indicated below. A ketone or aldehyde may be condensed with an amino alcohol to give a cyclic aminal. Treatment with 3 equivalents of a Grignard reagent or organolithium reagent will provide the appropriate alkylated amino alcohol. Oxidation of the alcohol with a chromium system such as a Jones oxidation or H5l06/Cr03, or alternatively by a two-step oxidation (eg oxalyl chloride/ DMSO/Et3N followed by NaCIO) will provide the corresponding carboxylic acid. Peptide coupling and Suzuki reaction as described in Scheme 1 will provide compounds of the current invention.<br>
SCHEME 2<br><br><br>
Compounds of the present invention may also be prepared according to Scheme 3, as indicated below. A ketone or aldehyde may be condensed with an amino alcohol to give an acyclic aminal. Treatment with multiple equivalents of a Grignard reagent or organolithium reagent will provide the appropriate alkylated amino alcohol. This alcohol can be converted into compounds of the current invention by the method described in Scheme 2.<br>
SCHEME 3<br><br><br>
Compounds of the current invention may also be prepared according to Scheme 4. An appropriately substituted acetate may be enolized with a suitable base (including, but not limited to LDA, KHMDS, NaH or nBuLi) and treated with paraformaldehyde to generate the diol. This diol may be converted to the difluoride using a fluorinating reagent such as DAST. Hydrolysis of the ester followed by Curtius rearrangement will then provide the amine. This amine can displace an appropriately substituted alpha-bromo ester to provide the alpha-amino ester. This may be converted into compounds of the current invention by the method described in Scheme 1.<br>
SCHEME 4<br><br><br>
Compounds of the current invention may also be prepared according to Scheme 5, as indicated below. A hemiacetal may be condensed with an amino alcohol in which the alcohol moiety is protected with a suitable protecting group. Treatment of the resulting imine with a Grignard reagent or organolithium reagent will provide the appropriate alkylated amino alcohol. The alcohol protecting group can then be removed and the alcohol can be converted into compounds of the current invention either by the method described in Scheme 2 or by first conducting the Suzuki reaction, followed by oxidizing the alcohol with H5I06 /Cr03 and then peptide coupling.<br><br><br>
Compounds of the current invention may also be prepared according to Scheme 6, as indicated below. The peptide coupling of an alpha-amino acid described in Schemes 1, 2, or 5, with an alpha-amino amide followed by dehydration of the resulting primary amide (Voegel, J. J.; Benner, S. A. Helv. Chem, Acta 1996, 79, 1863) will provide compounds of the current invention.<br><br><br>
The synthesis of some of the amino alcohols used at the beginning of Schemes 2, 3 and 5 are described in Schemes 7-11. For example, the synthesis of (2S)-2-amino-4-fluoro-4-methylpentan-l-ol where R=Me is described in Scheme 7 below. Starting with a suitable diprotected aspartic acid, the carboxy group can be reduced to an alcohol using standard literature procedures (i.e. mixed anyhdride formation followed by NaBfU reduction). A protected version of 2-amino-4-methylpentane-1,4-diol (R=Me) can then be generated by an appropriate Grignard or organolithiation reaction. Finally, the hydroxy moiety can be converted to the desired fluoro using a fluorinating agent such as DAST. The protected or unprotected version of this amino alcohol can then be converted to compounds of the current invention according to Schemes 1, 2, 3 and 5.<br>
SCHEME 7<br><br><br>
The 4-fluoroleucinol can also be synthesized according to Scheme 8. 4,5-Dehydroleucine is converted to (4iS)-4-(2-methyIprop-2-enyl)-l,3-oxazolidin-2-one as described in the scheme below. This intermediate is then treated with a hydrofluorination reagent such as HF-pyridine to give (4S)-4-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-l,3-oxazolidin-2-one. Basic hydrolysis (i.e. Ba(OH)2 or NaOH) then affords (2S)-2-amino-4-fluoro-4-methylpentan-l-ol. SCHEME 8<br><br><br>
The synthesis of 4,4-difluoro-L-norvaline where R=Me is described in Scheme 9 below. Starting with a suitable diprotected serine, iodination can be carried out using a reagent such as (PhO)3P+MeI\ Zincation of the resultant iodide may proceed using Zn-Cu couple and TMSC1. The resultant zincate can then undergo a palladium catalyzed coupling reaction with alkanoyl chloride to generate the ketone. Finally, the ketone moiety can be converted to the desired difluoro derivative using a fluorinating agent such as DAST. The protected or unprotected version of this amino acid or amino alcohol can then be converted to compounds of the current invention according to Schemes 1, 2, 3 and 5. SCHEME 9<br><br>
The amino alcohols used for the present invention can also be synthesized according to Scheme 10. A protected amino acid is reduced with a reducing agent such as NaBFU with or without an additive such as LiCl, in a solvent such as EtOH or a mixed solvent system such as EtOH and THF. The amino protecting group is then removed with the appropriate method according to the nature of the protecting group.<br><br><br>
Synthesis of (2S,4S)-2-amino-5,5,5-trifluoro-4-methylpentan-l-ol used in the present invention is described in Scheme 11. The N-benzoyl-5,5,5-trifluoroleucine (Ojiima, et. al. J. Org. Chem., 1989, 54, 4511 - 4522) can be hydrolysed with an aqueous acid such as 6M HCI under refluxing conditions. The amino acid HC1 salt intermediate is then converted to the N-acetyl-5,5,5-trifluoroleucine and the amino group chiral centre is resolved by an enzymatic method (Synthetic Communications, 1996, 26, 1109 - 1115.). The isolated 5,5,5-trifluoro-L-leucine is then protected with a protecting group such as benzyl carbamate and the carboxylic acid group is esterified. The two diastereomers at the 4-position are then separated by flash column chromatography. One of the enantiomers, the (2S,4S) protected amino acid is then converted to the amino alcohol as described in scheme 10. SCHEME 11<br><br><br>
Compounds of the current invention where R5 is hydrogen and R6 is aryl or heteroaryl may also be prepared according to Scheme 12 as shown below. Condensation of an aryl or heteroaryl aldehyde with an amino alcohol in which the alcohol moiety is protected with a suitable protecting group, followed by treatment of the resulting imine with a Grignard or organolithium reagent of formula halo-(D)n-Li or halo-(D)n-MgX (where D is as defined in the Summary of the Invention), followed by removal of the oxygen protecting group provides the alkylated aminoalcohol. The alkylated aminoalcohol is then converted into compounds of the current invention either by the method described in Scheme 2 or by first conducting the Suzuki reaction with the boronic ester of the formula R7-B(OH)2, then oxidizing the alcohol with a suitable oxidizing agent such as HsICVCrCh to give the acid and finally treating the acid with an aminoacetonitrile under peptide coupling conditions as described previously.<br><br>
Compounds of the current invention may also be prepared according to Scheme 13, as shown below. Reaction of a suitably N-protected amino acid derivative with oxetane tosylate  in the presence of sodium  iodide in a suitable organic solvent such as<br><br>
dimethylformamide provides the corresponding oxetane ester which upon treatment with diborane provides the ortho ester. Removal of the amino protecting group affords an amine which upon condensation with an aldehyde of formula R6CHO (where R6 is aryl or heteroaryl) or a hemiacetal of formula R6C(OH)(OR) (where R is an alkyl group) under the reaction conditions described above provides an imine. Treatment of the imine with a Grignard or organolithium reagent under the reaction conditions described above provides an N-alkylated derivative. Removal of the ortho ester provides the corresponding carboxylic acid which is then converted into compounds of the current invention by condensation with an aminoacetonitrile under peptide coupling conditions, followed by Suzuki reaction as described above.

The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min to 1 h. After acidification with 6M aqueous HC1 (6 mL), the mixture was extracted with EtOAc (6x). The combined EtOAc extracts were washed with brine, dried (MgS04) and concentrated. The residue was swished with hexanes:Et20 (1:1) to afford N-acetyl-5,5,5-trifluoroleucine as a white solid.<br>
To a suspension ofN-acetyl-5,5,5-trifluoroleucine (4.2 g, 18.5 mmol) in H2O (35 mL) was added 1 M aqueous NaOH (18.5 mL, 18.5 mmol) and the mixture was stirred for 15 to 30 min to give a homogenous solution. Acylase I (EC 3.5.1.14, from Sigma, Cat. # A 3010; 55 mg) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. Crude NMR of a small aliquot (evaporated under vacuum) showed a ratio of 53:47 for starting material and product. The mixture was then acidified with 6M aqueous HC1 (-3.5 mL) and extracted with EtOAc (4x, each EtOAc extraction was washed with a small amount of H2O). The combined EtOAc extracts were washed with brine, dried (MgS04) and concentrated to afford the crude N-acetyl-5,5,5-trifluoro-D-leucine as a pale yellow solid, [OC]D = + 27.6Â° (c 1.5, EtOH).

The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (3x), dried (Na2S04) and concentrated in vacuo to provide N-[(benzyloxy)carbonyl]-5,5,5-trifluoro-L-leucine. The crude acid was dissolved in Et20 and treated with a solution of diazomethane in Et20.
