				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
METHOD FOR MANAGING RESOURCES IN MOBILE TERMINAL<br>
BACKGROUND OFTHE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
	The present invention relates to a mobile terminal, and more particularly,<br>
to a method for managing resources in a mobile terminal having at least one<br>
display unit.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Mobile terminals function muck like a mobile entertainment system. For<br>
example, mobile terminal users can watch a video, listen to music, surf the<br>
Internet or play games on their mobile terminal. Thus, users are spending more<br>
and more time on their mobile terminal.<br>
However, because related art mobile terminals generally include a single<br>
display unit and provide one function at a time, it is difficult for the user to perform<br>
multiple tasks at the same time. For example, when the user is watching a movie,<br>
playing a game or performing some other multimedia streaming service on the<br>
terminal, and he or she simultaneously receives a phone call or text message, the<br>
user has to stop watching the movie, playing the game, etc. and answer or reply<br>
to the phone call or text message. Thus, the related art mobile terminal restricts<br>
the amount of multitasking that can be performed by the user.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to address the above-<br><br>
noted and other problems.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for<br>
managing resources in a mobile terminal that allows a user to perform multiple<br>
tasks simultaneously.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to prevent the user from<br>
having to interrupt one task to perform another task on the mobile terminal.<br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the<br>
purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein,<br>
there is provided a method for managing resources in a mobile terminal. The<br>
method according to an aspect of the present invention includes determining<br>
whether or not a required resource is available to perform a requested task on the<br>
mobile terminal and selectively performing the requested task based on whether<br>
or not the required resource is available.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
mobile terminal including a display having at least first and second display<br>
portions and a controller configured to determine whether or not a required<br>
resource is available to perform a requested task on at least one of the first and<br>
second display portions and to selectively perform the requested task based on<br>
whether or not the required resource is available.<br>
Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become<br>
apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be<br>
understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating<br>
preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by illustration only, since<br>
various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will<br>
become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying<br><br><br>
drawings.<br>
Turning first to Figure 1, which is an overview showing a mobile terminal<br>
100 having two display units. As shown in Figure 1, the mobile terminal 100<br>
includes a first display unit 110 for displaying a list (or icons) of all tasks (or<br>
modules) available in the mobile terminal and an execution screen of the<br>
corresponding task, and also for outputting a main screen. Also included is a<br>
second display unit 112 for displaying a list of specific tasks and an execution<br>
screen of the corresponding task, and also for outputting an additional screen.<br>
The terminal 100 further includes a camera 114 for taking pictures or a video, a<br>
speaker 116 for outputting various audio signals such as voice, music and sound<br>
effects, a key pad 118 for inputting phone numbers and control commands, and a<br>
microphone 120.<br>
In addition, the first display unit 110 outputs a main standby screen, a list<br>
of all tasks available in the mobile terminal 100 and an execution screen of a<br>
corresponding task. Also, the second display unit 112 displays a sub-standby<br>
screen when the first display unit 100 is occupied by a program or when the folder<br>
portion of the mobile terminal is closed (e.g., when the folder portion of the<br>
terminal is closed to thereby turn off the first display unit 110). The second display<br>
unit 112 also displays a list of specific tasks such as a short message service, an<br>
alarm, an incoming phone call and an execution screen corresponding to the<br>
specific task.<br>
For example, when a video is reproduced using the mobile terminal 100,<br>
the first display unit 110 displays the video, and the second display unit 112<br>
displays information about the video such as a caption of the displayed video or<br>
displays a screen for controlling the displayed video. In addition, when the user<br><br><br>
simultaneously receives a short message while the video is being displayed on<br>
the first display unit 110, the second display unit 112 displays an indication that<br>
the short message has been received.<br>
As described above, the present invention advantageously manages and<br>
allocates resources for each appropriate display unit 110, 112, thereby allowing<br>
the user to perform multiple operations at the same time. Further, in the present<br>
invention, the resource management is preferably performed using a program that<br>
controls a multitasking performing function (hereinafter the program is referred to<br>
as the "controller").<br>
In addition, the controller preferably accesses a table including information<br>
about resources in the mobile terminal. For example, Figure 2A illustrates a<br>
controller 150 and a corresponding table 200. Figure 2B illustrates one example<br>
of the table 200 accessed by the controller 150 to manage, allocate and renew<br>
resources on the mobile terminal 100. Figure 2A also illustrates the first and<br>
second display units 110, 112 and the speaker 116.<br>
As shown in Figure 2B, the table 200 stores a list of resources such as an<br>
audio resource 210, a video resource 220, an image resource 230, a first display<br>
resource 240 and a second display resource 250. The table 200 also stores<br>
information about whether or not each resource is being used and information<br>
about process IDs using each resource.<br>
Turning next to Figures 3A-3C, which are flowcharts illustrating various<br>
embodiments of the present invention. As shown in these figures, and which will<br>
be described in greater detail below, when a new task starts, the controller 150<br>
manages and allocates resources based on information contained within the table<br>
200. The controller 150 may also use information regarding priorities of tasks<br><br><br>
(discussed in more detail with reference to Figure 3C).<br>
Referring first to Figure 3A, which illustrates a newly executed task being<br>
terminated if a corresponding resource is being used by another task. As shown<br>
in Figure 3A, if a new task is executed and requires a resource (S310), the<br>
controller 150 accesses the table 200 to determine whether or not a<br>
corresponding resource is already being used (S312). If the corresponding<br>
resource is being used (Yes in S312), the new task requiring the resource is<br>
terminated (S314). If the corresponding resource is not being used (No in S312),<br>
the controller 150 enters a new process ID corresponding the newly executed task<br>
in the table 200 (S316), assigns the corresponding resource to the newly<br>
executed table, and updates the table to indicate the newly executed task is using<br>
the corresponding resource (S318). Further, when a task is completed or is not<br>
being used, the controller 150 appropriately updates the table 200 to reflect the<br>
status of the task.<br>
Turning next to Figure 3B, which illustrates forcibly terminating an existing<br>
task already being used and starting the newly requested task. As shown in<br>
Figure 3B, if a new task is executed and requires a resource (S320), the controller<br>
150 determines whether or not a corresponding resource is being used based on<br>
information in the table 200 (S322). If the controller 150 determines the<br>
corresponding resource is being used (Yes in S322), the controller 150 searches<br>
the table 200 for the process ID of the resource currently being used and then<br>
terminates the corresponding task (S324). The controller 150 also updates the<br>
table 200 to include a process ID for the newly executed task in the table 200<br>
(S326) and to indicate the newly executed task is using the corresponding<br>
resource (S328).<br><br><br>
Next, Figure 3C illustrates a priority being given to each task and the<br>
controller 150 executing or terminating a task based on the priorities. In more<br>
detail and as shown in Figure 3C, if a new task is executed and requires a<br>
resource (S330), the controller 150 accesses the table 200 to determine if a<br>
corresponding resource for the new task is already being used (S332). If the<br>
controller 150 determines the corresponding resource is already being used (Yes<br>
in S332), the controller 150 searches the table 200 for a process ID of the<br>
resource already being used (S334).<br>
The controller 150 then compares priorities of the newly executed task and<br>
the already executing task to determine which task has a higher priority (S336). If<br>
the controller 150 determines the newly executed task has a higher priority (Yes in<br>
S336), the controller 150 terminates the already executing task (S340). Further,<br>
the controller 150 then updates the table 200 to include the process ID of the<br>
newly executed task and that the corresponding resource is being used (S342<br>
and S344). However, if the controller 150 determines the newly executed task<br>
does not have a higher priority (No in S336), the controller terminates the newly<br>
executed task (S340). The controller 150 also appropriately updates the table to<br>
reflect the cancellation of the newly executed task.<br>
Further, the information about the priorities of the tasks may be stored in<br>
the table 200 or stored in another location of a memory in the mobile terminal.<br>
One example of assigning a priority to a task is to assign a relatively high priority<br>
for a Video On Demand (VOD) task. That is, the VOD task has a relatively high<br>
priority because the user is generally charged an extra free for viewing the<br>
requested video. Thus, it is preferable this VOD task not be interrupted for a task<br>
assigned a lower priority. Tasks such as a VOD task that are not to be interrupted<br><br><br>
are hereinafter referred to as "screen occupation tasks."<br>
Thus, according to the present invention in one embodiment, if a new task<br>
is executed, the controller 150 checks the table 200 to determine if the related<br>
process for the new task is available. If the related process is available, the<br>
controller 150 appropriately updates the table 200, and if the resource for the<br>
newly executed task is already being used or is not available, the controller 150<br>
terminates the new task. For example, and with reference to Figures 1, 2A-2B<br>
and 3A, if a task requiring the first display unit 110 is started, the controller 150<br>
checks the table 200 to determine if the first display unit 110 is available. If the<br>
first display unit 110 is available, the new task is executed on the first display unit<br>
110.<br>
Further, because the controller 150 updates the table 200 to indicate the<br>
new task is executing on the first display unit 110, another task is prevented from<br>
using the first display unit 110. In addition, after the task occupies the first display<br>
unit 110, the controller 150 checks whether or not the second display unit 112 is<br>
available. If the second display unit 112 is available, the controller 150 displays<br>
additional information on the task being currently executed on the first display unit<br>
110 or can display other information such as a received text message, etc, on the<br>
second display unit 112.<br>
Further, if the user wants to execute a main task that only uses the first<br>
display unit 110 such as taking pictures with the camera 114, when the first<br>
display unit 110 is already displaying a screen occupation task that should not be<br>
canceled, the controller 150 would determine the first display unit 110 is not<br>
available. Thus, because the first display unit 110 is used by a "screen<br>
occupation task" and is essentially locked, the controller 150 sends an<br><br><br>
"unavailable" response to the main task indicating the first display 110 cannot be<br>
used. The requested main task is then terminated.<br>
Meanwhile, if the user executes a task, which can be processed in the<br>
second display unit 112 such as writing a short message, while the first display<br>
unit is being used by the screen occupation task, the controller 150 accesses the<br>
table 200 to determine if the second display unit 112 is available. If the second<br>
display unit 112 is currently being used, the controller 150 cancels the task<br>
requesting the second display unit 112. However, if the controller 150 determines<br>
the second display unit 112 is available, the controller 150 executes the requested<br>
task on the second display unit 112. Thus, for example, the user can watch a<br>
video in the first display unit 110 and write/receive text messages on the second<br>
display unit 112.<br>
In addition, if another additional task requiring the second display unit 112<br>
such as an alarm is executed, the controller 150 determines the priorities of the<br>
additional task and the task already running in the second display unit 112, and<br>
cancels the task having the lower priority. For example, assuming the alarm is a<br>
low battery warning having a higher priority than a text message, the controller<br>
150 would display the low battery warning in the second display unit 112 and<br>
cancel or put on hold the other task being performed in the second display unit<br>
112.<br>
Turning next to Figure 4, which is a flowchart showing another<br>
embodiment of a method for managing resources in the mobile terminal according<br>
to the present invention. With reference to Figure 4, if a new task A is executed in<br>
the mobile terminal (S410), the controller 150 accesses the table 200 to<br>
determine whether or not a resource which the newly executed task A requires is<br><br><br>
being used (S412). If the controller 150 determines the resource is not being<br>
used (No in S412), the controller assigns the corresponding resource the newly<br>
executed task A (S414) and appropriately updates the table 200.<br>
However, if the controller 150 determines the resource is already being<br>
used by another task B (Yes in S412), the controller 150 determines whether or<br>
not there is a resource which can be substituted (hereinafter called a "substitute<br>
resource") (S416). If there is no substitute resource (No in S416), the controller<br>
150 determines whether or not the resource being used by the other task B is<br>
locked (S418). When the controller 150 determines the resource is locked by the<br>
other task B (Yes in S418), the controller 150 terminates the newly executed task<br>
A (S420).<br>
However, when the corresponding resource is not locked (No in S418), the<br>
controller 150 determines whether the newly executed task A has priority over the<br>
task B (S422). If the newly executed task A has priority over the task B (Yes in<br>
S422), the controller 150 terminates the task B (S424) and assigns the resource<br>
to the newly executed task A (S426). On the contrary, if the task B has priority<br>
over the newly executed task A (No in S422), the controller 150 forcibly terminates<br>
the newly executed task A (S428).<br>
Meanwhile, according to the result of the determination in step (S416), if<br>
the controller 150 determines there is a substitute resource available (Yes in<br>
S416), the controller 150 then determines whether or not the substitute resource<br>
is being used by another task (S430). If the substitute resource is not being used<br>
by another task C (No in S430), the controller 150 assigns the substitute resource<br>
to the newly executed task A (S432). However, if the controller determines the<br>
substitute resource is being used by another task C (Yes in S430), the controller<br><br><br>
150 determines whether the newly executed task A has priority over the task C<br>
(S434). If the newly executed task A has priority over the task C (Yes in S434),<br>
the controller 150 terminates the task C (S436) and assigns the resource to the<br>
newly executed task A (S438). If the task A does not have priority over the task C<br>
(No in S434), the controller 150 terminates the newly executed task A (S440) and<br>
the task C continually uses the substitute resource.<br>
For example, when the audio resource 210 (see Figure 2B) is being used<br>
to play music on demand (MOD) requested by the user, the controller 150 can use<br>
a substitute resource to inform the user there is an incoming phone call. In this<br>
example, rather than informing the user about the call with a ring sound using the<br>
audio resource 210, the controller 150 can advantageously vibrate the phone,<br>
display information on one of the displays 110, 112 etc, to inform the user about<br>
the incoming call.<br>
In addition, if two users are communication with each other using a video<br>
communication feature included with their mobile terminals 100, the first display<br>
unit 110 displays an image of the other party, and the second display unit 112<br>
displays an image of the user holding the respective terminal 100, which is<br>
photographed by the camera 114. In other words, the table 200 includes<br>
information that the first display resource 240, the second display resource 250,<br>
the video resource 220 and the audio resource 210 are being used . At this time,<br>
if an alarm function for informing the user of an appointment time, for example, is<br>
processed, the controller 150 designates the second display resource 250 as the<br>
substitute resource, because the first display resource 240 is being used by video<br>
communication and thus is locked (i.e. the first display resource is a designated<br>
screen occupation task).<br><br><br>
In addition, because the alarm has priority over displaying the user's<br>
images on the second display resource 250, the controller 150 terminates the<br>
operation of displaying the user's image on the second display unit 112, and<br>
rather displays the alarm or appointment time information on the second display<br>
112. In addition, to attract the user's attention, the phone may be vibrated or the<br>
display portion 112 may be highlighted etc. Further, the controller 150 may also<br>
reduce the size of the user's image being displayed on the second display unit<br>
112 and display the reduced image somewhere on the first display unit 110.<br>
In addition, the priority of each task can be designated based on a<br>
predetermined mobile terminal manufacturer standard or may be selectively set<br>
by the user. Further, Figure 1 illustrates the mobile terminal 100 including the first<br>
display unit 110 being separate from the second display unit 112. However, as<br>
shown in Figure 5, for example, the mobile terminal 500 may include a single<br>
display 510 that is divided into a first display unit 520 and a second display unit<br>
530.<br>
As so far described, the method for managing resources in the mobile<br>
terminal according to the present invention prevents unwanted collision of<br>
resources which inconveniences the user, and allows the user to perform multiple<br>
tasks at the same time.<br>
As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without<br>
departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be<br>
understood that the above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the<br>
details of the foregoing description, unless otherwise specified, but rather should<br>
be construed broadly within its spirit and scope as defined in the appended<br>
claims, and therefore all changes and modifications that fall within the metes and<br><br><br>
bounds of the claims, or equivalence of such metes and bounds are therefore<br>
intended to be embraced by the appended claims.<br><br>
We Claim :<br>
1. A method for managing resources in a mobile terminal, the method comprising<br>
the steps of:<br>
determining whether a first required resource is available to perform a<br>
requested task on the mobile terminal;<br>
selectively performing the requested task based on whether the first required<br>
resource is currently being used by another task executing on the terminal;<br>

2. The method as claimed in claim 1, which involves:<br>
determining whether the substitute resource is currently being used,<br>
wherein the selectively performing step performs the requested task using the<br><br><br><br>
substitute resource in the event of the determining step determining the first<br>
substitute resource not currently being used.<br>
3.	The method as claimed in claim 2, which involves: comparing a priority of the<br>
requested task with a specific task using the substitute resource in the event of<br>
the determining step determining the first substitute resource being used.<br>
4.	The method as claimed in claim 3, which involves: terminating the specific<br>
task and executing the requested task in the event of the comparing step<br>
determining the specific task having a lower priority than the requested task;<br>
and terminating the requested task and executing the specific task in the event<br>
of the comparing step determining the requested task having a lower priority<br>
than the specific task.<br>
5.	A mobile terminal, comprising:<br>
a display having at least first and second display portions; and<br>
a controller to determine whether a first required resource is available to<br>
perform a requested task on at least one of the first and second display<br>
portions, to selectively perform the requested task based on whether the first<br>
required resource is currently being used by another task executing on the<br>
mobile terminal, to check whether there is a second resource that is a substitute<br>
resource that can be substituted for the first required resource in the event of<br>
the first required resource being currently used by said another task executing<br>
on the mobile terminal, to determine whether the first required resource is<br>
locked by said another task in the event of there is no substitute resource, to<br>
terminate the requested task in the event of the first required resource being<br>
locked by said another task, to compare a priority of said another task currently<br>
using the first required resource and a priority of the requested task, in the event<br>
of the first required resource being not locked by said another task, to terminate<br>
said another task and to execute the requested task in the event of said another<br><br><br>
task having a lower priority than the requested task, and to terminate the<br>
requested task in the event of the requested task having a lower priority than<br>
said another task.<br>
6.	The mobile terminal as claimed in claim 5, wherein the controller is adapted<br>
to determine whether the substitute resource is currently being used, and to<br>
perform the first requested task using the substitute resource in the event of the<br>
substitute resource not currently being used.<br>
7.	The mobile terminal as claimed in claim 6, wherein the controller is adapted<br>
to compare a priority of the requested task with a specific task using the<br>
substitute resource in the event of the first substitute resource being used.<br>
