				<td>POLYURETHANE SEALANT COMPOSITIONS<br>
This invention relates to polyurethane sealant compositions which are capable of being used without the need for a primer.<br>
Polyurethane sealant compositions typically comprise at least one urethane prepolymer. Sealants useful for bonding to non-porous substrates, such as glass are described, for example, in U.S. Patent 4,374,237 and U.S. Patent 4,687,533. U.S. Patent 4,374,237 describes a polyurethane sealant containing urethane prepolymers which have been further reacted with secondary amine compounds containing two silane groups. U.S. Patent 4,687,533 describes a polyurethane sealant containing urethane prepolymers which contain silane groups which have been prepared by reacting a polyisocyanate having at least three isocyanate groups vyith less than an equivalent amount of an alkoxysilane having a terminal group containing active hydrogen atoms reactjve with isocyanate groups to form an Isocyanatosilane having at least two unreacted isocyanate groups. In a second step, the isocyanatosilane is mixed with additional polyisocyanate and the mixture is reacted with a polyol to form a polyurethane prepolymer having terminal isocyanate groups and pendant alkoxysilane groups.<br>
However, when such sealants are used to bond glass substrates to painted substrates, such as for window installation in vehicle manufacturing, the lap shear strength of the bonded substrate may be less than desirable for safety or structural purposes. Consequently, a separate paint primer comprising a solution of one or more silanes is typically applied to a painted substrate prior to the application of the sealant in most vehicle assembly operations for bonding the windshield and the rear window. The use of a primer in assembly operations is undesirable in that it Introduces an extra step, additional cost, the risk of marring the paint surface if dripped on an undesired location and exposes the assembly line operators to additional chemicals. It would be desirable to provide a polyurethane sealant which, when bonded to a painted substrate and cured, provides a bonded substrate with a higher lap shear strength, particularly when used in the absence of a paint primer.<br>
In one aspect, this invention is a polyurethane sealant composition comprising (1) a urethane prepolymer having an isocyanate-functionality of at least 2.0 and a weight average molecular weight of at least 2,000; and (2) a catalytic amount of (a) a substantially active hydrogen-free glycol acid salt of a tertiary amine and an organometallic compound, (b)<br><br>

In another embodiment the invention is a method for bonding glass to a substrate which comprises contacting a sealant according to the invention with glass and another substrate with the sealant disposed between the glass and substrate and thereafter allowing the sealant to cure so as to bind the glass to the substrate.<br>
The sealant composition of the invention is useful in bonding glass substrates to plastic, metal, fiberglass and composite substrates which may or may not be painted. It has been discovered to give unexpectedly high lap shear strength when no primer compositions have previously been applied to a painted plastic, metal, fiberglass or composite substrate.<br>

The organotin catalyst is present in an amount of 5 parts per million or greater, more preferably 60 parts per million or greater based on the weight of the sealant, most preferably 120 parts by million or greater. The organotin catalyst is preferably present in an amount of 1.0 percent or less based on the weight of the sealant, more preferably 0.5 percent by weight or less and most preferably 0.1 percent by weight or less.<br>

For formulating sealant compositions, the prepolymer and the adduct, if present, are combined, preferably with fillers and additives known in the prior art for use in elastomeric compositions. By the addition of such materials, physical properties such as viscosity, flow rate, and sag, can be modified. However, to prevent premature hydrolysis of the moisture sensitive groups of the polymer, the filler should be thoroughly dried before admixture therewith. Exemplary filler materials and additives include materials such as carbon black, titanium dioxide, clays, calcium carbonate, surface treated silicas, ultraviolet stabilizers, and antioxidants. This list, however, is not comprehensive and is given merely as<br><br>
Illustrative. The fillers are preferably present in an amount of 15 percent by weight or greater based on the amount of the sealant. The fillers are preferably present in an amount of 70 percent by weight or less based on the sealant, more preferably 50 percent by weight or less and even more preferably 30 percent by weight or less.<br>
The amount of silane present is that amount which enhances the adhesion of the adhesive to the painted surface without the need for a primer. The amount of silane is preferably, 0.1 percent by weight or greater based on the weight of the sealant and most preferably, 1.0 percent by weight or greater. The amount of silane used is preferably, 10 percent by weight or greater or less and most preferably, 2.0 percent by weight or less.<br>
The sealant composition also preferably contains one or more plasticizers or solvents to modify rheological properties to a desired consistency. Such materials should be free of water, inert to isocyanate groups, and compatible with the polymer. Such material may be added to the reaction mixtures for preparing the prepolymer or the adduct, or to the mixture for preparing the final sealant composition, but is preferably added to the reaction mixtures for preparing the prepolymer and the adduct, so that such mixtures may be more easily mixed and handled. Suitable plasticizers and solvents are well-known in the art and include dioctyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, a partially hydrogenated terpene commercially available as "HB-40", trioctyl phosphate, epoxy plasticizers, toluene-sulfamide, chloroparaffins, adipic acid esters, castor oil, xylene, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and toluene. The amount of plasticizer used is that amount sufficient to give the desired rheological properties and disperse the components in the sealant composition. Preferably the plasticizer is present in an amount of 0 percent by weight or greater, more preferably 5 percent by weight or greater and most preferably 10 percent by weight or greater. The plasticizer is preferably present in an amount of 45 percent by weight or less and 40 percent by weight or less and most preferably 20 parts by weight or less.<br>
The sealant composition of this invention may be formulated by blending the components together using means well-known in the art. Generally the components are blended in a suitable mixer. Such blending is preferably conductedjn an inert atmosphere and atmospheric moisture to prevent premature reaction. It may be advantageous to add any plasticizers to the reaction mixture for preparing the isocyanate-containing prepolymer so that such mixture may be easily mixed and handled. Alternatively, the plasticizers can be added during blending of all the components. Once the sealant composition is formulated, it is packaged in a suitable container such that it is protected from atmospheric moisture.<br><br>
Contact with atmospheric moisture could result in premature crosslinking of the polyurethane prepolymer-containing isocyanate groups.<br>
The sealant composition of the invention is used to bond porous and nonporous substrates together. The sealant composition is applied to a substrate and the adhesive on the first substrate is thereafter contacted with a second substrate. Thereafter the adhesive is exposed to curing conditions. In a preferred embodiment one substrate is glass and the other substrate is a plastic, metal, fiberglass or composite substrate which may optionally be painted. This method is especially effective for substrates painted with an acid resistant paint. In preferred embodiments, the surfaces to which the adhesive is applied are cleaned prior to application, see for example U.S. Patents 4,525,511, 3,707,521 and 3,779,794. Generally the sealants of the invention are applied at ambient temperature in the presence of atmospheric moisture. Exposure to atmospheric moisture is sufficient to result In curing of the sealant. Curing may be further accelerated by applying heat to the curing sealant by means of convection heat, or microwave heating. Preferably the sealant of the invention is formulated to provide a working time of 6 minutes or greater more preferably 10 minutes or greater. Preferably the working time is 15 minutes or less and more preferably 12 minutes or less.<br>
Molecular weights and functionality as described herein are determined according to the procedures disclosed in WO 97125360.<br>

To the above mixture, 90 grams (0.263 mole) of N,N"-bis((3-trimethoxysilyl)propyl)amine (TMSPA) were added. The mixture was mixed for 30 minutes. The adduct mixture had an isocyanate content of 7.1 percent by weight.<br>
Example 3<br>

To the above mixture, 0.03 gram of stannous octoate catalyst was added. Mixing was continued for two hours. 282 Grams of alkylphthalate and 9 grams of diethyl malonate were added and uniformly mixed. The prepolymer had an isocyanate content of 1.3 percent by weight.<br>

A commercially available catalyst containing glycol as a solvent was treated with a diisocyanate compound to react away glycol, by first dissolving 10.8 grams of DABCO DC-2 (delay-action, amine-based catalyst, supplied by Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.) in the mixture of 27.7 grams of toluene, 9.2 grams of N-ethyl toluene sulfonamide and 21.6 grams of diethyl malonate in a reactor equipped with a mechanical agitator, a thermometer, and a nitrogen inlet tube. And then 30.8 grams of Vestanat^" TMDI (trimethyl hexamethylene diisocyanate supplied by Huls America, Inc.) was added under agitation. After exotherm subsided, the mixture was heated at 80°C for 6 hours. The final mixture was a liquid of light orange color and had zero percent isocyanate content by NCO titration.<br><br>
Examolfi S<br>
A moisture curable sealant composition was prepared under anhydrous conditions by first degassing under agitation the mixture of 1089 grams of the prepolymer of Example 1. and 15 grams of N,N"-bis((3-trimethoxysilyl)propyl)amine in a planetary mixer for 30 minutes. At this point, all the aminosilane was fully reacted with some isocyanate groups on the prepolymer. Then, to the above mixture. 65 grams of Desmodur^" N-3300 (an aliphatic polyisocyanate resin based on hexamethylene diisocyanate, supplied by Bayer USA Inc.) was charged and mixed for 10 minutes. Subsequently, 450 grams of dried carbon black was added, and mixed for 25 minutes under the reduced pressure of 30 inches of mercury. Finally, 14 grams of modified DABCO DC-2 of Example 4, were added and mixed for 10 minutes under the reduced pressure. The compounded sealant was filled into sealant tubes.<br>
The following are tests used for the prepared sealants: Quick Knife Adhesion Test:<br>
A 6.3 mm (width) by 6.3 mm (height) by 76.2 mm (length) size sealant bead is placed on 101.6 mm x 101.6 mm piece of an acid resistant paint panel and the assembly is cured for a specific time in the condition of 23°C and 50 percent relative humidity. The cured bead is cut with a razor blade through to the painted surface at a 45 degree angle while pulling back the end of the bead at a 180 degree angle. Notches are cut every 3 mm on the painted surface. The degree of adhesion is evaluated as adhesive failure (AF) and/or cohesive failure (CF). In case of adhesive failure, the cured bead can be separated from the painted surface, while in cohesive failure, separation occurs within the sealant bead as a result of cutting and pulling. The tested paint substrate can be used as supplied, or treated by wiping with isopropanol (IPA) or naphtha (NP). For the sealant of the invention, adhesion of a sealant develops sooner to the treated substrate than to the untreated one.<br>
Lap Shear Test:<br>
A sealant approximately 6.3 mm wide by 8 mm high is applied along the width of the glass and approximately 6 mm to 12 mm from the primed end. The paint substrate is immediately placed on the sealant and the sample is allowed to cure at the condition of the 23°C and 50 percent relative humidity for 5 days. The sample was then pulled at a rate of 1 inch/minute (2.5 cm/minutej with an Instron Tester.<br><br>
Environmental Tests:<br>
Short-term environmental tests include four weeks in the condition of 24""C, 50 percent R.H., four weeks in a 90°C oven, and ten days in 32°C water. Samples also are subjected to weatherability tests according to SAE J1960 and SAE J 1885.<br>
Quick Adhesion test;<br>
A 4 by 1/4 inch (10.1 by 0.6 cm) bead of sealant is extruded from a sealant tube on to a primed glass plate. A paint substrate is immediately placed on the top of the sealant bead. This assembly is allowed to cure at the 23""C and 50 percent relative humidity condition for a specific length of time and then the two substrates were separated by pulling in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the sealant bead at 10 inches per minute (25.4 cm per minute). The curing rate is recorded in pounds per square inch (kilopascals) at the elapsed time after assembly.<br>
The stability of the sealant on storage is evaluated by determining the flow rates of a sealant before and after aging at 130""F (54°C) for three days. The press flow is determined as the time in seconds required to extrude 20 grams of the sealant through an orifice 0.157 inch (0.4 cm) in diameter under a pressure of 80 pounds per square inch (551 kPa). Percent growth in press flow after aging will indicate the stability of the sealant on storage.<br>
The sealant in Example 5 had a very good accelerated storage stability as shown in press flows of 19 and 20 seconds respectively before and after aging at ISOT (54""C) for 3 days. The Quick Knife Adhesion test showed that the sealant adhered in one day to the IPA-wiped acid resistant paint and In 2 days to the untreated one. In lap shear testing, the sealant developed an average lap shear strength of 544 psi (3748 kPa) on both the treated and untreated paint substrates after 5 day cure at the condition of 23^0 and 50 percent R.H. The cured sealant produced 168 psi (1157 kPa) of tear strength, and 1085 psi (7476 kPa) of tensile strength and 270 percent elongation at break. The cure rate by the Quick Adhesion test, for this sealant were: 4 psi (28 kPa) at 1.5 hour, 24 psi (165 kPa) at 3 hours and 84 psi (579 kPa) at 6 hours.<br><br>
Example 6<br>
This sealant has the same composition as sealant in Example 5 except that a combination of 6 grams of the modified catalyst in Example 4, and 5 grams of dimorpholinodiethyl ether (DMDEE) was used instead of 14 grams of the modified catalyst alone. The cured sealant has similar adhesion and physical properties as the sealant in Example 5. The cure rates by the Quick Adhesion test at the condition of 23""C and 50 percent R.H., for this sealant were: 23 psi (158 kPa) at 1.5 hour, 63 psi (434 kPa) at 3 hours and 100 psi (689 kPa) at 6 hours. When exposed to the SAE J 1960 condition, the cured lap shear samples prepared from this material using glass primer on the glass side and no paint pnmer on the IPA-wiped paint substrate, exhibited an average lap shear strength of 525 psi (3617 kPa), and 100 percent cohesive failure within the sealant after 2,000 hours of exposure.<br>
Example 7<br>
Additional moisture curable sealants were also prepared in the same fashion as described in Example 5. Their compositions and adhesion properties by Quick Knife Adhesion to acid resistant paint are tabulated below.<br><br><br><br>
