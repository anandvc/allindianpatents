				<td>SYSTEM FOR DETERMINING RF PATH LOSS BETWEEN AN RF<br>
SOURCE AND AN RF RECEIVER WITH HYSTERESIS AND RELATED<br>
METHODS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to the field of<br>
communications systems, and, more particularly, to<br>
performance testing in mobile wireless communications<br>
systems, such as cellular communications systems, and<br>
related methods.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] In cellular communications devices, radio<br>
sensitivity is a fundamental figure characterizing<br>
radio receiver performance. Conducted (i.e., via an RF<br>
cable) and radiated (i.e., via a wireless<br>
communications link) radio sensitivity measurements are<br>
performed frequently during radio design,<br>
certification, and verification. These measurements are<br>
performed by reducing the base station power transmit<br>
level until the receiver residual bit error ratio<br>
(RBER) reaches a desired level, specifically 2.44%.<br>
[0003] For Global System for Mobile communication<br>
(GSM) mobile devices, for example, there are several<br>
communications bands each ranging from at least one<br>
hundred channels to almost four hundred. To scan every<br>
channel of a GSM mobile phone requires large amounts of<br>
time using traditional, semi-intuitive methods. Automated<br>
methods replicating manual estimation tend to be randot,<br>
or follow binary-tree search methodology.<br>
US 2004/0266474 discloses a method and apparatus for<br>
facilitating base station selection/handover by a user<br>
terminal in a distributed (e.g., cellular-type) wireless<br>
communication system. Hysteresis is adaptively determined<br>
as a function of the variance of receive signal strength<br>
fluctuations. In turn, an adaptive hysteresis factor can<br>
be obtained and used for a subsequent handover decision<br>
based on a cost function that takes into account the<br>
hysteresis. Base station selection may depend on a number<br>
of criteria, such as received signal strength, base<br>
station load, and estimated distance between a receiving<br>
user terminal and one or more base stations.<br>
The invention as set out in the claims.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
[0014] The present invention will now be described<br>
mere fully hereinafter with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments<br>
of the invention are shown. This invention may,<br>
however, be embodied in many different forms and should<br>
net be construed as limited to the embodiments set<br>
forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided<br>
sc that this disclosure will be thorough and complete,<br>
ar.d will fully convey the scope of the invention to<br>
these skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like<br>
elements throughout, and prime notation is used to<br>
ir.c-icate similar elements in alternate embodiments.<br>
[0015] A test method for determining radio frequency<br>
(?.F) path loss between an RF source and an RF receiver<br>
fcr a given RF channel in a given RF frequency band<br>
will first be summarized generally, and further details<br>
will be provided below. The RF source may transmit RF<br>
pcwer values at a relatively fine granularity, and the<br>
RF receiver may generate received signal strength<br>
indicator (RSSI) values at a relatively coarse<br>
granularity and have an unknown hysteresis about each<br>
transition between adjacent RSSI values. The test<br>
method may include determining a pair of hysteresis<br>
edges about a given RSSI value transition at the RF<br>
reeeiver by sweeping RF power values transmitted from<br>
the RF source in increasing and decreasing directions.<br>
The method may further include determining a<br>
relationship between the relatively fine granularity RF<br>
pe-er values and the relative coarse granularity RSSI<br>
values using the hysteresis transition edges. Also, the<br>
RF path loss for the given channel may be determined<br>
based upon a given RSSI at a given RF power value and<br>
the relationship between the relatively fine<br>
granularity RF power values and the relative coarse<br>
granularity RSSI values.<br>
[001-6] The test method may further include<br>
transmitting from the RF source at an initial RF power<br>
level and measuring a corresponding initial RSSI value<br>
of the RF receiver, and setting an initial internal<br>
amplification of the RF source based upon a difference<br>
between the initial RF power level and the<br>
corresponding initial RSSI value. Moreover, determining<br>
the pair of hysteresis edges may include sweeping in<br>
progressively decreasing intervals of RF power values.<br>
[0017] In addition, the method may also include<br>
repeating the three determining steps for at least one<br>
other given RF channel in the given RF frequency band<br>
to determine a plurality of RF path losses, determining<br>
an RF path loss function based upon the plurality of RF<br>
path losses, and determining an RF path loss for at<br>
least one other channel within the given RF frequency<br>
band based upon the RF path loss function. The RF path<br>
loss function may be determined based upon a least<br>
squares algorithm, using a plurality of splines, etc.<br>
[0018] By way of example, the RF receiver may be a<br>
Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) receiver,<br>
a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) receiver, an<br>
Enhanced Data Rates for Global System for Mobile<br>
Communications (GSM) Evolution (EDGE) receiver. In<br>
addition, the RF source may be a base station emulator.<br>
[0019] A test system for determining radio frequency<br>
(RF) path loss may include an RF source transmitting RF<br>
power values at a relatively fine granularity for a<br>
given RF channel in a given RF frequency band. The<br>
system may further include an RF receiver generating<br>
received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values at a<br>
relatively coarse granularity and having an unknown<br>
hysteresis about each transition between adjacent RSSI<br>
values. Moreover, the system may also include a test<br>
controller coupled to the RF receiver and the RF source<br>
for determining a pair of hysteresis edges about a<br>
given RSSI value transition of the RF receiver based<br>
upon sweeping RF power values transmitted from the RF<br>
source in increasing and decreasing directions. The<br>
test controller may also be for determining a<br>
relationship between the relatively fine granularity RF<br>
power values and the relative coarse granularity RSSI<br>
values using the hysteresis transition edges, and<br>
determining the RF path loss for the given channel<br>
based upon a given RSSI at a given RF power value and<br>
the relationship between the relatively fine<br>
granularity RF power values and the relative coarse<br>
granularity RSSI values.<br>
[0020] Generally speaking, methods and test systems<br>
are provided herein for determining conducted and<br>
radiated receiver sensitivity which use a channel<br>
information-based search approach, which creates a fast<br>
sensitivity search for GSM or other mobile devices. The<br>
RBER vs. normalized TCH transmit level is largely<br>
determined by the modulation method and digital signal<br>
processor (DSP) code. Measurement of a range of this<br>
data creates a curve or function showing the<br>
characteristics of the receiver near the target RBER.<br>
The compiled data for one channel applies to all<br>
channels within the same band. This curve allows<br>
predictive, rather than estimated, transmit level<br>
change within its boundaries.<br>
[0021] The sensitivity measurement is defined as the<br>
transmit (TX) power at which the mobile reports a Class<br>
II RBER of 2.44 percent or less. Often the calibrated<br>
base station transmit power is decreased until the<br>
desired RBER is achieved. To correctly measure device<br>
sensitivity in a conducted mode, accurate cable path<br>
loss needs to be determined across the channels in<br>
question. Within the desired bands, a random channel<br>
may be selected as representative. The lower and upper<br>
limits of the RBER scan range are selected. The lower<br>
limit is selected to minimize high Gaussian and other<br>
random noise error susceptibility at very low RBER. It<br>
is preferably sufficiently low to maintain a large<br>
overall scan range. The upper limit is selected to<br>
protect against terminated mobile calls while<br>
maintaining large overall scan range. The lower RBER<br>
limit can be found through various search methods, as<br>
will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
[0022] Bit error measurements within the above-noted<br>
limits use the highest transmit level resolution.<br>
Decreasing resolution decreases prediction accuracy<br>
over a non-linear system. The values are compiled with<br>
the TCH transmit level normalized. Random noise and bit<br>
error ratio modify the exact data curve. One approach<br>
is to apply a least-squares fitting to create the<br>
appropriate fast search curve. Because of the nature of<br>
the modulation, the normalized curve will have the form<br>
of y = Cebx between the lower and upper limits, where y<br>
is the bit error ratio, x is the normalized TCH<br>
transmit level, and C and b are values derived from<br>
curve fitting, as will be discussed further below.<br>
[0023] An example of an RBER vs. normalized TCH<br>
level curve is shown in FIG. 18. The points are the<br>
measurement data, and the line is the result of the<br>
curve fitting. For all other channels, points on the<br>
normalized curve are determined using a "leapfrog"<br>
method. The leapfrog amount is within the range from<br>
the lower to the upper limit. Consecutive channel<br>
sensitivities often narrowly differ.<br>
 [0024] Within the curve range, based on the<br>
information of the least squares curve, the change in<br>
transmit level is calculated. The new transmit level is<br>
then applied to the base station emulator, and the<br>
achieved RBER target (2.44%) is confirmed through<br>
measurement. Any deviation is corrected via<br>
reapplication of the normalized curve and a successive<br>
confirmation measurement. Increasingly small target to<br>
actual deviation increases accuracy through linearity,<br>
and deviation from expected values is minimal.<br>
[0025] Referring initially to FIG. 1, a test system<br>
30 for measuring conducted receiver sensitivity is<br>
first described. The system 30 illustratively includes<br>
an RF test source 31 coupled to a handheld device<br>
receiver 32 to be tested via an RF cable 33. By way of<br>
example, the handheld device receiver 32 may be a<br>
Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) receiver,<br>
a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) receiver, and/or<br>
an Enhanced Data Rates for Global System for Mobile<br>
Communications (GSM) Evolution (EDGE) receiver, for<br>
example. Of course, other suitable wireless receivers<br>
may also be used.<br>
[0026] In addition, the RF source 31 may be one of a<br>
Rohde and Schwartz universal radio communication tester<br>
CMU 200 or an Agilent 8960 base station emulator, for<br>
example, although other suitable emulators and/or RF<br>
test sources may also be used. A test controller 34 is<br>
connected to the handheld device receiver 32 for<br>
performing various test operations and measurements,<br>
which will be discussed in further detail below. It<br>
should be noted that while the RF source 31 and test<br>
controller 34 are illustrated as separate components in<br>
the FIG. 1, the functions of the RF source and test<br>
controller may in fact be performed by the same base<br>
station emulator, for example. Alternately, the test<br>
controller 34 could be a computer or computing device<br>
separate from the RF source 31, as will be appreciated<br>
by those skilled in the art.<br>
[0027] Path loss plays an important role in the<br>
accuracy of a radio conducted sensitivity measurement<br>
as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. One<br>
difficulty of performing a path loss measurement in a<br>
test configuration, however, is that typical base<br>
station emulators only report a receiver accuracy level<br>
of ±1 dB, as noted above, even though the internal<br>
amplifier of the receiver 32 may have much greater<br>
accuracy, for example, of about ±0.1 dB. By obtaining<br>
sign change information in the receiver power level,<br>
the path loss accuracy can therefore be improved to<br>
±0.1 dB, as will be discussed further below.<br>
[0028] In the case of a conducted receiver<br>
sensitivity test, the path loss cf the cable 33 that<br>
connects the receiver 32 and the base station emulator<br>
31 can be well calibrated. One relatively<br>
straightforward accurate path loss measurement involves<br>
changing the internal amplification of the receiver 32<br>
by 0.1 dB increments until the desired RSSI edge point<br>
is obtained. However, if the starting point is .9 dB<br>
from the edge point, it will take many steps and,<br>
therefore, increased measurement time to find the edge<br>
point. Accordingly, more complex test schemes may be<br>
used to reduce the number of steps that will be<br>
required on average to find the edge point and,<br>
therefore, reduce test times.<br>
[0029] For example, one slightly more complex<br>
approach is illustrated in FIG. 9. Beginning at Block<br>
110, the desired TCH power level is first set on the RF<br>
source 31, at Block 111. The internal amplification<br>
level of the receiver 32 is first changed by a coarse<br>
increment, such as the difference between the reported<br>
RSSI of the receiver and the TCH power level or other<br>
integer value, at Block 112. The edge is then found by<br>
changing the internal amplification level of the<br>
receiver using a fine increment (e.g., 0.1 dB) until<br>
the edge transition is observed to provide the path<br>
loss, at Blocks 113-114, at which point the internal<br>
amplification value of the receiver 32 may be set<br>
and/or recorded (Block 115), thus concluding the<br>
illustrated method (Block 116).<br>
[0030] Stated alternatively, the "coarse" search<br>
changes the internal amplification by the difference<br>
between TCH level and reported RSSI. Since in the<br>
present example the reported RSSI is an integer value,<br>
this gives an accuracy of ±1 dB. The "fine" search then<br>
determines the edge between two consecutive RSSI<br>
«<br>
readings.<br>
[0031] Other variations of the coarse-fine edge<br>
point detection approach may also be used. Generally<br>
speaking, the coarse portions of these searches are<br>
fairly similar, so particular attention will be given<br>
herein to the variations in the fine search that may be<br>
used as appropriate for a given implementation. A fine<br>
search generally includes three stages. First, the RSSI<br>
is set to the desired level by adjusting the internal<br>
amplification and the TCH level of the base station<br>
emulator. Next, the internal amplification is changed<br>
in a series of successively decreasing increments to<br>
find the edge. These increments should narrow to 0.1 dB<br>
(or the accuracy of the given internal amplifier) to<br>
ensure the accuracy is also 0.1 dB. Finally, it may be<br>
necessary to "step back" to the edge point, as the<br>
measurements may have left off 0.1 dB from the desired<br>
RSSI.<br>
[0032] Another example of a fine search is now<br>
described with reference to FIG. 10. Beginning at Block<br>
120, the RSSI is set to the desired level, at Block<br>
121, and the internal amplification changed in 0.2 dB<br>
increments until the desired RSSI is no longer<br>
reported, at Blocks 122-123. That is, after a number of<br>
steps (typically between one and five), the returned<br>
RSSI will not match the desired level since the<br>
internal amplification will have jumped the edge by 0.1<br>
or 0.2 dB. Thus, decreasing or "stepping back" the<br>
internal amplification level in 0.1 dB increments will<br>
find the edge point either in one or two steps, at<br>
Blocks 124-125 (depending upon whether the edge was<br>
jumped by 0.1 or 0.2 dB) , thus concluding the<br>
illustrated method (Block 126).<br>
[0033] Another fine search process is now described<br>
with reference to FIG. 11. Beginning at Block 130, the<br>
RSSI is set to the desired level, as discussed above,<br>
and then the internal amplification is increased by 0.3<br>
dB increments until the RSSI is no longer the desired<br>
value, at Blocks 131-133. Once the RSSI changes, two<br>
consecutive 0.1 dB scans will yield a change in RSSI,<br>
thus locating an edge, at Blocks 136-138, and the<br>
internal amplification is decreased by 0.1 dB (Block<br>
139), thus concluding the illustrated method. For<br>
example, if the sum total change is 0.1 dB (e.g. +0.2<br>
and then -C.I dB, totaling +0.1 dB) and this produces a<br>
change in RSSI, an edge has been found. Alternatively,<br>
if the internal amplification is changed three times<br>
(i.e., 0.9 dB) without the RSSI changing from the<br>
desired value, at Block 134, an edge is also located,<br>
as a 1.0 dB change will change the RSSI since they are<br>
reported in integers.<br>
[0034] Another exemplary approach is now described<br>
with reference to FIG. 12. Beginning at Block 140, a<br>
starting actual RSSI value is -80.47 dB, and the<br>
reported RSSI is -80 db (Block 141). The internal<br>
amplification is then increased by 0.6 dB, at Block<br>
142, changing the actual RSSI value to -79.87 dB, and<br>
the reported RSSI to -79 db (Block 143), indicating<br>
that the edge has been crossed. The next step is a 0.3<br>
dB decrease, at Block 144, which changes the actual<br>
RSSI value to -80.17 dB, and the reported RSSI back tc<br>
-80 db (Block 145), indicating the edge has been<br>
crossed back over. As such, the internal amplification<br>
is increased by 0.1 dB, at Block 146, changing the<br>
actual RSSI value to -80.07 dB, and the reported RSSI<br>
remains at -80 db (Block 147), meaning the edge was not<br>
crossed. Accordingly, another 0.1 dB increase is<br>
performed (Block 148), which changes the actual RSSI<br>
value to -79.97 dB, and also changes the reported RSSI<br>
to -79 dB, thus locating the edge (Block 149), and<br>
concluding the illustrated method, at Block 150.<br>
[0035] It will be appreciated by those skilled in<br>
the art that many different edge location schemes may<br>
be used. The first, and each successive, jump is<br>
typically any number from 0.1 to 0.9 dB. Jump values<br>
can change or remain constant for each step. To choose<br>
an appropriate method for a given application,<br>
variation of the data and average performance are<br>
important considerations. For example, with relatively<br>
"flat" data the approach illustrated in FIG. 9 may<br>
locate the edge quicker than the approach illustrated<br>
in FIG. 10, but the opposite may be true for "sloped"<br>
data, potentially by up to three steps.<br>
[0036] Still another approach now described with<br>
reference to FIG. 13 is a five-step path loss scheme.<br>
Beginning at Block 151, the reported RSSI for a given<br>
TCH level is obtained, at Block 152. The first step<br>
includes determining if the reported RSSI is the same<br>
as the TCH level, at Block 153. If so, the method<br>
proceeds to step two. If not, the internal<br>
amplification is increased (or decreased depending upon<br>
the particular implementation) by the difference of the"<br>
reported RSSI minus the given TCH level, at Block 154.<br>
The new reported RSSI is then obtained (Block 152), and<br>
for steps two through four the internal amplification<br>
is changed in successively decreasing increments of 0.5<br>
dB, 0.2 dB, and 0.1 dB, at Block 156.<br>
[0037] If the reported RSSI is not the same as the<br>
last reported RSSI after each of these changes, then<br>
the sign is changed before the next step (Block 158) to<br>
step in the opposite direction (i.e., back toward the<br>
edge). Once the first four steps are completed, the<br>
fifth step involves once again determining if the<br>
reported RSSI is the same as the last reported RSSI, at<br>
Block 160, and if so changing the internal<br>
amplification by 0.1 dB once again (which will be the<br>
edge) and obtaining the reported RSSI, at Blocks 161,<br>
162, to conclude the illustrated method (Block 159).<br>
This approach is advantageous in that it will converge<br>
on the edge point within five steps, which provides<br>
good overall results for different curve types.<br>
[0038] Use of a path loss search in a test method<br>
for determining conducted radio frequency (RF) receiver<br>
sensitivity for a plurality of channels extending over<br>
one or more frequency bands will now be described with<br>
reference to FIGS. 3 and 4. As will be appreciated by<br>
those skilled in the art, receiver sensitivity is<br>
defined based upon a traffic channel (TCH) power level<br>
at a desired bit error rate (BER). BER is an "end-toend"<br>
performance measurement which quantifies the<br>
reliability of the entire radio system from "bits in"<br>
to "bits out," including the electronics, antennas and<br>
signal path in between.<br>
[0039] Aside from the relatively poor reporting<br>
accuracy of receiver test equipment, another difficulty<br>
in determining receiver sensitivity is that it can be a<br>
very time consuming process. That is,"there are<br>
typically numerous channels within a cellular band, and<br>
a cellular device may operate over multiple bands, as<br>
noted above. Thus, a sensitivity measurement covering<br>
all of the channels used by a device may take many<br>
hours, and even days, to complete.<br>
[0040] To reduce receiver sensitivity measurement<br>
times, a relatively fast sensitivity search algorithm<br>
is preferably used. Beginning at Block 40, if the path<br>
loss of the RF cable 33 is not already known, using one<br>
of the above-described path loss searches (or others) a<br>
path loss function may advantageously be determined, at<br>
Block 48'. More particularly, path loss associated with<br>
the RF cable 33 will be different for different<br>
channels (i.e., frequencies), but there will be a<br>
generally linear relation between these path loss<br>
values. Accordingly, by determining the path loss of<br>
two separate channels (e.g., the first and last<br>
channels in the band), a linear path loss function for<br>
the RF cable 33 can be quickly generated. This provides<br>
a quick and accurate approximation of path losses for<br>
all of the channels, although the path loss for each<br>
channel could be measured separately in some<br>
embodiments, if desired.<br>
[0041] Furthermore, a BER versus TCH power level<br>
function is determined for an initial channel,, at Block<br>
41. The initial channel could be any channel in the<br>
band, but for explanation purposes it will be assumed<br>
to be the first channel in the band. It has been found<br>
that given enough sampling frames, the general shape of<br>
the TCH power level vs. BER function for a given<br>
channel in a frequency band will be essentially the<br>
same for all of the remaining channels in the band.<br>
This is due to fact that the function is determined by<br>
the modulation scheme and digital signal processing<br>
(DSP) algorithm of the handheld device. By way of<br>
example, GPRS has a GMSK modulation scheme. Since the<br>
relationship for BER vs. energy per bit has an<br>
exponential form, the BER vs. TCH level function also<br>
takes the form of an exponential. Thus, once the shape<br>
of this function is found for one channel, this<br>
function can be used to rapidly locate the TCH<br>
level/target BER point for each of the following<br>
channels, as will be discussed further below.<br>
[0042] In particular, the BER versus TCH power level<br>
function is determined for the initial channel by<br>
measuring respective TCH power levels for a plurality<br>
of BEP.s within a target BER range, and determining the<br>
BER versus TCH power level function based upon the<br>
measured BERs in the target BER range (i.e., curve<br>
fitting based upon the measured values), at Block 41'.<br>
Typically speaking, only BER values within a particular<br>
target range will be of interest because values outside<br>
of this range will result in dropped connections, etc.<br>
By way of example, the target range may be about one to<br>
three percent, although other target ranges may be<br>
appropriate for different applications. Various curve<br>
fitting approaches, such as a least squares approach,<br>
for generating the BER versus TCH power level function<br>
will be discussed further below.<br>
[0043] To find the edges of the BER target range, a<br>
coarse search may be used that involves stepping the<br>
TCH power level in relatively coarse negative<br>
increments (e.g., -1.5 db) when the measured BER is<br>
less than 0.5, and relatively coarse positive<br>
increments (e.g., +2.0 dB) when the measured BER is<br>
greater than 3.0. This gives a relatively close<br>
approximation of the target range edge points, and<br>
successive measurements within the target range may<br>
then be made at relatively fine TCH power level<br>
increments (e.g., 0.1 dB increments) to provide the<br>
data points for curve fitting.<br>
[0044] Curve fitting is appropriate because BER data<br>
is often accompanied by noise. Even though all control<br>
parameters (independent variables) remain constant, the<br>
resultant^outcomes (dependent variables) vary. A<br>
process of quantitatively estimating the trend of the<br>
outcomes, also known as curve fitting, therefore<br>
becomes useful. The curve fitting process fits<br>
equations of approximating curves to the raw field<br>
data, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
[0045] As noted above, the data for the BER vs. TCH<br>
level function is generally exponential. Two exemplary<br>
curve-fitting approaches that may be used to fit an<br>
exponential curve are a least square polynomial<br>
approximation and a non-linear (i.e., exponential)<br>
least square approximation. The theory and<br>
implementation of a least square polynomial<br>
approximation is first described. Since polynomials can<br>
be readily manipulated, fitting such functions to data<br>
that does not plot linearly is common. In the following<br>
example, n is the degree of polynomial and N is the<br>
number of data pairs. If N = n + \, the polynomial passes<br>
exactly through each point. Therefore, the relationship<br>
Nn + \ should always be satisfied.<br>
[0046] Assuming the functional relationship<br>
with errors defined by<br>
where Yt represents the observed or experimental value<br>
corresponding to x,, with xt free of error, the sum of<br>
squares of the errors will be<br>
ss ss ss At a minimum, the partial derivatives  are<br>
Sa0 £a, 8an<br>
zero. Writing the equations for these terms gives nequations as fellows:<br>
This matrix equation is called the normal matrix for<br>
the least-square problem. In this equation are unknown coefficients while x, and Yf are given. The<br>
unknown coefficients can hence be obtained by<br>
solving the above matrix equations.<br>
[0048] To fit the curve Yi, it is required to know<br>
what degree of polynomial should be used to best fit<br>
the data. As the degree of polynomial is increased, the<br>
deviations of the point from the curve is reduced until<br>
the degree of polynomial, n, equals N-\ . At this<br>
point, there is an exact match. In terms of statistics,<br>
the degree of approximating the polynomial is increased<br>
as long as there is a statistically significant<br>
decrease in the variance, r2, which is computed by:<br>
 [0049] The approach illustrated above was programmed<br>
in two exemplary implementations using- C++ and the<br>
normal matrix was solved using two different methods,<br>
namely the Gauss-Jordan approach and LU decomposition,<br>
as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
Although both of these methods produced comparable<br>
results, the LU decomposition method was found to be<br>
more desirable for the least square polynomial<br>
approximation program because LU decomposition provided<br>
desired performance results.<br>
18<br>
[0050] The above noted C++ program was implemented<br>
so that it is able to calculate the coefficient of the<br>
approximated curve fitting equation of varying degree.<br>
Polynomials with degrees of 2, 3, 4 and 5 were used to<br>
fit a curve against BER data values, and it was found<br>
that third degree polynomial produced the most<br>
advantageous results. More particularly, degrees higher<br>
than three did not show any significant improvement in<br>
the fitted curve. Therefore, a third degree polynomial<br>
was used to fit the curve against BER data values.<br>
[0051] The theory and implementation of fitting nonlinear<br>
curves using a least squares approach will now<br>
be described. In many cases data obtained from<br>
experimental tests is not linear. As such, it is<br>
necessary to fit some other function than a firstdegree<br>
polynomial to this data. Some common forms that<br>
may be used are exponential forms of a type y = axb or<br>
y = aebl .<br>
[0052] Normal equations for these forms can again be<br>
developed by setting the partial derivatives equal to<br>
zero, but such nonlinear simultaneous equations are<br>
much more difficult to solve than linear equations.<br>
Because of this, these forms are usually linearized by<br>
taking logarithms before determining the parameters,<br>
for example, lny = \na + b\nx, or Iny = ]na + bx . Then, a new<br>
variable is introduced, i.e., z = hiy as a linear<br>
function of In* or x . In this case, instead of<br>
minimizing the sum of squares of the deviations of Y<br>
from the curve, deviations of \nY are minimized. To<br>
find which form of curve best fits the BER data,<br>
MathCAD mathematical software was used. A BER curve was<br>
plotted using MathCAD and different forms of the curve<br>
were fitted against the BER data. It was found that an<br>
exponential curve defined by y = ce°* provided a desirable<br>
fit for the BER data, although other functions may<br>
provide desired results in different implementations.<br>
[0053] Data linearization is used to fit a curve of<br>
type y = cea to the data points given as<br>
(WiM^z) where x is the independent<br>
variable, y is the dependent variable, and N is the<br>
number of x,y pairs. To linearize the data, a logarithm<br>
of both sides is taken, i.e., \ny = \nc + ax . Then a change<br>
of variable is introduced, namely X = x and Y = \n(y),<br>
which produces the equation Y = aX + ]n(c). This equation<br>
is a linear equation in the variables X and Y, and it<br>
can be approximated with a "least square line" of the<br>
form Y = AX + 8 . However, in this case, ln(y) will be used<br>
for performing least square approximation instead of y .<br>
Comparing the last two equations, it is noticed that<br>
A-a and 5 = ln(c). Thus, a = A and c = eb are used to<br>
construct the coefficients which are then used to fit<br>
the curve y = ce<br>
[0054] This approach was again programmed in C++.<br>
The normal matrix to be solved for this method was only<br>
2x2, which was solved with a relatively high degree of<br>
accuracy. Plotted curves for two different sets of data<br>
using this approach are illustrated in FIGS. 14 and 15.<br>
[0055] Both of the nonlinear exponential least<br>
square and least square polynomial approaches described<br>
above approximated the original data with a relatively<br>
high degree of accuracy. Generally speaking, the<br>
margin of error of the curves generated using these<br>
approaches will result in less than a 0.1 dB margin<br>
of error in the sensitivity measurement. In addition,<br>
the results provided by these methods are also very<br>
close to one another. Below are the results obtained by<br>
performing exponential and least square polynomial<br>
 [0056] For both sets of results, the polynomial fit<br>
had a slightly higher correlation coefficient than the<br>
exponential fit. However, the standard error for the<br>
polynomial fit in data set 2 was smaller than for the<br>
exponential fit, but in data set 1 the standard error<br>
for the exponential fit was smaller than the polynomial<br>
fit. <br>
[0057] Based on these results, the exponential fit<br>
model was deemed to be more preferable because it did<br>
not require inclusion of as many terms as the cubic<br>
function. This is because the exponential model y=aebx<br>
provides almost the same accuracy (i.e., up to about<br>
the third decimal place) as that of the polynomial<br>
method, and it also has a physical interpretation of<br>
all the terms in it. Of course, the polynomial method<br>
or other approaches may be used in various applications<br>
as appropriate, as will be appreciated by those skilled<br>
in the art.<br>
[0058] Generally speaking, if the data to be used in<br>
curve fitting does not appear to be approximated by a<br>
straight line, then there are often equations which can<br>
be used to fit the data very well. The first thing that<br>
comes to mind when considering the type of curve to fit<br>
to the data is a polynomial. This is because<br>
polynomials can be applied without much forethought and<br>
they are typically successful in matching the shape of<br>
the graphed data. However, when a higher degree<br>
polynomial is chosen to fit the data, it may be<br>
difficult to determine a theoretical basis for the<br>
coefficients in the polynomial equation. It is<br>
preferable to have such a basis for why a particular<br>
model is chosen, and that model should have some type<br>
of physical interpretation of each of the parameters in<br>
it.<br>
[0059] Advantages of using linearizable equations<br>
to fit data are notable. Typically, curves of this<br>
type are somewhat easier to understand or predict<br>
than polynomials. That is, proper choice of the<br>
curve to fit the data can lead to insight concerning<br>
underlying mechanisms which produce the data.<br>
Secondly, manipulations of these curves such as<br>
differentiation, integration, interpolation and<br>
extrapolation can be made more confidently than can<br>
those with polynomials. Third, linearizable curves<br>
often require fewer numbers of parameters for<br>
estimation of values than do polynomials. As a<br>
result, the normal matrix may be small and can be<br>
solved with a relatively high degree of accuracy.<br>
Thus, this reduces the need to solve large sets of<br>
linear equations which often have an undesirable<br>
property of ill-conditioning. Thus, for BER data,<br>
Applicants have determined that it is generally<br>
desirable to use nonlinear forms such as logarithms,<br>
inversions, and exponentials to find the linearizable<br>
curve to match the shape of the data before resorting<br>
to a higher degree polynomial.<br>
[0060] Having generated the BER vs. TCH power level<br>
function for the initial channel based upon measured<br>
BER values within the target range, this function may<br>
then be used to advantageously perform a fast search<br>
for the desired BER and corresponding TCH power level<br>
value in each of the subsequent channels in a given<br>
frequency band. First, an estimated or starting TCH<br>
power level for the subsequent channel is chosen based<br>
upon the BER vs. TCH power level function and the<br>
desired BER, at Block 42. That is, an estimate of the<br>
TCH power level that will correspond to the desired BER<br>
in the subsequent channel is determined and used as a<br>
starting point to hone in on the actual TCH power level<br>
for the desired BER. For purposes of the present<br>
discussion, a desired BER of 2.44% will be assumed,<br>
although other desired BERs may be appropriate based<br>
upon the given standard or carrier requirement that is<br>
to be met, as will be appreciated by those skilled in<br>
the art.<br>
 [0061] It should be noted that the estimated TCH<br>
power level may be chosen based upon the path loss<br>
function noted above. That is, one approach to<br>
determining the estimated TCH power level for the<br>
subsequent channel is to use the TCH power level for<br>
the initial channel that corresponds to the desired BER<br>
(i.e., 2.44%) and offset this value by the difference<br>
between the initial and subsequent channel path loss<br>
values on the path loss function (or actual measured<br>
values if a path loss function is not used), as will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art (Block 42').<br>
[0062] Once the estimated TCH power level is<br>
determined, then the BER of the subsequent channel is<br>
measured based thereon, at Block 43. If the measured<br>
BER is not within the target BER range (e.g., 1.0 to<br>
3.0%), then the above-described coarse step search may<br>
be used to determine a TCH power level that is within<br>
the range. If the measured BER is within the target<br>
range, it is compared with the desired BER value, and<br>
the difference (i.e., delta) therebetween is used along<br>
with the BER vs. TCH power level function to determine<br>
a next estimated TCH power level, at Block 44. From the<br>
above discussion of the TCH power level function, it<br>
will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that<br>
the next estimated TCH power level may be estimated<br>
according to the relationship &amp;BER =bce * kTCHlevel f since<br>
the ABER and the coefficient b are known.<br>
[0063] If the measured BER is not within a threshold<br>
range of the desired BER (e.g., ± 0.15%), at Block 45,<br>
the steps described above with reference to Blocks 43<br>
and 44 are repeated until a TCH power level<br>
corresponding to the desired BER (i.e., within the<br>
threshold range) is found, at Block 46, thus concluding<br>
the method illustrated in FIG. 3. Yet, if still further<br>
accuracy is desired, a linear approximation may be<br>
used, at Block 46' . More particularly, within a<br>
relatively small 0.3% BER range (i.e., the ± 0.15% EER<br>
threshold range), the shape of the BER vs. TCH power<br>
level curve will be approximately linear. Therefore,<br>
this linear relationship may be used to provide still<br>
further accuracy, as will be appreciated by those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
[0064] Turning now to FIGS. 2 and 5, a test system<br>
30' and method for determining RF receiver radiated<br>
sensitivity are now described. The test system 30'<br>
includes the RF source 31' (e.g., a base station<br>
emulator), an RF controlled enclosed environment, and<br>
the wireless handheld device receiver 32'. As will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art, an RF<br>
controlled enclosed environment is an electromagnetic<br>
(EM) wave shield environment, such as the illustrated<br>
EM anechoic chamber 37' (which may be a full or semianechoic<br>
chamber), a shield room or an RF enclosure. An<br>
antenna 35' connected to the RF source 31' is<br>
positioned within the anechoic chamber 37' and<br>
connected to the RF source 31' by a coaxial cable to<br>
simulate a base station. An antenna 36' for the<br>
wireless handheld device is also positioned within the<br>
anechoic chamber 37' and connected to the handheld<br>
receiver 32'. It should be noted that in typical tests<br>
the handheld receiver 32' and antenna 36' will be<br>
carried by a device housing, but these components may<br>
be tested without the device housing if desired.<br>
[0065] Generally speaking, the radiated receiver<br>
sensitivity search is the same as that described above<br>
for a conducted receiver sensitivity search with the<br>
exception of the path loss determination process. More<br>
specifically, the relationship between path loss values<br>
for a plurality of wireless channels in a frequency<br>
band will typically not be a linear function, as is the<br>
case for the RF cable 33. This is because path loss can<br>
be affected by factors such as antenna gain, antenna<br>
directivity and the measurement environment. Typically<br>
the path loss will be different for different wireless<br>
channels.<br>
[0066] Even so, a path loss function may still be<br>
determined for the frequency band using similar<br>
approaches to those described above for determining the<br>
BER vs. TCH power level function (e.g., a least squares<br>
approximation, etc.), at Block 48'. By way of example,<br>
the five-step path loss search described above with<br>
reference to FIG. 13 may be performed on a subset of<br>
the channels within the band, such as every 10th<br>
channel. This approach advantageously allows an<br>
accurate path loss function to be determined for the<br>
entire band to provide path loss estimates for every<br>
channel, yet without taking the time to individually<br>
measure the path loss of each channel. The path loss<br>
function is then used in determining the estimated TCH<br>
power level for the subsequent channel, at Block 42',<br>
as described further above.<br>
[0067] The path loss determination process will now<br>
be described in further detail with reference to FIG.<br>
6. Beginning at Block 60, RF path losses are measured<br>
for at least some of the RF channels within the RF<br>
frequency band, at Block 61. Using the above-noted<br>
example, path loss is measured every M channels. By way<br>
of example, M may be 10, although other intervals may<br>
also be used. An RF path loss function is determined<br>
based upon the measured RF path losses of the at least<br>
some RF channels, at Block 62, and an RF path loss for<br>
at least one other channel within the given RF<br>
frequency band is determined based upon the RF path<br>
loss function, at Block 63, thus concluding the<br>
illustrated method (Block 64).<br>
 [0068] The choice of M generally depends on the<br>
linearity of the system. That is, a linear system would<br>
only require two points to be measured, regardless of<br>
the number of the channels or frequency bandwidth. As<br>
the non-linearity or order of the system increases, the<br>
order of a single curve fitting equation should<br>
correspondingly increase to obtain a proper fitting. A<br>
least squares method, or other non-linear fitting<br>
methods, may be used. Many methods use matrices<br>
inversion where size is relative to the order of the<br>
equation. An inversion is increasingly complex and<br>
error prone as its dimensions increase. The least<br>
squares method requires a matrices inversion. Due to<br>
the nature of radio systems over large frequency spans,<br>
higher order path loss responses can exist.<br>
[0069] Path loss curve fitting may also be performed<br>
using a plurality of splines. That is, many partial<br>
equations replace one complete equation. Sets of<br>
consecutive points (e.g., four consecutive points) are<br>
grouped on a rotating basis. For example, the first<br>
four points are used for generating the first spline<br>
series, the 2nd to 5th points for the second spline<br>
series, and so on. All but the first and last spline<br>
series use only intermediate points (e.g., the equation<br>
from points 2 to 3) as valid fitting equations. Using<br>
intermediate points for the equations leaves the first<br>
and last two points without respective equations.<br>
Different spline methods vary first and last spline<br>
construction. One method, an extrapolated cubic spline,<br>
uses the first two splines of the first series (e.g.,<br>
points 1 to 2), the last two splines of the last'Series<br>
(e.g. points 3 to 4). Other suitable spline fit methods<br>
may also be used, as will be appreciated by those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
 [0070] Referring to FIG. 16, two sine wave curves<br>
produced from respective series of splines are shown.<br>
Each curve is a spline fitting of a sine wave. Each<br>
line is one spline series within the spline fitting.<br>
-The series are offset by -0.5 dB per spline series to<br>
show the overlapping spline series. Without the offset,<br>
the consecutive spline series would overlap. Data was<br>
taken from every 10th point. The upper figure is<br>
constructed of four point splines. The lower figure<br>
shows the upper spline with only the used data<br>
transposed, as mentioned above. The respective sine<br>
curves are offset by 4 dB for clarity purposes. Bold<br>
and dotted lines show the intermediate line<br>
transposition of the upper figure to the lower.<br>
[0071] As noted above, path loss curve fitting<br>
reduces the measurement time of non-measured channels.<br>
Time is improved in systems with consecutive channel<br>
path loss difference exceeding the interpolation error.<br>
Linear interpolation will advantageously result in<br>
typical accuracy of under ±0.1 dB. The path loss method<br>
described above with reference to FIG. 6 may be used<br>
for radiated and conducted path loss measurements, as<br>
will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
[0072] Another factor that may need to be accounted<br>
for in certain path loss/receiver sensitivity test<br>
measurements is the hysteresis of the particular<br>
handheld device under test. More particularly, receiver<br>
path loss is measured by comparing base station<br>
emulator TCH level output against the signal received<br>
by the handheld device and relayed to the emulator as<br>
RSSI. Consecutive 0.1 dB adjustments of the emulator's<br>
amplification will detect a region at which the change<br>
in amplification yields a change in RSSI. At this<br>
"edge" point the radio could oscillate between two RSSI<br>
readings with no amplification change. This edge point<br>
may be caused by system error, changing position or<br>
changing signal intensity, for example. As the RSSI<br>
readings oscillate, the handheld device could respond<br>
by changing its transmitter power in a similar<br>
oscillatory pattern, affecting the handheld power<br>
management. As such, many handheld devices<br>
manufacturers implement software within each mobile<br>
handheld device to change the edge to account for this<br>
problem.<br>
[0073] More particularly, the problematic single<br>
RSSI edge point is divided into two different values.<br>
These two points straddle the actual edge point by an<br>
amount typically less than 0.5 dB, which is set within<br>
the handheld. As the received TCH level changes, the<br>
RSSI edge point will be reported prematurely, as shown<br>
in FIG. 17. This dual-edge system, known as hysteresis,<br>
decreases the likelihood of any oscillations within the<br>
RSSI and TX power control. As the device RSSI<br>
decreases, the reported RSSI to the base station<br>
emulator will change in such a way as to remove any<br>
oscillations if the device RSSI increases by only a<br>
small amount.<br>
[0074] While the hysteresis prevents oscillations,<br>
it also creates an offset from the true RSSI edge. For<br>
a known device with known hysteresis, the value can be<br>
applied as an offset to each channel. For an unknown<br>
device, the hysteresis may need to be determined using<br>
a stepping algorithm, and then factored in to each path<br>
loss channel. The hysteresis is removed to obtain the<br>
true edge point. The hysteresis typically applies to<br>
all channels the same within a given band.<br>
[0075] One exemplary method for determining path<br>
loss including a hysteresis search is now described<br>
with reference to FIG. 7. It should be noted that this<br>
approach may be used either for conducted path less or<br>
radiated path loss, as will be appreciated by those<br>
skilled in the art. Beginning at Block 70, a pair of<br>
hysteresis edges is determined about a given RSSI value<br>
transition at the RF receiver by sweeping RF power<br>
values transmitted from the RF source in increasing and<br>
decreasing directions, at Block 71. A relationship is<br>
determined between the relatively fine granularity RF<br>
power values and the relative coarse granularity RSSI<br>
values using the hysteresis transition edges, at Block<br>
72. More particularly, since the RSSI transition point<br>
for the receiver 32 or 32' is located half-way between<br>
the hysteresis transition edges, the location of the<br>
actual RSSI transition relative to the TCH power level<br>
may be determined once the TCH power levels<br>
corresponding to the hysteresis transition edges are<br>
known. RF path loss for a given channel may then be<br>
determined based upon a given RSSI at a given RF power<br>
value and the determined relationship between the<br>
relatively fine granularity RF power values and the<br>
relative coarse granularity RSSI values, at Block 73,<br>
thus concluding the illustrated method (Block 74).<br>
[0076] The scan finds the edge point as the TCH<br>
level is increased and decreased. By way of example,<br>
the coarse granularity RSSI values may be in 1.0 dB<br>
increments (i.e., the reported accuracy of the handheld<br>
receiver), while the relatively fine granularity<br>
increments may be 0.1 dB (i.e., the accuracy of the<br>
internal receiver amplifier(s)). To find the first<br>
edge, the internal amplification of the receiver may be<br>
increased in +0.1 dB increments until the edge is<br>
found. Then, a +1.0 dB step may be taken, followed by a<br>
series of -0.1 dB steps until the second edge is found.<br>
The actual RSSI value will be located half-way between<br>
the two edges. It should be noted that the direction<br>
first measured has no bearing on the results, as either<br>
30<br>
edge can be found first. That is, the first hysteresis<br>
edge could be found with -0.1 dB steps, followed by a -<br>
1.0 dB step and +0.1 dB steps to find the second<br>
hysteresis edge, as will be appreciated by those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
[0077] Further aspects of the test method are now<br>
described with reference to FIG. 8. The RF source 31 or<br>
31' transmits RF power values at a relatively fine<br>
granularity, and the RF receiver 32 or 32' generates<br>
RSSI values at a relatively coarse granularity and have<br>
an unknown hysteresis about each transition between<br>
adjacent RSSI values, as noted above. A signal is<br>
transmitted from the RF source 31 or 31' at an initial<br>
RF power level, and a corresponding initial RSSI value<br>
of the RF receiver 32 or 32' is measured, at Block 80'.<br>
An initial internal amplification of the RF source 31<br>
or 31' is set based upon a difference between the<br>
initial RF power level and the corresponding initial<br>
RSSI value, at Block 75', to thereby calibrate the RF<br>
receiver 32 or 32' with the RF source.<br>
[0078] In addition, the method may also include<br>
repeating the three determining steps for at least one<br>
other given RF channel in the given RF frequency band<br>
to determine a plurality of RF path losses, at Blocks<br>
76' and 77', and determining an RF path loss function<br>
based upon the plurality of RF path losses at Block<br>
78', using a least squares algorithm, a plurality of<br>
splines, etc., as discussed further above. An RF path<br>
loss for at least one other channel within the given RF<br>
frequency band may then be determined based upon the RF<br>
path loss function, at Block 79' .<br>
[0079] Many modifications and other embodiments of<br>
the invention will come to the mind of one skilled in<br>
the art having the benefit of the teachings presented<br>
in the foregoing descriptions and the associated<br>
drawings. Therelore, it is understood that the<br>
