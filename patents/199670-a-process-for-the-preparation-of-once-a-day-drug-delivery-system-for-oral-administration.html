				<td>The invention relates to a process for the preparation of a once-a-day delivery system in the form of an oral controlled release solid dosage form comprising an effective amount of drug.<br>
The most commonly employed route of administration is oral ingestion. However, an oral formulation is subjected to highly variable conditions during its transit through gastro- intestinal tract. Also, the salient aspect of drug delivery by known conventional immediate release dosage forms, is the fluctuation between high and low concentrations within each dosing interval. The traditional pharmaceutical forms generally releases the drug in a period of few minutes to 2 hours after administration, making frequent ingestion of multiple doses per day, a necessity. Such an administration results in wide variations in serum concentration throughout the course of treatment. The approach to control the duration of drug release and to maintain the drug at a predictable, specified concentration in vivo, offers many advantages over other forms of medication.<br>
The convenience of using a drug delivery system which releases drug over a prolonged period of time as opposed to the immediate release formulations, has long been recognized in the practice of medicine. The preferred therapeutic advantage to the patient and the clinician is controlled and optimum blood levels during the period of drug release from the delivery system, thereby, also reducing symptomatic side effects. Further, another advantage of longer acting drug preparations would be both increased convenience and improved patient compliance resulting from the avoidance of missed doses through patient forgetfulness. Oral controlled release delivery systems should ideally be adaptable so that release rates and profiles can be matched to physiological and chronotherapeutic specifications.<br>
To design an optimum oral controlled release system, it is necessary to take into account the physicochemical and physiological environment of the gastrointestinal tract. The gastric residence time is subject to very significant interindividual variations and is inter alia dependent on the nutritional habits of the individual. Meals of high calorific value, especially fats, have an inhibitory effect on gastric emptying. However, upon oral administration, the drug formulation usually traverses the stomach in about 1-2 hours. The relatively short gastric residence time necessitates frequent oral administration for drugs having an "absorption window" in the upper gastrointestinal tract. The conventional approaches to controlled release formulation known in the art are not applicable to such a class of drugs. Slow release formulations of such drugs may only be effective for about 4-5 hours whereafter the formulation passes into the colon and the drug absorption reaches the minimum. The means for achieving retention of drug formulations in the proximal region of the gastrointestinal tract, and for controlled release of such drugs therein has been a long<br>
sought objective. An example of such a drug is ofloxacin.  Ofloxacin, chemically known as (p)-9-f]uoro-2,3-dihydro-3-methyl-10-(4-methyl-1 -piperazinyl)-7-oxo-7H-pyrido[ 1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid, and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts have been described in the European patent No. 47005 that is assigned to Daiichi Seiyaku.<br>
The bioavailability of ofloxacin is highly dependent on the local physiology of the gastrointestinal tract. It is readily soluble in the acidic environment of the stomach. In 0. IN HC1 media, it is classified as "soluble" having a solubility of 5.8% w/v. In buffer of pH 4.5, ofloxacin is "slightly soluble" with solubility of only about 0.9% w/v. In media of still higher pH (about 6.8) the solubility falls even more drastically. This pH related solubility adversely affect the drug dissolution and hence absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Due to greater solubility of ofloxacin in lower pH media, better drug bioavailability can be ensured by extended residence of the dosage form in the stomach. In the intestine, where pH is normally above 4.0, the release of the drug may be adversely affected owing to lower solubility which may further influence the rate and extent of drug absorption, thus affecting both peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and bioavailability (Area Under the Curve, AUC). It is readily apparent that a custom designed once-a-day delivery system, which is retained in the stomach and which slowly release medicament over an extended period of time would be eminently suited for this class of drugs in general and ofloxacin in particular. Such a controlled release dosage form is provided by the present invention.<br>
The literature discloses various approaches for therapeutic dosage forms which are designed to deliver the drug in the upper regions of the gastrointestinal tract and possess controlled release characteristics.<br>
One such approach mentioned in prior art makes use of a therapeutic system which swells highly in the stomach and consequently cannot pass through the pylorus. U.S. Patent No. 5,780,057, for example, describes a pharmaceutical tablet having a multilayer structure wherein at least one layer swells remarkably in the presence of biological aqueous fluids resulting in an increase by at least 50% of the total volume of the tablet and thereby exhibits a high residence time in the stomach and/or in the upper portion of the gastrointestinal tract. The said layer, being a granular mixture of biocompatible hydrophilic polymers and highly swellable (super disintegrating) polymers, acts as a barrier and modulates the slow release of the active ingredient from the pharmaceutical dosage form. The expanded dosage forms may block the pyloric sphincter or may cause unfavourable conditions following multiple dosing resulting from retention of swollen dosage units in the stomach.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,651,985 discloses a composition comprising 30-90%, by weight of the composition, homogenous mixture of polymers containing lactam groups and polymers containing carboxyl groups as gel forming agents which markedly swells to form a gel of high mechanical and dimensional stability in the aqueous environment of the stomach. The swelling polymers required for such dosage forms are in very high concentration which makes such delivery systems very large and inconvenient for oral administration of high dosage medicaments, such as ofloxacin with a daily dose requirement of 400-800 mg.<br>
Other techniques which have been described in the prior art for increasing the gastric residence time include buoyant systems which float in the gastric fluids solely as a result of the low specific gravity of its matrix formulation. U.S. Patent No. 4,126,672 discloses formulations comprising finely particulate, homogeneous mixture of chlordiazepoxide and diazepam in combination with a hydrocolloid or mixtures of hydrocoUoids so as to have bulk density of less than one and be hydrodynamically balanced when in contact with gastric fluid. U.S. Patent No. 4,167,558 relates to formulations comprising a homogenous mixture of acetylsalicylic acid with a hydrocolloid which are hydrodynamically balanced so that, in contact with gastric fluid, they possess a bulk density of less than one and therefore are buoyant in gastric fluid and thus are retained in the stomach during the time when substantially all of the medicaments are released therefrom. The composition exemplified in these prior arts contain very high amounts of polymers (hydrocoUoids) which upon contact with gastric fluids swell to form a soft gelatinous mass of bulk density less than one which thereafter slowly dissolves to release the medicament. The release of medicament is also sasd to take place by leaching action at or near the surface. However, it is well recognized that the application of such a system to obtain the desired rate of release of the drug wherein it is regulated by the erosion of the polymer, is difficult to maintain. Further, as the concentration of polymers required for such a system is very high, such a system is not suitable for high dose medicaments. Furthermore, the specific gravity of digestive fluids, especially that of gastric juices is from 1.004 to 1.101 and it is well ascertainable by those skilled in formulation development that it may be difficult to maintain low specific gravity for the sustained release composition as described in these prior arts, for a prolonged period. Also, as stated in their specification, for the successful practice of their invention, the hydrocoUoids utilized must hydrate in acidic pH which limits the selection of polymers for the formulation scientist.<br>
Still other techniques are directed towards use of multiparticulate systems to increase the gastric residence time as described in US Patent No. 5,007,790.   This patent unveils a sustained release<br>
oral drug dosage form comprising a plurality of solid particles of a solid-state drug dispersed within a hydrophilic, water swellable polymer that swells on imbibition of gastric fluid to increase the particle size to a level that promotes retention in the stomach over said time period, permitting dissolution of the dispersed drug and release of the resulting solution through a leaching action. The swellable polymer is said to maintain its physical integrity for at least a substantial portion of the time period during which the drug is released into the stomach and thereafter, rapidly dissolves. It is well recognized by those skilled in the art that it may be difficult to obtain the desired rate of release for a drug that has a high water solubility from multiparticulate systems as described in this patent, in which the drug first undergoes dissolution followed by release of the resulting solution by leaching action.<br>
As aforementioned, several pharmaceutical compositions are described in the reference literature which relates to controlled release drug delivery systems. However, for the above stated reasons and because the prior art discloses either complicated devices and systems which are difficult to manufacture on the industrial scale or the components used therein are not so user friendly, none of the oral controlled drug delivery systems heretofore described, is completely satisfactory.<br>
Our allowed Indian Patent Application No. 2660/DEL/97 describes a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition in the form of tablets or capsules which provides a combination of spatial and temporal control of drug delivery when ingested by a patient. The pharmaceutical composition constitutes an oral controlled drug delivery system, comprising a drug, a gas generating component, a swelling agent, a viscolyzing agent and optionally a gel forming polymer. The viscolyzing agent and the gel forming polymer form a hydrated gel matrix which entraps the gas, causing the tablet or capsule to retain in the stomach or upper part of the small intestine (spatial control) and also creates a tortuous diffusion path for the drug, resulting in sustained release of the drag (temporal control). However, such a system is not suitable for once-a-day delivery of drugs which are readily soluble in the acidic environment of the stomach.<br>
Therefore, there has not previously been a fully satisfactory and economical formulation for providing a predictable and uniform treatment regimen for oral administration and that have the further advantage of simplifying treatment and improving patient compliance while both enhancing the bioavailability of the active ingredient and prolonging the release of the drug.<br>
Our co-pending Indian patent application No.856/Del/2000 describes a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition in the form of an oral controlled release solid dosage form<br>
comprising an effective amount of ofloxacin or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The pharmaceutical composition constitutes an oral drug delivery system, comprising ofloxacin in combination with a polymeric matrix characterized in that at least one such polymer is carboxyvinyl polymer, an alkaline reacting compound and optionally, other pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary components.<br>
The invention is directed to a dosage form exhibiting controlled release of ofloxacin which is attained through a polymeric matrix that contains carboxyvinyl polymer. These polymers are prepared by polymerizing monomers principally consisting of acrylic acid. Due to the presence of free carboxylic acid residues, an aqueous solution of this polymer is acidic in nature. Neutralization of this solution cross-links and gelatinizes the polymer to form a viscous integral structure. Upon contact with gastric fluids, the polymer is presumably neutralized in the presence of the alkaline compound to form the gel structure which regulates the drug release from the delivery system.<br>
It has now been discovered that cellulose ethers, in particular, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose when added to the pharmaceutical compositions described in Indian patent application No. 856/Del/2000 extends the in-vitro drug release profile to about 10 hours. Further, it exhibits the drug release that is better controlled and sustained.<br>
Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose being hydrophilic in nature hydrates to form a gel layer on exposure to aqueous fluids. The effective release of the medicament is regulated by the slow erosion of this polymer. Carboxyvinyl polymer and cellulose ethers in conjunction with additional polymers recognized in the art of pharmaceutical compounding for release retarding properties together form the controlled release matrix. Drug is entrapped within this polymeric matrix. The rate of release of drug from such a system is primarily dependent on rate of water imbibition, resultant rate of swelling of matrix, drug dissolution and diffusion from the matrix.<br>
The principal of controlled release which characterizes the dosage forms of the subject invention is unique in the art and no teaching has been found which recognizes the application of such a matrix to once-a-day controlled release of drug, as is taught by the present invention.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of an oral controlled drug delivery system of drug that is suitable for once-a-day administration and that:<br>
a.	constitutes carboxyvinyl polymer that gelatinizes in the alkaline environment and regulates<br>
the release of drug.<br>
b.	constitutes hydrophilic polymers that swell upon imbibition of water and further provides<br>
for once-a-day release profile of drug<br>
c.	delivers drug at a controlled rate and exhibits reproducibility of release rate into aqueous<br>
media at the absorptive regions of the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
d.	provides greater efficacy at comparable daily dosages of conventional immediate release<br>
formulations.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of an oral controlled release solid dosage form that maintains its physical integrity and dimensional stability when in contact with gastric fluids and achieves the optimal rate of release of drug. It is a further object of the present invention that a high dose medicament may be incorporated in the therapeutic system without the loss of any of its desirable attributes. The dosage form may possess floating characteristics resulting in extended residency in gastric fluids.<br>
The above-mentioned objects are achieved by virtue of the present invention, which relates to a process for the preparation of a once-a-day delivery system that selectively releases the drug in a controlled manner at the gastric levels and upper parts of the intestine over a prolonged period of time.<br>
The present invention describes a process for the preparation of a once-a-day delivery system, for oral administration in humans for the controlled release of a therapeutic agent comprising an effective amount of drug in combination with a polymeric matrix characterized in that at least one such polymer is carboxyvinyl polymer and which constitutes at least 30% by weight of the total polymeric content and a cellulose ether, an alkaline compound and optionally, other pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary components.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the present invention describes a process for the preparation of a once-a-day delivery system for oral administration in humans for the controlled release of ofloxacin comprising an effective amount of ofloxacin or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts in combination with a polymeric matrix characterized in that at least one such polymer is carboxyvinyl polymer and which constitutes at least 30% by weight of the total polymeric content, an alkaline compound and optionally, other pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary components.<br>
The present invention further describes a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration in humans for the once-a-day delivery system of ofloxacin which releases more than 40% of ofloxacin in less than 4 hours, releases more than 60% of ofloxacin in less than 8 hours and substantially all ofloxacin is released within about 8-10 hours.<br>
The present invention also comprehends a process for the preparation of a therapeutic system either in the form of beads, pellets, granules, tablets and capsules incorporating drug in a polymeric matrix and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants such as swelling agent, diluent and binder. Also, the pharmaceutical dosage form may be optionally coated with a rapidly dissolving water soluble polymer film coat.<br>
The oral once-a-day delivery system of the present invention delivers minimum therapeutic serum levels for about 20 hours and therefore may be administered as a once-a-day dosage regimen. Further, the oral controlled release solid dosage form of the present invention provide greater efficacy at comparable daily dosages of conventional immediate release formulations.<br>
The various components of the present invention are described in more details below.<br>
According to the present invention, the delivery system provides controlled release of at least one therapeutic agent or drug. The drug may be pharmacologically active itself or may be converted into the active form by biotransformation in the body. The drug can be any drug for which therapy would be improved as a result of controlled drug delivery and extended gastric retention.<br>
The medicament or combination of medicaments which are amenable to controlled release therapy utilizing the novel formulations of the present invention include any of those suitable for oral administration and which are readily soluble in the acidic environment of the stomach. The present invention is not to be construed as being limited to any particular medicament or class of medicaments.<br>
The once-a-day formulations of the subject invention are particularly amenable to the administration of medicaments which are predominantly absorbed through the upper portion of the gastro intestinal tract, drugs having pH dependent solubility, i.e., more soluble in the gastric pH as compared to the intestinal pH, drugs having stomach as a site of action which includes H-2 receptor antagonists, antacids, antimuscarinic agents, proton pump inhibitors, drugs active against //. pylori, cytoprotective agents, and the like.<br>
Illustrative examples of drugs that are absorbed predominantly from the upper parts of gastrointestinal tract include ciprofloxacin, cyclosporin, furosemide, metoprolol, oxprenolol, baclofen, allopurinol, sumatriptan, benazepril, enalapril, quinapril, moexipril, indolapril, olindapril, retinapril, spirapril, clilazeprilat, lisinopril, imidapril, benazeprilat, cilazapril, captopril, delapril, tosinopril, libenzapril, pentopril, perindopril, altiopril, quinaprilat, ramipril, spiraprilat, zofenopril, and the like; all of which are suitable for use in the present invention.<br>
Drugs having the stomach as site of action include H-2 receptor antagonists such as ranitidine, famotidine, nizatidine, bifentidine, erbrotidine, nifentidine, roxatidine and cimetidine, and the like; proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole, lansoprazole, pentoprazole, and the like; antacids like magnesium carbonate, aluminium hydoxide, magnesium oxide and simethicone, and the like; cytoprotectives such as sucralphate, carbenoxolone sodium and misoprostol, and the like; antimuscarinic agents like pirenzepine, telenzepine and propanthelene bromide, and the like; drugs active against H. Pylori like bismuth salts such as bismuth subsalicylate, tripotassium dicitratobismuthate, ranitidine bismuth citrate, and the like; antibiotics for example clarithromycin, amoxycillin, and the like; all of which are suitable for use in the present invention.<br>
Other medicaments that are suitable for this invention are drugs having solubility in acidic pH or ones having specific absorption sites in the upper part of the gastro-intestinal tract and those that are subjected to gastro-intestinal first pass metabolism (as in some reports stomach absorption is known to bypass gastrointestinal first pass metabolism) include antihypertensive agents like verapamil, nifedipine, propranolol, nimodipine, nicardipine, amlodipine, prazosin, ketanserin, guanabenz acetate, hydralazide, carvedilol, methyldopa, levodopa, carbidopa; antivirals like acyclovir, inosine, pranobex, zidovudine (AZT), tribavirin, vidarabine; lipid lowering agents like simvastatin, pravastatin, atorvastatin and lovastatin; antipsychotic agents like selegiline; sedatives like midazolam; all of which are suitable for use in the present invention.<br>
The drug itself or its pharmacologically active salt or ester can be used in the present invention. Moreover, combination of drugs that are typically administered together may be included as the drug component.<br>
In a particular preferred embodiment of the present invention the delivery system contains ofloxacin as the drug.<br>
The amount of the drug is that which is typically administered for a given period of time. This includes a pharmaceutical^ effective amount of the drug which is an amount high enough to significantly positively modify the condition to be treated, but low enough to avoid serious side<br>
effects (at a reasonable benefit / risk ratio), within the scope of sound medical judgement. Accordingly, the drug may be present in an amount from about 30% to about 90% by weight of the total weight of the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
According to the present invention the polymeric matrix comprises cellulose ethers which may be selected from the group comprising hydroxypropyl methylcelluloses of different grades, hydroxypropyl celluloses of different grades, hydroxyethyl cellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl ethylcellulose, hydroxyethyl methylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxycellulose and the like.<br>
According to the present invention, the polymeric matrix constitutes carboxyvinyl polymer and cellulose ether in conjunction with other hydrophilic polymers which together regulate the release of drug suitable for once-a-day dosage regimen. The polymers which are amenable to controlled release therapy utilizing the novel therapeutic delivery system of the present invention include any of those suitable for oral administration. The hydrophilic polymer forming the matrix in accordance with this invention is any such polymer that is non-toxic, swells upon imbibition of water and provides for controlled release of the drug. The hydrophilicity of these polymers causes the drug containing matrix to swell upon ingress of water. The hydrophilic water-soluble polymers may be used individually or in combination. Examples of polymers suitable for this invention include the polymers well known in the pharmaceutical art for their release retarding properties and may be selected from the group comprising acrylic polymers such as available as Eudragit RS 30D, Eudragit RL 30D, Eudragit NE 30D, Eudragit RSPO; natural gums as xanthan gum, karaya gum, locust bean gum, guar gum, gelan gum, gum arabic, tragacanth, carrageenan, pectin, agar, alginic acid, sodium alginate and the like.<br>
The amount of polymer relative to the drug may vary depending on the release rate desired, nature of the polymers, their physicochemical characteristics, and other auxiliary components that may be present as the integral part of the formulation. Accordingly, carboxyvinyl polymer constitutes at least 30% by weight of the total polymeric content of the said composition. However, the polymers together may be present in an amount from about 2% to about 25% by weight, and preferably from about 5% to about 15% by weight of the total weight of the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
According to the present invention, the once-a-day delivery system comprises an alkaline compound that aids in gelatinization of carboxyvinyl polymer. Accordingly, any well known and pharmacologically safe inorganic or organic basic compounds may be used. Examples of inorganic<br>
basic salts that may be used in the present invention include ammonium hydroxide, alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, aluminium hydroxide, salts of aluminium, calcium, sodium or potassium carbonate, bicarbonate, sulfites, phosphate or citrate, composite aluminium-magnesium compounds and the like. The examples of organic basic salts that may be used in the present invention include alkanolamines such as methanolamine, ethanolamine, propanolamine, butanolamine, dimethanolamine, diethanolamine, dipropanolamine, dibutanolamine, diisopropanolamine, trimefhanolamine, triethanolamine, tripropanolamine, tributanolamine, aminomefhylpropanol, N-methyl glucamine, tetrahydroxypropyl ethylene diamine, and the like; alkylamines such as methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, butylamine, diethylamine, dipropylamine, isopropylamine, and the like; organic pH buffering substances such as trihydroxymethylaminomethane, and the like.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the once-a-day delivery system contains gas generating agents such as salts of carbonates, bicarbonates and sulfites as the alkaline reacting compound. These agents upon contact with the acidic fluids evolves gas that becomes entrapped within the hydrated matrix and thereby helps in attaining the buoyancy of the dosage form in the gastric fluids. This extends its residency in the stomach and thus prolongs its release in the stomach and upper parts of the small intestine. That is, the system is not transported past the areas of higher solubility for drug prior to releasing all or substantially all of the drug and maximum bioavailability is attained therefrom. Furthermore, the presence of entrapped gas and its expanding pressure affects the influx of the fluids through the pores of the matrix and thus exerts both a hydrodynamic and release controlling effect.<br>
The gas generating agents may be used alone or in combination with an acid source as a couple. The gas generating agent interacts with an acid source triggered by contact with water or simply with gastric fluid to generate carbon dioxide or sulfur dioxide that gets entrapped within the polymeric matrix and thereby extends residency of delivery system in the stomach.<br>
Accordingly, the dosage form may contain an acid source selected from the group comprising edible organic acid, a salt of an edible organic acid or mixtures thereof. The organic acid salts that may be used as the acid source in the present invention include, for example, a monoalkali salt of an organic acid having more than one carboxylic acid functional group, a bialkali metal salt of an organic acid having more than two carboxylic acid functional groups and the like. Examples of organic acids that may be used as the acid source in the present invention include, citric acid or its<br><br>
salts such as sodium citrate or calcium citrate, malic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid or their salts, ascorbic acid or its salts such as sodium or calcium ascorbate, glycine, sarcosine, alanine, taurine, glutamic acid and the like.<br>
The alkaline compound may be present in amounts from about 5% to about 50%, preferably from about 7% to about 35% and more preferably from about 10% to about 30% by weight of the total weight of the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Optionally, there may also be incorporated into the once-a-day delivery system of the present invention, other conventional pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary components known in the art of formulation development such as swelling agent, diluent and binder. It is to be borne in mind, however, that the conventional pharmaceutical auxiliary additives which might adversely affect the rate of release of the drug are not suitable for use therein.<br>
The dosage form in accordance with the present invention may contain a swelling agent from the class of compounds commonly known as superdisintegrants which absorb large amounts of fluid and causes the hydrated gel matrix to swell significantly thereby assisting in regulating the release profile of ofloxacin over a period of time. Examples of swelling agents that may be used in the present invention include cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone, cross-linked carboxymethyl cellulose sodium, sodium starch glycolate, and the like. The swelling agent may be present in an amount from about 5% to about 30%, preferably from about 7% to about 25% and more preferably from about 10% to about 20% by weight of the total weight of the composition.<br>
The dosage form may contain one or more of a water soluble and/or water dispersible diluent. Examples of water soluble diluents that may be used in the present invention include, but are not limited to lactose, calcium sulphate, mannitol, dextrates, dextrin, dextrose, sucrose and the like. Water dispersible diluents which refer to water insoluble pharmaceutical excipients that disperse readily in water include, but are not limited to, cellulose based excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, starches such as corn starch, pregelatinised starch, clays or clay minerals such as kaolin, bentonite, attapulgite and the like.<br>
According to the present invention the dosage form may also include a binder to provide cohesiveness to the powder mass. The binders commonly known to the pharmaceutical art may be used   in   the   present   invention.       Examples   of   the   binders   are   pregelatinised   starch,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, starch paste, gelatin, xeinthan gum, acacia, guar gum, and the like.<br>

The drug release was evaluated in vivo in a randomized, two period, balanced crossover bioavailability study. The study was conducted in 24 healthy adult human subjects between 18-45 years of age where a single dose of ofloxacin OD tablets (800mg) was administered 20 minutes after a high fat breakfast. These were compared with ofloxacin immediate release tablets (Floxin™ 400mg, Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical) which were administered as a b.i.d. regimen. The first oral dose was given within 20 minutes of a high-fat breakfast and the second dose was given 12 hours later after a high-fat meal (dinner). The results of the study are shown in Figure 1. It elucidates the blood profiles of ofloxacin once-a-day tablets.<br>
The OD formulation in accordance with this invention gave a serum concentration time profile desirable for once-a-day dosage form, in that the peak serum concentration (Cmax) was comparable to that for the immediate release drug indicating a similar rate of absorption of ofloxacin. The total<br>
bioavailability of ofloxacin measured as area under the curve [AUC(o-)] was also comparable to that of immediate release tablets given twice daily indicating that all the drug was released from the formulation and absorbed during its transit through gastrointestinal tract.<br>
The AUC above minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at a levels of 1 g/ml for ofloxacin OD also indicated comparable therapeutic efficacy to the immediate release dosage form. These results are recorded in Table 14.<br>
Table 14<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Further, the extent of absorption for the test product was comparable to that for reference product as indicated by the ratio to test to reference (T/R ratio). The once-a-day tablet formulation had bioavailability of 98.19%. Thus, the therapeutic efficacy of the once-a-day dosage form as disclosed in this invention was comparable to the marketed immediate release dosage form of ofloxacin (Floxin™) given in a twice a day regimen.<br>
Similarly, the pharmacokintetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of once-a-day formulation (400mg tablet) were studied in a randomized, two-period, balanced crossover bioavailability study conducted in 18 healthy, adult human subjects, between 18-45 years of age. A single dose of 400mg of ofloxacin OD tablets was administered 20 minutes after breakfast which was compared with immediate release tablets (Floxin™ 200mg, Ortho McNeil Pharmaceuticals) given as a b.i.d. regimen. The first oral dose was given within 20 minutes of the breakfast and the second dose was given 12 hours later after a meal (dinner). The results of the study are recorded in Figure 2 which shows plasma concentration over time of the dosage forms.<br>
The OD formulations showed comparable values for Cmax, AUC and AUC above MIC as shown in Table 15.<br>
Table 15<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Also, the extent of absorption of the test product was comparable to that for reference product as indicated by the T/R ratio and the formulation of the present invention had bioavailbihty of 103.20%. As evident, the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters, which are important measures of therapeutic efficacy of the once-a-day formulation, were comparable to the marketed immediate release dosage form.<br>
