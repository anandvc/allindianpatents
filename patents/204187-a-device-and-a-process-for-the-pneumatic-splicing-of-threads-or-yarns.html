COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
" A DEVICE AND A PROCESS FOR THE PNEUMATIC SPLICING OF THREADS OR YARNS<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
MESDAN S.p.A., a company organized   under law of the Italian Republic of Via IV Novembre 27 - SALO' Brescia, Italy,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a device and a process for the pneumatic splicing of threads or yarns.<br>
The present invention has, as its aim, a device for the<br>
pneumatic splicing of threads or yarns.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention has, as its aim, a<br>
process for the pneumatic splicing of threads or yarns.<br>
Compressed air devices for splicing textile yarns are<br>
known,  commonly,  referred  to  as  air  splicers.  The<br>
qualitative result of the compressed air splicing of<br>
threads is defined by tensile stress resistance .and<br>
appearance,  both  comparable  to  the  corresponding<br>
thread.<br>
It  is  clear  that  the  closer  the  similarity  of<br>
resistance and appearance to the corresponding thread,<br>
the better the splice.<br>
In particular, the known splicing devices have guides<br>
to assist the introduction of the threads, clamping and<br>
cutting  members  for .the  same  threads,  preparation<br>
members for the thread ends, withdrawal members for the<br>
cut threads in the direction of the splice box, and a<br>
splice box made in a casing and equipped with a through<br>
lengthwise slot for the introduction and extraction of<br>
threads,  in which emerge one or more compressed air<br><br>
feed holes or nozzles.<br>
The splice box also has lateral outlet edges for the<br>
discharge of pressurized air.<br>
The  following  is  a  typical  operating  sequence  for 5  devices of this kind: introduction into the device of<br>
the thread ends to be spliced, the clamping and cutting<br>
of threads, opening of the thread ends using compressed<br>
air to remove the twist, withdrawal of the ends in the<br>
direction of the box. 10  At this point, one or more blasts of compressed air are<br>
introduced into the splice box to carry out the proper<br>
splicing.<br>
Lastly,  the spliced thread is released and all the<br>
members return to their initial position. 15  In the above defined splice box, the presence of one or<br>
more entry nozzles and the shape of the box itself<br>
allow the compressed air to be appropriately directed<br>
to perform the splice.<br>
Considering,  in  more  detail,  the  action  of  the 20  compressed air on the thread fibres to be spliced, it<br>
is noted that this performs an interweaving or mixing<br>
action and a winding action of the fibres with each<br>
other.<br>
These two effects are basically present simultaneously<br><br>
in the majority of box shapes used. However, depending on the box sections  and the  position of the  jet nozzles, either the interweaving or the winding action may be prevalent. )  For a better understanding of the phenomenon described it should be noted that, for splice quality the greater the interweaving or joining effect and resistance to tensile stress, the greater is the winding effect and the better is the appearance of the splice itself. )  Moreover, there are yarns which have a propensity for greater interweaving (usually tough, long fibre yarns) and yarns which have a propensity for more winding (usually short fibre yarns, also known as cotton cut). It has been found that a different position of the jet<br>
15  nozzles can be used, in the same box section, to obtain both the interweaving as well as the winding effect. Therefore a patent application has been filed which puts the above principle into practice, by using two different ducts  to transport  the  air  to different<br>
20  nozzles  and with two blasts  of  compressed air  at successive times (one for each duct).<br>
A more effective variant, described in the patent IT 1.251.856, envisages a double sectioned box: a central V-shaped section helps mixing,  into which a nozzle<br><br>
emerges with a special duct and a circular type section at the two ends, with two suitably directed nozzles, one at each end, with their shared duct, to help the winding of the fibres with each other. 5 Air flow in the two ducts is started at different, subsequent moments.<br>
The practical effect is the possibility to use the same box for different yarn types and therefore make the device more suitable for industrial use, without having<br>
10 to replace any parts (the splice box) in order to be able to splice different yarn types.<br>
Nevertheless, both the suggested solutions, which are mentioned above, though valid, are the result of a compromise between sections  and/or  feed nozzles  of<br>
15 compressed air in the box and have not produced wholly satisfactory results on a large number of textile yarns.<br>
Therefore, the aim of the present invention is to produce a device for the pneumatic splicing of threads<br>
20  or yarns which produces excellent resistance and a splice which is very similar in appearance to that of the reference yarn and so for a greater number of yarn types, compared to previous suggested solutions. Another aim of the present invention is to produce a<br><br>
splicing device which can save a considerable amount of time, eliminating unnecessary machine stops for the replacement of the splice box.<br>
Another air of the present invention is to produce a simple and economic splicing device.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a device for the pneumatic splicing of threads or yarns, including one splice box, equipped with lateral outlet edges and with an upper lengthwise slot, through which the aforesaid thread ends are introduced into the aforesaid splice box and through which it is possible to blow in pressurized air into the aforesaid splice box, characterized in that it envisages means to open and close, at least partially, the aforesaid lateral outlet edges so as to be able to carry out an initial introduction of at least one blast of compressed air into the aforesaid splice box when the lateral outlet edges are mostly closed, and a second introduction of at least one blast of compressed air into the aforesaid splice box when the lateral outlet edges are mostly or completely open.<br>
According to the present invention there is also provided a process for the pneumatic splicing of threads or yarns using the device, said process comprises at least the following stages: the introduction into a splice box, belonging to a splicing device, of the thread ends to be spliced together; clamping and cutting of the aforesaid threads; detwisting and opening of thread ends using compressed air and withdrawal of the ends in the direction of the splice box; an initial introduction of at least one blast of compressed air into the aforesaid splice box when it is mostly closed at its lateral outlet edges, in order to help mixing; the opening of the lateral outlet edges; a second introduction of at least one blast of compressed air into the aforesaid splice box when this is at least partially open at the lateral outlet edges, in order to help winding, release of the spliced thread and the return of all members to their initial position.<br>
In addition,. further characteristics of the present invention are defined in the following claims.<br>
Further aims and advantage of the present invention will become apparent from the description that follows and from the enclosed designs, supplied simply as explanatory, non-limiting examples, in which:<br>
-Figure 1 shows a partially sectioned view of a device for the pneumatic splicing of threads or yarns, according to the present invention, in an initial operating position;<br>
-Figure 2 shows a top view of the device in figure 1, in an initial operating position;<br><br>
Figure 3 shows a partially sectioned view of the<br>
device in figure 1 in a second operating position;<br>
Figure 4 shows a top view of the device in figure 2,<br>
in a second operating position; 5  -  Figure 5 shows a partially sectioned view of the<br>
device in figure 1 in a third operating position; and<br>
Figure 6 shows a top view of the device in figure 2,<br>
in a third operating position; With particular reference to the figures mentioned, the 10  device for the pneumatic splicing of threads or yarns, according to the present invention, is comprehensively denoted by reference number 10.<br>
In such device 10,  there is a splice box 11,  with lateral  outlet  edges  12  and  13  through which  are 15  introduced the thread ends 14 and 15 to be spliced together.<br>
The splice box 11 has an upper lengthwise slot 30 which may be closed above by a cover 16, assembled on a first arm 17 movable around a hinge 18. 20 In addition, the device 10 has a second arm 19 which is driven by a piston 20, to which it is joined by a hinge 21.<br>
The second arm 19 can turn round a fulcrum 22, fixed to a support 23, and ending in two rods 24 and 25.<br><br>
The piston 20 is joined to a spring 26 and to a box 27<br>
for the entry of pressurized air, equipped with an air<br>
inlet 28 and air outlet (not shown).<br>
The functioning of the pneumatic splicing device is 5  briefly described as follows.<br>
First of all, the thread ends 14 and 15 to be spliced<br>
together are introduced into the splice box 11 of the<br>
device 10.<br>
Then the splice box 11 and, in particular, the upper 10  lengthwise slot 30 is closed by the cover 16 which, due<br>
to the downward movement of the first arm 17, assumes<br>
the closed position as in figure 3 and the threads are<br>
clamped  and  cut  by  clamps  and  shears,  known  in<br>
themselves and thus not shown. 15  Therefore the thread ends are opened using compressed<br>
air which causes their detwisting and the thread ends<br>
14 and 15 are pulled back in the direction of the<br>
splice box 11.<br>
At this point an initial introduction of one or more 20  suitably timed blasts of compressed air is made into<br>
the splice box 11,  which is partly closed at the<br>
lateral outlet edges 12 and 13, by the rods 24 and 25<br>
belonging to the second arm 19.<br>
This initial introduction of compressed air is carried<br><br>
out to help mixing.<br>
Afterwards, the lateral outlet edges 12 and 13 of the splice box 11 are completely opened by the raising of the second arm 19, with the aid of the pneumatically 5  operated piston 20.<br>
The splice box 11,  can be equipped with a central<br>
transverse slot 32  to allow the air introduced to<br>
escape.<br>
As  an  alternative  or  in  addition,  this  central<br>
10  transverse slot 32 can be made on the cover 16.<br>
With this arrangement of the splice box 11, a second introduction of one or more suitably timed blasts of compressed air into the splice box is made, which is open at the lateral outlet edges 12 and 13.<br>
15 This second introduction of compressed air is carried out to help the winding.<br>
Lastly, the thread thus spliced, is released, denoted by reference number 31 in figure 6, and all the members return to their initial position.<br>
20 Therefore, with the described device 10, by using the same splice box 11 which, in itself, helps the winding effect, it action may be changed and used to help mixing, when it is appropriately and mostly closed at its lateral outlet edges 12 and 13, by means of the<br><br>
invention device.<br>
Therefore the device may be used to obtain a double effect, first mixing and then winding, with the described splicing device and process. 5 This solution has been shown to be of considerable efficacy and adaptability, allowing excellent resistance and a splice which is very similar in appearance to the reference yarn and this being so for a  greater  number  of  yarns  compared  to  the  first<br>
10 suggested solutions, giving the user the considerable advantage of not having to replace the splice box for the processing of different yarns.<br>
This operation involves a notable expenditure of time and machine stops,  especially on automatic spoolers<br>
15 which are equipped with a large number of heads (up to 60) and thus splicers.<br>
Moreover, in the case of high torsion yarns or irregular yarns which require a vigorous interweaving (or mixing) action to obtain a sufficiently resistant<br>
20  splice, the splice appearance is considerably improved by  the  subsequent  winding  blast,  making  the  same practically imperceptible in the final fabric. The  solution  described  here  is  also  much  more economical and practical since, it works with just one<br><br>
compressed air duct and one delivery valve of the same, just by changing the operating sequence and using a movable member to close or open the lateral outlet edges of the box. 5 The advantage of just one air duct is increased by the fact that, due to reduced box dimensions, it is difficult to make two distinct ducts to separate the blasts of compressed air. A variation of the splicing process of the invention<br>
10 consists, first of all, in carrying out the preliminary operations already described: the introduction of the thread ends 14 and 15 to be spliced together, into a splice box 11; closing of the upper longitudinal slot 30; clamping and cutting of threads and the opening of<br>
15  the thread ends using compressed air to cause their detwisting and the withdrawal of the thread ends 14 and 15 in the direction of the splice box 11. At this point, compressed air is introduced into the splice box 11, which is partly closed at the lateral<br>
20 outlet edges 12 and 13, by the rods 24 and 25 belonging to the second arm 19.<br>
This introduction of compressed air into the splice box 11 is suitably timed for a sufficient length of time. Still during the first introduction of compressed air,<br><br>
at a certain point, the lateral outlet edges 12 and 13 of the splice box are completely opened by raising the second arm 19, with the aid of the pneumatically operated piston 20. 5 Lastly, the spliced thread is released and all the members return to their initial position. The description makes the device and process characteristics clear for the pneumatic splicing of threads or yarns, which are the subject of the present<br>
10  invention, with its advantages being likewise apparent. Finally, it is clear that numerous variations can be made  to the device  and process  for  the  pneumatic splicing of threads or yarns, subject of the present invention,  without leading away from the innovative<br>
15  principles of the invention.<br>
In the practical implementation of the invention, any materials, forms and dimensions of the details illustrated may be replaced with other technically equivalent ones.<br><br>
