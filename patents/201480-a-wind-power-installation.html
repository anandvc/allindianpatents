Wind power installation<br>
The present invention concerns a wind power installation having a support structure for the stator of a ring generator, wherein the support structure has a plurality of support arms.<br>
Such wind power installations have long been known and are produced and marketed for example by Enercon under the type designations E-40, E-58 or E-56.<br>
Operation of such wind power installations always involves the production of sound emissions which can be perceived to be disturbing, at least in the area relatively closely around the wind power installation.<br>
Therefore the object of the present Invention is to reduce the sound emissions emanating from a wind power installation as set forth in the classifying portion of the claim.<br>
That object is attained  by a wind  power installation  having the features recited in claim 1. Advantageous developments are described in^ the appendant claim.<br>
While in the case of a support structure with an even number of support arms which can develop given frequencies uniformly in the peripheral direction of the ring generator, which are then perceived as sound waves that are experienced as being a disturbance, such sound emissions are entirely suppressed or reduced when the structure involves an odd number of support arms and/or irregular spacing of the support arms.<br>
The invention will be described in greater detail with reference to the drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a simplified view of the state of the art.<br>
Figure 2 shows an alternative configuration of the state of the art,<br>
Figure 3 shows an embodiment of a support structure according to the Invention, and<br><br>
Figure 4 shows an alternative view of the conditions of the embodiment according to the invention as shown in Figure 3.<br>
Figure 1 shows a support structure having six radially extending support arms 12, the outer portions of which are arranged at an equal spacing relative to each other. The stator 10 of a ring generator is fixed to those outer portions. The stator 10 is indicated in the Figure by broken lines.<br>
With this design configuration of a support structure, oscillations 20 can be formed distributed over the periphery between the support arms 12. The uniform spacing between the support arms 12 and the wavelength of the oscillations 20, which respectively coincides therewith, can give rise to an effect which is referred to as the 'drum effect'. What is more crucial in terms of sound emission however are the formation of natural modes (natural forms) which can be produced upon excitation with a given oscillation. Those natural modes are usually dependent on or determined by the geometry of the overall object.<br>
Figure 2 is an alternative view showing the situation in the case of the known support structure. In this Figure, the oscillations 20 are shown in conjunction over the periphery of the support structure with the support arms 12. The oscillations are shown by a dotted line displaced by half a period, and identified by reference numeral 20a.<br>
If any point on the periphery of the support structure (or a molecule of air at that location) is considered, it will be seen that there, depending on the respective phase position of the oscillations 20, 20a, the position thereof alters along a line indicated by the arrow 30. Therefore for that point here there is a bidirectional oscillation, as in the case of an eardrum.<br>
This Figure shows three complete periods of an oscillation, distributed over the periphery of the arrangement, so that three respective in-phase points gre always oscillating with the same magnitude and in the same direction. Those oscillations result in a regular 'pump movement' in the stator of the generator, which is perceived as sound.<br>
Figure 3 shows in simplified form a support structure according to the invention. It has an odd number of support arms 12 (in this case<br><br>
seven). It will be appreciated that the object of the present invention can also be attained with five support arms, preferably at least seven support arms 12 are used for reasons of the required strength of the support structure. In this Figure, the stator 10 of the ring generator is again indicated by broken lines.<br>
Figure 4, similarly to Figure 2, shows a representation of the oscillations which are linked together over the periphery of the support structure. In this case, once again a sequence of oscillation events is identified by reference numeral 20 while reference numeral 20a also represents those oscillation events but displaced by half a period with respect to the oscillations identified by reference numeral 20.<br>
The oscillations identified by reference numeral 20 show three complete oscillation periods in the portions 21, 22 and 23 while only half a period occurs in the portion 24.<br>
By virtue of that oscillation pattern, two positive half-waves (half-periods) are directly mutually adjacent, more specifically at the beginning of the portion 21 and in the portion 24, so that accordingly the drum effect cannot occur at least at that location and is thus at least reduced in its overall effect.<br>
If a mechanical construction such as for example the support structure of a generator produces an unwanted sound emission, that can usually be explained on the basis that, under the action of oscillations, the entire support structure produces so-called resonances or also 'natural modes' (natural forms). Those 'natural modes* are firstly dependent on the geometry of the entire object, in addition there is also a certain frequency dependency of various natural modes.<br>
With the design configuration according to the invention of the support arms of the status, the frequency pattern of that component is such that frequencies at which in particular sound-emitting natural modes (natural forms) could occur are avoided as much as possible.<br><br><br><br><br>
CLAIMS<br>
1.	A wind power installation having a generator, preferably a ring generator, comprising a rotor and a stator which has a mounting means for stator windings, wherein the stator is held by a support structure which has a plurality of support arms and wherein an odd number of support arms (12) are provided and/or the support arms are at least in part irregularly spaced.<br>
2.	A wind power installation according to claim 1 characterised in that the support structure for the stator has seven support arms.<br>
3.	A wind power installation having a generator, preferably a ring generator, comprising a rotor and a stator which has a mounting means for the stator windings, wherein the stator is held by a support structure, wherein the support structure is so designed that it produces substantially no or only slight sound-emitting natural modes (natural forms) in the normal operating range.<br><br>
A wind power installation having a generator substantially as herein described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
