DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
•	First trimester MTP placenta! tissue Lamda phage gt11 cDNA library was<br>
constructed and screened for cDNA of Epap-1 (Fig 1 &amp; 2).<br>
•	Epap-1 cDNA was isolated, cloned and sequenced.<br>
•	Recombinant   Epap-1   was   cloned   and   expressed  in   Bacterial   and<br>
Baculovirus systems (Fig 3 &amp; 4).<br>
•	Recombinant Epap-1 significantly binds to gp120 (Fig 5).<br>
•	The  recombinant  Epap-1   proteins  show significant anti-HIV-1   activity<br>
against HIV-1 Indian Isolate HfV-1931N101 in Sup-T1 (Fig 6).<br>
•	Characterization of Epap 1 action against gp120 mediated viral entry was<br>
studied   using    HL2/3(gp120)   and    SupT-1    (CD4/CxCR4)   cells   by<br>
fluorescence   dye  transfer bioassay.   The results of these experiments<br><br>
showed that the recombinant Epap-1 proteins can block gp120 mediated fusion reaction confirming that recombinant Epap-1 can block HIV-1 viral entry (Fig. 7-9). This was also confirmed by analysis of proviral DNA synthesis in infection conducted in presence of recombinant Epap-1.(Fig. 10)<br>
In summary, we doned, expressed Epap-1 in both Baculovirus and Bacterial systems, the recombinant protein retains antiviral activity as well as exhibits similar molecular mechanism of action.<br>
Sequencing of purified Epap-1.<br>
The N-terminal Seventy amino acids of Epap-1 was sequenced using Shimadzu Automated Sequencer in our University. The Epap-1 sequence was used to design probe for northern detection of Epap-1 encoding mRNA, This probe was used for screening and analysis of cDNA library.<br>
Construction of cDNA library and Screening of cDNA library using both radiolabeKed probe and antibody:<br>
We have constructed MTP placenta! tissue cDNA library using A gt11 phage library construction method. The phage cDNA library was screened with Epap-1 oligo probe (Rg 1). We have obtained four positive dones. The dones were characterized for the presence of insert by PCR using A gt11 primers. The PCR amplified product was a -2.3 Kbp fragment in ail the four dones (Rg 2); the presence of Epap-1 sequence was reconfirmed by southern blot analysis. AM the four clones were screened for expression of recombinant Epap-1 in Y1090, using anti-Epap-1 IgG, thus confirming that the dones are indeed positive for Epap-1 protein expression. Clone 4 was selected for doning and expression of protein. The insert in the clone 4 was PCR amplified using A gt11 primers, the amplified -2.3 Kbp product was thymidylated at the ends; then cloned into TA vector. The<br><br>
TA vector cloned insert was further confirmed by PCR as weU as southern blotting. The confirmed recombinant TA done was sequenced using M13 forward and reverse primers (Fig.2).<br>
Sequencing of insert DNA of positive cDNA done.<br>
Insert positive DNA was sequenced and complete sequence is provided at (Fig. 12). BlastN analysis of the Epap-1 cDNA suggests that it may not be a single gene product.<br>
Cloning and Expression of Eoap-1 in Baculovirus system:<br>
The 5'-end and 3'-end sequence of the insert was analyzed to find its orientation, Based on the orientation, we have doned the insert into a pFAST bac pack HTa vector in right orientation. For control purpose we have used pFAST bac pack HTb and pFAST bac pack HTc vectors also for cloning. Each of the cloned vectors was transformed into DH5 a bacterial cells and the transformed colonies were screened for the insert-containing vector using PCR. The confirmed recombinant DNA was isolated and transformed into DH10 bac cells. The transposition was screened using X-Gal based blue-white selection.<br>
The Bacmid DNA was isolated from the white colonies. The isolated Bacmid DNA-was transfected into SP9 cells using lipofectamine method. The transfected 3F9 cells were scored for the Baculovirus production. The produced Baculovirus was assayed for MOI. The recombinant virus was propagated for 48 hours and used for the production of recombinant Epap-1.<br>
Expression of Epap-1 in Baculovirus<br>
The adhering SF9 cells were infected with recombinant Baculovirus at MOI of<br>
2x107, the suspension  of infected cells at 72 hours was harvested and lysed. The<br><br>
expressed protein was purified from the homogenate using Ni-affinrty chromatography. The purified protein profile is shown in Fig 3, the result show that there is a significant protein expression.<br>
Expression of Epap-1 In bacteria:<br>
We have cloned the insert into a pET 32 HTa vector in right orientation. For control purpose we have used pET 32 HTb and pET 32 HTc vectors also in cloning. DH5 a bacterial celte were transformed by the cloned vectors following by screening for the insert-containing vector using PCR. The confirmed transformed cells were used for expression of recombinant Epap-1 in BL-21 p-lyse bacterial cells The expressed protein was purified from the homogenate using Mi-affinity chromatography. The purified protein profile is shown in Fig. 4, the results show that there is high recombinant Epap-1 expression in bacteria.<br>
Analysis of the In vitro action of the purified recombinant Epap-1 on HIV-1 infection.<br>
The anti-HIV-1  activity of the recombinant was assessed by three screening<br>
methods,<br>
1.	Binding of Epap-1 to HIV-1 gp120<br>
2.	Anti-viral assay in vitro.<br>
3.	Inhibition of HIV-1 gp120 mediated cell-fusion by fluorescent dye-transfer<br>
bioassay<br>
4.	PCR analysis for viral entry.<br>
Screening Method-1<br>
Recombinant baoulovirus and bacterial Epap-1 was screened for its binding to gp160 using an ELISA based assay, the results in Fig,5 show that both the recombinant proteins binds to gp180.<br><br>
Screening Method 2<br>
HIV-1 infection was conducted in presence of increasing concentrations of Epap-1, the results in Fig 6 shows that both Baculovirus and bacterial recombinant proteins exhibit significant anti-HIV-1 activity,<br>
ScreeningMethod3<br>
The action of Native and recombinant proteins on HIV-1 gp120 mediated viral entry was assessed by using a fluorescence dye transfer bioassay. We used 2 dyes calcein AM which shows green fluorescence and Calcein blue which shows a blue fluorescence under our fluorescence microscopic conditions. We used gp120 bearing HL2/3 cells and these cells were loaded with calcein AM cells and the receptors bearing cells used were SUP T1, The SUP T1 cells were loaded with calcein Blue. Figures. 7.8 and 9 shows the time course of fusion reaction at 30 minutes (Fig 7), 60 min (Fig 8), and 120 min (Rg 9). The fusion of the two cells and the transfer of green fluorescent dye follow the progress of the reaction in absence of any inhibitor. While in the presence of an inhibitor, cells will be intact and no fusion and dye transfer takes place Result shown in Fig 7, 8, 9 demonstrate that native, baculowus and bacterial recombinant Epap-1 can completely block HIV-1 gp120 mediated virus entry. We have used CD4 monoclonal SIM4 antibody as positive control in this experiment.<br>
Screening Method 4<br>
The action of Epap-1 in blocking virus entry was further confirmed by analysis of proviral DNA synthesis in an infection conducted in the presence of Epap-1. The cells were challenged with virus in presence of native and recombinant Epap-1. The infected cells were incubated for 5 hours and harvested and proviral DNA was isolated. The isolated proviral DNA was analyzed for the presence of gag regions using gag specific primers SK38 and Sk39 primers through PCR<br>
amplification. The results shown in Fig 10 confirms that Epap-1 can affect proviral DMA synthesis and virus entry.<br>
The results of above screening methods dearly demonstrate that baculovirus and bacterial recombinant Epap-t possesses significant anti-HIV activity through blocking of virus entry. Hence, the recombinant proteins cloned and expressed are anti-HIV-1 active.<br>
Characterization of Molecular action of Native and Recombinant Epap-1.<br>
To monitor the interaction of the Epap-1 against virus surface gp120, the HIV-1 virus was incubated with Epap-1. The HIV-1-Epap-1 complexes were captured onto 3T3CD4 cells, using a cell based assay. The epitopes of gp120 on virus surface that are masked in presence of Epap-1 were monitored using various epitope specific monoclonal antibodies of gp160. The results shown in fig.11 confirm that native, baculovirus and bacterial recombinant Epap-1 can interact with C5 region of gp120 and this interaction is conserved among 4 HIV-1 virus isolates, In summary, these results confirm a conserved mode of molecular action of native, baculovirus and bacterial recombinant Epap-1 proteins.<br>

The appropriate His-Tag vectors were chosen based on the DNA sequence analysis, ORF and orientation, HTa vector and insert DNA in TA Vector was digested with, Sal I and Sac I restriction enzymes for cloning into Baculovirus vector pFast backpack HTa and was digested with Kpn-1 and Sac-1 for cloning into bacterial pET32 HTa vector. The digested DNA was analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The linearized HTa vector and insert DNA was purified by gel extraction. The HTa vector was [{gated with insert DNA and ligation mixture was used to transform DH-5 a cells. The transformed colonies were analyzed by colony cracking followed by PCR analysis with M13 primers. The positive colonies were cultured and the recombinant HTa plasmid with insert DNA was isolated. The recombinant baculovirus vector plasmid was used in transposition of DH10 Bac cells. The bacterial recombinant pET32 vector was used to transform BL21 cells for protein expression.<br>

After washing, 50pl of the goat-anti-mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase (1/1000, 0.75 ug/ml) was added and incubated for 1hr min at 37°C. The plate was washed and 1MB substrate (50 ul) added and incubated at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 50ul of 2N HsSO* The absorbance was read using an ELISA plate reader (Softmax 190, Molecular Devices) at 450 nm.<br>
Epap-1-gp160 binding assay:<br>
Mouse monoclonal anti-human gp160 antibodies spanning different regions of HIV-1 gp160 were added into 96 well RIA plate wells at 10 ng per well in PBS {(C1 reactive (B2-FNMW, 94-97), C2 reactive (B13-TQLLLN, 257-262), C5 reactive 670-30D,, V2 domain reactive 697-30D, V3 Loop reactive (1II-V3-21, SVEINCTRPNNNTRKSI, 298-315), V3 domain reactive (257-DIV), (III-V3-13, IRIQRGPGR, V3 PEPTIDE), V4 domain reactive (B15), CD4 reactive (SIM4)}, the plates were incubated overnight. Following day the wells were blocked with 3% BSA for 2 hours at 37°C, binary complexes containing gp160-Epap-1 were formed by incubation of gp160 in PBS with increasing concentrations of Epap-1 at 37°C for 1 hour. Binary complexes were captured with gp160 monoclonal antibody pre-coated wetts (as above) and incubated for 1 hour at 37'C. The unbound complexes were removed by washing thrice with wash buffer. Captured binary complexes were probed for the Epap-1 using 10 ng of affinity purified Rabbit polyclonal anti-human Epap-1 antibody by incubating for 1 hour at 37°C and wells were washed thrice with wash buffer. Bound rabbit polyclonal was probed with 1:2000 dilution of Goat anti-rabbit IgG-peroxidase antibody by incubating at 37°C for 30 minutes, the wells were washed thrice with wash buffer and developed with TMB substrate system. The reaction was stopped after 30<br>
min with 1N HC1 and plates were read at 450 nM, Each experiment was done in triplicates and average and standard deviations were calculated.<br>
HIV-1 ENTRY INHIBITION ANALYSED BY PROV1RAL DNA AMPLIFICATION BY PCR:<br>
Analysis of Proviral DNA<br>
QupT1 celte (0.4x106) were challenged with HIV-193^101 (100pg) in presence of increasing concentrations of drugs (1nM, 1GnM, 1QOnM, 1uM, 10uM) at 5% CO2 and 37aC, The cells were harvested after 5 hr.p.i and washed with phosphate-buffered eaWne. The celte were iysed with 50 u! lysis buffer containing 10x Solution A (1M KC1; 100mM Tris-HC1 (pH8.3); 2.5 mM MgC12), 10x Solution B (ICCrnM Tris-^Ct {pH 3.3), 2.5rr?M MgCt2,0.45% Tween 20, 045% Nonidet P 40), 50mM NaC1. The cell lysates were treated with RNasel (10pg/ml) and incubated at 37"C for 30 minutes. Proteinase K (60ug/ml) was added to the lysates and done each one cyde of PCR (Robocycfer 96 from Stratagene, USA) at 56°C for activation and 95°C for inactivatjon of Proteinase K. The lysates were stored at -20°C until used for PCR (Secondo Sonza etal, 1996).<br>
PCR analysis of provlral DNA<br>
The cell {ysates were added to the 50u! of reaction mixture comprising of 10x PCR buffer, 0.2mM of each deoxynudeoside triphosphate (dNTPs), 2.5mM MgC12; 0.40uM SK38, SK39 sense and anti-sense primers (supplied by Integrated DNA Technologies, USA) and 0.5 U of Taq DNA Polymerase (Biogene, USA) (Saiki et al, 1988). The matures were heated to 94*C for denaturation for 2 minutes and then subjected to annealing for 30 cycles of PCR (1 minute, 1 minute and 1,30 minutes for each step of 94°C, 603C, and 72°C respectively). After a final extension at 72*C for 10 minutes. The same samples were amplified with p-actin, which served as an internal control (Kwan et.a;,<br>
