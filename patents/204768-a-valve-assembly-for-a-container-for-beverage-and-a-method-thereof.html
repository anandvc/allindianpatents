COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10]<br><br><br><br>
     A VALVE ASSEMBLY FRO A CONTAINER FOR BEVERAGE AND A METHOD<br><br>
     THEREOF.<br><br><br><br>
HEINEKEN    TECHNICAL    SERVICES    B.V.,    a    Dutch    company    of    2e Weteringplantsoen 21, 1017 ZD Amsterdam, The Netherlands,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention<br>
and the manner in which it is to be performed :-	<br><br>
The invention relates to a valve assembly for a container for beverage,   in particular carbonated beverage such as beer,   of  the type described in the preamble of temperature main claim.   Such a valve assembly is known from European patent  application  0.389.191.<br>
This known valve assembly comprises a housing with a beverage channel,   accommodating a valve body which,   in a first position,   provides a  complete closure of the beverage channel.   By means of a quick-closing means,   a feed line or a discharge line  for beverage  can be connected to the housing. In this known valve assembly,   during the  filling of a container as well  as during  the delivery of beverage therefrom,   the same passage  of the beverage channel  is in each case released.  This passage is relatively small,   so that filling of the beverage container can only be effected relatively slowly.   In this known valve assembly,   increasing the passage has as a consequence that  during the delivery of the beverage,   an unduly great flow rate  is obtained,  which adversely affects the beverage delivery and the control thereof.   Moreover,   this known valve assembly has  a relatively great end-to-end dimension,   which is disadvantageous in respect of,   for  instance,   the storing of  a container provided therewith,   the required shelf  space and  the vulnerability of such valve assembly-  Moreover,   this known assembly has as a drawback that two valve bodies move opposite  to each other, which is  complicated,   costly and susceptible to failure.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a valve assembly of the  type described in the preamble,  wherein at least  the drawbacks mentioned are avoided,   while the advantages thereof are maintained.   To that end,   a valve assembly according to the  invention is  characterized by the features of claim 1.<br><br><br>
In a valve assembly according to the present invention, two different coupling means for coupling the beverage channel of the valve assembly to beverage dispensing means for emptying a container, respectively for coupling the beverage channel to a filling device for filling the container, are employed in a surprising manner. Both the filling and emptying operations of the container can take place thrpugh or along the valve body. Unlike the known valve assembly, the dimensioning and design of the relevant coupling means can thus in each case be optimally provided, while substantially the same valve housing and valve body can be used, for instance fixedly connected to an inner container. The second coupling means can for instance enable a greater flow rate, at least filling the container at relatively high speed and/or pressure without involving excess foaming or adversely affecting the beverage and/or the container otherwise. The first coupling means, suitable for emptying the container, can be designed with, for instance, a relatively small passage for dispensing the beverage in a relatively slow and controlled manner. Moreover, for instance the first coupling means can be designed to enable operation of the valve body with a relatively great stroke, while the first coupling means can for instance permit a relatively small stroke, so that they can be constructed with a relatively small end-to-end dimension. This is important in particular for the first coupling means, because in principle only these first coupling means will be presented, with a container, to an end user. On the other hand, the second coupling means will in principle only be used in a brewery, bottling plant or the like. A further advantage of using first and second coupling means is that the first coupling means do not have to be fitted until the associated container has been filled, so that the sealing and/or tamper-sealing thereof is possible in a particularly simple manner, which is of importance for guaranteeing the quality of the contents of the container in question.<br><br><br>
 	In a first  advantageous embodiment,   a valve assembly<br>
according to the  invention is  further characterized by the features of  claim 3.<br>
Such embodiment has the advantage  that when the valve body is in its  third position,   a relatively great  flow of beverage   can pass  the valve body per unit of time,   for filling the beverage container relatively quickly,   without involving excess  foaming.   This means  that  the filling of the beverage container requires  relatively  little time,   without particularly complicated measures having to be taken therefor.   Moreover,   this prevents the quality of  the beverage from being adversely affected during filling,  while a relatively high  filling pressure can be  applied.   Because wher the valve assembly is in the  second position,   only a relatively small  passage is  released for dispensing the beverage,   the advantage thus  achieved is  that accurate control of  the  desired flow rate is possible,   again without involving excess  foaming and without  requiring any complicated measures.<br>
In further elaboration,   a device  according to the invention is  further characterized by the features  of claim 5.<br>
In such embodiment,   a  fully closed first position of the valve body,   a partially open second position and a fully open third position thereof  are defined as discrete steps,   as a result of which such valve assembly can be used in an even simpler manner.<br>
In a  further advantageous embodiment,   a valve assembly according to the  invention is  further characterized by the features of  claim 6,   in particular of  claims 6 and 7. The advantage achieved by providing an at  least partially hollow valve body,   wherein,   in a sidewall,   at least one  opening  is provided for  forming,   in  at  least  a  second and third position of  the valve  body,   an open fluid connection between a container in which the valve  assembly is used and a part of the beverage channel  remote  from the relevant<br><br>
 container, is that the valve body can be of a particularly simple construction, while the passage in the first and second position is readily defined by the total surface area of the clear portion of the or each opening in the sidewall. In a first position, the beverage channel is closed off by at least the end face, such that beverage from the relevant container cannot reach the or each opening in question. The advantage • that is moreover achieved hereby is that the outflow direction of the beverage, at least during the feed of the beverage into the container, encloses an angle with the longitudinal axis of the valve body, to obtain a favorable distribution of the beverage, while the beverage is prevented from being fed directly and at full pressure from the filling opening into the beverage that is already present in the container, thus further preventing the foaming thereof. This also provides the advantage that when the beverage is being removed from the container, the feed of beverage from the container to the beverage channel and formed through the or each relevant opening is prevented from possibly being covered by, for instance, a flexible wall of the container. Moreover, a further advantage is that during use, the flow-through opening of the beverage channel itself in each case remains almost completely free, or at least that when the valve assembly is open, the passage thereof is hardly limited by the presence of the valve body, which prevents the flow of beverage from being adversely affected during the filling and emptying of the container. Further, the filling pressure will support the opening of the valve body.<br>
The use of the end face of the valve body for closing in a first position against a longitudinal edge of the beverage channel effects a proper seal in a simple manner, which seal is further improved by the occurrence of a slightly higher pressure in the container.<br>
In a further embodiment, a valve assembly according to the invention is characterized by the features of claim 9.<br><br><br>
Coupling the operating means to the valve body enables a simple operation thereof.   The stop means provide  that when the  first and second coupling means are used,   the  stroke of the valve body is  in each case unequivocally defined. Moreover,   by providing that  the coupling means can only be detached from the valve body when the valve body is  in the first position,   beverage is prevented from escaping from the container, unintentionally in the absence of the coupling means.   Indeed,   an open position can only be adopted by the valve body when the coupling means have been removed.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment,   the valve body is biased in a closed position.<br>
In a further embodiment,   a valve assembly according to the  invention is  further characterized by the features of claim 13.<br>
Accommodating spring means  in a  chamber between the valve body and the housing offers the  advantage that  thus, the  spring means are readily protected and can readily be formed,  while they are moreover always  located outside the flow of beverage.   This simply prevents  mutual  influencing of the  quality of  the beverage and the spring means.   Biasing the valve body in a first,   closed position offers the  advantage that  beverage cannot flow from the container until   the valve body  is actively operated into an open position.<br>
In further elaboration,   a valve  assembly according to the  invention is  further characterized by the features of claim 14.<br>
The advantage achieved by the use  of  fluid spring means,   in particular an air spring,   is  that  the valve assembly can be of  a particularly simple  and inexpensive design,   while spring means of  a suitable  spring characteristic are obtained.   Moreover,   such spring means have the  advantage that  the quality of the beverage cannot be affected thereby in any manner whatsoever,   not  even when the beverage contacted the spring means.   Moreover,   recycling of a<br><br><br>
Walve assembly according to  the invention is further simplified hereby.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment,   a valve assembly according to the  invention is characterized by the  features of  claim 16.<br>
Fixing the valve body in the closed position offers the  advantage that  transport  and storage of a container provided therewith are thus  further simplified and the preservation of  the quality  is ensured thereby.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment,   a valve assembly according to the  invention  is  characterized by the  features of  claim 18.<br>
The advantage achieved with such embodiment   is that the pressure body is movable  in two directions,   such that it can act  as pressure release valve  for  the inner  space of the container.  After  all,   in the  case of unduly high pressure in the  inner space of  the container,   the valve body will be pressed towards the at least partially open position, allowing at least gas to escape  from the  inner space for reducing the pressure therein.<br>
The invention further relates  to a valve assembly for a container for beverage,   characterized by the  features of claim 19.<br>
In such embodiment,   a valve assembly of a particularly simple construction and an effective pattern of passage is obtained.<br>
The  invention further relates  to  a container for beverage,   in particular a  carbonated beverage such as beer, provided with a valve assembly according to the   invention.<br>
In a particularly advantageous  embodiment,   a  container according to the  invention  is  characterized by the  features of claim 21.<br>
The use of  an outer container and,   included therein,   a relatively flexible inner container in which the beverage can be stored,   offers the advantage that  the  inner container can be pressed empty in a relatively simple manner by introducing<br><br><br>
 a pressure medium between the inner container and the outer container. Accordingly, the inner container is protected relatively effectively by the outer container. In this manner, the inner container can be emptied relatively easily, while the container can moreover readily be filled by means of the valve assembly with the second coupling means. Through the provision of means for feeding said pressure medium into the space-between the inner container and the outer container, which feed means are closed when the valve body is in a first position and are open when the valve body is in an open second or third position, it is readily effected that the pressure in said space is maintained at the proper level when no beverage is fed into the container or discharged therefrom. After all, in those cases, the valve body is in its first position, in which the beverage channel is closed.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment, a container according to the invention is further characterized by the features of claim 23.<br>
Through the use of first sealing means on the first and second coupling means and second sealing means on the housing, which first and second sealing means, when the valve body is in any open position, cooperate for a fluid-tight connection' between the first or second coupling means and the air channel, separated from the path to be traveled by the beverage, a passage for the air, at least the pressure medium, is readily obtained without this air contacting the beverage.<br>
The invention further relates to a method for using a container according to the invention, characterized by the features of claim 25.<br>
Such a method offers the advantage that a container according to the invention can be assembled and filled in a particularly simple manner, while moreover, the advantage can be achieved that after filling, closure of the container is directly effected.<br><br><br>
A method according to the invention is further preferably characterized by the features of claim 26. The advantage achieved by removing a used inner container together with a part of the valve assembly connected thereto,  prior to the placing of an inner container,   is  that the outer container can be used again, while the inner container together with the relevant part of the valve assembly can be reused.  This may possibly be the entire valve assembly,  yet preferably without second coupling means.<br>
Further advantageous  embodiments of a valve  assembly, a beverage container,   and method and combinations  thereof are given in the  subclaims.<br>

In this specification, a first position of the valve body is understood to mean a closed position, a second position is understood to mean a partially open position for dispensing beverage from the container, and a third position is understood to mean an open position for filling the container. In the third position, the valve assembly is preferably further open than in the second position, so that the valve assembly has a greater flow rate.<br>
A container 1 according to the invention comprises a substantially rigid outer container, for instance blown from PET or PEN, or PET having a barrier against the passage of gas, such as EVOH, scavenger or the like, and a relatively flexible, for instance sack-shaped inner container 4, for instance produced from polyethene. Of course, other plastics or metals are also suitable as material for the container. The inner container may also be manufactured from a different material having proper barrier properties. In Fig. 1, on the right-hand side of the center C, the inner container 4 is shown in filled condition, abutting against the inside of the outer container 2. On the left-hand side, the inner container 4 is shown in empty condition, in which the inside volume of the inner container is nil. In this condition, the inner container 4 can be introduced into or removed from the outer container 2 via the neck 28 of the outer container 2. Adjacent the top end 6, the inner container 4 is attached to a valve assembly 8, in a manner to be described in more detail hereinbelow. Adjacent the bottom end 10, the outer container 2 is provided with a standing collar 12, on which the container 1 can be disposed. Provided at the top side is a second collar 14 which surrounds and protects the valve assembly 8, the collar moreover being provided with handgrips 16 for enabling the container 1 to be picked up and handled in a simple manner. The collars 12, 14 are for instance produced from plastic, cardboard or metal. The outer container may also be produced from metal, for that matter.<br><br><br>
  A valve assembly according to Fig.   2 comprises a valve<br>
housing 18 arid a valve body 20.   The valve housing 18 comprises a top face 22 with a depending circumferential wall having a clamping ridge 26  whereby the valve housing 18 can be  fixed on the neck 28,   below a second clamping  ridge 30. Provided in the  top face 22   is a central  opening 32. Extending concentrically around the opening 32,   in upward direction,,  is a  first guide  neck 34,   while a second guide neck 36 extends  concentrically in opposite direction.  The second guide neck 36 has its bottom side provided with an inwardly directed clamping edge 38.   Prom the bottom side and within the second guide neck 36,   a lower housing part 40 is retained behind the clamping edge 38  by a  cylindrical wall  42 forming the outer wall of  a  chamber 44.   Provided at  the bottom side of the cylindrical  wall  42   is  a  somewhat diamond-shaped spacer part 46 having a central  bore 48.   The valve body 20  is substantially cylindrical,   provided with a central passage 50,   and has its bottom end closed off by an end face 52.   Provided in the circumferential wall   54,   directly above the end wall  52,   are two openings 56  connecting the central passage 50 to the outside of  the valve body 20 and to the inner space 51  of  the inner  container 4,   when the valve body 20  is open,   i.e.   when the valve body 20   is  in its  second or third position.   Fig.   2 shows  the valve body 22  in the first position.   The end  face 52   is  circumferentially provided with an outwardly extending lip  58 which,   when the valve body 20 is in its first position,   seals against  the circumferential edge  60 of  a downwardly extending collar part  62  of the lower housing part 40.   This effects  a closure  of  the central bore 48  through the valve body 20  and,   accordingly,   between the openings  56 and the  inner space of  the   inner container 4.<br>
The inner container 4   is connected to the lower housing part 40  above the  spacer part  46,   against  the cylindrical wall  42,   at least  against  the transition between the cylindrical wall part  42  and the spacer means  46.  The inner container 4   is connected to the valve housing 18,  at<br><br>
least the lower housing part 40 thereof, by sealing, while the relatively large distance between the seal connection and the collar part 62 ensures that deformation of the circumferential edge 60 and, consequently, an adverse effect on the sealing of the lip 48 thereagainst, is readily prevented.<br>
The valve body 20 has its upper end 64, remote from the end face 52, provided with and outwardly extending flange 66 having a surface 68 extending in upward direction. Provided on the outside of the surface 68 is a second circumferentially extending lip 70, abutting with a proper fit against the inside of the cylindrical wall 42. The chamber 42 has a cylindrical shape and is enclosed between the cylindrical wall 42, the flange 66, the sidewall 44 of the valve body 20 and the transition 4 7 between the spacer part 46 and the cylindrical wall 42. Arranged in the chamber 44, at the top and at the bottom thereof, is a packing, for instance a plastic or rubber O-ring 72, sealing the chamber 42 gas-tightly. During a downward movement of the valve body 20, in the direction P, for instance into the third position shown in Fig. 3, the volume of the chamber 44 is reduced, while the air contained therein cannot escape and is therefore compressed. As a result, a closing force will be exerted on the valve body 20 in the direction opposite to P, which closing force urges the valve body 20 in the direction of the closed first position that is shown in Fig. 2. If necessary, in addition to or instead of the air spring means shown in Fig. 2, another spring means may be incorporated into the chamber 44, for instance a helical spring, or another fluid.<br>
Between the cylindrical wall 42 and the second guide neck 36, some space is kept clear, forming a first part 74 of an air path 76. In the first position shown in Fig. 2, the top end of the surface 8 abuts against the bottom side of the circumference of the central opening 32. As a result, the air path 74 adjacent the opening 32 is closed off. Accordingly,<br><br><br>
 in this position of the valve body 20, air cannot flow away from or to the space 78 between the inner container 4 and the outer container 2.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a second coupling part 80, coupled to the top end 64 of the valve body 20 by means of a frustoconical bottom end 82. This frustoconical bottom end forms a fluid-tight seal against the inside of the valve body 20. The second coupling part 80 has a central passage 84, which fittingly and fluid-tightly connects to the central passage 50 of the valve body 20 and has a section that is identical to or preferably slightly greater than the section of the passage 50 in the valve body 20. The central passage 84 in the second coupling part 80 is surrounded by a concentrically located second part 86 of the air channel 76, ending at a distance above the bottom end 82 of the central passage 84. Provided around the central opening 32 is a raised lip 88, adapted to abut against the bottom side of the outer wall 90 of the second air channel part 86 and to seal it when the second coupling part 80, coupled to the valve body, has been pressed down maximally in the direction P as shown in Fig. 3. Between the wall 92 of the central passage 84 and the central opening 32, some space is left clear, through which, when the second coupling part is in the second position shown in Fig. 3, air can flow from the second air channel part 86 through the central opening 32 to the first air channel part 74 and from there into the interspace 78, or can be removed therefrom, while the air channel 76 is closed towards the environment by the cooperating wall 90 and the raised lip 88. The second coupling part 80 is guided by the outside of the wall 90 within the guide neck 34, for unequivocal movement thereof. If the second coupling part 80 is withdrawn from the third position shown in Fig. 3, the bottom end of the wall 90 is pulled loose from the lip 88 and the air channel 76 is brought into open communication with the environment through an opening 94 in the guide neck 34, so that no air can<br><br>
further be introduced into the container or discharged therefrom.<br>
As appears  from a comparison between Figs.   2  and 3, the  second coupling part  80  can make a  relatively great stroke S, between the first  position and  the third position. In the third position,   as shown in Fig.   3,   the openings 56 are  completely free under the  lower collar part  62 .   Via a beverage feed channel,, partially provided by the  central passage 84  in the coupling part  80 and the beverage channel part  50 in the valve body 20,   beverage  can be forced through the opening 56  into the inner space of   the inner container 4, as  shown schematically in Fig.   10.  At  the  same time,   via the air channel   76,   air can be  discharged  from the space 78 between the inner container 4  and the  outer container 2,   to provide sufficient  space  for  the beverage.   Preferably,   some excess pressure  is maintained in the  space  78 during filling, to obtain a better filling of  the container,  without the formation of  foam.   Due to the  complete  opening of   the openings 56,   beverage can rapidly be  introduced into the container at  a relatively great  flow rate  and under relatively high pressure,   without  the  beverage being adversely affected thereby.   The beverage   flows from the openings 56  substantially radially,   for   instance  against the wall  of the  inner container 4,   so that   an even better filling is obtained.   The  spacer part  46 ensures   that the  wall of  the inner container 4  will not  abut against   the openings 56.<br>
After the  inner container 4 has  been completely filled with beverage,   the second coupling part   8 0  is pulled away upwards,   or at  least  the pressing force   is  removed  therefrom, such that the valve body 20  is  forced  into the first position by the spring means  4 5 formed  in the  chamber 44  and the valve body 20 closes off  the central  bore 48   liquid-tightly.  The second coupling part  80 can  then be removed from the valve body 20 and the housing 18  and can be  discharged or reused for filling a next container.<br><br><br>
Fig.   4  is  a sectional view of a valve assembly according to the  invention,   of which the valve housing 18 and the valve body 20  are identical  to the embodiment  according to Figs.   1-3.  However,   the second coupling means  80 has been replaced by a first coupling means  100,   suitable  for dispensing beverage from the  inner container 4.   The  second coupling means  100 comprises  a  first  circumferential wall 102,   which- can be  fittingly received with guidance within the guide neck 34.  Adjacent the bottom end,   the circumferential wall  102  is provided with a slightly beveled inner edge 104, which can be fittingly and sealingly received between the guide neck 34  and the lip 88.   The upper longitudinal edge 106 of  the first  coupling means  100  diverges  slightly conically outwards and comprises an abutment  face  for coupling to a feed hose of a pressure source   (not  shown)   for introducing a pressure medium,   in particular air under pressure within the circumferential  wall  102.<br>
The  first  coupling means  100  is  further provided with a knee-shaped channel part  108  comprising a first  leg 110 which is cylindrical and extends concentrically relative to the  first  circumferential wall   102  and  is partially included therein,   while a second leg  112  is provided,   extending approximately horizontally from the end of the first leg 110 which end points  upwards during use,   through the  first circumferential  wall  102  and  slightly projecting  therefrom. Coupled to the part 114 of  the  second leg which part projects from the circumferential  wall   102  is  a  flexible hose 116 through which beverage can be  dispensed from the  container, or can at   least  be directed  to  a  tapping  device  such as  a draw-off  tap   (not  shown) .   Preferably,   the hose  is   fixedly connected to and  in particular of one-piece construction with the second leg  112.<br>
The end of  the first  leg  110  remote  from the  second leg  112 has an outer cross  section which is slightly smaller than the  inner section of  the  channel  part  50  in the valve body 20,   and comprises an annular edge  118 which extends<br><br><br>
Rightly flexibly outwards and can sealingly abut against the inside of the wall 54 of the valve body 20. Thus, a fluid-tight connection can be obtained between the central bore 50 of the valve body 20 and the beverage dispensing channel part 120 in the knee-shaped channel part 108. Moreover, this beverage dispensing channel 50, 120 is sealed relative to the inner space within the second circumferential wall 102, so that air introduced therein under pressure cannot flow into the beverage dispensing channel 50, 120.<br>
The first leg 110 has its outside provided with an outwardly extending rib that ends at some distance from the free longitudinal edge 118 and can abut against the flange 66 of the valve body 20 for the movement thereof.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the valve body 20 in the closed first position, in which the first coupling means 100 has been moved into an upper position. The height of the first coupling means 100 above the top face 22 of the valve housing 18 is relatively low compared with the height of the second coupling means 80 above said top face 22 when the valve body 20 is in the first position. The second leg 112 lies with its bottom side at the level of the top edge of the guide neck 34. The opening 94 in the guide neck 34 is open towards the top and hence slot-shaped, with a width approximately corresponding to the width of the second leg 112. This means that the first coupling means 100 can only be moved down when the second leg 112 has been moved above the opening 94. Subsequently, the first coupling means 100 can be pressed down from the position shown in Fig. 4, into the second position shown in Fig. 5. The maximum stroke S2 is bounded by the bottom edge 104 of the second coupling means and the stop face 122 enclosed between the lip 88 and the guide neck 34. This stroke S2 is considerably less than the maximum stroke Sx of the second coupling means 80. Moreover, by this maximum stroke S2, the maximum passage O of the openings 56 is defined, viz. between the end wall 52 of the valve body 20 and the bottom side of the circumferential edge 60 of the<br><br>
lower housing part 40. The total passage area 0 of the openings thus created is smaller than the area of the openings 56,   and hence smaller than the passage area when the valve body is  in its third position.<br>
As the valve body 20  is pressed down when the  first coupling means  is  in the second position shown in Fig.   5,   the air  channel  76  is again released,   through which,   as  shown in Fig.   11,   compressed air introduced within the circumferential wall   102 can be passed via the air channel  76 into the space 78  between the  inner container 4 and the outer container 2, for  the compression thereof.   Beverage can be forced from the inner container 4  and via  the passages of the openings 56 into  the beverage dispensing channel   50,   120,   and be discharged via  the hose 116.   If the  first  coupling means  100 is  moved up again,   for instance under the  influence of the spring means 45,   the valve body 20  is returned into the  first position and the air channel  76 is closed again,   so that the pressure built up in the space 78  is at  least substantially retained,   while  the possible  flow, of  air into or beverage out of  the  inner container is prevented.   The  spacer means 46 offer the advantage that  the  flexible  inner container 4 cannot come to abut against  the openings  56,   so that the passage always  remains clear when the valve body is  in the second or third position.<br>
By way of  illustration,   the maximum stroke  S2  of the first  coupling means and hence the movement of the valve body between the first  and the  second position is,   for  instance, 3-4   mm,   while  the maximum stroke S2 of  the second coupling means  and hence  the maximum movement  of  the valve body between the first  and the  third position  is,   for  instance, about  12 mm.  Of  course,   these values  and ratios  should not be construed as being limitative,   but  should only be  regarded as examples.<br>
As appears  from Figs,   la and 2a,   the channel part  86 extends all around the wall   92,   while narrow ribs are provided for connecting the wall parts  90  and 92.<br><br><br>
Figs.   6 and 7 show alternative exemplary embodiments of a valve assembly according to the  invention,   which mainly differ from the embodiment according to Figs.   1-5   in that on, or at  least adjacent the lower housing part 40,   a  dish-shaped part   124,   forming a spacer dish,   is provided which extends beyond the spacer part 46 and preferably closes off  the neck 28  on the inside  substantially.   The  section D2 of   the spacer dish  124  is preferably slightly greater than the  inner section D2 of the neck 28,   such that when the valve  assembly 8 is  fitted,   the spacer dish 124  is confined in or below the neck 28.   During  fitting of  the valve  assembly 8  and the inner container 4  connected therewith,   which is  inserted  through the  neck 28,   the  longitudinal  edge  126  of  the  spacer dish 124 will  be elastically displaced slightly inwards and rebound after the neck 28  has been passed.   The  spacer dish  124 offers the  advantage that during emptying,   the  inner container 4  is prevented from moving in the neck 28,   at  least  around the spacer part 46  and the valve housing -18.   Hence,   the  advantage thus  achieved is  that the rest volume of  the inner container 4  is  nil while,   moreover,   a proper operation of  the valve assembly 8  is ensured.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig.   7,   the dish  124  is manufactured separately and  fitted on the  lower housing part 40,   while partially overlapping and surrounding  the  spacer part   46.   In the embodiment  shown in Figs.   6  and  8,   the spacer dish  124  is integrated with the lower housing part  40 and extends entirely above the  spacer part  46.   This  is advantageous in terms of production and convenient   in use.<br>
As appears  from Fig.   8,   the cylindrical wall   42  is provided,   adjacent  the spacer dish 124,   with a number of spaced apart rib parts 128,   which provide  for the preservation of  the channel  part  74.   Further,   on  the upper longitudinal edge of  the cylindrical  wall  42,   a number of spaced apart crenels  130 are provided,   for  increasing the air passage to the channel part   74  when the valve body 20 is open.   This prevents unintentional  closure of  the  air channel<br><br>
76 when the valve body is in its second or third position.   In this embodiment,   the inner container 4   can be secured directly against  the spacer dish 124  and/or the  spacer part       46,   preferably through sealing.<br>
 	Fig.   9a shows a first  alternative  embodiment  of the<br>
spring means 145.   Here,  a helical  spring  147 is accommodated in the chamber 144,   which helical  spring,   during movement  of the valve body 20  relative to the cylindrical wall  42,   is compressed in the opening direction P.   Such spring  147 is       preferably manufactured from plastic which can be  recycled together with the  further valve assembly and,  possibly,   the inner container 4 .   Fig.  9b shows a further alternative embodiment of  the  spring means 245,   where,   in the  chamber 244,   a number of  slightly helically extending spring lips  247 are provided whose top ends are connected to the  bottom side of  the  flange 266  and whose bottom ends  abut against  the bottom of the chamber 244.   When the valve body 20   is pressed down in the direction P,   the  lips 247  will  deform elastically and exert on the valve body 20 a force  acting in opposite direction,  when the valve body 20 is released,   it will therefore be pressed back into the closed  first position.<br>
Figs.   12  and 13 show a  further alternative  embodiment of  a portion of  a valve assembly 8 according to the invention,   applicable to the different   exemplary embodiments shown.   In this embodiment,   the valve body 20 has  its  inside provided,   adjacent  the top end,   with two annular grooves  53, 55.   The upper groove 53 is provided in  the  f rustoconical inner face of  the  surface  68,   while the  second,   lower groove 55  is provided adjacent the  top end of   the circumferential wall   54  of the valve body 20.   Adjacent   the bottom end of  the circumferential  wall  102,   the  first  coupling part   100 (Fig.   13)   is provided with an annular ridge 57 on  the outside,   capable  of engaging the lower  annular groove 55  for coupling the  first  coupling part  100  to  the valve  body 20.   If necessary,   one or more thin portions  59  or like deformable portions may be provided in the circumferential wall  102,   for<br><br><br>
elastic deformation thereof  so as to simplify the  coupling of the  ridge 57  to the groove  55.   When the   first coupling part 100  is pressed down,   this will  slightly slide into the central bore 50 of the valve body 20,   until the ridge 57 engages the groove  55.  Thus,   the  first   coupling means  100  is positively coupled to the valve body 20,   in such a manner that  the valve body 20 can be moved both up and down with the first  coupling part  100.   For detaching  the  first  coupling part  100  from the valve body 20,   the  coupling part   100 will have  to be pulled away upwards,   and the  valve body 20 will first be moved into the first,   closed position before the first  coupling means 100  is  released  from the valve body 20. Preferably,   the valve body 20   is provided,   adjacent   its upper longitudinal  edge 21,   with an outwardly extending  annular ridge  23  capable of  engaging  a groove  25   in the cylindrical wall  42 or above the upper longitudinal   edge of  this cylindrical wall  42.   The ridge  23  and groove 25 are positioned so that  they engage each other when the  valve body 20  is  in its closed position.   Thus,   it   is readily effected that  the valve body 20 will   in each case be brought  into the closed position before the coupling means  100 can be removed from the valve body 20.<br>
Fig.   12  shows  the bottom end of   the second  coupling means  80,   provided with an annular ridge  61  that   can be fittingly received in the upper groove  53  in the valve body 20.   Thus,   a positive coupling of  the  second coupling means 80 to the valve body 20  is obtained,   again  in such a manner that the valve body 2 0  can be moved both up  and down with the second  coupling means  80.<br>
The effect  achieved by causing  the  force for positively coupling the first   100 or  second coupling means  80 to the valve body 20 to be less than is  necessary  for uncoupling the ridge 23 and  the groove  25,   is that   in each case,   the relevant  coupling means  80,   100  is coupled to the valve body 20 before the valve body 20   can be moved. Moreover,   the advantage achieved by the  ridge 23   and the<br><br><br>
  foove 25  is that  the surface  68 of the valve body 20 will, in the second and third positions,  be slightly deformed inwards,   thereby further clamping the relevant coupling means 80,   100.   In such embodiment,   spring means may optionally be        dispensed with.<br>
Figs.   10  and 11 show the  flow directions and flow paths  for the beverage,   in particular beer,   and the pressure medium,   in particular air,   for filling and emptying  the container respectively.  A valve assembly according  to the       present  invention offers the  advantage  that  the  flow paths for the beverage  and the pressure medium are accommodated in one valve assembly,   at least within one housing,   and are entirely separated from each other,   which enables  a particularly simple connection and a simple construction of a valve  assembly.<br>
A container according to the present  invention is preferably placed within a holder   (Fig.   14)   by an end user. By closing the cover of the  relevant holder,   a connection for compressed air is connected to the top side of the  first coupling means  100,   while,   moreover,   by closing the  cover, the  first  coupling means  100  is pressed down along  the path S2.   Before the cover is closed,   the end of  the hose  116 can then be taken out  of the relevant holder or be connected in or to a draw-off  tap or the  like that  is  for instance arranged on the  holder.   Such holder preferably comprises means  for automatically bringing the space 78 between the inner container and the outer container 2  to a desired pressure and for keeping that  pressure.   Such a holder enables a container according to the present invention to be used in an even simpler manner.   However,   it  is  of  course  also possible  to connect  a container according to the present invention to a pressure source and/or a beverage dispensing device  in another manner,   for instance  in a tapping device known per se as  employed in bars,   hotels,   restaurants,   etc.<br>
Fig.   15  is  a  sectional   side elevation of a valve assembly 308  comprising a  valve  housing  318  having  a<br><br><br>
Substantially cylindrical  section,   comprising an inwardly projecting counterf ace 373  with a central opening.   At the bottom side,   the valve housing 318  is  closed by valve foot having a central  bore 350A,   which valve  foot is  secured thereon by,   for  instance,   spinwelding,   welding,   gluing or the like.  A likewise  substantially cylindrical pressure body 321 extends  from the  side facing the valve  foot 319  through the opening  in the  counterface  3 73,   such that a shoulder 357 can sealingly abut  against said  counterface  373.  By a   first end 320A,   a valve body 320 extends  in the central bore  350A, while an O-ring  372 or another appropriate seal   is provided for gas-tight  and liquid-tight  sealing  against the valve  foot 319.   Further,   at  some distance  from said  first end  320A,   the valve body 320   is provided with a radially extending flange 323,   which  can  receive support   from the  valve foot   319.   From the  flange 323,   a tubular part  371 of  the valve body 320 extends  into a  cylindrical part 333 of  the pressure body 321, while  two O-rings  372 or other appropriate seals  are secured on  the tubular part 371 of  the valve body 320,   at   a distance from each other,   which O-rings  can seal  gas-tightly and liquid-tightly against the  inside of the  cylindrical part 333.   Between these two O-rings  372,   four radial  openings 356 are provided  in  the tubular part 371.   The tubular part 371  of the valve body 32 0  is closed at the top end 320B by an end face  352.   Between the pressure body 321  and the radial  flange 323  of the valve body 320,   a  spring 347   is accommodated, which presses  the pressure body 321  and  the valve  body 320 apart,   such  that   the  shoulder  357  closes   against   the counterface  373,   while  the  end  face  352   is  located   in a transition face  353  of the pressure body 321.   Provided in the valve  housing  318,   adjacent   the valve   foot  319,   are  gas passage openings  331,   whose purpose will  be further discussed hereinbelow.   From the valve  foot  319,   a  further tubular body 375  extends  in  the direction away from the valve body 320,   in which tubular body a diptube  359 is secured.  Between the<br><br><br>
 valve foot 319 and the diptube 359, further openings 355 are provided.<br>
Adjacent the top end, the valve housing 318 comprises a ring 361 of segments 326, which segments, in the released position shown in Fig. 15, extend substantially horizontally. A clamping ring 329 can be slid from the top side over the ring 361, and the segments 326 can be pressed into a substantially vertical position and retained in that position for attaching the valve assembly 308, as will be described hereinbelow. Provided in the clamping ring 329 is a central opening 363, through which at least the pressure body 321 can reach by its top end.<br>
In the position shown in Fig. 15, the valve assembly is closed, in the first position. By moving the pressure body 321 in the direction of the valve foot 319, against the pressure of the spring 347, a passage can be created between the shoulder 357 and the counterface 373 on the one hand and, when the pressure body 321 is pressed on further, the openings 356 will, on the other hand, at least be partially released above the transition face 353 in the pressure body 321, to create a fluid connection between the diptube 359 and the openings 355, at least the central passage 350 in the valve body 320 and the environment, via the openings 356. A partially open, second position is shown in Fig. 18, which position is suitable in particular for dispensing beverage. Fig. 16 is a perspective view of a valve assembly 308 according to the invention, in which the segments 326, the valve housing 318, the valve foot 319 and the openings 355 are clearly visible.<br>
Fig. 17 shows an alternative embodiment of a first coupling means 300, comprising a cylindrical apron 302 whose top end connects to a top face 301, from where a knee-shaped channel part 308 extends that is in open communication with the inner space 390 of the coupling part 300. In the inner space 390, two concentric, slightly spaced apart edges 398,<br><br><br>
399 extend downwards from the top face, enclosing a groove 397 which diverges on the open side.<br>
By the groove 397, the first coupling means 300 can be fixedly pressed onto the top edge of the pressure body 321, with the first edge 398 located on the inside and the second edge 399 located on the outside thereof, to create a gas-tight and liquid tight seal. This position is schematically shown in Fig. 18. An air channel 395 slantingly extends from a connecting opening 393 centrally located at the top of the first coupling part, to a position adjacent the longitudinal edge, where the air channel 395 connects to a passage 393 which opens between the apron 302 and the outer edge 399. In the position shown in Fig. 18, a fluid connection is created between the opening 393 and the passage between the shoulder 357 and the counterface 373, and hence with the gas passage openings 331. Thus, the pressure medium, in particular air, can be fed from the opening 393 into the container, between the wall 2 and the sheet-shaped package 4, or, when no sheet-shaped package is used, directly into the beverage to be dispensed. To that end, an air feed device (not shown) is gas-tightly connected to the opening 393, while at the same time, the first coupling part 300 is pressed in the direction of the valve foot 319 for moving the pressure body 321. The first pressure body 300 can be pressed down over a slight distance S2 only, in that the bottom edge of the apron 302 will run against the top side of the counterface 373. The transition face 353 will then be approximately at the level of the center of the openings 356, for reaching a limited flow-through rate.<br>
Integrally injection-molded on the outer end 391 of the channel 308 are two ribbed clamping parts 389, connected to the channel 308 via pressure connections 387. The clamping parts 389 are diametrically opposite each other and, in a position in which they are moved against each other, form a cylindrical part that can be clampingly slid into the open end of the channel 308. A dispensing tube 385 can, as shown<br><br>
Fig.   18,  be slid between the two clamping parts  389,   after which the two clamping parts,   with the  intermediate dispensing tube end,   can be  slid into the channel  308,   after the connections 387 have been broken.   Subsequently,   teeth 383 on the inside of  the clamping parts  389 will keep the tube 385  fixedly clamped.<br>
Fig.   19 shows a second coupling part 380,   disposed on a valve assembly 308 as shown  in Fig.   15,   fitted  in a container 301.  This second coupling part  380 comprises a pressure tube 381  having a central passage 384,   which pressure tube 381   is passed in a pressure block 382.   Provided in the pressure block 382  is  an air channel 376 which is in fluid connection with the passage,   formed during  opening of the valve assembly 308,  between the  shoulder 357   and the counterface 373.   The pressure  tube  381   connects gas-tightly and liquid-tightly to the top edge of  the pressure body 321, such that  it can be moved against the  spring 347   in  the direction of the valve foot  319 over a distance Sx. Consequently,   the passages  356  above  the  transition  face 353 are completely released,   allowing beverage to be passed,   via the passage 384  and the openings  356,   into the inner space of the container while displacing air present  in the  container 301,   via  the gas passage openings 331  and the space  formed between the shoulder 357 and  the  counterface 373,   to  the air channel  376 for discharge  to  the environment.   Complete release of the openings 356 provides a great filling flow rate.   The distance Sj is considerably larger than  the distance S2 through which the  first  coupling part   3 00  can be moved.<br>
In a valve assembly 3 08 as shown in Fig. 15, the valve body 320 can move against the spring pressure of the spring 347 in the direction of the pressure body 321, for instance when an (unduly) high pressure occurs in the inner space of the container 301. Thus, the top end 320B of the valve body 320 is moved to a position above the transition face 353, so that  at  least a part of the openings  356  thereabove  is<br><br><br>
released. Through this, a part of the contents of the container can flow away to the environment, so that pressure is let off.<br>
Since the end face 352 is flush with the transition face 353, a particularly simple cleaning of the valve assembly 308 is possible.<br>
As appears from Fig. 18, the container 301 is provided, adjacent its top end, with a neck having a groove 328 on its outside, which groove is located a some distance below the free upper longitudinal edge of the neck. A valve assembly 308 according to the invention can be slid into the neck from the top side, until the inside of the ring 361 rests on this top end. Subsequently, the clamping ring 329 is slid over the ring 361 and pressed down thereon, such that the segments 326 are forced into their vertical position, while clamping fingers 326A of the segments 326 will engage the groove 328. The clamping ring 329 will thus be clamped down on the ring 361. As a result, a firm connection between the valve assembly 308 and the neck of the container 301 is obtained in a particularly simple manner. The diptube 359 extends to a position adjacent the bottom end of the container. As shown in Fig. 18, a collar 400 is clamped between the ring 361 and the neck of the container 301. Fixed on the free end of the tube 385 is a knee piece 401, having an outflow opening 402 which, during use, is directed substantially vertically downwards. An engagement element 403 is provided for manipulation of the tube 385. This tube 385 is preferably flexible and hose-shaped. A container 301 with valve assembly 3 08 can for instance be used in an assembly as shown in Fig. 14.<br>
The invention is by no means limited to the exemplary embodiments represented in the specification and the drawings. Many variations thereof are possible within the framework of the invention outlined by the appended claims.<br>
For instance, connecting means for a source for pressure medium may be provided in another position on the<br><br>
montainer,   for instance adjacent the bottom side of the container.  Moreover,   the first and/or second coupling means may be designed differently.   The second coupling means may be fixedly designed on,   or at  least as part of,   a filling device.   The valve  housing  18  may be designed differently and for  instance be  secured on an outer container 2  in a different manner,   or may or may not be  fixedly connected thereto.   The entire container 1 may be recyclable,   yet preferably,   the valve assembly,   or at  least the valve housing,   is recyclable with at  least  the valve body and possibly the inner container 4  connected thereto,   while the outer container 2   is directly suitable  again for reuse. Kinematic reversals of parts  are understood to fall within the  framework of  the invention.   For instance,   the valve body within the relevant beverage  channels may connect  and may or may not  be of  solid construction with passage channels in a circumferential  face thereof,   while  for  instance a substantially axial  inflow direction of  the beverage may be provided.   Further,   the spring means,   if  any,   may be constructed in many ways.   Further,   stops  for the  first, second and third positions may be provided in different manners.   Also,   an inner container may be provided with a diptube construction connected to the valve assembly.  Also, different  types of  inner container may be provided,   for instance as described in non-prepublished Dutch patent application 1006949 or 1006950,   which are considered to be incorporated herein by reference,   in particular with regard to embodiments  for the inner  container,   connecting means for the pressure medium and any cooling means,   and for the tapping device,   in particular the tap  construction and hose.<br>
In particular when an  inner container is dispensed with,   a container according  to the invention can be  filled before a valve assembly according to the  invention  is inserted,   in particular through the opening into which the valve,   at  least  the valve assembly,   is  to be inserted.<br><br><br>
