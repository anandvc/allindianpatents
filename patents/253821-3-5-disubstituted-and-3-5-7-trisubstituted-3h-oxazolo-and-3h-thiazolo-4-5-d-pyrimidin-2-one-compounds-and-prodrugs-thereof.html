3,5-Disubstituted and 3,5,7-Trisubstituted-3H-Oxazolo and 3H-<br>
ThiazoIo[4,5-d]pyrimidin-2-one Compounds and Prodrugs Thereof<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to 3,5-disubstituted and 3,5 J-trisubstituted-3H-<br>
oxazolo and 3F-thiazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidin-2-one compounds and prodrags<br>
thereof that have immunomodulatory activity. The invention is also directed to<br>
the therapeutic or prophylactic use of such compounds and pharmaceutical<br>
compositions containing them, and to methods of treating diseases and disorders<br>
described herein, by administering effective amounts of such compounds and<br>
prodrugs.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The last few decades have seen significant efforts expended in exploring<br>
possible therapeutic uses of guanine analogs and nucleosides thereof. A number<br>
of nucleoside analogs are currently being marketed as antiviral drugs, including<br>
HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as AZT, ddl, ddC, d4T, 3TC and the<br>
guanosine nucleoside analog abacavir. While not adhering to a particular theory,<br>
nucleoside analogs may provide benefits by directly inhibiting the pathogen or<br>
tumor, by stimulation of host immune functions, or some combination of these<br>
or other mechanisms.<br>
One of the studied guanosine analogs with demonstrated<br>
immunomodulatory activity is 5-amino-3-(P-D-ribofuranosylthiazolo[4,5-<br>
d]pyrirnidine-2,7(3H, 6H) dione (7-thia-8-oxoguanosine). For example, certain<br>
pyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine nucleosides are disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,041,542 to Robins et al. as being effective in treatment against L1210 in BDF1<br>
mice. It addition, 3-P-D-ribofuranosylthiazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidihes demonstrating<br>
significant immunoactivity, including murine spleen cell proliferation and in<br>
vivo activity against Semliki Forest virus, are disclosed U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,041,426 and 4,880,784 to Robins et al. A number of publications have also<br>
described non-glycosyl derivatives of the thiazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidine moiety.<br>
See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,994,321 and 5,446,045; Revankar et ah, I Het<br>
Chem., 30,1341-49 (1993); Lewis et al, I Het. Chem., 32,547-56 (1995).<br><br>

compounds, and other compounds of the invention are utilized to treat bacterial,<br>
fungal, and protozoal infections in mammals by administering to the mammal a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of the compounds. The full range of pathogenic<br>
microorganisms is contemplated to be treatable by the compounds of the present<br>
invention, including without limitation those organisms that are resistant to<br>
antibiotics. The ability of compounds to activate multiple components of the<br>
immune system bypasses resistance mechanisms commonly found to reduce<br>
susceptibility to antibiotics, and thus treatment of infections in a mammal caused<br>
by such resistant microorganisms by Formula I prodrags, Formula II<br>
compounds, and other compounds of the invention is a particular utility of the<br>
present invention.<br>

compounds, and other compounds of the invention are utilized to treat tumors in<br>
mammals by administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of<br>
the compounds. Tumors or cancers contemplated to be treated include but are<br>
not limited to those caused by virus, and the effect may involve inhibiting the<br>
transformation of virus-infected cells to a neoplastic state, inhibiting the spread<br>
of viruses from transformed cells to other normal cells, and/or arresting the<br>
growth of virus-transformed cells. The compounds of the invention are expected<br>
to be useful against a broad spectrum of tumors including but not limited to<br>
carcinomas, sarcomas, and leukemias. Included in such a class are mammary,<br>
colon, bladder, lung, prostate, stomach, and pancreas carcinomas and<br>
lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemias.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, a method of treating a mammal<br>
comprises administering a therapeutically and/or prophylactically effective<br>
amount of a pharmaceutical containing a compound of the invention. In this<br>
aspect the effect may relate to modulation of some portion of the mammal's<br>
immune system, especially modulation of cytokine activities of Thl and Th2,<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/066080	PCT/US2005/045589<br>
including but not restricted to the interleukin family, e.g., EL-1 through IL-12,<br>
and other cytokines such as TNF alpha, and interferons including interferon<br>
alpha, interferon beta, and interferon gamma, and their downstream effectors.<br>
Where modulation of Till and Th2 cytokines occurs, it is contemplated that the<br>
modulation may include stimulation of both Thl and Th2, suppression of both<br>
Thl and Th2, stimulation of either Till or Th2, and suppression of the other, or a<br>
bimodai modulation in which one effect on Thl/Th2 levels (such as generalized<br>
suppression) occurs at a high concentration, while another effect (such as<br>
stimulation of either Thl or Th2 and suppression of the other) occurs at a lower<br>
concentration.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing a Formula I prodrug, Formula II compound, or other compound of the<br>
invention are administered in a therapeutically effective dose to a mammal that<br>
is receiving anti-infective drugs not included in the compounds of the invention.<br>

containing a Formula I prodrug, Formula II compound, or other compound of the<br>
invention are administered in a therapeutically effective dose with anti-infective<br>
drug(s) that act directly upon the infectious agent to inhibit the growth of or kill<br>
the infectious agent<br>

comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a Formula I prodrug provides<br>
for improved oral availability and administration as an immunomodulator. In<br>
another preferred aspect of the invention, a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a Formula I prodrug of the<br>
invention provides for masking the active structure as the agent passes through<br>
lymphoid tissue lining the stomach, thereby minimizing activation of this tissue<br>
and allowing for improved oral tolerability.<br>

The terms "a" and "p*" indicate the specific stereochemical configuration of a<br>
substituent at an asymmetric carbon atom in a chemical structure as drawn.<br>
The compounds of the invention may exhibit the phenomenon of<br>
tautomerism. While the formula drawings cannot expressly depict all possible<br>
tautomeric forms, it is to be understood they are intended to represent any<br>
tautomeric form of the depicted compound and are not to be limited merely to a<br>
specific compound form depicted by the formula drawings. For example, it is<br>
understood for Formula II that regardless of whether or not the substituents are<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2006/066080	PCT/US2005/045589<br>
shown in their enol or their keto form, they represent the same compound (as<br>
shown in the example below).<br><br>
Some of the inventive compounds may exist as single stereoisomers (i.e.,<br>
essentially free of other stereoisomers), racemates, and/or mixtures of<br>
enantiomers and/or diastereomers. All such single stereoisomers, racemates and<br>
mixtures thereof are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Preferably, the inventive compounds that are optically active are used in<br>
optically pure form-<br>
As generally understood by those skilled in the art, an optically pure<br>
compound having one chiral center (i.e., one asymmetric carbon atom) is one mat<br>
consists essentially of one of the two possible enantiomers (i.e., is enantiomerically<br>
pure), and an optically pure compound having more than one chiral center is one that<br>
is both diastereomerically pure and enantiomerically pure. Preferably, the<br>
compounds of the present invention are used in a form that is at least 90% optically<br>
pure, that is, a form that contains at least 90% of a single isomer (80% enantiomeric<br>
excess ("e.e.") or diastereomeric excess ("d.e.")), more preferably at least 95% (90%<br>
e.e. or d.e.), even more preferably at least 97.5% (95% e.e. or d.e.), and most<br>
preferably at least 99% (98% e.e. or d.e.).<br>
Additionally, Formula I prodrugs, Formula II compounds, and other<br>
compounds of the invention are intended to cover solvated as well as unsolvated<br>
forms of the identified structures. For example, Formula I includes compounds of<br>
the indicated structure in both hydrated and non-hydrated forms. Other examples of<br>
solvates include the structures in combination with isopropanol, ethanol, methanol,<br>
DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, or ethanolamine.<br>
In addition to Formula I prodrugs, Formula II compounds, and other<br>
compounds of the invention, the invention includes pharmaceutically active<br>
metabolites and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such compounds and<br>
metabolites.<br>

"A phannaceutically acceptable prodrug" is a compound that may be<br>
converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to the specified compound<br>
or to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of such compound prior to exhibiting its<br>
pharmacological effect (s). Typically, the prodrug is formulated with the<br>
objective(s) of improved chemical stability, improved patient acceptance and<br>
compliance, improved bioavailability, prolonged duration of action, improved organ<br>
selectivity, improved formulation (e.g., increased hydrosolubility), and/or decreased<br>
side effects (e.g., toxicity). The prodrug can be readily prepared using methods<br>
known in the art, such as those described by Burger's Medicinal Chemistry and<br>
Drug Chemistry, 1,172-178,949-982 (1995). See also Bertolini et al., /. Med.<br>

"A phannaceutically active metabolite" is intended to mean a<br>
pharmacologically active product produced through metabolism in the body of a<br>
specified compound or salt thereof. After entry into the body, most drugs are<br>
substrates for chemical reactions that may change their physical properties and<br>
biologic effects. These metabolic conversions, which usually affect the polarity of<br>
the compounds of the invention, alter the way in which drugs are distributed in and<br>
excreted from the body. However, in some cases, metabolism of a drug is required<br>
for therapeutic effect. For example, anticancer drugs of the anti-metabolite class<br>
must be converted to their active forms after they have been transported into a<br>
cancer cell.<br>
Since most drugs undergo metabolic transformation of some kind, the<br>
biochemical reactions that play a role in drug metabolism may be numerous and<br>
diverse. The main site of drug metabolism is the liver, although other tissues may<br>
also participate.<br>
A feature characteristic of many of these transformations is that the<br>
metabolic products, or "metabolites," are more polar than the parent drags, although<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2006/066080	PCT/US2005/045589<br>
a polar drug does sometime yield a less polar product. Substances with high<br>
lipid/water partition coefficients, which pass easily across membranes, also diffuse<br>
back readily from tubular urine through the renal tubular cells into the plasma.<br>
Thus, such substances tend to have a low renal clearance and a long persistence in<br>
the body. If a drag is metabolized to a more polar compound, one with a lower<br>
partition coefficient, its tubular reabsorption will be greatly reduced. Moreover, the<br>
specific secretory mechanisms for anions and cations in the proximal renal tubules<br>
and in the parenchymal liver cells operate upon highly polar substances.<br>
As a specific example, phenacetin (acetophenetidin) and acetanilide are both<br>
mild analgesic and antipyretic agents, but are transformed within the body to a more<br>
polar and more effective metabolite, p-hydroxyacetanilid (acetaminophen), which is<br>
widely used today. When a dose of acetanilide is given to a person, the successive<br>
metabolites peak and decay in the plasma sequentially. During the first hour,<br>
acetanilide is the principal plasma component In the second hour, as the acetanilide<br>
level falls, the metabolite acetaminophen concentration reaches a peak. Finally,<br>
after a few hours, the principal plasma component is a further metabolite that is inert<br>
and can be excreted from the body. Thus, the plasma concentrations of one or more<br>
metabolites, as well as the drug itself, can be pharmacologically important.<br>
"A pharmaceutically acceptable salt" is intended to mean a salt that retains<br>
the biological effectiveness of the free acids and bases of the specified compound<br>
and that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable: A compound of the invention<br>
may possess a sufficiently acidic, a sufficiently basic, or both functional groups, and<br>
accordingly react with any of a number of inorganic or organic bases, and inorganic<br>
and organic acids, to form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Exemplary<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those salts prepared by reaction of the<br>
compounds of the present invention with a mineral or organic acid or an inorganic<br>
base, such as salts including sulfates, pyrosulfates, bisulfates, sulfites, bisulfites,<br>
phosphates, monohydrogenphosphates, dihydfogehphosphates, metaphosphates,<br>
pyrophosphates, chlorides, bromides, iodides, acetates, propionates, decanoates,<br>
caprylates, acrylates, formates, isobutyrates, caproates, heptanoates, propiolates,<br>
oxalates, malonates, succinates, suberates, sebacates, fumarates, maleates, butyne-<br>
1,4-dioates, hexyne-l,6-dioates, benzoates, chlorobenzoates, methylbenzoates,<br>
dinitrobenzoates, hydroxybenzoates, methoxybenzoates, phthalates, sulfonates,<br>
27<br><br>

xylenesulfonates, phenylacetates, phenylpropionates, phenylbutyrates, citrates,<br>
lactates, Y-hydroxybutyrates, glycolates, tartrates, methane-sulfonates,<br>
propanesulfonates, naphthalene- 1-sulfonates, naphthalene-2-sulfonates, and<br>
mandelates.<br>
If the inventive compound is a base, the desired pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method available in the art, for<br>
example, treatment of the free base with an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric<br>
acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric add, phosphoric acid and the like, or<br>
with an organic acid, such as acetic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, mandelic<br>
acid, fumaric acid, malonic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid,<br>
salicylic acid, a pyranosidyl acid, such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid,<br>
an alpha-hydroxy acid, such as citric acid or tartaric acid, an amino acid, such as<br>
aspartic acid or glutamic acid, an aromatic acid, such as benzoic acid or<br>
cinnamic acid, a sulfonic acid, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid or ethanesulfonic<br>
acid, or the like.<br>
If the inventive compound is an acid, the desired pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method, for example, treatment<br>
of the free acid with an inorganic or organic base, such as an amine (primary,<br>
secondary or tertiary), an alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal<br>
hydroxide, or the like. Illustrative examples of suitable salts include organic<br>
salts derived from amino acids, such as glycine and arginine, ammonia, primary,<br>
secondary, and tertiary amines, and cyclic amines, such as piperidine,<br>
morpholine and piperazine, and inorganic salts derived from sodium, calcium,<br>
potassium, magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, aluminum and lithium.<br>
In the case of agents that are solids, it is understood by those skilled hi the art<br>
that the inventive compounds and salts may exist in different crystal or polymorphic<br>
forms, all of which are intended to be within the scope of the present invention and<br>
specified formulas.<br>

WO 2006/066080	PCT/US2005/045589<br>
The present invention further provides methods for introducing a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a Formula I prodrug, Formula II compound, or<br>
other compound of the invention or combination of such compounds into the blood<br>
stream of a patient in the treatment and/or prevention of hepatitis C viral infections.<br>
The magnitude of a prophylactic or therapeutic dose of a Formula I prodrug,<br>
Formula II compound, or other compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt, solvate, or hydrate, thereof in the acute or chronic treatment or<br>
prevention of an infection will vary, however, with the nature and severity of the<br>
infection, and the route by which the active ingredient is administered. The dose,<br>
and in some cases the dose frequency, will also vary according to the infection to be<br>
treated, the age, body weight, and response of the individual patient Suitable dosing<br>
regimens can be readily selected by those skilled in the art with due consideration of<br>
such factors.<br>
The methods of the present invention are particularly well suited for human<br>
patients. In particular, the methods and doses of the present invention can be useful<br>
for immunocompromised patients including, but not limited to cancer patients, HIV<br>
infected patients, and patients with an immunodegenerative disease. Furthermore,<br>
the methods can be useful for immunocompromised patients currently in a state of<br>
remission. The methods and doses of the present invention are also useful for<br>
patients undergoing other antiviral treatments. The prevention methods of the<br>
present invention are particularly useful for patients at risk of viral infection. These<br>
patients include, but are not limited to health care workers, e.g. doctors, nurses,<br>
hospice care givers; military personnel; teachers; childcare workers; patients<br>
traveling to, or living in, foreign locales, in particular third world locales including<br>
social aid workers, missionaries, and foreign diplomats. Finally, the methods and<br>
compositions include the treatment of refractory patients or patients resistant to<br>
treatment such as resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors,<br>
etc.<br>
Doses<br>
Toxicity and efficacy of the compounds of the invention can be determined<br>
by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g.,<br>
for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50<br>
(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio<br>

between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed<br>
as the ratio LD50/ED50.<br>
The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used<br>
in formulating a range of dosage of the compounds for use in humans. The dosage<br>
of such compounds lie preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that<br>
include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range<br>
depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.<br>
For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective<br>
dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated<br>
in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes<br>
the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half-maximal<br>
inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture; alternatively, the dose of the<br>
compounds may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma<br>
concentration range of the compound that corresponds to the concentration required<br>
to achieve a fixed magnitude of response. Such information can be used to more<br>
accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured,<br>
for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.<br>
The protocols and compositions of the invention are preferably tested in<br>
vitro, and then in vivo, for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to<br>
use in humans. For example, in vitro assays which can be used to determine<br>
whether administration of a specific therapeutic protocol is indicated, include in<br>
vitro cell culture assays in which cells that are responsive to the effects of Formula I<br>
prodrags, Formula II compounds, and other compounds of the invention are exposed<br>
to the ligand and the magnitude of response is measured by an appropriate<br>
technique. The assessment of the compounds is then evaluated with respect to the<br>
compound potency, and the degree of conversion between the Formula I prodrug<br>
and Formula II parent compound. Compounds for use in methods of the invention<br>
can be tested in suitable animal model systems prior to testing in humans, including<br>
but not limited to in rats, mice, chicken, cows, monkeys, rabbits, hamsters, etc. The<br>
compounds can then be used in the appropriate clinical trials.<br>
The magnitude of a prophylactic or therapeutic dose of a Formula I prodrug,<br>
Formula II compound, or other compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt, solvate, or hydrate thereof hi the acute or chronic treatment or<br>
prevention of an infection or condition will vary with the nature and severity of the<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2006/066080	PCT/US2005/045589<br>
infection, and the route by which the active ingredient is administered. The dose,<br>
and perhaps the dose frequency, will also vary according to the infection to be<br>
treated, the age, body weight, and response of the individual patient. Suitable dosing<br>
regimens can be readily selected by those skilled in the art with due consideration of<br>
such factors. In one embodiment, the dose administered depends upon the specific<br>
compound to be used, and the weight and condition of the patient Also, the dose<br>
may differ for various particular compounds of the invention; suitable doses can be<br>
predicted on the basis of the aforementioned in vitro measurements and on the basis<br>
of animal studies, such that smaller doses will be suitable for those compounds that<br>
show effectiveness at lower concentrations than other compounds when measured in<br>
the systems described or referenced herein.   In general, the dose per day is in the<br>
range of from about 0.001 to 100 mg/kg, preferably about 1 to 25 mg/kg, more<br>
preferably about 5 to 15 mg/kg. For treatment of humans infected by hepatitis C<br>
viruses, about 0.1 mg to about 15 g per day is administered in about one to four<br>
divisions a day, preferably 100 mg to 12 g per day, more preferably from 100 mg to<br>
8000 mg per day.<br>
Additionally, the recommended daily dose ran can be administered in cycles<br>
as single agents or in combination with other therapeutic agents. In one<br>
embodiment, the daily dose is administered in a single dose or in equally divided<br>
doses. In a related embodiment, the recommended daily dose can be administered<br>
once time per week, two times per week, three times per week, four times per week<br>
or five times per week.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the compounds of the invention are administered<br>
to provide systemic distribution of the compound within the patient. In a related<br>
embodiment, the compounds of the invention are administered to produce a systemic<br>
effect in the body.<br>
In another embodiment the compounds of the invention are administered via<br>
oral, mucosal (including sublingual, buccal, rectal, nasal, or vaginal), parenteral<br>
(including subcutaneous, intramuscular, bolus injection, intraarterial, or<br>
intravenous), transdermal, or topical administration. In a specific embodiment the<br>
compounds of the invention are administered via mucosal (including sublingual,<br>
buccal, rectal, nasal, or vaginal), parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular,<br>
bolus injection, intraarterial, or intravenous), transdermal, or topical administration.<br>
In a further specific embodiment, the compounds of the invention are administered<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2006/066080	PCT/US2005/045589<br>
via oral administration. In a further specific embodiment, the compounds of the<br>
invention are not administered via oral administration.<br>
Different therapeutically effective amounts may be applicable for different<br>
infections, as will be readily known by those of ordinary skill in the art. Similarly,<br>
amounts sufficient to treat or prevent such infections, but insufficient to cause, or<br>
sufficient to reduce, adverse effects associated with conventional therapies are also<br>
encompassed by the above described dosage amounts and dose frequency schedules.<br>
Combination Therapy<br>
Specific methods of the invention further comprise the administration of an<br>

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS AND DOSAGE FORMS<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions and single unit dosage forms comprising a<br>
Formula I prodrugs, Formula II compounds, and other compounds of the invention,<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, or hydrate thereof, are also encompassed by<br>
the invention. Individual dosage forms of the invention may be suitable for oral,   .<br>
mucosal (including sublingual, buccal, rectal, nasal, or vaginal), parenteral<br>
(including subcutaneous, intramuscular, bolus injection, intraarterial, or<br>
intravenous), transdermal, or topical administration. Pharmaceutical compositions<br>
and dosage forms of the invention typically also comprise one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable exdpients. Sterile dosage forms are also contemplated.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition encompassed<br>
by this embodiment includes a Formula I prodrug, Formula II compound, or other<br>
compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, or hydrate thereof,<br>
and at least one additional therapeutic agent Examples of additional therapeutic<br>
agents include, but are not limited to, those listed above.<br>
The composition, shape, and type of dosage forms of the invention will<br>
typically vary depending on their use. For example, a dosage form used in the acute<br>
treatment of a disease or a related disease may contain larger amounts of one or<br>
38<br><br>
WO 2006/066080	PCT/US2005/045589<br>
more of the active ingredients it comprises than a dosage form used in the chronic<br>
treatment of the same disease. Similarly, a parenteral dosage form may contain<br>
smaller amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than an oral<br>
dosage form used to treat the same disease or disorder. These and other ways in<br>
which specific dosage forms encompassed by this invention will vary from one<br>
another will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed, Mack Publishing, Easton PA (1990). Examples<br>
of dosage forms include, but are not limited to: tablets; caplets; capsules, such as<br>
soft elastic gelatin capsules; cachets; troches; lozenges; dispersions; suppositories;<br>
ointments; cataplasms (poultices); pastes; powders; dressings; creams; plasters;<br>
solutions; patches; aerosols (e.g., nasal sprays or inhalers); gels; liquid dosage forms<br>
suitable for oral or mucosal administration to a patient, including suspensions (e.g.,<br>
aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspensions, oil-in-water emulsions, or a water-in-oil<br>
liquid emulsions), solutions, and elixirs; liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral<br>
administration to a patient; and sterile solids (e.g., crystalline or amorphous solids)<br>
that can be reconstituted to provide liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral<br>
administration to a patient.<br>
Typical pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprise one or<br>
more carriers, excipients or diluents. Suitable excipients are well known to those<br>
skilled in the art of pharmacy, and non-limiting examples of suitable excipients are<br>
provided herein. Whether a particular excipient is suitable for incorporation into a<br>
pharmaceutical composition or dosage form depends on a variety of factors well<br>
known in the art including, but not limited to, the way in which the dosage form will<br>
be administered to a patient For example, oral dosage forms such as tablets may<br>
contain excipients not suited for use in parenteral dosage forms. The suitability of a<br>
particular excipient may also depend on the specific active ingredients in the dosage<br>
form.<br>
This invention further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions<br>
and dosage forms comprising active ingredients, since water can facilitate the<br>
degradation of some compounds. For example, the addition of water (e.g., 5%) is<br>
widely accepted in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long-term<br>
storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of<br>
formulations over time. See, e.g., Jens T. Carstensen, Drug Stability: Principles &amp;<br>
Practice, 2d. Ed., Marcel Dekker, NY, NY, 1995, pp. 379-80. In effect, water and<br>
39<br><br>
WO 2006/066080	PCT/US2005/04SS89<br>
heat accelerate the decomposition of some compounds. Thus, the effect of water on<br>
a formulation can be of great significance since moisture and/or humidity are<br>
commonly encountered during manufacture, handling, packaging, storage, shipment,<br>
and use of formulations.<br>
Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention<br>
can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low<br>
moisture or low humidity conditions.<br>
An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition should be prepared and stored<br>
such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous compositions<br>
are preferably packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such<br>
that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging<br>
include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastics, unit dose<br>
containers (g.g.( vials), blister packs, and strip packs.<br>
The invention further encompasses pharmaceutical compositions and dosage<br>
forms that comprise one or more compounds that reduce the rate by which an active<br>
ingredient will decompose. Such compounds, which are referred to herein as<br>
"stabilizers," include, but are not limited to, antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, pH<br>
buffers, or salt buffers.<br>
Like the amounts and types of excipients, the amounts and specific types of<br>
active ingredients in a dosage form may differ depending on factors such as, but not<br>
limited to, the route by which it is to be administered to patients. However, typical.<br>
dosage forms of the invention comprise compounds of the invention, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt or hydrate thereof comprise 0.1 mg to 1500 mg per<br>
unit to provide doses of about 0.01 to 200 mg/kg per day.<br>
Oral Dosage Forms<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention that are suitable for oral<br>
administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms, such as, but are not limited<br>
to, tablets (e.g., chewable tablets), caplets, capsules, and liquids (e.g., flavored<br>
syrups). Such dosage forms contain predetermined amounts of active ingredients,<br>
and may be prepared by methods of pharmacy well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
See generally, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed., Mack Publishing,<br>
EastonPA(1990).<br>
Typical oral dosage forms of the invention are prepared by combining the<br>
active ingredients) in an intimate admixture with at least one excipient according to<br>
40<br><br>
WO 2006/066080	PCT/US2005/045589<br>
conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. Excipients can take a wide<br>
variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration.<br>
For example, excipients suitable for use in oral liquid or aerosol dosage forms<br>
include, but are not limited to, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents,<br>
preservatives, and coloring agents. Examples of excipients suitable for use in solid<br>
oral dosage forms (e.g., powders, tablets, capsules, and caplets) include, but are not<br>
limited to, starches, sugars, micro-crystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents,<br>
lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents.<br>
Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the<br>
most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid excipients are<br>
employed. If desired, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous<br>
techniques. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy.<br>
In general, pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms are prepared by<br>
uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredients with liquid carriers, finely<br>
divided solid carriers, or both, and then shaping the product into the desired<br>
presentation if necessary.<br>
For example, a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding.<br>
Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active<br>
ingredients in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed<br>
with an excipient. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a<br>
mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.<br>
Examples of excipients that can be used in oral dosage forms of the invention<br>
include, but are not limited to, binders, fillers, disintegrants, and lubricants. Binders<br>
suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are<br>
not limited to, corn starch, potato starch, or other starches,, gelatin, natural and<br>
synthetic gums such as acacia, sodium alginate, alginic acid, other alginates,<br>
powdered tragacanth, guar gum, cellulose and its derivatives (e.g., ethyl cellulose,<br>
cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, sodium carbdxymethyl<br>
cellulose), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch,<br>
hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, (e.g., Nos. 2208,2906,2910), microcrystalline<br>
cellulose, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of fillers suitable for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and<br>
dosage forms disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, talc, calcium carbonate<br>
(e.g., granules or powder), microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, dextrates,<br>
41<br><br>
WO 2006/066080	PCT/US2005/045589<br>
kaolin, mannitol, silicic acid, sorbitol, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, and mixtures<br>
thereof. The binder or filler in pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is<br>
typically present in from about 50 to about 99 weight percent of the pharmaceutical<br>
composition or dosage form.<br>
Suitable forms of microcrystalline cellulose include, but are not limited to,<br>
the materials sold as AVICEL-PH-101, AVICEL-PH-103 AVICEL RC-581,<br>
AVICEL-PH-105 (available from FMC Corporation, American Viscose Division,<br>
Avicel Sales, Marcus Hook, PA), and mixtures thereof. An specific binder is a<br>
mixture of microcrystalline cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose sold as<br>
AVICEL RC-581. Suitable anhydrous or low moisture excipients or additives<br>
include AVICEL-PH-103™ and Starch 1500 LM.<br>
Disintegrants are used in the compositions of the invention to provide tablets<br>
that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment Tablets that contain too<br>
much disintegrant may disintegrate in storage, while those that contain too little may<br>
not disintegrate at a desired rate or under the desired conditions. Thus, a sufficient<br>
amount of disintegrant that is neither too much nor too little to detrimentally alter<br>
the release of the active ingredients should be used to form solid oral dosage forms<br>
of the invention. The amount of disintegrant used varies based upon the type of<br>
formulation, and is readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art Typical<br>
pharmaceutical compositions comprise from about 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of<br>
disintegrant, specifically from about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant.<br>
Disintegrants that can be used in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage<br>
forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, agar-agar, alginic acid,<br>
calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone,<br>
polacrilin potassium, sodium starch glycolate, potato or tapioca starch, pre-<br>
gelatinized starch, other starches, clays, other algins, other celluloses, gums, and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
Lubricants that can be used in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage<br>
forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate, magnesium<br>
stearate, mineral oil, light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene<br>
glycol, other glycols, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, hydrogenated<br>
vegetable oil {e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil,<br>
corn oil, and soybean oil), zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethyl laureate, agar, and<br>
mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include, for example, a syloid silica gel<br>
42<br><br>
WO 2006/066080	PCT/US2005/045589<br>
(AEROSIL 200, manufactured by W.R. Grace Co. of Baltimore, MD), a coagulated<br>
aerosol of synthetic silica (marketed by Degussa Co. of Piano, TX), CAB-O-SIL (a<br>
pyrogenic silicon dioxide product sold by Cabot Co. of Boston, MA), and mixtures<br>
thereof. If used at all, lubricants are typically used in an amount of less than about 1<br>
weight percent of the pharmaceutical compositions or dosage forms into which they<br>
are incorporated.<br>
Delayed Release Dosage Forms<br>
Active ingredients of the invention can be administered by controlled release<br>
means or by delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Patent Nos.:<br>
3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; and 4,008,719, 5,674,533,5,059,595,<br>
5,591,767,5,120,548, 5,073,543,5,639,476, 5,354,556, and 5,733,566, each of<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to<br>
provide slow or controlled-release of one or more active ingredients using, for<br>
example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable<br>
membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes,<br>
microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in<br>
varying proportions. Suitable controlled-release formulations known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for<br>
use with the active ingredients of the invention. The invention thus encompasses<br>
single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to,<br>
tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled-release.<br>
All controlled-release pharmaceutical products have a common goal of<br>
improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non-controlled counterparts.<br>
Ideally, the use of an optimally designed controlled-release preparation in medical<br>
treatment is characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure<br>
or control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled-<br>
release formulations include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage<br>
frequency, and increased patient compliance. In addition, controlled-release<br>
formulations can be used to affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics,<br>
such as blood levels of the drug, and can thus affect the occurrence of side (e.g.,<br>
adverse) effects.<br>
Most controlled-release formulations are designed to initially release an<br>
amount of drug (active ingredient) that promptly produces the desired therapeutic<br>
43<br><br>
WO 2006/066080	PCT/US2005/045589<br>
effect, and gradually and continually release of other amounts of drug to maintain<br>
this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In<br>
order to maintain this constant level of drug in the body, the drug must be released<br>
from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of drug being<br>
metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled-release of an active ingredient<br>
can be stimulated by various conditions including, but not limited to, pH,<br>
temperature, enzymes, water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.<br>
Parenteral Dosage Forms<br>
Parenterai dosage forms can be administered to patients by various routes<br>
including, but not limited to, subcutaneous, intravenous (including bolus injection),<br>
intramuscular, and intraarterial. Because their administration typically bypasses<br>
patients' natural defenses against contaminants, parenteral dosage forms are<br>
preferably sterile or capable of being sterilized prior to administration to a patient.<br>
Examples of parenteral dosage forms include, but are not limited to, solutions ready<br>
for injection, dry and/or lyophylized products ready to be dissolved or suspended in<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle for injection (reconstitutable powders),<br>
suspensions ready for injection, and emulsions.<br>
Suitable vehicles that can be used to provide parenteral dosage forms of the<br>
invention are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples include, but are not<br>
limited to: Water for Injection USP; aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to,<br>
Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Dextrose Injection, Dextrose and<br>
Sodium Chloride Injection, and Lactated Ringer's Injection; water-miscible vehicles<br>
such as, but not limited to, ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene<br>
glycol; and non-aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, corn oil, cottonseed oil,<br>
peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate.<br>
Compounds that increase the solubility of one or more of the active ingredients<br>
disclosed herein can also be incorporated into the parenteral dosage forms of the<br>
invention.<br>
Transdermal Dosage Forms<br>
Transdermal dosage forms include "reservoir type" or "matrix type" patches,<br>
which can be applied to the skin and worn for a specific period of time to permit the<br>
penetration of a desired amount of active ingredients.<br>
Suitable excipients (e.g., carriers and diluents) and other materials that can<br>
be used to provide transdermal and topical dosage forms encompassed by this<br>
44<br><br>
WO 2006/066080	PCT/US2005/045589<br>
invention are well known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts, and depend on<br>
the particular tissue to which a given pharmaceutical composition or dosage form<br>
will be applied. With that fact in mind, typical excipients include, but are not<br>
limited to, water, acetone, ethanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butane-1,3-<br>
diol, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, mineral oil, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Depending on the specific tissue to be treated, additional components may be used<br>
prior to, in conjunction with, or subsequent to treatment with active ingredients of<br>
the invention. For example, penetration enhancers can be used to assist in delivering<br>
the active ingredients to the tissue. Suitable penetration enhancers include, but are<br>
not limited to: acetone; various alcohols such as ethanol, oleyl, and tetrahydrofuryl;<br>
alkyl sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide; dimethyl acetamide; dimethyl<br>
formamide; polyethylene glycol; pyrrolidones such as polyvinylpyrrolidone;<br>
Kollidon grades (Povidone, Polyvidone); urea; and various water-soluble or<br>
insoluble sugar esters such as Tween 80 (polysorbate 80) and Span 60 (sorbitan<br>
monostearate).<br>
The pH of a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form, or of the tissue to<br>
which the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form is applied, may also be<br>
adjusted to improve delivery of one or more active ingredients. Similarly, the<br>
polarity of a solvent carrier, its ionic strength, or tonicity can be adjusted to improve<br>
delivery. Compounds such as stearates can also be added to pharmaceutical<br>
compositions or dosage forms to advantageously alter the hydrophilicity or<br>
lipophilicity of one or more active ingredients so as to improve delivery. In this<br>
regard, stearates can serve as a lipid vehicle for the formulation, as an emulsifying<br>
agent or surfactant, and as a delivery-enhancing or penetration-enhancing agent<br>
Different salts, hydrates or solvates of the active ingredients can be used to further<br>
adjust the properties of the resulting composition.<br>
Topical Dosage Forms<br>
Topical dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, creams,<br>
lotions, ointments, gels, solutions, emulsions, suspensions, or other forms known to<br>
one of skill in the art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th eds.,<br>
Mack Publishing, Easton PA (1990); and Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage<br>
Forms, 4th ed., Lea &amp; Febiger, Philadelphia (1985).<br>
Suitable excipients (e.g., carriers and diluents) and other materials that can<br>
be used to provide transdermal and topical dosage forms encompassed by this<br>
45<br><br>
WO 2006/066080	PCT/US2005/045589<br>
invention are well known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts, and depend on<br>
the particular tissue to which a given pharmaceutical composition or dosage form<br>
will be applied. With that fact in mind, typical excipients include, but are not<br>
limited to, water, acetone, ethanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butane-1,3-<br>
diol, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, mineral oil, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Depending on the specific tissue to be treated, additional components may be<br>
used prior to, in conjunction with, or subsequent to treatment with active ingredients<br>
of the invention. For example, penetration enhancers can be used to assist in<br>
delivering the active ingredients to the tissue. Suitable penetration enhancers<br>
include, but are not limited to: acetone; various alcohols such as ethanol, oleyl, and<br>
tetrahydrofuryl; alkyl sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide; dimethyl acetamide;<br>
dimethyl formamide; polyethylene glycol; pyrrolidones such as<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone; Kollidon grades (Povidone, Polyvidone); urea; and various<br>
water-soluble or insoluble sugar esters such as Tween 80 (polysorbate 80) and Span<br>
60 (sorbitan monostearate).<br>
Mucosal Dosage Forms<br>
Mucosal dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to,<br>
ophthalmic solutions, sprays and aerosols, or other forms known to one of skill in<br>
the art See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th eds., Mack<br>
Publishing, Easton PA (1990); and Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms,<br>
4th ed., Lea &amp; Febiger, Philadelphia (1985). Dosage forms suitable for treating<br>
mucosal tissues within the oral cavity can be formulated as mouthwashes or as oral<br>
gels.. In one embodiment, the aerosol comprises a carrier. In another embodiment,<br>
the aerosol is carrier free.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be administered directly to the<br>
lung by inhalation. For administration by inhalation, a compound of the invehtionr<br>
can be conveniently delivered to the lung by a number of different devices. For<br>
example, a Metered Dose Inhaler ("MDI") which utilizes canisters that contain a<br>
suitable low boiling propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane,<br>
trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable<br>
gas can be used to deliver a compound directly to the lung. MDI devices are<br>
available from a number of suppliers such as 3M Corporation, Aventis, Boehringer<br>
tngleheim, Forest Laboratories, Glaxo-Wellcome, Schering Plough and Vectura.<br>
46<br><br>
WO 2006/066080	PCT/US2005/045589<br>
Alternatively, a Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI) device can be used to administer a<br>
compound of the invention to the lung (see, e.g., Raleigh et ah, Proc. Amer. Assoc.<br>
Cancer Research Annual Meeting, 1999,40,397, which is herein incorporated by<br>
reference). DPI devices typically use a mechanism such as a burst of gas to create a<br>
cloud of dry powder inside a container, which can then be inhaled by the patient.<br>
DPI devices are also well known in the art and can be purchased from a number of<br>
vendors which include, for example, Fisons, Glaxo-Wellcome, Inhale Therapeutic<br>
Systems, ML Laboratories, Qdose and Vectura. A popular variation is the multiple<br>
dose DPI ("MDDPI") system, which allows for the delivery of more than one<br>
therapeutic dose. MDDPI devices are available from companies such as<br>
AstraZcneca, GlaxoWellcome, IVAX, Schering Plough, SkyePharma and Vectura.<br>
For example, capsules and cartridges of gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator<br>
can be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder<br>
base such as lactose or starch for these systems.<br>
Another type of device that can be used to deliver a compound of the<br>
invention to the lung is a liquid spray device supplied, for example, by Aradigm<br>
Coiporation. Liquid spray systems use extremely small nozzle holes to aerosolize<br>
liquid drug formulations that can then be directly inhaled into the lung.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a nebulizer device is used to deliver a compound<br>
of tlie invention to the lung. Nebulizers create aerosols from liquid drug<br>
formulations by using, for example, ultrasonic energy to form fine particles that can<br>
be readily inhaled (See e.g., Verschoyle et ah, British J. Cancer, 1999, 80, Suppl 2,<br>
96, which is herein incorporated by reference). Examples of nebulizers include<br>
devices supplied by Sheffield/Systemic Pulmonary Delivery Ltd. (See, Armer et ah,<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,954,047; van der Linden et ah, U.S. Pat. No. 5,950,619; van der<br>
Linden et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,970,974, which are herein incorporated by reference),<br>
Aventis and Batelle Pulmonary Therapeutics.   .<br>
Ma particularly preferred embodiment, an electrohydrodynamic ("EHD")<br>
aerosol device is used to deliver compounds of the invention to the lung. EHD<br>
aerosol devices use electrical energy to aerosolize liquid drug solutions or<br>
suspensions (see, e.g., Noakes et ah, U.S. Pat. No. 4,765,539; Coffee, U.S. Pat. No.,<br>
4,962,885; Coffee, PCT Application, WO 94/12285; Coffee, PCT Application, WO<br>
94/14543; Coffee, PCT Application, WO 95/26234, Coffee, PCT Application, WO<br>
95/26235, Coffee, PCT Application, WO 95/32807, which are herein incorporated<br>
47<br><br>
WO 2006/066080	PCT/US200S/045589<br>
by reference). The electrochemical properties of the formulation may be important<br>
parameters to optimize when delivering this drug to the lung with an EHD aerosol<br>
device and such optimization is routinely performed by one of skill in the art. EHD<br>
aerosol devices may more efficiently delivery drugs to the lung than existing<br>
pulmonary delivery technologies. Other methods of intra-pulmonary delivery of the<br>
compounds of the invention will be known to the skilled artisan and are within the<br>
scope of the invention.<br>
Liquid drug formulations suitable for use with nebulizers and liquid spray<br>
devices and EHD aerosol devices will typically include a compound of the invention<br>
with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferably, the pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier is a liquid such as alcohol, water, polyethylene glycol or a<br>
perfluorocarbon. Optionally, another material may be added to alter the aerosol<br>
properties of the solution or suspension of the compound. Preferably, this material<br>
is liquid such as an alcohol, glycol, polyglycol or a fatty acid. Other methods of<br>
formulating liquid drug solutions or suspension suitable for use in aerosol devices<br>
are known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., Biesalski, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,112,598;<br>
Biesalski, 5,556,611, which are herein incorporated by reference) A compound can<br>
also be formulated in rectal or vaginal compositions such as suppositories or<br>
retention enemas, e.g.t containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa<br>
butter or other glycerides.<br>
In addition to the formulations described previously, a compound of the<br>
invention can also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting<br>
formulations can be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or<br>
intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds<br>
can be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example, as<br>
an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble<br>
derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
Alternatively, other pharmaceutical delivery systems can be employed.<br>
Liposomes and emulsions are well known examples of delivery vehicles that can be<br>
used to deliver the compounds of the invention. Certain organic solvents such as<br>
dimethylsulfoxide can also be employed, although usually at the cost of greater<br>
toxicity. The compounds of the invention can also be delivered in a controlled<br>
release system, hi one embodiment, a pump can be used (Sefton, CRC Crit. Ref<br>
BiomedEng., 1987,14,201; Buchwald et al., Surgery, 1980,88,507; Saudeke et al.,<br>
48<br><br>
WO 2006/066080	PCT/US2005/04S589<br>
N. Engl J. Med., 1989,321,574). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can<br>
be used (see Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.),<br>
CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product<br>
Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger<br>
and Peppas, J. Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chetn., 1983,23, 61; see also Levy<br>
et al, Science, 1985,228,190; During et at, Ann. Neurol, 1989,25,351; Howard et<br>
at, 1989, J Neurosurg. 71,105). In yet another embodiment, a controlled-release<br>
system can be placed in proximity of the target of the compounds of the invention,<br>
e.g., the lung, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e,g,, Goodson,<br>
in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, voL 2, pp. 115 (1984)). Other .<br>
controlled-release system can be used (see, e.g. Langer, Science, 1990,249,1527).<br>
Suitable excipients (e.g., carriers and diluents) and other materials that can<br>
be used to provide mucosal dosage forms encompassed by this invention are well<br>
known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts, and depend on the particular site<br>
or method which a given pharmaceutical composition or dosage form will be<br>
administered. With that fact in mind, typical excipients include, but are not limited<br>
to, water, ethanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butane-l,3-diol, isopropyl<br>
myristate, isopropyl palmitate, mineral oil, and mixtures thereof, which are non-<br>
toxic and pharmaceutically acceptable. Examples of such additional ingredients are<br>
well known in the art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th eds.,<br>
Mack Publishing, Easton PA (1990).<br>
The pH of a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form, or of the tissue to<br>
which the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form is applied, can also be<br>
adjusted to improve delivery of one or more active ingredients. Similarly, the<br>
polarity of a solvent carrier, its ionic strength, or tonicity can.be adjusted to improve<br>
delivery. Compounds such as stearates can also be added to pharmaceutical<br>
compositions or dosage forms to advantageously alter the hydrophilicity or<br>
lipophilicity of one or more active ingredients so as to improve delivery. In this<br>
regard, stearates can serve as a lipid vehicle for the formulation, as an emulsifying<br>
agent or surfactant, and as a delivery-enhancing or penetration-enhancing agent<br>
Different salts, hydrates or solvates of the active ingredients can be used to further<br>
adjust the properties of the resulting composition.<br>

Preparation of Compounds<br>
In the synthetic schemes described below, unless otherwise indicated all<br>
temperatures are set forth in degrees Celsius and all parts and percentages are by<br>
weight. Reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers such as Aldrich<br>
Chemical Company or Lancaster Synthesis Ltd. and were used without further<br>
purification unless otherwise indicated. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and N, N-<br>
dimethylforamide (DMF) were purchased from Aldrich in Sure Seal bottles and used<br>
as received. Unless otherwise indicated, the following solvents and reagents were<br>
50<br><br>
WO 2006/066080	PCT/US2005/045589<br>
distilled under a blanket of dry nitrogen. THF, and EtaO were distilled from Na-<br>
benzophenone ketyi; CH2CI2, diisopropylamine, pyridine and Et3N were distilled<br>
from CaH2; MeCN was distilled first fromPaOs, then from CaHb; MeOH was<br>
distilled from Mg; PhMe, EtOAc and i-PrOAc were distilled from CaH2; TFAA was<br>
purified via simple atmospheric distillation under dry argon.<br>
The reactions set forth below were done generally under a positive pressure<br>
of argon at an ambient temperature (unless otherwise stated) in anhydrous solvents,<br>
and the reaction flasks were fitted with rubber septa for the introduction of substrates<br>
and reagents via syringe. Glassware was oven dried and/or heat dried. The<br>
reactions were assayed by TLC and terminated as judged by the consumption of<br>
starting material. Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on<br>
aluminum-backed silica gel 60 F254 0.2 mm plates (EM Science), and visualized<br>
with UV light (254 nm) followed by heating with commercial ethanolic<br>
phosphomolybdic acid. Preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC) was<br>
performed on aluminum-backed silica gel 60 F2541.0 mm plates (EM Science) and<br>
visualized with UV light (254 nm).<br>
Work-ups were typically done by doubling the reaction volume with the<br>
reaction solvent or extraction solvent and then washing with the indicated aqueous<br>
solutions using 25% by volume of the extraction volume unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Product solutions were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and/or Mg2SC&gt;4 prior to<br>
filtration and evaporation of the solvents under reduced pressure on a rotary<br>
evaporator and noted as solvents removed in vacuo. Column chromatography was<br>
completed under positive pressure using 230-400 mesh silica gel or 50-200 mesh<br>
neutral alumina. Hydrogenolysis was done at the pressure indicated in the examples<br>
or at ambient pressure.<br>
-NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury-VX400 instrument<br>
operating at 400 MHz and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded operating at 75 MHz.<br>
NMR spectra were obtained as CDCI3 solutions (reported in ppm), using chloroform<br>
as the reference standard (7.27 ppm and 77.00 ppm), CD3OD (3.4 and 4.8 ppm and<br>
49.3 ppm), DMSO-d6, or internally tetramemylsilane (0.00 ppm) when appropriate.<br>
Other NMR solvents were used as needed. When peak multiplicities are reported,<br>
the following abbreviations are used: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet),<br>

m (multiplet), br (broadened), dd (doublet of doublets), dt (doublet of triplets).<br>
Coupling constants, when given, are reported in Hertz (Hz).<br>
Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a FT-IR Spectrometer as neat oils, as<br>
KBr pellets, or as CDCI3 solutions, and when given are reported in wave numbers<br>
(cm"1). Mass spectra reported are (+)-ES LC/MS conducted by the Analytical<br>
Chemistry Department of Anadys Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Elemental analyses were<br>
conducted by the Atlantic Microlab, Inc. in Norcross, GA. Melting points (mp)<br>
were determined on an open capillary apparatus, and are uncorrected.<br>

Anti-Viral Activity of Compounds<br>
A number of assays may be employed in accordance with the present<br>
invention in order to determine the degree of anti-viral activity of a compound of the<br>
invention such as cell culture, animal models, and administration to human subjects.<br>
The assays described herein may be used to assay viral growth over time to<br>
determine the growth characteristics of a virus in the presence of a compound of the<br>
invention.<br>
In another embodiment, a virus and a compound of the invention are<br>
administered to animal subjects susceptible to infection with the virus. The<br>
incidence, severity, length, virus load, mortality rate of infection, etc. can be<br>
compared to the incidence, severity, length, virus load, mortality rate of infection,<br>
etc. observed when subjects are administered the virus alone (in the absence of a<br>
compound of the invention). Anti-virus activity of the compound of the invention is<br>
demonstrated by a decrease in incidence, severity, length, virus load, mortality rate<br>
of infection, etc. in the presence of the compound of the invention. In a specific<br>
embodiment, the virus and the compound of the invention are administered to the<br>
animal subject at the same time, hi another specific embodiment, the virus is<br>
administered to the animal subject before the compound of the invention. In another<br>
specific embodiment, the compound of the invention is administered to the animal<br>
subject before the virus.<br>
In another embodiment, the growth rate of the virus can be tested by<br>
sampling biological fluids/clinical samples (e.g.t nasal aspirate, throat swab, sputum,<br>
broncho-alveolar lavage, urine, saliva, blood, or serum) from human or animal<br>
subjects at multiple time points post-infection either in the presence or absence of a<br>
compound of the invention and measuring levels of virus. In specific embodiments,<br>
the growth rate of a virus is assayed by assessing the presence of virus in a sample<br>
after growth in cell culture, growth on a permissible growth medium, or growth in<br>
subject using any method well-known in the art, for example, but not limited to,<br>
immunoassay (e.g., ELISA; for discussion regarding ELISAs see, e.g., Ausubel et<br>
131<br><br>
WO 2006/066080	PCT/US2005/045589<br>
al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. I, John Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>
Inc., New York at 11.2.1), immunofiuorescent staining, or immunoblot analysis<br>
using an antibody which immunospecifically recognizes the virus to be assayed or<br>
detection of a virus-specific nucleic acid (e.g., by Southern blot or RT-PCR analysis,<br>
etc.).<br>
In a specific embodiment, viral titers can be determined by obtaining<br>
biological fluids/clinical samples from infected cells or an infected subject,<br>
preparing a serial dilution of the sample and infecting a monolayer of cells that are<br>
susceptible to infection with the virus (e.g. primary cells, transformed cell lines,<br>
patient tissue samples, etc) at a dilution of the virus that allows for the emergence of<br>
single plaques. The plaques can then be counted and the viral liter expressed as<br>
plaque forming units per milliliter of sample.<br>
In one specific embodiment, the growth rate of a virus in a subject can be<br>
estimated by the titer of antibodies against the virus in the subject. Antibody serum<br>
liter can be determined by any method well-known in the art, for example, but not<br>
limited to, the amount of antibody or antibody fragment in serum samples can be<br>
quantitated by, e.g., ELISA. Additionally, in vivo activity of a Formula I compound<br>
can be determined by directly administering the compound to a test animal,<br>
collecting biological fluids (e.g., nasal aspirate, throat swab, sputum, broncho-<br>
alveolar lavage, urine, saliva, blood, or serum) and testing the fluid for anti-virus<br>
activity.<br>
In embodiments where samples to be assayed for virus levels are biological<br>
fluids/clinical samples (e.g.t nasal aspirate, throat swab, sputum, broncho-alveolar<br>
lavage, urine, saliva, blood, or serum), the samples may or may not contain in tact<br>
cells. Samples from subjects containing intact cells can be directly processed,<br>
whereas isolates without intact cells may or may not be first cultured on a<br>
permissive cell line (e.g. primary cells, transformed cell lines, patient tissue samples,<br>

In another embodiment, a compound of the invention is administered to a<br>
human subject infected with a virus. The incidence, severity, length, viral load,<br>
mortality rate of infection, etc. can be compared to the incidence, severity, length,<br>
viral, load, mortality rate of infection, etc. observed in human subjects infected with<br>
a virus in me absence of a compound of the invention or in the presence of a<br>
placebo. Anti-viral activity of the compound of the invention is demonstrated by a<br>
decrease in incidence, severity, length, viral load, mortality rate of infection, etc, in<br>
the presence of the compound of the invention. Any method known in the art can be<br>
used to determine anti-viral activity in a subject such as those described previously.<br>
Additionally, in vivo activity of a Formula I prodrug can be determined by<br>
directly administering the compound to an animal or human subject, collecting<br>
biological fluids/clinical samples (e.g., nasal aspirate, throat swab, sputum, broncho-<br>
alveolar lavage, urine, saliva, blood, or serum) and testing the biological<br>
fluids/clinical samples for anti-viral activity (e.g., by addition to cells in culture in<br>
the presence of the virus).<br>
Metabolism of Formula I Prodrugs<br>
The Formula I prodrugs of the present invention, must be metabolized to<br>
Formula II compounds and other compounds of the invention in the body if they are<br>
to serve as effective prodrugs. Hepatocyes often are used to assess the degree to<br>
which a compound may be transformed in the body of an animal, and it is known<br>
that such transformations may vary with hepatocytes from different species in a way<br>
that reflects metabolism in the whole animal. See Seddon T. et ah, Biochem<br>
Pharmacol, 38(10), 1657-65 (1989).<br>
A study was undertaken to evaluate the metabolic stability of Formula I<br>
compounds 14,15,13,114,30,103,67,65, and 76 in the presence of fresh<br>
cynomolgus monkey hepatocytes and monitor the formation of 6-oxy metabolites,<br>
i.e., Formula II compounds and other compounds of the invention. For comparison,<br>
the metabolic stability of famciclovir was also assessed.<br>
Preparation of Fresh Hepatocyte Suspension<br>
Fresh cynomolgus monkey hepatocyte suspension (Lot #: Cyl41) was<br>
purchased from CellzDirect (Tucson, AZ). Hepatocyte Incubation Medium (serum-<br>
free, sterile) was purchased from In Vitro Technologies (Baltimore, MD).<br>
133<br><br>
WO 2006/066080	PCT/US2005/045589<br>
The cynomolgus monkey hepatocyte suspension was prepared from fresh<br>
cynomolgus monkey hepatocytes in hepatocyte incubation medium at the<br>
concentration of 1.25 million cells/mL. The final incubation concentration (after test<br>
article addition) was 1.0 million cells/mL.<br>
Preparation of Stock Solutions<br>
Existing 100 mM stock solutions in DMSO were used. The concentrations<br>
of the test articles were checked using UV-vis microplate reader. Correction<br>
coefficients were determined using the absorbance of a freshly prepared DMSO<br>
stock of 122.<br>
Incubations<br>
Reaction suspensions were prepared in removable 96-well tubes, each<br>
containing 320 uL of fresh cynomolgus monkey hepatocyte suspension at the<br>
density of 1.25 million cells per mL and 40 uL of hepatocyte incubation medium.<br>
The above mixtures were pre-incubated open at 37 °C, 95% humidity and 5% CO2<br>
for 30 minutes. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 40 uL of test article at<br>
lOx concentration to each tube to achieve the final concentrations of 50 |xM for the<br>
test article(s) and 1 million/mL cell density. The reaction suspension in each tube<br>
was mixed by inverting the tube several times. Aliquots of 50 uL from each<br>
reaction suspension were distributed into six additional removable 96-well tubes<br>
(one tube per time point taken at 15,30,45,60,90, and 120 minutes). The open<br>
tubes were incubated at 37 °C under 95% humidity and 5% CO2.<br>
Preparation of Samples for Analysis<br>
At predetermined time points, reactions were terminated by the addition of<br>
150 L of the stop solution to each tube containing 50 uL of the reaction<br>
suspension. The composition of the stop solution was the following: 15 mL of<br>
acetonitrile (containing 1 g/mLnebularine as an internal standard and 0.1% formic<br>
acid) combined with 1 mL water.<br>
The calibration curves were prepared in the following way. To 80 uL of cell<br>
suspension (at the cell density of 1.25 million/mL) 10 uL of hepatocyte incubation<br>
medium and 10 uL of the appropriate concentration of the compound in hepatocyte<br>
incubation medium were added. Immediately following the compound addition, 300<br>
uL of the stop solution (see above) was added.<br>
134<br><br>
WO 2006/066080	PCT/US2005/045589<br>
All quenched samples were kept on wet ice until they were processed for<br>
analysis. Then they were mixed using a bench top Multi-Tube Vortexer (VWR<br>
Scientific Products) for approximately 30 seconds, and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm<br>
(3,220 rcf) for 10 minutes at 4°C. Clear supernatant (100 JJL) was transferred into a<br>
clean deep well 96-well plate, evaporated to dryness under nitrogen, reconstituted in<br>
100 pL of 90:10 water: acetonitrile, and analyzed for the parent form and metabolites<br>
of the test article using an appropriate LC/MS/MS method.<br>
Bioanalvsis<br>
The compounds were quantified on an AP13000 LC/MS/MS instrument in<br>
the ESI-Positive MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) mode. The summary of the<br>
results on Formula I prodrug degradation and product generation is given in Table 1.<br>

IFN-a Induction from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC)<br>
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are prepared by standard<br>
methods from human blood and are primarily comprised of monocytes, NK cells,<br>
circulating dendritic cells and both T and B cells. Briefly, they are purified by<br>
density gradient centrifugation from a buffy coat, which is the component of whole<br>
blood that contains leukocytes and platelets. In turn, buffy coats are prepared by<br>
centrifuging whole blood and isolating the thin cream colored layer between the<br>
upper plasma layer and the lower red blood cell portion of the separated mixture.<br>
PBMC Purification<br>
Freshly collected donor buffy coats were obtained from the San Diego<br>
Blood Bank. PBMCs were isolated from the buffy coats using histopaque-1077<br>
gradient (Sigma), essentially as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Buffy<br>
coats were transferred into 50 ml centrifuge tubes and PBS added to a total<br>
volume of 35 ml. Next 10 ml histopaque-1077 was underlayed at the bottom of<br>
each tube, which were then centrifuged at 259 x g for 30 minutes at room<br>
temperature without brake in a 5804 R centrifuge (Eppendorf). The top PBS<br>
level from each tube was removed and discarded and the buffy coat layer<br>
transferred to a fresh tube. The total volume was made up to 50 ml with PBS<br>
and the tubes were then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 259 x g at room<br>
temperature. The cells were washed an additional 3 times with PBS in this<br>
manner.<br>
The cell (PBMC) pellet was then resuspended in 30-40 ml complete<br>
(RPMI1640) media. PBMCs were seeded at either 2.5 or 7.5 x 106 cells/ml<br>
complete media (lx and 3x seedings, respectively) and allowed to rest overnight<br>
before compound exposure for 24 hours. The cells and media were then<br>
collected, centrifuged for 5 minutes at 735 x g in a 5415 C microfuge<br>
(Eppendorf) at room temperature and the supernatant analyzed by IFN-a ELISA.<br>
The ability of Formula I prodrugs, Formula II compounds, and other compounds<br>
of the invention to demonstrate favorable oral delivery characteristics and to<br>
induce immune responses when administered by a selected route can be<br>
compared with the results of similar experiments with compounds described in<br>
the literature. Hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties are U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 5,041,426 and 4,880,784, and U.S. Patent Application No.<br>

10/861,430 (U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2005/0070556), which<br>
disclose, inter alia, IFN-ot induction of isatoribine.<br><br>
Accordingly, relative activities of the compounds of the invention are<br>
expressed as a percentage of the level of IFN-cc induction by either 32 or 100<br>
uM isatoribine.<br>
ELISA Protocol<br>
Human IFN-a ELISA (#KHC4012) was performed as described in<br>
Biosource protocol. However, to ensure that readings were within the linear<br>
range of detection, PBMC supernatant samples were typically diluted 1:3 (2.5 x<br>
106 cells/ml seeding) or 1:15 (7.5 x 106 cells/ml seeding) and then analyzed<br>
together with undiluted supernatant samples. The concentration in each sample<br>
was calculated from the O.D. by reference to a standard curve.<br>
The compounds of the invention exhibited TFN-a induction from PBMCs<br>
relative to isatoribine in the following ranges:<br>
0-10%: Compounds 142,157,141,148, and 33<br>
11-50%: Compounds 152 and 165<br>
51-100%: Compounds 32,160,130, and 137<br>
&gt;100%: Compounds 133,34,147,121,122,134,117,132, and 153.<br>
Comparison to Isatoribine<br>
The results demonstrate the remarkable superiority of 134 and 122 to<br>
isatoribine with respect to enhancement of IFN-a production from human PBMCs in<br>
vitro. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show plots of pg/ml IFN-a induced in human PBMCs<br>
from compounds 134 and 122 vs pg/ml IFN-a induced by an identical concentration<br>
of isatoribine. The results may be summarized as follows.<br>
At IX PBMC seeding, both 134 and 122 induce significantly and<br>
substantially more EFN-a production at 100 uM test compound than does isatoribine,<br>
especially for weak responders to isatoribine (left panel on Figures 1 and 2). When<br>
seeding is increased to 3X, the difference between the amount of IFN-a produced at<br>
100 uM test agent is less clear-cut although visually apparent and statistically<br>
137<br><br><br>
WO 2006/066080	PCT/US2005/045589<br>
significant (right panel, Figures 1 and 2). When the concentration of both 134 and<br>
122 is 32 uM at 3X seeding, however, both 134 and 122 dramatically and<br>
unexpectedly outperform isatoribine (right panel and inserts of Figures 1 and 2).<br>
