DESIZING PROCESS<br>
REFERENCE TO A SEQUENCE LISTING<br>
This application contains a Sequence Listing in computer readable form. The computer readable form is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process of desizing sized fabrics during manufacture of especially new fabrics.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The processing of a fabric, such as of a cellulosic material, into material ready for garment manufacture involves several steps: spinning of the fiber into a yarn; construction of woven or knit fabric from the yarn; and subsequent preparation, dyeing and finishing operations. The preparation process, which may involve desizing (for woven goods), scouring, and bleaching, produces a fabric suitable for dyeing or finishing.<br>
Alkaline alpha-amylases are used as auxiliaries in desizing processes to facilitate the removal of starch-containing size which has served as a protective coating on yarns during weaving. Complete removal of the size coating after weaving is important to ensure optimum results in the subsequent processes in which the fabric is generally scoured, bleached, dyed and/or printed.<br>
After the desizing step it is often desirable to include a demineralization step in order to remove metal ions, such as Mn2+, Fe2+/Fe3+1 Cu2+etc, which - if present on the fabric - may result in an uneven bleaching in a later process step or might even make pin-holes in the bleached fabric. Demineralization is typically accomplished by acid precipitation and typically involves addition of acids such as acetic acid or sulphuric acid.<br>
It is desirable to provide improved processes for desizing of sized fabrics during manufacture of especially new fabrics.<br>
BRIEF DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed towards providing a process of desizing a sized fabric during manufacture of especially new fabrics.<br>
In the first aspect the invention relates to a process for desizing a sized fabric<br><br>
containing starch or starch derivatives during manufacture of a fabric, which process comprises incubating said sized fabric in an aqueous treating solution having a pH in the range between 1 and 5 which aqueous treating solution comprises an alpha-amylase.<br>
The present inventors have found that when carrying out a desizing process of the invention, as defined in the claims, no demineralization is needed. The demineralization takes place simultaneously and/or after the desizing of the sized fabric in the same treating solution. Compared to traditional processes involving an alkaline desizing step and a demineralization step a pH adjusting step is avoided. Another advantage of the invention is that process time is saved/reduced as desizing and demineralization may be carried out simultaneously. Even if the desizing and demineralization are not carried out as a one step process, i.e., simultaneously, costs of, e.g., acids and manpower for adding acid(s) are saved/reduced as the pH adjustment step between the traditional alkaline desizing step and the demineralization step is avoided.<br>
In context of the invention the term "fabric" is used interchangeable with the term "textile" and means, in contrast to "used" laundry fabric, newly manufactured, preferably undyed, fabrics, garments, fibres, yarns or other types of processed fabrics. Fabrics can be constructed from fibers by weaving, knitting or non-woven operations. Weaving and knitting require yarn as the input whereas the non-woven fabric is the result of random bonding of fibers (paper can be thought of as non-woven).<br>
Woven fabric is constructed by weaving "filling" or weft yarns between warp yarns stretched in the longitudinal direction on the loom. The wrap yarns must be sized before weaving in order to lubricate and protect them from abrasion at the high speed insertion of the filling yarns during weaving. The filling yarn can be woven through the warp yarns in a "over one - under the next" fashion (plain weave) or by "over one - under two" (twill) or any other myriad of permutations. Strength, texture and pattern are related not only to the type/quality of the yarn but also the type of weave. Generally, dresses, shirts, pants, sheeting's, towels, draperies, etc. are produced from woven fabric.<br>
Knitting is forming a fabric by joining together interlocking loops of yarn. As opposed to weaving, which is constructed from two types of yarn and has many "ends", knitted fabric is produced from a single continuous strand of yarn. As with weaving, there are many different ways to loop yarn together and the final fabric<br><br>
properties are dependent both upon the yarn and the type of knit. Underwear, sweaters, socks, sport shirts, sweat shirts, etc. are derived from knit fabrics.<br>
Non-woven fabrics are sheets of fabric made by bonding and/or interlocking fibers and filaments by mechanical, thermal, chemical or solvent mediated processes. The resultant fabric can be in the form of web-like structures, laminates or films. Typical examples are disposable baby diapers, towels, wipes, surgical gowns, fibers for the "environmental friendly" fashion, filter media, bedding, roofing materials, backing for two-dimensional fabrics and many others.<br>
According to the invention, the process may be applied to any sized fabric known in the art (woven, knitted, or non-woven). The process is applied to newly manufactured sized fabric, as opposed to used and/or soiled fabric to be cleaned during laundry washing. In an embodiment the fabric is made of fibres of natural and/or man-made origin. In another embodiment the fabric is made of fibres from animal origin. In particular, the process of the invention may be applied to cellulose-containing or cellulosic fabrics, such as cotton, viscose, rayon, ramie, linen, cellulose acetate, denim, lyocell (Tencelâ„¢, e.g., produced by Courtaulds Fibers), or mixtures thereof, or mixtures of any of these fibers together with synthetic fibres (e.g., polyester, polyamid, acrylic, or polyurethane, nylon, poly(ethylene terephthalate) or poly(lactic acid) or other natural fibers, such as wool and silk., such as viscose/cotton blends, lyocell/cotton blends, viscose/wool blends, lyocell/wool blends, cotton/wool blends; flax (linen), ramie and other fabrics based on cellulose fibers, including all blends of cellulosic fibers with other fibers such as wool, polyamide, acrylic and polyester fibers, e.g., viscose/cotton/polyester blends, wool/cotton/polyester blends, flax/cotton blends etc. The process may also be used on synthetic fabric, e.g., consisting of essentially 100% polyester, polyamid, nylon, respectively. The term "wool," means any commercially useful animal hair product, for example, wool from sheep, camel, rabbit, goat, lama, and known as merino wool, Shetland wool, cashmere wool, alpaca wool, mohair, etc. and includes wool fiber and animal hair. The process of the invention can be used with wool or animal hair material in the form of top, fiber, yarn, or woven or knitted fabric.<br>
The alpha-amylase used in accordance with the process of the invention may be any alpha-amylase, but is preferably of either bacterial or fungal origin. Preferably the alpha-amylase is an acid alpha-amylase, such as an acid alpha-amylase derived from a filamentous fungus, especially a strain of the genera Aspergillus, Rh/zomucor or Meripillus.<br><br>
The term "acid alpha-amylase" means an alpha-amylase (E.C. 3.2.1.1) which has an optimum activity at a pH in the range of 1 to 7, preferably from 1 to 5 at a temperature of 50Â°C.<br>
The term "desizing" is intended to be understood in a conventional manner, i.e., the degradation and/or removal of sizing agents from fabric, such as warp yarns in a woven fabric.<br>
The term "fabric containing starch or starch derivatives" is intended to indicate any type of fabric, in particular woven fabric prepared from a cellulose-containing material, containing starch or starch derivatives. The fabric is normally undyed and made of cotton, viscose, flax, and the like. The main part of the starch or starch derivatives present on the fabric is normally size with which the yarns, normally warp yarns, have been coated prior to weaving.<br>
The term "carbohydrate-binding module (CBM)", or as often referred to a "carbohydrate-binding domain (CBD)", is a polypeptide amino acid sequence which binds preferentially to a poly- or oligosaccharide (carbohydrate), frequently - but not necessarily exclusively - to a water-insoluble (including crystalline) form thereof.<br>
Even if not specifically mentioned in connection with the process of the invention, it is to be understood that the enzyme(s) or agent(s) is(are) used in an "effective amount". The term "effective amount" means an amount of, e.g., alpha-amylase that is capable of providing the desired effect, i.e., desizing of the fabric, as compared to a fabric which has not been treated with said enzyme(s).<br>

DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed towards providing a process of desizing a sized fabric during manufacture of especially new fabrics.<br>
The desizing step of the invention is in a preferred embodiment followed by a scouring step, preferable an enzymatic scouring step, preferably with a scouring enzyme such as a pectinase, e.g., a pectate lyase, a lipase, a protease, or combination thereof,  and a bleaching step,  preferably involving  bleaching with<br><br>
hydrogen peroxide and/or a hydrogen peroxide generating agent. Relevant scouring processes are described in US patent no. 5,578,489, US patent no. 5,912,407, and US patent no. 6,630,342. Relevant bleach processes are described in US patent no. 5,851,233, US patent no. 5,752,980, and US patent no. 5,928,380. Relevant combined scouring and bleach processes are described in WO 2003/002810 (Novozymes) and WO 2003/002705 (Novozymes), respectively.<br>
According to the present invention, fabric may be desized and demineralised simultaneously in the same aqueous treating solution or subsequently in the same or two separate treating solutions. In a preferred embodiment the desizing and demineralization are carried out simultaneously in the same treating solution. The process of the invention may be carried out using traditional sizing/desizing equipment, e.g., pad systems, J-boxes, jets, jiggers, etc. In general, no additional process equipment is needed.<br>
According to the invention simultaneous desizing and demineralisation are carried out by incubating sized fabric in an aqueous treating solution having a pH in the range between 1 and 5 which aqueous treating solution comprises an alpha-amylase. In a preferred embodiment the pH during incubation is in the range between 1 and 4, especially between pH 2 and 4.<br>
Woven goods are the prevalent form of fabric construction. The weaving process demands a "sizing" of the warp yarn to protect it from abrasion. Starches, unmodified and modified, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC), waxes and acrylic binders, and mixtures thereof, are examples of typically used sizing agents. The sizing agent may according to the invention be a starch-based or starch derivative-based sizing agent, but may also contain one or more non-starch or starch derivative-based sizing agents. The sizing agent(s) are in general removed after the weaving process as the first step in preparing the woven goods.<br>
One or more other agents including stabilizers, surfactants, wetting agents, dispersing agent, sequestering agents and emulsifying agents, or mixtures thereof, may be present during a desizing process of the invention. The sized fabric is allowed to incubate in the aqueous treating solution for a sufficiently long period of time to accomplish desizing of the sized fabric. The optimal period is dependent upon the type of processing regime and the temperature and can vary from about 15 minutes to several days, e.g., 48 hours. A process of the invention is preferably carried out at a temperature in the range from 5 to 90Â°C, in particular 20 to 90Â°C dependent on the processing regime.<br><br>
The processing regime can be either batch or continuous with the fabric being contacted by the aqueous treating stream in open width or rope form.<br>
Continuous operations may use a saturator whereby an approximate equal weight of treating solution per weight of fabric is applied to the fabric, followed by a heated dwell chamber where the chemical reaction takes place. A washing section then prepares the fabric for the next processing step. In order to ensure a high whiteness or a good wettability and resulting dyeability, the desizing enzyme(s) and other agents must be thoroughly removed.<br>
Batch processes may take place in one bath (treating solution) whereby the fabric is contacted with, e.g., approximately 8-15 times its weight of aqueous treating solution. After an incubation period, the aqueous treating solution is drained, the fabric is rinsed, and the next processing step is initiated. Discontinuous PB-processes (i.e., pad-batch processes) involves a saturator whereby an approximate equal weight of aqueous treating solution per weight of fabric is applied to the fabric, followed by a dwell period, which in the case of CPB-process (i.e., cold pad-batch process) might be one or more days. For instance, a CPB-process may be carried out at between 20-40Â°C for 8-24 hours or more at a pH in the range between 1 and 5, preferably at a pH in the range between around 1 and 4, especially between pH 2 and 4. Further, a PB-process may be carried out at between 40-90Â°C for 1-6 hours at a pH in the range between around 1 and 5, preferably between around pH 1 and 4, especially between pH 2 and 4.<br>
In one embodiment the desizing process of the invention may be carried out using an effective amount of alpha-amylase, preferably acid alpha-amylase, and an acid such as acetic acid or sulphuric acid or the like.<br>
Detergents<br>
In the context of this invention, a detergent is synonymous with a surfactant, and it may in particular be a non-ionic surfactant, an anionic surfactant, a cationic surfactant, an ampholytic surfactant, a zwitterionic surfactant, and a semi-polar surfactant, or a mixture hereof.<br>
The surfactant is typically present in a composition of the invention at a level from 0.1% to 60% by weight.<br>
The surfactant is preferably formulated to be compatible with enzyme components present. In liquid or gel compositions the surfactant is most preferably formulated in such a way that it promotes, or at least does not degrade, the stability<br><br>
of any enzyme in these compositions.<br>
Preferred systems to be used according to the present invention comprise as a surfactant one or more of the non-ionic and/or anionic surfactants described herein.<br>
Polyethylene, polypropylene, and polybutylene oxide condensates of alkyl phenols are suitable for use as the non-ionic surfactant of the surfactant systems of the present invention, with the polyethylene oxide condensates being preferred. These compounds include the condensation products of alkyl phenols having an alkyl group containing from about 6 to about 14 carbon atoms, preferably from about 8 to about 14 carbon atoms, in either a straight chain or branched-chain configuration with the alkylene oxide. In a preferred embodiment, the ethylene oxide is present in an amount equal to from about 2 to about 25 moles, more preferably from about 3 to about 15 moles, of ethylene oxide per mole of alkyl phenol.<br>
Commercially available non-ionic surfactants of this type include Igepalâ„¢ CO-630, marketed by the GAF Corporation; and TRITONâ„¢ X-45, X-114, X-100 and X-102, all marketed by the Rohm &amp; Haas Company. These surfactants are commonly referred to as alkylphenol alkoxylates (e.g., alkyl phenol ethoxylates).<br>
The condensation products of primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols with about 1 to about 25 moles of ethylene oxide are suitable for use as the nonionic surfactant of the non-ionic surfactant system. The alkyl chain of the aliphatic alcohol can either be straight or branched, primary or secondary, and generally contains from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms. Preferred are the condensation products of alcohols having an alkyl group containing from about 8 to about 20 carbon atoms, more preferably from about 10 to about 18 carbon atoms, with from about 2 to about 10 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol. About 2 to about 7 moles of ethylene oxide and most preferably from 2 to 5 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol are present in said condensation products. Examples of commercially available non-ionic surfactants of this type include TERGITOLâ„¢ 15-S-9 (The condensation product of CirC15 linear alcohol with 9 moles ethylene oxide), TERGITOLâ„¢ 24-L-6 NMW (the condensation product of C12-C14 primary alcohol with 6 moles ethylene oxide with a narrow molecular weight distribution), both marketed by Union Carbide Corporation; NEODOLâ„¢ 45-9 (the condensation product of C14-C15 linear alcohol with 9 moles of ethylene oxide), NEODOLâ„¢ 23-3 (the condensation product of C12-C13 linear alcohol with 3.0 moles of ethylene oxide), NEODOLâ„¢ 45-7 (the condensation product of C14-C15 linear alcohol with 7 moles of ethylene oxide), NEODOLâ„¢ 45-5 (the condensation product of C14-C15 linear alcohol with 5 moles of ethylene oxide) marketed by Shell<br><br>
Chemical Company, KYROâ„¢ EOB (the condensation product of C13-C15 alcohol with 9 moles ethylene oxide), marketed by The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, and Genapol LA 050 (the condensation product of C12-C14 alcohol with 5 moles of ethylene oxide) marketed by Hoechst. Preferred range of HLB in these products is from 8-11 and most preferred from 8-10.<br>
Also useful as the nonionic surfactant of the surfactant system are alkylpolysaccharides disclosed in US 4,565,647, having a hydrophobic group containing from about 6 to about 30 carbon atoms, preferably from about 10 to about 16 carbon atoms and a polysaccharide, e.g., a polyglycoside, hydrophilic group containing from about 1.3 to about 10, preferably from about 1.3 to about 3, most preferably from about 1.3 to about 2.7 saccharide units. Any reducing saccharide containing 5 or 6 carbon atoms can be used, e.g., glucose, galactose and galactosyl moieties can be substituted for the glucosyl moieties (optionally the hydrophobic group is attached at the 2-, 3-, 4-, etc. positions thus giving a glucose or galactose as opposed to a glucoside or galactoside). The intersaccharide bonds can be, e.g., between the one position of the additional saccharide units and the 2-, 3-, 4-, and/or 6- positions on the preceding saccharide units.<br>
The preferred alkylpolyglycosides have the formula<br>
R20(CnH2nO)t(glycosyl)x wherein R2 is selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkylphenyl, hydroxyalkyl, hydroxyalkylphenyl, and mixtures thereof in which the alkyl groups contain from about 10 to about 18, preferably from about 12 to about 14, carbon atoms; n is 2 or 3, preferably 2; t is from 0 to about 10, preferably 0; and x is from about 1.3 to about 10, preferably from about 1.3 to about 3, most preferably from about 1.3 to about 2.7. The glycosyl is preferably derived from glucose. To prepare these compounds, the alcohol or alkylpolyethoxy alcohol is formed first and then reacted with glucose, or a source of glucose, to form the glucoside (attachment at the 1-position). The additional glycosyl units can then be attached between their 1-position and the preceding glycosyl units 2-, 3-, 4-, and/or 6-position, preferably predominantly the 2-position.<br>
The condensation products of ethylene oxide with a hydrophobic base formed by the condensation of propylene oxide with propylene glycol are also suitable for use as the additional non-ionic surfactant system. The hydrophobic portion of these compounds will preferably have a molecular weight from about 1500 to about 1800 and will exhibit water insolubility. The addition of polyoxyethylene moieties to this<br><br>
hydrophobic portion tends to increase the water solubility of the molecule as a whole, and the liquid character of the product is retained up to the point where the polyoxyethylene content is about 50% of the total weight of the condensation product, which corresponds to condensation with up to about 40 moles of ethylene oxide. Examples of compounds of this type include certain of the commercially available PLURONICâ„¢ surfactants, marketed by BASF.<br>
Also suitable for use as the non-ionic surfactant of the non-ionic surfactant system are the condensation products of ethylene oxide with the product resulting from the reaction of propylene oxide and ethylenediamine. The hydrophobic moiety of these products consists of the reaction product of ethylenediamine and excess propylene oxide, and generally has a molecular weight of from about 2,500 to about 3,000. This hydrophobic moiety is condensed with ethylene oxide to the extent that the condensation product contains from about 40% to about 80% by weight of polyoxyethylene and has a molecular weight of from about 5,000 to about 11,000. Examples of this type of non-ionic surfactant include certain of the commercially available TETRONICâ„¢ compounds, marketed by BASF.<br>
Preferred for use as the non-ionic surfactant of the surfactant system are polyethylene oxide condensates of alkyl phenols, condensation products of primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols with from about 1 to about 25 moles of ethyfeneoxide, alkylpolysaccharides, and mixtures hereof. Most preferred are C8-C14 alkyl phenol ethoxylates having from 3 to 15 ethoxy groups and C8-C18 alcohol ethoxylates (preferably C10 avg.) having from 2 to 10 ethoxy groups, and mixtures thereof.<br>

Hybrid enzyme<br>
The alpha-amylase may in a preferred embodiment be an alpha-amylase<br>
comprising a carbohydrate-binding domain (CBD). Such alpha-amylase with a CBD may be a wild type enzyme (see e.g., Aspergillus kawachii above) or a hybrid enzyme (fusion protein) as will be described further below. Hybrid enzymes or a genetically modified wild type enzymes as referred to herein include species comprising an amino acid sequence of an alpha-amylase enzyme (EC 3.2.1.1) linked (i.e. covalently bound) to an amino acid sequence comprising a carbohydrate-binding domain (CBD).<br><br>
CBD-containing hybrid enzymes, as well as detailed descriptions of the preparation and purification thereof, are known in the art [see, e.g. WO 90/00609, WO 94/24158 and WO 95/16782, as well as Greenwood et al. Biotechnology and Bioengineering 44 (1994) pp. 1295-1305]. They may, e.g., be prepared by transforming into a host cell a DNA construct comprising at least a fragment of DNA encoding the carbohydrate-binding domain ligated, with or without a linker, to a DNA sequence encoding the enzyme of interest, and growing the transformed host cell to express the fused gene. The resulting recombinant product (hybrid enzyme) - often referred to in the art as a "fusion protein - may be described by the following general formula:<br>
A-CBD-MR-X<br>
In the latter formula, A-CBD is the N-terminal or the C-terminal region of an amino acid sequence comprising at least the carbohydrate-binding domain (CBD) per se. MR is the middle region (the "linker"), and X is the sequence of amino acid residues of a polypeptide encoded by a DNA sequence encoding the enzyme (or other protein) to which the CBD is to be linked.<br>
The moiety A may either be absent (such that A-CBD is a CBD per se, i.e. comprises no amino acid residues other than those constituting the CBD) or may be a sequence of one or more amino acid residues (functioning as a terminal extension of the CBD per se). The linker (MR) may be a bond, or a short linking group comprising from about 2 to about 100 carbon atoms, in particular of from 2 to 40 carbon atoms. However, MR is preferably a sequence of from about 2 to about 100 amino acid residues, more preferably of from 2 to 40 amino acid residues, such as from 2 to 15 amino acid residues.<br>
The moiety X may constitute either the N-terminal or the C-terminal region of the overall hybrid enzyme.<br>
It will thus be apparent from the above that the CBD in a hybrid enzyme of the type in question may be positioned C-terminally, N-terminally or internally in the hybrid enzyme.<br>
Linker sequence<br>
The linker sequence may be any suitable linker sequence. In preferred embodiments the linker sequence is derived from the Athelia rolfsii glucoamylase, the A.niger glucoamylase, the A. kawachii alpha-amylase such as a linker sequence selected from the group consisting of A. niger glucoamylase linker: TGGTTTTATPTGSGSVTSTSKTTATASKTSTSTSSTSA    (SEQ     ID     NO:22),    A.<br><br>
kawachii alpha-amylase linker: TTTTTTAAATSTSKATTSSSSSSAAA T T S S S (SEQ ID NO:23), Athelia rolfsii glucoamylase linker: GATSPGGSSG S (SEQ ID NO:24), and the PEPT linker: PEPTPEPT (SEQ ID NO:25). In another preferred embodiment the hybrid enzymes has a linker sequence which differs from the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:22, SEQ ID NO:23, SEQ ID NO:24, or SEQ ID NO:25 in no more than 10 positions, no more than 9 positions, no more than 8 positions, no more than 7 positions, no more than 6 positions, no more than 5 positions, no more than 4 positions, no more than 3 positions, no more than 2 positions, or even no more than 1 position.<br>
Carbohydrate-binding domain<br>
A carbohydrate-binding domains (CBD), or as often referred to, a carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM), is a polypeptide amino acid sequence which binds preferentially to a poly- or oligosaccharide (carbohydrate), frequently - but not necessarily exclusively - to a water-insoluble (including crystalline) form thereof.<br>
CBDs derived from starch degrading enzymes are often referred to as starch-binding domains (SBD) or starch-binding modules (SBM). SBDs are CBDs which may occur in certain amylolytic enzymes, such as certain glucoamylases, or in enzymes such as cyclodextrin glucanotransferases, or in alpha-amylases. Likewise, other sub-classes of CBDs would embrace, e.g. cellulose-binding domains (CBDs from cellulolytic enzymes), chitin-binding domains (CBDs which typically occur in chitinases), xylan-binding domains (CBDs which typically occur in xylanases), mannan-binding domains (CBDs which typically occur in mannanases).<br>
CBDs are found as integral parts of large polypeptides or proteins consisting of two or more polypeptide amino acid sequence regions, especially in hydrolytic enzymes (hydrolases) which typically comprise a catalytic domain containing the active site for substrate hydrolysis and a carbohydrate-binding domain (CBD) for binding to the carbohydrate substrate in question. Such enzymes can comprise more than one catalytic domain and one, two or three CBDs, and optionally further comprise one or more polypeptide amino acid sequence regions linking the CBD(s) with the catalytic domain(s), a region of the latter type usually being denoted a "linker". Examples of hydrolytic enzymes comprising a CBD - some of which have already   been   mentioned   above   -   are   cellulases,   xylanases,   mannanases,<br>
arabinofuranosidases, acetylesterases and chitinases. CBDs have also been found in<br>
Â«<br>
algae, e.g., in the red alga Porphyra purpurea in the form of a non-hydrolytic polysaccharide-binding protein.<br>
In   proteins/polypeptides   in  which   CBDs  occur  (e.g.   enzymes,   typically hydrolytic enzymes), a CBD may be located at the N or C terminus or at an internal<br><br>
position.<br>
That part of a polypeptide or protein (e.g. hydrolytic enzyme) which constitutes a CBD per se typically consists of more than about 30 and less than about 250 amino acid residues.<br>
The "Carbohydrate-Binding Module of Family 20" or a CBM-20 module is in the context of this invention defined as a sequence of approximately 100 amino acids having at least 45% homology to the Carbohydrate-Binding Module (CBM) of the polypeptide disclosed in figure 1 by Joergensen et al (1997) in Biotechnol. Lett. 19:1027-1031. The CBM comprises the last 102 amino acids of the polypeptide, i.e. the subsequence from amino acid 582 to amino acid 683. The numbering of Glycoside Hydrolase Families applied in this disclosure follows the concept of Coutinho, P.M. &amp; Henrissat, B. (1999) CAZy - Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes server at URL: http://afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/-cazy/CAZY/index.html or alternatively Coutinho, P.M. &amp; Henrissat, B. 1999; The modular structure of cellulases and other carbohydrate-active enzymes: an integrated database approach.

Buffer<br>
Citrate Buffer<br>
10mM Citrate buffer (pH4.0)<br>
1.376 g of Citric acid monohydrate and 1.015 g of Sodium Citrate dihydrate are<br>
dissolved in 1 L of de-ionized water.<br>
Methods:<br>
Determination of homology/identity<br>
For purposes of the present invention, the degree of homology is determined as the degree of identity between two amino acid sequences as determined by the Clustal method (Higgins, 1989, CABIOS 5: 151-153) using the LASERGENEâ„¢ MEGALIGNâ„¢ software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, Wl) with an identity table and the following multiple alignment parameters: Gap penalty of 10, and gap length penalty of 10. Pairwise alignment parameters were Ktuple=1, gap penalty=3, windows=5, and diago-nals=5].<br>
Acid alpha-amylase activity (AFAU Assay)<br>
When used according to the present invention the activity of any acid alpha-amylase may be measured in AFAU (Acid Fungal Alpha-amylase Units), which are determined relative to an enzyme standard. 1 FAU is defined as the amount of enzyme which degrades 5.260 mg starch dry matter per hour under the below mentioned standard conditions.<br>
Acid alpha-amylase, an endo-alpha-amylase (1,4-alpha-D-glucan-glucano-hydrolase, E.C. 3.2.1.1) hydrolyzes alpha-1,4-glucosidic bonds in the inner regions of the starch molecule to form dextrins and oligosaccharides with different chain lengths. The intensity of color formed with iodine is directly proportional to the concentration of starch. Amylase activity is determined using reverse colorimetry as a reduction in the concentration of starch under the specified analytical conditions.<br><br><br>
Alpha-amylase activity (KNU)<br>
The amylolytic activity may be determined using potato starch as substrate. This method is based on the break-down of modified potato starch by the enzyme, and the reaction is followed by mixing samples of the starch/enzyme solution with an iodine solution. Initially, a blackish-blue color is formed, but during the break-down of the starch the blue color gets weaker and gradually turns into a reddish-brown, which is compared to a colored glass standard.<br>
One Kilo Novo alpha amylase Unit (KNU) is defined as the amount of enzyme which, under standard conditions (i.e. at 37Â°C +/- 0.05; 0.0003 M Ca2+; and pH 5.6) dextrinizes 5260 mg starch dry substance Merck Amylum solubile.<br>
A folder EB-SM-0009.02/01 describing this analytical method in more detail is available upon request to Novozymes A/S, Denmark, which folder is hereby included by reference.<br>
Determination of Acid Amylolytic Activity (FAU)<br><br>
One Fungal Alpha-Amylase Unit (1 FAU) is defined as the amount of enzyme, which breaks down 5.26 g starch (Merck Amylum solubile Erg. B.6, Batch 9947275) per hour at Novozymes' standard method for determination of alpha-amylase based upon the following standard conditions:<br>
Substrate	Soluble starch<br>
Temperature	37Â°C<br>
pH	4.7<br>
Reaction time	7-20 minutes<br>
A detailed description of Novozymes' method for determining KNU and FAU is available on request as standard method EB-SM-0009.02/01.<br>
Desizing (Tegewa method)<br>
The starch size residue is determined visually by comparing an iodine stained fabric swatch to a standard set of photos with 1-9 scale where 1 is dark blue and 9 has no color stain. The iodine stain solution is made by dissolving 10 g Kl in 10 ml water, add 0.635g l2, and 200mL ethanol in deionized water to make total 1L solution. A fabric sample is cut and immersed in the iodine solution for 60 seconds and rinsed in deionized water for about 5 seconds. The fabric sample is rated by at least two professionals after excess water in the sample is pressed out. An average number is given. Method and standard scales obtainable from Verband TEGEWA, Karlstrasse 21, Frankfurt a.M., Germany.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
Desizing cotton fabric with wild-type acid Alpha-Amylase A<br>
A 100% cotton fabric (270g/m2) was from Boras Wafveri Kungsfors AB, Sweden. It was made in 2003 with Cupper 3/1 construction. The fabric contained 28 thread/cm warp yarn and 14 thread/cm weft yarn. The warp yarn has Ne 11 and the weft has Ne 8. Both yarns were open end. The dry size pick up on the warp yarn was 8%. The size contained mainly Kollotex 5, Solvitose XO, and beef tallow wax with emulsifier. Kollotex 5 is a low viscous potato starch ester. Solvitose XO is a high viscous starch ether with DS about 0.07.    Fabric swatches were cut to about<br><br>
25g each.<br>
Three buffers were made for this study. Buffer pH2 was made by dissolving 11.53g 85% phosphoric acid in 4.5 liter pure water, titrating with 5N HCI to pH 1.95, then adding water to 5 liter. Buffer pH3 was made by dissolving 11.53g 85% phosphoric acid in 4.5 liter pure water, titrating with 5N NaOH to pH 2.95, then adding water to 10 liter. Buffer pH4 was made by dissolving 6.005g acetic acid in 4.5 liter pure water, titrating with 5N HCI to pH 3.95, then adding water to 10 liter. A 2g/l nonionic surfactant (wetting agent) was added in each buffer. The measured final pH values of these three buffers were 2, 2.99, and 3.98, respectively.<br>
For each treatment, a 1 liter buffer solution was taken. A given amount of wild type Acid Alpha-Amylase A was added in the buffer. A fabric swatch was immersed in the solution for 30 seconds and then padded through a padder (Werner Mathis) to achieve 85% wet pickup. The fabric swatch was rolled and sealed in a plastic bag. It was then incubated at 50Â°C oven for 2 hours. The fabric swatch was washed in a pad-steam range (Werner Mathis) which contained four small rinsing boxes. The water temperature in rinsing boxes is 95, 95, 90, and 90Â°C, respectively.<br>
After drying overnight in air, the fabric swatch was stained with an iodine solution. The stained fabric sample was visually compared to TEGEWA standard photos with 1-9 scale where 1 is dark and 9 has no color stain. Thus higher number indicates a better starch removal. The visual evaluation was done by at least three professionals and an average TEGEWA value was given for each fabric sample. The results are shown in Table 1. The wild type acid Alpha-Amylase A treated fabric gave higher TEGEWA value than the fabric treated with no enzyme control at all three pH conditions, indicating that acid Alpha-Amylase A hydrolyzed and removed starch size on fabric. Increased enzyme activity resulted in higher TEGEWA indicating increased starch removal.<br>
Example 2<br>
Desizing cotton fabric with Acid Alpha-Amylase B<br>
The same fabric swatch and buffers were prepared as in Example 1. Acid Alpha-Amylase B was different from the wild-type Acid Alpha-Amylase A used in Example 1 in that the enzyme protein was constructed to comprise the wild-type Acid Alpha-Amylase A from A niger (Example 1) linked with a CBD from Aspergillus kawachii acid alpha-amylase. The enzyme used in this study has an activity of 316 AFAU/g. The same treatments and measurements were conducted as in Example 1.<br><br><br><br>
swatch was sequentially washed with water in the same beaker three times at 95, 75, and 40Â°C, respectively.<br>
After dry overnight in air, the swatch was evaluated the same way as in Example 1. The results are shown in Table 2. The same conclusions in Example 1 can be drawn. A TEGEWA value of above 5 was achieved in lab equipment, indicating desizing at acidic condition is viable approach.<br>
The residue of metal ions on fabric was also evaluated. The fabric was first cut through 1 mm sieve with a Thomas-Wiley mill. Fabric mash 4.00 (+/-0.01) g was mixed with 80 mL 1g/L EDTA solution. The mixture was incubated at 70Â°C and 200 ' rpm in a shaker (new Brunswick Scientific Co. Inc, Series 25) for 15 hours. After cooled down for about 30 minutes, the mixture was centrifuged at 2500 rpm at 20Â°C for 10 minutes. The supernatant was collected for metal content analysis with a Perkinelmer atomic absorption spectrophometer.<br><br><br>
n/a = not measured<br>
Example 5<br>
The same type of fabric from Boras Wafveri Kungsfors AB (Sweden) as in Example 1 was used and the swatch was cut to about 62g each. Buffer pH4 was made by dissolving 12.01g acetic acid in 4.5 liter pure water, titrating with 5N HCI to pH 3.95, then adding water to 10 liter. A 2g/l nonionic surfactant (wetting agent) was added the buffer. The final pH value of the buffer was 3.99.<br>
For each treatment, a 1.2 liter buffer solution was taken. A given amount of alpha-amylase enzyme was added in the buffer. A fabric swatch was immersed in the solution for 30 seconds and then padded through a padder (Werner Mathis) to achieve 90% wet pickup. The fabric swatch was cut into two equal size swatches. Both were rolled and sealed in plastic bags. One bag was incubated at 40Â°C oven and the other at room temperature (20Â°C). Both swatches were treated for 16 hours. The fabric swatch was washed in a pad-steam range (Werner Mathis) which contained four small rinsing boxes. The water temperature in rinsing boxes is 95, 95, 90. and 90Â°C. resoectivelv.<br><br>
Example 6<br>
Alpha-Amylase D for desizing fabric at pH 4.0<br>
De-ionized water was filled into beakers, up to 13 cm from the bottom. The water temperature was adjusted to 60Â°C. 200 ml of 10 mM Citrate buffer (pH 4.0) was added to each beaker and placed in a Lab-o-Mat. The solutions were heated to 60Â°C. Different amounts of Alpha-Amylase D were added to the buffer. The final enzyme concentrations were 50FAU/L, 100FAU/L, 200FAU/L and 400FAU/L, respectively. Two swatches of Vlisco fabric were fixed in a pair of forceps and dipped in the impregnation bath for 30 seconds and then padded. The dipping and squeezing was repeated. The wet pick up was about 100%.<br>
One swatch was placed in a two-layer plastic bag, the air was squeezed out and the bag was placed in water bath at 60Â°C for 2 hours. The other swatch was placed in a two-layer plastic bag, the air was squeezed out, and the bag was kept at room temperature for 24 hours. The samples were removed from the water bath after the required time was reached. The samples were fixed in the forceps, dipped in a hot rinse solution (90Â°C) for 30 seconds and squeezed. The dipping and squeezing was repeated twice.<br>
The fabric was dipped in cold tap water for around 60 seconds and water was squeezed off with hands. The swatches were placed on a shelf and dried at room temperature. The residual starch content on the fabric was checked by TEGEWA rating. The result of the tests is shown in Fig. 1<br>
Example 7<br>
Alpha-Amylase C desizing at pH 4,Q<br>
The desizing procedure described in Example 6 was repeated, except that Alpha-Amylase C was used. The result of the tests is shown in Fig. 2.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
