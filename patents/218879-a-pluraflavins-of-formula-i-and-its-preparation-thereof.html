Pluraflavins and derivatives tinereof, process for their preparation and use thereof. The present invention relates to novel compounds of formula I<br><br>
wherein R^, Rj, R3, R4, R5, Rg, Re, Rioand n are as defined below. The compounds of formula I inhibit transcriptase, have a cytostatic action and are particularly suitable for treating tumors. The compounds of formula I can be obtained by growing Actinomycetales species HAG 003959, DSM 12931, in a culture medium. Accordingly, the invention relates to a process for preparing the compounds of formula 1, the use of the compounds for preparing a pharmaceutical for the treatment of malignant disorders and of diseases which can be treated by inhibiting transcriptase, and to phannaceutical preparations comprising at least one compound of formula I.<br>
Cancer is a disease of humans and animals which is in most cases fatal and which is generally caused by the uncontrolled growth of endogenous cells. Cancer is the term used for the formation of malignant tumors (malignancy), of neoplasms (tumors or carcinomas) or for the malignant degeneration and dysmaturity of white blood cells (leukemia). Cancer or tumor cells are generally fonned by transformation of endogenous ceils. The malignancy of the cancer cell expresses itself in the autonomy of growth, i.e. its capability of growing uninhibitedly and without integration into the organ system and infiltrating, with destruction of tissue. A sure sign of malignancy is the formation of metastases far from the tumor after hematogenic or lymphogenic spreading of tumor cells. Cancer is one of the most frequent causes 0I death in humans, and there is therefore a great demand for methods and agents for curing or treating malignant degenerations.<br><br>
In addition to tine radical approach of surgical removal of the tumor, the options for therapy of malignant tumors include radiotherapy with X-rays, a-, p-, y-rays, immunotherapy and chemotherapy. As yet, the use of immunotherapy is limited. Chemotherapy of tumors is understood as meaning administration of cell toxins (cytostatics) for the treatment of tumors and remaining tumor cells generally after local surgical treatment or irradiation. These substances intervene specifically in certain processes of cell division, so that tissues having a high proportion of dividing cells, such as the rapidly growing tumor tissue, react sensitively. The agents used are alkylating compounds, such as, for example, cyclophosphamide (The Merck Index, 12th Ed. page 463), antimetabolites, such as methotrexate (The Merck Index, 12th Ed. page 1025), alkaloids, such as vincristine (The Merck Index, 12th Ed. page 1704) and antibiotics, such as daunomycin (The Merck index, 12th Ed. page 479), and adriamycin (The Merck Index, 12th Ed. pages 581-582). However, owing to massive side-effects, all these agents have significant disadvantages, so that the death of the diseased person can. In many cases, only be delayed, but not prevented. Furthermore, degenerated (cancer) cells become resistant to the agents used; in this case, the conventional pharmaceuticals no longer have any cytostatic action, but they are toxic, owing to the side-effects. Furthermore, It has been found that a combined and/or sequential use of cytostatics exceeds the activity of an individual cytostatic (monotherapy), and it is therefore possible that the considerable side-effects In polychemotherapy are non-additive. For all these reasons, novel chemotherapeutics are urgently required and thus investigated world-wide.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that the microorganism strain Actinomycetales species HAG 003959, DSM 12931, is capable of producing highly effective novel cytostatics which inhibit ceil growth even at very low concentrations. Hereinbelow, the novel compounds are referred to as pluraflavlns, and they forni, together with pluraflavin derivatives, part of the subject matter of the invention. The pluraflavlns are antibiotics which comprise a p-quinoid ring skeleton and various sugar building blocks. They inhibit transcription by intercalation of nucleic acid double strands and, If appropriate, additional alkylation. The ring skeleton was described for the first time by<br><br>
S. Kondo et al. in Journal of Antibiotics, volume 30, pages 1143-1145, 1977, as a part of piuramycin. Later, this ring skeleton was found in a plurality of antibiotics; in addition to piuramycin and neopluramycin, the compounds saptomycines (N. Abe et al. J. Antibiotics, 46, 1536-1549,1993), ankinomycin (Y. Sato et al. J. Antibiotics 42, 149, 1989), kidamycin (N. Kanda etal. J. Antibiotics, 24, 599, 1971), hedamycin (U. Sequ'n et al. Tetrahedron, 34, 761, 1978) and the altromycines (G. M. Brill et al. J. Antibiotics, 43, 229-237, 1990) have been described as structurally related compounds. The prior art substances often have disadvantages which manifest themselves in an unsatisfactory efficacy, high toxicity and/or undesirable side-effects.<br>

The invention furthermore relates to: a compound of formula (IVA)<br><br><br><br><br>
in all their stereochemical forms and mixtures of these forms in any ratio, and their physiologically acceptable salts.<br>
Hereinbelow, the invention is described in detail, for example in at least one embodiment.<br>
The pluraflavins according to the invention are produced by Actinomycetales species, in one embodinient by Actinomycetales spec HAG 003959, DSM 12931. The Actinomycetales species HAG 003959, DSM 12931, has a beige-red mycelium and can be identified by conidiophores which are typical for actinomycetes.<br>
A taxonomic examination of the microorganism Actinomycetales spec HAG 003959, DSM 12931, gave the following result of the determination of the strain: the diagnostically important fatty acid analysis by gas chromatography showed high proportions of: Anteiso 15:0 fatty acid, Iso 16:0 fatty acid (isopalmitic acid), Iso 17:0 fatty acid (isomargaric acid), Anteiso 17:0 fatty acid (anteisomargaric acid) and<br>
cis[9] 18:1 fatty acid (oleic acid), in addition to lower concentrations of other fatty acids.<br><br>
This fatty acid composition profile permits Actinomycetales HAG 003959 (DSM 12931) to be assigned taxonomically to the genus Saccharothrix.<br>
An isolate of the microorganism was deposited at the Deutschen Sammlung von Mil<roorganismen und zellkulturen gmbh mascheroder weg d braunschweig germany according to the rules of budapest convention on july under following number: actinomycetales species hag dsm></roorganismen>
Instead of the strain Actinomycetales species HAG 003959, DSM 12931, it is also possible to use its mutants and variants which synthesize at least one compound of the pluraflavins according to the invention. Such mutants can be produced in a manner known per se by physical means, for example irradiation, e.g. with ultraviolet or X-rays, or chemical mutagens, such as, for example, ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), 2-hydroxy-4-methoxyben2ophenone (MOB) or N-methyi-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG).<br>
The process according to the invention can be used for fermentation on a aboratory scale (milliliter to liter range) or on an industrial scale (cubic meter scale). Unless indicated othenwise, all percentages are based on weight. In the case of iquids, mixing ratios are based on the volume, unless stated otherwise.<br>
In one embodiment, sources of carbon atoms for aerobic fermentation are assimilable carbohydrates and sugar alcohols, such as glucose, lactose, sucrose or D-mannitol, and hydrocarbon-comprising natural products, such as, for example, malt Bxtract. Suitable sources of nitrogen atoms for cultivation are: amino acids, peptides and proteins and their degradation products, such as peptones or tryptones, •urthermore meat extracts, yeast extracts, ground seeds, for example of maize, wheat. Deans, soya or cotton, distillation residues of alcohol production, meat meals or yeast sxtracts, but also ammonium salts and nitrates. Inorganic salts contained in the lutrient solution can, for example, be chlorides, carbonates, sulfates or phosphates of he alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, iron, zinc, cobalt and manganese.<br>
The formation of the pluraflavins according to the invention proceeds in a culture medium which comprises about.0.1 to 5%, such as 0.3 to 2%, of glucose and<br><br>
0.2 to 5%, such as 0.5 to 3%, of soya meal and 0.05 to 2%, such as 0.2 to 1.0 g/l of corn steep and 0.05 to 1.0 g/l, such as 0.1 to 0.5%, of calcium carbonate and 0.05 to 1.0 g/l, such as 0.1 to 1.0 g/l, of sodium chloride. The percentages are in each case based on the weight of the entire culture medium.<br>
5	In the culture medium, Actinomycetales species HAG 003959, DSM 12931,<br>
produces a mixture of pluraflavins. Depending on the composition of the culture medium, the proportion of at least one of the pluraflavins according to the invention may vary. Furthermore, via the composition of the medium, it is possible to control the synthesis of individual pluraflavins, so that one or even more of the pluraflavins are not<br>
) produced at all by the microorganism, or in an amount below the detection limit.<br>
In one embodiment, the culture comprises one detectable pluraflavin. In further embodiments the pluraflavins A, B or E are fonned.<br>
In addition to the pluraflavins A, B and E (compounds of formula (lA), (IB) and (IE), respectively), other related compounds, which differ from the compounds<br>
1 represented in the formulae (lA), (IB) and (IE) in that they are glycosylated differently, are also formed in the culture medium of Actinomycetales species HAG 003959, DSM 12931. Thus, as by-product, a further pluraflavin (pluraflavin C) with a molecular weight of 974 Da and a degradation product of pluraflavin A, molecular weight 692.77, C37H44N2O11, were detected. In the latter compound, hexose I is missing; under acidic<br>
I conditions, the 2,6-dideoxyaldohexose can be hydrolytically cleaved off from pluraflavin A.<br>
The microorganism is cultivated aerobically, i.e., for example, submersed with shaking or stirring in shaker flasks or fennenters, if appropriate with introduction of air or oxygen. It can be carried out in a temperature range from approximately 18 to<br>
! 35°C, such as from approximately 25 to 32'C, including from 27 to 30°C. The pH generally should range from 6 to 8, such as from 6.5 to 7.5. Under these conditions, the microorganism is generally cultivated over a period ranging from 24 to 300"hours, such as from 36 to 140 hours.<br>
Cultivation is advantageously carried out in several stages, i.e. at least one<br>
) preculture is first prepared in a liquid nutrient medium, which is then inoculated into the<br><br>
actual production medium, tiie main culture, for example in the volume ratio 1:10. The preculture is obtained, for example, by inoculating a mycelium into a nutrient solution and allowing it to grow for approximately 36 to 120 hours, such as for 48 to 96 hours. The mycelium can be obtained, for example, by allowing the strain to grow for about 3 to 40 days, such as for 4 to 10 days, on a solid or liquid nutrient medium, for example malt-yeast agar or oatmeal agar.<br>
The progress of the fermentation can be monitored by the pH of the cultures or the mycelium volume, and also by chromatographic methods, such as, for example, thin-layer chromatography or high pressure liquid chromatography or testing the biological activity. The pluraflavins according to the invention may be found in both the mycelium and in the culture filtrate. The isolation process described below generally serves to purify the pluraflavins according to the invention, such as to purify the pluraflavins A, B and E.<br>
Isolation and/or purification of the pluraflavins according to the invention from the culture medium is carried out by known methods, taking into account the chemical, physical and biological properties of the natural products. To test the pluraflavin concentration in the culture medium or in the individual isolation stages, it is possible to use thin-layer chromatography, for example on silica gel using chlorofomn/methanol/glacial acetic acid/water mixtures (for example in the ratio 8:1:1:0.2) as mobile phase, or HPLC. In the thin-layer chromatographic separation, detection can be carried out, for example, using staining reagents, such as a-naphthol/sulfuric acid, where the amount of the substance fonned is expediently compared to a calibration solution.<br>
According to the invention, pluraflavins may be isolated from either mycelium or culture medium. Generally, the mycelium is initially separated off from the culture medium by the customary methods, and the pluraflavins are subsequently extracted from the cell material using an optionally water-miscible organic solvent. The organic-solvent phase contains pluraflavins according to the invention; if appropriate, they are concentrated under reduced pressure and purified further as described below.<br><br>
if appropriate, the culture filtrate is combined with the concentrate of the mycelium extract and extracted with a suitable water-immiscible organic solvent, for example with n-butanol. The organic phase is then separated off and, if appropriato, concentrated under reduced pressure. To defat the product of value, the concentrate can be diluted with an non polar solvent wherein the pluraflavins according to the invention are only sparingly soluble, such as, for example, with hexane, petroleum ether, diethyl ether. This causes the pluraflavins to precipitate, and the lipophilic impurities remain dissolved and are removed by customary solid-liquid phase separation. The precipitate, which contains all pluraflavins to be Isolated, Is dissolved in 1/30 of the original volume of water/methanol. The precipitate is dissolved completely and Is lyophilized. The lyophilizate, which is referred to as crude product hereinbelow, comprises 0.5 to 50% of pluraflavin and is used for further isolation.<br>
The further purification of one or more of the pluraflavins according to the invention is carried out by chromatography on suitable materials, such as on molecular sieves, on normal phase carriers, such as, for example, silica gel, alumina, on ion exchangers or on adsorber resins and/or on reversed phase mediums (RP). With the aid of this chromatography, the pluraflavins are separated. The chromatography of the pluraflavins is carried" out using buffered aqueous solutions or mixtures of aqueous and organic solutions.<br>
Mixtures of aqueous or organic solutions are understood as meaning all water-miscible organic solvents, such as methanol, propanol and acetonitrile, in a concentration ranging from 10 to 80% solvent, for example from 40 to 60% solvent, or else all buffered aqueous solutions which are miscible with organic solvents. The buffers to be used may be the same as indicated above.<br>
Separation of the pluraflavins based on their differing polarity may be carried out with the aid of reversed phase chromatography, for example on MCI® (adsorber resin from Mitsubishi, Japan) or Amberlite XAD® (TOSOHAAS), on further hydrophobic materials, such as, for example, on RP-8 or RP-18 phases. Moreover, separation can be carried out with the aid of normal phase chromatography, for 3 example on silica gel, alumina and the like.<br><br>
The chromatography of the plurafiavins may be carried out using buffered or acidified aqueous solutions or mixtures of aqueous solutions with alcohols or other water-miscible organic solvents. The organic solvent used can be propanol and acetonitriie.<br>
Buffered or acidified aqueous solutions are understood as meaning, for example, water, phosphate buffer, ammonium acetate, citrate buffer in a concentration from 1 mM to 0.5 M, and also formic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid or all commercial acids known to the person skilled in the art, for example, in a concentration ranging from 0.01 to 3%, such as from 0.1%.<br>
Chromatography can be carried out using a gradient starting with 100% aqueous buffer and ending with 100% solvent; for example a linear gradient ranging from 10 to 50%) using 2-propanol or acetonitriie.<br>
Alternatively, it is also possible to carry out gel chromatography or chromatography on hydrophobic phases.<br>
Gel chromatography can be carried out on polyacrylamide or mixed polymer gels, such as, for example, Biogel-P 2® (Biorad), Fractogel TSK HW40® (Merck, Germany or Toso Haas, USA) or on Sephadex® (Phamiacia, Uppsala, Sweden).<br>
The order of the chromatographies mentioned above can be reversed.<br>
A further, highly effective purification step for plurafiavins is crystallization. The plurafiavins crystallize from solutions in organic solvents and from mixtures of water with organic solvents. Crystallization can be carried out in a manner known per se, for example by concentration or cooling of saturated pluraflavin solutions.<br>
The plurafiavins according to the invention are stable in the solid state and in solutions having a pH ranging from 3 to 8, for example from pH 4 to 6, and they can therefore be incorporated into customary phannaceutical preparations.<br>
The plurafiavins of formula (1) and the chemical derivatives derived therefrom can be converted by methods known to the person skilled in the art into the     • corresponding physiologically acceptable salts.<br>
Physiologically acceptable salts of compounds of fonnula (I) are understood as meaning both their organic and inorganic salts, such as are described in Remington's<br><br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences (17th edition, page 1418 (1985)). Based on the physical and chemical stability and the solubility, sodium, potassium, calcium and ammonium salts, inter alia, are possible embodiments of acidic groups; salts of hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid or of carboxylic acids or sulfonic acids, such as, for example, acetic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid, inter alia, are possible embodiments of basic groups.<br>
The invention furthermore embraces obvious chemical equivalents (herein also referred to as 'derivatives') of the compounds of formula (I) which have a slight chemical difference, i.e. which have the same activity or which can be converted Into the compound according to the invention under mild conditions. The equivalents mentioned include, for example, esters and ethers, complexes and also reduction products of the compounds according to the invention.<br>
Esters and ether derivatives and reduction products can be prepared by processes described in the literature, for example in "Advanced Organic Synthesis", 4"" edition, J. March, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1992. The carboxy group (formula IE, IVE) and hydroxy groups of the compounds of the formula (I) can be converted to an ester group or ether group, for example. Such esters include, for example, (Ci-C4)-alkyl esters. Such ethers include, for example, acetals and ketals of the hydroxy groups.<br>
Stable complexes of the compounds of the formula (1) may be formed with physiologically acceptable inorganic cations, such as calcium or magnesium.<br>
The present invention embraces all stereolsomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I). Centers of asymmetry of the compounds of fomnulae (lA), (IB) and (IE) can, independently of one another, in each case may have the S configuration or the R configuration. The oxiranes of the epoxide-comprising group can be in any position; for example, oxiranes which incorporate the carbon atoms 2' and 3'. The Invention includes all possible enantiomers and diastereomers, and also mixtures of at least two stereolsomeric forms, for example mixtures of enantiomers and/or diastereomers, in any ratio. Thus, the invention provides enantiomers in enantiomerically pure form, both as laevorotatory and as dextrorotatory antipodes, R and S configurations, in the form of racemates and in the form of mixtures of the two enantiomers in any ratio. If<br><br>
there is a cis/trans isomerism, the invention provides both the cis form and the trans<br>
form and mixtures of these forms in any ratio.<br>
On account of their useful pharmacological properties, the compounds<br>
according to the invention are suitable for use as pharmaceuticals in human and/or 5 veterinary medicine. They have antibiotic activity and, in addition to the antibacterial<br>
action, antimycotic, i.e. fungi-inhibiting, including phytopathogenic fungi, antiprotozoic<br>
and antiparasitic properties.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be used for cancerous<br>
diseases, for example as chemotherapeutics. Owing to their cytostatic properties, ) such as their potent antitumor activity, and an antimicrobial action, they can be used,<br>
for example, as cytostatics for malignant degenerations in animals and humans. In the case of tumor cells which have developed resistances to conventional<br>
agents, only novel agents have a therapeutically adequate effect. Thus, the<br>
pluraflavins according to the invention and derivatives thereof of formula (I) have a i potentially excellent activity even against these problem cell types.<br>
The invention also relates to pharmaceutical preparations which comprise at<br>
least one of the pluraflavins according to the invention and/or derivatives thereof.<br>
Plurflavlns may be used in a mixture with at least one suitable auxiliary or exclplent.<br>
The excipients used for humans can be all pharmacologically acceptable excipients I and/or auxiliaries.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for preparing a pharmaceutical<br>
according to the invention which comprises bringing at least one compound<br>
according to the invention into a suitable administration form using a<br>
pharmaceutically suitable and physiologically acceptable exclpient and, if<br>
appropriate, further suitable active compounds, additives or auxiliaries.<br>
The pharmaceuticals according to the invention are generally administered<br>
orally, topically or parenterally, but rectal administration is also possible. Suitable solid<br>
or liquid pharmaceutical preparation forms are, for example, granules, powders,<br>
tablets, coated tablets, (micro)capsules, suppositories, syrups, emulsions, ' suspensions, aerosols, drops or injectable solutions in ampoule form, and preparations<br><br>
having a protracted release of active compound, in wfiose preparation excipients and additives and/or auxiliaries, such as disintegrants, binders, coating agents, swelling agents, giidants or lubricants, flavorings, sweeteners or solubilizers are customarily used. Frequently used excipients or auxiliaries which may be mentioned are, for example, magnesium carbonate, titanium dioxide, lactose, mannitol and other sugarc, talc, lactoprotein, gelatin, starch, vitamins, cellulose and its derivatives, animal or \/egetable oils, polyethylene glycols and solvents such as, for example, sterile water, alcohols, glycerol and polyhydric alcohols.<br>
If appropriate, the dose units can be microencapsulated for oral administration to delay the release or to extend the release over a relatively long period of time, such as, for example, by coating or embedding the particulate active compound into suitable polymers, waxes or the like.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations may be produced and administered In dose jnits, each unit comprising as active ingredient a certain.dose of at least one :ompound of the plurafiavins according to the invention and/or chemical derivatives .hereof. In the case of solid dose units such as tablets, capsules and suppositories, his dose can be up to approximately 200 mg, but can be approximately 0.1 to 100 mg, and in the case of solutions for Injection In ampoule form up to about 200 mg, but can De about 0.1 to 100 mg, per day.<br>
The daily dose to be administered depends on the bodywelght, age, sex and condition of the mammalian subject. However, higher or lower daily doses may also De called for. The daily dose can either be administered by being given on one )ccasion in the form of a single dose unit or in the form of several smaller dose units, )r else being given on several occasions, at predetermined intervals, in the form of subdivided doses.<br>
The invention is illustrated further in the examples which follow. Percentages ire based on weight. In the case of liquids, mixing ratios are based on volume*, unless stated otherwise.<br>
The following are illustrative examples of the present invention but not limitative )f the scope thereof.<br><br>

Example 12<br>
(a)      Examination of cytostatic activity.<br>
To determine tiie cytostatic activity, rat hepatoma cells were used which were obtained from the strain collection American Type Culture Collection under the number ATCC CRL-1548, Jo No. 223 and 228. The strain was kept in the "MEM (EAGLE) with Giutamax" medium [GIBCO BRL No. 4109-028] with 10% fetal calf semm [GIBCO BRL No. 10270-106] and 10 pi of penicillin-streptomycin [GIBCO BRL No. 15140-114]/ml. 96-weII microtiterplates [Greiner, No. 15140-114] were used. Each well was initially charged with MO^'pI of culturing nutrient solution and in'each case inoculated with 215,000 cells. The plates were then incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 20-24 hours. A dilution series of pluraflavins with concentrations of 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.5625, 0.7813, 0.3906, 0.195, 0.094, 0.047 and 0 pM, which had been prepared beforehand, was then pipetted in the corresponding order. After a further incubation time of 22 hours at 37X in an atmosphere of 5% COj, the liquid medium was then aspirated. The cells that remained were stained with 100 pi of RPM11640 [GIBCO BRL No. 32404-014]/weIl and 20 pi of Cell Titer 96 Aqueous [PROMEGA No. G5430]/weII. Light absorption at 590 nm was measured directly after addition and after 2 hours of incubation, as above. The cytostatic effect was calculated from the change in light absorption.<br>

(b)      Antiproliferation effects of pluraflavin A and flavopiridol on selected tumor ceil lines.<br>
MTT, a water soluble tetrazolium salt, is converted to an insoluble purple formazan when dissolved by cleavage of tlie tetrazolium ring by dehydrogenase enzymes in active mitochondria. Dead cells do not cause this change. This method was used to quantitate proliferation in order to determine activity of potential chemotherapeutic compounds.<br>
All cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) containing 10% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum, penicillin /streptomycin and supplemented with L-glutamine. Cells were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates at the following densities:<br>
Breast	2500.cells/well<br>
Prostate	2500 cells/well<br>
Colon	1000 cells/well<br>
Lung	1000 cells/well<br>
Cells were allowed to adhere overnight at 37°C, 5% COj. Pluraflavin A was diluted in culture media with the final concentration of compound as follows: 50.0, 16.67, 5.56, 1.85, 0.617. 0.206, 0.069, 0.023 pM<br>
Flavopiridol was diluted at: 2.0, 0.667, 0.222, 0.074, 0.025, 0.008, 0.003, 0.001 pM Both compounds were tested in triplicate at all concentrations. The ceils were washed with fresh media and the compounds added to the cells in a final volume of 100 pi. The cells plus compound were allowed to incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for approximately 72 hours. At the desired time point, 25 pi of MTT (10 mg/ml in HBSS) were added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37° C for 2-4 hours. MTT and media were removed and 200 pi DMSO were added per well.
