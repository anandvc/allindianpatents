This invention relates to a wet grinder particularly a table top wet grinder.<br>
Everyday Indian cooking includes wet grinding of cereals  raasalas, coconut and pulses, Manual grinding is now replaced by modern techniques and devices developed to meet consumer demands, Mixie  and liquidisers were found inadequate and unsatisfactory for Indian cooking as the high speed of rotating blades results in heating the dough or batter. Food articles prepared from such batter or dough are found to be substantially inferior in taste and texture. Electrically operated stone wet grinders developed subsequently avoided a few draw backs of mixie grinding. Low speed of rotation and stone grinding surfaces reduce excessive heating of the ground batter. But grinders of this type occupy large floor space and do not have stream lined appearance preferred by modern city dwellers. Furthermore, cleaning and other operations are also difficult and cumbersome. Tilting wet grinders solved this problem to a certain extend.<br>
Table top wet grinders were developed to meet the demands of modern homes, style and door. As most of the components are made of moulded plastics and are easily detachable, cleaning and other operations are easy and not cumbersome. In table top wet grinders, the containers in which batter is ground are detachable and the ground batter may be stored therein till desired. This avoids wastage and reduces labour,<br><br>
Problems faced with or the drawbacks in using wet grinders hitherto known in the art will be described in detail hereinafter.<br>
In mortar and pestle type wet grinders, a pestle fastened to a post by flexible link means is movably housed in the stone pit of the base stone member. When the base stone is driven, the pestle picks up speed due to friction created in between them by surface contact and lateral force. Substances to be ground, pass through the space in between the pestle and base stone cavity and are crushed in between due to the lateral load of the pestle, This load is transmitted to the pestle through the link means attached to the post and repeated rotation result in the formation of batter. Surface contact between the base stone cavity and the pestle is reduced considerably due to the presence of rice and other grains filling the gap between the two during grinding operation. As the grinding proceeds, lack of surface contact reduces the friction created between the two, resulting in reduced speed of rotation. The sticky nature of the batter formed also adds to the reduction of speed of the pestle. These factors result in increasing the time for grinding and consequential power consumption.<br>
Tilting and table top type of grinders also exhibit these drawbacks. It is observed that the speed of rotation of the cylindrical rollers in both the above types is reduced considerably  during the course of grinding and that the starting<br><br>
speed is not maintained throughout the grinding operation.<br>
Intermittant stopping is also frequently observed. Another drawback is that the existing types of wet grinders are not fully effective in grinding oily substances like fried onions, masaias and vada compositions, mainly due to the slippery consistency of such compositions. Dhal and coconut bits caught in between the two stone surfaces temporarily lift the roller stones upwards resulting in loss of surface contact between the two surfaces.-These factors contribute to stoppage of the device, enhanced power consumption and increase in grinding time. Manufacturing variations during machining of the stone surfaces enhance these problems.<br>
This invention has been developed with a view to overcome the aforementioned problems in the conventional, tilting and table top models of wet grinders.<br>
The invention will be described herein after with reference to the table top type of wet grinder having a rotatable drum provided with a flat stone base, driven by a prime mover. A rotatably mounted rod has two roller stones horizontally disposed with respect to the flat base stone. A holder means pivoted to a swing arm through a forked joint holds the roller rod and the roller stones. The fork is hingedly connected to the holder means through a female cavity which aligns with the male end of the holder.  The swing arm suspending the holder therefrom exerts<br><br>
vertical pressure and prevents the roller rod assembly from rotating alone with the dmm. A compression spring is provided in the swing arm in contact with the fork to exert vertical load or pressure through the fork to the holder. The fork pivoting and the compression siting in the holder enable the holder to swing in berth the directioiK. This also enables the rollers in the assembly to dance according to the up and down movements of the rollo- stones and flat stone thus prowding better surface craitact between the two and avoiding uneven surface teiKion.<br>
The flat stone and the roller stones of tlK grinder acctxding to this invention are<br>
provided with means for positive drive to avoid any speed reduction during operation.<br>
Oa&amp; embodiment of the positive tfrive means has a tootled gear wheel fixed to the flat<br>
stone. Each of the two rolla' stones disposed diametrically oj^site each other at a<br>
distance away from the centre axis of the roller holder also has two toothed gear<br>
wheels. These gear wheels axe located at 180° and they engage with the gear wlieel<br>
provided on the flat stone. When the dmm rotate, the toothed gear wheel fixed to the<br>
flat stone meshes with the gear wheels of the roller sttmes to drive them. Any known<br>
type of gear v^eels may be used in the drive. The flat stone and the roller stooss<br>
r
between the mealing gears thus ensuring positive drive without ray ^&gt;eed redaction.<br>
Substances to be groimd are {a-essed in between at   —	—-<br><br>
uniform speed resulting in batter production. Slippage, intermittent stopping and reduction of speed of rotation are avoided increasing grinding efficiency and decreasing power consumption. Grooves provided on the roller stones also facilitate grinding. Any other positive drive means may also be used to achieve uniform speed of rotation,<br>
The wet grinder according to this invention comprises a rotatably drivable drum provided with flat stone base and a roller rod assembly consisting of a roller rod having atleast two rotatable roller stones horisontally disposed to the said flat stone and a holder for the said roller rod, connected to a swing arm, characterised in that the said roller rod assembly is pivoted to the swing arm through dancing rollers, and the said flat stone and the roller stones are provided with positive drive means to drive the same at uniform speed.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the figures in the accompanying drawings wherein like numerals indicate the same parts throughout.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a sectional view of the dancing roller system and the positive drive system of the roller assembly.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the top view of the positive drive system to the roller assembly.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the top view of the roller stone with the toothed gear wheel.<br><br>
Fig. 4 shows the main toothed gear wheel fixed to the flat base stone and<br>
Fig. 5 shows the schematic assembly of the grinder according to this invention.<br>
Rotatably drivabie drum of the wet grinder is represented by reference numeral 14 and the flat stone base of the drum is indicated by numeral IS. The drum is detachably mounted on a drive shaft 31 by means of a toothed gear wheel 20 fixed to the flat stone 18 with the help of nut 19. The roller stones of the roller assembly are indicated by reference numeral 15 and the roller rod holding the roller stones is shown by numeral 22. Projection 16 on the roller rod prevent the roller stones from slipping out of the rod. Nut assembly 17 fixes the roller stones to the roller rod 22. The holder,of the roller rod is shown by numeral 1 and the swing arm which holds the roller assembly by numeral 7. The forked pivot is shown by 11. Reference numerals 2, 4, 5 and 9 are fixing means of the dancing roll assembly and 6, 10, 12 and 23 are gasket like protective coverings known in the art.<br>
The compression spring 8 connects the forked joint to the swing arm 7. The hinged Joint is covered by a rubber diaphragm shown by numeral 3 to protect the pivot joint and prevent the batter from entering into the cavity. Motor driving the wet grinder is shown by nuraerai 29 and belt connecting the motor to the  shaft  is  represented by numeral 26.  Gear  wheels  in  the<br><br>
roller  stones  are indicated by numeral 13.  The pins  of  these wheels mesh with the gear wheels of the flat stone.<br>
