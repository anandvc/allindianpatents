				<td>A REFRIGERATOR SYSTEM AND A FALLING FILM EVAPORATOR<br>
THEREFOR<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a refrigerator system and a falling film<br>
evaporator therefor. More particularly, the present invention relates to a falling<br>
film evaporator for a vapor compression refrigeration chiller.<br>
At its simplest, a vapor compression refrigeration, refrigerator or chiller<br>
includes a compressor, a condenser, an expansion device and an evaporator.<br>
Refrigerant gas is compressed in and is delivered from the compressor<br>
to the condenser, at a relatively high pressure, where it is cooled<br>
and condensed to the liquid state. The condensed refrigerant passes<br>
from the condenser to and through the expansion device. Passage<br>
of the refrigerant through the expansion device causes a pressure drop<br><br>
therein and the further cooling thereof. As a result, the<br>
refrigerant delivered from the expansion device to the<br>
evaporator is generally a relatively cool, saturated two-phase<br>
mixture.<br>
The two-phase refrigerant mixture delivered to the<br>
evaporator is brought into contact with a tube bundle disposed<br>
therein and through which a relatively warmer heat transfer<br>
medium, such as water, flows. That medium will have been<br>
warmed by heat exchange contact with the heat load which it is<br>
the purpose of the refrigeration chiller to cool..<br>
Heat exchange contact between the relatively cool<br>
refrigerant and the relatively warm heat transfer medium<br>
flowing through the tube bundle causes the refrigerant to<br>
vaporize and the heat transfer medium to be cooled. The now<br>
cooled medium is returned to the heat load to further cool it<br>
while the heated and now vaporized refrigerant is directed out<br>
of the evaporator and is drawn into the chiller"s compressor<br>
for recompression and delivery to the condenser in a continuous<br>
process.<br>
More recently, environmental, efficiency and other<br>
similar issues and concerns have resulted in a need to re-think<br>
evaporator design in vapor compression refrigeration chillers<br>
in view of making such evaporators more efficient, from a heat<br>
exchange efficiency standpoint, and in view of reducing the<br>
size of the refrigerant charge needed in such chillers. In<br>
that regard, environmental circumstances relating to ozone<br>
depletion and global warming have taken on significant<br>
importance in the past several years. Those issues and the<br>
ramifications thereof have driven both a need to reduce the<br>
amount and change the nature of refrigerants used in<br>
refrigeration chillers.<br><br>
So-called falling film evaporators have, for some<br>
time, been identified as promising candidates for use in<br>
refrigeration chillers to address efficiency, environmental and<br>
other issues and concerns in the nature of those referred to<br>
above. While the use and application of evaporators of a<br>
falling film design in vapor compression refrigeration chillers<br>
is theoretically beneficial, their design, manufacture and<br>
incorporation into such chiller systems has proven challenging.<br>
In traditional shell-and-tube flooded evaporators,<br>
the shell of the evaporator is largely filled with liquid<br>
refrigerant and a majority of the tubes in the tube bundle are<br>
immersed therein. Two-phase refrigerant is directed upward to<br>
the evaporator"s tube bundle from a distributor located at the<br>
bottom of the shell. Refrigerant vapor generated in such<br>
evaporators entrains liquid refrigerant droplets and carries<br>
them upward to the uppermost, unimmersed rows of tubes within<br>
the tube bundle for heat exchange therewith. Good axial<br>
distribution of the two-phase refrigerant mixture within the<br>
shell is important to ensure that the tube bundle is and<br>
remains fully wetted. As will be appreciated, flooded<br>
evaporators, by their nature, require that the chiller system<br>
employ a relatively large refrigerant charge.<br>
One recent attempt to address issues relating to<br>
the amount of refrigerant used in a refrigeration system is<br>
identified in U.S. Patent 5,839,294 which suggests the<br>
employment of what it refers to as a "hybrid" falling film<br>
evaporator. Despite the reference to this evaporator as a form<br>
of falling film evaporator, the 294 patent states that in its<br>
preferred embodiment, about one-half of the tubes in its tube<br>
bundle are immersed in liquid refrigerant and that in some<br>
cases, up to three quarters of the tube bundle would be.<br>
Further, that patent teaches and relies upon the use of<br><br>
Pressure and spray heads or nozzles to distribute refrigerant<br>
onto the portion of the tubes in the tube bundle that are not<br>
immersed in liquid refrigerant. The use of pressure to spray<br>
liquid refrigerant onto a tube bundle penalizes the efficiency<br>
of the heat exchange process due to the fact that a portion of<br>
the liquid refrigerant in the spray will be carried out of the<br>
evaporator in the stream of refrigerant gas that flows to the<br>
compressor therefrom without having come into heat exchange<br>
contact with a heat exchanger tube internal of the evaporator.<br>
Further, when pressurized or spray systems are used, a larger<br>
amount of liquid refrigerant will fall into the evaporator"s<br>
liquid pool without contacting a heat exchanger tube than will<br>
be the case in true or non-hybrid falling film evaporators.<br>
Non-hybrid falling film evaporators go<br>
significantly further to reduce the amount of refrigerant<br>
needed for efficient evaporator and chiller system operation by<br>
virtue of the fact that relatively very little liquid<br>
refrigerant is carried out of the evaporator entrained in the<br>
refrigerant gas that flows out of the evaporator to the<br>
compressor and significantly less refrigerant makes its way to<br>
the bottom of the evaporator shell without having come into<br>
heat exchange contact with a tube in the tube bundle. Still<br>
further, only a relatively small portion of the tubes in the<br>
tube bundle are immersed in the relatively shallow pool of<br>
liquid refrigerant that does collect at the bottom of the<br>
evaporator shell.<br>
In true falling film evaporators, liquid<br>
refrigerant is deposited, preferably in a low-energy, gentle<br>
fashion, onto the evaporator"s tube bundle from above and<br>
gravity is relied upon to cause liquid refrigerant to fall<br>
generally vertically downward through the bundle in droplet and<br>
film form. Because of these characteristics, falling film<br><br>
evaporators require a reduced amount of refrigerant to function<br>
and will typically provide superior thermal performance to that<br>
of flooded and/or hybrid evaporators due to the improved heat<br>
transfer coefficient that results from the creation of the thin<br>
film of liquid refrigerant that flows over and around the<br>
majority of the individual tubes in the tube bundle. Further,<br>
evaporator efficiency and performance is improved as a result<br>
of the elimination of the adverse hydrostatic head effects<br>
caused by the relatively more large and deep pool of liquid<br>
refrigerant which is found in evaporators of the flooded type.<br>
With respect to falling film evaporators, in<br>
operation, the vaporization of refrigerant liquid within the<br>
tube bundle of such evaporators generates vapor which tends to<br>
travel generally upward but along the path of least resistance<br>
in order to exit the tube bundle. Because the refrigerant<br>
delivered onto a tube bundle in a falling film evaporator is<br>
from above and because such delivery requires the use of<br>
distributor apparatus to provide for the uniform distribution<br>
and deposit of refrigerant onto the tube bundle, generally<br>
along its entire length and width, refrigerant vapor generated<br>
in the tube bundle, which will naturally tend to rise, must be<br>
conducted both vertically and horizontally out of the tube<br>
bundle and around the refrigerant distributor so as to conduct<br>
it to a location from where it can be drawn from the evaporator<br>
into the system"s compressor.<br>
The specific vapor flow path in a tube bundle is<br>
affected by bundle geometry, tube patterns and by flow<br>
conditions therein, including vapor buoyancy effects. Managing<br>
vapor flow within the tube bundle of a falling film evaporator<br>
is therefore of significant importance to the efficiency of the<br><br>
heat exchange process that occurs therein as is ensuring that<br>
the flow of refrigerant, when it is initially received from the<br>
distributor at the top of the tube bundle, is "evened out" for<br>
downward flow therethrough.<br>
If the downward flow of liquid refrigerant as it<br>
initially occurs in the upper portion of the tube bundle is not<br>
"evened out" thereacross, the efficiency of the heat transfer<br>
process within the evaporator and of the vapor compression<br>
refrigeration chiller as a whole will be degraded by oversupply<br>
of liquid refrigerant to one portion of the bundle and<br>
undersupply to another. Further, if local_vapor_velocity<br>
within the tube bundle becomes too high, particularly in a<br>
direction which is laterally across the tube bundle, breakdown<br>
of the film of liquid refrigerant, that develops around<br>
individual tubes and the existence of which is critical to the<br>
heat transfer process can occur. Such breakdown can lead to<br>
the existence of localized dry regions in the tube bundle. The<br>
existence of such localized dry regions, or "dry out" as it is<br>
referred to, like maldistribution of the liquid refrigerant as<br>
it is initially received at the top of the tube bundle,<br>
degrades the overall heat transfer performance of a falling<br>
film evaporator.<br>
Exemplary of the use of a true, non-hybrid falling<br>
film evaporators in vapor compression refrigeration chillers is<br>
the relatively new, so-called RTHC chiller manufactured by the<br>
assignee of the present invention. Reference may be had to<br>
U.s. Patents 5,645,124; 5,638,691 and 5,588,596, likewise<br>
assigned to the assignee of the present invention and all of<br>
which derive from a single U.S. patent application, for their<br>
description of early efforts as they relate to the design of<br>
falling film evaporators for use in vapor compression<br>
refrigeration chillers and of refrigerant distribution systems<br><br>
therefor. Reference may also be had to U.S. Patents 5,561,987<br>
and 5,761,914, likewise assigned to the assignee of the present<br>
invention which similarly relate to chiller systems that makes<br>
use of a falling film evaporator.<br>
In the RTHC chiller, which is currently state of<br>
the art in the industry, the tube bundle can be categorized as<br>
being generally homogenous in terms of its tube patterns and<br>
tube bundle geometry. Proactive control of the flow of<br>
refrigerant vapor generated within the tube bundle of the RTHC<br>
chiller is not critical for the reason that a dedicated liquid-<br>
vappr separator component is employed in that chiller, upstream<br>
of the evaporator"s refrigerant distributor. As a result of<br>
the use of such a dedicated liquid-vapor separator component,<br>
the refrigerant delivered into the distributor within the<br>
evaporator of the RTHC chiller is in the liquid phase only. As<br>
a result of the need to distribute only liquid phase<br>
refrigerant onto the tube bundle within the RTHC evaporator,<br>
the distributor therein is of a design which does not generally<br>
inhibit the upward flow of refrigerant vapor upward and out of<br>
the evaporator. The requirement for and use of a dedicated<br>
liquid-vapor separator component does come, however, at<br>
significant expense in terms, of chiller material and<br>
fabrication costs.<br>
More recently, a refrigerant distributor of a new<br>
and highly efficient design has been developed by which the<br>
generally controlled and predictable distribution of a two-<br>
phase, vapor-liquid refrigerant mixture within a falling film<br>
evaporator in a vapor compression refrigeration system is<br>
successfully accomplished. That two-phase refrigerant<br>
distributor is the subject of co-assigned and co-pending U.S.<br>
Patent Application 09/267, 413 filed on March 12, 1999. The<br>
efficiency and effectiveness of this two-phase distributor has<br><br>
eliminated the need for a separate loquid-vapor separator<br>
component in chillers that employ falling film evaporators.<br>
While elimination of the dedicated and expensive liquid-vapor<br>
separator component is very clearly beneficial, it does come at<br>
the cost of adding some complexity and design difficulties to<br>
the overall evaporator design.<br>
In that regard, in order for a distributor to<br>
accomplish efficient and even distribution of two-phase<br>
refrigerant to the tube bundle in a falling film evaporator, it<br>
will typically be of a generally solid and impervious design<br>
that will overlie the majority of the length and width of the<br>
evaporator"s tube bundle. Distributors of such a design do<br>
not, therefore, generally facilitate the unobstructed vertical<br>
flow of refrigerant vapor to and out of the upper region of the<br>
evaporator.<br>
Because the two-phase refrigerant distributor is a<br>
generally impervious component that overlies the majority of<br>
the length and width of the tube bundle, refrigerant vapor<br>
generated within the tube bundle must be caused to flow<br>
horizontally, in a cross-flow direction with respect to the<br>
downward flow of liquid refrigerant through the tube bundle, in<br>
order to conduct such vapor to the sides of the tube bundle<br>
from where it can be drawn upward and out of the evaporator<br>
shell unobstructed by the distributor. Such flow must be<br>
managed to minimize both the disruption of the distribution of<br>
refrigerant out of the distributor onto the top of the tube<br>
bundle and the downward flow of liquid refrigerant through the<br>
tube bundle.<br>
The need therefore exists for a falling film<br>
evaporator for use in a vapor compression refrigeration system<br>
in which the need for a dedicated liquid-vapor separator<br>
component is obviated by the use of a two-phase refrigerant<br><br>
distributor _yet._which provides for the pro-active control _o_f<br>
the flow of refrigerant vapor within and out of its tube bundle<br>
and shell in a manner which minimizes the disruption of the<br>
distribution of refrigerant onto the tube bundle from above and<br>
the downward flow of liquid refrigerant therethrough.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is a primary object of the present invention to<br>
provide for the control of vapor folw withing a tube bundle in<br>
an evaporator of the falling film type in which a refrigerant<br>
distributor is employed.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to<br>
provide a tube bundle for use with a two-phase refrigerant<br>
distributor in a falling film evaporator in a vapor compression<br>
refrigeration systems which obviates the need for a vapor<br>
liquid separator in such system.<br>
It is an additional object of the present invention<br>
to provide a falling film evaporator in which the distribution<br>
of liquid refrigerant onto, the top of the tube bundle is in<br>
controlled and predictable, quantities.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to<br>
provide a falling film evaporator which, by its employment of<br>
appropriately sized and positioned vapor lanes, is capable of<br>
conducting refrigerant gas out of the tube bundle therein<br>
without substantially disrupting the downward flow of liquid<br>
refrigerant therethrough.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to<br>
prevent the local "dryout" of tube surfaces in the tube bundle<br>
of a falling film evaporator by conducting refrigerant gas<br>
created within the bundle laterally thereoutof in a controlled<br>
manner which minimizes the stripping of liquid refrigerant from<br>
the surfaces of individual tubes within the bundle.<br><br>
It is a still further object of the present<br>
invention to provide a tube bundle for a falling film<br>
evaporator in which the geometry thereof is optimized so as to<br>
"even out", quickly and in the upper portion thereof, the flow<br>
of liquid refrigerant received from a two-phase refrigerant<br>
distributor disposed vertically above the tube bundle and to<br>
Optimize the tube pattern/geometry lower in the hundle to take<br>
advantage of the homogeneous downward flow of liquid<br>
refrigerant that will have been established as a result of the<br>
evening out of liquid flow in the upper portion of the bundle.<br>
It is an additional object of the present invention<br>
to provide an evaporator in which the efficiency of the heat<br>
exchange process is enhanced by it avoidance of the use of <br>
pressure to spray refrigerant onto the evaporator tube bundle.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to<br>
provide for the efficient vaporization of liquid refrigerant in<br>
a falling film evaporator and to obviate the need to<br>
recirculate or redeposit any such refrigerant that makes its<br>
way to the bottom of the evaporator shell.<br>
It is a still further object of the present<br>
invention to reduce the exit velocity of refrigerant vapor<br>
generated in the tube bundle, of a falling film evaporator and<br>
to prevent the stripping of liquid refrigerant film from the<br>
tubes thereof by such gas through the use of vapor lanes sized<br>
and located within the tube bundle to accomplish that purpose<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to<br>
provide a falling film evaporator in which the tube bundle<br>
thereof defines vapor lanes for the conduct of refrigerant gas<br>
thereoutof and in which the waterbox pass partitions of the<br>
evaporator are configured to coincide with such vapor lanes so<br>
as to simplify and reduce the expense of evaporator and<br>
waterbox construction.<br><br>
It is a still further object of the present<br>
invention to provide a tube bundle for a falling film<br>
evaporator which, by its nature, by its tube pattern and by its<br>
use of vapor lanes, is amenable to accbmmodating tubes of<br>
several diameters and pitch spacings and of being replicated<br>
within a common evaporator shell in a modular fashion so as to<br>
provide for evaporators of different capacities and<br>
efficiencies but which use a common shell.<br>
These and other objects of the present invention,<br>
which will become apparent when the following Description of<br>
the Preferred Embodiment and appended drawing figures are<br>
considered, are achieved by the use vapor lanes and optimized<br>
tube bundle geometry in a falling film evaporator that employs<br>
a two-phase refrigerant distributor. The vapor lanes and tube<br>
geometry control the cross-flow velocity of the refrigerant gas<br>
created interior of the bundle. That gas must pass laterally<br>
out of the tube bundle and around the distributor in order to<br>
exit the evaporator shell and to enter the compressor in the<br>
refrigeration system in which the evaporator is employed.<br>
Control of the cross-flow velocity of refrigerant gas flowing<br>
out of the interior of the evaporator"s tube bundle is<br>
accomplished, in the preferred embodiment, by efficiently<br>
distributing two-phase refrigerant into the evaporator shell<br>
generally across the length and width of the tube bundle and by<br>
the definition of vapor lanes within the tube bundle that<br>
facilitate the passage of refrigerant gas out of the bundle in<br>
a manner which minimizes the disruption of the downward flow of<br>
liquid refrigerant through the bundle and the heat exchange<br>
process ongoing therein. By appropriately managing the<br>
distribution and flow of liquid refrigerant downward through<br>
the bundle as well as the lateral or cross-flow of refrigerant<br>
vapor out of the bundle and by locating the vapor lanes used in<br><br>
vapor flow management to coincide with the waterbox pass partitions of the<br>
evaporator, not only is the heat transfer process within the evaporator enhanced<br>
but the fabrication and material cost thereof is significantly reduced.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a refrigeration system<br>
comprising : a refrigerant gas compressor; a condenser, said condenser receiving<br>
compressed gas from said compressor and condensing said gas to the liquid<br>
state ; a first expansion device, said expansion device being downstream of said<br>
condenser and creating a two-phase mixture of refrigerant gas and liquid<br>
refrigerant ; and a falling film evaporator, said evaporator having a shell, a tube<br>
bundle, a vapor outlet and a refrigerant distributor, said vapor outlet being<br>
connected for flow to said compressor and the tubes of said tube bundle running<br>
horizontally in said shell, said refrigerant distributor being disposed above said tube<br>
bundle within said shell and receiving liquid refrigerant from said expansion device,<br>
said distributor depositing liquid refrigerant vertically downward, generally<br>
unassisted by pressure, onto the top of said tube bundle, said tube bundle having<br>
at least two tube sections and defining at least one vapor lane, said vapor lane<br>
being an essentially unobstructed flow path between said tube sections that is<br>
sized to facilitate the conduct of refrigerant gas out of the interior of said tube<br>
bundle to an exterior side thereof at a velocity and in a manner such that the flow<br>
of liquid refrigerant downward through said tube bundle and across said vapor lane<br>
is generally unaffected by the cross-flow of refrigerant vapor out of the interior of<br>
said tube bundle through said vapor lane.<br><br>
Accordingly, the invention further provides a falling film evaporator for a<br>
vapor compression refrigeration system comprising : a shell, said shell having a<br>
vapor outlet ; a tube bundle, the tubes of said bundle running horizontally in said<br>
shell, said tube bundle having at least one vapor lane and at least two tube<br>
sections, said vapor lane being an essentially unobstructed flow path that is<br>
defined between said at least two tube sections through which refrigerant gas flows<br>
from the interior to an exterior side of said tube bundle and thence to said vapor<br>
outlet, said vapor lane being sized so that the flow of refrigerant gas therethrough<br>
to said exterior side of said tube bundle is at a velocity which generally does not<br>
disrupt the downward flow of liquid refrigerant through said tube bundle and across<br>
said vapor lane ; and a refrigerant distributor, said refrigerant distributor being-<br>
mounted vertically above said tube bundle within said shell and depositing liquid<br>
refrigerant, in generally predictable and controlled quantities, onto the top of said<br>
tube bundle by force of gravity and generally unassisted by pressure so that<br>
said liquid refrigerant falls out of said distributor generally vertically downward onto<br>
the top of said tube bundle.<br>
Accordingly the present invention further provides a method for controlling<br>
vapor flow internally of a falling film evaporator which employs a two-phase<br>
refrigerant distributor and which is used in a vapor compression refrigeration<br>
system comprising the steps of : positioning said refrigerant distributor vertically<br>
above a tube bundle within the shell of said evaporator; delivering a two-phase<br><br>
mixture of liquid refrigerant and refrigerant gas into said distributor ; flowing said<br>
two-phase refrigerant mixture internal of said distributor so that at least the liquid<br>
portion of said two-phase mixture is made available for distribution generally<br>
throughout the length and width thereof ; depositing, in a generally vertically<br>
downward direction and in relatively low-energy droplet form, the liquid refrigerant<br>
portion of said two-phase mixture across the portion of the top of said tube bundle<br>
that is overlain by said distributor; flowing liquid refrigerant deposited onto the top<br>
of said tube bundle generally vertically downward therethrough ; defining at least<br>
one generally unobstructed vapor lane within said tube bundle that runs from the<br>
interior to an exterior side thereof, said vapor lane dividing said tube bundle<br>
generally into tube sections and being sized to conduct refrigerant gas from the<br>
interior to an exterior side of said tube bundle at a velocity which generally does<br>
not disrupt the downward flow of liquid refrigerant through said tube bundle and<br>
across said vapor lane ; and flowing the refrigerant gas conducted via said vapor<br>
lane out of the interior of said tube bundle to the vapor outlet of said evaporator by<br>
a path that is generally unobstructed by said distributor.<br>

Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Referring first to Figure 1, the primary components<br>
of chiller system 10 of the preferred embodiment are a<br>
compressor 12, which is driven by a motor 14, a condenser 16,<br>
an economizer 1,8 and an evaporator 20. The compressor,<br>
condenser, economizer and evaporator are serially connected for<br>
refrigerant flow in a basic refrigerant circuit as will more<br>
thoroughly be described.<br>
Compressor 12 is, in the preferred embodiment, a<br>
multi-stage compressor of the centrifugal type. It is to be<br>
understood, however, that the use of falling film evaporators<br>
of the type described herein in chillers where the compressor<br>
is of other than the centrifugal type is contemplated and falls<br>
within the scope of this invention.<br>
Generally speaking, the relatively high pressure<br>
refrigerant gas delivered into condenser 16 from compressor 12<br>
is condensed to liquid form by heat exchange with a relatively<br>
cooler fluid, most typically water, which is delivered into the<br>
condenser through piping 22. As will be the case in most<br><br>
chiller systems, a portion of the lubricant/oil used within the<br>
compressor will be carried out of the compressor entrained in<br>
the high pressure gas that is delivered thereoutof to the<br>
condenser. Any lubricant entrained in the compressor discharge<br>
gas will fall or drain to the bottom of the condenser and make<br>
its way into the liquid refrigerant pooled there.<br>
The liquid pooled at the bottom of the condenser,<br>
including the oil therein, is driven by pressure out of the<br>
condenser and to and through, in the case of the preferred<br>
embodiment, a first expansion device 24 where a first pressure<br>
reduction in the refrigerant occurs. This pressure reduction<br>
results in the creation of a two-phase refrigerant mixture<br>
downstream of the first expansion device which generally<br>
carries any lubricant that has made its way into the condenser<br>
along with it. This two-phase refrigerant mixture and any<br>
lubricant flowing therewith is next delivered into economizer<br>
18. From there, the majority of the gaseous portion of the<br>
refrigerant, which is still at a relatively elevated pressure,<br>
is delivered through conduit 26 back to compressor 12 which, in<br>
the case of the preferred embodiment, is a two-stage<br>
compressor.<br>
The delivery of such gas back to compressor 12 is<br>
to a location where the refrigerant undergoing compression is<br>
at a relatively lower pressure than the gas delivered thereinto<br>
from the economizer. The delivery of the relatively higher<br>
pressure gas from the economizer into the lower pressure gas<br>
stream within the compressor elevates the pressure of the lower<br>
pressure refrigerant by mixing with it, without the need to<br>
expend energy in mechanical compression to do so. The<br>
economizer function is well known and it is to be understood<br>
that while the preferred embodiment describes a chiller in<br>
which a multiple-stage centrifugal compressor and an economizer<br><br>
are employed, the present invention is equally applicable, not<br>
only to chillers driven by other kinds of compressors, but to<br>
chillers which employ only a single compression stage and/or to<br>
chillers which may or may not employ an economizer component.<br>
The refrigerant not delivered back to the<br>
compressor through conduit 26 exits economizer 18 and passes<br>
through piping 28 to a second expansion device 30. Second<br>
expansion device 30 is preferably and advantageously disposed<br>
in or at the top of shell 32 of evaporator 20, proximate the<br>
inlet to refrigerant distributor 50 which is disposed therein<br>
although it need not be. The preferred embodiment of<br>
distributor 50 itself and its application in a falling film<br>
evaporator in the general sense are the subject of U.S. Patent<br>
Application 09/267,413, filed March 12, 1999 and assigned to<br>
the assignee of the present invention.<br>
A second pressure reduction in this refrigerant<br>
occurs as a result of its passage through expansion device 30<br>
and a relatively cool, relatively low pressure two-phase<br>
refrigerant mixture is delivered from second expansion device<br>
30, together with any lubricant being carried therein, into<br>
distributor 50. By positioning expansion device 30 adjacent<br>
the entrance to distributor 50, reduced stratification in the<br>
flow of the two-phase refrigerant mixture into and through the<br>
distributor, which can be created if the flow path for<br>
refrigerant from the expansion device into distributor 50 is<br>
lengthy, is achieved and the ability of the distributor to<br>
deliver two-phase refrigerant in a more controlled, predictable<br>
and, in the preferred embodiment, uniform manner across the<br>
length and width of tube bundle 52 is enhanced.<br>
Tube bundle 52 has a generally horizontal top 52a<br>
and two generally vertical exterior sides 52b and 52c. Once<br>
deposited onto the top of tube bundle 52 liquid refrigerant and<br>
oil trickle downward through the tube bundle, in a manner that<br><br>
will be further described. A portion of this liquid<br>
refrigerant and oil will make its way to the bottom of the<br>
evaporator shell and will form a pool 54 thereat. From there,<br>
the oil will be returned to the compressor, such as by pump 34<br>
and oil return line 36, as will further be described.<br>
Referring additionally now to Figures 2, 3 and 4,<br>
the preferred embodiment of the falling film evaporator 20 of<br>
the present invention is schematically illustrated in end and<br>
lengthwise cross-sectional views thereof. As will be<br>
appreciated, refrigerant distributor 50, around which<br>
refrigerant gas must flow in order to exit evaporator 20,<br>
extends along at least the majority of the length L and width W<br>
of at least the upper portion of tube bundle 52 within<br>
evaporator 20. The greater the extent to which the length and<br>
width of the tube bundle is overlain by distributor 50, the<br>
more efficient will be the heat exchange process within<br>
evaporator 20 due to the more complete wetting and productive<br>
use of the tube surface available in the evaporator for heat<br>
transfer purposes.<br>
Referring now primarily to Figures 4A-C,<br>
refrigerant distributor 50, which in the preferred embodiment<br>
is the two-phase distributor taught and claimed in above-<br>
referenced U.S. Patent Application 0-/267, 413, includes a first<br>
stage distributor section 50a which overlies a cover plate 50b.<br>
Ensconced within cover plate 50b are a second stage distributor<br>
plate 50c and an injection plate 50d. Bottom plate 50e covers<br>
the underside of distributor 50. Generally speaking, two-phase<br>
refrigerant enters distributor 50 through inlet 50f and flows<br>
bi-directionally to the ends of first stage distributor<br>
portion. Along the way, two-phase refrigerant passes through<br>
apertures 50g in cover plate 50b and enters the diamond shaped<br>
slots 50h in distributor plate 50c. As a result of such flow,<br><br>
two-phase-refrigerant will have been distributed in a<br>
controlled and predictable manner generally along the length<br>
and width of distributor 50 and, therefore, along the length<br>
and width of tube bundle 52 in the process.<br>
The refrigerant next flows through injection holes<br>
50i that are defined in plate 50d, such holes being relatively<br>
small and located in rows which underlie one of the diamond-<br>
shaped slots 5Oh in plate 50c. Because it is at a pressure<br>
greater than the pressure in the evaporator shell, the<br>
refrigerant sprays through holes 50i and impinges upon solid<br>
portions of bottom plate 50e. However, because there is a<br>
volume or space between plate 50d and bottom plate 50e of the<br>
distributor, the relatively higher pressure two-phase<br>
refrigerant that passes through injection holes 50i and which<br>
impinges on solid portions of bottom plate 50e loses the<br>
majority of its kinetic energy in the process.<br>
As a result, liquid trickles out of relatively<br>
large apertures 50j in bottom plate 50e generally unassisted by<br>
pressure and due to the force of gravity and distributor 50<br>
distributes liquid refrigerant in predictable and controlled<br>
quantities over the portion of the top of the tube bundle it<br>
overlies. In the preferred embodiment, though not necessarily<br>
in other embodiments, such quantities will generally be uniform<br>
across the overlain portion of the top of the tube bundle. Any<br>
refrigerant gas entering distributor 50 or generated therein<br>
passes out of apertures 50j, which, once again, are relatively<br>
large, and is conducted away from distributor 50 in a manner<br>
which is described below but which does not generally affect<br>
the vertically downward deposit of liquid refrigerant from the<br>
distributor onto the top of the tube bundle.<br><br>
It is to be understood, with respect to the<br>
evaporator of the present invention, that distributor 50 will<br>
preferably be any kind of distributor which is capable of<br>
successfully distributing two-phase refrigerant across a tube<br>
bundle in the absence of dedicated liquid-vapor separation<br>
apparatus or methodology the purpose of which is to separate<br>
refrigerant gas from refrigerant liquid in or upstream of the<br>
refrigerant distributor internal of the evaporator shell. The<br>
particular two-phase distributor illustrated in Figures 4A-C,<br>
while preferred, is presented only with respect to its ability<br>
to successfully distribute a two-phase refrigerant mixture<br>
across a tube bundle in a controlled and predictable manner and<br>
is not, in its detail and workings, presented in any way to<br>
restrict or affect the scope of the present invention.<br>
Therefore, two-phase refrigerant distributors of other designs<br>
are contemplated and fall within the scope of the present<br>
invention. Still further, however, the present invention, in<br>
its broadest sense, has application in systems where a<br>
distributor is employed which is designed to distribute single-<br>
phase liquid refrigerant. Once again, however, in its<br>
preferred empoaiment, the present invention has been designed<br>
in view of vapor compression refrigeration systems employing a<br>
falling film evaporator in which a two-phase refrigerant<br>
distributor that uniformly distributes liquid refrigerant onto<br>
the top of the evaporator tube bundle is employed.<br>
By the use of a two-phase refrigerant distributor,<br>
the need for a separate and/or dedicated liquid-vapor separator<br>
component or structure within chiller system 10, upstream of<br>
the evaporator"s refrigerant distributor, is eliminated.<br>
However, because distributor 50, in the preferred embodiment,<br>
receives and distributes a two-phase refrigerant mixture, it is<br>
a structure which generally overlies and does not readily<br><br>
facilitate the -unobstructed upward flow of refrigerant gas<br>
within the evaporator shell to a location from where it can be<br>
drawn into compressor 12. Therefore, provision must be made to<br>
efficiently conduct refrigerant gas that is generated in or<br>
received into the interior of the evaporator upward from tube<br>
bundle 52 and around distributor 50. The conduct and movement<br>
of such gas must be in a manner which minimizes the disruption<br>
and/or adverse effects thereof on the downward flow of liquid<br>
refrigerant through the tube bundle and on the heat exchange<br>
process occurring therein.<br>
Tube bundle 52 is comprised of a plurality of<br>
horizontally running individual tubes 58 which are positioned,<br>
as will more thoroughly be described, in a pattern under<br>
distributor 50 to maximize contact with the liquid refrigerant<br>
that issues out of the lower face 60 of distributor 50 onto the<br>
upper portion of the tube bundle. Such liquid refrigerant is<br>
in the form of relatively large, low energy droplets.<br>
In addition to the relatively large droplets of<br>
liquid refrigerant that dribble out of the distributor onto the<br>
tube bundle, at least some refrigerant gas, formed by flashing<br>
internal of the distributor or upstream thereof, will issue out<br>
of distributor 50 and will preferably be immediately directed<br>
laterally outward and around the distributor into the upper<br>
portion of the evaporator without significantly disrupting the<br>
deposition of liquid refrigerant droplets onto the tubes in the<br>
upper portion of the tube bundle. For that reason, a vapor<br>
space 62 is defined between the top of the tube bundle and the<br>
lower face 60 of the refrigerant distributor. The vapor space,<br>
by its sizing, facilitates the lateral movement of gas that<br>
issues directly out of distributor 50 while minimizing the<br>
effect thereof on the deposit of the liquid refrigerant<br>
droplets onto the tube bundle. In a refrigeration system<br><br>
wherein a single-phase liquid refrigerant distributor is<br>
employed within the evaporator of the present invention, the<br>
need for vapor space 62 would be eliminated since little gas is<br>
generated in or issues from such a distributor.<br>
The gas issuing out of the distributor and which is<br>
conducted out of vapor space 62, in the preferred embodiment,<br>
combines at the upper periphery of tube bundle 52 with the<br>
refrigerant gas that is generated by the heat exchange process<br>
that occurs within the tube bundle. This gas then passes<br>
upward and around distributor 50, as indicated by arrows 64,<br>
and flows through suction baffles 66 which also serve as<br>
mounting flanges for the distributor within the evaporator<br>
shell. Baffles 66 define perforations 66a along their length<br>
and, in the preferred embodiment, run generally the full length<br>
of the distributor.<br>
Flanges 66 position/support distributor 50 within<br>
the evaporator shell and distribute/regulate the flow of<br>
refrigerant vapor into the upper portion 68 thereof which is<br>
generally above distributor 50 and flanges 66. As such,<br>
flanges 66 function as a suction baffle by which the flow of<br>
refrigerant vapor into the upper portion 68 of evaporator 20 is<br>
distributed/regulated, generally along the length of the<br>
evaporator shell, prior to being drawn from upper portion 68 of<br>
the evaporator into the compressor 12 of system 10 through<br>
vapor outlet 70. Such distribution/regulation makes the flow<br>
of gas out of the evaporator and to the suction side of the<br>
compressor more uniform. By configuring and using the flanges<br>
66 for this purpose, the need for a discrete and separate<br>
suction baffle mounted within upper portion 68 of evaporator<br>
shell 32 is eliminated. Further, the perforated flanges act as<br>
a barrier to the movement of liquid refrigerant out of the<br>
lower portion of the evaporator shell into upper portion 68.<br><br>
The efficient operation of falling film evaporator-<br>
20 is predicated on the controlled, predictable and, in the<br>
preferred embodiment, uniform deposition of liquid refrigerant<br>
onto the upper surface of tube bundle 52 at relatively low<br>
velocity and in relatively low-energy droplet form, the<br>
creation by such droplets of a film of liquid refrigerant<br>
around the individual tubes in the tube bundle and the falling<br>
of any refrigerant which remains in the liquid state after<br>
contact with a tube, still in low-energy droplet form, through<br>
vapor lanes 72 and 74, as will further be described, and onto<br>
other tubes lower in the tube bundle where a film of liquid<br>
refrigerant is similarly formed therearound.<br>
Referring additionally now to Drawing Figure 5, the<br>
pattern and nature of the individual tubes 58 in tube bundle 52<br>
of the preferred embodiment is illustrated and will more<br>
thoroughly be described. As will be appreciated, the tubes and<br>
tube pattern in the tube bundles illustrated in Drawing Figures<br>
2 and 3 are meant only to illustrate the evaporator of the<br>
present invention in a more general sense whereas the more<br>
detailed tube bundle pattern/configuration is preferred.<br>
Generally speaking, tube bundle 58 is comprised, in<br>
the preferred embodiment, of an upper triangular-pitch tube<br>
section 80, one or more rotated triangular-pitch tube sections<br>
82 therebelow and a lower, preferably triangular-pitch tube<br>
section 84, generally at the bottom of the evaporator shell.<br>
The individual tube sections are separated/defined by vapor<br>
lanes, such lanes being avenues which are generally<br>
unobstructed by individual tubes and which facilitate the flow<br>
of refrigerant gas generated internal of the tube bundle<br>
laterally and/or diagonally thereoutof while minimizing the<br>
disruption of the downward flow of liquid refrigerant droplets<br>
therethrough.<br><br>
In the preferred embodiment of Figure 5, a<br>
horizontal vapor lane 86a is defined between upper triangular-<br>
pitch tube section 80 and rotated triangular-pitch tube section<br>
82a which is immediately therebelow. Rotated triangular-pitch<br>
tube section 82b is separated from rotated triangular-pitch<br>
tube section 82a by diagonal vapor lane 88a while rotated<br>
triangular-pitch tube section 82c is separated from rotated<br>
triangular-pitch tube section 82b and from lower triangular-<br>
pitch tube section 84 by diagonal vapor lane 88b and horizontal<br>
vapor lane 86b respectively. Tube bundle 58 can, in some<br>
cases, include individual tubes 58a in a lower portion thereof<br>
which are outside of the area of tube bundle 52 overlain by<br>
distributor 50. Such tubes are shown in phantom in Figure 5<br>
and their use is made possible by arranging the tubes within<br>
tube bundle 52 to facilitate the horizontal flow of liquid<br>
refrigerant to such tubes as will more thoroughly be described.<br>
Referring additionally now to Figure 6, an<br>
explanation of the terms "triangular-pitch" and "rotated<br>
triangular-pitch" as they apply to tube bundle sections 80,<br>
82a, 82b, 82c and 84 will be provided. Bundle sections 80 and<br>
84 have been referred to as "triangular-pitch" tube sections<br>
while sections 82a, 82b and 82c have been referred to as<br>
"rotated triangular-pitch" bundle sections. Tubes 90a, 90b,<br>
90c, 90d, 90e and 90f are illustrated in Figure 6 in<br>
triangular-pitch configuration. The vertical distance between<br>
such tubes and the tube which is vertically beneath them in the<br>
tube bundle is illustrated at 92. Tubes 94a, 94b, 94c, 94d,<br>
94e and 94f are illustrated in rotated triangular-pitch<br>
configuration. The vertical distance between tubes in this<br>
pitch configuration is illustrated at 96. Since the triangles<br><br>
formed by the centers of tubes in both configurations are<br>
typically isosceles in nature, the rotated triangular-pitch<br>
configuration is arrived at simply by rotating the triangular<br>
pitch configuration 30° around the common center 100 of tubes<br>
90a and 94a, which, for purposes of illustration and<br>
explanation, coincide in Figure G.<br>
As will be appreciated, the distance 96 between<br>
vertically adjacent tubes in a rotated triangular-pitch<br>
configuration is less than the vertical distance 92 between<br>
vertically adjacent tubes in a triangular-pitch configuration.<br>
As will further be appreciated, tubes in vertically adjacent<br>
horizontal rows which are oriented in rotated triangular-pitch<br>
configuration are immediately above and below each other so<br>
that liquid refrigerant drips or falls from a first horizontal<br>
tube row directly downward onto tubes in the horizontal tube<br>
row immediately below. Where tubes are oriented in triangular<br>
pitch, the tubes in vertically adjacent horizontal rows do not<br>
align vertically so that liquid refrigerant falling off of a<br>
first tube does not fall onto a tube in the horizontal row of<br>
tubes immediately below.<br>
If perfectly uniform initial liquid refrigerant<br>
distribution were obtainable across the top of a tube bundle<br>
and liquid refrigerant was not susceptible to being<br>
horizontally displaced in its downward flow therethrough, the<br>
pattern of the tube bundle would preferably and consistently be<br>
of the rotated triangular-pitch type throughout the bundle<br>
because the vertical distance between tubes in that<br>
configuration is shorter, making for a more compact heat<br>
exchanger. However, because initial refrigerant distribution<br>
across the top of a tube bundle is generally but not perfectly<br>
uniform and in order to promote refrigerant mixing so as to<br><br>
further even out the distribution and availability of liquid<br>
refrigerant as near to the top of a tube bundle as is possible,<br>
it has been found that the use of tubes in the triangular-pitch<br>
pattern in the upper portion of the tube bundle is beneficial.<br>
It must be realized, however, that the vertical and horizontal<br>
spacing between individual tubes in any section of the tube<br>
bundle will vary from one evaporator/application/size/<br>
configuration to the next and even within individual tube<br>
sections of a tube bundle and that nothing herein is meant to<br>
suggest or limit the scope of the present invention to tubes<br>
within a tube bundle that are horizontally and/or vertically<br>
equally spaced or spaced or configured in one particular<br>
fashion or another.<br>
Referring back now to Figures 1, 2, 3, 4A, 4B, 4C<br>
and 5, two-phase refrigerant mixture is introduced into vapor<br>
space 62 from distributor 50. The vapor portion thereof will,<br>
for the most part, flow laterally through and out of the vapor<br>
space although a portion of such vapor, as well as vapor which<br>
is created by the contact of liquid refrigerant with tubes in<br>
tube bundle sections 80 and 82a, will make its way into<br>
horizontal vapor lane 86a from where it will be conducted,<br>
following the path of least resistance offered by the vapor<br>
lane, to the outer upper periphery of the tube bundle.<br>
The liquid portion of the mixture deposited onto<br>
the top 52a of the tube bundle flows downward, first through<br>
tube section 80, wherein the flow of such liquid refrigerant is<br>
generally evened out and distributed across the width of the<br>
bundle as a result of the triangular-pitch tube pattern<br>
employed, and makes its way across vapor lane 86a into tube<br>
section 82a. The flow of liquid refrigerant continues downward<br>
within the tube bundle through tube sections 82b and 82c and<br>
across vapor lanes 88b and 86b respectively until any remaining<br><br>
liquid refrigerant and any oil entrained therein makes its way<br>
to and pools in the bottom of evaporator 20, nominally at a<br>
level indicated at 102, where tube section 84 is found- Such<br>
refrigerant undergoes flooded heat exchange contact with the<br>
portion of the tubes of tube section 84 that are immersed in<br>
such liquid while the oil-rich fluid located there is returned<br>
to the system compressor by pump 34 through line 36. The<br>
efficiency of the vaporization process eliminates the need for<br>
means, such as a pump, for recirculating liqrid refrigerant<br>
within the evaporator to bring it into contact with tubes in<br>
the tube bundle a second or additional times to achieve<br>
vaporization.<br>
It is to be understood that the downward flow of<br>
liquid refrigerant in a falling film evaporator is preferably<br>
in low energy, low velocity droplet form with any liquid<br>
refrigerant that remains in the liquid state after flowing as a<br>
film around a tube surface coalescing to form droplets or, in<br>
some instances, a curtain or sheet of liquid at the bottom of<br>
such tube which falls gentiy onto a tube vertically below it in<br>
the tube bundle. Such refrigerant, after being deposited onto<br>
a lower tube, re-form as a film thereon and flow downward<br>
across the surface thereof with any unvaporized portion of such<br>
liquid, in the same manner, again coalescing at the bottom of<br>
such lower tube. By the creation of a film of liquid<br>
refrigerant around the individual tubes in a tube bundle, the<br>
efficiency of the process by which heat is transferred from the<br>
fluid flowing internal of a tube to refrigerant film coating<br>
the exterior of the tube is enhanced as is the overall<br>
efficiency of the evaporator as a whole. To the extent that<br>
conditions exist within the tube bundle of a falling film<br><br>
evaporator that cause -liquid refrigerant to be blown off of<br>
individual tubes or to become entrained in refrigerant vapor in<br>
mist form, however, the efficiency of the heat transfer process<br>
suffers.<br>
With the above in mind, vapor lanes 86a, 86b, 88a<br>
and 88b facilitate the flow of refrigerant vapor out of the<br>
interior of tube bundle 52 to the exterior sides 52b and 52c<br>
thereof in a controlled manner which minimizes the effect of<br>
vapor crossflow on the downward flow of liquid refrigerant<br>
droplets thereacross. As will be appreciated, vapor lanes 86a<br>
and 86b are generally horizontal while vapor lanes 88a and 88b<br>
are generally horizontal but have a vertically upward bias at<br>
their exterior ends.<br>
In determining the proper size for a vapor lane,<br>
the thermophysical properties of the refrigerant, the expected<br>
liquid refrigerant droplet diameter and the expected local<br>
vapor velocities are taken into account. Vapor velocity and<br>
mean liquid refrigerant droplet diameter do vary locally<br><br>
throughout a tube bundle and must be accounted for in<br>
calculating the preferred size of the vapor lanes. Critical to<br>
such analysis are two factors, the first being Weber number<br>
determination and the second being local droplet deflection.<br>
The Weber number is a quantity associated with<br>
inertial and surface tension forces that exist in a gas-liquid<br>
droplet system. As is known to those skilled in the art, if<br>
the Weber number exceeds a certain critical value, vapor cross-<br>
flow will disrupt falling liquid droplet flow between tube rows<br>
in a heat exchanger and will result in the creation of still<br>
fine droplets thereof. Such relatively still smaller droplets<br>
have the tendency to become entrained in the refrigerant vapor<br>
flowing within the tube bundle. The entrainment of such<br>
droplets forms a mist, and a more or less homogenous two-phase<br>
flow pattern within the bundle.<br><br>
The creation of mist flow within a bundle results<br>
in increased pressure drop in the vapor flowing out of the<br>
bundle as well as the removal of liquid refrigerant from the<br>
bundle without its having had a chance for heat exchange<br>
contact with a tube in the tube bundle. Therefore, such mist<br>
flow not only results in detrimental and efficiency-robbing<br>
pressure drop within the evaporator but can starve a portion of<br>
the tube bundle, most often its lower central portion, of<br>
liquid refrigerant and cause the dryout thereof. That too is<br>
detrimental to the efficiency of the evaporator. Vapor lanes<br>
are therefore sized to minimize the creation of mist flow in<br>
the tube bundle and the pressure drop associated within it.<br>
The maximum acceptable Weber number for combined<br>
droplet/vapor flow in a tube bundle is determined for a<br>
particular bundle configuration and location via experimental<br>
test. Vapor lanes are then sized and positioned within the<br>
tube pattern so as to maintain local Weber numbers below such<br>
maximum values for each section of the tube bundle. By doing<br>
so, refrigerant vapor flows preferentially out of the tube<br>
bundle at predetermined locations and velocities which minimize<br>
the affect of vapor flow out of the tube bundle on the downward<br>
flow of liquid refrigerant within the tube bundle.<br>
Referring now to Figure 7, the effect of vapor<br>
lanes on the flow of liquid and vapor within the tube bundle is<br>
further explained. In that regard, if angle a exceeds angle 9,<br>
liquid droplet 110 will be horizontally displaced to the extent<br>
that in falling downward it will bypass the row of tubes<br>
vertically aligned directly below the tube of its origin.<br>
Vapor lanes are therefore sized and located in the tube bundle<br>
so as to control angle ?.<br><br>
In a rectangular tube bundle, diagonal liquid flow<br>
is generally not desirable, possibly other than in the very<br>
upper region of the tube bundle where a triangular-pitched<br>
geometry is used to even out of the flow of liquid refrigerant<br>
across the width of the tube bundle and where the effect of<br>
vapor flow is not, relatively speaking, as significant. Vapor<br>
lanes are employed in such bundles to maintain, to the extent<br>
possible, angle a less than angle 6 so that liquid droplets<br>
fall vertically downward onto the tube below in the same<br>
vertical row.<br>
In heat exchangers where the tube bundle is not<br>
necessarily rectangular in nature and may contain individual<br>
tubes which are horizontally outside of the portion of the tube<br>
bundle overlain by the distributor or which are, for instance,<br>
trapezoidal, with the lower portion of the tube bundle being<br>
wider than the upper portion, the use of vapor lanes to<br>
selectively permit angle a to exceed angle 8 may be desirable<br>
in some regions of the tube bundle to promote controlled<br>
horizontal liquid refrigerant migration within the bundle.<br>
Regardless the design strategy used, the use of vapor lanes of<br>
appropriate size and which are appropriately positioned<br>
provides for optimum falling-film performance by maximizing the<br>
wetted tube surface area therein as a percentage of the total<br>
tube surface area available for heat transfer.<br>
The use of vapor lanes has the additional advantage<br>
of permitting water box baffles (also referred to as ribs) to<br>
be located within or aligned with vapor lanes when positioned<br>
against the tube sheet on the side thereof which is opposite<br>
the side of the tube sheet where the tube bundle is disposed.<br>
Such baffles/ribs apportion and direct the flow of fluid<br>
through the tubes in defined sections of the tube bundle. By<br><br>
the use of appropriately placed and spaced vapor lanes, not<br>
only is the lateral exit of vapor from the tube bundle<br>
facilitated but the need to machine clearances or a complicated<br>
water box baffle configuration to account for non-uniform the<br>
tube patterns and/or the lack of a defined "lane", such as the<br>
vapor lanes in the preferred embodiment, is eliminated.<br>
Appropriately spaced and placed vapor lanes will, therefore,<br>
facilitate multiple water box options and pass strategies while<br>
eliminating time consuming, expensive and complicated machining<br>
steps in the fabrication of evaporator waterboxes.<br>
For example, in the two-pass water box baffle<br>
configuration of evaporator 20 in Figures 2, 3 and 8 the fluid<br>
to be cooled by refrigerant in evaporator 20 is delivered first<br>
into waterbox 200 through inlet piping 202 and then into lower<br>
volume 204 of the waterbox which is upstream of tube sheet 206<br>
and below water box baffle 208. Such fluid then enters the<br>
ends 210 of that portion 212 of the individual tubes 58 of the<br>
tube bundle that open into lower volume 204 and flows down the<br>
length of evaporator 20 in a first pass therethrough.<br>
At the other end of evaporator 20 the fluid is re-<br>
directed by waterbox 214 into the tubes in the upper section of<br>
the tube bundle. The fluid flows back down the length of<br>
evaporator 20 through such tubes in a second pass. The fluid<br>
then enters upper volume 216 of waterbox 200 which is defined<br>
downstream of tube sheet 206 and above baffle 208. The fluid<br>
then flows out of evaporator 20 through outlet piping 218.<br>
As will be appreciated, the fluid to be cooled in<br>
evaporator 20 in the embodiment of Figures 2, 3 and 8 makes two<br>
passes through the evaporator and is thus afforded two chances<br>
to be cooled by the refrigerant therein. Volumes 204 and 216<br>
in waterbox 200 are separated by water box baffle 208 which is<br><br>
configured to follow and coincide with(albeit on the other<br>
side of the tube sheet) a vapor lane, such as vapor lane 74,<br>
defined in the tube bundle pattern. By their existence, such<br>
vapor lanes result in generally linear and relatively large and<br>
well defined solid and flat surface on the tube sheet against<br>
which the waterbox baffle can abut.<br>
It is to be noted that the flow of the fluid to be<br>
cooled through the tube bundle in evaporator 20 can either be<br>
bottom to top or top to bottom. In the case of a falling film<br>
evaporator, bottom to top flow, as illustrated in Figure 3, is<br>
preferred in order to take advantage of the high heat flux that<br>
will be found in the relatively shallow pool 54 of oil-rich<br>
liquid refrigerant that will exist at the bottom of a falling<br>
film evaporator. In the case of a flooded evaporator, where<br>
the liquid level is high within the evaporator shell and<br>
wherein the majority of the tubes in the tube bundle are<br>
immersed, the vertical direction of the flow of the fluid<br>
through the tube bundle is not as critical.<br>
In prior evaporators, waterbox baffles were often<br>
complicated and had to be configured/machined to weave their<br>
way around open tube ends in an evaporator"s tube sheets for<br>
lack of a well defined, solid and contiguous surface on a tube<br>
sheet against which to abut. The fabrication and assembly of<br>
evaporator 20, by virtue of the fact that the abutment of the<br>
edge of waterbox baffle 208 against the tube sheet can coincide<br>
with the location of a vapor lane in the tube bundle, such as<br>
vapor lane 74, is therefore facilitated and the expense thereof<br>
is reduced.<br>
In applications where it is preferable for the<br>
load-cooling fluid to make three passes through the evaporator,<br>
the water box baffles are configured to follow two vapor lanes<br>
such as vapor lanes 72 and 74 in Figure 2. In that<br><br>
circumstance the water box baffles are positioned to first<br>
cause the load-cooling fluid to pass in a first direction down<br>
the length of the evaporator through the tubes located<br>
vertically below vapor lane 74. The fluid is then directed by<br>
the water box baffle arrangement to make a second lengthwise<br>
pass of the evaporator through those tubes in the tube bundle<br>
that are below vapor lane 72 but above vapor lane 74. A third<br>
pass back through the evaporator is accomplished through the<br>
portion of the tube bundle above vapor lane 74. In Figure 2,<br>
the inlet and outlet to the waterbox are on the same side of<br>
evaporator 20. As will be apparent, in a three-pass<br>
configuration the inlet and outlet piping through which the<br>
load cooling fluid flows would connect to opposite ends of the<br>
evaporator.<br>
Referring now to Figure 9, it will be appreciated<br>
that the vapor lanes in evaporator 20 can also be configured<br>
within tube bundle 52 in a manner which allows for the use of<br>
individual tubes 58 of different diameters within individual<br>
tube sections. In that regard, tube bundle 52 is comprised of<br>
sections 300, 302, 304, 306 and 308 which are defined by vapor<br>
lanes 310, 312, 314 and 315. Within each of tube sections 300,<br>
302, 304, 306 and 308 multiple tube diameters and/or tube<br>
pitches (spacing) may be employed with the size and location of<br>
the vapor lanes therebetween being maintained constant.<br>
For instance, larger diameter tubes 320, which are,<br>
perhaps, one inch in diameter, may be used throughout the tube<br>
bundle in applications or instances where use of a lower<br>
efficiency evaporator is sufficient or is appropriate for cost<br>
or other reasons. This size tube and the spacing thereof in a<br>
tube section is illustrated to the left of line 324 in Figure<br>
9. Smaller diameter tubes 322 which may, for instance, be<br><br>
three-quarter inch diameter, tubes, can be used where a higher<br>
efficiency evaporator is appropriate or justified. This size<br>
tube and the spacing thereof in a tube section is illustrated<br>
to the right of line 324 in Figure 9.<br>
The use of smaller diameter tubes will allow for<br>
the placement of more tubes in a tube section than will the use<br>
of larger diameter tubes, making comparatively more tube<br>
surface available for heat transfer in the same space/volume,<br>
all while maintaining vapor lane sizing/location constant to<br>
facilitate the cost effective fabrication of such different<br>
evaporators. As will be appreciated, tubes of more than one<br>
diameter can be used in an evaporator although evaporator and<br>
tube sheet fabrication would be complicated thereby.<br>
By the use of more or fewer tubes within individual<br>
tube sections, while maintaining vapor lane sizing and location<br>
generally constant, the capacity of the evaporator for heat<br>
transfer may be increased or decreased, as required for a<br>
particular application. Further, by the use of commonly<br>
positioned and sized vapor lanes but tubes of different<br>
diameters, as taught hereby, it has been found that evaporators<br>
of multiple capacities and efficiencies can be fabricated using<br>
a shell the length and inside diameter of which are the same.<br>
Such an evaporator design is therefore appropriate for use in<br>
chillers across a significant portion of the tonnage range of a<br>
chiller product line. As will be appreciated, the fabrication<br>
expense associated with producing the family of chillers is<br>
thereby reduced while the ease and efficiency of fabrication is<br>
enhanced since the remainder of the chiller components, their<br>
size and location relative to the evaporator need not change.<br>
Referring now to Figure 10, an alternative<br>
embodiment of the evaporator of the present invention<br>
illustrates the still further versatility thereof. In that<br>
regard, not only does the evaporator of the present invention<br><br>
permit the use of multiple different tube patterns and multiple<br>
tube diameters and tube pitches within a tube bundle while<br>
maintaining vapor lane position and sizing constant, it<br>
facilitates the use of more than one distributor by which to<br>
accomplish refrigerant distribution across the top of the tube<br>
bundle.<br>
In that regard, in the evaporator of the embodiment<br>
of Figure 10, two, two-phase refrigerant distributors 400 and<br>
402 run generally the length of evaporator 20 and are supported<br>
in structure 4 04 which incorporates not only combination<br>
suction baffles/mounting flanges 66, as was the case in the<br>
earlier described embodiment, but perforations 406 which run<br>
generally the length of the tube bundle 52 between the<br>
individual distributors 400 and 402. Perforations 406<br>
communicate between upper portion 68 of the interior of the<br>
evaporator shell and the space 408 between individual right and<br>
left tube banks 410 and 412. Each tube bank will include<br>
discrete tube sections defined by vapor lanes.<br>
The perforations 406 of structure 404 between<br>
individual distributors in an evaporator employing multiple<br>
two-phase distributors are sized so that local vapor velocities<br>
within the underlying tube bundle are controlled and are kept<br>
below a critical value which, if exceeded, would disrupt liquid<br>
flow downward through the tube bundle, particularly in<br>
locations where such disruption might cause liquid to be<br>
carried out of the tube bundle and, potentially, into upper<br>
portion 68 of the evaporator shell. Keeping lateral vapor<br>
velocities in the tube bundle as low as possible, particularly<br>
in locations immediate the underside of two-phase distributors,<br>
is advantageous and the definition of an internal vapor space<br>
such as space 4 08 and a vertical exit for gas from that space,<br>
such as through perforations 406, accomplishes that purpose.<br><br>
While distributors 400 and 402 are functionally<br>
similar to distributor 50 of the preferred embodiment, the use<br>
of two such distributors as opposed to one results in the<br>
creation of an additional flow area, in the form of the space<br>
4 08 between the tube banks, by which to conduct vapor out of<br>
and away from the tube bundle and into the upper portion 68 of<br>
the evaporator. Additionally, by the use of multiple<br>
distributors which are narrower in width but which still<br>
overlie the tubes at the top of the tube bundle, the<br>
performance of the distributors themselves is enhanced for the<br>
reason that while the lengthwise distribution of two-phase<br>
refrigerant is relatively simple and efficient, the widthwise<br>
distribution thereof within the distributor is not.<br>
Further, additional cost reductions and economy of<br>
scale in the production of evaporators of the design of the<br>
present invention can be accomplished by employment of an<br>
appropriate number of identical distributors in accordance with<br>
the capacity of the evaporator in which such distributors are<br>
used. For instance, two or more modular tube banks, such as<br>
tube banks 410 and 412, can be employed in such an evaporator<br>
with each tube bank being overlain by one two-phase refrigerant<br>
distributor. Each tube bank can, for example, be designed to<br>
provide a specific number of tons of cooling and can be<br>
separately fabricated.<br>
As mentioned above, the narrower the distributor,<br>
the better is the ability of the distributor to apportion two-<br>
phase refrigerant across the width of the tube bundle it<br>
overlies. By the use of two 250 ton tube banks and a<br>
refrigerant two-phase distributor associated with each, as is<br>
the case with the evaporator of Figure 10, a 500 ton evaporator<br>
can economically be fabricated, distributor width can be<br>
advantageously reduced, vapor exit from the tube bundle<br><br>
enhanced (as the result of the creation of a space between<br>
individual tube banks) and vapor lane width can be reduced, as<br>
can the footprint of the chiller and diameter of the evaporator<br>
shell. All of these factors cooperate to significantly reduce<br>
the cost of the evaporator"s water boxes and tube sheets, the<br>
cost of the evaporator overall and, therefore, the overall cost<br>
of the chiller.<br>
Referring additionally now to Figure 11, it will be<br>
appreciated that a relatively shallow pool 500 of liquid<br>
refrigerant will exist in the lower portion of the evaporator<br>
shell. That pool, as noted earlier, will contain oil that must<br>
be returned to the chiller"s compressor for use therein.<br>
Generally speaking, the liquid pool at the bottom of evaporator<br>
20 submerges no more than 25% of the total heat transfer<br>
surface area present within tube bundle 52 (25% of the total<br>
tube count in circumstances where a single tube diameter is<br>
used throughout the tube bundle).<br>
While about one-third of the tubes in the tube<br>
bundle will typically be disposed in the lower tube section<br>
502, one-half or less of the tubes in the lower tube section<br>
will typically be immersed in the liquid pool. It is also to<br>
be noted, with respect to the tubes in lower section 502 of<br>
tube bundle 52, that they are of triangular pitch configuration<br>
for the reason that more tubes can be packed thereinto taking<br>
into account the curvature of the shell at the bottom thereof<br>
which is the shell location that most affects tube bundle<br>
geometry.<br>
The nominal level of the liquid pool is indicated<br>
at 504. While the tubes immersed in pool 500 will be in direct<br>
heat exchange contact with the surrounding liquid, the<br>
remainder of the tubes in the lower section of the tube bundle<br>
will not only receive liquid refrigerant dripped from above<br><br>
that has made its way downward through the tube bundle, but<br>
liquid refrigerant that is sprayed upward from the surface of<br>
pool 500 as a result of the boiling of liquid refrigerant that<br>
occurs within the pool. Preferably, the spray resulting from<br>
such boiling is not sufficiently energetic to cause significant<br>
splashing/spraying of liquid refrigerant upward into vapor lane<br>
506 -or to result in a significant portion of the liquid portion<br>
of the spray being carried out of the vicinity of the tube<br>
bundle entrained refrigerant vapor.<br>
Schematically illustrated in Figure 11 is the<br>
addition of an oil concentrator 508 to evaporator 20. As has<br>
been mentioned, a certain amount of oil will flow out of<br>
refrigerant distributor £0 together with the two-phase<br>
refrigerant issuing thereoutof. As the liquid refrigerant<br>
portion of the two-phase mixture evaporates in its downward<br>
flow through the tube bundle, the concentration of oil in the<br>
remainder of the downward-flowing liquid refrigerant increases.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 11, a portion of the tubes in lower<br>
tube section 502, such as tubes 510, are disposed internal of<br>
oil concentrator 508 which runs generally the length of the<br>
i<br>
evaporator shell<br>
Concentrator 508 defines an inlet 512 generally at<br>
one end of the evaporator shell. Liquid from pool 500 is drawn<br>
into the concentrator through inlet 512, is drawn therethrough<br>
and is then drawn out of the concentrator via outlet 514 by<br>
apparatus such as pump 34 or an eductor (not shown). Outlet<br>
514 is located at the opposite end of the evaporator shell from<br>
inlet 512. Therefore, liquid flows out of concentrator 508<br>
after flowing down the length thereof through the volume 516<br>
which the concentrator defines.<br><br>
During the flow of such liquid down the length of<br>
the evaporator shell within concentrator volume 516, it is in<br>
heat exchange contact with the tubes 510 that are disposed<br>
therein and through which relatively warm fluid flows. During<br>
such flow, refrigerant boils out of the liquid, still further<br>
concentrating the oil in the liquid that flows through the<br>
concentrator. The refrigerant vaporized in this process is<br>
conducted out of concentrator 508 through one or more vapor<br>
outlets 520 that communicate between concentrator volume 516<br>
and a location from which it can flow to/into upper portion 68<br>
of the evaporator shell without affecting the downward flow of<br>
liquid refrigerant through the tube bundle.<br>
With this arrangement, oil return from the<br>
evaporator to the system compressor is enhanced and oil<br>
concentration in the majority of the liquid pool within the<br>
evaporator is kept low. Because the amount and concentration<br>
of oil in the evaporator is less, the level of pool 500 and the<br>
control thereof is more forgiving than is the case when oil<br>
concentration in the evaporator pool is higher. As an<br>
alternative to the use of a single inlet to oil concentrator<br>
508 and the exit of liquid which drawn down the entire length<br>
thereof, two or more concentrator inlets can be employed with<br>
outlet 514 being located generally about one-half the distance<br>
down the length of the evaporator shell.<br>
It is to be noted that in the ideal case the design<br>
criteria for evaporator 20, with respect to the distribution of<br>
refrigerant across its tube bundle, is to make such<br>
distribution as uniform as possible. That is the criteria to<br>
which the evaporator of the preferred embodiment is designed.<br>
However, the present invention does contemplate evaporators in<br>
which non-uniform distribution of refrigerant across the tube<br><br>
bundle is purposefully and strategically accomplished so that<br>
refrigerant is distributed internal of the shell in greater<br>
quantities in some locations than in others. In each case,<br>
however, by the use of appropriately located and spaced vapor<br>
lanes, the overall heat transfer efficiency of the evaporator<br>
will be enhanced.<br>
While the present invention has been described in<br>
terms of preferred and alternative embodiments, it will be<br>
appreciated that other modifications and alterations thereto<br>
are contemplated that fall within the teachings herein and<br>
that, as such, the scope of the present invention is not<br>
limited to the described embodiments.<br><br>
