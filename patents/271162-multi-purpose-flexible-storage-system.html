Agricultural Products including food grains are normally and conventionally stored in godowns. Generally, food grains and pulses are packed in bags/sacks and are stacked one above the other in open places, as space is a constraint. However, this unprofessional way of storing agricultural products is unhygienic, as the conventional storing system is vulnerable to pests and rodents and also exposes the stored items to extreme climatic conditions. This may be in the form of rain or severe heat, which reduces the quality of the stored items to a very large extent. Several times the stored items go as a waste, as they are unworthy of being used for consumption.<br>
This new invention MULTI-PURPOSE FLEXIBLE STORAGE<br>
SYSTEM has effectively tackled all the draw backs that exist in the conventional storage methods, as enumerated above. This MULTIÂ¬PURPOSE FLEXIBLE STORAGE SYSTEM is flexible enough to accommodate/store not only agricultural products, but can also store liquids like water, chemicals, etc., making a multipurpose storage system truly synonymous with its title.<br><br>
This     newly     invented     MULTI-PURPOSE     FLEXIBLE<br>
STORAGE SYSTEM has multiple compartments and the material stored in each segment does not come in contact with the other, as the storage system has been developed in such a manner. Another salient feature of this MULTI-PURPOSE FLEXIBLE STORAGE SYSTEM is that, the whole system could be dismantled easily and can be moved from one place to another, irrespective of the size of the system. It is pertinent to state here that this MULTI-PURPOSE FLEXIBLE STORAGE SYSTEM can handle enormous volumes and the exact volume cannot be defined as it is limitless, as segments can be added upon at will, such being the flexibility and veracity of this unique storage system.<br>
CONSTRUCTIONAL FEATURES<br>
This    MULTI-PURPOSE    FLEXIBLE    STORAGE    SYSTEM,<br>
essentially consists of a Centre Pillar (1), as shown in Figure (A) Drawing Sheet (1), which is made of steel or material having similar characteristics, which is mounted on a broad Platform (2), Figure (A) on Drawing Sheet (1). This Platform carries appropriate slots/fastening<br><br>
features to be clamped to the ground firmly, which could be either a nut-bolt combination or a riveting mechanism, which can secure the platform and the central pillar firmly on to the ground.<br>
Configuration of the Storage Bin (3) is as enumerated in Figure (B) on Drawing Sheet (2), which could be segregated to four segments across the horizontal plane. Drawing an analogy from a Clock, 12 to 3 Is one segment, 3 to 6 is the second segment, 6 to 9 is the third segment and 9 to 12 is the last segment, which in turn butts with the first segment. These storage bins are made of material, corrugated in nature and could be made of a polymer, steel or similar material, which do not chemically react with the stored material. A Cross sectional view of the storage bin has been depicted in Figure (C) on Drawing Sheet (3). Each of the individual segment of the storage bin is secured to the centre pillar either by an appropriate clamping mechanism, a 'C Type or T' Type groove, which could be inserted from the top of the centre pillar or by a nut-bolt arrangement, which facilitates direct fastening to the centre pillar (1). Each of the storage bin has an interlocking facility, wherein the top portion of the segment<br><br>
carry protrusions (male), which fit into the corresponding cavities (female) provided at the bottom portion of the segment pertaining to the succeeding top storage bin. This interlocking between the individual segments of the storage bin could be further secured by a nut-bolt or similar arrangement, to ensure that the stored material is intact. The top most portion of the storage system is closed by a tapered cover (4) of Figure (D) on Drawing Sheet No: 4, which could be secured in position by any known fastening mechanism. A taper is provided on the bottom most segment of the storage bin in a direction from the centre pillar towards the outlet, which facilitates easy removal of the stored items. Plurality number of pillars (5) of Figure (D) on Drawing Sheet No: (4) have been provided, which forms an additional support to the storage bins, which prevents the storage system from sagging. These pillars are clamped to the ground for stability. Further, a mesh enclosure of appropriate size is provided externally, forming the outermost concentric circles of the storage system, which guards the stored items from theft and prevents the probable damage that could be caused to the storage system by animals. Moreover, suitable locking facility is provided at the loading &amp;<br><br>
the unloading points, which offers security to the storage system. Further, this is crucial, when the storage system is shared by different parties. Air Vents (7) on Figure (D) on Drawing Sheet No: 4 has been provided at appropriate places, which ensures proper air circulation to the entire system, air being pumped from the lower segment. Further, chemical fumigation could also be achieved through the same vents.<br>
A protective cover/cap (6) of Figure (E) on Drawing Sheet No: 5, is provided on the top of the storage system, which is placed above the centre pillar. This protective cover prevents rain water from seeping into the system, thereby acting as an umbrella.<br><br><br>
I Claim,<br>
1.     MULTI-PURPOSE     FLEXIBLE     STORAGE     SYSTEM,<br>
comprising of a Centre Pillar (1), made of steel or similar material, mounted on a base Platform (2), which carries clamping slots to secure it to the ground firmly; Storage Bins (3), which could be segregated into four segments on a horizontal plane, each of them forming a quadrant, wherein the top portion of each individual segment of the storage bin carrying protrusions to match and fit into the corresponding grooves provided at the bottom of the succeeding storage bin, which ensures interlocking of the corresponding two storage bins, which are further held in position by a fastening mechanism, which could be a bolt nut mechanism or similar fastening devices; a top cover (4) having a tapered profile conceals the entire storage system; supporting pillars (5) have been provided at appropriate places to prevent the storage system from sagging; a protective mesh provided externally in such a manner that it forms the last of the<br><br>
outermost concentric circles of the storage system, safeguarding the entire system and a top cap (6) placed at the top most position of the centre pillar to prevent water from entering the system; with a locking facility provided at the loading and unloading points.<br>
2.	MULTI-PURPOSE   FLEXIBLE   STORAGE   SYSTEM,   as<br>
claimed in Claim (1), wherein the Centre Pillar (1) has a 'T' Type or 'C Type groove, which facilitates the insertion of individual capsule of the Segment Bin (3) from the top of the pillar or a nut-bolt mechanism, which facilitates direct clamping of the storage bin to the centre pillar (1).<br>
3.	MULTI-PURPOSE   FLEXIBLE   STORAGE   SYSTEM,   as<br>
claimed in Claims (1) &amp; (2) herein above, wherein the top cover (6) of the storage bins and the bottom most segment of the storage bin is essentially tapered, with the taper running from the centre pillar portion, externally towards the outlet; air vents (7) provided at appropriate places for air circulation and chemical fumigation.<br><br>
4. MULTI-PURPOSE FLEXIBLE STORAGE SYSTEM, as claimed in the above mentioned claims and as substantially explained herein with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
