				<td>PROCESS FOR GENERATION OF PRECIPITATED CALCIUM CARBONATE<br>
FROM CALCIUM CARBONATE RICH INDUSTRIAL BY-PRODUCT<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of precipitated calcium<br>
carbonate from calcium carbonate rich by-product generated in industrial processes,<br>
specifically, in nitrophosphate plants in fertilizer industry.<br>
Precipitated calcium carbonate is produced by calcination of calcium carbonate rich byproduct<br>
into quick lime in a kiln, followed by slaking or hydration to obtain hydrated lime<br>
and subsequently subjecting it to carbonation.<br>
Precipitated calcium carbonate finds varied commercial uses like, in the manufacture of<br>
paper, rubber, plastics, glass, textiles, putties, chalks, sealant, adhesives, paints, inks,<br>
varnishes, food, cosmetics, dentrifice, chemicals and Pharmaceuticals.<br>
Background Art<br>
Commercial applications of precipitated calcium carbonate require well-defined powder<br>
characteristics, particularly, fine particles with a narrow size distribution, uniform shape<br>
and crystallinity. Marentette J.M. et al. "Crystallisation of Calcium Carbonate in the<br>
presence of PEO-block-PMAA copolymers", Adv. Mater., 9, 647, 1997) have shown that<br>
these characteristics play a crucial role in product properties and their control is important<br>
for the preparation of industrially useful products. The precipitated calcium carbonate also<br>
needs to be substantially free of impurities for being useful for various commercial<br>
applications.<br>
Several physical and chemical processes have been reported for the treatment of solid<br>
waste containing calcium carbonate. Physical processes requires drying and grinding to<br>
such a fineness that impurities can be removed by screening, classification, magnetic<br>
separation, hydrocyclone and floatation separation. The disadvantages of these physical<br>
methods are requirement of special machines/devices and its maintenance. The<br>
unpredictable process efficiencies, variation in results of quantities of impurities removed<br>
and the expenses associated with employing such physical techniques are other<br>
disadvantages. Chemical processes for the purification of calcium carbonate rich waste<br>
involves leaching or bleaching of impurities using special reagents. Disadvantages of these<br>
methods are that it require number of unit operations to perform the treatment. Moreover,<br>
single chemical may not be suitable to remove all the impurities. Removal and separation<br>
of excess chemical after the treatment is another disadvantage.<br>
Another previously known and widely used method for the treatment of calcium carbonate<br>
rich waste is reburning within the kiln and removing it after cooling so as to obtain calcium<br>
oxide which is recycled in causticizing process in producing paper pulp or subjected to<br>
hydration followed by carbonation to produce precipitated calcium carbonate.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent No. 4,018,877 (1977) to Richard Derek Anthony<br>
Woode according to which an aqueous suspension of calcium hydroxide at 25°C is agitated<br>
vigorously and reacted with a mixture of air and carbon dioxide. After 15 minutes<br>
(following the 'primary nucleation stage') a complex-forming agent for calcium ions, such<br>
as hydroxy carboxylic acid, especially hydroxy poly-carboxylic acids (for example Citric<br>
acid and malic acid) in the concentration range 0.001 to 5%, especially in the range 0.03 to<br>
0.2% by weight based on the weight of the calcium carbonate produced, is added. The<br>
carbonation was stopped after about a further SO minutes when the reaction mixture had<br>
just become acid to a phenolphthalein indicator. The mixture is then heated to 8S°C over<br>
a period of 20 minutes and is allowed to age for 30 minutes. Carbonation is restarted at the<br>
much lower rate, maintaining the temperature to 85°C and after 20 to 40 minutes the pH of<br>
the batch fallen below 8.0. At this stage, 0.8% of stearic acid in ammonical solution is<br>
added and the mixture is stirred at 85°C for about 3 hours. The suspension is filtered and<br>
filter cake is extruded through 5/16 inch diameter holes to yield "granules" which are dried<br>
in an oven overnight at 130 ° C on a gauze-tray to produce calcium carbonate having 0.72<br>
relative granule hardness and 0.07 micron ultimate particle size with a soft texture. The<br>
drawbacks of this process are that the total batch/production time is more than 5 hours<br>
during which temperature is maintained at 85°C for a period of 4 hours and drying of<br>
product at 130°C for overnight period. This makes this process highly energy consuming<br>
and is unattractive.<br>
In US Patent No.4,133,894 (1979) to Hiroji Shibazaki et al, it is disclosed that the<br>
precipitates of uniform particle size can be continuously produced by repeating the step of<br>
carbonation reaction. In the first step of the process, a suspension of calcium hydroxide<br>
having solids concentration 0.1 to 10 weight % and temperature 15 to 30°C is sprayed in<br>
the form of droplets about 0.2 to 1.0 mm in diameter against a gas containing 10 to 40<br>
volume % carbon dioxide in countercurrent contact therewith, the gas being passed at a<br>
specified superficial velocity of about 0.02 to 0.5 m/sec., whereby 5 to 15% of the calcium<br>
hydroxide is converted to calcium carbonate. In the second step of this process, the<br>
suspension resulting from the first step is sprayed in the form of droplets of about 1.0 to<br>
1.5 mm diameter against a gas containing 15 to 35 volume % of carbon dioxide and passed<br>
upward through the column at a superficial velocity of about 1.5 to 2.5 m/sec whereby<br>
growth of the crystals is accomplished. In the third step of this process, the suspension<br>
resulting from second step is sprayed at a temperature of up to 30° C and in the form of<br>
droplet of about 1.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter into a column in countercurrent contact at a<br>
superficial velocity of about 1.5 to 3.0 m/sec. whereby the carbonation is completed. Thus,<br>
superfine calcium carbonate having average particle size less than about 0.1 to 3.0 microns<br>
is produced. The main drawback of this invention is that it needs control of number of<br>
parameters such as solids concentration, droplet size, temperature of suspension, gas<br>
velocity of carbon dioxide containing gas etc. at a time for three columns. Another<br>
drawback is use of multi-step-carbonation which require much capital investment for<br>
columns and pumps and the operating cost, compared to single stage carbonation.<br>
US patent 5,342,600 (1994) issued to Bleakley, Ian S. et al. describes a method of<br>
preparing precipitated calcium carbonate which comprises, slaking quick lime hi an<br>
aqueous medium, subjecting the said medium to continuous agitation during said slaking,<br>
passing a suspension of calcium hydroxide obtained after slaking through a sieve having an<br>
aperture size of 40-70 microns, subjecting the suspension to high energy high shear<br>
agitation with an impeller having a peripheral speed of 40-70 m/sec., so as to obtain finely<br>
dispersed calcium hydroxide, terminating the said high energy high shear agitation on<br>
achieving finely dispersed slaked lime, carbonating this suspension by passing through<br>
sufficient gas comprising carbon dioxide to cause the pH of the suspension to fall to<br>
neutral, during said carbonation step, subjecting the said suspension to continuous agitation<br>
to maintain the suspension with an impeller speed of 200-700 cm/sec, and separating<br>
precipitated calcium carbonate formed, The disadvantage associated with this method is<br>
requirement of generating high energy high shear agitation during slaking and carbonation.<br>
In several patents,: use of additives to control the morphology and particle size is<br>
recommended. As per the US patent No.5,558,850 (1996) to Bleakley Ian S. et al., 0.1 to<br>
2.0% by weight of reagent having one or more active hydrogen atoms e.g. polyhydric<br>
alcohol or phenol is added to the aqueous medium in which the quick lime is slaked. As<br>
per the US patent No.5,332,564 (1994) to Chapnerkar Vasant D. et al., quicklime is slaked<br>
in an aqueous solution containing about 0.1 to 2.0% by weight of a sugar for the<br>
production of rhombic shaped precipitated calcium carbonate and as per the US patent<br>
No.5,232,678 (1993) to Bleakley Ian S. et al., 0.01 to 1.5 % by weight of triethanolamine,<br>
mannitol, morpholine and solid boroheptonate for the preparation of clusters of calcium<br>
carbonate which give good light scattering properties when used as a paper filler or paper<br>
coating pigment. The US patent No. 4,714,603 (1987) to Vanderheiden, Denis B. mention<br>
the use of polyphosphates in an amount of 0.1 to 1.0 % by weight for getting precipitated<br>
calcite of substantially spherical morphology suitable for use in dull finish coated paper.<br>
The disadvantage associated with all these processes is the requirement of special reagents<br>
which adds to the production cost<br>
US Patent No.5,833,747 (1998) to Bleakley Ian S. et aL, discloses a method for preparing<br>
precipitated calcium carbonate for use as a pigment in paper coating compositions. The<br>
method comprising the steps of carbonating an aqueous medium containing lime, at least<br>
partially dewatering the precipitated calcium carbonate containing suspension using a<br>
pressure filter device operating at a pressure of 5 to 10 MPa. and subjecting the<br>
. precipitated calcium carbonate containing suspension to comminution by high shear<br>
attrition grinding with an attrition grinding medium such as silica sand having a median<br>
particle diameter in the range 0.1 to 4.0 mm. The product predominantly comprises<br>
aragonitic or scalenohedral crystals. The disadvantages of this method are that it required<br>
device for high shear attrition grinding with special grinding medium which is not<br>
separated during the process and pressure filter device for dewatering the precipitated<br>
calcium carbonate containing suspension.<br>
The process as described in US Patent No.5,6953733 (1997) to Kroc Vicld J. et al.,<br>
comprises the steps of forming a reaction mixture containing seed material of a<br>
scalenohedral particles of aragonite type calcium carbonate and adding lime slurry into the<br>
reaction mixture while simultaneously introducing carbon dioxide. The flow rates of the<br>
lime slurry and carbon dioxide are adjusted to control the solution conductivity of the<br>
reaction mixture to between 2 to 4 milli Siemens to form the clusters of calcite particles.<br>
The drawbacks of this process is that it require simultaneous addition of lime slurry and<br>
carbon dioxide for maintaining the solution conductivity. Moreover, control of flow rates<br>
of liquid phase and gaseous phase reactants simultaneously are difficult to administer.<br>
A process for producing calcium carbonate particles having an average size of 0.1 to 1.0<br>
micron is described in US patent No.5,811,070 (1998) to You Kyu Jae. The process<br>
comprising the steps of introducing carbon dioxide into a milk of lime containing a first<br>
reagent, such as sodium glutamate, sugar, and a mixture thereof in the range of 0.1 to 2.0<br>
parts per 100 parts of calcium hydroxide initially present in the milk of lime, to prepare an<br>
aqueous suspension containing calcium carbonate particles of 0.4 micron in average size,<br>
adding a milk of lime into the above aqueous suspension, and continuously reacting a<br>
carbonated solution containing a second reagent including at least one of sodium<br>
polyacrylate and a bicarbonate in the range of 0.1 to 5.0 parts per 100 parts of calcium<br>
hydroxide present initially, with the aqueous suspension. Calcium carbonate particles<br>
according to the process are suitable as a filler for adhesives, paints, inks, papers and<br>
plastics, especially Polyethylene transparent films. The drawbacks associated with this<br>
process is addition of reagents in two stages, both of which are of different types. This<br>
makes the process complicated and unattractive.<br>
US Patent No.4,367,207(1983) to Vanderheiden Dennis B., concerned with a process for<br>
preparing finely divided precipitated calcite in which carbon dioxide is introduced into an<br>
aqueous calcium hydroxide slurry containing anionic organo-polyphosphate<br>
polyelectrolyte with the carbonation started at a temperature above about 7°C and below<br>
about 18°C. The drawback of this process is that it requires anionic polyelectrolyte which<br>
add to the production cost. Another disadvantage is maintaining reaction temperature<br>
below ambient temperature, which require chilling plant and it is energy consuming.<br>

the range 20 to 150 microns.<br>
Attempts were made to purify the calcium carbonate rich by-product by the methods<br>
known in the prior art. Physical methods such as sieving, floatation, sedimentation and<br>
hydrocyclone separation were not successful which led to believe that the impurities<br>
present in calcium carbonate rich by-product are integral part of the material and not<br>
physically separate as in case of conventional raw material-limestone. Conventional<br>
chemical treatment methods were also found not suitable as the chemicals used were<br>
unable to leach the entrapped impurities.<br>
Therefore, it was decided to calcine the calcium carbonate rich by-product to obtain<br>
calcium oxide. When it was heated at 900°C for one hour, the percent weight loss was<br>
47.1% by weight and X-Ray diffraction analysis indicated presence of only calcium oxide.<br>
Therefore, it was inferred that some of the impurities can be removed by calcination of<br>
calcium carbonate rich by-product, which can be subjected to hydration and carbonation to<br>
obtain precipitated calcium carbonate.<br>
Therefore, in the present invention a process for the production of precipitated calcium<br>
carbonate from calcium carbonate rich by-product generated in industrial processes,<br>
specifically from nitrophosphate fertilizer plant is developed which comprises feeding<br>
continuously the wet calcium carbonate rich by-product containing up to 25% moisture<br>
and having particle size in the range of 20 to ISO microns into a calciner maintained at<br>
above 850°C and below 950°C, at a feed rate of 5 to 20 kg/h. The residence time of<br>
material in calciner is varied from 30 to 90 minutes by varying the rotation speed from 0.5<br>
to 2 RPM at an angle of inclination of 1.08 degrees. Calciner is provided with the<br>
arrangements to remove the liberated water vapors, carbon dioxide, ammonia and NOX<br>
containing exhaust gas into a scrubber wherein ammonia and NOX gases are scrubbed with<br>
water. The outlet rate of calcined material varied from 2 to 10 kg/h. The calcined mass<br>
coming out is in big lump form. Therefore it is passed through a jaw crusher fitted in<br>
between calciner and material cooler for crushing it to small lumps. The outlet material<br>
from crusher is passed through water-circulated jacketed screw conveyer type material<br>
cooler for cooling the small lumps to near ambient temperature (40 to 50°C). Slaking of<br>
calcined material obtained from material cooler is carried out with water for one hour in a<br>
slaker provided with agitator rotating at 120 RPM to produce hydrated lime slurry having<br>
concentration 15 to 23% by weight Impurities present in the form of heavier and coarser<br>
particles were removed by sedimentation and / or wet sieving through 60 to 100 mesh<br>
sieve. The slurry is diluted to desired concentration in the range 10 to 20% by weight and<br>
transferred into a carbonation reactor provided with the sparger. Carbonation is<br>
accomplished by passing carbon dioxide - air mixture containing 25% by volume carbon<br>
dioxide at a gas velocity of 10 to 15 cm/sec, and maintaining the temperature in the range<br>
from 25 to 45°C until the pH of the slurry falls to near neutral and separating the<br>
precipitated material formed by known methods. Drying and pulverizing the solids to get<br>
precipitated calcium carbonate. Optionally, the product slurry is treated with fatty acid<br>
derivative emulsion or solution at 95°C to get 2 to 3.5% by weight total fatty matter hi the<br>
coated calcium carbonate. The solids were recovered by known methods of filtration,<br>
drying and pulverizing to get coated calcium carbonate. The properties of Precipitated<br>
calcium carbonate and coated Precipitated calcium carbonate are given in Table 1 which<br>
indicated that it is useful as filler in paints, plastics, rubber and PVC.<br>
The percent available CaO in calcined material was determined by Sugar method which<br>
involved adding known weight of sample in 15% sugar solution and allowing it to dissolve<br>
for 3 hours, then filtering the solution to remove undissloved solids, and titrating an alicpiot<br>
of filtrate with standard acid.<br>
The product properties were determined as per the methods described as follows. The<br>
calcium carbonate content of the product is determined by adding accurately weighed<br>
about 2 g of sample in known volume of standard acid, allowing it to react completely and<br>
titrating the unused acid with standard alkali solution. Mixed oxides are determined by<br>
precipitating hydroxides from acidic solution of sample followed by ignition of hydroxides<br>
and weighing as oxides. Phosphates are determined by spectrophotometric method.<br>
Ammonical nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and fluoride are determined by ion-selective<br>
electrodes. Tapped bulk density is measured by noting the volume of material after tapping<br>
50 times of a known weight of sample in a calibrated cylinder. Whiteness/brightness is<br>
measured by measuring reflectance of sample and comparing with the reflectance of<br>
magnesium carbonate (considered as 100% whiteness) and that of carbon black<br>
(considered as zero percent whiteness). The particle size is determined using Mastersizer-<br>
2000 (Malvern, UK), particle size analyzer as dry powder. The total fatty matter is<br>
determined by extracting coated material with absolute alcohol, separating the same and<br>
evaporating the solvent to get coating material as residue.<br>
The process for the production of precipitated calcium carbonate according to the present<br>
invention, uses a new kind of raw material which is a by-product generated in<br>
nitrophosphate fertilizer plant, hitherto not used for the purpose, having particle size in the<br>
range 20 to ISO microns and containing various types of impurities not usually found in the<br>
conventionally employed raw material - limestone. Considering the scientific knowledge<br>
about the type of impurities present in calcium carbonate rich by-product, it was possible<br>
to find out the data for such material with regard to its decomposition or sublimation<br>
temperature, which is described below:<br>
Moisture can be removed by drying the material at 105-110°C for a sufficient period.<br>
Ammonium carbonate decompose at 58°C, ammonium bicarbonate decompose between<br>
36-60°C and sublime, ammonium nitrate decompose at 210°C, ammonium chloride and<br>
fluoride sublimate at 335°C.<br>
Calcium nitrate (anhydrous) melts at 561°C, calcium nitrate trihydrate melt at 51.5°C,<br>
calcium nitrate tetrahydrate decomposes at 132°C. Calcium mono- and di- phosphates<br>
decompose below 205°C, whereas calcium tri- and pyro-phosphate melt above 1200°C.<br>
Calcium hydroxide is converted to CaO and water between 580 and 600°C.<br>
Aragonite type calcium carbonate decompose at 825°C, whereas calcite type decompose at<br>
about 895°C into Calcium oxide and Carbon dioxide. If calcium carbonate is heated above<br>
1000°C it forms dead burnt / inactive Calcium oxide and liberate Carbon dioxide. It was<br>
also known that active calcium oxide could be slaked to obtain hydrated lime which can be<br>
further carbonated to produce precipitated calcium carbonate.<br>
The inventive steps involved in the process include<br>
- Using raw material without pre-drying or crushing.<br>
- Keeping the material in free flowing conditions throughout the processing.<br>
- Removal of the chemical impurities during calcination.<br>
- Improving brightness without using any special reagent.<br>
- Calcination of very fine (20 to 150 micron) and highly dense (bulk density 1.3 to<br>
1.35 g/ml) particles with minimum dusting.<br>
- Avoiding the requirement of special type of material of construction of calciner by<br>
limiting the calcination to below 1000°C temperature.<br>
- Limiting the effect of calcination to impurities without forming the dead burnt lime.<br>
- Arrangements for scrubbing the liberated gases to avoid pollution surrounding<br>
environment.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustrations and therefore should not be<br>
construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
