				<td>DEKIVATITTES AS MYELOPEBOXIDASE IMIBITOES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the use of thioxanthine derivatives as inhibitors of the<br>
enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO). Certain novel thioxanthine derivatives are also disclosed<br>
together with processes for their preparation, compositions containing them and their use<br>
in therapy.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme- containing enzyme found predominantly in<br>
polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). MPO is one member of a diverse protein family of<br>
mammalian peroxidases that also includes eosinophil peroxidase, thyroid peroxidase,<br>
salivary peroxidase, lactoperoxidase, prostaglandin H synthase, and others. The mature<br>
enzyme is a dimer of identical halves. Each half molecule contains a covalently bound<br>
heme that exhibits unusual spectral properties responsible for the characteristic green<br>
colour of MPO. Cleavage of the disulphide bridge linking the two halves of MPO yields<br>
the hemi-enzyme that exhibits spectral and catalytic properties indistinguishable from<br>
those of the intact enzyme. The enzyme uses hydrogen peroxide to oxidize chloride to<br>
hypochlorous acid. Other halides and pseudohalides (like thiocyanate) are also<br>
physiological substrates to MPO.<br>
PMNs are of particular importance for combating infections. These cells contain MPO,<br>
with wel] documented microbicidal action. PMNs act non-specifically by phagocytosis to<br>
engulf microorganisms, incorporate them into vacuoles, termed phagosomes, which fuse<br>
with granules containing myeloperoxidase to form phagolysosomes. In phagolysosomes<br>
the enzymatic activity of the myeloperoxidase leads to the formation of hypochlorous acid,<br>
a potent bactericidal compound. Hypochlorous acid is oxidizing in itself, and reacts most<br>
avidly with thiols and thioethers, but also converts amines into chloramines, and<br>
chlorinates aromatic amino acids. Macrophages are large phagocytic cells which, like<br>
PMNs, are capable of phagocytosing microorganisms. Macrophages can generate<br>
hydrogen peroxide and upon activation also produce myeloperoxidase. MPO and hydrogen<br>
peroxide can also be released to tiie outside of the cells where the reaction with chloride<br>
can induce damage to adjacent tissue.<br>
Linkage of myeloperoxidase activity to disease has been implicated in neurological<br>
diseases with a neuroinflammatory response including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's<br>
disease, Parkinson's disease and stroke as well as other inflammatory diseases or<br>
conditions like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis,<br>
atherosclerosis, .inflammatory .bowel disease, renal glomerular damage and rheumatoid<br>
arthritis. Lung cancer has also been suggested to be associated with high MPO levels.<br>
WO 01/85146 discloses various compounds that are MPO inhibitors and are thereby useful<br>
in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 3-n-Propyl-2-<br>
thioxanthine is disclosed in Drag Development Research, 1999, 47, 45-53. 3-Isobutyl-6-<br>
thioxanthine is disclosed in J. Chem. Soc., 1962,1863. 2-Thioxantitiine is commercially<br>
available.<br>
The present invention relates to a group of thioxanthine derivatives that surprisingly<br>
display useful properties as inhibitors of the enzyme MPO.<br>

A further aspect of the invention is the use of the novel compounds of formula (la) or (Ib)<br>
as a medicament.<br>
According to the invention, we further provide a process for the preparation of the novel<br>
compounds of formula (la) or (Ib), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, enantiomer,<br>
diastereomer or racemate thereof which comprises:<br>
(a) reaction of a compound of formula (Ha) or (Ufa)<br>
or<br>
(Ha)<br>
22 RR<br>
wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 are as defined in formula (la) or (Ib), X represents 0 or S and<br>
Y represents O;<br>
with a sulphurising compound such as Lawesson's reagent or phosphorus pentasulphide;<br>
to give a corresponding compound wherein Y represents S; or<br>
(b) reaction of a diamine of formula (ffla) or (fflb)<br>
wherein R , R , R , X and Y are as defined in formula (la) or (Ib);<br>
with formic acid or with a trialkylorthoester;<br>
and where necessary converting the resultant compound of formula (la) or (Ib), or another salt<br>
thereof, into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; or converting the resultant compound<br>
of formula (la) or (Ib) into a further compound of formula (la) or (Ib); and where desired<br>
converting the resultant compound of formula (la) or (Ib) into an optical isomer thereof.<br>
In process (a), a compound of formula (Ha) or (Ob) and a sulfurising agent such as<br>
Lawesson's reagent, or phosphorus pentasulfide are dissolved or suspended in a suitable<br>
dry organic solvent such as benzene, toluene, xylene, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane or<br>
dioxane and then heated to between 30 °C and the reflux temperature of the solvent until<br>
reaction is complete, typically for between one to 30 hours. The reaction mixture is then<br>
cooled and filtered to remove insoluble solids. The solvent is removed under reduced<br>
pressure and the crude product is purified by column chromatography or by<br>
recrystallisation.<br>
In process (b), a diamine of formula (IHa) or (TUb) is treated at a suitable temperature with an<br>
excess of an appropriate ortho ester such as triethylorthoformate, triethylorthoacetate,<br>
triethylorthopropionate, triethylorthobutanoate, tripropylorthoformate, tributylorthoformate<br>
and triisopropylorthoformate, optionally in the presence of a suitable solvent such as an<br>
alcohol, until reaction is complete. The temperature is typically up to the reflux<br>
temperature of the reaction mixture, and reaction times are generally from 30 minutes to<br>
overnight. In one embodiment, the orthoester is triethylorthoformate with ethanol as an<br>
optional solvent.<br>
Alternatively in process (b), a diamine of formula Cffla) or (Hlb) is treated with 98% formic<br>
acid at a suitable temperature between ambient temperature and the reflux temperature of<br>
the reaction mixture. The process is continued for a suitable period of time, typically for<br>
between 0.5 to 5 hours. After removal of the formic acid, treatment with a suitable aqueous<br>
base, for example, with 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, then yields the<br>
compound of formula (I). The treatment with base is carried out for a suitable time at a<br>
suitable temperature, for example, for about 10 minutes to 4 hours at a temperature<br>
between ambient temperature and the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture.<br>
Other methods for the conversion of a diamine of formula (ffla) or (TUb) into a compound of<br>
formula (la) or (Ib) are described in the literature and will be readily known to the person<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
The present invention includes compounds of formula (la) or (Ib) in the form of salts, in<br>
particular acid addition salts. Suitable salts include those formed with both organic and<br>
inorganic acids. Such acid addition salts will normally be pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
although salts of non-pharmaceutically acceptable acids may be of utility in the preparation<br>
and purification of the compound in question. Thus, preferred salts include those formed<br>
from hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, phosphoric, citric, tartaric, lactic, pyruvic,<br>
acetic, succinic, fumaric, maleic, methanesulphonic and benzenesulphonic acids.<br>
Salts of compounds of formula (la) or (Ib) may be formed by reacting the free base, or a salt,<br>
enantiomer or racemate thereof, with one or more equivalents of the appropriate acid. The<br>
reaction may be carried out in a solvent or medium in which the salt is insoluble or in a<br>
solvent in which the salt is soluble, for example, water, dioxan, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran or<br>
diethyl ether, or a mature of solvents, which may be removed in vacua or by freeze drying.<br>
The reaction may also be a metathetical process or it may be carried out on an ion exchange<br>
resin.<br>
Compounds of formulae (Ha) or (lib) and compounds of formula (Hla) or (lib) are either<br>
known in the literature or may be prepared using known methods that will be readily<br>
apparent to the man skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of the invention and intermediates thereto may be isolated from their reaction<br>
mixtures and, if necessary further purified, by using standard techniques.<br>
The compounds of formula (la) or (Ib) may exist in enantiomeric forms. Therefore, all<br>
enantiomers, diastereomers, racemates and mixtures thereof are included within the scope of<br>
the invention. The various optical isomers may be isolated by separation of a racemic<br>
mixture of the compounds using conventional techniques, for example, fractional<br>
crystallisation, or HPLC. Alternatively, the various optical isomers may be prepared .directly<br>
using optically active starting materials.<br>
Intermediate compounds may also exist in enantiomeric forms and may be used as purified<br>
enantiomers, diastereomers, racemates or mixtures.<br>
The compounds of formula (la) or (Ib), and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are useful<br>
because they possess pharmacological activity as inhibitors of the enzyme MPO.<br>
The compounds of formulae (la) and (Ib) and Iheir pharmaceutically acceptable salts are<br>
indicated for use in the treatment or prophylaxis of diseases or conditions in which<br>
modulation of the activity of the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) is desirable. In particular,<br>
linkage of MPO activity to disease has been implicated in neuroinflammatory diseases.<br>
Therefore the compounds of the present invention are particularly indicated for use in the<br>
treatment of neuroinflammatory conditions or disorders in mammals including man. Such<br>
conditions or disorders will be readily apparent to the man skilled in the art.<br>
Conditions or disorders that may be specifically mentioned include multiple sclerosis,<br>
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and stroke, as well<br>
as other inflammatory diseases or conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive<br>
pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, acute respiratory distress<br>
syndrome, sinusitis, rhinitis, psoriasis, dermatitis, uveitis, gingivitis, atherosclerosis,<br>
inflammatory bowel disease, renal glomerular damage, liver fibrosis, sepsis, proctitis,<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammation associated with reperfusion injury, spinal cord<br>
injury and tissue damage/scarrmg/adhesion/rejection. Lung cancer has also been suggested<br>
to be associated with high MPO levels. The compounds are also expected to be useful in<br>
the treatment of pain.<br>
Prophylaxis is expected to be particularly relevant to the treatment of persons who have<br>
suffered a previous episode of, or are otherwise considered to be at increased risk of, the<br>
disease or condition in question. Persons at risk of developing a particular disease or<br>
condition generally include those having a family history of the disease or condition, or<br>
those who have been identified by genetic testing or screening to be particularly<br>
susceptible to developing the disease or condition.<br>
For the above mentioned therapeutic indications, the dosage administered will, of course, vary<br>
with the compound employed, the mode of administration and the treatment desired.<br>
However, in general, satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds are administered<br>
at a dosage of the solid form of between 1 mg and 2000 mg per day.<br>
The compounds of formulae (la) or (Ib), and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof,<br>
may be used on their own, or in the form of appropriate pharmaceutical compositions in<br>
which the compound or derivative is in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
adjuvant, diluent or carrier. Thus, another aspect of the invention concerns a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising a novel compound of formula (la) or (Tb), or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof, in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or<br>
carrier. Administration' may be by, but is not limited to, enteral (including oral, sublingual<br>
or rectal), intranasal, inhalation, intravenous, topical or other parenteral routes.<br>
Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable pharmaceutical<br>
formulations are described in, for example, "Pharmaceuticals - The Science of Dosage<br>
Form Designs", M. E. Aulton, Churchill Livingstone, 1988. The pharmaceutical<br>
composition preferably comprises less than 80% and more preferably less than 50% of a<br>
compound of formulae (la) or (Ib), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
There is also provided a process for the preparation of such a pharmaceutical composition<br>
which comprises mixing the ingredients.<br>
The invention is illustrated, but in no way limited, by the following examples:<br>
!H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded either on a 300 MHz Bruker DPX instrument or on<br>
a Varian Unity 400 MHz spectrometer at 25 °C. The following reference signals were<br>

Screens<br>
Methods for the determination of MPO inhibitory activity are disclosed in co-pending patent<br>
application WO 02/090575. The pharmacological activity of compounds according to the<br>
invention was tested in the following screen:<br>
Assay buffer: 20 mM sodium/potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.5 containing 10 mM<br>
taurine and 100 mM NaCl.<br>
Developing reagent: 2 mM S^'^jS'-tetramethylbenzidine (1MB), 200 uM KI, 200 mM<br>
acetate buffer pH 5.4 with 20 % DMF.<br>
To 10 u.1 of diluted compounds in assay buffer, 40 ul of human MPO (final concentration<br>
2.5 nM) was added for 10 minutes at room temperature. Then 50 ul of H^ (final<br>
concentration 100 uM), or assay buffer alone as a control, were added for 10 minutes at<br>
room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 ul 0.2 mg/ml of catalase (final<br>
concentration 18 fig/ml) for 5 minutes before 100 ul of TMB developing reagent was<br>
added (2 mM TMB in 200 mM acetate buffer pH 5.4 containing 20% dimethylformamide<br>
(DMF) and 200 uM KI). Plates were mixed and the amount of oxidised<br>
3,3',5,5r-tef amethylbenzidine formed was then measured after about 5 minutes using<br>
absorbance spectroscopy at about 650 nM. ICso values were then determined using<br>
standard procedures.<br>
When tested in the above screen, the compounds of Examples 1 to 22 gave 1C 50 values of<br>
less than 60 joM, indicating that they are expected to show useful therapeutic activity.<br>
