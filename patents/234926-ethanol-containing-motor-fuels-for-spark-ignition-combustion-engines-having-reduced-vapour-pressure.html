ETHANOL-CONTAINING MOTOR FUELS FOR SPARK IGNITION COMBUSTION ENGINES HAVING REDUCED VAPOUR PRESSURE<br>
ANGELICA HULL, of Fjallvagen 3b, S-181 31 Lidingo, Sweden.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
This invention relates to motor fuel for spark ignition internal combustion engines. More particularly the invention relates to a method for lowering the dry vapour<br>
10	 pressure equivalent (DVPE) of a fuel composition including a hydrocarbon liquid and ethanol by using an oxygen-containing additive. The ethanol and DVPE adjusting components used to obtain the fuel composition are preferably derived from renewable raw materials. By means of the method of the invention motor fuels containing up to 20 % by volume of ethanol meeting standard requirements for spark<br>
15      ignition internal combustion engines operating with gasoline are obtainable.<br>
Background of the invention<br><br>
Gasoline is the major fuel for spark ignition internal combustion engines. The ex-<br>
  20    tensive use of gasoline results in the pollution of the environment. The combustion of gasoline derived from crude oil or mineral gas disturbs the carbon dioxide balance in the atmosphere, and causes the greenhouse effect. Crude oil reserves are decreasing steadily with some countries already facing crude oil shortages.<br>
25 	The growing concern for the protection of the environment, tighter requirements governing the content of harmful components in exhaust emissions, and crude oil shortages, force industry to develop urgently alternative fuels which burn more cleanly.<br>
30 	The existing global inventory of vehicles and machinery operating with spark ignition internal combustion engines does not allow currently the complete elimination of gasoline as a motor fuel.<br><br>
2<br>
The task of creating alternative fuels for internal combustion engines has existed for a long time and a large number of attempts have been made to use renewable resources for yielding motor fuel components.<br><br>
5	U.S. Patent No. 2,365,009, issued in 1944 describes the combination of C1-5, alcohols and <br>
C3-5 hydrocarbons for use as a fuel. In U.S. Patent No. 4,818,250 issued in 1989 it is proposed to use limonene obtained from citrus and other plants as a motor fuel, or as a component in blends with gasoline. In U.S. Patent No. 5,607,486 issued in 1997, there are disclosed novel engine fuel additives comprising terpenes, <br>
10       aliphatic hydrocarbons and lower alcohols.<br>
Currently tert-butyl ethers are widely used as components of gasolines. Motor fuels comprising tert-butyl ethers are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,468,233 issued in 1984. The major portion of these ethers is obtained from petroleum refining, but <br>
15      	can equally be produced from renewable resources.<br><br>
Ethanol is a most promising product for use as a motor fuel component in mixtures with gasoline. Ethanol is obtained from the processing of renewable raw material, known generically as biomass, which, in turn, is derived from carbon dioxide under <br>
20      the influence of solar energy.<br>
The combustion of ethanol produces significantly less harmful substances in comparison to the combustion of gasoline. However, the use of a motor fuel principally containing ethanol requires specially designed engines. At the same time spark igni-<br>
25 	tion internal combustion engines normally operating on gasoline can be operated with a motor fuel comprising a mixture of gasoline and not more than about 10 % by volume of ethanol. Such a mixture of gasoline and ethanol is presently sold in the United States as gasohol. Current European regulations concerning gasolines allow the addition to gasoline of up to 5 % by volume of ethanol.<br>
30<br>
The major disadvantage of mixtures of ethanol and gasoline is that for mixtures containing up to about 20 % by volume of ethanol there is an increase in the dry vapour pressure equivalent as compared to that of the original gasoline.<br><br>
3<br>
Figure 1 shows the behaviour of the dry vapour pressure equivalent (DVPE) as a function of the ethanol content of mixtures of ethanol and gasoline A92 summer, and gasoline A95 summer and winter at 37.8Â°C.The gasolines known as A92 and A95 are standard gasolines purchased at gas stations in the United States and <br>
5 	Sweden. Gasoline A92 originated in the United States and gasoline A95, in Sweden. The ethanol employed was fuel grade ethanol produced by Williams, USA. The DVPE of the mixtures was determined according to the standard ASTM D5191 method at the SGS laboratory in Stockholm, Sweden.<br>
10 	For the range of concentrations by volume of ethanol between 5 and 10% which is of particular interest for use as a motor fuel for standard spark ignition engines, the data in Fig. 1 show that the DVPE of mixtures of gasoline and ethanol can exceed the DVPE of source gasoline by more than 10%. Since the commercial petroleum companies normally supply the market with gasoline already at the maximum al-<br>
15 	lowed DVPE, which is strictly limited by current regulations, the addition of ethanol to such presently commercially available gasolines is not possible.<br>
It is known that the DVPE of mixtures of gasoline and ethanol can be adjusted. U.S. Patent No. 5,015,356 granted on May 14, 1991 proposes reformulating gasoline by<br>
20 	removing both the volatile and non-volatile components from C4 - C12 gasoline to yield either C6 - Cg or C6 - C10 intermediate gasoline. Such fuels are said to better facilitate the addition of alcohol over current gasoline because of their lower dry vapour pressure equivalent (DVPE). A disadvantage of this method of adjusting the DVPE of mixtures of gasoline and ethanol is that in order to obtain such a mixture<br>
25 	it is necessary to produce a special reformulated gasoline, which adversely affects the supply chain and results in increased prices for the motor fuel. Also, such gasolines and their mixtures with ethanol have a higher flash point, which impairs their performance properties.<br>
30 	It is known that some chemical components decrease DVPE when added to gasoline or to a mixture thereof with ethanol. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,433,756 granted on July 18, 1995 discloses chemical clean-combustion-promoter compounds comprising, in addition to gasoline, ketones, nitro-paraffin and also alcohols other than ethanol. It is noted that the composition of the catalytic clean-<br>
35      combustion-promoter disclosed in the patent reduces the DVPE of gasoline fuel.<br><br>
4<br>
Nothing is mentioned in this patent about the impact of the clean-combustion-promoter composition on the DVPE of mixtures of gasoline and ethanol.<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,688,295 granted on November 18, 1997 provides a chemical com-<br>
5 	pound as an additive to gasoline or as a fuel for standard gasoline engines. In accordance with the invention, an alcohol-based fuel additive is proposed. The fuel additive comprises from 20 - 70% alcohol, from 2.5 - 20% ketone and ether, from 0.03 - 20% aliphatic and silicon compounds, from 5 - 20% toluene and from 4 -45% mineral spirits. The alcohol is methanol or ethanol. It is noted in the patent <br>
10 	that the additive improves gasoline quality and specifically decreases DVPE. The disadvantages of this method of motor fuel DVPE adjustment are that there is a<br>
need for large quantities of the additive, namely, not less than 15 % by volume of the mixture; and the use of silicon compounds, which form silicon oxide upon combustion, results in increased engine wear.<br>
15<br>
In W09743356 a method for lowering the vapour pressure of a hydrocarbon-alcohol blend by adding a co-solvent for the hydrocarbon and alcohol to the blend, is described. A spark ignition motor fuel composition is also disclosed, including a hydrocarbon component of <br>
C5âC8 straight-chained or branched alkanes, essentially<br>
20 	free of olefins, aromatics, benzene and sulphur, in which the hydrocarbon component has a minimum anti-knock index of 65, according to ASTM D2699 and D2700 and a maximum DVPE of 15 psi, according to ASTM D5191; a fuel grade alcohol; and a co-solvent for the hydrocarbon component and alcohol in which the components of the fuel composition are present in amounts selected to provide a motor<br>
25 	fuel with a minimum anti-knock index of 87 and a maximum DVPE of 15 psi. The co-solvent used is biomass-derived 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) and other het-erocyclical ethers such as pyrans and oxepans, MTHF being preferred.<br><br>
The disadvantages of this method for adjusting the dry vapour pressure equivalent <br>
30      of mixtures of hydrocarbon liquid and ethanol are the following:<br>
(1) It is necessary to use only hydrocarbon components C5 - Cs which are straight-chained or branched alkanes (i) free of such unsaturated compounds as olefins, benzene and other aromatics, (ii) free of sulphur and, as follows from the descrip-<br><br>
5<br>
tion of the invention, (iii) the hydrocarbon component is a coal gas condensate or natural gas condensate;<br>
(2)	It is necessary to use as a co-solvent for the hydrocarbon component and etha-<br>
5      nol only one particular class of chemical compounds containing oxygen; namely,<br>
ethers, including short-chained and heterocyclic ethers;<br>
(3)	It is necessary to use a large quantity of ethanol in the fuel, not less than 25%;<br>
10      (4) It is necessary to use a large quantity of co-solvent, not less than 20%, of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran; and<br>
(5) It is required to modify the spark ignition internal combustion engine when operating with such fuel composition and, specifically, one must change the software <br>
15     	of the on-board computer or replace the on-board computer itself.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method by which the above-mentioned drawbacks of the prior art can be overcome. It is a primary object of the invention to provide a method of reducing the vapour pressure of a C3 <br>
20 	to C12 hydrocarbon based fuel mixture containing up to 20% by volume of ethanol for conventional gasoline engines to not more than the vapour pressure of the C3 to C12 hydrocarbon itself, or at least so as to meet the standard requirement on gasoline fuel.<br>
25      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The above-mentioned object of the present invention has been accomplished by means of a method of reducing the vapour pressure of a C3 to C12 hydrocarbon-based motor fuel mixture containing 0.1 to 20 % by volume of ethanol for conven-<br>
30 	tional spark ignition internal combustion engines, characterised in that, in addition to an ethanol component (b) and a C3 to C12 hydrocarbon component (a), an oxygen-containing additive (c) selected from at least one of the following types of compounds: alcohol other than ethanol, ketone, ether, ester, hydroxy-ketone, ketone ester, and a heterocyclic compound containing oxygen, is used in the fuel mixture<br>

6<br>
According to one embodiment of the above method the oxygen-containing additive (c) is added to the ethanol component (b) which mixture of (c) and (b) is subsequently added to the hydrocarbon component (a). <br>
5<br>

25 	According to a more restricted embodiment of the above method and embodiments the octane number of the thus-obtained fuel from (a), (b) and (c) is at least the same as that of (a) and/or meets the required standard limits for the octane number of commercially sold gasoline.<br>
30 	According to a more restricted embodiment of the above method and embodiments the C3 to C12 hydrocarbon mixture is selected from the group consisting of a non-reformulated, standard type of gasoline, a hydrocarbon liquid from petroleum refining, a hydrocarbon liquid from natural gas, a hydrocarbon liquid from an off-gas of chemical-recovery carbonisation, a hydrocarbon liquid from synthesis gas process-<br><br>
7<br>
ing or mixtures thereof, with a non-reformulated, standard type of gasoline being <br>
preferred.<br><br>
According to a more restricted embodiment of the above method and embodiments <br>
5 	denatured ethanol mixture as it is supplied to the market, containing about 92% by volume of ethanol, and the remaining to 100% by volume part is hydrocarbons and by-products, can be used in the fuel composition or in the composition of the fuel additive.<br>
10 	According to a more restricted embodiment of the above method and embodiments the ethanol component (b) used is at least about 99.5% ethanol by volume.<br>
According to a more restricted embodiment of the above method and embodiments no means for mixing are used and the motor fuel composition is permitted to stand <br>
15      for at least one hour prior to use.<br>
According to a more restricted embodiment of the above method and embodiments the additive is used in amounts up to 15 % by volume of the total fuel composition.<br>
20 	According to a more restricted embodiment of the above method and embodiments the fuel composition obtained exhibits the following characteristics;<br>
(i) a density at 15Â°C, according to ASTM D 4059 of at least 690 kg /m3<br>
(ii) an oxygen content according to ASTM D 4815 of no greater than 7% w/w;<br>
(iii) a dry vapour pressure equivalent according to ASTM D 5191 from 20 kPa <br>

(iv) an acids content according to ASTM D 1613 of no greater than 0.1 weight % HAc;<br>
(v) a pH according to ASTM D 1287 from 5 to 9;<br>
(vi) an aromatics content according to SS 155120 of no greater than 40 % by <br>

(xi) an anti-knock index 0.5 (RON+MON) according to ASTM D 2699-86 and ASTM  D 2700-86 of at least 80. <br>
10<br>
The present inventors have found that specific types of compounds exhibiting an oxygen-containing group surprisingly lower the vapour pressure of a gasoline-ethanol mixture.<br>
15     	This effect can unexpectedly be further enhanced by means of specific C6  C12 hydrocarbon compounds.<br><br>
They have also found that the octane number of the resulting hydrocarbon based fuel mixture surprisingly can be maintained or even increased by using the oxygen-<br>
20     	component of the present invention.<br><br>
According to the present method up to about 20 % by volume of fuel grade ethanol <br>
(b) can be used in the whole fuel compositions. The oxygen-containing additives (c) used can be obtained from renewable raw materials, and the hydrocarbon compo-<br>
25 	nent (a) used can for example be any standard gasoline (which does not have to be reformulated) and can optionally contain aromatic fractions and sulphur, and also hydrocarbons obtained from renewable raw materials.<br><br>
By means of the method of the invention fuels for standard spark ignition internal <br>
30 	combustion engines can be prepared, which fuels allow such engines to have the same maximum performance as when operated on standard gasoline currently on the market. A decrease in the level of toxic emissions in the exhaust and a decrease in the fuel consumption can also be obtained by using the method of the invention.<br><br>
9<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, in addition to the dry vapour pressure equivalent (DVPE), the anti-knock index (octane number) can also be desirably controlled.<br><br>
5	It is yet another object to provide an additive mixture of fuel grade ethanol (b) and oxygen-containing additive (c), and optionally, the further component (d), being individual hydrocarbons of the C6-C12 fraction or their mixtures, which additive mixture subsequently can be used in the inventive method, i.e., added to the hydrocarbon component (a). The mixture of (b) and (c), and optionally (d), can also be used <br>
10 	per se as a fuel for modified engines, i.e., not standard-type gasoline engines. The additive mixture can also be used for adjusting the octane number and/or for lowering the vapour pressure of a high vapour pressure hydrocarbon component.<br><br>
Further objects and advantages of the present invention will be evident from the <br>
15      	following detailed description, examples and dependent claims.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br><br>
In Figure 1, the behaviour of the dry vapour pressure equivalent (DVPE) as a func-<br>
20     	tion of the ethanol content of prior art mixtures of ethanol and gasoline is shown.<br>
In Figure 2, the behaviour of the dry vapour pressure equivalent (DVPE) of different fuels of the present invention as a function of the ethanol content thereof is shown.<br>
25      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The present method enables the use of C3 - C12 hydrocarbon fractions as hydrocarbon component (a), including narrower ranges within this broader range, without restriction on the presence of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, aromatics<br>
30 	and sulphur. In particular, the hydrocarbon component can be a standard gasoline currently on the market, as well as other mixtures of hydrocarbons obtained in the refining of petroleum, off-gas of chemical-recovery coal carbonisation, natural gas and synthesis gas. Hydrocarbons obtained from renewable raw materials can also be included. The C3-C12 fractions are usually prepared by fractional distillation or<br>
35      by blending various hydrocarbons.<br><br>
10<br>
Importantly, and as previously mentioned, the component (a) can contain aromatics<br>
 and sulphur, which are either co-produced or naturally found in the hydrocarbon <br>
component. <br>
5<br>
According to the method of the present invention the DVPE can be reduced for fuel mixtures containing up to 20% volume of ethanol, calculated as pure ethanol. According to a preferred embodiment the vapour pressure of the hydrocarbon based ethanol-containing fuel mixture is reduced by 50% of the ethanol-induced vapour<br>
10 	pressure increase, more preferably by 80%, and even more preferably the vapour pressure of the hydrocarbon based ethanol-containing fuel mixture is reduced to a vapour pressure corresponding to that of the hydrocarbon component alone, and/or to the vapour pressure according to any standard requirement on commercially sold gasoline.<br>
15<br>
As will be evident from the examples, the DVPE can be reduced if desired to a level even lower than that of the hydrocarbon component used.<br><br>
According to a most preferred embodiment the other properties of the fuel, such as <br><br>
20      	for example the octane number, are kept within the required standard limits.<br>
This is accomplished by adding to the motor fuel composition at least one oxygen-containing organic compound (c) other than ethanol. The oxygen-containing organic compound enables adjustment of (i) the dry vapour pressure equivalent, (ii) the <br>
25 	anti-knock index and other performance parameters of the motor fuel composition as well as (iii) the reduction of the fuel consumption and the reduction of toxic substances in the engine exhaust emissions. The oxygen-containing compound (c) has oxygen bound in at least any one of the following functional groups:<br><br>
11<br>
C-O-H	-C-       -C-O-C-       -C-O-C'<br>
O     H     H	OHO<br>
II      I       I	II      I      II              I<br>
c-c-c-	-c-c-c-o-c-<br>
II	I               I<br>
H     0- H	H<br><br>
/    x    /   cx    /C       I	C.     âC.<br>
/      n'     <br><br>
Such functional groups are present, for example, in the following classes of organic <br>
compounds and which can be used in the present invention: alcohols, ketones, <br>
5          ethers,   esters,   hydroxy-ketones,   ketone  esters,   and  heterocyclics  with   oxygen-<br>
containing rings.<br>
The fuel additive can be derived from fossil-based sources or preferably from renewable sources such as biomass.<br>
10<br>
The oxygen-containing fuel additive (c) can typically be an alcohol, other than etha-nol. In general, aliphatic or alicyclic alcohols, both saturated and unsaturated, preferably alkanols, are employed. More preferably, alkanols of the general formula: R-OH where R is alkyl with 3 to 10 carbon atoms, most preferably 3 to 8 carbon<br>
15 	atoms, such as propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, tert-butanol, n-pentanol, isopentanol, tert-pentanol, 4-methyl-2-pentanol, diethylcarbinol, diiso-propylcarbinol, 2-ethylhexanol, 2,4,4-trimethylpentanol, 2,6-dimethyl-4-heptanol, linalool, 3,6-dimethyl-3-octanol, phenol, phenylmethanol, methylphenol, methylcy-clohexanol or similar alcohols, are employed, as well as their mixtures.<br>
20<br>

Suitable fuel grade ethanol (b) to be used according to the present invention can readily be identified by the person skilled in the art. A suitable example of the ethanol component is ethanol containing 99.5% of the main substance. Any impurities <br>
5	included in the ethanol in an amount of at least 0.5 % by volume thereof and falling within the above-mentioned definition of component (c) should be taken into account when determining the amount used of component (c). That is, such impurities must be included in an amount of at least 0.5% in the ethanol in order to be taken into account as a part of component (c). Any water, if present in the ethanol, <br>
  10 	should preferably amount to no more than about 0.25 % by volume of the total fuel mixture, in order to meet the current standard requirements on fuels for gasoline engines.<br><br>
Thus, a denatured ethanol mixture as supplied to the market, containing about <br>

Unless otherwise indicated all amounts are in % by volume based on the total volume of the motor fuel composition.<br>
20<br>
Generally, the ethanol (b) is employed in amounts from 0.1% to 20%, typically from about 1% to 20 % by volume, preferably 3% to 15 % by volume and more preferably from about 5 to 10 % by volume. The oxygen-containing additive (c) is generally employed in amounts from 0.05% to about 15 % by volume, more generally from<br>
25      0.1 to about 15 % by volume, preferably from about 3 - 10 % by volume and most preferably from about 5 to 10 % by volume.<br><br>
In general, the total volume of ethanol (b) and oxygen-containing additive (c) employed is from 0.15 to 25 % by volume, normally from about 0.5 to 25 % by volume, <br>

25      used to adjust the octane number of the component (a) to a desired level by admixing a corresponding portion of the mixture (b), (c), (d) to component (a).<br><br>
As examples demonstrating the efficiency of the present invention the following motor fuel compositions are presented which are not to be construed as limiting the <br>
30      scope of the invention, but as merely providing illustrations of some of the presently preferred embodiments of this invention.<br>
As will be obvious to the person skilled in the art, all the fuel compositions of the following Examples can of course also be obtained by first preparing an additive<br><br>
18<br>
mixture of components (b) and (c), and optionally (d), which mixture thereafter can be added to the component (a), or vice versa. In this case a certain amount of mixing may be required.<br>
5       EXAMPLES<br>
To prepare the blended motor fuel the following was used as the components (b), (c), and (d):<br>
fuel grade ethanol purchased in Sweden at Sekab and in the USA from ADM<br>
10	Corp. and Williams;<br>
-oxygen-containing compounds, individual unsubstituted hydrocarbons and<br>
mixtures hereof purchased in Germany from Merck and in Russia from Lu-<br>

-Naphtha, which is an oil straight run gasoline containing aliphatic and ali-<br>
15	cyclic saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. Alkylate, which is a hydro-<br>
carbon fraction consisting almost completely of isoparaffine hydrocarbons obtained in alkylation of isobutene by butanol.

All the testing of source gasolines and ethanol-containing motor fuels, including those comprising the components of this invention was performed employing the standard ASTM methods at the laboratory of SGS in Sweden and at Auto Research <br>
25       Laboratories, Inc., USA.<br>
The drivability testing was performed on a 1987 VOLVO 240 DL according to the standard test method EU2000 NEDC EC 98/69.<br>
30 	The European 2000 (EU 2000) New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) standard test descriptions are identical to the standard EU/ECE Test Description and Driving Cycle (91/441 EEC resp. ECE-R 83/01 and 93/116 EEC). These standardised EU tests include city driving cycles and extra urban driving cycles and require that specific emission regulations be met. Exhaust emission analysis is conducted with<br>
35       a constant volume sampling procedure and utilises a flame ionisation detector for<br><br>
19<br>
hydrocarbon determination. Exhaust Emission Directive 91/441 EEC (Phase I) provides specific CO, (HC + NO) and (PM) standards, while EU Fuel Consumption Directive 93/116 EEC (1996) implements consumption standards.<br>
5 	The testing was performed on a 1987 Volvo 240 DL with a B230F, 4-cylinder, 2.32 litre engine (No. LG4F20-87) developing 83 kW at 90 revolutions/second and a torque of 185 Nm at 46 revolutions/second.<br>

25      	tained when other oxygen-containing compounds of this invention are substituted for the additives of the examples 1-1 to 1-10.<br><br>
To prepare the above fuel formulations 1-1 to 1-10 of this motor fuel composition, <br>
initially gasoline was mixed with ethanol and the corresponding oxygen-containing <br>
30 	additive was added to the fuel mixture. The motor fuel composition obtained was then allowed to stand before testing between 1 and 24 hours at a temperature not lower than -35Â°C. All the above formulations were prepared without the use of any mixing devices.<br><br>

The fuel compositions below demonstrate such a possibility.<br>
           An mixture comprising 50% of ethanol and 50% of isoamyl alcohol was in different<br>
10      proportions mixed with winter grade gasolines, the dry vapour pressure equivalent<br>
          (DVPE) of which does not exceed 90 kPa. All the resulting mixtures had the DVPE<br>
           not higher than that required by the regulations for winter gasoline, namely 90 kPa.<br>

Figure 2 shows the behavior of the dry vapour pressure equivalent (DVPE) as a function of the ethanol content when admixing the additive mixture 2 comprising 33.3% of ethanol and 66.7% of tert-pentanol with A95 winter gasoline. Figure 2 demonstrates that varying the ethanol content in gasoline within the range from 0<br>
30 	to 11% does not induce an increase of the vapour pressure for these compositions higher than the requirements of the standards for DVPE of the winter grade gasolines, which is 90 kPa.<br><br>

Similar DVPE behaviour was observed for A92 and A98 winter gasoline mixed with an additive mixture comprising 33.3 % by volume of ethanol and 66.7 % by volume of tert-pentanol.<br>

Example 2 demonstrates the possibility of reducing the dry vapour pressure equivalent of the ethanol-containing motor fuel for the cases when gasolines with a dry vapour pressure equivalent according to ASTM D-5191 at a level of 70 kPa (about 10 psi) are used as a hydrocarbon base. <br>

tained when other oxygen-containing additives of the invention are substituted for <br>
the additives of the examples 2-1 to 2-10.<br><br>
To prepare all the above fuel formulations 2-1 to 2-10 of this motor fuel composi-<br>
25 	tion, initially gasoline was mixed with ethanol, to which mixture was then added the corresponding oxygen-containing additive. The motor fuel composition obtained was then allowed to stand before testing between 1 and 24 hours at a temperature not lower than -35Â°C. All the above formulations were prepared without the use of any mixing devices.<br>

The use of an additive mixture comprising ethanol and oxygen-containing compounds other than ethanol for preparation of the ethanol-containing gasolines was accomplished with summer grade gasolines. The fuel compositions below demonstrate the possibility of obtaining the ethanol-containing gasolines to meet standard<br><br>
48<br>
requirements for summer grade gasolines, including vapour pressure of not higher than 70 kPa.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows the behaviour of the dry vapour pressure equivalent (DVPE) as a <br>
5 	function of the ethanol content when mixing summer A95 gasoline with the additive mixture 3 comprising 35 % by volume of ethanol , 5 % by volume of isoamyl alcohol, and 60 % by volume of naphtha boiling at temperatures between 100-170Â°C. Figure 2 demonstrates that varying the ethanol content in gasoline within the range from 0 to 20% does not induce an increase of the vapour pressure for these compo-<br>
10 	sitions higher than the requirements of the standards for DVPE of the summer grade gasolines, which is 70 kPa.<br><br>
Similar DVPE behaviour was observed for A92 and A98 summer gasoline mixed with an additive mixture comprising 35 % by volume of ethanol, 5 % by volume of <br>
15      	isoamyl alcohol, and 60 % by volume of naphtha boiling at 100-170Â°C.<br>
The ratio between ethanol and the oxygen-containing compound other than ethanol <br>
in the additive mixture, which is used for preparation of the ethanol-containing <br>
gasolines, is of substantial importance. The ratio between the components of the addi-<br>
20	 tive established by the present invention enables to adjust the vapour pressure of the ethanol-containing gasolines over a wide range.<br><br>

also C6-C12 hydrocarbons (d) of this invention were used in the ratio established by <br>
30 	this invention to prepare the additive mixture, which was then used for preparation of the ethanol-containing gasolines. These gasolines entirely meet the requirements for the motor fuels used in the standard spark ignition engines.<br><br>
Moreover, the additive mixture comprising ethanol and the oxygen-containing com-<br>
35     	pound of this invention other than ethanol with the ratio of the present invention<br><br>

can be used as an independent motor fuel for the engines adapted for operation on <br>

The foregoing examples demonstrate the possibility of a partial lowering of the <br>
excess vapour pressure by about 80% of the excess vapour pressure of gasoline in-<br>
20      duced by the presence of ethanol in the mixture.<br>
Figure 2 shows the behaviour of the dry vapour pressure equivalent (DVPE) as a function of the ethanol content in the mixtures of US summer A92 gasoline and the additive mixture 4 comprising 35 % by volume of ethanol, 1 % by volume of isoamyl<br>
25      alcohol, 0.2- % by volume of isobutanol, 43.8 % by volume of naphtha boiling at temperatures between 100-170Â°C, and 20% of isopropyl toluene. Figure 2 demonstrates that employment of this additive mixture in formulation of ethanol-containing gasoline enables the reduction of more than 100% of the excess vapour pressure induced by the presence of ethanol.<br>

Similar results for DVPE were obtained for US summer grade A95 and A98 gasoline mixed with the additive mixture composed of 35 % by volume of ethanol, 1 % by volume of isoamyl alcohol, 0.2 % by volume of isobutanol, 43.8 % by volume of<br>
naphtha boiling at 100-170Â°C and 20% by volume of isopropyltoluene.<br><br>

Similar results were obtained when other oxygen-containing compounds and C6-C12 hydrocarbons of this invention were used in the proportion established by this invention to formulate the additive mixture, which was then used for preparation of <br>
5 	the ethanol-containing gasolines. These gasolines entirely meet the requirements for the motor fuels used in standard internal combustion spark ignition engines.<br><br>
Moreover, the additive mixture comprising ethanol, the oxygen-containing compound other than ethanol, and C6-C12 hydrocarbons in the proportion and composi-<br>
10      tion of the present invention, can be used as an independent motor fuel for the engines adopted for operation on ethanol.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>

20 	To prepare the mixtures of this composition lead-free winter gasoline A92, A95, and A98 purchased in Sweden from Shell, Statoil, Q8OK and Preem and gas condensate (GK) purchased in Russia from Gazprom were used.<br><br>
The hydrocarbon component (HCC) for the motor fuel compositions was prepared <br>
25      by mixing about 85 % by volume of winter A92, A95 or A98 gasoline with about 15 <br>
           % by volume of gas condensate hydrocarbon liquid (GC).<br><br>
To prepare the hydrocarbon component (HCC) for the fuel formulations 4-1 to 4-10 <br>
of this motor fuel composition, about 85 % by volume of winter A92, A95 or A98 <br>
30 	gasoline was first mixed with the gas condensate hydrocarbon liquid (GC). The <br>
obtained hydrocarbon component (HCC) was then allowed to stand for 24 hours. The <br>
resulting gasoline contained aliphatic and alicyclic C3-C12 hydrocarbons, including saturated and unsaturated ones.<br><br>

To prepare all the above fuel formulations 4-1 to 4-10 of this motor fuel composition, <br>
the hydrocarbon component (HCC), which is a mixture of winter gasoline and <br>
gas condensate (GC), was initially mixed with ethanol, to which mixture then was <br>
added the corresponding oxygen-containing additive and C6-C12 hydrocarbons. The <br>

were prepared without the use of any mixing devices.<br><br>

containing gasolines, the vapour pressure of which does not exceed the vapour<br>
pressure of the source hydrocarbon component (HCC).<br><br>

Similar results were obtained when other oxygen-containing compounds and C6-C12 <br>
30	hydrocarbons of this invention were used in the proportion of the invention to formulate <br>
the additive mixture, which was then used for preparation of the ethanol-containing gasolines.<br><br>
These gasoline mixtures of the invention have a vapour pressure equivalent (DVPE) <br>
35      which does not exceed the DVPE of the source hydrocarbon component (HCC). At<br><br>
76<br>
the same time it is possible to add the oxygen-containing additive only in the amount sufficient to obtain the ethanol-containing gasoline entirely in compliance with<br>

EXAMPLE 5<br>
Example 5 demonstrates the possibility of reducing the dry vapour pressure equivalent of the ethanol-containing motor fuel for the cases when the hydrocarbon base <br>
10      of the fuel is a reformulated gasoline with dry vapour pressure equivalent according to ASTM D-5191 at a level of 27.5 kPa (about 4 psi).<br>
To prepare the mixtures of this composition lead-free reformulated gasoline purchased in Sweden from Preem  and in Russia from Lukoil, and the  Petroleum ben-<br>
15      zine purchased from Merck in Germany were used.<br>
The hydrocarbon component (HCC) for the motor fuel compositions was prepared by mixing about 85 % by volume of winter A92, A95 or A98 gasoline with about 15 % by volume of gas condensate hydrocarbon liquid (GC). <br>
20<br>
The source gasolines comprised aliphatic and alicyclic C6-C12 hydrocarbons, including saturated and unsaturated.<br><br>

To prepare all the above fuel formulations 5-1 to 5-10 of this motor fuel composition, initially the hydrocarbon component (HCC) which is a mixture of reformulated gasoline and Petroleum benzine (PB) was mixed with ethanol, to which mixture then was added the corresponding oxygen-containing additive and C6-C12 hydrocarbons.<br>
20 	The motor fuel composition obtained was then allowed to stand before testing between 1 and 24 hours at a temperature not lower than -35Â°C. All the above formulations were prepared without the use of any mixing devices.<br><br>
The invention demonstrated the possibility of adjusting the vapour pressure of the <br>
25	ethanol-containing motor fuels for the standard internal combustion spark ignition <br>
engines based on non-standard gasolines having a low vapour pressure.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows the behaviour of the dry vapour pressure equivalent (DVPE) when <br>
mixing the hydrocarbon component (HCC), comprising 80 % by volume of reformu-<br>
30 	lated A92 gasoline and 20 % by volume of Petroleum benzine, with the oxygen-<br>
containing additive mixture 5, comprising 40 % by volume of ethanol, 20 % by volume <br>
of 3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexanone, and 20 % by volume of naphtha with boiling<br>
temperature 130-170Â°C and 20 % by volume of tert-butyltoluene. The graph <br>
demonstrates that the use of the additive of this invention enables obtaining ethanol-<br><br>
85<br>
containing gasolines, the vapour pressure of which does not exceed the vapour pressure of the source hydrocarbon component (HCC).<br>
Similar  DVPE  behaviour  was   demonstrated  when  mixing  the   above   oxygen-<br>
5	containing additive with hydrocarbon component (HCC) comprising 20 % by volume<br>
 of Petroleum benzine (GC) and 80 % by volume of A95 or A98 reformulated gasoline.<br><br>
Similar results were obtained when other oxygen-containing compounds and C6-C12 hydrocarbons of this invention were used in the proportion of the invention to for-<br>
10      	mulate the oxygen-containing additive, which was then used for preparation of the ethanol-containing gasolines.<br>
These gasolines have a vapour pressure equivalent (DVPE) not higher than the DVPE of the source hydrocarbon component (HCC). At the same time the anti-<br>
15       knock index for all ethanol-containing gasolines prepared in accordance with this invention   was higher than that of the source hydrocarbon component (HCC).<br><br>
