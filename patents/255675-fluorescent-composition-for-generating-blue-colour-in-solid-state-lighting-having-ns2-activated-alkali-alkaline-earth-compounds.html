				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>With the advent of GaN technology LEDs emitting around 390 nm have become available. These diodes are coated with phosphor blend, which on excitation by 390 nm emit in white. During last decade solid state lighting has emerged as a new area. The UV LED approach starts with a w-{/K(near UV)-emitting LED chip that energies phosphors designed to emit light in the visible spectrum by the phosphors. The colour mixing approach starts with discrete coloured sources and uses colour mixing optics to blend together the light output from these sources to create white light emission. We have developed new, highly intense blue emitting phosphors for n-UV diodes. They have not been patented so far. These phosphors will serve as indigenous replacement for blue component of phosphor blend for n-UV LED lamps. Our search for new, henceforth unreported phosphors led us to very efficient blue emitting ns2 doped Alkali-Alkaline Earth oxides, with a general formula I^a.^^yns2^)where, M1: Any one or two alkaline earth metals from Ca, Sr or Ba A/&quot;: Any alkali metal from Li or K ns2: Activator, any one metal out of Pb or Bi x: a fraction between 0.02-0.001. y: a fraction between 0-0.005</td>
