Use of anionically and cationically ampholytic copolymers<br>
Description<br>
The following invention relates to the use of anionically ampholytic and cationically ampholytic copolymers as rheology modifiers for hair cosmetic compositions.<br>
Specific requirements are often placed on hair cosmetic compositions with regard to their rheological properties. They can often only be converted to the desired application form using additives, so-called "thickeners". Examples of customary low-molecular weight thickeners are, for example, the alkali metal and aluminum salts of fatty acids, fatty alcohols or waxes. However, depending on the field of use of the preparation to be thickened, use of the known thickeners is often associated with disadvantages. For example, the thickening effect of the thickeners may not be satisfactory, their use may be undesired or their incorporation into the preparation to be thickened may be hindered or completely impossible, for example due to their incompatibility with the compound to be thickened. The provision of products with a complex profile of properties using the lowest possible fraction or the fewest possible different active substances often presents difficulties. Thus, for example, there is a need for polymers for hair cosmetic compositions which allow the rheological properties of the compositions to be adjusted and which additionally have good film-forming properties. In addition, esthetic requirements are increasingly being placed on hair cosmetic products by the consumer. Thus, with such products, a preference for clear, opaque formulations in the form of gels is currently observed. A further advantageous property of polymers for hair cosmetic formulations is the ability to be converted into a solid form, in particular a powder and nevertheless be capable of being incorporated into a composition to be thickened within a short time and thereby reliably provide the desired rheological properties.<br>

US 2006/0084586 A1 describes rheology-modifying hair-setting resins which comprise a crosslinked copolymer based on vinylamide and carboxylic acid monomers. Polymers which are obtainable by free-radical polymerization in the presence of at least one silicone compound having a polyether group and/or a free-radically polymerizable double bond are not described. Polymers which comprise at least one cationic compound which is chosen from N-vinylimidazole compounds, N-[3-(dimethylamino)-propyl]acrylamide, N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]methacrylamide and mixtures thereof in copolymerized form are likewise not described.<br>
There is also a need for thickeners for hair cosmetic compositions with improved properties. Thus, the anionic thickeners based on acrylic acid, such as the corresponding carbopols, currently still used most often for these applications have a number of disadvantages. They are themselves not capable of film formation, meaning<br><br>
that, to prepare compositions with a setting effect, the use of relatively large amounts of film-forming polymers is always required. However, since anionic thickeners based on acrylic acid are incompatible with a large number of polyelectrolytes, suitable formulation partners are predominantly only nonionic polymers. Thus, a large number of products with interesting application properties, such as, for example, gels based on cationic polymers, cannot be prepared at all.<br>
In particular, there is a need for polymeric thickeners for hair cosmetic compositions which are suitable for formulating gel-like preparations. These should combine as many of the following properties as possible:<br>
the gels obtained should be as clear as possible,<br>
they should be able to be distributed easily in the hair and nevertheless provide<br>
good hold, which can be achieved particularly well by gels with thixotropic<br>
properties,<br>
they should themselves have film-forming properties and thus contribute to the<br>
setting of the hair,<br>
they should have conditioning properties and improve the sensory properties of<br>
the hair, e.g. impart suppleness and shine to it and not be sticky, or only be sticky<br>
to a small degree, after drying,<br>
the hair treated with the gel should have good wet combability (the freshly treated<br>
hair can thus be readily shaped using the comb in order to form the desired<br>
hairstyle),<br>
ability to formulate gels in as many cosmetically acceptable pH ranges as<br>
possible, especially in a pH range of from about 3 to 9,<br>
the ability to formulate gels with properties which can be switched in a targeted<br>
manner via the pH value.<br>
in addition, polymers for use as rheology modifiers for cosmetic compositions for treating hair should be able to be readily converted to a solid form, preferably a powder, which can be incorporated easily into the formulations to be thickened.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved through the use of an ampholytic copolymer which has a molar excess of anionogenic/anionic groups compared with cationogenic/cationic groups or which has a molar excess of cationogenic/cationic groups compared with anionogenic/anionic groups and which is obtainable by free-radical copolymerization of<br>
a1)    at least one compound with a free-radically polymerizable, α,β-Ethylenically<br>
unsaturated double bond and at least one anionogenic and/or anionic group per<br><br>
molecule,<br>
a2)    at least one compound with a free-radically polymerizable, α,β-ethylenically<br>
unsaturated double bond and at least one cationogenic and/or cationic group per molecule,<br>
b)	at least one free-radically polymerizable crosslinking compound which comprises at least two α,β-ethylenically unsaturated double bonds per molecule,<br>
c)	if appropriate in the presence of at least one silicone compound comprising a polyether group and/or a free-radically polymerizable olefinically unsaturated double bond,<br>
as rheology modifier for hair cosmetic compositions.<br>
Copolymers which have a molar excess of anionogenic/anionic groups compared with cationogenic/cationic groups are also referred to as anionic ampholytic copolymers within the scope of the invention. Copolymers which have a molar excess of cationogenic/cationic groups compared with anionogenic/anionic groups are also referred to as cationic ampholytic copolymers within the scope of the invention.<br>
In a first embodiment, copolymers free from silicone groups are used for the use according to the invention. Of suitability for this purpose are all of the copolymers described in the German patent application 10 2005 034 412.7 which have a molar excess of anionogenic/anionic groups compared with cationogenic/cationic groups or which have a molar excess of cationogenic/cationic groups compared with anionogenic/anionic groups. The disclosure of this document is hereby incorporated with regard to these copolymers in its entirety by reference.<br>
In a second embodiment, copolymers containing silicone groups are used for the use according to the invention. Of suitability for this are all of the copolymers described in the German patent application 10 2005 034 906.4 which have a molar excess of anionogenic/anionic groups compared with cationogenic/cationic groups or which have a molar excess of cationogenic/cationic groups compared with anionogenic/anionic groups. The disclosure of this document with regard to these copolymers is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference.<br>
The use of an ampholytic copolymer which has a molar excess of anionogenic/anionic groups is described in the German priority application 10 2005 046 918.3. The use of an ampholytic copolymer which has a molar excess of cationogenic/cationic groups is<br><br>
described in the German priority application 10 2005 046 916.7. This disclosure is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference.<br>
The copolymers A) to be used according to the invention can be prepared by conventional polymerization processes, e.g. by solution polymerization or bulk polymerization. Copolymers with particularly advantageous properties, i.e. with generally higher molecular weights and a better ability to form pulverulent formulations than are obtained by conventional polymerization processes are obtained by the preparation in accordance with the method of precipitation polymerization. A preferred embodiment of the invention is therefore the use of copolymers which are obtainable by free-radical copolymerization by the method of precipitation polymerization in at least one organic solvent. In a specific embodiment, for the preparation of the copolymers used according to the invention, at least two free radical initiators are used whose decomposition temperatures and/or whose half-lives at a certain polymerization temperature are different from one another. Here, copolymers with particularly low residual monomer contents can be achieved. This is the case particularly if the initiator decomposing at the higher temperature is added before completion, preferably before the start of the precipitation of the polymer.<br>
In the precipitation polymerization, the monomers used are soluble in the reaction medium (monomer, solvent), but the corresponding polymer is not. The polymer which forms becomes insoluble under the polymerization conditions chosen and precipitates out of the reaction mixture. In the process it is possible to obtain anionogenic/anionic ampholytic copolymers with molecular weights which are higher than those obtainable by other polymerization processes, e.g. by solution polymerization, which are particularly advantageously suitable as rheology modifiers (specifically thickeners).<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the expression alkyl comprises straight-chain and branched alkyl groups. Suitable short-chain alkyl groups are, for example, straight-chain or branched C1-C7-alkyl groups, preferably C1-C6-alkyl groups and particularly preferably C1-C4-alkyl groups. These include, in particular, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, 2-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, 1-methylbutyl, 2-methylbutyl, 3-methylbutyl, 1,2-dimethylpropyl, 1,1-dimethylpropyl, 2,2-dimethyl-propyl, 1-ethylpropyl, n-hexyl, 1-methylpentyl, 2-methylpentyl, 3-methyIpentyl, 4-methylpentyl, 1,2-dimethylbutyl, 1,3-dimethylbutyl, 2,3-dimethylbutyl, 1,1-dimethylbutyl, 2,2-dimethylbutyl, 3,3-dimethylbutyl, 1,1,2-trimethylpropyl, 1,2,2-trimethylpropyl. 1-ethylbutyl. 2-ethylbutyl, 1-ethyl-2-methylpropyl, n-heptyl, 2-heptyl, 3-heptyl, 2-ethylpentyl, 1-propylbutyl. octyl etc.<br><br>
Suitable longer-chain C8-C30-alkyI groups and C8-C30-alkenyl groups are straight-chain and branched alkyl groups and alkenyl groups. Preference is given here to predominantly linear alkyl radicals as also occur in natural or synthetic fatty acids and fatty alcohols and in oxo alcohols, which may, if appropriate, additionally be mono-, di-or polyunsaturated. These include, for example, n-hexyl(ene), n-heptyl(ene), n-octyl(ene), n-nonyl(ene), n-decyl(ene), n"Undecyl(ene), n-dodecyl(ene), n-tridecyl(ene), n-tetradecyl(ene), n-pentadecyl(ene), n-hexadecyl(ene), n-heptadecyl(ene), n-octadecyl(ene), n-nonadecyi(ene), arachinyl(ene), behenyl(ene), lignocerinyl(ene), melissinyl(ene), etc.<br>
CycloalkyI is preferably C5-C8-cycloalkyl, such as cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl or cyclooctyl.<br>
Aryl comprises unsubstituted and substituted aryl groups and is preferably phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, mesityl, naphthyl, fluorenyl, anthracenyl, phenanthrenyl, naphthacenyl and in particular phenyl, tolyl, xylyl or mesityl.<br>
In the text below, compounds which are derived from acrylic acid and methacrylic acid may sometimes be referred to in short by adding the syllable "(meth)" to the compound derived from acrylic acid.<br>
The copolymers used according to the invention can advantageously be formulated as gels under normal conditions (20°C). "Gel-like consistency" is shown by formulations which have a higher viscosity than a liquid and which are self-supporting, i.e. which retain a shape imparted to them without a shape-stabilizing covering. In contrast to solid formulations, gel-like formulations can, however, easily be deformed under the application of shear forces. The viscosity of the gel-like compositions is preferably in a range from greater than 600 to about 60 000 mPas, particularly preferably from 6000 to 30 000 mPas. The gels are preferably hair gels.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, water-soluble monomers and polymers are understood as meaning monomers and polymers which dissolve in water at 20°C in an amount of at least 1 g/l. Water-dispersible monomers and polymers are understood as meaning monomers and polymers which disintegrate into dispersible particles under the application of shear forces, for example by stirring. Hydrophilic monomers are preferably water-soluble or at least water-dispersible. The copolymers used according to the invention are generally water-soluble.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, "modification of rheological properties" is understood in the broad sense. Thus, the copolymers used according to the invention<br><br>
are generally suitable for thickening the consistency of liquid compounds within a wide range. Depending on the basic consistency of the liquid compound(s), flow properties from low viscosity to solid (no longer flowable) are generally achieved depending on the amount of copolymer used. "Modification of Theological properties" is therefore understood as meaning, inter alia, the increase in the viscosity of liquids, the improvement of the thixotropy properties of gels, the solidification of gels and waxes etc.<br>
The ampholytic copolymers used according to the invention have both anionogenic and/or anionic groups and also cationogenic and/or cationic groups. For their preparation, the oppositely charged/chargeable monomers a1) and a2) can be used together, i.e. in the form of a monomer pair ("monomer salt"). In this monomer composition, the molar ratio of anionogenic and anionic groups of component a1) to cationogenic and cationic groups of component a2) is about 1 :1 (i.e. monovalent monomers are essentially used in equimolar amounts). The monomer pairs can be prepared separately prior to being used for the polymerization. However, preference is given to the "in situ" preparation of the monomer pairs through joint use (e.g. joint feed) during the preparation of the copolymers.<br>
Preferably, the fraction in the monomer pair of the compounds used for the polymerization is at least 1% by weight, preferably at least 2% by weight, in particular at least 3% by weight.<br>
Preferably, the copolymers have a significant excess of anionogenic/anionic groups compared with cationogenic/cationic groups. In a specific embodiment, monomers with ionogenic or ionic groups are used for the copolymerization in amounts such that the copolymer has a molar excess of anionogenic/anionic groups compared with cationogenic/cationic groups or a molar excess of cationogenic/cationic groups compared with anionogenic/anionic groups of at least 1.2:1, particularly preferably at least 1.4:1, in particular at least 2:1, specifically at least 2.5:1.<br>
Monomer a1)<br>
The copolymers used according to the invention comprise, as compound a1), at least one compound with a free-radically polymerizable α,β-Ethylenically unsaturated double bond and with at least one anionogenic and/or anionic group per molecule in copolymerized form. The component a1) can be used in an amount of from 0.1 to 96% by weight, such as, for example, 0.5 to 90% by weight, based on the total weight of the compounds used for the polymerization. In the case of anionically ampholytic copolymers the component a1) is preferably used in an amount of from 2 to 70% by<br><br>
weight, preferably 3 to 60% by weight, based on the total weight of the compounds used for the polymerization (i.e. components a1), a2), b), c) and, if present, d) to g)). In the case of cationicaily ampholytic copolymers the component a1) is preferably used in an amount of from 0.2 to 35% by weight, preferably 0.5 to 25% by weight, based on the total weight of the compounds used for the polymerization (i.e. components a1), a2), b), c) and, if present, d) to g)).<br>
Preferably, the compounds a1) are chosen from monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids, sulfonic acids, phosphonic acids and mixtures thereof.<br>
The monomers a1) include monoethylenically unsaturated mono- and dicarboxylic acids having 3 to 25, preferably 3 to 6, carbon atoms, which can also be used in the form of their salts or anhydrides.

In a first embodiment, the free-radical copolymerization to prepare the copolymers containing silicone groups takes place in the presence of at least one polyether-containing silicone compound c) which does not comprise α,β-Ethylenically unsaturated<br><br>

The copolymers containing silicone groups according to the invention comprise, quite generally, the process products of the free-radical copolymerization, which is understood as meaning, for example, pure graft polymers, mixtures of graft polymers with ungrafted compounds of the component c), copolymers of the abovementioned monomers, and any mixtures.<br><br><br>

In a specific embodiment, all of the abovementioned cationic copolymers containing silicone groups are subjected to partial or complete quaternization. Suitable quaternizing agents are those specified below. A particularly preferred quaternizing agent is CH3-CI.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the free-radical copolymerization of the abovementioned components a1), a2), b) and, if present, d) to g) is carried out in the presence of at least one polyether-containing compound which has no copolymerizable double bond. Here, specific copolymers having advantageous properties are obtained. This can be attributed, for example, to the effect of the polyether component as protective colloid or emuisifier. This can, for example, also result from an at least partial grafting onto the<br><br>
polyether component as graft base. However, mechanisms other than grafting are also conceivable. The copolymers used according to the invention comprise, quite generally, the process products of the free-radical copolymerization, which are understood as meaning, for example, pure graft polymers, mixtures of graft polymers with ungrafted compounds of the polyether component, and any desired mixtures.<br>
Preferably, the amount of polyether component used (if present) is 0.1 to 50% by weight, particularly preferably 1 to 25% by weight, based on the total weight of the components used for the polymerization.<br>
Suitable polyether-containing compounds are, for example, water-soluble or water-dispersible nonionic polymers which have alkylene oxide repeat units. The fraction of alkylene oxide repeat units is preferably at least 30% by weight, based on the total weight of the compound. Suitable polyether-containing compounds are, for example, polyalkylene glycols, as are usually also used as nonionic surfactants. Suitable polyalkylene glycols generally have a number-average molecular weight in the range from about 150 to 100 000, preferably 300 to 50 000, particularly preferably 500 to 40 000. Suitable polyalkylene glycols are, for example, polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, polytetrahydrofurans and alkylene oxide copolymers. Suitable alkylene oxides for the preparation of alkylene oxide copolymers are, for example, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, epichlorohydhn, 1,2- and 2,3-butylene oxide. The alkylene oxide copolymers can comprise the copolymerized alkylene oxide units in random distribution or in the form of blocks. Advantageously, homopolymers of ethylene oxide or copolymers which comprise ethylene oxide are used. Preferably, the fraction of repeat units derived from ethylene oxide is 40 to 99% by weight. Of suitability are, for example, copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, copolymers of ethylene oxide and butylene oxide, and copolymers of ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and at least one butylene oxide.<br>
The copolymers used according to the invention are prepared in accordance with customary processes known to the person skilled in the art, e.g. by solution polymerization, precipitation polymerization, suspension polymerization or emulsion polymerization. The WA'V polymerization in water with a suitable displacing agent, e.g. a salt, such as NaCI, is also suitable.<br>
Preferred solvents for the solution polymerization are aqueous solvents, such as water and mixtures of water with water-miscible solvents, for example alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, sec-butanol, tert-butanol, n-hexanol and cyclohexanol, and glycols, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and butylene glycol, and the methyl or ethyl ethers of the dihydric alcohols, diethylene<br><br>
glycol, triethylene glycol, polyethylene glycols with number-average molecular weights up to about 3000, glycerol and dioxane. Particular preference is given to the polymerization in water or a water/alcohol mixture, for example in a water/ethanol mixture. The polymerization temperatures in the case of solution polymerization are preferably in a range from about 30 to 120°C, particularly preferably 40 to 100°C.<br>
The copolymers are particularly preferably prepared by precipitation polymerization.<br>
The precipitation polymerization is preferably carried out in a largely anhydrous, aprotic solvent or solvent mixture, preferably in ethyl acetate and/or n-butyl acetate. A largely anhydrous, aprotic solvent or solvent mixture is understood as meaning a solvent or solvent mixture with a water content of at most 5% by weight.<br>
The precipitation polymerization preferably takes place at a temperature in the range from 70 to 140°C, preferably 75 to 100°C, in particular from 80 to 95°C. The resulting polymer particles precipitate out of the reaction solution and can be isolated by customary methods, such as filtration using subatmospheric pressure. For the precipitation polymerization it is possible to use surface-active, polymeric compounds, preferably based on polysiloxanes. In the case of precipitation polymerization, the polymers obtained usually have higher molecular weights than those in the case of solution polymerization.<br>
The polymerization is usually carried out under atmospheric pressure, although it can also proceed under reduced or elevated pressure. A suitable pressure range is between 1 and 5 bar.<br>
To prepare the polymers, the monomers can be polymerized with the help of initiators which form free radicals.<br>
Initiators for the free-radical polymerization which can be used are the peroxo and/or azo compounds customary for this purpose, for example alkali metal or ammonium peroxydisulfates, diacetyl peroxide, dibenzoyl peroxide, succinyl peroxide, di-tert-butyl peroxide, tert-butyl perbenzoate, tert-butyl perpivalate, tert-butyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate, tert-butyl permaleate, cumene hydroperoxide, diisopropyl peroxydicarbamate, bis-(o-toioyl) peroxide, didecanoyi peroxide, dioctanoyi peroxide, dilauroyl peroxide, tert-butyl perisobutyrate, tert-butyl peracetate, di-tert-amyl peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, azobisisobutyronitrile, azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride or 2,2'-azobis(2-methylbutyronitrile). Also suitable are initiator mixtures or redox initiator systems, such as, for example, ascorbic acid/iron(ll) sulfate/sodium<br><br>
peroxodisulfate, tert-butyl hydroperoxide/sodium disulfite, tert-butyl hydroperoxide/sodium hydroxymethanesulfinate, H2O2/Cu1.<br>
In a specific embodiment, for the preparation of the copolymers according to the invention, at least two free radical initiators are used which permit an essentially independent initiation in at least two phases. Here, copolymers with particularly low residual monomer contents can be achieved.<br>
Preferably, for the copoiymerization, at least two initiators are used whose decomposition temperatures are different from one another by at least 10'C. Within the scope of the invention, the decomposition temperature is defined as the temperature at which 50% of the molecules decompose into free radicals within 2.5 hours. Preferably, in the case of this procedure, the copoiymerization takes place until conclusion of the precipitation of the copolymer at a temperature greater than or equal to the lower decomposition temperature and less than the higher decomposition temperature, and, after the precipitation, a further reaction takes place at a temperature greater than or equal to the higher decomposition temperature.<br>
Preferably, the method according to the invention comprises a first polymerization phase at a first polymerization temperature and a second polymerization phase at a second polymerization temperature above the first polymerization temperature, where, for the polymerization, at least two initiators are used whose half-lives at the first polymerization temperature differ in such a way that at least one of these initiators decomposes into free radicals during the first polymerization phase and at least one of these initiators essentially does not decompose into free radicals during the first polymerization phase and decomposes into free radicals during the second polymerization phase. Preferably, in the case of this procedure, the second polymerization phase starts essentially after precipitation of the copolymer, "essentially" after precipitation of the copolymer is understood as meaning that the copolymer is preferably present to at least 80% by weight, preferably at least 90% by weight, in particular at least 95% by weight, based on the total weight of the copolymer, in precipitated form.<br>
The half-life of an initiator can be determined by customary methods known to the person skilled in the art, as described, for example, in the publication "Initiators for high polymers", Akzo Nobel, No. 10737. Preferably, the half-life of the first polymerization initiator at the first polymerization temperature and of the second polymerization initiator at the second polymerization temperature is in a range from about 1 minute to 3 hours, particularly preferably 5 minutes to 2.5 hours. If desired, shorter half-lives of, for example, 1 second to 1 minute, or longer half-lives than 3 hours can also be used<br><br>
provided it is ensured that the initiator(s) decomposing at the higher temperature essentially decomposes into free radicals during the second polymerization phase.<br>
In addition to the first and second polymerization phase, further polymerization phases at poiymenzation temperatures different therefrom can be used. Thus, it is, for example, possible to carry out a first polymerization phase at a first polymerization temperature which is chosen such that controlled polymerization (i.e. e.g. with avoidance of an undesired temperature increase as a result of the heat of reaction, of an excessively high reaction rate, etc.) takes place. An afterpolymerization can then, for example, follow at a temperature which is above the first polymerization temperature but below the second and which is chosen so that the initiator(s) decomposing at the higher temperature do not essentially decompose into free radicals. Following completion of this afterpolymerization, to which, if desired, the initiator decomposing at the lower temperature and/or another initiator decomposing under the conditions of the afterpolymerization can also be added, the second polymerization phase can then follow.<br>
Preferably, the initiator system used comprises at least two initiators whose decomposition temperatures differ from one another by at least tS^C.<br>
The initiator decomposing at the lower temperature preferably has a decomposition temperature of from 50 to 100°C.<br>
The initiator decomposing at the higher temperature preferably has a decomposition temperature of from 80 to 150°C.<br>
Preferably, the initiator decomposing at the higher temperature is initially introduced at the start of the copolymerization or is added before or during the precipitation of the copolymer.<br>
Preferably, the initiator decomposing at the higher temperature is initially introduced at the start of the copolymerization or is added before the precipitation of the copolymer.<br>
In a preferred initiator combination, the initiator decomposing at the lower temperature is Trigonox® EHP (bis{2-ethylhexyl)peroxydicarbonate, CAS-No. 16111-62-9) and the initiator decomposing at the higher temperature is chosen from tert-butyl peroxypivalate (e.g. Luperox 11 M75 from Atochem), tert-butyl peroctoate, lauroyl peroxide (LPO, CAS-No. 105-74-8) or 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-bis(t-butylperoxy)hexane (Trigonox® 101).<br><br>
A further preferred initiator combination comprises Trigonox® EHP and tert-butyl peroctoate.<br>
A further preferred initiator combination comprises lauroyl peroxide and tert-butyl peroctoate or 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-bis(t-butylperoxy)hexane (Trigonox® 101).<br>
A further preferred initiator combination comprises tert-butyl peroxypivalate (Luperox 11 M75 and tert-butyl peroctoate or 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-bis(t-butylperoxy)hexane (Trigonox® 101).<br>
A further preferred initiator combination comprises tert-butyl peroctoate and 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-bis(t-butylperoxy)hexane (Trigonox® 101).<br>
To achieve the purest polymers possible, the polymers can, for example, be subjected to a washing step with a suitable solvent, e.g. the solvent also used for the polymerization.<br>
The copolymers can be converted into a solid form, in particular a powder, by various drying processes. Polymers obtained by precipitation polymerization are preferably isolated by filtration prior to drying. Preference is given to using vacuum drying processes, such as vacuum fluidized-bed drying. The solid copolymer compositions obtained in this way can advantageously be dissolved or redispersed again in aqueous media. Suitable aqueous media are water and mixtures of water with at least one water-miscible solvent. Preference is given to water and water/alcohol mixtures, where the alcohol is preferably chosen from Ci-C4-alkanols, such as ethanol. isopropanol, n-butanol and tert-butanol. Solid copolymers have the advantage of better storability, easier transportability and generally exhibit a lower tendency for microbial attack.<br>
The anionogenic groups (acid groups) of the copolymers can be partially or completely neutralized with a base. Bases which can be used for the neutralization of the polymers are alkali metal bases such as sodium hydroxide solution, potassium hydroxide solution, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate, potassium carbonate or potassium hydrogencarbonate and alkaline earth metal bases, such as calcium hydroxide, calcium oxide, magnesium hydroxide or magnesium carbonate, and amines. Suitable amines are, for example, C1-C6-alkylamines, preferably n-propylamine and n-butylamine, dialkylamines, preferably diethylpropylamine and dipropylmethylamine, trialkylamines, preferably triethylamine and triisopropylamine. Preference is given to amino alcohols, e.g. trialkanolamines, such as triethanolamine, alkyldialkanolamines, such as methyl- or ethyldiethanolamine and dialkylalkanolamines, such as dimethyl-ethanolamine, and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol. For use in hair-treatment<br><br>
compositions. NaOH, KOH, 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, 2-amino-2-ethylpropane-1,3-diol, diethylaminopropylamine and triisopropanolannine have proven useful for neutralizing the polymers comprising acid groups. The neutralization of the acid groups can also be carried out using mixtures of two or more bases, e.g. mixtures of sodium hydroxide solution and triisopropanolamine. Depending on the intended use, the neutralization can be carried out partially or completely. Partial neutralization is preferably understood as meaning neutralization of up to 95%, preferably up to 50%, specifically up to 25%, of the acid groups present in the polymer. Furthermore, partial neutralization is preferably understood as meaning neutralization of at least 1%, preferably at least 5%, of the acid groups present in the polymer.<br>
Charged cationic groups can be produced from the present cationogenic nitrogen-containing groups either by protonation, e.g. with mono- or polybasic carboxylic acids, such as lactic acid or tartaric acid, or with mineral acids, such as phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid, or by quaternization, e.g. with alkylating agents, such as C1-C4-aikyl halides or sulfates. Examples of such alkylating agents are ethyl chloride, ethyl bromide, methyl chloride, methyl bromide, dimethyl sulfate and diethyl sulfate.<br>
If the copolymers used according to the invention are to be both quaternized and also neutralized, then the quaternization is preferably carried out first, followed by the neutralization.<br>
The copolymers described above are advantageously suitable for modifying the rheological properties of hair cosmetic compositions. In particular, these are aqueous compositions. In this connection, the compositions of the copolymers are advantageously generally clear. The hair cosmetic formulations can thus be colored without impairment by the intrinsic color of the compositions. Furthermore, the compositions can be formulated in the form of opaque to clear gels.<br>
The anionically ampholytic copolymers used according to the invention are specifically suitable as rheology modifiers with properties which can be controlled via the pH. They are specifically suitable as pH-switchable thickeners for a pH range greater than or equal to 6.<br>
The quaternized cationic copolymers used according to the invention have a high pH stability in a pH range from about 3 to 9. The (partially) neutralized copolymers used according to the invention are specifically suitable as rheology modifiers with properties which can be controlled via the pH. They are specifically suitable as pH-switchable thickeners for a pH range from about 4 to 7.<br><br>
The anionically ampholytic copolymers and cationicaliy ampholytio copolymers used according to the invention are also specifically suitable as rheology modifiers for salt-containing compositions. On the other hand, it is also possible to thicken salt-free compositions using the copolymers according to the invention.<br>
Advantageously, the anionically ampholytic copolymers and cationicaliy ampholytic copolymers used according to the invention also act as film-forming and/or conditioning rheology modifiers. They are thus suitable specifically for hair-setting compositions as "setting thickeners" and in haircare compositions as "conditioning thickeners".<br>
The copolymers are suitable both for the preparation of homogeneous-phase aqueous compositions, and also for the formulation of heterogeneous-phase compositions which additionally comprise at least one water-insoluble (hydrophobic) liquid or solid compound. "Homogeneous-phase compositions" have only a single phase irrespective of the number of their constituents. "Heterogeneous-phase compositions" are disperse systems of two or more immiscible components. These include solid/liquid, liquid/liquid and solid/liquid/liquid compositions, such as dispersions and emulsions, e.g. 0/W and W/0 formulations which have at least one of the oil or fat components described in more detail below and water as immiscible phases. In principle, the copolymers can be used either in the water phase or in the oil phase. In general, heterogeneous-phase liquid/liquid compositions comprise the copolymers essentially in the water phase.<br>

The ampholytic copolymers A) used according to the invention are advantageously characterized not only by good thickening properties, but also by film-forming properties. They can thus be used in hair cosmetic compositions also as hair-setting component, meaning that the use of additional setting polymers B) is only required in a reduced amount or may even be entirely superfluous. The ampholytic copolymers A) are also advantageously characterized by conditioning properties and can improve the<br><br>
sensory properties of the hair, e.g. give it suppleness and shine. Hair treated with the copolymers A) are not sticky or are only very slightly sticky.<br>

Suitable hair polymers B) are quite generally film-forming polymers which are cosmetically compatible and are used for formulating hair cosmetic compositions. They are preferably water-soluble or water-dispersible polymers. Particular preference is given to water-soluble hair polymers.
