				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a substituted 2-acylaminothiazole compound and pharmaceutical composition thereof which are useful as medicaments, especially a thrombocytopenia treating agent, and medicaments comprising one or more said compounds as active ingredients.<br>
Background Art<br>
Platelets are non-nucleated blood cells which play a main role in physiological hemostasis and pathologic thrombus generation. Platelets are constantly produced in vivo from megakaryocytes, precursor cells. Platelets are, like other blood cells, produced from multipotential stem cells. Multipotential stem cells become megakaryocytic precursor cells, from which megakaryoblasts, promegakaryoblast's and megakaryocytes are formed in this order. During maturation of the megakaryocytes, immature megakaryocytes conduct DNA synthesis only without cell division to form polyploids. Thereafter, maturation of cytoplasms begins to form platelet separation membranes, and the cytoplasms are split to release platelets.<br><br>
Meanwhile, a decrease in platelets due to various haitopoietic disorders in chemotherapy, radiotherapy or the like of anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome or malignant tumor induces serious conditions such as invitation of bleeding tendency. Therefore, various attempts of technical development for increasing platelets have been made for the purpose of treating the same. At present, a potent method for treating thrombocytopenia is platelet transfusion. However, a sufficient amount of platelets is not yet supplied, and life of platelets transfused is short.  For these reasons, it is hard to satisfactorily improve thrombocytopenia. Moreover, platelet transfusion involves problems such as viral infection, production of alloantibody and graft versus host disease (GVHD). Accordingly, the development of medications for relaxing an inhibitory state of a hematopoietic function induced by various diseases or therapies and accelerating recovery of the number of platelets has been expected.<br>
Under these circumstances, it has been reported that thrombopoietin (hereinafter referred to as TPO) which is a main factor participating in division to megakaryocytic cells and is a c-Mpl ligand is cloned to stimulate division and growth of megakaryocytic cells and accelerate production of platelets (Kaushansky K. et al., Nature, 369, 568-571, 1994; Non-patent Document 1). TPO has already been subjected to a clinical test as a platelet increasing agent,<br><br>
and usefulness and tolerance in humans are being confirmed. However, in a clinical test of PEG-rHuMGDF (TPO whose 163rd amino acid seen from the N-terminal has been modified with polyethylene glycol) which is a type of TPO, a neutralizing antibody has been confirmed (Li J. et. al., Blood, 98, 3241-3248, 2001: Non-patent Document 2, and Basser R. L. et al., Blood, 99, 2599-2602, 2002: Non-patent Document 3). Accordingly, there is a fear of TPO immunogenicity. Further, since TPO is a protein, it is decomposed in digestive organs, and is thus not practical as an oral administration drug.  For the same reason, a low-molecular peptide is not considered either to be practical as an oral administration drug. Under these circumstances, the development of an orally adrninistrable non-peptide c-Mpl ligand with less immunogenicity has been under way for treatment of thrombocytopenia.<br>
As the foregoing compounds, benzodiazepine derivatives (Patent Document 1), acylhydrazone derivatives (Patent Document 2), diazonaphthalene derivatives (Patent Document 3), pyrrocarbazole derivatives (Patent Document 4), pyrrophenanthridine derivatives (Patent Document 5) and pyrrophthalimide derivatives (Patent Document 6) have been known.<br>
WO 01/07423 (Patent Document 7) describes that compounds represented by the following general formula (VII) have a platelet increasing function.<br><br><br>
(As to symbols in the formula, refer to the document.) The document describes the compounds containing thiazole which may be substituted as X1 and -NHCO- as Y1.  In the present invention, however, R3 in the compounds of the invention is not substituted with a substituent having an A1 group such as a thiazolyl group in the document. Moreover, regarding compounds in which the 5-position of thiazole is substituted with a lower alkyl substituted with a nitrogen atom, there is not any concrete disclosure by Examples or the like in the document.<br>
WO 01/53267 (Patent Document 8) describes that compounds represented by the following general formula<br>
(VIII) have a platelet increasing function.<br><br>
(As to symbols in the formula, refer to the document.) The document describes the compounds containing thiazole which may be substituted as X1 and -NHCO- as Y1.  In the present invention, however, R3 in the compounds of the present invention is not substituted with a substituent having a W1 group in the document.  Regarding compounds in which the 5-position of thiazole is substituted with a lower<br><br>
alkyl substituted with a nitrogen atom, there is not any carete disclosure by Examples or the like in the document.<br>
WO 02/62775 (Patent Document 9) describes that compounds represented by the following general formula (IX) have a platelet increasing function.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 (As to symbols in the formula, refer to the document.)<br>
The document describes the compounds in which the 5-position of 2-acylaminothiazole is directly substituted with a nitrogen atom. However, it does not describe compounds in which the 5-position of thiazole is substituted with a lower alkyl substituted with a nitrogen atom in the present invention.<br>
WO 03/062233 (Patent Document 10) describes that compounds represented by the following general formula (X) have a platelet increasing function.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 (As to symbols in the formula, refer to the document.<br>
The document describes the compounds in which the 5-<br>
of 2-acylaminothiazole is directly substituted with a nitrogen atom. However, it does not describe compounds in which the 5-position of thiazole is substituted with a lower alkyl substituted with a nitrogen atom in the present invention.<br>
In addition to the foregoing Patent Documents 7 to 10, 2-acylaminothiazole compounds are described as cholecystokinin and gastrin receptor antagonists in Patent No. 3199451 (Patent Document 11) or as compounds having antiinflammatory characteristics in Chemical and Pharmaceutical Bulletin, 25, 9, 2292-2299, 1977 (Non-patent Document 4).  However, none of them indicate at all the platelet increasing function in the present invention.<br>
Under such circumstances, the development of an orally administrable non-peptide c-Mpl ligand with less antigenicity has been in demand for treatment of thrombocytopenia.<br>

Typical processes are described below.  Some types of functional groups are substituted with appropriate protective groups, namely groups easily convertible to the very functional groups in the stage of starting materials or intermediates, which is sometimes effective in the production technique. Thereafter, protective groups are removed, as required, to be able to obtain the desired compounds. Examples of such functional groups can include a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group, an amino group and the like.  Examples of the protective groups can include protective groups described in, for example, Green and Wuts, "Protective Groups in<br><br>
Organic Synthesis (third edition)". These may properly be used according to reaction conditions. (First process)<br>

This process is a process for producing a compound, among the compounds of the present invention represented by formula (I) or (III), in which A is methylene, R1 and R2 (or<br>
R4 and R5) are not crosslinked, and R1 or R4 and A are not<br>
(Step A)<br>
This step is a step in which compound (Ic) is produced by amidation of compound (la) or its salt with compound (Ib) or its reactive derivative in a usual manner and removing a protective group as required.<br>
As the amidation in this step, amidation which can ordinarily be used by a skilled person is employable. Especially, a method in which phosphorus oxychloride is used in a pyridine solvent, and a method in which a condensing agent such as l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide<br>
hydrochloride (WSC-HC1) , dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, carbonyldiimidazole, diphenylphosphorylazide or diethylphosphorylcyanide is used in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) are advantageously used.<br>
The reaction varies with reactive derivatives or a condensing agent used. Usually, the reaction is conducted in an organic solvent inactive to the reaction under cooling, under cooling to room temperature or under room temperature to heating, examples of the organic solvent including halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, dichloroethane and chloroform, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and xylene, ethers such as ether and tetrahydrofuran (THF), esters such as ethyl acetate (EtOAc),<br>

(Step C, Step D)<br>
These steps are steps in which compound (I) or (III) of the present invention is produced by introducing an acetoxymethyl group in the 5-position of thiazole of compound (Ic) and then conducting a nucleophilic substitution reaction with compound (le) under a basic condition.<br>
The acetoxymethylation in step C can be conducted under room temperature to heating or under room temperature to reflux by reacting compound (Ic) with a formaldehyde aqueous solution or a p-formaldehyde in an acetic acid solvent.  The reaction may be conducted by adding acetic acid in a solvent inactive to the reaction, such as halogenated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons or ethers instead of an acetic acid solvent.  In this case, a<br>
reactivity tends to be decreased.  Further, the reaction may be conducted by addition of acetic anhydride.<br>
The nucleophilic substitution reaction in step D can be conducted by reacting compound (Id) with compound (le) in an organic solvent inactive to the reaction, such as halogenated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, esters, acetonitrile, DMF or DMSO in the presence of an organic base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine and/or an inorganic base such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, cesium carbonate or sodium hydrogencarbonate. For acceleration of the reaction, a catalyst such as dimethylaminopyridine may be added.  Instead of the organic base and/or the inorganic base, a larger amount of compound (le) may be used. The reaction varies with the base used. It can be conducted under cooling to room temperature, under room temperature to heating or under room temperature to reflux.<br>

Further, some compounds represented by formula (I) or (III) may be produced from the compounds of the present invention which have been obtained in the foregoing manner by arbitrarily combining steps that can ordinarily be<br><br>
employed by a skilled person, such as known alkylation, ation, substitution reaction, oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis.<br>
The thus-produced compounds according to the present invention are isolated and purified either in free form or as salts thereof by undergoing salt-forming treatment in a usual manner.  Isolation and purification are performed by ordinary chemical procedures such as extraction, concentration, distillation, crystallization, filtration, recrystallization and various chromatographies.<br>
Various isomers can be isolated in a usual manner by utilizing a difference in physicochemical properties between isomers.  For example, a racemic mixture can be introduced into optically pure isomers by a general racemic compound resolution method, for example, a method in which the mixture is formed into a diastereomer salt with a general optically active acid such as tartaric acid to conduct optical resolution. A diastereo-mixture can be separated by, for example, fractional crystallization or various chromatographies.

(ii) Test for measuring a function of accelerating formation of megakaryocytic colonies<br>
Human CD34+ cells were cultured in a 2-well chamber<br>
slide in the presence of a test product at 37°C for from 10 to 14 days using MegaCult™-C (StemCell Technologies) . After<br>
dehydration and fixation were conducted according to the acpached manual, dying was conducted with an anti-glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antibody. The number of colonies for 1 well was counted by a microscope on condition that a population of 3 or more dyed megakaryocytes was one colony. An EC30 value of each test compound was calculated from a dose curve.<br>
Consequently, with respect to the ECao value of the compounds of the present invention, the compound in Example 71 is 20 nM, the compound in Example 100 34 nM, the compound in Example 104 36 nM, the compound in Example 106 23 nM, and the compound in Example 315 45 nM.

(iii) Mouse oral administration test 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg (100 mg/kg in Comparative Compounds 1 to 3) of a test compound dissolved or suspended in a 0.5% methylcellulose aqueous solution was orally administered to a male ICR mouse. After 2 hours from administration, a blood was sampled from the subabdominal large vein using 1/10-volume 3.8% sodium citrate as an anticoagulant. Centrifugation was performed at 12,000 rpm for 3 minutes.  The resulting plasma was heated at 56°C for 30 minutes, and added to a system of the human c-mpl-Ba/F3 cell growth test described in (i) such that the final<br>
concentration of the plasma reached 0.3%, 1% or 3% (10% in Ctgarative Compounds 1 to 3) to measure a cell growth activity. The cell growth activity (%) of each plasma was measured when the maximum cell growth activity of each test compound was defined as 100%.<br>

From the foregoing results, it has been confirmed that the compounds of the present invention have an oral activity in mice.  Especially, it has been found that in the comparative compounds, the oral activity is little shown even "under a condition of 100 mg/kg - 10% dilution", whereas in the compounds of the present invention, the good oral activity is exhibited even "under a condition of a lower dose of 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg - higher dilution of 3% or less". This is quite unexpected, and is considered to have been achieved by introduction of lower alkylene having an amino group as a substituent in the 5-position of thiazole. In Comparative Compound 2 and Comparative Compound 3, the cell growth activity has been less than 10% also in the lower dose (10 mg/kg p.o.)-<br>
