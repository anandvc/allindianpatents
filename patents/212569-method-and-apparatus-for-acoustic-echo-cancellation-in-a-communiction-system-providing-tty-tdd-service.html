				<td>Field of the Invention:	<br>
The  present  invention  relates  generally  to inconsistent with tittle method apparatus for elastic and echo canceled for the  enhancing  communication  capabilities in a communication system, and in particular, to a method and apparatus for  canceling acoustic echo in a communication system providing a TTY/TDD service<br>
Description of the JRelated Art:<br>
Communication technology, particularly mobile communication technology, has been developed to additionally provide data service as well as voice service. Communication systems provide additional services to satisfy various user demands. One of the additional services is a TTY/TDD service. The term "TTY" derives from "Teletype", which is a registered trademark of the Teletype Corporation. "TDD", is an abbreviation of the phrase "telecommunications device for the deaf'. TTY/TDD services enable telephone calls to the deaf or hearing-impaired people.<br>
Implementation of the TTY/TDD service requires a TTY/TDD device. The TTY/TDD device comprises a keyboard, a MODEM (Modulator/DEModulator), and a display connected to a wired telephone via the MODEM. The TTY/TDD device converts PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) signal from the other party to text messages and displays them oh the display. It also converts text messages received from the keyboard to PCM signals and provides the PCM signal to the wired telephone. Thus, the deaf can conduct a telephone call.<br>
In connection with the TTY/TDD service, the U.S. has created ground rules to provide services to the deaf and hard of hearing persons since the late 1970's. In 1990, the ADA (the Americans with Disabilities Act) was instituted to enforce the rights of individuals with disabilities. Today, it has been decided that a TTY/TDD functionality shall be provided in the standards of a mobile communication system. As is well known to those skilled in the art of the invention, 13K QCELP (Qualcomm Code Excited Linear Prediction Code) and EVRC (Enhanced Variable Rate Code) vocoders are widespread voice compression techniques in 2nd and 3rd generation wireless communications systems.<br>
The TTY/TDD functionality is implemented as IS-733-3 and IS 127-4 in these vocoders. FS-733-3 defines the TTY/TDD functionality of the 13K QCELP vocoder, and IS-127-4, that of the EVRC vocoder.<br>
The encoder of such a vocoder processes voice samples on a 20-ms frame basis and transmits processed voice information in packets. The decoder of the vocoder reproduces the voice samples by processing received voice packets in an order reverse to the encoder operation. When the TTY/TDD functionality is implemented, the encoder determines whether input PCM (pulse code modulation) samples are voice or TTY/TDD text. In the case of voice, the encoder transmits voice information in packets. In the case of TTY/TDD text, it transmits text information in packets. The decoder determines whether a received packet is voice information or TTY/TDD text information and reproduces voice samples or TTY text tones according to the result of the determination. The TTY/TDD functionality supports voice carryover/hearing carryover (VCO/HCO). VCO allows people who have difficulties in hearing clearly through the telephone to use a TTY without typing. They only use the TTY for reading during the inbound direction of the call. They talk to their party by speaking into a microphone. Similarly, HCO allows a person with a speech disability to hear a response from their party directly. A communication system equipped with vocoders having these options enables communications between a person without any speech or hearing disabilities and a hearing-impaired person or between hearing-impaired persons.<br>
Communication systems equipped with vocoders having the TTY/TDD functionality are illustrated in Figs. 1, 2A and 2B. Fig. 1 illustrates the network configuration of a communication system that allows a TTY/TDD service between a mobile subscriber and a subscriber to the public switched telephone network (PSTN), and Figs. 2A and 2B illustrate the network configuration of a communication system that allows a TTY/TDD service between mobile subscribers.<br>
The TTY/TDD service in these communication systems has at least the following two problems:<br>
(1) In the case when a mobile-to-land call (an MtoL call) is established between a mobile and PSTN subscriber (voice transmission/reception), as illustrated in Fig. 1, the acoustic echo that can be generated from a land phone 111 will not negatively impact the communication quality of the call as perceived by the mobile phone<br>
 (TTY/TDD phone) 103. The reason why the call-quality is not negatively impacted is because the signal length and delay of the acoustic echo are inaudibly small. That is, under an environment with voice data only, even if acoustic echo is caused in the land phone 111, the strength of a PCM signal delivered from the speaker to the microphone of the land phone 111 is very small and the microphone is sufficiently apart from the speaker. Thus the communication quality the TTY/TDD phone 103 perceives is good. Therefore, the acoustic echo is not a problem.<br>
However, in the case of transmission/reception of TTY/TDD text information, a TTY/TDD device 101 substantially perceives the signal strength of the acoustic echo generated from the land phone 111. The TTY/TDD device 101 then reproduces the TTY/TDD information due to the acoustic echo involved with transmission of the TTY/TDD information. Specifically, under an environment having coexistent voice and TTY/TDD text, a PCM signal of TTY/TDD text tones output from the speaker of the land phone 11I is delivered to its microphone. However small its signal strength is, an encoder 105b in a vocoder 105 within a base station (BS) 105 perceives the PCM signal substantially and transmits the TTY/TDD text information in a packet to the TTY/TDD phone 103. Therefore, the TTY/TDD device 101 connected to the TTY/TDD phone 103 reproduces the TTY/TDD text. Consequently, the acoustic echo generated from the land phone 111 influences the TTY/TDD device 101.<br>
(2) When a mobile-to-mobile (M to M) trans-coding call is established between mobile subscribers as illustrated in Figs. 2A and 2B, acoustic echo caused in one TTY/TDD phone 311 leads to reproduction of transmitted TTY/TDD text information in a TTY/TDD device 301 connected to the other TTY/TDD phone 303. Under the environment of voice data only, even if acoustic echo is generated from the TTY/TDD phone 311, the strength of a PCM signal delivered from its speaker to its microphone is negligibly small. Therefore, there is no influence on the communication quality of the other TTY/TDD phone 303.<br>
In the environment of voice information coexisting with TTY/TDD text information, however, PCM TTY/TDD text tones delivered from the speaker to the microphone of the TTY/TDD phone 311 are substantially sensed in its encoder 3 lib. The encoder 311b will sense the PCM TTY/TDD text tones because the encoder 31 Ib is specifically configured to sense the TTY/TTD text tones, however small they are, in accordance with the "3GPP2 C.S0028 Version 1.0 CDMA TTY/TDD Minimum<br>
Performance Specification." Therefore, the TTY/TDD device 301 'connected to the other TTY/TDD phone 303 reproduces the TTY/TDD text due to the acoustic echo.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Several embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings, the same or similar elements are denoted by the same reference numerals even though they are depicted in different drawings. In the following description, a detailed description of well-known functions or constructions incorporated herein have been omitted for conciseness.<br>
The embodiments of the present invention described herein pertain to cancellation of acoustic echo generated during transmission of text information in a mobile communication system providing a TTY/TDD service, i.e., communication systems equipped with TTY/TDD devices. Acoustic echo cancellation is implemented in at least two embodiments according to the present invention.<br>
The first embodiment of the present invention cancels acoustic echo generated when a hearing-impaired mobile subscriber inputs text information to call a normal or hearing-impaired PSTN subscriber using a TTY/TDD device. In accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention, upon set up of an M to L call, a TTY/TDD text detector 115, in a BS vocoder detects TTY/TDD text, and a blank packet generator 117 then transmits a blank packet containing silence-information. In this embodiment, an M to L call is a call established between a mobile subscriber and a PSTN subscriber, for conversation over the telephone. If the TTY/TDD text detector fails to detect TTY/TDD text, an encoder transmits a packet.<br>
The second embodiment of the present invention cancels acoustic echo generated when a hearing-impaired mobile subscriber inputs text information to call another normal or<br>
hearing-impaired mobile subscriber using a TTY/TDD device. In accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention, upon set up of an MtoM trans-coding call, a PCM signal is provided to an encoder and a TTY/TDD text detector is provided in a BS vocoder. In this embodiment, an MtoM call is a call established between mobile subscribers, for conversation over the telephone. The count of a delay counter depends on the type of information (silence, voice, or TTY/TDD text) detected in the TTY/TDD text detector. A decoder operates, or a PCM mute generator sets a PCM signal as zero according to the count in the BS vocoder.<br>
First Embodiment<br>
Fig. 3 A illustrates the configuration of a system for canceling acoustic echo generated from a communication system providing a TTY/TDD service according to the first embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 3B is a block diagram of the BS vocoder 105 illustrated in Fig. 3A.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3B, the BS vocoder 105 of the present invention includes a TTY/TDD text detector 115, a blanket packet generator 117, and a switch SW in addition to the decoder 105a and the encoder 105b of the BS vocoder 105 illustrated in Fig. 1. A packet received from the TTY/TDD phone 103 is applied to the input of the decoder 105a and the TTY/TDD text detector 115. The decoder 105a decodes the packet and outputs a PCM signal to a mobile switching center (MSC) 107. The TTY/TDD text detector 115 detects TTY/TDD text if the packet contains the TTY/TDD text and outputs a detection message representing the detection result. A PCM signal received from the MSC 107 is applied to the input of the encoder I05b and the blank packet generator 117. The encoder 105b encodes the PCM signal and outputs a packet. The blank packet generator 117 generates a blank packet including silence information from the PCM signal.<br>
Referring to Figs. 3A and 3B, it can be seen that the BS vocoder 105 comprises the TTY/TDD text detector 115 for detecting TTY/TDD text, the blank packet generator 117 for generating a blank packet and outputting the blank packet according to a detection message received from the TTY/TDD text detector 115. The first embodiment of the present invention is implemented in a communication system that has a BS, a TTY/TDD phone 03 connected wirelessly to the BS, a first TTY/TDD device 101 for exchanging text information with the TTY/TDD phone 103, a PSTN 109,<br>
a MSC 107 for connecting the BS to the PSTN 109, a land phone 111 connected to the PSTN 109 by cable, and a second TTY/TDD device 113 connected to the land phone 111, for exchanging text information with the land phone 111. The first TTY/TDD device 101 can be connected to the TTY/TDD phone 103 wirelessly or by cable as illustrated in Fig. 3A. In addition, the first TTY/TDD .device 101 can be incorporated into the TTY/TDD phone 103. The same means for incorporation can be applied to the second TTY/TDD device 113.<br>
Fig. 4 is a flowchart illustrating a method for providing acoustic echo cancellation according to the embodiment of the present invention. This operation is for<br>
	)<br>
canceling acoustic echo generated during transmission of text information from the first TTY/TDD device 101 to the second TTY/TDD device 113. The acoustic echo cancellation method includes the steps of detecting text information in a packet received from the first TTY/TDD device 101 through the TTY/TDD phone 103 by the TTY/TDD text detector 115 (step 201). A blank packet containing silence information is generated if the text information has been received in the BS vocoder 105 ("Yes" path from step 201). and then transmitted to the first TTY/TDD device 101 through the TTY/TDD phone 103 by the blank packet generator 117 (step 203). Therefore, acoustic echo is prevented which leads to reproduction of the text information in the first TTY/TDD device 101.<br>
Referring to Figs. 3A, 3B and 4, when the TTY/TDD device 101 transmits TTY/TDD text to the TTY/TDD 1J3 connected to the land phone 111, the encoder 105b of the BS vocoder 105 can sense acoustic echo generated from the land phone 111. Thus, the encoder 105b feeds the transmitted TTY/TDD text back in packets to the TTY/TDD phone 103. A decoder 103b of the TTY/TDD phone 103 generates corresponding TTY/TDD text tones and thus the TTY/TDD device 101 reproduces the TTY/TDD text. Consequently, the failure of the BS vocoder 105 in canceling the acoustic echo of the land phone 111 brings about the echo of the TTY/TDD text. This phenomenon arises because the TTY/TDD functionality is additionally implemented in the BS vocoder 105, and the encoder 105b of the BS vocoder 105 is so configured as to perceive the PCM signal of TTY/TDD text, regardless of its strength in accordance with the "3GPP2 C.S0028 Version 1.0 CDMA TTY/TDD Minimum Performance specification".For cancellation of the acoustic echo, the BS vocoder 105 further includes the TTY/TDD text detector 115 competed in parallel to the decoder 105a, and the blank<br>
packet generator 117 connected in parallel to the encoder 105b. When the TTY/TDD text detector 115 detects TTY/TDD text, the encoder 105b is made inoperative and instead, the blank packet generator 117 transmits a blank packet having silence information to the TTY/TDD phone 103.If, however, the TTY/TDD text detector 115 fails to 'detect TTY/TDD text, the encoder 105b operates, normally and transmits a packet received from the MSC 107 to the TTY/TDD phone 103.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 4, the TTY/TDD text detector 105 will detect TTY/TDD text if the TTY/TDD text is included in a packet received from the TTY/TDD phone 103, as shown in step 201. Upon detection of the TTY/TDD text, the BS vocoder 105 is set to a TTY/TDD mode. Otherwise, it operates in a voice mode. In the TTY/TDD mode, the blank packet generator 117 generates silence information and transmits the silence information in a blank packet to the TTY/TDD phone 103 in step 203. In the voice mode, the encoder 105b normally transmits a voice packet received from the MSC 107 to the TTY/TDD phone. 103 in step 205. These operations are possible because the system operates in a half-duplex mode during transmission of TTY/TDD text. The system operating in half-duplex mode means that when the TTY/TDD device 101 transmits TTY/TDD text, the land phone 111 is prevented from transmitting voice information or TTY/TDD text. When the land phone 111 transmits voice information or TTY/TDD text, the encoder 105b operates normally since it has already received voice mode information from the decoder 105a.<br>
Second Embodiment<br>
Fig. 5A illustrates the configuration of a system for canceling acoustic echo generated from a communication system providing a TTY/TDD service according to the second embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 5B is a block diagram of the BS vocoder 309 illustrated in Fig. 5A.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5B, the BS vocoder 309 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention includes a TTY/TDD text detector 315, a delay counter 317, a PCM' mute generator 319, and a switch SW in addition to the decoder 309a and the encoder 309b of the BS decoder 105 illustrated in Figs. 2A and 2B. A PCM signal received from the MSC 307 is applied to the input of the encoder 309a and the TTY/TDD text detector 315. The encoder 309a encodes the PCM signal and outputs a packet to the TTY/TDD phone 311.<br>
The TTY/TDD text detector 315 detects TTY/TDD text if the PCM signal contains the TTY/TDD text and outputs a detection message representing the detection result. The delay count of the delay counter 317 is set according to the detection result, and the switch SW switches to the MSC 307 one of the outputs of the decoder 309b and the PCM mute generator 319 according to the delay count. A packet received from the TTY/TDD phone 311 is applied to the input of the decoder 309b and the PCM mute generator 319. The decoder 309b decodes the packet and outputs a PCM signal. The PCM mute generator 319 mutes a PCM signal directed to the MSC 307. The switch SW is connected to the output of the decoder 309b and the PCM mute generator 319. The switch SW switches the output of the decoder 309b or the PCM mute generator 319 to the MSC 307 according to the delay count.<br>
Referring to Figs. 5A and 5B, in parallel with encoder 305a, as described above, the BS vocoder 309 includes the TTY/TDD text detector 315 for detecting TTY/TDD text and outputting a detection message representing the detection result. The BS vocoder 309 also includes the delay counter 317 for counting according to the detection message. In parallel with decoder 305b, as described above, the BS vocoder 309 further includes the PCM mute generator 319 for generating .a PCM mute signal during counting in the delay counter 317 and the switch SW.<br>
The second embodiment is implemented in a communication system that has a first BS, a second BS, an MSC 307 for connecting the first BS to the second BS, a first TTY/TDD phone 303 connected wirelessly to the first BS, a second TTY/TDD phone 311 connected wirelessly to the second BS, a first TTY/TDD device 301 connected to the first TTY/TDD phone 303 for transmitting/receiving text information, and a second TTY/TDD device 313 connected to the second TTY/TDD phone 311 for transmitting/receiving text information. The first TTY/TDD device 301 can be connected to the TTY/TDD phone 303 wirelessly or by cable as illustrated in Fig. 5A. In addition, the first TTY/TDD device 301 can be incorporated into the TTY/TDD phone 303. The same means for incorporation can be applied to the second TTY/TDD device 313.<br>
If the TTY/TDD phone 311 fails to prevent an acoustic echo when an MtoM bypass call is set up, the BS vocoder 305 cannot cancel it. On the other hand, when an MtoM trans-coding call is set up, the BS vocoder 309 can cancel the acoustic echo according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
When the TTY/TDD device 301 transmits TTY/TDD text, acoustic echo<br>
from the TTY/TDD phone 311 may cause reproduction of the TTY/TDD text in the TTY/TDD device 301, as illustrated in Fig. 2A. To cancel the acoustic echo, the present invention is implemented not in the BS vocoder 305 but in the BS vocoder 309. This is because when considering delay involved in encoding and decoding of the two TTY/TDD phones and the two BS vocoders, it is preferable to cancel the acoustic echo from the TTY/TDD phone 311 nearest to the TTY/TDD phone 311.<br>
Due to the length of one TTY character (which occupies 7 to 16 frames), and the time required for encoding in the BS vocoder 309 and decoding in the TTY/TDD phone 311, the delay of the PCM signal of a TTY/TDD character received from the TTY/TDD device 301 from its input to the encoder 309a to its feedback to the decoder 309b is set at about 300ms in the present invention. This delay is a minimum time required for the TTY/TDD text detector 315 to detect TTY/TDD text and operate the PCM mute generator 319 according to the detection result. However, the PCM rnute generator 319 cannot be operated continuously since the TTY/TDD device 313 transmits TTY/TDD text. Therefore, the PCM mute generator 319 needs to be off a predetermined time later. In general, one-directional communication is conducted in a half-duplex mode in a TTY/TDD text transmission/reception environment. Therefore, a user of the TTY/TDD phone 303 starts can only start to transmit TTY/TDD text after ensuring that TTY/TDD text received from the TTY/TDD phone 301 is completely output. In accordance with this embodiment of the present invention, an appropriate time delay is 600ms (refer to step 431 of Fig 6). This time delay takes into account the time required to read TTY/TDD text, the minimum time required for processing in the PCM mute generator 319 upon detection of TTY/TDD text, and the aforementioned time delay of 300ms. The time delay is the time for which the PCM mute generator 319 is activated and maintained active.<br>
Fig. 6 is a flowchart illustrating a method for providing acoustic echo cancellation according to the second embodiment of the present invention. This operation is for canceling acoustic echo generated from the second TTY/TDD phone 311 during transmission of text information from the first TTY/TDD device 301 to the second TTY/TDD device 313. The acoustic echo cancellation method includes the steps of detecting text information in a PCM signal received from the first TTY/TDD device 301 through the MSC 307 in the TTY/TDD text detector 315, and discontinuing text reception from the second TTY/TDD phone 311 for a predetermined time in the decoder<br>
309b of the second BS vocoder 3S9. The predetermined time is at least the time required for decoding in a decoder 31 la and encoding in an encoder 3lib of the second TTY/TDD phone 311.<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, the TTY/TDD text detector 315 receives a PCM signal from the MSC 307 in step 401. If a current frame includes TTY/TDD text, the value of the delay counter 317 is set to 30; that is, the number of frames corresponding to 600ms in step 427. Then the PCM mute generator 319 is activated in step 429. This implies that the switch SW switches such that the PCM mute generator 319 outputs a PCM mute signal.<br>
Meanwhile, if the TTY/TDD text detector 315 detects mute, voice, or the same TTY/TDD text as the previous one, the value of the delay counter 317 is decreased in step 413. 417. or 425. If the count is 1, the PCM mute generator 319 is off and instead, the decoder 30% is on.<br>
If the count is not 1, the PCM mute generator 319 is maintained activated in step 419. Since the count cannot be 1 even if the same TTY/TDD text is received and the delay counter 317 is decreased as in step 425, the PCM mute generator 319 is maintained activated in step 419. This is because one TTY/TDD character is transmitted in 7 to 16 frames and the count is 15 even when the TTY/TDD character is 16 frames long.<br>
