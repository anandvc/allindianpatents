Switch disconnector<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a medium-voltage switch<br>
disconnector as claimed in the precharacterizing clause<br>
of claim 1.<br>
German Patent Application DE 10 2005 009 207.1<br>
describes a switch disconnector of the type mentioned<br>
initially, which is installed in a medium-voltage<br>
switchgear assembly and has the task there of<br>
disconnection and connection at the rated load. For<br>
this purpose, the switch disconnector has a stationary<br>
contact-piece arrangement and a moving contact-piece<br>
arrangement, which is attached to a contact spindle or<br>
a contact rod as a contact mount, which is coupled to a<br>
pivoting lever arrangement that is operated by a<br>
driveshaft.<br>
The contact point comprises a main contact point and an<br>
arc interruption point, with the main contact point<br>
having a pot contact piece with contact fingers.<br>
The object of the invention is to optimize a switch<br>
disconnector of the type mentioned initially.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by<br>
the features of claim 1.<br>
Further advantageous refinements and improvements of<br>
the invention can be found in the other dependent<br>
claims.<br>
The invention as well as further advantageous<br>
refinements and improvements of the invention will be<br>
explained and described in more detail with reference<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/114214	PCT/EP2006/003500<br>
- 2 -<br>
to the drawing, which illustrates one exemplary<br>
embodiment of the invention, and in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a contact point of a switch<br>
disconnector in the connected position,<br>
Figure 2 shows the contact point from Figure 1,<br>
shortly before the disconnected position,<br>
Figure 3 shows a perspective view of the main<br>
contact points during further<br>
disconnection, and<br>
Figure 4 shows a perspective view of a contact pin.<br>
Reference is made to Figure 1.<br>
The contact point of a switch disconnector as shown<br>
there is located in an enclosure 10 in the form of a<br>
pot and composed of insulating plastic, as has been<br>
disclosed in DE 10 2005 009 207.1. At its free end, the<br>
container 10 is closed by a base section 11 in which a<br>
cylindrical contact section or sleeve 12 is fixed,<br>
which has a hole 13 via which a connecting line can be<br>
connected as indicated by the direction of the arrow P.<br>
A stationary main contact piece 14 is connected to the<br>
inner end of the contact sleeve 12 and is in the form<br>
of a tulip with a baseplate 15 and contact fingers 16<br>
connected to it, which have a drawn-in area 17,<br>
pointing inwards, at their free ends. A contact pin 18,<br>
which is illustrated in more detail in Figure 4, is<br>
fixed in the hole 13.<br>
A contact mount 19 in the form of a contact rod is<br>
guided (in a manner which is not illustrated in any<br>
more detail) within the container 10, and a sealing<br>
plate is attached to its inner end, and is fitted on<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/114214	PCT/EP2006/003500<br>
- 3 -<br>
its outer circumference with a seal 21 which rests<br>
against the inner surface of the container 10, where it<br>
is used to form a seal. A cylinder 22 is attached to<br>
the plate 20 and is fitted on its inner surface with a<br>
contact piece 23 in the form of a nozzle, with the<br>
nozzle shape forming the inner contour 24. At its<br>
opposite end to the contact piece 23, the cylinder 22<br>
has a strip 25 which projects radially inwards,<br>
surrounds the contact rod 19 and is firmly connected to<br>
it there. The interior 26 of the cylinder 22 is<br>
provided in the area of the strip 25 with aperture<br>
openings 27 which, in the axial direction, connect the<br>
interior 26 to the area 28 underneath the plate 20. A<br>
blowing cylinder 29 composed of insulating plastic is<br>
attached to the end of the cylinder 22 on the side<br>
opposite the plate 20.<br>
Reference is now made to Figure 4.<br>
Figure 4 shows the contact pin 18. This contact pin 18<br>
has an approximately cylindrical shape and has a pin<br>
section 30 which is inserted with a force fit into the<br>
hole 13. The section 30 is connected to a hexagonal<br>
plate section 31 which rests against the inner surface<br>
32 of the base 15 of the main contact piece 14 and<br>
firmly connects the main contact piece 14 to the<br>
contact cylinder 12. The contact pin 18 has a contact<br>
finger section 33 which has a widened section 34<br>
radially at its free end, which gives the contact pin<br>
32 a microphone-like structure. The contact pin 32 has<br>
an axially running longitudinal slot 33, thus forming<br>
two contact pin fingers 35 and 36. The external<br>
diameter of the section 34 is greater than the internal<br>
diameter of the contact piece 23, so that, when a<br>
disconnection operation occurs, that is to say when the<br>
contact piece mount is drawn in the direction of the<br>
arrow P1, the inner surface of the contact piece 23<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/114214	PCT/EP2006/003500<br>
- 4 -<br>
slides onto the outer surface of the section 34, thus<br>
forcing the two contact pin fingers 35 and 36 towards<br>
one another.<br>
The contact piece 23 is composed of material which is<br>
resistant to arc interruption, as is the section 34.<br>
When a switching operation now occurs and the contact<br>
mount 19 is drawn downwards with the moving contact<br>
piece 23 (see figure 1) in the direction of the arrow<br>
P1, then the contact cylinder 22 slides out of the<br>
contact fingers 16, as can be seen in Figure 2;<br>
however, in this case, the contact pin 18 is still<br>
electrically conductively connected to the contact<br>
piece 23 so that, once the contact finger 16 has been<br>
disconnected from the contact cylinder 22, the current<br>
flows from the contact cylinder 22 via the contact<br>
piece 23 towards the contact pin 18.<br>
The blowing cylinder 29 has an opening 40 whose<br>
internal diameter corresponds approximately to the<br>
external diameter of the section 34. In the position<br>
shown in Figure 2, the opening of the blowing cylinder<br>
29 slides onto the section 34. As soon as the contact<br>
piece 23 has been disconnected from the section 34 of<br>
the contact pin 32, an arc 43 is formed there (see<br>
Figure 3) and is blown from the blowing cylinder 29,<br>
which is composed of insulating material, with the gas<br>
from it in the area 41. The insulating plastic of the<br>
blowing cylinder 29 is composed of material which emits<br>
gas, thus resulting in optimum blowing of the arc<br>
between the section 34 and the contact piece 23.<br>
Figure 3 shows the contact arrangement shortly after<br>
disconnection of the contact piece 23 from the section<br>
34, with the arc 43 being struck here, which is<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/114214	PCT/EP2006/003500<br>
- 5 -<br>
quenched by quenching gas flowing out of the area 41 in<br>
the direction of the arrow P2.<br>
A cup 50 is electrically conductively firmly connected<br>
to the contact cylinder 12, surrounds the container 10<br>
and, in the area of the contact point, has a field<br>
control ring 51 which is located between the contact<br>
piece and the contact cylinder 22, as described in more<br>
detail in Patent Application DE 10 2005 009 207.1.<br>
 <br>
