Cross Reference to Related Applications<br>
[1] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.<br>
60/537,248, filed January 20, 2004, and of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.<br>
60/618,134, filed October 14, 2004, the disclosures of which are hereby<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[2] The present invention relates, in general, to photonic devices, and more<br>
particularly to improved monolithically integrated emitting and receiving photonic<br>
devices and methods for fabricating them.<br>
[3] Many optical systems, such as, for example, those incorporating or utilizing<br>
Passive Optical Networks (PON), require that a single optical fiber be used for both<br>
sending and receiving information at multiple wavelengths. In the past, such a<br>
capability has been difficult to achieve, particularly in a cost-effective manner, for the<br>
combination of a multiplicity of discrete photonic devices that will all have access to<br>
a single fiber has presented fabrication problems that have made such<br>
arrangements too expensive. The market for PON systems is extremely price<br>
sensitive, with the result that the highly desirable, wide range of functions that such<br>
networks can make available have not been economically feasible. Similar<br>
difficulties have been encountered with the use of multiple photonic devices in other<br>
optical systems, such as high definition DVD's, for even in such applications the<br>
required high level of functionality is not easily attainable through the use of discrete<br>
photonic devices.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[4] In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, solid state light<br>
receiving and light emitting photonic devices are monolithically integrated on a<br>
common substrate to provide multiple optical functions on the surface of a single<br>
chip. The integration of such devices to provide bidirectional photonic operation is<br>
optimized though multilayer epitaxy, wherein lasers and detectors can be fabricated<br>
on separate mesas on a chip to provide a high efficiency coupling of the lasers and<br>
the detectors to a single optical fiber. In accordance with another aspect of the<br>
invention, multiple light emitters and multiple light detectors are fabricated on a<br>
single chip so as to permit coupling of multiple emitters and multiple detectors to a<br>
single fiber. The emitters may be surface emitting devices fabricated on the surface<br><br>
of a chip, such as those described in U.S. Application No. 10/958,069, filed October<br>
5, 2004, or Application No. 10/963,739, filed October 14, 2004 the disclosures of<br>
which are hereby incorporated herein by reference, or may be edge emitting lasers<br>
fabricated on a chip, such as those described in IKS. Patent No. 4,851,368, or IEEE<br>
Journal of Quantum Electronics, volume 28, pages 1227-1231, May 1992, with the<br>
laser outputs being coupled into an optical fiber. The detectors are also fabricated<br>
on the same chip, and may be surface or edge-receiving devices coupled to the<br>
same optical fiber to receive optical signals from the fiber. In a preferred form of the<br>
invention each of the lasers emits light at a different wavelength and each of the<br>
detectors receives light at different wavelengths that differ from those of the emitted<br>
light.<br>
[5] Briefly, the invention incorporates laser emitters and photodetectors<br>
fabricated on a single chip in which one or more semiconductor detector structures<br>
are deposited epitaxially in superimposed layers on a substrate, and a<br>
semiconductor emitter structure is epitaxially deposited on the top detector structure.<br>
The structures are etched to form one or more emitter mesas incorporating surface<br>
or edge emitting lasers to direct emitted light to an optical fiber, and to form one or<br>
more detector mesas incorporating surface or edge receiving detectors for receiving<br>
light from the optical fiber. Reflectors, deflectors, prisms, gratings or other diffraction<br>
elements, and/or lenses may also be fabricated integrally on the substrate or located<br>
adjacent to the chip to direct emitted or received light as required.<br>
[6] In one form of the invention, a monolithically integrated photonic chip includes<br>
a substrate carrying a semiconductor detector epitaxial structure, with a<br>
semiconductor laser structure epitaxially deposited on the detector structure, using<br>
known deposition techniques. A surface-emitting laser is fabricated, as by etching, in<br>
the emitter structure, and is surrounded by a trench, formed, for example, by etching<br>
through the detector structure to the substrate. The surface of the detector structure<br>
adjacent the laser is exposed, as by etching away the covering laser structure, to<br>
form a detector receiver surface which surrounds, or substantially surrounds, the<br>
laser and is spaced from it by the trench, so that the laser and the detector form<br>
separate mesas on the common substrate. A metal layer on the surface of the laser<br>
provides an electrical contact for application of a suitable bias voltage to cause the<br>
laser structure to produce laser light of a known wavelength. The surface-emitting<br>
laser acts as a light source, directing a beam of light upwardly through an external<br><br>
lens to an external optical device such as a single optical fiber. The fiber also may<br>
direct light of a second wavelength toward the chip, with this received light passing<br>
through the lens. Since the received light is of a different wavelength than the light<br>
emitted by the laser, the received light will not be focused back into the laser, but will<br>
be directed by the lens toward the region surrounding the laser source, where it is<br>
received by the detector structure.<br>
[7] In another embodiment of the invention, the monolithically integrated chip<br>
includes two superimposed epitaxially deposited detector structures, with a single<br>
emitter layer superimposed on the top detector structure. A surface-emitting laser is<br>
fabricated on a mesa in the laser structure on the chip, as by etching, and is<br>
separated from a surrounding detector mesa by a trench. The laser structure is then<br>
removed from the surface of the surrounding two-structure detector mesa. The laser<br>
may be energized to emit light of a first wavelength, which may be directed to an<br>
optical fiber through a lens, as discussed above. In this embodiment, however, the<br>
two detector structures are capable of receiving light of second and third<br>
wavelengths, respectively. The provision of a detector mesa around the end and<br>
sides of a surface-emitting laser to substantially surround the emitter end of the laser<br>
optimizes the bidirectional coupling of the laser and detectors to a single input/output<br>
device such as an optical fiber.<br>
[8] In still another embodiment of the invention; a multiplicity of surface-emitting<br>
lasers may be fabricated side-by-side on individual mesas in the laser structure of<br>
the chip, with each laser in the array emitting light of a different wavelength. In<br>
similar fashion, a multiplicity of individual detectors may be fabricated side-by-side<br>
on individual mesas in the detector structure, with each detector being capable of<br>
receiving light of a distinct wavelength. The emitters and detectors may be optically<br>
coupled to a single optic fiber through an external diffraction element such as a<br>
prism, and suitable lenses as required.<br>
[9] Edge-emitting lasers and either surface-receiving or edge-receiving detectors<br>
may also be utilized in the fabrication of the monolithically integrated bidirectional<br>
photonic device of the invention. In one such embodiment, an edge-emitting laser is<br>
fabricated on a mesa in a laser structure and a reflector is fabricated on the chip, for<br>
example in the laser structure adjacent the laser exit facet, to direct emitted light of a<br>
first wavelength vertically upwardly. The reflector may incorporate a flat or a curved<br>
reflector surface to direct the light upwardly through an external lens, for example, to<br><br>
an input/output device such as an optical fiber. The reflector is surrounded by an<br>
exposed surface-receiving detector structure which is on a mesa separate from the<br>
laser mesa and which receives light of a second wavelength from the optical fiber. In<br>
another embodiment, the reflector surface includes a dichroic coating, which reflects<br>
laser light of the first wavelength, but which passes received light of the second<br>
wavelength through the reflector body to the underlying detector structure or<br>
structures.<br>
[10] A multiplicity of edge-emitting lasers may be fabricated in an array in the laser<br>
structure on the chip to direct light of corresponding wavelengths by way of a<br>
diffraction element such as a prism or grating to an external optical fiber. The array<br>
may also include a multiplicity of end-receiving detectors fabricated on separate<br>
mesas in the detector structure and arranged to receive light of different frequencies<br>
from the optical fiber, thus providing a monolithically integrated array of laser and<br>
detector channels, in accordance with the invention.<br>

Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
[27] Turning now to a more detailed description of the invention, there is illustrated<br>
in Fig. 1 a two-layer epitaxial chip 10 incorporating first and second epitaxial<br>
structures 12 and 14 superimposed on each other and on a substrate 16. The first<br>
structure 12 is a semiconductor material that is epitaxially deposited in conventional<br>
manner on a substrate to form a photodetector sensitive to light of a selected<br>
wavelength band. The second structure 14 is another semiconductor material that is<br><br>
epitaxially deposited, again in conventional manner, on the first structure 12 and<br>
from which a laser can be fabricated.<br>
[28] The structures on the substrate 16 may be formed, for example, from a<br>
suitably doped type lll-V compound, or an alloy thereof. Layer 12 may be a<br>
succession of layers deposited by an epitaxial deposition process such as<br>
Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) or Molecular Beam Epitaxy<br>
(MBE). Typically, these layers may include the following layers on an InP substrate:<br>
p-doped InP buffer layer, p-doped InGaAs p-contact layer, p-doped InP transition<br>
layer, undoped InGaAs detection layer, n-doped InP layer, and an n-doped InGaAs<br>
n-contact layer.<br>
[29] The second structure 14 also may be a succession of layers, deposited by the<br>
MOCVD or MBE process on the top surface of structure 12, to form an optical cavity<br>
incorporating an active region. Although other types of laser cavities can be<br>
fabricated in accordance with the invention, the invention will be described herein in<br>
terms of ridge lasers, for convenience. As is typical for solid state ridge lasers, the<br>
structure 14 includes upper and lower cladding regions formed from lower index<br>
semiconductor material, for example InP, than is used in the central active region,<br>
which may be formed with In AllnGaAs - based quantum wells and barriers. A<br>
transition layer of InGaAsP may be formed in addition to a p-doped InGaAs contact<br>
layer on the top part of structure 14 to provide an ohmic contact with a top metal<br>
layer, which is deposited on the structure 14, for connecting the device to a bias<br>
source.<br>
[30] The structures 12 and 14 may share some of the deposited layers, so that the<br>
interface between the structures is common to both. The described layers allow the<br>
fabrication in structure 12 of highly sensitive detectors such as p-i-n detectors and<br>
avalanche photodetectors that will operate in specific wavelength ranges, or bands,<br>
and surface or edge emitting lasers in structure 14 which are able to emit light at<br>
selected wavelengths.<br>
[31] In a first embodiment of the invention, illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3, a monolithic<br>
photonic device, or chip 20 incorporates an integral laser 22 and an integral detector<br>
24 fabricated in separate mesas in respective structures 12 and 14 of the chip 10.<br>
The laser 22 is formed in structure 14 by a conventional masking and etching<br>
technique to produce, for example, an elongated, horizontal ridge-type optical cavity<br>
having a top surface 26, mesa side walls 28 and 30, and first and second ends 32<br><br>
and 34. An angled totally internally reflective facet 35 is formed at the first end 32 to<br>
direct output light propagated in the laser upwardly out of the cavity through a top<br>
emissive surface, while the second end 34 of the cavity is formed by a vertical,<br>
totally internally reflective facet to permit lasing in the optical cavity. The angled facet<br>
35 at end 32 is fabricated by etching the structure 14 downwardly and inwardly at or<br>
near a 45° angle with respect to the top surface 26, and causes light generated in<br>
the optical cavity to be emitted in a direction that is essentially perpendicular to the<br>
surface 26 and to the plane 36 of the active material in the horizontal laser, the<br>
emitted light beam traveling upwardly in the direction indicated by arrow 37. The<br>
limits of the output beam are generally indicated by arrows 38. The laser 22 and<br>
photodetector 24 are electrically and optically isolated from one another in this<br>
arrangement. Optical isolation is improved by incorporating an absorbing or blocking<br>
layer on the laser or the detector. A semiconductor of the appropriate bandgap may<br>
be incorporated as an additional and top layer in the detector epitaxy to highly<br>
absorb one wavelength while allowing other wavelengths of light through. A metallic<br>
layer with an underlying dielectric layer may be used to block stray or unwanted<br>
radiation from the laser in certain locations.<br>
[32] At the second end 34 of the laser, the end facet is formed at 90° angle to the<br>
longitudinal axis of the laser cavity. Adjacent this end of the laser is a monitoring<br>
photodetector (MPD) 40, formed in the laser epitaxial structure 14 by masking and<br>
etching. The laser optical cavity 22 is masked and etched to form a ridge 42<br>
extending between ends 32 and 34 above the active region 36 in structure 14, with<br>
the ridge being widened, as at 44 in Fig. 3, at the emitter end of the laser to provide<br>
an open area above the angled facet 35 to allow the emitted beam 37, which may be<br>
circular or oval, to exit the optical cavity without distortion. The top of the ridge is<br>
coated with an electrical metallization material 46 to permit energization of the laser<br>
by a suitable bias voltage. This metallization is typically coated on a top layer of the<br>
laser structure, which may be a low bandgap semiconductor such as InGaAs, that<br>
allows ohmic contact with the metallization layer. An aperture 48 may be formed in<br>
the top layer or layers of structure 14, as needed, to remove material that might<br>
absorb the emitted light.<br>
[33] The detector 24 is fabricated as a part of the masking and etching process<br>
that forms the laser 22. As illustrated, the portion of structure 14 that overlies the<br>
detector structure 12 around the laser is removed to expose the top surface 50 of<br><br>
the detector structure. The structure 12 is further etched in the region immediately<br>
surrounding the laser 22 to form a trench 52 that separates the laser from the<br>
detector. The trench extends down to, and preferably a short distance into, the<br>
substrate 12 to produce separate laser and detector mesas. The detector may be<br>
further shaped by removing a portion of layer 12 to form a detector mesa defined by<br>
trench 52, as illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3.<br>
[34] The light output from photonic device 20 may be coupled to an external<br>
input/output device such as an optical fiber 60 by way of a lens 62. Because of<br>
chromatic aberrations such a lens will focus light of a particular wavelength, but will<br>
not focus light of a different wavelength. This capability is used in the present<br>
invention to cause outgoing light 37 produced by laser 22, which may, for example,<br>
be a beam having a wavelength of 1310 nm, to be focused onto the end of fiber 60,<br>
as indicated by arrows 64. Incoming light 66 of a different wavelength than the<br>
outgoing light, for example 1490 nm, received from the fiber 60, is directed to the<br>
lens 62, as indicated by arrows 64. Because of its wavelength, this received light is<br>
not tightly focused by the lens 62, as is indicated by beam limit arrows 70. As a<br>
result, the incoming light is not focused on the emitter end of laser 22, but instead is<br>
spread out and impinges on the detector 50 in the region 72 illustrated by dashed<br>
lines in Fig. 3. The preferred design of the laser and detector mesas positions the<br>
emitter region of the laser essentially in the center of the detector 50. If the<br>
incoming light 66 is substantially the same wavelength as the outgoing light 37, for<br>
example both at about 1310nm, with a mismatch in coupling between the laser and<br>
a fiber through a lens, light detection on the detector 50 is possible. Optical isolation<br>
between the laser and detector is improved by incorporating an absorbing<br>
semiconductor layer of a bandgap corresponding to wavelength larger than 1310nm,<br>
but smaller than 1490nm on top of the detector structure. This absorbing layer is<br>
selected to be InGaAsP with a bandgap corresponding to 1440nm. This absorbing<br>
layer absorbs unwanted1310nm light while allowing 1490nm through to the detector<br>
for detection.<br>
[35] A second embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Fig. 4, wherein a chip<br>
78 includes three epitaxial structures, detectors 80 and 82 and laser 84, which are<br>
fabricated on a substrate 86. Those semiconductor structures may share common<br>
layers to facilitate the fabrication of the device. For example, a highly doped<br><br>
semiconductor layer can be introduced between detector layers 80 and 82 to provide<br>
a ground plane to improve electrical isolation and high-speed performance.<br>
[36] A monolithically integrated photonic device 90, illustrated in Fig. 5, may be<br>
fabricated from chip 78 in the manner described above with respect to the device of<br>
Figs. 2 and 3. In this case, a laser 92 is fabricated, as by masking and etching, in<br>
laser structure 84, with the etching forming a trench, similar to the trench 52 of Fig.<br>
3, extending downwardly through both detector structures 80 and 82 to the top of<br>
substrate 86, so that the laser and the surrounding detectors are located on<br>
separate mesas. The laser is etched to form an angled facet 94, which reflects light<br>
propagating in the laser upwardly and out of the laser. The emitted light beam 96,<br>
which has limits defined by arrows 98, is directed upwardly to a lens 100, which<br>
focuses the light on an input/output device 102 such as an optical fiber, as indicated<br>
by arrows 104.<br>
[37] The laser structure 84 is removed, as by etching, from the top surface 110 of<br>
the detector structure 82 to expose the surface-receiving detector layers 80 and 82<br>
to a light beam 114 which is received by the photonic device 90 from fiber 102. This<br>
received light is of a different wavelength than that of the emitted beam 96, and<br>
accordingly is directed by lens 100 onto the detector surface 110, as illustrated by<br>
arrows 114 and as described with respect to Figs. 2 and 3. The detector structure 82<br>
is responsive to the wavelength of this beam to produce a suitable output by way of<br>
an electrode connected to detector 82. In addition, the photonic device 90 can<br>
respond to a second input beam 116 of still another wavelength, which is directed by<br>
lens 100 onto the top surface 110 of detector structure 82, as indicated by arrows<br>
116. The detector structure 82 is not responsive to this beam, but the light passes<br>
through it. The underlying detector structure 80 receives the beam, as indicated by<br>
the arrows 116, and responds to it to produce a corresponding output on a suitable<br>
electrode (not shown).<br>
[38] The photonic device 90, which may be referred to as a triplexer, may emit<br>
light having a wavelength in the range of 1310nm ± 40 nm, while the bandgaps of<br>
the detector layers may be selected so that detector 80 receives light in the range of<br>
1550 nm ± 10 nm, and detector 82 receives light in the range of 1490 nm ± 10 nm.<br>
To do this, the bandgap of detector 82 may be selected to detect light below 1520<br>
nm so that light having longer wavelengths will pass through it to the underlying<br>
detector structure 80. The detector structure 80 may be either a broadband detector<br><br>
or a detector having a bandgap optimized to receive light having a wavelength below<br>
1580 nm.<br>
[39] Although the above-described embodiments show a single laser emitter<br>
location and a single detector location surrounding the laser emitter, it will be<br>
apparent that the integral photonic device of the invention may incorporate multiple<br>
laser locations and multiple detector locations on a single chip, for example as<br>
illustrated in the top plan view of Fig. 6. In this figure, a photonic chip 130<br>
incorporates an array 132 of surface emitting lasers, such as lasers 134,136, 138<br>
and 14, fabricated in an epitaxial laser structure, as described above. The lasers are<br>
illustrated as forming generally parallel light emitting channels, although other chip<br>
architecture designs can be used. Preferably, the emitter surfaces 142, 144,146<br>
and 148, respectively, of the lasers are grouped together for convenience in<br>
directing their output beams upwardly to a common input/output optical fiber 150,<br>
illustrated in Fig. 7, by way of suitable external optics such as a prism 152 and<br>
lenses 154 and 155.<br>
[40] The chip 130 may include surface-receiving detectors fabricated around the<br>
emitting ends of each of the lasers to receive light from fiber 150, in the manner<br>
described above with respect to Figs. 1-5. Alternatively, and as illustrated in Fig. 6,<br>
an array 160 of surface-receiving detectors 162,164, 166 and 168 may be provided<br>
at a location adjacent to the emitters and grouped for convenience in receiving input<br>
light from the input/output fiber 150. Here again, the surface architecture of the chip<br>
may be varied from that illustrated in the figure.<br>
[41] As illustrated, an MPD device may be provided to monitor each of the lasers,<br>
as illustrated at 172, 174, 176 and 178, and suitable bonding pads 180 and ground<br>
lines 182 may be provided on the surface of chip 130, as required, in known<br>
manner. As in prior embodiments of the invention, the lasers 132 are fabricated in a<br>
first epitaxy structure, while the detectors are fabricated in a second epitaxy<br>
structure on a substrate. Each laser in the array 132 may emit light in a different<br>
wavelength band; for example, the surface-emitting lasers 134, 136, and 140 may<br>
emit light at wavelengths of 1470 nm, 1490 nm, 1510 nm, and 1530 nm,<br>
respectively. Similarly, the detectors 162, 164, 166, and 168 may detect light at<br>
respective wavelength bands of 1550 nm, 1570 nm, 1590 nm, and 1610 nm, for<br>
example.<br><br>
[42] In order to have large wavelength variations between the several lasers, for<br>
example for use in applications such as coarse wavelength division multiplexing<br>
(CWDM) where the channel spacing is about 20 nm, the active region of the laser<br>
structure, which is the first, or top, epitaxy structure as described above, needs to<br>
have its bandgap modified so as to allow lasers with appropriate wavelengths to be<br>
fabricated for the laser array. This is done by one of many known processes for<br>
forming the first epitaxial structure; for example by impurity-free vacancy diffusion or<br>
by multiple epitaxial depositions.<br>
[43] The monolithically integrated emitters and detectors of the invention may also<br>
be fabricated as edge-emitting lasers (EEL) with surface-receiving detectors, in the<br>
manner illustrated in Figs. 8-15, to which reference is now made. As illustrated in<br>
the side elevation view of Fig. 8, a laser/detector chip 200 includes an edge-emitting<br>
laser 202 which may be, for example, a Fabry-Perot (FP) laser fabricated in an<br>
epitaxial laser structure 204, and a surface-receiving detector 206 fabricated in an<br>
epitaxial detector structure 208 on a substrate 210. These structures are formed by<br>
masking and etching techniques as described above, with the difference that a<br>
reflective base element 212 is provided adjacent and aligned with, but spaced from,<br>
an emitter facet 214 of the laser 202.<br>
[44] Element 212 may include a flat reflective surface 216 aligned with the optical<br>
axis 218 of laser 202 at its active region, as illustrated in Fig 8, or may include a<br>
curved surface 220, as illustrated in Fig. 9. Light beam 230 emitted by laser 202 is<br>
deflected by surface 216 or by surface 220 through suitable external optics such as<br>
lens 232 to an input/output device such as an optical fiber 234. The base element<br>
212 and the surfaces 216 and 220 may be fabricated by lithography and etching of<br>
the semiconductor laser and detector structures. As illustrated in Fig. 10, the<br>
detector structure is shaped as by etching to surround the base element 212, so that<br>
received light 244 from the optical fiber 234 will be directed by lens 232 onto the<br>
surface of the detector in the region indicated by dotted line 246, in the manner<br>
described above with respect to Figs. 1-5.<br>
[45] The base element 212 alternatively may be fabricated by electron beam<br>
deposition of, for example, silicon, through a lift-off process provide a convenient<br>
structure on top of the detector 206 for reflecting the output of the EEL 202 in a<br>
direction perpendicular to the surface of the chip.<br><br>
[46] Another alternative is illustrated in Figs. 11 and 12, wherein an edge-emitting<br>
laser 250 is integrated with a surface-receiving detector 252 on a substrate 254, with<br>
a reflective base element 256 mounted on the surface of, or positioned above, the<br>
surface of the detector. The base element 256 includes a surface 260, which may<br>
be either flat or curved, and a dichroic filter 262 on surface 260. The filter may be a<br>
multilayer coating on the surface 260, which is designed to reflect one wavelength<br>
band and to allow another wavelength band to pass through. For example, a beam<br>
264 emitted from facet 266 of laser 250, which may have a wavelength band of 1310<br>
nm ± 40 nm (and which may be essentially s-polarized) and directed at an angle of<br>
45° onto filter 262 will be almost completely reflected upwardly through external<br>
optics 266 to an input/output device such as optical fiber 268. Incoming light 270,<br>
which may have a wavelength band of 1490 nm ± 10 nm, also is directed at an angle<br>
of 45° to the filter 262, but this wavelength is almost completely transmitted through<br>
the filter to the underlying detector 252. As illustrated in the top view of Fig. 12, the<br>
received light 270 is directed onto the detector within the dotted line 272, including<br>
the region beneath the base element 256, to provide a greater area of detection, and<br>
thus greater sensitivity to received light.<br>
[47] The reflection versus wavelength behavior of a typical dichroic filter is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 13 by curves 280 and 282. in this case, the base element was InP<br>
and the outside medium was air, and nine layers were used to fabricate the filter<br>
using conventional design techniques.<br>
[48] Figs. 14 and 15 illustrate arrays of edge-emitting lasers and edge-receiving<br>
detectors integrated on chips with on-chip optical elements such as lenses and<br>
prisms. In Fig. 14, an array 290 of edge-emitting lasers and an array 292 of edge-<br>
receiving detectors are fabricated in respective epitaxial laser and detector<br>
structures on a common substrate. On-chip lenses 294 and 296 and prism 298 are<br>
fabricated in alignment with the optical axes of the lasers and detectors in the arrays<br>
290 and 292, using the process described in US Patent No. 6,6532,44, to direct light<br>
300 emitted from the lasers to an optical fiber 302. The optical elements similarly<br>
direct received light 304 from fiber 302 to the detectors of array 292. Alternately, the<br>
on-chip prism 298 is replaced by an on-chip grating 306 to allow for a larger degree<br>
of dispersion for closely-spaced wavelengths, as illustrated in Fig. 15. Other arrays<br>
of closely-spaced laser channels for different light wavelengths may be formed on<br>
the same first epitaxial structure by modifying the architecture of the chip.<br><br>
