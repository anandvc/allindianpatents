				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention generally relates to broadly neutralizing antibodies against Human Immunodeficiency Virus, and methods of making and using the same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the causative agent of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). HIV entry into cells involves formation of a complex between the HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env, which consists of a complex containing the HIV glycoproteins gpl20 and gp4]; gpl20-gp41), a cell-surface receptor (CD4), and a cell-surface co-receptor (e.g., the chemokine receptor CCR5 or CXCR4). Binding of Env to CD4 and either co-receptor initiates a series of conformational changes that are the heart of the fusion machinery leading to viral entry into the target cell. Therefore, efforts to develop a vaccine for the prevention and/or treatment of HIV infection have focused upon the development of neutralizing antibodies that specifically bind to Env. However, the extensive variation of Env in the numerous isolates of HIV so far identified presents a major obstacle in designing an effective immunogen for the isolation of antibodies with broadly neutralizing activity against multiple HIV isolates.<br>
Currently there are only three well-characterized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with broadly neutralizing activity: the anti-gpl20 mAbs bl2 (Burton et al. Science 266:1024-1027. 1994) and 2G12 (Trkola et al. J. F/ro/. 70:1100-1108, 1996), and the anti-gp41 mAb 2F5 (Conley et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91:3348-3352, 1994). Given the ever-increasing number of people infected with HIV, there is a need in the art for additional antibodies with broadly neutralizing activity against HIV, which can be used as passive immunotherapy or passive immunoprophylaxis to treat, ameliorate, inhibit, or prevent HIV infections in individuals who have, or who at risk for developing, such infections. Furthermore, there is a need in the art for new strategies by which to identify and/or isolate such broadly neutralizing aiiti-HIV antibodies.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

Additional advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by<br><br>
means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed.<br>
Definitions<br>
In this specification and in the claims which follow, reference will be made to a number of terms which shall be defined to have the following meanings. It is to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting.<br>
By "specifically binds", "specifically reacts with", "specifically interacts with", and similar terms is meant that an anti-HIV antibody of the invention physically associates with its target molecule (e.g., gpl20 and/or gp41 of HIV Env) to inhibit HIV entry into a cell and/or to inhibit or prevent HIV replication in a mammal. Preferably, the antibody does not substantially physically associate with other molecules.<br>
By a "broadly neutralizing" antibody against HIV, and similar terms, is meant an<br>
antibody that can inhibit the activity (e.g., the ability to enter a target cell) of HIV isolates<br>
from more than one genetic subtype or clade.	r<br>
By "CD4-inducible epitope on HIV Env that is distinct from the co-receptor binding site on gpl20" is meant that an antibody of the invention does not compete with an HIV co-receptor (e.g., CCR5 or CXCR4) for the co-receptor binding site on gpl20. One of ordinal skill in the art will understand how to determine whether an antibody competes with a cO" receptor for the co-receptor binding site on Env, using well-known techniques for measuring competition between two molecules for binding to a particular site on a third molecule.<br>
By "selected" is meant that an antibody or antibody fragment of the invention is chosen or isolated from a group or library of candidate antibodies or antibody fragments using a screening assay for choosing or isolating antibodies with a desired characteristic (e.g., the ability to bind a complex comprising HIV gpI20, CD4, and a co-receptor for HIV; or the ability to specifically bind a CD4-inducible epitope on HIV Env that is enhanced by the binding of Env to a co-receptor for HIV, wherein the CD4-inducible epitope is distinct<br><br>
from the HIV co-receptor binding site on gpl20), as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
By "CD4-inducible epitope" is meant an antigenic site on HIV Env, gpl20, or gp 41 ,wherein specific binding to the antigenic site by an antibody of the invention is increased or augmented by the binding of CD4 to HIV Env, gpl20, or gp4I. Preferably the increase is by at least about 2-fold or greater, e.g., at least about: 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fdd, 5-fold, 6-fold, 7-fold, 8-fold, 9-fold, 10-fold, or more. For example, the binding of the anti-HIV antibody X5 (described herein) to gpl20 is increased by about 5- to 10-fold when CD4 is present (i.e., when gpl20 is bound to CD4, e.g., sCD4).<br>
By "exposure of the epitope is enhanced" or "epitope that is enhanced" is meant that specific binding of an antibody of the invention to its cognate CD4-inducible epitope on HIV Env, gpl20, or gp 41 is further augmented by the binding of HIV Env, gpl20, or gp41 to a co-receptor for HIV (such as the chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4). Preferably the increase is by at least about 1.2-fold or greater, e.g., at least about 1.3-, 1.4-, 1.5-, 1.6-, 1.7-, 1.8-, 1.9-, or 2-fold, or greater.<br>
By "soluble CD4" or "sCD4" or D1D2" is meant a CD4 molecule, or a fragment thereof, that is in aqueous solution and that can mimic the activity of native membrane-anchored CD4 by altering the conformation of HIV Env, as is understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. One example of a soluble CD4 is the two-domain soluble CD4 (sCD4 or D1D2) described, e.g., in Salzwedel et al. J. Virol. 74:326-333, 2000.<br>
By " isolated polypeptide" is meant a polypeptide (or a fragment thereof) that has been separated from the components that naturally accompany it. Typically, the polypeptide is substantially pure when it is at least 60%, by weight, free from the proteins and naturally-occurring organic molecules with which it is naturally associated. Preferably, the polypeptide is at least 75%, more preferably at least 80%) or 90%, and most preferably at least 95%, by weight, pure. A substantially pure polypeptide may be obtained, for example, by extraction from a natural source (e.g., a cell), by expression of a recombinant nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide, or by chemically synthesizing the polypeptide. Purity can be measured by any appropriate method, e.g., by column chromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or HPLC analysis.<br><br>
A protein is substantially free of naturally associated components when it is separated from those contaminants which accompany it in its natural state. Thus, a protein which is chemically synthesized or produced in a cellular system different from the cell from which it naturally originates will be substantially free from its naturally associated components. Accordingly, substantially pure polypeptides not only includes those derived from eukaryotic organisms but also those synthesized in E. coli or other prokaryotes.<br>
By "isolated nucleic acid" is meant a nucleic acid molecule that is free of the genes which, in the naturally-occurring genome of the organism from which the DNA of the invention is derived, flank the gene. The term therefore includes, for example, a recombinant DNA which is incorporated into a vector; into an autonomously replicating plasmid or virus; or into the genomic DNA of a prokaryote or eukaryote; or which exists as a separate molecule (e.g., a cDNA or a genomic or cDNA fragment produced by PCR or restriction endonuclease digestion, or an mRNA transcribed from a recombinant DNA template) independent of other sequences. It also includes a recombinant DNA which is part of a hybrid gene encoding additional polypeptide sequence.<br>
By "expression vector" is meant a DNA construct that contains a promoter operably linked to a downstream gene or coding region (e.g., a cDNA or genomic DNA fragment, which encodes a polypeptide or polypeptide fragment). Introduction of the expression vector into the appropriate recipient cell (e.g., a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell, e.g., a bacterium, yeast, insect cell, or mammalian cell, depending upon the promoter within the expression vector) allows the cell to express mRNA encoded by the expression vector, which is then translated into the encoded polypeptide or polypeptide fragment. Vectors for in vitro transcription/translation are also well-known in the art. An expression vector may be a genetically engineered plasmid, virus, or artificial chromosome derived from, for example, a bacteriophage, adenovirus, retrovirus, poxvirus, or herpesvirus.<br>
By "effective amount" is meant the amount of an anti-HIV antibody of the invention that is useful for treating, partially or completely inhibiting, or preventing an HIV infection in a patient or subject or partially or completely inhibiting entry of HIV into a cell, as described herein. Effective dosages and schedules for administering the antibodies of the invention may be determined empirically, and making such determinations is routine to one of ordinary skill in the art. The skilled artisan will understand that the dosage of anti-HIV<br><br>
antibodies will vary, depending upon, for example, the species of the subject the route of administration, the particular antibody to be used, other drugs being administered, and the age, condition, sex and extent of the disease in the subject. The dosage can be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any counter-indications. A effective dose of an anti-HIV antibody of the invention generally will range between about 1 |xg/kg of body weight and 100 mg/kg of body weight. Examples of such dosage ranges are (but are not limited to), e.g., about lfj,g-100 (xg/kg 100 |xg-l mg/kg, 1 mg/kg-10 mg/kg, or 10 mg-100 mg/kg, once a week, bi-weekly, daily, or two to four times daily.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a bar graph showing that the X5 epitope is induced by sCD4 and its exposure enhanced by dsCCRS. BSA, gpl20jRFL, gpl20jRFL + sCD4, gpl20Bai-CD4, sCD4 (D1D2) or dsCCRS (100 ng each in 0.1 ml solution) were coated on an ELISA plate overnight at 4oC after which the wells were blocked with 4% milk in Tris-buffered saline. Detergent (0.5% Cymal-5)- solubilized CCR5 (dsCCRS) at 100 ng per well containing 0.1 ml buffer was added. In control experiment without dsCCRS Cymal-S (O.S%) buffer was added and incubated overnight at 4°C, then XS Fab was used as primary antibody (Ab) followed by goat anti-human F(ab")2-HRP to detect the signal.<br>
Fig. 2 is a diagram showing binding isotherms of X5 to gpl20 and gpl20-sCD4. Experimental data for gp 12089 6 and sCD4-gpl2089 6 obtained as described for Fig. 1 were analyzed by fitting them to an equation describing the Langmuir adsorption isotherm (B/Bmax=X5/(Kd+X5), where B is the amount of bound XS, B„,ax is the maximal amount of bound XS, XS is its bulk concentration and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant (affinity is the inverse of Kd). The continuous lines represent fitting of the data for X5 binding to gp 12089.6 (lower curve) and sCD4-gp 12089.6 (upper curve) with Kd equal to 9.3 nM and 1.0 nM, respectively.<br>
Fig. 3 is a graph showing binding of antibodies X5, bl2, and 17b to cell surface-associated functional oligomeric gpl20-gp41. The T-cell line H9 was infected with the HIV-1 TCLA X4 MN isolate for 10 days. At this time post-infection there was no detectable CD4 remaining at the cell surface, and no syncytium formation in the culture, but strong Env expression was detected using gpl20-specific mAbs and flow cytometry. H9<br><br>
cells were pre-incubated with sCD4 (20 |4.g/ml) or buffer alone for Ih at RT, then incubated with X5 Fab, the anti-CD4i mAb 17b or the anti-CD4BS Fab IgGlbl2 at various concentrations. The amount of bound antibodies was measured by flow cytometry.<br>
Fig. 4 is a bar grapli showing inhibition of sCD4-induced fusion by X5. Fusion between 293 cells, expressing CCR5 or CXCR4 after infection with recombinant vaccinia viruses (PMl 107 or DM 1107, respectively), and 293 cells, expressing HIV-lgg.eEnv after infection with recombinant vaccinia virus, induced by soluble CD4, was measured by the beta-galactosidase assay. The Env-expressing cells were mixed with sCD4 (1 ug/ml) and X5 (0, 125, 250, 500 ng/ml) for 30 min at 37°C. In a control experiment (con) no sCD4 was added. These cells were mixed with the cells expressing receptor molecules at a ratio of 1:1 (total number of cells equal to 2x105 in 96-well plate format). Fusion was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 37°C and quantitated by a colorimetric assay which measures the optical density at 595 nm (OD595).<br>
Figs. 5A and 5B are graphs showing neutralization of HIV infection by X5. Infection of HOS CD4.CXCR4 or HOS CD4.CCR5 cells by pseudotyped HIV-1NU-3 was monitored by a reporter gene assay performed as described in the Materials and Methods section of Example I.<br>
Figs. 6A and 6B are graphs showing antibody competition assays for characterization of the X5 epitope. To characterize the X5 epitope, known CD4-inducible monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were tested in an competition ELISA assay. Nunc-Immuno^"^ Maxisorp^"^ surface plates (Nalge Nunc International, Denmark) were coated with 100 ul of gpl20 (Fig. 6A) or gpl20+CD4 (Fig. 6B) (0.5 ug/ml each) in carbonated buffer, blocked with 4% milk in TBS. Fab X5 was biotinylated and a fixed concentration (0.5 ug/ml) was added to each well along with increasing concentrations (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 ug/ml) of indicated mAbs. Binding of biotinylated X5 was detected using streptavidin-HRP secondary Ab. Unbiotinylated X5 was also tested (at 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 ug/ml) and more than 50% inhibition was detected at 1 ug/ml concentration.<br>
Fig. 7 is a diagram showing the sequence of the X5 light chain (SEQ ID NO: 2). The OmpA signal sequence, three framework regions (FR1-FR3), three complementarity-determining regions (CDR1-CDR3), kappa chain joining region (JK), and light chain constant region (CL) are indicated by heavy horizontal lines above the relevant amino acids.<br><br>
Fig. 8 is a diagram showing the sequence of the X5 heavy chain (SEQ ID NO:<br>
3). The PelB signal sequence, four framework regions (FR1-FR4), three complementarity-determining regions (CDR1-CDR3), and heavy chain constant region 1 (CHI) are indicated by heavy horizontal lines above the relevant amino acids. The two amino acid positions that are substituted in the X5 sequence variant FabS (described in Example II), are shown below the original X5 heavy chain sequence.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Binding of the HIV envelope glycoprotein (also known as Env or gpl20-gp41) to CD4 and the co-receptor CCR5 or CXCR4 initiates a series of conformational changes that are the heart of the fusion machinery leading to viral entry. The elucidation of the nature of the Env conformational changes is not only a clue to the mechanism of HIV-1 entry but also provides new tools for the development of inhibitors and vaccines.<br>
Described herein is a novel approach for the identification"tif broadly cross-reactive antibodies that neutralize multiple genetic subtypes of HIV. This approach involves the use of purified Env-CD4-co-receptor complexes for screening libraries of antibodies or antibody fragments that specifically bind to receptor-inducible HIV epitopes. Such antibodies can be used for treating, inhibiting, and/or preventing HIV infection by providing passive immunity to treated individuals. Currently there are known only three well characterized monoclonal antibodies with broadly neutralizing activity, and none of these antibodies is directed against a receptor-inducible epitope.<br>
Using this approach, a novel human antibody Fab fragment, denoted "X5", was identified by screening a phage display library, as described in Example I below. The epitope recognized by the X5 antibody is inducible by CD4 and exposure of the epitope is enhanced by the major HIV-1 co-receptor CCR5. The antibody neutralizes R5 and R5X4 viruses, including primary isolates, and to lesser extent, X4 viruses. Sequence variants and antibody fusion proteins based on X5 are also described herein, and will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Antibodies<br><br>
The term "antibodies" is used herein in a broad sense and includes both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. In addition to intact immunoglobulin molecules, also included in the term "antibodies" are fragments of immunoglobulin molecules and multimers of immunoglobulin molecules (e.g., diabodies, triabodies, and bi-specific and tri-specific antibodies, as are known in the art; see, e.g., Hudson and Kortt, J. Immunol. Methods 231:177-189, 1999), fusion proteins containing an antibody or antibody fragment (e.g., a fusion protein containing a fragment of CD4, e.g., sCD4 (Salzwedel et al. J. Virol. 74:326-333, 2000), which are produced using standard molecular biology techniques, single chain antibodies, and human or humanized versions of immunoglobulin molecules or fragments thereof, as long as they are chosen for their ability to broadly neutralize HIV (e.g., multiple genetic subtypes of HIV-1 or HIV-2) by binding a CD4-inducible HIV epitope that is enhanced by binding an HIV co-receptor, as described herein. The antibodies are tested for their desired activity using the in vitro assays described herein, or by analogous methods, after which their in vivo therapeutic and/or prophylactic activities are tested according to known clinical testing methods.<br>
The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody or antibody fragment obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies or antibody fragments, i.e., the individual antibodies within the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in a small subset of the antibody molecules. The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include "chimeric" antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, as long as they exhibit the desired antagonistic activity (See U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567 and Morrison et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 81:6851-6855 (1984)).<br>
Monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be prepared using hybridoma methods, such as those described by Kohler and Milstein, Nature, 256:495 (1975). In a hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal is typically immunized with an immunizing agent to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies<br><br>
that will specifically bind to the immunizing agent. Alternatively, the lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro, e.g., using the HIV Env-CD4-co-receptor complexes described herein.<br>
The monoclonal antibodies may also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567 (Cabilly et al.). DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). Libraries of antibodies or active antibody fragments can also be generated and screened using phage display techniques, e.g., as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,804,440 (Burton et al.) and U.S. Patent No. 6,096,441 (Barbas et al.). Recombinant antibodies, antibody fragments, and fusions and polymers thereof can be expressed in vitro or in prokaryotic cells (e.g., bacteria) or eukaryotic cells (e.g., yeast, insect, or mammalian cells) and further purified, as necessary, using well known methods (see, e.g., Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1989); and Ausubel et al.. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, NY, 2001, which is updated quarterly).<br>
In vitro methods are also suitable for preparing monovalent antibodies. Digestion of antibodies to produce fragments thereof, particularly. Fab fragments, can be accomplished using routine techniques known in the art. For instance, digestion can be performed using papain. Examples of papain digestion are described in WO 94/29348 published Dec. 22, 1994 and U.S. Patent No. 4,342,566. Papain digestion of antibodies typically produces two identical antigen binding fragments, called Fab fragments, each with a single antigen binding site, and a residual Fc fragment. Pepsin treatment yields a fragment that has two antigen combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.<br>
Any antibody or antibody fragment of the invention, whether attached to other sequences or not, can also include insertions, deletions, substitutions, or other selected modifications of particular regions or specific amino acids residues, provided the activity of the antibody or antibody fragment is not significantly altered or impaired compared to the non-modified antibody or antibody fragment. These modifications can provide for some additional property, such as to remove/add amino acids capable of disulfide bonding, to increase its bio-longevity, to alter its secretory characteristics, etc. In any case, the antibody<br><br>
or antibody fragment must possess a bioactive property, such as specific binding to its cognate antigen. Functional or active regions of the antibody or antibody fragment may be identified and/or improved by mutagenesis of a specific region of the protein, followed by expression and testing of the expressed polypeptide. For example, amino acid sequence variants of antibodies or antibody fragments can be generated and those that display equivalent or improved affinity for antigen can be identified using standard techniques and/or those described herein. Methods for generating amino acid sequence variants are readily apparent to a skilled practitioner in the art and can include site-specific mutagenesis or random mutagenesis (e.g., by PCR) of the nucleic acid encoding the antibody or antibody fragment (ZoUer, M.J. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 3:348-354, 1992). Both naturally occurring and non-naturally occurring amino acids (e.g., artificially-derivatized amino acids) may be used to generate amino acid sequence variants of the antibodies and antibody fragments of the invention.<br>
As used herein, the term "antibody" or "antibodies" can also refer to a human antibody and/or a humanized antibody. Many non-human antibodies (e.g., those derived from mice, rats, or rabbits) are naturally antigenic in humans, and thus can give rise to undesirable immune responses when administered to humans. Therefore, the use of human or humanized antibodies in the methods of the invention serves to lessen the chance that an antibody administered to a human will evoke an undesirable immune response.<br>
Human antibodies<br>
The human antibodies of the invention can be prepared using any technique. Examples of techniques for human monoclonal antibody production include those described by Cole et al. {Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77, 1985) and by Boerner et al. (J. Immunol, 147(l):86-95, 1991). Human antibodies of the invention (and fragments thereof) can also be produced using phage display libraries (Hoogenboom et al., J. Mol. Biol, 227:381, 1991; Marks et al., J. Mol Biol, 222:581, 1991; and C.F. Barbas, D.R. Burton, J.K. Scott, G.J. Silverman, Phage Display: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 2001).<br>
The human antibodies of the invention can also be obtained from transgenic animals. For example, transgenic, mutant mice that are capable of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies, in response to immunization, have been described (see, e.g.,<br><br>
Jakobovits et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:2551-255 (1993); Jakobovits et al., Nature, 362:255-258 (1993); Bruggermann et al., Year in Immunol, l-."i"i (1993)). Specifically, the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region Q(H)) gene in these chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production, and the successful transfer of the human germ-line antibody gene array into such germ-line mutant mice results in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. Antibodies having the desired activity are selected using Env-CD4-co-receptor complexes as described herein.<br>
Humanized antibodies<br>
Antibody humanization techniques generally involve the use of recombinant DNA technology to manipulate the DNA sequence encoding one or more polypeptide chains of an antibody molecule. Accordingly, a humanized form of a non-human antibody (or a fragment thereof) is a chimeric antibody or antibody chain (or a fragment thereof, such as an Fv, Fab, Fab", or other antigen-binding portion of an antibody) which contains a portion of an antigen binding site from a non-human (donor) antibody integrated into the framework of a human (recipient) antibody.<br>
To generate a humanized antibody, residues from one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of a recipient (human) antibody molecule are replaced by residues from one or more CDRs of a donor (non-human) antibody molecule that is known to have desired antigen binding characteristics (e.g., a certain level of specificity and affinity for the target antigen). In some instances, Fv framework (FR) residues of the human antibody are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Humanized antibodies may also contain residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies. Humanized antibodies generally contain at least a portion of an antibody constant region (Fc), typically that of a human antibody (Jones et al.. Nature, 321:522-525 (1986), Reichmann et al.. Nature, 332:323-327 (1988), and Presta, Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol, 2:593-596(1992)).<br><br>
Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art. For example, humanized antibodies can be generated according to the methods of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al. Nature, 321:522-525 (1986), Riechmann et al.. Nature, 332:323-327 (1988), Verhoeyen et al.. Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988)), by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Methods that can be used to produce humanized antibodies are also described in U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567 (Cabilly et al.), U.S. Patent No. 5,565,332 (Hoogenboom et al.), U.S. Patent No. 5,721,367 (Kay et al.), U.S. Patent No. 5,837,243 (Deo et al.), U.S. Patent No. 5, 939,598 (Kucherlapati et al.), U.S. Patent No. 6,130,364 (Jakobovits et al.), and U.S. Patent No. 6,180,377 (Morgan et al.). Administration of antibodies<br>
Antibodies of the invention are preferably administered to a subject in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Suitable carriers and their formulations are described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (19th ed.) ed. A.R. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA 1995. Typically, an appropriate amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt is used in the formulation to render the formulation isotonic. Examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier include, but are not limited to, saline, Ringer"s solution and dextrose solution. The pH of the solution is preferably from about 5 to about 8, and more preferably from about 7 to about 7.5. Further carriers include sustained release preparations such as semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, liposomes or microparticles. It will be apparent to those persons skilled in the art that certain carriers may be more preferable depending upon, for instance, the route of administration and concentration of antibody being administered.<br>
The antibodies can be administered to the subject, patient, or cell by injection (e.g., but not limited to, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular), or by other methods such as infusion that ensure its delivery to the bloodstream in an effective form. Local or intravenous injection is preferred.<br>
Effective dosages and schedules for administering the antibodies may be determined empirically, and making such determinations is within the skill in the art. Those skilled in the art will understand that the dosage of antibodies that must be administered will vary<br><br>
depending on, for example, the subject that will receive the antibody, the route of administration, the particular type of antibody used and other drugs being administered. Guidance in selecting appropriate doses for antibodies is found in the literature on therapeutic uses of antibodies, e.g.. Handbook of Monoclonal Antibodies, Ferrone et al., eds., Noges Publications, Park Ridge, N.J., (1985) ch. 22 and pp. 303-357; Smith et al.. Antibodies in Human Diagnosis and Therapy, Haber et al., eds.. Raven Press, New York (1977) pp. 365-389. A typical daily dosage of the antibody used alone might range from about 1 |u,g/kg to up to 100 mg/kg of body weight or more per day, depending on the factors mentioned above.<br>
Following administration of an antibody for treating, inhibiting, or preventing an HIV infection, the efficacy of the therapeutic antibody can be assessed in various ways well known to the skilled practitioner. For instance, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that an antibody of the invention is efficacious in treating or inhibiting an HIV infection in a subject by observing that the antibody reduces viral load or delays or prevents a further increase in viral load. Viral loads can be measured by methods that are known in the art, for example, using polymerase chain reaction assays to detect the presence of HIV nucleic acid or antibody assays to detect the presence of HIV protein in a sample (e.g., but not limited to, blood or another body fluid) from a subject or patient, or by measuring the level of circulating anti-HIV antibodies in the patient. Efficacy of the antibody treatment may also be determined by measuring the number of CD4+ T cells in the HIV-infected subject. An antibody treatment that delays or inhibits an initial or further decrease in CD4+ T cells in an HIV-positive subject or patient, or that results in an increase in the number of CD4+ T cells in the HIV-positive subject, is an efficacious antibody treatment.<br>
The broadly-neutralizing antibodies of the invention can also be administered prophylactically to patients or subjects who are at risk for being exposed to HIV or who have been newly exposed to HIV. Such patients include, but are not limited to, healthcare workers; fetuses, neonates, or infants (e.g., nursing infants) whose mothers are infected or at risk for being infected; intravenous drug users; recipients of blood transfusions, blood products, or transplantation tissue; and other individuals who have been exposed to a body fluid that contains or may contain HIV.<br><br>
In subjects who have been newly exposed to HIV but who have not yet displayed the presence of the virus (as measured by PCR or other assays for detecting the virus) in blood or other body fluid, efficacious treatment with an antibody of the invention partially or completely inhibits or delays the appearance of the virus or minimizes the level of the virus in the blood or other body fluid of the exposed individual. Nucleic acid approaches for antibody delivery<br>
The broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies and antibody fragments of the invention can also be administered to patients or subjects as a nucleic acid preparation (e.g., DNA or RNA) that encodes the antibody or antibody fragment, such that the patient"s or subject"s own cells take up the nucleic acid and produce and secrete the encoded antibody or antibody fragment, thereby treating, inhibiting, or preventing HIV infection. Nucleic acid delivery<br>
In the methods described above which include the administration and uptake of exogenous DNA into the cells of a subject (i.e., gene transduction or transfection), the nucleic acids of the present invention can be in the form of free DNA or RNA, or the nucleic acids can be in a vector for delivering the nucleic acids to a cell and expressing the encoded polypeptide within a cell, whereby the antibody-encoding DNA fragment is under the transcriptional regulation of a promoter, as well as an other necessary and/or desirable components to regulate and/or enhance transcription and/or stability of the mRNA and to regulate and/or enhance translation of the encoded polypeptide, as would be well understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. The vector can be a commercially available preparation, such as a plasmid or an adenovirus vector (Quantum Biotechnologies, Inc. (Laval, Quebec, Canada).<br>
Delivery of the nucleic acid or vector to cells can be via a variety of mechanisms. As one example, delivery can be via a liposome, using commercially available liposome preparations such as LIPOFECTIN, LIPOFECTAMINE (GIBCO-BRL, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), SUPERFECT (Qiagen, Inc. Hilden, Germany), and TRANSFECTAM (Promega Biotec, Inc., Madison, WI), as well as other liposomes developed according to procedures standard in the art. Delivery can also be by injection (e.g., but not limited to, intravenous or intramuscular) of naked DNA, e.g., in a plasmid or viral vector. In addition, the nucleic acid or vector of this invention can be delivered in vivo by electroporation, the technology<br><br>
for which is available from Genetronics, Inc. (San Diego, CA) as well as by means of a SONOPORATION machine (ImaRx Pharmaceutical Corp., Tucson, AZ).<br>
As one example, vector delivery can be via a viral system, such as a retroviral vector system which can package a recombinant retroviral genome (see e.g., Pastan et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85:4486, 1988; Miller et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 6:2895, 1986). The recombinant retrovirus can then be used to infect and thereby deliver to the infected cells nucleic acid encoding a broadly neutralizing antibody (or active fragment thereof) of the invention. The exact method of introducing the altered nucleic acid into mammalian cells is, of course, not limited to the use of retroviral vectors. Other techniques are widely available for this procedure including the use of adenoviral vectors (Mitani et al.. Hum. Gene Then 5:941-948, 1994), adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors (Goodman et al.. Blood 84:1492-1500, 1994), lentiviral vectors (Naidini et al.. Science 272:263-267, 1996), pseudotyped retroviral vectors (Agrawal et al., Exper. Hematol. 24:738-747, 1996). Physical transduction techniques can also be used, such as liposome delivery and receptor-mediated and other endocytosis mechanisms (see, for example, Schwartzenberger et al., Blood 87:472-478, 1996). This invention can be used in conjunction with any of these or other commonly used gene transfer methods.<br>
For example, if the antibody-encoding nucleic acid of the invention is delivered to the cells of a subject in an adenovirus vector, the dosage for administration of adenovirus to humans can range from about 10^ to 10^ plaque forming units (pfu) per injection but can be as high as lO"^ pfu per injection (Crystal, Hum. Gene Ther. 8:985-1001, 1997; Alvarez and Curiel, Hum. Gene Ther. 8:597-613, 1997). A subject can receive a single injection, or, if additional injections are necessary, they can be repeated at six month intervals (or other appropriate time intervals, as determined by the skilled practitioner) for an indefinite period and/or until the efficacy of the treatment has been established.<br>
Parenteral administration of the nucleic acid or vector of the present invention, if used, is generally characterized by injection. Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution of suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as emulsions. A more recently revised approach for parenteral administration involves use of a slow release or sustained release system such that a constant dosage is maintained. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 3,610,795, which is<br><br>
orporated by reference herein. For additional discussion of suitable formulations and various routes of administration of therapeutic compounds, see, e.g.. Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (19th ed.) ed. A.R. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA 1995.<br>
The present invention is more particularly described in the following examples, which are intended as illustrative only, since numerous modifications and variations therein will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>

CfZTh cells expressing high amounts of CCR5 were gift from J. Sodroski (Dana Farber Institute, Boston, MA); the parental cells was purchased from ATCC and used as negative control. The stable cell line TF228 expressing LAI Env was a gift from Z. Jonak (SmithKline Beechman Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, PA) through R. Blumenthal (NCI-Frederick, Frederick, MD). Recombinant vaccinia viruses used for the reporter gene fusion assay were described previously (Nussbaum et al. J. Virol. 68:5411-5422, 1994). Plasmids expressing various Envs were obtained through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program or were gift from M.A. Martin (NIAID, Bethesda, MD).

Purified gpl20g9.6 and gpHOgg.e were produced by recombinant vaccinia virus (gift of R. Doms, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) with a combination of lentil lectin affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. Recombinant gpl20jRFL was a gift from A. Schultz and N. Miller (NIAID, Bethesda, MD). The fusion protein gpl20Bai-CD4 (Fouts et al. J. Virol. 74:11427-11436, 2000) was a gift from T. Fouts (Institute of Human Virology, Baltimore, MD). The anti-CD4 polyclonal antibody T4-4 was obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program from R. Sweet (SmithKline Beechman Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, PA). The anti-gpl20 mAbs 17b, 48d, 23e and 21c were gift from J. Robinson<br><br>
(Tulane University Medical Center, New Orleans, LA). The anti-CCR5 mAb 5C7 was a gift from L. Wu (Millenium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA). The goat polyclonal anti-CCR5 antibody CKR5(C20) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biothechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA).<br>
Production, purification and quantification of gpl20-CD4-CCR5 complexes. NIH 3T3 transfectants (10^ in 100 ml) expressing high amounts of CD4 and CCR5 were washed twice with cold (4°C) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) then pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 ml lysis buffer (1% Brij 97, 5 mM iodoacetamide, added immediately before use, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris (pH 8.2), 20 mM EDTA, and protease inhibitors) at 4°C for 40 min with gentle mixing. An anti-CCR5 antibody at 2 jig/ml was added to the cell suspension and incubated with gentle mixing for 4 hours at 4°C. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 25 min in a refrigerated centrifuge. Protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) (1 ml) prewashed with PBS were added to the cell lysate and incubated at 4°C for 14 hours. The beads were then washed five times with 100 ml of ice cold lysis buffer and incubated with JRFL gpl20 at 5 ^g/rnl in 20 ml lysis buffer for 1 hour at 4°C. They were again washed five times with 100 cold lysis buffer, incubated with 1% formaldehyde overnight, washed twice with cold lysis buffer and used. They contained approximately 0.01 mg CD4 and 0.02 mg gpl20, as quantified by calibrating amounts of soluble CD4 and gpl20. For quantification of CD4 and gpl20 two duplicated samples each containing 0.1% of the total amount of bead-associated gpl20-CD4-CCR5 complexes were used. They were eluted by adding 4X sample buffer for SDS-PAGE gel and kept overnight at 37°C. They were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel simultaneously with calibrating amounts (1,3, 10, 30, 100 ng) of soluble four-domain CD4 (sCD4) (see, e.g., Deen et al. Nature 331:82-84, 1988) or gpl20 and were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 20 mM tris-HCl (pH 7.6) buffer containing 140 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20 and 5% nonfat powdered milk. For Western blotting these membranes were incubated with anti-CD4 or anti-gpl20 antibodies, then washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies. They were developed by using the supersignal chemiluminescent substrate from Pierce (Rockford, IL). The images were acquired by a BioRad phosphoimager (BioRad, Hercules, CA). The signal from the calibrating molecules<br><br>
was integrated for each band and plotted in a calibration curve for the signal vs. amount dependence. The amounts of CD4 and gpl20 were then calculated by interpolation using the calibration curve.<br>
Screening of the phage display library. A phage library (IgGlk) from a seropositive individual with a relatively high cross-clade neutralizing antibody titer (FDA2), constructed as described (Burton et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:10134-10137, 1991; and C.F. Barbas, D.R. Burton, J.K. Scott, G.J. Silverman, Phage Display: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 2001) was used. Phages (50 |j,l) were preadsorbed on protein G beads in PBS for 1 h at 37°C. Unbound phages were recovered by centrifugation (1500 rpm for 5 min at 4°C) and then incubated with protein G beads associated with gpl20-CD4-CCR5 complexes for 2 hours at 4°C under gentle agitation. Beads were washed 10 times with PBS containing 0.5% Tween.<br>
Phages were eluted from the beads by incubation with 50 pd O.IM HCl-glycine (pH 2.2) solution containing BSA at 1 mg/ml for 10 min at room temperature. The solution was neutralized with 3 fil of 2M TRIS-base. XL 1-Blue E. coli cells were reinfected and panning repeated for total of 5 rounds of panning.<br>
Preparation of soluble Fab fragments. Phagemid DNA was isolated and digested with Spe I and Nhe I to remove the gene III fragment and self-religated as described elsewhere (Barbas et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. US.A. 88:7978-7982, 1991). The Agene III-phagemid library was used to transform XLl-Blue E. coli cells to produce clones secreting Fab fragments. 60 such clones were grown up and the corresponding Fabs were obtained by lysing the cell pellet. Cells were frozen in a dry ice-ethanol bath for 5 min followed by thawing in a 37°C water bath. This process was repeated four times and the cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C.<br>
ELISA analysis of Fab supernatants. ELISA wells were coated overnight at 4°C with 50 ^il of gpl20 (10 |xg/ml in PBS), blocked in 100 ^il of 3% BSA/PBS for 1 hour at RT. After 5 washes with 0.05% Tween20/PBS (Washing Buffer, WB), wells were incubated with 50 ii\ Fab supernatants for 1 hour at RT. After 10 washes with WB, 50 |xl of a 1:1000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG F(ab")2 was added and incubated for 1 hour at RT. Following 10 washes with WB, the assay was developed with/?-<br><br>
nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and monitored at 405 nm. Heavy chains from positive clones were sequenced using the SeqGz primer (5"-GAAGTAGTCCTTGACCAG-3"; SEQ ID NO: 1).<br>
Production and purification of Fab. The selected phage was amplified and purified by standard methods (see C.F. Barbas, D.R. Burton, J.K. Scott, G.J. Silverman, Phage Display: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 2001). Protein G columns were used for purification.<br>
Production and purification of detergent solubilized CCR5 (dsCCRS). DsCCRS was produced by a methodology adapted from that described previously (Mirzabekov et al. J. Biol. Chem. 274:28745-28750, 1999).<br>
Cell-cell fusion inhibition assay. The gene reporter cell-cell fusion assay was previously described (Nussbaum et al. J. Virol. 68:5411-5422, 1994). Briefly, recombinant vaccinia viruses at multiplicity of infection 10 were used to infect the target (vCB21R) and effector cells (vTF 7.3 plus virus expressing the HIV-1 Env). The P-gal fusion assay was performed two hours after mixing the cells. The extent of fusion was quantitated colorimetrically. Fusion induced by sCD4 was performed by incubation of 10^ effector cells expressing the Env with sCD4 (1 ug/ml) at 37°C for 30 min before mixing with the target cells (Salzwedel et al. J. Virol. 74:326-333, 2000). The inhibitory effect of X5 was evaluated by mixing the effector cells with X5 for 30 min at 37°C and then performing the fusion assay.<br>
HIV neutralization assay. Virus neutralization assays were performed by using infection with a luciferase reporter HIV-1 Env pseudotyping system (Connor et al. Virology 206:935-944, 1995). Viral stocks were prepared by transfecting 293T cells with plasmids encoding the luciferase virus backbone (pNL-Luc-ER) and Env from various HIV strains. The resulting supernatant was clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 2,000 rpm in a Sorvall RT-7 centrifuge (RTH-750 rotor), passed through a 45-um pore size sterile filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and used or stored at -80°C. The virus was pre-incubated with various concentrations of X5 (0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 50, and 80 or 100 ug/ml) for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were then infected with 50 ^il of virus preparation for 4 h at 37°C, then fresh media was added and incubation was continued for 48 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and lysed with luciferase assay buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was<br><br>
determined by adding 50 \i] of freshly prepared luciferase assay substrate to 50 ^il of cell lysate and measuring the intensity of chemiluminescence in a LumiCount microplate luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). All experiments were performed at least in triplicate and the results expressed as relative light units (RLU) per second.<br>
ELISA binding assay. The assay used for binding is a modified ELISA type assay. Briefly, gpl20 or sCD4-gpl20 was non-specifically attached to the bottom of 96-well plates by incubation of 0.1 ml solution containing 100 ng of the protein at 4°C overnight. Plates were then treated with 4% non-fat milk (Biorad) in order to prevent nonspecific binding. The plates were washed with TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20; dsCCRS in Cymal lysis buffer (1% Cymal, 100 mM (NH4)2S04, 20 mM Tris, 10% glycerol) was then added and incubated at 4°C overnight. Unbound molecules of dsCCRS were washed and X5 was added. After washing bound X5 was detected by anti-human IgG.<br>
The antibody competition experiment was performed by using a mixture of the competing Ab (at different concentrations) with 0.5 ug/ml biotinylated X5 instead of X5 alone following the procedure as described above. Biotinylated proteins were prepared by incubation with 2 mM biotin (prepared from solid NHS-LS-Biotin (Pierce, CA) dissolved at 200 mM in DMSO as stock solution) on wet ice for 1 h. The biotinylation was quenched with 20 mM glycine on ice for 15 min. Binding of biotinylated X5 was detected using streptavidin-HRP secondary antibody.<br>
Flow cytometry. Cells (typically 0.5 x 10^) were incubated for 1 h on ice with the antigen specific antibodies. They were washed, and incubated for another hour on ice with rabbit IgG (10 |ig/ml) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) to improve the specificity, then washed and incubated for 1 h with an anti-mouse phycoerythrin-conjugated polyclonal antibody (Sigma). The cells were washed and fixed with paraformaldehyde on ice for 10 min. The flow cytometry measurements were performed with FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA).<br>
Binding of Env-specific antibodies to HIV-1-infected cells. The T-cell line H9 (a gift from Q.Sattentau and supplied by the MRC AIDS Reagent Project) was grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. H9 cells were infected with the HIV-1 TCLA X4 MN isolate (obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program from R. Gallo) for 10 days to achieve high level of Env expression as detected by<br><br>
gpl20-specific mAbs and flow cytometry (see above). Then the antibodies were added at various concentrations, the cells were washed twice, and the bound human antibodies detected using anti-human IgG by flow cytometry as described above.<br>
B) RESULTS.<br>
Selection of a phage (X5) with high affinity to gpl20-CD4-CCR5 complexes.<br>
For panning we used complexes containing about 0.01 mg CD4 and 0.02 mg JRFL gpl20. The amount of CCR5 was not determined precisely but was about 0.01 mg as found by comparison of CCR5 Western blots of known amounts of detergent-solubilized CCR5. After 5 rounds of panning one phage was selected. This phage, denoted X5, was amplified. X5 exhibited binding activity to protein G cross-linked to Sepharose beads with an affinity (equilibrium dissociation constant) of 15 nM. Phage-displayed X5 had 15-fold lower effective affinity (1.4 nM) for protein G beads than for the gpl20-CD4-CCR5 complex (0.09 nm). The X5 Fab was purified by using protein G columns.<br>
Binding of X5 to a CD4-inducible epitope on gpl20 that is enhanced by dsCCRS. To find whether the Fab of the selected phage was able to bind gpl20 and its     i complexes with CD4 and CCR5 we used an ELISA-type of assay. X5 bound gpl20 from several isolates and its binding was increased 5-10-fold after binding of sCD4 (D1D2) to gpl20 (Figs. 1 and 2). The affinity of binding (equilibrium dissociation constants) to gp 12089.6 and sCD4-gp 12089.6 complexes was 9.4 nM and 1 nM (Fig. 2), and for JRFL - 10 and 2 nM, respectively (Fig. 1). Binding of dsCCR5 further enhanced the X5 epitope exposure by 30-60% (Fig. 1). Similar affinities were observed for binding to oligomeric, fusion-active gpl20-gp4lMN expressed at the surface of chronically infected H9 cells (Fig. 3). For this experimental system the X5 affinity in presence of sCD4 was comparable to that of CD4bs-specific mAb lgGlbl2 in the absence of sCD4 and several fold higher than the affinity of 17b which was previously reported to exhibit an increased affinity to the gpl20-CD4 complex (Thali et al. J. Virol. 67:3978-3988, 1993). The affinity of X5 for the gpl20jRFL-sCD4-CCR5 complex used for the X5 selection was 1 nM and the effective affinity of phage-displayed X5 for the gpl20jRFL-sCD4-CCR5 complex was 0.09 nM. Thus X5 exhibit the highest affinity to the gpl20-sCD4 complex among known antibodies to<br><br>
CD4-inducible epitopes. The affinity was not significantly dependent on the tropism of the Envs.<br>
Recombinant gpl20 and gpl40 from several primary isolates (a gift from C. Broder) behaved similarly. In all (92UG037.8 (Clade A, R5); 92HT593.1 (Clade B, R5 X4); 93ZR001.3 (Clade D, R5 X4) and 89.6) cases binding to gpl20 was higher than binding to gpl40 suggesting effects of gp41 or/and oligomerization. Therefore, the X5 epitope is a conserved conformational epitope that is induced by CD4 and enhanced by CCR5. This is the first example of an epitope for which exposure is enhanced by CCR5. These results suggest the existence of a very early intermediate in the HIV-1 entry process that is induced by receptor molecules.<br>
Inhibition of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated cell fusion and entry. To find whether X5 inhibits HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion we used several assays. In a sCD4-induced fusion assay X5 inhibited almost completely sCD4-mediated fusion mediated by the dual tropic primary isolate Env 89.6 at very low (100 ng/ml) concentrations (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained for several X4, R5 and X4R4 Envs (Table 1). Inhibition of fusion mediated by X4 Envs was somewhat less efficient compared to R5 Env-mediated fusion. Fusion mediated by cell-associated CD4 required on average 10-fold higher concentrations of X5. This may be related to the fact that cell-cell fusion is difficult to inhibit especially when the surface concentrations of CD4 and CCR5 (CXCR4) are high. X5 was able to neutralize several representative R5 (JRFL and Bal), X4 (NL4-3) and X4R5 (89.6) isolates of HIV-1 at concentrations in the range of 1 to 10 |J.g/ml (Fig. 5). These results indicate that X5 is a novel broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibody which can be used as an efficient inhibitor of HIV-1 infections.<br>
Table 1; Inhibition of sCD4-induced R5, X4, and R5-X4 Envs-mediated fusion byXS. The data are represented as % of control without X5; "-" denotes no fusion in the control. 293T cells were transfected by plasmids encoding various Envs. They were pre-incubated with sCD4 (1 ug/ml) and X5 (125 ng/ml) for 30 min at 37°C and incubated with the target cells (SupTl cells expressing CXCR4 and NIH 3T3 CD4.CCR5 cells) for 2 h at 37°C. Fusion was measured by the reporter gene fusion assay.<br>

Characterization of the X5 epitope. To characterize the X5 binding site on gpl20, we used several human monoclonal antibodies (gift of J. Robinson) against CD4-inducible epitopes. Two of these antibodies did not compete with X5 in the ELISA assay. Very low competition was observed with 17b at high concentrations (Figs. 6A and 6B), suggesting slight epitope overlap or steric interference. Although we were not able to localize precisely the X5 epitope it appears that it is close to the gp41 association site with gpl20, as indicated by the poorer binding of all gpl40 Envs compared to gpl20s. Studies of X5 competition with more antibodies with known epitopes and the X5 crystal structure in combination with the known gpl20 core structure will facilitate determination of the precise epitope recognized by X5. The amino acid sequences of the X5 light and heavy chains are shown in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively.<br>
Example II: Generation of X5 antibody sequence variants with increased affinity for Env-CD4-co-receptor complexes.<br>
The amino acid sequence of any antibody or antibody fragment of the invention may be varied in order to generate variant antibodies with equivalent or improved affinity for Env-CD4-co-receptor complexes. Such variant antibodies can be created and tested for their relative affinity using well-known methods and/or methods described herein. Such techniques are described, e.g., in Daugherty et al. ("Quantitative analysis of the effect of the mutation frequency on the affinity maturation of single chain Fv antibodies." Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97(5):2029-34, 2000); Cherry et al. ("Directed evolution of a fungal peroxidase." Nat. Biotechnol. 17(4): 379-84, 1999); and Vartanian et al. ("Hypermutagenic PCR involving all four transitions and a sizeable proportion of transversions." Nucleic Acids /?e.y.24(14):2627-31, 1996).<br>
Random mutagenesis of the X5 antibody gene was used to identify X5 sequence variants with improved affinity for Env-CD4-CCR5 and Env-CD4 complexes. Two phage-X5 mutagenesis libraries, one expressing antibody X5 sequence variants as Fab fragments<br><br>
and the other expressing antibody X5 as scFv (single chain antibody) fragments, were constructed and panned sequentially against both complexes using methods similar to those described in Example I above. One Fab clone was selected from the X5-Fab mutagenesis library. The new X5-Fab clone, designated FabS, showed five-fold increased affinity for Env-CD4-CCR5 complex, compared to the original X5-Fab. The mutations were located in the joint region between the heavy chain variable region and the first constant domain (CHI), in which the alanine in the original X5 sequence was changed to proline and the serine in the original sequence was changed to glycine (SEQ ID NO: 11; FabS heavy chain sequence), as shown in Fig. 4. The nucleotide sequence encoding the light and heavy chains of FabS is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 12.<br>
Example III: Generation of antibody fusion polypeptides based on the X5 antibody sequence.<br>
Fusion proteins comprising antibody fragments and other functional domains which increase the efficacy of the antibody in treating, inhibiting, or preventing HIV infection are contemplated by the present invention. Such antibodies fusion proteins can be made using standard techniques that are well known in the art, and used in the methods of the invention for the treatment of and prophylaxis against infection by HIV. Below are several examples of fusion proteins based upon the X5 antibody fragment described in Example I above. Two basic types of fusion proteins are shown: those based upon single-chain antibody (ScFv) fragments, and those based upon Fab fragments. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that any antibody or antibody fragment of the invention can be used to generate these and other types of fusion proteins.<br>
The first example of such a fusion protein is a ScFyX5-CD4 fusion protein, i.e., a single-chain antibody (ScFv) fragment comprising a domain from the variable region of the X5 heavy chain (VH) and a domain from the variable region of the X5 light chain (VL), fused to fused to soluble CD4 (sCD4). The HV and LV domains are separated by a fifteen amino acid long flexible linker consisting of three repeats of the pentapeptide Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser (SEQ ID NO: 21), and the VL and sCD4 domains of the fusion protein are separated by a variable length flexible linker (e.g., containing 20, 30, or 40 amino acid residues) containing, e.g., four, six, or eight repeats of Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser. The components of this fusion protein, labeled a through e, are as follows. Although the<br><br>
example below shows the VH domain as being positioned amino-terminal to the VL domain (VH-Linker (L3)-VL-), one of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that the relative positions of the VH and VL domains can be swapped (e.g., VL-Linker (L3)-VH-) for all of the exemplary fusion protein constructs shown below.<br>

Below is a second example of a fusion polypeptide that, in addition to the above components, also contains a synthetic peptide, T20, which corresponds to a peptide sequence found in HIV-1 gp41, and is a strong inhibitor of HIV-1 viral fusion (see, e.g., Lawless et al. Biochemistry 35:13697-13708, 1996).<br>

Construct: VH-Linker (L3)-VL-Linker(variable length)-sCD4-L 1-T20    {a-b-c-d-e-f-g)<br>

Below is an example of a fusion polypeptide containing an X5 Fab fragment, i.e., the X5 light chain fragment (VLCL) containing the variable region and the constant region, which is disulfide-bonded (represented below by "s-s") to the heavy chain fragment containing the variable region and the CHI portion of the constant region (VHCHl). One of skill in the art will recognize that X5 Fabs can contain heavy and light chains containing PelB, OmpA, or other signal sequences that direct protein secretion, e.g., as set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 3 and 2, respectively, or can contain heavy and light chains that lack such signal sequences, e.g., as set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 14 and 15, respectively.<br><br>
The X5 Fab fusion protein shown below contains a soluble CD4 domain fused to the carboxy terminus of the X5 heavy chain. Constructs containing the sCD4 domain fused to the X5 light chain instead of the heavy chain may also be used.<br>

The fourth construct is the same as the X5 Fab construct above, except it also contains a T20 domain. The T20 domain, like the sCD4 domain, may also be fused to either the heavy chain or the light chain. The construct below shows the T20 domain directly connected to the sCD4 domain by a flexible linker; however, constructs with the sCD4 domain on one chain and the T20 domain on the other chain (connected to the remainder of the chain by a flexible linker) are also included in the present invention.<br>
