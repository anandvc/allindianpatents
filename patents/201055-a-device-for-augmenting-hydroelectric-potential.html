				<td>THE_OBJECTIVE<br>
The  twin objectives  of  the  present  invention are:<br>
(a)	To provide  for a device which can increase  the electrical energy output at  all hydroelectric power projects,   including tidal power projects.<br>
(b)	To provide for a device which can decrease the consumption of electrical energy while  lifting liquids or solids from a lower level to a higher level.<br>
THE_   INVENTED     DEVICE<br>
See  fig.  1  and fig.   2.     The  invented device consists  of an empty chamber made  of  light material having two portions: the upper 1   and the  lower  2.     The upper portion  l  is open mouthed.     The  bottoms of  both portions have  closeable openings 3  and 4  respectively.     Inside the upper portion 1,   at about its middle,   is hung a trough-like  open mouthed container 5 whose  height is  the  same   as  that of  the  remaining portion below it   (container 5).     Likewise,   inside   c3nd  near the  top of the   lower portion 2 of the  empty chamber,   there  is hung another trough-like,   open mouthed container 6 whose height is the  same as  that of  the   remaining portion below it   (container 6).     Both containers  have  closeable  openings  7  and 8  at  their bottom. Just above  the mouth of  the  container 5,   and  inside  the  open mouthed upper portion  1 of   the  empty chamber hangs  a solid, heavy block  9 with the  help of  a holder 10.     Blokes 9 is  slightly smaller in capacity,   i.e.,   in dimensions  than the upper portion 1,<br><br>
so that  can slip  into it without touching the  walls. The  upper end of block  9  is  rigidly fixed to one  end of  the holder 10,   whose  other end  11 can be  rigidly fixed either into the  ground  or any firm structure.     Two thirds  of  the empty chamber   which  comprises half  of  the  upper portion 1 and  all  of  the   lower portion 2  along with containers  5  and  6, is placed  in an outer enclosure  12.     The entire empty chamber can slide  up  and down inside  the  outer enclosure   12 without its walls.<br>
INSTALLATION<br>
A.	At micro,  mini,   low head hydel projects;<br>
See  fig.2  and fig.  3.     Pig.  2  is  the  side  view of  the project  and Fig.   3  is the  front view of  the same project.<br>
The  invented device  is  installed just behind the  low dam 13.     At least two units of the  device are  to be  installed and operated in tandem.    Water released from the   lower portion 2 of the device  flows  to the   generator 14 through the pipe  15.     The water released from the  collector 16 of  the device flows to the generator 14 through the pipe  17.    The  device  can also be  inst¬alled  and operated in front of  the dam also.<br>
With the help of  this device even small  streams,  which are now considered too low for turbine  generators,   will become viable for  generating electricity.<br>
B.	At tidal power projects:     See  fig.   4A and Fig.  4B.<br>
The  device  can be   installed  adjacent to the  barrage   18 on<br><br>
either side  of  it.     It is  preferrable  install the  device on the  basin side of  the  barrage  for obvious  reasons.<br>
The  pipes  19,   20,   21,   22  carry water to the device  as  the flood  tide  arrives.     As  the  invented device increases  the head on the turbine  23,   the tidal power project can start generating electricity much earlier than at present,   that is,soon after the  commencement of the flood tide  and  go on generating elect¬ricity for a  longer period of  time than at present,   i.e.,   during the ebb tide.<br>
Pumped storage tidal power projects will  benefit enormously from this  invention.<br>
C.     At  large Hydel power projects:     See  Fig,   5<br>
The  device  is  installed inside  a stand  24  erected  in front of  the  dam 25.     The  stand  24 has  several  stoppers  26,   27 etc., at regular intervals to facilitate the  operation of  the device. As the water  level behind the  dam 25  goes  on decreasing or in¬creasing,   the device  inside  the  stand 24  is  fixed at any one of the  appropriate  stopper level inside  the  stand  24.     Pipe   28 carries water from lower portion 2  of  the  device  to the power house  29.     Pipes  30,   31  etc./   carry water to the  device  from the  reservoir behind the dam 25.     Pipe  32 carries water from the  collector 16 to the  power house   29.<br>

0__P E_R_A_T l_0 N<br>
The invented device together wxth the outer enclosure 12 is installed behind the dam 13 in such a way that the maximum level of water behind the dam 13 is just above the rim of the container 5 situated inside the upper portion 1 of the device. See fig. 6.<br>
Water from the reservoir is allowed to flow into the con¬tainer 5.  When the container 5 is completely filled with water, water flow from the reservoir is stopped.  The stoppers 33 and 34, holding the container 5 from below, are withdrawn into the outer enclosure 12.  The container 5 descends to the bottom of the upper portion 1.  As it descends/ it lifts up the water scoop 35 well over the water surface of the reservoir. The chain 36 connects the water scoop 35 with the container 5.<br><br>
See fig. 7.<br>
Now the water from the reservoir is allowed to flow into the upper portion 1. Water level 37 inside the upper portion 1 will be at par with the reservoir water level.<br>
Water from the reservoir is now allowed to flow into the outer enclosure 12.  The stoppers 38 and 39 holding the entire chamber, comprising of upper portion 1 and lower portion 2, rises.  When it has risen to its maximum, water flow from the reservoir is stopped and the stoppers 4 0 and 41 are pushed out of enclosure 12 so that they support the chamber from below. See fig. 8.<br>
Now, it should be noted carefully that the solid block 9 is completelysubmerged in water inside the upper portion 1 and the height of water above the block 9 is almost equal to the height of the block 9. That is, block 9 occupies lower half of the upper portion 1 while upper half of the upper portion 1 is occupied by water.  Container 5 inside the upper portion 1 now encloses block 9.  See fig. 8.<br>
Water from the reservoir is now allowed to flow into the container 6 whose rim is now just below the water level of the reservoir. When the container 6 is completely filled with water the water flow from the reservoir is stopped and the stoppers 42 and 43,holding the container 6 from below, are withdrawn. The container 6 descends to the bottom of the lower portion."2. As it descends it lifts up water scoop 35 further up.  See fig. 9.<br><br>
Water from the   lower part of   the enclosure  12  is  allowed to flow to the  generator through the  pipe 44.     Closeable  ope¬ning 8 of  the container 6  is opened  and the closeable  opening 4   at the  bottom of  the   lower portion 2  is  opened to allow water flow onto the  lower portion of  the outer enclosure  12. See fig.  10.    Water from collector 16 is  also allowed to flow to the   generator 14  through the pipe  17.     See  fig.   3  also.<br>
See  fig.  8.     The  water from the  upper portion 1  is  allowed to flow into the   trough-like  container 44  inside  the  water co¬llector 16 whose  rim is below  the  top of  the upper portion 1  in such  a way that about  one  third of the water in upper portion 1 flows  into the  container 44.     When the  container is  completely filled with water,   water flow from upper portion 1  is  stopped. Container 44   is  now  allowed  to descend onto the  bottom of  the water collector 16 by withdrawing stoppers 45  and  46.     See  fig. 9.     Asit descends,   it   lifts up water scoop 35  still higher. Water from the  scoop 35  is  allowed to flow  into water collector<br>
16.	The entire water  in the  collector 16  is  allowed  to flow into upper portion 1  at a  level which  is  above  block 9.     From there  it  is   allowed to flow  into  the   generator 14  through pipe<br>
17.	See  figures  8,   9  and  10.<br>
The entire water in the   lower portion of  the  outer enclosure 12  is  allowed to flow  into generator 14.     Containers       5,   6  and 44  are  lifted to their original position by the  slightly heavier water scoop 35  as  it descends to reservoir.     This  completes one cycle of  operations.     The  next cycle of operations  can begin when the  chamber  inside the   outer enclosure   12  is  allowed to<br><br>
descend  to the bottom of  the  enclosure  12  and  is held  by stoppers  38  and  39.     See  fig.   11.<br>
E NE RG Y	SAVING	APPLIC AT IONS<br>
A.	At  irrigation canals  and  rivers:<br>
The device can be used for  lifting water from a lower level to a higher level with energy input  next  to nothing.     If  the water is  required to be   lifted to a great height more than one set of  the device,   located one  above  the  other,   should  be employed.<br>
B.	At water supply systems  in towns and  cities;  See  fig.12<br>
When the  invented device  is  installed agjacent to a water tank 47 which supplies water to the town or city,   water can be lifted upto a greater height than the water tank 47 with energy input which is  next to nothing.     The water thus   lifted can be supplied to  higher buildings  48.     This means  that water supply authorities  can save electrical energy by building lower water tanks•<br>
Two separate systems of pipes 49 and 50 may be used: one for supplying water to the higher buildings another for lower buildings  51.<br>
Alternatively,   concentric pipes could be used.     That is, smaller pipes,   meant for supplying water to higher buildings, may be   incorporated  inside  the  existing system of pipes.<br>
IMPORTA     NT 1.     When more  than one unit  of  the  device  are employed,   their<br><br>
Operation should so syncronise that a constant head is maintained all the time.<br>
2.	More and more uses for the device may be thought of in future.<br>
3.	It is possible to further increase the efficiency of the device.<br>
4.	Engineering genius should go hand in hand with this challenging and useful invention.<br><br><br><br>
(a)      an empty chamber divided into two portions ; the upper one at the top and portion having closeable openings at the top and also at the bottom, and a lower portion having closeable openings at the top and also at the bottom,<br>
(b)       a trough - like container hung inside each of the two portions of the<br>
chamber having closeable openings at their bottom and connected to a lifting mechanism,<br>
( c)       an outer enclosure to the chamber, which has openings for water flow,	*<br>
(d ) a stationary solid heavy block kept suspended inside the upper portion of the chamber in such a way that the upper portion can move up and down around it,<br>
(e)       a water collector located adjacent to the upper portion and below the top of the upper portion of the chamber with closeable openings for receving and letting out water; which has a trough - like containers inside the upper and the lower portions of the chamber.<br><br></td>
