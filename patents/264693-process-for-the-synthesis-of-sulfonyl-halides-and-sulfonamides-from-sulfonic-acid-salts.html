				<td>PROCESS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF SULFONYL<br>
HALIDES AND SULFONAMIDES FROM SULFONIC ACID SALTS<br>
This application claims benefit of priority to US provisional patent application<br>
serial no. 60/701,158 filed on July 21,2005, which is hereby incorporated in its<br>
entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to processes for the preparation of sulfonyl<br>
halides and sulfonamides useful as intermediates in the preparation of, for example,<br>
pharmaceuticals and for the preparation of sulfonamides useful as pharmaceuticals.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Sulfonyl chlorides are widely used in the chemical industry such as for the<br>
preparation of dyes, lithographic resists, and pharmaceuticals. They can be further<br>
transformed into other functional groups such as aromatic sulfones (by Friedel-Crafts<br>
sulfonyiation of aromatic substrates) or sulfonamides (by reaction with amines) (see,<br>
e.g., Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology). Sulfonamides are integral<br>
functional groups of a wide variety of therapeutic small molecule drugs such as<br>
antibacterial agents, diuretics, and cPLA2 inhibitors.<br>
A typical preparation of sulfonyl chlorides involves reaction of the sodium salt<br>
of a sulfonic acid with phosphorus pentachloride, sometimes in combination with<br>
phosphorus oxychloride or thionyl chloride, frequently with heating of the reaction<br>
mixture (see, e.g., March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4lh ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>
1992, p.499). These relatively harsh reaction conditions are unsuitable for the<br>
preparation of sterically hindered sulfonyl chlorides, such as arylalkylsulfonyl<br>
chlorides and the like, which can result in low yields due to the elimination of sulfur<br>
dioxide (Nakayama et a!., Tet Lett, 1984. 25, 4553-4556). A milder, infrequently<br>
used method for the synthesis of sulfonyl chlorides is the reaction of<br>
tetrabutyiammonium salts of sulfonic acids with triphenylphosphine/sulfuryl chloride<br>
(Widlanski et a!., Tet. Lett, 1992, 33, 2657-2660), a method that suffers from the<br>
disadvantage of poor atom efficiency.<br><br>
Numerous sterically hindered sulfonyl halides such as (2-<br>
trifluoromethylphenyl)-methanesu!fonyl chloride and other aryl- and heteroaryl-<br>
alkylsulfonyl halides are specifically useful in the preparation of cPLA2 inhibitors for<br>
the treatment of asthma or arthritic and rheumatic disorders as described in, for<br>
example, WO 2003/048122. As discussed above, these intermediates can be<br>
difficult to prepare due to loss of sulfur dioxide at higher temperatures and formation<br>
of significant amounts of impurities. Thus, new and improved methods for making<br>
these compounds, and the corresponding sulfonamides, are needed. The.methods<br>
provided herein help meet these and other needs.<br>

The compounds having the formula II: [Ar-(R)z-S03"1]qM where Ar, R, and q<br>
are as defined above and z is 1 may be prepared as described in WO 2005/082843,<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
A general outline of some embodiments of the processes of the present<br>
invention is provided in Scheme I, where constituent members of the depicted<br>
compounds of Formulas I, II and III are defined hereinabove.<br>
8<br><br><br>
As shown in Step 1 of Scheme I, sulfonic acid salts of Formula II can be<br>
converted to sulfonyl halides of Formula III by reaction with a halogen substitution<br>
reagent in the presence of a catalytic amount of water and in the presence of a co-<br>
catalyst such as N,N-dimethylformamide.<br>
Halogen substitution reagents, as used herein, are reagents that can convert<br>
a non-halogen substituent of the compound of Formula II (such as, for example, H,<br>
OH or OM) to a halogen substituent. Halogen substitution reagents of the present<br>
invention can, for example, convert a sulfonic acid salt moiety or sulfonic acid moiety<br>
to a sulfonyl halide moiety. Numerous reagents capable of carrying out the<br>
conversion of sulfonyl acid to sulfonyl halide are known in the art. Some preferred<br>
halogen substitution reagents include SOCI2, POCI3, CCL,/triphenylphosphine, oxalyl<br>
chloride and oxalyl bromide. In some more preferred embodiments, the halogen<br>
substitution reagent is oxalyl chloride. Generally, the halogen substitution reagent is<br>
used in a molar excess, relative to the compound of Formula II. Preferably, the<br>
halogen substitution reagent is employed in an amount of about 1.2 equivalents or<br>
greater, relative to the amount of compound of Formula II. For example, oxalyl<br>
chloride can be used as the halogen substitution reagent in molar excess, for<br>
example from about 1.2 to about 4 equivalents; about 2 to about 3 equivalents or<br>
about 2.1 to about 2.6 equivalents with respect to the amount of sulfonic acid salt<br>
reagent (compound of Formula II). One skilled in the art will recognize that the<br>
9<br><br>
amount of halogen substitution reagent used will depend, inter alia, on the amount of<br>
solvent and the nature and reactivity of the starting materials and solvents.<br>
As shown in step 1 of Scheme 1, the reaction of the compound of Formula II<br>
and the halogen substitution reagent is carried out in the presence of a catalytic<br>
amount of water. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is<br>
believed that the catalytic amount of water facilitates the formation of the sulfonyl<br>
chloride from the sodium salt by first forming the corresponding protonated sulfonic<br>
acid, which is easier to convert to the sulfonyl chloride and can be done under milder<br>
conditions, such as by using oxalyl chloride at room temperature or below. The<br>
molar ratio of the catalytic amount of water to the compound of Formula II is<br>
generally less than about 0.5:1, or from about 0.2:1 to about 0.4:1, or about 0.3:1.<br>
Generally, the reaction of the compound of Formula II with the halogen<br>
substitution reagent is carried out in the presence of a co-catalyst. While not wishing<br>
to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the co-catalyst facilitates the<br>
formation of the sulfonyl chloride. Suitable co-catalysts include N, N-<br>
dialkylformamides, for example N,N-dimethylformamide, as well as other reagents<br>
useful as co-catalysts for sulfonic acid halogenation reactions, for example<br>
triphenyiphosphine oxide. The co-catalyst is generally provided in an amount<br>
sufficient to accelerate the reaction rate. In some embodiments, the co-catalyst is<br>
present in less than about one equivalent relative to the amount of sulfonic acid salt<br>
reagent. In some preferred embodiments, the co-catalyst is present in an amount of<br>
about 0.01 to about 0.5 equivalents, or about 0.1 to about 0.2 equivalents, relative to<br>
the amount of sulfonic acid salt reagent. One skilled in the art will recognize that the<br>
amount of the co-catalyst used will depend, inter alia, on the amount of solvent and<br>
the nature and reactivity of the starting materials and solvents.<br>
In some embodiments, the reacting of the compound of Formula II with the<br>
halogen substitution reagent is carried out in a solvent system that includes at least<br>
one organic solvent. In some embodiments, the solvent system can inchjde two or<br>
more solvents. Solvents suitable for inclusion in the solvent system include aprotic<br>
organic solvents, polar aprotic organic solvents, nonpolar aprotic organic solvents,<br>
water-miscible aprotic organic solvents, and water-immiscible aprotic organic<br>
solvents. In some embodiments, the solvent system includes one or more of<br>
tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, dioxane, acetone, toluene,<br>
10<br><br>
methylene chloride, 1,2-di-chloroethane, methyl t-butyl ether and ethyl ether. In<br>
some preferred embodiments, the solvent system includes or consists of<br>
tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The halogen substitution reaction can be carried out at any suitable<br>
temperature. Generally, the reaction is performed at a temperature below room<br>
temperature. For example, in some embodiments, the reaction can be carried out at<br>
or below about 5°C, for example at a temperature of from about 0 °C to about 5 °C.<br>
In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, and as shown in<br>
Step 2 of Scheme I, the sulfonyl halides of Formula III can react with an amine<br>
reagent, optionally in the presence of a base, for a time and under conditions<br>
sufficient to form a compound of Formula I:<br>
Ar-(R)z-S02-NR4R5<br>
where the constituent variables are as defined herein.<br>
Advantageously, in accordance with some embodiments of the invention, the<br>
sulfonyl halide of Formula 111 need not be isolated prior to reaction with the amine<br>
reagent.<br>
Generally, where excess halogen substitution reagent is employed for the<br>
reaction with the compound of Formula II, it is advantageous that the excess halogen<br>
substitution reagent remaining after the reaction be either removed or destroyed,<br>
prior to reaction of the sulfonyl halide with the amine reagent, to prevent the<br>
formation of impurities. In some embodiments, the excess halogen substitution<br>
reagent can be destroyed by adding a chemical reagent, for example a small amount<br>
of water. Preferably, a minimum amount of water should be used to destroy the<br>
excess halogen substitution reagent, such as oxaly! chloride, when the sulfonyl<br>
halides of Formula III, such as (2-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-methanesulfonyl chloride,<br>
are sensitive to hydrolysis. Alternatively, the excess halogen substitution reagent<br>
can be removed, for example by one or more of distillation; distillation under reduced<br>
pressure; distillation further facilitated by adding a co-solvent; or distillation under<br>
reduced pressure further facilitated by adding a co-solvent. When the excess<br>
halogen substitution reagent is removed by distillation, it is not necessary that the<br>
distillation be continued to dryness.<br>
As used herein, the term "amine reagent" is intended to mean a reagent that<br>
either is an amine capable of participating in the reaction with the compound of<br>
11<br><br>
Formula III to produce a sulfonamide of Formula I, or a reagent that provides such an<br>
amine. In some embodiments, the amine reagent has the Formula HNR4R5, where<br>
R4 and R5 are as defined supra. Thus, amine reagents include ammonia, primary<br>
and secondary amines, as well as reagents that are capable of liberating or<br>
producing an amine of the Formula HNR4R5, such as NH4OH. In some<br>
embodiments, the amine reagent can be in a pure form such as gaseous ammonia or<br>
dimethytamine. In some preferred embodiments, the amine reagent is gaseous<br>
ammonia, or NH4OH.<br>
In the amination step of Scheme 1, when excess amount of the amine<br>
reagent is used, an ammonium halide inorganic salt can be formed. Such<br>
ammonium halide inorganic salts can be conveniently removed from the reaction<br>
solution by standard techniques, for example by filtration.<br>
The amination of the compound of Formula III (as shown in Step 2 of Scheme<br>
1) can be carried out in a solvent system that can include one or more organic<br>
solvents; for example a single organic solvent, or a mixture of two or more organic<br>
solvents. Suitable solvents for inclusion in the solvent system include one or more of<br>
tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, dioxane, acetone, toluene,<br>
methylene chloride, 1,2-di-chloroethane, methyl t-butyl ether and ethyl ether.<br>
In some embodiments, the solvent system for the amination includes, in<br>
addition to any organic solvents, a small amount of water. It is believed that the<br>
presence of a small amount of water in the solvent system facilitates the dissolving<br>
the amine reagent. It is advantageous to keep the amount of water in the solvent<br>
system at a minimum if the sulfonyl halides of Formula III, such as (2-trifluoromethyl-<br>
phenyl)-methanesulfonyl chloride, are sensitive to hydrolysis. For example, in some<br>
embodiments, the amount of water is present in less than about one equivalent<br>
relative to the amount of sulfonyl halide reagent. One preferred solvent system<br>
includes a small amount of water and tetrahydrofuran.<br>
In some embodiments, the reaction of the compound of Formula III and the<br>
amine reagent is performed in the presence of a base. Suitable bases include<br>
ammonia, lower (i.e., C) trialkyl amines, pyridine, or an inorganic base such as<br>
metallic carbonates or bicarbonates. In many instances, it is preferred that the amine<br>
reagent also function as the base, particularly where the amine reagent is ammonia,<br>
or relatively small in size, for example a lower (i.e., Ci„6) mono- or di-alkyl amine.<br>
12<br><br>
The reaction of the compound of Formula III with the amine reagent can be<br>
carried out at any suitable temperature. Generally, the reaction is performed at a<br>
temperature below room temperature. For example, in some embodiments, the<br>
reaction can be carried out at a temperature of less than about -10 °C. In some<br>
preferred embodiments, the reaction can be carried out at a temperature of from<br>
about -20 °C to about -10 °C.<br>

15<br><br>
present on the same compound, the two substituents can be different members of<br>
the same group.<br>

water (1 mL), DMF (2 mL), and (2-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-methanesulfonic acid,<br>
sodium salt (50 g, 0.190 mol). The mixture was stirred under a nitrogen blanket and<br>
cooled to 0-5 CC. Oxalyl chloride (63 g, 0.496 mo!) was added dropwise to the<br>
reaction mixture. The mixture was stirred at 0-5 °C for 16 hours. In-process analysis<br>
(HPLC) showed a 99% conversion to (2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)methanesulfonyI<br>
chloride.<br>

The reaction mixture was concentrated to 107 g, then diluted with THF (200 mL).<br>
The mixture was stirred and cooled to -10 to -20 °C. Water (3.0 mL) was added<br>
dropwise. Ammonia (gas, 13 g, 0.765 mol) was added via subsurface tubing to the<br>
reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was basic to pH paper. In-process testing<br>
(HPLC) showed complete conversion of the sulfonyl chloride to the sulfonamide with<br>
~5% of the sulfonic acid. The mixture was filtered to remove inorganic salts. Water<br>
(135 mL) was added to the filtrate. The filtrate was concentrated to 190 g. The<br>
mixture was stirred at 0-5 °C for 30 min. The solid product was collected by filtration<br>
and dried to constant weight to give 33.2 g (73%) of the title compound. 1HNMR(300<br>
