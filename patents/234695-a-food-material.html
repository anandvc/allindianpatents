				<td>The present invention relates to a reducer of increase blood glucose level, a reducer of body fat accumulation, a food material, a method for reducing blood glucose level and a method for reducing body fat accumulation.<br>
Background Art<br>
As a constituent for reducing increase blood glucose level, there have been known an extract from Gyrnnema Sylvestre leaves (JP Tokkai S64-85058, JP Tokkai H2-79955), an extract from Gyrnnema Inodrum (JP Tokkai H5-252897), and an extract from Gyrnnema Chingen (JP Tokkai H6-245735). They are considered to reduce increase blood glucose level because of an effect of reducing glucose absorption. Triterpene glycoside (JP Tokkai H6-128161) contained in Gyrnnema Inodrum is also reported to have the effect of reducing glucose absorption.<br>
Monoterpene glycoside is known to have an effect of reducing blood glucose level increase through a sucrase inhibition effect (JP Tokkai H6-100453). Eaxmples of such monoterpene glycoside include a betaine from a sugar beet (JP Tokkai H8-133970), a saponin mixture from Alaria elata (JP Tokkai H8-283169), and an α-glucosidase inhibitor (JP Tokkai H8-289783).<br>
activity is pointed out that, when ingested together with sucrose,<br>
it   allows    the    sucrose    to    reach   a    large   intestine    without<br>
decomposition.       In   other   words,   all   the   above   substances<br>
demonstrating the effect of reducing blood glucose level increase<br>
have various problems such as inconvenience at use and limited<br>
application.<br>
[0007] Therefore, a reducer of blood glucose level increase which<br>
is free from unpleasant taste such as bitter taste and which can be<br>
ingested as a safe food has been desired.    Further, a plant extract<br>
is not usually ingested as food, and L-arabinose is a food additive.<br>
Therefore, a method for reducing blood glucose level increase<br>
employing a safe food material  usually ingestible as food has<br>
been desired.<br>
[0008] An object of the present invention is to provide a reducer<br>
of blood   glucose   level   increase   which   can   solve   the   above<br>
problems in the prior art.<br>
[0009]  The present inventors  have  made a diligent study and<br>
found out that a combination of certain substance causing the<br>
blood  glucose   level   increase   and  palatinose   can  be  ingested,<br>
while   solving   the   problems,   to   reduce   blood   glucose   level<br>
increase   caused   by   the   substance,   and   have   completed   the<br>
invention.<br>
[0010] Namely, the invention provides a reducer of blood glucose<br>
level   increase   comprising  palatinose   as   an   active   ingredient,<br>
wherein the reducer is ingested before or after or simultaneously<br>
with consuming a carbohydrate having an a-l,6-glucosyl bond<br>
[0004] Additionally, there has been recently reported carbohydrate having an effect of reducing blood glucose level increase. Indigestible dextrin is known to show an effect of reducing blood glucose level increase after food intake for a person with easily rising blood glucose level (Kenko/Eiyosyokuhin Kenkyu, Vol.2, No.l, 52-56 (1999)), and to] have an influence on fat metabolism - (Kenko/Eiyosyokuhin Kenkyu, Vol.3, No.3, 47-58 (2000)). L-arabinose is also demonstrated to inhibit specifically the activity of small intestine<br>
sucrase which decomposes sucrose (Nihon Eiyo/Syokuryo Gakkai<br>
i<br>
Shi (The Journal of JSNFS), Vol.50, No.2, 133-137 (1997)). [0005] Although not carbohydrate, a hot water extract from Guava leaves, a plant extract, is known to inhibit the activities of carbohydrate degrading enzymes, such as maltase, sucrase and a-amylase. It is also known that its inhibition effect is particularly stronger for a-amylase than for the other two enzymes. Hence, it is demonstrated to reduce blood glucose level increase after food intake (Nippon NogeiKagaku Kaishi, Vol.72, No.8, 923-931 ' (1998)).<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
[0006] However, the Gymnema extract etc. taste so bitter as to block sweet taste, and hence can not be used without a particular treatment. The indigestible dextrin and L-arabinose, though carbohydrate, are difficult to be digestibly absorbed, and sometimes cause diarrhea when they are ingested in a large amount.     A substance  having   an   effect   of inhibiting  sucrase<br>
activity is pointed out that, when ingested together with sucrose,<br>
it   allows   the   sucrose   to   reach   a   large   intestine   without<br>
decomposition.      In   other   words,   all   the   above   substances<br>
demonstrating the effect of reducing blood glucose level increase<br>
have various problems such as inconvenience at use and limited<br>
application.<br>
[0007] Therefore, a reducer of blood glucose level increase which<br>
is free from unpleasant taste such as bitter taste and which can be<br>
ingested as a safe food has been desired.    Further, a plant extract<br>
is not usually ingested as food, and L-arabinose is a food additive.<br>
Therefore, a method for reducing blood glucose level increase<br>
employing a safe food material usually ingestible as food has<br>
been desired.<br>
[0008] An object of the present invention is to provide a reducer<br>
of blood   glucose   level   increase   which   can   solve   the   above<br>
problems in the prior art.<br>
[0009]  The present inventors have  made  a diligent study and<br>
found out that a combination of certain substance causing the<br>
blood  glucose  level   increase   and  palatinose  can  be  ingested,<br>
while   solving   the   problems,   to   reduce   blood   glucose   level<br>
increase   caused   by   the   substance,   and   have   completed   the<br>
invention.<br>
[0010] Namely, the invention provides a reducer of blood glucose<br>
level   increase   comprising   palatinose   as   an   active   ingredient,<br>
wherein the reducer is ingested before or after or simultaneously<br>
with consuming a carbohydrate having an α-l,6-glucosyl bond<br>
ratio of from 0% to less than 50% relative to the total bonds among constituent saccharides, and wherein the reducer reduces an increase in blood glucose level caused by consuming said carbohydrate(or a reducer of blood glucose level increase for reducing a blood glucose level increase caused by consuming a carbohydrate having an α-1,6-glucosyl bond ratio of from 0% to less than 50% relative to the total bonds among constituent saccharides characterized by comprising palatinose as an active ingredient and being ingested befoie or aftei or simultaneously with consuming the carbohydrate)<br>
[0011] As is reported in Hormone and Metabolic Reseaich, 21,<br>
338-340 (1989) etc , palatinose is a foodstuff having a low<br>
Glycemic Index and causes no sudden increase or decrease in<br>
blood glucose level after ingestion [Glycemic Index (GI) is an<br>
index which indicates relationship between food and blood<br>
glucose level, which is in the news recently, and uses white bread<br>
or glucose as a standard food (The American Journal of Clinical<br>
Nutrition,    43    (January),    167-172    (1986))]	It    has    been<br>
considered that palatinose is ingested simultaneously with another carbohydrate to express a change in blood glucose level which is a sum of the change caused by the palatinose and the carbohydrate Therefore, palatinose has been only intended to be used alone as a caibohydiate in a food tor reducing blood glucose level increase<br>
[0012] With respect to the coexistence ettect of palatinose and another carbohydiate, there is a report on the relation between<br>
palatinose and sucrose (Nihon Eryo/Syokuryo Gakkar Shi(Journal of Japanese Society of Nutrition and Food Science), Vol 36, No 3, 169-173 (1983)) According to the report, since sucrase (sucrose α-D-glucohydrolase) catalyzes to decompose sucrose into glucose and fructose and is specific for sucrose or maltose as the substrate, it does not catalyze to decompose palatinose or isomaltose having different bond of the same combinations of the constituent sugars to sucrose or maltose, respectively Therefore, it is reported that, when sucrose and palatinose coexist, they are catalyzed independently to decompose without mutual influence [0013] On the contraiy, isomaltase (oliogo-l,6-glucosidase), which is an enzyme catalyzing decomposition of palatinose inside a digestive tract, catalyzes to decompose a carbohydrate having an α-l,6-glucosyl bond such as isomaltose, panose and isomaltotriose Hence, it is reported that, when palatinose and these carbohydrates coexist, they competitively inhibit decomposition reaction catalyzed by the enzyme one another, resulting in their respective slow decomposition rates (Nihon Eiyo/Syokuryo Gakkai Shi(Journal of Japanese Society of Nutrition and Food Science), Vol 36, No 3, 169-173 (1983)) It has been concluded from the report that, through competitive inhibition by isomaltase, palatinose can reduce the blood glucose level increase caused by consuming a carbohydrate having an a-1,6-glucosyl bond ratio of 50% oi more relative to the total bonds among constituent saccharides However, palatinose is not supposed to be able to leduce the blood glucose level  increase<br><br>
caused by consuming a carbohydrate having no α-l,6-glucosyl bond including monosaccharide or a carbohydrate having an α-1,6-glucosyl bond ratio of less than 50% relative to the total bonds among constituent saccharides.<br>
[0014] Contrary to the recognition, however, the inventors have found out a novel phenomenon that, when palatispse is ingested before or after or simultaneously with consuming a carbohydrate having an α-1,6-glucosyl bond ratio of from 0% to less than 50% relative to the total bonds among constituent saccharides, it can reduce the blood glucose level increase caused by ingesting the carbohydrate.<br>
[0015] The present invention provides a reducer of blood glucose level increase comprising palatinose as an active ingredient, wherein the reducer is ingested before or after or simultaneously with consuming at least one foodstuff being selected from the group consisting of sucrose, wheat flour, starch, dextrin and high fructose corn syrup, and wherein the reducer reduces an increase in blood glucose level caused by consuming the foodstuff (or a reducer of blood glucose level increase for reducing a blood glucose level increase caused by consuming at least one foodstuff selected from the group consisting of sucrose, wheat flour, starch, dextrin and high fructose corn syrup, characterized by comprising palatinose as the active ingredient and being ingested before or after or simultaneously with consuming the foodstuff) [0016] Starch and dextrin are catalyzed by α-amylase, ß-amylase and α-glucosidase (maltase) to decompose to glucose, which is<br>
absorbed at small intestine Palatinose, though having a glucosyl group, is demonstrated to be hardly catalyzed by a-glucosidase<br>
[0017] High fructose corn syrup composed of glucose and fructose, a commercial product of sacchaiide (carbohydrate) composed of monosaccharides, is ingested to give a sudden increase and decrease curve in blood glucose level as is seen in sucrose It has been consideied that high fructose corn syrup, which is composed of the monosaccharides, is not competitive as to catalysis by the decomposition enzyme foi palatinose and is easily absorbed<br>
[0018]  It  has  been  generally  known  that  glucose  and  sucrose cause a sudden increase/decrease curve in blood glucose level White bread, as well as glucose, is used as a standard to measure a Glycemic  Index because starch  in the  food is digested at a considerably large rate to show a sudden increase/decrease curve in blood glucose level close to that of sucrose 01 glucose (ILSI Europe Concise Monograph Series, [Nutrition and Health Aspects of Sugars, Evaluation of new findings], pp8-12 (1998))      Dextrin, a partial decomposition product of starch, is easily supposed to draw   a   blood   glucose   level   curve   similar   to   that   of  starch Therefore, sucrose, glucose, staich and dextnn aie representative of carbohydrates which aie apt to raise suddenh  blood glucose level after ingestion and aie used in a wide range of piocessed foods      High  fructose coin  syrup,  a  liquid  sugar composed ot glucose  and   fructose  which  are  the  constituent  sacchaiides  of<br>
sucrose, is ingested to show a blood glucose level increase curve similar to that of sucrose<br>
[0019] It has been generally considered that, when palatinose giving a mild increase/decrease in blood glucose level and a carbohydrate (saccharide) giving a sudden increase/decrease in blood glucose level such as sucrose, glucose, dextun or starch are simultaneously ingested, sucrose, glucose, dextrin or starch, which is an easily digested carbohydrate, causes sudden increase in glucose level as is the case where it is ingested alone, and that slow changes of glucose level caused by palatinose simultaneously ingested is not reflected The consideration is based on the understanding that palatinose don't cause competitive inhibition because the decomposing enzymes for the above described carbohydrates, which are easily digestible, are significantly different from palatinose decomposing enzyme (palatinose is catalyzed to decompose at a rate about one fifth of that of sucrose), and that palatinose has no influence on the absorption of a monosaccharide such as glucose [0020] Thus, the invention, that palatinose is ingested before or after or simultaneously with consuming at least one foodstuff being selected from the group consisting of sucrose, wheat flour, starch, dextrin and high fructose corn syrup to reduce an increase in blood glucose level caused b&gt; consuming the foodstuff, provides a completely novel knowledge<br>
[0021] The invention also piovides a reducer  of blood glucose level   inciease   comprising   palatinose   as   an   active   ingredient,<br>
wherein the reducer is ingested before or after or simultaneously with consuming food, and wherein the reducer reduces an increase in blood glucose level caused by consuming the food (or a reducer of blood glucose level increase for reducing an increase in blood glucose level caused by consuming food characterized by comprising palatinose as the active ingredient and being ingested before or after or simultaneously with consuming the food)<br>
[0022] The amount of carbohydrate upon ingesting an ordinary<br>
food    is    considered    to    be    50-150g    per    food	And    the<br>
carbohydrate contained in one feed causes mainly blood glucose level increase after eating An ordinary food uses food material which contain a lot of carbohydrate such as potatoes, rice products (rice diet, noodles such as Vietnamese pho noodle or rice vermicelli, and rice cake) and wheat products (wheat flour, wheat noodle, bread, baked cake, pizza crust and Japanese pancake) The carbohydrate contained in them is mainly starch It has been considered that, for ingested palatinose, it is more difficult to reduce an increase in blood glucose level through consuming a caibohydrate in food, which exists with other ingiedients in being kneaded with or surrounded by the other ingredients, than to reduce an increase in blood glucose level through consuming a caibohydiate such as monosaccharide and disacchande, which ate consumed as an aqueous solution lherefore, the tact that palatinose is ingested to reduce blood glucose level  increase after  eating provides a complete!)   novel<br>
knowledge.<br>
[0023] Further, the invention provides a reducer of body fat accumulation comprising palatinose as an active ingredient, wherein the reducer is ingested before or after or simultaneously with consuming a carbohydrate having an α-l,6-glucosyl bond ratio of from 0% to less than 50% relative to the total bonds among constituent saccharides, and wherein the reducer reduces body fat accumulation resulted from the increase in blood glucose level and insulin secretion caused by ingesting the carbohydrate (or a reducer of body fat accumulation for reducing body fat accumulation resulted from the increase in blood glucose level and insulin secretion amount caused by ingesting a carbohydrate having an α-l,6-glucosyl bond ratio of from 0% to less than 50% relative to the total bonds among constituent saccharides, characterized by comprising palatinose as the active ingredient and being ingested before or after or simultaneously with consuming the carbohydrate).<br>
[0024] Furthermore, the invention provides a reducer of body fat accumulation comprising palatinose as an active ingredient, wherein the reducer is ingested before or after or simultaneously with consuming at least one foodstuff being selected from the group consisting of sucrose, wheat flour, starch, dextrin and high fructose corn syrup, and wherein the reducer reduces body fat accumulation resulted from the increase in blood glucose level and insulin secretion caused by consuming the foodstuff (or a reducer    of   body    fat    accumulation    for    reducing    body    fat<br>
accumulation resulted from the increase in blood glucose level and insulin secretion amount caused by ingesting at least one foodstuff being selected from the group consisting of sucrose, wheat flour, starch, dextrin and high fructose corn syrup, characterized by comprising palatinose as the active ingredient and being ingested before or after or simultaneously with consuming the foodstuff)<br>
[0025] In addition, the invention provides a reducer of body fat accumulation comprising palatinose as an active ingredient, wherein said reducer is ingested before or after or simultaneously with consuming food, and wherein the reducer reduces body fat accumulation resulted from the increase in blood glucose level and insulin secretion caused by consuming the food (or a reducer of body fat accumulation for reducing body fat accumulation resulted from the increase in blood glucose level and insulin secretion amount caused by consuming food, characterized by comprising palatinose as the active ingredient and being ingested before or after or simultaneously with consuming the food) [0026] It is reported that, comparing a case where a combination of a high fat diet with sugar and only a basic diet are alternately ingested with another case where onl\ a high fat diet and a combination of a basic diet with sugar are alternately ingested under the condition of the same nutrition intake in 2 meals per day, body fat amount significantly increases when a high fat diet and sugar are ingested simultaneous!) (Kagaku to Kogyo, Vol 61, No 1, 17-24 (1987))      This is resulted from consequent reactions<br>
that   the   ingested   sugar   causes   blood   glucose   level   increase, secretion of insulin is induced, the insulin activates lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in a fat tissue to allow a neutral fat in blood from the diet to be taken rapidly into a fat cell, which is accumulated as body fat (New Food  Industry,  Vol 31,  No 10, 9-15  (1989)) Accordingly, in reverse, inhition of blood glucose level increase to reduce inducing secretion of insulin can inhibit activation of LPL, resulting in reducing body fat accumulation [0027]    Hence,    palatinose    is    ingested    before    or    after    or simultaneously with consuming carbohydrate to iesult in a mild increase/deciease    curve    of   blood    glucose    level,    to    inhibit activation of LPL and to make accumulating body fat difficult [0028]   Further,  the  invention  provides  a  method   for  reducing blood glucose level increase by allowing an individual to ingest the above reducer of blood glucose level increase, and a method for ieducing body fat accumulation by allowing an individual to ingest the above reducer of body fat accumulation [0029]   Furthermore,   the   invention   provides   food   materials   as shown in following (l)-(6)<br>

Palatinose in the invention, which is also called as isomaltulose, is a disacchande composed by allowing glucose to make an α-l,6-glucosyl bond to fructose<br>
[0034] Palatinose may be a hydrate Monohydiate thereof has a melting point of 123-124°C, a specific rotation [α]20D of+97 2, a Fehling solution reduction of 52% relative to glucose, and a solubility of 38 4g in l00g water at 20°C The aqueous solution tastes fine sweet and has about 40% in sweetness relative to sucrose<br>
[0035] Palatinose is naturally found in hone\ or sugarcane juice It  is  also  found   in  a  product  transferred   horn  sucrose  by   the<br>
action of an a-glucosyltransferase (isonialtulose synthase) from bacteria or yeasts.<br>
[0036] Palatinose is industrially manufactured by treating sucrose with an a-glucosyltransferase produced by a bacteria such as Protaminobacter rubrum and Serratia plymuthica [0037] In the invention, "a carbohydrate having an a-l,6-glucosyl bond ratio of from 0% to less than 50% relative to the total bonds among constituent saccharides" is classified into "a carbohydrate having no a-l,6-glucosyl bond" and "a carbohydrate having an a-1,6-glucosyl bond ratio of from above 0% to less than 50% relative to the total bonds among constituent saccharides." [0038] Examples of "a carbohydrate having no α-1,6-glucosyl bond" include carbohydrates such as maltose, sucrose, high fructose corn syrup and glucose. Examples of "a carbohydrate having an a-l,6-glucosyl bond ratio of from above 0% to less than 50% relative to the total bonds among constituent saccharides" include starch, dextrin and branched dextrin. Isomaltose, panose, isopanose and isomaltotriose do not correspond to the carbohydrate causing the increase in blood glucose level in the invention, because they have an α-1,6-glucosyl bond ratio of 50% or more relative to the total bonds among constituent saccharides.<br>
[0039] "A carbohydrate having an α-1,6-glucosyl bond ratio of from 0% to less than 50% relative to the total bonds among constituent saccharides" may be used alone or in combination of two or more      The carbohydrate includes not only a carbohydiate<br>
commercially available as a purified high-grade single component, but also a carbohydrate in a state contained in ceieals such as wheat flour and potatoes      Wheat flour contains carbohydiate in a  content  of about  75%      About  98%  of the  carbohydrate  is starch<br>
[0040] In the invention, "palatinose is ingested before or after or simultaneously with" means that palatinos-e and one or more other carbohydrates are ingested during a meal or a between-meal snack It does not always limitedly mean that they are mixed and ingested Therefore, it includes ingesting a food or drink containing palatinose and one oi more other caibohydrates which easily causes a blood glucose level increase For example, a case where a drink containing palatinose is ingested before or after or simultaneously with consuming a cake or a cookie containing sucrose and starch corresponds to the condition "palatinose is ingested before or after or simultaneously with" of the invention More particularly, "palatinose is ingested before or after or simultaneously with" means a time range within which palatinose and one or more other carbohydrates can be mixed in stomach by consuming food at meal or between-meals when the palatinose stays in the stomach, or by ingesting palatinose when tood at meal or between-meals stays in the stomach The time range is generally from 30 minutes before consuming food to 2 hours after consuming the tood, but vanes depending on an individual, body condition oi ingestion timing [0041]   "Palatinose   is   ingested'   includes   ingesting   palatinose<br>
alone and ingesting a food material containing palatinose , for example, a drink such as a refreshing drink, coffee and black tea, household dishes such as omelet and cooked dish, confectionery such as baked goods, pudding and bun with bean-jam filling, and breads including a sweet bun.<br>
[0042] In the invention, "sweetener" is a substance to make food and drink sweet. It means a sweetener prepared for the purpose of coffee or black tea, or means a sweetener for use in household or business. The sweetener may be formed in powder, granule, a cube or liquid. It can be packaged in a stick, a small bag, a box or a portion.<br>
[0043] "Premix material" means a foodstuff which is sold by previously mixing several materials containing palatinose and one or more other materials including a hot cake mix, a pound cake mix, a bread mix, a pancake mix, a steamed bread mix, a crepe mix, a cookie mix, a doughnut mix, a sponge cake mix, a jelly mix, a pudding mix, bean-jam with sugar and a dumpling powder.<br>
[0044] "Powder drink" means a cocoa mix, coffee, a powdery juice, a powdered black tea, a powdered lemonade and an instant soup mix. It means a drink product which can be dissolved in a liquid such as hot water, water and milk to serve as a drink. [0045] Among carbohydrates consumed before or after or simultaneous with palatinose, sucrose and high fructose corn syrup are sweetener. Therfore, the sweetness can be reduced by substituting   a   part   of the   sweetener   with   palatinose       Since<br>
consumers recently tend to like low sweet confectioneries and drinks, these products can be used as foods for such consumers. Alternatively, a highly sweet material such as high fructose corn syrup, fructose, aspartame, stevia sweetener or acesulfam K can be used together to adjust the product to a favorite sweetness. From the viewpoint of processsmg characteristics, palatinose in combination with sucrose prevent the food from coloring and prevent low soluble palatinose from crystallization, comparing with the case where palatinose is used alone.<br>
[0046] It has been proved by the Examples as described below that palatinose, when ingested before or after or simultaneously with consuming a carbohydrate having an α-1,6-glucosyl bond ratio of from 0% to less than 50% relative to the total bonds among constituent saccharides such as sucrose, dextrin, starch and high fructose corn syrup, reduces an increase in blood glucose level caused by consuming the carbohydrate. [0047] A group of ingesting 50g of sucrose, a group of ingesting 25g of sucrose and a group of ingesting 25g of glucose, which were used as Comparative examples, showed a sudden increase in blood glucose level 30 minutes after the ingesting. As for cases where 50g of sucrose and 25g of glucose were ingested, respectively, the areas of a region surrounded by the blood glucose level increase curve and the baseline (area under blood glucose level increase curve) were nearly identical and high values. And as for the case where 2 5g of sucrose was ingested, the   values   were   slightly   lower.      Groups   of  ingesting   25g   of<br>
sucrose 01 25g of glucose in combination with 25g of palatinose, which were measuied as Examples, gave no sudden increases in blood glucose level after consuming these carbohydrates and gave significantly lower values in area under their blood glucose level increase curves comparing with the Comparative groups [0048] The area under blood glucose level increase curve after consuming 50g of carbohydrate, which is a reference of Glycemic Index measurement, was measured for glucose and palatinose in combination of various ratios to obtain GI value thereof, which is expressed by a relative value taking the value measured after 50g of glucose is ingested as 100% As a result, a cuive showing decrease in the GI value according to inciease in ratio of palatinose was obtained<br>
[0049] The result has revealed that palatinose, when ingested before or after or simultaneously with consuming glucose or sucrose, does not work additively in blood glucose level caused by the consumed glucose or sucrose, but reduces reversely the increase in blood glucose level caused by glucose and sucrose [0050] It has been also demonstrated that, since palatinose leduces the increase in blood glucose level caused by glucose and sucrose, the iesult is similarly true when high fructose corn syrup being nearly a sucrose decomposition product, and starch or dextrin being decomposed to form glucose are ieplaced with suciose or glucose<br>
[0051]  As for a effect of reducing body  fat  accumulation,  the previous report (New Food Industry, Vol 31, No 10, 9-15, (1989))<br>
confirms that, when compaiing a body fat accumulation amount between one rat group of providing a sucrose-containing feed as a high fat diet and another rat group of providing another feed in which all the sucrose was replaced by palatinose, the rat group provided with the feed containing palatinose showed a lower body fat accumulation amount However, it was concluded that, comparing with values in body fat accumulation amount obtained by the sucrose-containing feed and the palatinose-containing feed, the value obtained by a feed in which a part of the sucrose was replaced by palatinose would be a value between above values depending on the ratio of added palatinose<br>
[0052] In the Example described later, three kinds of feeds were prepared, that is, a feed containing sucrose by 40% as a Comparative example, a palatinose feed in which all the sucrose was replaced with palatinose and a feed in which a part of the sucrose was replaced with palatinose Each of these feeds was ingested by rats for a long period of time to compare degree of body fat accumulation As a result, a group ingesting the palatinose feed showed a significantly lower value in fat tissue weight than a group ingesting the Comparative feed, as the conventional report on rat But a group ingesting the feed in which a part of the sucrose was replaced with palatinose showed a significantly lower value in body fat accumulation amount than the group ingesting the feed as the I ompaiative example Furthermore, The gioup showed a slightly lower value in fat tissue weight than the group ingesting the palatinose feed with a<br>
high effect to reduce body fat accumulation Hence it has been demonstrated that the feed in which a part of sucrose is replaced with palatinose gives the same level of effect to reduce body fat accumulation as the feed in which all the sucrose is replaced with palatinose<br>
[0053] A reducer of blood glucose level increase or of body fat accumulation of the invention may containrpalatinose as an active ingredient It may contain palatinose alone 01 a mixture of palatinose with one or more other constituent components Other constituent components include a pharmaceutically acceptable and publicly known ingredient of a carrier In addition, It may include sucrose, wheat flour, starch, dextrin, and high fructose corn syrup as described above<br>
[0054] When the reducer of blood glucose level increase or of the body fat accumulation contains one or more other constituent components, they can have an optionally deteimined ratio between the reducer of blood glucose level or the reducer of body fat accumulation and one or more other constituent components depending on an ingestion amount and timing The typical ratio of the reducer of blood glucose level increase one 01 more othei constituent components is 99 99 0 01-10 00 90 00, preferably 99 99 0 01-20 00 80 00, and more preferably 99 99 0 01-30 00 70 00 The ratio of reducei of the body fat accumulation the othei constituent component is 99 99 0 01-20 00 80 00, preferably 99 99 0 01-30 00 70 00, and more preferable 99 99 0 01-40 00 60 00<br>
[0055] When the weight of palatinose and the total weight of carbohydrate in a food material are designated by A and B respectively, the food material of the invention for reducing blood glucose level increase has an A/B ratio of 10% or more, and is preferably combined with palatinose to give an intake of 5g or more per 60kg of body weight of an individual The A/B ratio of 20% or more is preferable, and 30% or more is more preferable The palatinose is preferably incorporated to give an intake of l0g or more, more preferably 15g or more per 60kg of body weight of an individual<br>
[0056] When the weight of palatinose and the total weight of carbohydrate in a food matenal are designated by A and B respectively, the food material of the invention for reducing body fat accumulation has an A/B ratio of 20% oi more, and palatinose is preferably combined to give an intake of l0g or more per 60kg of body weight of an indevidual The A/B ratio of 30% or more is preferable, and 40% or more is more preferable The palatinose is preferably combined to give an intake of 15g or more, more preferably 20g or more per 60kg of body weight of an individual<br>
[0057] Palatinose can be obtained bv the method as described above When it is applied to a reduced of blood glucose level increase or a reducer of body fat accumulation with one or more other constituent components, they can be picpared by a publicly known mixing or formulating method An individual for the reducer of blood glucose level increase, the teducer of body fat<br>
accumulation and the food material of the invention may be human and a non-human animal (particulaily a mammal) Oral ingestion can be used for an ingesting method<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
[0058] The invention will be described below in more detail with<br>
reference to Examples, but is not limited to them<br>
Example 1<br>
[0059] 50g of sucrose, 25g of sucrose and 25g of glucose were<br>
each dissolved in distilled water to get a total weight of 190g to<br>
prepare the drink (Comparative drink 1, Comparative drink 2 and<br>
Comparative    drink    3,    respectively)	Using    each    of    the<br>
Comparative drinks as a control sample, a blood glucose level test after ingesting the drink was performed as will be described later     On the other hand, a combination of 25g of sucrose and 25g of palatinose, a combination of 42 5g of glucose and 7 5g of palatinose, a combination of 35g of glucose and I5g of palatinose, a combination of 25g of glucose and 25g of palatinose, and a combination of 25g of glucose and 2 78g of palatinose were each dissolved  in  distilled  water to  get  a  total   weight  of  190g  to prepaie the dunk (Example dunk  1, Example dunk 2, Example drink 3,  Example drink 4  and  Example dunk   5    tespectively) Using  each  ot  the  Example  drinks  as  a  test   sample,  a  blood glucose level test aftei ingesting the drink was performed [0060]    1 he   blood   glucose   level   test   was   as   follows       Five<br>
healthy volunteers (4 males and 1 temale), 11-40 aged, vveie selected as the test subjects They took no breakfast on a test day and kept fasting for 12hrs or more before the start of the test Their bloods were collected before ingesting a drink (Omin), and 30min, 60min, 90min, and 120min after ingesting it As a result their blood glucose levels are determined One kind of drink was ingested for one test Another drink was ingested on another day and the test was carried out once a day for total 8 days The same five test subjects were applied to all the tests for blood glucose levels In the Example 1, the fiee style Kissei kit (made by Kissei Pharmaceutical Co , LTD) was used to collect blood samples and test a blood glucose level<br>
[0061] The blood glucose level increase curves are shown in Fig 1 to compare the changes in blood glucose level after ingesting each of the drinks Fig 1 reveals that a blood glucose level increase is reduced after the simultaneous ingestion of 25g of palatinose and 25g of glucose, compared with after the ingestion of 25g of glucose alone A blood glucose level increase is reduced after the simultaneous ingestion of 25g of palatinose and 25g of sucrose, compared with after the ingestion of 50g of sucrose alone and 25g of sucrose alone Particularly, there is a remarkable diffeience between the Example drink and the Comparative drink as to a sudden increase in blood glucose level at 30min atter ingesting<br>
[0062] As shown in Fig 2, the comparison in aveiages calculated from the area undei  blood glucose level  inciease curves of the<br>
each test subject for 120mm after ingestion of sucrose alone or the simultaneous ingestion of sucrose and palatinose is carried out As a result, it is revealed that the area under blood glucose level increase curve for the simultaneous ingestion of 25g of sucrose and 25g of palatinose (Example drink 1) was significantly lower than that for the ingestion of 50g of sucrose (Comparative drink 1) with a risk rate of 1'ess than 5%, though the both drinks had the same level in carbohydrate weight and energy amount Further, ingestion of 25g of the sucrose (Comparative drink 2) gave a higher value of area under blood glucose level increase curve than ingestion of Example drink 1, though Comparative drink 2 had a lower level in carbohydrate weight and calorie<br>
[0063] Fig 3 shows the effect when glucose and palatinose are ingested together In the drinks having a constant carbohydrate weight of 50g (Example drmks 2, 3 and 4), the area under blood glucose level increase curve decreased according to the increase of the ratio of palatinose Further, in the drinks having a constant glucose weight of 25g (Comparative drink 3, Example drinks 4 and 5), the area under blood glucose level increase curve decreased according to the increase of palatinose amount ingested simultaneously, though the consumed carbohydrate amount incieased<br>
[0064] Fig 4 shows a graph for plotting GI values versus palatinose ratio in the consumed caibohvdrate (total 50g) as the honzontal axis  using the thus obtained data, the palatinose GI<br>
value (palatinose 100%) and the glucose Gl value (palatinose 0%) This reveals that the GI value decreased according to the increase of the palatinose ratio though the same carbohydrate amount and energy amount were ingested Particularly when the palatinose ratio went beyond 50%, the GI value went below 50 and felled to a value nearly equal to the value when 100% of palatinose (50g) was ingested Further, Fig 4 indicates that the GI value surely decreased when a palatinose ratio in a total carbohydiate (the total weight 50g) was 10% or more<br>
[0065] However, the GI value after ingeting of Example drink 5 (containing glucose 25g and palatinose 2 78g) was insignificantly lower than that of Comparative drink 3 (glucose 25g), though the Example drink 5 had a palatinose ratio of 10% in the total carbohydrate This teaches that there exists the minimum intake of palatinose necessary for the palatinose effect in addition to the palatinose ratio in the consumed carbohydrate The result of the Example indicates that the minimum intake of palatinose necessary to reduce an increase in blood glucose level is 5g or more<br>
[0066] The above result reveals that the simultaneous use of sucrose or glucose with palatinose has an effect for reducing an increase in blood glucose level<br>
Example 2<br>
[0067] 20g of palatinose was dissolved in distilled watei to make<br>
a total weight of 190g to prepaie an  Example dunk      190g of<br>
distilled water was used as a Contiol dunk The both drinks were used as the test samples for a blood glucose level test as described below<br>
[0068] The blood glucose level test was as follows Seven healthy volunteers (5 males and 2 females), 31-55 aged, were selected as the test subjects      They took breakfast by the time of<br>
4	hours before determining a blood glucase level and the blood<br>
glucose level prior to the dunk ingestion was measured The<br>
Example drink (190g) or the Control dunk (190g) was ingested<br>
while ingesting a packed lunch (trade name Nidan Orizume<br>
Makunouchi, made by Warabeya Nichiyo KK, energy 718Kcal,<br>
protein    29 8g,   fat    20 Og,   carbohydrate    104 6g,   and  sodium<br>
1 4g)      The test subjects' blood was collected with time 30min, 60min, 90min and 120min after the meal to measure their blood glucose levels      One kind of drink was ingested for one test The other drink was ingested on another day and the test was carried out once a day for total 2 days      Accordingly, one test subject was tested twice foi  blood glucose  level, that is, after ingesting the Example drink and after ingesting the Control drink The free style Kissei kit (made  by Kissei Pharmaceutical Co , LTD) was used to collect blood and to measure blood glucose level, as Example 1 [0069] The blood glucose level inciease curves aie shown in Fig<br>
5	to compaie the changes in blood glucose level after ingesting<br>
the respective drinks Fig 5 reveals that the inciease in blood<br>
glucose level after ingesting the Example dunk (palatinose) was<br>
slower than that after ingesting the Control drink (distilled water). The areas under blood glucose level curves arc shown in Fig 6 The graph reveals that the value of the area under blood glucose level curve of the case where the Example drink was ingested simultaneously with consuming food was lower compared with that of the case where the Control drink was ingested simultaneously with consuming food<br>
[0070] The above result reveals that palatinose ingested simultaneously with consuming food can reduce a blood glucose level increase after consuming the food<br>
Example 3<br>
[0071] Mice were consecutively fed with a feed added with palatinose, a feed added with sucrose and no palatinose, and a feed added with both palatinose and sucrose to compare their body fat accumulation amount<br>
[0072] C57BL/6CrSlc(SPF) male mice (30 heads) aged 7 weeks were fed with a commercial powder feed (tiade name CRF-1 powder, made by Oriental Yeast Co , LTD) and water ad libitum to prefeed for a week Then, they were separated into three groups each including 10 heads, that is, a group of feeding with a feed (Comparative feed) containing sucrose by 66 7% in carbohydrate, a group of feeding with a feed (Example feed 1) containing palatinose by 66 7% in carbohydrate, and a group of feeding with a feed (Example feed 2) containing palatinose by 30 0% and sucrose by 36 7% in caibohvdiate      The gioups wete<br>
fed with their respective feeds and water ad libitum for 8 weeks. Detailed composition of each' feed is shown in Table 1. The feeding condition was as follows: temperature 22±3°C, humidity (relative humidity) 50±20%, ventilation cycles 13-17times/hr, and lighting time 8:00-20:00 (light 12hrs, dark 12hrs).<br>
Table 1  (Table Removed)<br>
After the end of the feeding, the mice were light anesthetized with ether and sectioned abdominally to exsanguinate from postcava to death. For a typical example of every group, digital photographs showing body fat accumulation inside the abdominal cavity were taken. Then, for all the cases, the kidney peripheral fat (including the retroperitoneal fat) and the epididymis peripheral fat were taken out to measure their wet<br>
weights separately in left and right The mesenteric fat also was taken out to measure its wet weight These three kinds of fat tissues are typical of visceral fat The data were statistically treated to ascertain the homoscedasticity and further to carry out the t-test, which is of correspondency, in the case of homoscedasticity<br>
[0073] The changes in body weight of 'respective groups are shown in Fig 7 Body weights of the mice fed with the Example feeds were significantly lower than those of the mice fed with the Comparative feed As shown in Fig 8, comparing the fat tissue weights measured after feeding, the mice fed with the Example feed showed lower value of kidney peripheral fat and epididymis peripheral fat compared with the mice fed with the Comparative feed As shown in Fig 9, comparing the summed values of weight of kidney peripheral fat, epididymis peripheral fat and mesentry fat as the total visceral fat weight, the mice fed with the Example feeds showed a significantly lower value compared with the mice fed with the comparative feed [0074] The above results indicate that a feed added with palatinose as carbohydrate can reduce the rise in body weight and the accumulation in body fat compared with a feed added with sucrose as carbohydrate when mice consecutively ingest these feed, respectively<br>
[0075] Transition in the rise of body weight and state of the body fat accumulation were nearly equal in the case where the Example feed 1 with 40% palatinose was ingested and the case where the<br>
Example feed 2 with 22% sucrose and 18% palatinose was ingested, and the case where the Example teed 2 was ingested showed a slightly lower value Accordingly, it has been revealed that a feed containing both palatinose and sucrose exerts effects of reducing the increase in body weight and the accumulation of body fat as well as a feed containing palatinose alone Since the additive amount of sucrose was larger than that of palatinose in Example feed 2, the palatinose contained in the feed may exert the effect of reducing the accumulation of body fat caused by ingesting the sucrose<br>
[0076] The result of this Example demonstrates that palatinose exerts the effect of reducing the accumulation of body fat when it is contained at a ratio of 20% or more in carbohydrate The minimum intake of palatinose necessary to reduce a body fat accumulation is presumed to be l0g or more in terms of an intake ingested by a person having a body weight of 60kg<br>

materials  with  the  composition   as   shown   in  Table   10  below.<br>
Materials excluding shortening were previously mixed and then<br>
the molten shortening was added and mixed to be sieved.<br>
Table 10  (Table Removed)<br>
Test example 1<br>
[0087] A combination of sucrose and palatinose was ascertained to be more resistant to color than palatinose alone [0088] 5g of carbohydrate and lg of glutamic acid were dissolved in distilled water to prepare a sample having a total weight of 50g Three kinds of samples were prepared, that is, a sample containing sucrose alone as the carbohydrate, a sample containing palatinose alone as the carbohydrate, and a sample containing a combination of 2 5g sucrose and 2 5g palatinose as the carbohydrate These samples were filled in 100ml capped vials and then heated at 100°C for 50min After the heating, samples were cooled and respective absorbances were measured at a wavelength of 420nm As a lesult, the sample containing palatinose alone as the carbohydrate gave an absoibance oi 0 004,<br>
and the sample containing sucrose alone gave that of 0.0015, while the sample containing palatinose and sucrose by the equal weight gave that of 0.002. The sample containing palatinose and sucrose by the equal weight was more suppressed from coloring than the sample containing palatinose alone. This absorbance by the palatinose was a value which allowed a user to visually recognize the sample to be colored brown [0089] Three same kinds of samples were prepared and treated in an autoclave at 121°C for 20min, that is, the same level as in retort sterilization for a canned food, and measured the absorbance at a wavelength of 420nm. As a result, the sample containing palatinose alone as the carbohydrate gave an absorbance of 0.322, and the sample containing sucrose alone gave that of 0.020, while the sample containing palatinose and sucrose by the equal weight gave that of 0 069 The sample containing palatinose and sucrose by the equal weight was clearly more suppressed from coloring than the sample containing palatinose alone. All the samples were visually colored brown. But the sample containing palatinose alone as the carbohydrate had clearly deep brown, while the sample containing sucrose alone and the sample containing both palatinose and sucrose had clearly light brown.<br>
[0090] It has been concluded from the above result that use of a combination of palatinose and sucrose in a processed food can not only reduce an increase in blood glucose level caused by the sucrose,   but   also   suppress   a   heat   coloring   caused   by   the<br>
palatinose, comparing with use of palatinose alone<br>
Test example 2<br>
[Suppression of crystallization by simultaneous use of palatinose<br>
and sucrose]<br>
[0091] A combination of palatinose and sucrose was ascertained<br>
to be more resistant to crystallize than palatinose alone<br>
[0092]   A   solution   containing   50wt%   of  sucrose,   a   solution<br>
containing 50wt% of palatinose, and a solution containing each<br>
25wt%   of  sucrose   and   palatinose   were   prepared   by   100ml<br>
respectively,  and  then  they were  filled  in  capped  screw vials<br>
Dissolution was  performed  until  no  crystal  iemained at  50°C<br>
These  vials  were  put  in   a  refrigerator  set  at  5°C  to  observe<br>
crystallization<br>
[0093] After 2 days of storage, the solution containing palatinose<br>
alone began crystallization, and after 6 days amount of the crystal<br>
was measured      10 77g of palatinose was demonstrated to have<br>
crystallized     As for the solution containing sucrose alone and<br>
the    solution    containing    both    sucrose    and    palatinose,    no<br>
crystallization were observed during the days<br>
[0094] The above result reveals that palatinose contained in a<br>
concentration where it tends to crystallize when used alone dose<br>
not crystallize when it is simultaneously used with suciose<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
[0095] By ingesting palatinose before oi aftei oi simultaneously<br>
with consuming a kind of carbohydrate such as sucrose, glucose<br>
and high fructose corn syrup, which has an α-1,6-glucosyl bond ratio of from 0% to less than 50% relative to the total bonds among constituent saccharides, an increase in blood glucose level caused by the carbohydrate can be reduced Furthermore, palatinose, when used as a raw material in combination with one or more other carbohydrates such as nonreducing sugar, can reduce a factor for coloring to make food ie'sistant to coloring and, when used in a combination with one or more other carbohydrates with high solubility, becomes not to tend to crystallize [0096] Palatinose, when used in combination with a sweetener such as sucrose and high fructose corn syrup, reduces the sweetness caused by the sucrose, glucose or high fructose corn syrup, resulting in providing food with low sweetness [0097] When an effect of reducing an increase in blood glucose level is exerted by ingesting palatinose before or after or simultaneously with consuming one or more other carbohydrates, or consuming food containing a combination of palatinose and one or more other carbohydrates in the raw material, insulin secretion is also reduced to result in exerting an effect of reducing a body fat accumulation The invention can be applied to not only human but also a non-human animal (particularly a mammal)<br><br><br><br><br>
