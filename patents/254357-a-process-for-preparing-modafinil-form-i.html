FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
                           The present invention relates to a process for preparing modafinil free of    <br>
           impurities, as well as new crystalline forms of modafinil and processes for their  <br>
           preparation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
             (Â±) 2-[(Diphenylmethyl)sulfinyl]acetamide of formula 1, also known as modafinil,  <br>
 exerts a wakefulness-promoting effect on humans and animals.<br><br><br>
20<br><br>
		The psychotropic activity of modafinil was demonstrated in tests on animals such<br>
                as those described in U.S. Patent No. 4,177,290 ("the *290 patent") and in clinical trials on<br>
               human patients. Modafinil racemate is approved by the F.D.A. for treatment of<br>
25        narcolepsy.<br>
The '290 patent describes preparations of modafinil. In Example 1 of the '290 patent, modafinil is prepared by reacting 2-[(diphenylmethyl)thio]acetic acid chloride with ammonia, isolating the product amide and then oxidizing its sulfide group with hydrogen<br>
1<br><br>
WO 02/10125<br><br>
PCT/US01/23689<br><br>
peroxide in acetic acid. Example la of the '290 patent describes a different synthetic method for an industrial scale preparation of modafinil. Benzhydrol is reacted with thiourea to form an intermediate which is then hydrolyzed to 2-<br>
[(diphenylmethyl)thio]acetic acid. The acid is then oxidized in situ with hydrogen <br>
5                peroxide in a mixture containing chloroacetic acid and water. The resulting sulfoxide is then treated with  <br>
                  dimethyl sulfate to methylate the carboxylic acid group. The resulting ester is derivatized with ammonia  <br>
                to modafinil.<br>
Each of these methods uses hydrogen peroxide to oxidize a sulfide group to a sulfoxide. Drabowicz, J et al. Synthesis, 1990, 37-38 describes a procedure for oxidizing<br>
10	sterically hindered sulfides to sulfoxides. The procedure uses hydrogen peroxide as the<br>
oxidizing agent, methanol as the solvent and a mixture of sulfuric acid and one of several branched aliphatic alcohols as a catalyst. The procedure is well adapted for oxidizing sterically hindered sulfides. No products of over-oxidation were observed by thin layer chromatography of the reaction mixtures. Use of this methodology to prepare modafinil<br>
15	has not been described in the literature.<br>
Sulfides also may be oxidized to sulfoxides with other oxidizing agents, such as sodium periodate, /-butyl hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite, sodium chlorite, sodium hypochlorite, meto-chloroperbenzoic acid and sodium perborate. March J. Advanced Organic Chemistry 1201-02 (4th ed. 1992).<br>
20	We have discovered that the process of Example 1 of the "290 patent suffers from<br>
a problem of over-oxidation of the sulfide to sulphone 2.<br><br>
##STR( <br>
25                                                                                 			              		<br><br>
                                                                 )##STR<br>
By comparing the above presented chemical structures it will be readily appreciated that separation of the sulphone once fonned from modafinil is a difficult task.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 02/10125<br><br>
PCT/USO1/23689<br><br>
Therefore, the development of selective oxidation methods are required in order to obtain modafmil free of sulphone after one or more recrystaUizations.<br>
In the process described in Example la, significant amounts of intermediates 2-    <br>
5            [(diphenylmethyl)sulfinyl]acetic acid 3 and methyl 2-[(diphenylmethyl)sulfinyl]acetate 4 are obtained because  <br>
of incomplete conversion of the starting materials in Steps (b) and (c).  Becue, T; Broquaire, M. J. Chromatography 1991,557,489-494. These compounds are also difficult to separate from modafinil.<br><br><br>
6<br><br>
10<br>
Due to the volume of solvent used by industrial scale processes and the environmental issues raised by the disposal of large amounts of organic solvent, an<br>
15	industrial preparation that yields modifinil essentially free of impurities and requires only<br>
one crystallization of the end product to obtain modifinil free of impurities within the limit of detection is highly advantageous over an alternative process that requires repeated recrystaUizations to obtain modifil in equivalent purity. Although Example la of the '290 patent is described as an industrial process, two recrystaUizations were used to obtain the<br>
20	product as a white crystalline powder. The composition of that powder is not reported.<br>
It would be highly desirable to have an improved process that produces modafinil essentially free of sulphone 2 so that it may be obtained in high purity by a single crystallization. In addition, it also would be highly desirable to avoid using dimethyl sulfate, one of the reagents in Example la, since it is highly toxic.<br>
25	While pursuing the object of efficiently producing modafinil in high purity, we<br>
discovered that modafinil can be crystallized into several distinct solid state crystalline polymorphic forms. Crystalline forms of a compound are differentiated by the positions of the atomic nuclei in the unit cell of the solidified compound. The differences produce different macroscopic properties like thermal behavior, vapor permeability and solubility,<br>
3<br><br><br>
WO 02/10125<br><br>
PCT/US01/23689<br><br>
	which have practical consequences in pharmacy. Crystalline forms of a compound are<br>
                     V most readily distinguished by X-ray analysis. Single crystal X-ray crystalography yields<br>
                  data that can be used to determine the positions of the nuclei which in turn may be<br>
                   visualized with computer or mechanical models, thus providing a three-dimensional image<br>
5	of the compound. While single crystal X-ray studies provide unmatched structural<br>
information, they are expensive and quality data can sometimes be difficult to acquire. Powder X-ray diffraction spectroscopy is used more frequently by the pharmaceutical industry to characterize new crystalline forms of drugs than is single crystal X-ray analysis. Powder X-Ray diffraction spectroscopy yields a fingerprint that is unique to the<br>
10	crystalline form and is able distinguish it from the amorphous compound and all other<br>
crystalline forms of the compound.<br>
There is a wide variety of techniques that have the potential of producing different crystalline forms of a compound. Examples include crystallization, crystal digestion, sublimation and thermal treatment. In the laboratory preparation in Example 1 of the '290<br>
15	patent, modafinil is first precipitated by adding water to a reaction mixture containing<br>
modafinil, water and excess hydrogen peroxide. Modafinil is then recrystallized from methanol. In the industrial scale preparation of Example la, modafinil is obtained as a white powder by first crystallizing from a 1:4 mixture of methanol and water and then crystallizing again from a 1:9 methanol/water mixture. Crystallization from methanol and<br>
20	a 1:9 methanol/water mixture produces modafinil in polymorphic Form I. Modafinil<br>
Form I is characterized by a powder X-ray diffraction ("PXRD") pattern (Fig. 1) with reflections at 9.0,10.2,11.2,12.9,15.2,15.8,16.3,17.7,18.2,19.3,20.5,21.6,21.9, 23.2,26.6Â±0.2 degrees 26.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,927,855 describes the preparation of the levorotatory enantiomer<br>
25	of modafinil by chiral resolution of the 2-[(diphenylmethyl)sulfinyl]acetic acid with a-<br>
methylbenzyl amine. After recovery and amidation of the enantiomerically pure acid, (-) modafinil was obtained as white crystals by crystallization from ethanol.<br>
The discovery of a new crystalline form of a pharmaceutically useful compound provides an opportunity to improve the performance characteristics of a pharmaceutical<br>
30	product. It enlarges the repertoire of materials that a formulation scientist has available<br>

                 enlarged by the discovery of new crystalline forms of a useful compound. Five new<br>
                 crystalline forms of modafinil that are not accessible by following crystallization<br>

15	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
               The present invention provides a process for preparing modafinil, whereby it may "~<br>
               be isolated in high purity by a single crystallization. The process includes oxidation of 2-<br>
               [(diphenylmethyl)thio]acetamide with H2Oz in a mixture of a mineral acid, an alcohol or<br>
                   phase transfer catalyst and optionally an inert liquid organic medium. Modafinil is<br>
20	precipitated from the reaction mixture and then crystallized in 2:99.5% purity. The<br>
oxidation method produces modafinil essentially free of sulphone products of over-oxidation which enables modafinil to be obtained free of sulphone within the limits of UV detection after two crystallizations.<br>
The present invention further provides new crystalline Forms II- VI of modafinil<br>
25	and processes for preparing them. Each of the new forms is differentiated by a unique<br>
powder X-ray diffraction pattern.<br>
The present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions containing novel modafinil Forms II-IV and VI.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
	In this disclosure, modafinil with a combined impurity content of less than 0.1 %<br>
               is referred to as "highly pure" modafinil. Purity is measured by UV absorbance at k=225<br>
              nm. Compounds containing phenyl rings absorb strongly in this region of the U.V.<br>
5	spectrum. Modafinil and problematic impurities 2-4 each possess two phenyl UV<br>
chromophores. Modafinil that contains less than 0.01% of an impurity such as sulphone 2 is referred to as "essentially free" of that impurity and modafinil that is free of an impurity within the limit of detection of the purity analysis or that contains less than 0.0001% of the impurity is referred to as being "free" of that impurity.<br>
10	The present invention provides an improved synthetic preparation of modafinil<br>
whereby modafinil may be isolated in Â£ 99.5 % purity after a single recrystallization, preferably 2:99.9% purity. In this improved process, 2-[(diphenylmethyl)thio]acetamide is oxidized to modafinil. The modafinil is then separated as a solid from the reagents used in the oxidation and thereafter is isolated in high purity by a single recrystallization.<br>
15	In the oxidation step, hydrogen peroxide is reacted with 2-[(diphenylmethyl)thio]<br>
acetamide in the presence of a mineral acid and a linear, branched or cyclic alcohol, or a phase transfer catalyst, optionally in an inert liquid organic medium. The oxidizing conditions are discussed generally in Drabowicz, J et al. Synthesis, 1990,37-38. U.S. Patent No. 4,177,290 is incorporated by reference for its teaching of a preparation of 2-<br>
20	[(diphenylmethyl)thio] acetamide.<br>
Hydrogen peroxide is preferably supplied as a 10-50 wt. % solution in water, more preferably about 30-33 wt. % solution in water. Such solutions are commercially available (e.g. 1998-99 Aldrich Chemical Co. Cat. Nos. 42,065-4; 42,066-2; 31,698-9; 21,676-3). Exemplary mineral acids that may be used include H2S04, HC104 and H3P04.<br>
25	Preferred alcohols are derived from hydrocarbons with seven or fewer carbon<br>
atoms and that are unsubstituted except for the hydroxyl group. Branched alcohols are most preferred. Isopropyl alcohol, terf-butanol and 2-methyl-l-butanol are exemplary of alcohols that may be used. Suitable phase transfer catalysts include triethylbenzylammonium chloride (TEB A) and polyethylene glycol.<br>

WO 02/10125<br><br>
PCT/US01/23689<br><br>
             An inert liquid organic medium is a diluent for the oxidation reaction that may<br>
                  decrease the rate of the oxidation but does not prevent oxidation of the sulfide group of 2-<br>
                 [(diphenylmethyl)thioJacetamide to a sulfoxide group or cause overoxidation of the<br>
                sulfide group to a sulphone. Preferred inert liquid organic media are unbranched alcohols<br>
5	such as methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol; ketones, such as acetone, which may<br>
contain water, esters, such as ethyl acetate and dimethylcarbonate; and mixtures thereof.<br>
  In the oxidation step, 2-[(diphenylmethyl)thio]acetamide ("the sulfide") is<br>
                 contacted with an excess of hydrogen peroxide, preferably from about 1.5 to about 4<br>
molar equivalents. The mineral acid need only be used in a catalytic amount, preferably<br>
10	from about 0.02 to about 0.2 molar equivalents with respect to the sulfide. The alcohol or<br>
                 phase transfer catalyst is preferably used in an amount of from about 2 to about 4<br>
                 equivalents with respect to the sulfide, more preferably about 3 equivalents. When an<br>
               inert liquid organic medium is used, the oxidation reaction is preferably conducted at a<br>
               sulfide concentration of from about 0.07 to about 0.2 grams of sulfide per milliliter of<br>
15        inert liquid organic medium.<br>
               The required reagents may be added in any order desired and the reaction mixture<br>
               may be maintained at any condition that causes oxidation of 2-[(diphenylmethyl)<br>
                thiojacetamide to modafinil. The following procedure has been found in practice to<br>
                produce modafinil in a sufficiently high state of purity directly by precipitation from the<br>
20	reaction mixture that modafinil may be therafter obtained in s 99.5 % purity, more<br>
                  preferrably greater than 99.9% purity, by a single crystallization. 2-<br>
                 [(Diphenylmethyl)thio]acetamide is suspended in the inert liquid organic medium. The<br>
                mineral acid and the alcohol or phase transfer catalyst are then added at room<br>
                  temperature. Hydrogen peroxide is then added. The temperature of the reaction mixture<br>
25	is raised to about 30 Â°C and stirred for several hours. Progress of the reaction may be<br>
monitored by HPLC. After oxidation is complete, the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and the excess hydrogen peroxide is decomposed with, for example, sodium metabisulfite, sodium thiosulfide, sodium sulfide or ferrous sulfate.<br>
After the oxidation is complete and any excess H202 has been decomposed,<br>
30	modafinil is precipitated from the reaction mixture. Precipitation can be accelerated by<br>
7<br><br>
WO 02/10125<br><br>
PCT/US01/23689<br><br>
       adding water. Modafinil is then separated from the reaction mixture by conventional W means such as               <br>
       filtering or decanting. The modafinil preferably is then washed with an organic solvent and water.<br>
The improved process for preparing modafinil produces modafinil with a low<br>
5	content of 2-[(diphenylmethyl)sulfonyl]acetamide 2,2-[( diphenyl methyl)sulphinyl]<br>
acetic acid 3, and methyl 2-[(diphenylmethyl)sulphinyl] acetate 4, which can be removed with a single recrystallization. The modafinil that precipitates from the reaction mixture should be 98-99% pure or greater and will typically contain less than 0.1 % suphone 2. Modafinil has been precipitated directly from the reaction mixture with less than 0.01%<br>
10	contamination with sulphone 2. The composition of the oxidation reaction mixture may<br>
be monitored quantitatively by HPLC to confirm that the reaction is proceeding cleanly. A reverse phase HPLC method with UV detection at A,=225 nm may be used.<br>
Although modafinil obtained by oxidation according to the above-described process may be recrystallized from a variety of solvents in high purity, the best<br>
15	recrystallization solvents have been found to be methanol, ethanol, dimethylcarbonate,<br>
acetone, and mixtures thereof. The best multicomponent solvent systems are ethanol/dimethylcarbonate, acetone/dimethylcarbonate, acetone/water, acetone/ethyl acetate, acetone/dimethylcarbonate /water and methanol/dimethylcarbonate. An especially preferred recrystallization solvent is dimethyl carbonate.<br>
20	The modafinil that is obtained after crystallization is z 99.5% pure, more<br>
preferably 99.9% pure and contains less than 0.02%, more preferably less than 0.01% of of sulphone 2. After crystallization from preferred recrystallization solvents, modafinil may be obtained free of sulphone 2, i.e. with no more than 0.0002 % or 0.0001% contamination. It will be appreciated that such minute quantities of impurity are at or<br>
25	beyond the limits of detection of many analytical techniques.<br>
In a second aspect, the present invention provides novel crystalline modafinil Forms II-VI and processes for their preparation.<br>
A general technique that leads to the discovery of a novel crystalline form of a compound may be well known to those skilled in the art. In fact, that is commonly the<br>
30	case. Such techniques include crystallization, crystal digestion, sublimation, thermal<br>
8<br><br>
WO 02/10125<br><br>
PC17US01/23689<br><br>
                    treatment, and pH adjustment. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that in the search<br>
                    K     for new polymorphic forms of a compound, any one of these techniques is expected to fail<br>
                   to produce a new crystalline form of the compound. The search is an empirical exercise<br>
                  that involves trial and error experimentation with different techniques and conditions. For<br>
5	these reasons, it is not possible to define all techniques and conditions that will produce<br>
modafinil crystalline Forms II-VI. It is, however, possible to provide methods which have successfully and selectively produced modafinil in one of these desired forms.<br>
The novel crystalline forms of modafinil have been characterized by powder X-ray<br>
               diffraction spectroscopy which produces a fingerprint of the particular crystalline form.<br>
10	Measurements of 20 values typically are accurate to within Â±0.2 degrees.<br>
X-ray diffraction data were acquired using a Philips powder X-ray diffractometer, Goniometer model 1050/70                         <br>
at a scanning speed of 2Â° per minute, with a CUKa,, radiation of = 1.5418 A. The sample was gently ground and <br>
dusted over a zero background quartz plate to give a thin layer. <br>

Modafinil Form I<br>
                           The present invention provides processes for preparing modafinil Form I.<br>
                           Modafinil Form I may prepared by crystallization from acetone, acetonitrile,<br>
                  benzyl alcohol, dimethyl formamide, methanol, methyl ethyl ketone or 2-pyrrolidone.<br>
20	Preferred recrystallization solvents are methanol and acetone. Crystallization may be<br>
accelerated by cooling the solution, adding an antisolvent or seeding the solution with a<br>
	crystal of modafmil Form I. Preferred solvent/anti-solvent combinations are<br>
                   acetone/water, DMF/water, acetonitrile/water, ethanol/water and methanol/ethyl acetate.<br>
                     Modafinil Form I also may be prepared by suspending a mixture of modafinil<br>
25	Forms I and II in ethyl acetate for a sufficient time to complete the conversion. If the<br>
starting modafinil form is Form n, then several other organic liquids may be substituted for ethyl acetate to promote conversion to Form I. In particular, Form II modafinil also may be converted into Form I modafinil by suspending it in methyl tert-butyl ether ("MTBE"), water or isobutyl acetate. It is particularly convenient to practice this<br>
9<br><br>
WO 02/10125<br><br>
PCT/US01/23689<br><br>
technique for preparing Form I by simply slurrying modafinil (in any other form) with #&gt;      ethyl acetate,             <br>
isobutyl acetate or water until the conversion is complete.<br>
Forms V and VI convert into modafinil Form I upon gentle heating to about 80 Â°C<br>
              or above. Forms V and VI may be transformed into Form I without significant<br>
5	decomposition by heating to about 100Â°C.<br>
Modafinil Form I may be separated from solvents conventionally by filtering or decanting and then drying.          <br>
Form I has been dried at a temperature as high as 100Â°C without converting to another crystalline or <br>
amorphous form and without undergoing significant chemical decomposition. <br>

Modafinil Form II<br>
The present invention also provides modafinil Form II. Modafinil Form II<br>
produces a powder X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 2) with reflections at 9.1,10.3,11.1,<br>
11.9,14.3,15.2,16.4,17.5,18.4,20.5,21.3,24.6,26.6Â±0.2 degrees 26. The strong<br>
15	   reflections at 14.3,17.5,20.5 and 21.3 degrees 20 are particularly characteristic. Of<br>
these, the reflections at 14.3,17.5 and 21.3 degrees 29 are most characteristic.<br>
The following techniques have proven effective for producing modafinil in<br>
                    crystalline Form II.<br>
Modafinil Form III converts into modafinil Form II when it is suspended in water.<br>
20	Thus, suspending Form III in water provides a method of accessing modafinil Form n.<br>
  Modafinil also crystallizes selectively in Form II from ethanol, isopropanol, n-<br>
                 butanol, f-butanol, methyl isobutyl ketone, ethylene glycol, dioxolane and dioxane by<br>
                 heating to dissolve modafinil in the solvent and cooling to recrystallize.  Modafinil Form<br>
                II also may be prepared by reslurrying in dichloroethane and by rapidly cooling a solution<br>
25	of modafinil in a methanol and water mixture.<br>
Modafinil Form III<br>
The present invention also provides modafiml Form IH. Modafinil Form HI<br>
                  produces a powder X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 3) with reflections at 7.4,9.0,10.5,<br>
30	12.3,14.2,14.7,15.1,16.4,18.3,20.0,20.5,21.1,22.1,24.5Â±0.2 degrees 29.<br>
10<br><br>
WO 02/10125<br><br>
PCT/US01/23689<br><br>
The strong reflections at 7.4,10.5,18.3,20.0 and 20.5 degrees 29 are particularly "characteristic. Of              <br>
these, the reflections at 7.4,10.5,18.3 and 20.0 degrees 28 are<br>
               characteristic for their intensity and the absence of reflections at corresponding positions<br>
               in the PXRD patterns of the other forms.<br>
5	Modafinil Form IE is produced by crystallization from toluene. Form HI has also<br>
been crystallized from mixtures of dimethyl carbonate and ethanol, although it has in instances been obtained in mixture with Form V when crystallized from this mixed solvent system.<br>
10	Modafinil Form IV<br>
	The present invention also provides modafinil Form IV. Modafinil Form IV<br>
produces a powder X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 4) with reflections at 6.9,10.4,14.1, 17.2,18.5,20.3,20.8,21.6,22.7,25.0,26.5,27.6,28.5Â±0.2 degrees 28. The strong reflections at 6.9,10.4,17.2,20.3 and 22.7 degrees 20 are particularly characteristic.<br>
15	Modafinil crystallizes from tetrahydrofuran and dimethyl sulfoxide in crystalline<br>
FormlV.<br>
Modafinil Form V<br>
The present invention also provides modafinil Form V. Form V produces a<br>
20	powder X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 5) with reflections at 7.4,9.3,10.5,12.4,14.7,<br>
16.2,18.2,19.9, 21.5,22.0,23.6,24.5,25.2, 28.4,29.5,31.8Â±0.2 degrees 28. The strong<br>
(	reflections at 9.3,12.4,18.2,19.9, and 22.0 degrees 20 are particularly characteristic.<br>
    Form V is prepared by crystallization from dimethylcarbonate and mixtures of<br>
                 dimethylcarbonate and ethanol, dimethylcarbonate and water and dimethylcarbonate and<br>
25	acetone.<br>
Thermogravimetric analysis of Form V showed a mass loss of about 12% starting<br>
                at about 100Â°C up to 150Â°C. This LOD is consistent with Form V being a hemi-solvate<br>
                 of modafinil with dimethylcarbonate. The TGA analysis was performed on a Shimadzu<br>
                 DTG 60, with a sample of about 10 mg that was heated at the rate of about 10Â° C per min<br>
30	from about ambient temperature to about 300Â° C.<br>

Modafinil Form VI<br>
	The present invention also provides modafinil Form VI. Form VI produces a<br>
             powder X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 6) with reflections at 9.0,9.3,10.2,12.4,14.2,<br>
            14.5,15.3,17.5,18.1,20.0,20.5,21.5,22.0,23.5,24.5,25.0Â±0.2 degrees 20. The<br>
5	reflections at 9.3,18.1, and 20.5 degrees 26 are particularly characteristic for their<br>
intensity.<br>
           Modafinil Form VI may be prepared by suspending modafinil Form V in water,  .<br>
                 ethanol or a water/ethanol mixture for a sufficient time to complete the conversion.<br>
                 Preferably, modafinil Form VI is slurried in water, ethanol, or an ethanol/water mixture at<br>
10	about 28 Â°C, followed by drying under vacuum at 55 Â°C.<br>
Amorphous Modafinil<br>
Modafinil may be prepared in an amorphous state by crystallization from mixtures<br>
              of ortho, meta or para xylene.<br>
15	Having described techniques best suited for producing distinct crystalline Forms<br>
II-VI of modafinil in a laboratory and industrial setting, those skilled in the art will appreciate that these forms may be accessible by yet other methods.<br>

                          When a dosage form such as a tablet is made by compaction of a powdered        <br>
       composition, the composition is subjected to pressure from a punch and dye. Some                  <br>
       excipients and active ingredients have a tendancy to adhere to the surfaces of the punch <br>
      and dye, which can cause the product to have pitting and other surface irregularities. A <br>
5                   lubricant can be added to the composition to reduce adhesion and ease release of the product  <br>
                      from the dye. Lubricants include magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, glyceryl monostearate,  <br>
                      glyceryl palmitostearate, hydrogenated castor oil, hydrogenated vegetable oil, mineral oil, <br>
                      polyethylene glycol, sodium benzoate, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium stearyl fumarate,  <br>
                   stearic acid, talc and zinc stearate.<br>
10                                   Flavoring agents and flavor enhancers make the dosage form more palatable to the  <br>
                      patient. Common flavoring agents and flavor enhancers for pharmaceutical products that may  <br>
                      be included in the composition of the present invention include maltol, vanillin, ethyl vanillin,  <br>
                     menthol, citric acid, fumaric acid ethyl maltol, and tartaric acid.<br>

15                to improve their appearance and/or facilitate patient identification of the product and unit  <br>
                 dosage level.<br>
                      Selection of excipients and the amounts to use may be readily determined by the  <br>
      formulation scientist based upon experience and consideration of standard procedures and  <br>
     reference works in the field.<br>
