FABRIC CONDITIONING COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 1657166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
WO 2006/013033<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/008074<br><br>

FABRIC CONDITIONING COMPOSITIONS Field of the Invention<br>
5  The present invention relates to fabric conditioning<br>
compositions, and in particular, relates to liquid fabric softener compositions comprising a fluorescer.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
10<br>
Rinse added fabric conditioning compositions are well known. Typically, such compositions comprise a liquid or solid fabric softening agent dispersed in an aqueous medium.  The fabric softening agent can be included at up to 8% by<br>
15  weight, in which case the compositions are considered<br>
dilute, or at levels from 8% to 60% by weight, in which case the compositions are considered concentrated.<br>
One of the problems frequently associated with conventional<br>
20  fabric conditioner compositions is that, upon'repeated use, yellowing can occur.<br>
It has been suggested in the prior art to address this problem by incorporating a fluorescent dye, such as the salt<br>
25  of a diaminostilbene (DAS) derivative, within the fabric conditioning composition.  However, as this is an anionic compound, it can adversely affect the performance of the softening compound when such a compound is cationic. Also, any complex with a cationic softening compound may give<br>
30  reduced stability against photodegradation. Thus, it may decompose and lose any fluorescing benefits.<br><br>
WO 2006/013033<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/008074<br><br>
-  3  -<br>
Increasingly, clear fabric conditioning compositions are desired by the consumer.  Therefore, it is desirable to provide a clear composition which has a greatly enhanced appearance. <br>
5<br>
WO 98/52907 describes a cationic fabric conditioning composition which may optionally be clear and may contain a diaminostilbene derivative fluorescer.  The diaminostilbene fluorescer is classified as hydrophilic.<br>
 10<br>
However, this does not -address the problem of providing a clear or translucent liquid fabric conditioning composition comprising a cationic softening compound and a fluorescer which is stable to photodegradation.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
Thus, the present invention seeks to address one or more of the above-mentioned problems, and, to give one or more of <br>
20  the above-mentioned benefits desired by consumers.<br>
Surprisingly, we have found that a clear or translucent fabric conditioning composition comprising a fluorescer of the type defined in claim 1 is stable against <br>
25  photodegradation.<br>
Furthermore, we have found that such a composition provides<br>
a greatly enhanced appearance to the clear or translucent composition. Also, it provides increased stability against<br>
30 	 photodegradation for other products (when present) in the composition, e.g. dyes and perfumes. <br><br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention is particularly concerned with clear <br>
5  		or translucent liquid fabric softening compositions.<br>
Such a product is preferably, though not essentially, a microemulsion.  That is a product which is isotropic and thermodynamically stable over a specified temperature range.<br>

Fluoresce!-<br>
The clear or translucent composition of the present invention comprises a fluorescer which is hydrophobic.<br>
By hydrophobic it is meant that the fluorescer has a hydrophobic!ty, measured by ClogP, of 3 to 50, more preferably 4 to 50, most preferably 5 to 50, e.g. 6 to 50<br><br>
2 0  ClogP is measured using the "ClogP" program (calculation of hydrophobicities as logP (oil/water)) version 4.01, available from Daylight Chemical information Systems Inc of Irvine California, USA.<br><br><br>

-A commercially available fluorescer of this type is Blankophor DCB (4- [3-(4-chlorophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-lh-pyrazol-l-yl]benzenesulphonamide), ex Bayer.<br>
the a<br>
5 	 The fluorescer is solubilised in the organic phase of composition.  It has been observed that this provides greater deposition of the fluorescer onto synthetic materials, e.g. polyesters, than if the fluorescer is solubilised in the aqueous phase of the composition.<br>
10<br>
Typically, the fluorescer is present at a level of from 0.001 to 2wt%, more preferably from 0.003 to 1.5wt%, most preferably from 0.004 to lwt%, e.g. 0.005 to 0.8wt%, based on the total weight of the composition.<br>

Excluded Fluorescers<br>
Hydrophilic fluorescers, as described below, are not suitable for use in the compositions of the present<br>
 2 0 	 invention.<br>
Diaminostilbene disulphonic acid type fluorescers (hereinafter referred to as "DAS") are classified as hydrophilic in WO-A-98/52907.  A commercial example of a DAS <br>
25  	is Tinopal DMS (ex CTBA) .<br>
Another type of hydrophilic fluorescer is a distyrylbiphenyl<br>
fluorescer (hereinafter referred to aa *DSBP*). A<br>
commercial example of this type of fluorescer is Tinopal<br>
 30  	CBS-X (also ex CIBA).<br><br>

These materials were introduced, as purchased, at a level of 0.1wt%, into a standard concentrate fabric softening composition (Comfort Concentrate, purchased UK 2004) and a clear fabric softening composition (Lenor Enhancer,<br>
5  	purchased UK 2004) by post-dosing and stirring.  In both cases, the fluorescer formed large clumps of yellow solid particles.  Thus, they do not form stable compositions, as is required by the compositions of the present invention.<br>
10  Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that both DAS and DSPB fluorescers complex with cationic materials, e.g. cationic softening agents, that are typically present in softening compositions forming insoluble floes.<br>

25  		water insoluble quaternary ammonium material which comprises<br>
a compound having two C12-I8 alkyl or alkenyl groups<br>
connected to the nitrogen head group via at least one ester link.  It is more preferred if the quaternary ammonium material has two ester links present.<br><br>

It is believed that higher cis:trans isomer weight ratios afford the compositions comprising the compound better low temperature stability and minimal odour formation.  Suitable<br>
25  fatty acids include Radiacid 406, ex. Fina.<br>
Of course, the cis-.trans isomer weight ratios can be<br>
controlled during hydrogenation "by methods known in the art such as by optimal mixing, using specific catalysts and <br>

Oils<br>
The compositions of the present invention comprise at least one oil.  The oil may be a mineral oil, an ester oil and/or<br>
15  	atural oils such as vegetable oils.  However, ester oils or mineral oils are preferred.<br>
The ester oils are preferably hydrophobic in nature.  They include fatty esters of mono or polyhydric alcohols having<br>
2 0  from 1 to 24 carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon chain, and mono or polycarboxylic acids having from 1 to 24 carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon chain, provided that the total number of carbon atoms in the ester oil is equal to or greater than 16, and that at least one of the hydrocarbon chains has 12<br>
25  or more carbon atoms.<br>
Suitable ester oils include saturated ester oils, such as the PRIOLUBES and BSTOLS (ex. Uniqema).  2-ethyl hexyl stearate (PRIOLUBE 1545), neopentyl glycol monomerate <br>
30  (PRIOLUBE 2045), methyl laurate (PRIOLUBE 1415), isopropyl<br><br>

myristate (ESTOL 1514), propylene glycol dicaprylate (ESTOL 1526) and ethyl hexyl cocoate (ESTOL 1540) are particularly preferred although oleic monoglyceride (PRIOLUBE 1407) and neopentyl glycol dioleate (PRIOLUBE 1446) are also suitable.<br>
 5<br>
The ester oil may also be a CPE or RSE polyester oil, as defined on page 4 line 28 to page 9 line 16 of WO-A1-98/16538, the content of which is incorporated herein.<br>
10  It is preferred that the viscosity of the ester oil is from 0.002 to 0.4 Pa.S (2 to 400 cps) at a temperature of 25°C at 106s , measured using a Haake rotoviscometer, and that the density of the mineral oil is from 0.8 to 0.9g.cm  at 25 C.<br>
15  Suitable mineral oils include branched or straight chain hydrocarbons (e.g. paraffins) having 8 to 35, more preferably 9 to 20 carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon chain.<br>
Preferred mineral oils include the Marcol technical range of <br>
20  	oils(ex Esso) although particularly preferred is the Sirius range (ex Silkolene) or Semtol (ex. Witco Corp.).  The molecular weight of the mineral oil is typically within the range 100 to 400.<br>
25  One or more oils of any of the above mentioned types may be used.<br>
It is believed that the oil provides excellent perfume delivery to the cloth and also increases perfume longevity<br>
30  upon storage of the composition.<br><br>

The oil may be present in an amount from 11-70% by weight, more preferably 12-60%, by weight most preferably 15-52%, e.g. 20-45% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition. <br>
5<br>
The weight ratio of cationic softener to oil in the composition is in the range from 5:1 to 1:10,.preferably from 4:1 to 1:5, more preferably from 3:1 to 1:3.<br>
10  The oil referred to herein, is preferably added to the<br>
composition as a separate component, that is, in addition to any oil which may be present in other components of the composition.<br>
15  Low Molecular Weight Solvent<br>
The solvent is preferably organic, such as a low molecular weight (preferably 180 or less) alcohol, including monohydric and polyhydric alcohols, e.g. diols. <br>
20<br>
The presence of the lower molecular weight alcohol helps improve physical stability upon storage by lowering the<br>
viscosity to a more desired level and also assists the<br>
formation of the micro-emulsion.  Examples of suitable <br>
25  alcohols include ethanol, isopropanol, n-propanol,<br>
dipropylene glycol, t-butyl alcohol, 2,2,4-trimethyl-l,3-pentanediol (TMP), hexylene glycol, and glycerol.<br>
Although the foregoing are suitable, it is especially <br>
30  desirable to use a combination of 2,2,4-trimethyl-l,3-<br>
pentanediol (TMP) and hexylene glycol.  This combination is<br><br>

-   15   -<br>
far superior to other alcohols in solubilising the<br>
components of the composition whilst avoiding undesirable odours.<br>
5 The solvent may be added to the composition either by being present as a component in the cationic surfactant or it may be added separately.<br>
The solvent is preferably present in an amount from 0.05% to 10	0% by weight, more preferably from 0.1% to 25% by weight, most preferably from 0.15% to 16% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
The weight ratio of cationic softener to solvent in the <br>
15  	cmposition is in the range from 8:1 to 1:3, preferably from 6:1 to 1:2, more preferably from 4:1 to 1:1.<br>
Mixtures of solvents may be used if desired.<br>
20  Water<br>
The compositions of the invention may be aqueous based.<br>
Typically, the level of water present is from 0.5-99% by 25  weight, more preferably 1-89% by weight, even more<br>
preferably 2-87% by weight, most preferably 3-85% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.<br><br>

Dispersion Aids<br>
Optionally and advantageously, the compositions contain one or more dispersion aids.  The dispersion aid assists the <br>
5 		ispersion of the micro-emulsion when it is diluted in water.<br>
Especially preferred dispersion aids for use in the compositions of the invention are alkoxylated nonionic fatty<br>
10 		aohols, such as C10-C22 alkyl/alkenyl alkoxylated with 3-20<br>
moles alkoxy moieties.  The fatty alcohols may be alkoxylated with ethylene oxide, propylene oxide or ethylene oxide/propylene oxide mixtures.<br>
15  Other dispersion aids which may be used in the compositions of the invention can be selected from mono-long chain alkyl cationic quaternary ammonium compounds and mono-long chain alkyl amine oxides.<br>
20  Preferably the concentration of the dispersion aid is from 0.05-30% by weight, more preferably from 0.3-20% by weight, most preferably from 1-15% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
25  The dispersion aid may also act as a stabiliser for the micro-emulsion so that addition of the dispersion aid provides a more stable micro-emulsion product.<br>
The weight ratio of the quaternary cationic softening<br>
30  	ompound to the total amount of dispersion aid is from 3:1 to 8:1, more preferably 5:1 to 7:1.<br><br>

Anti-Qxidation/Reduction Stabilisers<br>
The compositions of the invention may, optionally, comprise one or more additional stabilisers which stabilise against<br>
 5  oxidation and/or reduction.<br>
If the stabilisers are present as anti-oxidants, they may be added at a level of from 0.005 to 2% by weight based on the total weight of the composition, more preferably from 0.01 10  to 0.2% by weight, most preferably from 0.035% to 0.1% by weight.<br>
If present as an anti-reduction agent, then the stabiliser is preferably used in an amount from 0.001% to 0.2% by <br>
15  weight based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
The stabilisers assist by assuring good odour stability upon storage particularly when the composition is prepared using a surfactant having substantial unsaturated character (i.e. <br>
