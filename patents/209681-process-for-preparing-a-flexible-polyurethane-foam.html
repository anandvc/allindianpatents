COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
                                               [See Section 10),Rule 13]<br>
"PROCESS FOR PREPARING A FLEXIBLE POLYURETHANE FOAM"<br>
HUNTSMAN INTERNATIOAL LLC, a limited liability company formed under the laws of Delaware, of 500 Huntsman Way, Salt Lake City, Utah 84108, United States of America<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertain the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>
The present invention is concerned with a process for preparing flexible polyurethane foams.<br>
It is widely known to prepare flexible polyurethane foams by reacting an 5 organic polyisocyanate and a high molecular weight isocyanate-reactive compound in the presence of a blowing agent. More in particular it has been disclosed in EP 111121 to prepare flexible polyurethane foams from a polyisocyanate composition comprising a semi-prepolymer. The polyisocyanate composition is prepared by reacting a diphenylmethane<br>
10 diisocyanate and a polyol; a polymethylene polyphenylene polyisocyanate (polymeric MDI) is used as well.<br>
In EP 392788 flexible foams are prepared by reacting semi-prepolymers or prepolymers with an isocyanate-reactive composition containing a high amount of water.<br>
15 In EP 296449 flexible foams are prepared by reacting polyisocyanates, polyols and water at a relatively low NCO-index.<br>
Copending application PCT/EP95/02068 is concerned with a process for making flexible foams using a semi-prepolymer which has been made by reacting a portion of polymeric MDI with a polyol and adding the other part 20 to the reaction product so obtained.<br>
Although useful flexible foams based on MDI and polymeric MDI and polymeric MDI are obtainable, room for improvement exists. In particular foams made in a closed mould which foams are to be used as cushioning material in automotive seating could be improved as to foam strength, 25 resilience (ball rebound) particularly at low density of the foam.<br><br>
In the past some of these improvements have been obtained by using tolylene diisocyanate (TDI) instead of MDI. In particular such foams show a high resilience, good foam strength at low density. However, due to its vapour pressure and toxicity special measures need 5 to be taken to handle TDI. Further TDI based foams show relatively poor hardness especially at low density and a slow cure and narrow processing range (isocyanate index).<br>
More recently, proposals have been made to avoid the disadvantages of both MDI-based and TDI-based foams by using combinations of MDI and 10 TDI.<br>
In EP 439792 the use of a polyisocyanate has been proposed which comprises 21-95% by weight of TDI in order to improve the tensile strength; the amount of TDI used still is relatively high.<br>
In EP 679671 the use of a mixture of polymeric MDI and TDI comprising 15 3-20% by weight of TDI has been proposed to prepare a low density foam having an enhanced impact resilience, improved compression set and an excellent ability to reduce 6 Hz vibration transmissibility. The polymeric MDI used has a high three benzene ring compound content compared to the four or more benzene ring compound content + less active ingredient. 20 The use of polymer polyols has been proposed in very general terms.<br>
In EP 694570 the use of a polyisocyanate prepolymer has been proposed comprising MDI, polymeric MDI and 5-15% by weight of TDI. The polyisocyanate prepolymer has improved flowability; the foams made thereof show improved ILD, compression set and flammability 25 characteristics.   The use of a graft polymer dispersion in   a polyol has<br><br>
been proposed as well.<br>
In WO 97/19971 it has been proposed to use an MDI prepolymer and TDI<br>
to   improve   resilience   and   foam   stability,   comfort   properties   and<br>
mechanical strength.  The amount of TDI may be 2-25% by weight of the<br>
5 polyisocyanate composition, which has an MDI + TDI functionality of<br>
2.05-2.35.      The   use   of   polymer   polyol   prepared   by   the   in   situ<br>
polymerisation of styrene and/or acrylonitrile in polymeric polyols or by the<br>
in  situ  reaction between a  polyisocyanate and  triethanolamine in  a<br>
polymeric polyol (PIPA polyol) has been proposed in general terms.  The<br>
10 polymeric polyol may contain 5-50% by weight of dispersed polymer.<br>
In co-pending application PCT/EP98/0867 it has been proposed to lower<br>
the level of TDJ and PIPA polyol.<br>
EP 555721 discloses a process for preparing cold-cure, moulded flexible boam by reacting a poiyisocyanate oi the MDI-type in a one-shot process 15 with a polyol composition comprising 5-30% of a polyol having at least 50% by weight of oxyethylene groups and an OH value of less than 150. The foams show a high resilience (about 65%) only at elevated density (at least about 55%).<br>
However, there remains room for improvement. In particular there is a 20 need for further reduction of the density, while maintaining or even improving other physical properties, like elongation, tear strength, dry compression set and hysteresis loss, of moulded foams which have been made according to the one-shot process using water as the sole blowing agent and MDI-type polyisocyanate as the polyisocyanate.<br>
25 Also, foams made in a closed mould, which foams are to be used as<br><br><br>
cushioning material in automotive seating, could be improved as to resilience at low density, especially in the case of TDI-free MDI based foams.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that this may be achieved by the process 5  according to the present invention.<br>
The present invention is concerned with a process for preparing a flexible polyurethane foam at an NCO index of 70-120 by reacting in a closed mould<br>
a)   a  polyisocyanate  composition consisting  of diphenylmethane<br>
10	diisocyanate and homologues thereof having an isocyanate<br>
functionality of 3 or more, the amount of diphenylmethane<br>
diisocyanate being 81  to 100% by weight calculated on tne<br>
amount of diphenylmethane diisocyanates and homologues,<br>
and the diphenylmethane diisocyanate comprising 40-60% by<br>
15	weight,   calculated   on  the  weight  of  this  diphenylmethane<br>
diisocyanate, of diphenylmethane diisocyanate containing at<br>
least one NCO group in the ortho position, and the amount of<br>
homologues having an isocyanate functionality of 3 or more<br>
being 19-0% by weight, and<br>
20	b)   a polyol composition comprising<br>
1)   a polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene-polyol, having an average<br>
nominal hydroxyl functionality of 2-6 , an average equivalent<br>
weight of 1000-4000 and containing  10-25% by weight of<br>
oxyethylene groups;<br>
25	2)   4 to 8 parts by weight of water as the sole blowing agent or<br>
optionally together with C02 as the sole blowing agents; and<br><br>
3)   2 to 20, preferably 2 to 10 parts by weight of a polyether polyol<br>
having an average nominal hydroxyl functionality of 2-6, an<br>
average equivalent weight of 200-600 and containing at least<br>
60% by weight of oxyethylene groups; and optionally<br>
5	4)   up to 30 and preferably 4-25 parts by weight of particulate<br>
material which is dispersed in said polyol composition; the amounts of b2) to b4) being calculated per 100 parts by weight of b1); and 5)   optionally auxiliaries and additives known per se.<br>
10 in the context of the present   application   the following terms have the following meaning :<br>
1)  isocyanate index or NCO index or index :<br>
the  ratio of NCO-groups  over  isocyanate-reactive hydrogen  atoms<br>
present in a fonaciation given as a percentage ,<br>
15	[NCO]x100	(%;<br>
[active hydrogen]<br>
In other words the NCO-index expresses the percentage of isocyanate actually used in a formulation with respect to the amount of isocyanate theoretically required for reacting with the amount of isocyanate-reactive 20 hydrogen used in a formulation.<br>
It should be observed that the isocyanate index as used herein is considered from the point of view of the actual foaming process involving the isocyanate ingredient and the isocyanate-reactive ingredients. Any isocyanate groups consumed in a prefiminary step to produce the 25 semi-prepolymer   or   other   modified   polyisocyanates   or   any   active<br><br>
i<br>
hydrogens reacted with isocyanate to produce modified polyols or polyamines, are not taken into account in the calculation of the isocyanate index. Only the free isocyanate groups and the free isocyanate-reactive hydrogens (including those of the water) present at the actual foaming 5 stage are taken into account.<br>
2)	The expression "isocyanate-reactive hydrogen atoms" as used herein<br>
for the purpose of calculating the isocyanate index refers to the total of<br>
hydroxy! and amine hydrogen atoms present in the reactive compositions<br>
in the form of polyols, polyamines and/or water; this means that for the<br>
10 purpose of calculating the isocyanate index at the actual foaming process one hydroxyl group is considered to comprise one reactive hydrogen and one water molecule is considered to comprise two active hydrogens.<br>
3)	Reaction system : a combination of components wherein the<br>
polyisocyanate  component  is  kept  in   a  container  separate  from  the<br>
15 isocyanate-reactive components.<br>
4)	The expression "polyurethane foam" as used herein generally refers to<br>
cellular products as obtained by reacting polyisocyanates with<br>
isocyanate-reactive hydrogen containing compounds, using foaming<br>
agents, and in particular includes cellular products obtained with water as<br>
20 reactive foaming agent (involving a reaction of water with isocyanate groups yielding urea linkages and carbon dioxide and producing polyurea-urethane foams).<br>
5)	The term "average nominal hydroxyl functionality" is used herein to<br>
indicate the number average functionality (number of hydroxyl groups per<br>
25 molecule) of the polyol composition on the assumption that this is the<br><br>
number average functionality (number of activehydrogen atoms per molecule) of the initiator(s) used in their preparation although in practice it will often be somewhat less because of some terminal unsaturation. The term "equivalent weight" refers to the molecular weight per isocyanate 5 reactive hydrogen atom in the molecule.<br>
6)	The word "average" refers to number average.<br>
7)	The wording "one shot", "prepolymer" or "quasi-prepolymer" refer to commonly known ways of reacting the ingredients to prepare the foam wherein all polyol b1 is reacted with polyisocyanate in the presence of<br>
10 water; or where a pre-reaction between this polyol and the polyisocyanate takes place, to a greater or lesser extent.<br>
The diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) used may be selected from isomeric mixtures of 4,4'-1ViDi and 2,4'-MDi and less than 10% by weigh; of 2,2'-MDI having the aforementioned amount of 40-60% by weight cf 15 2,4'-MDIand2,2'-MDI.<br>
The homologues having an isocyanate functionality of 3 or more are contained in so-called polymeric or crude MDI.<br>
Polymeric or crude  MDI  comprise  MDI  and  homologues  having  an isocyanate functionality of 3 or more and are well known in the art. They 20 are made by the phosgenation of a mixture of polyamines obtained by the acid condensation of aniline and formaldehyde.<br>
The manufacture of both the polyamine mixtures and the polyisocyanate mixtures is well known. The condensation of aniline with formaldehyde in the presence of strong acids such as hydrochloric acid gives a reaction<br><br><br>
product containing diaminodiphenylmethane together with polymethylene<br>
polyphenylene polyamines of higher functionality, the precise composition<br>
depending in known manner inter alia on the aniline/formaldehyde ratio.<br>
The polyisocyanates are made by phosgenation of thepolyamine mixtures<br>
5 and the various proportions of diamines, triamines and higher polyamines<br>
give rise to related proportions of diisocyanates, triisocyanates and higher<br>
polyisocyanates.   The relative proportions of diisocyanate, triisocyanate<br>
and higher polyisocyanates in such crude or polymeric MDI compositions<br>
determine the  average functionality of the  compositions, that is the<br>
10 average number of isocyanate groups per molecule.    By varying the<br>
proportions   of   starting   materials,   the   average   functionality   of   the<br>
polyisocyanate compositions can be varied from little more than 2 to 3 or<br>
even higher.   In practice, however, the   average isocyanate functionality<br>
preferably ranges r'rom 2.3-2.8.     The NCO value oi these polymeric or<br>
15 crude MDIs is at least 30% by weight.    The polymeric or crude MDI<br>
contain      diphenylmethane      diisocyanate,      the      remainder     being<br>
polymethylene polyphenylene polyisocyanates of functionality greater than<br>
two  together  with  by-products  formed   in  the   manufacture  of such<br>
polyisocyanates by phosgenation.<br>
20 The polyisocyanate compositions used in the process according to the present invention and which contain homologues are made by mixing an appropriate amount of MDI and polymeric or crude MDI. For example such polyisocyanates may be made by mixing Suprasec Ml 50, containing about 50% by weight of 4,4'-MDI and about 50% w of 2/T-MDI and<br>
25 2,2'-MDI and Suprasec 2185, a polymeric MDI having an NCO value of 30.7% by weight; comprising about 38% by weight of diisocyanate, the remainder being homologues having an isocyanate functionality of 3 or more; 6% of the diisocyanates being 2,4'- and 2,2'-MDI. Per 100 parts of<br><br>
polyisocyanate composition the amount of Suprasec Ml 50 would be about 70-100 parts and preferably 76-92 parts and the amount of Suprasec 2185 would be about 30-0 parts and preferably 24-8 parts. It is to be noted that the polymeric or crude MDI may contain 2,4'-MDI and 5 2,2'-MDI and that the range of ortho NCO substituted MDI in the diphenyimethane diisocyanate in polyisocyanate composition a) is the totality of the 2,2'- and 2,4'-MDI in the MDI and in the polymeric or crude MDI.<br>
The functionality is preferably below 2.15.    Also, the ortho content is 10 preferably above 45%.  No other polyisocyanates are used in the process according to the present invention.<br>
The  total  amount  of  polymeric  or crude  MDI   used   to  prepare  the<br>
polyisocyanate composition should be such that the amount of diphenylmethane diisocyanate and the amount of ortho-substituted 15 diisocyanate remains within the ranges given above. Those skilled in the art will be able to calculate the amount easily depending on the chosen MDI and the polymeric or crude MDI, certainly in the light of the examples and in view of the above explanation.<br>
The polyisocyanate composition a) is made by simple mixing of the MDI 20 and the crude or polymeric MDI in any order.<br>
Polyether polyols b1) which may be used include products obtained by the polymerisation of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide in the presence, where necessary, of polyfunctional initiators. Suitable initiator compounds contain a plurality of active hydrogen atoms and include water, butanediol, 25 ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, dipropylene   glycol,    ethanolamine,    diethanolamine,    triethanolamine,<br><br><br>
toluene diamine, diethyl toluene diamine, cyclohexane diamine, cyclohexane dimethanol, glycerol, trimethylolpropane and 1,2,6-hexanetriol. Mixtures of initiators and/or cyclic oxides may be used. The polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene poiyols are obtained by the 5 simultaneous or sequential addition of ethylene and propylene oxides to initiators as fully described in the prior art. Random copolymers, block copolymers and combinations thereof may be used having the indicated amount of oxyethylene groups in particular those having at least part and preferably all of the oxyethylene groups at the end of the polymer chain 10 (capped or tipped). Mixtures of the said poiyols can be particularly useful.<br>
Most preferred are polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene poiyols having an average nominal functionality of 2-4 and most preferably of 3 and an<br>
oxyethylene   content   of   10-25%   by   weight,   preferably   having   the oxyethylene groups at the end of the polymer chains.<br>
15 During the last years several methods have been described to prepare polyether poiyols having a low level of unsaturation. These developments have made it possible to use polyether poiyols at the higher end of the molecular weight range since much poiyols can now be prepared with an acceptably low level of unsaturation.  According to the present invention<br>
20 poiyols having a low level of unsaturation jnay be used as well.      In particular such high molecular weight poiyols  having a  low level of unsaturation may be used for preparing flexible foams having a high ball rebound. Water is used as sole blowing agent or together with C02.  The C02 may<br>
25 be added in the gaseous, the liquid or the supercritical state to the polyisocyanate composition or the polyol composition or to the mixing head or mixing device where these compositions are mixed. The amount<br><br>
of CO2 is such so as to obtain foams having the density as described hereinafter.<br>
The polyols b3) used in polyol composition b) may be selected from the polyether polyol mentioned for b1) with the proviso that the equivalent 5 weight is 2DD-5DD and the oxyethylene content is at least 6D% by weight. Most preferred polyols are polyoxyethylene polyols having an equivalent weight of 200-500, especially 200-350.<br>
The particule material is any material present as a dispersion in the polyol. This material is usually a polymeric material; the polyol is a 10 polymer-modified polyol. Various embodiments are known; for example SAN-modified polyols can be used. Preferably the polymer-modified polyol is a polyisocyanate polyaddition (PIPA) polyol.<br>
Preferably  the  paniculate   material  b4    is  one   reaction   product  of  a<br>
compound   having   a   plurality   of   hydroxyl-,   primary   amine-   and/or<br>
15 secondary amine groups and having an equivalent weight of up to 400<br>
and   preferably  of up  to  200   (hereinafter   called   coreactant)   and   a<br>
polyisocyanate and which is dispersed in a polyol is generally known as<br>
such in the art, like e.g.   a PIPA polyol.   Such PIPA polyols have been<br>
described in the prior art extensively : see e.g. GB 2072204, US 4452923,<br>
20 EP 418039 and WO 94/12533.    Such PIPA polyols are commercially<br>
available : e.g. Daltocel XF 417 or 517 from Imperial Chemical Industries<br>
PLC , Daltocel is a trademark of ICI. The particulate material which is the<br>
reaction product of a polyisocyanate and the coreactant may be prepared<br>
in ways described in the above prior art.    The content of particulate<br>
25 materials may vary within the disclosed ranges.<br><br><br>
Usually the particulate material is prepared in polyol b1) by adding the coreactant to polyol b1) followed by the addition of the polyisocyanate. The amount of coreactant and polyisocyanate depends on the desired amount of particulate material dispersed in the polyol. If desired, loadings 5 of the dispersed material higher than those specified hereinbefore may be made followed by dilution with polyol b1) to the desired amount. When desired, special addition schemes of the coreactant and the polyisocyanate may be employed as disclosed in EP 418039 and WO 94/125333. The relative amount of coreactant and polyisocyanate is 10 generally chosen in such a way that the number of hydrogen atoms in the coreactant capable of reacting with the polyisocyanate exceeds the number of isocyanate groups.<br>
The polyisocyanate used in making the particulate material is any organic compound having at/feat |wo, preferably 2 to 4 isocyanate groups per<br>
15 molecule. The polyisocyanate may be aliphatic, aromatic or cycloaliphatic, although aromatic types are preferred due to their desirable properties and reactivity. Representative of these types are diisocyanates such as m- or p-phenyl diisocyanate, toluene-2,4-diisocyanate, toluene-2,6-diisocyanate, hexamethylene- 1,6-diisocyanate,   tetramethylene-<br>
20 1,4-diisocyanate, cyclohexane-1,4, diisocyanate, hexahydrotoluene diisocyanate (and isomers), naphtylene-1,5,-diisocyanate, 1-methylphenyl-2, 4-phenyldiisocyanate, diphenylmethane-4,4'-diisocyanate, di-phenylmethane-2,4'-diisocyanate, 4,4'-biphenylenediisocyanate, 3,3'-dimethoxy- 4,4'-biphenylenediisocyanate and<br>
25 3,3'-dimethyldiphenylpropane-4,4'-diisocyanate; triisocyanates such as toluene-2,4,6-triisocyanate and tetraisocyanates such as 4,4'-dimethyldiphenylmethane-2,2' 5,5'-tetraisocyanate, and other polyisocyanates such as the diverse polymethylene-<br><br><br>
polyphenylpolyisocyanates (polymeric or crude MDI).<br>
The coreactant is a material having a plurality of -OH, &gt;NH and/or-NH2 groups and an equivalent weight per active hydrogen atom of up to 400, preferably up to 200.  Since the coreactant reacts with the polyisocyanate<br>
5 in situ in the polyol, it is also preferred that the coreactant be more reactive with the polyisocyanate than the polyol. Preferred coreactants are alkanolamines, low equivalent weight amine-initiated polyether polyols, alkylene oxide, acrylonitrile, or acrylic ester adducts of amines, primary amines, secondary amines, hydrazines, dihydrazides, urea, ammonia,<br>
10 Mannich   condensates,    low    equivalent   weight    hydroxyl-terminated compounds    such    as    ethylene    glycol,    glycerine,    glycol    ethers, pentaerythritol,  aminobenzenes,   or  mixtures  thereof.     Of these,   the alkanolamines are most preferred. Suitable alkanolamines include mon-, di- and trialkanolsmines, particularly<br>
15 those wherein the alkanol groups have from 2 to 6, prefebly 2 to 3 carbon atoms. The mono- and dia'kanolamines may also have a single N-alkyl substituent, preferably having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Preferred among these are monethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, N-methylethanolamine, N-ethylethanolamine,<br>
20 N-butyl-ethanolamine, N-methyldiethanolamine, diisopropanolamine, triiso- propanolamine, N-methylisopropanolamine, N-ethylisopropanolamine, and N-propylisopropanolamine.<br>
Suitable primary and/or secondary amines include polyhydric aliphatic, arylaliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic amines including, for example, 25 ethylene diamine, 1,2- and 1,3-propylene diamine, tetramethylene diamine, hexamethylene diamine, dodecamethylene diamine, trimethyldiaminohexane, N,N'-dimethylethylenediamine, higher<br><br><br>
homologues of ethylene diamine such as diethylene triamine, triethylenetetramine and tetraethylenepentamine, homologues of propylene diamine, 4-aminobenzylamine, 4-aminophenylethylamine, piperazine, N.N'-bisaminoethyldipropylene triamine, and 1-amino-3,3,5-5 trimethyl-5-aminomethylcyclohexane.<br>
Suitable hydrazines include hydrazine itself and monosubstituted or N.N'-disubstitued hydrazines having substituent groups such as C1-C6 alkyl, cyclohexyl or phenyl groups. Hydrazine itself is preferred among these.<br>
10 Suitable hydrazides include the hydrazides of muitifunctionalcarboxylic acids such as carbonic acid, oxalic acid, rnalonic acid, succinic acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, azelaic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, phthalic acid, isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid, and the esters of a hydrazine monocarboxylic acid with dihydric or polyhydric alcohols and phenols.<br>
15 These hydrazides preferably have a molecular weight of from 90 to 1000. The reactants are advantageously mixed at any temperature at which the mixture is a liquid and at which the reactants do not degrade, but are preferably mixed at 0 to 170°C, more preferably 15 to 70°C. The isocyanate and coreactant are advantageously mixed with stirring, in order 20 to promote the formation of a plurality of small particles. Usually, rapid agitation is desired to optimize particle size and minimize the viscosity of the resulting dispersion. The process can be conducted batch-wise or continuously, as described in US patent No 4,374,209.<br>
The reaction between the polyisocyanate and the coreactant is often<br>
25 exothermic, and proceeds rapidly, being essentially completed in most<br>
cases in 1 minute to 3 hours, preferably 1 to 30 minutes, although this<br><br><br>
depends somewhat on the choice of polyisocyanate and coreactant, the batch size and initial temperature. Agitation is preferably effected throughout the reaction period.<br>
if desired, a catalyst for the reaction between the polyisocyanate and the<br>
5 coreactant may be used to accelerate the reaction.    Suitable catalysts<br>
include these described below with respect to the use of this dispersion to<br>
prepare polyurethanes, with the organotin catalysts being preferred.  The<br>
amount of catalyst is advantageously up to 1 weight percent based on<br>
polyol, preferably up to 0.1 weight percent and more preferably up to 0.05<br>
10 weight percent.  However, the catalyst may not be necessary, particularly<br>
with the more reactive coreactants.<br>
Once the polyol with the dispersed particulate materia! has been prepared<br>
the polycl composition b) is prepared by adding the water and polyol b3)<br>
ana   mixing.     Althougn   not   preferrec,   the  ccnstiburers of the polol<br>
15 composition may be led to the mixing device where ney are combined<br>
with the polyisocyanate independently from each other.<br>
It will be appreciated that the PIPA polyol is typically of the same nature of<br>
polyol b1); these two polyols may be different or identical.  Polyol b1) may<br>
thus be a mixture, as will be understood by the skilled man.<br>
20 To this polyol composition b) additives and auxiliaries known per se may<br>
be added, like catalysts which enhance the formation of urethane and<br>
urea bonds (e.g. tertiary amine and organo tin catalysts), chain extenders<br>
and cross-linkers having an equivalent weight of 31 to less than 200 and<br>
having  2-8  isocyanate-reactive   hydrogen   atoms   (e.g.   ethanolamine,<br>
25 diethanolamine,   triethanolamine,   ethylene   glycol,   diethylene   glycol,<br>
triethylene  glycol,   propylene   glycol,   dipropylene   glycol,   butanediol,<br>
glycerol,     trimethylolpropane,      pentaerythritol,      sorbitol,     sucrose,<br><br><br>
polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight less than 400, toluene diamine, diethyl toluene diamine, cyclohexane diamine, phenylene diamine, diphenylmethane diamine, alkylated diphenylmethane diamine and ethylene diamine), surfactants, stabilizers, flame retardants, fillers, 5 anti-oxidants, anti-microbial agents and colorants.<br>
The foams are made by combining and mixing the polyisocyanate and polyol compositions a) and b) and allowing the mixture to react in a closed mould. The relative amounts will depend on the desired index which may vary from 70-120 and can be easily calculated by those skilled in the art 10 from a selected polyisocyanate and polyol composition. A further advantage of the use of the polyisocyanate composition a) and the polyol composition b) is that in order to operate at an index of 70-120 the relative amounts of the compositions do not differ too much, which allows for easy metering and mixing of the compositions.<br>
15 The process may be used to make moulded foams including using the so-called foam-in-fabric and pour-in-place applications. One-shot, prepolymer or quasi-prepolymer processes can be used.<br>
The flexible foams prepared according to the present invention have a free rise density of 20-50 kg/m3 (ISO 845) especially 35-45 kg/m3 and may 20 be used in mattresses, cushions, furniture seating and automotive seating and especially in automotive seat-backs.<br>
