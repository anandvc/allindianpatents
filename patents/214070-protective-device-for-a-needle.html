				<td>Protective device for a needle.<br>
This invention is situated within the technical field of<br>
medical and surgical products and relates to a protective<br>
device for a needle.<br>
In first instance, the invention is intended to be used in<br>
combination with a catheter introducing needle or cannula<br>
needle, however, in general it is not excluded to use it in<br>
combination with other types of surgical needles.<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to a protective<br>
device which is capable of avoiding accidental pricking or<br>
wounds being inflicted on health staff during the use of<br>
the needles concerned.<br>
In case of a cannula needle assembly the operator is<br>
inserting the cannula and the needle which is provided in<br>
this cannula, by perforating the skin near the patient"s<br>
vein or artery and introducing the needle and cannula with<br>
their tip into said vein or artery. Once the needle is<br>
inserted, the cannula remains in position, partially within<br>
the vein, while the needle, which has fulfilled its<br>
function, is taken out by the operator.<br>
This is the phase during which the sharp point of the<br>
extracted needle is dangerously exposed, with a high risk<br>
of pricking or wounding the operator.<br>
The operation involving replacing the needle into a<br>
protective hood is equally dangerous for the operator<br>
replacing it, as numerous specialised studies have shown<br>
statistically.<br><br>
In order to avoid this problem and to guarantee the safety<br>
of health staff during their activity, various kinds of<br>
protection devices applicable to cannula needles have been<br>
developped.<br>
Safety cannula needle assemblies are known, having a<br>
protective device allowing that the needle can be retracted<br>
within a protective element, which may be part of the<br>
assembly itself, whereby the withdrawal is obtained by<br>
activating a lever which pushes the needle correspondingly<br>
into the protective element, or manually, by manipulating<br>
an external handle connected to the needle which can slide<br>
along the axis of the protective element, thereby<br>
permitting withdrawal of the needle itself.<br>
The main disadvantage of these devices, which are already<br>
known to the profession, is the considerable volume of the<br>
protective element which may make it laborious and<br>
difficult for the operator to use these cannula needles,<br>
resulting in that this known system is less practical and<br>
versatile.<br>
Another disadvantage of these protective devices, which are<br>
already known to the profession, is not only that they are<br>
complicated or composed of a large number of parts, but<br>
also that they entail risks of not working properly and<br>
that high production costs are involved in producing each<br>
of the composing parts and in assembling them.<br>
A further disadvantage is that extra operations are<br>
necessary compared to unprotected devices, entailing the<br>
risk of omissions or wrongly executed operations by the<br>
operator.<br><br>
The profession is also acquainted with protective devices<br>
for cannula needles involving the use of a pair of rings<br>
linked by a flexible wire. The first ring is fixed to the<br>
base of the needle, while the second is fixed to the end of<br>
the cannula and is intended to guide extraction of the<br>
needle and to contain its point. The mechanism makes the<br>
needle slide, during its extraction, through the axial<br>
forum of the second ring until its further extraction is<br>
stopped by the fixed length of flexible wire. Hereby, the<br>
needle arrives with its needle point into one of the rings.<br>
The needle, fitted into the ring with its point protected,<br>
can be safely pulled out of the cannula with the entire<br>
device comprising the two rings and the wire.<br>
The main disadvantage of this device is the considerable<br>
encum brance entailed by the two protective rings and above<br>
all by the flexible wire, which can make it laborious and<br>
difficult to use the cannula needle, reducing its<br>
functional scope.<br>
A further disadvantage of these rings and in general of all<br>
the devices known to the profession, is that the patient"s<br>
body fluids, and sometimes drugs, which may be deposited on<br>
the needle as drops or as an adhesive covering, are still<br>
accessible and/or that there still is a considerable risk<br>
that these fluids or drugs leave the protective device.<br>
Shocks may cause them to squirt on the bare skin or into<br>
the eyes of the operators or of others standing in the<br>
proximity thereof, entailing the risk of infection or<br>
contamination.<br>
The main object of this invention is to provide a<br>
protective device for needles, more particularly for<br>
cannula needles, which allows to considerably reduce the<br><br>
risk of contact with patient"s body fluids or with drugs on<br>
the needle, and which prevents that an accidental pricking<br>
and the causing of wounds may happen, all this by means of<br>
a device which is compact, resulting in that it is also<br>
easy to use and in that it is very versatile.<br>
A further aim is to provide a protective device that is<br>
easy to construct and assemble and hence not expensive.<br>
Furthermore, this protective device ensures maximum<br>
protection for the operator during extraction of the needle<br>
from the cannula.<br>
To this end, the invention relates to a protective device<br>
for a needle, more particularly for a catheter introducing<br>
needle or so-called cannula needle, whereby this protective<br>
device comprises protective means which slidably cooperate<br>
with the needle, which device is characterized in that said<br>
protective means comprise a combination of at least, on one<br>
hand, safety means having at least one part which, upon<br>
retraction of the needle through the protective means, is<br>
placed in front of the needle point and prevents the re-use<br>
of the needle, and, on the other hand, blocking means which<br>
cooperate with the safety means and which, when the<br>
protective device passes from a non-operative state into an<br>
operative state, release said safety means from a blocked<br>
position into an unblocked position.<br>
The fact that, according to the invention, a combination is<br>
made of safety means with blocking means, which<br>
automatically release the safety means from a blocked into<br>
an unblocked position, offers the advantage that the device<br>
functions very efficiently, as will be clear from the<br>
following detailed description.<br><br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the safety means and<br>
the blocking means are configured in such a manner that,<br>
upon retraction of the needle, the safety means, more<br>
particularly the part or parts which are placed in front of<br>
the needle point, remain at a distance from the needle<br>
during the entire retraction thereof. In other words,<br>
during the complete retraction, there is no contact<br>
between, on the one hand, the safety means, more<br>
particularly said safety tongue or safety tongues, and, on<br>
the other hand, the needle. As a result thereof, the safety<br>
means, more particularly said tongues, will never urge<br>
fluids adhered to the needle towards the needle point and<br>
off the needle point. In this manner, it is avoided that<br>
fluids are scraped completely from the needle and can<br>
consequently leave the protective device.<br>
In the most preferred embodiment, said blocking means are<br>
shiftable in respect to the safety means, such that, by<br>
means of a shifting movement of the blocking means, the<br>
safety means are released from a blocked position into an<br>
unblocked position, whereby said blocking means cooperate<br>
with the needle in such a manner that a displacement and<br>
retraction of the needle also causes the above shifting<br>
movement of the blocking means. In this way, with a minimum<br>
of constructive parts, a device is offered which can be<br>
actuated automatically, just by the retraction of the<br>
needle.<br>
In a practical embodiment, the blocking means substantially<br>
consist of a sliding ring located around the needle.<br>
Preferably, the abovesaid part or parts are elastically<br>
bendable and consist of safety tongues, such that these<br>
parts are automatically urged into the path of the needle<br><br>
upon retraction of the latter. In such case, the blocking<br>
means can be formed of an element, such as a ring, which in<br>
the non-operative state of the protective device, keeps<br>
said parts out of the path of the needle.<br>
Further, the device is preferably characterized in that the<br>
protective means and the needle comprise stopping means,<br>
acting as abutment means between the protective means and<br>
the needle, which define an end position when retracting<br>
the needle, such that the needle cannot leave the<br>
protective means.<br>
According to a further important preferred feature, the<br>
protective device is provided with scraping means to dry<br>
the needle when the device itself passes from the<br>
non-operative state to the operative state. These scraping<br>
means, which preferably consist of an O—ring, considerably<br>
improve the safety of the device, as will become clear from<br>
the further description.<br>
Further, it is preferred that said protective means are<br>
provided with a rear wall having a rear side, whereby the<br>
scraping means in their outermost position remain located<br>
at a distance from the rear side of said rear wall. In<br>
respect to this, it should be noted that fluids, which are<br>
scraped or wiped from the needle, are collected in front of<br>
the scraping means. At the end, it is never excluded that<br>
these fluids may penetrate in between the scraping means<br>
and the needle surface by means of a pumping effect which<br>
may be created when moving the needle sidewards in respect<br>
to the scraping means. Due to this pumping effect, some<br>
fluid may arrive at the rear side of the scraping means. By<br>
preserving a distance between this rear side and the rear<br>
side of the rear wall, it is impossible that the operator<br><br>
which handles the device can come into contact with the<br>
fluid in question.<br>
It is clear that the fact that the safety tongues do not<br>
come into contact with the needle during the entire<br>
retraction of the needle, is also advantageous in other<br>
protective devices for needles. Therefore, according to a<br>
second aspect, the invention also relates to a protective<br>
device for a needle, more particularly for a catheter<br>
introducing needle, whereby this protective device<br>
comprises protective means which slidably cooperate with<br>
the needle, characterized in that said protective means<br>
comprise one or more safety tongues which upon retraction<br>
of the needle are automatically positioned in front of the<br>
needle point, thereby preventing the needle from being<br>
re-used, whereby these tongues upon the complete retraction<br>
movement of the needle remain at a distance from the needle.<br>
Also the abovesaid feature that scraping means, more<br>
particularly a scraping ring is used which for all<br>
conditions remain at a distance from the rear side or the<br>
rear wall of the protective device can be used in<br>
combination with other types of protective devices, which<br>
must not necessarily be equipped with blocking means.<br>
Therefore, according to a third aspect, the invention also<br>
relates to a protective device for a needle, more<br>
particularly for a catheter introducing needle, whereby<br>
this protective device comprises a housing which slidably<br>
cooperates with the needle such that the needle can be<br>
retracted upto a position in which the needle point is<br>
located in said housing, characterized in that said<br>
protective device comprises a scraping ring which<br>
cooperates with the needle, whereby this scraping ring is<br><br>
located inside the housing, at a distance from the rear<br>
side of the rear wall of said housing.<br>
It is clear that the invention also relates to needles and<br>
safety cannula needle assemblies which are provided with a<br>
protective device of the invention.<br>
Other features will become clear from the following<br>
detailed description and the appended claims.<br>
In order to better explain the features of the present<br>
invention, hereafter, several preferred embodiments are<br>
described as examples without being limitative, with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>

embodiment of the invention, for the non-operative and<br>
operative state respectively of the protection device;<br>
figures 11 and 12 represent a still further<br>
alternative embodiment of the invention, for the<br>
non—operative state and the state during retraction of<br>
the needle, respectively;<br>
figure 13 represents a perspective view of the part<br>
which in figure 11 is indicated by F13.<br>
With reference to figures 1 to 6, reference 1 in general<br>
indicates a protective device for a cannula needle 2, which<br>
cannula needle 2, together with the cannula 3, forms a<br>
complete cannula needle assembly 4.<br>
With the cannula needle 2, the complete part is meant which<br>
is formed by the actual needle 5 and a needle hub 6 in<br>
which this needle 5 is attached. The needle 5 fits to the<br>
cannula 3 and is preferably hollow. The inner channel 7 is<br>
in connection with an opening 8 in the needle hub 6, which/<br>
for example allows a connection with a so-called flash<br>
chamber, or with any other accessory. As represented, the<br>
needle hub 6 may be provided with a support 9.<br>
The cannula 3 is carried out in a conventional manner and<br>
mainly consists of an elongated hollow front portion 10,<br>
which is intended to be partly introduced in a vein of the<br>
patient and which furthermore comprises a rear portion 11<br>
acting as a cannula hub which is provided with an entrance<br>
opening 12 for introducing the needle 5 into the cannula 3.<br>
The entrance opening 12 is also intended to be coupled to a<br><br>
tube for fluid supply or the like after retraction of the<br>
needle 5. As shown, the cannula 3 may be provided with one<br>
or more additional entrance openings 13. Of course, the<br>
cannula 3 may also be used for introducing other medical or<br>
surgical substances or elements, for example, for<br>
introducing a catheter by means of a vein, artery or the<br>
like into a patient"s body.<br>
The protective device 1 substantially consists of, on the<br>
one hand, protective means, generally indicated by<br>
reference 14, which slidably fit onto the needle 5, and, on<br>
the other hand, stopping means 15, acting as abutment means<br>
between the protective means 14 and the needle 5, which<br>
abutment means define an end position when retracting the<br>
needle 5 through the protective means 14.<br>
Said protective means 14 comprise, on the one hand, safety<br>
means 16 having at least one part, in this case, a safety<br>
tongue 17, which, upon retraction of the needle 5, is<br>
placed in front of the point 18 of the needle 5, such as to<br>
prevent the re—use of this needle and, on the other hand,<br>
blocking means 19 which cooperate with the safety means 16<br>
and which, when the protective device passes from a<br>
non-operative state A into an operative state B, release<br>
said safety means 16 from a blocked position into an<br>
unblocked position, as described in detail in the following.<br>
As shown, the safety means 16 and the blocking means 19 are<br>
preferably incorporated in a hollow body or housing 20<br>
having a side wall 21 and two opposed end walls 22-23,<br>
which are each provided with a passage opening 24-25 for<br>
the needle 5.<br><br>
The safety tongue 17 consists of an elastically bendable<br>
lip, which in this case forms one part with the end wall<br>
22, and which is configured and arranged in such a manner<br>
that, in its free position, it extends through the path of<br>
the needle 5, preferably in an oblique manner, as shown in<br>
figures 4 to 6.<br>
The blocking means 19 comprise an element which is<br>
shiftably fitted in the hollow body 20, which element, in<br>
the represented example, consists of a ring 26 composed of<br>
an inner cylindrical ring part 27 and an outer cylindrical<br>
ring part 28 fixedly connected to each other. The outer<br>
cylindrical ring part precisely fits into the hollow body<br>
20.<br>
The ring 26 is configured such that, in the non-operative<br>
state A of the protection device 1, in which the needle 5<br>
is completely inserted into the cannula 3, the ring 26<br>
cooperates with the safety tongue 17 such that the latter<br>
is bent outwardly, in an open position S, in which this<br>
tongue 17 is not interfering with the needle 5. Hereby, as<br>
shown in figures 1 and 2, the tongue 17 and the ring 26,<br>
more particularly the outer ring part 28, are slightly<br>
hooking behind each other, by means of a recess 29 in the<br>
free end of the tongue 17 and a collar 30 at the front<br>
outer end of said ring part 28.<br>
The above mentioned stopping means 15 consist of abutment<br>
parts which are provided at the needle 5 and at the<br>
protective means 14, respectively. In the embodiment of<br>
figures 1 to 6, these abutment parts are formed by an<br>
annular groove 31 nearby the point of the needle 5 and<br>
retaining means consisting of strips or fins 32 directed<br>
towards the axis of the ring 26 and inclined in the<br><br>
direction opposite to the extraction direction of the<br>
needle 5.<br>
Furthermore, the protective: device 1 is provided with<br>
scraping means 33 to dry the needle 5 sliding through it,<br>
thereby freeing it from blood or other body fluids from the<br>
patient. These scraping means 33 consist of a ring,<br>
membrane or disk having a central opening, or the like,<br>
fitting with a certain tension around the needle 5, which<br>
ring, membrane or disk preferably is made of a flexible<br>
synthetic material. More particularly, these means are<br>
formed by an O-ring.<br>
The protective means 14, more particularly the housing 20,<br>
is carried out as an extension piece, which can be coupled<br>
to the catheter hub. To this end, the housing is provided<br>
with coupling means 34 at the end wall 22, allowing a<br>
releasable connection with said catheter hub, preferably by<br>
means of a snap connection. To this end, in the represented<br>
embodiment, said coupling means 34 comprise a number of<br>
elastically bendable fins 35, having locking portions 36<br>
which can cooperate with a collar 37 at the rear edge of<br>
the rear portion of the cannula 3.<br>
As shown, the needle hub preferably comprises at least one<br>
part 38 which, in the most forward position of the needle<br>
5, cooperates with the protective means 14, thereby<br>
preventing the blocking means 14 from carrying out a<br>
shifting movement from the non-operative position A to the<br>
operative position B. This is obtained in that this part 38<br>
extends through the opening 25 into the hollow body 20,<br>
thereby forming an obstacle for the displacement of the<br>
blocking means 14. More particularly, as shown in figure 2,<br>
said shifting is prevented in that the free end of part 38<br><br>
comes into contact with said inner ring part 27 and/or said<br>
fins 35.<br>
The functioning of the protective device 1 is substantially<br>
as described in the following.<br>
Once the needle 5 and the cannula 3 are inserted into a<br>
patient"s vein or artery, the needle 5 is retracted from<br>
the cannula 3, resulting in that the protective means 1 4<br>
are automatically activated and are put from a<br>
non-operative state A into an operative state B.<br>
In the beginning, in the non-operative state A, the part 38<br>
is in contact with the inner ring part 27, resulting in<br>
that the blocking means 14 are prevented from being<br>
displaced, resulting in that the safety tongue 17 is kept<br>
in the position, as shown in figures 1 and 2.<br>
When retracting the needle 5, first, this needle freely<br>
slides through the protective means 14. From the moment on<br>
that the annular groove 31 arrives at the height of the<br>
fins 32, these fins are elastically urged into the annular<br>
groove 31 , resulting in that the needle 5 cannot make any<br>
further sliding movement through the ring 26. As a<br>
consequence, the ring 26 is taken along with the movement<br>
of the needle 5, causing that the ring 26, in other words<br>
the blocking means 19, are freeing the tongue 17, which<br>
interposes itself between the passage opening 24 and the<br>
point 18 of the needle 5, corresponding to a state of<br>
release R.<br>
Upon further retraction, the ring 26 will contact the end<br>
wall 23, as shown in figure 5, and, as a consequence<br>
thereof, any further extraction movement of the needle 5<br><br>
from the protective means 14 is prevented. Hereafter, the<br>
cannula needle 2 can be disconnected from the cannula 3 by<br>
means of the releasable coupling means 34.<br>
In this way, in the operative state B, the point 18 of the<br>
needle 5 cannot come out of the protective means 14 because<br>
it is blocked, in the direction of the opening 25 by the<br>
activation of the stopping means 15, and in the opposite<br>
direction by the tongue 17 which is interposed between the<br>
needle point 18 and the opening 24.<br>
The protective means 14 are preferably configured in such a<br>
manner that any contact between the safety tongue 17 and<br>
the needle 5 is excluded for the complete retraction of the<br>
needle 5. In this way, it is excluded that the safety<br>
tongue 17 acts as a scraping element for the needle 5 and<br>
that, on the moment that the tongue 17 is released,- blood<br>
or other fluids are projected through the passage opening<br>
24 and possibly are contaminating this opening. In normal<br>
use, in the design of figures 1 to 6 there will be no<br>
contact between the tongue 17 and the needle point 18 on<br>
the moment that the tongue 17 bends back into its free<br>
position. However, in order to exclude any contact, the<br>
point 18 can be further shortened, as indicated in dashed<br>
line 39 in figure 3.<br>
The geometrical form and the inclination of the fins 32<br>
make it possible to transfer the needle 5 towards the<br>
cannula 3 during the phase of assembly of the cannula<br>
needle assembly 4. Also the blocking means 19 are<br>
advantageous during the assembly, as by means of these<br>
blocking means 19, the tongue 17 can be kept in an<br>
non-activated state, allowing the free passage of the<br>
needle 5 to the protective means 14.<br><br>
During the passage from the non-operative state A to the<br>
operative state B, the needle 5 slides through the scraping<br>
means 33 which dry it from the liquids that are adhered to<br>
this needle 5, thereby retaining these liquids in the<br>
hollow body 20. Hence, although the shaft of the needle 5<br>
is no longer sterile, a decisive reduction of any infective<br>
or toxic products adhered at the needle 5 takes place,<br>
thereby reducing the risk for anyone who might have to<br>
touch the shaft of the needle 5 with bare hands.<br>
Furthermore, although the hollow body 20 is not completely<br>
closed, the fluids retained in it by the scraping means 33<br>
are practically completely held inside, even if the needle<br>
5 were to undergo shocks or vibrations.<br>
In the embodiment of figures 1 to 6, the coupling means 34<br>
and the end wall 22 are made in one piece and together form<br>
a separate part which acts as a cover which is connected to<br>
the side wall 21 in any manner.<br>
According to a variant, the coupling means 34 may also be<br>
moulded in a single piece with the hollow body 20.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 show a second embodiment of the protective<br>
device 1 in which the safety means 16 consist of a pair of<br>
opposed elastically bendable safety tongues 40—41, facing<br>
each other and fixed to the end wall 23. The tongues 40-41<br>
have a different length and consist of an elastically<br>
bendable first portion 42 which substantially extends in<br>
lengthwise direction and, at the distal end of this first<br>
portion 42, a second portion 43 which is directed<br>
transversely or substantially transversely in respect to<br>
the first portion 42. The safety tongues 40-41 are<br>
configured such that by means of their elasticity, they are<br>
permanently urged towards a position in which the second<br><br>
portions 43 are located in the path followed by the needle<br>
5.<br>
The end wall 23 is carried out in the form of a flange.<br>
This flange, together with the tongues 40-41 form an<br>
insertion piece, which, by means of a snap coupling 44, is<br>
mounted into the hollow body 20.<br>
In this embodiment, the blocking means 19 consist of a ring<br>
45 which is located around the needle 5 and in between the<br>
tongues 40-41, such that these tongues 40-41 by means of<br>
said ring 45 can be kept in an open state S, as shown in<br>
figure 7.<br>
Similarly as in figures 1 to 6, the ring 45 is provided<br>
with fins 32.<br>
It should be noted that in figure 7 the configuration is<br>
chosen such that the tongues 40-41 are in contact with the<br>
ring 45, as well as in contact with the needle 5. Hereby,<br>
the tongues 40—41 are only in slight contact with the<br>
needle 5, resulting in that,, during the retraction of the<br>
needle 5, no important frictional forces have to be<br>
surmounted.<br>
It is clear that, according to alternative embodiments and<br>
dependent on the diameter of the ring 45 and/or the lengths<br>
of the second portions 43, there may or may not be a<br>
contact between the free ends of the tongues 40-41 and the<br>
needle 5.<br>
In fact, the first aim of the blocking means 19 is to keep<br>
the tongues 40-41 separated from each other when no needle<br>
5 is inserted in between, thereby allowing that, upon<br><br>
insertion of the needle 5 to the protective means 14, this<br>
needle 5 can be shifted through the hollow body 20.<br>
During the passage from the non-operative state A to the<br>
operative state B, the fins 32 engage in the annular groove<br>
31 of the needle 5 during the latter"s axial sliding,<br>
thereby causing the ring 45 to slide towards the end wall<br>
23. This sliding motion of the ring 45 permits the<br>
disengaging of the free ends of the tongues 40-41, so as to<br>
reach the state of release R, in which these free ends are<br>
curved towards each other, thus placing the tongues 40-41<br>
between the passage opening 24 and the needle point 18. The<br>
different lengths of the tongues 40-41 allow the respective<br>
free ends to overlap each other, preferably without causing<br>
any interference, thereby avoiding the possibility of the<br>
needle 5 coming out of the hollow body 20.<br>
Figures 9 and 10 show a further variant of the invention,<br>
the only difference with the embodiment of figures 7-8<br>
being that the ring 45 has no fins 32 and directly fits<br>
around the needle 5, whereas the stopping means 15 at the<br>
needle 5 consist of a ridge 46 or thickening nearby the<br>
needle point 18. In this way, the side 47 of the ring 45<br>
forms an abutment for the ridge 46.<br>
An advantage of this embodiment consists in the fact that<br>
the scraping means 33 and the abutment means cooperating<br>
with the ridge 46 are formed by one and the same part,<br>
namely said ring 45. Furthermore, this ring 45 also acts as<br>
blocking means 19, resulting in that it simultaneously<br>
fulfills three functions.<br>
Figures 11 and 12 relate to a further embodiment. An<br>
important difference with the embodiment of figures 9 and<br><br>
10 consists in that the tongues 40-41 and the ring 45 are<br>
dimensioned such that in the non-operative state A of the<br>
protective device 1 there is no contact between the tongues<br>
40—41 and the needle 5 and furthermore also during the<br>
entire retraction of the needle 5 no such contact takes<br>
place. Figure 12 shows an intermediate position, which<br>
demonstrates that the tongues 40-41 nicely close around the<br>
needle point 18, without touching the latter. As explained<br>
in respect to the embodiment of figures 1 to 6, this offers<br>
the advantage that the tongues 40-41 are not acting as<br>
scraping elements, resulting in that no drops of blood or<br>
other fluids are collected at these tongues 40-41, thereby<br>
avoiding that such drops are catapulted towards the passage<br>
opening 24.<br>
In all embodiments the needle hub 6 may be provided of one<br>
or more prolongated parts which at least partially surround<br>
the actual protective means 14, in other words surround the<br>
hollow body or housing 20. Such needle hub 6 is applied in<br>
the embodiment of figures 11 and 12 and is shown on itself<br>
in figure 13. More particularly, this needle hub 6<br>
comprises prolongations 48-49-50, respectively in the<br>
lateral and partially in the upper part thereof. This<br>
further improvement is intended to prevent the possibility<br>
that the operator can disconnect the cannula needle 2<br>
without activating the protective device 1.<br>
Preferably, the needle 5 is made of AISI 304 steel, and the<br>
protective means 14 and the cannula 3 of acetal resin or<br>
polypropylene or polyethylene.<br>
According to an important preferred aspect of the<br>
invention, which is mentioned in the introductory portion<br>
of the description, the scraping means comprise a scraping<br><br>
ring which cooperates with the needle 5, said scraping ring<br>
for all positions being located inside the housing at a<br>
distance from the rear side of the rear wall or end wall of<br>
said housing. In the previously described embodiments, this<br>
is demonstrated by means of the distance D which is<br>
indicated in the figures 5, 8 and 10.<br>
The main advantage of this invention is that it provides a<br>
protective device for a cannula needle to avoid the risk of<br>
contact with a patient"s body fluids or with drugs wetting<br>
the needle, and of accidental pricking and wounds, which<br>
device is very efficient in many aspects.<br>
The device is small and compact and thus easy to use and<br>
very versatile.<br>
Another advantage is that it provides a protective device<br>
that is simple to construct and assemble and is therefore<br>
economic.<br>
A further advantage is that it supplies a needle<br>
guaranteeing maximum protection for the operator during the<br>
operation of extracting the needle from the cannula.<br>
The present invention is in no way limited to the forms of<br>
embodiment described by way of example and represented in<br>
the figures, however such protective device, as well as<br>
cannula needle assemblies and needles provided with such<br>
protective device can be realized in various forms and<br>
dimensions without leaving the scope of the invention.<br><br>
