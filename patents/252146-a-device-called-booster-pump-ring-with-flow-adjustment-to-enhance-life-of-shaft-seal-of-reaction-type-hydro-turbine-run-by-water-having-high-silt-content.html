				<td>A DEVICE TO ENHANCE LIFE OF SHAFT SEALS OF REACTION<br>
TYPE HYDRO TURBINES RUN BY SILT LADEN WATER<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to device using a booster pump ring for<br>
enhancing the life of shaft seais of reaction type hydro turbines run<br>
by silt laden waters. More particularly, the invention relates to an<br>
improved method of sucking the clean filtered cooling water supplied<br>
to the shaft seal, boosting up the pressure in the pumping holes and<br>
discharging at a higher pressure against the Ingress of silt of the raw<br>
river water.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION WITH PRIOR ART<br>
DIFFICULTIES<br>
In a typical Francis type hydroelectric turbine, a shaft seal/shaft<br>
gland is a major item of the turbine which seals the turbine against<br><br>
3<br>
the high pressure river water which drives the turbine; thus<br>
preventing flooding and subsequent stoppage, of the turbine.<br>
The shaft seal is positioned above the turbine runner and shaft<br>
coupling on the top cover. It consists of a sealing element of rubber<br>
or carbon or asbestos- resin composite which presses against a<br>
cylindrical stainless steel sleeve which rotates along with the shaft.<br>
Filtered river water is forced through the sealing elements and the<br>
rotating sleeve to serve the following purposes.<br>
1.	To lubricate the rubbing surfaces.<br>
2.	To cool the surfaces heated up due to rubbing.<br>
3.	To keep the rubbing surfaces free of silt particles carried by the<br>
river water. This is achieved by forcing clean filtered water at a<br>
pressure higher than the pressure of water in the top cover below<br>
the shaft seal.<br><br>
4<br>
The quantity of clean filtered water required for the shaft seal is a<br>
very small percentage of the total requirement of cooling water<br>
required for generator air coolers, turbine and generator bearing<br>
coolers and the transformers. The pressure at which cooling water is<br>
to be supplied is decided by the pressure, which the copper alloy<br>
tubes of the coolers can safely sustain. This pressure is generally in<br>
the range of 5 kg/sq. cm.<br>
Since the cooling water to shaft seal is at a pressure of 5 kg/sq. cm,<br>
the pressure in the cop cover below the shaft seal should in no case<br>
exceed 5 kg/sq. cm to prevent flow reversal and ingress of siit<br>
particles into the shaft seal. This is achieved by suitably designing<br>
the labyrinths fitted on top cover and runner.<br>
In high head turbines operated by silt laden water, the labyrinths<br>
wear out faster, and the pressure in the top cover below the shaft<br>
seal soon exceeds the pressure of cooling water supply to shaft seal.<br>
This results in reversal of flow; causing ingress of silt particles into<br><br>
5<br>
the shaft seal, leading to wear of the sleeve fitted on the shaft.<br>
In the existing practice a rubber lip type shaft seal is used through<br>
which the sealing takes place by two layers of rubber lip seal with<br>
cooling water forced through between the rubber lip and the rotating<br>
shaft sleeve. The cooling water lubricates and cools the rubbing<br>
items viz. the rotating shaft sleeve and rubber lip seals. Also the<br>
cooling water being at a higher pressure than the pressure below the<br>
shaft seals in the top cover, it prevents the silty water from entering<br>
into the shaft seal, when the labyrinth is healthy.<br>
This arrangement of shaft seal functions satisfactorily when the<br>
peripheral rubbing velocity between the shaft sleeve and the rubber<br>
lips is low and the silt content in the river water is low.<br>
But this seal does not function satisfactorily when either the<br>
peripheral velocity is high or silt content is high.<br><br>
6<br>
In another prior art reference a carbon ring type shaft seal is used in<br>
which the sealing takes by two layers of carbon rings (in segments)<br>
pressed radially inwards by garter springs with cooling water forced<br>
through between the carbon rings and the rotating shaft sleeve. The<br>
cooling water lubricates and cools the rubbing items viz. the rotating<br>
shaft sleeve and the carbon rings. Also the cooling water being at a<br>
higher pressure than the pressure below the shaft seal in the top<br>
cover, it prevents the silty water from entering into the shaft seal.<br>
This seal can work satisfactorily when the peripheral velocity is high<br>
but gets worn out when silt content Is high.<br>
The present invention has proposed to solve the aforesaid difficulties<br>
of prior art.<br><br>
7<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
One object of this invention is to enhance the life of shaft seal for<br>
reaction type hydro turbines run by silt laden water.<br>
Another object of the invention is to reduce the pressure of water<br>
below shaft seal by sucking in the filtered water supplied to the shaft<br>
seal.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to prevent ingress of silt<br>
particles into shaft by boosting the water pressure in the pumping<br>
holes to a value higher than pressure of water in the top cover below<br>
the shaft seal.<br>
A further object of the invention is to restrict the increased discharge<br>
through the pump ring when the turbine accidentally goes to<br>
runaway speed.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to adjust the flow through<br>
pump ring to match site conditions.<br><br>
8<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the present invention, for enhancement of life of shaft seals of<br>
reaction type hydro turbines, ring with pumping holes is placed below<br>
the shaft seal, to suck in the filtered water supplied to the shaft seal.<br>
The pumping hole boost up the pressure of water coming out from<br>
the shaft seal and discharge it down through the labyrinth gap on<br>
shaft flange outer diameter, into the space below top cover. Thus, in<br>
spite of wearing of the main labyrinths and increase of water<br>
pressure in the space between top cover and runner, the raw<br>
unfiltered water containing silt particles is not able to enter the shaft<br>
seal, as the discharge pressure of the pumping holes would be higher<br>
than the raw water pressure which is built-up even with worn-out<br>
labyrinths.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a device to enhance life<br>
of shaft seals of reaction type hydro turbines run by silt laden water<br>
comprising of a pump ring being an annular shaped disc made out of<br><br>
9<br>
plate having radial holes drilled into it to constitute pumping holes,<br>
springs loaded plungers operated through retaining screw, diaphragm<br>
plugs provided in the threading on the outer end of the radial<br>
pumping holes to enable part of the holes totally plugged or filled<br>
with the diaphragm plugs to adjust flow of water, an additional<br>
labyrinth being adapted by way of stainless steel deposition on inner<br>
diameter of shaft seal cover and bronze deposition on the outer<br>
diameter of booster pump ring, the said device constituting an<br>
intermediate booster pump chamber between shaft seal and top<br>
cover (04) when adapted with shaft seal pressing against a stainless<br>
steel sleeve of a shaft for sucking clean filtered cooling water<br>
supplied to the shaft seal, the said filtered water pressure being<br>
boosted up through pumping holes of booster pump ring to attain<br>
higher pressure at the discharge chamber located on the top of the<br>
labyrinth between shaft and top cover than the top cover water<br>
pressure to guide water flow down the labyrinth on shaft flange outer<br>
diameter to prevent any entry of silt particles in the shaft seal and<br>
also booster pump area, thus ensuring enhanced life of shaft seals.<br><br>
10<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The outage of turbines due to failure of shaft seal is very high in<br>
hydel projects of Himalayan region, where the silt content in the river<br>
waters is very high. This problem becomes even more acute In case<br>
of high head turbines. Detailed investigations into the problem<br>
revealed that the main turbine labyrinths between runner and top<br>
cover wear out very fast due to high silt content. Once the labyrinths<br>
wear out, the pressure in the top cover increases. When the top<br>
cover water pressure increases to a value higher than the pressure of<br>
cooling water to shaft seal, flow reversal takes place. With flow<br>
reversal, the silt laden raw river water enters into the space between<br>
the rotating shaft sleeve and the sealing element of rubber sheet and<br>
/or carbon rings. The silt particles having a high quartz content wear<br>
off the shaft sleeve to such a limit that the turbine pit gets flooded by<br>
water from the top cover below shaft seal.<br><br>
11<br>
The solution to this problem lies In preventing entry of silt particle<br>
Into the shaft seal. This Is a two pronged solution.<br>
I)     To prevent the top cover water pressure after labyrinth from<br>
building up.<br>
ii)     To force down cooling water through shaft seal at a pressure<br>
higher than top cover pressure.<br>
For the first case, use of hard stainless steel or stainless steel with<br>
hard coatings enhanced the useful life of labyrinths by a small<br>
amount.<br>
Shifting of the labyrinth radially inward from the outer diameter of<br>
runner to somewhere closer to runner discharge diameter enhanced<br>
the life of labyrinths a bit at the cost of a heavy top cover, but the<br>
problem still persists.<br><br>
12<br>
The other approach of forcing down cooling water through shaft seal<br>
at a pressure higher than top cover water pressure is limited by the<br>
safe working pressure of the copper alloy tubes of the turbine and<br>
generator coolers.<br>
When the above two approaches have not been able to solve the<br>
persisting problem of the industry fully, creating an intermediate<br>
booster pump chamber between shaft seal and top cover was<br>
adapted to enable the cooling water to shaft seal discharging into an<br>
intermediate chamber. This intermediate chamber becomes the<br>
suction chamber of a pump which would boost up the shaft seal<br>
discharge water pressure to a pressure higher than the top cover<br>
water pressure even after labyrinth wear. The discharge of this<br>
booster pump is to be directed against the top cover water. The ring<br>
forming partition of the booster pump suction and discharge chamber<br>
become the pump itself.<br><br>

15<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show the existing rubber lip type shaft seal of<br>
reaction type hydro turbines. The sealing element (02) presses<br>
against a ss sleeve (05) which rotates along with the shaft (01). The<br>
sealing takes place by two layers of rubber lip seal (02) pressing<br>
against the stainless shaft sleeve (05) and cooling water Is forced<br>
through between the rubber lip and the rotating shaft sleeve. The<br>
cooling water lubricates and cools the rubbing items viz. the rotating<br>
shaft sleeve and rubber lip seals.<br>
Also, the cooling water is at a higher pressure than the pressure<br>
below the shaft seal in the top cover (04) and prevents the silt laden<br>
water from entering into the shaft seal.<br>
This arrangement of shaft seal functions satisfactorily when the<br>
peripheral rubbing velocity between the shaft sleeve and the rubber<br>
lips is low and the silt content in the river water is low. Labyrinth<br>
(03) is employed to reduce pressure in the top cover below the shaft<br>
seal.<br><br>
16<br>
This seal does not function satisfactorily when either the peripheral<br>
velocity is high or silt content is high.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show another existing carbon ring type shaft seal.<br>
In this arrangement, the sealing takes place by two layers of carbon<br>
rings (in segments) (07) pressed radially inwards by garter springs<br>
(08)<br>
Cooling water is forced though between the carbon rings (07) and<br>
the rotating shaft sleeve (05).<br>
The cooling water lubricates and cools the rubbing items, the rotating<br>
shaft sleeve and the carbon rings. Also, the cooling water being at a<br>
higher pressure than the pressure below the shaft seal in the top<br>
cover (04), it prevents the silt laden water from entering into the<br>
shaft seal.<br><br>
17<br>
This arrangement of shaft seal functions satisfactorily even when the<br>
peripheral velocity is high. But if the water has higher silt content<br>
this arrangement is not satisfactory.<br>
As such, shaft sealing has remained an area of concern with frequent<br>
maintenance requirements.<br>
The proposed invention presents an effective answers to address this<br>
difficulty.<br>
Figure 5 to 12 show in detail the adaptation of the booster pump with<br>
booster pump ring with shaft seal and throttling to solve the<br>
difficulties of prior art as discussed above.<br>
Inside the shaft sealing cavity, on the shaft flange, the pump ring<br>
(09) is placed. This is a disc manufactured out of plate of suitable<br>
thickness and has radial holes drilled in it. It is placed on the shaft<br>
flange in an annular spigot fitted groove below the shaft seal<br><br>
18<br>
housing. The filtered clean cooling water which is supplied at the<br>
rubber lips of the shaft seal (02) finds its way down the shaft sleeve<br>
(05) to the cavity below the shaft cover. The radial holes act as<br>
pumping holes and this water is pumped to attain a higher pressure<br>
at the outer diameter of the pump ring. The discharge chamber of<br>
booster pump ring is located on the top of the labyrinth (18) between<br>
shaft (01) and top cover (04). The water pressure in this discharge<br>
chamber would be sufficiently higher than the top cover water<br>
pressure. This would ensure that water necessarily flows down the<br>
labyrinth on shaft flange outer diameter and thereby prevents entry<br>
of silt particles even into the booster pump area leave aside the shaft<br>
seal. Additionally, a labyrinth (14) has been provided on the outer<br>
diameter of booster pump ring.<br>
This labyrinth (14) is adapted by way of stainless steel deposition<br>
(11) on inner diameter of shaft seal cover and bronze deposition (12)<br>
on outer diameter of booster pump ring and both machined to give<br>
fine running clearance. This labyrinth minimizes partial recirculation<br>
i.e.,<br><br>
19<br>
discharge water of booster pump leaking back into the suction<br>
chamber area where there is low pressure.<br>
The radial pumping holes are provided with threading/tapping on the<br>
outer end so that some of the holes can be either totally plugged or<br>
filled with diaphragm plugs (17) to adjust flow requirements.<br>
Safeguards for runaway speed: The discharge through the<br>
booster pump ring would be dependent on speed. At higher than<br>
normal running sped, the rubber iip would be heated more due to the<br>
increase in peripheral rubbing speed. There could be an increase in<br>
discharge through booster pump ring leading to more cooling water<br>
being sucked in between the rubber lips and shaft sleeve. However,<br>
to thwart-off any eventuality of starvation of shaft seal due to<br>
excessive discharge at runaway speed a special safeguard has been<br>
provided.<br><br>
20<br>
The radial pumping holes are connected vertically to anther series of<br>
radial holes located just above them and fitted with spring loaded<br>
plungers (15) and retaining screw (16). The spring (13) is so<br>
constructed that during normal speed running of the turbine, the<br>
plungers do not block the water passage. If and when the turbine<br>
accidentally goes to run-away speed, the plunger will overcome the<br>
spring force due to higher centrifugal force and would partially block<br>
the passage of water though the hole. This will prevent increased<br>
suction of cooling water through the shaft seal at the higher speed.<br>
The increased suction could have led to starvation of cooling water to<br>
shaft seal. Any increase of discharge through the pumping holes is<br>
restricted and therefore, the shaft seal is not starved of cooling water<br>
and is safeguarded at runaway speed condition.<br>
The pumping holes are also fitted with plugs with diaphragm holes<br>
drilled in them, a number of which can be taken off to control the<br>
total pumping effect.<br><br>
21<br>
Adaptation for low speed turbine: In case of turbines where the<br>
rotational speed is low, the head developed in the pumping holes<br>
may not be higher than top cover water pressure to prevent flow<br>
reversal and entry of silt into the shaft seal. For such cases, instead<br>
of a shaft driven booster pump ring with pumping holes, an<br>
electrically operated booster pump will be installed as shown in figure<br>
12. Its suction pipe will be connected to the chamber formed below<br>
shaft seal and above the disc which will form a labyrinth (14) on the<br>
outer diameter with the shaft seal cover. The discharge of the<br>
booster pump is connected to the chamber formed below the rotating<br>
disc. In this way, top cover water containing silt laden water is<br>
prevented from entering the shaft seal.<br>
Augmentation of worn-out labyrinths: In high head turbine<br>
operated by very high silt laden water the main labyrinth between<br>
top cover and runner wear out very fast, leading to increase of top<br>
cover water pressure. The shaft mounted booster pump would<br>
oppose the ingress of top cover water to a large extent. However,<br><br>
22<br>
during floods, the wear of laybyrinths become excessive and the<br>
turbine cannot be stopped for labyrinth replacement on account of<br>
generation loss. In such situations an electrically operated pump<br>
would augment the capacity of shaft mounted booster pump ring and<br>
postpone labyrinth replacement to a leaner period. For such a case,<br>
the suction and discharge pipes of the electrical pump would be<br>
connected as shown in figure 12.<br>
The invention as herein described with an illustrative embodiment<br>
should not be read and construed in a restrictive manner as various<br>
modifications, alterations and adaptations are possible within the<br>
scope and ambit of the invention as defined in the encompassed<br>
appended claims.<br><br>

Dated   this      9th	day of      April   2007<br><br><br>
This invention relates to a device to enhance life of shaft seals of<br>
reaction type hydro turbines run by silt laden water comprising of a<br>
pump ring (09) having radial holes drilled into it to constitute<br>
pumping holes, springs (13) mounting plungers (15), diaphragm<br>
plugs (17) to adjust flow of water, an additional labyrinth (14)<br>
adapted on inner diameter of shaft seal cover and on the outer<br>
diameter of booster pump ring, the said device constituting an<br>
intermediate booster pump chamber between shaft seal and top<br>
cover (04), the said device when adapted with shaft seal (02) for<br>
sucking clean filtered cooling water supplied to the shaft seal, the<br>
said filtered water pressure being boosted up through booster pump<br>
ring to attain higher pressure at the discharge chamber located on<br>
the top of the labyrinth (18) between shaft (01) and top cover (04)<br>
than the top cover water pressure to guide water flow down the<br>
labyrinth (18) on shaft flange outer diameter to prevent any entry of<br>
slit particles in the shaft seal and also booster pump area, thus<br>
ensuring enhanced life of shaft seals.</td>
