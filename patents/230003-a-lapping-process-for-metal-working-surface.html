WORKING SURFACE AND SYSTEM FOR PRODUCTION THEREOF<br>
FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to workpieces having working surfaces and, more particularly, to a working surface and a system for production of the working surface.<br>
In order to reduce friction and wear in mechanically interacting surfaces, a lubricant is introduced to the zone of interaction. As depicted schematically in Fig. 1A, under ideal lubricating conditions, the lubricant film 20 between opposing surfaces 32 and 34, moving at a relative velocity V, forms an intact layer which permits the moving surfaces to interact with the lubricant. Under such conditions, no contact between surfaces 32 and 34 occurs at all, and the lubricant layer is said to carry a load P that exists between the opposing surfaces. If the supply of lubricant is insufficient, a reduction in the effectivity of the lubrication ensues, which allows surface to surface interactions to occur.<br>
As shown schematically in Fig. 1B, below a certain level of lubricant supply, the distance between opposing, relatively moving surfaces 32 and 34 diminishes because of load P, such that surface asperities, i.e.., peaks of surface material protruding from the surfaces, may interact. Thus, for example, the asperity 36 of surface 34 can physically contact and interact with an asperity 38 of surface 32. In an extreme condition, the asperities of surfaces 32 and 34 carry all of the load existing between the interacting surfaces. In this condition, often referred to as boundary lubrication, the lubricant is ineffective and the friction and wear are high.<br>
Grinding and lapping are conventional methods of improving surface quality (e.g., surface finish) and for producing working surfaces for, inter alia, various tribological applications. Fig. 1C (i)-(ii) schematically illustrate a working surface being conditioned in a conventional lapping process. In Fig. IC(i), a working surface 32 of a workpiece 31 faces a contact surface 35 of lapping tool 34. An abrasive paste containing abrasive particles, of which is illustrated a typical abrasive particle 36, is disposed between working surface 32 and contact surface 35. Contact surface 35 of lapping tool 34 is made of a material having a lower hardness with respect to working surface 32.    The composition and size distribution of the abrasive particles are<br><br>
\V0 2005/024287<br><br>
PCT/IL2004/000800<br><br>
selected so as to readily wear down working surface 32 according to plan, such as reducing surface roughness so as to achieve a pre-determined finish.<br>
A load is exerted in a substantially normal direction to surfaces 32 and 35, causing abrasive particle 36 to penetrate working surface 32 and contact surface 35, and resulting in a pressure P being exerted on a section of abrasive particle 36 that is embedded in working surface 32. The penetration depth of abrasive particle 36 into working surface 32 is designated by hal; the penetration depth of abrasive particle 36 into contact surface 35 is designated by hbi- Generally, abrasive particle 36 penetrates into lapping tool 34 to a greater extent than the penetration into workpiece 31, such that hbi &gt; hal.<br>
In Fig. 1C(ii), workpiece 31 and lapping tool 34 are made to move in a relative velocity V. The pressure P, and relative velocity V of workpiece 31 and lapping tool 34, are of a magnitude such that abrasive particle 36, acting like a knife, gouges out a chip of surface material from workpiece 31.<br>
At low relative velocities, abrasive particle 36 is substantially stationary. Typically, however, and as shown in Fig. 1C(ii), relative velocity V is selected such that a corresponding shear force Q is large enough, with respect to pressure P, such that the direction of combined force vector F on abrasive particle 36 causes abrasive particle 36 to rotate. Because the material of lapping tool 34 that is in contact with abrasive particle 36 is substantially unyielding (i.e., of low elasticity) with respect to the particles in the abrasive paste, these particles are usually ground up quite quickly, such that the abrasive paste must be replenished frequently.<br>
In the known art, grinding, lapping, polishing and cutting are carried out on materials such as metals, ceramics, glass, plastic, wood and the like, using bonded abrasives such as grinding wheels, coated abrasives, loose abrasives and abrasive cutting tools. Abrasive particles, the cutting tools of the abrasive process, are naturally occurring or synthetic materials which are generally much harder than the materials which they cut. The most commonly used abrasives in bonded, coated and loose abrasive applications are garnet, alpha alumina, silicon carbide, boron carbide, cubic boron nitride, and diamond. The relative hardness of the materials can be seen from the following table:<br><br>
WO 2005/024287	PCT/IL2004/000800<br>
]<br>
i<br>
i<br>
1<br>
The choice of abrasive is normally dictated by economics, finish desired, and the material being abraded. The abrasive list above is in order of increasing hardness, but it is also coincidentally in order of increasing cost with garnet being the least expensive abrasive and diamond the most expensive.<br>
Generally, a soft abrasive is selected to abrade a soft material and a hard abrasive to abrade harder types of materials in view of the cost of the various abrasive materials. There are, of course, exceptions such as very gummy materials where the harder materials actually cut more efficiently. Furthermore, the harder the abrasive grain, the more material it will remove per unit volume or weight of abrasive. Superabrasive materials include diamond and cubic boron nitride, both of which are used in a wide variety of applications-<br>
The known lapping methods and systems have several distinct deficiencies, including:<br>
•	The contact surface of the lapping tool is eventually consumed by the abrasive material, requiring replacement- In some typical applications, the contact surface of the lapping tool is replaced after approximately 50 workpieces have been processed.<br>
•	Sensitivity to the properties of the abrasive paste, including paste formulation, hardness of the abrasive particles, and particle size distribution (PSD) of the abrasive particles.<br>
•	Sensitivity to various processing parameters in the lapping process.<br>
•	The lapping processing must generally be performed in several discrete lapping stages, each stage using an abrasive paste having different<br><br>
\VO 2005/024287<br><br>
PCT/IL2004/000800<br><br>
physical properties. There is therefore a recognized need for, and it would be highly advantageous to have workpieces having improved working surfaces.    It would be of further advantage to have a  system that overcomes the manifest deficiencies of the known lapping technologies, and that produces such improved working surfaces.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is an improved work surface, and a system for production of the improved work surface.<br>
The principles and operation of the present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and the accompanying description.<br>
Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of<br><br>
WO 2005/024287<br><br>
PCT/IL2004/000800<br><br>
construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawing. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways.. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, lubricated surfaces in relative sliding motion are treated to produce less wear and friction in the course of interaction. In most general terms, the process of the invention transforms a working surface, forming two zones, one having a high degree of lubricant repellence, and the other having a relative attraction towards the lubricant. The two zones are interposed as will be described later on. One zone constitutes an assembly of well-distributed structures on the working surface, having a more pronounced attraction towards the lubricant. A schematic representation of the concept of the invention is shown in Fig. 2, to which reference is now made. A schematic working surface is shown which is composed of a combination of zones. The zones marked A are lubricant attractive and the zones marked R are relatively lubricant repelling.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the difference between the zones with respect to attraction to the lubricant is associated with a structural difference. The structural aspects of the system of this embodiment of the invention are schematically described in reference to Figs. 3A-B. In Fig. 3A, a cylinder 50 has its surface structured such that one or more grooves, such as helical groove 52, are engraved on the surface. Typically, such grooves have a maximum depth of about 5-30 microns, and a width of about 100-1000 microns. The remainder of the original surface is one or more ridges, in this example, a helical ridge 54. Thus, the exterior of cylinder 50 includes two zones, the superficial zone that includes the ridges, and the recessed zone including the grooves. In Fig. 3B, a metal slab 60 has been processed in accordance with the present invention. The working surface, after undergoing a frictional interaction with another element (not shown), includes grooves 62, the assembly of which become the recessed zone, and alternate ridges 64, which form the superficial zone of the working surface of metal slab 60.<br><br>
,W0 2005/024287<br><br>
PCT/IL2004/000800<br><br>
Zone patterns<br>
As explained above, one preferred embodiment of the invention employs recesses as lubricant attracting and superficial ridges as lubricant repelling zones., In Figs&gt; 4A-F are provided exemplary, schematic patterns of recesses, such as microgrooves, which are suitable for the structural aspects of embodiments of the present invention. Figs. 4A-B show sinusoidal patterns of varying density; Fig. 4C shows a sinusoidal pattern containing overlapping sinuses; Fig. 4D shows a pitied pattern; Fig. 4E shows a pattern of rhomboids, and Fig. 4F shows a helical pattern. The diversity of optional patterns is very large, and the examples given above constitute only a representative handful.<br>
Processing the working surface<br>
The processing in accordance with the present invention involves forming a surface possessing lubricant repelling zones. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the surface is a compound surface possessing both lubricant attractive zones and lubricant repelling zones. Preferably, the lubricant repelling zone is a superficial zone of the working surface, which can be produced either by mechanically processing the working surface, or by coating the superficial zone with a lubricant-repelling coat.<br>
In some embodiments, mechanical processing of a working surface for the purpose of conveying particular frictional properties requires a change in the relief of the working surface. In a preferred process for conditioning the working surface, described schematically in Fig. 5, forming a recessed zone and conditioning the superficial zone take place in the following order: in step 90, the working surface is machined by abrading and/or lapping so as to obtain a high degree of flatness and surface finish. In step 92, the recessed zone is formed as will be explained later on, and in step 94, conditioning of the superficial zone takes place-Lapping is a suitable, preferred technique for such conditioning of the superficial zone. Lapping can achieve a very good flatness rating, and very good finish. The lapping technique uses a free-flowing abrasive material, as compared to grinding, which uses fixed abrasives.<br><br>
WO 2005/024287<br><br>
PCT/IL2004/000800<br><br>
Fig. 6A describes schematically an interacting surface 100, the working surface 102 of which is to be processed in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. A schematic sectional view of the surface is shown in Fig. 6B, indicating the position of an enlarged view of the cross section shown in Figs. 7A-D. In Fig. 7A, the pre-machined surface 106 is shown. In Fig. 7B, the machined surface is shown leveled. In Fig, 7C, surface 106 is shown after microgrooves 108 have been formed. In the next step, as shown in Fig. 7D, the working surface has been transformed, to convey lubricant-repelling properties to superficial zone 109. A new layer has formed within the superficial zone, this layer designated schematically by the number 110. The reason that the lapping step preferably comes after the microgroove production stage is that forming the recessed microstructures on the surface may cause bulges to appear. Such bulges may appear even if the structural changes are made by laser-cutting. This is illustrated in Figs. 8A-B, to which reference is now made. In Fig. 8A, cross section in the working surface is schematically represented by line 120. In Fig. 8B, microgrooves 120 are formed, accompanied by bulges 122, In Fig. 8C, the superficial zone has been processed by lapping, leveling off the bulges and producing the plastically defoniied layer 124, which is lubricant-repelling. If the micro-relief forming step does not affect the form and properties of the superficial zone, then the micro-relief forming step can take place last.<br>
As mentioned above, lapping is a preferred mechanical finishing method for obtaining the characteristics of the working surface of the mechanical element in accordance with the present invention. The lapping incorporates a lapping tool, the surface of which is softer than the working surface of the processed mechanical part. The abrasive grit must be much harder than the face of the lapping tool, and harder than the processed working surface. It is essential that the abrasive grit is not too hard or brittle, thus, diamond grit is not appropriate for the inventive lapping technology. Aluminum oxide has been found to be a suitable abrasive material for a variety of lapping surfaces and working surfaces, in accordance with the invention-Figs. 9A-B schematically present progressive steps in the inventive lapping process, in which the conditioning of the working surface is promoted. The initial condition is shown schematically on the microscopic level in Fig. 9A.  The irregular<br><br>
*W0 2005/024287<br><br>
PCT/1L2OO4/000800<br><br>
topography of working surface 132 (disposed on workpiece 131) faces lapping tool 134 and is separated by an irregular distance therefrom. Abrasive particles 136 and others are partially sunken in the lapping tool 134, and to a lesser extent, in working surface 132, The working surfiace and the lapping tool are made to move in a relative motion designated by arrow 138. This motion has an instantaneous magnitude V.<br>
In Fig. 9B, some lapping action has taken place, causing working surface 132 to become less irregular. As a result of the relative movement between the surfaces, the abrasive particles, such as abrasive particle 139, are now rounded to some extent, losing some of their sharp edges in the course of rubbing against the surfaces.<br>
While initially, abrasive particles 136 penetrate into working surface 132 and gouge out material therefrom, as the process continues, and the abrasive particles become rounded, substantially no additional stock is removed from the processed part. Instead, the lapping movement effects a plastic deformation in working surface 132 of workpiece 131, so as to increase the micro-hardness of working surface 132. The hardened layer or layers on working surface 132 are associated, inter alia, with the repellence property with respect to the lubricant.<br>
Fig. 9C (i)-(iii) are an additional schematic representation of a working surface being conditioned in a lapping process and system of the present invention. In Fig, 9C(i), a working surface 132 of a workpiece 131 faces a contact surface 135 of lapping tool 134. An abrasive paste containing abrasive particles, of which is illustrated a typical abrasive particle 136, is disposed between working surface 132 and contact surface 135. As in conventional lapping technologies, contact surface 135 of lapping tool 134 is made of a material having a greater wear-resistance and a lower hardness with respect to working surface 132. The composition and size distribution of the abrasive particles are selected so as to readily wear down working surface 132 according to plan, such as reducing surface roughness to a predetermined roughness.<br>
A load is exerted in a substantially normal direction to surfaces 132 and 135, causing abrasive particle 136 to penetrate working surface 132 and contact surface 135, and resulting in a pressure P being exerted on a section of abrasive particle 136 that is embedded in working surface 132. The penetration depth of abrasive particle 136 into working surface 132 is designated by ha2; the penetration depth of abrasive<br><br>
WO 2005/024287<br><br>
PCT/IL2004/000800<br><br>
particle 136 into contact surface 135 is designated by hb2- Abrasive particle 136 penetrates into lapping tool 134 to a much greater extent than the penetration into workpiece 131, such that hb2 » ba2 Significantly, because of the substantial elastic character of the deformation of inventive contact surface 135, the penetration depth of abrasive particle 136 into contact surface 135 is much larger than the penetration depths of identical abrasive particles into contact surfaces of the prior art (under the same pressure P), i.e.,<br>
bb2 &gt; hbb where hbi is defined in Fig. lC(i).  Consequently, the penetration depth of abrasive<br>
particle 136 into working surface 132, ba2, is much smaller than the corresponding<br>
penetration depth, hai, of the prior art, i.e.,<br>
ha2<hal.></hal.>
In Fig. 9C(ii), workpiece 131 and lapping tool 134 are made to move in a relative velocity V. The pressure P, and relative velocity V of workpiece 131 and lapping tool 134, are of a magnitude such that abrasive particle 136, acting like a knife, gouges out a chip of surface material from workpiece 131. This chip is typically much smaller than the chips that are gouged out of the working surfaces conditioned by lapping technologies of the prior art.<br>
In Figs. 9C(ii)-(iii), relative velocity V is selected such that a corresponding shear force Q is large enough, with respect to pressure P, such that the direction of combined force vector F on abrasive particle 136 causes abrasive particle 136 to rotate. During this rotation, the elasticity of lapping tool 134 and contact surface 135 results in less internal strains within abrasive particle 136, with respect to the prior art, such that a typical particle, such as abrasive particle 136, does not shatter, rather, the edges of the surface become rounded. An idealization of this rounding phenomenon is provided schematically in Fig. 9C(iii).<br>
The working surfaces of the present invention have an intrinsic microstructure that influences various macroscopic properties of the surface. Without wishing to be limited by theory, it is believed that the inventive lapping system effects a plastic deformation in the working surface, so as to improve the microstructure of the working surface.<br><br>
AVO 2005/024287	PCT/IL2004/000800<br>
One manifestation of the modified microstructure is a greatly increased microhardness. Another manifestation of the modified microstructure is the characteristic wetting property of the inventive surface, as shown in 10B-1 and Fig. I0B-2. The characteristic wetting property of a reference surface is shown, for comparative purposes, in Figs. 10A-1 and Fig. 10A-2.<br>
Both the reference surface specimen and the inventive surface specimen are made out of annealed SAE 4340 steel (HRC = 54). A single drop of C22 oil was dispersed over the entire surface of each specimen, such that coverage or wetting was substantially 100%. Subsequently, the wetted area was monitored as a function of time. Fig. 10A-1 represents the reference working surface 5 seconds after the oil drop was distributed, and Fig. 10A1-2 represents the identical working surface, 60 seconds after the oil drop was distributed. As expected, the reference surface specimen remained completely covered by the layer of oil, and continued to be completely covered for the entire duration of the test (24 hours).<br>
Fig. 10B-1 and Fig. 10B-2 are photographic representations of wetting patterns of an exemplary inventive working surface that was initially covered with oil, wherein Fig. 10B-1 represents the inventive working surface 5 seconds after an oil drop was distributed, and Fig. 10B1-2 represents the identical work surface, 60 seconds after the oil drop was distributed. By sharp contrast to the reference specimen, the wetted area decreased rapidly in a matter of seconds.<br>
The characteristic dimensionless wetting coefficient, defined by:<br><br>
wherein A(t) is the nominal wetted area of the working surface as a function of time, and A0 is the nominal surface area of the working surface, decreased from a value of 1 at t=0 to about 0.85 after only 5 seconds. After 1 minute, the characteristic dimensionless wetting coefficient decreased below 0.25. As discussed hereinabove, this liquid repelling quality of the inventive working surface is associated with reduced friction and wear, reduced risk of seizure, and extended operating life of mechanical elements incorporating such surfaces.<br><br>

Mechanical Criteria for the Contact Surface of the Lapping Tool<br>
It has been found that coating a lapping tool with a thin (e.g., 0.05 - 0.4 mm), somewhat elastic layer, promotes both the micro-hardness and the lubricant repellence of a conditioned working surface. The mechanical criteria with which such a layer should comply include:<br>
1.	wear resistance with respect to the abrasive paste used in the lapping process;<br>
2.	elastic deformation such that individual abrasive particles protrude into, and are held by, the layer; as the individual abrasive particles turn during contact with the working surface, the elastic deformation should enable the layer to be absorbed into the layer in varying depths, according to the varying pressures exerted between the particles and the working surface. Consequently, the abrasive particles rotate against the working surface and become more rounded with time, instead of undergoing comminution (being ground into a fine powder).<br>
3.	the hardness of the layer should be selected such that the layer does not appreciably break or grind the abrasive powder;<br>
4.	strong adhesion of the layer to the lapping tool base.<br>
By way of example, it has been found that a mixture of epoxy cement and poiyurethane in a ratio of about 10:90 to 30:70, by weight, is suitable for forming the contact surface of the lapping tool. In the epoxy cement/polyurethane mixture, the epoxy provides the hardness and the adhesion to the base of the lapping tool, whereas the poiyurethane provides the requisite elasticity and wear-resistance.<br>
The inventive contact surface (lapping surface) should have the following combination of physical and mechanical properties:<br>
•	Brinell hardness within a range of 2-10 kg/mm2;<br>
•	impact resistance within a range of 30-70 kg-m/cm2;<br>
•	sufficient adhesion to the lapping tool base, for those applications that utilize a lapping tool base.<br>
It should be appreciated that a variety of materials or combinations of materials could<br><br>

be developed, by one skilled in the art, that would satisfy these physical and mechanical property requirements.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, a plastic coat is applied on the working surface instead of mechanically conditioning the superficial zone. The working surface is coated with a plastic coating having the above-described set of mechanical properties. The procedure for coating the working surface includes fust covering the working surface with a precursor of the coat. The main stages in the processing of a working surface in accordance with this embodiment of the invention are illustrated in Figs., 11A-C, to which reference is now made. In Fig. 11 A, the working surface is designated 150- In Fig. 1 IB, a plastic coat 152 is disposed on working surface 150. After coat 152 is deposited, portions of coat 152 are removed, by way of example, by subjecting working surface 150 and coat 152 to micro-grooving, as shown schematically in Fig. 11C. The micro-grooves or recesses 154 penetrate through plastic coat 152 and into working surface 150. In this example, ridges 153, having a surface made of plastic coat 152, constitute a superficial zone, whereas recesses 154 constitute a recessed zone. The recessed zone is more attractive to the lubricant applied to the working surface than is the superficial zone.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the working surface is pre-processed by grinding. Subsequently, the surface is coated by a layer of lubricant repelling tape, containing holes. The results of this procedure are shown schematically in Fig. 12. Working surface 160 is covered with a plastic perforated sheet 162, in which holes such as hole 164 are punched prior to coating.<br>
Forming the recessed zone<br>
In order to form the recessed zone, the working surface is micro-structured to obtain a plurality of recesses. This can be achieved by various methods known in the art, including mechanical cutting, laser engraving, and chemical etching. Methods for producing regular micro-relief in mechanical parts is taught by M. Levitin and B. Shamshidov in "A Disc on Flat Wear Test Under Starved Lubrication", Tribotest Journal 4-2, December 1997, (4), 159, the contents of which are incorporated herewith by reference.<br><br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Reference is now made to the following examples, which together with the above description, illustrate the invention in a non-limiting fiashion.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The experimental set-up is described schematically in Fig. 13, to which reference is now made. An interchangeable set of carbon steel discs of 30 mm diameter, such as disc 186 rotatable around an axle, is made to rotate against a flat counter-plate 192 for measuring wear. The discs are made of carbon steel grade 1045, having an HRC of 27-30- Electrical motor or gear 190 supplies the torque for the rotation. Counter-plate 192 is made of a copper alloy (UNS C93700 (HRC=22-24)), ground to an average roughness (Ra) of 0.4 micrometers. Counter-plate 192 has a support 194, which has an adjustable height for controlling the force applied on disc 186.<br>
The control discs have a conventional grinding finish (Ra - 0.4 micrometers), whereas the test discs undergo further treatment by micro-grooving face 196 of the disc, and then by lapping, in accordance with the present invention. During the experiments, a permanent load of a 100 N is applied to the disc in the direction of the counter plate 192. One drop of Amoco Industrial Oil 32 (equivalent to ASTM 150 Turbine Oil) is applied to the dry friction surface before activating the motor to achieve a constant rotation rate of 250 rpm. The time to seizure, which is the accumulated time from start of turning, until the time in which movement was stopped by seizure, was measured.<br>
After 16-18 minutes, all control discs underwent seizure. By sharp contrast, the disc that was treated by micro-grooving and lapping, according to the present invention, continued to revolve without stopping, for a period above 40 hours, at which point the experiment was curtailed. Seizure of the treated disc did not occur..<br>
In another experiment, the disc was rotated at 180 rpm, A group of control discs was subjected to finishing by grinding. A second group of discs was subjected to micro-grooving. A third group of discs was subjected to micro-grooving and to lapping, according to the present invention.    The results of a one-drop test are<br><br>
WO 2005/024287	PCT/IL2004/000800<br>
provided in Table 1. The path of the disc until seizure, the coefficient of friction, and the intensity of wear (measured by peak depression formed on the counter-plate as a result of the friction with the disc) were calculated.<br>
Table 1: Results of Discs Rolling Against a Counter-Plate<br><br>
The inventive working surface of the present invention, incorporated in various mechanical elements that engaged in frictional forces, reduces friction and wear, risk of seizure, and prolongs the operating life of such elements. In punching applications, the qualities of the working surface are improved, and a power reduction of up to 30% is observed-<br>
In internal combustion engines, the inventive working surface, and the inventive system for production thereof, were applied to 120 mm cylinder sleeves of diesel engines and to 108 mm diameter motorcycle engines. The results of the tests demonstrate that for a given performance level, the use of sleeves having the inventive work surfaces, as compared with conventional sleeves, reduces fuel consumption. In addition, the sleeves having the inventive working surfaces have a characteristically longer lifetime, and lose less oil.<br>

term 'liquid attracting zone" refers to a zone within a working surface in which the characteristic dimensionless wetting coefficient is greater than 0.95, and typically greater than 0.98, 60 minutes after the initial dispersion of oil on to the working surface.<br>
As used herein in the specification and in the claims section that follows, the term "characteristic dimensionless wetting coefficient" is defined by:<br><br>
wherein A(t) is the nominal wetted area of the working surface as a function of time, and A0 is the nominal surface area of the working surface, and wherein the liquid used for determining A(t) is No. 22 industrial oil.<br>

As used herein in the specification and in the claims section that follows, the term "nominal surface area" with regard to a working surface, refers to a surface area of the surface based on the global geometric dimensions, without regard to microstructure. Hence, a square, 4cm x 4cm working surface has a nominal surface area of 16cm2.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A roller on block tribo-tester was used to evaluate the tribological properties of rollers processed according to the present invention, in a "one drop test". The test rig is described schematically in Fig. 14. A rotating roller 2 is brought into contact with a stationary block 3 under a given load P while a very small amount of lubricant (one drop) is applied to the contact- A force transducer 4 is used to measure the friction force F and a proximity probe 9 measures the variation in the gap, thus providing the total wear of roller 2 and block 3. Both friction and wear are continuously monitored and recorded as functions of time. The test is stopped at the occurrence of any one of the following three events: (a) the friction coefficient ~F/P reaches a value of 0.3; (b)<br><br>
WO 2005/024287<br><br>
PCT/IL2004/000800<br><br>
seizure starts between the roller and the block (characterized by a sudden, sharp increase in friction and corresponding increase in noise level), or (c) the friction reaches a maximum value and starts decreasing- The test duration is defined as the time elapsed from the start of the test until the end of the test due to the occurrence of events (a) or (b) described above, or the time corresponding to the maximum friction in case of event (c). It should be noted that in this special case (c), the test is continued for about 20 minutes beyond the "test duration" prior to complete stop. For each new test, block 3 is moved horizontally in its holder 6 to provide a fresh contact.<br>
Tests were performed on each of 6 steel roller specimens, using a bronze block as the counter-surface. Roller #1 and roller #6 are reference rollers, as described in Table 2 herein below. Rollers #2-5 were processed with combined micro relief, according to the present invention, with various groove patterns and groove areas, SAE 40 oil at room temperature was used as the lubricant. One drop of oil was placed on roller 2, which is then brought into light contact (18 N load) with bronze block 3 and turned (manually) two revolutions to spread the oil over the entire circumference-The amount of excess oil transferred to the block was wiped off with a clean paper towel, leaving only the roller lubricated. The load was increased to a level of P =150 R and the test was started with a roller speed of 105 ± 5 rpm.<br>
Table 2 presents the test duration, in minutes, of each roller, and indicates the type of event that caused the stop of the test. Fig. 15 shows the friction coefficient at the stop point of the test for each roller.<br>
Reference roller #1 seized after a very short time of 6 minutes at a friction coefficient = 0.23- Roller #6 exhibited a continuously increasing friction, and the test was stopped after 21 minutes, at a friction coefficient = 03 and seizure inception. All rollers processed in accordance with the present invention (rollers #2 to #5) showed an increased friction up to a certain maximum value, followed by a decrease in the friction. The maximum friction coefficient in these 4 rollers was no more than 0.18. Roller #5 had a friction coefficient of 0.11, which was the lowest friction coefficient of the six rollers.<br>
A graph of the friction coefficient (µ) and wear (h) as a function of friction length (L) is provided in Fig. 16.<br><br>
