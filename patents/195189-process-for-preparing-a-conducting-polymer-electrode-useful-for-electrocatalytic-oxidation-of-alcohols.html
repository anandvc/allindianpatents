				<td>PROCESS FOR PREPARING A CONDUCTING POLYMER ELECTRODE USEFUL FOR ELECTROCATALYTIC OXIDATION OF ALCOHOLS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a conducting polymer electrode useful for electrocataiytic oxidation of alcohols. More particularly it relates to modification of metallic anode using conducting polymers having appropriate composition which can be used for electro-oxidation of methanol useful for fuel cells. Background of the invention<br>
Oxidation of alcohols particularly methanol using electro-catalytic process is useful for fuel cells such as direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC). The efficiency of the fuel cell depends very much on the active surface of the electrodes. In order to increase the electrocataiytic efficiency the electrodes are often activated using palladium, platinum and ruthenium complexes (J. Appl. Electrochem., Vol.28 (1998) p. 1389-1397; J. Power Sources, Vol. 79 (1999) p. 43-59; Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho JP 2001256982 A2 21 Sep 2001, 11 pp. ). However, these type of reactions usually take place efficiently at high temperatures. Since high pressure can build up during such processes, it leads to hazardous conditions due to possibilities of explosion. Hence, it is desirable to carry out such reactions at normal ambient conditions, which can be feasible by electrochemical methods using special electrodes. The electro-oxidation of alcohols using platinum activated carbon or graphite electrodes has been reported before (Electrochim. Acta, 44(15), 1999 p.2559-2569) but the currents are not very high and the yield is poor. In order to increase the electrode activity it is essential to modify the same and preferably make it electrocataiytic so that high yield and selectivity are obtained for alcohol and in particular methanol. Further, the platinum, palladium or ruthenium based complexes are very expensive and hence they are not economical for use in DMFC type fuel cells. There is no prior art for preparation of conducting polymer electrodes with specific catalytic activity for alcohol. Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation of electrodes useful for electrocataiytic oxidation of methanol so as to make the electrodes more efficient and economical.<br>

The insulating substrate used generally comprises a glass plate, polyester film having smooth surface and electrical resistivity higher than 10 10 ohm-cm. The metallic or conducting backing layer comprises of vacuum deposited thin films of gold, platinum, chromium or dip-coated carbon or graphite dispersions having inert nature in the potential range of 0 to 1.0 Volts with respect to saturated calomel electrode (SCE).<br>
The polymer used for pre-treating the insulating substrates comprises polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl acetate, styrene butadiene co-polymer having adhesion strength higher than 10 g/micron The concentration of polymer solution used for pre-coating is in the range of 1 to 2 wt./v. The activator is chosen from halides of multivalent metals having electro-negativity ranging from 1.2 to 1.5. The doping agent used contains electron acceptor compounds such as copper chloride, ferric<br>
chloride, cobalt chloride and similar Lewis acid compounds in the concentration range of 0.001 M to 0.1 M preferably 0.006 M to 0.012 M.<br>

In a feature of the present invention the conventional coating of the polymer on the metal pre-coated insulating substrate is preferably carried out by dipping the pre-treated insulting substrate in an aqueous electrolyte containing 0.1 to 0.5 M hydrogen containing mineral acids such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid together with a monomer and a macrocyclic compound, by applying potential of 0.7 to 0.9 Volts. The doping is optionally done when the polymer deposition is carried out only with the use of the monomer.<br>
The process of the present invention is described hereinbelow with reference to the following illustrative examples, and should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention in any manner.<br>
EXAMPLE - 1<br>
Clean microscopic grade glass slides were dip coated in a solution (1.0 wt%) of polyvinyl butyral in methanol, dried and heated to 60°C for few minutes to drive off the solvent. These were placed in a vacuum deposition chamber, which was evacuated to 10"6 torr and gold films (0.1 to 0.2 um thick) were deposited using thermal evaporation technique. The substrates with metallic coating were placed in an electrochemical cell as working electrode, platinum foil as counter electrode and SCE reference electrode. In the electrochemical cell 100 ml distilled water was taken. 0.55g of pyrrole and 0.8 ml of H2SO4 was added and mixed properly. This is solution (A). In a separate beaker 50 ml distilled water was taken and 0.5g of pyrrole was added with stirring after which 0.419g of ZrCl4 was added to this and mixed thoroughly and allowed to stand for 1 hour. This formed solution (B). The solution (B) was slowly poured in the solution (A) in the electrochemical cell. The conducting polymer deposition was carried out by applying a potential of 0.7V (Saturated standard Calomel Electrode) for 120 seconds to the working electrode. The modified electrodes were removed and dried at 25 °C for 2 to 3 hours.<br>
EXAMPLE - 2<br>
The clean microscopic glass plates were dip coated in a solution (1.0 wt%) of styrene-butadiene copolymer in toluene and dried at 50 ° C for 10 min. These were<br>
placed in a vacuum chamber, which was evacuated to 10 " 6 torr and gold films deposited by thermal evaporation technique. These were then placed in the electrochemical cell with platinum counter electrode and SCE reference electrode. 100 ml distilled water was taken in the electrochemical cell to which were added 0 55g of pyrrole and 0.8 ml of H2SO4 with stirring. This is solution (A). In a separate beaker 50 ml distilled water was taken and 0.5g of pyrrole was added with stirring after which 0.356g MnCl2 was added to this mixture with stirring and then allowed to stand for 1 hour. This formed solution (B). The solution (B) was slowly poured in the solution (A) in the electrochemical cell. The conducting polymer deposition was carried out by applying a potential of 0.7V (Saturated standard Calomel Electorde) for 120 seconds to the working electrode. The modified electrodes were removed and dried at 25 °C for 2 to 3 hours.<br>
EXAMPLE - 3<br>
Clean microscopic grade glass slides were dip coated in a solution (1.0 wt%) of polyvinyl butyral in methanol , dried and heated to 60 °C for few minutes to drive off the solvent. These were placed in a vacuum deposition chamber which was evacuated to 10-6 torr and gold films (0.1 to 0.2 um thick) were deposited using thermal evaporation technique. The substrates with metallic coating were placed in an electrochemical cell as working electrode, platinum foil as counter electrode and SCE reference electrode. 100 ml distilled water was taken in the electrochemical cell to which were added 0.55g of pyrrole and 0.8 ml of H2S04 with stirring. This is solution (A). In a separate beaker 50 ml distilled water was taken and 0.5g of pyrrole was added with stirring after which 0.285g NiCl2 was added to this mixture with stirring and then allowed to stand for 1 hour. This formed solution (B). The solution (B) was slowly poured in the solution (A) in the electrochemical cell. The conducting polymer deposition was carried out by applying a potential of 0.7V (Saturated standard Calomel Electorde) for 120 seconds to the working electrode. The modified electrodes were removed and dried at 25 °C for 2 to 3 hours.<br>
The anodic oxidation of methanol was carried out with these electrodes prepared by the process described in the present invention in an electrochemical cell containing 150 ml of distilled water in which oxygen was bubbled for an hour. 1.06 g HCI04 and 0.048g of methanol were added to the solution. The anodic current was measured at the methanol oxidation    potential of 0.5  V (SCE) applied to the<br>
electrodes.   The results for the electrodes prepared by the process described in the present invention are given in Table-1<br>
