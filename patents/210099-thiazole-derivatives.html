				<td>THIAZOLE DERIVATIVES<br>
The present invention refates to certain novel compounds. In particular, the present invention relates to compounds that activate human peroxisome proliferator activated receptors ("hPPARs"). The present invention also relates to method for preparing the compounds, their use in medicine, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and methods for the prevention or treatment of PPAR mediated diseases or conditions.<br>
Several independent risk factors have been associated with cardiovascular disease. These include hypertension, increased fibrinogen levels, high levels of triglycerides, elevated LDL cholesterol, elevated total cholesterol, and low levels of HDL cholesterol. HMG CoA reductase inhibitors ("statins") are useful for treating conditions characterized by high LDL-c levels. It has been shown that lowering LDL-c is not sufficient for reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease in some patients, particularly those with normal LDL-c levels. This population pool is identified by the independent risk factor of low HDL-c. The increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with low HDL-c levels has not yet been successfully addressed by drug therapy (i.e. currently there are no drugs on the market that are useful for raising HDL-c'.. (Bisgaier, C. L.; Pape, M. E. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1998, 4, 53-70).<br>
Syndrome X (including metabolic syndrome) is loosely defined as a collection of abnormalities including hyperinsulemta, obesity, elevated levels of triglycerides, uric acid, fibrinogen, small dense LDL particles, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), and decreased levels of HDL-C;.<br>
NIDDM is described as insulin resistance, which in turn causes anomalous glucose output and a decrease in glucose uptake, by skeletal muscle. These factors eventually lead to impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and hyperinsuiinemia.<br>
Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPARs) are orphan receptors belonging to the steroid/retinoid receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. See, for example Willson T.M. and Wahli, W., Curr. Opin. Chem. BioL, 1, pp235-241 (1997) and Willson T.M. et. al., J. Med. Chem., 43, p527-549 (2000). The binding of agonist ligands to the receptor results in changes in the expression level of MRNA's enclded by PPAR target genes.<br>
Three mammalian Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors have been isolated and termed PPAR-alpha, PPAR-gamma, and PPAR-delta (also known as NUC1 or PPAR-beta). These PPARs regulate expression of target genes by binding to DNA sequence elements, termed PPAR response elements (PPRE). To date, PPRE's have been identified in the enhancers of a number of genes encoding proteins that regulate lipid metabolism suggesting that PPARs play a pivotal role in the adipogenic signalling cascade and lipid homeostasis (H. Keller and W. Wahli, Trends Endocrinol. Metab 291-296, 4 (1993)).<br><br><br><br>
2<br>
It has now been reported that thiazolidinediones are potent and selective activators of PPAR-gamma and bind directly to the PPAR-gamma receptor (J. M. Lehmann et. a!., J. Biol. Chem. 12953-12956, 270 (1995)), providing evidence that PPAR-gamma is a possible target for the therapeutic actions of the thiazolidtnediones.<br>
Activators of the nuclear receptor PPARy, for example troglitazone, have been shown in the clinic to enhance insulin-action, reduce serum glucose and have small but significant effects on reducing serum triglyceride levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes. See, for example, D. E. Kelly et a!., Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes, 90-96, 5 (2), (1998); M. D. Johnson et a!., Ann. Pharmacother., 337-348, 32 (3), (1997); and M. Leutenegger etal., Curr. Then Res., 403-416, 58 (7), (1997).<br>
The mechanism for this triglyceride lowering effect appears to be predominantly increased clearance of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) through induction of lipoprotein lip'ase (LPL) gene expression. See, for example, B. Staels et al., Arierioscler. Thromb., Vase. Biol., 1756-1764, 17(9), (1997).<br>
Fibrates are a class of drugs which may lower serum triglycerides 20-50%, lower LDLc 10-15%, shift the LDL particle size from the more atherogenic small dense to normal dense LDL, and increase HDLc 10-15%. Experimental evidence indicates that the effects of fibrates on serum lipids are mediated through activation of PPARcx. See, for example, B. Staels et a!., Curr. Pharm. Des., 1-14, 3 (1), (1997). Activation of PPARoc results in transcription of enzymes that increase fatty acid catabolism and decrease de-novo fatty acid synthesis in the liver resulting in decreased triglyceride synthesis and VLDL production/secretion.  In addition, PPARa activation decreases production of apoC-III. Reduction in apoC-lll, an inhibitor of LPL activity, increases clearance of VLDL. See, for example, J. Auwerx et al., Atherosclerosis, (Shannon, Irel.), S29-S37,124 (Suppl), (1996).<br>
Certain compounds that activate or otherwise interact with one or more of the PPARs have been implicated in the regulation of triglyceride and cholesterol levels in animal models. See, for example, U.S. Patents 5,847,008 (Doebber et al.) and 5,859,051 (Adams et al.) and PCT publications WO 97/28149 (Leibowitz et al.) and WO99/04815 (Shimokawa et al.). In a recent report (Berger et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1999), vol. 274, pp. 6718-6725) it was stated that PPARS activation does not appear to modulate glucose or triglyceride levels.<br>
Accordingly the invention provides a compound of formula 1 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates and hydrolysable esters thereof.<br><br>

As used herein, "a compound of the invention" means a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, or solvate, or hydrolysable ester thereof.<br>
While hydrolyzable esters are included in the scope of this invention, the acids are preferred because the data suggests that while the esters are useful compounds, it may actually be the acids to which they hydrolyse that are the active compounds. Esters that hydrolyse readily can produce the carboxylic acid in the assay conditions or in vivo. Generally the carboxylic acid is active in both the binding and transient transfection assays, while the ester does not usually bind weil but is active in the transient transfection assay presumably due to hydrolysis. Preferred hydrolysable esters are C^ alkyl esters wherein the alkyl group may be straight chain or branched chain. Methyl or ethyl esters are more preferred.<br>

Those skilled in the art will recognize that stereocenters exist in compounds of formula (I). Accordingly, the present invention includes all possible stereoisomers and geometric isomers of formula (I) and includes not only racemlc compounds but this invention is also intended to cover each of these isomers in their racemic, enriched, or purified forms. When a compound of formula (I) is desired as a single enantiomer, it may be obtained either by resolution of the final product or by stereospecific synthesis using an optically active catalyst or a catalytic system with optically active ligands or isomericaily pure starting material or any convenient intermediate. Resolution of the final product, an intermediate or a starting material may be effected by any suitable method known in the art. See, for example. Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds by E. L. Eltel (Mcgraw Hill, 1962) and Tables of Resolving Agents by S. H. Wilen. Additionally, in situations where tautomers of the compounds of formula (I) are possible, the present invention is intended to include all tautomeric forms of the compounds. In particular, in many of the preferred compounds of this invention the carbon atom to which R6 and R7 are bonded is chiral. In some of these chiral compounds the activities at the various PPAR receptors varies between the S and R isomers. Which of these isomers is preferred depends on the particular desired utility of the compound. In other words, even with the same compound, it is possible that the S isomer will be preferred for some uses, while the R isomer will be preferred for others.<br>

References hereinafter to a compound according to the invention include both compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates.<br>
The compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives are conveniently administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. Such compositions may conveniently be presented for use in conventional manner in admixture with one or more physiologically acceptable carriers or excipients.<br>
While it is possible that compounds of the present invention may be therapeutically administered as the raw chemical, it is preferable to present the active ingredient as a pharmaceutical formulation. The carrier(s) must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further provides for a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof<br><br>
10<br>
together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers therefore and, optionally, other therapeutic and/or prophylactic ingredients.<br>
The formulations include those suitable for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous e.g. by injection or by depot tablet, intradermaf, intrathecal, intramuscular e.g. by depot and intravenous), rectal and topical (including dermal, buccal and sublingua!) administration although the most suitable route may depend upon for example the condition and disorder of the recipient. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing into association the compounds ("active ingredient") with the carrier, which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation.<br>
Formulations suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets (e.g. chewable tablets in particular for paediatric administration) each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.<br>
A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a other conventional excipients such as binding agents, {for example, syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, mucilage of starch or polyvinylpyrroiidone), fillers (for example, lactose, sugar, microcrystalline cellulose, maize-starch, calcium phosphate or sorbitol), lubricants (for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, talc, polyethylene glycol or silica), disintegrants (for example, potato starch or sodium starch glycollate) or wetting agents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein. The tablets may be coated according to methods well-known in the art.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the present invention may be incorporated into oral liquid preparations such as aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, for example. Moreover, formulations containing these compounds may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents such as sorbitol syrup, methyl cellulose, glucose/sugar syrup, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminum stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents such as lecithin, sorbitan mono-<br><br>
11<br>
oleate or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils) such as almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters, propylene glycol or ethyl alcohol; and preservatives such as methyl or propyl p~hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid. Such preparations may also be formulated as suppositories, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.<br>
The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of a sterile liquid carrier, for example, water-for-injection, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.<br>
Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with the usual carriers such as cocoa butter, hard fat or polyethylene glycol.<br>
Formulations for topical administration in the mouth, for example buccally or sublingually, include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavoured basis such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising the active ingredient in a basis such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia.<br>
The compounds may also be formulated as depot preparations. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
In addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavouring agents.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that reference herein to treatment extends to prophylaxis as well as the treatment of established diseases or symptoms. Moreover, it will be appreciated that the amount of a compound of the invention required for use in treatment will vary with the nature of the condition being treated and the age and the condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment will typically be in the range of 0.02-5000 mg per day, preferably 1-1500 mg per day. The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more<br><br>
12<br>
sub-doses per day. The formulations according to the invention may contain between 0.1-99% of the active ingredient, conveniently from 30-95% for tablets and capsules and 3-50% for liquid preparations.<br>
The compound of formula (I) for use in the instant invention may be used in combination with other therapeutic agents for example, statins and/or other lipid lowering drugs for example MTP inhibitors and LDLR upreguiators. The compounds of the invention may also be used in combination with antidiabetic agents, e.g. metformin, sulfonyiureas and/or PPAR gamma, PPAR alpha or PPAR alpha/gamma agonists (for example thiazolidinediones such as e.g. Pioglitazone and Rosiglitazone). The compounds may also be used in combination with antihypertensive agents such as angistensin antagonists e.g. telmisartan, calcium channel antagonists e.g. lacidipine and ACE inhibitors e.g. enalapril. The invention thus provides in a further aspect the use of a combination comprising a compound of formula (I) with a further therapeutic agent in the treatment of a hPPAR mediated disease.<br>
When the compounds of formula (I) are used in combination with other therapeutic agents, the compounds may be administered either sequentially or simultaneously by any convenient route.<br>
The combinations referred to above may conveniently be presented for use in the form of a pharmaceutical formulation and thus pharmaceutical formulations comprising a combination as defined above optimally together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient comprise a further aspect of the invention. The individual components of such combinations may be administered either sequentially or simultaneously in separate or combined pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
When combined in the same formulation it will be appreciated that the two compounds must be stable and compatible with each other and the other components of the formulation and may be formulated for administration. When formulated separately they may be provided in any convenient formulation, conveniently in such a manner as are known for such compounds in the art.<br>
When a compound of formula (I) is used in combination with a second therapeutic agent active against the same hPPAR mediated disease, the dose of each compound may differ from that when the compound is used alone. Appropriate doses will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
Compounds of this invention may be conveniently prepared by a general process wherein a moiety like A is coupled to an alcohol (B and D) using the Mitsunobu protocol (O. Mitsunobu, 1981 Synthesis, p 1) or by alkylation of A using a suitable non nucleophilic base such as K2CO3, Cs2CO3 or NaH, with an alkyl halide (C, E and F). Note that this synthesis is preferably carried out with the acid group protected by R. Preferably, R is 1-6 alkyl which can be hydrolysed to give an acid of Formula (I), or if readily hydrolyzable, the resulting ester can be administered.<br><br>

Binding Assay:<br>
Compounds were tested for their ability to bind to hPPAR gamma hPPARialpha or PPARdelta using a Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA). The PPAR ligand binding domain (LBD) was expressed in E. coli as poiyHis tagged fusion proteins and purified. The LBD was then labelled with biotin and immobilised on streptavidin-modified scintillation proximity beads. The beads were then incubated with a constant amount of the appropriate radioligand {3H-BRL 49653 for PPARgamma, radiolabelled 2-{4-(2-(2,3-Ditritfo-1-heptyl-3-(2,4-<br>
difluorophenyl)ureido)ethyl)phenoxy^2-methylbutanoic acid for hPPAR alpha {see WO 00/08002J and labelled GW 2433 (see Brown, P, J et al. Chem. Biol., 4, 909-918 (1997). For the structure and synthesis of this ligand) for PPAR delta) and variable concentrations of test compound, and after equilibration the radioactivity bound to the beads was measured by a scintillation counter. The amount of nonspecific binding, as assessed by control wells containing 50 py of the corresponding unlabeled ligand, was subtracted from each data point. For each compound tested, plots of ligand concentration vs. CPM of radioligand bound were constructed and apparent KI values were estimated from nonlinear least squares fit of the data assuming simple competitive binding. The details of this assay have been reported elsewhere (see, Blanchard, S. G. et. al. Development of a Scintillation Proximity Assay for Peroxisome Proliferator-Aciwaied Receptor gamma Ligand Binding Domain. Anal. Biochem,, 257,112-119 (1998)).<br>
Transfection assay:<br>
Compounds were screened for functional potency in transient transfection assays In CV-1 cells for their ability to activate the PPAR subtypes (transactivation assay). A previously established chimerie receptor system was utilized to allow comparison of the relative transcriptional activity of the receptor subtypes on the same target gene and to prevent endogenous receptor activation from complicating the interpretation of results. See, for example, Lehmann, J. M.; Moore, L. B.; Smith-Oliver. T. A.; Wilkison, W. O.; Wiilson, T. M.; Kliewer, S. A., An antidiabetic thiazoitdinedione is a high affinity iigand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgammaJ, J. Biol. Chem., 270,12953-6 (1995). The ligand binding domains for murine and human PPAR alpha, PPAR gamma, and PPAR delta were each fused to the yeast transcription factor GAL4 DNA binding domain. CV-1 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors for the respective PPAR chimera along with a reporter construct containing five copies of the GAL4 DNA binding site driving expression of secreted placenta! alkaline phosphafase (SPAP) and beta-gafacfosidase. After 16 h, the medium was exchanged to DME medium supplemented with 10% deiipidated fetal calf serum and the test compound at the appropriate concentration. After an additional 24h, cell extracts were prepared and assayed for<br><br>
52<br>
alkaline phosphatase and p-galactosidase activity. Alkaline phosphatase activity was corrected for transfection efficiency using the beta-galactosidase activity as an internal standard (see, for example, Kliewer, S. A., et. al. Cell 83, 813-819 (1995)). Rosiglitazone (BRL 49653) was used as a positive control in the hPPAR gamma assay. The positive control in the hPPAR alpha assays was 2-methy!-2-[4-{[(4-methyl-2-[4-trifluoromethylphenyI]-thiazol-5-yl-carbonyl)amino]methyl}-phenoxyjpropionic acid. The positive control for PPAR delta assays was 2-{2-methyl-4-[({4-methyI-2-{trifluoromethyl)phenyIJ-1,3-th iazol-5-yl}methyl)sulfanyl]phenoxy}acetic acid.<br>
