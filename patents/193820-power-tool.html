				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention is related to a very low-cost welding screen for<br>
use by the Mammal Metal Arc (MMA) welders of industrially developing<br>
countries.<br>
The hand-held welding screen, as available in the Market and<br>
generally used by the Indian MMA welders, consists of an opaque body<br>
with a window, near its top portion at the front, fitted with an<br>
ultra-violet (uv) glass filter and two glass filter-covers of<br>
specified sizes, which allows the welder to see the welding operation,<br>
yet prevents the harmful uv radiations to fall on their eyes, and a<br>
handle to hold by hand, attached to the bottom portion at the back.<br>
The use of the existing welding screen leads to reduced efficiency<br>
and performance and creates several hazardous problems for the MMA<br>
welders, such as :<br>
i) During work, a right handed MMA welder protects his eyes and<br>
face from the uv and thermal radiations by bringing the welding<br>
screen, held by the left hand, in front of the face and removing it<br>
when the arc is off to see the work. This resulted in unnecessary and<br>
continuous holding and carrying of the welding screen and also a<br>
large number of hand movements throughout the day's work causing an<br>
early fatigue, which could be avoided.<br>
ii) The existing welding screens keep the left hand of right handed<br>
welders always engaged, thus involving in static muscular work with<br>
the heavy screen, which leads to quick fatigue.<br>
iii) Most of the existing screens are not suitable to give<br>
complete protection of the faces and eyes of the MMA welders from the<br>
thermal and uv radiations, flying hot metal spatters and hot, toxic<br>
fumes coming from the arc. This resulted in a large number of eye and<br>
skin injuries and burns, and other impairments of the MMA welders.<br>
iv) Very poor ambient ventilation in between the welders' breathing<br>
zone and the screen causes inhalation of hot, toxic fumes coming from<br>
the arc, resulting in serious respiratory distress and illness.<br>
v) The welders' visibility through the screen is very poor causing<br>
difficulties in essential viewing of the tip of the electrode, the<br>
work and the working areas during welding.<br>
vi) While working within the shop-floors, there are every chance of<br>
stray objects or other materials falling from the overhead travelling<br>
and other cranes or due to people at overhead work.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide a new design<br>
of a welding screen for the MMA welders, which can remove most of the<br>
abovementioned difficulties and problems. The new, ergonomic welding<br>
screen would also provide better occupational safety and health of the<br>
MMA welders leading to enhancement of their efficiency, performance<br>
and productivity.<br>
i) The handle of an existing design of a welding screen was removed<br>
and the screen was fixed to a safety helmet so that it could be fitted<br>
on to the head of an MMA welder to make his left hand free to perform<br>
other work. Thus Muscular fatigue of the left hand caused by the<br>
static work in continuous holding the heavy protective screen could be<br>
avoided.<br>
ii) The inner surface of the helmet is fitted with an "adjustable<br>
head-band so that people with different coronal circumferences could<br>
wear it without any difficulty. The new design is also fitted with an<br>
adjustable chin-strap and a leather chin-piece.<br>
iii) As the screen is fitted on to the head, it remains much closer<br>
to the welder. As a result, the visual field through the screen was<br>
three times more than that with the existing one.<br>
iv) The screen was fitted to the safety helmet in such a way that<br>
the screen could be lifted up over the helmet when it was not in use.<br>
When required, a slight nodding of the head would put it back into the<br>
position suitable for welding.<br>
v) For a better view of the surroundings and the tip of the<br>
electrode and also during inspection, grinding and chipping tasks, the<br>
welder could also lift the screen up over the helmet instead of<br>
removing it from the head. This process of lifting the screen not only<br>
provides better view of the work-site but also facilitates better and<br>
effective ambient ventilation for the welders.<br>
vi) A number of holes are also made on the helmet for better<br>
ventilation. Some holes are made on the two sides of the raised<br>
portion of the top of the helmet, one further away from the other on<br>
the opposite side in a zig-zag pattern to avoid reducing its<br>
structural strength. Other holes are made on the lower portion of the<br>
back of the helmet in a similar pattern. The position of the holes are<br>
selected in such a way that the arc rays, fumes or spatters could not<br>
enter the helmet through these holes. During welding, the air within<br>
the screen becomes quite hot and passes out through the holes made on<br>
the helmet and relatively cooler air then enters the screen. This also<br>
prevents misting of the glass window. If any fumes enter by chance,<br>
this could also be passed out easily.<br>
vii) A light-weight wooden box frame is fitted to the window of the<br>
welding screen.<br>
viii) In the wooden box frame, four grooves are cut. In the first<br>
(the anterior most) and the fourth (the posterior most) grooves, two<br>
ordinary glasses are fitted with the sides sealed to prevent the entry<br>
of hot, toxic fumes coming from the arc.<br>
ix) One standard sized ultra-violet (uv) protective glass filter is<br>
cut longitudinally into three nearly equal segments. In one of these<br>
segments, two small holes are made just at the two upper corners.<br>
x) In the second groove of the wooden box frame, two of the three<br>
segments of the uv protective glass filter are fitted and sealed in<br>
such a way that one piece could be at the top of the groove and the<br>
other one at the bottom. The gap between them would be slightly less<br>
than the width of the remaining third segment.<br>
xi) In the third groove, the uv protective glass segment having- two<br>
holes, is hung is such a way that it could fill up or just<br>
overlap the gap and can be moved up and down easily. It is then<br>
connected to a leather chin-piece with the help of two small, light-<br>
weight, flexible, nylon cords which pass over two very small and<br>
light-weight aluminium pulleys fitted onto the left and right sides of<br>
the upper part of the welding screen just over the wooden box frame.<br>
xii) A small downward movement of the chin with the leather chin-<br>
piece raises the small portion of the uv protective g-lass filter<br>
segment so that the welder, without removing the screen, could see the<br>
electrode-tips and the objects to be welded, through the gap. The<br>
newly recruited MMA welders may need some special training and<br>
practice to acquire the desired skill for the jaw movements necessary<br>
to use the new welding screen. In the traditional method, the hand<br>
held screen has to be removed from the visual field for the same<br>
purpose of enabling the welder to see the electrode tips, etc. Thus<br>
the new design provides better protection of the MMA welders from the<br>
uv and thermal radiations, flying hot metal spatters and hot, toxic<br>
fumes coming from the arc.<br>
xiii) In the new design, the wooden box frame of the window could<br>
easily be removed and the uv g-lass filters cleaned and plain glass<br>
covers replaced, as and when required, for regular maintenance.<br>
xiv) In the alternative prototype design which is specially suitable<br>
for over-head work, the two-pulleys system has been replaced by a two-<br>
springs system.<br>

fixed to the upper and lower parts of the of the wooden frame<br>
respectively. Another uv protective g-lass filter segment, 'uv3', can<br>
slide up and down within the wooden box frame. The nylon cords, 'NC's.<br>
are tied onto the two upper corners of the 'uv3' and pass over the<br>
two aluminium pulleys, 'P's, and enter the screen through the<br>
holes, 'H's.<br>
Figure 2 is the schematic diagram of the front view of the screen<br>
and the safety helmet, where the uv protective movable filter glass<br>
segment (uv3) has been lifted upwards by a downward movement of the<br>
chin and thereby creates an opening '0' through which the welder can<br>
see the work.<br>
Figure 3 is the schematic diagram of the side view of the screen<br>
and the safety helmet, where 'S' is the safety helmet fitted to the<br>
welding screen. It has a number of holes ('HS's) for better<br>
ventilation. 'HB' is the adjustable head-band of the safety helmet.<br>
Figure 4 is the schematic diagram of the side view of the screen<br>
and the safety helmet, where the screen has been lifted over the<br>
helmet, showing 'CS' as the adjustable chin-strap and 'CH' as the<br>
leather piece fitting the chin.<br>

of the window could easily be removed and the glass filters cleaned<br>
and plain glass covers replaced, as and when required, for regular<br>
maintenance.<br>
7. The welding screen as claimed in 1 wherein, an alternative<br>
design suitable for over-head work replaces the two-pulleys system<br>
by a two-springs system.<br>
8. The welding screen as claimed in 1 provides better protection of<br>
the faces and eyes of the welders from the thermal and uv radiations,<br>
flying hot metal spatters and hot, toxic fumes coming from the arc<br>
resulting in reduction of a large number of eye and skin injuries,<br>
heat burns, respiratory distress, illness, etc.<br>
9. The welding screen as claimed in 1 makes the left hand of the<br>
MMA welders free to perform other work, thus muscular fatigue of the<br>
left hand caused by the static work in continuous holding- the heavy<br>

The present invention, the new, ergonomic welding screen, is of<br>
low-cost and suitable for use by the Manual Metal Arc (MMA) welders of<br>
industrially developing countries as compared to the extremely costly<br>
and sophisticated electronic type of photochromatic welding screen at<br>
present being used by the MMA welders of industrially developed<br>
countries.<br>
The welding screen could be fitted onto the head of the manual<br>
metal arc (MMA) welders to increase their field of vision through the<br>
screen and also to make their left hand free to perform other work.<br>
The screen itself is fitted to a safety helaet to protect the welders<br>
from overhead stray objects and other materials falling on the head.<br>
The screen could be lifted over the helmet when it is not in use. When<br>
required, a slight nodding of the head could put it back into the<br>
welding position. Arrangements have been made so that a small downward<br>
movement of the chin lifts a small portion of the ultra-violet (uv)<br>
protective glass filter and thus enables the welder to fit the<br>
electrode to the holder, to see the electrode-tips and the working<br>
site, without removing the screen from the head as is done with the<br>
existing screen. The new design provides better protection from the<br>
spatters and hot, toxic fumes coming from the arc resulting in<br>
enhancement of their efficiency, performance and productivity and<br>
improvement of the occupational safety and health of the MMA welders.<br></td>
