NOVEL CYSTEINE PROTEASE INHIBITORS AND THEIR THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS<br>
The present invention concerns new inhibitors of cysteine proteases, their process of preparation and their therapeutic use.<br>
Protease can be categorized based on their substrate specificities or mechanisms of catalysis. Upon the basis of the mechanism of peptide hydrolysis, five major protease classes are known: serine, cysteine, aspartic, threonine and metalJo-proteases. Cysteine proteases comprise, inter allia, de-ubiquitination enzymes, caspases, cathepsins, calpains as well as viral, bacterial or parasitic cysteine proteases.<br>
De-ubiquitination enzymes include Ubiquitin Specific Proteases (USPs) and Ubiquitin Carboxy Hydrolases (UCHs). Broadly speaking, the ubiquitin pathway regulates protein degradation and is more particularly involved in cancer, in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, in inflammation, in viral infectivity and latency (in particular for Herpes simplex virus-1, Epstein-Barr virus, SARS coronavirus), or in cardiovascular diseases {Chem, Rev, 1997, 97, p. 133-171; Chem. Rev, 2002, 102. p. 4459-4488; J. Biochem. 2003, 134. p. 9-18 ; J. Virology, 2005, 79(7), p. 4550-4551; Cardiovasc. Res. 2004, 61, p. 11-21).<br>
Caspases have been shown to be involved in apoptosis and hence are targets in hepatitis, liver failure, inflammation, cardiac ischemia and failure, renal failure, neurodegeneration, deafness, diabetes, or stroke (J. Pharmacol Exp. Ther., 2004, 308(3), p. 1191-1196, J. Cell. Physiol, 2004, 200(2), p. 177-200; Kidney Int, 2004, 66(2), p. 500-506; Am. J. Pathol., 2004, 165(2), p. 353-355; Mini Rev. Chem., 2004, 4(2), p. 153-165; Otol Neurotol, 2004, 25(4), p. 627-632; Ref. 7, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.<br>
Cathepsins generally have been shown to be involved in cancer and metastasis, inflammation, immunology/immunoregulation {Eur Respin J., 2004,<br><br>
23(4), p. 620-628) and atherosclerosis (Ageing Res. Rev.. 2003, 2(4). p. 407-418). More particularly, cathepsins include cathepsin B and B-like which are implicated in cancer and metastasis, and arthritis {Cancer Metastasis Rev., 2003, 22(2-3), p. 271-286; BioL Cham., 2003, 384(6), p. 845-854 and Biochem. Soc. Symp., 2003, 70, p. 263-276), cathepsin D, involved in particular in cancer and metastasis {din. Exp. metastasis, 2004, 21(2), p. 91-106), cathepsin K acting in osteoporosis and arthritis {Int J. Pharm,, 2004, 277(1-2), p. 73-79), cathepsin S which has been shown to play a role in antigen presentation in immunology {Drug News Perspective, 2004, 17(6), p. 357-363).<br>
Calpains play a role in aging in general {Ageing Res. Rev. 2003, 2(4), p. 407-418), as well as diabetes (/Wo/. Cell. Biociiem., 2004, 261(1), p.161-167) and cataract {Trends MoL Med, 2004, 10(2), p. 78-84) more particularly.<br>
Viral cysteine proteases have been identified in rhinoviruses, poliomyelitis virus, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis C virus, adenovirus, or SARS coronavirus (CA?em. Rev. 1997, 97, p. 133-171; Chem. Rev. 2002, 102, p. 4459-4488 ; J. Virology, 2005, 79(7), p. 4550-4551 and Acta MicrobioL Immunol. Hung., 2003, 50(1), p. 95-101).<br>
Bacterial cysteine proteases include streptopain, staphylococcal cysteine protease, clostripain or gingipains; yeasts such as Aspergillus flavus have also been shown to express cysteine proteases which may constitute a virulence factor (C/7e/77. Rev^. 1997, 97, p. 133-171).<br>
Parasitic cysteine proteases have been reviewed in Molecular &amp; Biochemical Parasitology (2002, 120, p. 1-21) and Chem. Rev. (2002, 102, p. 4459-4488) for example. It is worth noting that the parasitic agents responsible for most major parasitic diseases are making use of their own cysteine proteases at some point or another of their infective, nutritive or reproductive cycles; such diseases include malaria, Chagas' disease, African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, giardiasis, trichomoniasis, amoebiasis, crypto-<br><br>
sporidiasis,  toxoplamiasis,  schistosomiasis,  fasciolasis,  onchocercosis,  and other infections by some other flat or round worms.<br>
Therefore, identifying a novel class of inhibitors of cysteine proteases is of significant importance in a wide range of diseases and pathological conditions.<br>
Cyano-pyrazine derivatives have been disclosed, mainly as charge-transporting agents for electrophotographic photoreceptors (WO03/055853, JP200128885, JP200122316, JP07281460, JP07179440, JP07098508, JP06345742, JP07175235, JP07199487, JP07199486, JP07281460 and Helvetica Chemica Acta, 1986, 69(4), 793-802, Tetrahedron Letters 1974, 45, 3967-70, J. Heteterocyclic Chemistry, "[Qll, 9(6), 1399-401, Tetraliedron Letters, 1990, 31(49), 7215-18). However, it has never been disclosed nor suggested that cyano-pyrazine derivatives can inhibit cysteine proteases.<br>

The compounds of the general formula (1) having geometrical and stereoisomers are also a part of the invention.<br>
According to a further object, the present invention is also concerned with the process of preparation of the compounds of formula (I).<br>
The compounds and process of the present invention may be prepared in a number of ways well known to those skilled in the art. The compounds can be synthesized, for example, by application or adaptation of the methods described below, or variations thereon as appreciated by the skilled artisan. The appropriate modifications and substitutions will be readily apparent and well known or readily obtainable from the scientific literature to those skilled in the art.<br>
In particular, such methods can be found in R.C. Larock, Compreliensive Organic Transformations, Wiley-VCH Publishers, 1999.<br>
It will be appreciated that the compounds of the present invention may contain one or more asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms, and may be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. Thus, all chiral, diastereomeric, racemic forms and all geometric isomeric forms of a structure are intended, unless the specific stereochemistry or isomeric form is specifically indicated. It is well known in the art how to prepare and isolate such optically active forms. For example, mixtures of stereoisomers may be separated by standard techniques including, but not limited to, resolution of racemic forms, normal, reverse-phase, and chiral chromatography, preferential salt formation, recrystallization, and the like, or by chiral synthesis either from chiral starting materials or by deliberate synthesis of target chiral centers.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be prepared by a variety of synthetic routes. The reagents and starting materials are commercially available, or readily synthesized by well-known techniques by one of ordinary skill in the arts. All substituents, unless otherwise indicated, are as previously defined.<br><br>
In the reactions described hereinafter, it may be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, imino, thio or carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice, for examples see T.W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts in Protective Groups in Organic Cliemistry, 3^^ ed., John Wiley and Sons, 1999; J. F. W. McOmie in Protective Groups in Organic Ciiemistry, Plenum Press, 1973.<br>
Some reactions may be carried out in the presence of a base. There is no particular restriction on the nature of the base to be used in this reaction, and any base conventionally used in reactions of this type may equally be used here, provided that it has no adverse effect on other parts of the molecule. Examples of suitable bases include: sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, triethylamine, alkali metal hydrides, such as sodium hydride and potassium hydride; aikyllithium compounds, such as methyllithium and butyllithium; and alkali metal alkoxides, such as sodium methoxide and sodium ethoxide.<br>
Usually, reactions are carried out in a suitable solvent. A variety of solvents may be used, provided that it has no adverse effect on the reaction or on the reagents involved. Examples of suitable solvents include: hydrocarbons, which may be aromatic, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, such as hexane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene and xylene; amides, such as dimethylformamide; alcohols such as ethanol and methanol and ethers, such as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The reactions can take place over a wide range of temperatures. In general, we find it convenient to carry out the reaction at a temperature of from 0°C to 150X (more preferably from about room temperature to 100X). The time required for the reaction may also vary widely, depending on many factors, notably the reaction temperature and the nature of the reagents. However, provided that the reaction is effected under the preferred conditions outlined above, a period of from 3 hours to 20 hours will usually suffice.<br>
The compound thus prepared may be recovered from the reaction mixture by conventional means. For example, the compounds may be recovered by distilling<br><br>
off the solvent from the reaction mixture or, if necessary after distilling off the solvent from the reaction mixture, pouring the residue into water followed by extraction with a water-immiscible organic solvent and distilling off the solvent from the extract. Additionally, the product can, if desired, be further purified by various well known techniques, such as recrystallization, reprecipitation or the various chromatography techniques, notably column chromatography or preparative thin layer chromatography.<br>
