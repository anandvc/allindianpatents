				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to telecommunications networks, in which subsribers are allowed to select a long distance carrier for a call.<br>
It is typical for modern communications systems that there are multiple network operators or service pro¬viders. For example there may one or more local telephone networks and operators in each city. Similarly, there may be several long distance networks or carriers for making long distance calls between the local telephone networks or for making international calls. A user has normally a subscription to one of the local telephone networks, but is able to select a long distance carrier in a call by call basis, by dialling a predetermined access code or prefix. In the USA, for example, there is a feature called Equal Access which provides a way to the subscriber to select whatever long distance carrier he/she wants to use when making long distance or international calls. Each long distance carrier is uniquely identified by a digital code called Carrier Identification Code (CIC), according to the North American Numbering Plan (NAMP) . The user dials the CIC by means of an other digital code, called Carrier Access Code (CAC). The CAC sequence is of the form lOxxx, where XXX is the 3-digit CIC and 10 is the prefix indicating that CIC will be following. In near future the CIC will be extended to a 4-digit code and the prefix will then be 101, the CAC being then lOlXXXX.<br>
In the USA there is under development the Personal Communications System (PCS) 1900 which is a wireless cel¬lular network based on the European digital mobile com-<br><br>
medication system GSM (Global System for Mobile Communica¬tions) . When implementing the Equal Access feature in the PCS, a Preferred Carrier Id (PIC) is added to subscriber profile, i.e subsriber data stored in the subscriber data base (HLR) which is normally used. The long distance call is then as a default rule routed to the long distance car¬rier indicated by the PIC. The PIC will also apply in the case of call forwarding. The forwarded leg of the call will be routed by using the PIC. During location update procedure, for example, the PIC is transferred to the vi¬sited subscriber data base (VLR) . This PIC is then used when the subscriber makes calls while roaming. If the subscriber wants to use other than the preferred carrier, he/she can override the preferred carrier by dialling the CAC before the destination number (B-number).<br>
This so called "casual dialling" may cause problems to the operator of the local network, if the operator should know exactly the total cost of the calls. The ope¬rator may, for example, have service packages where it is needed that the long distance carrier is known by the ope¬rator. Such service may be, for example, a prepaid subscription, i.e. the subscriber has paid the usage of the service in advance. Since normally the charging of the long distance carrier is independent from that of the lo¬cal operator, the operator should exactly know the long distance carrier and the charging thereof, in order to be able to monitor the usage of the prepaid fund. In many cases the companies pay the usage of the mobile phones of their employees. If the company has a deal with one of the long distance operators for a special rate, the casual dialling which allows the user to select any of the long distance carriers may cause extra costs to the company. Therefore, there is a need to control the casual dialling and the selection of the long distance carriers for the calls.<br><br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
An object of the invention is to enable the opera¬tor to control the subscriber"s long distance carrier usa¬ge.<br>
A new subscriber-specific parameter, a locking pa¬rameter, is added to the subscriber data by the operator, in addition to the preferred long distance carrier access code. The locking parameter defines whether said subscri¬ber is allowed to select the long distance carrier for the call or not. The locking parameter is checked each time the subscriber dials the long distance carrier access code during an originating call setup. In an embodiment of the invention, if the locking parameter indicates the subscri¬ber is not allowed to select the long distance carrier, the call setup will be always terminated, preferably af¬ter making an announcement for informing the subscriber of the cause of the termination. In an other embodiment of the invention, if the locking parameter indicates the subscriber is not allowed to select the long distance car¬rier, the call setup will be continued only when the dial¬led and preferred long distance access codes do match. In both of the above embodiments the long distance call will be made using the preferred long distance carrier access code, if only a destination number with no long distance carrier access code is dialled by the subscriber. By means of the locking parameter the operator is able to selecti¬vely lock any subscriber to use the preferred long distan¬ce carrier so that the subscriber can not override the preferred carrier by making the casual dialling.<br>
When the subscriber is roaming, the preferred car¬rier information, i.e the preferred carrier access code and the locking parameter of the subscriber, is transfer¬red to a subscriber data base of visited network, for example with other subscriber data during a standard local-<br><br>
talon update prpjee_dure. If the visited network supports the feature, the preferred carrier access code and the locking parameter maybe used in a similar manner as in the home network.<br>
In some cases the preferred carrier information of the roaming subscriber may not be available in the visited network. This may occur, for example, when the home net¬work of the roaming subscriber is not supporting the fea¬ture, or when the preferred carrier information is not transferred for some reason, such as inter-operator agree¬ments. However, the operator of the visited network may wish to control the long distance carrier usage of the roaming subscribers. According to a still further embodi¬ment of the invention, the visited operator assigns a de¬fault preferred long distance carrier access code for a home network whose subscribers roaming in the visited net¬work. In the absence of the suberiber"s preferred carrier information, this network-specific default may be used instead.<br>
In still another embodiment of the invention the network- default may override the subscriber"s preferred carrier information, although the latter is available. The visited operator may assign to a home net¬work a new network-spesific parameter, a preferred carrier relation parameter, which controls the selection between the subscriber"s preferred carrier access code and the network default. The preferred carrier relation parameter may, for example, indicate one of the following alternati¬ves to handle subscribers roaming from a spesific network: 1) use the subscriber"s preferred carrier access code, if available, 2) use the subscriber"s preferred carrier ac¬cess code only, 3) use the network default only.<br>
In a still further embodiment of the invention, the visited operator may assign to a home network a default locking parameter. In absence of the subscriber"s locking<br><br>
parameter, this network-spesific default may be used ins¬tead. In still another embodiment of the invention the network-spesific default may override the subscriber"s locking parameter information, although the latter is available. The visited operator may assign to a home net¬work a new network-spesific parameter, a locking relation parameter, which controls the selection between the subsc¬riber"s locking parameter and the network default. The locking relation parameter may, for example, indicate one of the following alternatives to handle subscribers roa¬ming from a specific network: 1) use the subscriber"s locking parameter only, or 2) use the network default on¬ly-<br>
The inventive parametrization allows to the visited operator to control in different way subscribers from dif¬ferent networks, based on the agreement between the opera¬tors, for example. The default parameters can be used to control subscribers from a network which does not support the inventive long distance carrier locking feature. The invention also allows to control different way those subscribers of a specific network who does not have the preferred carrier code (old subscribers) and/or the locking parameter, and those who have (new subscribers). The inventive relation parameters may control the former subscriber"s to use the network defaults and the latter subscriber"s to use the subscriber"s own parameters. The operator may utilize the network-spesific parametrization also to its own subscribers, if desired. The default pre¬ferred carrier access code and/or the locking relation parameter will then be assigned also the operator"s own network. This can be applied particularly well to a net¬work having a home subscriber database and (a) visitor subscriber database(s), such as HLR and VLR in the PCS and GSM systems.<br>
Each subscriber may have one or multiple locking<br><br>
parameters. For example, different tale and/or bearer services of the subscriber, such as speech and data, may have dedicated locking parameters. This approach enables to lock the long distance carrier for data calls but allows the casual dialling for other types of calls.<br>
The invention may be applied also in call forwarding activations to reject or allow a long distance carrier access code in the forwarded-to-number inputted by the subscriber.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a method of controlling a long distance call setup in a communications system, comprising steps of determining a preferred long distance carrier, determining a locking parameter, said locking parameter defining whether a subscriber is allowed to select the long distance carrier for the call or not, checking, in response to receiving a destination number dialled by said subscriber during the call set up whether a long distance carrier access code is dialled by said subscriber, and continuing the call setup via said preferred long distance carrier, when no long distance carrier access code is dialled by said subscriber, or checking said locking parameter when a long distance carrier access code is dialled by said subscriber, and deciding on the continuation or the termination of the call setup on the basis of said locking parameter.<br>
The present invention also provides a wireless network, comprising at least one subscriber data base for storing subscriber data for mobile subscribers, said subscriber data base containing at least one locking parameter, said locking parameter defining whether a mobile subscriber is allowed to select the long distance carrier for the call or not, at least one switching centre for checking in<br><br>
response to a destination number dialled by a subscriber during a call setup, whether a long distance carrier access code is dialled by said subscriber, for continuing the call setup via a predetermined preferred long distance carrier, when no long distance carrier access code is dialled by said subscriber, for checking said locking parameter, when a long distance carrier access code is dialled by said subscriber, and for deciding on the continuation or the termination of the call setup on the basis of said locking parameter.<br>

Preferred    embodiments    of    the    invention.<br>
The present invention is particularly applicable in wireless communication systems but it may as well be ap¬plied in fixed networks, such as ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) or PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Net¬work) , for providing the network operator with means for controlling the long distance carrier selection made by individual subscribers. In the fixed networks the inven¬tion is particularly applicable for controlling the subsc¬ribers of the PABXs (private automatic branch exchange) in the long distance carrier selection. The PABX maybe a wi¬red or wireless PABX.<br>
The type of the long distance network or carrier is not relevant to the present invention. The countries in the Northern America, whose country code is "1", are cal¬led commonly World Zone 1. This includes the USA, Canada and some smaller countries. A long distance network or carrier authorized to provide interexchange communications between local telephone networks within World Zone 1 is called an interexchange carrier (IXC). A long distance network or carrier authorized provide interexchange tele¬communications services outside World Zone 1 using inter¬national dialling plan, is called an international carrier (INC) . A common term, a long distance carrier, will be used to refer both the IXC and INC in the following desc¬ription. In other countries there maybe different ter¬minology in use for the interexchange and international carriers.<br>
Examples of the wireless communications systems are the GSM system, UMTS (Universal Mobile Communication Sys¬tem) and PCS (Personal Communication System). In the fol-<br><br>
lowing the invention will be described with reference to PCS 1900 network. As noted above, the PCS is based on GSM system, and therefore, the operation and structure of the network is quite similar to GSM. The basic structure and basic operation of the GSM mobile radio system are well known by a person skilled in the art and detaily defined in the GSM specifications of the international telecom¬munications standard institute (ETSI) . For detail descrip¬tion of the GSM system, a reference is made to the GSM specifications and to the book "the GSM system for mobile communications" M. Mouly and M. Pautet, Palaiseau, France.<br>
In Fig.l, there are shown personal communication networks PCNl, PCN2, and PCN3 which are wireless local networks, and a local PSTN as well as long distance net¬works 1...N.<br>
In PCNl a personal services switching center PCSC (a mobile services switching center MSC in the GSM system) switches incoming and outcoming calls. The functions of the PCSC are partly similar to those of the end office EO (an exchange) in the PSTN. In addition the PCSC has func¬tions typical to only mobile communications, such as subscriber location management, paging, out identication, etc. Personal stations PS (mobile radio stations MS in the GSM system) are connected to the PCSC by means of radio systems RA (basestation systems BSS in the GSM system). The radio system RA comprises base stations in the PCS system, and a base station controller BSC and base sta¬tions BTS in the GSM system. The operation or structure of the radio system RA is not significant in the present in¬vention point of view, and they will not be described more detailly herein.<br>
Subscriber data, such as location data, are stored permanently in a home location resistor HLR. The HLR also contains the user profiles. The PCNl comprises one or more visitor location registers VLR, each being associated with<br><br>
one or more PCSC area. The VLR is a data base in which subscriber data, i.e. the copies of the original user pro¬file, as stored while the PS is visiting the area of the PCSC.<br>
The two other wireless networks, PCN2 and PCN3, comprise respective network elements.<br>
In Fig. 1 the PCSC are gateway-PCSCs which provide the interworking functions with other networks, such as long distance networks l...n and a local PSTN. The gateway PCSC maybe, for example, a PCSC which is connected to the other networks via access tandems AT.<br>
The equal access is normally embodied in the PCN by introducing the preferred interexchange carrier PIC into the subscriber profile in the HLR and the VLR, as descri¬bed above with the reference to the prior art systems. Ho¬wever, there is no means for the operator of the PCN to control which long distance carrier is selected by the subscriber in the equal access. In the following various embodiments of the invention for enabling this operator"s control will be explained in detail.<br>
Figs. 2A and 2B illustrate first and second embo¬diments of the PCS subscriber profile according to the in¬vention in the subscriber database HLR. In the subscriber profile shown in Fig. 2A there are three basic services for the primary line, each basic service having a dedica¬ted director number MSISDN. The three basic services are assigned a common PIC-1 in accordance with the equal ac¬cess concept. In accordance with the present invention, a new parameter, PICLOCK, is introduced into the subscri¬ber"s profile in the HLR. The value of parameter PICLOCK is either on or off, indicating whether a subscriber is allowed to make a casual dialling for selecting the long distance carrier for the call or not. In the embodiment of the Fig. 2, one IMSI (international mobile subscriber identity) is associated with one PICLOCK parameter, namely<br><br>
PICLOCK-1, except if the IMSI has also an alternate line service ALS, currently preferred as dual numbering. In Fig. 2, the seconday line is assigned a dedicated PIC and a dedicated PICLOCK parameter. The PICLOCK value is de¬cided by the operator or by the in the subscription agree¬ment. The PICLOCK value is always set by the operator. If the subscriber wishes to change the PICLOCK value, he/she las to request the change from the operator, who will ^heck whether the subsriber is authorized to change the parameter value or not.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, shown in Fig. 2B, a dedicated PICLOCK parameter is assigned to each Dearer teleservice, having a dedicated MSISDN (of the subscriber.) For example in Fig. 2B, telephony, data and facsimile services are assigned dedicated directory nunum-Ders MSISDN-1, MSISDN-2, and MSISDN-3, a common PIC para-neter PIC-1, and dedicated PICLOCK parameters PICLOCK-11, PICLOCK-12 and PICLOCK-13, respectively. This approach allows the operator to control the use of long distance ::arriers in different services independently of each ot-ler. For example, the telephony services (the basic servi¬ce code 1) and facsimile services (basic service code 3) nay have the PICLOCK parameter on, and the data service (basic service code 2) may have the PICLOCK parameter off. ^s an further alternative to the embodiment of Fig. 2B, Bach service may have a dedicated PIC parameter.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates for new parameters according to a present invention in the PCN basis information existing in the visitor location register VRL. While the mobile subscriber makes a location updating, the IMSI is mapped to one of the PCNs, which is called the home PCN of the subscriber. Each "home PCN" is assigned a default PIC, PIC relation, default PICLOCK, and PICLOCK relation parame¬ters. In the VRL of the visited PCN, the default PIC de¬fines a default preferred long distance carrier access<br><br>
code (CAC) for the home-PCN by storing only the carrier access code (CIC) part of CAC.<br>
The PIC-relation parameter defines whether the subscriber"s PIC received from the home PCN, or the home-PCN " s default PIC, is used. The PIC relation parameter made, for example, indicate one of the following alterna¬tives to handle subscriber"s roaming from a specific home PCN: 1) use the subscriber"s PIC, if available, 2) use the subscriber"s PIC only, 3) use the network default PIC on¬ly.<br>
A default PICLOCK defines whether the subscribers of the specific home PCN are allowed to make a casual dialling or not, as a default. The PICLOCK relation para¬meter defines whether the subscribers PICLOCK received from the home PCN, or the home PCN"s default PICLOCK, is used. The PICLOCK relation parameter may, for example, indicate one of the following alternatives to handle subscriber"s roaming from a specific home PCN: 1) use the subscriber"s PICLOCK only, 2) use the network default PI¬CLOCK only. The network specific parameters described abo¬ve maybe assigned also for networks own subscribers, in addition -co a visiting subscribers. It should be also no¬ted that default PIC and PIC relation parameters are inde¬pendent from the default PICLOCK and PICLOCK parameters. It is also possible that only default PICLOCK and PICLOCK parameters are used, or even that only default PICLOCK parameters are used for controlling the visiting subscri¬bers .<br>
The flow diagram of Figure 4 illustrates how the extension of the subscriber profile may be established and stored in the VRL. It is assumed that the subscriber is a roaming subscriber from a home PCN whose operator has a roaming agreement with the operator of the visited PCN. It should be noted, however, that a similar procedure may be applied zo   the own subscribers of the visited PCN. It is<br><br>
furher assumed that a location updating request from an unknown subscriber is received by the VLR. In other words, the subscriber, is currently entering the area of VRL, or the HLR has removed his/her subscriber data from the VRL for one reason or another, for example, since the subsc¬riber profile has been changed, or the VRL has defined the present subscriber data to be erroneous, since the net¬work-specific parameters of the home PCN of the subscriber (i.e. for parameters shown in Fig. 3) has been changed in the VLR by the operator. If the location update request is done by a known subscriber, the subscribers data already existing in the VLR will be used.<br>
Wi~h reference to Fig. 4, after receiving the lo¬cation update request from the unknown subscriber (step 31) , the VLR identifies the home PCN of the subscriber from the ZMSI or TMSI (Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identi¬ty) , in s~ep 32, and obtains the subscribers data from the HLR of the identified home PCN. Since the PICLOCK parame¬ter is nc~ a parameter according to the GSM or PCS spefi-cations, "he HLR must know whether the PICLOCK parameter can be sent to the VLR. To this end, a PICLOCK support information is added to the VLR data in the HLR. If the VLR is supporting the PICLOCK functionality, the PICLOCK value is transferred via MAP-protocol from the HLR to the VLR. More particularly, the HLR builds up in a normal man¬ner a MAP protocol message (insert subscriber data) which contain the PICLOCK value when this funtionality is sup¬ported by the VLR. Correspondingly, the MAP-protocol mes¬sage (delete subscriber data), which removes the subscri¬ber data from the VRL, is built up in a normal way except that the PICLOCK value is added when the VLR is supporting the PICLCCK functionality.<br>
Upon receiving the subscriber data from the HLR, the VLR stores other subscribers data than the PICLOCK parameter in a normal way, step 34. In order to set the<br><br>
PICLOCK value, the VLR checks the home PCN"s PICLOCK rela¬tion parameter value stored in the VLR (Fig. 3), steps 35 and 36. If the- PICLOCK relation parameter value is 1, the subscriber"s PICLOCK will always be used (step 39). If the PICLOCK relation parameter is not 1 in the step 36, the default PICLOCK of the home-PCN will always be set as the subscribers PICLOCK (step 40) . This different parameter values allow to make various kinds of roaming agreements, to set the PICLOCK for roaming subscribers whose home-PCN does not support the PICLOCK feature, and to handle subsc¬riber with different kinds of subscribers profiles. Par¬ticularly, the use of parameter values enable an equitable handling of the subscribers in another embodiment of the invention in which there is a dedicated PICLOCK parameter for each service of the subscriber, the PICLOCK parameter will be set so that the PICLOCK relation parameter is checked independently for each service from the network specific information in the VLR, and the PICLOCK parameter value for the service is set as described above with refe¬rence to Fig. 4.<br>
If a default PIC and PIC relation parameters are set to the home PCN of the subscriber in the VRL, the PIC parameter will be set in a similar manner as the PICLOCK. The PIC parameter may be set either prior to or after set¬ting the PICLOCK parameter. The values of the PIC relation parameter and the PICLOCK relation parameter are indepen¬dent from each other.<br>
The flow diagram of Fig. 5 illustrates the opera¬tion of the personal communications switching system PCSC for a personal station originating call. After receiving the call set up message from the personal station PS (the subscriber) via the radio system (step 51), the PCSC ask the subscriber profile from the associated VLR (step 52), and begins to analyze the number dialed by the subscriber (step 53). The analyzes first checks if the dialed number<br><br>
is an emergency number, for example 911 (step 54). If the subscriber dials carrier access code CAC with the emergen¬cy number, the call will be accepted and the call setup will be continued ignoring the CAC (step 56) although the subscriber had the PICLOCK parameter value ON i.e. he or she is not allowed to dial carrier access code CAC.<br>
If the call is not an emergency call in step 54, the number analyzes checks whether the CAC has been dia¬lled or not (step 55). If the dialed number does not con¬tain any CAC, the call set up will continue normally (step 56) .<br>
If the dialled number contains a CAC, the B-number, i.e. the destination number, will be analyzed (step 57). The Examiner may have configured different types of P-num-bers which are handled differently from each other in the call set up. The number types may be carrier access code CAC allowed, carrier access code CAC not allowed, and ig¬nore carrier access code CAC. If the B-number analyzes gives the type ignore CAC (step 58), then the PICLOCK will not be checked anf the call set up will continue normally with the B-number without CAC (step 61).<br>
In certain call types, such as 800, 900, Nil, local and 00 operator calls, the CAC dialing is not allowed, because the dialled number is not supported with CAC.<br>
In these cases the B-number analyzes gives the type CAC not allowed (step 59) . Operator may configure also other calls to this type. If the subscriber dials a carry access code CAC in these call types, the call will be re¬leased with the reason code, which tells that the CAC dia¬ling is not allowed (step 63) . The reason code analysis may define an announcement to be given to the calling subscriber (step 64). The announcement may be a voice mes¬sage or a short message or any other kind of announcement.<br>
Usually the type of the call is CAC allowed (step 60). In this case it is checked whether the PICLOCK is ON<br><br>
or OFF (step 62). If the PICLOCK is OFF, the call setup will continue normally (step 56) . If the PICLOCK is ON, the call will be released with the reason code, which tells that CAC dialing is not allowed (step 63). The rea¬son code analysis may define an announcement to be given to the calling subscriber (step 64). In another embodi¬ment, when the PICLOCK is ON, the number analysis (after step 62) checks whether the dialed CAC is the preferred interexchanged carrier access code. If it is, the call is not released and the call setup will continue normally. If the dialed CAC is not the subscriber"s PIC, the call will be released and an announcement will be given.<br>
The flow diagram of Figure 6 illustrates the use of the inventive PICLOCK parameter in call forwarding activa¬tion procedure. In a step 71 the HLR of the subscriber receives a call forwarding activation request from the PS of the subscriber. In step 72 the HLR analyzes the forwar-ded-to-number in the received call forwarding activation request. If the forward-to-number includes a carrier ac¬cess code CAC in the step 73, the HLR checks from the subscriber"s profile (Figures 2A and 2B) whether the PI¬CLOCK parameter is ON or OFF in step 74. If the PICLOCK is ON, the forwarded-to-number is rejected, call forwarding will not be activated and an announcement will be given to the subscriber (steps 76 and 77). It is also possible that the HLR compares subscriber"s PIC and dialed CAC, and if they match, the call forwarding will be activated although the PICLOCK parameter is ON. If the forward-to-number does not include a CAC, or the PICLOCK parameter is OFF, the HLR continues call forwarding normally (step 75).<br>
Although the invention has been described with re¬ference to the preferred embodiments of the invention, many altenatives, variations and modifications will be apparent to those of ordinary skilled in the art. Those alternatives, variations and modifications are intended to<br><br>
fall within the spirit and through the scope of the inven¬tion.<br><br><br>
