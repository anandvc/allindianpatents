				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>Multiple-In Multiple-Out (MIMO) techniques are used to increase spectral efficiency of a cellular single frequency network. In some embodiments with single transmit antenna per cell, multiple data streams are transmitted from multiple cells, one data stream per set of transmit antennae. The mapping of streams to antenna sets is permuted in time. In this way, user equipment devices (UEs) at cell edges benefit from MIMO, and UEs near cell centers benefit from high carrier-to-interference (C/I) ratio of the signal. In some embodiments, each stream is concurrently transmitted on base layer of a hierarchically modulated signal from one set, and on enhancement layer of a hierarchically modulated signal from another set. The mapping of sets to streams is permuted in time. The UEs at cell edges benefit from MIMO, and the UEs near cell centers benefit from the high C/I to decode both streams from the base and enhancement layers.</td>

QUALCOMM INCORPORATED,<br>
an American company of 5775 Morehouse Drive , San Diego, California 92121-1714, United States of America<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2006/138203	PCT/US2006/022725<br>
TRANSMIT SPATIAL DIVERSITY FOR CELLULAR SINGLE FREQUENCY NETWORKS<br>
Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง119<br>
[0001]	The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application<br>
Serial Number 60/690,622, entitled Transmit Diversity For E-MBMS, filed on June 14, 2005. This provisional application is assigned to the assignee of the present Application, and is expressly incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, including all figures and tables.<br>
BACKGROUND Field<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates generally to telecommunications, and, more<br>
specifically, to methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture for broadcasting and multicasting from a cellular radio network.<br>
Background<br>
[0003]	A  modern  communication   system  is  expected  to  provide  reliable   data<br>
transmission for a variety of applications, including voice and data applications. In a point-to-multipoint communications context, known communication systems are based on frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), code division multiple access (CDMA), and perhaps other multiple access communication schemes.<br>
[0004]	A CDMA system may be designed to support one or more CDMA standards,<br>
such as (1) the "TIA/EIA-95 Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System" (this standard with its enhanced revisions A and B may be referred to as the "IS-95 standard"), (2) the "TIA/EIA-98-C Recommended Minimum Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular Mobile Station," also known as the "IS-98 standard," (3) the standard sponsored by a consortium named "3rd Generation Partnership Project" (3GPP) and embodied in a set of documents including documents known as 3G TS 25.211, 3G TS 25.212, 3G TS 25.213, and 3G TS 25.214 (the "W-CDMA standard"), (4) the standard sponsored by a consortium named "3rd Generation Partnership Project 2" (3GPP2) and<br><br>
WO 2006/138203	PCT/US2006/022725<br>
embodied in a set of documents including "C.S0002-A Physical Layer Standard for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems," the "C.S0005-A Upper Layer (Layer 3) Signaling Standard for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems," (the "cdma2000 standard" collectively), (5) the lxEV-DO standard "TIA/EIA/IS-856 cdma2000 High Rate Packet Data Air Interface Specification," and (6) certain other standards. The standards listed above are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, including annexes, appendices, and other attachments.<br>
[0005]	Manufacturers continue to add performance-enhancing features to wireless user<br>
equipment (UE) devices for use with cellular radio networks, such as cellular telephones. For example, many UEs include display screens with sufficient resolution to render video presentations.<br>
[0006]	With the enhanced capabilities of their UEs, users become more interested in<br>
being able to receive television broadcasts. Where there is demand, supply is likely to follow. Notably, cellular infrastructure for transmitting to UEs is already available. Operators of cellular networks thus would benefit from providing broadcast or multicast services to their subscribers. Live television, movies, sport clips, talk shows - all can be broadcast or multicast from a cellular radio network, in addition to more conventional services provided by such networks. This can be, in effect, similar to providing cable or satellite channels directly to the UEs.<br>
[0007]	Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) is a broadcasting service that<br>
can be offered via existing Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) cellular networks. MBMS and its enhanced version, E-MBMS, are being standardized in various groups of 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project).<br>
[0008]	Downlink (DL) capacity is an important performance characteristic of cellular<br>
systems. Increased downlink capacity can be used, for example, to make more broadcast/multicast channels available to the subscribers, and to improve the quality of the broadcast transmissions. For a fixed frequency range available for cellular system transmissions, capacity depends on spectral efficiency. Given limited availability of electromagnetic spectrum, it is therefore desirable to increase spectral efficiency of cellular systems, including spectral efficiency of broadcasts and multicasts. To avoid costs associated with infrastructure updating, it is desirable to increase spectral efficiency of existing infrastructure without or with limited changes.<br><br>
WO 2006/138203	PCT/US2006/022725<br>
 [0009]	Many base transceiver stations (BTSs) of existing cellular radio network sites<br>
(Nodes-B) have a single transmit antenna for single frequency network (SFN) operation. There is therefore a need in the art for methods and apparatus that increase SFN broadcast and multicast spectral efficiency of cellular networks without requiring installation of multiple antennae at existing cellular sites.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0010]	Embodiments disclosed herein address the above stated needs by providing a<br>
method for transmitting data from a plurality of sectors in a cellular communication system. The method includes assigning at least one transmit antenna from each sector of the plurality of sectors to a transmit antenna set of a plurality of L (L being an integer greater than 1) transmit antenna sets.

During at least one first period, each data stream is assigned to a different transmit antenna set of the L transmit antenna sets, resulting in a first distribution of data streams among transmit antenna sets. The method also includes, for each transmit antenna set of the plurality of L transmit antenna sets, modulating during the at least one first period a carrier of a first frequency with the data stream assigned to the transmit antenna set during the at least one first period.

controller and a plurality of sectors. Each sector has at least one transmit antenna and at least one base transceiver station. The radio network controller is configured to perform the following operations:<br>

The fourth signal component has a fourth base layer carrying the second data stream, and a fourth enhancement layer carrying the first data stream. The first, second, third, and fourth signal components are hierarchically modulated using the same carrier frequency. The processor is configured to estimate the first, second, third, and fourth physical channels to obtain channel estimates, and to separate the first and second signal components using the channel estimates. The processor is further configured to decode, after separating, the first data stream from the first base layer, and the second data stream from the first enhancement layer and/or the second base layer.<br>
[0067]	In an embodiment, a machine-readable medium stores instructions for a<br>
processor of a wireless user equipment device. When executed by the processor, the instructions cause the wireless user equipment device to receive at a first antenna a first<br><br>

signal, and receive at a second antenna a second signal. The first signal contains a first signal component transmitted through a first physical channel, and a second signal component transmitted through a second physical channel. The first signal component has a first base layer carrying a first data stream, and a first enhancement layer carrying a second data stream. The second signal component has a second base layer carrying the second data stream, and a second enhancement layer carrying the first data stream. The second signal contains a third signal component transmitted through a third physical channel, and a fourth signal component transmitted through a fourth physical channel. The third signal component has a third base layer carrying the first data stream, and a third enhancement layer carrying the second data stream. The fourth signal component has a fourth base layer carrying the second data stream, and a fourth enhancement layer carrying the first data stream. The first, second, third, and fourth signal components are hierarchically modulated using the same carrier frequency. The instructions further cause the wireless user equipment device to estimate the first, second, third, and fourth physical channels to obtain channel estimates, and to separate the first and second signal components using the channel estimates. After separating, the instructions cause the wireless user equipment device to decode the first data stream from the first base layer, and to decode the second data stream from the first enhancement layer and/or the second base layer.<br>
[0068]	In an embodiment, a method is provided for operating a cellular radio network<br>
with first and second spatially diverse transmit antennae in a first cell. (The antennae are spatially diverse to enable MIMO.) The method includes transmitting (e.g., broadcasting, multicasting) a first data stream on a first frequency through the first antenna to a plurality of user equipment devices in communication with the network. The method also includes transmitting a second data stream on the first frequency through the second antenna to the plurality of user equipment devices. At least some of the user equipment devices have multiple spatially diverse receive antennae. In this way, the use of multiple transmit and multiple receive antennae enables increased spectral efficiency of the transmissions.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0077]	In this document, the words "embodiment," "variant," and similar expressions<br>
are used to refer to particular apparatus, process, or article of manufacture, and not necessarily to the same apparatus, process, or article of manufacture. Thus, "one embodiment" (or a similar expression) used in one place or context can refer to a particular apparatus, process, or article of manufacture; the same or a similar expression in a different place can refer to a different apparatus, process, or article of manufacture. The expression "alternative embodiment" and similar phrases are used to indicate one of a number of different possible embodiments. The number of possible embodiments is not necessarily limited to two or any other quantity.<br>
[0078]	The word "exemplary" is used herein to mean "serving as an example, instance,<br>
or illustration." Any embodiment described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to<br><br>
WO 2006/138203	PCT/US2006/022725<br>
be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. All of the embodiments described in this description are exemplary embodiments provided to enable persons skilled in the art to make or use the invention, and not to limit the scope of legal protection afforded the invention, which is defined by the claims and their equivalents.<br>
[0079]	A "set" means one item or a plurality of items. Thus, a transmit antenna set may<br>
include one transmit antenna or a plurality of transmit antennae.<br>
[0080]	Base transceiver stations (BTSs) and base station controllers (BSCs) are parts of<br>
a network called "radio network," "RN," "access network," or "AN." A base station controller may also be referred to as a radio network controller or "RNC." A radio network may be a UTRAN or UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network. The radio network may transport data packets between multiple user equipment devices. The radio network may be further connected to additional networks outside the radio network, such as a corporate intranet, the Internet, or a conventional public switched telephone network ("PSTN"), and may transport data packets between each user equipment device and such outside networks.<br>
[0081]	"Single frequency network" or "SFN" is a radio network that operates several<br>
transmitters on the same frequency. To avoid or reduce interference, the several transmitters may be synchronized. Thus, the same signal is sent from the several transmitters. As will be described in more detail below, a single frequency network may also be configured to transmit multiple streams/flows of data on the same frequency, each data stream or flow being transmitted from a different set of transmitters of the network.<br>
[0082]	Given the same transmit power budget, multiple-input multiple-output (MEMO)<br>
technology enables increases in spectral efficiency of wireless communications. MIMO uses multiple spatially-diverse transmit antennae at a transmitting entity, and multiple spatially-diverse antennae at a receiver. Considering a basic example of two transmit antennae NT,I and NT,2 and two receive antennae NR,I and NR,2, four physical transmission channels are present: CH1,1 between NT,I and NR,1, CH1,2 between NT.I and NR,2, CH2,I between NT,2 and NR,I, and CH2,2 between NT,2 and NR,2. (The notation CHy corresponds to a channel between a transmit antenna NT,I and a receive antenna NR^.) Each of these channels is subjected to channel conditions, such as delay, interference, noise, multipath/fading, dispersion, and distortion.  Because of the spatial diversity of<br><br>
WO 2006/138203							PCT/US2006/022725<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
the receive and transmit antennae, the combined effects of these conditions are typically<br>
different for each of these channels.<br>
[0083]	In this document, a channel coefficient corresponding to a. channel CHjj is<br>
referred to as hi,j. A channel matrix H representing all the channels between NT transmit antennae and NR receive antennae can then be defined as follows:<br><br>
[0084]<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0085]	The channel coefficients hi j can be estimated, making an estimate of the channel<br>
matrix H available. Note that each coefficient hy need not be a simple multiplier coefficient, but encompasses all factors affecting the associated channel.<br>
[0086]	Consider the simple case of two transmit antennae and two receive antennae,<br>
(i.e., NT=2 and NR=2), with a first transmit stream TS] (on a given frequency F) being transmitted from NT,I and a second stream TS2 being transmitted from NT,2- On the receiver side, a first receive stream RSj is received at NR,I, and a second receive stream RS2 is received at NR,2. The two receive streams may be represented as follows:<br>
[0087]	RSi = TSi*hu + TS2*hi,i, and<br>
[0088]	RS2 = TSi*h,2 + TS2*h2,2.<br>
[0089]	Because estimates of the channel coefficients hi,2, hi,2, li2,i, and h2,2 are<br>
available, the two transmit streams TSj and TS2 can be separated at the receiver. Linear algebra techniques similarly provide a way for separating multiple streams for higher numbers of transmit antennae, receive antennae, and data streams. This is explained in more detail in literature, including, for example, commonly-assigned U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 11/009,200, Document No. 2005/0157805, entitled "Data Transmission With Spatial Spreading in a Mimo Communication System." See also commonly-assigned U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 11/008,865, Document No. 2005/0175115, entitled "Spatial Spreading in a Multi-Antenna Communication System"; and commonly-assigned U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 11/020,888, Document No. 2005/0195763, entitled "Pilot Transmission and Channel Estimation for MISO and MIMO Receivers in a Multi-Antenna System."<br><br>
WO 2006/138203	PCT/US2006/022725<br>
[0090]	In the above discussion it was assumed that each transmit stream is broadcast<br>
from a single antenna. It is also possible to broadcast one stream from multiple transmit antennae. In this latter case, we can treat each channel coefficient hij as a coefficient of the transmission channel from the ith set of antennae that transmit a stream TSi to a receive antenna (or a set of receive antennae) j. The analytical treatment of this latter case is similar to the analytical treatment of the case of one transmit stream per transmit antenna.<br>
[0091]	Open loop MIMO techniques can be used as an additional option for increasing<br>
spectral efficiency of cellular SFN broadcasting and multicasting. Because MEMO uses multiple transmit antennae, one way to employ MIMO is to transmit multiple streams from multiple antennae of the same site or sector ("cell").<br>
[0092]	In a SFN deployment for broadcasting, the receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at<br>
a UE can be very high; for the macro-cell link budget with 2800 meter inter-site distance, the SNR is typically higher than 14 dB for 95% of the users. Some system simulations show that, in a lxl deployment, for 95% coverage, the SFN spectral efficiency of E-MBMS is 1.2 bps/Hz. Given the presence of multiple transmit and receive antennae, such a high SNR makes it feasible to use open loop (without feedback) MIMO as an additional option for E-MBMS.<br>
[0093]	We will use this notation in the following discussion:<br>
[0094]	S = Number of transmit (Tx) streams;<br>
[0095]	N = Number of cells (sectors);<br>
[0096]	NT = Number of transmit antennae per cell; and<br>
[0097]	NR - Number of receive (Rx) antennae per cell.<br>
[0098]	Initially, let us assume that<br>
[0099]	S = min(NxNT,NR)&gt;l.<br>
[00100]	Figure 1 shows a cellular single frequency radio network 105 that includes a<br>
radio network controller 110, and cells 120 and 130. Each of these cells has a base transmitter station and two Tx antennae: the cell 120 has a BTS 121 and transmit antennae 122A and 122B, while the cell 130 has a BTS 131 and transmit antennae 132A and 132B. A UE 140 has two Rx antennae, 142A and 142B. Thus, S = min(N x NT,NR) = min(2x2,2) = 2 &gt; 1. A specific open loop MIMO variant of this embodiment uses a generic cyclic or pseudo random antenna permutation (PRAP) scheme,   wherein   5  streams   with   identical   Modulation   and  Code   Set   (MCS)<br><br>
WO 2006/138203	PCT/US2006/022725<br>
combinations are transmitted from each cell. Note that this makes the scheme similar to a variation of Horizontal Bell Labs Layered Space Time Code (H-BLAST). At a given time, the radio network 105 may transmit a first transmit stream 151 from the antennae 122A and 132A, and at the same time transmit a second transmit stream 152 from the antennae 122B and 132B.<br>
[00101]	Figure 2 illustrates selected components of an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
radio network controller 110. As shown in Figure 2, the radio network controller 110 includes a BTS interface 111 to enable the RNC 110 to communicate with the BTSs 120 and 130, a processor 112, and a memory device 113 storing computer code instructions. The processor 112 is coupled to the memory device 113 and to the BTS interface 111, so that the processor 112 reads and executes the code stored in the memory device 113, configuring the BTS interface 111 to cause the BTSs 120 and 130 to communicate with the UE 140 and other UEs using the processes described throughout this document.<br>
[00102]	The radio network may include additional controllers.<br>
[00103]	Figure 3 illustrates selected components of an exemplary embodiment of the UE<br>
140. As shown in Figure 3, the UE 140 includes receive antennae 142A and 142B, a radio network transceiver (receiver and transmitter) 143, an encoder/decoder block 144, a user input device (e.g., a keypad) 145, a display (e.g., an LCD screen) 146, a processor 147, and a memory device 148. The radio network transceiver 143, encoder and decoder block 144, user input device 145, and display 146 are configured by the processor 147 under control of the code stored in the memory device 148. The user equipment device 140 is configured to communicate with the radio network 105 over wireless communication links using a wireless cellular network transmission protocol, such as the cellular packet transmission protocols described above, and to execute processes described throughout this document.<br>
[00104]	Additional UEs may be in communication with the radio network 105.<br>
[00105]	The radio network may also include additional base transceiver stations.<br>
[00106]	The radio network 105 may transmit to the UE 140 using Orthogonal Frequency<br>
Division Multiplexing (OFDM). In each Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing symbol (sub-carrier), each stream may be transmitted from the radio network 105 to the UE 140 on a separate antenna; further, the mapping of stream ID to transmit antenna ID is permuted in time, so that the Rx SNR for each stream is approximately identical.<br><br>
WO 2006/138203								PCT/US2006/022725<br><br><br><br><br>
[00107]	Without any loss in generality, let us assume a relatively simple scenario for this<br>
case, wherein:<br>
[00108]	S = Nr.<br>
[00109]	To enable accurate channel estimation for each Tx-Rx antenna pair, the pilot<br>
sub-carriers are not re-used across Tx antennae. This is unlike data sub-carrier indices, which are re-used across all Tx antennae. Therefore, the following holds: <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[00115]	The composite SFN channel frequency response for each Tx antenna can be<br>
estimated using, for example, a Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) or low<br>
complexity zero-forced Robust MMSE solution.<br>
[00116]	After channel  estimation,  stream  separation  and inter-stream interference<br>
suppression may be achieved using a MMSE filter. This can be written by invoking the<br>
Orthogonal Projection Lemma, as follows:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
WO 2006/138203								PCT/US2006/022725<br>
 [00118]	After stream separation at the receiver, each stream may be independently<br>
decoded, and then successively canceled out from all other streams. Cancellation steps may be iterated until all streams are decoded. The complexity of successive interference cancellation (SIC) depends on the number of streams.<br>
[00119]	On the receiving side, the receiver (such as the UE 140) receives a first signal<br>
using a first receive antenna, and a second signal using a second receive antenna. The first signal includes a first data stream transmitted through a first physical channel from a first transmit antenna or a first set of transmitter antennae, and a second data stream transmitted through a second physical channel from a second transmit antenna or a second set of transmit antennae. Similarly, the second signal includes the first data stream transmitted through a third physical channel, and the second data stream transmitted through a fourth physical channel. The four channels are estimated, for example, using pilot channels at the receiver, or at the radio network with data provided by the receiver. The first and second data streams can then be separated by the receiver to obtain a first separated data stream and a second separated data stream. After separation, the receiver attempts to decode first data in the first data stream and second data in the second data stream. If the first attempt to decode the data is not successful, the receiver may attempt to decode again after cancelling the interference based on the partial decoding obtained during the first attempt.<br>
[00120]	The first and the second data streams may be multicast or broadcast on common<br>
channel(s).<br>
[00121]	Because open loop broadcast and multicast transmissions are generally targeted<br>
to the worst case receiver, successive interference cancellation may be omitted if not all targeted UEs implement this step.<br>
[00122]	The discussion so far described an embodiment of Figure 1 in which SFN<br>
spectral efficiency of an OFDM system is enhanced through MIMO technique, using multiple antennae at a cell, i.e., S - NT &gt; 2. The operation of the embodiment of Figure 1 is not necessarily limited to the use of OFDM, but may employ other methods using MIMO.<br>
[00123]	As noted in the BACKGROUND section of this document, many cells (sectors)<br>
have a single transmit antenna. Adding transmit antennae to sites involves additional costs that operators would rather avoid. Consequently, in other embodiments we do not assume transmit diversity from a single cell. Instead, we assume that:<br><br>
WO 2006/138203	PCT/US2006/022725<br>
Is*?<br>
[00124]	S = min (N * NT, NR) &gt; 1, and<br>
[00125]	NT = 1 (i.e., one transmit antenna per cell).<br>
[00126]	In other words, we assign transmit antennae into sets, and transmit different data<br>
streams from different sets, one stream per one set of transmit antennae.<br>
[00127]	Here, the SNR may be lower than in the strict SNF operation where all cells<br>
transmit the same stream, because each stream may be transmitted from a partial subset of the network's cells. Nevertheless, it is likely that the SNR is still high enough to exploit spatial multiplexing gains. This is particularly so if the number of such sets/streams is small and, consequently, the number of transmit antennae in each set is relatively large, providing good coverage throughout the geographic area of interest.<br>
[00128]	In such arrangement a problem arises for those UEs that are situated in the<br>
interior of one of the cells, because these UEs have a high carrier-to-interference (C/I) ratio based on a strong signal from one cell only. Such UEs do not benefit from spatial multiplexing, but can rely on other multiplexing techniques, e.g., temporal multiplexing (TDM) and frequency multiplexing.<br>
[00129]	Figure 4 illustrates a single frequency radio network 405 using TDM and MIMO<br>
to broadcast or multicast to UEs 440A and 440B. The radio network 405 includes a radio network controller 410 and cells/BTSs 420, 424, 428, and 432. (Each cell is conterminous with a BTS in this embodiment, but this need not always be the case.) The BTSs have respective transmit antennae 421, 425, 429, and 433. The structure of the radio network controller 410 may be similar or identical to the structure of the radio network controller 110. The structure of each of the UEs 440A/B may also be the same as or similar to the structure of the UE 140. Here, however, the radio network 405 and the UEs 440A/B are configured to communicate in accordance with the methods described below in relation to this embodiment.<br>
[00130]	In this embodiment, S = NR , a generic PRAP or Code Re-use BLAST (CR-<br><br>
            BLAST) scheme is used, and NR streams are transmitted from                cells at any given<br><br>
time.   Each of the NR streams thus corresponds to a set of transmit antennae in the<br>
associated set of cells. The mapping of streams to transmit antenna sets is permuted in<br>
time.<br>
[00131]	In this case, multiple streams are multiplexed in a time division multiplexed<br>
manner on a single transmit antenna per cell.  In a two stream scenario, for example,<br><br>
WO 2006/138203	PCT/US2006/022725<br><br>
half the symbols per slot may be dedicated to one stream, and the other half of the symbols are dedicated to the second stream. During a first period of time (Tl), for example, a first stream of symbols is transmitted from a first set of transmit antennae that includes the transmit antennae 425 and 433 of the BTSs 424 and 432, while a second stream of symbols is transmitted from a second set of transmit antennae that includes transmit antennae 421 and 429 of the BTSs 420 and 428. During the following time period (T2), the first stream is transmitted from the second transmit set, while the second stream is transmitted from the first transmit set. The cycle is then repeated with the stream-antenna set mapping being switched again and again. This is illustrated in Figure 5, which shows time periods Tl-1 through Tl-N during which the radio network transmits the first stream from the first set, and the second stream from the second set; similarly, the radio network transmits the first stream from the second set and the second stream from the first set during time periods T2-1 through T2-N.<br>
[00132]	Those UEs that are sufficiently far from each of the transmit antennae, such as<br>
the UE 440A, benefit from the spatial multiplexing gains resulting from the use of MTMO. In other words, the UE 440A receives both symbol streams. At the same time, the UEs in cell interiors, such as the UE 440B, benefit from temporal multiplexing and high C/I. In other words, the UE 440B may receive only one of the streams at a time, but with a relatively high C/I ratio and concomitantly high SNR, particularly in view of the proximity of the UE 440B to a transmit antenna.<br>
[00133]	After stream separation, each stream may be independently decoded, and then<br>
successively canceled out from all other streams. Cancellation steps may be iterated until all streams are decoded. The complexity of successive interference cancellation (SIC) depends on the number of streams.<br>
[00134]   The receiver of this embodiment may receive, during one or more first time periods, a first signal using a first receive antenna, and a second signal using a second receive antenna. The first signal includes (1) a first data stream transmitted through a first physical channel from a first transmit antenna or a first set of transmit antennae, and (2) a second data stream transmitted through a second physical channel from a second transmit antenna or a second set of transmit antennae. Similarly, the second signal includes the first data stream transmitted through a third physical channel, and the second data stream transmitted through a fourth physical channel. The first data stream<br><br>
WO 2006/138203	PCT/US2006/022725<br><br>
carries first data during the first time period(s), and the second data stream carries second data during the first time period(s).<br>
[00135]	The four channels are estimated, for example, using pilot channels at the<br>
receiver. The first and second data streams can then be separated by the receiver to obtain a first separated data stream and a second separated data stream. After separation, the receiver attempts to decode the first data in the first data stream and the second data in the second data stream.<br>
[00136]	If the first attempt to decode the data is not successful, the receiver may attempt<br>
to decode again after cancelling the interference based on the partial decoding obtained during the first attempt.<br>
[00137]	The receiver may also attempt to decode the data from the signals received<br>
during subsequent time period or periods. Thus, if the first attempt to decode is not successful, the receiver may receive at the first antenna the first signal during one or more second time periods, and receive at the second antenna the second signal during the one or more second time periods. The receiver may separate the first and second data streams from at least one of the first signal and the second signal using some or all of the channel estimates, to obtain first separated data stream and second separated data stream of the second time periods. After the streams are separated, the receiver may again attempt to decode the first and the second data from the first and second separated data streams of the first and second time periods.<br>
[00138]	Recall that, because of the use of TDM, the first signal during the second periods<br>
includes the second data stream transmitted through the first physical channel and the first data stream transmitted through the second physical channel, and the second signal includes the second data stream transmitted through the third physical channel and the first data stream transmitted through the fourth physical channel. Recall also that the first data stream carries the first data during the second time periods, and the second data stream carries the second data during the second time periods. Thus, the data may be transmitted redundantly during the first and second time period(s).<br>
[00139]	The first and the second data streams may be multicast or broadcast on common<br>
channel(s).<br>
[00140]	Figure 6 illustrates a single frequency radio network 605 using Hierarchical<br>
Modulation (HM) and MEMO to broadcast or multicast to UEs 640A and 640B. The radio network 605, which is similar to the network 405 of Figure 4, includes a radio<br><br>
WO 2006/138203	PCT/US2006/022725<br>
network controller 610 and cells/BTSs 620, 624, 628, and 632. The cells have respective transmit antennae 621, 625, 629, and 633. The structure of the radio network controller 610 may be similar or identical to the structure of the radio network controller 110, which is shown in Figure 2. The structure of each of the UEs 640A/B may also be the same as or similar to the structure of the UE 140, which is shown in Figure 3. The radio network and the UEs 640A/B are configured to communicate in accordance with the methods described below in relation to this embodiment.<br>
[00141]	Here, as in the network 405, S = NR, a generic PRAP or Code Re-use BLAST<br>
(CR-BLAST) scheme is used, and NR streams are transmitted from cells at any given time. The streams are carried by hierarchically modulated signals.<br>
[00142]	In  hierarchical  modulation,   a  carrier  is   encoded  with   two  data  flows.<br>
Considering 64-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation), data is mapped so that there is a QPSK flow contained in the 64-QAM. This results in two data flows: the QPSK data flow and a 16-QAM data flow. The combined data rate of the two data flows may be the same as the data rate of the corresponding 64-QAM data flow. For the QPSK data flow, symbols are encoded onto a carrier so that different sections in the complex signal plane of the modulation constellation (such as the Q-I plane) represent different positions of the symbol alphabet bits. For example, the left part of the Q-I plane may correspond to the "1" value of the most significant bit of a symbol, and the right half of the plane may correspond to the "0" value of this bit. Similarly, the lower half of the plane may correspond to the "1" value of the second most significant bit position, and the top half of the plane may correspond to the "0" value of this bit. Thus, a symbol falling in the top left quadrant would represent "10" in the two most significant bit positions, a symbol in the top right quadrant would represent "00" in these positions, and symbols in the bottom left and bottom right quadrants would represent "11" and "01" values, respectively. Additional bits of the symbol corresponding to the 16-QAM data flow are determined by the symbol's position within the particular quadrant determined by the first two bits.<br>
[00143]	Note that the QPSK data flow is more robust than the 16-QAM data flow,<br>
meaning that the QPSK data flow may be decoded at lower SNR and lower C/I ratios of the signal. Spacing within the constellation may be varied to provide additional robustness to the QPSK data flow at the cost of the 16-QAM data flow. Thus, the more-robust BPSK data flow has a greater coverage than the less-robust 16-QAM data flow.<br><br>
WO 2006/138203	PCT/US2006/022725<br><br>
[00144]	In this document, the more robust layer of a hierarchically modulated signal<br>
(such as the BPSK stream in the 64-QAM example above) will be referred to as the base layer; the less robust layer of the hierarchically modulated signal (such as the 16-QAM stream of the 64-QAM example) will be referred to as the enhancement layer.<br>
[00145]	Hierarchical modulation provides a mechanism for increasing transmission<br>
capacity. The capacity increase comes at the expense of reduced coverage for enhancement layer, while the base layer performance is improved.<br>
[00146]	In the SNF 605, the stream mapping may be permuted in time from base to<br>
enhancement layers. During the first time periods Tl of Figure 7, for example, a first data stream S1 may be transmitted from the first set of antennae on the base layer of a first hierarchically modulated signal and, concurrently, from the second set of antennae on the enhancement layer of a second hierarchically modulated signal. During the second time periods T2 of Figure 5, the first data stream may be transmitted from the first set of antennae on the enhancement layer of the first hierarchically modulated signal and, concurrently, from the second set of antennae on the base layer of the second hierarchically modulated signal. Thus, when the first stream is transmitted on the base layer of a set of antennae, the second layer is transmitted on the enhancement layer of the same set, and vice versa. In other words:<br><br><br><br><br>
[00148]	As in the TDM embodiment of Figure 4, data in each stream may be redundantly<br>
transmitted during successive time periods.<br>
[00149]	A receiver (one of the UEs 640, for example) may be configured to receive at a<br>
first receive antenna a first receive signal that includes (1) the first signal component transmitted from a first transmit antenna (or a first set of transmit antennae) through a first physical channel, and (2) a second signal component transmitted from a second transmit antenna (or a second set of transmit antennae) through a second physical channel. The first signal component may include (1) a first base layer carrying a first data stream, and (2) a first enhancement layer carrying a second data stream; the second signal component may include (1) a second base layer carrying the second data stream, and (2) a second enhancement layer carrying the first data stream. The receiver may be<br><br>
WO 2006/138203	PCT/US2006/022725<br><br>
further configured to receive at a second antenna a second signal that includes (1) a third signal component transmitted through a third physical channel, and (2) a fourth signal component transmitted through a fourth physical channel. The third signal component may include (1) a third base layer carrying the first data stream, and (2) a third enhancement layer carrying the second data stream; the fourth signal component may include (1) a fourth base layer carrying the second data stream, and (2) a fourth enhancement layer carrying the first data stream.<br>
[00150]	The first, second, third, and fourth physical channels may be estimated to<br>
obtain channel estimates for the channels. Channel estimation may be performed by the receiver and be based on pilot channels. After some or all the channel estimates become available, the receiver may separate the first and second signal components. After the signal separation, the receiver may attempt to decode the first data stream from the first base layer and the second data stream from the first enhancement layer.<br>
[00151]	The receiver may attempt to decode the second data stream from both the first<br>
enhancement layer and the second base layer. Alternatively, the receiver may estimate the quality of the first signal and, if the quality of the first signal (e.g., SNR) is higher than a predetermined measure, decode the second data stream from the first enhancement layer; if the quality of the first signal does not exceed the measure, the receiver may separate the third and fourth signal components using the channel estimates, and attempt decode the second data stream from the second base layer. The receiver may also estimate the quality of the second signal and, if the quality of the second signal is below a predetermined threshold, attempt to decode the second data stream from the first enhancement layer; if the quality of the second signal is not below the threshold, the receiver may separate the third and fourth signal components and attempt to decode the second data stream from the second base layer.<br>
[00152]	Interference Cancellation (IC) techniques may be used to cancel the interference<br>
from base layer to enhancement layer of the same signal.<br>
[00153]	In case multiple transmit antennae are present at the Node-B and cell-specific<br>
content needs to be transmitted, the system can switch to Space Time Transmit Diversity (STTD), or turn off the transmit diversity antennae. The first of these options may be simpler with no RF implications of dynamic switching on/off the transmit diversity antennae.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br>
"TRANSMIT SPATIAL DIVERSITY FOR CELLULAR SINGLE FREQUENCY NETWORKS"<br>
Multiple-In Multiple-Out (MIMO) techniques are used to increase spectral efficiency of a cellular single frequency network. In some embodiments with single transmit antenna per cell, multiple data streams are transmitted from multiple cells, one data stream per set of transmit antennae. The mapping of streams to antenna sets is permuted in time. In this way, user equipment devices (UEs) at cell edges benefit from MIMO, and UEs near cell centers benefit from high carrier-to-interference (C/l) ratio of the signal. In some embodiments, each stream is concurrently transmitted on base layer of a hierarchically modulated signal from one set, and on enhancement layer of a hierarchically modulated signal from another set. The mapping of sets to streams is permuted in time. The UEs at cell edges benefit from MIMO, and the UEs near cell centers benefit from the high C/I to decode both streams from the base and enhancement layers.<br></td>
