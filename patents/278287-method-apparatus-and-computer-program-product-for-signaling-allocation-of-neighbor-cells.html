				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to the field of wireless telecommunications. More particularly, the present invention pertains to-cell allocation.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The telecommunications industry is in the process of developing a new generation of flexible and affordable communications that includes high-speed access while also supporting broadband services. Many features of the third generation (3G) mobile telecommunications system have already been established, but many other features have yet to be perfected.<br>
One of the systems within the third generation of mobile communications is the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) which delivers voice, data, multimedia, and wideband information to stationary as well as mobile customers. As can be seen in FIG. 1, the UMTS architecture consists of user equipment 102 (UE), the UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network 104 (UTRAN), and the Core Network 126 (CN). The air interface between the UTRAN and the UE is called Uu, and the interface between the UTRAN and the Core Network is called Iu.<br>
Evolved UTRAN (EUTRAN) is meant to take 3G even farther into the future. EUTRAN is designed to improve the UMTS mobile phone standard in order to cope with various anticipated requirements.   EUTRAN is frequently indicated by the term Long Term Evolution (LTE), and is also associated with terms like System Architecture Evolution (SAE).<br>
 <br>
Information about LTE can be found in 3GPP TR 25.913 (V7.2.0, December, 2005), Requirements for Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA) and Evolved UTRAN and also in 3GPP TR 25.813 (V0.1.0, November 2005), Evolved UTRA and UTRAN-Radio interface protocol aspects, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. UTRAN and EUTRAN will now be described in some further detail.<br>
The UTRAN consists of a set of Radio Network Subsystems 128 (RNS), each of which has geographic coverage of a number of cells 110 (C), as can be seen in FIG. 1. The interface between the subsystems is called lur. Each Radio Network Subsystem 128 (RNS) includes a Radio Network Controller 112 (RNC) and at least one Node B 114, each Node B having geographic coverage of at least one cell 110. As can be seen from FIG. 1, the interface between an RNC 112 and a Node B 114 is called Iub, and the Iub is hard-wired . rather than being an air interface. For any Node B 114 there is only one RNC 112. A Node B 114 is responsible for radio transmission and reception to and from the UE 102 (Node B antennas can typically be seen atop towers or preferably at less visible locations). The RNC 112 has overall control of the logical resources of each Node B 114 within the RNS 128, and the RNC 112 is also responsible for handover decisions which entail switching a call from one ceil to another or between radio channels in the same cell.<br>
In UMTS radio networks, a UE can support multiple applications of different qualities of service running simultaneously. In the MAC layer, multiple logical channels can be multiplexed to a single transport channel. The transport channel can define how traffic from logical channels is processed and sent to the physical layer. The basic data unit exchanged between MAC and physical layer is called the Transport Block (TB). It is composed of an RLC PDU and a MAC header. During a period of time called the transmission time interval (TTI), several transport blocks and some other parameters are delivered to the physical layer.<br>
Generally speaking, a prefix of the letter "E" in upper or lower case signifies the Long Term Evolution (LTE). The E-UTRAN consists of eNBs (E-UTRAN Node B), providing the E-UTRA user plane (RLC/MAC/PHY) and control plane (RRC) protocol terminations towards the UE. The eNBs interface to the access gateway (aGW) via the SI, and are inter-<br>
 <br>
connected via the X2.<br>
An example of the E-UTRAN architecture is illustrated in FIG. 2. This example of E-UTRAN consists of eNBs, providing the E-UTRA user plane (RLC/MAC/PHY) and control plane (RRC) protocol terminations towards the UE. The eNBs are connected by i     means of the SI interface to the EPC (evolved packet core), more specifically to the Mobility Management Entity (MME). The SI interface supports a many-to-many relation between MMEs and eNBs. The MME in the example of FIG. 2 is one option for the access gateway (aGW).<br>
In this example of E-UTRAN, there exists an X2 interface between the eNBs that need to communicate with each other. The eNB may host functions such as radio resource management (radio bearer control, radio admission control, connection mobility control, dynamic allocation of resources to UEs in both uplink and downlink), selection of a mobility management entity (MME) at UE attachment, scheduling and transmission of paging messages (originated from the MME), scheduling and transmission of broadcast information (originated from the MME or O&amp;M), and measurement and measurement reporting configuration for mobility and scheduling. The MME may host functions such as the following: distribution of paging messages to the eNBs, security control, IP header compression and encryption of user data streams; termination of U-plane packets for paging reasons; switching of U-plane for support of UE mobility, idle state mobility control, System Architecture Evolution (SAE) bearer control, and ciphering and integrity protection of NAS signaling.<br>
According to recent developments in this field, the user equipment (UE) can measure any reference signal (RS) from a first antenna (#1) and a second antenna (#2), with the exact pilot/frame structure given in 3GPP TS 36.211 V. 1.0.0 (2007-03) Physical Channels and Modulation (Release 8) which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols bearing this reference signal (RS) occur 4 times per unicast sub-frame and only once in Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) sub-frames. The accuracy and reliability of mobility measurements depends on the<br>
 <br>
number of RS resource elements eligible for measurements, and on the UE awareness of presence or absence of some RS resource elements (e.g. in MBSFN sub-frames). These mobility measurements have to be carried out on RS resource elements of the cell on which the UE is camping on, as well as on corresponding neighbor cells.<br>
Various solutions to this problem have been attempted. For example, one technique is to signal foil MBSFN sub-frame allocation of a cell on this cell's primary Broadcast Channel (P-BCH). However, that technique is very costly from the overhead point of view, because the P-BCH is a very robust channel and each P-BCH bit consumes a non-negligible part of a cell's capacity. Furthermore, for measuring RS from neighbor cells, this requires that the P-BCH from neighbor cells be received before and during measurements which might be unreliable and adds extra complexity.<br>
A second technique is to measure the RS only in the first OFDM symbol of each sub-frame. However, according to that technique, the number of RS elements eligible for measurements is always reduced by a factor of 4, which will incur measurement inaccuracy.<br>
A third technique is to signal a per carrier MBSFN/non-MBSFN indication. Therefore, in the MBSFN case, only the first RS OFDM symbol of each sub-frame would be used (see second technique described above), and in the non-MBSFN case up to 4 RS OFDM symbols could be used. This means that in the latter case all available and eligible RS elements can be measured in unicast carriers. However, according to this third technique, the number of RS elements eligible for measurements is reduced by a factor of 4 in any mixed MBSFN/unicast carrier (including carriers where the MBSFN area includes only a couple of cells or including carrier-wide MBSFN area(s)).<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Although the present invention is applicable in the context of the LTE, its principles are not limited to LTE, and instead may also be applicable to various other current and future wireless telecommunications systems. Throughout this application, the general term "base<br>
 <br>
station" will be understood to include an eNB, a Node B, or any other network element that serves a purpose analogous to a base station of the UTRAN.<br>
This invention is related to the standardized Long Term Evolution of 3GPP. More specifically it considers mobility measurements taking into account the possibility to multiplex unicast and multicast/broadcast traffic within one frequency carrier.<br>
According to recent developments in this field, time division multiplexing (TDM) of Multimedia Broadcast Multimedia Services (MBMS) and unicasting of data channel (Physical Downlink Shared Channel PDSCH) are done on a sub-frame basis. The unicast control channel (Physical Downlink Control Channel or PDCCH) together with downlink unicast pilot (cell specific RS) can be TDM multiplexed with MBSFN in the same sub-frame (so-called MBSFN sub-frame) in case of a mixed MBSFN or unicast carrier. In such MBSFN sub-frames, the PDCCH (with ceU-specific pilot) is transmitted in the first, or in the first two, OFDM symbols and MBSFN (multi-cell traffic and pilot) is transmitted in the rest of the sub-frame's OFDM symbols. Furthermore, according to recent developments, MBSFN should not be transmitted in sub-frame #0 and #5 (i.e. Synchronization Channel or SCH sub-frames), so that UE can confidently use cell-specific RS at least in these sub-frames for measurements.<br>
MBSFN symbols in MBSFN sub-frames can also contain cell common pilots but they cannot be used for unicast handover measurements.<br>
Providing full information regarding MBSFN or unicast sub-frame allocation in neighbor cells via own cell would be costly from the overhead or signaling point of view. The present invention therefore includes an efficient method to provide information about MBSFN or unicast allocation in neighbor cells, and to maximize the accuracy of mobility-related neighbor cell measurements by maximizing the number of RS resource elements eligible for UE mobility measurements of neighbor cells.<br>
According to the present invention, each cell transmits an indicator (preferably only one bit) of the difference in unicast or MBSFN sub-frame allocation between the own cell and neighbor cells. The indicator is broadcast on a common channel preferably a broadcast<br>
 <br>
control channel. The indicator is set and signals whether unicast or MBSFN allocation in neighbor cells is the same or not compared to the own cell.<br>
It should be noted that unicast or MBSFN allocation in many scenarios will be the same in the own cell and in neighbor cells. These scenarios include: Unicast carriers (and MBSFN dedicated carriers), Unicast/MBSFN carriers with PLMN-wide MBSFN area(s), non-PLMN-wide MBSFN area(s) deployed over large geographical regions in unicast/MBSFN carriers, and Unicast areas in unicast/MBSFN carriers with non-PLMN-wide MBSFN deployments (PLMN stands for Public Land Mobile Network). In addition, inter-node signaling can be used to automate setting of the indicator.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described. This is merely to illustrate one way of implementing the invention, without limiting the scope or coverage of what is described elsewhere in this application.<br>
 <br>
As mentioned, each cell transmits an indicator (preferably only one bit) of the difference in unicast or MBSFN sub-frame allocation between the own cell and neighbor cells. The indicator is broadcast on a common channel, preferably a dynamic broadcast channel. The indicator is set and signals whether umcast or MBSFN allocation in neighbor cells is the same or not compared to the own cell<br>
An example of the present invention is shown in FIG. 3, where the indicator would be the same for all cells of a Node B; neighbor cells of Node B 1 have different unicast or MBSFN allocations. In consequence, the indicator broadcasted in the cells of Node B I is on. Node B 1 is aware of MBSFN or unicast allocation in cells of the group of (6) surrounding Node Bs (marked by bold line). Neighbor cells of Node B 2 have the same MBSFN or unicast allocations, and therefore the indicator in the cells of Node B 2 is off (same for Node B 3). The criss-cross pattern in FIG. 3 indicates an MBSFN area. Observe that the indicator in eNode B 4 can also be set off, in case the MBSFN sub-frames location in neighbor cells of this Node B is a sub-set of the MBSFN sub-frames in eNode B 4 i.e. the UEs in cells of Node 4 know that surrounding cells transmit the same or more unicast sub-frames<br>
If the indicator is set to a first value, e.g. "0" (e.g. unicast carrier c.f. FIG. 4, interior of MBSFN area(s) c.f. FIG. 5), this means that unicast or MBSFN allocation (i.e. the location of MBSFN and/or unicast sub-frames) in neighbor cells is the same as in the own cell. The UE action will be such that the UE can use the RS resource elements eligible for the Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) measurements of neighbor cells corresponding to the ones used for measurements in the own cell. The eligible RS resource elements in neighbor cells are derived on the basis of the unicast/MBSFN allocation of the own cell<br>
However, if the indicator is set to a second value e.g. "1" (e.g. border of MBSFN area(s) c.f. FIG. 3), this means that a umcast or MBSFN allocation in neighbor cells is different comparing to the own cell. The UE action will be such that the UE falls back to measure neighbor cells using only the RS resource elements in the first OFDM symbol in each sub-frame together with all RS resource elements in SCH-sub-frames (regardless of the fact if the UE is aware of the cyclic prefix length in these first OFDM symbols)<br>
 <br>
Furthermore, there may be inter-node signaling so that each cell/eNode B can determine if MBSFN/unicast allocation in its neighbor cells/Node Bs is the same or not and set the indicator value automatically. This signaling can be between neighbor eNode Bs (the X2 interface) and would exchange the information regarding each others MBSFN/unicast allocations. Also, this signaling can be between a master node (e.g. Multi-cell Coordination Entity) and groups of neighbor eNode Bs to inform Node Bs/cells if the MBSFN/unicast allocation in neighbor cells is the same or not (alternatively informing about the exact MBSFN/unicast allocation of neighbor cells/eNode Bs).<br>
From the inter-cell power control point of view, there must be a notion of neighbor cells (detectable and measured by serving UEs) exchanging overload indicators over the X2 interface. Therefore, it may be beneficial and simple if the same group can be used to define neighbor cells being aware of each other MBSFN/unicast allocation.<br>
Prior to Dynamic Broadcast Channel (D-BCH) or MBMS Control Channel (MCCH) reception, the UE might be not aware of the MBSFN/unicast allocation in the own cell e.g. during initial cell search. In consequence inter-sub-frame channel estimation for D-BCH demodulation might be constrained. Therefore, it might be beneficial not to constrain inter-sub-frame channel estimation by placing the D-BCH adjacently to unicast sub-frames (e.g. SCH sub-frames).<br>
Advantages of the above preferred embodiment include low overhead, and no need to constantly read the Broadcast Channel of neighbor cells during measurements. Furthermore, the number of RS resource elements eligible for mobility measurements of neighbor cells is increased in typical deployment scenarios (this increases the measurement accuracy and decrease the number of erroneous handovers and cell reselections). Also, the indicators in each cell can be set automatically if inter-node signaling of MBSFN/unicast allocation is specified (alternatively setting of the indicators can be operator or implementation-specific). Additionally, there is no need to additionally define groups of neighbor cells or Node Bs if the groups of Node Bs or cells exchanging overload indicators over the X2 interface for inter-cell<br>
 <br>
power control are reused (alternatively the definition of groups can be operator/implementation-specific).<br>
Alternatively, if some UEs are not aware of MBSFN or unicast allocation in the own ceil the following solution can be adopted: the indicator can take more than two values/states (e.g. 2 bits). Two values are used by the UEs being aware of MBSFN or unicast allocation as described in the preferred implementation, the remaining two values are used to signal to the UEs being not aware of MBSFN or unicast allocation in the own cell whether neighbor cells are unicast or mixed MBSFN or unicast cells.<br>
The signaling between the eNode B and the UE will have to be specified and implemented in the eNode B and in the UE. Furthermore, the interpretation of the signaling and relevant behaviour will be implemented in the UE. Finally, also corresponding eNode B to eNode B signaling or an information exchangeanvolving a central node will be needed.<br>
The present invention includes a cellular mobile communication system (e.g. LTE) in which base stations (e.g. eNode Bs) provide a beacon signal (e.g. reference signal) for mobile stations (e.g. UEs) in their cells and in which this beacon signal is provided in specific time periods (e.g. reference signal symbols), i.e. not continuously and there are at least 2 phases: phase A (e.g. a unicast sub-frame) in which beacon signals are provided N times (e.g. N==4) over time interval A at fixed locations; and phase B (e.g. MBMS sub-frame) in which beacon signals are provided M times (e.g. M=l) over time interval B at fixed locations.<br>
Each cell can either operate in phase A only, in phase B only, or in a combination of phases A and B for which it is cell-specific how many phases A and how many phases B follow each other. The present invention considers.such a system and provides a means for mobile stations to carry out measurements 6? these beacons in the serving (own) and the neighbor cells by: exchange of cell specific lists of the sequences of phases A and B used for a determined time period; exchange of these lists between neighbor cells/base stations via network interfaces; providing of corresponding information to the UEs by its serving cell so that these UEs know when to measure which beacon signal of own and neighbor cells.<br>
The present invention also includes modifications of the system just described.<br>
 <br>
The system may be such that the M time positions form a subset of the N time positions. Also, the system nay be such that cells are synchronized or the UE knows the cell timing (e.g. via reading the synchronization channel).<br>
The present invention also includes either of the systems just described, for which the "corresponding information" is provided in a form of a complete or reduced list for serving and neighbor cells (e.g. cell 1: x times phase A, y times phase B; cell 2: q times phase A, r times phase B; cell 3: u times phase B, v times cell A, w times phase B; or e.g. reduced: xA, yB/qA, rB/uB, vA, WB), or as a list only from the serving cell either in a broadcast manner (e.g on BCH) or in mobile station specific way.<br>
The present invention also includes the systems just described, for which the "corresponding information" is provided for the serving cell in the form of a list from the serving cell either in a broadcast manner (e.g on BCH) or in mobile station specific way, or is provided for all predefined neighbor cells in a form of an indicator sent from the serving cell which indicates whether the serving cell is using the same phase A/phase B setting as a predefined set of neighbor cells or not. This indicator could be one indicator per neighbor cell or one indicator for all cells.<br>
The present invention also includes the systems just described, for which the M time positions form a subset of the N time positions, so that if the indicator indicates that the setting of a neighbor cell is different from the serving cell the UE could measure at least on the subset of beacon signals.<br>
If a base station is controlling all its cells in the same way with respect to the sequence of phases A and B, then the considerations related to the various systems just described could also be implemented per serving and neighbor base station instead of per serving cell and neighbor cell.<br>
As seen in FIG, 6, one method 1600 of the present invention begins by receiving 605 a discontinuous beacon signal from a base station, the beacon signal having two possible phases. This occurs at a plurality of base stations. Then an indicator is received 610 from the base station, indicating the difference at the bases station's cell, as compared to<br>
 <br>
neighboring cells, regarding each cell's use of the two possible phases. Subsequently, mobility-related neighbor cell measurement is performed 620 using the indicator, and also using cell configuration information.<br>
An embodiment for performing part of this method is shown in FIG. 7. The system 700 includes a mobile communication device 710 and a base station 720. A processor 735 in the base station calculates an indicator indicative of differing allocation in different cells, and provides the indicator to a transceiver 740 which transmits the indicator to the mobile device 710. The mobile device includes a transceiver 725 for receiving the indicator, and a measurement module 730 for performing mobility-related measurements using the indicator.<br>
