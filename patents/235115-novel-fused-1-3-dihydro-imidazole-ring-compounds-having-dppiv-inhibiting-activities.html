DESCRIPTION<br>
FUSED 1,3-DIHYDRO-IMIDAZOLE RING COMPOUNDS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds having DPPIV-inhibiting activities, and particularly relates to fused 1,3-dihydro-imidazole ring compounds that are useful as DPPIV inhibitors.<br>
Background Art<br>
Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPPIV) is a kind of serine protease that specifically hydrolyzes the dipeptide-X-Pro (X may be any amino acid) from the free N terminus of a polypeptide chain.<br>
Glucose-dependent insulinotropic hormone (incretin; GLP-1, Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 and GIP; Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide), which is secreted postprandially from the intestinal tract, is quickly degraded and inactivated by this DPPIV.    Suppressing this degradation of GLP-1 by DPPIV enhances the action of incretin (GLP-1 and GIP), and facilitates insulin secretion from pancreatic p-cells due to glucose stimulus.    It has been shown that, as a result, postchallenge hyperglycemia is improved in oral glucose tolerance tests (see Non-patent document 1).   Furthermore, it has also been shown that GLP-1 is involved in suppressive effects on appetite and food intake, and also in p cell protection based on its promotional effect on pancreatic p cell differentiation and growth.<br>
Therefore, DPPIV inhibitors can be expected to serve as useful therapeutic and preventive agents against diseases involving GLP-1 and GIP, such as obesity and diabetes.<br>
As shown below, a relationship has been reported between various diseases, including diabetes, and DPPIV.    DPPIV inhibitors can therefore be expected to become therapeutic agents for such diseases.<br>
(1)	Preventive and therapeutic agents for AIDS (see Non-patent document 2),<br>
(2)	preventive and therapeutic agents for osteoporosis (see Non-patent document 3),<br>
(3)	preventive and therapeutic agents for intestinal disorders (see Non-patent document<br>
4),<br>
(4)	preventive and therapeutic agents for hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and obesity, (see<br>
Non-patent documents 5 and 6),<br>
(5)	preventive and therapeutic agents for angiogenesis (see Non-patent document 7),<br>
(6)	preventive and therapeutic agents for infertility (see Patent document 1),<br>
(7)	preventive and therapeutic agents for inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases,<br><br>
and chronic rheumatoid arthritis (see Non-patent document 8), and<br>
(8)	preventive and therapeutic agents for cancer (see Non-patent documents 9 and 10),<br>
(9)	preventive and therapeutic agents for multiple sclerosis (see Non-patent document 11) Although a number of DPPIV inhibitors are known (see Patent documents 2-11), DPPIV<br>
inhibitors comprising a fused 1,3-dihydroimidazole ring are not known.

Methods:<br>
[Preparation and administration of test compounds]<br>
The test compounds were suspended in a 0.5% methylcellulose (MC) solution at the doses indicated below in Table 2.    These test compounds and the NVP DPP728 (U.S. Patent No. 6011155) suspension, or the 0.5% MC solution (the solvent control group), were administered orally at a dose of 10 mL/kg.    30 minutes later, a glucose solution was orally administered at a dose of 10 mL/kg.    Glucose was orally administered at a dose of 2 g/kg. [Blood collection and measurement of blood glucose level]<br>
The tail vain of unanesthetized mice was cut with a razor blade to cause a small amount of bleeding immediately before administering the test substances or NVP DPP728, and immediately before, as well as 30, 60, and 120 minutes after, administration of the glucose solution.    10 jaL of blood was collected, and this was mixed immediately with 0.6 M perchloric acid (140 \xL).    Glucose present in the supernatant obtained by centrifugation (1500 g, 10 minutes, 4°C, refrigerated centrifuge GS-6KR, Beckman) was measured using Glucose CII Test Wako (Wako Pure Chemicals).<br>
Results:    In each of the groups to which 0.5% MC solution, NVP DPP728, and the test compounds were administered, the area under the curve of blood glucose vs. time was calculated over 0 to 120 minutes from the time of glucose administration (AUCo-120).    Defining the AUCo-120 for the 0.5% MC solution-administered group as 100%, and the AUCo-i2o for the NVP DPP728 (10 mg/kg)-administered group as 0%, the degree of improvement in glucose tolerance due to the test compound was calculated by the following equation:<br>
Degree of improvement in glucose tolerance (%) = (AUCo-120 of the test compound -AUCo-120 of the NVP DPP728 (10 mg/kg)-administered group)/( AUCo-120 of the 0.5% MC solution-administered group - AUCo-120 of the NVP DPP728 (10 mg/kg)-administered group) x 100<br>
The lower the % value, the better the degree of improvement in glucose tolerance.<br>
Table 2 shows the results (effects on glucose tolerance in normal mice).<br>
[Table 2]<br><br><br>
Compounds with clear effects on glucose tolerance in normal mice were discovered among the novel fused 1,3-dihydro-imidazole ring compounds of this invention, at orally administered doses of 1 to 10 (mg/kg) using the above-mentioned in vivo experiment.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
This invention was able to provide fused 1,3-dihydro-imidazole ring compounds that show DPPIV-inhibiting activity.<br>
Therefore, the fused 1,3-dihydroimidazole ring compounds of this invention are useful as therapeutic and preventive agents, such as therapeutic agents for diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, AIDS, osteoporosis, gastrointestinal disorder, angiogenesis, and infertility, and as anti-inflammatory agents, anti-allergic agents, immunoregulatory agents, hormone regulatory agents, anti-rheumatic agents, and therapeutic agents for cancer.<br>
To confirm their drug efficacy when orally administered, examinations were carried out using improvement in glucose tolerance as the indicator.    Their oral effectiveness was confirmed, and their usefulness as drugs was discovered.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
