TITLE:	PROCESS FOR THE FERMENTATION OF PI YTOSTEROLS TO<br>
ANDROSTADIENEDIONE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates in general to fermentation processes, and ir particular to tlie bio-conversion of phytosterol compositions to androstenedione and/or androstadienedione.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
At present there are two main routes for the Industrial production &gt;f sterokj drugs. One is the diosgenin route and the other is the microbiologicaf transfc innation route. Diosgenln Is a spirok^ai type steroidal a giycone isolated from a Composite plant {DIoscorea sp.). In the late 1940's and early 1950's the route ^/as developed using mainiy chemical reactions:<br><br><br>
Afttioughthis route remained importantfor the commercial proiuctior&gt; of steroids, alternative methods came under consideration in the 1970's. Th a price of diosgenin was significantly increased particutarty by the Mexican govemmen t and due, in part, to decreased content of diosgenin in the dry plant mass, and incref sed labor cost, etc. Therefore, an alternative methodology was required for future AC production.<br>
It Is well known from extensh/e research in the pharmaceutical Industry in the ig60's and 70'9 that numerous mictoarganlams (e.g., those of the g anera Arthrobacter. Brevfbacterfum, Aiffcrobacferlum, Profam/nobscfBr, Sacfffus, Noardia, Streptomyces and, In partioilar, Mycobacterium) possess the natural ability of degrading naturally occurring Sp-hydroxy^A^-sterols (such as cholesterol, |3 sitosterol or a-sitostensl) or a mixture of sterols (as shown below) to cadson dioxide and water, ar d that 4-andrcÂ»tene-3,17-dione (androstenedlone) and 1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dIone (indrostadienedione) are tbrmad as intermediates during the degradation.<br>
Phytosterol Compounds Used as Substrates lor Microbial E liotransfomnation.<br><br><br>
One of the present commercial sources of phytasterols are vegetable-derived oils. The microbial conversion of these available sterols to AD and ADD provides a highly important route to the steroid drug industry.<br>
ADD isanessential rawmateiial In the manufacture of various synthetic steroids induding anti-Inflammatory agents, oral contraceptives, synthetic adrenal steroids, anabolic agents (growth stimulating), and other synthetic steroids.<br>
In general, the known fermentation process involves the propagation of a mutant of Mycobact&amp;Hum in an appropriate nutrient medium, transfer of the culture to a bioreactor containing the phytasterols, and then allowing the biotranfonnation to AD and/or ADD over a period of approximately 120 hours. Harvesting of the fermentafion bre&gt;th, extraction of the latter vinth an organic solvent, and subsequent crystallization in an organic solvent, generally provides the products AD and/or ADD as wtiite ciystalline<br><br>
powders.  Pertinent references that discuss ttie knovm process and summarize the earlier studies are as follows:<br>
S. Kraychy, and R.D. Mulr, U.S. Patent No. 3,684,657 (1972).<br>
W.J. Marsheck. S. Kraychy and R.D. Mulr, Appl. Microbfol., 2^, 72 (1072).<br>
A.H. Conner, M. Nagaol<a j.w. rowe and d. perlman appl. environ. microbiol.></a>
32,310(1976).<br>
K. Kiesllch, J. Basic Microbiol., aS. 461 (1986).<br>
One of the problems associated with the known phytosterol blo-converslon process (whk:h problem plagues the entire sterokl Industry) Involves the poor solubility of the substrate, in this case a phytosterol composltton, In ttie aqueous nutrient medium. Inadequate solubility dictates the presence of only relatively low concentrations of substrate in the nutrient medium, resulting in poor contact witfi the micro-organism and generally leading to low yields of end products. Long femnentation times are also typically needed to achieve any satisfactory degree of blo-conversbn. To afford an alternative route to AD and ADD in which the Issue of substrate solubility was addressed, the present applicants demonstrated that the phytosterols (0-sitosterol, campesteroi and stigmastanol) obtained from 'soap", available In multi-tonne quantities from the forest Industry, could be solubillzed and biotransformed quantitatively by Mycobacterium mutants to ADD (PCT/CAgo/00267).<br>
Another problem associated with the known phytosterol bk&gt;-oonverslon process is thatthe end-product of the bk)-conversion from phytosterols (or compositions of phytosterols) typically contains significant amounts of both AD and ADD. Given the similar chemical stoictiJFe of AD and ADD, it is difficult and expensive to subsequently separate Uiese two sterokl products from one another.<br>
Accordingly in order to pnxluce ADD, the product of the inttial fermentation (AD) must be extracted, purified and then subjected to a second biotransfonnatiQn In order to produce ADD. Naturally, this pn&gt;cess Is e}^enslve and time-consuming as it involves the interruption of the AD fermentation, and tt\e removal and purification of AD prior to the second biotransfbmiatlon.<br><br>
It ]&amp; an object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate the above disadvantages.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides, In one aspect, a process of femienting a phytosterol composition to produce androstenedlone (androst-4-ene-3,17-<ilone or and subsequentty androstadlenedicme which comprises:></ilone>
propagating a microbial culture of the genus Mycobactarium In a first nutrient medium; placing the microbial c^ilture and the phytosterol composition in a bloreactorfor a sufficient time to transft^rn the composition substantially to androstenedlone (the "AD solution"); propagating a fungal culture of the genus Fusarfum In a second nutrient medium; and ttien injecting one or more of 1) Fusarium sp; or 2) the fungal culture medium comprising Fusarium sp. into the bioreactor for a suffldent time to transfonnn the AD solution to androsUHJienedlone.<br>
The present Invention further comprises a process of preparing androstadlenedione from androstenedlone which comprises fermenting AD In a bioreactor in the presence of 1) Fusa/ium sp; or 2) a Fuaarium ^fungal culture medium for a sufficient time to transform ^e AD Into ADD.<br>
The present invention further comprises compositions of ADD prepared by the aforementioned processes.<br>
Importantly, and a significant advantage of the process of the present invention. Is that the biotransformation of AD to ADD by Fusarium sp occurs in the same bioreactor as the prior bacterial transfbrmab'on i.e. it is the same one in which AD is produced from the phytostenal composition. In other words, the AD produced from the initial 'fermentation step is not removed from the bioreactor (as Is Known and practised In the art) but ratiier, the bioreactor is inoculated (as described fn more detail below) wtth either 1) the fungal culture, or 2) the fungal culture medium In order to transform the AD solution irvto ADD. It has been found thaX, surprisingly, Fusarium sp and in particular the preened strain as disclosed hereinbeiow retains Its capacity to transform AD to ADD despite the presence of the residual bacterial cultuns<br><br>
Accordingly, the process of the present Invention does not invoive the interruption of the initial AD fermentation, or the removal and purification of AD pilor to the second biotransformation. Significant time, energy and materials are saved.<br>
The present Invention also provides a novel microorganisni of the genus Fusaiium, hereinafter referred to as PTA-3947 or FMI33, which was deposited at ATCC as Fusaiium so/an/FMi 33 on Decemt)ar21, 2001.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The present invention Is Hlustrated by the following non-^imlting drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic showing themicrobiaiconversionofphytosterolstoADDin accordance with the present invention; and<br>
Figure 2 Is a flow diagram shoving the prefened procedure for biotransformation of AD to ADD by Fusarium so/on/ in accordance vi^h the present invention.<br>
DETAII^D DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following dialled description is provided to aid those skilled in the art \n practising the preswit invention. Hcwsuer, this detailed desorlption should not be constmed so as to unduly limit the scope of the present invention. Modifications and variations to the embodlmente discusswJ hwein may be made by those with ordinary skiH in the art without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention.<br>
in a first step of the present invention, a microbial culture of the genus Mycobacterium is propagated in a nutrient medium. There are many suitable cultivation media and conditions known and available in the art and the present invention is not Intended to be limited to any one. Nonetheless, in a preferred form, the Mycobacteiia sp. are grown in a seed medium comprising refiner's molasses, sodium nitrate, ammonium phosphate and glucose. The<br><br>
contents of US Patent No 6,071,714 to Kutney et al., in which appropriate cuiture media are described. Is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Generally, the nutrient media required for cultivation of the Mycobacteria sp and the Fusarjum sp should contain assimilable nitrogen and cartÂ»n and an adequate supply of sterile air maintained therein, for example by exposing a large surface of the media to air or pas^ng it through the media in quantities sufficient to support submerged growth.<br>
Suitable nitrogen sources are those normally employed for the purpose, including soybean meal, cottonseed meal, pancreatic digest of casein, fish meal, com steep liquor, meat extract, protein, autoiyzed brewer's yeast with milk solids, peptone, yeast extract, casein hydrol^ate, ntbate and/or ammonium compounds. Most of these may also be used as the cart&gt;on source. Other carbon containing substeinces include cartxjhydrates such as glycerol, glucose, fructose, sucnsse, lactose, maltose. Inositol, dextrin, molasses, starch and whey. Combinations of these carison and nitrogen sources may be used advantageously.<br>
Phosphate, magnesium and/or ferrous ions may be Incorporated as growth promoting factors if desired; buffers may be added to assure that growth is initiated as substantially neutral pH. Anti-foaming agents may be beneficial. Where isolated cells or enzymes are used to Induce fennentation rather than tfie Intact and growing microorganism, nutrients need not be present but in either event the medium is usually mostiy aqueous.<br>
In a Geocmd s^ of the present invention, the substrate (a phytosterol composition), dissolved in a ajitable solvent or in emulsified form, and the microbial culture are added to a btoreactor. Fermentation Is allowed to proceed until maximum substrate conversion (phytostensis to AD solution) is achieved.<br>
Any emuisl^ing agent may be used as long as it ^cilitates mixing of the phytosterol substrate in ^e solvent thereby oF^miang availability of the substrate to the miottolal cuiture. Examples include, but are not limited to ethyieneoxy adducts or fetty acid estors of polyglycols and ttiose commerdally avattable under tie names Teginâ¢, Tvireenâ¢ and Spanâ¢.<br>
In the alternative, soiubaizlng agente may be used to allow^e phytosterol composition to<br><br>
be dissolved bs form a clear solution, thereby affording excellent contact wl^ the microÂ¬organism utilized in the bio-conversion. These selected suitable solubilizing agents, which Include members of the glycol ^mlly and members of the silicone family, allow high concentrations of phytosterols to be dissolved in the nutrient medium. This provides for excellent contact with the micro-organism, reduces fermentation times, and affords relatively high yields of end-products. Prior-Known solubllzing agents such as sunflower oil are preferred.<br>
In a third step of the present Inventlo-i, a fun^l culture of ^e genus Fusarfum Is propagated In a second nutrient medium. As above, there are many suitable cultivation media and conditions knovm and availalsle In the art and the present invention Is not Intended to be limited to any one. Nonetheless, In a prefen-ed form, the Fusailum sp. are grown in a seed medium comprising com steep liquor and glucose.<br>
In a fourth step of the preserrt invention, the bioreactor comprising the AD solution is Injected with one or more of: 1) the FusaHum, or 2) the fungal culture medium (comprising fungal enzymes) In order to transform the AD soluton Into ADD. In a preferred embodiment, the tNoreactor is sterilized (for example by heating at around 120Â° C) prior to this injection to Idll the bacteria.<br>
The simplest and most economical way of proceeding wKh this "Injection" step Is to inoculate the sterilized bioreactor with some of the fungal culture medium. Alternatively, however, it Is possible to separate the fungal cells from the culture medium by, forexampie, centrifugation and Just Inject these cells. Moreover, the cells can be ruptured, ultrasonicaBy or othenvise, to teciHtate access to the enzymes present, which can be isolated by filtration or extracted with a solvent such as acetone and vrater and then injected Into Vne bioreactor instead of the medium or fungal celts.<br>
The optimal subsb^te concÂ«itration, substrate addition time and femientation period in each of the two "phases" (phytosterols to AD; AD to ADD) depends on tiie type of microorganism used and the exact fermentation conditions. The precise conditions could readily be detemnined without undue experimentation by anyone sidlled In this field.<br>
In a most preferred forni of the present invention, the bloconversion of the phytosterol composition to AD Is achieved by the use of MycobactBrium MB 3683. In a most<br><br>
preterred form of the present invention, the biooonversion of AD to ADO is achievod by ttiB use of ^her Fusarfum solan! or Fusarium oxysporum.<br>
Within one embodiment of the present Invention, mutation of F. solani, using nitrosoguanldlne has resulted in the production of a novel mutant which Is especially effective in transforming AD to ADD in the same reaction vessel as the transformation of the steroids to AD i.e.wlthout the necessity of separating AD torn the first fermentatjon step.   This mutant microoi^anlsm has been given the patent deposit designation PTA-3947 by the American Type Culture Collection ("ATCC"), 10801 University Blvd., Manassas VA, USA, 20110-2209, where It lias been deposited in a pennanent collection. A subculture of this microorganism Is available upon request thereto, however, It should be understood that such availability does not constitute a license to practise the subject invention.<br>
Figure 1 outlines the microbial and fungal fermentation steps of one embodiment of the present Invention wherein phytostenais are transformed by Mycobacterium sp. to AD and subsequently the AD Is transformed by Fusarium sp to ADD and boldenona.<br>
Figure 2 Illustrates a fuller embodiment of the present invention wherein ADD is prepared dlredlv from an AD source. A Fusarium sp. culture is propagated and the Inoculum added to a vessel comprising AD under femientation conditions. Thereafter ADD is isolated and purified.<br>
Phytostsrotfl/Phytostanols<br>
As us^ herain, the term "phytasterol composition" includes all sterols without llmi^tlon, for example: sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, Ijrasslcastavl (Induding dihydrobraasicasterol), desmostorol, chalinostefol, portferasterol, cjionasterol, ergostero). coprosterol, codisterol, isofucosterol, fuoosterol, derosteiol, norvisterol, lathosterol, stellastepd, spinasteroi, chondrtUastenol, peposterol, avenastorot, isoavenasterol, fecosterol, pollinastasterol, cholesterol and all natural or synthesized forms and derivatives thereof, including isomers, and includes all hydrog^ated counterparts ("phytostanols"). Phytostanols indudes all saturated or hydrogenated phytosterols and all natural or synthesized fomis and derivatives thereof, Including Isomers. It Is also to be understood that, when in doubt thnxjghout the specification, the term 'phytosterol composition' may encompass both phytosterols and phytostanols.<br><br>
The sterols and stands for use in the biotransfonnation of the present invention may be procured from a variety of natural sources. For example, they may be obtained from the processing erf plant cite (Including aquaUc plants) such as com oil and other vegetable oils, wheat genn oil, soy extract rice extract, rice bran, rapeseed oil, suntloweroil. sesame oH and fish (and other marine-source) oHs. They may also be derived from fungi, for example ergosierol. Accordingly, the present invention is not to be Kmltad to any one source of sterols. US Patent Serial No. 4,420,427 teaches the preparation of sterols frun vegetable ofl sludge using solvents such as methanol. Alternatively, phytosterols and phytostanols may be (kitalned irom tall oil pltc^ or pulping soap, by-products of fores&amp;y practises as descnbed in US Patent Serial No.5,770,749. Incorporated herein by reference.<br>
During the fermentation process, it is pretered that the temperature be maintained in the range of alaout 30-37'C, more preferably from 25-35" C. tvftwiltoring of the pH during the fermentation reveals that the pH can vary in the range of appnsximately 7.0 in the initial period to approximatety 4.7 at harvest time. Upon completion of the fermentation or transformation process, the ADD is recovered by means well known and practised in the art.<br>
The following examples represent laboratory trials. However, each can be extrapolated to industrial-scale application using icnown industrial techniques to implement the invention as described herein.<br>

This procedure of medium preparation is utilized for 40 L and larger working volumes.<br><br><br>
The necessary volume of Refiners molasses (54 mUL medium) Is mixed with water (100 mUL medium) and sterilized one day before use.<br>
All mmponents (indudlng the necessary volume of water, but excluding the phytosterola and the sunflower oil) are mixed under stlning in the fermentor to obtain a clear solution. Thenecessary volumeofwaterlscfdculated by substracting the volumes of nnolasses, oil and Inoculum from the de^red final \^lume. The pH of the medium is adjusted to 8.1 with aqueous NaOH solution (20%). The phytosterols and the sunfloweroil are added to the medium and the fermentor is sterilized (121X, 30-60 min).<br>
Comments: The blotransfonmation medium has 7 % dry substance (refractometrlcaliy measured).<br>
Biotransfbrmatlon with Mycobactertum In a Fermentor<br>
The bloconverslon experiments were performed in stainless steel fermentors with efficient bottom stinlng. The main parameters of the utilized fermantors are shown in Table 2. The temperature of the medium in the fermentor is adjusted to 30Â°C and the inoculum Is introduced under sterile conditions. The entire process is performed at 30'C. The pH and the sterility of the process are monitored from the beginning until the end of this stage. The monitoring of the substrate (phytosterols) and the product (AD) Is Initiated after 40 hours. Details on the analyticai procedures (HPLC, GC) and resufts are given below. The piH of the biotransformation mixture usually varies within 1 pH unit and is not corrected during the process. The biotransformation Is considered completed when maximal product (AD) concentration in the foam layer is achieved or when the substrate Oihytcstensl) concentration reaches 1/20-th of Its initial concentration.<br><br>
Note on morohoiogv (as Studied using a light microscope):<br><br>
At every stage, from agar stent to final harvest, the morphology of the cells remained the same, that is, the cells had bipolar nuclei and were rod-shaped.<br>
