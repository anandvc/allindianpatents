This invention relates to a Robo-Puppet - A robotic system for the automation of Puppetry.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART:<br>
The advancements in electronics and actuators have made automated animation of the puppets possible. Known method uses electromechanical actuator (like DC servo motor or stepper motor) or Pneumatic actuator for actuating various parts of the puppet. The actuators are embedded inside the puppets and hence a part of the puppet. The control of various actuators is done using a controller, based on the input it gets from either joysticks or a stored program. Such systems are used extensively in creating special effects in the movies and animated displays in museums.<br>
LIMITATIONS:<br>
In conventional puppetry, puppet manipulation is purely decided by the skill of the puppeteer. The same puppet can perform differently with different puppeteer bringing versatility to the animation of the puppet.<br>
Existing puppet with inbuilt actuators is not suitable for the automation of the conventional puppetry. Such a puppet cannot be used as a general-purpose puppet, which can perform as different character in different plays, which requires the versatility in actuation. The actuators in the knoAvn puppet are designed to do a certain specified tasks.<br>
The puppet is built with the actuators and hence the cost of the puppet is high. The size of the puppet is decided by the size of the actuators that are used Therefore very small puppet is difficult to make and the cost of such puppet will be high. The puppet is constructed to have a specific sequence of motions only. The sequence of motions stored in the controller memory will remain static. The programmability is limited. The programming also requires highly skilled person.<br><br>
PROPOSED SOLUTION:<br>
Though the art of animation has existed for several years there has not been any instance known to o\ir best of knowledge where a general-purpose robotic platform (Robo-Puppet) is developed to automate the conventional puppetry.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to build a robo-puppet having an electronic manipulator, to which, any suitable puppet can be stringed like a marionette.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a robo-puppet, which for all purposes will perform like a skilled puppeteer. In other words, it can do what a skilled person can do with his puppet.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a robo-puppet, which is cost effective and versatile.<br>
With the above objects in view, a general-purpose robot manipulator is first developed to which any suitable puppet can be stringed like in a marionette (stringed puppet). The robot manipulator pulls the strings and controls various parts of the puppet. A multi-axes real time controller (MARTC) controls various motions of the robot manipulator. The MARTC gets the information of motion for the manipulation from a personal computer. The personal computer has software with user- friendly graphic user interface with which the robot manipulator can be programmed using a set of joysticks or the keyboard. The personal computer has multimedia platform, which helps to play the voice needed for the puppetry, and at the same time synchronizes the motions of the puppet to the voice. There is a provision to program each puppet independently for ease of operation and later all the puppets can be manipulated together to play the final version of the puppetry. The means for creating and storing the required motion to be transmitted to the puppet is initially by an audio file created and stored in a PC for which the animation of the puppet is required. For creating the motion file the above audio track is played using the multi media available on the PC and simultaneously using joysticks various parts of the puppet are<br><br>
moved in accordance with the required choreography. The multi-axes real time controller (MARTC) stores in a compact flash card memory (CFM), all the movements of the puppet in synch with the music. Thus stored data in the CFM is called the motion data. The same motion file is sent to the PC to be stored in its hard disc. Next time when the audio track is played using the multi media of the PC, the MARTC sends the motion data to the puppet fi*om the CFM in synch with the audio track. Thus the puppet repeats the same actions programmed earlier in synch with the audio track.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawir^, wherein:<br>
Fig 1 shows the schematic block diagram of the proposed general- purpose robotic system (Robo-Puppet) developed for the purpose of puppet manipulation;<br>
Fig 2 shows the schematic block diagram of the Robo-Manipulator;<br>
Fig 3 shows the block diagram of the Multi-axes real time controller (MARTC)used in the robo-puppet of the present invention;<br>
Fig 4 shows the schematic block diagram of the Joystick Programmer; and<br>
Fig. 5 shows the mechanical arrangement for manipulating the hand of the puppet.<br>
The Robo-puppet of the present invention comprises of at least one robo-manipulator connected to a Multi-axes real time controller, which in tum is connected to a personal computer through a serial communication link. A joystick programmer is connected to the said multi-axes real time controller. The robo-manipulator is connected to the marionette or puppet through conventional strings.<br>
Robot Manipulator:<br>
Puppet has several parts, which can be moved (manipulated) by pulling strings. The Robot manipulator consists of several actuators, which are stepper motors or DC Servo Motors, Servo motors, Stepper motors. Solenoid, hydraulic actuators or any suitable<br><br>
electromechanical or pneumatic actuators, which are driven by the drivers in the MARTC. The actuators are coupled to different strings through appropriate mechanisms. The mechanisms are mechanical systems used for the motion translation to suit the required motion. The actuators manipulate the strings through the mechanisms. The corresponding manipulated part gets the required movement. Fig. 5 illustrates one such mechanical systems used for motion translation. When the actuators manipulate the strings through the mechanisms, the corresponding part of the puppet gets the required movement.<br>
Multi-axes Real Time Controller (MARTC):<br>
The MARTC is an intelligent controller, which controls the Robot-Manipulator based on the data it receives from either the joystick programmer or the PC through a commimication port. The schematic block diagram of MARTC is shown in Fig 3. It consists of a micro controller interfaced to a communication link and a set of actuator drives for multi-axes control. The output from the actuator drives the actuators placed in the Robot Manipulator.<br>
Fig 4 shows the schematic block diagram of the Joystick Programmer. The joystick programmer is an intelligent system, which continuously samples various joystick positions connected to it and generates the required manipxxlation data for the Multi-axes real time controller (MARTC). The puppeteer can manipulate the puppets by operating the joysticks. The joystick programmer consists of a micro controller interfaced to a conmnunication link and an appropriate hardware. The joysticks used are commercially available and used for playing video games. The joystick positions are sampled and digitized using the signal conditioning and the multiplexer hardware. Then the programmer transmits the data from all the joysticks to the PC and the MARTC in the form of data packets. The data sent to the MARTC is used to manipulate the puppet and that sent to the PC is stored for the replay or for fixture editing as a motion file.<br><br>
Fig. 5 shows the mechanical arrangement for manipulating the hand of the puppet. The hand of the puppet is connected to a string, which passes through the edge of an arm mounted on the shaft of motor Ml. The string then passes through another guide mounted axial to the axis of the motor Ml, before it is wound aroxmd a rotating drum mounted on the shaft of motor M2. When the motor Ml rotates, the hand makes only horizontal motion or moves right and left with the height of the hand from the ground constant. The motor M2 when rotated moves the hand only up and down. By the combination of motion of both the motors Ml and M2 we can achieve complex movements of the hand. Similar arrangements are done for the leg, head, back and etc.<br>
Communication Link:<br>
The commxmication link establishes the link between various modules for the flow of information. A special communication protocol is used to establish a reliable communication between different modules.<br>
Personal Computer (PC):<br>
The PC receives the data that is sent by the joystick programmer over the communication link. The computer stores the data as a motion data file. Thus stored motion data file can be used to play back the actions any time later. The data file can be edited or combined with another data file to generate more complex movements. There is a provision for combining many motion data files. The puppet programming can also be done using the keyboard of the PC and store the program as motion data file. There is a provision for step and repeat actions, which can be used to repeat the same action several times without having to manually program again.<br>
OPERATION OF THE ROBO-PUPPET OF THE PRESENT DJVENTION:<br>
Various motions/movements of the robo-puppet is initially created and the required motion data is generated. The PC receives the data that is sent by the joystick programmer or the keyboard used for the puppet manipulation. The computer stores the<br><br>
data as a motion data file. Thus, the motion data file is the data generated through the operation of the joystick or the keyboard. The motion data so generated by the joystick programmer or the PC is stored as a motion file and edited using the PC. Such motion files are used to play back the whole puppet show. It is possible to synchronize the motion and the voice of the puppet while play back. The user can use different voice streams to create puppet shows in different languages.<br>
During operation, the actuators receive the driving signals from the MARTC, which in turn is being converted/translated into a specified movement. This movement is sent to the puppet through the connecting strings. A sequence of drive signals coming fi^om the MARTC will manipulate the puppet to create a puppet show. The MARTC receives motion information fi'om either the joystick programmer or the PC through a communication link.<br>
A Robo-Puppet is developed for the first time, which can be used to automate the conventional puppetry.<br>
