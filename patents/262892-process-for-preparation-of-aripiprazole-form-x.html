DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used herein the term "crude" refers to crystals of aripiprazoie that have not been washed<br>
and/or recrystaliized to remove impurities that may be present.<br>
As used herein the term "crystalline" refers to crystals of aripiprazoie that have been washed<br>
and recrystaliized to remove impurities.<br>
As used herein the term "amorphous1' relates to solid material which lacks a regular<br>
crystalline structure.<br>
The term "room temperature" as used herein indicates that the applied temperature is not<br>
critical and that no exact temperature value has to be kept. Usually, "room temperature" is<br>
understood to mean temperatures of about 15°C to about 25°C (see e.g. EU Pharmacopeia<br>
5.0, page 6).<br>
The inventors of the present invention have identified novel polymorphs of aripiprazoie. The novel polymorphs have distinct physical properties and may be characterized e.g. by a typical X-ray powder diffraction pattern, infrared spectrum or a characteristic thermogravimetric (TGA) and differential scanning caiorimetric (DSC) curve. Each of these characteristics on its own is sufficient to unambiguously define and identify the new polymorphs but they also may be combined with each other.<br><br>
The present invention relates to a novel form X of aripiprazoie characterized by an X-ray powder diffraction pattern with peaks at 10.0, 11.6, 15.7,16.3, 18.5, 20.4, 21.8, 22.2 and 23.3 degrees 20 (2-theta).<br>

Form X of aripiprazoie is a novel anhydrous form, hereinafter also referred to as "form X",<br>
which is particularly stable and hence is suitable for bulk preparation and handling. Form X of aripiprazoie has been found to be of low hygroscopicity and does not substantially convert into a hydrated form of aripiprazoie. This can be seen from the moisture sorption isotherm of form X which is shown in Figure 10.<br>
The present invention further relates \Q anpiprazole ethanol hemisolvate characterized by an X-ray powder diffraction pattern with peaks at 17.4, 18.1, 19.6, 23.3 and 27.9 degrees 29.<br><br>

Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to aripiprazole ethanol hemisoivate characterized by an X-ray powder diffraction pattern substantially in accordance with Table 2 and Figure 5.<br>
Aripiprazole ethanol hemisoivate may be also characterized by a typical infrared spectrum as shown in Figure 2. Accordingly, in a further preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to aripiprazole ethanol hemisoivate characterized by an infrared spectrum substantially in accordance with Figure 2. Characteristic bands are present at 2949, 2816, 1670, 1378: 1192, 1171, 1047, 854, 830 and 746 cm"1.<br>
In addition, aripiprazole ethanol hemisoivate shows a typical step in the TGA curve and a characteristic DSC curve at a heating rate of of 5°K/min. Typical thermograms of aripiprazole ethanol hemisoivate are shown in Figure 8. It can be seen that the DSC curve of aripiprazole ethanol hemisoivate (sample pan with pinhole) shows an endothermic peak with an onset temperature of about 97°C followed by an exothermic event and two endothermic peaks with onset temperatures of about 139°C and 148DC.<br>

hi additiorL arpiorazofe methanol solvate shows a typical step in the TGA curve and a diasacfef^c DSC carve at a heating rate of of 5°K/min. Typical thermograms of aripiprazole osetenot soiveie are shown in Figure 9. It can be seen that the DSC curve of aripiprazole rae&amp;tanot sot^a^ (sample pan with pinhole) shows an endothermic peak with an onset temperature of about 113°C followed by an exothermic event and two endothermic peaks «tt&gt; oossi temperatures of about 139°C and 148°C.<br>
Accordingly, in a further preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to aripiprazole methanol solvate characterized by an endothermic peak with an onset temperature of about 113°C toiowed by an exothermic event and two endothermic peaks with onset temperatures of about 139~C and 148°C at a heating rate of 5DK/min in differential scanning calorimetry.<br>
As said before, each of the above mentioned data alone are sufficient to characterize each of the new polymorphs of aripiprazole. Therefore, further embodiments of the present invention relate to each polymorph being characterized by its typical X-ray powder diffraction pattern or its typical \n1rared spectrum or its typical thermogravimetric/differential scanning caiorimetnc curse.<br>
In one embodiment the preseaUnventi^^^	X of<br>
anpiprazoie, comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	dissolving aripiprazole in a suitable solvent by heating<br>
b)	slowly cooling the solution to room temperature or below to effect crystallization<br>
c)	optionaify isolating crystalline form X of aripiprazole.<br>
For preparing form X of aripiprazole according to the above first process, any other form of aripiprazole may be used, e.g. the forms disclosed in WO 03/026659 (conventional hydrate, hydrate A, conventional anhydride, anhydrate B, anhydrate C, anhydrate D, anhydrate E,<br><br>
anhydrate F, anhydrate G). In addition, also non-crystalline forms of aripiprazole such as the amorphous form and forms of low crystalline order or crude aripiprazole may be used.<br>
in parEJcuiar, the other novel forms of aripiprazoie of the present invention described above. i.e. ariprprazGie ethanol bemtsolvate and aripiprazole methanol solvate or an aripiprazoie hydrate may oe used to prepare form X of aripiprazole. Of course, also mixtures of two or more zMef&amp;wt forms of aripiprazoie may be used. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, the form used in ihe above first process In step a) is aripiprazole ethanol hemisolvate and/or ^KrazQie melhanof solvate and/or aripiprazole hydrate.<br>
Acrartfeg to ihe above first process a suitable solvent is a solvent in which the substance is not nighty settle. Unsuitable solvents are pure water, ethanol or methanol because the Gonrespoficing solvate is formed, in a preferred embodiment, the solvent used in step a) of the above first process is acetone, tetrahydrofuran or 2-propanol. The even more preferred solvent is 2-propanoi.<br>
The heating temperature applied in order to dissolve aripiprazole depends on the boiling point of the solvent used but usually will be in the range of 50°C to iOQ°C. A preferred temperature is the boiling temperature of the solvent. If 2-propanol is used, the aripiprazoie Is dissolved preferably in a concentration of about 20 g to about 40 g per liter 2-propanol by heating, most preferably in a concentration of about 30 g to about 35 g aripiprazole per liter 2-propanoL<br>
The crystallization step b) of the above first process may be facilitated by adding seed crystals 
 <br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides a second process for preparing form X of aripiprazoie characterized in that a suspension of aripiprazoie in a suitable solvent is seeded with crystals of form X and the suspension is stirred at a suitable temperature in order to effect transformation of the used form of aripiprazoie into form X.<br>
Just as for the first process described above also for this second process for preparing form X of »pprazoie any other form of aripiprazoie, i.e. any crystalline unsolvated or solvated tern, ocn* cn*s^oe or amorphous form or crude aripiprazoie may be used. Preferably, the ater ocwi fonss of aripprazoje of the present invention, i.e. aripiprazoie ethanol nenasoivs&amp;£ and aripiprazoie methanol solvate or an aripiprazoie hydrate may be used.<br>
Hom&amp;iBf, this second process is based on the solution mediated transformation of any form of mv&amp;mzz^e wiiieh is thermodynamicaiiy less stable under given conditions than form X. Therefore, the transformation into form X is a thermodynamicaiiy controlled process due to Ire fact that form X has the lowest Gibbs free energy at temperatures at and below about 6CTC. Consequently, all known solid crystalline or non-crystalline forms, of aripiprazoie may be used in the present process.<br>
Accorfng to the above second process a suitable solvent is a solvent or solvent mixture which does not form a crystalline solvate with aripiprazoie and in which the substance is not highly soluble, in a preferred embodiment, the solvent used in the above second process for preparing form X of aripiprazoie is selected from 2-propanol, acetone, 1-butanoI or 1-propanoi.<br>
The-tempera&amp;ire^t^hicixibe^^<br>
susoended form of aripiprazoie into form X depends on the form of aripiprazoie and the solvent used. Room temperature or an elevated temperature may be applied but usually it wtfl be in the range of 10CC to 60°C. However, it is crucial that solvent and temperature are chosen such that the used form of aripiprazoie remains in the condition of a suspension and does not become dissolved. It is well within the general knowledge of a person skilled in the art to determine a suitable solvent and temperature accordingly.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the solvent is 2-propanol and the preferred temperature range is about 10QC to about 80°C, preferably at a temperature of about 60°C to about 40°C, most preferable at a temperature of about 60°C to about 50°C for a time to form form X of<br><br>
aripiprazole. . Aripiprazole is then isolated after cooling the solution. A time sufficient for the formation of form X varies from a view minutes , e.g. 15 to 30 min to several days, e.g. 2 to 6 days. Optionally In intervals the suspension may be cooled to a lower temperature, e.g. to a temperature ro about ambient temperature and the suspension is then reheated to the desrred temperature.<br>
In a hriier enijoeirnent, the present invention provides a first process for preparing anpioarazole ethanol hemssoJvate, comprising the steps of-<br>
a)	&amp;mcfamig a^ppcazoie in ethanol by heating<br>
b)	sfawiy cocfeig fse solution to room temperature or below to effect crystallization cf iscfeSrag me crysEaBne ethanol hemisolvate<br>
d) drying the eshanol hemisolvate at a temperature below about 60DC.<br>
Jus! as for the processes for preparing form X of aripiprazole described above also for this first process for preparing aripiprazole ethanol hemisolvate any other form of aripiprazole, Le. any crystalline unsolvated or soivated form, any non-crystalline or amorphous form and crude aripiprazole may be used. Preferably, the other novel forms of aripiprazole of the present invention, i.e. form X of aripiprazole and aripiprazole methanol solvate or an aripiprazole hydrate may be used.<br>
The heating temperature applied in order to dissolve aripiprazole depends on the boiling pant of the soh/ent used but usually will be in the range of 50°C to 100°C. A preferred temperature is the boiling temperature of the solvent.<br>
Dryrng^he^thranof hemisolvateat atemperatunsrbetow about 60°C may be performed in<br>
different ways under different suitable conditions. Drying time and drying temperature are inversely related, so that for example the drying time will be longer the lower the drying temperature, and shorter the higher the drying temperature. Particularly suitable and preferred are air drying at room temperature, drying under vacuum at room temperature over night or drying at 50°C for 2 hours.<br>
Alternatively, instead of using pure ethanol as solvent for preparing the ethanol hemisolvate, aripiprazole may be dissolved \n a solvent in which aripiprazole is soluble at room temperature such as e.g. methylene choride, tetrahydrofuran or amides like e.g.<br><br>
dimethyiformamide, dimethyiacetamide or N-methylpyrrolidone. A suitable solvent is a solvent which allows dissolving one gram aripiprazoie in a volume of approximately 10 ml solvent or less at room temperature. Due to the good solubility only a little quantity of the sotvenx is neeaed. The concentrated solution is then diluted with ethanol resulting in the crystalfizstjcc? of aripiprazoie ethanol hemisolvate.<br>
7b© process provides high yields of aripiprazoie ethanol hemisolvate and also represents a<br>
piBcfeai meted for purification of crude aripiprazoie, because most of the impurities of cnjde arpiprazase are mere soluble than aripiprazoie ethanol hemisolvate and remain in<br>
sokiiorL<br>
Accordingly, m a further embodiment, the present invention provides a second process for preparing anp^pcazoie ethanol hemisolvate, comprising the steps of: a) dissolving anpiprazole in a solvent in which aripiprazoie is soluble at room temperature b\ tiftiSng the solution with ethanol<br>
c)	ssciaBog the crystalline ethanol hemisolvate<br>
d)	drying tt^e ethanol hemisolvate at a temperature below about 60DC.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the solvent used in the above second process for preparing aripiprazoie ethano! hemisolvate is selected from methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, dlmethyiformamide, dimethylacetamide or N-methylpyrrolidone.<br>
With respect to the aripiprazoie form used in step a) and the performance of drying step d) the same applies as said above for the first process for preparing aripiprazoie ethanol<br>
• hemisotyate^— —	„^_^„,,___-	.^^.^^^--^ -^—-^-=—-- --— -<br>
m a further embodiment, the present invention provides a third process for preparing aripiprazoie ethano! hemisolvate characterized in that a suspension of aripiprazoie in ethanol is stirred at a suitable temperature in order to effect transformation of the used form of anpiprazole into aripiprazoie ethanol hemisolvate.<br>
With respect to the aripiprazoie form used the same applies as said above for the first and-.* second process for preparing aripiprazoie ethanol hemisolvate.<br><br>
The temperature at which the suspension is stirred in order to effect transformation of the suspended form of aripiprazole into aripiprazole ethanoi hemisolvate may be room temperature or an elevated temperature. Usually, it will be in the range of 10DC to 40DC. However, it is crucial that the temperature is chosen such that the used form of aripiprazole remains in the condition of a suspension and does not become dissolved. It is well within the general knowledge of a person skilled in the art to determine a suitable temperature<br>
The p&amp;esenr wwen&amp;an also relates to a first process for preparing aripiprazole methanol<br>
sohraae conpds@ng the steps of:<br>
aj sfesofvirag arbfxazoie in methanol by heating<br>
b) mom&amp;g cocfeg the solution to room temperature or below to effect crystallization<br>
c| ©dating the crystalline methanol solvate<br>
o) drying tie methanol solvate at a temperature below about 60°C.<br>
Also for tfus first process for preparing aripiprazole methanol solvate any form of aripipcazote, i.e. any crystalline unsolvated or solvated form, any non-crystalline or amorphous form and crude aripiprazole may be used. Preferably, the other novel forms of aripiprazole of the present invention, i.e. form X of aripiprazole and aripiprazole ethano! hemisolvate or an aripiprazole hydrate may be used.<br>
Drying the methanol solvate at a temperature below about 60°C may be performed in eifferent ways under different suitable conditions. Drying time and drying temperature are inversely related, so that for example the diying time will be longer the lower the drying temperaturerand shorter the higher the drying temperature. Particularly suitable and<br>
preferred are air drying at room temperature, drying under vacuum at room temperature over night or drying at 50°C for 2 hours.<br>
Alternatively, instead of using pure methanol as solvent for preparing the methanol solvate, anp^prazole may be dissolved in a soivent in which aripiprazole is soluble at room temperature such as e.g. methylene choride, tetrahydrofuran or amides like e.g. dimethyfformarnide, dimethylacetamide or N-methylpyrrolidone. A suitable solvent is a solvent which allows dissolving one gram aripiprazole in a volume of approximately 10 mflSiitres solvent or less at room temperature. Due to the good solubility only a little quantity<br><br>
of the solvent is needed. The concentrated solution is then diluted with methanol resulting in the crystallization of aripiprazole methanol solvate.<br>
Hits process provides high yields of aripiprazole methanol solvate and also represents a practical metr*od for purification of crude aripiprazole, because most of the impurities of crude anqpramle are more soluble than aripiprazole methanol solvate and remain in solution.<br>
Accosting, n another aspect the present invention relates to a second process for prspsi^ig arpw-azDte methanol soivate, comprising the steps of:<br>
m dssofving arac^azo^e in a solvent in which aripiprazole is soluble at room temperature t) cfikjiang the solution with methanol<br>
c)	isolating the crystafisne methanol soivate<br>
d)	drying the methanol solvate at a temperature below about 60°C.<br>
k\ a preferred embodiment, the solvent used in the above second process for preparing aripiprazote methanol soivate is selected from methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, cftrnetrry1tormarn»deT dimethylacetamide or N-methylpyrrolidone.<br>
With respect to the aripiprazole form used in step a) and the performance of drying step d) the same sopites, as said above for the first process for preparing aripiprazole methanol<br>
soh/aie.<br>
in a further embodiment, the present invention provides a third process for preparing<br>
anpft^YOfein^	in methanol<br>
is stirred at a suitable temperature in order to effect transformation of the used form of aripiprazote into aripiprazole methanol solvate.<br>
With respect to the aripiprazole form used the same applies as said above for the first and second process for preparing aripiprazole methanol solvate.<br>
Toe temperature at which the suspension is stirred in order to effect transformation of the suspended form of aripiprazole into aripiprazole methanol solvate may be room temperature or an elevated temperature. Usually, it will be in the range of 10°C to 40°C. However, it is<br><br>
crucial that the temperature is chosen such that the used form of aripiprazole remains in the concftion of a suspension and does not become dissolved. It is well within the general knowledge of a person skilled in the art to determine a suitable temperature accordingly.<br>

bemsofVHiB for use as a medicament.<br>
The novel forms of aripiprazoie are particularly useful for the treatment of schizophrenia. Therefore, the present invention also relates to the use of form X of aripiprazole or arspiprazote ethanol hernisoivate for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of schizophrenia.<br>
Tne present invention further relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount cf form X of aripiprazole or aripiprazole ethanol hernisoivate and a pharmaceuticaiiy acceptabie carrier. The pharmaceutical composition may be prepared via a wet granulation process as known in the state of the art and as described for other cr/stailne and potymorphic forms in WO 03/026659. Another suitable preparation may be forming flash-meit tablets.<br>
