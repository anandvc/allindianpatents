CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0002] The present application is related to and claims priority from U.S. Provisional<br>
Patent Application Serial No. 60/664,040 titled "Liquid Formulations For Treatment Of<br>
Diseases Or Conditions," filed Mar. 21,2005, U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial<br>
No. 60/664,306 titled "In Situ Gelling Formulations And Liquid Formulations For<br>
Treatment of Diseases Or Conditions," filed Mar. 21, 2005, U.S. Provisional Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 60/651,790, titled "Formulations For Ocular Treatment," filed Feb.<br>
9, 2005, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The retina of the eye contains the cones and rods that detect light. In the center<br>
of the retina is the macula lutea, which is about 1/3 to 1/2 cm in diameter. The macula<br>
provides detailed vision, particularly in the center (the fovea), because the cones are<br>
higher in density. Blood vessels, ganglion cells, inner nuclear layer and cells, and the _<br>
plexiform layers are all displaced to one side (rather than resting above the cones), thereby<br>
allowing light a more direct path to the cones.<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
[0004] Under the retina are the choroid, comprising a collection of blood vessels<br>
embedded within a fibrous tissue, and the deeply pigmented epithelium, which overlays<br>
the choroid layer. The choroidal blood vessels provide nutrition to the retina (particularly<br>
its visual cells).<br>
[0005] There are a variety of retinal disorders for which there is currently no treatment<br>
or for which the current treatment is not optimal. Retinal disorders such as uveitis (an<br>
inflammation of the uveal tract: iris, ciliary body, and choroid), central retinal vein<br>
occlusive diseases (CRVO), branch retinal venous occlusion (BRVO), macular<br>
degeneration, macular edema, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and retinal detachment<br>
generally are all retinal disorders that are difficult to treat with conventional therapies.<br>
[0006] Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the major cause of severe visual<br>
loss in the United States for individuals over the age of 60. AMD occurs in either an<br>
atrophic or less commonly an exudative form. The atrophic form of AMD is also called<br>
"dry AMD," and the exudative form of AMD is also called "wet AMD."<br>
[0007] In exudative AMD, blood vessels grow from the choriocapillaris through defects<br>
in Bruch's membrane, and in some cases the underlying retinal pigment epithelium.<br>
Organization of serous orhemorrhagic exudates escaping from these vessels results in<br>
-" fibro vascular scarring of the macular region with attendant degeneration of the<br>
neuroretina, detachment and tears of the retinal pigment epithelium, vitreous hemorrhage<br>
and permanent loss of central vision. This process is responsible for more than 80% of<br>
cases of significant visual loss in subjects with AMD. Current or forthcoming treatments<br>
include laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy, treatment with VEGF antibody<br>
fragments, treatment withpegylated aptamers, and treatment with certain small molecule<br>
agents.<br>
[0008] Several studies have recently described the use of laser photocoagulation in the<br>
treatment of initial or recurrent neovascular lesions associated with AMD (Macular<br>
Photocoagulation Study Groups (1991) in Arch. Ophthal. 109:1220; Arch. Ophthal<br>
109:1232; Arch. Ophthal. 109:1242). Unfortunately, AMD subjects with subfoveal<br>
lesions subjected to laser treatment experienced a rather precipitous reduction in visual<br>
acuity (mean 3 lines) at 3 months follow-up. Moreover, at two years post-treatment<br>
treated eyes had only marginally better visual acuity than their untreated counterparts<br>
(means of 20/320 and 20/400, respectively). Another drawback of the procedure is that<br>
vision after surgery is immediately worse.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
[0009] Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a form of phototherapy, a term encompassing all<br>
treatments that use light to produce a beneficial reaction in a subject. Optimally, PDT<br>
destroys unwanted tissue while sparing normal tissue. Typically, a compound called a<br>
photosensitizer is administered to the subject. Usually, the photosensitizer alone has little<br>
or no effect on the subject. When light, often from a laser, is directed onto a tissue<br>
containing the photosensitizer, the photosensitizer is activated and begins destroying<br>
targeted tissue. Because the light provided to the subject is confined to a particularly<br>
targeted area, PDT can be used to selectively target abnormal tissue, thus sparing<br>
surrounding healthy tissue. PDT is currently used to treat retinal diseases such as AMD.<br>
PDT is currently the mainstay of treatment for subfoveal choroidal neovascularization in<br>
subjects with AMD (Photodynamic Therapy for Subfoveal Choroidal Neovascularization<br>
in Age Related Macular Degeneration with Verteporfin (TAP Study Group) Arch<br>
Ophthalmol. 1999 117:1329-1345.<br>
[0010] Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) has proven to be recalcitrant to treatment<br>
in most cases. Conventional laser treatment can ablate CNV and help to preserve vision<br>
in selected cases not involving the center of the retina, but this is limited to only about<br>
10% of the cases. Unfortunately, even with successful conventional-laser<br>
photocoagulation, the neovascularization recurs in about 50-70% of eyes (50% over 3<br>
years and &gt;60% at 5 years). (Macular Photocoagulation Study Group, Arch. Ophthalmol.<br>
204:694-701 (1986)). In addition, many subjects who develop CNV are not good<br>
candidates for laser therapy because the CNV is too large for laser treatment, or the<br>
location cannot be determined so that the physician cannot accurately aim the laser.<br>
Photodynamic therapy, although utilized in up to 50% of new cases of subfoveal CNV has<br>
only marginal benefits over natural history, and generally delays progression of visual loss<br>
rather than improving vision which is already decreased secondary to the subfoveal lesion.<br>
PDT is neither preventive or definitive. Several PDT treatments are usually required per<br>
subject and additionally, certain subtypes of CNV fare less well than others.<br>
[0011] Thus, there remains a long-felt need for methods, compositions, and<br>
formulations that may be used to optimally prevent or significantly inhibit choroidal<br>
neovascularization and to prevent and treat wet AMD.<br>
[0012] In addition to AMD, choroidal neovascularization is associated with such retinal<br>
disorders as presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, myopic degeneration, angioid<br>
streaks, idiopathic central serous chorioretinopathy, inflammatory conditions of the retina<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
and or choroid, and ocular trauma. Angiogenic damage associated with<br>
neovascularization occurs in a wide range of disorders including diabetic retinopathy,<br>
venous occlusions, sickle cell retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, retinal detachment,<br>
ocular ischemia and trauma.<br>
[0013] Uveitis is another retinal disorder that has proven difficult to treat using existing<br>
therapies. Uveitis is a general term that indicates an inflammation of any component of<br>
the uveal tract. The uveal tract of the eye consists of the iris, ciliary body, and choroid.<br>
Inflammation of the overlying retina, called retinitis, or of the optic nerve, called optic<br>
neuritis, may occur with or without accompanying uveitis.<br>
[0014] Uveitis is most commonly classified anatomically as anterior, intermediate,<br>
posterior, or diffuse. Posterior uveitis signifies any of a number of forms of retinitis,<br>
choroiditis, or optic neuritis. Diffuse uveitis implies inflammation involving all parts of<br>
the eye, including anterior, intermediate, and posterior structures.<br>
[0015] The symptoms and signs of uveitis may be subtle, and vary considerably<br>
depending on the site and severity of the inflammation. Regarding posterior uveitis, the<br>
most common symptoms include the presence of floaters and decreased vision. Cells in<br>
the vitreous humor, white or yellow-white lesions in the retina and/or underlying choroid,<br>
- exudative retinal detachments, retinal vasculitis, and optic nerve edema may also be<br>
present in a subject suffering from posterior uveitis.<br>
[0016] Ocular complications of uveitis may produce profound and irreversible loss of<br>
vision, especially when unrecognized or treated improperly. The most frequent<br>
complications of posterior uveitis include retinal detachment; neovascularization of the<br>
retina, optic nerve, or iris; and cystoid macular edema.<br>
[0017] Macular edema (ME) can occur if the swelling, leaking, and hard exudates noted<br>
in background diabetic retinopathy (BDR) occur within the macula, the central 5% of the<br>
retina most critical to vision. Background diabetic retinopathy (BDR) typically consists<br>
of retinal microaneurisms that result from changes in the retinal microcirculation. These<br>
rnicroaneurisms are usually the earliest visible change in retinopathy seen on exam with<br>
an ophthalmoscope as scattered red spots in the retina where tiny, weakened blood vessels<br>
have ballooned out. The ocular findings in background diabetic retinopathy progress to<br>
cotton wool spots, intraretinal hemorrhages, leakage of fluid from the retinal capillaries,<br>
and retinal exudates. The increased vascular permeability is also related to elevated levels<br>
of local growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor. The macula is rich in<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
cones, the nerve endings that detect color and upon which daytime vision depends. When<br>
increased retinal capillary permeability effects the macula, blurring occurs in the middle<br>
or just to the side of the central visual field, rather like looking through cellophane.<br>
Visual loss may progress over a period of months, and can be very annoying because of<br>
the inability to focus clearly. ME is a common cause of severe visual impairment.<br>
[0018] There have been many attempts to treat CNV and its related diseases and<br>
conditions, as well as other conditions such as macular edema and chronic inflammation,<br>
with pharmaceuticals. For example, use of rapamycin to inhibit CNV and wet AMD has<br>
been described in U.S. Application No. 10/665,203, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety. The use of rapamycin to treat inflammatory diseases of the eye<br>
has been described in US patent number 5,387,589, titled Method of Treating Ocular<br>
Inflammation, with inventor Prassad Kulkami, assigned to University of Louisville<br>
Research Foundation, the contents of which is incorporated herein in its entirety.<br>
[0019] Particularly for chronic diseases, including those described herein, there is a<br>
great need for long acting methods for delivering therapeutic agents to the eye, such as to<br>
the posterior segment to treat CNV in such diseases as AMD, macular edema,<br>
prohTerative retmopathies, and chronic inflammation. Formulations with extended<br>
-• delivery of therapeutic agent are more comfortable and convenient for a subject, due to a<br>
diminished frequency of ocular injections of the therapeutic agent.<br>
[0020] Direct delivery of therapeutic agents to the eye rather than systemic<br>
administration may be advantageous because the therapeutic agent concentration at the<br>
site of action is increased relative to the therapeutic agent concentration in a subject's<br>
circulatory system. Additionally, therapeutic agents may have undesirable side effects<br>
when delivered systemically to treat posterior segment disease. Thus, localized drug<br>
delivery may promote efficacy while decreasing side effects and systemic toxicity.<br>
SUMMARY<br>

Therapeutic agents that may be used are described in detail in the Tiierapeutic Agents<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
section. Such therapeutic agents include but are not limited to immunophilin binding<br>
compounds. Immunophilin binding compounds that may be used include but are not<br>
limited to the limus family of compounds described further in the Therapeutic Agents<br>
section herein, including rapamycin, SDZ-RAD, tacrolimus, everolimus, pimecrolimus,<br>
CCI-779, AP23841, ABT-578, derivatives, analogs, prodrugs, salts and esters thereof.<br>

diseases and conditions that may be treated, prevented, inhibited, have onset delayed, or<br>
caused to regress using therapeutic agents othet than rapamycin are described in the<br>
Diseases and Conditions section of the Detailed Description.<br>
[0025] One liquid formulation described herein comprises a solution that includes a<br>
therapeutic agent dissolved in a solvent. Generally, any solvent that has the desired effect<br>
may be used in which the therapeutic agent dissolves and which can be administered to a<br>
subject, including but not limited to a human subject or an eye of a subject. Generally,<br>
any concentration of therapeutic agent that has the desired effect can be used. The<br>
formulation in some variations is a solution which is unsaturated, a saturated or a<br>
supersaturated solution. The solvent may be a pure solvent or may be a mixture of liquid<br>
solvent components. In some variations the solution formed is an in situ gelling<br>
formulation. Solvents and types of solutions that may be used are well known to those<br>
versed in such drug delivery technologies.<br>
[0026] The liquid formulations described herein may form a non-dispersed mass when<br>
placed into a rabbit eye, including but not limited to the vitreous of a rabbit eye. In some<br>
variations the non-dispersed mass comprises a gel. In some variations, the liquid<br>
formulation comprises a therapeutic agent and a plurality of polymers. In some<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
variations one of the polymers is polyacrylate or polymethacrylate. In some variations<br>
one of the polymers is polyvinylpyrrolidone.<br>
[0027] In some variations, the non-dispersed mass comprises a depot. In some<br>
variations, the non-dispersed mass consists of a depot.<br>
[0028] For liquid formulations which form a non-dispersed mass, the non-dispersed<br>
mass may generally be any geometry or shape. The non-dispersed mass-forming liquid<br>
formulations may, for instance, appear as a compact spherical mass when placed in the<br>
vitreous. In some variations the liquid formulations described herein form a milky or<br>
whitish colored semi-contiguous or semi-solid non-dispersed mass relative to the medium<br>
in which it is placed, when placed in the vitreous.<br>
[0029] The liquid formulations may generally be administered in any volume that has<br>
the desired effect. In one method a volume of a liquid formulation is administered to the<br>
vitreous and the liquid formulation is less than one half the volume of the vitreous.<br>
[0030] Routes of administration that may be used to administer a liquid formulation<br>
include but are not limited to (1) placement of the liquid formulation by placement,<br>
including by injection, into a medium, including but not limited to an aqueous medium in<br>
the body, including but not limited to intraocular or periocular injection; or (2) oral<br>
-' administration of the liquid formulation. The liquid formulation may be administered<br>
systemically, including but not limited to the following delivery routes: rectal, vaginal,<br>
infusion, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intraarterial, intrathecal, intrabronchial,<br>
intracisternal, cutaneous, subcutaneous, intradermal, transdermal, intravenous,<br>
intracervical, intraabdominal, intracranial, intrapulmonary, intrathoracic, intratracheal,<br>
nasal, buccal, sublingual, oral, parenteral, or nebulised or aerosolized using aerosol<br>
propellants. In some variations, the liquid formulation is administered subconjunctivally.<br>
In some variations, the liquid formulation is administered intravitreally.<br>
[0031] The liquid formulations described herein maybe delivered to any medium of a<br>
subject, including but not limited to a human subject, including but not limited to an<br>
aqueous medium of a subject.<br>
[0032] One liquid formulation described herein comprises a liquid formulation of<br>
rapamycin or other therapeutic agent. The liquid formulations may comprise a solution,<br>
suspension, an in situ gelling formulation, or an emulsion. The droplets in the emulsion<br>
may generally be of any size, including but not limited to up to about 5,000 nm.<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
[0033] In some formulations described herein, the liquid formulations may comprise a<br>
therapeutic agent including but not limited to rapamycin, and one or more solubilizing<br>
agents or solvents. In some variations, the solubilizing agent or solvent is glycerin,<br>
DMSO, DMA, N-methylpyrrolidones ethanol, benzyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol,<br>
polyethylene glycol of various molecular weights, including but not limited to PEG 300<br>
and PEG 400, or propylene glycol or a mixture of one or more thereof.<br>
[0034] In some formulations described herein, the liquid formulation includes<br>
hyaluronic acid.<br>
[0035] The liquid formulations described herein may deliver a therapeutic agent or<br>
agents for an extended period of time. One nonlimiting example of such an extended<br>
release delivery system is a liquid formulation that delivers a therapeutic agent or agents<br>
to a subject, including but not limited to a human subject or to the eye of a subject in an<br>
amount sufficient to maintain an amount effective to treat, prevent, inhibit, delay onset of,<br>
or cause regression of a disease or condition in a subject for an extended period of time.<br>
In some variations, the liquid formulation is used to treat a disease or condition in a<br>
subject, including but not limited to a human subject. In some variations, the liquid<br>
formulation delivers the therapeutic agent for at least about one, about two, about three,<br>
about six, about nine, or about twelve months.<br>
[0036] The liquid formulations described herein may deliver rapamycin or other<br>
therapeutic agents for an extended period of time. One nonlimiting example of such an<br>
extended release delivery system is a liquid formulation that delivers rapamycin to a<br>
subject, including but not limited to a human subject or to the eye of a subject in an<br>
amount sufficient to maintain an amount effective to treat, prevent, inhibit, delay onset of,<br>
or cause regression of wet age-related macular degeneration for an extended period of<br>
time. In some variations, the liquid formulation is used to treat wet age-related macular<br>
degeneration for an extended period of time. In some variations, the liquid formulation is<br>
used to prevent wet age-related macular degeneration for an extended period of time. In<br>
some variations, the liquid formulation is used to prevent transition of dry AMD to wet<br>
AMD for an extended period of time. In one nonlimiting example, the liquid formulation<br>
delivers the rapamycin to the vitreous, sclera, retina, choroid, macula, or other tissues of a<br>
subject, including but not limited to a human subject in an amount sufficient to treat,<br>
prevent, inhibit, delay onset of, or cause regression of wet age-related macular<br>
degeneration for at least about three, about six, about nine, or about twelve months. In<br>

WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
prolong success of an argon laser trabeculectomy or other glaucoma-related surgery. In<br>
some variations, the formulations and pharmaceutical formulations described herein have<br>
a neuroprotective effect and are used to treat glaucoma.<br>
[0086] In some variations, the formulations and pharmaceutical formulations described<br>
herein are used to treat retinitis pigmentosa. In some variations, the formulations and<br>
pharmaceutical formulations described herein for treating glaucoma comprise a limus<br>
compound such as rapamycin, and are used to treat, prevent, or delay onset of retinitis<br>
pigmentosa. In some variations, the formulations and pharmaceutical formulations<br>
described herein have a neuroprotective effect and are used to treat retinitis pigmentosa.<br>
[0087] In some variations, the formulations and pharmaceutical formulations described<br>
herein are used to treat one or more of central retinal vein occlusive diseases (CRVO),<br>
branch retinal venous occlusion (BRVO), retinal vascular diseases and conditions,<br>
macular edema, diabetic macular edema, iris neovascularization, diabetic retinopathy, or<br>
corneal graft rejection. In some variations, a formulations or pharmaceutical formulation<br>
comprises a limus compound such as rapamycin, and is administered to treat, prevent, or<br>
delay onset of one or more of these diseases or conditions. In some variations the<br>
formulations and pharmaceutical formulations are administered subconjunctivally to an<br>
eye with vision of 20/40 or better.<br>
[0088] When used to treat, prevent, inhibit, delay the onset of, or cause regressions of<br>
uveitis, the formulations and pharmaceutical formulations described herein may be<br>
administered by a variety of routes as is known in the art, including but not limited to by<br>
ocular or oral administration. Other routes of administration are known and are routine in<br>
the art. In some variations, the formulations described herein comprise rapamycin and are<br>
used to treat uveitis.<br>
[0089] One disease that may be treated, prevented, inhibited, have onset delayed, or be<br>
caused to regress using the formulation, liquid formulations and methods described herein<br>
is the wet form of AMD. In some variations wet AMD is treated using the formulations,<br>
liquid formulations and methods described herein. The wet form of AMD is<br>
characterized by blood vessels growing from their normal location in the choroid into an<br>
undesirable position under the retina. Leakage and bleeding from these new blood vessels<br>
results in vision loss and possibly blindness.<br>
[0090] The formulations, liquid formulations, and methods described herein may also<br>
be used to prevent or slow the transition from the dry form of AMD (wherein the retinal<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
pigment epithelium or RPE degenerates and leads to photoreceptor cell death and the<br>
formation of yellow deposits called drusen under the retina) to the wet form of AMD.<br>
[0091 ] "Macular degeneration" is characterized by the excessive buildup of fibrous<br>
deposits in the macula and retina and the atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium. As<br>
used herein, an eye "afflicted" with macular degeneration is understood to mean that the<br>
eye exhibits at least one detectable physical characteristic associated with the disease of<br>
macular degeneration. The administration of rapamycin appears to limit and regress<br>
angiogenesis, such as choroidal neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration<br>
(AMD), which may occur without treatment. As used herein, the term "angiogenesis"<br>
means the generation of new blood vessels ("neovascularization") into a tissue or organ.<br>
An "angiogenesis-mediated disease or condition" of the eye or retina is one in which new<br>
blood vessels are generated in a pathogenic manner in the eye or retina, resulting in<br>
dimunition or loss of vision or other problem, e.g.. choroidal neovascularization<br>
associated with AMD.<br>
[0092] The formulations and liquid formulations described herein, including but not<br>
limited to rapamycin-containing formulations and liquid formulations, may also be used<br>
to treat, prevent, inhibit, delay the onsetof~or cause regression of various immune-related<br>
diseases and conditions, including but not limited to organ transplant rejection in a host,<br>
graft vs. host disease, autoimmune diseases, diseases of inflammation, hyperproliferative<br>
vascular disorders, solid tumors, and fungal infections. In some variations, the<br>
formulations and liquid formulations described herein, including but not limited to<br>
rapamycin-containing formulations and liquid formulations, are used to treat various<br>
immune-related diseases and conditions, including but not limited to organ transplant<br>
rejection in a host, graft vs. host disease, autoimmune diseases, diseases of inflammation,<br>
hyperproliferative vascular disorders, solid tumors, and fungal infections. The<br>
formulations and liquid formulations described herein, including but not limited to<br>
rapamycin-containing formulations and liquid formulations, may be used as<br>
immunosuppressants. The formulations and liquid formulations described herein,<br>
including but not limited to rapamycin-containing formulations and liquid formulations,<br>
may be used to treat, prevent, inhibit, or delay the onset of rejection of transplanted organs<br>
or tissues including but not limited to transplanted heart, liver, kidney, spleen, lung, small<br>
bowel, pancreas, and bone marrow. In some variations, the formulations and liquid<br>
formulations described herein are used to treat the onset of rejection of transplanted<br>
28<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
organs or tissues including but not limited to transplanted heart, liver, kidney, spleen,<br>
lung, small bowel, pancreas, and bone marrow. When used to treat, prevent, inhibit, delay<br>
the onset of, or cause regressions of immune-related diseases, including but not limited to<br>
transplant rejection, the formulations and liquid formulations described herein may be<br>
administered by a variety of routes as is known in the art, including but not limited to by<br>
oral administration.<br>
[0093] Systemic administration may be achieved by oral administration of the liquid<br>
formulation. Other systemic routes of administration are known and are routine in the art.<br>
Some examples thereof are listed in the Detailed Description section.<br>
[0094] As used herein, to "inhibit" a disease or condition by administration of a<br>
therapeutic agent means that the progress of at least one detectable physical characteristic<br>
or symptom of the disease or condition is slowed or stopped following administration of<br>
the therapeutic agent as compared to the progress of the disease or condition without<br>
administration of the therapeutic agent.<br>
[0095] As used herein, to "prevent" a disease or condition by administration of a<br>
therapeutic agent means that the detectable physical characteristics or symptom of the<br>
disease or condition do not develop following-administration of the therapeutic agent<br>
[0096] As used herein, to "delay onset of a disease or condition by administration of a<br>
therapeutic agent means that at least one detectable physical characteristic or symptom of<br>
the disease or condition develops later in time following administration of the therapeutic<br>
agent as compared to the progress of the disease or condition without administration of<br>
the therapeutic agent.<br>
[0097] As used herein, to "treat" a disease or condition by administration of a<br>
therapeutic agent means that the progress of at least one detectable physical characteristic<br>
or symptom of the disease or condition is slowed, stopped, or reversed following<br>
administration of the therapeutic agent as compared to the progress of the disease or<br>
condition without administration of the therapeutic agent.<br>
[0098] As used herein, to "cause regression of a disease or condition by administration<br>
of a therapeutic agent means that the progress of at least one detectable physical<br>
characteristic or symptom of the disease or condition is reversed to some extent following<br>
administration of the therapeutic agent.<br>

administration of the therapeutic agents described herein. In some variations the<br>
therapeutic agents are administered to a mammalian subject. In some variations the<br>
therapeutic agents are administered to a human subject. In some variations the therapeutic<br>
agents may be administered to a veterinary animal subject. In some variations the<br>
therapeutic agents may be administered to a model experimental animal subject.<br>

Liquid formulations<br>
[0101] The liquid formulations described herein contain a therapeutic agent and may<br>
generally be any liquid formulation, including but not limited to solutions, suspensions,<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
and emulsions. In some variations the liquid formulations form a non-dispersed mass<br>
relative to a surrounding medium when placed in the vitreous of a rabbit eye.<br>
[0102] When a certain volume of a liquid formulation is administered, it is understood<br>
that there is some imprecision in the accuracy of various devices that may be used to<br>
administer the liquid formulation. Where a certain volume is specified, it is understood<br>
that this is the target volume. However, certain devices such as insulin syringes are<br>
inaccurate to greater than 10%, and sometimes inaccurate to greater than 20% or more.<br>
Hamilton HPLC type syringes are generally considered precise to within 10%, and are<br>
recommended for volumes below 10 l are to be injected.<br>
[0103] In some variations, a volume of a liquid formulation described herein is<br>
administered to the vitreous of a rabbit eye or a subject's, including but not limiting a<br>
human subject's eye that is less than about 500 l, less than about 400 l, less than about<br>
300 l, less than about 200 l, less than about 100 l, less than about 90 l, less than<br>

about 40 l, less than about 30 l, less than about 20 l, less than about 10 l, less than<br>
about 5 l, less than about 3 l, or less than about 1 l. In some variations, a volume of a<br>
liquid fomulation described herein is administered to the vitreous of a rabbit eye or<br>
subject's, including but not limited to a human subject's eye that is less than about 20 l.<br>
In some variations, a volume of a liquid formulation described herein is administered to<br>
the vitreous that is less than about 10 l. In some variations, a volume of a liquid<br>
formulation described herein is administered to the vitreous of a rabbit eye or a subject's,<br>
including but not limited to a human subject's eye that is between about 0.1 l and about<br>
200 l, between about 50 l and about 200 l, between about 50 l and about 150 l,<br>

about 20 l, between about 1l and about 10 l, or between about 1l and about 5 l. In<br>
some variations, a volume of a liquid formulation described herein is administered to the<br>
vitreous of a rabbit eye or a subject's, including but not limited to a human subject's eye<br>
that is between about ll and about 10 l. In some variations, a volume of a liquid<br>

including but not limited to a human subject's eye that is between about 1 l and about 5<br>
l. In some variations, a volume of a liquid formulation described herein is administered<br>
to the vitreous of a rabbit eye or a subject's eye that is between about 1l and about 5 l.<br>

In some variations, a volume of a liquid formulation described herein is administered to<br>
the vitreous of a rabbit eye or a subject's, including but not limited to a human subject's<br>
eye that is between about 0.1l and about 200 l.<br>
[0104] In some variations, a total volume of a liquid formulation described herein is<br>
subconjunctivally administered to a rabbit eye or a subject's, including but not limited to a<br>
human subject's eye that is less than about 1000 l, less than about 900 l, less than about<br>

administered to a rabbit eye or a subject's, including but not limited to a human subject's<br>
eye that is less than about 20 l. In some variations, a volume of a liquid formulation<br>
described herein is subconjunctivally administered to a rabbit eye or a subject's, including<br>
but not limited to a human subject's eye that is less than about 10 l. In some variations, a<br>
volume of a liquid formulation described heremis subconjunctiyally admiristered to a<br>
rabbit eye or a subject's, including but not limited to a human subject's eye that is<br>
between about 0.1l and about 200 l, between about 50 l and about 200 l, between<br>

about 1l and about 30 l, between about 1l and about 20 l, between about 1l and<br>
about 10 l, or between about 1l and about 5 l. In some variations, a volume of a liquid<br>
formulation described herein is subconjunctivally administered to a rabbit eye or a<br>
subject's, including but not limited to a human subject's eye that is between about 1l and<br>
about 10 l. In some variations, a volume of a liquid formulation described herein is<br>
subconjunctivally administered to a rabbit eye or a subject's, including but not limited to a<br>
human subject's eye that is between about 1l and about 5 l. In some variations, a<br>
volume of a liquid formulation described herein is administered to subconjunctivally<br>
administered to a rabbit eye or a subject's, including but not limited to a human subject's<br>
32<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
eye that is between about 1l and about 5 l. In some variations, a volume of a liquid<br>
formulation described herein is administered to subconjunctivally administered to a rabbit<br>
eye or a subject's, including but not limited to a human subject's eye that is between about<br>
0.1l and about 200 l.<br>
[0105] In some variations the liquid formulations described herein are administered in<br>
multiple subconjunctival locations within a period of time, including without limitation<br>
within an hour of one another. Without being bound by theory, it is thought that such<br>
multiple administrations, such as multiple injections, allow for a greater total dose to be<br>
administered subconjunctivally than a single dose due to a potentially limited ability of<br>
the local ocular tissues to absorb larger volumes.<br>
[0106] One liquid formulation described herein is an in situ gelling formulation. In situ<br>
gelling formulations, as described herein, comprise a therapeutic agent and a plurality of<br>
polymers which give a formulation that forms a gel or a gel-like substance when placed in<br>
an aqueous medium, including but not limited to an aqueous medium of the eye.<br>
[0107] In some variations of the liquid formulations described herein, the therapeutic<br>
agent is a solution or suspension of rapamycin in a liquid medium. Liquid media include<br>
but are not limited to solvents, including but not limited to jhose in the Solubilization of<br>
Therapeutic Agents section.<br>
[0108] The liquid formulations described herein may comprise a solubilizing agent<br>
component. In some variations the solubilizing agent component is a surfactant. Note<br>
that there is some overlap between components that may be solvents and solubilizing<br>
agents, and therefore the same component may in some systems be used as either a<br>
solvent or a solubilizing agent. A liquid formulation that comprises a therapeutic agent<br>
and a component that may be considered either a solvent or a solubilizing agent or<br>
surfactant will be considered a solvent if it is playing the role of a solvent; if the<br>
component is not playing the role of the solvent, the component may be considered a<br>
solubilizing agent or surfactant.<br>
[0109] Liquid formulations may optionally further comprise stabilizers, excipients,<br>
gelling agents, adjuvants, antioxidants, and/or other components as described herein.<br>
[0110] In some variations all components in the liquid formulation, other than the<br>
therapeutic agent, are liquid at room temperature.<br>
[0111] In some variations, the liquid formulation comprises a release modifying agent.<br>
In some variations, the release modifying agent is a film-forming polymer component.<br>
33<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
The film-forming polymer component may comprise one or more film-forming polymers.<br>
Any film-forming polymer may be used in the excipient component. In some variations,<br>
the film-forming polymer component comprises a water insoluble film forming polymer.<br>
In some variations, the release modifying agent component comprises an acrylic polymer,<br>
including but not limited to polymethacrylate, including but not limited to Eudragit RL.<br>
[0112] Described herein are compositions and liquid formulations for delivery of the<br>
therapeutic agents described in the Therapeutic Agents section. Delivery of therapeutic<br>
agents using the compositions and liquid formulations described herein may be used to<br>
treat, prevent, inhibit, delay the onset of, or cause the regression of the diseases and<br>
conditions described in the Diseases and Conditions section. The compositions and<br>
liquid formulations described herein may comprise any of the therapeutic agents described<br>
in the Therapeutic Agents section, including but not limited to rapamycin. The<br>
compositions and liquid formulations described herein may comprise one or more than<br>
one therapeutic agent. Other compositions and liquid formulations in addition to those<br>
explicitly described herein may be used.<br>
[0113] When the therapeutic agent is rapamycin, the compositions and liquid<br>
formulations may be used to maintain an amountof rapamycin in the vitreous effective to<br>
• treat wet AMD. In one nonlimiting example, it is believed that a liquid formulation<br>
delivering rapamycin to maintain a concentration of rapamycin of about 10 pg/ml to about<br>
2 ug/ml in the vitreous over a period of time may be used for the treatment of wet AMD.<br>
When the rapamycin is in a liquid formulation that forms a non-dispersed mass, the stated<br>
concentration of rapamycin represents the amount that is effectively treating the disease or<br>
condition of the eye, and not merely present in the form of the non-dispersed mass. In<br>
another nonlimiting example, it is believed that a delivery system delivering rapamycin to<br>
maintain a concentration of rapamycin of about 0.01 pg/mg to about 10 ng/mg in the<br>
retina choroid tissues over a period of time may be used for treatment of wet AMD. Other<br>
therapeutically effective amounts of therapeutic agent are also possible, and can be readily<br>
determined by one of skill in the art given the teachings herein.<br>
[0114] When the therapeutic agent is rapamycin, the compositions and liquid<br>
formulations described herein may be used to deliver a dose of rapamycin to a subject,<br>
including but not limited to a human subject or to the eye of a subject. In one nonlimiting<br>
example, it is believed that a liquid formulation containing a dose of about 20 ug to about<br>
4 mg may be used for the treatment of wet AMD.<br>
34<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
[0115] In some variations the therapeutic agent in the liquid formulation comprises<br>
between about 0.01 to about 30% of the total weight of the composition; between about<br>
0.05 to about 15%; between about 0.1 to about 10%; between about 1 to about 5%; or<br>
between about 5 to about 15%; between about 8 to about 10%; between about 0.01 to<br>
about 1%; between about 0.05 to about 5%; between about 0.1 to about 0.2%; between<br>
about 0.2 to about 0.3%; between about 0.3 to about 0.4%; between about 0.4 to about<br>
0.5%; between about 0.5 to about 0.6%; between about 0.6 to about 0.7%; between about<br>
0.7 to about 1%; between about 1 to about 5%; between about 5 to about 10%; between<br>
about 15 to about 30%, between about 20 to about 30%; or between about 25 to about<br>
30%.<br>
[0116] Those of skill in the art, based on the teachings herein can determine what<br>
amount or concentration of a given therapeutic agent is equivalent to an amount or<br>
concentration of rapamycin by, for example, administering the therapeutic agent at various<br>
amounts or concentrations to a disease model system, such as an in vivo or in vivo model<br>
system, and comparing the results in the model system relative to the results of various<br>
amounts or concentrations of rapamycin. Those of skill in the art, based on the teachings<br>
herein can also determine what amount or concentration of a given therapeutic agent is"<br>
• equivalent to an amount or concentration of rapamycin by reviewing the scientific<br>
literature for experiments performed comparing rapamycin to other therapeutic agents. It<br>
is understood that even the same therapeutic agent may have a different equivalent level<br>
of rapamycin when, for example, a different disease or disorder is being evaluated, or a<br>
different type of formulation is used. Nonlimiting examples of scientific references with<br>
comparative studies of rapamycin and other therapeutic agents on ocular disease are Ohia<br>
et al., Effects of steroids and immunosuppressive drugs on endotoxin-uveitis in rabbits, J.<br>
Ocul. Pharmacol. 8(4):295-307 (1992); Kulkarni, Steroidal and nonsteroidal drugs in<br>
endotoxin-induced uveitis, J. Ocul. Pharmacol. 10(l):329-34 (1994); Hafizi et al.,<br>
Differential effects of rapamycin, cyclosporine A, and FK506 on human coronary artery<br>
smooth muscle cell proliferation and signaling, Vascul Pharmacol. 41(4-5):167-76<br>
(2004); and US 2005/0187241.<br>
[0117] For example, in a model for wet AMD, if a therapeutic agent is found to be<br>
approximately 10-fold less potent or efficacious than rapamycin in the treatment of wet<br>
AMD, a concentration of 10 ng/ml of the therapeutic agent would be equivalent to a 1<br>
ng/ml concentration of rapamycin. Or if a therapeutic agent is found to be approximately<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
10-fold less potent or efficacious than rapamycin in the treatment of wet AMD, a 10-fold<br>
amount of the therapeutic agent would be administered relative to the amount of<br>
rapamycin.<br>
[0118] The solvent component may comprise, for instance, between about 0.01 to about<br>
99.9 % of the total weight of the composition; between about 0.1 to about 99%; between<br>
about 25 to about 55%; between about 30 to about 50%; or between about 35 to about<br>
45%; between about 0.1 to about 10%; between about 10 to about 20%; between about 20<br>
to about 30%; between about 30 to about 40%; between about 40 to about 45%; between<br>
about 40 to about 45%; between about 45 to about 50%; between about 50 to about 60%;<br>
between about 50 to about 70%; between about 70 to about 80%; between about 80 to<br>
about 90%; or between about 90 to about 100%.<br>
[0119] The solubilizing agent component may comprise, for instance, between about<br>
0.01 to about 30 % of the total weight of the composition; between about 0.1 to about<br>
20%; between about 2.5 to about 15%; between about 10 to about 15%; or between about<br>
5 to about 10%; between about 8 to about 12%; between about 10 to about 20%; between<br>
about 20 to about 30%.<br>
[0120] In some variations, the liquid formulations described herein have a viscosity of<br>
■ between 40% and 120% centipoise. In some variations the liquid formulations described<br>
herein have a viscosity of between 60% and 80% centipoise.<br>
[0121] In some variations the liquid formulations described herein comprise a<br>
therapeutic agent and a solvent component. The solvent component may comprise a<br>
single solvent or a combination of solvents. The therapeutic agent component may<br>
comprise a single therapeutic agent or a combination of therapeutic agents. La some<br>

Liquid formulations which form a non-dispersed mass<br>
[0135] One class of liquid formulations described herein forms a non-dispersed mass<br>
when placed in an aqueous medium. As used herein, a "non-dispersed mass" refers to the<br>
structure formed or shape assumed when the liquid formulation is placed into an<br>
environment, relative to the environment in which it is placed. Generally, a non-dispersed<br>
mass of a liquid formulation is anything other than a homogeneous distribution of the<br>
liquid formulation in the surrounding medium. The non-dispersed mass may, for<br>
instance, be indicated by visually inspecting the administered liquid, formulation and<br>
characterizing its appearance relative to the surrounding medium.<br>
[0136] In some variations, the aqueous medium is water. In some variations, the water<br>
is deionized, distilled, sterile, or tap water, including but not limited to tap water available<br>
at the place of business of MacuSight in Union City, California.<br>
[0137] In some variations, the aqueous medium is an aqueous medium of a subject. In<br>
some variations the aqueous medium is an aqueous medium of the eye of a subject,<br>
including but not limited to the vitreous of an eye of a subject. In some variations the<br>
subject is a human subject. In some variations the subject is a rabbit.<br>
[0138] In some variations the liquid formulation forms a non-dispersed mass when<br>
exposed to a certain temperature or range of temperatures, including but not limited to<br>
39<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
about room temperature, about ambient temperature, about 30°C, about 37°C, or about the<br>
temperature of the aqueous medium of the subject.<br>
[0139] In some variations the liquid formulation forms a non-dispersed mass when<br>
exposed to a certain pH or range of pH, including but not limited to a pH between about 6<br>
and about 8.<br>
[0140] In some variations, the non-dispersed mass comprises a gel or gel-lilce<br>
substance.<br>
[0141] In some variations, the non-dispersed mass comprises a polymer matrix. In<br>
some variations, the non-dispersed mass comprises a polymer matrix in which a<br>
• therapeutic agent is dispersed.<br>
[0142] The liquid formulations described herein may generally be of any geometry or<br>
shape after administration to a subject or the eye of a subject, including but not limited to<br>
a human subject. In some variations, the non-dispersed mass is between about 0.1 and<br>
about 5 mm. In some variations, the non-dispersed mass is between about 1 and about 3<br>
mm. The non-dispersed mass-forming liquid formulations may, for instance, appear as a<br>
compact spherical mass when administered to the vitreous. In some instances, the liquid<br>
formulation may appear as a non-dispersed mass relative to the surrounding medium,<br>
wherein the non-dispersed mass is less clearly defined and the geometry is more<br>
amorphous than spherical.<br>
[0143] The non-dispersed mass-forming liquid formulations described herein may form<br>
a non-dispersed mass immediately upon placement in the medium or the non-dispersed<br>
mass may form some period of time after placement of the liquid formulation. In some<br>
variations the non-dispersed mass forms over the course of about 1, about 2, about 3,<br>
about 4, about 5, about 6, or about 7 days. In some variations the non-dispersed mass<br>
forms over the course of about 1 week, about 2 weeks, or about 3 weeks.<br>
[0144] In some variations, the liquid formulations described herein that form a non-<br>
dispersed mass appear as a milky or whitish colored semi-contiguous or semi-solid non-<br>
dispersed mass relative to the medium in which it is placed.<br>
[0145] One liquid formulation described herein forms a non-dispersed mass which has<br>
the form of a solid depot when the formulation is injected into any or all of water, the<br>
vitreous of a rabbit eye, or between the sclera and the conjunctiva of a rabbit eye. One<br>
liquid formulation described herein forms a non-dispersed mass which has the form of a<br>
semi-solid when the formulation is injected into any or all of water, the vitreous of a<br>
40<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
rabbit eye, or between the sclera and the conjunctiva of a rabbit eye. One liquid<br>
formulation described herein forms a non-dispersed mass which has the form of a<br>
polymeric matrix when the formulation is injected into any or all of water, the vitreous of<br>
a rabbit eye, or between the sclera and the conjunctiva of a rabbit eye. One liquid<br>
formulation described herein forms a non-dispersed mass which has the form of a gel, a<br>
hydrogel, or a gel-like substance when the formulation is injected into any or all of water,<br>
the vitreous of a rabbit eye, or between the sclera and the conjunctiva of a rabbit eye.<br>
[0146] In some variations described herein the liquid formulation forms a non-dispersed<br>
mass relative to a surrounding medium where the surrounding medium is aqueous. An<br>
"aqueous medium" or "aqueous environment" is one that contains at least about 50%<br>
water. Examples of aqueous media include but are not limited to water, the vitreous,<br>
extracellular fluid, conjunctiva, sclera, between the sclera and the conjunctiva, aqueous<br>
humor, gastric fluid, and any tissue or body fluid comprised of at least about 50% of<br>
water. Aqueous media include but are not limited to gel structures, including but not<br>
limited to those of the conjunctiva and sclera.<br>
[0147] In some variations, the liquid formulations described herein form a non-<br>
dispersed mass when a test-volume of-the liquid formulation is-placed in the vitreous of a<br>
rabbit eye. In some variations the test volume administered to a rabbit eye, and the test<br>
volume is equal to the volume of the liquid formulation administered to a subject's,<br>
including but not limited to a human subject's eye.<br>
[0148] In some variations, the test volume administered to a rabbit eye is equal to the<br>
volume administered to the subject's eye multiplied by a scale factor, and the scale factor<br>
is equal to the average volume of a rabbit eye divided by the average volume of a subject<br>
eye. The "average volume" of an eye, as used herein, refers to the average volume of an<br>
eye of a member of similar age of the species under consideration generally, as opposed to<br>
the average volume of any particular individual's eye.<br>
[0149] In some variations, the test volume administered to the rabbit eye is between<br>
about 10 l and about 50 l. In some variations, the test volume administered to the rabbit<br>
eye is between about 1 l and about 30 l. In some variations, the test volume<br>
administered to the rabbit eye is between about 50 l and about 100 l. In some<br>
variations, the test volume administered to the rabbit eye is between about 25 l and about<br>
75 l In some variations, the test volume administered to the rabbit eye is about 30 l.<br>
41<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
[0150] In some variations, the liquid formulation that forms a non-dispersed mass when<br>
placed in the medium may comprises a therapeutic agent or agents with a concentration of<br>
between about 0.01% and about 10% by weight of the total, and a solvent between about<br>
10 % and about 99 % by weight of the total. In some variations the formulation further<br>
comprises a solubilizing agent including but not limited to a surfactant. In some<br>
variations the liquid formulation further comprises a stabilizing agent, excipient, adjuvant,<br>
or antioxidant, etc., between about 0 and about 40% by weight of the total. In some<br>
variations, the therapeutic agent is about 5% by weight of the total, and the solvent<br>
component is about 95% by weight of the total.<br>
[0151] Whether a liquid formulation exhibits a non-dispersed mass relative to a<br>
surrounding medium when present in a subject, including but not limited to a human<br>
subject or the eye of a subject may be determined by, for instance, mixing a therapeutic<br>
agent with a solvent, administering it to the vitreous of an eye of a subject, including but<br>
not limited to a human subject, and comparing the liquid formulation to the surrounding<br>
medium.<br>
[0152] One liquid formulation that may be used for treating, preventing, inhibiting,<br>
delaying the"onset of, or causing the regression of the diseases and conditions of a subject,<br>
including but not limited to a human subject, is a liquid formulation that forms a non-<br>
dispersed mass when placed into the vitreous of a rabbit eye. When used for treating,<br>
preventing, inhibiting, delaying the onset of, or causing the regression of the disease or<br>
condition of the subject, the liquid formulation is administered to the subject. The liquid<br>
formulation may or may not form a non-dispersed mass in the subject. One liquid<br>
formulation described herein forms a non-dispersed mass when administered to a subject<br>
and foims a non-dispersed mass when administered to a rabbit eye.<br>
[0153] Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the low solubility of<br>
rapamycin in the vitreous contributes to the formation of a non-dispersed mass by some<br>
rapamycin-containing liquid formulations described herein. The vitreous is a clear gel<br>
composed almost entirely of water (up to 99%). Without being bound by theory, it is<br>
believed that as rapamycin in an injected formulation contacts the vitreous, the rapamycin<br>
precipitates.<br>
[0154] Without being bound by theory, factors believed to affect the formation ofand<br>
geometry of a non-dispersed mass include the concentration of rapamycin in the<br>
formulation, the viscosity of the formulation, ethanol content of the formulation, and the<br>
42<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
volume of injection. It is believed that maintaining a higher local concentration of<br>
rapamycin after injection of the formulation favors formation of a non-dispersed mass, as<br>
opposed to a lower local concentration of rapamycin after injection of the formulation. As<br>
volume is increased for a given dose, formation of a non-dispersed mass may become less<br>
favorable. Formation of a non-dispersed mass may become more favorable as rapamycin<br>
concentration is increased and/or as viscosity is increased. Ethanol content affects both<br>
the solubility of the rapamycin in the formulation and the viscosity of the formulation.<br>
[0155] In one comparison, 100 l of a solution of 0.4 % rapamycin, 4.0% ethanol, and<br>
95.6% PEG 400 (a 400 g dose) did not form a non-dispersed mass after injection into a<br>
rabbit eye. In contrast, 20 l of a solution of 2.00 % rapamycin, 4.0% ethanol, and 94%<br>
PEG 400 (also a 400 g dose) formed a compact spherical non-dispersed mass after<br>
injection into a rabbit eye.<br>
[0156] Without being bound by theory, in the latter example, it is hypothesized that<br>
formation of the non-dispersed mass occurred as depicted in Figures 1A-1C and described<br>
as follows. Upon injection, due to its viscosity the liquid formulation formed a spherical<br>
globule 100 within the vitreous 110. Ethanol then diffused out of this globule, resulting in<br>
localized precipitation 120 of the rapamycin -within the globule." Eventually, the<br>
polyethylene glycol also diffused out of the globule to leave a solid, compact non-<br>
dispersed mass of rapamycin 130.<br>
[0157] In some variations, the non-dispersed masses described herein consists of at<br>
least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about<br>
60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, or at least about 95% by<br>
volume of therapeutic agent when injected into the vitreous of a rabbit eye.<br>
[0158] In some variations, upon formation a non-dispersed mass comprising rapamycin,<br>
for example, delivers the drug continuously at approximately a constant rate for an<br>
extended period of time. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that delivery of<br>
rapamycin from a non-dispersed mass in the vitreous depends on dissolution of the<br>
rapamycin in the vitreous, which depends in turn on clearance of the drug from the<br>
vitreous to other tissues. Without being bound by theory, this release process is believed<br>
to maintain a steady-state concentration of rapamycin in the vitreous.<br>
[0159] In some variations formation of a non-dispersed mass reduces the oxicity of the<br>
injected liquid formulation compared to an equivalent dose that did not form a non-<br>
43<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
dispersed mass. In variations in which a liquid formulation injected into the vitreous does<br>
not form a non-dispersed mass, the drug (e.g., rapamycin) appears to disperse in the<br>
vitreous body. In some variations this may interfere with vision.<br>
[0160] In some variations, liquid formulations that are suspensions form a non-<br>
dispersed mass upon injection into the vitreous. Formation of a non-dispersed mass from<br>
an injected suspension may become more favorable as the suspension particle size<br>
increases.<br>
[0161] In some variations, it is believed that the liquid formulations will form a visually<br>
observable non-dispersed mass when injected into the eye of a subject, including but not<br>
limited to a human subject.<br>
[0162] In some variations, liquid formulations are believed to form non-dispersed<br>
masses when injected subconjunctivally. In some variations it is believed that when<br>
subconjunctivally administered the liquid formulation forms a depot in the scleral tissue.<br>
That is, it is believed that the therapeutic agent is absorbed into the sclera proximate to the<br>
injection site and forms a local concentration of drug in the sclera.<br>
In situ Gelling Formulations<br>
[0163] Described herein are non-dispersed mass-forming liquid formulations which<br>
form a gel or gel-like substance when placed in an aqueous medium. In some variations,<br>
the non-dispersed mass comprises a gel; in some variations the gel is a hydrogel.<br>
[0164] An "in situ gelling formulation," as used herein, refers to a liquid formulation<br>
which forms a gel-like non-dispersed mass when the liquid formulation is placed in an<br>
aqueous medium, including but not limited to aqueous media that are water, the vitreous<br>
of a rabbit eye, and between the sclera and the conjunctiva of a rabbit eye. In some<br>
variations, an in situ gelling formulation forms a gel-like non-dispersed mass when placed<br>
in tap water.<br>
[0165] In some variations, the in situ gelling formulation is a suspension prior to<br>
placement in an aqueous medium, and forms a gel in situ upon placement in an aqueous<br>
medium. In some variations, the in situ gelling formulation is a solution prior to<br>
placement in an aqueous medium, and forms a gel in situ upon placement in an aqueous<br>
medium. In some variations, the in situ gelling formulation is an emulsion prior to<br>
placement in an aqueous medium, and forms a gel in situ upon placement in an aqueous<br>
medium. In some variations a gel-like non-dispersed mass forms after placement of the in<br>

water, the vitreous, or between the sclera and the conjunctiva of an eye. In some<br>
variations, the in situ gel is formed of a polymer matrix. In some variations a therapeutic<br>
agent is dispersed in the polymer matrix.<br>
[0166] Described herein are in situ gelling formulations which may be used for treating,<br>
preventing, inhibiting, delaying the onset of, or causing the regression of the diseases and<br>
conditions of a subject including but not limited to a human subject. When used for<br>
treating, preventing, inhibiting, delaying the onset of, or causing the regression of the<br>
disease or condition of the subject, the in situ gelling formulation is administered to the<br>

agent. For example, the therapeutically effective amount of a therapeutic agent used for<br>
preventing a disease or condition may be different from the therapeutically effective<br>
amount used for treating, inhibiting, delaying the onset of, or causing the regression of the<br>
disease or condition. In addition, the therapeutically effective amount may depend on the<br>
age, weight, and other health conditions of the subject as is well know to those versed in<br>
the disease or condition being addressed. Thus, the therapeutically effective amount may<br>
not be the same in every subject to which the therapeutic agent is administered.<br>
[0176] An effective amount of a therapeutic agent for treating, preventing, inhibiting,<br>
delaying the onset of, or causing the regression of a specific disease or condition is also<br>
referred to herein as the amount of therapeutic agent effective to treat, prevent, inhibit,<br>
delay the onset of, or cause the regression of the disease or condition.<br>
[0177] To determine whether a level of therapeutic agent is a "therapeutically effective<br>
amount" to treat, prevent, inhibit, delay on set of, or cause the regression of the diseases<br>
and conditions described in the Diseases and Conditions section, liquid formulations may<br>
be administered in animal models for the diseases or conditions of interest, and the effects<br>
may be observed. In addition, dose ranging human clinical trials may be conducted to<br>
determine the therapeutically-effective amount of-a therapeutic agent<br>
[0178] Generally, the therapeutic agent may be formulated in any composition or liquid<br>
formulation capable of delivery of a therapeutically effective amount of the therapeutic<br>
agent to a subject or to the eye of a subject for the required delivery period. Compositions<br>
include liquid formulations.<br>
Solubilization of therapeutic agents<br>
[0179] One composition or liquid formulation that may be used is a composition or<br>
liquid formulation in which the therapeutic agent is dissolved in a solvent component.<br>
Generally, any solvent which has the desired effect may be used in which the therapeutic<br>
agent dissolves. In some variations the solvent is aqueous. In some variations the solvent<br>
is non-aqueous. An "aqueous solvent" is a solvent that contains at least about 50% water.<br>
[0180] Generally, any concentration of solubilized therapeutic agent that has the desired<br>
effect can be used. The solvent component may be a single solvent or may be a mixture<br>
of solvents. The solvent component may be a single solvent or may be a mixture of<br>
solvents. Solvents and types of solutions are well known to those versed in such drug<br>
delivery technologies. See for example, Remington: The Science and Practice of<br>

contents of which is incorporated herein in its entirety.<br>
[0196] As a nonlimiting example, rapamycin can be dissolved in 5% DMSO or<br>
methanol in a balanced salt solution. The rapamycin solution can be unsaturated, a<br>
saturated or a supersaturated solution of rapamycin. The rapamycin solution can be in<br>
contact with solid rapamycin. In one nonlimiting example, rapamycin can be dissolved in<br>
a concentration of up to about 400 rag/ml. Rapamycin can also, for example, be dissolved<br>
in propylene glycol esterified with fatty acids such as oleic, stearic, palmic, capric,<br>
linoleic, etc.<br>
[0197] Many other solvents are possible. Those of ordinary sldll in the art will-find-it<br>
routine to identify solvents for rapamycin given the teachings herein.<br>
Solubilizing Agents<br>
[0198] Generally, any solubilizing agent or combination of solubilizing agents may be<br>
used in the liquid formulations described herein.<br>
[0199] In some variations, the solubilizing agent is a surfactant or combination of<br>
surfactants. Many surfactants are possible. Combinations of surfactants, including<br>
combinations of various types of surfactants, may also be used. For instance, surfactants<br>
which are nonionic, anionic (i.e. soaps, sulfonates), qationic (i.e. CTAB), zwitterionic,<br>
polymeric or amphoteric may be used.<br>
[0200] Surfactants that can be used may be determined by mixing a therapeutic agent of<br>
interest with a putative solvent and a putative surfactant, and observing the characteristics<br>
of the formulation after exposure to a medium.<br>
[0201] Examples of surfactants include but are not limited to fatty acid esters or amides<br>
or ether analogues, or hydrophilic derivatives thereof; monoesters or diesters, or<br>
hydropbilic derivatives thereof; or mixtures thereof; monoglycerides or diglycerides, or<br>

hydrophilic derivatives thereof; or mixtures thereof; mixtures having enriched mono-<br>
or/and diglycerides, or hydrophilic derivatives thereof; surfactants with a partially<br>
derivatized with a hydrophilic moiety; monoesters or diesters or multiple-esters of other<br>
alcohols, polyols, saccharides or oligosaccharides or polysaccharides, oxyalkylene<br>

analogues thereof; fatty acid derivatives of amines, polyamines, polyimines,<br>
aminoalcohols, aminosugars, hydroxyalkylamines, hydroxypolyimines, peptides,<br>
polypeptides, or the ether analogues thereof.<br>
[0202] Hydrophilic Lipophilic Balance ("HLB") is an expression of the relative<br>
simultaneous attraction of a surfactant for water and oil (or for the two phases of the '<br>
emulsion system being considered).<br>
[0203] Surfactants are characterized according to the balance between the hydrophilic<br>
and lipophilic portions of their molecules. The hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB)<br>
number indicates the polarity of the molecule in an arbitrary range of 1 - 40, with the most<br>
commonly used emulsifiers having a value between 1 - 20. The HLB increases with<br>
increasing hydrophilicity.<br>
[0204] Surfactants that may be used include but are not limited to those with an HLB<br>
- greater than 10, 11, 12, 13 or 14. Examples of surfactants include polyoxyethylene<br>
products of hydrogenated vegetable oils, polyethoxylated castor oils or polyethoxylated<br>
hydrogenated castor oil, polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene<br>

polyoxyethylene stearyl ethers, may also be used. Labrafil M 1944 CS is one example of<br>
a surfactant wherein the composition contains a mixture of glyceryl glycol esters and<br>

Solubilizing agents for rapamycin<br>
[0209] Many solubilizing agents may be used for rapamycin, including but not limited<br>
****to those in the solubilizing agents section above.<br>

Viscosity Modifying Agents<br>
[0211] The liquid formulations described herein may be administered with or further<br>
comprise a viscosity modifying agent.<br>
54<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
[0212] One exemplary viscosity modifying agent that may be used is hyaluronic acid.<br>
Hyaluronic acid is a glycosaminoglycan. It is made of a repetitive sequence of glucuronic<br>
acid and glucosamine. Hyaluronic acid is present in many tissues and organs of the body,<br>
and contributes to the viscosity and consistency of such tissues and organs. Hyaluronic<br>
acid is present in the eye, including the vitreous of the eye, and along with collagen<br>
contributes to the viscosity thereof. The liquid formulations described herein may further<br>
comprise or be administered with hyaluronic acid.<br>
[0213] Other nonlimiting examples of viscosity modifying agents include polyalkylene<br>
oxides, glycerol, carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium alginate, chitosan, dextran, dextran<br>
sulfate and collagen. These viscosity modifying agents can be chemically modified.<br>
[0214] Other viscosity modifying agents that may be used include but are not limited to<br>
carrageenan, cellulose gel, colloidal silicon dioxide, gelatin, propylene carbonate,<br>
carbonic acid, alginic acid, agar, carboxyvinyl polymers or carbomers and<br>

Other components of liquid formulations<br>
[0215] The formulations described herein may further comprise various other<br>
components such as stabilizers, for example. Stabilizers that may be used in the<br>
formulations described herein include but are not limited to agents that will (1) improve<br>
the compatibility of excipients with the encapsulating materials such as gelatin, (2)<br>
improve the stability (e.g. prevent crystal growth of a therapeutic agent such as<br>
rapamycin) of a therapeutic agent such as rapamycin and/or rapamycin derivatives, and/or<br>
(3) improve formulation stability. Note that there is overlap between components that are<br>
stabilizers and those that are solvents, solubilizing agents or surfactants, and the same<br>
component can carry out more than one role.<br>
55<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
[0216] Stabilizers may be selected from fatty acids, fatty alcohols, alcohols, long chain<br>
fatty acid esters, long chain ethers, hydrophilic derivatives of fatty acids,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidones, polyvinylethers, polyvinyl alcohols, hydrocarbons, hydrophobic<br>
polymers, moisture-absorbing polymers, and combinations thereof. Amide analogues of<br>
the above stabilizers can also be used. The chosen stabilizer may change the<br>
hydrophobicity of the formulation (e.g. oleic acid, waxes), or improve the mixing of<br>
various components in the formulation (e.g. ethanol), control the moisture level in the<br>
formula (e.g. PVP), control the mobility of the phase (substances with melting points<br>
higher than room temperature such as long chain fatty acids, alcohols, esters, ethers,<br>
amides etc. or mixtures thereof; waxes), and/or improve the compatibility of the formula<br>
with encapsulating materials (e.g. oleic acid or wax). Some of these stabilizers may be<br>
used as solvents/co-solvents (e.g. ethanol). Stabilizers maybe present in sufficient amount<br>
to inhibit the therapeutic agent's (such as rapamycin's) crystallization.<br>
[0217] Examples of stabilizers include, but are not limited to, saturated, monoenoic,<br>
polyenoic, branched, ring-containing, acetylenic, dicarboxylic and functional-group-<br>
containing fatty acids such as oleic acid, caprylic acid, capric acid, caproic acid, lauric<br>
acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, behenic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid,<br>
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), DHA; fatty alcohols such as stearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol,<br>
ceteryl alcohol; other alcohols such as ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, butanol; long chain fatty<br>

hydroabietic acid etc.<br>
[0218] The formulations described may further contain a gelling agent that alters the<br>
texture of the final formulation through formation of a gel.<br>
[0219] The therapeutic agents for use as described herein, such as rapamycin, may be<br>
subjected to conventional pharmaceutical operations, such as sterilization and<br>
compositions containing the therapeutic agent may also contain conventional adjuvants,<br>
such as preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, buffers etc. The therapeutic<br>
agents may also be formulated with pharmaceutically acceptable excipientsjfor clinical<br>
use to produce a pharmaceutical compositioa Formulations for ocular administration<br>
may be presented as a solution, suspension, particles of solid material, a discrete mass of<br>
56<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
solid material, incorporated within a polymer matrix, liquid formulations or in any other<br>
form for ocular administration. The therapeutic agents may be used to prepare a<br>
medicament to treat, prevent, inhibit, delay onset, or cause regression of any of the<br>
conditions described herein. In some variations, the therapeutic agents may be used to<br>
prepare a medicament to treat any of the conditions described herein.<br>
[0220] A composition containing a therapeutic agent such as rapamycin may contain<br>
one or more adjuvants appropriate for the indicated route of administration. Adjuvants<br>
with which the therapeutic agent may be admixed with include but are not limited to<br>
lactose, sucrose, starch powder, cellulose esters of alkanoic acids, stearic acid, talc,<br>
magnesium stearate, magnesium oxide, sodium and calcium salts of phosphoric and<br>
sulphuric acids, acacia, gelatin, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidine, and/or polyvinyl<br>
alcohol. When a solubilized formulation is required the therapeutic agent may be in a<br>
solvent including but not limited to polyethylene glycol of various molecular weights,<br>
propylene glycol, carboxymethyl cellulose colloidal solutions, methanol, ethanol, DMSO,<br>
corn oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, tragacanth gum, and/or various buffers.<br>
Other adjuvants and modes of administration are well known in the pharmaceutical art<br>
and may be used in the practice of the methods, compositions and liquid formulations<br>
described herein. The carrier or diluent may include time delay material, such as glyceryl<br>
monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax, or other materials well known in<br>
the art. The formulations for use as described herein may also include gel formulations,<br>
erodible and non-erodible polymers, microspheres, and liposomes.<br>
[0221] Other adjuvants and excipients that may be used include but are not limited to<br>
C8-C10 fatty acid esters such as softigen 767, polysorbate 80, PLURONICS, Terronics,<br>
Miglyol, and Transcutol.<br>
[0222] Additives and diluents normally utilized in the pharmaceutical arts can<br>
optionally be added to the pharmaceutical composition and the liquid formulation. These<br>
include thickening, granulating, dispersing, flavoring, sweetening, coloring, and<br>
stabilizing agents, including pH stabilizers, other excipients, anti-oxidants (e.g.,<br>
tocopherol, BHA, BHT, TBHQ, tocopherol acetate, ascorbyl palmitate, ascorbic acid<br>
propyl gallate, and the like), preservatives (e.g., parabens), and the like. Exemplary<br>
preservatives include, but are not limited to, benzylalcohol, ethylalcohol, benzalkonium<br>
chloride, phenol, chlorobutanol, and the like. Some useful antioxidants provide oxygen or<br>
peroxide inhibiting agents for the formulation and include, but are not limited to,<br>

butylated hydroxytoluene, butylhydroxyanisole, propyl gallate, ascorbic acid palmitate, -<br>
tocopherol, and the like. Thickening agents, such as lecithin, hydroxypropylcellulose,<br>
aluminum stearate, and the like, may improve the texture of the formulation.<br>
[0223] In some variations, the therapeutic agent is rapamycin, and the rapamycin is<br>
formulated as rapamune in solid or liquid form. In some variations, the rapamune is<br>
formulated as an oral dosage.<br>
[0224] In addition, a viscous polymer may be added to the suspension, assisting the<br>
localization and ease of placement and handling. In some uses of the liquid formulation, a<br>
pocket in the sclera may be surgically formed to receive an injection of the liquid<br>
formulations. The hydrogel structure of the sclera can act as a rate-controlling membrane.<br>
Particles of therapeutic agent substance for forming a suspension can be produced by<br>
known methods including but not limited to via ball milling, for example by using<br>
ceramic beads. For example, a Cole Partner ball mill such as Labmill 8000 may be used<br>
with 0.8 mm YTZ ceramic beads available from Tosoh or Norstone Inc.<br>
[0225] The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may<br>
be prepared by conventional pharmaceutical techniques. Such techniques include the step<br>
of bringing into association the therapeutic agent and the pharmaceutical carrier(s) or<br>
excipient(s). The formulations may be prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into<br>
associate the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both,<br>
and then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>
[0226] In some variations, the formulations described herein are provided in one or<br>
more unit dose forms, wherein the unit dose form contains an amount of a liquid<br>
formulation described herein that is effective to treat or prevent the disease or condition<br>

are provided in one or more unit dose forms, wherein the unit dose form contains an<br>
amount of a liquid rapamycin formulation described herein that is effective to treat or<br>
prevent the disease or condition for which it is being administered.<br>
[0227] In some embodiments, the unit dose form is prepared in the concentration at<br>
which it will be administered. In some variations, the unit dose form is diluted prior to<br>
administration to a subject. In some variations, a liquid formulation described herein is<br>
diluted in an aqueous medium prior to administration to a subject. In some variations the<br>
aqueous medium is an isotonic medium. In some variations, a liquid formulation<br>
described herein is diluted in an non-aqueous medium prior to administration to a subject.<br>

WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
[0228] In a further aspect, provided herein are kits comprising one or more unit dose<br>
forms as described herein. In some embodiments, the kit comprises one or more of<br>
packaging and instructions for use to treat one or more diseases or conditions. In some<br>
embodiments, the kit comprises a diluent which is not in physical contact with the<br>
formulation or pharmaceutical formulation. In some embodiments, the kit comprises any<br>
of one or more unit dose forms described herein in one or more sealed vessels. In some<br>
embodiments, the kit comprises any of one or more sterile unit dose forms.<br>
[0229] In some variations, the unit dose form is in a container, including but not limited<br>
to a sterile sealed container. In some variations the container is a vial, ampule, or low<br>
volume applicator, including but not limited to a syringe. In some variations, a low-<br>
volume applicator is pre-filled with rapamycin for treatment of an ophthalmic disease or<br>
condition, including but not limited to a limus compound for treatment of age-related<br>
macular degeneration. Described herein is a pre-filled low-volume applicator pre-filled<br>
with a formulation comprising a therapeutic agent, including but not limited to rapamycin.<br>
In some variations a low-volume applicator is pre-filled with a solution comprising a<br>
therapeutic agent, including but not limited to rapamycin and a polyethylene glycol, and<br>
optionally furthercomprises one or more additional components including-but not-limited<br>
to ethanol. In some variations a pre-filled low-volume applicator is pre-filled with a<br>

Routes of Administration<br>
59<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
[0231] The compositions, methods, and liquid formulations described herein deliver<br>
one or more therapeutic agents to a subject, including but not limited to a human subject.<br>
[0232] In some variations, the compositions, methods, and liquid formulations<br>
described herein deliver one or more therapeutic agents to an aqueous medium of a human<br>
subject.<br>
(0233] In some variations, the compositions, methods, and liquid formulations<br>
described herein deliver one or more therapeutic agents to an aqueous medium in or<br>
proximal to an area where a disease or condition is to be treated, prevented, inhibited,<br>
onset delayed, or regression caused.<br>
[0234] In some variations, the compositions, methods, and liquid formulations<br>
described herein deliver one or more therapeutic agents to an eye of a subject, including<br>
the macula and the retina choroid tissues, in an amount and for a duration effective to<br>
treat, prevent, inhibit, delay the onset of, or cause the regression of the diseases and<br>
conditions described in the Diseases and Conditions section.<br>
[0235] "Retina choroid" and "retina choroid tissues," as used herein, are synonymous<br>
and refer to the combined retina and choroid tissues of the eye.<br>
[0236] As a non-limiting example, the compositions, liquid formulations, and methods.<br>
described in herein may be administered to the vitreous, aqueous humor, sclera,<br>
conjunctiva, between the sclera and conjunctiva, the retina choroid tissues, macula, or<br>
other area in or proximate to the eye of a subject, either by direct administration to these<br>
tissues or by periocular routes, in amounts and for a duration effective to treat, prevent,<br>
inhibit, delay the onset of, or cause the regression of CNV and wet AMD. The effective<br>
amounts and durations may be different for each of treating, preventing, inhibiting,<br>
delaying the onset of, or causing the regression of CNV and wet AMD, and for each of the<br>
different sites of delivery.<br>
[0237] Intravitreal administration is more invasive than some other types of ocular<br>
procedures. Because of the potential risks of adverse effects, intravitreal administration<br>
may not be optimal for treatment of relatively healthy eyes. By contrast, periocular<br>
administration, such as subconjunctival administration, is much less invasive than<br>
intravitreal administration. When a therapeutic agent is delivered by a periocular route, it<br>
may be possible to treat patients with healthier eyes than could be treated using<br>
intravitreal administration. In some variations, subconjunctival injection is used to prevent<br>
60<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
or delay onset of a disease or condition of the eye, where the eye of the subject has visual<br>
acuity of 20/40 or better.<br>
[0238] "Subconjunctival" placement or injection, as used herein, refers to placement or<br>
injection between the sclera and conjunctiva. Subconjunctival is sometimes referred to<br>
herein as "sub-conj" administration.<br>
[0239] Routes of administration that may be used to administer a liquid formulation<br>
include but are not limited to placement of the liquid formulation, for example by<br>
injection, into an aqueous medium in the subject, including but not limited to placement,<br>
including but not limited to by injection, into the eye of a subject, including but not<br>
limited to a human subject. The liquid formulation may be administered systemically,<br>
including but not limited to the following delivery routes: rectal, vaginal, infusion,<br>
intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intraarterial, intrathecal, intrabronchial, intracisternal,<br>
cutaneous, subcutaneous, intradermal, transdermal, intravenous, intracervical,<br>
intraabdominal, intracranial, intraocular, intrapulmonary, intrathoracic, intratracheal,<br>
nasal, buccal, sublingual, oral, parenteral, or nebulised or aerosolized using aerosol<br>
propellants.<br>
[0240] Compositions and: liquid formulations comprising therapeutic agent can be<br>
administered directly to the eye using a variety of procedures, including but not limited to<br>
procedures in which (1) the therapeutic agent is administered by injection using a syringe<br>
and hypodermic needle, (2) a specially designed device is used to inject the therapeutic<br>
agent, (3) prior to injection of the therapeutic agent, a pocket is surgically formed within<br>
the sclera to serve as a receptacle for the therapeutic agent or therapeutic agent<br>
composition. For example, in one administration procedure a surgeon forms a pocket<br>
within the sclera of the eye followed by injection of a solution or liquid formulation<br>
comprising the therapeutic agent into the pocket.<br>
[0241] Other administration procedures include, but are not limited to procedures in<br>
which (1) a formulation of the therapeutic agent is injected through a specially designed<br>
curved cannula to place the therapeutic agent directly against a portion of the eye, (2) a<br>
compressed form of the therapeutic agent is placed directly against a portion of the eye,<br>
(3) the therapeutic agent is inserted into the sclera by a specially designed injector or<br>
inserter, (4) the liquid formulation comprising the therapeutic agent is incorporated^<br>
within a polymer, (5) a surgeon makes a small conjunctival incision through which to pass<br>
a suture and any therapeutic agent delivery structure so as to secure the structure adjacent<br>
61<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
to the sclera, (6) a needle is used for injection directly into the vitreous of an eye, or into<br>
any other site described.<br>
[0242] The liquid formulations described herein may be used directly, for example, by<br>
injection, as an elixir, for topical administration including but not limited to via eye drops,<br>
or in hard or soft gelatin or starch capsules. The capsules may be banded to prevent<br>
leakage.<br>
Delivery by injection<br>
[0243] One method that may be used to deliver the compositions and liquid<br>
formulations described herein is delivery by injection. In this method compositions and<br>
liquid formulations maybe injected into a subject, including but not limited to a human<br>
subject, or into a position in or proximate to an eye of the subject for delivery to a subject<br>
or to the eye of a subject. Injection includes but is not limited to intraocular and<br>
periocular injection. Nonlimiting examples of positions that are in or proximate to an eye<br>
of a subject are as follows.<br>
[0244] Injection of therapeutic agent into the vitreous may provide a high local<br>
concentration of therapeutic agent" in'the vitreous and retina. Further, it hasbeen found"<br>
• that in the vitreous the clearance half-lives of drugs increases with molecular weight.<br>
[0245] Intracameral injection, or injection into the anterior chamber of they eye, may<br>
also be used. In one example, up to about 100 ul may be injected intracamerally.<br>
[0246] Periocular routes of delivery may deliver therapeutic agent to the retina without<br>
some of the risks of intravitreal delivery. Periocular routes include but are not limited to<br>
subconjunctival, subtenon, retrobulbar, peribulbar and posterior juxtascleral delivery. A<br>
"periocular" route of administration means placement near or around the eye. For a<br>
description of exemplary periocular routes for retinal drug delivery, see Periocular routes<br>
for retinal drug delivery, Raghava et al. (2004), Expert Opin. Drug Deliv. 1(1):99-114,<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[0247] In some variations the liquid formulations described herein are administered<br>
intraocularly. Intraocular administration includes placement or injection within the eye,<br>
including in the vitreous.<br>
[0248] Subconjunctival injection may be by injection of therapeutic agent underneath<br>
the conjunctiva, or between the sclera and conjunctiva. In one example, up to about 500<br>
l may be injected subconjunctivally. As one nonlimiting example, a needle of up to<br>
62<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
[0256] When the therapeutic agent is rapamycin, the compositions and liquid<br>
formulations may be used to deliver or maintain an amount of rapamycin in tissues of the<br>
eye, including without limitation retina, choroid, or the vitreous, which amount is<br>
effective to treat AMD. In one nonlimiting example, it is believed that a liquid<br>
formulation delivering rapamycin in an amount capable of providing a concentration of<br>
rapamycin of about 0.1 pg/ml to about 2 g/ml in the vitreous maybe used for treatment<br>
of wet AMD. In some nonlimiting examples, it is believed that a liquid formulation<br>
delivering a concentration of rapamycin of about 0.1 pg/mg to about 1 g/mg in the retina<br>
choroid tissues may be used for treatment of wet AMD. Other effective concentrations<br>
are readily ascertainable by those of skill in the art based on the teachings described<br>
herein.<br>
Method of preparing liquid formulations<br>
[0257] One nonlimiting method that may be used for preparing the liquid formulations<br>
described herein, including but not limited to liquid formulations comprising rapamycin,<br>
is by mixing a solvent and a therapeutic agent together at room temperature or at slightly<br>
elevated temperature until a solution or suspension is obtained, with optionaluse ofa<br>
sonicator, and then cooling the formulation. Other components including but not limited<br>
to those described above may then be mixed with the formulation. Other preparation<br>
methods that may be used are described herein including in the examples, and those of<br>
skill in the art will be able to select other preparation methods based on the teachings<br>
herein.<br>
Extended delivery of therapeutic agents<br>
[0258] Described herein are compositions and liquid formulations showing in vivo<br>
delivery or clearance profiles with one or more of the following characteristics. The<br>
delivery or clearance profiles are for clearance of the therapeutic agent in vivo after<br>
injection of the composition or liquid formulations subconjunctivally or into the vitreous<br>
of a rabbit eye. In some variations, the delivery or clearance profiles are for clearance of<br>
rapamycin in vivo after injection of the composition or liquid formulations<br>
subconjunctivally or into the vitreous of a rabbit eye. The volume of the rabbit vitreous is	<br>
approximately 30-40% of the volume of the human vitreous. The amount of therapeutic<br>
64<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
agent is measured using techniques as described in Example 2, but without limitation to<br>
the formulation and therapeutic agent described in Example 2.<br>
[0259] In some variations, the therapeutic agents with the in vivo delivery or clearance<br>
profiles described herein include but are not limited to those described in the Therapeutic<br>
Agents section. In some variations the therapeutic agent is rapamycin. In some variations,<br>
the liquid formulations described herein are used to deliver therapeutic agents in a<br>
concentration equivalent to rapamycin. The liquid formulations described herein may<br>
comprise any therapeutic agent including but not limited to those in the Therapeutic<br>
Agents section, in a concentration equivalent to rapamycin including but not limited to<br>
those concentrations described herein including in the examples.<br>
[0260] "Average percentage in vivo" level means that an average concentration of<br>
therapeutic agent is obtained across multiple rabbit eyes for a given timepoint, and the<br>
average concentration of therapeutic agent at one timepoint is divided by the average<br>
concentration of therapeutic agent at another timepoint. In some variations of the average<br>
percentage in vivo levels, the therapeutic agent is rapamycin.<br>
[0261] The average concentration of a therapeutic agent in the tissue of a rabbit eye at a<br>
given time after administration of a formulation containing the therapeutic agent may be<br>
measured according to the following method. Where volumes below 10 pi are to be<br>
injected, a Hamilton syringe is used.<br>
[0262] The liquid formulations are stored at a temperature of 2-8 °C prior to use.<br>
[0263] The experimental animals are specific pathogen free (SPF) New Zealand White<br>
rabbits. A mixed population of about 50% male, about 50% female is used. The rabbits<br>
are at least 12 weeks of age, usually at least 14 weeks of age, at the time of dosing. The<br>
rabbits each weigh at least 2.2 kg, usually at least 2.5 kg, at the time of dosing. Prior to<br>
the study, the animals are quarantined for at least one week and examined for general<br>
health parameters. Any unhealthy animals are not used in the study. At least 6 eyes are<br>
measured and averaged for a given timepoint.<br>
[0264] Housing and sanitation are performed according to standard procedures used in<br>
the industry. The animals are provided approximately 150 grams of Teklad Certified Hi-<br>
Fiber Rabbit Diet daily, and are provided tap water ad libitum. No contaminants are<br>
known to exist in the water.and no additional analysis outside that provided by the local<br>
water district is performed. Environmental Conditions are monitored.<br>
65<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
[0265] Each animal undergoes a pre-treatment ophthalmic examination (slit lamp and<br>
ophthalmoscopy), performed by a board certified veterinary ophthalmologist. Ocular<br>
findings are scored according to the McDonald and Shadduck scoring system as described<br>
in Dermatoxicology, F. N. Marzulli and H.I. Maibach, 1977 "Eye Irritation," T.O.<br>
McDonald and J.A. Shadduck (pages 579-582). Observations are recorded using a<br>
standardized data collection sheet. Acceptance criteria for placement on study are as<br>
follows: scores of 
observation variables.<br>
[0266] Gentamicin ophthalmic drops are placed into both eyes of each animal twice<br>
daily on the day prior to dosing, on the day of dosing (Day 1), and on the day after dosing<br>
(Day 2). Dosing is performed in two phases, the first including one set of animals and the<br>
second including the other animals. Animals are randomized separately into masked<br>
treatment groups prior to each phase of dosing according to modified Latin squares.<br>
Animals are fasted at least 8 hours prior to injection. The start time of the fast and time of<br>
injection are recorded.<br>
[0267] Animals are weighed and anesthetized with an intravenous injection of a<br>
ketamine/xylazine cocktail (87 mg/mL ketamine, 13 mg/mL xylazine) at a volume of 0.1-<br>
0.2 mL/kg. Both eyes of each animal are prepared for injection as follows: approximately<br>
five minutes prior to injection, eyes are moistened with an ophthalmic Betadine solution.<br>
After five minutes, the Betadine is washed out of the eyes with sterile saline.<br>
Proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5% (1-2 drops) is delivered to each eye. For eyes to be<br>
intravitreally injected, 1% Tropicamide (1 drop) is delivered to each eye.<br>
[0268] On Day 1, both eyes of each animal receive an injection of test or control article.<br>
Animals in selected groups are dosed a second time on Day 90 ± 1. Dosing is<br>
subconjunctival or intravitreal. Actual treatments, injection locations, and dose volumes<br>
are masked and revealed at the end of the study.<br>
[0269] Subconjunctival injections are given using an insulin syringe and 30 gauge x<br>
1/2-inch needle. The bulbar conjunctiva in the dorsotemporal quadrant is elevated using<br>
forceps. Test article is injected into the subconjunctival space.<br>
[0270] Intravitreal injections are given using an Insulin syringe and 30 gauge x 1/2-inch<br>
needle. For-each injection, the.needle is introduced through the ventral nasal quadrant of<br>
the eye, approximately 2-3 mm posterior to the limbus, with the bevel of the needle<br>
66<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
directed downward and posteriorly to avoid the lens. Test article is injected in a single<br>
bolus in the vitreous near the retina.<br>
[0271 ] Animals are observed for mortality/morbidity twice daily. An animal<br>
determined to be moribund is euthanized with an intravenous injection of commercial<br>
euthanasia solution. Both eyes are removed and stored frozen at -70°C for possible future<br>
evaluation. If an animal is found dead prior to onset of rigor mortis, both eyes are<br>
removed and stored frozen at -70°C for possible future evaluation. Animals found after<br>
the onset of rigor mortis are not necropsied.<br>
[0272] Animals are weighed at randomization, on Day 1 prior to dosing, and prior to<br>
euthanasia.<br>
[0273] Ophthalmic observations (slit lamp and indirect ophthalmoscopy) are performed<br>
on all animals on Days 5±1,30±1,60±1,90±1, and at later dates in some variations.<br>
Observations are performed by a board certified veterinary ophthalmologist. For animals<br>
to be dosed on Day 90 ± 1, ophthalmic observations are performed prior to dosing.<br>
Ocular findings are scored according to the McDonald and Shadduck scoring system as<br>
described in Dermatoxicology, F.N. Marzulli and H.I. Maibach, 1977 "Eye Irritation",<br>
T.O. McDonald and J.A. Shadduck (pages 579-582), and observations are recorded using<br>
a standardized data collection sheet.<br>
[0274] Whole blood samples (1-3 mL per sample) are collected from each animal prior<br>
to necropsy in vacutainer tubes containing EDTA. Each tube is filled at least 2/3 full and<br>
thoroughly mixed for at least 30 seconds. Tubes are stored frozen until shipped on dry<br>
ice.<br>
[0275] Animals are euthanized with an intravenous injection of commercial euthanasia<br>
solution. Euthanasia is performed according to standard procedures used in the industry.<br>
[0276] For treatment groups dosed intravitreally or subconjunctivally with placebo, all<br>
eyes from each of these groups are placed into Davidsons solution for approximately 24<br>
hours. Following the 24-hour period, the eyes are transferred to 70% ethanol; these<br>
globes are submitted for masked histopathological evaluation by a board certified<br>
veterinary pathologist. The time that eyes are placed into Davidsons and the time of<br>
removal are recorded.<br>
[0277] For treatment groups dosed intravitreally or subconjunctivally with test article,<br>
some eyes from each of these groups are frozen at -70°C and submitted for<br>
pharmacokinetic analysis. The remaining eyes from each of these groups are placed into<br>
67<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
Davidsons solution for approximately 24 hours. Following the 24-hour period, the eyes<br>
are transferred to 70% ethanol; these globes are submitted for masked histopathological<br>
evaluation by a board certified veterinary pathologist. The time that eyes are placed into<br>
Davidsons and the time of removal are recorded.<br>
[0278] Frozen samples submitted for pharmacokinetic analysis are dissected with<br>
disposable instruments. One set of instalments is used per eye, and then discarded. The<br>
samples are thawed at room temperature for 1 to 2 minutes to ensure that the frost around<br>
the tissue has been removed. The sclera is dissected into 4 quadrants, and the vitreous is<br>
removed. If a non-dispersed mass (NDM) is clearly visible within the vitreous, the<br>
vitreous is separated into two sections. The section with the NDM is approximately two-<br>
thirds of the vitreous. The section without the NDM is the portion of the vitreous that is<br>
the most distant from the NDM. The aqueous humor, lens, iris, and cornea are separated.<br>
The retina choroid tissue is removed using a forceps and collected for analysis. The<br>
conjunctiva is separated from the sclera.<br>
[0279] The various tissue types are collected into separate individual pre-weighed vials<br>
which are then capped and weighed. The vials of tissue are stored at -80°C until<br>
analyzed.<br>
[0280] The sirolimus content of the retina choroid, sclera, vitreous humor, and whole<br>
anti-coagulated blood is determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography/tandem mass<br>
spectroscopy (HPLC/MS/MS) using 32-O-desmethoxyrapamycin as an internal standard.<br>
Where an NDM was observed in the vitreous, the section of the vitreous containing the<br>
NDM and the section of the vitreous not containing the NDM are analyzed separately.<br>
[0281] The average concentration of a therapeutic agent over a period of time means for<br>

[0373] In some variations, the ratio of the base ten logarithms of the average levels of a<br>

degree when considered on the logarithmic scale, and vice versa.<br>
[0374] In some variations, the ratio of the base ten logarithms of the average levels of a<br>
therapeutic agent in the vitreous versus the retina choroid tissues is approximately<br>

[0381] For treatment, prevention, inhibition, delaying the onset of, or causing the<br>
regression of certain diseases or conditions, it may be desirable to maintain delivery of a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of the therapeutic agent for an extended period of time.<br>
Depending on the disease or condition being treated, prevented, inhibited, having onset<br>
delayed, or being caused to regress this extended period of time may be at least about 1<br>
week, at least about 2 weeks, at least about 3 weeks, at least about 1 month, at least about<br>
3 months, at least about 6 months, at least about 9 months, or at least about 1 year.<br>
Generally, however, any extended period of delivery may be possible. A therapeutically<br>
effective amount of agent may be delivered for an extended period by a liquid formulation<br>
or composition that maintains for the extended period a concentration of agent in a subject<br>
94<br><br>
PCT/US2006/004962<br>
WO 2006/086750<br>
or an eye of a subject sufficient to deliver a therapeutically effective amount of agent for<br>
the extended time.<br>
[0382] Delivery of a therapeutically effective amount of the therapeutic agent for an<br>
extended period may be achieved via placement of one composition or liquid formulation<br>
or may be achieved by application of two or more doses of composition or liquid<br>
formulations. As a non-limiting example of such multiple applications, maintenance of<br>
the therapeutic amount of rapamycin for 3 months for treatment, prevention, inhibition,<br>
delay of onset, or cause of regression of wet AMD may be achieved by application of one<br>
liquid formulation or composition delivering a therapeutic amount for 3 months or by<br>
sequential application of a plurality of liquid formulations or compositions. The optimal<br>
dosage regime will depend on the therapeutic amount of the therapeutic agent needing to<br>
be delivered, and the period over which it need be delivered. Those versed in such<br>
extended therapeutic agent delivery dosing will understand how to identify dosing regimes<br>
that may be used based on the teachings provided herein.<br>
[0383] When using certain therapeutic agents or for the treatment, prevention,<br>
inhibition, delaying the onset of, or causing the regression of certain diseases, it may be<br>
desirable for deliyery of thetherapeutic agent not to commence immediately upon<br>
placement of the liquid formulation or composition into the eye region, but for delivery to<br>
commence after some delay. For example, but in no way limiting, such delayed release<br>
may be useful where the therapeutic agent inhibits or delays wound healing and delayed<br>
release is desirable to allow healing of any wounds occurring upon placement of the liquid<br>
formulation or composition. Depending on the therapeutic agent being delivered and/or<br>
the diseases and conditions being treated, prevented, inhibited, onset delayed, and<br>
regression caused this period of delay before delivery of the therapeutic agent commences<br>
may be about 1 hour, about 6 hours, about 12 hours, about 18 hours, about 1 day, about 2<br>
days, about 3 days, about 4 days, about 5 days, about 6 days, about 7 days, about 8 days,<br>
about 9 days, about 10 days, about 11 days, about 12 days, about 13 days, about 14 days,<br>
about 21 days, about 28 days, about 35 days, or about 42 days. Other delay periods may<br>
be possible. Delayed release formulations that may be used are known to people versed in<br>
the technology.<br>
Intravitreal and subconjunctival delivery of rapamycin for treatment, prevention,<br>
inhibition, delay of onset, or cause of regression of AMD<br>

WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
[0384] In one method described herein, a liquid formulation comprising rapamycin is<br>
delivered subconjunctivally or to the vitreous of an eye to prevent, treat, inhibit, delay<br>
onset of, or cause regression of angiogenesis in the eye, including but not limited to<br>
treating CNV as observed, for example, in AMD. In some variations, the liquid<br>
formulation is used to treat angiogenesis in the eye, including but not limited to treating<br>
CNV as observed, for example, in AMD. Rapamycin has been shown to inhibit CNV in<br>
rat and mice models, as described in U.S. Application No. 10/665,203, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Rapamycin has been observed to inhibit<br>
Matrigel™ and laser-induced CNV when administered systemically and subretinally.<br>
Also, periocular injection of rapamycin inhibits laser-induced CNV.<br>
. [0385] Other therapeutic agents that may be delivered to the eye, particularly the<br>
vitreous of an eye, for treatment, prevention, inhibition, delaying onset, or causing<br>
regression of angiogenesis in the eye (such as CNV) are members of the limus family of<br>
compounds other than rapamycin including but not limited to everolimus and tacrolimus<br>
(FK-506).<br>
[0386] As described herein, the dosage of the therapeutic agent will depend on the<br>
condition being addressed, whether the condition is to be treated, prevented, inhibited,<br>
have onset delayed, or be caused to regress, the particular therapeutic agent, and other<br>
clinical factors such as weight and condition of the subject and the route of administration<br>
of the therapeutic agent. It is to be understood that the methods, liquid formulations, and<br>
compositions described herein have application for both human and veterinary use, as<br>
well as uses in other possible animals. As described herein, tissue concentrations of<br>
therapeutic agents expressed in units of mass per volume generally refer to tissues that are<br>
primarily aqueous such as the vitreous, for example. Tissue concentrations of therapeutic<br>
agents expressed in unit of mass per mass generally refer to other tissues such as the sclera<br>
or retina choroid tissues, for example.<br>
[0387] One concentration of rapamycin that may be used in the methods described<br>
herein is one that provides about 0.01 pg/ml or pg/mg or more of rapamycin at the tissue<br>
level. Another concentration that may be used is one that provides about 0.1 pg/ml or<br>
ng/mg or more at the tissue level. Another concentration that may be used is one that<br>
provides about 1 pg/ml or ng/mg or more at the tissue level Another concetration that<br>
may be used is one that provides about 0.01 ng/ml or ng/mg or more at the tissue level.<br>
Another concentration that may be used is one that provides about 0.1 ng/ml or ng/mg or<br>
96<br><br>
PCT/US2006/004962<br>
WO 2006/086750<br>
more at the tissue level. Another concentration that may be used is one that provides<br>
about 0.5 ng/ml or ng/mg or more at the tissue level. Another concentration that may be<br>
used is one that provides about 1 ng/ml or more at the tissue level. Another concentration<br>
that may be used is one that provides about 2 ng/ml or more at the tissue level. Another<br>
concentration that may be used is one that provides about 3 ng/ml or more at the tissue<br>
level. Another concentration that may be used is one that provides about 5 ng/ml or more<br>
at the tissue level. Another concentration that may be used is one that provides about 10<br>
ng/ml or more at the tissue level. Another concentration that may be used is one that<br>
provides about 15 ng/ml or more at the tissue level. Another concentration that may be<br>
used is one that provides about 20 ng/ml or more at the tissue level. Another<br>
concentration that may be used is one that provides about 30 ng/ml or more at the tissue<br>
level. Another concentration that may be used is one that provides about 50 ng/ml or<br>
more at the tissue level. One of ordinary skill in the art would know how to arrive at an<br>
appropriate concentration depending on the route arid duration of administration utilized,<br>
given the teachings herein.<br>
[0388] Generally, the amount of rapamycin administered in a liquid formulation is an<br>
amount sufficient to treat, prevent, inhibit, delay-the onset, or cause regression of the<br>
disease or condition of the eye for the required amount of time. In some variations the<br>
amount of rapamycin administered in the liquid formulation is an amount sufficient to<br>

[0405] Delivery of the therapeutic agents described herein may, for example, be<br>
delivered at a dosage range between about 1 ng/day and about 100 µg/day, or at dosages<br>
higher or lower than this range, depending on the route and duration of administration. In<br>

for delivery to the eye, as one nonlirniting example by ocular or periocular administration,<br>
of therapeutically effective amounts of rapamycin for extended periods of time to treat,<br>
prevent, inhibit, delay the onset of, or cause regression of CNV, and thus may be used to<br>

dry AMD to wet AMD. It is believed that by changing certain characteristics of the liquid-<br>
formulations described herein, including but not limited to the components of the liquid<br>
formulations, the location in the eye to which the liquid formulation is delivered,<br>
including without limitation subconjunctival or intravitreal placement, the liquid<br>

inhibition or causing regression. A subject suffering from wet AMD may have CNV<br>
lesions, and it is believed that administration of a therapeutically effective amount of<br>
rapamycin may have a variety of effects, including but not limited to causing regression of<br>
the CNV lesions, stabilizing the CNV lesion, and preventing progression of an active<br>
CNV lesion.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
[0409] Unless the context indicates otherwise, the error bars in the charts show one<br>
standard deviation. Where ethanol is used, it is 200 proof ethanol from Gold Shield<br>
Distributors, Hayward, CA. Where rapamycin is used, it is from LC laboratories, Woburn,<br>
MA, or Chunghwa Chemical Synthesis &amp; Biotech Co., LTD (CCSB), Taipei Hsien,<br>
Taiwan, ROC. Where PEG 400 is used, it is from The Dow Chemical Company, New<br>
Milford, CT. Some of the graphs use the expression "µL" or "µg" to refer to µg or µg,<br>
respectively. Where a volume of 10 µg or less is administered, Hamilton HPLC syringes<br>
were used.<br>
Example 1 - Preparation and Characterization of a Rapamycin-Containing Solution<br>
[0410] 1.256% rapamycin (percentage of the total weight) was dissolved in 9.676%<br>
etlianol (percentage of the total weight). Anaqueous solution of 15% F127 (Lutrol) in<br>
sterile water was slowly added under continuous agitation. The final concentration was<br>
approximately 78.57% sterile water (percentage of the total weight) and approximately<br>
10.50% F127 (Lutrol) (percentage of the total weight). This solution is listed as<br>
formulation #32 in Table 1. The solution was placed at 2°C until use.<br>
Example 2 - Subconjunctival Injection of a Rapamycin-Containing Solution<br>
[0411] 50 µg of the solution described in Example 1 was injected between the sclera and<br>
the conjunctiva of the eye of New Zealand white rabbits.<br>
[0412] Fig. 2 depicts the average concentration of rapamycin present in the vitreous<br>
(ng/ml), retina choroid (ng/mg), and sclera (ng/mg) on a logarithmic scale at 20,40,67,<br>
and 90 days after injection.<br>
[0413] The analysis was by liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LCMS) using an<br>
internal standard.<br>
[0414] At each timepoint, the average concentration ofrapamycin was calculated by<br>
adding the concentrations of rapamycin obtained for each sye from each rabbit, and<br>
dividing the total by the number of eyes analyzed. In this experiment, each timepoint<br>
106<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
represents the average of either two eyes of each of two rabbits (four eyes at that<br>
timepoint) or the average of two eyes of one rabbits (two eyes at that timepoint).<br>
[0415] The full vitreous was homogenized and analyzed. The average concentration of<br>
the vitreous was calculated by dividing the mass of rapamycin measured by the volume of<br>
vitreous analyzed. The sample did not include the site of administration; thus, this<br>
measurement indicated the level of rapamycin delivered to the vitreous via the solution.<br>
[0416] The average level of rapamycin in the vitreous at 20, 40, 67, and 90 days after<br>
subconjunctival injection was about 4.425, 3.800, 4.100, and 1.500 ng/ml, respectively.<br>
[0417] The full retina choroid was homogenized and analyzed. The average<br>
concentration of the retina choroid was calculated by dividing the mass of rapamycin<br>
measured by the mass of retina choroid analyzed. The sample did not include the site of<br>
administration; thus, this measurement indicated the level of rapamycin delivered to the<br>
retina choroid via the solution.<br>
[0418] The average level of rapamycin in the retina choroid at 20, 40, 67, and 90 days<br>
after subconjunctival injection was about 0.055, 0.209, 0.080, and 0.017 ng/mg,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0419] The sclera was analyzed in the same way as the retina choroid. The scleral<br>
sample included the site of injection; thus, this measurement indicated clearance of<br>
rapamycin from the sclera.<br>
[0420] The average level of rapamycin in the sclera at 20, 40, 67, and 90 days after<br>
subconjunctival injection was about 0.141, 0.271, 0.067, and 0.192 ng/mg, respectively.<br>
Example 3 — Preparation and Characterization of a Rapamycin-Containing Solution<br>
[0421] 5.233% rapamycin (per weight of the total of the formulation after all<br>
components were added) was dissolved in 0.4177 g of EtOH; the quantity of EtOH was<br>
reduced by forced evaporation (heat) to 0.1296g (6.344%, w/w). PEG 400 was added<br>
under continuous agitation. Final concentrations as a percentage of the total weight were<br>
approximately: rapamycin 5.233%, ethanol 6.344%, and PEG 400 88.424%. When<br>
contacted with the vitreous, the formulation formed a non-dispersed mass relative to the<br>
surrounding medium. This solution is listed as formulation #34 in Table 1.<br>

[0422] 25µl of the solution described in Example 3 were injected between the sclera<br>
and the conjunctiva of the eye of New Zealand white rabbits.<br>
[0423] Fig. 3 depicts the level of rapamycin present in the vitreous (ng/ml), retina<br>
choroid (ng/mg), and sclera (ng/mg) on a logarithmic scale at 14, 35, 62, and 85 days after<br>
injection. The level of rapamycin present in the vitreous (ng/ml) is also shown at 2 days<br>
after injection.<br>
[0424] The vitreous was homogenized and analyzed as described in Example 2, except<br>
on day 2 a single eye of each of three rabbits was analyzed; at day 14 two eyes from each<br>
of two rabbits were analyzed; at day 35 two eyes from a single rabbit were analyzed; at<br>
day 62 two eyes from a single rabbit were analyzed; and at day 85 one eye from a single<br>
rabbit plus two eyes from a second rabbit were analyzed.<br>
[0425] The vitreous sample did not include the site of administration; thus, this<br>
measurement indicated the level of rapamycin delivered to the vitreous via the solution.<br>
The average level of rapamycin in the vitreous at 2, 14, 35, 62, and 85 days after<br>
subconjunctival injection was about 3.57, 53.65, 9.00,4.700, and 0.600 ng/ml,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0426] The retina
- with the samples taken on the days as described for the vitreous above. No day 2 analysis<br>
was done. The retina choroid sample did not include the site of administration; thus, this<br>
measurement indicated the level of rapamycin delivered to the retina choroid via the<br>
solution. The average level of rapamycin in the retina choroid at 14, 35, 62, and 85 days<br>
after subconjunctival injection was about 0.4815, 1.725, 0.057, and 0.009 ng/mg,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0427] The scleral sample was analyzed as described in Example 2, and the samples<br>
were taken on the days as described for the retina choroid as above. The scleral sample<br>
included the site of injection; thus, this measurement indicated clearance of rapamycin<br>
from the sclera. The average level of rapamycin in the sclera at 14, 35, 62, and 85 days<br>
after subconjunctival injection was about 34.5815, 0.135, 0.042, and 0.163666667 ng/mg,<br>
respectively.<br>
Example 5— Infrawtreal Injection of a Rapamycin-Containing Solution<br>
[0428] 25 ul of the solution described in Example 3 was injected into the vitreous of the<br>
eye of New Zealand white rabbits. Fig. 4 depicts the level of rapamycin present in the<br>

vitreous (ng/ml), retina choroid (ng/mg), and sclera (ng/mg) on a logarithmic scale at 14,<br>
35, 62, and 90 days after injection. The level of rapamycin present in the vitreous (ng/ml)<br>
is also shown at 2 days after injection.<br>
[0429] The vitreous was homogenized and analyzed as described in Example 2, except<br>
on day 2 approximately 1 l of a single eye of each of three rabbits was analyzed; at day<br>
14 two eyes from each of two rabbits were analyzed; at day 35 two eyes from a single<br>
rabbit were analyzed; at day 62 two eyes from a single rabbit were analyzed; and at day 90<br>
two eyes from each of two rabbits were analyzed.<br>
[0430] Excepting the day 2 sample, the vitreous samples included the site of<br>
administration. An effort was made to avoid the administered solution where possible.<br>
However, the accuracy of the measured levels of rapamycin was potentially affected by<br>
sampling errors due to inadvertent inclusion of the administered solution.<br>
[0431] The average level of rapamycin in the vitreous at 2,14, 35, 62, and 90 days after<br>
intravitreal injection was about 11.4, 136538,2850.3,21820.35, and 27142.75 ng/ml,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0432] The retina choroid was homogenized and analyzed as described in Example 2,<br>
with the samples taken on the days described for the vitreous-above. No day 2 analysis<br>
. was done. The retina choroid sample did not include the site of administration; thus, this<br>
measurement indicated the level of rapamycin delivered to the retina choroid via the<br>
solution. The average level of rapamycin in the retina choroid at 14,35, 62, and 90 days<br>
after intravitreal injection was about 5.78975,244.485, 0.105, and 1.782 ng/mg,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0433] The scleral sample was analyzed as described in Example 2, and the samples<br>
were taken on the days as described for the retina choroid above. The scleral sample did<br>
not include the site of injection; thus, this measurement indicated level of rapamycin<br>
delivered to the sclera. The average level of rapamycin in the sclera at 14, 35, 62, and 90<br>
days after intravitreal injection was about 0.5695,12.34,0.8505, and 0.71175 ng/mg,<br>
respectively.<br>

Example 7 - Intravitreal Injection of a Rapamycin-Containing Suspension<br>
[0435] The solution prepared in Example 6 was injected intravitreally into the eyes of<br>
New Zealand white rabbits. Fig. 5 depicts images of rabbit eyes after intravitreal injection<br>
of 10 µg (Fig. 5 A), 20 µg (Fig. 5B), and 40 µg (Fig. 5C) of a 6% rapamycin suspension in<br>
PEG400. This resulted in an injected dose of about 0.6, about 1.2, and about 2.4 mg. The<br>
images were focused on the administered suspension. These images show that the<br>
suspension forms a non-dispersed mass relative to the surrounding vitreal medium.<br>
Example 8 - Preparation and Characterization of a Rapamycin-Containing In Situ<br>
Gelling Formulation<br>
[0436] A liquid formulation of 4.2% rapamycin (obtained from LC laboratories in<br>
Woburn, MA, and Chunghwa Chemical Synthesis &amp; BioTech. Co, Ltd in Taiwan), 4.3%<br>
ethanol (obtained from Gold Shield Chemical in Hayward, CA), 2.2% PVP K90 (obtained<br>
from BASF), 87.1% PEG 400 (obtained from DOW Chemical), and 2.2% Eudragit RL<br>
100 (obtained from Rohm Pharma Polymers), where all percentages are by weight of the<br>
total.<br>
[0437] Eudragit RL 100 was dissolved in ethanol. Sonication and heat may be required<br>
..at this step. Ethanol - Eudragit was added to PEG 400. PVP was slowly added to the<br>
Eudragit-Ethanol-PEG solution, and a uniformly mixed solution was obtained. Vigorous<br>
mixing may be required for this step.<br>
[0438] Rapamycin was added to and dissolved in the Eudragit-ethanol-PEG-PVP mix.<br>
Heat and sonication may be used. The formulation was mixed thoroughly (using a vortex<br>
or mixer) to achieve uniformity. This formulation is listed as #37 in Table 1.<br>
[0439] When placed in deionized water or tap water, the liquid formulation formed a<br>
non-dispersed mass. The non-dispersed mass appeared as a gel-like substance.<br>
Example 9 -Subconjunctival Injection of a Rapamycin-Containing Non-Dispersed Mass-<br>
Forming Fonnulation<br>
[0440] 50 ul of the solution described in Example 8 was injected between the sclera and<br>
the conjunctiva of the eye of New Zealand white rabbits.<br>
[0441] Fig. 6 depicts the average concentration of rapamycin pesent in the vitreo us<br>
(ng/ml), retina choroid tissues (ng/mg), and sclera (ng/mg) on a logarithmic scale at 7, 32,<br>

110<br><br>
WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
[0442] The analysis was by LCMS (liquid chromatography - mass spectroscopy).<br>
[0443] Where more than a single eye was analyzed, the average concentration of<br>
rapamycin was calculated by adding the concentrations of rapamycin obtained for each<br>
eye from each rabbit, and dividing the total by the number of eyes analyzed. In this<br>
experiment, the vitreous day 7 and the sclera day 7,32, and 45 timepoints represent a<br>
single eye, as opposed to an average level. The remaining day 7, 32, and 45 timepoints<br>
represent the average of two eyes of one rabbit, and the day 90 timepoint represents the<br>
average of two eyes of each of two rabbits (four eyes total).<br>
[0444] The full vitreous was homogenized and analyzed. The average concentration of<br>
the vitreous was calculated by dividing the mass of rapamycin measured by the volume of<br>
vitreous analyzed. The sample did not include the site of administration; thus, this<br>
measurement indicated the level of rapamycin delivered to the vitreous via the in situ<br>
gelling formulation.<br>
[0445] The average level of rapamycin in the vitreous at 7, 32, 45, and 90 days after<br>
subconjunctival injection was about 13.9, about 7.4, about 1.35, and about 9.9 ng/ml,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0446] The full retina choroid tissues were homogenized and analyzed. The average<br>
concentration of the retina choroid tissues was calculated by dividing the mass of<br>
rapamycin measured by the mass of retina choroid tissues analyzed. The sample did not<br>
include the site of administration; thus, this measurement indicated the level of rapamycin<br>
delivered to the retina choroid tissues via the in situ gelling formulation.<br>
[0447] The average level of rapamycin in the retina choroid tissues at 7, 32, 45, and 90<br>
days after subconjunctival injection was about 0.376, about 0.1875, about 0.136, and<br>
about 0.29 ng/mg, respectively.<br>
[0448] The sclera was analyzed in the same way as the retina choroid tissues. The<br>
scleral sample may have included the injected liquid formulation; thus, this measurement<br>
was indicative of clearance of rapamycin from the sclera.<br>
[0449] The average level of rapamycin in the sclera at 7, 32,45, and 90 days after<br>
subconjunctival injection was about 2033, about 1653, about 3626, and about 420.5<br>
ng/mg, respectively.<br>

[0450] A rapamycin containing suspension was formed by dispersing 150.5 mg of<br>
rapamycin (3.004 % by weight) in 4860.3 mg of PEG 400 (96.996% by weight). This<br>
formulation is listed as #49 in Table 1. 150.5 mg rapamycin (3.004 % by weight) and<br>
4860.3 mg of PEG 400 (96.996% by weight) were placed in an amber vial. High Wear<br>
Resistant Zirconia Grinding Media (beads) of 3 mm diameter were added, up to three<br>
quarters of the total volume. The vial was sealed and placed in a Cole-Parmer milling<br>
apparatus for 48 hrs. The particle size median for rapamycin was 2.8386 mm and the<br>
mean was 3.1275 mm. The formulation was kept at 4C until use. Volumes of 20 ul and<br>
40  each formed a non-dispersed mass when placed in the vitreous of a rabbit eye.<br>
Example 11 - Subconjunctival Injection of a Rapamycin-Containing Suspension.<br>
[0451] 40 1 of the suspension described in Example 10 were injected between the<br>
sclera and the conjunctiva of the eye of New Zealand white rabbits. Fig. 7 depicts the<br>
level of rapamycin in the vitreous (ng/ml), retina choroid (ng/mg), and the sclera (ng/mg)<br>
on a logarithmic scale at 14, 42, 63, and 91 days after injection.<br>
[0452] The vitreous was homogenized and analyzed as described in Example 2. Two<br>
eyes from each of two rabbits were analyzed at each time point except for day 91, on"<br>
- which two eyes from one rabbit were analyzed. The vitreous sample did not include the<br>
site of administration, so this measurement indicated the level of rapamycin delivered to<br>
the vitreous. The average level of rapamycin in the vitreous at 14, 42, 63, and 91 days<br>
after subconjunctival injection was about 4.031, 23.11, 53.27, and 13.94 ng/ml,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0453] The retina choroid was homogenized and analyzed as described in Example 2,<br>
with the samples taken as described for the vitreous above. The retina choroid did not<br>
include the site of administration, so this measurement indicated the level of rapamycin<br>
delivered to the retina choroid. The average level of rapamycin in the retina choroid at 14,<br>
42, 63, and 91 days after subconjunctival injection was about 0.1577, 4.965, 0.385, and<br>
0.05 ng/mg, respectively.<br>
[0454] The scleral sample was homogenized and analyzed as described in Example 2,<br>

[0455] 20 µl of the suspension described in Example 10 were injected into the vitreous<br>
of the eye of New Zealand white rabbits. The injected suspension formed a non-dispersed<br>
mass relative to the surrounding medium. Fig. 8 depicts the level of rapamycin in the<br>
retina choroid (ng/mg) and the sclera (ng/mg) on a logarithmic scale at 14, 42, 63, and 91<br>
days after injection and in the vitreous (ng/ml) at 63 and 91 days after injection.<br>
[0456] The vitreous was homogenized and analyzed as described in Example 2. Two<br>
eyes from each of two rabbits were analyzed at each time point. The vitreous sample may<br>
have included the site of administration. The average level of rapamycin in the vitreous at<br>
63 and 91 days after intravitreal injection was about 381,600 and 150,400 ng/ml,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0457] The retina choroid was homogenized and analyzed as described in Example 2.<br>
Two eyes from each of two rabbits were analyzed at each time point. The retina choroid<br>
did not include the site of administration, so this measurement indicated the level of<br>
rapamycin delivered to the retina choroid. The average level of rapamycin in the retina<br>
choroid at 14, 42, 63, and 91 days after intravitreal injection was about 2.588, 4.249,<br>
21.42, and 0.922 ng/mg, respectively.<br>
[0458] The scleral sample was homogenized and analyzed as described in Example 2,<br>
with the samples taken as described for the retina choroid above. The scleral sample did<br>
not include the site of injection, so this measurement indicated the level of rapamycin<br>
delivered to the sclera. The average level of rapamycin in the sclera at 14, 42, 63, and 91<br>
days after intravitreal injection was about 0.7327, 6.053,1.373, and 17.49 ng/mg,<br>

[0461] The vitreous was homogenized and analyzed as described in Example 2. Two<br>
eyes from each of two rabbits were analyzed at each time point except for day 91, on<br>
which two eyes from one rabbit were analyzed. The vitreous sample did not include the<br>
site of administration, so this measurement indicated the level of rapamycin delivered to<br>
the vitreous. The average level of rapamycin in the vitreous at 14, 42, 63, and 91 days<br>
after subconjunctival injection was about 1.804, 1.854,1.785, and 1.255 ng/ml,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0462] The retina choroid was homogenized and analyzed as described in Example 2,<br>
with the samples taken as described for the vitreous above. The retina choroid did not<br>
include the site of administration, so this measurement indicated the level of rapamycin<br>
delivered to the retina choroid. The average level of rapamycin in the retina choroid at 14,<br>
42, 63, and 91 days after subconjunctival injection was about 1.221,4.697, 0.1075, and<br>

Example 15 — Intravitreal Injection of a Rapamycin-Containing Solution<br>
[0464] 30 µl of the solution described in Example 13 were injected into the vitreous of<br>
the eye of New Zealand white rabbits. The injected solution formed a non-dispersed mass<br>
relative to the surrounding medium. Fig. 10 depicts the level of rapamycin in the retina<br>
choroid (ng/mg) and the sclera (ng/mg) on a linear scale at 14,42, 63, and 91 days after<br>

WO 2006/086750	PCT/US2006/004962<br>
rapamycin delivered to the retina choroid. The average level of rapamycin in the retina<br>

0.3833, and 11.52 ng/mg, respectively.<br>
[0466] The scleral sample was homogenized and analyzed as described in Example 2,<br>
with the samples taken as described for the retina choroid above. The scleral sample did<br>
not include the site of injection, so this measurement indicated the level of rapamycin<br>
delivered to the sclera. The average level of rapamycin in the sclera at 14, 42, 63, and 91<br>
days after intravitreal injection was about 1.077, 0.9239, 0.0975, and 2.0825 ng/mg,<br>

in Example 2. Two eyes from each of two rabbits were analyzed at each time point. The<br>
vitreous sample may have included the site of administration. The average level of<br>
rapamycin in the vitreous at 63 and 91 days after intravitreal injection was about 299,900<br>
and 196,600 ng/ml, respectively.<br>
Example 16 - Preparation and Characterization of a Rapamycin-Containing Solution<br>
[0468] About 320 g of ethanol was sparged with N2 for about 10 minutes, and then<br>
about 40 g of sirolimus was added to the ethanol. The mixture was sonicated for about 20<br>
minutes, by the end of which all of the sirolimus had gone into solution to form a<br>
sirolimus stock solution. A diluent solvent was prepared by sonicating about 1880 g of<br>
PEG 400 for about 60 minutes, and then sparging the solvent with Nitrogen for about 10<br>
minutes.<br>
[0469] The sirolimus stock solution and the PEG 400 were then rotated at about room<br>
temperature in a rotary evaporator for about 10 minutes to mix the stock solution with the<br>
diluent solvent. After mixing, the solution was sparged with nitrogen for about 10<br>
minutes and blanketed with nitrogen for about 5 minutes. After the solution was sparged<br>
and filled with nitrogen, about 240 g of excess ethanol was evaporated from the solution<br>
by increasing the solution temperature, maintaining a temperature that did not exceed<br>
40°C for an extended period of time and continuing to rotate the solution for about 2.5<br>
hours.	<br>
[0470] The resulting solution comprised about 40 g of sirolimus (about 2% by weight),<br>
about 80 g of ethanol (about 4% by weight), and about 1880 g of PEG 400 (about 94% by<br>
115<br><br>
PCT/US2006/004962<br>
WO 2006/086750<br>
weight). This solution was sparged with nitrogen for about 10 minutes and blanketed<br>
with nitrogen for about 5 minutes. The solution was then filtered through a 0.2 micron<br>
filter. HPLC vials were filled with 2 ml each of the filtered solution to leave a head space<br>
in each container of about 400 l. This head space was filled with nitrogen gas and<br>
capped.<br>
Example 17 - Preparation and Characterization of a Rapamycin-Containing Solution.<br>
[0471] Rapamycin, ethanol and PEG 400 were placed in a container to give final<br>
concentrations by weight of about 2.00% rapamycin, about 4.00% ethanol, and about<br>
94.00% PEG 400. The mixture was capped and sonicated for 1-2 hours. The sonication<br>
generated heat, with temperatures of up to about 40 or 50°C. This solution is listed as<br>
formulation #100 in Table 1. Volumes of 1 l, 3 ul, 20 l, and 40 l formed a non-<br>
dispersed mass in the vitreous of rabbit eyes.<br>
Example 18 — Subconjunctival Injection of a Rapamycin-Containing Solution<br>
[0472] 20 l of the solution described in Example 17 were injected between the sclera<br>
and the conjunctiva of the eye of New Zealand white rabbits. Fig. 12 depicts the level of<br>
rapamycin in the vitreous on a logarithmic scale at 5, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days after<br>
injection. Fig. 13 depicts the level of rapamycin in the retina choroid on a logarithmic<br>
scale at the same time points. For comparison, Fig. 12 and Fig. 13 also depict results of<br>
similar studies, performed with 40 l and 60 l injections, described below in Example 19<br>
and Example 20.<br>
[0473] In Figs. 12-15, discussed in this and following examples, some outlier points<br>
have been omitted. Individual data points from the same study at the same time point<br>
were compared to each other. When the arithmetic mean of the data points was lower<br>
than their standard deviation, the data points that were higher or lower by an order of<br>
magnitude were considered as outliers.<br>
[0474] The vitreous was homogenized and analyzed as described in Example 2.<br>
Between two and five rabbit eyes were analyzed at each time point. The vitreous sample<br>

were analyzed at the 5 and 30 day time points. The retina choroid did not include the site<br>
of administration, so this measurement indicated the level of rapamycin delivered to the<br>
retina choroid. The average level of rapamycin in the retina choroid at 5, 30, and 90 days<br>
after intravitreal injection was about 4.75, 0.17, and 0.01 ng/mg, respectively.<br>
Example 40-Subconjunctival Injection of a Rapamycin-Containing Solution<br>
[0527] 40 µl of the solution described in Example 17 were injected between the sclera<br>
and the conjunctiva of the eye of New Zealand white rabbits. Fig. 22 depicts on a<br>

logarithmic scale the level of rapamycin in the aqueous humor (ng/ml) at 1, 4,1, 11, 14.<br>
21, 28, 35, 54, and 56 days after injection, and the levels of rapamycin in the cornea<br>
(ng/mg) and the retina choroid (ng/mg) at 4, 14, 21, and 35 days after injection. The<br>
retina choroid level is labeled as "R/Choroid" in figure 22.<br>
[0528] The aqueous humor was homogenized and then analyzed by liquid<br>
chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Four rabbit eyes were analyzed for each time<br>
point. The aqueous humor did not include the site of injection, so this measurement<br>
indicated the level of rapamycin delivered to the aqueous humor. The average level of<br>
rapamycin in the aqueous humor at 1, 4, 7, 11, 14, 21, 28, 35, 54, and 56 days after<br>
injection was about 0.875, 1.0, 7.0, 0.725, 0.5, 0.525, 0.0, 0.125, 0.014, and 0.0485 ng/ml,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0529] The cornea was homogenized and then analyzed by liquid chromatography and<br>
mass spectroscopy. The cornea did not include the site of injection, so this measurement<br>
indicated the level of rapamycin delivered to the cornea. Four rabbit eyes were analyzed<br>
for each time point. The average level of rapamycin in the cornea at 4, 14, 21, and 35<br>
days after injection was about 0.3225, 0.1, 0,0275, and 0.0125 ng/mg, respectively.<br>
[0530] The retina choroid was homogenized and analyzed as described in Example 2,<br>
with the samples taken as described for the vitreous above. The retina choroid did not<br>
include the site of administration, so this measurement indicated the level of rapamycin<br>
delivered to the retina choroid. The average level of rapamycin in the retina choroid at 4,<br>
14, 21, and 35 days after injection was about 11.61, 0.2, 0.0275, and 2.655 ng/mg,<br>
respectively.<br>
Example 41 - Intravitreal Injection of a Rapamycin-Containing Solution<br>
[0531] 1.0 (J.1 of the solution described in Example 17 was injected into the vitreous of<br>
the eye of New Zealand white rabbits. The injected solution formed a non-dispersed mass<br>
