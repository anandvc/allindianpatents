				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a beverage dispensing nozzle and a method of dispensing a beverage drink.<br>
1.	Cross Reference to Related Applications<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U. S. Patent No. 6,098,842, which was a continuation-in-part of application number 09/128, 241, filed August 8,1998 and now abandoned.<br>
2.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to beverage dispensing nozzles and, more particularly, but not by way of limitation, to a beverage dispensing nozzle for dispensing multiple flavored drinks from a single nozzle without intermingling flavors.<br>
3.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Due to increases in both the number of customers served and the volume of drinks dispensed by the food and drink service industry and counter space being at a premium, standard drink dispensing nozzles fail to meet customer demand. In order to reduce space requirements and also for aesthetic reasons, it is desirable to dispense multiple flavors of drinks from a single nozzle.<br>
In dispensing drinks from a nozzle, it is essential that the flavored syrup be intimately mixed with a mixing fluid, such as carbonated or plain water, so that the resulting drink is of uniform consistency. When the mixing fluid is carbonated water, it is essential that the carbonated water and syrup be mixed in such a manner that the carbon dioxide does not excessively escape and produce undesirable foaming.<br>
One major problem encountered with multiple flavor nozzles is syrup carryover. It is very difficult to completely remove the residual syrup from a previously dispensed drink to avoid carryover into a subsequent, different flavored drink. This carryover causes problems with the flavor, the color, and the smell of dispensed drinks. Even small amounts of carryover syrup which cause only minor problems with odor and taste have a significant effect on the color of clear drinks, which is undesirable.<br>
Another problem that must be addressed is proper mixing of the mixing fluid, such as carbonated or plain water, and syrup. To insure proper mixing, it is necessary to expose the maximum surface area of the syrup to the mixing fluid. If the mixing is to occur<br>
Excessive foaming is another problem when the mixing fluid is carbonated water. To prevent excessive foaming, the carbonated water, which enters the nozzle at a high pressure, must be gently reduced to atmospheric pressure so that a minimum of carbon dioxide will<br>
- 2-<br><br>
escape salution. At high flow rates, out-gassing of carbon dioxide is particularly troublesome. Consequently, as the carbonated wafer releases carbon dioxide in both the nozzle and the cup, Ihc released carbon dioxide escaping solution causes excessive foaming of the dispensed beverage. That excessive foaming ereales a poor product because the drink is generally "flat".<br>
Prior attempts to solve the aforementioned problems with multiple flavor nozzles have not been successful. IN most instances, as in U.S. Patent 4,928,854, which issued on May 29, 1990, to McGinn, the syrup is delivered to the nozzle exit through a separate tubular conduit for each flavor. The syrup flows through a plurality of separate conduits to a discharge opening into a water channel for delivery to thc exit end of the nozzle. The total surface area of syrup presented for contact with the mixing fluid is relatively small; thus proper mixing is difficult. The configuration also makes it difficult to eliminate syrup carryover. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a beverage dispensing nozzle, includes a cap member having first, second, and third beverage syrup inlet ports coupled to first, second, mid third beverage syrup sources and a mixing fluid inlet port coupled to a mixing fluid source. A-first annulus, a second annulus, and a third annulus are each coupled with the cap member for discharging from the beverage dispensing nozzle via discharge channels a beverage syrup delivered from a respective first, second, and third beverage syrup inlet port. An outer housing is coupled to the cap member and defines a mixing fluid channel with the first annulus for discharging from the beverage dispensing nozzle a mixing fluid delivered from the mixing fluid inlet port, which is mixed with exiting beverage syrup.<br>
' The first annulus, the second annulus, and the third annulus each include a groove therein that receives beverage syrup from a respective first, second, and third beverage syrup inlet port and delivers the beverage synip to the discharge channels. The cap member comprises a first, second, and third beverage syrup outlet port connected with a respective first, second, and third beverage syrup inlet port and a raised portion, wherein each raised portion fits within a respective groove to couple the first annulus, the second annulus, and the third nnnulus to the cap member and to communicate beverage syrup to the first annulus, ihc second nnnulus, and the third annulus. The cap member further includes a plurality of mixing fluid outlet channels connected to the mixing fluid inlet port and communicating with the mixing fluid channel for circumfcrcntially delivering mixing fluid into the mixing fluid channel.<br>
It is, therefore, an object of Ihc present invention to provide a beverage dispensing nozzle that dispenses a beverage syrup and mixing fluid at a high volume flow to form a<br>
-3-<br><br>
dispensed beverage drink.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide  beverage dispensing nozzle that eliminates slmtifioalion between the beverage syrup and'mixing fluid.<br>
 It is further object of the prcsent invention to provide a beverage dispensing nozzle thai is capable of dispensing multiple flavors while preventing carryover between different flavored syrups.<br>

The discharge member 53 include discharge channels 55 to aid the annular channel 54 in discharging (he beverage syrup because (he discharge member 53 is sized to substantially reside within the lower portion of the interior wall for the inner housing 16 (refer to Fig. 6). The discharge member 53 operates to discharge the beverage syrup in a restricted annular flow to insure uniform distribution of the beverage syrup as it exits from the beverage dispensing nozzle 10, (hereby providing a maximum surface area for contact with mixing fluid also exih'nj; from the beverage dispensing nozzle 10.<br>
The second or inlermcdiaie annulus 18 includes an upper member 56 and a discharge member 57 (refer to Figs. 1 and 2). The second or intermediate annulus 18 fits within the first or outer annulus 17 such that a portion of the upper member 56 engages the stair step 50. That portion of the upper member 56 may press fit with the stair step 50 or, as in this first embodiment, an adhesive may be used to secure that portion of the upper member 56 with the stair slop 50. The second or intermediate annulus 17 and the interior wall of the first or outer annulus 17 form nn annular channel 58 thai connects wilh the conduit 45 of the inner housing 16. The annular channel 58 insures a large volume of beverage syrup flows uniformly about the second or intermediate annulus 18 during discharge (refer to Figs 7-9). The discharge member 57 includes discharge channels 59 (o aid the annular channel 58 in discharging the beverage syrup because the discharge member 57 is sized to substantially reside within the lower portion of the interior wall for the first 0/ interior annulus 17. The discharge member 57 operates to discharge the beverage syrup in a restricted annular flow to insure uniform distribution, of the beverage syrup as it exits from the beverage dispensing nozzle 10, thereby providing a maximum surface area for contact with mixing fluid also exiting from the beverage dispensing nozzle 10.<br>
The third or inner annulus 19 includes a securing member 60, an intermediate member 61 and a discharge member 62 (refer to Figs. 1 and 2).The third or inner annulus 19 fits within the second or intermediate anualus 18 such that the securing member 60 protrudes through (he opening 44 of the inner housing and engages the interior wall of the inner housing 16 defining the opening 44. The securing member 60 may press fit with the interior wall of the inner housing 16 defining the opening 44 or, as in this first embodiment, an adhesive may be used to secure the securing member 60 with the interior wall of the inner housing 16 defining the opening 44. The third or inner annulus 19 and the stair step 51 and<br>
6-<br><br>
the interior wall of the second or intermediate annulus 18 form an annular channel 64 that connects will) the conduit 47 oi the inner housing 16. The annular channel 64 insures a large volume of beverage syrup flows uniformly about the third or interior annulus 19 during discharge (refer to Figs 7-9). The discharge member 62 includes discharge channels 63 to aid the annular channel 64 in discharging the beverage syrup because the discharge member 62 is sized to substantially reside within the lower portion of the interior wall for the second or intermediate annulus 18. The discharge member 62 operates to discharge the beverage syrup in a restricted annular flow to insure uniform distribution of the beverage syrup as it exits from the hevcrage dispensing nozzle 1 0, thereby providing a maximum surface area for contact with mixing fluid also exiting from the beverage dispensing nozzle 10, Although the preferred embodiment discloses annuluscs 17-19, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that alternative shapes, such as elliptical or polygonal, may be utilized.<br>
The cap member 11 includes beverage syrup inlet ports 21-23 that communicate with a respective beverage syrup outlet port 24-26 via a respective connecting conduit 37-39 through the cap member 11 (refer to Vigs. 1,2, and 7-9). The cap member 11 includes protrusion 35 to aid in the securing of the inner housing 16 to the cap member 11. The beverage syrup outlet ports 24-26 snap jit within a respective cavity 41-42 of the inner housing to secure the inner housing 16 to the cap member 11. The gaskets 13-15 fit around a respective beverage syrup ouiict port 24-26 to provide a fluid seal and to assist in the seeming of the inner housing 16 to the cap member 11. In addition, the securing member of the third or inner annulus 18 extending through the opening 44 of the inner housing 16 snap fits around the protrusion 35 of the cap member 11 to aid in the securing of the inner housing 16 to the cap member 11. With the inner housing 16 secured to the cap member 11, a beverage syrup path involving the beverage syrup inlet port 21; the conduit 37; the beverage syrup outlet port 24; the cavity 41; the conduit 45; and the annular channel 58, which includes the discharge channels 59. is created. A beverage syrup path involving the beverage syrup inlet port 22; the conduit 38; the beverage syrup outlet port 25; the cavity 42; the conduit 46; the annular channel 54, which includes (he discharge channels 55; and one involving the beverage syrup inlet port 23; the conduit 39; the beverage syrup outlet port 26; the cavity 43; the conduit 47; the annular channel 64, which includes the discharge channels 63; are also created.<br>
The cap member 11 includes a mixing fluid inlet port 27 that communicates with mixing fluid outlet channels 66-71 via o connecting conduit 28 through the cap member 11 (refer to Figs. 1-3 and 6). The mixing fluid outlet channels 66-71 in this first embodiment arc uniformly spaced within the cap member 11 and communicate with an annular cavity 36<br>
7<br><br>
defined by a portion of the cap member 11 to deliver mixing fluid along (be entire circumference of the annular cavity 36. In this Jirst embodiment, the preferred mixing fluid is carbonalcd water, which forms a carbonated beverage drink when combined with a beverage syrup. Nevertheless, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that olhcr mixing fluids, such as plain wafer may be uscd. .Furthermore, although the preferred embodiment discloses the formation of a beverage from a beverage syrup and a mixing fluid, such as carbonated or plain water, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a mixing fluid, such as carbonated or plain water, may be dispensed individually from a beverage path as described above instead ofa beverage syrup.<br>
The cap member 20 includes dog ears 29 and 30 that permit the connection of the cap member 11 to a standard dispensing valve using suitable and well known means. Bach of the beverage syrup inlet ports 21-23 receives a beverage syrup conduit to supply the beverage dispensing nozzle 10 with a beverage syrup. Similarly, the mixing fluid inlet port 27 receives a mixing fluid conduit to supply the beverage dispensing nozzle 10 with a mixing fluid. A fastening clip secured to each of bosses 31-33, utilizing a screw or other suitable means, maintains the beverage syrup conduits coupled with a respective beverage syrup inlet port 21 -23 and the mixing fluid conduit coupled with the mixing fluid inlet port 27. The cap member 11 includes a groove 34 for receiving the o-ring 12 therein.<br>
The outer housing 20 snap fits over thc cap member 11, including the o-ring 12 which provides a fluid seal and assists in the securing of the outer housing 16 to the cap member 11. The outer housing 20 includes flanges 74 and 75 and tabs 76 and 77 to mount the outer housing 20 to a standard dispensing valve in well known manner. The outer housing 20 further includes an iuwordly extending lip portion 73 at its exit end. The interior wall of the outer housing 20 in combination with the portion of the cap member 11 defining the annular cavity 36 and the exterior wall of the inner housing define an annular channel 72. With the outer housing 20 secured to the cap member 11, a mixing fluid path involving the mixing fluid inlet port 27, the conduit 28, the mixing fluid outlet channels 66-71, and the annular channel 72 is created. Although the preferred embodiment contemplates the dispensing ofa mixing fluid, such as carbonated or plain water, in combination with a beverage syrup, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that Ihc mixing fluid may be dispensed separately to provide the mixing fluid by itself.<br>
In operation, mixing fluid enters the beverage dispensing nozzle 10 through the o mixing fluid inlet port 27 and travels through the conduit 28 to the mixing fluid outlet channels 66-71 for delivery into (he annular cavity 36 (refer to Figs. 7-9). The annular cavity 36 receives a large volume of mixing fluid to insure the annular channel 72 remains full for<br>
8<br><br>
uniform flow around thc annular channel 72 as the mixing fluid flows downwardly through the annular channel 72 to the discharge cud of (he annular channel 72. In the preferred embodiments, the discharge end of the annular channel 72 may be partially closed to increase the momentum of thc mixing fluid exiling thc annular channel 72 to maintain a uniform distribution of mixing fluid exiling around the entire circumference of the annular channel 72. The inwardly extending Sip portion 73 of the outer housing 20 directs the mixing fluid inw.-inlly toward a lievciagc uynip slrcani exiling from one of discharge members 53, 57, and 62. The inward dircciing of the mixing fluid provides for intimate mixing as well as n means Jbr washing the discharge end of the annular channel 72 to prevent syrup caiTyovcr.<br>
The beverage syrup inlet ports 21-23 each receive a different flavor of beverage syrup, which is delivered through a conduit by a beverage syrup source (not shown). Each beverage syrup travels through its particular flow path for discharge from the beverage dispensing nozzle 10 as previously described (refer to Figs. 7-9). Illustratively, a beverage syrup delivered to the beverage syrup inlet port 21 flows through the conduit 37, the beverage syrup outlet port 24, the cavity 41, Hie conduit 45, the annular channel 58, and the discharge channels 59 prior to discharge from the beverage dispensing nozzle 10. The annular channels 54, 58, and 64 provide a large volume of beverage syrup around each of a respective first or outer, second or intermediate, and third or inner anmilus for discharge through one of the discharge members 53, 57, and 62. The discharge members 53, 57, and 62 restrict the flow of beverage syrup to insure uniform distribution of the beverage syrup as it exits from the beverage dispensing nozzle 10, thus insuring a maximum surface area for contact with the mixing .fluid exiting froin the annular channel 72. Although only one beverage syrup is typically dispensed at a time, it should be understood that more than one beverage syrup may be discharged from the beverage dispensing nozzle 10 at a time to provide a mix of flavors.<br>
An important feature of the beverage dispensing nozzle 10 is the annular discharge of a beverage syrup, whereby the annularly discharged mixing fluid contacts the beverage syrup in mid-air below the dispensing nozzel 10. The annular discharge shape of the beverage syrup and the mixing fluid significantly increases the contact surface area between the two streams, resulting in more effective mixing. Furthermore, the mixture of the beverage syrup and the mixing fluid outside the beverage dispensing nozzle 10 eliminates the sanitary considerations thai occur with a mixing chamber interior to the nozzle; namely, the unsanitary build up of bacteria on the interior of the mixing chamber, which is exacerbated due to Hie stickiness of the beverage syrup. Although three separate beverage syrup sources with three annuluscs have been described, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that any number of beverage syrup sources and annuhises could be provided, including a single beverage syrup<br>
-3-<br><br>
source and annulus. In addition, the .single stream of mixing fluid exiting from the annular channel 72 may be separated inlo two or more streams.<br>
As illustrated in Figs. 10-12, a second embodiment of the beverage dispensing nozzle 100 is virtually identical in configuration and operation to the first embodiment of the beverage dispensing nozzle 10. Consequently, components for the beverage dispensing nozzle 100 of like configuration and operation lo componcnis of the beverage dispensing nozzle ' 0 have been referenced with like numerals. The beverage dispensing nozzle 100'is configured ami operates as the beverage dispensing nozzle 10, except the beverage dispensing nozzle 100 includes a conduit 101 coupled to the conduit 2K to communicate mixing fluid into a center conduit 102 of the third or inner annulus 19. In addition, the third or inner annulus 18 includes an outlet 103 for discharging the mixing fluid interior lo a discharged beverage syrup stream. The conduit 28 therefore not only delivers mixing fluid to the mixing fluid outlet channels 66-71 but also to the conduit 101 for delivery to the center conduit 102. The center conduit 102 delivers the mixing fluid through the center of the beverage dispensing nozzle 100, where it exits inside a beverage syrup stream to enhance mixing of the mixing fluid and beverage syrup, The beverage dispensing nozzle 100 is particularly desirable for use in dispensing single flavor beverage drinks and for use with large volume beverage dispensing nozzles. A diffuscr 104 may be positioned within the conduit 101 to direct the mixing fluid onto the sides of the center conduit 102 to prevent a single stream exiting the outlet 103, thereby improving surface contact between the mixing fluid and beverage syrup.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 13, a third embodiment of the beverage dispensing nozzle 200 is virtually identical in con figuration and operation to the first embodiment of the beverage dispensing nozzle 10. Consequently, components for the beverage dispensing nozzle 200 of like configuration and operation to components of the beverage dispensing nozzle 10 have been referenced with like numerals, thc beverage dispensing nozzle 200 is configured and operates as the beverage dispensing nozzle 10, except, in the beverage dispensing nozzle 200, flic outlet end of the first or outer annulus 17 includes a conical cut-out portion 201, the outlet end of the second or intermediate annulus 18 includes a conical cut-out portion 202, and the outlet end of the third or inner annulus 19 includes a conical cut-out portion 203.

involving the beverage syrup inlc! port 915; a respective connecting conduit; the beverage syrup outlcl. port 918; a respective cavity defined by the groove 909; and the discharge cliiinncls 910; ami one involving Hit; beverage syrup inlet port 916; a respective connecting conduit; (lie beverage syrup outlet port 919; a respective cavity defined by the groove 911: and the discharge channels 912; arc also created.<br>
The enp member 901 includes a mixing fluid inlet port 923 (bat communicates with mixing fluid outlet channels 924 via a connecting conduit through the cap member 901. The mixing iluid outlet channels 924 in this tenth embodiment arc uniformly spaced within the cap member 901 and communicate with an annular cavity 925 defined by a portion of the cap member 901 to deliver mixing fluid along (he entire circumference of the annular cavity 97.5. In Ibis tenth embodiment, the preferred mixing fluid is carbonated water, which forms a carbonated beverage drink when combined with a beverage syrup. Nevertheless, one of ordinary skill in the art wilt recognize thai" other mixing fluids, such as plain water may be used. Furthermore, although Uic preferred embodiment discloses the formation of a beverage from a beverage syrup and a mixing fluid, such as carbonated or plain water, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a mixing fluid, such as carbonated or plain water, may be dispensed individually from a beverage path as described above instead of a beverage syrup. 'Hie cap member 901 includes dog cars 926-928 thai permit the connection of the cap member 901 to a standard dispensing valve using suitable and well known means. Each of the beverage syrup inlet ports 914-916 receives a beverage syrup conduit to supply the beverage dispensing nozzle 900 with a beverage syrup. Similarly, the mixing fluid inlet port 923 receives a mixing fluid conduit to supply Uic beverage dispensing nozzle 900 with a mixing fluid. A fastening clip secured to each of bosses 929-931, utilizing a screw or other suitable means, maintains ihc beverage syrup conduits coupled with a respective beverage syrup inlet port 914-916 and the mixing fluid conduit coupled with the mixing fluid inlet port 923. The cap member 901 includes a groove 932 for receiving the o-ring 902 therein.<br>
The outer housing 906 fits over the cap member 901, including the o-ring 902 which provides a fluid seal and assists in the securing of the outer housing 906 to tiie cap member 901, and is held in place via tabs 933-935. The outer housing 906 includes flange 936 that aids in mounting the outer housing 906 to a dispensing valve in well-known manner. The outer housing 906 further includes an inwardly extending lip portion 937 and slots 938 at its exit end. The interior wall of the outer housing 906 in combination with the portion of-the cap member 901 defining the annular cavity 36 and the exterior wall of the first or inner annulus 903 define an annular channel. With the outer housing 906 secured to the cap member 901, a mixing fluid path involving the mixing fluid inlet port 923, the connecting conduit, the<br>
16<br><br>
mixing .fluid outlet channels 924, ami the nnnulnr channel is created. Although the preferred embodiment contemplates Uic dispensing ofa mixing fluid, such as carbonated or plain water, in combination with a beverage syrup, one of ordinary skill in Iho art will recognize (hat Ihc mixing fluid may be dispensed separately to provide the mixing fluid by itself.<br>
in operation, mixing fluid enters the beverage dispensing nozzle 900 through the mixing fluid inlet port 923 and travels through the connecting conduit to the mixing fluid outlet channels 924 for delivery into the annular cavity 925. The annular cavity 925 receives , a large volume of mixing fluid to insure the annular channel remains full for uniform flow around the annular channel as the mixing fluid flows downwardly through the annular channel to the discharge end of the annular channel. In the tenth embodiment, the discharge end of Uic annular channel may be partially closed to increase the momentum of me mixing fluid exiting the annular channel to maintain a uniform distribution of mixing fluid exiting around Uic entire circumference of the annular channel. The inwardly extending lip portion 937 of the outer housing 906 directs the mixing fluid inwardly toward a beverage syrup stream exiting from one of Uic first or outer annulus 903, the second or intermediate annulus 904, and the Uiird or inner annulus 905. The inward directing of the mixing fluid provides for intimate mixing as well as a means for washing Uic discharge end of the annular channel to prevent syrup carryover.<br>
Furthermore, the slots 938 aid in the prevention of syrup carryover by preventing fluid bridging between the first or outer annulus 903 and the outer housing 906, which could result in beverage syrup being drawn from one of the first or outer annulus 903, the second or intenncdiate annulus 904, and the third or inner annulus 905. The slots 938 interrupt the surface of the outer housing 906 so that, upon the end ofa dispense, any remaining mixing fluid accumulates in a drop on the surface between each individual slot 938. The drop falls from the outer housing 906 due to gravity, thereby preventing fluid bridging between the first or outer annulus 903 and the outer housing 906.<br>
The beverage syrup inlet ports 914-916 each receive a different flavor ofbeverage syrup, which is delivered through a conduit by a beverage syrup source (not shown). Each beverage syrup travels through its particular flow path for discharge from Uic beverage dispensing nozzle 900 as previously described. Illustratively, a beverage syrup delivered to Uie beverage syrup inlet port 914 flows through the connecting conduit, the beverage syrup outlet port 917, the cavity defined by the groove 907, and the discharge channels 908 prior to discharge from Uic beverage dispensing nozzle 900. The discharge channels 908,910, and 912 provide beverage syrup around cacli of a respective first or outer, second or intermediate, and third or inner annulus for discharge from ihc beverage dispensing nozzle 900. The<br>
17<br><br>
discharge channels 908, .910, nnd 912 insure uniform distribution oflhc beverage syrup as H cxils from (Jic beverage dispensing no/./,le !)()0, thus insuring a maximum surface area for contact with (he mixing fluid exiling from ihc annular channel. Although only one beverage syrup i:; typically dispensed at a lime, jt should be understood that more than one beverage syrup may be discharged Jrom the beverage dispensing nozzle 900 at a time lo provide a mix of flavors.<br>
An important feature of the beverage dispensing nozzle 900 is the annular discharge of a beverage synip, whereby the annul arly discharged mixing fluid contacts u\e beverage syrup in mid-air below the dispensing nozzle 900. The annular discharge shape of Use beverage syrup and Ihc mixing Jluid significantly increases fJic contact surface area ttctween the two streams, resulting in more effective mixing. Furthermore, the mixture of (he beverage syrup and the mixing fluid outside the beverage dispensing nozzle 900 eliminates the sanitary considerations that occur with a mixing chamber interior to the nozzle; namely, the unsanitary build up of bacicrui on the interior of the mixing chamber, which is exacerbated due to the stickiness of the beverage syrup. Although three separate beverage syrup sources with three annuhiscs have been described, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize lha1 any number of beverage syrup sources and annuluscs could be provided, including a single beverage syrup source and annulus. Tn addition, the single stream of mixing fluid exiting from the annular channel may be separated into two or more streams.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in terms of the foregoing embodiment, such description has been for exemplary purposes only and, as will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, many alternatives, equivalents, and variations of varying degrees will fall within the scope of the present invention.
