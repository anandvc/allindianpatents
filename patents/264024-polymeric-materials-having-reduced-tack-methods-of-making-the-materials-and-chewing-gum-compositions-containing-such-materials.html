				<td>POLYMERIC MATERIALS HAVING REDUCED TACK, METHODS OF MAKING THE MATERIALS AND<br>
CHEWING GUM COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING SUCH MATERIALS<br>
The present invention relates to polymeric materials having reduced<br>
tack. It further relates to methods of making such materials and to chewing<br>
gum compositions containing such polymeric materials.<br>
Certain hydrocarbon polymers, such as homopolymers of diene<br>
monomers, for example, isoprene, exhibit the tendency to adhere to another<br>
surface when brought into intimate contact with that surface. However, in<br>
some applications of these hydrocarbon polymers, the property of<br>
adhesiveness can be a disadvantage. One such application is the use of<br>
such materials in chewing gum compositions.<br>
Chewing gum compositions are enjoyed by millions of people around<br>
the world. Unfortunately, many users of chewing gum do not, or are not able<br>
to, dispose of the chewed gum properly. Chewed gum which is not disposed<br>
of properly causes problems because of its tendency to adhere strongly to<br>
many surfaces with which it is allowed to come into intimate contact. Because<br>
of this, many public areas, particularly pavements, have become disfeatured<br>
by the presence of adhered pieces of discarded chewed gum. Chewing gum<br>
adhering to a surface is difficult to remove by traditional methods, especially if<br>
the gum has been in contact with the surface for more than a short period of<br>
time. Such surfaces may be power washed using water applied under high<br>
pressure, optionally in combination with scraping, in an attempt to remove<br>
adhered gum. Unfortunately, such a method requires the use of large<br>
amounts of water, can cause erosion of the surface being treated, is time and<br>
energy consuming and can often only be carried out when people have<br>
vacated the area being treated in view of the noise created and the large<br>
amounts of water required. Other typical methods of cleaning adhered<br>
chewed gum from surfaces include scraping, optionally with the use of low<br>
temperature material to cause the freezing of the gum, or the use of<br>
aggressive chemicals. Thus, methods of cleaning surfaces to remove<br>
adhered gum therefrom can be expensive and can, themselves, create a<br>
nuisance to the general public.<br>
It has been proposed that the problems mentioned above can be<br>
avoided by modifying the properties of chewing gum. For instance, US Patent<br>
No. 5,580,590 discloses an environmentally-friendly chewing gum<br>
composition which contains an elastic protein-based polymer. Due to the use<br>
of the elastic protein-based polymer, a chewing gum composition is provided<br>
that can, after being chewed, be more easily removed from a physical surface<br>
to which it is attached.<br>
â€¢ Chewing gum compositions typically comprise a water-insoluble<br>
chewable gum base portion which contains one or more elastomers such as<br>
polybutadiene, polyisoprene, butadiene-styrene copolymers, polyisobutylene<br>
and isobutylene-isoprene copolymers. These materials exhibit tack and, in<br>
time, can become strongly adhered to surfaces. The strong adhesion causes<br>
discarded chewing gum to resist separation from surfaces, such as those of<br>
pavements. The tack of a material is defined as the ability of that material to<br>
form a bond to a surface after brief contact under light pressure.<br>
The present invention is based on the discovery that the tack property<br>
of hydrocarbon polymers, for example, natural and synthetic rubbers, can be<br>
reduced if the hydrocarbon polymers are modified by attaching directly to their<br>
carbon-carbon backbones, certain side chains having hydrophilic character.<br>
Polymeric materials having side chains containing poiy(alkylene oxide)<br>
groups are disclosed in EP-A-1179564 as being useful in the manufacture of<br>
an antistatic resin composition. That document describes a graft copolymer<br>
comprising 50-95 wt% of at least one monomer selected from conjugated<br>
dienes (such as 1,3-butadiene or isoprene) and acrylate esters (such as ethyl<br>
or propyl acrylate), 5-50 wt% of at least one monomer having 4 to 500<br>
alkylene oxide groups and an ethylenically unsaturated bond (a "polyalkylene<br>
oxide monomer") and 0-50 wt% of one or more copolymerizable ethylenicallyunsaturated<br>
monomers. The polyalkylene oxide monomer is typically an<br>
acrylate or methacrylate ester of a poly(alkylene glycol). The graft copolymer<br>
is, thus, synthesized by a "grafting through" method (also known in the art as<br>
"grafting via macromonomers") and, accordingly, the polyalkylene oxide<br>
groups are attached to carbon atoms of the polymer backbone of the obtained<br>
copolymer via -C(O)O- groups.<br>
Accordingly, a first aspect of the invention provides a polymeric<br>
material having reduced tack which has a straight or branched chain carboncarbon<br>
polymer backbone and a multiplicity of side chains attached to the<br>
backbone wherein the side chains, which are attached directly to carbon<br>
atoms of the polymer backbone, have the formula<br>
c  wherein R1 is H, -C(O)OR4 or -C(O)Q and R2 is -C(O)OR4 or -C(O)Q<br>
provided that at least one of R1 and R2 is the group -C(O)Q;<br>
R3isHor-CH3;<br>
R4 is H or an alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms;<br>
Q is a group having the formula -O-(YO)b-(ZO)c-R5, wherein each of<br>
Y and Z is, independently, an alkylene group having from 2 to 4 carbon atoms<br>
and R5 is H or an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms;<br>
a is 3 or 4 and each of b and c is, independently, 0 or an integer of<br>
from 1 to 125 provided that the sum b + c has a value in the range of from 10<br>
to 250, preferably 10 to 120.<br>
The polymeric material of the invention has reduced tack, compared to<br>
the hydrocarbon polymer which is not modified by the presence of the side<br>
chains attached thereto. Furthermore, it is less adherent than the unmodified<br>
hydrocarbon polymer to certain surfaces.<br>
The polymeric material of the invention has a carbon-carbon polymer<br>
backbone typically derived from a homopolymer of an ethylenicallyunsaturated(Figure Removed)<br>
polymerizable hydrocarbon monomer or from a copolymer of two<br>
or more ethylenically-unsaturated polymerizable hydrocarbon monomers. By<br>
the term "ethylenically-unsaturated polymerizable hydrocarbon monomer" we<br>
mean a polymerizable hydrocarbon containing at least one carbon-carbon<br>
double bond which is capable of undergoing addition or chain-reaction<br>
polymerization to form a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon polymer<br>
having a carbon-carbon polymer backbone. According to one preferred<br>
embodiment, the carbon-carbon polymer backbone is derived from a<br>
homopolymer of an ethylenically-unsaturated polymerizable hydrocarbon<br>
monomer containing 4 or 5 carbon atoms, for example, isobutylene (2-<br>
methylpropene). The carbon-carbon polymer backbone may also, according<br>
to another embodiment, be derived from a homopolymer of a conjugated<br>
diene hydrocarbon monomer, especially one containing 4 or 5 carbon atoms,<br>
such as butadiene or isoprene.<br>
As mentioned above, the carbon-carbon polymer backbone may be<br>
derived from a copolymer of two or more ethylenically-unsaturated<br>
polymerizable hydrocarbon monomers. Preferably, it is derived from a<br>
copolymer of two such monomers. For example, it may be derived from a<br>
hydrocarbon copolymer of a hydrocarbon monomer having one carboncarbon<br>
double bond and a hydrocarbon monomer having two carbon-carbon<br>
double bonds. For example, the carbon-carbon polymer backbone may be<br>
derived from a copolymer of isobutylene and isoprene. According to a<br>
different embodiment, the carbon-carbon polymer backbone is derived from a<br>
butadiene-styrene block copolymer.<br>
It is especially preferred, in the present invention, that the polymeric<br>
material has a substantially linear carbon-carbon polymer backbone derived<br>
from a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon polymer which is an elastomer<br>
at ambient temperatures. Elastomeric polymers have a rubbery nature at<br>
temperatures above their glass transition temperature (Tg) and certain<br>
synthetic elastomers exhibit this and other properties associated with natural<br>
rubber, which is a polymer derived from cis-isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene)<br>
units. In the present invention, the polymeric material preferably has a<br>
substantially linear carbon-carbon polymer backbone derived from<br>
elastomeric polymers selected from polybutadiene, polyisoprene, butadienestyrene<br>
block copolymers, polyisobutylene and isobutylene-isoprene<br>
copolymers, more preferably polybutadiene, polyisoprene, polyisobutylene<br>
and isobutylene-isoprene copolymers and most preferably polyisoprene which<br>
may be natural rubber or synthetically produced polyisoprene. By the term<br>
"substantially linear" as used herein, we mean that the carbon-carbon<br>
backbone does not contain a significant degree of long-chain branching.<br>
The hydrocarbon polymer, from which the carbon-carbon polymer<br>
backbone of the polymeric material of the invention is derived, will typically<br>
have a molecular weight in the range of from 15,000 to 50,000, preferably<br>
from 25,000 to 40,000, to ensure that the polymeric material is not overly<br>
hard.<br>
As stated above, the polymeric material of the invention contains a<br>
multiplicity of side chains attached directly to carbon atoms of the carboncarbon<br>
polymer backbone. The side chains have the formula<br>
(Figure Removed)wherein R1 is H, -C(O)OR4 or -C(O)Q and R2 is -C(O)OR4 or -C(O)Q<br>
provided that at least one of R1 and R2 is the group -G(O)Q;<br>
R3isHor-CH3;<br>
R4 is H or an alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms;<br>
6<br>
Q is a group having the formula -O-(YO)b-(ZO)0-R5, wherein each of<br>
Y and Z is, independently, an alkylene group having from 2 to 4 carbon atoms<br>
and R5 is H or an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms;<br>
/<br>
a is 3 or 4 and each of b and c is, independently, 0 or an integer of<br>
from 1 to 125 provided that the sum b + c has a value in the range of from 10<br>
to 250, preferably from 10 to 120.<br>
According to the above, according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the polymeric material has a multiplicity of side chains, attached<br>
directly to carbon atoms of the carbon-carbon polymer backbone, having the<br>
(Figure Removed)where Q is as defined above.<br>
According to a different embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
polymeric material has a multiplicity of side chains, attached directly to the<br>
carbon atoms of the carbon-carbon polymer backbone, which side chains<br>
(Figure Removed)in which R1, R2 and R3 are as defined above. According to a preferred<br>
embodiment, the side chains have the above formula in which R1 is H, R3 is<br>
-CHs and R2 is the group -C(0)Q in which Q is as defined above. According<br>
to another preferred embodiment, the side chains have the above formula in<br>
which R3 is H and in which one of R1 and R2 is the group -C(O)Q and the<br>
other one of these groups is -C(O)OR4 in which R4 and Q are as defined<br>
above. The group Q, which is present in the side chains mentioned above,<br>
has the formula<br>
-0-(YO)b-(ZO)c-R5<br>
in which Y, Z, R5, b and c are as defined above.<br>
The polymeric material of the invention comprises, as described above,<br>
a hydrophobic carbon-carbon polymer backbone onto which are grafted a<br>
multiplicity of side chains which, because of their alkyleneoxy content, have a<br>
hydrophilic nature. The combination of a hydrophobic backbone with<br>
hydrophilic side chains grafted onto the backbone produces an amphiphilic<br>
species having properties which depend on the number of and the character<br>
of the side chains grafted onto the hydrophobic polymer backbone, i.e. as the<br>
number of alkyleneoxy groups in the polymeric material decreases, the<br>
hydrophobic character of the polymer backbone begins to dominate the bulk<br>
properties of the polymeric material whereas as the number of alkyleneoxy<br>
groups in the polymeric material increases, the polymeric material becomes<br>
increasingly hydrophilic. Furthermore, as the alkyleneoxy chain length in the<br>
grafted side chains increases, the bulk properties of the polymeric material<br>
tend to become more similar to those of the corresponding poly(alkylene)<br>
polymer. It is, therefore, possible, according to the present invention, to<br>
produce a polymeric material having the desired balance of elastomeric and<br>
hydrophilic properties. For this reason, multipliers b and c in the group Q<br>
defined above are each, independently, 0 to 125 provided that the sum of b +<br>
c lies within the range of from 10 to 250. Preferably b + c is in the range of<br>
from 10 to 120.<br>
It is not, of course, necessary in the present invention for all of the side<br>
chains to share the same values of b and c. It will be apparent that in the<br>
polymeric material of the invention different side chains grafted onto the<br>
carbon-carbon polymer backbone may have different values of b and of c<br>
provided that b lies within the range of 0 to 125 and c lies within the range of<br>
from 0 to 125 and provided that the sum of b + c lies within the range of from<br>
10 to 250. Preferably, in order to ensure that the side chains in the polymeric<br>
material confer a preferred degree of hydrophilicity to the polymeric material,<br>
and therefore a greater reduction in adhesiveness to surfaces, the value of<br>
the sum b + c in the side chains will be within the-range of 10 to 120, more<br>
preferably from 20 to 60, especially from 30 to 50 and most especially from 40<br>
to 45. Although adhesiveness or tack depends on the surface properties of<br>
the surface with which the polymeric material may become in intimate contact,<br>
it is most preferred in the present invention that the value of b + c is in the<br>
range of 40 to 45 so that the polymeric material exhibits reduced tack and<br>
reduced adhesiveness to a range of solid surfaces and, as a consequence, is<br>
more easily removable in the presence of water from a range of solid<br>
surfaces. As discussed above, the presence of poly(oxyalkylene) functionality<br>
in the side chains will confer a degree of hydrophilicity to the side chains. The<br>
alkylene groups Y and Z in the group Q defined above each, independently,<br>
contain 2 to 4 carbon atoms, and examples of such alkylene groups include<br>
ethylene, propylene, trimethylene and tetramethylene. However, since the<br>
hydrophobicity in the side chains increases with carbon content, it is preferred<br>
that both Y and Z are ethylene groups so that the presence of a multiplicity of<br>
side chains containing poly(oxyethylene) groups will have the effect of greatly<br>
increasing the hydrophilicity of the polymeric material compared to the<br>
hydrocarbon polymer containing no such side chains. The group R5 in Q, as<br>
defined above, is H or an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
Preferably, in order not to detract from the hydrophilic nature of the side<br>
chains, R5 will not be a group which, itself, introduces a significant degree of<br>
hydrophobicity to the side chain and, therefore, R5 is preferably H or -CHa,<br>
more preferably H.<br>
As stated above, the properties of the polymeric material depend not<br>
only on the character of the side chains grafted onto the carbon-carbon<br>
polymer backbone but also on the number of grafted side chains. It is<br>
essential according to the invention that a multiplicity of side chains are<br>
attached to the backbone. The term "multiplicity" as used herein is intended<br>
to have its normal definition, i.e. many, and, therefore, excludes compounds<br>
which contain one or only a few grafted side chains which would not be<br>
expected to have properties different from those of the hydrocarbon polymer<br>
from which the carbon-carbon polymer backbone is derived. The number of<br>
side chains grafted onto the carbon-carbon polymer backbone, according to<br>
the present invention, will typically be an average of at least one side chain on<br>
the carbon-carbon polymer backbone. The actual number of side chains<br>
grafted onto the carbon-carbon polymer backbone depends on the identity of<br>
the side chain and the method by which the side chain is grafted onto the<br>
polymer backbone (and the reaction conditions employed therein). In order to<br>
achieve a desired degree of hydrophilicity in the polymeric material, it is<br>
preferred that the average of the number of grafted side chains on the<br>
polymer backbone is in the range of 5 to 10, i.e. a ratio of backbone to side<br>
chains of from 1:5 to 1:10. It will be apparent that the side chains need not be<br>
located at regular intervals along the carbon-carbon polymer backbone since<br>
the location of attachment of the side chain on the backbone will depend on<br>
the positions of suitable attachment locations in the backbone of the<br>
hydrocarbon polymer used in the manufacture. For instance, if the<br>
hydrocarbon polymer is one that contains carbon-carbon double bonds in the<br>
polymer backbone, e.g. polyisoprene, these, or some of these, carbon-carbon<br>
double bonds can be utilised in the reaction by which the side chains may be<br>
attached to the backbone.<br>
A polymeric material according to the present invention having side<br>
chains, attached directly to carbon atoms in the carbon-carbon polymer<br>
backbone, wherein the side chains have the formula<br>
-CH2CH(CH3)-C(0)-0-(YO)b-(ZO)o-R5<br>
in which Y, Z, R5, b and c are as defined above may be prepared by a method<br>
which comprises reacting a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon polymer,<br>
in a solvent and in an inert atmosphere, with the monomethacrylate<br>
compound<br>
CH2=C(CH3)C(O)O-(YO)b-(ZO)cr-R5<br>
in the presence of a free radical initiator. The reaction between the<br>
hydrocarbon polymer and the methacrylate compound is carried out in a<br>
suitable solvent and, in this respect, a suitable solvent is one that is a solvent<br>
10<br>
for the reactants and for the free radical initiator used. Typically, the solvent<br>
will be an organic non-polar solvent, for example, toluene.<br>
Any free radical initiator may be used provided that it is soluble in the<br>
solvent being used and provided that it is able to abstract methylenic<br>
hydrogen atoms from the backbone of the hydrocarbon polymer to initiate the<br>
grafting reaction. Good results have been obtained using benzoyl peroxide as<br>
the free radical initiator in the present invention.<br>
To reduce the possibility of the polymer, in the reaction mixture,<br>
crosslinking with itself, it is preferred to carry out the method of the invention<br>
in a dilute solution. Typically, the hydrocarbon polymer and the<br>
monomethacrylate compound will each be used at a concentration which is<br>
less than 11 % w/w.<br>
The reaction is carried out in an inert atmosphere. Typically, this may<br>
be achieved by purging the reaction vessel containing the solution of the<br>
reactants and the initiator with nitrogen for several minutes. The reaction<br>
mixture is typically heated to a temperature above ambient temperature to<br>
accelerate the reaction and the reaction may be carried out for up to several<br>
days with stirring before completion is reached. Typically, the reaction is<br>
carried out at a temperature in the range of from 60Â° to 130Â°C, preferably 60Â°<br>
to 65Â°. The reaction may typically be carried out for a period of from 20 to 150<br>
hours. Preferably, it is carried out for a period of from 20 to 50 hours.<br>
Following this time, the reaction may be quenched by cooling the reaction<br>
vessel rapidly, for instance down to 0Â°C, or by rapidly diluting the reaction<br>
mixture with solvent.<br>
The resulting graft copolymer can be recovered by removing, by<br>
evaporating, part of the solvent and then adding methanol to cause<br>
precipitation of the desired graft copolymer. This precipitate, when collected,<br>
may typically be washed several times in methanol at 60Â°C and then dried<br>
under vacuum to remove any remaining solvent.<br>
A polymeric material according to the present invention wherein the<br>
side chains, attached directly to carbon atoms in the carbon-carbon polymer<br>
backbone, have the formula<br>
in which Y, Z, R5, a, b and c are as defined above, may be prepared by a<br>
method which comprises<br>
(i) reacting a compound of the formula<br>
HO-(YO)b-(ZO)c-R5<br>
with sodium hydride in a dry organic solvent under an inert<br>
atmosphere;<br>
(ii) reacting the product from step (i) with the compound<br>
CH2 = CHâ€”(CH2)q~Br ,<br>
where q is 1 or 2,<br>
to give the compound II<br>
CH2 = CH-(CH2)q-0-(YO)b-(ZO)c-R5 II<br>
(Hi) reacting the compound II with chlorodimethylsilane to give the<br>
(Figure Removed) (iv) reducing compound III and reacting the product a-hydrodimethylsilyl<br>
polyalkylene oxide with a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon<br>
polymer containing a multiplicity of carbon-carbon double bonds in the<br>
hydrocarbon polymer backbone in the presence of at transition metal<br>
salt.<br>
12<br>
Preferably, in step (li) above, the product from step (i) is reacted with 3-<br>
bromopropene such that, in the formula given above for the side chain, a is 3.<br>
It will be apparent that a hydrosilylation reaction, as described above<br>
(step iv), involves the addition of silane compounds across carbon-carbon<br>
double bonds in the hydrocarbon polymer. Hydrosilylation reactions are, in<br>
general, catalysed by transition metals or salts thereof, especially those which<br>
form electron-rich complexes, for example, Pt(O), Pd(O), Rh(l), Ni(O) and<br>
Co(l). We have achieved good results using chloroplatinic acid (HaPtCle) as<br>
catalyst in this reaction.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, in step (i) above, sodium hydride<br>
is added to a solution, in an organic solvent such as toluene or<br>
tetrahydrofuran, and in the absence of water, of poly(ethylene oxide)<br>
monomethyl ether under an inert atmosphere, such as argon, at room<br>
temperature. After heating the solution, typically with stirring and typically at<br>
about 60Â°C for about 12 hours, ally! bromide is added and the reaction<br>
continued for up to 2 days. The reaction between the <x-allyl-u></x-allyl-u>
(ethylene oxide) and chlorodimethylsilane may then be carried out in toluene<br>
solution in the presence of chloroplatinic acid for several hours at about 60Â°C<br>
and the product then reduced, using LiAIH4. The hydrosilylation reaction is<br>
then carried out as described above preferably using polyisoprene as the<br>
hydrocarbon polymer containing a multiplicity of carbon-carbon double bonds.<br>
Because the method described above relies on addition across a<br>
carbon-carbon double bond, it is possible, by choosing an unsaturated<br>
hydrocarbon polymer containing a desired amount of unsaturation, to obtain a<br>
polymeric material having a predetermined number of side chains attached to<br>
the polymer backbone.<br>
A polymeric material according to the present invention wherein the<br>
side chains, attached directly to carbon atoms in the carbon-carbon polymer<br>
backbone, have the formula <br>
ove, may be made by a method which comprises<br>
reacting polyisoprene-graff-maleic anhydride or a monoester derivative<br>
thereof with the compound HO-(YO)b-(ZO)cr-R5, in which Y, Z, R5, b and c<br>
are as defined above. Typically, the reaction is carried out in an organic<br>
solvent such as toluene.<br>
In the method described above, the number of side chains attached to<br>
the polymer backbone will depend on the number of maleic anhydride grafts<br>
on the polyisoprene molecule which can take part in the esterification reaction<br>
with the alcohol HO-(YO)b-(ZO)c-R5. For instance, using a polyisoprene-gmaleic<br>
anhydride of the formula<br>
the number of side chains having the general formula given above that can be<br>
formed will obviously depend on the value of y. Polyisoprene-graff-maleic<br>
anhydride (PIP-g-MA) is available commercially. One such PIP-g-MA, having<br>
the CAS No. 139948-75-7, available from the company, Aldrich, has an<br>
average molecular weight of about 25,000, a Brookfield Viscosity of 10-50 cP<br>
(as a 20 wt% solution in toluene) at 30Â°C and a density of 0.92 g/mL (at<br>
25Â°C). The monomer ratio of isoprene units to maleic anhydride units in this<br>
graft copolymer is 98:2 which indicates that the reaction between this PlP-g-<br>
MA and the alcohol described above could produce about 7 side chains per<br>
molecule. Polyisoprene-graff-maleic anhydride may be prepared according<br>
to techniques described in the literature. For instance, according to Visonte<br>
L.L.Y. et al, Polymers for Advanced Technologies, Vol 4, 1993, pp 490-495,<br>
polyisoprene, dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene, was reacted with maleic<br>
anhydride at 180Â°-190Â°C to give the modified isoprene. Various polyisoprene14<br>
g-maleic anhydride copolymers with 7, 15, 19, 26 and 29 mol% maleic<br>
anhydride were obtained by increasing the reaction time from 5 to 1 1 hours.<br>
The reaction between the PIP-g-MA and the poly(alkyleneoxy) alcohol<br>
is typically carried out in an organic solvent such as toluene and typically in<br>
the presence of an activator, for example, triethylemine at elevated<br>
temperature. The yield of the ester, in this reaction, may be increased by<br>
removal of the water from the reaction mixture by azeotropic distillation since<br>
toluene and water form azeotropic mixtures which boil at a lower temperature<br>
than any of the components. The poly(alkyleneoxy) alcohol may also be<br>
reacted with a monoester derivative of PIP-g-MA. For instance, we have<br>
achieved good results using a carboxylated pojyisoprene available from the<br>
company, Kuraray Co. Ltd., as LIR-410. This carboxylated polyisoprene has<br>
the general(Figure Removed)<br>
and has a functionality of 10, a molecular weight of about 25,000, a melt<br>
viscosity of 180 Pa s at 38Â°C, specific gravity of 0.92 g/cc and a glass<br>
transition temperature of -59Â°C. The reaction of LIR-410 with the alcohol is<br>
typically carried out in an organic solvent such as toluene at an elevated<br>
temperature. As described above in the case of the reaction using PIP-g-MA,<br>
the yield of ester may be increased by removing water from the reaction<br>
mixture by azeotropic distillation, these methods, although they require the<br>
use of preformed polyisoprene having carboxy functionality, have the<br>
advantage that they involve relatively simple and quick reaction and give high<br>
yields.<br>
In view of the low tack property of the polymeric material of the<br>
invention, it is possible to make a chewing gum composition which has<br>
reduced adhesion to surfaces and which, therefore, is more easily removed<br>
15<br>
from surfaces to which it is adhered, by incorporating the polymeric material of<br>
the invention in the chewing gum composition. According to a further aspect,<br>
therefore, the present invention provides a chewing gum composition<br>
exhibiting reduced adhesion to surfaces comprising a water-insoluble gum<br>
base in an amount sufficient to form a chewable gum composition and a<br>
sweetening agent, wherein at least part of the water-insoluble gum base<br>
comprises a polymeric material as described herein above.<br>
Chewing gum compositions generally comprise a water-soluble portion<br>
and a water-insoluble chewable gum base portion. The water-soluble portion<br>
of the composition typically contains components such as one or more<br>
sweeteners, flavouring agents, colouring agents, acidulants and fillers and<br>
may additionally contain other substances such as stabilisers and/or<br>
antioxidants. The water-insoluble gum base portion of the composition<br>
typically contains, in addition to the one or more elastomers responsible for<br>
the chewability characteristic of the chewing gum, elastomer plasticizers, oils<br>
and water-insoluble fillers.<br>
Elastomers which are suitable for providing the chewability<br>
characteristic of chewing gum compositions are well known in the art. These<br>
include, but are not limited to, natural rubber, natural chewable gums and<br>
synthetic elastomeric polymers such as polybutadiene, polyisoprene,<br>
butadiene-styrene copolymers, polyisobutylene and isobutylene-isoprene<br>
copolymers. In the chewing gum composition of the present invention, at<br>
least a portion of the elastomer in the composition is replaced by the<br>
polymeric material described above, preferably, one having elastomeric<br>
properties. Typically, the polymeric material of the present invention will form<br>
at least 1% by weight, preferably at least 10% by weight, more preferably at<br>
least 50% by weight, of the elastomer component in the chewing gum<br>
composition. It is, further, within the scope of the invention to use the<br>
polymeric material of the invention as a total replacement for the elastomer<br>
component in chewing gum.<br>
The gum base of the chewing gum composition may, as is known in<br>
the art, contain one or more plasticizers to soften the elastomer component in<br>
16<br>
the composition to ensure the required level of chewability and a desirable<br>
mouth feel of the chewing gum. Plasticizers that are conventionally used to<br>
modify the properties of the elastomer in chewing gum compositions include<br>
natural rosin esters. Examples of natural rosin esters that may be used<br>
include glycerol esters of rosin or hydrogenated rosin and pentaerythritol<br>
esters of rosin or hydrogenated rosin. Such materials may be used, as is<br>
conventional in the art, in an amount of up to about 70% by weight of the gum<br>
base. It is also possible to incorporate into the chewing gum composition one<br>
or more other materials that are conventionally used to soften or modify the<br>
physical properties of the composition such as glycerol, lecithin and glyceryl<br>
monostearate. Such materials, if used, will be incorporated into the<br>
composition in an amount which typically may be up to about 15% by weight<br>
of the chewing gum composition.<br>
It is conventional to incorporate one or more sweeteners into the<br>
chewing gum composition. The amount of sweetening agent used will, of<br>
course, depend on the level of sweetness desired in the final product and the<br>
sweetness of the sweetener being used. For instance, artificial sweeteners<br>
such as aspartame may be used. Sweetness may, of course, be provided by<br>
sweeteners which contribute, in addition to sweetness, bulk to the final<br>
composition. Examples of bulk sweeteners which are conventionally used in<br>
the manufacture of chewing gum include saccharides, such as sucrose,<br>
dextrose, xylose, and starch hydrolysates, such as corn syrup, and also nonsaccharides,<br>
such as the polyols sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol and hydrogenated<br>
starch hydrolysates. Bulk sweeteners may be used in an amount of up to<br>
80% by weight of the chewing gum composition and, more typically, in an<br>
amount of from about 20 to about 70% by weight.<br>
The chewing gum composition of the present invention will, typically,<br>
contain one or more other ingredients which are conventional in the art such<br>
as fillers, flavouring agents, waxes, colouring agents, gums, stabilisers,<br>
emulsifiers and antioxidants. Such materials may be used in the present<br>
invention in accordance with procedures well known in the art of chewing gum<br>
manufacture.<br>
The chewing gum composition of the invention may be manufactured<br>
according to known techniques. For instance, the method of manufacture will<br>
generally comprise heating the ingredients of the gum base together in a<br>
mixer to melt the elastomer portion of the gum base and to form a<br>
homogeneous mixture of the gum base components. The melted gum base is<br>
then mixed with the other components and after these have been thoroughly<br>
mixed the resulting mass may be discharged from the mixer and shaped into<br>
the desired form, such as by rolling into sheets and cut to the desired size or<br>
by casting into pellets. The gum may then be sprinkled with powdered sugar<br>
or candy coated according to techniques known to the skilled person.<br>
Example 1<br>
To 100ml of toluene in a round bottom flask were added 0.434g (1.14 x<br>
10~5 moles) of polyisoprene having a molecular weight of 38000 and a<br>
microstructure 98.8% cis -1,4 and 1.006g (5.03 x 10"4 moles) of methoxy poly<br>
(ethylene glycol) monomethacrylate having a molecular weight of 2000. The<br>
amounts of the reactants used conformed to a ratio of polyisoprene to poly<br>
(ethylene glycol) of 1:2.<br>
The mixture was stirred, using a magnetic stirrer, for 2 minutes at 25Â°<br>
to 30Â°C until the polyisoprene had dissolved. Benzoyl peroxide (0.025g; 1..03<br>
x 10"4 moles) was added and the reaction vessel was purged with Na for 5<br>
minutes to provide an inert atmosphere. The vessel was heated to 60Â°C and<br>
maintained at this temperature, with stirring, for 48.5 hours.<br>
At completion, the reaction mixture was cooled rapidly to 0Â°C and 85-<br>
90% of the toluene was evaporated off under vacuum. Methanol was added<br>
to the remaining mixture and a colloidal solution was formed immediately<br>
whereby the product was suspended. (The product polymeric material<br>
comprised a polymer backbone, derived from polyisoprene, having grafted<br>
onto it a plurality of side chains having the formula<br>
-CH2CH(CH3)C(O)O(CH2CH2O)nCH3).<br>
The graft copolymer suspension was centrifuged to recover the solid product<br>
and this was then washed in methanol at 60Â°C (three times) and dried under<br>
18<br>
vacuum. The 1H NMR spectrum of the product is shown in Figure 1. The<br>
NMR spectrum was obtained using a 400 MHz Bruker DSX NMR<br>
spectrophotometer operating at 400.14 MHz with a solid state probe (HP WB<br>
73A MAS 4BL CP VTN) inserted. A single pulse was used to measure the<br>
spectrum where the number of scans was 8, the 90Â° pulse time was 3 msec,<br>
db was 2, the recycling delay was 2 seconds and 6144 data points were<br>
collected. Spectra were recorded for spinning speeds of 0, 5 and 9.6 kHz.<br>
The NMR spectrum shown in Figure 1 includes an intense signal at 3.41 ppm.<br>
This is believed to be due to the presence of methanol contamination in the<br>
sample tested and should, therefore, be ignored. From this 1H NMR spectrum<br>
and the 1H NMR spectra obtained for polyisoprene and for poly(ethylene<br>
glycol) according to which integration values could be obtained, it was<br>
possible to calculate the average number of side chains (having a molecular<br>
weight of about 2000) per polyisoprene-derived backbone (having a molecular<br>
weight of about 38000) as 8.4.<br>
Test Procedures<br>
A. Swelling in methanol<br>
Poly(ethylene glycol) is hydrophilic and, therefore, does not have good<br>
solubility in organic solvents. It was, therefore, decided to investigate the<br>
effect of a polar solvent (methanol) on polyisoprene and on the polymeric<br>
product obtained in Example 1 above.<br>
0.5g of polyisoprene was placed in a vial to which was then added 5ml<br>
methanol (test 1).<br>
0.5g of the graft copolymer obtained in Example 1 above was placed in<br>
a second vial to which was then added 5ml methanol (test 2).<br>
Following the methanol addition in test 1, the polyisoprene exhibited no<br>
swelling with the methanol remaining colourless.<br>
Following the methanol addition in test 2, the graft copolymer swelled<br>
substantially to the point whereby the polymer chains formed a semi<br>
transparent colloidal suspension.<br>
Example 2<br>
Reaction of Dolvisoprene-araft-maleic anhydride and polvfethvlene alvcol)<br>
methvl ether with triethvlamine catalyst<br>
In this Example, poly(ethylene glycol) was reacted with a polyisoprenegraff-<br>
maleic anhydride (PIP-g-MA) available from the company Aldrich. This<br>
PIP-g-MA, which has the general formula<br>
CH3 CH3<br>
[â€” CH2â€” C =<br>
has the CAS No. 139948-75-7 and has an average Mw of approximately<br>
25,000, a Brookfield viscosity of 10-50 cP (as a 20 wt% solution in toluene) at<br>
30Â°C and a density of 0.92 g/mL (at 25Â°C). The monomer ratio of isoprene<br>
units to grafted maleic anhydride units is 98:2.<br>
Polyisoprene-graff-maleic anhydride (PIP-g-MA) (Aldrich), 10g, was<br>
dissolved in 50ml toluene in a reaction flask, and 2ml triethylamine catalyst<br>
was added and a magnetic stirrer was inserted. Poly(ethylene glycol), 6g,<br>
was then added and an additional 50ml toluene was added to dissolve it.<br>
Once everything had dissolved, the reaction mixture was heated to 85Â°C and<br>
left for 7 days at this temperature.<br>
The reaction mixture was subsequently cooled to room temperature<br>
and then added to 800ml pentane in a beaker. A white suspension formed<br>
and the reaction mixture was left in the fridge overnight (cooled to 8Â°C for 24<br>
hours). A phase separation resulted and a white precipitate lingered at the<br>
bottom of the beaker while a translucent top phase hung above. Clearly some<br>
of the product was soluble in pentane while some of the product was not. (It<br>
is believed that as the grafting efficiency increases, the increase in the<br>
number of side chains attached to the polymer backbone causes the resulting<br>
polymer to become less soluble in pentane, hence making a spectrum of<br>
products some of which are soluble in pentane and some of which are not<br>
soluble in pentane and thus precipitate out of solution and sediment at the<br>
bottom).<br>
The phases were carefully separated and concentrated for analysis.<br>
Concentration took place by evaporating any excess pentane from both<br>
samples under high vacuum.<br>
Example 3<br>
Reaction of Dolvisoorene-araft-maleic anhydride with oolvfethvlene alvcol)<br>
methyl ether via azeotropic distillation<br>
Polyisoprene-graft-maleic anhydride (PIP-g-MA), as used in Example<br>
2, 20g, and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether (PEGME) (also purchased from<br>
Aldrich), 12g, having an average molecular weight of 2000 were weighed out<br>
and added to a round bottom flask. Toluene, 200ml, was then added to the<br>
flask and the mixture was stirred by a magnetic stirrer.<br>
Using a Dean Stark trap, the reaction flask was heated at 120Â°C for<br>
two hours, in order to dry the polyethylene glycol) methyl ether by means of<br>
azeotropic distillation. The reaction temperature was then increased to 130Â°C<br>
and heating was continued at that temperature for two hours. After the<br>
heating step, 20ml of liquid distilled off were cloudy, indicating an azeotrope of<br>
toluene and water. A further 40ml liquid were distilled off but this was clear,<br>
Indicating that all water had been removed.<br>
The reaction was then purged with nitrogen and given 24 hours to<br>
progress.<br>
The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and then<br>
precipitated in 1200ml pentane making the mixture a cloudy emulsion. The<br>
emulsion was put into the fridge (8Â°C for 24 hours) allowing the insoluble<br>
species to sediment.<br>
The resultant two phases, a soluble upper layer and an insoluble<br>
sediment, were separated. The soluble pentane fraction was concentrated in<br>
a rotary evaporator. The insoluble sediment was vacuum dried, dissolved in<br>
chloroform and precipitated in methanol (800ml) in order to dissolve any<br>
excess PEGME. Again, two phases resulted but separation proved difficult as<br>
the new modified hydrophilic polymer formed a colloid in methanol. In order<br>
to separate the colloidal polymer from the solvent with excess PEGME, it was<br>
necessary to centrifuge the mixture for 45 minutes at 15,000 rpm three times.<br>
The white product collected from the bottom of the centrifuge tubes was then<br>
dried.<br>
Because the methanol eluent was suspected to contain some polymer,<br>
that too was concentrated in the rotary evaporator and dissolved in<br>
chloroform. In order to remove any excess PEGME, the solution was<br>
precipitated in diethyl ether and dried.<br>
Example 4<br>
Reaction of Dolvisoprene-araft-maleic anhydride with polvfethvlene glvcol)<br>
methvl ether via azeotropic distillation<br>
Polyisoprene-graft-maleic anhydride (PIP-g-MA), as used in Example<br>
2, 262g, and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether (PEGME) (also purchased<br>
from Aldrich), 200g, having an average molecular weight of 2000 were<br>
weighed out and added to a three litre round bottom flask fitted with a<br>
magnetic stirrer. Prior to this, calcium hydride was added to toluene to<br>
remove water from toluene and, after being filtered, 700ml of this slightly dried<br>
toluene was added to the round bottom flask to dissolve the starting materials.<br>
Using a Dean Stark trap, the reaction flask was heated to 120Â°C, in<br>
order to remove any water from the poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether and<br>
from the toluene by means of azeotropic distillation. The reaction<br>
temperature was increased to 130Â°C and heated at that temperature for two<br>
hours (removing 50ml liquid). Once its unique constant boiling point was<br>
reached, the azeotrope (toluene and water) vaporized and condensed as a<br>
foggy liquid. Once the liquid which was condensing was clear, all water had<br>
been removed and only toluene was evaporating.<br>
The reaction was left for 24 hours at 120Â°C and then heated at 130Â°C<br>
for two hours before removing more solvent by azeotropic distillation. The<br>
reaction was left for 48 hours.<br>
Next, the reaction was cooled to room temperature and precipitated in<br>
methanol (4L). The product was then dried in an oven under high vacuum for<br>
72 hours to remove methanol after which it was washed with excess water<br>
(4L) and dried in an oven under vacuum for 72 hours. The 1H NMR spectrum<br>
of this product is shown in Figure 2. The 1H NMR spectrum was obtained<br>
using a Delta/GX 400 NMR spectrophotometer, operating at 400 MHz, in<br>
CDCI3 (deuterated chloroform). The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the<br>
product was found to be approximately 50Â°C using a Netzsch Simultaneous<br>
Thermal Analysis STA-409 EP.<br>
Example 5<br>
Reaction of Liquid Isoorene Rubber (LIR-410) with polvfethvlene alvcol)<br>
methyl ether via azeotrooic distillation<br>
In this Example, poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether was reacted with a<br>
carboxylated liquid polyisoprene available from the company Kuraray Co. Ltd.<br>
as LIR-410. This carboxylated polyisoprene has the general formula<br>
(Figure Removed)and has a functionality of 10 (i.e. 10 carboxylic acid groups per molecule), a<br>
molecular weight of approx. 25,000, a melt viscosity of 180 Pa s at 38Â°C, a<br>
specific gravity of 0.92 g/cc and a glass transition temperature of -59Â°C.<br>
Carboxylated polyisoprene LIR-410, 320g, was weighed into a beaker<br>
and was dissolved in 850ml toluene which had been previously slightly dried<br>
using calcium hydride as described in Example 4. The toluene solution was<br>
placed in a three litre round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and<br>
23<br>
to this were added 260g polyethylene glycol) methyl ether (PEGME) (Aldrich)<br>
having an average molecular weight of 2000 with stirring until dissolved.<br>
Using a Dean Stark trap, the reaction flask was heated to 130Â°C and<br>
heating was continued for two hours to remove water from the PEGME and<br>
from the toluene by azeotropic distillation after which 80ml solvent was<br>
removed. The reaction mixture was then left for 24 hours at 120Â°C. The<br>
azeotropic distillation cycle (heating for two hours at 130Â°C followed by 24<br>
hours at 120Â°C) was repeated three times over the following three days and<br>
then the reaction mixture was heated at 130Â°C for azeotropic distillation for 5<br>
hours, removing 120ml solvent. As the azeotropic distillation cycle<br>
progressed the viscosity of the reaction mixture increased such that it was no<br>
longer possible to rotate the magnetic stirrer. The reaction mixture was then<br>
cooled to room temperature and washed with water three times using a<br>
Buchner funnel. The washed product was then dried in an oven under high<br>
vacuum for 72 hours. The glass transition temperature (Tg) was found to be<br>
approximately 50Â°C using the thermal analysis procedure given in Example 4.<br>
Example 6<br>
Hvdrosilvlation of polvisoprene with functionalized polvfethvlene alvcol)<br>
methyl ether<br>
The polyisoprene used in this Example had an average molecular<br>
weight of 40,000 (Aldrich). The poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether (Aldrich)<br>
had an average molecular weight of 2000.<br>
Poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether (60g) was weighed into a reaction<br>
flask and heated to 90Â°C under high vacuum. To this was added 1.75g NaH<br>
dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and the reaction was allowed to continue for 6-8<br>
hours at 50Â°C. Allyl bromide (8g) was then added to the reaction flask and<br>
allowed to react for 20 hours. The reaction mixture was heated, under<br>
vacuum, to remove the solvent and the product was then washed with<br>
benzene. To 30g of the product, dried under high vacuum and dissolved in<br>
40ml dry toluene in a round bottom flask, were added H2PtCle (0.3g),<br>
dissolved in 4ml tetrahydrofuran, and chlorodimethylsilane (24ml) and the<br>
mixture was allowed to react for 24 hours. The reaction mixture was heated<br>
to 90Â°C under high vacuum. Then, dry toluene (45ml) was added to' the<br>
reaction flask followed by LiAIH4 (5g) and the mixture was.allowed to react for<br>
72 hours. After this, the mixture was filtered using benzene to wash and the<br>
filtrate was collected. The filtrate was rotary evaporated and then added to<br>
pentane to give a precipitate. The precipitate was collected by filtration and<br>
dried in a rotary evaporator.<br>
The dry product (8g) and polyisoprene (5g) were dissolved in benzene<br>
(50ml) in a reaction flask. To this was then added HzPtCle (0.175g) dissolved<br>
in 1ml tetrahydrofuran, the reaction mixture was heated to 50Â°C and the<br>
reaction was allowed to proceed at this temperature for 48 hours and then<br>
allowed to cool to room temperature. After this, the reaction mixture was<br>
dissolved in dichloromethane (200ml) and filtered through an alumina column<br>
containing 50g A^Os twice and washed twice with dichloromethane. The<br>
filtrate was collected and then rotary evaporated and then added to pentane<br>
causing the formation of a precipitate. The pentane mixture containing the<br>
precipitate was filtered and both the filtered off precipitate and the eluent were<br>
collected. The collected precipitate was dried and washed with methanol,<br>
forming a cloudy solution. The cloudy solution was centrifuged for 30 minutes<br>
at 15,000 rpm and the insoluble product collected and dried. The 1H NMR<br>
spectrum of the product is shown in Figure 3. The 1H NMR spectrum was<br>
obtained using a Delta/GX 400 NMR spectrophotometer, operating at 400<br>
MHz, in CDCIa (deuterated chloroform). It was calculated that the average<br>
number of side chains grafted onto each polyisoprene backbone is 145. This<br>
insoluble product consisted of isoprene onto which had been grafted side<br>
The number of grafted side chains was sufficient to deprive the product of its<br>
organic solubility. The eluent collected from the above filtration was<br>
(Figure Removed)concentrated by rotary evaporation. The product that was dissolved in the<br>
pentane was considered to consist of isoprene having insufficient grafted side<br>
chains such that organic solubility was retained.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL<br>
1. Probe Tack Test<br>
Samples of the polymeric materials obtained in Example 4 (REV-7) and<br>
in Example 5 (REV-10) were subjected to probe tack tests. For comparison,<br>
samples of polyisoprene (PIP) having a Mw of 40,000, polyisoprene-gr-maleic<br>
anhydride (starting material in Example 4) (PIP-g-MA) and LIR-410 (starting<br>
material in Example 5) were also subjected to the same test procedure.<br>
The samples were prepared for use as follows. In each case, one<br>
gram of sample was dissolved in chloroform and the solution was deposited<br>
evenly over the surface of a rectangular glass microscope slide of dimensions<br>
2.5 cm x 7.5 cm. Following evaporation of the solvent, a film of polymeric<br>
material having a uniform thickness of about 0.5 mm remained on the surface<br>
of the glass slide.<br>
The probe tack test is a simple procedure for measuring tack.<br>
According to the test procedure, a standard stainless steel probe having a<br>
circular contact area of diameter 5mm is brought into contact with the film of<br>
the sample deposited on the glass slide (which is held strongly in place)<br>
under low contact force (100g/cm2) for a short contact time (10 s) and is then<br>
pulled away at a constant speed (1 cm/s). The maximum force of separation<br>
is measured. The apparatus used in these experiments was a probe tack<br>
tester Model No. 80-02 (Testing Machines, Inc.) and the experiments were<br>
carried out at room temperature. The maximum force of separation was<br>
measured in grams and, subsequently, converted to Newtons. The results<br>
obtained are shown in the following table.<br>
(Figure Removed)eneral trend in tack for the starting materials tested is LIR-410&gt;<br>
PIP-gr-MA&gt; PIP. In comparison with these, the modified polymers (REV-7 and<br>
REV-10) show a significant decrease in tack. The glass transition<br>
temperatures of the modified polymers are substantially higher than those of<br>
the starting materials, as a result of the grafted side chains. The starting<br>
materials were all in the liquid- phase, with a Tg well below room temperature<br>
(around -60Â°C) allowing facility in wetting the probe. The solid modified<br>
polymers (REV-7 and REV-10) were also less sticky as a result of their<br>
inability to do so.<br>
The average force of separation, for each material, as indicated in the<br>
table above is shown in the bar chart in Figure 4. Maximum errors are also<br>
shown.<br>
27<br>
The reproducibility of this experiment is confined by the inaccuracy of<br>
certain parameters, such as the contact area between the probe and the<br>
sample films and the actual temperature of the samples. However, from a<br>
qualitative analysis of the results obtained, it is clear that the reduced<br>
adhesion demonstrated by REV-7 and REV-10 at room temperature is a<br>
consequence of the side chains attached to the backbone of the polymer.<br>
2. LOOP tack test<br>
Samples of the polymeric materials obtained in Example 4 (REV-7) and<br>
in Example 5 (REV-10) were subjected to loop tack tests. For comparison,<br>
samples of polyisoprene (PIP) having an average molecular weight of 40,000<br>
(obtained from Aldrich), polyisoprene-g-maleic anhydride (starting material in<br>
Example 4) and LIR-410 (starting material in Example 5) were also subjected<br>
to the same test procedure.<br>
The samples were prepared for use as follows. In each case, one<br>
gram of sample was dissolved in trichloromethane and the solution was<br>
deposited evenly over the surface of a rectangular glass microscope slide of<br>
dimensions 2.5 cm x 7.5 cm. Following evaporation of the solvent, a film of<br>
polymeric material having a uniform thickness of about 0.5 mm remained on<br>
the surface of the glass slide.<br>
In all cases, the apparatus was set up as follows:-<br>
1) a length of flexible tape having a constant width of 25mm was formed<br>
into a loop by bringing its free ends together and then the free ends<br>
were clamped in grips on the test machine which were connected to a<br>
load measuring device;<br>
2) the loop, suspended vertically beneath the clamped tape ends, was<br>
aligned with, though held above, the glass slide (fixed in the test<br>
machine) coated with the film of sample.<br>
The tests were carried out, at room temperature, as follows:-<br>
i) the loop is lowered, at a constant rate of 300 mm/min, so that it<br>
contacts the sample film on the base plate, until the maximum contact<br>
area between the looped tape and the sample film (25mm x'25mm) is<br>
achieved;<br>
28<br>
ii) after a period of one second in contact with the maximum area of the<br>
sample film, the loop is pulled away from the sample film at the same<br>
constant rate (300 mm/min) and the maximum force of separate (in N)<br>
is measured by the apparatus; and<br>
iii) the loop is then lowered again, at the same constant rate as in i)<br>
above, to again contact the maximum area of the sample film for one<br>
second and is then pulled away again, at the same constant rate as in<br>
i) above, to provide a second measurement of the maximum separation<br>
force (in N) between the contact surface of the loop and the sample<br>
under test.<br>
The sample film and the loop were then replaced. For each sample,<br>
this testing procedure was carried out five times.<br>
Thus, according to the test procedure, each sample film and each loop<br>
had two separation force measurements taken from them: the first being after<br>
the loop and sample film had been brought into contact for the first time and<br>
the second being after the second contact between the loop and the sample<br>
film.<br>
The following results were recorded for each of the five films under<br>
test. (Note that "1" in the "Contact" column is the measurement taken after<br>
the first contact between the loop and the sample film and "2" in the "Contact"<br>
column is the measurement taken after the second contact of the loop and the<br>
(Figure Removed)The average values of the maximum force of separation are plotted for<br>
the different polymers and their standard deviation is shown as an error bar in<br>
Fig. 5. Again, the most striking feature is the lack of tack for REV-10. Its<br>
values do not exceed 0.02 N and this is the same value when the loop is<br>
brought into contact with any non-adhesive surface, i.e. the material neither<br>
wets the probe nor provides any resistance when pulled in the opposite<br>
direction.<br>
In the loop tack tests, the general trend shown for the starting materials<br>
is the same as previously shown in the probe tack tests, i.e. LIR-410 &gt;PIP-g&gt;<br>
MA &gt;PIP. It is clear, from the loop tack test results, that the introduction of<br>
side chains (as defined above), attached to the polymer backbone of<br>
polyisoprene, has the consequence of reducing tack.<br>
3. Solubility Tests<br>
The solubilities of the polymeric materials obtained in Example 4 (REV-<br>
7) and in Example 5 (REV-10) in various solvents (water, toluene, chloroform,<br>
pentane and methanol) were assessed. For comparison, the solubilities, in<br>
the same solvents, of samples of polyisoprene (PIP) having a Mw of 40,000,<br>
polyisoprene-g-maleic anhydride (starting material in Example 4) (PIP-g-MA),<br>
LIR-410 (starting material in Example 5) and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl<br>
31<br>
ether (starting material in Examples 4 and 5) (PEGME) were also subjected to<br>
the same test procedure.<br>
In each case, one gram of the sample under test was weighed into a<br>
20ml glass vial and solvent was added. The mixture of sample and solvent<br>
was shaken vigorously and then placed in an ultrasonic bath for 30 minutes.<br>
The mixture was then, again, shaken vigorously and the appearance of the<br>
contents of the vial, i.e. whether a clear solution was obtained or not, was<br>
observed and recorded. The results are shown in the following table. In the<br>
table, 'NO1 indicates no dissolution of the sample in the solvent was observed<br>
and 'YES' indicates that the sample dissolved in the solvent.<br>
(Table Removed)1. PIP, PIP-g-MA and LIR-410 all behave in the same way for each<br>
solvent;<br>
2. PEGME behaves in an opposite way to PIP, PIP-g-MA and LIR-410 in<br>
water, pentane and methanol;<br>
3. Toluene and chloroform dissolve all samples (starting materials and<br>
products);<br>
4. REV-7 and REV-10 exhibit increased hydrophilic'rty (compared to the<br>
starting materials) in water due to the presence of the hydrophilic side<br>
chains in the molecules;<br>
32<br>
5. REV-7 and REV-10 exhibit relative difficulty in dissolving in pentane,<br>
indicating that they behave differently from the isoprene polymers from<br>
which they are derived and that they are possibly forming colloidal<br>
dispersions;<br>
6. The ability of REV-7 and REV-10 to dissolve, at least partially, or to<br>
form colloids, in methanol reveals an affinity of these modified<br>
polymers for polar solvents as a result of the presence of the<br>
hydrophilic side chains in the molecules.<br>
4. Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS)<br>
The SANS measurements were performed on D22 at the ILL,<br>
Grenoble, France, using 2 mm path length quartz Hellma cells equilibrated at<br>
298 K. Cold neutrons of 8 A were used. The detector distance was 17.5 m<br>
and the collimation distance was 17.6 m. The Q-resolution with this set-up is<br>
10% (AQ/Q). The resultant Q range extended from 0.002 to 0.035 A"1. The<br>
measuring time was chosen to give 1 million counts for good statistics.<br>
The investigated samples consisted of 5% solutions of graft<br>
copolymers in partially deuterated methanol (CHaOD). The scattering data<br>
were analyzed using the Guinier Debye model using the following equation<br>
(Debye P. J. Phys. Coll. Chem. (1947) 51,18)<br>
/(Q) = A/7^pM(2(e-(Q2R|&gt; + Q2R* -1)) /(NApQ*R4<br>
G)<br>
where 4% is the difference in scattering length density of the polymer and<br>
solvent, 
Avogadro's number p is the physical density, Q is the momentum transfer<br>
vector and RG is the radius of gyration.<br>
The effective radius of gyration for RevIO in methanol from the fit<br>
shown in Figure 6 is 673 Â± 15A. A similar analysis for Rev7 (Figure 7) gave<br>
408 Â±13 A. The sizes are an indication of the colloidal nature of these<br>
dispersions.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
