				<td>Acid-resistant, hydraulically setting masses<br>
<br>
The invention relates to acid-resistant, hydraulically setting compositions, a process for producing them and also their use.<br>
<br>
Although metal corrosion in wastewater plants has been looked at for a long time, the importance of corrosion on concrete or mortars has attracted attention only in recent years. Corrosion damage, in particular corrosion damage caused by microbial metabolism of sulfur compounds, are among the more frequently occurring types of damage in wastewater conduits; in addition, there is damage to pumping stations and in wastewater purification plants (treatment plants). The corrosive destruction of concrete or mortar surfaces due to biologically generated (biogenic) sulfuric acid is also observed in biogas plants. The sulfuric acid is formed as metabolite by bacteria of the Thiobacillus type living in the aerobic region of wastewater plants or biogas plants. Cement-based materials and lime-containing aggregates are attacked (dissolving and swelling attack) by the sulfuric acid. The effects are considerable: the corrosion rate is, depending on conditions, reported as 6-10 mm/year. The result is a typical washed concrete surface of the damaged concrete (exposure of the rock particles).<br>
<br>
It is known from the prior art that the acid resistance of concrete can be improved by combining cements with pozzolanic additives: JP 2002160960 A2 describes a hydraulically setting composition comprising high-alumina cement with pozzolanic additives such as fly ash. Compositions comprising cement and a fine pozzolanic powder are described in JP 2003055019 A2. JP 2006327868 A2 describes compositions comprising high-alumina cement, slag sand and a shrinkage-reducing additive. JP 2006-225221 A2 relates to mortar compositions comprising calcium aluminate cement, pozzolanas and iron-free slag sand, optionally mixed with polymer dispersions or fibers. JP 2006/044958 A2 describes an acid-resistant mortar comprising high-alumina cement, slag sand, polymer dispersion and shrinkage-reducing additive. A mortar composition comprising portland cement, slag sand, a further inorganic binder, acrylate or styrene-butadiene polymer is known from KR 20040089995 A. EP 1614670 A2 relates to cement-based mortar systems based on portland cement clinker, calcium aluminate cement and additives from the group of pozzolanas and latent hydraulic materials. A similar composition comprising portland cement, pozzolana, latent hydraulic binder such as slag sand, with polymer dispersion, water-soluble polymer or expanded clay being able to be added, is described by JP 2007001802 A2.<br>
<br>
Although these systems display rapid setting behavior due to the presence of cement, the acid resistance is not satisfactory.<br>
<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide formulations for acid-resistant, hydraulically setting compositions which have a high acid resistance and also have excellent mechanical strength.<br>
<br>
It has been found that the object can be achieved by a binder combination of slag sand and polymer to which pozzolanas and optionally small proportions of conventional cements can be added.<br>
<br>
The invention provides acid-resistant, hydraulically setting compositions based on<br>
<br>
a)	slag sand,<br>
b)	one or more pozzolanas,<br>
c)	one or more fillers,<br>
 d) one  or  more  polymers  based  on  ethylenically unsaturated monomers, and also water.<br>
<br>
Slag sand is obtained by granulation of blast furnace slag.

 <br>
The selection of monomers and the selection of the proportions by weight of the comonomers is carried out so that a glass transition temperature Tg of from -50°C to +50°C generally results. The glass transition temperature Tg of the polymers can be determined in a known manner by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) . The Tg can also be calculated approximately beforehand by means of the Fox equation. According to Fox T. G., Bull. Am. Physics Soc. 1, 3, page 123 (1956) : 1/Tg = xx/Tg1  + x2/Tg2 + . . . + xn/Tgn, where xn is the mass fraction (% by weight/100) of the monomer n and Tgn is the glass transition temperature in kelvin of the homopolymer of the monomer n. Tg values for homopolymers are given in Polymer Handbook 2nd Edition, J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1975).<br>

Further compounds which are suitable for hydrophobicization are fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives which ' liberate fatty acid or the corresponding fatty acid anion under alkaline conditions, preferably pH &gt; 8. Preference is given to fatty acid compounds from the group consisting of fatty acids having from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, the anhydrides thereof, the metal soaps thereof, the amides thereof and also the esters thereof with monohydric alcohols having from 1 to 14 carbon atoms, with glycol, with polyglycol, with polyalkylene glycol, with glycerol, with monoethanolamine, diethanolamine or triethanol-amine, with monosaccharides.<br>

<br>
The hydrophobicizing agents for modifying the polymers d) are generally used in an amount of from 1 to 20% by weight, based on the polymer d).<br>
 <br>
Particular preference is also given to combinations of polymers which have not been hydrophobically modified with hydrophobically modified polymers. The weight ratio is generally from 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
<br>
The polymers d) can be used in the form of their aqueous dispersions or as water-redispersible polymer powder. Preference is given to using them as water-redispersible polymer powder. The polymers in the form of their aqueous dispersions or water-redispersible polymer powders are produced in aqueous medium and preferably by the emulsion polymerization process. The polymers are in this case obtained in the form of aqueous dispersions and can optionally be converted by conventional drying processes into corresponding water-redispersible powders (dispersion powders). To obtain the hydrophobically modified polymers, the hydrophobicizing agents are preferably added after the polymerization of the polymer dispersion is complete and the dispersion is optionally dried. Processes for producing polymer dispersions and dispersion powders are known to those skilled in the art and are described, for example, in WO 2004/092094 Al, the relevant information in which is incorporated by reference into the present patent application.<br>
<br>
The proportion of polymers d) in acid-resistant, hydraulically setting compositions is generally from 0.5 to 3 0% by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 10% by weight, in each case based on the total dry weight of the compositions. When the polymer is used in the form of an aqueous dispersion, the proportion is based on the dry weight of the polymer.<br>
<br>
The composition can optionally additionally contain a small proportion of conventional cements. For example, standard cement in accordance with DIN EN 197-1, e.g. Portland cement CEM I - CEM V, blast furnace slake cement CEM III,  can be present.  The proportion is preferably from 0 to 
<br>
To produce ready-to-process compositions, the constituents a) to d) are mixed with [water. The amount of water necessary for this purpose is generally from 10 to 40% by weight, preferably from 10 to 20% by weight, in each case based on the total dry weight of the acid-resistant, hydraulically setting compositions.<br>
<br>
The production is not tied to any specific procedure or mixing apparatus and can, for example, be carried out in a concrete mixer or a ready-mixed concrete mixing apparatus. The acid-resistant, hydraulic compositions can be delivered to the building site in fully mixed form as dry mortar composition. As an alternative, mixtures can be produced from the constituents only on the building site and be converted into hydraulically setting compositions by addition of water.<br>
<br>
The mortars obtained therewith are suitable for coating building works, in particular in cable construction, for producing acid-resistant surfaces. The mortar is also suitable as jointing mortar, for example for jointing brickwork in wastewater conduits. A further field of use is as repair mortar, in particular for surfaces exposed to acid. The mortar is also suitable as adhesive, for example for adhesively bonding tiles and plates in the wastewater sector.<br>
<br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the invention:<br>
<br>
Base formulation:<br>
<br>
225 parts by weight of slag sand    (Slagstar 42.4 N)<br>
 100 parts by weight of fly ash      (EFA filler)<br>
15 parts by weight of silica dust   (Elkem Micro-Silica<br>
940 U-H) 246 parts by weight of silica sand  (AKW HR 0,7-l,2T,<br>
No. 5) 366 parts by weight of silica sand  (AKW HR 0,3-0,8T,<br>
NO. 7) 2.5 parts by weight of antifoam     (Agitan P 800) X  parts by weight of polymer<br>
<br>
The polymers indicated below were added in the form of water-redispersible polymer powders to the base formulation in the amounts indicated.<br>
<br>
The base formulation (BF) was stirred with from 120 parts by weight to 170 parts by weight of water so as to give a mortar having a slump (without tamping) in accordance with DIN 18555/EN 1015 of 10 cm.<br>
<br>
Comparative formulation:<br>
<br>
The comparative formulation (CF) was produced in a manner analogous to the base formulation except that the slag sand was replaced by the same amount of Portland cement CEM I 52,5T.<br>
<br>
Use test:<br>
<br>
Prisms having dimensions of 4 cm x 4 cm x 8 cm were produced from each of the mortar compositions and were stored under standard conditions (23°C, 50% relative atmospheric humidity) for 14 days.<br>
<br>
The test for resistance to sulfuric acid was carried out according to the Hamburg cable construction guideline (Franke et al., Priifrichtlinie fur Mortel im Sielbau, Tiefbau-Ingenieurbau, StraSenbau (TIS), 4/97) .<br>
<br>
5 test specimens (prisms) were used per batch.<br>
 <br>
The test specimens were in each case stored in water for 14 days (water storage, reference) and then stored at pH=0 for 14 days (acid storage).<br>
<br>
The pH was monitored daily and if necessary kept constant by means of after-titration. The aqueous phase was not changed during testing. After the storage times had elapsed, all loose constituents were removed from the test specimens and the specimens were washed with water.<br>
<br>
The weight of the prisms after water storage (mw) and after acid storage (ma) was determined. The greater the weight decrease Am between water storage and acid storage, the more material was removed by corrosion. A positive Am indicates that the test specimen is undamaged. The weight increase is attributable to the after-hydration of the undamaged test specimen.<br>
<br>
The following polymers were tested:<br>
<br>
Polymer P1:<br>
<br>
Vinyl acetate-ethylene copolymer having Tg = -7°C (Vinnapas 5044N)<br>
<br>
Polymer P2:<br>
<br>
Vinyl chloride-ethylene copolymer   (Vinnapas V 8062)<br>
<br>
Polymer P3:<br>
<br>
Mixture of 4 7 parts by weight of polymer PI and 3 parts by weight of a vinyl chloride-ethylene copolymer which had been hydrophobically modified by means of silane (Vinnapas A 7172)<br>
<br>
Polymer P4:<br>
<br>
Styrene-acrylate copolymer having Tg = +20°C (Vinnapas 2012N)<br>
 <br>
The test results in the table show that corrosion is effectively prevented (positive Am) when using the compositions according to the invention, while in the case of the comparative compositions (without powder = comparative example 1, without powder and without slag sand = comparative example 2) the weight of the test specimen decreases as a result of concrete corrosion.<br>
