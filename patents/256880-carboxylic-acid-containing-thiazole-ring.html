DESCRIPTION<br>
CARBOXYLIC ACID DERIVATIVE CONTAINING THIAZOLE RING AND<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL USE THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a novel carboxylic acid derivative containing a thiazole ring and a pharmaceutical agent containing the derivative as an active ingredient.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) is a nuclear receptor cloned in 1990 as a receptor responsive to peroxisome proliferator, forms a heterodimer with other nuclear receptor, retinoid X receptor (RXR), and activates various target genes as a transcription factor.  PPAR comprises three kinds of subtypes (PPARa, p (8) ,  y) ,   and it has been clarified that fibrate, which is a therapeutic drug for hyperlipidemia, acts as a ligand for PPARα  and a thiazolidine derivative, which is an insulin sensitizer, acts as a ligand for PPARy.<br>
[0003]<br>
Fibrate is a pharmaceutical agent widely used as a therapeutic drug for hyperlipidemia, and clofibrate, aluminum clofibrate, simfibrate, clinofibrate and the like have been heretofore used.  At present, bezafibrate (Bezatol SR (registered trademark), Bezalip (registered trademark)) and fenofibrate (lipantil (registered trademark)), which are called the second generation, have been generally used.<br>
[0004]<br>
Fibrate is known to regulate expression of genes (acyl CoA synthase, lipoprotein lipase, fatty acid transport protein and the like) relating to the metabolism of fatty acid and apolipoprotein (AI, All, AV, CIII) genes involved in triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol metabolism, by activation of<br><br>
PPARa, decreases TG and LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol.  Thus, fibrate is known to be highly effective as a therapeutic drug for hyperlipidemia. [0005]<br>
However, since conventional fibrate shows a weak PPARa agonist activity (EC50) of a μ mol/L order (not less than 30 μ nol/L), the dose needs to be as high as 200-1500 mg/day.  In addition, various side effects such as digestive symptoms such as gastric distress, feeling of sickness and the like, skin symptoms such as anthema and the like, liver dysfunction and pancreatitis have been reported (foregoing from lipantil (registered trademark) package insert), and there is a room for further improvement as a pharmaceutical agent having a PPARa agonist action. [0006]<br>
From the above, a pharmaceutical use as a compound superior in the pharmacological action based on PPARa activation (TG lowering action, LDL-C lowering action, HDL-C increasing action, anti-atherogenic action and the like) is expected by creating a compound capable of specifically activating PPARa than conventional fibrates.<br>
Given such background, various carboxylic acid derivatives have been reported in recent years with regard to PPARa agonists. For example, patent reference 1, non-patent reference 1 and nonpatent reference 2 have reported (phenylthio)acetic acid derivatives, patent reference 2 and non-patent reference 3 have reported 3-phenylpropionic acid derivatives, patent reference 3 and non-patent reference 4 have reported phenoxyacetic acid derivatives, patent reference 4 has reported phenoxyacetic acid derivatives, patent reference 5 and non-patent reference 5 have reported 2,2-dichloroalkane carboxylic acid derivatives, patent reference 6 has reported l,3-dioxane-2-carboxylic acid derivatives, and patent reference 7 has reported phenoxyacetic acid derivatives, but no description of (l,3-thiazol-2-yl)-<br><br>
thioacetic acid derivatives like the compound of the present<br>
invention is provided.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0007]<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a compound having a PPARa agonist action, which is useful as an agent for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of hyperlipidemia, and a compound useful as an intermediate therefor.<br>
Means of Solving the Problems<br>
[0008]<br>
