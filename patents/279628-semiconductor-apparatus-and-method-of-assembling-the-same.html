				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION SEMICONDUCTOR APPARATUS AND METHOD OF ASSEMBLING THE SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor apparatus that is configured such that device cooling heat sinks are disposed on both sides of a light-triggered type semiconductor device to thereby cool the light-triggered type semiconductor device, and to a method of assembling the semiconductor apparatus<br>
In a conventional semiconductor apparatus using light-triggered type semiconductor devices, as shown in FIG  1, an n-number of light-triggered type semiconductor devices 11 to In are connected in series Optical gate signals 101 to lOn are generated from a gate signal generating device 3 and supplied to the light-triggered type semiconductor devices 11 to In through optical fibers 21 to 2n<br>
Each of the light-triggered type semiconductor devices 11 to In is configured as shown in FIG  2A and FIG 2B   Specifically, the light-triggered type semiconductor device 1, as shown in FIGS  2A and 2B, has a circular housing la  A circular silicon wafer 5 is concentrically disposed within the housing la An L-shaped groove 4 is formed on an upper surface of the housing la  The L-shaped groove 4 extends radially outward from the center of the upper surface of the<br>
housing la, and also the L-shaped groove 4 extends from the center of the upper surface of the housing la toward the center of the silicon wafer 5  In addition, a cooling fin lb is provided on an outer peripheral portion of the lower part of the housing la<br>
An optical fiber 2 for guiding the optical gate signal 10 to the silicon wafer 5 is buried in the L-shaped groove 4 that is formed in the housing la<br>
The optical fiber 2, as shown in FIG  3, comprises a metal pipe portion 6 that corresponds in shape to the L-shaped groove 4 that is formed in the housing la, an insulating sheath portion 7 that is connected to the metal pipe portion 6 via a coupler and secures insulation between a high voltage part and a low-voltage part, and an optical fiber portion 8 that is passed through the metal pipe portion 6 and insulating sheath portion 7 and transmits the optical gate signal<br>
FIG 4 shows the state in which the metal pipe portion 6 of the optical fiber 2 is buried in the L-shaped groove 4 that is formed in the housing la of the light-triggered type semiconductor device 1 shown in FIG  2A and FIG  2B<br>
Thus, if an optical gate signal is generated from the gate signal generating device 3, the optical gate signal is sent to the silicon wafer 5 within the housing la through the optical fiber portion 8<br>
The above-described light-triggered type<br>
semiconductor device 1 and optical fiber 2 constitute one device unit   In the case where the n-number of light-triggered type semiconductor devices 11 to In are connected in series, as shown in FIG  1, device cooling heat sinks 9 are disposed so as to sandwich both side surfaces of each light-triggered type semiconductor device, 11 to 11a, as shown in FIG  5, and the heat sinks 9 and semiconductor devices 11 to 11a are coupled into an integral structure   In this case, as shown in FIG  6, the optical fiber (2)-side surface of the light-triggered type semiconductor device 1 is put in close contact with the side surface of the associated device cooling heat sink 9<br>
The device cooling heat sink 9 includes a water inlet 9a and a water outlet 9b for supplying and draining cooling water, which are provided at one end face of the heat sink 9, and a flow path 9c through which the cooling water is circulated to cool the heat that is produced from each device<br>
As has been described above, in the conventional semiconductor apparatus, the optical fiber 2 is first buried in the groove 4 that is formed in the housing of each light-triggered type semiconductor device 1, following which the heat sinks 9 are disposed so as to sandwich both side surfaces of the light-triggered type semiconductor device 1  Consequently, when the semiconductor devices and heat sinks are coupled into<br>
the integral structure, the work for coupling has to be conducted in the state in which the optical fibers 2 are led out of the light-triggered type semiconductor devices 1  Thus, there is the problem that the work for coupling is difficult<br>
In addition, if the optical fiber 2 is damaged and a need for replacement of the optical fiber 2 arises after the light-triggered type semiconductor devices 1 and heat sinks 9 are coupled into the integral structure, the integral structure has to be disassembled  The work for this requires a great deal of time and labor<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made in order to solve the above problems, and the object of the invention is to provide a semiconductor apparatus and a method of assembling the semiconductor apparatus, which can facilitate the work for coupling light-triggered type semiconductor devices and heat sinks and can also facilitate replacement of optical fibers<br>

According to the present invention, optical fibers can be attached to light-triggered type semiconductor devices after the light-triggered type semiconductor devices and device cooling heat sinks are coupled into a single structure  Thus, the work efficiency is enhanced, and even if the optical fiber is damaged, it can easily be replaced<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings Structural parts that are common to those shown in FIG  1 to FIG  6 are denoted by like reference numerals, and a description thereof is omitted<br>
FIG  7A is a front view of a device cooling heat sink in a first embodiment of the semiconductor apparatus according to the present invention  FIG  7B is a plan view of the device cooling heat sink in the first embodiment of the semiconductor apparatus according to the invention<br>
FIG  8 is a cross-sectional view, which corresponds to a cross section taken along line A-A' in FIG  5, and shows a contact part between the device cooling heat sink and the light-triggered type semiconductor device in the first embodiment<br>
In the first embodiment, as shown in FIG 7A, FIG  7B and FIG  8, an optical fiber insertion groove 91d, which corresponds in position to a groove 4 of a housing la, is formed on that side surface of a device cooling heat sink 91, which contacts a groove (4)-side surface of the housing la of the light-triggered type semiconductor device 1<br>
In this case, the device cooling heat sink 91 has a greater wall thickness than the device cooling heat sink 9 shown in FIG  5  The device cooling heat sink 91 includes a water inlet 91a and a water outlet 91b for supplying and draining cooling water, which are provided at one end face of the heat sink 91, and a flow path 91c through which the cooling water is circulated to cool the heat that is produced from each device  Thus, the groove 91d of a size enough to<br>
insert the optical fiber 4 can be formed in the thick wall part of the device cooling heat sink 91, without the groove 91d intersecting the flow path 91c<br>
In the state in which the optical fiber 4 is not attached, the device cooling heat sinks 91 are disposed to sandwich both side surfaces of the housing la of each light-triggered type semiconductor device 1, like the structure shown in FIG  5  The heat sinks 91 and semiconductor devices 1 are thus coupled into a single integral structure   In this case, the side surface of the housing la is put in close contact with the side surface of the associated device cooling heat sink 91, and the optical fiber insertion groove 91d is formed at a position corresponding to the groove 4 of the housing la  The optical fiber insertion groove 91d is formed such that the optical fiber 2 (shown in FIG 3) having the metal pipe portion 6, which corresponds in shape to the L-shaped groove 4 of the housing la, can be inserted in a hole that is defined by the optical fiber insertion groove 91d and the groove 4 formed in the side surface of the housing la of the light-triggered type semiconductor device 1<br>
Subsequently, the optical fiber 2 is inserted through the optical fiber insertion groove 91d, and the optical fiber 2 is buried in the groove 4 formed in the side surface of the housing la of the light-triggered type semiconductor device 1  Thereby, the optical<br>
fiber 2 is attached to the light-triggered type semiconductor device 1<br>
As has been described above, according to the first embodiment of the invention, the optical fiber insertion groove 91d, which corresponds in position to the groove 4 of the housing la, is formed in that side surface of the device cooling heat sink 91, which contacts the groove (4)-side surface of the housing la of the light-triggered type semiconductor device 1 Thereby, after the light-triggered type semiconductor devices 1 and device cooling heat sinks 91 are coupled into the single structure, the optical fibers 2 can be attached to the light-triggered type semiconductor devices 1 through the optical fiber insertion grooves 91d<br>
When the heat sinks 91 are disposed to sandwich both side surfaces of the housing la of each light-triggered type semiconductor device 1 and the heat sinks 91 and light-triggered type semiconductor devices 1 are coupled into the single structure, the optical fiber 2 is yet to be attached  Therefore, the work efficiency is enhanced, and even if the optical fiber 2 is damaged, it can easily be replaced<br>
FIG  9A is a front view of a device cooling heat sink in a second embodiment of the semiconductor apparatus according to the present invention  FIG  9B is a plan view of the device cooling heat sink in the<br>
second embodiment of the semiconductor apparatus according to the invention<br>
FIG  10 is a cross-sectional view, which corresponds to a cross section taken along line A-A' in FIG  5, and shows a contact part between the device cooling heat sink and the light-triggered type semiconductor device in the second embodiment<br>
In the second embodiment, as shown in FIG  9A, FIG  9B and FIG  10, an optical fiber insertion groove 91d, which corresponds in position to the groove 4 of the housing la, is formed on that side surface of the device cooling heat sink 91, which contacts the groove (4)-side surface of the housing la of the light-triggered type semiconductor device 1  In addition, a flow path 91c is provided within the device cooling heat sink 91 in a curved shape along the surrounding part of the optical fiber insertion groove 91d<br>
With this structure of the device cooling heat sink 91, like the first embodiment, after the light-triggered type semiconductor devices 1 and device cooling heat sinks 91 are coupled into the single structure, the optical fibers 2 can be attached to the light-triggered type semiconductor devices 1 through the optical fiber insertion grooves 91d<br>
When the heat sinks 91 are disposed to sandwich both side surfaces of the housing la of each light-triggered type semiconductor device 1 and the heat<br>
sinks 91 and light-triggered type semiconductor devices 1 are coupled into the single structure, the optical fiber 2 is yet to be attached  Therefore, the work efficiency is enhanced, and even if the optical fiber 2 is damaged, it can easily be replaced<br>
Furthermore, the flow path 91c, which is formed within the device cooling heat sink 91, is provided along the surrounding part of the optical fiber insertion groove 91d  Thus, the coolant can be circulated in the vicinity of the contact surface between the light-triggered type semiconductor device 1 and the associated device cooling heat sink 91 Therefore, the efficiency of cooling the light-triggered type semiconductor device 1 can be improved<br>
Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art  Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein  Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents<br>
