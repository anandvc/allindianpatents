				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION 1H-THIENO[2,3-c]PYRAZOLE DERIVATIVES USEFUL AS KINASE INHIBITORS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to thieno-pyrazole derivatives, to a process for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising them, and to their use as therapeutic agents, particularly in the treatment of cancer and cell proliferation disorders.<br>
Discussion of thejjackcjround<br>
The malfunctioning of protein kinases (PKs) is the hallmark of numerous diseases. A large share; of the oncogenes and proto-oncogenes involved in human cancers code for PKs The enhanced activities of PKs are also implicated in many non-malignant diseases, such as benign prostate hyperplasia, familial adenomatosis, polyposis, neuro-fibromatosis, psoriasis, vascular smooth cell proliferation associated with atherosclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, arlhriiis glomerulonephntis and post-surgical stenosis and restenosis.<br>
PKs are also implicated in inflammatory conditions and in the multiplication of viruses and parasites, PKs may also play a major role in the pathogenesis and development of neurodegenerative disorders,<br>
For a general reference to PKs 'malfunctioning or disregulation see, for instance, Current Opinion in Chemical Biology 1999, 3, 459 - 465.<br>
Among the several protein kinases known in the art as being implicated in the growth of cancer cells are Aurora kinases, in particular Aurora-2.<br>
Aurora-2 was found to be over-expressed in a number of different tumor types. Its gene locus maps at 20q13, a chromosomal region frequently amplified in many cancers, including breast [Cancer Res. 1999, 59(9), 2041-4] and colon.<br>
20q13 amplification correlates with poor prognosis in patients with node-negative breast cancer and increased Aurora-2 expression is indicative of poor prognosis and decreased survival time in bladder cancer patients [J. Natl, Cancer Inst., 2002, 94(17), 1320-<br>
9]. For a general reference to Aurora-2 role in the abnormal centre-some function in cancer see also Molecular Cancer Therapeutics, 2003, 2, 589 - 595 and Curr. Opin. Genet. &amp; Dev. 2004, 14(1), 29-36.<br>
SUMMARYjOF THE INVENTION<br>
II is an object of the invention to provide compounds, which are useful in therapy as agents against a host of diseases caused by and/or associated to a disregulated protein kinase activity and, more particularly, Aurora kinases activity.<br>
It is another object to provide compounds, which are endowed with protein kinase inhibiting activity and, more particularly, Aurora kinases inhibiting activity.<br>
The present inventors have now discovered that some thieno-pyrazole compounds, and derivatives thereof, are endowed with protein kinase inhibiting activity, e.g. Aurora kinases inhibiting activity.<br>
More specifically, the compounds of this invention are useful in the treatment of a variety of cancers including, but not limited to: carcinoma such as bladder, breast, colon, kidney, liver, lung, including small cell iung cancer, esophagus, gall-bladder, ovary, pancreas, stomach,   cervix,    thyroid,   prostate,    and   skin,    including   squamous   cell   carcinoma; hematopoietic tumors of lymphoid lineage, including leukemia, acufe lymphocitic leukemia, acute lyrnphoblastic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, T-celMymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, hairy cell lymphoma and Burkett's lymphoma; hematopoietic tumors of myeloid  lineage,   including   acute   and  chronic  myelogenous  leukemias,   myelodysplastic syndrome and promyelocytic leukemia; tumors of mesenchymai origin, including fibrosarcoma and rhabdornyosarcoma; tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system, including astrocyioma, neuroblastoma, glioma and schwannomas; other tumors, including melanoma, serninoma,    ieratpcarcinoma,   osteosarcoma,   xeroderma   pigmentosum,   keratoxanthoma, thyroid follicular cancer and Kaposi's sarcoma.<br>
Due to (he key role of PKs and Aurora kinases in the regulation of cellular proliferation, these thieno-pyrasole derivatives are also useful in She treatment of a variety of cell proliferate disorders such as, for instance, benign prostaie hyperplasia, familial adenomatosis, polyposis, neuro-fibromatosis, psoriasis, vascular smooth cell proliferation associated with atherosclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, arthritis glomerulonephritis and post-surgical stenosis and resfenosis.<br>
Accordingly,  in a first embodiment, the present invention  provides a method for treating cell proliferative disorders caused by and/or associated with an altered protein kinase<br>

A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily oblained as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Several heterocyclic compounds are known in the art as protein kinase inhibitors. As   an   example,   2-carboxamido-pyrazole  and   2-ureido-pyrazole   derivatives   have   been disclosed as protein kinase inhibitors in the international patent applications WO 01/12189, WO 01/12188, WO 02/48114 and WO 02/70515, all in the name of the applicant itself. Fused bicyclic compounds comprising pyrazole moieties and possessing kinase inhibitory activity have been also disclosed in WO 00/69846, WO 02/12242,.'WO 03/028720, WO 03/097610 as  well as  in WO2004007504 and W02004013146 applications  (respectively claiming priority from US 60/396,174 of July 17, 2002; and US 60/398,121 of July 25, 2002) ail in the name of the applicant itself.<br>
In addition, 5-phenylsulfonyl-thieno[2,3-c]pyrazole derivatives are also known in [he art as synthetic intermediates for the preparation of more complex heterocyclic structures, as reported in Monatshefte fur Chemie 128. 687-696 (1997).<br>
The compounds of the present invention fall within the scope of the general formula of the aforementioned WO2004013146 but are not specifically exemplified therein.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) of the invention have asymmetric carbon atoms and may therefore exist as individual optical isomers, as racemic mixtures or as any other mixture comprising a majority of one of the two optical isomers, which are all to be intended as within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Likewise, the use as an antitumor agent of all the possible isomers and their admixtures and of both the metabolites and the pharmaceutically acceptable bio-precursors (otherwise referred to as pro-drugs) of the compounds of formula (I) are also within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Prodrugs are any covalently bonded compounds, which release the active parent drug, according to formula (I), in vivo,<br>
In cases when compounds may exist in tautomeric forms, each form is contemplated as being included within this invention whether existing in equilibrium or predominantly in one form.<br>
As such, unless otherwise provided, when only one of the following tautomeric forms of formula (la) or (Ib) is indicated, the remaining one has still to be intended as comprised within the scope of the invention:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In the present description, unless otherwise specified, with the term aryl group we intend any aromatic carbocyclic ring system of 1 or 2 ring moieties, either fused or linked to each other through a single bond, for instance including phenyl, D- or D-naphthyl or biphenyl groups,<br>
With the term heteroaryl we intend any aromatic heterocyclic ring which may comprise an optionally benzocondensed 5 or 6 mernbered heterocycle with from 1 to 3 heteroatoms selected among N, O or S,<br>
Npn limiting examples of heteroaryl groups according to the invention, may thus include, for instance, pyridyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, indolyl, imidazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, pyrrolyl, phenyl-pyrrolyl, furyl, phenyl-furyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, pyrazolyl, thienyl, benzothienyl, isoindolinyl, benzoimidazolyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, 1,2,3-triazolyl, 1-phenyl-' 1,2,3-triazolyi, and the like.<br>

Clearly, as these same cycloalkyl groups may be formed when R, and R2 are taken together with the carbon atom to which they are attached, cyclic spiro compounds may be thus obtained. Just as an example, when ri and R2 together form a cyclopentyl group, derivatives having the following general formula are herewith considered: (Figure Removed)<br><br>
When considering derivatives of formula (I) wherein R-i or R2 represents a group -CH2NR'R" and .R' and R" are linked together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, heterocyclic moieties may be thus formed as per the general formula. Just as an example, by considering R, as hydrogen and R2 as a group -CH2NR'R" with R' and R" linked together so as to form .a pyrrolidinyl-1-yl group, compounds having the following general formula formula are herewith considered:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
From all of the above, it is clear to the skilled man that the compounds of formula (I) of the invention are characterized by the presence of a moiety, hereinafter simply referred to as benzylamino moiety, wherein the methylene group is necessarily substituted by at least one of the groups R, and R2 which is different from hydrogen.<br>
According to the meanings provided to R, any of the above aryl or heteroaryl groups may be optionally further substituted in any of their free positions by one or more groups, for instance 1 to 6 groups, selected from: halogen, nitro, carboxy, cyano, alkyl, polytluorinated alkyl,    alkenyl,    alkynyl,    cycloalkyl,    cycloalkenyl;    aryl,    heterocyclyl,    alkyl-heterocyclyl, heterocyclyl-alkyl, amino-alkyl, amino groups and derivatives thereof such as, for instance, alkylarnino,    dialkylamino,    arylamino,    diarylamino,    ureido,    alkylureido    or    arylureido; carbonylamino   groups   and   derivatives   thereof      such   as,   for   instance,   formylamino, alkylcarbonylamino, alkenylcarbonylamino, arylcarbonylamino, alkoxycarbonylamino; hydroxy groups and derivatives thereof such as, for instance, alkoxy, polyfluorinated alkoxy, aryloxy, heterocylyloxy,    alkylcarbonyloxy,   arylcarbonyloxy,   cycloalkenyloxy   or   alkylideneaminoxy; carbonyl groups arid derivatives thereof such as, for instance, alkylcarbonyl, arylcarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, aryloxycarbonyi, cycloalkyloxycarbonyl,  aminocarbonyl, alkylaminocarbonyl, dialkylaminocarbonyl;   sulfurated   derivatives   such   as,   for   instance,   alkylthio,   arylthio, alkylsulfonyl,      arylsulfonyl,      alkylsulfinyl,     arylsulfinyl,     arylsulfonyloxy,     arninosulfonyl, alkylaminosulfonyl or dialkylaminosulfonyl.<br>
In their turn, whenever appropriate, each of the above substituents may be further substituted by one or more of the aforementioned groups.<br>
With the term alkyl or alkoxy group we intend, unless otherwise provided, any straight or branched C,-C6 alkyl or alkoxy group, hence comprehensive of the aforementioned C,-C3 alkyl or alkoxy groups and also comprising n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-butoxy, iso-butoxy, sec-butoxy, tert-butoxy, n-pentyloxy, n-hexyloxy, and the like.<br>
With the term alkenyl or alkynyl group we intend, unless otherwise provided, any unsaturated straight or branched C2-C6 alkenyl or alkynyl group such as, for instance, vinyl, allyl, 1-propenyl, isopropenyl, 1-, 2-or 3-butenyl, pentenyl, hexenyl, ethynyl, 1- or 2-propynyl, butynyl, pentynyl, hexynyl, and the like.<br>
With the term polyfluorinated alkyl or alkoxy we intend any straight or branched C,-Cs alkyl or alkoxy group as above defined, wherein more than one hydrogen atom is replaced by fluorine atoms such as, for instance, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy, 1,2-difluoroethyl, 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropyl-2-yl, and the like.<br>

From all of the above, it is clear to the skilled man that any group which name has been identified as a composite name such as, for instance, cycloalkylalkyl, arylalkyl, heterocyclylalkyl, alkylthio, aryloxy, arylalkyloxy, alkylcarbonyloxy and the like, has to be intended as conventionally construed from the parts to which they derive. So far, as an example, the term alkoxy-heterocyclyl-alkyl stands for a straight or branched alkyl group substituted by a heterocycle further substituted by alkoxy, wherein alkyl, heterocycle and alkoxy are as above defined. Likewise, the term alkyl-heterocyclyloxy stands for a heterocyclyloxy group further substituted by alkyl.<br>

position 4' with a chloromethyl group with ammonia or a primary or secondary amine to deprotect and convert them into a compound of formula I, wherein R is an optionally substituted 4'-(amino-methyl)phenyl group, as shown in the following scheme: (Figure Removed)<br>
 The above process is an analogy process, which can be carried out according to methods known in the.art.<br>
From the above, it is clear to the person skilled in the art that if a compound of formula (I), prepared according to the above process, is obtained as an admixture of isomers, their separation into the single isomers of formula (I), carried out according to conventional techniques, is still within the scope of the present invention.<br>
According to step (a) of the process,' the reaction between a compound of formula (II) .and hydrazine or a hydrazine salt, for instance hydrazine dihydrochloride or hydrazine sulphate or acetate, can be carried out in the presence of catalytic amounts of an acid such as hydrochloric, acetic or sulphuric acid, or in the presence of catalytic amounts of a Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride dimethyl etherate. Alternatively, this same reaction may be also accomplished in the presence of catalytic amounts of a strong base such as sodium • methoxide.<br>
The reaction is carried out in a suitable solvent, such1 as, for instance, N,N'-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, acetonitrile, water, methanol or ethanol, at a temperature ranging from about room temperature to reflux and for a time varying from about 30 minutes to about 18 hours.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, within the compounds of formula (II), Alk represents a straight or branched lower alkyl group, for instance a C-\-Cs alky! group and even more preferably a C-|-C4 alkyl group.<br>
Preferably,  step  (a)  is carried out by reacting a compound  of formula (II) with hydrazine hydrate in methanol, ethanol or tetrahydrofuran at a temperature ranging from room , temperature to refluxing temperature. The obtained tert-butyl 4-cyano-5-hydrazinothiophene-2-carboxylate intermediate can be either separated from the reaction medium and further processed   as   per   the   working   examples   or,   alternatively,   directly   processed   through cyclization so as to afford the compound of formula (III). Cyclization is carried out at a temperature ranging from about 15°C to about 50°C in methanol or ethanol, and in the -presence of catalytic amounts of a mineral acid such as hydrochloric or .sulphuric acid.<br>
According to step (b) of the process, the thus obtained thieno-pyrazole derivative of formula (III) is then protected, according to well-known methods, at the pyrazole nitrogen atom. As an example, the above protection may occur with an alkyl chlorocarbonate, in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, chloroform, acetonitrile, toluene or mixtures-thereof, at a temperature ranging from about -5°C to about 35°C and for a time varying from about 30 minutes to about 72 hours, in the presence of an opportune proton scavenger such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine.<br>
According to step (c) of the process, the compound of formula (IV) is then reacted with any suitable acylating agent of formula (V) so as to yield the compound of formula (VI), by working according to methods well known in the art for the preparation of carboxamido derivatives. Tipycally, within the compound of formula (V), Z represents a halogen atom and, even more preferably, a bromine or chlorine atom.<br>
The reaction is carried out in a suitable solvent such as, for instance, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, chloroform, acetonitrile, toluene or mixtures thereof, at a temperature ranging from about -10°C to reflux and for a time varying from about 30 minutes to about 96 hours, in the presence of an opportune proton scavenger such as triethylamine, N,N-diisopropy!ethylamine or pyridine.<br>
From the above, it is clear to the skilled person that' the above protection at the pyrazole nitrogen atom, in step (b), is of particular advantage as it prevents that acylation with the compound of formula (V), in step (c), occurs at the pyrazole nitrogen atom. According to step (d) of the process, the carboxyester function of the compound of formula (VII) is selectively hydrolized so as to yield the corresponding carboxy group.<br>
The reaction is carried out under acidic conditions, preferably in the presence of hydrochloric acid in dioxane, by operating at room temperature and for a suitable time, for instance up to 72 hours.<br>
According to step (e) of the process, the compound of formula (VII) is then reacted with a suitable amino derivative of formula (VIII) so as to lead to the corresponding compound of formula (IX).<br>
From the above it is clear to the skilled person that this reaction may be accomplished in a variety of ways and operative conditions, which are widely known in the art for the preparation of carboxamides.<br>
As an example, the reaction between the compounds of formula (VII) and (VIII) can be<br>
carried out in the presence of a coupling agent such as, for instance, 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-y!)-<br>
1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 1,3-<br>
diisopropylcarbodiimide,	1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide,	N-<br>
cyclohexylcarbodiirnide-N'-propyloxymethyl polystyrene or N-cyclohexylcarbodiimide-N'-methyl polystyrene, in a suitable solvent such as, for instance, dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, 1,4-dioxane, acetonitrile, toluene, or N.N-dimethylforrnamide at a temperature ranging from about<br>
~10°C to reflux and for a suitable time, for instance from about 30 minutes to about 96 hours, The said reaction is optionally carried out in the presence of a suitable catalyst, for instance 4-dimethylaminopyridine, or in the presence of a further coupling reagent such as N-hydroxybenzotriazole.<br>
Alternatively, this same reaction can be also carried out, for example, through a mixed anhydride method, by using an alkyl chloroformate such as ethyl, iso-butyl, or iso-propyl chloroformate, in the presence of a tertiary base such as triethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylarnine or pyridine, in a suitable solvent such as, for instance, toluene, dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, diethyl ether, 1,4-dioxane, or N,N-dirnethylfoirnamide, at a temperature ranging from about -30°C to room temperature.<br>
According to step (f) of the process, the compound of formula (IX) is deprotected at the pyrazole nitrogen atom under basic conditions and by working according to conventional<br>
techniques, for instance by treatment with aqueous sodium or potassium hydroxide in the presence of a suitable co-solvent such as methanol, ethanol, dimethylformamide, 1,4-dioxane, or by treatment with a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or N,N-diisopropy!ethylamine and by using an alcohol like methanol or ethanol as the solvent.Deprotection may occur at a temperature ranging from about 18°C to refiuxing temperature of the solvent, for a time varying from about 30 minutes to about 72 hours.<br>
Finally, according to step f) of the process, the benzylic chlorine atom of the compound of formula (IXa) is substituted by treatament with ammonia or a primary or secondary amine in a suitable solvente like as methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, at a temperature ranging from 0 °C to the reflux temperature of the solvent, in these conditions the simultaneous removal of the protecting group at the pyrazole nitrogen also occurs.<br>
If desired, the salification of a compound of formula (I) or the conversion of a corresponding salt thereof into the free compound (I), according to step (f) of the process, can be easily carried out according to well-known methods in the art.<br>
As it will be appreciated by the person skilled in the art, when preparing the compounds of formula (I) object of the invention, optional functional groups within both the starting materials or the intermediates thereof and which could give rise to unwanted side reactions, need to be properly protected according to conventional techniques. Likewise, the conversion of these latter into the free deprotected compounds may be carried out according to known procedures.<br>
So far, when .the thieno-pyrazole derivative of the process being protected at the pyrazoie nitrogen atom is properly functionalized through carboxamido formation, in steps (c) and (e) of the process, the subsequent deprotection may occur under mild operative conditions, hence allowing to obtain the desired compound of formula (I).<br>
Whenever desired, according to an alternative embodiment of the invention, the compound of formula (ill) of step (a) may be reacted with an excess of the compound of formula (V), by working as reported in step (c), so as to get the desired functionalization at the amino moiety and, in the meantime, the protection at the pyrazole nitrogen atom.<br>
Therefore, it is a further object of the invention a process for preparing the compounds of formula (I) and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which process comprises:<br>
a') reacting the compound of formula (III) being obtained in step (a) of the process with an excess of a compound of formula (V), wherein R is as set forth above and Z represents a suitdOle leaving group, so as to obtain a compound of formula (X)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
b') deprotecting the compound of formula (X) at the pyrazole nitrogen atom, as per step (f) of the process, and further reacting the resultant compound according to the remaining steps (d) and (e).<br>
AH of the compounds of formula (11), (V) and (VIII) are known or can be obtained according to known methods.<br>
As an example, the starting material of formula (II) wherein Alk stands for methyl can be easily obtained as follows, by starting from commercially available ethyl 4-cyano-5-(methylthio)thiophene-2-carboylate:<br>
 (Figure Removed)<br>
The hydrolysis of the ethoxycarbonyl group is carried out according to well-known methods, for instance in the presence of aqueous alkaline solutions such as aqueous sodium hydroxide.<br>
Likewise, esterification is carried out according to well-known operative conditions, in the presence of an alkylating agent like tert-butyl bromide or di-tertbutyl-dicarbonate, in a suitable solvent such as dimethylformamide or tetrahydrofuran.<br>
Finally, the conversion of the alkylthio group into alkylsulfonyl can be carried in the presence of any opportune oxidizing agent such as, for instance, hydrogen peroxide, 3-<br>
chloroperoxybenzoic acid or oxone, in a suitable solvent such as, for instance, dichloromethane, DMF, acetone, toluene, acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, water, acetic acid, at a temperature ranging from about -10°C to reflux and for a time varying from about 30 minutes to about 4 days.<br>

PHARMACOLOGY<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are. active as protein kinase inhibitors, more particularly as Aurora kinases inhibitors and are therefore useful, for instance, to restrict the unregulated proliferation of tumor cells.<br>
In therapy, they may be used in the treatment of various tumors, such as those formerly reported, as well as in the treatment of other cell proliferative disorders such as psoriasis, vascular smooth cell proliferation associated with atherosclerosis and post-surgical stenosis and restenosis.<br>
The inhibiting activity and the potency of selected compounds is determined through a method of assay based on the use of the SPA technology (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).<br>
The assay consists of the transfer of radioactivity labelled phosphate moiety by the kinase to a biotinylated substrate. The resulting 33P-labelled biotinylated product is allowed to bind to streptavidin-ccated SPA beads (biotin capacity 130 pmol/mg), and light emitted was measured in a scintillation counter.<br>

After 60 minutes at room temperature incubation, reaction was stopped and biolinylated peptide captured by adding 100 ul of bead suspension.<br>
Stratification: 100 yl of CsCI2 5 M were added to each well and let stand 4 hour before radioactivity was counted in the Top-Count instrument.<br>
IC50 determination: inhibitors were tested at different concentrations ranging from 0 0015 to 10 utvl. Experimental data were analyzed by the computer program GraphPad Prizm using the four parameter logistic equation:<br>
y = botfom+(top-bottom)/(1+10"((loglC50-x)*slope))<br>
where x is the logarithm of the inhibitor concentration, y is the response; y starts at bottom and<br>
goes to top with a sigmoid shape,	<br>
Ki calculation;<br>
Experimental method; Reaction was carried out in -buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCI2l 0,2 mg/mL BSA, 7.5 mM DTT) containing 3.7 nM enzyme, histone and ATP (constant ratio of cold/labeled ATP 1/3000). Reaction was stopped with EDTA and the substrate captured on phosphomembrane (Multiscreen 96 well plates from Miilipore), After extensive washing, the multiscreen plates were read on a top counter, Control (time zero) for each ATP and histone concentrations was measured.<br>
