THE PATENTS (AMENDMENT) RULES 2006<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION CONTAINING FENOFIBRATE AND METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION<br>
THEREOF"<br>
LABORATOIRES DES PRODUITS ETHIQUES ETHYPHARM, a French company, of 21 rue Saint-Mathieu, F-78550 Houdan, France,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a novel  pharmaceutical<br>
5  composition containing fenofibrate.<br>
Fenofibrate is recommended in the treatment of adult endogenous hyperlipidemias, of hypercholesterolemias and of hypertriglyceridemias. A treatment of 300 to 10 400 mg of fenofibrate per day enables a 20 to 25% reduction of cholesterolemia and a 40 to 50% reduction of triglyceridemia to be obtained.<br>
The major fenofibrate metabolite in the plasma is 15 fenofibric acid, The half-life for elimination of fenofibric acid from the plasma is of the order of 20 hours. Its maximum concentration in the plasma is attained, on average, five hours after ingestion of the medicinal product- The mean concentration in the plasma 20 is of the order of 15 micrograms/ml for a" dose of 300 mg of fenofibrate per day. This level is stable throughout treatment.<br>
Fenofibrate is an active principle which is very poorly 25 soluble in water, and the absorption of which in the digestive tract is limited. An increase in its solubility or in its rate of solubilization leads to better digestive absorption.<br>
30 Various approaches have been explored in order to increase the rate of solubilization of fenofibrate: micronization of the active principle, addition of a surfactant, and comicronization of fenofibrate with a surfactant.<br>
35<br>
Patent EP 256 933 describes fenofibrate granules in which the fenofibrate is micronized in order tc increase   its   bioavailability.   The   crystalline<br><br><br>
fenofibrate microparticles are less than 50 µm in size, the binder used is polyvinylpyrrolidone. The document suggests other types of binder, such as methacrylic polymers, cellulose derivatives and polyethylene 5 glycols. The granules described in the examples of EP 256 933  are obtained by a method using organic solvents.	<br>
IPatent EP 330 532-- proposes improving the 10 bioavailability of fenofibrate by comicronizing it with a surfactant, such as sodium lauryl sulfate. The comicronizate is then granulated by wet granulation in order to improve the flow capacities of the powder and to facilitate the transformation into gelatin capsules. 15 This comicronization allows a significant increase in the bioavailability compared to the use of fenofibrate described in EP 256 933. The granules described in EP 330 532 contain polyvinylpyrrolidone as a binder.<br>
20 This patent teaches that the comicronization of fenofibrate with a solid surfactant significantly improves the bioavailability of the fenofibrate compared to the use of a surfactant, of micronization or of the combination of a surfactant and of micronized<br>
25  fenofibrate.<br>
Patent WO 98/31361 proposes improving the bioavailability of the fenofibrate by attaching to a hydrodispersible inert support micronized fenofibrate, 30 a hydrophilic polymer and, optionally, a surfactant. The hydrophilic polymer, identified as polyvinyl¬pyrrolidone, represents at least 20% by weight of the composition described above.<br>
35  This method makes	it possible to increase the rate of<br>
dissolution   of	the   fenofibrate,   and   also   its<br>
bioavailability.	However,   the  preparation  method<br>
according to that	patent is not entirely satisfactory<br>
since it requires	the use of a considerable amount of<br><br>
PVP and of the other excipients. The example presented in that patent application refers to a composition containing only 17.7% of fenofibrate expressed as a mass ratio. This l°w mass ratio for fenofibrate leads 5 to a final form which is very large in size, hence a difficulty in administering the desired dose of fenofibrate, or the administration of two tablets.<br>
In the context of the present invention, it has been 10 discovered that the incorporation of a cellulose derivative, used as a binder and solubilization adjuvant, into a composition containing micronized fenofibrate and a surfactant makes it possible to obtain a bioavailability which is greater than for a 15 composition containing a comicronizate of fenofibrate and of a surfactant.<br>
A subject of the present invention is therefore a pharmaceutical   composition   containing   micronized 20  fenofibrate,  a  surfactant  and  a  binding  cellulose derivative,  which  is  a  solubilization  adjuvant, preferably hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC).<br>
The  composition of the  invention  is advantageously<br>
25  provided  as  gelatin  capsules  containing  powder  or<br>
granules, preferably in the form of granules. These<br>
granules may in particular be prepared by assembly on<br>
neutral microgranules, by spraying an aqueous solution<br>
containing  the  surfactant,  the  solubilized  binding<br>
30  cellulose derivative and the micronized fenofibrate in<br>
suspension, or by wet granulation of powder, according<br>
to which the constituents, including in particular the<br>
micronized  fenofibrate,   the  surfactant  and  the<br>
cellulose derivative, are granulated by wet granulation<br>
35  using  an   aqueous   wetting   solution,   dried and<br>
calibrated.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention has a high proportion, of fenofibrate; it may<br><br>
therefore be provided in a formulation which is smaller in size than the formulations of the prior art, which makes this composition according to the invention easy to administer. 5<br>
The amount of fenofibrate is greater than or equal to 60% by weight, preferably greater than or equal to 70% by weight, even more preferably greater than or equal to 75% by weight, relative to the weight of the 10  composition.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the fenofibrate is not comicronized with a surfactant. On the contrary, it is micronized alone and then combined 15 with a surfactant and with the binding cellulose derivative, which is a solubilization adjuvant.<br>
The surfactant is chosen from surfactants which are solid or liquid at room temperature, for example sodium 20  lauryl   sulfate,   Polysorbate® 80   or   Montane® 20, preferably sodium lauryl sulfate.<br>
The fenofibrate/HPMC ratio is preferably between 5/1 and 15/1. 25<br>
The surfactant represents between 1 and 10%, preferably between 3 and 5%, by weight relative to the weight of fenofibrate.<br>
30 The binding cellulose derivative represents between 2 and 15%, preferably between 5 and 12%, by weight of the composition.<br>
Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose is preferably chosen, the 35  apparent viscosity of which is between 2.4 and 18 cP, and even more preferably between 2.4 and 3.6 cP, such as for example Pharmacoat 603®.<br><br>
The mean size of the fenofibrate particles is less than 15 µm, preferably 10 µm, even more preferably less than 8µm.<br>
5 The composition of the invention may also contain at least one excipient such as diluents, for instance lactose, antifoaming agents, for instance Dimethicone® and Simethicone®, or lubricants, for instance talc.<br>
10  The  pharmaceutical  composition  of	the  invention<br>
advantageously  consists  of  granules	in  an  amount<br>
equivalent to a dose of fenofibrate of	between 50 and<br>
300 mg, preferably equal to 200 mg.<br>
15 The present invention also relates to a method for preparing the powder or the granules, the composition of which is described above. This method uses no organic solvent.<br>
20 According to a first variant, the granules are prepared by assembly on  neutral microgranules.<br>
The neutral microgranules  have  a particle  size  of between 200 and 1 000 microns, preferably between 400 25  and 600 microns.<br>
The assembly is carried out in a sugar-coating pan, in a perforated coating pan or in a fluidized airbed, preferably in a fluidized airbed.<br>
30<br>
The assembly on neutral microgranules is carried out by spraying an aqueous solution containing the surfactant, the solubilized binding cellulose derivative, and the micronized fenofibrate in suspension.<br>
35<br>
According to a second variant, the granules are obtained by wet granulation of powder. The granulation enables the powders to be made dense and makes it possible to improve their flow properties.  It also<br>
allows better preservation  of  the  homogeneity,  by avoiding the various constituents becoming unmixed.<br>
The micronized fenofibrate, the surfactant, the 5 cellulose derivative and, optionally, the other excipients are mixed, granulated, dried and then calibrated. The wetting solution may be water or an aqueous solution containing the binding cellulose derivative and/or the surfactant.<br>
10<br>
According to a particular embodiment, the fenofibrate and the other excipients are mixed in -a planetary mixer. The wetting solution is added directly to the mixture. The wet mass obtained is granulated with an<br>
15 oscillating granulator, and then dried in an oven. The granules are obtained after passage over an oscillating calibrator.<br>

These results show that the composition of example 2B 10  is bioequivalent to that of Lipanthyl 200 M in fasting individuals.<br>
Comparative example 3: batch 2EF 001<br>
15  This example illustrates the prior art.<br>
It combines micronization of fenofibrate and the use of a surfactant. It differs from the present invention by the use of the mixture of binding excipients consisting 20 of a cellulose derivative other than HPMC: Avicel PH 101 and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP K30).<br>
It is prepared by extrusion-spheronization.<br><br>

*  In vitro dissolution profile<br>

The in vitro dissolution is determined according to a continuous flow cell method with a flow rate of 8 ml/min of sodium lauryl sulfate at 0.1 N. The comparative results with Lipanthyl 200 M are given in 10  the following table.<br><br>
Time (min)	15	30<br>
Example 3 (% dissolved)	24	40<br>
Lipanthyl 200 M (% dissolved)	47.3	64.7<br>
The  dissolution  is  slower  than  that  observed  for Lipanthyl 200 M. 15<br>
Pharmacokinetic   study   carried   out   in   fasting individuals<br>
The in vivo release profile of the gelatin capsules 20  containing the ZEF 001 granules at doses of 200 mg of fenofibrate  is  compared  with  that  of  the  gelatin capsules marketed under the trademark Lipanthyl 200 M.<br>
This study is carried out in 5 fasting individuals 25  receiving a single dose. Blood samples are taken at regular time intervals and fenofibric acid is assayed.<br>
The  results  are  given  in  the  following  table  and figure 4. 30<br><br><br>

The results obtained for Lipanthyl 200 M and for the product of example 3 are   represented   on    figure 4 by 5  curves 1 and 2, respectively.<br>
These results show the greater bioavailability of Lipanthyl 200 M compared with this formulation based on the prior art.<br>
10<br>
Example 3 shows that combining the knowledge of the prior art (namely micronization or use of surfactants) does not make it possible to obtain rapid dissolution of fenofibrate.  This results in low bioavailability<br>
15  compared with Lipanthyl 200 M.<br>
The  compositions prepared according to the present invention show more rapid dissolution than the formula of the prior art and improved bioavailability. 20<br><br>
