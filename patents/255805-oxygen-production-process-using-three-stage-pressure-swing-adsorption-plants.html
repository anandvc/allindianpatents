DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The raw material gas of the present invention is air and its typical components are shown in the<br>
following table:<br><br>
The present invention adopts the three-stage pressure-swing adsorption technique to produce the<br>
enriched oxygen from air. The method adopts three-stage pressure-swing adsorption device<br>
operating in series, wherein the first stage is used to remove gaseous water and carbon dioxide as<br>
well as partial nitrogen. The average concentration of oxygen in outlet gas of the adsorption<br>
tower in the adsorption step is 21 ~ 80% ( V ) . The adsorbents in the adsorption tower of the<br>
first stage are activated alumina and molecular sieve from the bottom up. The second stage is<br>
used to further remove the nitrogen in interim gas which is discharged from the adsorption tower<br>
in the adsorption step of the first stage and increase the concentration of oxygen up to the desired<br>
level. The adsorbent which is packed in the adsorption tower of the second stage is molecular<br>
sieve. The third stage is used to further remove the nitrogen and argon in gas mixture which is<br>
discharged from the adsorption tower in the adsorption step of the second stage and increase the<br><br>
concentration of oxygen up to above 99.5V%. The adsorbent in the adsorption tower of the third<br>
stage is carbon molecular sieve or oxygen adsorption equilibrium adsorbent. The pressure of<br>
adsorption step A of three-stage pressure-swing adsorption device is 0.001 ~ 0.6Mpa(g). Each<br>
adsorption tower of the three-stage pressure-swing adsorption device sequentially undergoes the<br>
following steps in one circulation period:<br>
The first stage :<br>
□ Adsorption A<br>
Feed air into the inlet of the adsorption tower in adsorption step, the adsorbents in the adsorption<br>
tower adsorb selectively water, carbon dioxide and partial nitrogen, etc. in turn from the air. The<br>
nonadsorbed partial nitrogen and weakly adsorbed argon, etc. are discharged from the outlet and<br>
enter into the adsorption tower in adsorption step of the second stage. The total amount of<br>
adsorbed water, carbon dioxide and partial nitrogen etc. increases gradually with the increase of<br>
time. Stop feeding air when the adsorbents are saturated by the components mentioned above,<br>
and the adsorption ends here.<br>
□ Two-end Equalization Depressurization 2ED'<br>
After the adsorption, the concentration of oxygen in the dead-space of the adsorption tower is<br>
relatively higher and this part of oxygen should be recovered and reused. Thus, decrease the<br>
pressure of the gas in the adsorption tower from both ends of top and bottom. The gas of dead-<br>
space is discharged from the two ends of the adsorption tower and enters into the corresponding<br>
adsorption tower of the first stage that has completed the second stage gas backward equalization<br>
repressurization 2ER step to perform the two-end repressurization 2ER' step. The frequency of<br>
two-end equalization depressurization 2ED' can be 1 or above (for example, 1 to 3 times).<br>
After the adsorption, it can also perform the step of cocurrent equalization depressurization or<br>
backward equalization depressurization only.<br>
□ Purge P'<br>
After the two-end equalization depressurization 2ED' step, replace the remained oxygen in the<br>
adsorption tower out by feeding the gas got from evacuation VC step of the first stage from the<br>
bottom of the adsorption tower. The gas mixture replaced from the adsorption tower enters into<br>
the corresponding adsorption tower of the first stage that has completed the second stage gas<br>
backward equalization repressurization 2ER step or the two-end equalization repressurization<br>
2ER' step to perform the purge gas repressurization R' step.<br><br>
□ Backward Depressurization BD<br>
After purge P' step, this part of gas is backward vented to the atmosphere from the bottom of the<br>
adsorption tower or act as product.<br>
□ Evacuation VC<br>
After purge P' step, pull out and blow off the water, carbon dioxide and nitrogen adsorbed by the<br>
adsorbents from the bottom of the adsorption tower with the vacuum pump. This step enable the<br>
absorbent to obtain the regeneration.<br>
□	The Second Stage Gas Backward Equalization Repressurization 2ER<br>
After evacuation VC step, the gas discharged from the adsorption tower of the second stage that<br>
has completed the adsorption or the cocurrent equalization depressurization ED step enters into<br>
the adsorption tower of the first stage that has complete□ Evacuation VC step, and lifts the<br>
pressure of the adsorption tower. The frequency of the second stage gas backward equalization<br>
repressurization 2ER can be 1 or above (for example, 1 to 7 times).<br>
□	Two-end Equalization repressurization 2ER'<br>
After the second stage gas backward equalization repressurization 2ER step, the gas discharged<br>
from the two-end equalization depressurization 2ED' step of the first stage enters into the<br>
adsorption tower from the inlet end and the outlet end, and lifts the pressure of the adsorption<br>
tower gradually. The frequency of 2ER' and 2EDD is equal. The gas of 2ER' comes from 2EDD<br>
gas of different adsorption tower every time. The 2ER' step of the adsorption tower of the first<br>
stage is different from the general equalization repressurization ER step. In the general ER step,<br>
the gas enters at the outlet end of the adsorption tower. By contrast, in the 2ER' step of the<br>
adsorption tower of the first stage, the gas enters at the inlet end and the outlet end of the<br>
adsorption tower.<br>
□	Purge Gas Repressurization R'<br>
After the 2ER' step or the 2ER step, the pressure of the adsorption tower is increased by the gas<br>
discharged from the outlet of the adsorption tower in the purge P' step of the first stage.<br>
□ Final Repressurization FR<br>
After the R' step, the pressure of the adsorption tower is increased from the top with the gas<br>
discharged from the outlet of the adsorption tower in the adsorption step or with the raw material<br>
air until the adsorption pressure.<br>
The second stage:<br>
□ Adsorption A<br><br>
Feed the outlet gas of the adsorption tower in the adsorption step of the first stage into the<br>
adsorption tower in the adsorption step of the second stage. The adsorbent of the adsorption<br>
tower adsorbs selectively nitrogen. The weakly adsorbed oxygen and argon etc. are discharged<br>
from the outlet end and enter into enriched oxygen buffer vessel or the next step. The total<br>
amount of adsorbed nitrogen increases gradually with the increase of time. Stop feeding gas<br>
when the adsorbent is saturated by nitrogen and the adsorption ends here. The concentration of<br>
oxygen in the outlet gas should be controlled in the level of production required.<br>
□ Cocurrent Equalization depressurization ED<br>
After the adsorption, the dead-space gas in the adsorption tower is discharged from the outlet and<br>
enters into the corresponding adsorption tower of the second stage that has completed the<br>
backward equalization depressurization BD' step to increase the pressure. The pressure of the<br>
two towers can be equal or not, to satisfy the requirement of the concentration of the enriched<br>
oxygen in production. The frequency of ED can be 1 or above (for example, 1 to 3 times).<br>
□ Backward Equalization Depressurization BD'<br>
After adsorption or ED step, perform the second stage gas backward equalization<br>
repressurization 2ER step directly for several times with the gas discharge□ Backward from the<br>
bottom of the adsorption tower for the adsorption tower of the first stage that has completed VC<br>
step. The frequency of BD' can be 1 or above (for example, 1 to 7 times).<br>
When performing 2ER mentioned above, we can also discharge backward the gas in the<br>
adsorption tower into a buffer vessel at first, and then transfer it into the adsorption tower that<br>
has completed VC step in first stage to perform the 2ER step. The number of the buffer vessels<br>
equals to the frequency of BD' step.<br>
□ Backward Repressurization ER<br>
After backward equalization depressurization BD' step, the gas discharged from the ED step<br>
enters into the adsorption tower at the outlet end, and increases the pressure of the adsorption<br>
tower.<br>
□ Final Repressurization FR<br>
The gas discharged from the outlet of the adsorption tower in the adsorption step is used to<br>
increase the pressure of the adsorption tower from the top until the adsorption pressure.<br>
The third stage :<br>
□ Adsorption A<br>
Feed oxygen-enriched gas mixture into the inlet of the adsorption tower in adsorption step, the<br><br>
adsorbent in the adsorption tower adsorbs selectively oxygen, etc. in turn from the oxygen-<br>
enriched gas mixture. The nonadsorbed nitrogen or argon, etc. are discharged from the outlet to<br>
. vent to the atmosphere or serve as other use. The total amount of adsorbed oxygen etc. increases<br>
gradually with the increase of time. Stop feeding gas when the adsorbent is saturated by oxygen<br>
mentioned above, and the adsorption ends here.<br>
□ Cocurrent Equalization depressurization ED<br>
After the adsorption, the dead-space gas in the adsorption tower is discharged from the outlet and<br>
enters into the corresponding adsorption tower of the third stage that has completed the purge gas<br>
repressurization R' step to increase the pressure. The pressure of the two towers can be equal or<br>
not, to satisfy the requirement of the concentration of oxygen in production. The frequency of<br>
ED can be 1 or above (for example, 1 to 3 times).<br>
□	Purge P'<br>
After the cocurrent equalization depressurization ED step, replace the remained nitrogen and<br>
argon in the adsorption tower out by feeding the compressive product oxygen from the bottom of<br>
the adsorption tower; the product oxygen comes from the adsorption tower of the third stage that<br>
has completed purge P' step. The gas mixture replaced from the adsorption tower enters into the<br>
corresponding adsorption tower of the third stage that has completed the depressurization D step<br>
or the evacuation VC step to perform the purge gas repressurization R' step.<br>
(4) Oxygen Product Depressurization D<br>
After the purge P' step, this part of gas is discharged from the adsorption tower. One part of the<br>
gas acts as product, the other part of the gas is pressurized to purge the adsorbent in the<br>
adsorption tower.<br>
□	Evacuation VC<br>
After the purge P' step or the cocurrent equalization depressurization ED step or the oxygen<br>
product depressurization D step, the pure oxygen adsorbed by the adsorbent is pulled out from<br>
the bottom of the adsorption tower with the vacuum pump and enters into the next step. This step<br>
enable the absorbent to obtain the regeneration at the same time.<br>
(6)	Purge Gas Repressurization R'<br>
After the oxygen product depressurization D step or the evacuation VC step, the pressure of the<br>
adsorption tower is increased by the gas discharged from the outlet of the other adsorption tower<br>
in the purge P' step of the third stage.<br>
(7)	Backward Equalization Repressurization ER<br><br>
After the oxygen product depressurization D step or the purge gas repressurization R' step or the<br>

Example 1<br>
The feed gas of this example is air. The concentration of oxygen in the outlet gas discharged<br>
from the adsorption tower in the adsorption step of the first stage should be controlled at<br>
21 ~23% ( V ) . The concentration of oxygen in the outlet gas discharged from the adsorption<br>
tower in the adsorption step of the second stage should be controlled at about 93% ( V ) (viz.<br>
oxygen-enriched product). The third stage is used to further remove the nitrogen and argon in gas<br>
mixture which is discharged from the adsorption tower in the adsorption step of the second stage<br>
and increase the concentration of oxygen up to above 99.5%(V).<br>
The components of air in this example are as following:<br><br>
pressure : 0.6 MPa ( G )<br>
As shown in the Fig.4,the first stage pressure-swing adsorption device is composed of four<br>
adsorption towers 1A ~ 1D; the adsorbents in the adsorption tower of the first stage are activated<br>
alumina and molecular sieve in turn from the bottom up; single tower is simultaneously in an<br>
adsorption step and the equalizing pressure step performs once in the working procedure; do the<br>
creation of vacuum on the adsorption tower through the vacuum pipe-line G15 using the vacuum<br>
pump P1. The second stage pressure-swing adsorption device is composed of four adsorption<br>
towers 2A ~ 2D; the adsorbent in the adsorption tower of the second stage is molecular sieve;<br>
single tower is simultaneously in an adsorption step and the equalizing pressure step performs<br>
once in the working procedure. The third stage pressure-swing adsorption device is composed of<br>
four adsorption towers 3A ~ 3D; the adsorbent in the adsorption tower of the third stage is<br>
carbon molecular sieve or oxygen adsorption equilibrium adsorbent; single tower is<br><br>
simultaneously in an adsorption step and purge-depressurization is performed in the working<br>
procedure. This example adopts three-stage pressure-swing adsorption device mentioned above<br>
operating in series. The first stage is used to remove the gaseous water, carbon dioxide and<br>
partial nitrogen in the air, the second stage pressure-swing adsorption device is used to further<br>
remove the nitrogen in interim gas which is discharged from the adsorption tower in the<br>
adsorption step of the first stage and increase the concentration of oxygen up to the desired level,<br>
and the third stage pressure-swing adsorption device is used to further remove the nitrogen and<br>
argon in gas mixture which is discharged from the adsorption tower in the adsorption step of the<br>
second stage and increase the concentration of oxygen up to above 99.5V%.<br>
The air enters into the adsorption tower in adsorption step of the first stage. The adsorbents in the<br>
adsorption tower adsorb selectively vaporous water, carbon dioxide and partial nitrogen etc. in<br>
turn from the air. The nonadsorbed partial nitrogen, weakly adsorbed oxygen and argon etc. are<br>
discharged from the outlet and enter into the adsorption tower in adsorption step of the second<br>
stage. The molecular sieve in the adsorption tower of the second stage adsorbs selectively<br>
nitrogen. The weakly adsorbed oxygen and argon etc. are discharged from the outlet and enter<br>
i<br>
into buffer vessel of oxygen-enriched product. The third stage pressure-swing adsorption device<br>
is used to further remove the nitrogen and argon in gas mixture which is discharged from the<br>
adsorption tower in the adsorption step of the second stage and increase the concentration of<br>
oxygen up to above 99.5V%. The concentration of oxygen in the outlet gas discharged from the<br>
adsorption tower in the adsorption step of the first stage should be controlled at 21 ~ 23% ( V ) ;<br>
the adsorption tower of the first stage sequentially undergoes the following steps in one<br>
circulation period: adsorption A , purge P' ,evacuation VC , the second stage gas backward<br>
equalization repressurization 2ER , purge gas repressurization R', final repressurization FR. The<br>
concentration of oxygen in the outlet gas discharged from the adsorption tower in the adsorption<br>
step of the second stage should be controlled at about 70-95% ( V ) ; the adsorption tower of<br>
the second stage sequentially undergoes the following steps in one circulation period: adsorption<br>
A, backward equalization depressurization BD', and Final repressurization FR. The third stage<br>
pressure-swing adsorption device is used to increase the concentration of oxygen in the outlet gas<br>
discharged from the adsorption tower in the adsorption step of the second stage up to 99.5V%.<br>
The adsorption tower of the third stage sequentially undergoes the following steps in one<br>
circulation period: adsorption A, oxygen product purge P', oxygen product depressurization D,<br><br>
and purge gas repressurization R'.<br>
Taking the adsorption tower 1A as an example and crossing reference to Fig.l and Fig.4, we<br>
demonstrate the steps of the adsorption tower of the first stage in one circulation period in this<br>
example:<br>
(1)	Adsorption A<br>
By now, the adsorption tower 1A has completed FR step. The air enters into the adsorption tower<br>
1A through the pipeline G11 by opening the sequence valves 11A, 12A. In tower 1A, the<br>
adsorbents adsorb selectively water, carbon dioxide and partial nitrogen etc. in turn from the air.<br>
The nonadsorbed partial nitrogen and weakly adsorbed argon, etc. are discharged from the outlet<br>
and enter into the adsorption tower in adsorption step of the second stage. The total amount of<br>
adsorbed water, carbon dioxide and partial nitrogen etc. increases gradually with the increase of<br>
time. Stop feeding air when the adsorbents are saturated by the components mentioned above,<br>
and the adsorption ends here. Close the sequence valves 11A, 12A. The concentration of nitrogen<br>
in the outlet gas should be controlled at 70-78 %(V).<br>
(2)	Purge P'<br>
After the adsorption step, the outlet gas from the vacuum pump enters into the adsorption tower<br>
1C through the pipeline G16 and G14 to perform the purge gas repressurization step (abbr. R')<br>
by opening the sequence valve's 16A, 14A and 14C. When the concentration of nitrogen in the<br>
adsorption tower 1A meets the requirement, close 16A, 14A and 14C.<br>
(3)Evacuation VC<br>
After the purge P' step, open the sequence valve 15A, the adsorbed water, carbon dioxide and<br>
nitrogen are taken out from the bottom of the adsorption tower with vacuum pump to vent to the<br>
atmosphere or act as product, and the absorbents are regenerated at the same time.<br>
(4)The Second Stage Gas Backward Equalization Repressurization 2ER<br>
After the evacuation VC step, open the sequence valves 25a, 14A and KV8. The gas of the BD'<br>
step in the adsorption tower 2a of the second stage enters into the adsorption tower 1A to<br>
increase the pressure of the adsorption tower 1 A.<br>
(5)Final Repressurization FR<br>
After the 2ER step, open the sequence valves KV6 and 13A. The outlet gas from the adsorption<br>
tower in the adsorption step enters from the top of the adsorption tower 1A to increase the<br>
pressure of it. When the pressure of the adsorption tower 1A reaches near the adsorption<br><br>
pressure, close KV6 and 13 A.<br>
Thus, the adsorption tower 1A has completed a circulation period and can enter into the next<br>
circulation again. The circulation steps of the adsorption tower 1B~ 1D are the same as tower<br>
1A, but the operating time is staggered each other, see also Fig. 1 and Fig.4.<br>
Taking the adsorption tower 2a as an example and crossing reference to Fig.2 and Fig.4, we<br>
demonstrate the steps of the adsorption tower of the second stage in one circulation period in this<br>
example now:<br>
(1)	Adsorption A<br>
By now, the adsorption tower 2a has completed the FR step. The interim gas mixture enters into<br>
the adsorption tower 2a through the pipeline G21 by opening the sequence valves 21a, 22a. In<br>
tower 2a, the outlet gas from the adsorption tower in adsorption step of the first stage enters into<br>
the adsorption tower in adsorption step of the second stage. The adsorbent in the adsorption<br>
tower adsorbs selectively nitrogen. The weakly adsorbed oxygen and argon, etc. are discharged<br>
from the outlet and enter into enriched oxygen buffer vessel or the next step. The total amount of<br>
adsorbed nitrogen increases gradually with the increase of time. Stop feeding gas when the<br>
adsorbent is saturated by nitrogen, and the adsorption ends here. Close 21a, 22a.<br>
(2)	Backward Equalization Depressurization BD'<br>
After the adsorption step, open the sequence valves 25a, 14A and KV8. The gas in the adsorption<br>
tower 2a enters into the adsorption tower 1A backward to increase the pressure of it.<br>
(3)	Final Repressurization FR<br>
After the BD' step, open the sequence valves KV7 and 23a. The outlet gas from the adsorption<br>
tower in the adsorption step enters from the top of the adsorption tower 2a to increase the<br>
pressure of it. When the pressure of the adsorption tower 2a reaches near the adsorption pressure,<br>
close KV7 and 23 a.<br>
Thus, the adsorption tower 2a has completed a circulation period and can enter into the next<br>
circulation again. The circulation steps of the adsorption tower 2b~ 2h are the same as 2a, but the<br>
operating time is staggered each other, see also Fig.2 and Fig.4.<br>
Taking the adsorption tower 3A as an example and crossing reference to Fig.3 and Fig.4, we<br>
demonstrate the steps of the adsorption tower of the third stage in one circulation period in this<br>
example:<br><br>
(1)AdsorptionA<br>
By now, the adsorption tower 3A has completed R' step. The oxygen-enriched gas enters into the<br>
adsorption tower 3A through the pipeline G31 by opening the sequence valve 31 A. When the<br>
pressure of the adsorption tower 3 A is increased to the adsorption pressure, open the sequence<br>
valve 32A. In tower 3A, the adsorbent adsorbs selectively oxygen in turn from the oxygen-<br>
enriched gas mixture. The nonadsorbed nitrogen or argon, etc. are discharged from the outlet to<br>
vent to the atmosphere or serve as other use. The total amount of adsorbed oxygen increases<br>
gradually with the increase of time. Stop feeding gas when the adsorbent is saturated by oxygen<br>
mentioned above, and the adsorption ends here. Close the sequence valves 31 A, 32A. The<br>
concentration of oxygen in the outlet gas should be controlled at 5-50 %(V).<br>
(2)	Purge P'<br>
After the adsorption step, the outlet gas from the compressor enters into the adsorption tower 3C<br>
through the pipeline G36 and G33 to perform the purge gas repressurization step (abbr. R') by<br>
opening the sequence valves 36A, 34A and 34C. When the concentration of oxygen in the outlet<br>
gas mixture of the adsorption tower 3A meets the requirement, close 36A, 34A and 34C.<br>
(3)	Oxygen Product Depressurization D<br>
After the purge P' step, by opening the sequence valves 33A,36B, 34B and 34D at first, the<br>
oxygen product is discharged from the adsorption tower and is pressurized to the adsorption<br>
pressure to purge the adsorption tower 3B. And then the oxygen product is discharged from the<br>
adsorption tower and enters into the next step by opening the sequence valve 35A at the end of<br>
purging.<br>
(4)	Purge Gas Repressurization R'<br>
After the oxygen product depressurization D step, the outlet gas discharged from the adsorption<br>
tower 3C in the purge P' step lifts the pressure of the adsorption tower by opening the sequence<br>
valve 34A-<br>
Thus, the adsorption tower 3A has completed a circulation period and can enter into the next<br>
circulation again. The circulation steps of the adsorption tower 3B~ 3D are the same as tower<br>
3A, but the operating time is staggered each other, see also Fig.3 and Fig.4.<br>
The result of this example is that the concentration of oxygen is above 99.5 %( v), the<br>
concentration of nitrogen is above 99.9 %(v), and the recovery of oxygen is above 99.5 %(v).<br>

ABSTRACT	<br><br><br>
OXYGEN PRODUCTION PROCESS USING THREE-STAGE<br>
PRESSURE SWING ADSORPTION PLANTS<br>
A process for producing oxygen by using of three-stage pressure swing adsorption plants,<br>
wherein the process is used to separate nitrogen and oxygen from a feed air stream, the<br>
product can be oxygen or nitrogen or both of them. The process utilizes three-stage pressure<br>
swing adsorption plants which are serially connected. In the first stage, carbon dioxide, water<br>
and part of nitrogen are removed and nitrogen is concentrated. In the second stage, nitrogen is<br>
further separated from the effluent intermediate gas from the adsorption step in the adsorption<br>
towers of the first stage and oxygen is concentrated to the desired concentration. In the third<br>
stage, nitrogen and argon are further separated from the effluent oxygen-enriched mixture gas<br>
from the adsorption step in the adsorption towers of the second stage and the concentration of<br>
oxygen is raised to 95V% or more. In the first stage, the adsorption towers go through the<br>
steps in turn in a cycle: Adsorption(A), Purge(P'), evacuation(VC), countercurrent pressure<br>
equalization rising of the second stage gas(2ER), purge gas pressurization(R'), final<br>
pressurization(FR); In the second stage, the adsorption towers go through the steps in turn in<br>
a cycle: Adsorption(A), countercurrent pressure equalization falling(BD'), final<br>
pressurization(FR); In the third stage, the adsorption towers go through the steps in turn in a<br>
cycle: Adsorption(A), Oxygen product purge(P'), Oxygen product depressurization(D), Purge<br>
gas pressurization(R').</td>
