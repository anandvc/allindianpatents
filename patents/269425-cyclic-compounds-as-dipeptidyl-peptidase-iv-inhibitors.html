Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce or property use insulin. Around ISO million people have diabetes mellitus worldwide and this number will be double by the year 2025. Much of this increase will occur in developing countries and will be due to population growth, ageing, unhealthy diets, obesity and sedentary lifestyles. By 2025, while most people with diabetes in developed countries will be aged 65 years or more, in developing countries most will be in the 45-64 year age bracket and affected in their most productive years. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, lower limb amputations, and renal failure in the United States. The healthcare cost of diabetes is high, with the total estimated cost in the United States exceeding $100 billion. Estimated number of diabetes cases in India in 2002 was 31.7 million. A report by American Diabetes Association, April 2004 stated that by 2030, 79.4 million are going to be affected by diabetes. As of today, approximately 5% of world population is suffering from type II diabetes.<br><br>
Background<br><br>
Diabetes refers to a disease process derived from multiple causative factors and is characterized by elevated levels of plasma glucose or hyperglycemia in fasting state or after administration of glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test. Persistent or uncontrolled hyperglycemia is associated with increased and premature morbidity and mortality. Often abnormal glucose homeostasis is associated both directly and indirectly with alterations of the lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein metabolism and other metabolic and hemodynamic diseases. Therefore patients with Type II diabetes mellitus are at especially increased risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications, including coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Therefore, therapeutical control of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism and hypertension are critically important in the clinical management and treatment of diabetes mellitus.<br><br>
Diabetes mellitus has serious effects on people's health and accompanies various complications. There are two major types of diabetes mellitus: type I diabetes mellitus characterized by little or no insulin secretory capacity due to the destruction of the pancreatic cells, and type II diabetes mellitus characterized by insulin deficiency and insulin resistance due to other causes. The prevalence of type II diabetes mellitus is 90% or more of total patients with diabetes mellitus.<br><br>
The worldwide epidemic of type II diabetes has been stimulating the search for new concepts and targets for the treatment of this incurable disease. Most current therapies were developed in the absence of defined molecular targets. Increasing knowledge on the biochemical and cellular alterations occurring in NIDDM (Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus) has led to the development of novel and potentially more effective therapeutic approaches to treat the disease. The role of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor in the regulation of lipid metabolism, insulin and triglycerides led to the rational design of several PPAR agonists. However, these drugs have side effects such as hypoglycemia, weight gain and the like. Accordingly, there is a strong need to develop therapeutic agents with decreased side effects, which in particular would not induce hypoglycemia and weight gain. <br><br>
The other targets are: Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase IB (PTP1B); Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK-3); Adiponectin; Insulin Receptor Mimetic and Glucagon-like Peptidel (GLP-1)<br><br>
The serine protease DPP-IV is responsible for the rapid degradation of the insulinotropic hormone GLP-1 (glucagon like peptide 1). DPP-IV inhibition results in an increase of circulating GLP-1 levels and as a consequence, improves the insulin secretion in type II diabetic patients. Other physiological effects of enhanced GLP-1 levels, such as reduction of hepatic glucose output, delayed gastric emptying and possibly an increased insulin sensitivity as well as preservation of pancreatic beta cell function, are believed to contribute to the beneficial effects (Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry, 2007, 7, 579-595). Advantageously, since the incretins are produced by the body only when food is consumed, DPP-IV inhibition is not expected to increase the level of insulin at inappropriate times,such as between meals,   which can lead to excessively low blood sugar<br>
(hypoglycemia). Inhibition of DPP-IV is therefore expected to increase insulin without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia, which is a dangerous side effect associated with the use of insulin secretogogues<br><br>
Compounds, which are inhibitors of the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV ("DPP-4") enzyme, approved as drugs for the treatment of diabetes and particularly Type II diabetes are Sitagliptin of Merck and Vildagliptin of Novartis. To date, many candidate molecules, as DPP-IV inhibitors have been on clinical trials. A lot of research for developing DPP-IV inhibitors has been focused on molecules in which the cyano group is bonded to the pyrrolidine ring (Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry, 2007, 7, 579-595). Representative examples of these DPP-IV inhibitors are cited in W09819998, WO00/34241, WO04/G64778, WO03/004498 and WO03/082817. WO 2005/075426 discloses compounds of the general formula (A),<br><br>

Objective<br><br>
Although DPP IV inhibitors such as Sitagliptin and Vildagliptin are approved as drugs and many more are in different stages of development, there is still a need for novel compounds that are selective over other members of the family of serine peptidases that includes quiescent cell proline dipeptidase (QPP), DPP8, and DPP9 (G. Lankas, et al., "Dipeptidyl Peptidase-IV Inhibition for the Treatment of Type II Diabetes," Diabetes, 2005, 54, 2988-2994),<br>
With an objective of developing novel DPP IV inhibitors for lowering blood glucose, free fatty acids, cholesterol and triglyceride levels in type II diabetes, treating food intake disorder (Scand J. Immunol., 1999, 50, 536-540) and treating autoimmune diseases such as <br>
multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis we focused our research to develop potent, stable and selective novel DPP IV inhibitors; efforts in this direction have led to compounds having the general formula (I).<br><br>
The main objective herein is to provide novel DPP IV inhibitors and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts that are also useful for the treatment of disorders associated with insulin resistance such as hyperglycemia, low glucose tolerance, insulin resistance (European Journal of Pharmacology, 2008, 588 325-332; European Journal of Pharmacology, 2000, 404, 239-245), obesity (69th scientific session ADA Abstract No: 543-P, 2009), lipid disorders (Diabetes. Vase, Dis. Res., 2006, 3, 159-65), dyslipidemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, low HDL levels, high LDL levels, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease [Clin. Res. Cardiol., 2009, 98, 75-79], and its sequelae, vascular restenosis, pancreatitis, abdominal obesity(69th scientific session, ADA, abstract no 543-P, 2009), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (Med. Sci. Monit., 2009, 15(4): HYT-5), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (Med Sci Monit, 2009, 15(4): HY1-5), syndrome X, polycystic ovarian syndrome and other disorders where insulin resistance is a component.<br><br>
Yet another objective is to provide novel DPP IV inhibitors and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts that are useful for the treatment of diabetic complications ("Effects of Vildagliptin twice daily vs. Sitagliptin once daily on 24-hour acute glucose fluctuations", Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications, 2009, Article in Press) such as diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic cataract and the like.<br><br>
Another objective herein is to provide novel DPP IV inhibitors and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts that are also useful for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, other inflammatory conditions (Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, 2009, 30, 600-607), neurodegenerative diseases cognition disorders, anxiolytic, analgesic (WO2009/0017015, US 7132104), Immune modulators (69th scientific session ADA Abstract No: 1948-P, 2009), Wound Healing (69th scientific session ADA, Abstract No: 596-P, 2009)<br><br>
Another objective herein is to provide novel DPP IV inhibitors and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts having enhanced activities, without toxic effects or with reduced toxic effects.<br><br>
As most of the cyanopyrrolidine class of DPP IV inhibitors are associated with inherent chemical instability due to formation of inactive diketopiperazine (Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry, 2005, 5,1623-1637), one of our objective is to provide novel DPP IV inhibitors devoid of such inherent chemical instability due to formation of inactive diketopiperazine.<br>
Yet another objective herein is to provide a process for the preparation of novel DPP IV inhibitors of the formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br><br>
