Compounds modulating PPAR activity are known inter alia from International Patent Application No. WO 03/074051, published on 12 September 2003. The compound having the formula(Formula Removed) specifically described therein.<br>
Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. The PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate gene expression and control multiple metabolic pathways. Three subtypes have been described which are PPARa, PPAR8 (also known as PPARp), and PPARy. PPARS is ubiquitously expressed. PPARa is predominantly expressed in the liver, kidney and heart. There are at least two major isoforms of PPARy. PPARyl is expressed in most tissues, and the longer isoform, PPARy2 is almost exclusively expressed in adipose tissue. The PPARs modulate a variety of physiological responses including regulation of glucose- and lipid- homeostasis and metabolism, energy balance, cell differentiation, inflammation and cardiovascular events.<br>
Approximately half of all patients with coronary artery disease have low concentrations of plasma HDL cholesterol. The atheroprotective function of HDL was first highlighted almost 25 years ago and stimulated exploration of the genetic and environmental factors that influence HDL levels. The protective function of HDL comes from its role in a process termed reverse cholesterol transport. HDL mediates the removal of cholesterol from cells in peripheral tissues including those in the atherosclerotic lesions of the arterial wall. HDL then delivers its cholesterol to the liver and sterol-metabolizing organs for conversion to bile and elimination. Data from the Framingham study showed that HDL-C levels are predictive of coronary artery disease risk independently of LDL-C levels. The estimated age-adjusted prevalence among Americans age 20 and older who have HDL-C of less than 35 mg/dl is 16% (males) and 5.7% (females). A substantial increase of HDL-C is currently achieved by treatment with niacin in various formulations. However, the substantial side-effects limit the therapeutic potential of this approach.<br>
As many as 90% of the 14 million diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients in the US are overweight or obese, and a high proportion of type 2 diabetic patients have abnormal concentrations of lipoproteins. The prevalence of total cholesterol &gt; 240 mg/dl is 37% in diabetic men and 44% in women. The respective rates for LDL-C &gt; 160 mg/dl are 31% and 44%, respectively, and for HDL-C 
First line treatment for dyslipidemia and diabetes generally involves a low-fat and low-glucose diet, exercise and weight loss. However, compliance can be moderate, and as the disease progresses, treatment of the various metabolic deficiencies becomes necessary with e.g. lipid-modulating agents such as statins and fibrates for dyslipidemia and hypoglycemic drugs, e.g. sulfonylureas or metformin for insulin resistance. A promising new class of drugs has recently been introduced that resensitizes patients to their own insulin (insulin sensitizers), thereby restoring blood glucose and triglyceride levels to normal, and in many cases, obviating or reducing the requirement for exogenous insulin. Pioglitazone (Actos™) and rosiglitazone (Avandia™) belong to the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of PPARy-agonists and were the first in their class to be approved for NIDDM in several countries. These compounds, however, suffer from side effects, including rare but severe liver toxicity (as seen with troglitazone). They also increase body weight in patients. Therefore, new, more efficacious drugs with greater safety and<br>
lower side effects are urgently needed. Recent studies provide evidence that agonism of PPAR8 would result in compounds with enhanced therapeutic potential, i. e. such compounds should improve the lipid profile, with a superior effect on HDL-C raising compared to current treatments and with additional positive effects on normalization of insulin-levels (Oliver et al; Proc Nat Acad Sci USA 2001; 98: 5306-11). Recent observations also suggest that there is a independent PPARcc mediated effect on insulin-sensitization in addition to its well known role in reducing triglycerides (Guerre-Millo et al; J Biol Chem 2000; 275: 16638-16642). Thus selective PPAR6 agonists or PPAR8 agonists with additional PPARa activity may show superior therapeutic efficacy without the side-effects such as the weight gain seen with PPARy agonists.<br>
The novel compounds of the present invention exceed the compounds known in the art, inasmuch as they bind to and selectively activate PPAR5 or coactivate PPAR8 and PPARa simultaneously and very efficiently, and with much improved pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, these compounds combine the anti-dyslipidemic and anti-glycemic effects of PPAR8 and PPARa activation with no effect on PPARy. Consequently, HDL cholesterol is increased, triglycerides lowered (=improved lipid profile) and plasma glucose and insulin are reduced (=insulin sensitization). In addition, such compounds may also lower LDL cholesterol, decrease blood pressure and counteract inflammatory atherosclerosis. Furthermore, such compounds may also be useful for treating inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and psoriasis. Since multiple facets of combined dyslipidemia and the T2D disease syndrome are addressed by PPARS-selective agonists and PPAR8 and a coagonists, they are expected to have an enhanced therapeutic potential compared to the compounds already known in the art.<br>
The compounds of the present invention further exhibit improved pharmacological properties compared to known compounds.<br>

6-Hydroxyindols 1 and the regioisomeric 4- and 5-hydroxyindols are commercially available, known or can be synthesized by methods known in the art. The hydroxy function of compounds 1 can be protected by methods described in the literature, e. g. by treating them with tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride in the presence of imidazole, preferably at room temperature in solvents like N,N-dimethylformamide, to obtain the corresponding tert-butyldimethylsilyl ethers 2 (step a). N-Alkylation of intermediates 2 with carboxylic acid ester 3, where R14 can be equal to e. g. chlorine, bromine, triflate, or another leaving group, delivers indoles 4 and can be performed by standard technology; e. g. in the presence of K2CO3 or Cs2CO3 at temperatures between 10 °C and the reflux temperature of the solvent in a solvent like acetonitrile or acetone or in the presence of sodium hydride at temperatures between -10 °C and 50 °C in a solvent like N,N-dimethylformamide (step b). Ester derivatives 3 are commercially available or can be synthesized by methods known in the art. Deprotection of indoles 4 by methods described in the literature, e. g. by treatment with tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride at temperatures between -15 °C and ambient temperature in a solvent like tetrahydrofuran, provided that the protection group is a silyl ether, gives hydroxyindols 5 (step c), Aryl-thiazole compounds 6 (prepared as outlined in schemes 3-6) are condensed with hydroxyindols 5<br>
according to well known procedures: if R15 represents a hydroxy group e. g. via Mitsunobu-reaction, with triphenylphosphine and di-tert-butyl-, diisopropyl- or diethyl-azodicarboxylate as reagents, or by using tributylphosphine and N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl azodicarboxamide; this transformation is preferably carried out in a solvent like toluene, dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran at ambient temperature. Alternatively, if R15 represents a halide, mesylate or tosylate moiety, the aryl-thiazole compounds 6 can be reacted with hydroxyindols 5 in solvents like N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, acetone or methyl-ethyl ketone in the presence of a weak base like cesium or potassium carbonate at a temperature ranging from room temperature to 140 °C, preferably around 50 °C, to yield ether compounds 7 (step d).

If the aryl-thiazole compounds 6 (prepared as described in schemes 3-6) and/or the hydroxyindols 5 contain chiral centers, ester compounds 7 and carboxylic acids 8 are obtained as mixtures of diastereomers or enantiomers, which can be separated by methods well known in the art, e. g. (chiral) HPLC chromatography or crystallization.<br>
Carboxylic acid esters 7 can alternatively be synthesized via regioselective condensation of aryl-thiazoles 6 with hydroxyindols 1 under the conditions given in step d (step f) and subsequent alkylation of the obtained ethers 9 with alkylating reagents 3 as described for the synthesis of esters 4 in step b (step g).<br>

(Scheme Removed)Introduction of a protecting group at the nitrogen atom of indols 1 can be performed under standard conditions, e. g. by deprotonation with a base like n-butyllithium, preferably at -78 °C, and subsequent addition of e. g. tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride at temperatures between -78 °C and ambient temperature in solvents like tetrahydrofuran (step a). Halogenation of protected indols 2, e. g. through reaction with N-bromosuccinimide at temperatures between -78 °C and ambient temperature in solvents like tetrahydrofuran delivers 3-halo indols 3 (step b). Compounds 3 can -following halogen metal exchange, preferably with tert-butyllithium at -78 °C in solvents like tetrahydrofuran - be reacted with alkylating reagents 4 with X e. g. being a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom, preferably with alkyl iodides, at temperatures between -78 °<br>
and ambient temperature in solvents like tetrahydrofuran, to form indols 5 bearing a substituent in position 3 (step c). N-Deprotection or simultaneous N- and O-deprotection of compounds 5 leading to building blocks 6 can be performed by methods described in the literature, e. g. by treatment with tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride at temperatures between -15 °C and ambient temperature in a solvent like tetrahydrofuran, if the protecting groups are silyl ethers and/or silylated indoles (step d).<br>
Building blocks 7 carrying a chlorine, bromine or iodine substituent in position 3 can be synthesized by halogenation of indols 1, optionally carrying a protecting group at the hydroxy function, e. g. by reaction with N-chlorosuccinimide at temperatures between -15 °C and the reflux temperature of the solvent in solvents like dichloromethane or chloroform (step e).

(Scheme Removed)Thioamides 1 are known or can be prepared by methods known in the art, e. g. by treatment of the corresponding carboxamide with phosphorus pentasulfide or with Lawesson's reagent [2,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-l ,3-dithia-2,4-diphosphetane-2,4-disulfide] in a solvent like toluene at temperatures preferably between 60 °C and the reflux temperature of the solvent. Condensation of thioamides 1 with a suitable bis-electrophile, e. g. methyl 4-bromo- or 4-chloro-3-oxo-alkanoates 2, preferably in a solvent like toluene at elevated temperatures (e. g. at reflux temperature), gives thiazoles 3 carrying an acetic acid ester function at position 4 (step a) [compare PCT Int.

Thiazoles 3 can then be reduced, e. g. with lithium aluminum hydride in solvents like ether or tetrahydrofuran, to alcohols 5 with R10 = R11 = H (step c). Alternatively, alkyl groups R10 and/or R11 can be introduced into ester compounds 3 by treatment with a base like potassium tert-butoxide or sodium hydride in solvents like tetrahydrofuran or 1,2-<br>
dimethoxyethane, followed by addition of one or sequentially two different alkyl halides, a reaction preferably performed between 0 °C and 80 °C (step b). Mono and/or dialkyl ester compounds 4 can be reduced to compounds 5, e. g. with lithium aluminium hydride in ether or tetrahydrofuran (step c). Alternatively, ester compounds 4 can be transformed into compounds 5 by i) saponification to the corresponding acid; ii) treatment with R10Li, optionally in the presence of a Cu(I) salt, in ether or tetrahydrofuran to yield the alkyl ketones -COR10; iii) subsequent reaction with RnLi or lithium aluminium hydride in ether or tetrahydrofuran (step c). Optionally, an elongation of the side chain can then be performed by standard methods such as transformation of the alcohol function into a leaving group, e. g. a mesylate, ensuing treatment with cyanide, saponification and reduction, affording thiazoles 6 with an optionally substituted hydroxy-propyl function attached to position 4 (step d). Alternatively, cyano intermediates of this elongation process can be reacted with alkyl Grignard reagents R10MgX in solvents like ether or tetrahydrofuran between 0 °C and the reflux temperature of the solvent to form the corresponding R10CO- alkyl ketones, which upon treatment with an alkyllithium reagent RnLi or lithium aluminium hydride in solvents like ether or tetrahydrofuran give alcohols 6 (step d). The alcohol compounds 5 or 6 which contain one or more chiral centers can optionally be separated into optically pure antipodes by methods well known in the art, e. g. chromatography on a chiral HPLC column, or by derivatization with an optically pure acid to form esters, which can be separated by conventional HPLC chromatography and then converted back to the original alcohol. Alcohol compounds 5 or 6 correspond to or can be converted into compounds of general formula 6 (scheme 1), e. g. by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane in the presence of a base like triethylamine, preferably in a temperature range between -20 °C and room temperature, or e. g. by reaction with carbon tetrachloride or carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in solvents like tetrahydrofuran, preferably in a temperature range between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents. By appropriately combining the above outlined methods, substituents R10 and R11 in 5 and 6 can be varied independently.<br>
Scheme 4<br>
(Scheme Removed)Thioamides 1 can be reacted with 2-halo acetoacetates 2 in solvents like ethanol, preferably at reflux temperature, to give thiazole-carboxylic esters 3 (step a). 2-Halo acetoacetates 2 are known or can be prepared by methods known in the art [compare PCT Int. Appl. (2002), WO 02/062774 Al]. Reduction of these esters 3, preferably using lithium aluminum hydride in a solvent like ether or tetrahydrofuran, preferably between 0 °C and room temperature, gives primary alcohols 4 (step b), which can be used as such or can be converted into the corresponding halides 5, e. g. by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane in the presence of 2,6-lutidine, preferably between -20 °C and the reflux temperature of dichloromethane [compare PCT Int. Appl. (2002), WO 02/28433], by treatment with thionyl chloride in a solvent like dichloromethane or chloroform, preferably at temperatures between -20 °C and +50 °C, or by treatment with tetrabromomethane and triphenylphosphine in solvents like tetrahydrofuran at temperatures between 0 °C and the reflux temperature of<br>
tetrahydrofuran (step c). Esters 3 can be further converted into tertiary alcohols 6 with R10 = R11 through reaction with alkyl organometallic reagents, preferably using alkyl Grignard compounds in a solvent like tetrahydrofuran or ether, preferably between -15 °C and the reflux temperature of the solvent [compare PCT Int. Appl. (2002), WO 02/062774 Al] (step d). Alcohols 6 with R10 not equal to R11 can be prepared by a sequential procedure: i) saponification to the acid; ii) treatment with R10Li, optionally in the presence of a Cu(I) salt, in ether or tetrahydrofuran to yield the alkyl ketones -COR10; iii) subsequent reaction with RnLi or lithium aluminium hydride in ether or tetrahydrofuran (step d). Primary alcohols 4 can be oxidized to aldehydes 7 by methods known in the art, e. g. by treatment with pyridinium chlorochromate in dichloromethane, preferably at temperatures between room temperature and the reflux temperature of dichloromethane, or by treatment with manganese dioxide in solvents like dichloromethane, preferably at room temperature (step e). These aldehydes 7 can be converted to the corresponding secondary alcohols 8 through reaction with alkyl organometallic compounds, preferably under the conditions given for the transformation of esters 3 to tertiary alcohols 6 (step f).<br>
Reaction of thioamides 1 with 2-halo 1,3-diketones 9 in solvents like ethanol, preferably at reflux temperature, gives thiazole ketones 10 (step g). Alternatively, ketones 10 can be obtained from secondary alcohols 8 by methods known in the art, e. g. by treatment with Cr(VI) reagents like the Jones reagent (Jones et al., J. Chem. Soc. 1953, 2548.) (step i). These ketones 10 can be reduced to the corresponding secondary alcohols 8 by methods known in the art, e. g. by treatment with sodium borohydride in alcohol, preferably at temperatures between -15 °C and 40 °C (step h). This reaction can also be carried out in an enantioselective fashion leading to the (R)- or (S)-alcohols 8, e. g. by treatment with borane-dimethylsulfide complex and (S)- or (R)-2-methyl-CBS-oxazaborolidine as chiral catalyst in tetrahydrofuran, preferably at temperatures between -78 °C and ambient temperature, according to Corey et al. (E. J. Corey, R. K. Bakshi, S. Shibata, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987, 109, 5551-5553), or by treatment with (+)- or (-)-B-chlorodiisopinocampheylborane (DIP-C1), according to Brown et al. (P. V. Ramachandran, B. Gong, A. V. Teodorovic, H. C. Brown, Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 1994, 5, 1061-1074). If the alcohol compounds 4, 6, or 8 contain one or more chiral<br>
centers and are not optically pure, they can optionally be separated into optically pure antipodes by methods well known in the art, e. g. chromatography on a chiral HPLC column, or by derivatization with an optically pure acid to form esters, which can then be separated by conventional HPLC chromatography and converted back to the original alcohol.<br>
The alcohol compounds 4, 6, and 8, and the halide compound 5, correspond to or can be converted into compounds of general formula 6 (scheme 1), e. g. by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane in the presence of a base like triethylamine preferably in a temperature range between -20 °C and room temperature, or e. g. by reaction with carbon tetrachloride or carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in solvents like tetrahydrofuran, preferably in a temperature range between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents.Scheme 5<br>
(Scheme Removed)Thioamides I may be condensed with 1,3-dichloroacetone in solvents like acetone or acetonitrile between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents, followed by treatment with a strong acid, e. g. concentrated sulfuric acid, preferably at ambient temperature (step a). Alternatively, thioamides 1 are condensed with alpha-bromo or alpha-chloro ketones 4 in a solvent like ethanol, preferably at reflux temperature, to give aryl-thiazoles 5 bearing a methyl function at position 4 (step b) [compare Eur. Pat. Appl. (1987), EP 207453 A2]. Derived chloromethyl compounds 6 are obtained by treatment of these aryl-thiazoles 5 with N-chlorosuccinimide in solvents like acetonitrile, preferably at reflux temperature, (step c) [compare PCT Int. Appl. (2001), WO 0119805 Al]. Chloromethyl compounds 3 and 6 can be converted into<br>
hydroxymethyl compounds 7, e. g. by formation of the primary acetates (e. g. with acetic acid in the presence of sodium iodide, potassium carbonate at elevated temperature) and subsequent saponification (e. g. with lithium hydroxide in ethanol / water at room temperature) (step d). Hydroxymethyl compounds 7 can be oxidized in one step to the corresponding acids 8, e. g. by use of oxidizing agents like chromic acid, alkali permanganate or nitric acid; alternatively, a two step procedure can be used: i) oxidation of the hydroxymethyl compounds 7 to the corresponding aldehydes using e. g. Swern conditions (oxalyl chloride / dimethylsulfoxide / triethylamine in dichloromethane, -78 °C to room temperature); ii) further oxidation to the acid compounds 8 by using e. g. sodium chlorite in an alcohol like tert-butanol and water in the presence of NaH2PO4 and 2-methyl-2-butene, preferably at room temperature (step e). Acid compounds 8 or the corresponding esters can be further transformed as described for ester 3 or the corresponding acids in scheme 4 to give the substituted alcohol compounds 9.<br>
The alcohol compounds 7 and 9 and the halide compounds 3 and 6 correspond to or can be converted into compounds of general formula 6 (scheme 1), e. g. by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane in the presence of a base like triethylamine, preferably in a temperature range between -20 °C and room temperature, or e. g. by reaction with carbon tetrachloride or carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in solvents like tetrahydrofuran preferably in a temperature range between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents. Chain elongation is feasible as detailed below in scheme 6.<br>

(Scheme Removed)Aryl-thiazole alkanols 1 with a chain length of n carbon atoms can be converted into analogues with a chain length of n+1 carbon atoms by methods well known in the art, e. g. by conversion of the primary alcohol function into a suitable leaving group, e. g. a halide (step a), reaction with cyanide ion (step b), saponification (step c) followed by reduction of the acid formed (compounds 4) to the primary alcohols 5, e. g. by using diborane in tetrahydrofuran (step d). In order to introduce substituents R10 and/or R11 different from hydrogen, cyano intermediates 3 of this elongation process can be reacted with alkyl Grignard reagents R10MgX in solvents like ether or tetrahydrofuran between 0 °C and the reflux temperature of the solvent to form the corresponding R10CO- alkyl ketones, which upon treatment with an alkyllithium reagent RHLi or lithium aluminum hydride in solvents like ether or tetrahydrofuran give alcohols 5. R10CO- alkyl ketones can also be reduced, e. g. by treatment with sodium borohydride in alcohol, preferably at temperatures between -15 °C and 40 °C. This reaction can also be carried out in an enantioselective fashion leading to the (R)- or (S)-alcohols 5, e. g. by treatment with borane-dimethylsulfide complex and (S)- or (R)-2-methyl-CBS-oxazaborolidine as chiral catalyst in tetrahydrofuran, preferably at temperatures between —78 °C and ambient temperature according to Corey et al. (E. 3. Corey, R. K. Bakshi, S. Shibata, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987, 109, 5551-5553), or by treatment with (+)- or (-)-B-chlorodiisopinocampheylborane (DIP-C1), according to Brown et al. (P. V. Ramachandran, B. Gong, A. V. Teodorovic, H. C. Brown, Tetrahedron: Asymmetry<br>
1994, 5, 1061-1074). Alternatively, alcohol compounds 5 which contain one or more chiral centers can optionally be separated into optically pure antipodes by methods well known in the art, e. g. chromatography on a chiral HPLC column, or by derivatization with an optically pure acid to form esters, which can then be separated by conventional HPLC chromatography and converted back to the original alcohol. The alcohol compounds 5 correspond to or can be transformed into compounds of general formula 6 (scheme 1), e. g. by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane in the presence of a base like triethylamine, preferably in a temperature range between -20 °C and room temperature, or e. g. by reaction with carbon tetrachloride or carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in solvents like tetrahydrofuran, preferably in a temperature range between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents.<br>
The following tests were carried out in order to determine the activity of the compounds of formula (I).<br>

Full-length cDNA clones for humans PPAR8 and PPARcc and mouse PPARy were obtained by RT-PCR from human adipose and mouse liver cRNA, respectively, cloned into plasmid vectors and verified by DNA sequencing. Bacterial and mammalian expression vectors were constructed to produce glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and Gal4 DNA binding domain proteins fused to the ligand binding domains (LBD) of PPAR8 (aa 139 to 442), PPARy (aa 174 to 476) and PPARa (aa 167 to 469). To accomplish this, the portions of the cloned sequences encoding the LBDs were amplified from the full-length clones by PCR and then subcloned into the plasmid vectors. Final clones were verified by DNA sequence analysis.<br>
Induction, expression, and purification of GST-LBD fusion proteins were performed in E. coli strain BL21(pLysS) cells by standard methods (Ref: Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley Press, edited by Ausubel et al.).<br>

Luciferase Transcriptional Reporter Gene Assays<br>
Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21 ATCC CCL10) were grown in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS at 37 °C in a 95%O2:5%CO2 atmosphere. Cells were seeded in 6 well plates at a density of 105 Cells/well and then batch-transfected with either the pFA-PPAR8-LBD, pFA-PPARy-LBD or pFA-PPARcc-LBD expression plasmids plus a reporter plasmid. Transfection was accomplished with the Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the suggested protocol. Six hours following transfection, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and seeded in 96 well plates at a density of 104 cells/well. After 24 hours to allow attachment of cells, the medium was removed and replaced with 100 ul of phenol red-free medium containing the test substances or control ligands (final DMSO concentration: 0.1%). Following incubation of the cells for 24 hours with substances, 50 µl of the supernatant was discarded and then 50 µ(0,1 of Luciferase Constant-Light Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to lyse the cells and initiate the luciferase reaction was added. Luminescence for luciferase was measured in a Packard TopCount.

(Table Removed)The compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for enteral, parenteral or topical administration. They can be administered, for example, perorally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or infusion solutions, or topically, e.g. in the form of ointments, creams or oils.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner which will be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable, into a galenical administration form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also organic carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers are, however, required in the case of soft<br>
gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, liquid waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistency-improving agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula (I) can vary within wide limits depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 1 mg to about 1000 mg, especially about 1 mg to about lOOmg, comes into consideration. Depending on the dosage it is convenient to administer the daily dosage in several dosage units.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 0.1-500mg, preferably 0.5-100 mg, of a compound of formula (I).<br>
