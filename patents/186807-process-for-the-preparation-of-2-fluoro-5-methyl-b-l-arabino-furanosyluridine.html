				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF<br>
2'-FLUORO-5-METHYL- ß -L-ARABINO-<br>
FURANOSYTURIDINE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for preparing 2'-fluoro-5-methyl-;?-L-arabinofuranosyluridine(generic name: Levovir, hereinafter referred to as "L-FMAU") represented by formula (1), which shows anti-viral activity, especially potent anti-viral activity against hepatitis B-virus(HBV) and Epstein-Bar virus(EBV):<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Various nucleoside compounds, including L-FMAU of formula (1) have been disclosed (see, for example, International PubUcation No. WO 95/20595):<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>
R' represents purine or pyrimidine base; and<br>
R"    represents    hydrogen,    acyl,    alkyl,    monophosphate,    diphosphate    or<br>
triphosphate.<br>
Nucleoside compounds of formula (2) exhibit anti-viral activity against BDBV and EBV. Among these nucleoside compounds, L-FMAU shows particularly potent anti-viral activity against HBV and EBV with very- low cytotoxicity and is, therefore, preferred as an anti-viral agent. Nucleoside compounds of formula (2), including L-FMAU, are useful in the prevention and treatment of HBV infections and related conditions, such as anti-HBV antibody positive and HBV-positive conditions, chronic hver inflammation caused by HBV, cirrhosis, acute hepatitis, fulminant hepatitis, chronic persistent hepatitis, and fatigue. In addition, they can also be used for the treatment of EBV-associated disorders.<br>
According to the method disclosed in International Publication No. WO 95/20595, L-FMAU of formula (1) may be prepared using L-xylose of formula (3) as a starting material :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
L-xylose of formula (3) cannot be obtained from natural substances and must therefore be produced by synthetic methods. When L-x&gt;iose is used as the starting material, the production cost of L-FMAU is therefore very high.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
It has been discovered that L-FMAU can be economically prepared from L-arabinose, which is present in many natural substances and, thus, is an inexpensive starting material, thereby completing the present invention.<br><br>
In accordance with the present invention there is disclosed a process for preparing 2'-fluoro-5-<br>
methyl-(3-L-arabino-furaranosyluridine	(L-FMAU) of formula (1)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
from L-arabinose of formula (4)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
comprising the following steps:<br>
(i).   inverting the CT hydroxyl group of the compound of formula (4) from an arabinose configuration (up) to a ribose (down) configuration via an oxidation and reduction reaction at C2 center, wherein R is benzoyl, aryl or aralkyl to obtain a ribopyranose intermediate;<br>
(ii).   converting the ribopyranose intermediate to ribofuranose intermediate under acidic conditions as herein described;<br>
(iii).   displacing the protected hydroxy! group at C2 (ribo configuration) of the ribofuranose intermediate via fluorination reaction carried out in a condition as herein described to provide a 2'-fluoro substituent in the arabinose configuration which further provides the Ci halogenated 2'-tluoroarabinofuranose intermediate ;<br>
(iv).   condensing the said Ci halogenated 2'-fluoroarabinofuranose intermediate with a base to provide a precursor of a compound of formula (1).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An improved process for preparing 2'-tluoro-5-methyl-P-L-arabino-furanosyluridihe (L-FMAU) is disclosed which uses L-arabinose as the starting material.<br>

The process of the present invention is explained in more detail below.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 1, by reacting the starting material, L-arabinose of formula (4), with an alcohol of formula (18), for example, benzyl alcohol, in the presence of hydrogen chloride gas, the 1-hydroxy group of L-arabinose is protected to produce the compound of formula (5).<br>
In reaction b), the compound of formula (5) prepared in the reaction a) is condensed with a propane derivative of formula (19), for example, 2,2-dimethoxypropane, to produce the compound of formula (6).

rubidium-silica/hydrogen,    etc.	Among    them,    sodium    borohydride<br>
(NaBILi) is particularly preferred.<br>
In reaction c), the compound of formula (8) is treated with an acid<br>
such as trifluoroacetic acid to remove the hydroxy-protecting group of<br>
the compoundO) and thereby produce the compound of formula (9), which<br>
is then treated with the compound of formula (18) in the presence of an<br>
acid, for example, methanol in the presence of hydrochloric acid to<br>
produce the compound of formula (10), which has a ribofuranose<br>
structure.	The   compound   of   formula   (10)   is   then   reacted   with   an<br>
acylchloride such as benzoyl chloride in the presence of a base to protect all the hydroxy groups of the compound of formula (10) with benzoyl groups, thereby producing the compound of formula (11). The compound of formula (11) is then treated with an acid such as acetic acid and anhydrous acetic acid in the presence of sulfuric acid to produce the compound of formula (12). The series of reaction steps for preparing the compound of formula (12) from the compound of formula (8) can preferably be practiced consecutively, without isolation of any intermediate.<br>
In reaction d), the compound of formula (12) produced in reaction c) is treated with hydrogen chloride in a solvent such as dichloromethane, cyclohexane, chloroform, etc., and then treated with water in a solvent such as acetonitrile to produce the compound of formula (13). In this reaction, the reaction by-product 1-hydroxy-isomer must be removed by treating with an ether such as dibutyl ether, diethyl ether, etc.<br>
In reaction e), the compound of formula (13) is reacted with an agent for introducing a suitable reactive leaving group, for example, sulfuryl chloride and imidazole, to produce the compound of formula (14). This reaction can be carried out in the presence of a solvent such as dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, etc.<br>
In reaction f), the compound of formula (14) produced in reaction e)   is   fluorinated   in   the   presence   of   a   solvent   such   as   ethyl   acetate,<br>
thereby substituting the reactive leaving group with fluorine to produce<br>
the compound of formula (15). In this reaction, the preferred fluori-<br>
nating agent includes potassium hydrogen fluoride (PCHF2)/hydrofluoric<br>
acid/pyridine   or   hydrofluoric   acid/amine   such   as   triethylamine.	The<br>
resulting compound of formula (15) is then halogenated, for example, with hydrobromic acid or hydrochloric acid, in the presence of acetic acid to produce the compound of formula (16). The compound of formula (16) is then reacted with thymine base in the presence of hexamethyl-disilazane and ammonium sulfate to produce the compound of formula (17). This reaction can preferably be carried out in the presence of a solvent, for example, chloroform, dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, acetonitrile, etc.<br>
In reaction g), the compound of formula (17) produced in reaction f) is treated with ammonia in the presence of a solvent to remove the benzoyl group, the hydroxy-protecting group, from rhe compound of formula (17), thereby producing the desired compound L-FMAU.<br>

Other reactants can be used as known to those of ordinary sldll, which perform substantially the same function. In the examples, the number of the compound in parentheses corresponds to the number in the reaction scheme A.<br>
Example 1 : Preparation of l-Q-benzvI-/g-L-arabinoside (5)<br>
Benzyl alcohol lOOOm^ was saturated with hydrogen chloride for 40 minutes at 0°C, 200g(1.33 mole) of L-arabinose was added and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 hours, during which a quantity of the compound (5) precipitated. To induce additional precipitation, 1.5 £ of ethyl acetate was slowly added while the mixture was stirred. The resulting solid product was filtered, washed with ethyl acetate and then dried in air to obtain 300g (Yield : 94%) of the title compound (5) in the form of a white solid.<br>

Example    2    :    Preparation    of    l-0-benzvl-3.4-0-isopropvlidene- B -L-riboside (8)<br>
A mixture of 200g(0.83 mole) of 1-0-benzyl-/9-L-arabinoside (5), 240i!}£(1.95 mole) of 2,2-dimethoxypropane and 4g(0.02 mole) of p-TsOH • H2O in 2000m£ of acetone was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. The reaction mixture thereby obtained was neutralized with triethylamine and evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain the compound (6) in the form of a yellowish syrup, which was used for the next reaction without further purification.<br>
To a mixture of the compound (6) and 240g(0.63 mole) of<br>
pyridinium dichromate in 2000m£ of dichloromethane was added 240m£(2.54<br>
mole) of acetic anhydride at 0°C and the mixture thereby obtained was<br>
then refluxed until the starting material disappeared (ca. 4 hours). At<br>
this time, the system was vented. The solvent was removed under<br>
reduced pressure until the mixture occupied one-third of its initial volume<br>
and the residue was poured into 1500m£ of ethyl acetate with vigorous<br>
stirring   accomplished   using   a   mechanical   stirrer.	The   mixture   thus<br>
obtained was filtered through a celite pad and the filter cake was<br>
thoroughly washed with ethyl acetate. The blackish combined filtrate<br>
was filtered through a siUca gel (2-20 micron) column (20cm height, 10cm<br>
diameter).	The   silica   gel   was   washed   with   ethyl   acetate   until   the<br>
compound (7) was no longer detected by TLC. The clear combined filtrate thereby obtained was evaporated to yield the compound (7) in the form of a syrup, which was coevaporated twice with toluene.<br>
The purified syrup (7) thus obtained was dissolved in 2000m£ of methanol and cooled to -20°C. 40g(1.06 mole) of NaBEU pellets were very slowly added to the resulting solution over 3 hours at -20°C.     After<br>
completion of the reaction, the solution was neutralized with acetic acid, evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain a white solid residue. The residue was partitioned between lOOOM of ethyl acetate and 200m£ of water. The aqueous layer was extracted with 100m£ of ethyl acetate. The combined organic layer was washed with 200m£ of brine, dried over MgS04 and then evaporated to yield a white solid, which was recrystallized from 700m£ of hot hexane to yield 123g (Yield : 53% from the compound (5)) of the compound (8) in the form of a white crystal.<br>

Example 3 ■ Preparation of l-0-acetvl-2.3.5-tri-0-benzovl-^-L-ribofuranose (12)<br>
201g(0.717 mole) of the compound (8) dissolved in 1000m£ of 4% trifluoroacetic acid(CF3C00H) was refluxed until the starting material (ca. 1 hour) and the intermediate (1-O-benzyl derivative) had disappeared (ca. 4-8 hours). The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and washed with dichloromethane (4X500iii£) to remove benzyl alcohol. The aqueous layer thereby obtained was evaporated in vacuo and coevaporated with toluene (2x200m£) to yield the compound (9) in the form of a yellowish syrup, which was completely dried tmder high vacuum to remove a trace amount of water.<br>
The compound (9) was dissolved in 2000in£ of methanol and<br>
15.8g(0.43 mole) of HCl (gas) was bubbled into the mixture at room<br>
temperature.	The   mixture    thereby    obtained   was    stirred    at   room<br>
temperature for 2 hours, neutralized with 183m£ of pyridine and concentrated in vacuo at 30-35°C to give a yellowish syrup, which was in turn coevaporated with pyridine to yield the compound  (10) in the form<br>
of a yellowish synrup. The compound (10) was dissolved in 800in£ of<br>
pyridine and 212ni£ of benzoyl chloride was added dropwise to the mixture<br>
at   0°C.	The   mixture   was   stirred   at  room   tem.perature  for  8   hours.<br>
After the reaction had gone almost to completion, the mixture was heated at 45 "C for 1.5 hour. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and ice was added to remove the remaining benzoyl chloride. Pyridine was evaporated from the mixture at 35-40 °C until the mixture occupied half of its initial volume. The residue was dissolved in 1500m£ of ethyl acetate, which was washed in succession with 500m£ of cold water, 576ni£ of cold 3N H2SO4, 500m£ of aqueous sodium bicarbonate (x2), and 500m.2 of brine, in that order. The organic layer was dried over MgS04 and activated carbon, filtered through a silica gel (2-20/^) pad and evaporated to obtain the compound (11) in the form of a yellowish syrup.<br>
To a mixture of the compound (11) dissolved in 144m£(2.52 mole)<br>
of acetic acid and 334m£(3.54 mole) of acetic anhydride, 48m£(0.9 mole) of<br>
C-H2SO4 was slowly added dropwise at 0°C, during which crystallization<br>
occurred. The mixture was brought to room temperature and kept in a<br>
refrigerator   overnight.	The   mixture   was   poured   into   700m£   of   an<br>
ice-water mixture, filtered and the filter cal
cold water. The solid was dissolved in 2000m^ of ethyl acetate, which<br>
was washed in succession with 500m£ of water, 500m£ of saturated sodium<br>
bicarbonate   and   500m£   of   brine.	The   organic   layer   was   dried   over<br>
MgS04 and activated carbon and the resulting mixtrue was filtered through a silica gel (2-20/i) pad. The solvent was removed and the residue was recrystalHzed from methanol to obtain 144.7g (Yield : 40% from the compound (8)) of the compound (12) in the form of a white solid.<br>

F.Yample 4 : Preparation of 1.3,5-tri-O-benzovl-g-L-ribofuranose 1131<br>
HCl (gas) was bubbled for 1.5 hours into a solution of 50g(99.16<br>
mmole) of the compound (12) dissolved in 460ni£ of anhydrous<br>
dichloromethane   and   7.5m^   of   acetyl   chloride   at   0°C.	The   resulting<br>
solution was kept in a refrigerator for 12 hours and then evaporated in<br>
vacuo. The residue was coevaporated with toluene (3xi50itt£) at 45°C<br>
and redissolved in 105m£ of acetonitrile. To this solution, 13m£ of water<br>
was added drop wise at 0°C. A white solid began to precipitate from the<br>
mixture after 30 minutes, after which the mixture was kept in a<br>
refrigerator   for    2   hours    to    induce    additional   precipitation.	After<br>
filtration of the resulting solid, the filter calce was carefully washed with cold diethylether to remove the reaction by-product 1-hydroxy-isomer, which is indistinguishable by TLC from the compound (13). The white solid thereby obtained was dissolved in ethyl acetate. The solution was washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate to remove the remaining HCl, dried over MgSO.i and filtered. The solvent was removed from the filtrate to obtain 29.2g (Yield : 63.7%) of the compound (13) in the form of a wliite solid.<br>

107.0g(0.232 mole) of the compound (13) was dissolved in 1070m^ of dicliloromethane and 214m^ of dimethylformamide, to which 62.5g(37.2 mi,   0.463   mole)   of   stdfuryl   chloride   was   added   dropwise   at   a   low<br>
temperature (-10 to -7813). The resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours and then cooled in an ice-bath. The solution was stirred while 157.8g(2.32 mole) of imidazole was added portionwise at the rate keeping the temperature of reaction mixture under 5°C. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20 hours, after which 400nv£ of ice-water was added. The aqueous layer was extracted three times with 100m£ of dichloromethane (SxlOOnve). The combined organic solution was washed with 200M of brine and dried over MgS04. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and dimethylformamide was removed under high vaccum. The syrupy residue was coevaporated with 100m£ of 2-propanol under reduced pressure to obtain a white soUd product (14), which was used for the next reaction without further purification.<br>

A mixture of the imidazolate (14) obtained from Example 5,<br>
224.lg( 1.39 mole) of triethyIamine-3HF and 824[n£ of ethyl acetate was<br>
heated at 80°C for 3 hours, 70.3g(92.5iii£, 0.696 mole) of triethylamine was<br>
slowly added thereto and the mixture thereby obtained was stirred for<br>
one additional hour at the same temperature, after which the mixture was<br>
cooled to room temperature. The resulting solution was poured into<br>
ice-water containing NaHCOs to neutralize it to pH 7. The aqueous<br>
layer was extracted three times with lOOm^ of ethyl acetate (3xi00m£).<br>
The combined organic solution was washed with brine and dried over<br>
Na2S04. The solvent was removed and the residue was redissolved in<br>
300n]g of dichloromethane, filtered through a silica gel pad and washed<br>
with dichloromethane. The solvent was removed to obtain 101.Og of<br>
crude 2-fluoro-sugar product (15), which was redissolved in 150m£ of<br>
dichloromethane.	195.9m£(88.2g,   1.09   mole)   of  hydrobromic   acid/acetic<br>
acid(45% w/v) was added to the solution at 0°C and then stirred at room temperature for 15 hours. The resulting solution was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure to give a syrup, which was coevaporated with toluene (3xi00m£) to obtan the sugar bromide (16) in the form of a<br>
semisolid,   which   was   then  redissolved   in  200[n£   of  chloroform  for   the condensation reaction described below.<br>
A mixture of 55.44g(0.44 mole) of thymine, 5g of ammonium sulfate{(NH4)2S04) and 212.5g(278.9Di£, 1.32 mole) of hexamethyldisilazane in 1900tii£ of chloroform was refluxed for 24 hours to give a nearly clear solution. A solution of sugar bromide (16) in chlorofonn was added and the resulting mixture was refluxed for additional 24 hours and then cooled to room temperature. 200ni£ of water was added to the reaction mixture, which was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes and then filtered. The organic layer was separated, dried over Na2S04, and filtered through a celite pad, which was then washed with ethyl acetate. The combined organic solution was evaporated to give a solid which was recrystallized from 100iii£ of ethanol to obtain 78.Og (Yield : 69.5% from the alcohol compound (13)) of 3,5-0-dibenzoyl L-FIVIAU (17) in the form of a crystal.<br>
