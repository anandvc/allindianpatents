				<td>SODA-LIME-SILICA GLASS COMPOSITION, ESPECIALLY FOR PRODUCING<br>
SUBSTRATES.<br>
The present invention relates to glass compositions that can be converted into a<br>
glass ribbon, especially by the « float» process, from which ribbon heat-resistant glass<br>
plates can be cut. These plates can be used especially for the production of substrates used<br>
in the manufacture of emissive displays, such as plasma displays, electroluminescent<br>
displays and cold-cathode displays or FEDs (Field Emission Displays), or in the<br>
manufacture of fire-resistant glazing.<br>
The glass employed for producing such substrates is a glass belonging to the<br>
family of soda-lime-silica glasses, commonly used for forming the glazing intended for<br>
buildings or for motor vehicles. Although this type of glass is satisfactory as regards<br>
chemical resistance, flatness and the defects that it contains, the level of performance in<br>
terms of ability to undergo yellowing proves, however, to be insufficient for the intended<br>
application.<br>
In the manufacture of emissive displays, the substrate is subjected to several<br>
treatments for the purpose of stabilizing its dimensions and for attaching a series of layers<br>
of various compounds, such as enamels, that are deposited on its surface. To attach these<br>
layers of variable thicknesses, the substrate is in general heat treated at a temperature<br>
above 550°C. In this regard, it is important to ensure that the expansion coefficient of the<br>
glass used is of the same order of magnitude as that of the compounds deposited on its<br>
surface so as to prevent the appearance of crazing. Although soda-lime-silica glass<br>
generally has a suitable expansion coefficient, its temperature withstand capability is,<br>
however, insufficient and it is necessary to place it on a ground slab to avoid any<br>
deformation during the heat treatments.<br>
Moreover, it has been observed that substrates made of soda-lime-silica glass<br>
bearing heat-treated silver-based layers have a tendency to develop a yellow coloration.<br>
This yellowing phenomenon is attributed to the migration of Ag+ ions into the glass, which<br>
ions are then reduced to the form of colloidal Ag0 particles that absorb light in the<br>
wavelength range from 390 to 420 nanometers. The yellowing of the glass is a contributory<br>
factor in degrading the quality of the image.<br>
The glasses used for the manufacture of fire-resistant glazing belonging to the<br>
category of borosilicate glasses. Such glasses, which exhibit good resistance to heat and<br>
heat shocks, are characterized by a relatively low expansion coefficient. As a result, the<br>
mechanical strength of this type of glass cannot be significantly improved by thermal<br>
toughening as the development of high stresses in the glass is not allowed.<br>
Glass compositions for obtaining plates or substrates with virtually zero<br>
deformation during heat treatments of around 550 to 600°C and capable of undergoing<br>
thermal toughening are disclosed in WO-A-96/11887. These are glass compositions having<br>
the desired properties for plasma displays, which use little or no alumina Al2O3 (0 to 18<br>
%), having a high content (6.5 to 20 %) of zirconia ZrO2 and an SiO2 content not<br>
exceeding 63%.<br>
Compositions for providing thermally stable substrates which combine alumina (0<br>
to 5%) and zirconia (5 to 10%) are also disclosed in FR-A-2 578 550.<br>
However, with one or other of the compositions, the glass yellowing phenomenon<br>
persists. There is therefore a need for improved glass compositions that make it possible to<br>
obtain glasses having the lowest possible degree of yellowing.<br>
The object of the present invention is to propose a glass composition for<br>
manufacturing a plate or a substrate which exhibits improved resistance to yellowing and<br>
retains the abovementioned properties, in particular a thermal expansion coefficient a at<br>
least equivalent to that of known soda-lime-silica glasses.<br>
The subject of the invention is a glass composition intended for the manufacture<br>
of thermally stable substrates or plates that comprises the constituents given below, in the<br>
following proportions by weight:<br>
SiO2 67 - 75 %<br>
Al2O3 0.5 - 1 %<br>
ZrO2 2 - 7 %<br>
Na2O 2 - 9 %<br>
K2O 4-11 %<br>
MgO 0 - 5 %<br>
CaO 5 - 10 %<br>
SrO 5-12 %<br>
BaO 0-3 %<br>
B2O3 0 - 3 %<br>
Li2O 0 - 2 %<br>
with the relationships :<br>
Na2O + K2O &gt; 10%<br>
MgO + CaO + SrO + BaO &gt; 12 %<br>
and said composition having a thermal expansion coefficient between 80 and 90 x 10-7/°C,<br>
especially less than 85 x 10-7/°C, and preferably between 81 and 84 x 10-7/°C.<br>
The substrates or plates obtained from the compositions according to the<br>
invention are capable of undergoing the heat treatments needed for their application, for<br>
example as a plasma display, and have a lower degree of yellowing compared with<br>
soda-lime-silica glasses. The improvement in aging of the glass, consisting in limiting the<br>
appearance of yellow coloration, is not, however, obtained to the detriment of the other<br>
properties of the glass.<br>
The reduction in yellowing stems from the choice of a high SiO2 content (equal or<br>
greater than 67 %), a very low Al2O3 content (0.5 to 1 %) and a low ZrO2 content (2 to 7<br>
%). By virtue of the combination of the constituents, as results from the definition of the<br>
invention, it is possible to obtain glasses having a thermal expansion coefficient that<br>
remains the same order of magnitude as that of a conventional soda-lime-silica glass,<br>
namely between 80 and 90 x 10-7/°C, especially less than 85 x 10-7/°C, and preferably<br>
between 81 and 84 x 10-7/°C measured at a temperature between 20 and 300°C.<br>
The combination of the aforementioned constituents also makes it possible to<br>
obtain glasses having a strain point above 570°C, preferably 580°C, which temperature is<br>
at least about 70°C higher than that of a conventional soda-lime-silica glass. It is known<br>
that the glass no longer exhibits any viscous behavior above the strain point corresponding<br>
to the temperature at which the glass has a viscosity of the order of 1014.5 poise. Thus, the<br>
strain point is a useful reference point for evaluating the temperature withstand capability<br>
of a glass. The strain point of the glasses according to the invention is comparable to that<br>
obtained for other known glasses for producing displays (see WO 96/11 887 and FR 2 758<br>
550).<br>
The glasses according to the invention have in general a density at 25°C of less<br>
than 3, preferably around 2.7, similar to that of the existing glasses used for manufacturing<br>
displays.<br>
The glasses according to the invention are well suited to the melting techniques<br>
associated with the float process, in which the glass floats on a bath of molten metal,<br>
especially tin. They cause only very slight corrosion of the refractories, of the AZS<br>
(alumina-zirconia-silica) type, that are normally employed in this type of furnace.<br>
The glasses according to the invention can be easily melted and converted into<br>
glass ribbon at temperatures of the same order as those used for the manufacture of a<br>
conventional soda-lime-silica glass.<br>
Thus, they generally have a liquidus temperature Tliq corresponding to the melting<br>
point of the batch materials of at most 1180°C, especially between 1130 and 1170°C.<br>
These glasses also have a temperature of at least 1160°C, especially between 1160 and<br>
1200°C at which the viscosity r| (in poise) is such that log? = 3.5. For a person skilled in<br>
the art, this temperature corresponds to the ideal viscosity for forming the glass.<br>
The compositions according to the invention have a "working range", defined by<br>
the temperature difference Tlog ? = 3.5 - Tliq (corresponding to the temperature range allowing<br>
the glass to be melted and formed), of at least 10 to 30°C. This working range, although<br>
narrow, is sufficient for ensuring proper forming without a major risk especially in the<br>
operation of the furnace.<br>
The role of the constituents employed in the glass composition according to the<br>
invention is defined below.<br>
SiO2 plays an essential role. Its content is necessarily equal to or greater than 67<br>
%, without however exceeding 75 %; above this, the melting of the charge and the<br>
refining of the glass require high temperatures, which cause premature wear of the furnace<br>
refractories. Below 67% by weight of silica, the performance of the glass, especially in<br>
terms of yellowing, is reduced. The glasses that are best suited to the conditions of floating<br>
on a bath of molten metal, and have the best properties, contain between 67 and 71% SiO2.<br>
Alumina acts as a stabilizer. It contributes to increasing the chemical resistance of<br>
the glass and the strain point.<br>
ZrO2 also acts as a stabilizer. This oxide increases the chemical resistance of the<br>
glass to a certain extent and helps to increase the strain point. The percentage of ZrO2<br>
generally does not exceed 7% so as not to penalize the melting operation. Although this<br>
oxide is difficult to melt, it has the advantage of increasing only moderately the viscosity<br>
of the glasses according to the invention at high temperatures, unlike the other oxides such<br>
as silica or alumina. The use of the ZrO2 makes it possible avoid introducing oxides such<br>
as B2O3 into these glasses or to increase the amount of alkali metal oxides, one of the<br>
effects of these oxides being to reduce the viscosity of the glass.<br>
Alumina and zirconia fulfill quite similar roles : the sum of the Al2O3 and ZrO2<br>
contents is preferably less than 6 %.<br><br>
The oxides Na2O and K2O allow the melting point of the glasses and the viscosity<br>
at high temperatures to be maintained within the abovementioned limits. To do this, the<br>
sum of these oxides remains equal to or greater than 10 %, preferably between 10 and 15<br>
%. Compared with a conventional soda-lime-silica glass, the presence of Na2O and K2O<br>
makes it possible for their chemical resistance, especially their hydrolytic resistance, and<br>
their resistivity to be considerably increased. When it is desired to increase the overall<br>
content of Na2O and K2O, it is preferable that it be the K2O content that increases, as this<br>
allows the glass to be thinned without excessively lowering the strain point.<br>
Advantageously, the weight ratio of the Na2O content to the K2O content is less than or<br>
equal to 0.7.<br>
The alkaline-earth oxides have the overall effect of raising the strain point: as a<br>
general rule, their total content, especially the total content of MgO, CaO, SrO, and BaO, is<br>
greater than 12 %, preferably greater than or equal to 15 %.<br>
Above about 15 %, the ability of the glasses to devitrify increases and may<br>
become incompatible with the conditions for manufacturing the glass by floating on a bath<br>
of molten metal. It is essentially CaO and MgO that allow the value of the strain point to<br>
be increased.<br>
To maintain devitrification of the glasses within acceptable limits, the CaO and<br>
MgO weight contents do not exceed 5 % and 10 %, respectively.<br>
BaO and SrO are used to increase the chemical resistance of the glass and BaO<br>
also has the effect of reducing the melting point and the viscosity at high temperatures.<br>
Boron oxide, B2O3, is optional. This network-former oxide may be added to or<br>
substituted for SiO2. It reduces the melting point of the charge and the viscosity of the<br>
glass at high temperatures. It also reduces the ability of the glass to devitrify, particularly<br>
by preventing a rise in the liquidus temperature.<br>
Lithium oxide, Li2O, is also optional. It may be introduced into the glass in an<br>
amount not exceeding 2 % and has the effect in particular of lowering the melting point.<br>
Overall, the melting of the glasses according to the invention remains within<br>
acceptable temperature limits provided that the sum of the SiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2 contents<br>
remains equal to or less than 83 %, preferably 80 %. The term "acceptable limits" is<br>
understood to mean here that the temperature of the glass corresponding to a viscosity tj,<br>
such that log? = 2 does not exceed about 1560°C and preferably 1550°C.<br>
The preferred glass compositions according to the invention comprise the<br>
constituents below in the following proportions :<br>
SiO2 67 - 75 %<br>
Al2O3 0.5 - 1 %<br>
ZrO2 2 - 5 %<br>
Na2O 2 - 4 %<br>
K2O 7-11 %<br>
MgO 0 - 2 %<br>
CaO 6 - 10 %<br>
SrO 6-12 %<br>
BaO 0 - 2 %<br>
B2O3 0 - 3 %<br>
Li2O 0 - 2 %.<br>
The glass compositions according to the invention can be used for the<br>
manufacture of heat-resistant plates, especially for forming substrates for plasma,<br>
electroluminescent or field-emission displays. These substrates may be obtained by cutting<br>
glass sheets from a continuous glass ribbon obtained by floating the glass on a bath of<br>
molten metal. They may have a glass thickness that varies from 0.5 mm to 10 mm.<br>
These plates may also be used for the manufacture of fire-resistant glazing, again<br>
especially obtained by cutting them from a ribbon of floated glass.<br>
The advantages afforded by the compositions according to the invention will be<br>
more fully appreciated through the illustrative examples given in Table 1 appended hereto.<br>
Examples 1 to 4 describe glass compositions according to the invention. The glass<br>
of Example 5 corresponds to a conventional soda-lime-silica glass composition used to<br>
manufacture a glass ribbon by the float process. The glass of Example 6 is a glass sold<br>
under the name PD200 by Asahi, suitable for the production of emissive displays.<br>
This table gives, for each example, the weight contents and the values of the<br>
properties of the glasses obtained, namely the strain point, the thermal expansion<br>
coefficient a25-300°c, b*, Tliq - Tlog ? = 3.5, Tlog ? = 2 and density.<br>
The value of b* is representative of the degree of yellowing of the glass. It is<br>
measured in the following manner :<br>
A film of metallic silver is deposited on the surface of the glass using the<br>
"sputtering" method. The glass is then heated to 580°C at the rate of 10°C/min, maintained<br>
at this temperature for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature at the rate of 5°C/min.<br>
The glass is immersed in an HNO3 solution in order to remove the silver film. The<br><br>
chromatic coordinate b* is measured under illuminant D65 taking the colorimetric reference<br>
observer described by the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) 1931.<br>
The other properties were measured using methods well known to those skilled in<br>
the art.<br>
As Examples 1 to 4 show, the degree of yellowing after heat treatment of the<br>
glasses according to the invention is markedly lower than that of the soda-lime-silica glass<br>
of Example 5 or of the display glass of Example 6.<br>
It should be noted that the coefficient a retains a satisfactory value, of greater than<br>
80 x 10-7/°C, comparable to the aforementioned reference glasses.<br>
The strain point of the glasses according to the invention is much higher than that<br>
of the soda-lime-silica glass and is improved over the display glass.<br>
Moreover, the glasses according to the invention are manufactured under the float<br>
process conditions without any problems, whether as regards melting in the furnace or<br>
floating on the bath of molten metal, given that the difference between the temperature<br>
Tlog ? = 3.5 and the liquidus temperature Tliq remains positive.<br>
