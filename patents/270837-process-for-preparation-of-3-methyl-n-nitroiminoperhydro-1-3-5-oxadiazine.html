OXADIAZINE<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[0001]        The present invention relates to a process for preparation of 3-methyl-N-<br>
nitroiminoperhydro-l,3,5-oxadiazine (MNIO) with improved and simplified process.<br>
MNIO prepared in accordance to the present invention can be used as an intermediate to<br>
manufacture a broad spectrum insecticide Thiamethoxam.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND THE PRIOR ART<br>
[0002]        3-methyl-N-nitroiminoperhydro-l,3,5-oxadiazine    (MNIO)    is    a   known<br>
intermediate used in the manufacture of Thiamethoxam. Thiamethoxam is a broad<br>
spectrum insecticide for pest protection for numerous crops. It is a second generation<br>
neonicotinamide insecticide belonging to the thianicotinyl sub class of chemistry.<br>
[0003]        Thiamethoxam  is  prepared  by  reacting two  intermediates:  2-chloro-5-<br>
chloromethyl thiazole (CCMT) and 3-methyl-N-nitroimino perhydro-l,3,5-oxadiazine<br>
(MNIO). MNIO is structurally represented as:<br>
Formula removed:-<br>
[0004] The methods of preparation of MNIO have been disclosed in the literature. Thiamethoxam was discovered by the Ciba group of Japan. The Ciba group synthesizes 4-nitroimino-1,3,5-oxadinazinane which they used to synthesize thiamethoxam (MMG 445 Basic Biotechnology eJournal pp. 46-52, 2006). They started with readily available S-methyl-N-nitro-isothiourea and methylamine in 50 °C ethanol and this procedure produces the mono-substituted nitroguanidine in 94% yield. The monosubstituted nitroguanidine is heated in a 1:1 mixture of aqueous formaldehyde solution and formic acid to 90°C for several hours. This procedure produces the 4-nitroimino-1,3,5-oxadinazinane in 71% yield. Alkylation of 4-nitroimino-1,3,5-oxadinazinane with 2-chlrothiazol-5-ylmethyl chloride in N,N-dimethylform-amide in the presence of potassium carbonate led to synthesis of Thiamethoxam.<br>
[0005]	The process for synthesizing MNIO starting from N-methylnitroguanidine<br>
has been described in US Patent US 5,852,012 and its divisional Patents US 7,655,650, US 5,852,012, US 6,022,871, US 6,376,487, US 6,627,753. The process for the preparation of MNIO from N-methyl nitro guanidine in the above patents is described reacting N-methyl nitroguanidine with paraformaldehyde in the presence of dioxane and toluene and using a base triethylamine. The process took place in the presence of acids like p-toluene sulfonic acid or methyl sulfonic acid as catalysts. The reaction is carried out for 18-20 hrs for the completion of the reaction.<br>
[0006]	However the process as disclosed above has considerable disadvantages.<br>
It is a lengthy process requiring around 18-20 hours for the completion of the reaction. Dioxane and toluene are to be separated in this process and triethylamine cannot be<br>
recovered. Also the process involves crystallization by methanol. This not only leads to long cycle times in a production cycle but also add to the cost to the manufacturer making the entire process lesser efficient. Further as discussed above, the process uses solvents and acid catalysts to carry out the reaction which not only add to the cost but also makes the process more complex. Furthermore the existing process nowhere discloses the repeated recycling of starting material formic acid which is again problematical from ecological and toxicological viewpoint.<br>
[0007]	There is therefore a need in the art to develop a process for preparation<br>
of MNIO with an improved and simplified synthesis which significantly reduces the time cycle in a production cycle as compared to existing methods. Moreover, such process must also significantly improve the purity of MNIO. It would also be desirable to reduce the ecological and toxicological problems arising from the existing methods. Lastly, such process must be cost-effective.<br>
