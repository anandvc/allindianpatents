				<td>AN ANASTOMOTIC DEVICE fOR JOINING OF LUMENS OR<br>
HOLLOW VISCERA WHICH IS ADAPTED TO BE DEPLOYED AT A LUMINAL<br>
INTERFACE OR TWO ADJACENT LUMENS<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to gastrointestinal and enteric (including biliary)<br>
anastomoses and the like. The woven tube of wire of the invention is a three<br>
dimensional structure wherein the outer loops or ends of the woven tube fold or loop<br>
back in a manner which holds the luminal interface of the anastomotic site into<br>
apposition at the deployment site.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Surgical procedures often require the joining (anastamosis) of two vessels or<br>
hollow vicera. For example, a permanent anastomosis between the stomach and intestine<br>
may be required in the performance of gastric bypass surgery for the morbidly obese as<br>
well as to alleviate blockage in the common bile duct by draining bile from the duct to<br>
the small intestine during surgery for pancreatic cancer. Surgical anastomosis generally<br>
involves manual suturing of the two structures. This process can be technically<br>
demanding and time consuming. This complex surgical procedure is even more<br>
challenging during minimally invasive surgery (MIS) where the surgeon is required to<br>
use instruments that are poorly designed for this task.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to a woven tube of wire for use in an automated<br>
anastomotic delivery device for surgery with special emphasis on MIS. The primary<br>
component is the woven tube of wire which deforms to make an anastomotic device<br>
when inserted into the walls of two adjacent vessels or lumens. The use of such a device<br>
for joining (anastomosing) two gastrointestinal or enteric (including biliary) vessels or<br>
lumens or the like is new.<br>
The anastomotic delivery device is designed to allow the wire mesh tube to be.<br>
slipped over a canula and pulled longitudinally, causing the tube to become longer and<br>
very small in diameter. After the wire mesh tube is loaded onto the canula, an outer<br>
sleeve is pushed over the tube up to the streamlined end of the delivery device, thereby<br>
providing a smooth surface for inserting into a vessel or lumen in the body. After the<br>
loaded canula is inserted into the appropriate vessel or lumen, a small sharp pointed wire,<br>
initially retracted in the center of the canula, is exposed at the tip (such as by pushing on<br>
a button in the handle) in order to assist the surgeon when passing the canula through the<br>
walls of the vessels or lumens. Once the canula/sleeve has penetrated both walls and is<br>
properly positioned, the outer sleeve is retracted. The wire mesh tube is constructed<br>
from a thermal, shape memory alloy such as nitinol such that when the sleeve is<br>
retracted, heat from the body causes the wire mesh tube to contract longitudinally to<br>
produce the anastomosis. This design eliminates the necessity for using a mechanical<br>
compression component in the delivery system and, therefore, reduces the complexity<br>
and size of the delivery system. Sufficient force is applied to the wall tissues such that<br><br>
the holes between the two lumens is enlarged (for drainage) and leakage outside the two<br>
lumens does not occur.<br>
Additional objects, advantages and other novel features of the invention will be<br>
set forth in part in the description that follows and in part will become apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art upon examination of the foregoing or may be learned with the practice<br>
of the invention.<br>
ACCOMPANYING<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Figure 1 is a front view of the woven tube of wire in its deployed form in which<br>
the outer loops or ends of the woven tube have deformed and everted to form petals<br>
which hold the walls of the lumens into apposition, the front and back petals of the<br>
deployed anastomotic device being shown as dark black and light gray lines,<br>
respectively.<br>
Figure 2 is a side view of the woven tube prior to being slipped over a canula of<br>
the delivery device.<br>
Figure 3A is a front view of the woven tube similar to Figure 1 with the walls of<br>
the lumens being omitted.<br>
Figure 3B is a side view of the woven tube of Figure 3A.<br>
Figure 4A shows the delivery device having the woven tube loaded and the<br>
sleeve pushed over the tube up to the end of the delivery device.<br><br>
Figure 4B shows the delivery device inserted into a body cavity to a<br>
predetermined puncture site and further shows the tip of a wire, initially retracted in the<br>
canula, passed through the walls of the lumens.<br>
Figure 4C shows the end of the delivery device passed through the walls of the<br>
lumens with the sheath partially retracted to expose the woven tube slipped over the<br>
canula.<br>
Figure 4D shows the woven tube positioned at the juncture of the opposing<br>
puncture holes in the tissue, the walls of the lumens being held in a predetermined<br>
position guided by the delivery device.<br>
Figure 4E shows the initial stage of deployment of the woven tube as the ends of<br>
the woven tube begin forming a petal configuration.<br>
Figure 4F shows the woven tube in its deployed, flattened form gripping the<br>
walls of the lumens.<br>
Figure 4G shows the delivery device being retracted from the body cavity<br>
through the opening in the flattened woven tube, the left-hand side portion of Figure 4G<br>
showing an end view of the deployed woven tube in the same manner as shown in Figure<br>
1.<br><br>
Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The tube 10 has an overlapping wire mesh design. The woven tube is designed to<br>
produce a round opening 12 between two layers of tissue 14,16 and to hold the layers of<br>
tissue together for a watertight seal. The deployed anastomic device is essentially a<br>
woven tube 10 of wire 18 that is axially compressed as shown in Figure 1.<br>
The woven tube 10 is defined by the wire diameter, number of circumferential<br>
and longitudinal openings or diamonds 20, the tube length and the center diameter. The<br>
openings or diamonds 20' at the longitudinal ends of the elongated woven tube are<br>
referred to as petals when the device is in the deployed shape (see Figure 1).<br>
In use, the woven tube is forced into an elongated form (with much smaller<br>
diameter than that shown in Figure 2), placed through openings between the wall tissues<br>
of two lumens and allowed to return to the flattened shape of Figure 1. In the process,<br>
the tissues of both lumen walls are compressed between the petals of the flattened tube<br>
(see Figure 1) with the center diameter 12 of the flattened tube forming an opening<br>
between the lumens.<br>
The woven tube can be applied, for example, through the common bile duct, and<br>
pushed through so that it connects the duct to the jejunum. After the connection has been<br>
made, the tube can be caused to deform and evert so that the ends spread out like the<br>
petals of a flower and form a connection between the two ducts. Since the tube is made<br>
of a wire mesh, scar tissue will grow around the flattened tube and eventually form a<br>
permanent connection.<br><br>
The woven tube is made out of a shape memory metal. A shape memory metal is<br>
an alloy that changes its plasticity as heat is applied, allowing it to change shape. If a<br>
shape memory metal is annealed in a desired form (in a longitudinally compressed form),<br>
after it is reshaped (in a cylindrical tube form) it will return to its annealed shape<br>
(flattened form) if it is reheated at a significantly lower temperature. The very special<br>
property of thermal memory is especially helpful in the design of a low profile and<br>
flexible delivery system. The preferred shape memory metal is a titanium-nickel alloy,<br>
most preferably a nearly equiatomic alloy of titanium and nickel called nitinol. Specific<br>
nitinol alloys, which also have superelastic properties, can reshape at body temperature.<br>
One embodiment of the delivery device 22 of the invention comprises a woven<br>
tube 10 mounted on a canula or delivery rod 24 covered by a retractable sheath 26 as<br>
shown in Figure 4A. In use in a side-to-side intestinal anastomosis, for example, the<br>
delivery device 22 is inserted into the body cavity through a trochar or tube (not shown)<br>
and the end 30 of the delivery device 22 is positioned at a predetermined puncture site in<br>
a first intestinal segment 28 either proximal or distal to the desired anastomotic site and<br>
the delivery device 22 is advanced intraluminally to the anastomotic site.<br>
The second intestinal segment 32 is brought into close apposition to the first<br>
segment at the anastomotic site and the sharp tip of a wire 34, initially retracted in the<br>
center of the canula 24, is used to pierce through the wall of the first segment 28 and the<br>
wall of the second segment 32 and into the lumen of the second segment as shown in<br>
Figure 4B. The sheath 26 is retracted and the woven tube 10 is deployed as shown in the<br>
sequence of Figures 4C, 4D, 4E and 4F at the juncture of the apposing holes created by<br>
the tip of the wire 34 and assumes the petal configuration at the site to hold the two<br><br>
pieces of intestine in apposition. The woven tube deployed through two layers of<br>
intestine is shown in Figures 4F and 4G. The opposed petals 20 on opposite sides of the<br>
two layers of intestine 28,32 are preferably interdigitated as shown in Figures 1,3A and<br>
B and 4G.<br>
