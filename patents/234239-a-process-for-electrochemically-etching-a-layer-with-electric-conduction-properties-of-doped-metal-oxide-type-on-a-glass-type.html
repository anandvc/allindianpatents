				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a process for etching layers,<br>
deposited on transparent substrates of the glass<br>
substrate type and more particularly layers which are<br>
at least slightly electrically conducting for the<br>
purpose of obtaining electrodes, conducting elements.<br>
The invention is especially advantageous for layers<br>
based on a metal oxide of the fluorine-doped SnO2 type<br>
which are generally used as electrodes for emissive<br>
screens of the flat screen type, for example plasma<br>
screens.<br>
Patent US-3 837 944 discloses a technique for<br>
chemically etching layers of conducting metal oxide<br>
such as SnO2, consisting first of all in depositing on<br>
the layer to be etched a continuous resin-based layer<br>
called a "photoresist" which it is necessary to<br>
irradiate through a negative, develop then rinse so as<br>
to obtain a mask having the desired pattern. Next,<br>
dried zinc powder is deposited on the layer provided<br>
with the mask and the regions of the layer which are<br>
not covered by the resin are then chemically etched by<br>
dipping the substrate into a bath of strong acid of the<br>
HC1 type.<br>
Etching by chemical means is well suited to ITO but<br>
proves to be not very effective for SnO2 or even<br>
fluorine-doped SnC&gt;2 (F:SnC&gt;2) which are more resistant.<br>
French patent application FR 2 325 084 discloses<br>
another process, by electrochemical means. This<br>
involves electrolytically reducing the metal oxide<br>
layer SnO2 by dipping the substrate provided with the<br>
layer to be etched and a copper electrode into a bath<br>
of a hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid solution, the<br>
substrate and the electrode being connected to an<br><br>
electrical power supply in order to form the cathode<br>
and the anode, respectively, of the system. The<br>
electrode has height and width dimensions equivalent to<br>
that of the substrate which is slowly immersed at<br>
constant speed, for example at about 1 cm/min for a<br>
layer thickness of 0.5 Âµm.<br>
The principle of etching by electrochemical means is<br>
advantageous, however, the process described above with<br>
an electrode of this type, may lead to a problem of<br>
overetching.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the phenomenon of overetching. The<br>
substrate is immersed at constant speed, the etching<br>
therefore takes place progressively with the advance of<br>
the substrate. Since the substrate remains immersed,<br>
the regions already etched remain in contact with the<br>
electrolytic solution and facing the electrode such<br>
that the etching continues on these regions, passing<br>
under the mask. This part of the layer under the mask,<br>
which is therefore removed, is called overetching<br>
which, if it is nonuniform, then makes the substrate<br>
unusable since the distance between the electrodes of<br>
the etched substrate is no longer constant.<br>
The aim of the invention is therefore to propose a new<br>
type of process, using electrochemical etching, which<br>
considerably limits, and even prevents, the overetching<br>
phenomenon.<br>
According to the invention, the process for<br>
electrochemically etching a layer with the electrical<br>
conduction properties, of the doped metal oxide type,<br>
on a transparent substrate of the glass type, the<br>
substrate comprising, deposited on said layer prior to<br>
the process, a mask with patterns delimiting a<br>
plurality of bared regions on the layer, the mask being<br>
capable of being removed after etching, and the process<br>
consisting in:<br><br>
bringing at least one region to be etched of the<br>
layer into contact with an electrically conducting<br>
solution,<br>
immersing an electrode in the solution and in<br>
placing it facing and at a distance (d) from the<br>
region,<br>
applying an electrical voltage between the<br>
electrode and the layer to be etched,<br>
is characterized in that it uses at least one electrode<br>
and the electrode has an oblong shape such that the<br>
etching is carried out on several regions of the layer<br>
over a width 1.<br>
An oblong electrode shape, that is to say one having a<br>
cross section of dimensions much less than its length,<br>
enables the substrate to face the electrode only over a<br>
limited area and not over its entire surface and<br>
therefore facing regions already etched. The risk of<br>
overetching is then considerably limited.<br>
In order to completely eliminate this risk, the process<br>
of the invention intends that, the electrode or the<br>
substrate be moved one with respect to the other so<br>
that the electrode is positioned successively facing<br>
regions to be etched simultaneously and that, according<br>
to a first embodiment, the regions already etched be<br>
physically isolated from the electrically conducting<br>
solution or, according to a second embodiment, the etch<br>
rate be decreased as the regions are gradually etched<br>
and remain in contact with the electrically conducting<br>
solution.<br>
According to the first embodiment, the electrode is<br>
held fixed in the conducting solution which is<br>
temporarily brought into contact only with the regions<br>
to be etched simultaneously, the time of the etching.<br>
To this end, as a first variant, the conducting<br>
solution is in a fixed position while the substrate is<br>
moved at constant speed with respect to the solution,<br><br>
or else the substrate is in a fixed position while the<br>
solution is moved at a constant speed with respect to<br>
the substrate. Also, according to one characteristic,<br>
the conducting solution is contained in a tank adjusted<br>
to the dimensions of the electrode and placed under the<br>
substrate.<br>
As a second variant of the first embodiment, the<br>
substrate is immersed in the conducting solution for<br>
the etching and dipped, after etching, into a<br>
nonconducting second solution over which the conducting<br>
solution stays suspended.<br>
According to a third variant of the first embodiment,<br>
the substrate is completely immersed in a fixed manner<br>
in the solution, the face endowed with the layer being<br>
parallel to and facing the surface of the solution, and<br>
the electrode is moved at a constant speed facing the<br>
regions to be etched and is combined with coating means<br>
which coat the electrode and the regions to be etched<br>
in order to isolate them from the etched regions.<br>
According to the second embodiment of the invention,<br>
the electrode is fixed in the conducting solution while<br>
the substrate is progressively immersed in the solution<br>
as the etching gradually takes place, the etch rate<br>
being decreased by decreasing the speed of movement of<br>
the substrate. Advantageously, the speed of movement of<br>
the substrate is a decreasing exponential function.<br>
When all the regions to be etched constitute a<br>
plurality of strips substantially parallel to each<br>
other, the electrode is placed transversely to the<br>
strips.<br>
Preferably, the layer placed on the substrate is<br>
metallic tin oxide or metallic fluorine-doped tin<br>
oxide.<br><br>
The electrode is preferably made of platinum and has a<br>
cross section of between 0.2 and 5 mm2.<br>
According to another characteristic, the substrate is<br>
provided with an electric contact in order to apply the<br>
electric voltage, the contact being arranged at one end<br>
of the substrate, and the etching is carried out from<br>
the end free of any electric contact up to the opposite<br>
edge provided with the electric contact. The electric<br>
voltage is at least equal to the reduction potential of<br>
the conducting material constituting the layer. As a<br>
variant, the voltage between the electrode and the<br>
layer is applied by means of an electric contact<br>
obtained by immersing an electrode in an electrically<br>
conducting solution brought into contact with at least<br>
one unetched region.<br>
Advantageously, means are provided for detaching oxygen<br>
and hydrogen bubbles which appear during etching close<br>
to and/or on the electrode.<br>
Also, the invention equally deals with a transparent<br>
substrate comprising a layer with electric conduction<br>
properties etched by the process explained above.<br>
In particular, it will be possible to use this type of<br>
substrate in display screens of the plasma screen type.<br>
The substrate may advantageously consist of a glass<br>
composition having a strain point (lower annealing<br>
temperature) greater than 540Â°C, the contraction value<br>
of the substrate being less than 60 ppm, and its<br>
thermal performance DT being greater than 130Â°C.<br>
Other advantageous and characteristics of the invention<br>
will become apparent on reading the following<br>

The figures are not produced to scale in order to<br>
simplify their understanding.<br>
It is appropriate to take by way of example in the rest<br>
of the description a transparent substrate 10 of glass<br>
type which is illustrated in figures la and lb<br>
respectively before and after having undergone the<br>
etching process of the invention.<br>
The substrate 10 is made of float glass with a<br>
thickness of about 2.8 mm, and in this case, by way of<br>
example, of dimensions 60 cm x 100 cm, it is designed<br>
to form a front or rear face of an emissive screen of<br>
the plasma screen type.<br>
The substrate 10 comprises a layer 11 of fluorine-doped<br>
tin oxide (F:SnO2) with a thickness of 300 nm, for<br>
example deposited in a prior step which is not<br>
described here in detail, since it is known to a person<br>
skilled in the art, either by a technique of the<br>
chemical vapor deposition type directly and<br>
continuously onto the float glass ribbon or in a<br>
subsequent step, onto the cut glass, or by a vacuum<br>
technique generally in a subsequent step, onto the cut<br>
glass.<br>
The aim is to obtain a high resolution etching of the<br><br>
layer in order to provide electrodes 11' in the form of<br>
parallel strips 100 cm long, a dimension corresponding<br>
to the length of the substrate, and 250 Âµm wide. These<br>
strips may be grouped in "pairs" of bands spaced one<br>
from the other by 400 Âµm, with a distance between two<br>
strips of the same pair of 80 Âµm.<br>
A resin-based mask 12, called a "photoresist", whose<br>
thickness may vary from 3 to 60 Âµm, covers the entire<br>
layer 11 for the purpose of etching.<br>
The process of depositing the mask, well known to a<br>
person skilled in the art and an embodiment of which<br>
is, for example, described in United States patent<br>
US 3 837 944, will not be explained hereinbelow.<br>
The mask 12 has a pattern which forms the strip shape<br>
of the electrodes 11' to be obtained. Also, the layer<br>
11 is etched onto the bared regions 13 without a mask,<br>
which overall also constitute parallel strips.<br>
The etching process of the invention consists in<br>
bringing the regions 13 to be etched into contact with<br>
a conducting solution, or electrolyte, in immersing an<br>
electrode in the same solution, in placing it facing<br>
each region 13 and in applying an electric voltage<br>
between the electrode and the layer 11.<br>
The electrode is of oblong shape in order preferably to<br>
extend over the entire width of the substrate and<br>
transversely to the strips to be etched, which makes it<br>
possible to cover several regions 13 which will thus be<br>
able to be etched simultaneously (figure 3). The<br>
etching is carried out over a surface of width 1, of<br>
about 1 cm for example, and perpendicular to the axis<br>
of the electrode. The etching operation is reiterated<br>
by moving either the electrode, or the substrate,<br>
transversely to the strips to be etched and over the<br>
entire length of the substrate.<br><br>
If it is not possible for the electrode to be as large<br>
as the width of the substrate, the etching operation is<br>
carried out over a length corresponding to the length<br>
of the electrode and the operation must then be<br>
repeated in order to etch the substrate over its entire<br>
length. Alternatively, in order to save on production<br>
time, it is possible to envision using several<br>
electrodes, each of which etches a portion of the width<br>
of the substrate.<br>
The etching is produced by an electrochemical reaction:<br>
the ions of the solution transport the electrons which<br>
etch the SnO2 layer in order to reduce it to the metal<br>
state (Sn) and to generate oxygen and hydrogen which<br>
appear as bubbles 51 around the region 13 (figures 4 to<br>
7). Means 50 for detaching these bubbles (figure 4),<br>
such as ultrasound, may be used in order to prevent a<br>
bubble attaching itself to the F:SnO2 layer thereby<br>
preventing or minimizing the etching which otherwise<br>
would cause a short circuit.<br>
The process of the invention therefore consists in<br>
displacing the electrode or the substrate one with<br>
respect to the other so that the electrode is<br>
positioned successively facing the regions to be etched<br>
simultaneously and that, according to a first<br>
embodiment, the regions already etched are physically<br>
isolated from the electrically conducting solution, or<br>
according to a second embodiment, the etch rate is<br>
decreased as the regions are gradually etched and<br>
remain in contact with the electrically conducting<br>
solution.<br>
Figures 4 to 6a and 6b illustrate variants of the<br>
device for implementing the process according to the<br>
first embodiment, while figure 7 illustrates the<br>
implementational device according to the second<br>
embodiment. Common elements are indicated by identical<br><br>
references.<br>
The conducting solution 2 0 consists of a bath which may-<br>
or may not contain all the substrate, at least the<br>
region to be etched having to be in contact with the<br>
solution. For example, hydrochloric acid (HC1) whose<br>
concentration is from 0.1 to 5M, preferably about 1M,<br>
is chosen.<br>
The electrode is therefore of oblong shape, that is to<br>
say that its cross section, whatever its shape, is<br>
smaller in dimensions than its length. The electrode<br>
may, for example, be an electrically conducting wire,<br>
advantageously made of platinum, whose diameter<br>
corresponds to the cross section s placed facing the<br>
regions 13. As a variant, it may be a flat<br>
parallelepipedal conducting element, such as a rigid<br>
metal sheet whose thickness corresponds substantially<br>
to the cross section s placed facing the regions 13.<br>
The diameter of the cross section s of the electrode<br>
is, for example, equal to 0.5 mm but could be larger or<br>
smaller. The size is to be adapted according to the<br>
type of electrode chosen, for example for a wire, it<br>
depends on the length of the wire and on its material<br>
in order to provide a degree of rigidity. The cross<br>
section will advantageously be between 0.2 and 5 mm2.<br>
The distance d which separates the electrode from the<br>
layer to be etched is defined as being the smallest<br>
distance separating the electrode from the layer, that<br>
is to say at the perpendicular to the plane of the<br>
substrate. It may vary from 0.1 mm to 3 cm for the type<br>
of substrate taken here as an example, however it is<br>
especially dictated by the desired width and depth of<br>
the region to be etched and by the cross section s of<br>
the electrode.<br>
An electric contact 14 is provided connected to the<br><br>
layer 11 and in a fixed manner at one of the ends of<br>
the substrate, it is connected to the negative terminal<br>
of a voltage generator 40 while the electrode 30 is<br>
connected to the positive terminal. As has been seen,<br>
the etching is carried out transversely to the parallel<br>
strips of the layer 11 to be etched, in addition, it<br>
advantageously starts at the end of the substrate free<br>
from any electric contact to finish at the end intended<br>
for the contact 14 so as to provide a constant electric<br>
connection of the regions remaining to be etched, only<br>
one movement of the electrode with respect to the<br>
substrate or conversely proves to be necessary.<br>
As a variant, in order to avoid fixing an electric<br>
contact of this type on the substrate, it is possible<br>
to envision a contact made action with the conducting<br>
solution by capillary action, as described below with<br>
regard to figure 6b.<br>
The electric voltage U provided by the generator 40 and<br>
applied between the electrode 30 and the layer 11 must<br>
be, at a minimum, equal to the reduction potential of<br>
the metal or of the metal oxide of the layer; for SnO2,<br>
the minimum voltage is 2 V. It is possible to envision<br>
applying a voltage up to a few hundred volts. The<br>
current supplied by this same generator may, for<br>
example, be 3A.<br>
Finally, the etching time during which the electrode 30<br>
stays in position facing the region 13 to be etched and<br>
during which the voltage is applied, may vary from a<br>
few seconds to a few minutes for the type of substrate<br>
taken here as an example. Here again, the time depends<br>
on the various parameters involved in the process and<br>
mentioned above, and especially on the distance d and<br>
on the thickness of the region to be etched, that is to<br>
say on the thickness of the layer 11.<br>
Thus, the various parameters involved in the process<br><br>
for etching a region of given width and thickness,<br>
which are the concentration of the solution, the<br>
current, the distance d, the cross section s of the<br>
electrode, and the etching time depend on each other<br>
and must, consequently, be adjusted with respect to<br>
each other.<br>
In the first variant of the first embodiment visible in<br>
figure 4 and illustrating a sectional view in a plane<br>
parallel to and passing through a strip of the<br>
substrate without mask and therefore to be etched, the<br>
substrate 10 is completely immersed horizontally in the<br>
solution 20 and held fixed, the face provided with the<br>
layer 11 and the mask 12 being turned toward the<br>
surface of the solution. The etching is carried out by<br>
moving the electrode 30 in a translational movement F<br>
at constant speed.<br>
The layer 11 is connected by one of the ends of the<br>
substrate via the electric contact 14 to the negative<br>
pole of the generator 40 while the positive pole of the<br>
latter is connected to the electrode 30.<br>
The electrode 3 0 consisting of a platinum wire is<br>
arranged transversely to the strips to be etched and<br>
the wire is positioned to the vertical of the region 13<br>
to be etched.<br>
The electrode is kept in a fixed position during<br>
etching by virtue of support means 31 which are not<br>
visible in figure 2 but illustrated in figure 8. This<br>
involves a U-shaped frame, which is isolating and<br>
capable of chemically withstanding the conducting<br>
solution 20, for example made of PVC, around which the<br>
platinum wire is tightened. The leads 31a of the<br>
U-shaped frame bear on the substrate, and the wire 30<br>
is kept at the distance d from the substrate by its<br>
engagement in two notches 31b placed face to face on<br>
the leads 31a of the U-shaped clip, the height h of the<br><br>
notches corresponding to the distance d. Several<br>
notches 31b, of different heights, may be provided, so<br>
as to provide different possible distances d.<br>
In order to completely avoid overetching the regions<br>
already etched, the region in the process of etching is<br>
physically isolated by surrounding the electrode and<br>
the region with covering means 32 such as a flexible<br>
skirt. The skirt is designed to surround the electrode<br>
30, its sections 32a being flush with the layer 11<br>
without scratching it and falling on each side of the<br>
regions 13 being etched.<br>
Finally, rather than using ultrasound as a means of<br>
detaching the hydrogen and oxygen bubbles, a more<br>
"gentle" etching of the layer is envisioned by<br>
installing a closed circulation of the conducting<br>
solution by virtue of a lift-and-force pump 50, for<br>
example, which sucks liquid from the solution by one<br>
end and ejects it by the other end above the region 13<br>
in the process of being etched so as to drive out the<br>
bubbles.<br>
In the second variant of the first embodiment<br>
illustrated in figure 5, the electrode 30 stays in a<br>
fixed position in the electrically conducting solution<br>
2 0 while the substrate 10 is immersed vertically along<br>
the displacement F and at constant speed into the<br>
solution by displacement means 53 such as a clamp<br>
manipulated by a mechanical arm.<br>
The electrically conducting solution 2 0 stays suspended<br>
over a nonconducting solution 23. The height of the<br>
solution 20 corresponds at least to the width 1 of the<br>
etching (figure 2) of a strip 13 to be etched and the<br>
height of the nonconducting solution 23 is<br>
substantially equal to the size of the substrate. A<br>
tank 52 accommodates the solutions 20 and 23 so as to<br>
receive the overflow of the solution 2 0 during<br><br>
immersion of the substrate.<br>
Thus, after the substrate has passed into the solution<br>
20 for etching, it is introduced into the solution 23,<br>
which is nonconducting, immediately stopping the<br>
etching. Any risk of overetching is removed.<br>
In the third embodiment (figures 6a and 6b), the<br>
electrode 30 is held fixed in the conducting solution<br>
20 which is temporarily brought into contact with only<br>
the regions 13 to be etched simultaneously, the etching<br>
time.<br>
In order to achieve this, the electrode 3 0 remains<br>
dipped in a tank 21 which contains the solution 2 0 and<br>
is adapted just to the size of the electrode. The<br>
regions to be etched of the substrate are then brought<br>
into contact with the solution by capillary action, the<br>
electrode facing these regions.<br>
The regions to be etched are successively brought into<br>
contact either by moving the substrate with respect to<br>
the tank 21 remaining in a fixed position, it being<br>
possible for the substrate to pass by at constant speed<br>
above the tank 21 by suitable driving means 54, or by<br>
moving the tank 21 with regard to the substrate<br>
remaining in a fixed position, the tank 21 passing by<br>
at constant speed by means of suitable driving means 55<br>
and below the substrate held in position by suspension<br>
means.<br>
So that the solution 2 0 is always in contact with the<br>
substrate, one of the two elements continuously moving,<br>
overpressure means (not illustrated) are provided in<br>
order to obtain a minibubbling or permanent overflow<br>
state of the solution 20.<br>
Thus, the conducting solution 2 0 containing the<br>
electrode 3 0 is in contact with the regions 13 to be<br><br>
etched simultaneously only for the etching, and once<br>
the regions are etched, they are no longer in contact<br>
with the solution, necessarily avoiding the overetching<br>
phenomenon.<br>
Optionally, any residues of the conducting solution may<br>
then be rinsed from the etched surface of the substrate<br>
by bringing the etched regions of the substrate into<br>
contact with another tank 22 filled with water. This<br>
tank is fixed if the substrate moves or is mobile if<br>
the substrate remains fixed.<br>
In this device, it is quite possible to use as a type<br>
of electrode, not a wire, but for example a metalized<br>
support, the support being structurally integrated into<br>
the tank 21 and forming a channel in which metal placed<br>
facing the substrate is housed.<br>
In figure 6a, the electric contact 14 is fixed to one<br>
of the ends of the substrate, the etching operation<br>
being carried out, as already explained above, from the<br>
free end of the substrate toward the end which is<br>
electrically connected.<br>
In figure 6b, an electric contact 14 which is<br>
physically independent of the substrate, is preferred,<br>
which consists of an electrode 33 dipped into an<br>
electrically conducting solution 24 contained in a tank<br>
25, the solution 24 being brought into contact with at<br>
least one as yet unetched region of the substrate.<br>
Also, the tank 2 5 is separated by a constant distance<br>
from the equivalent tank 21 and by a distance<br>
proportional to at least one distance separating two<br>
parallel strips of the layer 11.<br>
In the device for implementing the process according to<br>
the second embodiment (figure 7), the electrode 3 0<br>
remains in a fixed position while the substrate 10 is<br>
dipped, vertically or obliquely,, progressively into the<br><br>
solution 2 0 according to a translational movement F in<br>
order to etch the regions 13.<br>
The electrode 3 0 consisting of the platinum wire is<br>
secured to a float 34 which is able to slide in a guide<br>
parallel to the translational movement of the<br>
substrate. The float makes it possible to keep the<br>
electrode/substrate distance d constant as a result of<br>
increasing the level of the solution with the<br>
progressive introduction of the substrate. Again, in<br>
this case, the float is a means taken by way of example<br>
to keep the electrode/substrate distance d fixed.<br>
Moreover, it is possible to provide a collection tank<br>
on account of the overflow of the solution by<br>
progressive introduction of the substrate.<br>
The substrate 10 keeps a fixed position during the<br>
etching time, the regions 13 to be etched being placed<br>
facing the wire 30. The substrate is moved by means of<br>
moving support means which are not visible in the<br>
figure. The two edges of the substrate lateral to the<br>
strips to be etched are combined with the support means<br>
which are able to slide in guide rails lying in the<br>
direction of translation of the substrate.<br>
The electric contact 14 of the substrate is located at<br>
the upper end of the substrate which emerges from the<br>
solution 20 so that the electric connection is<br>
permanent during the etching.<br>
In order to ensure that the overetching phenomenon does<br>
not occur in spite of limiting the regions placed<br>
facing the electrode, the etch rate is increased during<br>
immersion. In order to do this, the immersion speed of<br>
the substrate is decreased, preferably according to a<br>
function of the decreasing exponential type.<br>
After the layer 11 has been etched over all of the<br>
regions 13, according to any one of the embodiments and<br><br>
variants explained above, the mask is removed, a step<br>
well known to a person skilled in the art, either by-<br>
chemical means by dissolving it in a suitable solvent,<br>
or by a heat treatment, a hot air knife being blown<br>
over the mask or the substrate being passed through a<br>
furnace.<br>
The etching process described above is particularly<br>
suitable for etching SnO2, but of course, it can be<br>
applied to all types of metals or metal oxides such as<br>
ITO, which are conductive or not very conductive.<br>
