				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a chemoenzymatic process for stereoselective preparation of both R and S enantiomers of 3-hydroxy-3-(2-thienyl) propanenitrile (1).<br>
This   invention   particularly   relates  to  a  chemoenzymatic  process   for  the stereoselective   preparation   of  both   the   enantiomers   of  3-hydroxy-3-(2-thienyl) propanenitrile (2) a key intermediate for the synthesis of antipsychic drug duloxetine. Background of the invention<br>
Duloxetine and related class of compounds like fluoxetine, tomoxetine etc., are important for treating psychiatric disorders. Fluoxetine is a selective inhibitor of serotonin in serotonergic neurons, tomoxetine and nisoxetine are selective inhibitors of norepinephrine in noradrenergic neurons while duloxetine is a dual inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and thus have a better pharmacological profile as an antidepressant drug (EP 273658, 1988; Chem. Abstr., 1988, 109, 170224n; Life Sci. 1988, 43, 2049).<br>
Serotonin and norepinephrine neuro transmitters are intimately involved in a number of physiological and behavioral processes, suggesting that duloxetine (ability to produce robust increase of extra cellular serotonin and norepinephrine levels) is not only a highly efficient antidepressant agent for treating psychiatric disorders but also can be used for treating other symptoms like alcoholism, urinary incontinence, fatigue, stroke, intestinal cystitis, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, hyperactivity disorder," sleep disorder, sexual dysfunction etc.<br>
Duloxetine having one chiral center can exist in two isomeric forms. In view of the different pharmacological activities displayed by individual enantiomers. differences in metabolic behaviour and importance to provide enantiomerically pure forms as drugs, the preparation of this drug in enantiomerically pure form is highly desirable.<br>
Duloxetine has the basic structural skeleton of 3-amino-propanol and retrosynthetic synthetic strategy reveals that enantiomerically pure 3-hydroxy-3-(2-thienyl) propanenitrile (P-hydroxy nitrile) (1) should be an excellent chiral building block for the synthesis of the target molecule. In the literature, there are only few reports for the synthesis of duloxetine in optically pure form, one by employing<br><br>
complexed-LAH for asymmetric reduction of the Mannich base {Tetrahedron Lett. 1990, 31, 7101) and other by lipase mediated resolution of 3-chloro-l-(2-thienyl)-l-propanol {Chirality 2000,12, 26).<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a chemoenzymatic process for the stereoselective preparation of both the enantiomers of 3-hydroxy-3-(2-thienyl) propanenitrile (1) which are optically pure intermediates for the synthesis of both enantiomers of duloxetine in high enantiomeric excess.<br>
In   the   drawings   accompanying   this   specification   represents   enzymatic<br>
resolution     of    3-hydroxy-3-(2-thienyl)     propanenitrile     via     lipase     mediated<br>
transesterification of 3-hydroxy-3-(2-thienyl) propanenitrile (1) and lipase mediated<br>
hydrolysis of 3-acetyloxy-3-(2-thienyl) propanenitrile (2) to afford optically pure<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention provides an enzymatic process for the stereoselective<br>
preparation of both the enantiomers of 3-hydroxy-3-(2-thienyl) propanenitrile (1) , a<br>
key intermediate for the synthesis of both enantiomers of duloxetine which comprises<br>
of reacting the cyanohydrin with acetylating agent and hydrolysis of acetyloxy nitrile in<br>
the presence of lipase followed by separation of acetate and alcohol obtained<br>
employing column chromatography. The 3-hydroxy-3-(2-thienyl) propanenitrile (1)<br>
was selectively acetylated with vinyl acetate, isopropenyl acetate in the presence of<br>
Upases while 3-acetyloxy-3-(2-thienyl) propanenitrile (2) was selectively hydrolyzed in<br>
phosphate buffer in the presence of the Upases.<br>
The alcohol and the ester formed in the kinetic resolution were separated by<br>
column chromatography. The enantiomeric purities of the compounds were determined<br>
by HPLC employing a chiral column (OJ-H). Absolute configurations were<br>
preliminarily presumed to be R for acetate and S for alcohol (in the transesterification<br>
reaction) by the empirical rule for the enantiopreference of the lipase and then later<br>
confirmed from the optical rotation values of their corresponding aminoalcohols<br>
(Chirality 2000,12, 26).<br>
The process of the present invention is illustrated below:<br>
1. Racemic 3-hydroxy-3-(2-thienyl)propanenitrile (1) was acetylated enzymatically<br>
employing different acetylating agents and various Upases in different solvents<br>
2. Acetylating agents such as vinyl acetate and isopropenyl acetate were used for<br>
acetylation.<br>
3. Different Upases like Pseudomonas cepacia lipase immobilized on modified<br>
ceramic particals (PS-C), Pseudomonas cepacia lipase immobilized on diatomite (PSD),<br>
Psedomonas cepacia (PS), porcine pancreas lipase (PPL), Candida cylindracea<br>
lipase (CCL), Candida rugosa lipase (CRL), lipase immobilized from Mucor miehei<br>
(Lipozyme) were screened for the enzymatic transesterification process.<br>
4. Various solvents like diisopropyl ether, toluene, hexane, dioxane, chloroform, tbutylmethyl<br>
ether, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile and acetone were<br>
employed.<br>
5. Racemic 3-acetyloxy-3-(2-thienyl) propanenitrile (2) was prepared by reaction of<br>
the hydroxy nitrile with acetic anhydride in the presence of pyridine.<br>
6. Racemic 3-acetyloxy-3-(2-thienyl) propanenitrile (2) was hydrolyzed<br>
enzymatically employing various lipases in phosphate buffer solution.<br>
7. In the presence of lipases (R)-3-hydroxy-3-(2-thienyl)propanenitrile was<br>
selectively acetylated, and (R)-3-acetyloxy-3-(2-thienyl)propanenitrile was selectively<br>
hydrolyzed and the thus obtained acetates and alcohols were separated by column<br>
chromatography.<br>
8. The enantiomeric excess was determined by HPLC employing chiral column.<br>

Example 3<br>
Chiral HPLC Analysis: HPLC analysis was performed on an instrument that<br>
consisted of a Shimadzu LC-6A system controller, SPD-6A fixed wavelength UV<br>
monitor as detector, FCV-100B fraction collector and chromatopac C-R4A data<br>
processor as a recording integrator. Analyses were performed by employing chiral<br>
column (Chiralcel OJ-H, Daicel) with hexane: isopropanol (85:15) as the mobile phase<br>
at a flow rate of 0.75 mL/min and monitored at UV 254 nm. Racemic acetate was<br>
prepared by treating its corresponding hydroxy nitrile with acetic anhydride in the<br>
presence of pyridine as an authentic sample for comparision on HPLC.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
Vicinal cyanohydrins or 1,2-cyanohyrins are important and versatile compounds<br>
in organic synthesis as these hydroxy nitriles in optically pure form provides a number<br>
of opportunities for synthetic manipulations leading to a wide range of chiral synthons<br>
like amino alcohols, hydroxy amides, hydroxy esters, hydroxy acids etc., by employing<br>
simple methods. Moreover, thiophene can serve as a masked alkyl chain or masked acid<br>
group making it more useful intermediate for synthesis chirally pure compounds of<br>
biological importance.<br>
In this process chiral 1,2-cyanohydrin has been obtained by lipase mediated<br>
resolution of the racemate by transesterification as well as hydrolysis in high<br>
enantiomeric excess.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
