				<td>SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR PROVIDING AUTHENTICATION<br>
CREDENTIALS ACROSS APPLICATION ENVIRONMENTS<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application serial number<br>
60/741,661 filed on December 2,2005 and titled METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR<br>
PROVIDING AUTHENTICATION CREDENTIALS ACROSS APPLICATION<br>
ENVIRONMENTS.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to accessing remote resources on a network through a<br>
web proxy, and more specifically to providing access to a resource requested through<br>
a proxy server by a virtualized computing environment<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In some environments, a request for a network resource must be accompanied<br>
by state information indicating the requestor has access to the resource. For example,<br>
a server may require an authorization cookie to be present in a request for a given<br>
document. This state information is typically managed by a web browser.<br>
However, there may be many cases where a user is navigating resources using<br>
a web page, and then selects a resource which requires an application other than the<br>
web browser to be viewed. In some cases, the web browser and the other application<br>
may be part of a virtualized computing environment. For example, a user may be<br>
navigating a web site and click on a link to a spreadsheet, causing the browser to<br>
launch a remotely hosted spreadsheet application for viewing the viewing. When the<br>
application hosted by a server is invoked for the purposes of loading the external<br>
HTTP-based resource, the application may be required to include state information for<br>
the request to be allowed. Some systems may lack a mechanism for injecting the<br>
necessary session state data into an upstream request. For example, in some systems,<br>
the link between the application and the external HTTP-based resource is provided<br>
directly by a file including connection information but lacking necessary session state<br>
data,<br>
 <br>
One result of lacking the necessary session state data may be presentation of a<br>
session failure message or error dialog box to a user of the system. Another result in<br>
cases where the application hosted on the application server supports rending of<br>
HTML (applications such as WORD, EXCEL, or POWERPOINT), may be the<br>
rendering of an error page within the application, such that the error page is presented<br>
as if it were the requested resource. This may cause confusion to the user.<br>
Thus there exists a need for systems and methods which allow access of<br>
remote resources in launched applications while preserving state information<br>
necessary for the request,<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a system for providing a modified URL from a<br>
proxy server to an application attempting to access a remote resource. The modified<br>
URL may contain information which allows a proxy server which receives a request<br>
for the URL to generate a request for the remote resource where the request includes<br>
any state information necessary to access the resource. Providing the application with<br>
a URL pointing to this state information may enable seamless access to a protected<br>
resource without requiring a user of the system to enter credentials or be presented<br>
with errors.<br>
In. one aspect, the present invention is a method for providing access to a<br>
resource requested through a proxy server by a virtualized computing environment,<br>
wherein the resource is external to the virtualized computing environment's server<br>
system. In one embodiment, the method comprises: receiving a request from a client<br>
identifying an external resource; transmitting a first request for information<br>
corresponding to said external resource; receiving a first response to said first request,<br>
said first response comprising state information; transmitting to the client a file<br>
comprising a URL, said URL identifying said proxy and said external resource;<br>
receiving, from a virtualized computing environment, a request for said URL;<br>
transmitting a second request for said external resource, said request comprising said<br>
state information; receiving a second response to said second request; and<br>
transmitting information corresponding to said second response to said virtualized<br>
computing environment.<br>
In a second aspect, the present invention is a computer system for providing<br>
access to a resource requested through a proxy server by a virtualized computing<br>
 <br>
environment, wherein the resource is external to the virtualized computing<br>
environment's server system. In one embodiment, the system comprises: means for<br>
receiving a request from a client identifying an external resource; means for<br>
transmitting a first request for information corresponding to said external resource;<br>
means for receiving a first response to said first request, said first response comprising<br>
state information; means for transmitting to the client a file comprising a URL, said<br>
URL identifying said proxy and said external resource; means for receiving, from a<br>
virtualized computing environment, a request for said URL; means for transmitting a<br>
second request for said external resource, said request comprising said state<br>
information; means for receiving a second response to said second request; and means<br>
for transmitting information corresponding to said second response to said virtualized<br>
computing environment.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
 <br>
Referring now to FIG. 1, one embodiment of a computer network is depicted.<br>
In brief overview, a client 113 is connected via a network 111A, to an application<br>
server 107 and a proxy server 105. The proxy server is also connected via a network<br>
111B to an external server 109. The clients 113, networks 111A, 111B, and servers<br>
105 may comprise any computing devices, including without limitation personal<br>
computers, notebook computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, digital<br>
televisions, servers, and blades.<br>
Still referring to FIG. 1 now in greater detail, in the embodiment shown, a<br>
client 113 is connected to a network 111A. The networks 111A and 111B (generally<br>
111) may comprise the Internet, one or more local networks, one or more wide area<br>
networks, and/or one or more metropolitan area networks. The networks 111 may<br>
comprise any computing devices including web servers, file servers, routers,<br>
databases, computers, servers, and network appliances. The networks 111 may<br>
comprise computing devices connected via any means of connecting multiple<br>
computing devices including cables, IR ports, and wireless signals. The network and<br>
any devices connected to the networks may communicate via any communication<br>
protocol used to communicate among or within computing devices, including without<br>
limitation SSL, HTML, XML, RDP, ICA, FTP, HTTP, TCP, IP, UDP, IPX, SPX,<br>
NetBIOS, NetBEUI, SMB, SMTP, Ethernet, ARCNET, Fiber Distributed Data<br>
Interface (FDDI), RS232, IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.1 la, IEE 802.1 lb, IEEE 802.1 lg<br>
and direct asynchronous connections, or any combination thereof. The networks 111<br>
may comprise mobile telephone networks utilizing any protocol or protocols used to<br>
communicate among mobile devices, including AMPS, TDMA, CDMA, GSM, GPRS<br>
or UMTS. In some embodiments, the network 111A may be physically distinct from<br>
network 11 1B. In other embodiments, networks 111A and 111B may be connected<br>
via any manner, and via any topology. In some embodiments, networks 111A and<br>
111B may comprise the same network. In some embodiments, the application server<br>
107 or client 105 may also be connected to network 111B.<br>
A client 113 may comprise any computing device. In some embodiments, the<br>
client may comprise a web browser. In some embodiments, the client 113 may<br>
comprise a client agent. In one of these embodiments, the client agent may support<br>
the Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) protocol, available from Citrix<br>
Systems, Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In another of these embodiments, the client<br>
agent is an ICA client. In still another of these embodiments, the client agent supports,<br>
 <br>
the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP),available from Microsoft Corporation. In yet<br>
another of these embodiments, the client agent is an RDP client. In still other<br>
embodiments, the client agent is an agent capable of communicating via a<br>
presentation layer protocol.<br>
An application server may comprise any computing device capable of<br>
providing access to a computing environment to a client. For example, in one<br>
embodiment, an application server 107 may stream an application to the client 113.<br>
In another embodiment, an application server 107 may transmit application files that a<br>
client 113 downloads and executes. In still another embodiment, an application server<br>
may execute an application locally and transmit output to a client 113. In some<br>
embodiments, an application server 107 may be physically distinct from a proxy<br>
server 105. In other embodiments, an application server 107 may share any hardware<br>
or software with a proxy server 105.<br>
In some embodiments, an application server may provide access to an<br>
application which comprises functionality for accessing resources via HTTP.<br>
Examples of applications that support the accessing of resources via HTTP include<br>
Microsoft OFFICE productivity applications such as MS WORD, MS EXCEL, MS<br>
POWERPOINT, and MS ACCESS, manufactured by Microsoft Corporation of<br>
Redmond, Washington. Examples of resources that may be accessed include MS<br>
WORD documents, MS EXCEL spreadsheets, MS POWERPOINT presentations, and<br>
MS ACCESS applications. In some embodiments, an application server may provide<br>
access to an application which comprises functionality for accessing Microsoft<br>
EXCHANGE resources.<br>
A proxy server 105 may comprise any computing device capable of providing<br>
proxy services to a client. In some embodiments, a proxy server 105 may intercept<br>
requests from a client 113 for external resources, and forward the request to the<br>
external resources. In some embodiments, the proxy server 105 may modify any of<br>
the requests or responses that pass through the proxy server 105. For example, a<br>
proxy server may modify a request from a client for an external resource such that the<br>
request appears to originate from the proxy server 105. Or for example, a proxy<br>
server 105 may rewrite links in a response received from an external resource so that<br>
the links point to the proxy server 105.<br>
In some embodiments, an network appliance may be used in conjunction with<br>
any of the servers shown in order to provide additional functionality- Examples of<br>
 <br>
additional functionality provided by a network appliance may include, without<br>
limitation, firewall services, SSL pooling and acceleration, TCP pooling and<br>
acceleration, data compression, connection monitoring, application logging,<br>
application acceleration, application delivery, load balancing, caching, virtualization,<br>
translation, redirection, connection pooling, proxy services, reverse proxy services,<br>
authentication, and session management.<br>
An external server 109 may comprise any server accessed by the client 113<br>
through the proxy. An external server may provide functionality for transmitting any<br>
type of resource, including without limitation web pages, web applications,<br>
documents, spreadsheets, multimedia, and other files. Examples of external servers<br>
may include web servers operated by third parties, file servers, or remote databases.<br>
In some embodiments, an external server 109 may be operated by a third party. In<br>
some embodiments, an external server 109 may require a client 113 to complete a log-<br>
on process and a set a session cookie on a client browser before a resource may be<br>
accessed.<br>
Figures 2A and 2B depict block diagrams of atypical computer 200 useful as<br>
client computing devices and server computing devices. As shown in FIGs. 2A and<br>
2B, each computer 200 includes a central processing unit 202, and a main memory<br>
unit 204. Each computer 200 may also include other optional elements, such as one<br>
or more input/output devices 230a-230-b (generally referred to using reference<br>
numeral 230), and a cache memory 240 in communication with the central processing<br>
unit 202.<br>
The central processing unit 202 is any logic circuitry that responds to and<br>
processes instructions fetched from the main memory unit 204. In many<br>

a computer system 200 in which the processor communicates directly with main<br>
memory 204 via a memory port. For example, in FIG. 2B the main memory 204 may<br>
be DRDRAM.<br>
FIGs. 2A and 2B depict embodiments in which the main processor 202<br>
communicates directly with cache memory 240 via a secondary bus, sometimes<br>
referred to as a "backside" bus. In other embodiments, the main processor 202<br>
communicates with cache memory 240 using the system bus 250. Cache memory 240<br>
typically has a faster response time than main memory 204 and is typically provided<br>
by SRAM, BSRAM, or EDRAM.<br>
In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2A, the processor 202 communicates with<br>
various I/O devices 230 via a local system bus 250. Various busses may be used to<br>
connect the central processing unit 202 to the I/O devices 230, including a VESA VL<br>
bus, an ISA bus, an EISA bus, a MicroChannel Architecture (MCA) bus, a PCI bus, a<br>
PCI-X bus, a PCI-Express bus, or a NuBus. For embodiments in which the I/O device<br>
is an video display, the processor 202 may use an Advanced Graphics Port (AGP) to<br>
communicate with the display. FIG. 2B depicts an embodiment of a computer system<br>
200 in which the main processor 202 communicates directly with I/O device 230b via<br>
HyperTransport, Rapid I/O, or InfiniBand. FIG. 2B also depicts an embodiment in<br>
which local busses and direct communication are mixed: the processor 202<br>
communicates with I/O device 230a using a local interconnect bus while<br>
communicating with I/O device 230b directly.<br>
A wide variety of I/O devices 230 may be present in the computer system 200.<br>
Input devices include keyboards, mice, trackpads, trackballs, cameras, video cameras,<br>
microphones, and drawing tablets. Output devices include video displays, speakers,<br>

in FIG. 2A and 2B, including the processor 202 and the main memory 204.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 3, a block diagram depicting one embodiment of<br>
method for providing access to a resource requested through a proxy server by a<br>
virtualized computing environment, is shown. In brief overview, the method<br>
comprises: receiving a request from a client identifying an external resource (step<br>
301); transmitting a first request for information corresponding to said external<br>
resource (step 303); receiving a first response to said first request, said first response<br>
comprising state information (step 305); transmitting to the client a file comprising a<br>
URL, said URL identifying said proxy and said external resource (step 307);<br>
receiving, from a virtualized computing environment, a request for said URL (step<br>
309); transmitting a second request for said external resource, said request comprising<br>
said state information (step 311); receiving a second response to said second request<br>
(step 313); and transmitting information corresponding to said second response to said<br>
virtualized computing environment (step 315). Although the method will be<br>
described below in the context of being performed by a proxy server 105, the method<br>
may be performed by any computing device as described herein, including without<br>
limitation a proxy server 105, an application server 107, a network appliance, a client<br>
agent, or any combination thereof.<br>
Still referring to FIG. 3, now in greater detail, a proxy server 105 may receive<br>
a request from a client 113 identifying an external resource (step 301). The request<br>
may be received via any protocol or protocols described herein. The external resource<br>
may comprise any resource residing on an external server. Examples of requests that<br>
may be received include, without limitation, requests for web pages, requests for<br>
documents, requests for files, and requests for web applications. In one embodiment,<br>
the request may be an HTTP request. In another embodiment, the request may be an<br>
FTP request. In some embodiments, the request may be accompanied by state<br>
information relating to the request. For example, an HTTP request may comprise a<br>
cookie relating to a web site from which the resource is requested. In another<br>
embodiment, the resource may comprise a remote desktop. For example, the proxy<br>
 <br>
server may receive a request to open a file or application corresponding to a user's<br>
desktop on a remote machine. Or, for example, the proxy server may receive a<br>
request to open a web page which displays the contents of a remote desktop.<br>
After receiving a request from a client 113 identifying an external resource<br>
(step 301), the proxy server 105 may then transmit a first request for information<br>
corresponding to said external resource (step 303). The first request may be<br>
transmitted using any protocol or protocols described herein, and may be transmitted<br>
to any external server 109 as described herein. In some embodiments, the request<br>
may be for MIME-type information corresponding to the external resource. For<br>
example, the proxy server 105 may send an HTTP HEAD request corresponding to<br>
the external resource.<br>
After transmitting a first request for information corresponding to said external<br>
resource (step 303); the proxy server may receive a first response to said first request,<br>
said first response comprising state information (step 305). The first response may be<br>
received via any protocol or protocols described herein. In some embodiments, the<br>
first response may comprise an HTTP response. In some embodiments, the first<br>
response may comprise a MIME-type corresponding to the resource.<br>
The state information may comprise any information corresponding to the<br>
client, the request, or the connection. In some embodiments, the state information<br>
may comprise a cookie. In other embodiments, the state information may comprise<br>
any information corresponding to the proxy's request or connection. For example, the<br>
state information may comprise a cookie comprising a session identifier<br>
corresponding to the client's interaction with an external server. Or, for example, the<br>
state information may comprise a user or machine identifier corresponding to the<br>
client. Or, for example, the state information may be a token or other identifier<br>
indicating that the client is permitted to access the resource.<br>
In some embodiments, the proxy may store the received state information.<br>
The proxy may store the state information in any memory structure or element,<br>
including without limitation a database, file, or cache. In some embodiments, the<br>
proxy may store the state information indexed by client. In other embodiments, the<br>
proxy may store the state information indexed by the external resource. In still other<br>
embodiments, the proxy may store the state information in a memory structure<br>
associated with a given client connection.<br>
 <br>
After receiving a first response to said first request; said first response<br>
comprising state information (step 305); the proxy may transmit, to the client, a file<br>
comprising a URL, said URL identifying said proxy and said external resource (step<br>
307). The file may comprise any file type capable of identifying the proxy and<br>
resource. In some embodiments, the file may comprise an ICA file. In still other<br>
embodiments, the file may comprise an RDP file. In some embodiments, the file may<br>
comprise information identifying the MIME-type of the external resource. In other<br>
embodiments, the file may comprise information identifying any other types or<br>
characteristics of the external resource, including without limitation file name, file<br>
extension, and file size.<br>
In some embodiments, the URL points to a mechanism within the proxy server<br>
and to an embedded token that represents HTTP state for an external HTTP resource.<br>
In some embodiments, the URL contains an identifier which allows the proxy server,<br>
upon receiving a request for the URL, to retrieve data required to access the requested<br>
resource, such as session state data (for example, an HTTP cookie state) and<br>
authentication credentials.<br>
In another embodiment, the modified URL, which may be referred to as a web<br>
proxy URL, points to both the web proxy and to the external web resource embedded<br>
inside the URL. In some embodiments, the modified URL has the form:<br>
http://<servemame>/<proxvnamespace>/<base64hostname>/<path>/document.doc.<br>
In these embodiments, <servername> may indicate a host where a web proxy is<br>
available, <proxynamespace> may be a token used to identify the web proxy<br>
namespace, and <base64hostname> may refer to a Base-64-encoded location of the<br>
external web resource, which may include a protocol and a hostname. In these<br>
embodiments <path> may refer to the root relative path to the external server.<br>
In some embodiments, the file may comprise one or more instructions for an<br>
application to be opened with respect to the resource. For example, if the resource is<br>
a MICROSOFT WORD document, the file may comprise instructions to open<br>
MICROSOFT WORD. Or, for example, if the resource is a PDF document, the file<br>
may comprise instructions to open ADOBE ACROBAT. In other embodiments, the<br>
client may determine an application to open based on an identified type of the external<br>
resource.<br>
In some embodiments, the file contains file type association information<br>
enabling an association between a type associated with a resource and an application<br>
 <br>
capable of processing or providing access to the resource. In one of these<br>
embodiments, the ticket is referred to as an FTA ticket. In another of these<br>
embodiments, the FTA ticket includes additional information, such as http<br>
authentication and cookie state, needed to access to the external web resource. In<br>
some embodiments, the FTA ticket has a database table format such as the following:<br>
CREATE TABLE [dbo]. [FileTypeAssociation] (<br>
[ID] [uniqueidentifier] ROWGUIDCOL PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED NOT<br>
NULL ,<br>
[MasterSessionID] [uniqueidentifier] NOT NULL ,<br>
[ExpirationTime] [datetime] NOT NULL ,<br>
[Url] [varchar] (2048) NOT NULL ,<br>
[CookieData] [image] NULL ,<br>
[CookieDataHash] [binary] (20) NULL ,<br>
[Root] [varchar] (2048) NOT NOLL ,<br>
[MessageID] [uniqueidentifier] NOT NULL ,<br>
[AttachID] [varchar] (10) NOT NULL ,<br>
[timestamp] [timestamp] NOT NULL<br>
) ON [PRIMARY]<br>
In this example, the MasterSessionID variable may store the session identifier<br>
for the session including the request and response. The ExpirationTime variable may<br>
store the session expiration time, or it may be used to indicate the cookie expiration<br>
time. The Url variable may store the URL of the requested resource. The<br>
CookieData variable may contain the state information corresponding to the session,<br>
and may comprise one or more HTTP cookies. The CookieDataHash variable may<br>
store a hash value of some or all of the cookie data, and may be computed using any<br>
hash algorithm, including cryptographic hashes such as SHA variants and MD<br>
variants. The Root variable may store the root URL or other identifier corresponding<br>
to the session. The MessagelD variable may store one or more communications<br>
received by or sent from the proxy server. The AttachID variable may store an<br>
identifier corresponding to an ICA file sent to the client. The timestamp may store a<br>
timestamp corresponding to the time a transaction was executed by the proxy server,<br>
such as transmitting the ICA file to the client. In embodiments where the local<br>
machine includes a client agent, the client agent may be instantiated upon receipt of<br>
the file. In one of these embodiments, the client agent is provided with the location of<br>
the file inside a temporary cache on the web browser in the local machine.<br>
After transmitting to the client a file comprising a URL, said URL identifying<br>
said proxy and said external resource (step 307); the proxy may receive, from a<br>
 <br>
virtualized computing environment, a request for said URL (step 309). The request<br>
may comprise any protocol or protocols. In some embodiments, the request for the<br>
URL may comprise an HTTP request. In one embodiment, the request may be<br>
received from a virtualized computing environment executing on the client. In<br>
another embodiment, the request may be received from a virtualized computing<br>
environment executing on a server.<br>
In some embodiments, the virtualized computing environment may comprise<br>
an application that is streamed from a server to a client. In other embodiments, the<br>
virtualized computing environment may comprise an application that executes on a<br>
server, which is in communication with a client via a presentation layer protocol, such<br>
as RDP or ICA. In still other embodiments, a virtualized computing environment<br>
may comprise a server providing access to an application, some or all of which has<br>
been downloaded by the client.<br>
The URL may be specially formed to indicate to the proxy that the request is<br>
for the external resource. The URL may comprise any of the state information<br>
previously identified in connection with the external resource. The URL may also<br>
comprise an internal identifier which identifies to the proxy server that the request<br>
originates from a virtualized computing environment, and corresponds to the external<br>
resource.<br>
In one embodiments, when the web proxy processes the URL, the web proxy<br>
determines whether an associated FTA ticket includes validation information and, if<br>
so, extracts the required state, and uses the state to allow the request to successfully be<br>
authorized on the external web server. In yet another of these embodiments, the web<br>
proxy re-injects the extracted state into the request for access to the resource. This<br>
results in authentication of the client machine enabling the client machine to access<br>
the web application.<br>
The proxy server may then transmit a second request for said external<br>
resource, said request comprising said state information (step 311). This second<br>
request may comprise any protocol, including without limitation HTTP. In some<br>
embodiments, the second request may comprise an HTTP GET request identifying the<br>
external resource. In some embodiments, the second request may comprise one or<br>
more cookies containing the state information.<br>
The proxy server may then receive a second response to said second request<br>
(step 313). In some embodiments, the second response may comprise some or all of<br>
 <br>
the requested resource. In some embodiments, the second response may comprise an<br>
HTTP response.<br>
The proxy server may then transmit information corresponding to said second<br>
response to said virtualized computing environment (step 315). The information may<br>
comprise some or all of the external resource. In some embodiments, a transmittal<br>
from the proxy server to the virtualized computing environment may be compressed,<br>
accelerated, and/or filtered for security purposes. In one embodiments, the<br>
compression, acceleration, and/or filtering may be performed by a network appliance.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 4, a flow diagram depicting one example of providing<br>
seamless access to external resources accessed through an application server is shown.<br>
In brief overview, after providing the required log-on information and session date, a<br>
client receives access to a resource on the external web resource by the following<br>
steps.<br>
1. An end user makes a request by selecting a link in a web browser. The link<br>
points to a web proxy through which a word processing document on an external<br>
web resource may be accessed.<br>
2. The web proxy processes the request and identifies a location of the external<br>
web resource to which the proxied request should be sent via HTTP.<br>
3. The external web resource locates the requested word processing document and<br>
returns an HTTP header response downstream to the Web Proxy.<br>
4. The Web Proxy receives the response and identifies a type associated with the<br>
word processing document, such as a MIME type. The Web Proxy records the<br>
incoming URL HTTP state including all cookies and http authentication state used<br>
to access the URL. The state is persisted to a database and the Web Proxy receives<br>
a ticket. Web Proxy provides the ticket and a raw URL to an activation service.<br>
A file, such, as an ICA file, is generated with the LongCommandName parameter<br>
pointing to a URL that goes through web proxy, points to the web resource and<br>
contains the http context ticket. The file is sent downstream to the web browser.<br>
In some embodiments, the URL may be of the form:<br>
http://hostname/CitrixWebProxv/<base64hostname>/path/document.doc<br>
5. The web browser activates the client agent based on the returned file mime-type<br>
and points to the file from a temporary location inside the browser cache. The<br>
client agent connects to the application server.<br>
 <br>
6. The application server invokes the application associated with the file type,<br>
which may be a hooked word processing file format. The hosted application (MS<br>
WORD, in this case) uses the LongCommandName parameter, which then<br>
attempts to open the raw URL pointing to the external web resource through the<br>
web proxy.<br>
7. The web proxy identifies the request and its http context ticket, and retrieves the<br>
stored authentication state and cookie state from the database. The authentication<br>
state and cookie state are re-injected into the upstream request sent to the resource.<br>
8. The external web resource receives the incoming request and attempts to<br>
identify a session cookie in the incoming request and confirms that the request is<br>
authorized. The external web resource sends the word processing document<br>
downstream back to the Web Proxy<br>
9. The Web Proxy receives the downstream response and proxies the response to<br>
the hosted application (MS WORD in this example).<br>
In one embodiment, the initial request from the web browser on the local<br>
machine to download the external web resource for activation begins when a user of<br>
the local machine selects a link in the web browser. In some embodiments, the<br>
present invention utilizes two established connections from the local machine to the<br>
servers. In one of these embodiments, the first connection may be an HTTP request<br>
sent from a web browser on the local machine that is pointed to the web proxy. In<br>
another of these embodiments, the second connection may be a connection, such as an<br>
ICA or other presentation layer protocol connection, between the client agent on the<br>
local machine and the application server. Once the second connection has been made,<br>
an application hosted by the application server uses the web proxy to provide HTTP<br>
authentication and cookie state to the external web resource, allowing the resource to<br>
be accessed.<br>
While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference<br>
to specific preferred embodiments, it should be understood by those skilled in the art<br>
that various changes in form and detail may be made therein departing from the spirit<br>
and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br>
