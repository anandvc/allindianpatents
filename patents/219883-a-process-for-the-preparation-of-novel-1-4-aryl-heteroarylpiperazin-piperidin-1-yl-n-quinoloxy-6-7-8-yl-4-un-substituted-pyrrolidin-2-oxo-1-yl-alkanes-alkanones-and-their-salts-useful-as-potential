PharmacologicaS Acdvitics :<br>
The compounds of invention show marked anti-ischemic/cardioprotective activity with few of them showing mild hypotensive activity and can be used as therapeutic agents in disease arising out of ischemia such as myocardial ischemia. Angina Pectoris myocardial infarction, any cardiac surgical intervention renal ischemia, stroke and trauma. Some of the compounds have also shown antiinflammatory activity and can be used as therapeutic agents in diseases arising out of inflammatory disorders like rheumatism, arthretis etc.<br>
Cardioprotective Activities:<br>
The most important and intersting observations is cardioprotective/anti-ischemic activity against myocardial stunning at a much smaller dose. Isolated perfused rat heart preparation (Langendorff) were allowed to equilibriate for 30 min. before subjecting to 45 min. of global ischemia followed by 30 min. reperfusion period. Compounds under test were administered during reperfusion period at a concentration of 10 nM.<br>
The recovery of mechanical function (start of heart beat) with treated group was much earlier than control group. The incidence of reperfusion induced arrhythmia was either reduced or absent with test compounds when compared with control. Results are given in Table No. 1.<br>
2.	Effect on blood pressure, heart rate, respiration and on standard vasopressor and<br>
vasopressor responses.<br>
Pentobarbitone sodium (40 mg/kg i.p.) Anaesthetized cats of either sex weight 2.5-4.0 kg body weight were used for this study. Majority of them were normotensive but three of them were naturally hypertensive (basal mean arterial blood pressure &gt; 160 mm Hg). Results are summarised in Table No. 2.<br>
3.	Antiinfiammatory Activity:<br>
Some of these compounds were screened for Anti-inflammatory activity using Carrageenin induced paw oedema in rats in a dose of 100 µmol.p.o.and compared with Ibuprofen (l00µmoI.p.o.). p.o.). Results are summarised in Table No. 3.<br>

Example 54: Antihyperteusive/hypotensive activity<br>
(a) Cats (2.6-4.0 kg) of either sex anaesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium (40 mg/kg i.v.) and<br>
showing basal mean arterial blood pressure below 150 mm (Hg) were categorised as normotensive and above 150 mm Hg as hypertensive. Arterial blood pressure (BP) was recorded from one of the carotid artery through a stathum P23 DC pressure transducer and 7P1 low level DC preamplifier on a Grass Model P7 Polygraph, Signals from 7P1 preamplifier were used to trigger 7P4 Tachograph preamplifier for recording the heart rate (HR). Right femoral vein and Trachea were cannulated for intravenous injections and artificial ventilation respectively. Control responses to intravenous injection of noradrenaline (2-4 ug); acetyl choline (1-2 jug); histamine (1-2 µg) and isoprenaline (1-2 ug) were taken before and after the administration of test doses of each compounds. The compounds were tested at fixed doses of 2.0 and 10 µM/kg i.v. Significant results are given in Table 1.<br>
(b) Antihypertensive activity was observed in naturally hypertensive cats, rat abdominal aorta coarctation model of hypertension (Liu, J;. Bishop, S.P. &amp; Overbeck, H. W. Morphometric evidence for non pressure related arterial wall thickening in hypertension Circ. Res. 62, 1001-1010,1988) and L-NAME (No synthase inhibitor) induced hypertensive cats.<br>
Example 55 : Cardioprotective/antiischemic activity<br>
The rats were killed by decaptitation, heart were rapidly excised and placed in ice-cold HEPES tyrode buffer. Then isolated hearts were perfused retrogradely through coronary arteries using the Langendorff technique. The perfusion buffer consisted (in mM) NaCl 137, KC1 5.4, CaCl2 1.8, MgCl21.0, glucose 11.2 and HEPES 3.0. The buffer (pH 7.4) was continuously gassed with oxygen and maintained at 37°C. Coronary flow rate was maintained at 10 ml/min. The heart contracted spontaneously.<br>
The perfused heart was allowed to equillibrate for 30 min. before initiation of any insult protocol. The test compounds were given at the time of reperfusion. Some of the compounds were dissolved in ethanol. Final concentration of ethanol in the perfusion buffer was 0.0001% and had no effect of its own on the parameter used.<br>
(a) For brief period of ischemic insult (Hideo et al. Pathophysiology and pathogenesis of stunned myocardium. J. Clin. Invest., 79,950-961,1987). Ischemia was initiated by stopping the flow for<br>
16 min. followed by 30 min. reperfusion period. The durations were decided on the initial pilot experiments leading to 50% recovery of function.<br>
(b) For prolong period of ischemic insult (Becker, L.C. &amp; Ambrosio, G. Myocardial consenquences of reperfusion. Prog. Cardiovas. Dis., 30, 23-44, 1987). Ischemia was initiated by stopping the flow for 30 min. followed by 30 min. reperfusion.<br>
Example 56: Antiinflammatory Activity:<br>
The oedema in one of the hind paw of rats is induced by injection of 0.1 ml of 1% carrageenin solution into the planter aponeurosis. Volume of the paw is measured plethysmographically immediately after and three hours after the injection of the irritant. The difference in the volume gives the amount of oedema developed. Mean percent inhibition of the oedema between control group and compound treated group is calculated and compared with the group receiving standard drug Ibuprofen (100 µmolp.o.). Each group consist of five adult rats of either sex weighing 125-150 g. Results are summarised in Table No. 3.<br><br><br><br><br>
