				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a built, heavy duty laundry detergent composition, in either liquid, or granular form, which contain certain types of modified cellulose ether materials to impart appearance and integrity benefits to fabrics and textiles laundered in washing solutions formed from such compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, of course, well known that alternating cycles of using and laundering fabrics and textiles, such as articles of worn clothing and apparel, will inevitably adversely affect the appearance and integrity of the fabric and textile items so used and laundered. Fabrics and textiles simply wear out over time and with use. Laundering of fabrics and textiles is necessary to remove soils and stains which accumulate therein and thereon during ordinary use. However, the laundering operation itself, over many cycles, can accentuate and contribute to the deterioration of the integrity and the appearance of such fabrics and textiles.<br>
Deterioration of fabric integrity and appearance,can'-manifest itself in several ways. Short fibers are dislodged from woven and knit fabric/textile structures by the mechanical action of laundering. These dislodged fibersjnay form lint, fuzz or "pills" which are visible on the surface of fabrics and diminish the appearance of newness of the fabric. Further, repeated laundering of fabrics and textiles, especially with bleach-containing laundry products, can remove dye from fabrics and textiles<br>
and impart a faded, worn out appearance as a result of diminished color intensity, and in many cases, as a result of changes in hues or shades of color<br>
Given the foregoing, there is clearly an ongoing need to identify materials which could be added to laundry detergent products that would associate themselves with the fibers of the fabrics and textiles laundered using such detergent products and thereby reduce or minimize the tendency of the laundered fabric/textiles to deteriorate in appearance. Any such detergent product additive material should, of course, be able to benefit fabric appearance and integrity without unduly interfering with the ability of the laundry detergent to perform its fabric cleaning function. The present invention is directed to detergent compositions containing certain types of cellulosic materials that perform in this desired manner.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The laundry detergent compositions herein comprise from about 1% to 80% by weight of a detersive surfactant, from about 0.1% to 80% by weight of an organic or inorganic detergency builder and from about 0.1% to 8% by weight of certain types of modified cellulose ether fabric treatment agents. The detersive surfactant and detergency builder materials can be any of those useful in conventional laundry detergent products. The modified cellulose ether materials are those which have a molecular weight of from about 10,000 to 2,000,000 and are comprised of repeating substituted anhydroglucose units corresponding to the general Structural Formulas Nos. I, II and III set forth hereinafter in the "Detailed Description of the Invention" section. (In the Structural Formulas hereinafter set forth, substituents are shown in specific positions on the anhydroglucose rings which repeat to form the substituted cellulose ether polymers. It should be understood that this is for illustration purposes only and that such substituents may be found on any of the carbon atoms of the anhydroglucose rings.)<br>
One useful type of cellulose ethers comprises hydrophobically-modified, nonionic materials with anhydroglucose ring alkyl substitution ranging from about 0.1% to 5% by weight of the cellulose ether. Ring stibstituents are alkoxylated in amounts ranging from about 1 to 20 moles.<br>
A second useful type of cellulose ether comprises cationic cellulose .ether materials which may have anhydroglucose ring alkyl substitution ranging from about 0.1% to 5% by weight of the cellulose ether. Anhydroglucose ring substituents<br>
contain from about 1 to 20 moles of alkoxylation and from about 0.005 to 0.5 moles of quaternary ammonium cationic moieties.<br>
A third type of cellulose ether comprises anionic cellulose ether materials which may have anhydroglucose ring alky! substitution ranging from about 0.1% to 5% by weight of the cellulose ether. The anydroglucose rings in such anionic materials also have a degree of carboxymethyl substitution ranging from about 0.05 to 2.5. Combinations of the nonionic, cationic and anionic modified cellulose ethers can also be employed.<br>
In its method aspect, the present invention relates to the laundering or treating of fabrics and textiles in aqueous washing or treating solutions formed from effective amounts of the detergent compositions described herein, or formed from the individual components of such compositions. Laundering of fabrics and textiles in such washing solutions, followed by rinsing and drying, imparts fabric appearance benefits to the fabric and textile articles so treated. Such benefits can include improved overall appearance, pill/fuzz reduction, antifading, improved abrasion resistance, and/or enhanced softness.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As noted, the laundry detergent compositions of the present invention essentially contain detersive surfactant, detergent builder and certain modified cellulose ether fabric treatment agents which serve to enhance fabric appearance and integrity upon use of the detergent compositions to launder fabrics and textiles.

Enzymes are normally incorporated into detergent compositions at levels sufficient to provide a "cleaning-effective amount". The term "cleaning-effective amount" refers to any amount capable of producing a cleaning, stain removal, soil removal, whitening, deodorizing, or freshness improving effect on substrates such as fabrics. In practical terms for current commercial preparations, typical amounts are up to about 5 mg by weight, more typically 0.01 mg to 3 mg, of active'enzyme per gram of the detergent composition. Stated otherwise, the compositions herein will typically comprise from 0.001% to 5%, preferably 0.01%-1% by weight of a commercial enzyme preparation. Protease enzymes are usuaUy present in such commercial preparations at levels sufficient to provide from 0.005 to 0.1 Anson units (ATI) of activity per gram of composition Higher active levels may be desirable in highly concentrated detergent formulations.<br>
Suitable examples of proteases are the subtilisins- which are obtained from particular strains of B, svbtilis and B. licheniformis. ^pne suitable protease is obtained from a strain of Bacillus, having maximum activity throughout the pH range of 8-12, developed and sold as ESPERASE® by Novo-Industries A/S of Denmark, hereinafter 'Novo", The preparation of this enzyme and analogous enzymes is described ui GB 1,243,784 to Novo. Other suitable proteases include ALCALASE® and SAVINASE® from Novo and MAXATASE® from International Bio-<br>
Synthetics, Inc., The Netherlands; as well as Protease A as disclosed in EP 130,756 A, January 9, 1985 and Protease B as disclosed in EP 303,761 A, April 28, 1987 and EP 130,756 A, January 9, 1985. See also a high pH protease from Bacillus sp, NCIMB 40338 described in WO 9318140 A to Novo. Enzymatic detergents comprising protease, one or more other enzymes, and a reversible protease inhibitor are described in WO 9203529 A to Novo. Other preferred proteases include those of WO 9510591 A to Procter &amp; Gamble . When desired, a protease having decreased adsorption and increased hydrolysis is available as described in WO 9507791 to Procter &amp; Gamble. A recombinant trypsin-like protease for detergents suitable herein is described in WO 9425583 to Novo,<br>
Cellulases usable herein include both bacterial and fungal types, preferably having a pH optimum between 5 and 10. U.S. 4,435,307, Barbesgoard et al, March 6, 1984, discloses suitable fungal celluloses from Humicola insolens or Humicola strain DSM1800 or a cellulase 212-producing fungus belonging to the genus Aeromonas, and cellulase extracted from the hepatopancreas of a marine mollusk, Dolabetta Auricula Solander, Suitable cellulases are also disclosed in GB-A-2.075.028; GB-A-2.095.275 and DE-OS-2.247.832. CAREZYME® and CELLUZYME® (Novo) are especially useful. See also WO 9117243 to Novo,<br>
Suitable Upase enzymes for detergent usage include those produced by microorganisms of the Pseudomonas group, such as Psevtfomonas stulzeri ATCC 19,154, as disclosed in GB 1,372,034, See also Upases in Japanese Patent Application 53,20487, laid open Feb. 24, 1978. This Hpase is available from Amano Pharmaceutical Go. Ltd., Nagoya, Japan, under the trade name Lipase P "Amano," or "Amano-P.11 Other suitable commercial lipases include Amano-CES, Upases ex Chromobacter viscosum, e.g. Chromobacter viscosum var, lipolyticum NRRLB 3673 from Toyo Jozo Co,, Tagata, Japan; Chromobacter viscosum lipases from U.S, Biochemical Corp., U.S.A. and Disoynth Co., The Netherlands, and lipases ex Pseudomonas gladioli. LIPOLASE® enzyme derived from Humicola lanuginosa and commercially available from Novo, see also EP 341,947, is a preferred lipase for use herein.<br>
The enzyme-containing compositions herein may optionally also comprise from about 0.001% to about 10%, preferably from about 0.005% to about 8%, most preferably from about 0.01% to about 6%, by weight of an enzyme stabilizing system. The enzyme stabilizing system can be any stabilizing system which is compatible with the detersive enzyme, Such a system may be inherently provided by other formulation actives, or be added separately, e.g., by the formulator or by a<br>
manufacturer of detergent-ready enzymes. Such stabilizing systems can, for example, comprise calcium ion, boric acid, propylene glycol, short chain carboxylic acids, boronic acids, and mixtures thereof, and are designed to address different stabilization problems depending on the type and physical form of the detergent composition.<br>
E) Detergent Composition Preparation<br>
The detergent compositions according to the present invention can be in liquid, paste or granular forms. Such compositions can be prepared by combining the essential and optional components in the requisite concentrations in any suitable order and by any conventional means.<br>
Granular compositions, for example, are generally made by combining base granule ingredients (e,g, surfactants, builders, water, etc.) as a slurry, and spray drying the resulting slurry to a low level of residual moisture (5-12%), The remaining dry ingredients can be admixed in granular powder form with the spray dried granules in a rotary mixing drum and the liquid ingredients (e.g. organic solutions of the essential cellulosic polymers, enzymes, binders and perfumes) can be sprayed onto the resulting granules to form the finished detergent composition. Granular compositions according to the present invention can also be in "compact form", i.e. they may have a relatively higher density than conventional granular detergents, i.e. from 550 to 950 g/1. In such case, the granular detergent compositions according to the present invention will contain a lower amount of "inorganic filler salt", compared to conventional granular detergents; typical filler salts are alkaline earth metal salts of sulphates and chlorides, typically sodium sulphate; "compact" detergents typically comprise not more than 10% filler salt.<br>
Liquid detergent compositions can be prepared by admixing the essential and optional ingredients thereof in any desired order to provide compositions containing components in the requisite concentrations. Liquid compositions according to the present invention can alsoxbe in "compact form", in such case, the liquid detergent compositions according to the present invention will contain a lower amount of<br>
water, compared to conventional liquid detergents<br>
Addition of the cellulose ether component to liquid detergent compositions of this invention may be accomplished by simply mixing into the liquid dertergent aqueous solutions of the desired cellulose ethers. Cellulose ethers can alter the viscosity or other Theological characteristics of liquid detergent products. It may<br>
therefore be necessary to compensate for any rheological changes in the liquid detergent product brought about by cellulose ether addition by altering the type and amount of hydrotropes and/or solvents that are used.<br>
F)	Fabric Laundering Method<br>
The present invention also provides a method for laundering fabrics in a manner which imparts fabric appearance benefits provided by the cellulosic polymers used herein. Such a method employs contacting these fabrics with an aqueous washing solution formed from an effective amount of the detergent compositions hereinbefore described or formed from the individual components of such compositions. Contacting of fabrics with washing solution will generally occur under conditions of agitation although the compositions of the present invention may also be used to form aqueous unagitated soaking solutions for fabric cleaning and treatment.<br>
Agitation is preferably provided in a washing machine for good cleaning. Washing is preferably followed by drying the wet fabric in a conventional clothes dryer. An effective amount of the liquid or granular detergent composition in the aqueous wash solution in the washing machine is preferably from about 500 to about 7000 ppm, more preferably from about 1000 to about 3000 ppm.<br>
G)	Fabric Conditioning<br>
The modified cellulose ethers hereinbefore described as components of the laundry detergent compositions herein may also be used to treat and condition fabrics and textiles in the absence of the surfactant and builder components of the detergent composition embodiments of this invention. Thus, for example, a fabric conditioning composition comprising only the modified cellulose ethers themselves, or comprising an aqueous solution of the modified cellulose ethers, may be added during the rinse cycle of a conventional home laundering operation in order to impart the desired fabric appearance and integrity benefits hereinbefore described.<br>

The representative modified cellulosic polymers used in ttfe liquid and granular detergent compositions described in Examples I and II are characterized in Table C. The various substituents listed are those from Structural Formulas Nos. I, II and III described hereinbefore.<br>
Table_C<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Test compositions prepared as described in Examples I and II are evaluated for the<br>
effects that the various cellulosic polymers of Example III provide when samples of fabrics or garments are washed using the test compositions as described, all under identical conditions, A control sample with no polymer is usually compared to one composition with a test polymer to be evaluated. Testing conditions are also carefully monitored. Examples of controlled conditions include: wash time, wash<br>
water temperature and hardness; washer agitation; rinse time, rinse water temperature and hardness; dryer time and temperature; wash load fiber content and weight,<br>
EXAMPLE IV<br>
Overall Appearance<br>
In an Overall Appearance test, fabrics are washed using various test compositions containing either no cellulosic polymers or one of the Example in cellulosic polymers. The fabrics so washed after ten cycles are then comparatively graded by three judges who evaluate the overall appearance of the washed fabrics. It is the decision of the judge as to what is to be evaluated unless specific direction is given to evaluate one attribute such as color, pilling, fuzz, etc,<br>
In the Overall Appearance test, the visual preference of the judge is expressed using<br>
the Scheff scale.<br>
That is:	0 = No difference<br>
1	= I think this one is better (unsure),<br>
2	= 1 know this one is a little better.<br>
3	= 1 know this one is a lot better.<br>
4	= 1 know this one is a whole lot better.<br>
For the Overall Appearance test, laundering conditions are as follows: Washer Type: Kenmore (17 gallons) Wash Time: 12min Wash Temperature: 90°F(32.2°C) Wash Water Hardness: 6 grains per gallon Washer Agitation; normal Rinse Time: 2min Rinse Temperature: 60°F (15,6°C) Rinse Water Hardness: 6 grains per gallon Wash Load Fabric.Content: various colored and white garments and<br>
fabrics Wash Load Weight: 5,5 Ibs (2.5 kg)<br>

EXAMPLE V<br>
Pill Reduction<br>
In a Pill Reduction test, fabrics are washed using the various test compositions containing either no cellulosic polymers or one of the Example III cellulosic polymers. The fabrics so washed are then graded for Pill Reduction using a computer-assisted pilling image analysis system which employs image analysis to measure the number of pills on Jested garments and fabrics. Pill reduction is calculated as:<br>
PiU reduction(%) = { l# pills (control) - # pills (polymer*)] / # pills (control) }x 100%<br>
For the Pill Reduction test, laundering conditions are the same as used for the Overall Appearance test described hereinbefore in ExampleIV.<br>

EXAMPLE VI<br>
Color Protection<br>
In a Color Protection test, fabrics are washed using various test compositions containing either no cellulosic polymers or one of the Example III cellulosic polymers. The fabrics so washed are then tested with a Hunter colorimeter in order to determine a Delta E* value for each fabric tested. Delta E* is defined as the color difference (reflectance intensity, hue shift, etc.) between washed fabrics and unwashed fabrics.<br>
For the Color Protection test, laundering conditions are the same as used for the Overall Appearance test described hereinbefore in Example IV.<br>
The extent of Color Protection provided is based on percent of Delta E* difference compared to an unwashed sample. Color protection is calculated as:<br>
% Color Protection - { [dE'(coiitrol) - dE»(polymers)] / dE*(control)} 1100% The average color protection test results are shown in Tables H and I.<br>
