BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present- invention relates to an umbilical cord combined disinfectant, clamp, cutter and containment device for, for example, the reduction of infection in hospitals, developing areas and disaster and refugee situations, and more particularly to an obstetrical disinfecter, clamp, cutter and containment system for umbilical cords, using a device housing disinfectant, umbilical clamps and cutters that is able to be broken apart with the infant's side left in place on the umbilical cord until the cord atrophies, and it and the device fall off from the infant.<br>
A baby's umbilical cord is a tubular structure, containing two arteries and one vein which connect the fetus to the maternal placenta. While in utero, the cord serves as a medium for the exchange of waste products and oxygen and nutrients between the mother and her fetus. In delivery of a newborn infant, once the fetus has traversed the birthing (vaginal) canal, it is necessary to separate the infant from the maternal placenta by cutting the umbilical cord and interrupt the loss of blood/ which would otherwise occur, by means of clamps. At birth, the method for severing the umbilical cord involves the use of tying devices<br><br>
-2-<br>
to clamp the cord for the stoppage of blood flow and a type of sharp blade to sever the cord between the two clamped points.<br>
In developing areas and disaster and refugee situations where health care infrastructure and water are scarce or nonexistent, most women deliver their infants with the help of family or traditional birth attendants on dirt floors, unsanitary mats or in the fields. The traditional method for severing the umbilical cord is to use string or bamboo to clamp the cord and a severing type implement, often contaminated, to cut the cord.<br>
Following birth, according to some cultures, the umbilical cord is coated with various substances, such as cow dung or clarified butter ghee, which may be contaminated with bacterial and viral contaminants, especially the Clostridium Tetani organism. With such unsanitary conditions, there exists a much higher rate of infant and maternal mortality due to infectious processes, such as bacterial infections and neonatal tetanus, taking the lives of one-half million (500,000) infants worldwide in the first few days of life.<br>
There has been an effort by development agencies and disaster agencies to provide birthing kits, but these typically involve several items, many which can be contaminated, lost or undesirably reused in another delivery process.<br>
In contrast the present invention provides an easily used and beneficial device to simultaneously disinfect the umbilical cord at the area where it is severed, clamp and cut the cord. In addition, the device of the invention maintains a clean environment by allowing the device to then be separated into two parts, leaving the device in place on the infant, thereby protectively containing the cut cord portion for a desirable period of time, eliminating access to the umbilical stump wound where organisms can enter, until the cut cord portion atrophies and falls off.<br><br>
-3-<br>
A list of prior patents having to do with some prior umbilical cord devices, which may be of interest, is provided below:<br>
Patent No.	Inventor	Issue Date<br>
1,710,766	Dilworth<br>
3,106,919	Churchville<br>
3,323,208	Hurley, Jr.<br>
4,026,294	Matler<br>
4,716,886	Schulman et al.	01/05/88<br>
4,781,188	Collins	11/01/88<br>
However, each of these devices suffer from the disadvantage of failing to contain a nonreusable, comprehensive disinfecting, and a clamping and cutting system that reduces the incidence of bacteria entering the umbilical cord and causing infection. In addition, some of the above devices have several parts, which can be dislodged and render the umbilical cord device unusable.<br>
Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide a device which is able to simultaneously disinfect, clamp and sever the umbilical cord within a clean environment, and following, to twist the device and separate the .fetal and maternal ends of.the,umbjlical cord while leaving them in a bacteria protected environment.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a comprehensive unit with clamps built into the housing of the preferably nonmetallic unit, which is inexpensive to produce, thereby permitting the device, for example, to be provided at low cost for developing areas and in disaster and refugee situations.<br>
A further, added feature of the present invention is the protection of health care personnel. When the umbilical device of the present invention is utilized, there will be a reduction in the amount of blood fluid<br><br>
-4-<br>
spurt at the time of cord  severance, thus decreasing  occupational exposure to persons assisting with the birth.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, these and other objectives are achieved in the following manner. The present invention's housing is comprised preferably of nonmetallic material and includes a comprehensive, combined system for the disinfection, clamping and severing of the umbilical cord in a single step, with part of the device being protectively left on the infant's part of the severed cord for a desirable but relatively short period of time.<br>
The device preferably is rectangular in shape in longitudinal cross-section and has rounded corners, shaped, for example, somewhat like a cylindrical barrel and being of the exemplary dimensions of exactly or at least about two inches by three and a half inches (2" x 3.5") in longitudinal cross-section in width and length, respectively, with an exemplary diameter of about one inch (1"). In the midportion of the housing of the unit, there preferably is a perforated line or other weakened area, which, when twisted, allows the easy separation of the two end halves of the unit from one another, including one end half to be protectively left on the infant for a limited period of time.<br>
The exemplary embodiment's preferred triple clamping device employs at least two clamps in close proximity to each other, preferably with an additional, intermediate clamp to ensure stoppage of blood on the fetal end of the umbilical cord, each clamp being part of the overall housing of the preferably ponmstallic unit. The device is connected along one side by a hinge portion for allowing one side half to be pivot-ally moved toward the other side half, along with a latching device located at the other, opposed side for keeping the clamped side halves<br><br>
-5-<br>
in a closed position. The clamps preferably are identical to each other, preferably having one or more serrated teeth to ensure maximum compression of the cord and secure locking of the unit's side halves when closed. Once latchingly closed, the clamps preferably cannot be reopened, which, of course, facilitates the continuance of a clean, protective environment over the cut portion of the cord.<br>
The embodiment's exemplary four cutting blades of the device preferably are located adjacent to the middle partitions of the device and the clamps closest in proximity to one another. The preferably metallic cutting blades are attached to the housing of the unit, preferably two on the top side portion of the unit and two on the bottom side portion of the unit, preferably being molded into the housing of the unit, preferably forming an integrated unit with no loose parts.<br>
Overlaying the middle clamps and cutting blades is preferably a thin plastic membrane containing a liquid disinfectant solution, for example, seventy percent (70%) isopropyl alcohol. This acts as a disinfectant and comes in contact with the umbilical cord, bursting the membrane and bathing the umbilical cord with the disinfectant preferably before the cord is severed.<br>
As now should be understood, a primary advantage of the present invention over other devices is it's ability to disinfect, clamp and cut the umbilical cord in a clean environment, in one quick and easy step, while then allowing the fetal and maternal ends of the cord to be separated while maintaining a clean environment for at least the infant's side of the cord cut portion until the umbilical stump atrophies and falls off.<br>
ACCOMPANYING BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING(S)<br>
For a further understanding of the nature and objects of the present invention, reference should be had to the following detailed<br><br>
-6-<br>
description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like elements are given the same or analogous reference numbers, and wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of an initial, exemplary embodiment of the umbilical device of the present invention, shown in its fully open disposition; while<br>
Figure 2 is a plan view of the exemplary umbilical device of Figure 1, likewise in its fully open disposition; and<br>
Figures 3 and 4 are cross-section views of the exemplary umbilical device of Figure 1, taken along section lines 3-3 and 4-4, respectively; while<br>
Figures 5, 6 and 7 are perspective views of the exemplary umbilical device of Figure 1, but shown in its half-open/half-closed, three-quarters, and fully closed dispositions, respectively.<br>
Figure 8 is a perspective view, similar to that of Figure 1, but of second, alternative, exemplary embodiment in which more serrated teeth are included on the clamping arms for greater security in keeping the device closed after it has been applied to the umbilical cord, particularly on the infant's portion of the severed cord.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Figures 1-7 illustrate the initial, exemplary, preferred embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention of the fully contained, preferably nonmetallic housing which preferably contains the basic housing and clamps molded as one, single unit. The initial, exemplary umbilical device of the present invention will be illustrated by the number 10 with the umbilical cord generally designated "UC."<br>
In Figure 1 is the illustration of the composite apparatus 10, having rounded edges and an overall cylindrical, barrel-like shape (when closed;<br><br>
-7-<br>
see Figure 7), including an upper (16) and lower (17) half, side portions, made preferably of a nonmetallic molded material, such as, for example, molded plastic. The movement of and general structure of the upper, half, side portion 16 of the unit 10 and the lower, half, side portion (17) of the unit 10 are similar in shape and size and pivotally moveable relative to one another (note curved direction arrow) between a fully open disposition, as seen in Figures 1 and 2, and a fully closed disposition, as seen in Figure 7. The movement of the top portion 1 6 to the bottom portion 17 in relation to one another is accomplished by an effective hinge piece or portion 18/19 preferably integrally molded as part of the nonmetallic housing joined to the back edge 18 of the top half 16 (Figure 1) and the back edge 19 of the bottom half portion 17, so that the top portion 16 and bottom portion 17 will be forcibly closed over and around the umbilical cord to attain a closed position when in use.<br>
In Figures 1 and 2, located at the midportion of the outer aspect of the housing is a perforated line or weakened area 26, which, when the interior fetal 12, 13 and maternal 14, 15 portions of the device 10 are twisted with respect to one another, will cause the unit to separate into two sub-units 10A and 10B. As seen in Figure 2, each unit has partitions 24 which cover the end of each separable sub-unit 10A and 10B to close them off, particularly the fetal sub-unit 10A, facilitate a clean environment.<br>
Referring particularly to Figure 2, a thin plastic container 25, formed from a single bag as illustrated (or dual, juxtaposed bags) located in the interior of the unit 10 and overlaying both the fetal and maternal interior portions 1 2/13, 14/1 5, respectively, contains a liquid disinfectant solution, such as, for example, seventy percent (70%) isopropyl alcohol, which is attached to the back hinge of the unit 10 to ensure correct<br><br>
-8-<br>
placement near the portion of the umbilical cord that is to be severed. When the umbilical cord is placed horizontally inside the unit 10 on top of the disinfectant container 25 and compressed when closing the top 1 6 and bottom 1 7 portions of the unit 10 together, the container 25 of isopropyl alcohol will burst, bathing the umbilical cord and effectively disinfecting the area to be severed. (For simplicity sake, the disinfectant container 25 shown in Figure 2 is not shown in the other figures.)<br>
As can be seen, inter alia, in Figures 1 and 2, three, parallel sets of opposed, umbilical clamping surfaces 27A/27B, 28A/28B, 29A/29B are substantially identical to each other, except for their relative positions as integral parts of the unit 10. Located at the opposed ends of the clamping surfaces are intermating, locking latching members 30A/30B, 31 A/31 B, 32A/32B, the upper side including latching teeth 33A, 34A and 35A and the lower side including mating, latching openings 30B, 31B and 32B, with the clamping surfaces 27A/27B, 28A/28B and the locking latching members 30A/30B, 31 A/31 B being on the fetal end sub-unit 10A and the opposed clamping surfaces 29A/29B and the latching members 32A/32B being on the maternal end sub-unit 10B. The upper, latching arms 30A, 31A and 32A serve as male members which are inserted and lock into the mating female openings 30B, 31 B and 32B, respectively, securely locking the upper and lower side halves 16 and 17 together when the halves are closed together into the fully closed position illustrated in Figure 7. The clamp interlocking arms and openings or slots 30A/30B, 31 A/31 B, 32A/32B, when locked together, cannot be reopened, facilitating the maintaining of a clean environment with less exposure to pathogenic organisms.<br>
Reference is now made to Figures 1, 5 and 6, illustrating the cutting mechanism or device of the unit 10, in which there are an<br><br>
-9-<br>
exemplary two pair 21 of opposed blades 36A/36B, 37A/37B, for a total of four (4) blades, made preferably of metallic material and bonded into the housing of the unit 10. One set of opposed blades 36A/36B is located adjacent to the opposed clamping surfaces 28A/28B on the fetal side 10A of the unit 10, and the other set 37A/37B is located adjacent to the weakened, perforated line 26 located in the midportion area of the housing, on the opposite side of the line 26 from the first set of blades, on the maternal side 10B of the unit 10.<br>
Internal partitions 24 ultimately serve as the outer end wall surfaces for the sub-units 10A and 10B, when they are separated from one another. When so separated, the fetal sub-unit 10A preferably will have its own opposed, end portions, each having an associated clamping surface, while the maternal sub-unit 10B will have one clamping surface located at its end portion distal to the fetal sub-unit.<br>
An alternative, further exemplary embodiment for the cutting mechanism or device is the use of one or more strands of associated cutting wire extending laterally across the housing in its midportion area in place of the laterally extending cutting blades, or as a further alternative using a single blade or wire working against an appropriate cutting surface, comparable to cutting against a cutting board surface. The housing is preferably cylindrical, as illustrated, or could be configured in an oval shape or box-like shape or some other appropriate shape, preferably longitudinally extended and rounded.<br>
Exemplary dimension for the unit 10 are a longitudinal width of, for example, about three and a half inches {3.5") or about four inches {4"), and a width, for example, of about two inches {2") closed or four inches (4") open. An exemplary diameter is equal to or about one inch (1") and fits comfortably in the human hand for easy manipulation and operation of   the   device.      The   exemplary   widths   of   the   opposed   clamping<br><br>
-10-<br>
surfaces 27A/27B, 28A/28B and 29A/29B are, for example, about a quarter to about three-eighths inches (1/4" to 3/8").<br>
When in use, the housing of the unit 10, with its upper and lower side, halves 16 and 17, is closed around the umbilical cord "UC," which is placed across the longitudinal length of the unit preferably over or under the disinfectant bag 25 or in an intermediate area in the area where the tips of the upper blades 36A and 37A will pass, and, as the closing is taking place, the opposed sets of blades 36A/36B, 37A/37B move with respect to their opposed mates in a scissor-like motion to sever the umbilical cord "UC" from the superior and inferior aspects, effectively cutting and severing the umbilical cord.<br>
Thereafter, the two sub-unit portions 10A and 10B are twisted apart at the weakened, perforation line 26, and separated from one another, producing the fetal sub-unit 10A and the separated maternal sub-unit 10B, with the former being left with the infant until the severed cord portion atrophies and falls off, with the fetal sub-unit. The latter (10B) is disposed of with the maternal after-birth material.<br>
An exemplary alternative embodiment of the umbilical cord combined device 10' is illustrated in Figure 8 and is substantially the same as the initial embodiment 10, except that the clamping or locking, male arms 130A, 131A and 132A have multiple "teeth" or ridge projections 133A, 1 34A and 135A, respectively, which mate with a like number of like configured ridges or indentations contained within the mating female openings 130B, 131 Band 1 32B, in similar fashion to the arms and openings of unit 10. This provides a more secure latch and locking mechanism for the two side halves 16 and 17 when they are closed and latched together (as analogously shown in Figure 7). Because the rest of the structure and the methodology are the same for<br><br>
-11-<br>
the embodiments 10 and 10', the structure and methodology of use for the unit 10' will not be further discussed for brevity's sake.<br>
Thus,   an   exemplary   embodiment   of   the   present   invention preferably includes:<br>
preferably a nonmetallic umbilical-cord/combined-disinfecter-<br>
clamp-and-cutting apparatus as one, integrated unit, preferably<br>
comprising;<br>
a.	A base member or housing 10 (10') having upper and lower,<br>
side-half portions 16 and 17, the upper and lower portions<br>
being   joined   by   a   back   hinge   piece   or  portion   18/19<br>
preferably made of the same nonmetallic material, enabling<br>
the opposed, side-halves to be positioned initially in an open<br>
or subsequently closed disposition (Figure 1 vs. Figure 7) in<br>
relation to each other;<br>
b.	Clamping and associated locking means within the upper and<br>
lower portions of the device, including preferably at least<br>
three   sets   of   parallel,   longitudinally   spaced,   laterally<br>
extended, umbilical clamping surfaces 27A/27B, 28A/28B<br>
and 29A/29B as preferably an integral part of the housing of<br>
the unit, each set of clamping surfaces having associated<br>
therewith a set of an opposed, male arms 30A, 31A and<br>
32A    (130B,    131B    and    132B)    and    matabie    female<br>
openings 30B, 31 Band 32B (130B, 131 Band 132B) at their<br>
opposed edges away from the hinge edge 18/19, the arms<br>
and   opening   becoming   lockingly   engaged   and   latched<br>
together when the unit is fully closed, with the clasp or<br>
latching mechanism preferably being unable to be reopened<br>
once   latchingly   closed;   there   further   preferably   being<br>
included  serrations or roughened  areas on the  opposed<br><br>
-12-<br>
clamping surfaces to enhance the maximum gripping of the umbilical cord upon closure;<br>
c.	An exemplary two pairs of opposed cutting blades 36A/36B,<br>
37A/37B positioned in close proximity to the two medial<br>
partitions, located on the upper and lower portions of the<br>
unit,   so   that,   when   the   unit   is   closed,   each   pair   is<br>
approaching and moving in a scissor-like fashion, causing<br>
the umbilical cord to be severed from the superior and<br>
inferior aspects and ensuring complete severance of the<br>
cord; and<br>
d.	A   plastic   bag   25,   or   other   appropriate   container(s),<br>
containing preferably a liquid disinfectant solution of, for<br>
example,     seventy    percent    (70%)     isopropyl    alcohol,<br>
preferably horizontally overlays the midportion area of the<br>
device, covering both the fetal and maternal aspects of the<br>
device or otherwise positioned to be opened or broken to<br>
dispense the disinfectant in association with the closing of<br>
the unit and the cord severance; the disinfectant being<br>
enclosed within at least one, preferably thin plastic film bag<br>
which cushions the umbilical cord, and bursts upon pressure<br>
when the unit is closed, exposing the umbilical cord to the<br>
seventy   percent   (70%)    isopropyl   alcohol   disinfectant<br>
preferably before cord clamping and cutting take place; the<br>
cutting blades passing through the thin plastic wrapping of<br>
the isopropyl alcohol preferably before the umbilical cord is<br>
severed, effectively disinfecting the cord area.<br>
Additionally,   as   part  of  the  housing   of  the  invention,  there preferably is included:<br><br>
-13-<br>
e. A perforated line or other weakened area encompassing preferably the entire midpoint of the device, allowing easy separation of the fetal and maternal parts of the device by, for example, twisting the two sub-units in opposite directions.<br>
After the unit 10 has been fully closed around the umbilical cord UC, appropriate movement, for example, opposed twisting of the housing at the weakened, perforated line 26, allows the device to be separated into the two individual sub-units 10A and 10B, each sub-unit being within itself a closed and locked sub-unit, one sub-unit 10B housing the maternal end of the umbilical cord and the other sub-unit 10A housing the fetal end of the umbilical cord. The fetal sub-unit 10A is left in place until the umbilical stump atrophies and falls off, providing protection to the infant during this limited waiting time period.<br>
The basic method of application thus involves:<br>
(1) Initially inserting the unit 10 about the umbilical cord "UC";<br>
(2) Moving the two side halves  16 and   17 of the unit  10<br>
together  toward  the   unit's  closing   disposition,   thereby<br>
simultaneous   or   sequentially   bursting   the   disinfectant<br>
solution   container,   disinfecting   the   umbilical   cord,   and<br>
severing the cord in a disinfected environment;<br>
(3) Locking the two halves together as the two halves are fully<br>
closed together;<br>
(4) Thereafter separating the unit into two, fetal and maternal<br>
sub-units   10A  and   10B,   respectively,   by,   for  example,<br>
twisting the sub-unit portions about a weakened area, and,<br>
after separation of the two sub-units; and<br>
(5) Allowing the fetal sub-unit 10A to remain on the infant's<br>
portion of the umbilical cord until the severed cord atrophies<br>
(1) <br>
-14-<br>
and the fetal sub-unit falls off or is otherwise affirmatively<br>
removed when otherwise desired.<br>

comprises:<br>
a weakened area located circumferentially around the mid area portion of said housing; the forcing of the housing in opposite directions on opposite sides of said weakened area causing the housing to be separated into two, individual, separate sub-units, one of which is a fetal sub-unit in which at least one of said two camping surfaces is located, said fetal sub-unit forming a closed enclosure containing at least some of said liquid disinfectant solution and being leaveable on the fetal cord portion of a severed umbilical cord, providing it with a protective environment until the fetal cord portion atrophies and falls off from the infant.<br>
5.	The umbilical cord device as claimed in claim 4, wherein said<br>
fetal subunit has opposed end portions, one of which is located at<br>
said mid-area portion, and wherein said fetal sub-unit comprises   at<br>
least two camping surfaces, one at either opposed end portions<br>
thereof.<br>
6.	The umbilical cord device as claimed in claim 5, wherein there<br>
is :<br><br>
17<br>
at least three of said longitudinally spaced, camping surfaces; and wherein the other of said sub-units is a maternal sub-unit having a distal end portion, and wherein said maternal sub-unit comprises:<br>
at least one camping surface, located at said distal end portion.<br>
7. The umbilical cord device as claimed in claim 4, wherein said<br>
weakened area comprises: a perforated line.<br>
8. The umbilical cord device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said<br>
cutting  device  comprises:   at  least  one  cutting   blade  extending<br>
laterally across said housing.<br>
9. The umbilical cord device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said<br>
cutting   device   comprises:   at   least  one   cutting   wire   extended<br>
laterally across said housing.<br>
10. The umbilical cord device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said<br>
cutting device comprises:<br>
a hinge-like member laterally extending along one side edge of said housing, connecting said upper and lower portions together, allowing said upper and lower portions to hingedly pivot with respect one another to move them from their open disposition to their closed disposition.<br>
11.	The umbilical cord device  as claimed in claim 1, wherein said<br>
housing   is:   longitudinally   extended,   rounded   and   of  a   size  to<br>
conveniently  fit  in   the   user's   hand   for  easy   manipulation   and<br>
operation of the device.<br><br>
12.   A device for severing umbilical cord, substantially as herein described, particularly with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
An obstetrical combined disinfectant, clamp, cutter and containment system for umbilical cords, being housed in a comprehensive unit and having increased efficiency in the area of motion saving and exposure to infectious organisms during the birthing process and when exposure to infectious organisms is undesirable. A housing contains three umbilical clamps as part of the overall housing of the unit and two pair of serrated, cutting blades incorporated into the housing by way of bonding to the housing structure of the unit. After the baby's umbilical cord is placed horizontally in the unit, the disinfectant makes contact with the cutting sites of the umbilical cord, followed by the closing of the unit, simultaneously clamping and cutting the cord, whereafter the unit is twisted at the perforated midpoint, separating the fetal umbilical stump from the maternal end of the umbilical cord. Following separation, both maternal and infant cord ends remain in a clean environment, being totally enclosed in individual compartments. The maternal portion of the device is easily discarded after expulsion of the placenta. The infant's unit will remain in place from five to seven (5-7) days, at which point the cord gradually atrophies and unit falls off.<br></td>
