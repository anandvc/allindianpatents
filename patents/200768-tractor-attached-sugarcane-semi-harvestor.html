				<td>This invention relates to a "SUGARCANE-SEMI-HARVESTOR".<br>
This "SUGARCANE-SEMI-HARVESTOR", provides a mechanized form of sugarcane cutting device, essentially attached to the front portion of the tractor, consisting of two cutter units, one mounted on the top as shown in Figure (2) and another at the bottom, as shown in Eigure (3), each assembled with rotors and blades, both the units mounted on channels to facilitate vertical movement, independent of each other, wherein the top unit carries a three rotor assembly and the bottom unit carries a two rotor assembly, all deriving power for their rotary motion from the hydraulic motors. Further, a provision has been made for a sugarcane intake guide and a cane bender acting as a guide for bendmg purpose. The whole unit is assembled and mounted on a solid steel frame as shown in Figure (1). An additional hydraulic pump has been provided as shown in Figure (4).<br>
The Top-Cutler-Box-Assembly, as shown in Figure (2), basically consists of three hydraulic motors (37 &amp; 38 - 2 numbers). Gatherers for sugarcane intake (41-2 numbers). Rotor with blade assembly (40) and other accessories. It is desired that the Top-Cutter-Box-Assembly is comfortably lifted to a particular height (height of the sugarcane) so that no sugarcane is left over in the top, which goes as a waste after cutting of the cane. After a lot of research work it was found that a Double-Hydraulic Cylinder (30) with suitable Direction Control Valve or the DCV (12) was found very suitable for easy lifting operations. The Hydraulic Cylinder has been fixed both at the top and bottom on strong supports with pins, which are locked with linch pins. The Direction<br><br>
Control Valves have been located close to the Driver's seat, for easy hand operation. The Top-Cutter-Box-Assembly is provided with two Cane Gatherers (4!) for sugarcane intake. A rotor with blade assembly for the Top Unit (40) is appropriately placed between the two Gatherers (41), which rotates Bi-Directional for proper cutting and all the three i.e., the two Gatherers on the rotor with cutter for the top assembly derive their rotary motion from hydraulic motors. The rotor with the cutler assembly (40) rotates in the clockwise direction. Care has been taken to see that all the rotating parts are balanced, which ensures easy rotation and long-livity of the rotating parts. The entire top cutter assembly is moving on strong arm (34) connected for swing. The construction of the top cutter box assembly unit is robust to withstand the enormous cutting pressure and strong vertical channel/box support have been provided on the main frame for the easy vertical movement of the top cutter box assembly. Additional bamboo type tubes (31-2 numbers) and a strong rope-pulley mechanism (32) has also been provided to ensure that the top assembly is always parallel to the ground at 180 Further, this has a heavy duty spring (29) and adjusting U-clamp (28), provided on one side, whereas the other side is connected to the top assembly.<br>
The bottom-cutter-assembly-unit is as shown in Figure (3) on sheet No; 3 of the accompanying drawings, which are essentially provided with a vertical double acting hydraulic cylinder (26). The hydraulic cylinder is connected at the top with strong support and the bottom is welded with holders and a pin with a locking linch-pin is used to ensure that it is in tact. As in the case of top cutter box assembly, two vertical guide supports to the foundation with sliding tube have been welded to the bottom box for easy vertical movement of the cutter<br><br>
box assembly. An additional vertical sliding guide support has been provided at the front of the bottom box, to ensure that the entire bottom cutter box assembly unit moves parallel to the ground so that the cutting is clean and neat. (25) is the main foundation frame assembly (for the top cutter assembly unit) on to which the various parts are assembled/welded. (18) is the pair of cutting blades on the relevant rotors, which essentially rotates in opposite directions and (21) is the pair of intake guides for the cane, which are located in opposite directions and (20) is the pair of sugarcane intake plates. (22) is the idle support stand for top cutter box and (23) is the guide for cane bending and (24) is the cover for the base rotor assembly. The double acting hydraulic cylinder for the base rotor assembly (26) is provided with suitable direction control valves for easy operation and is accommodated by the said of the driver, for easy operations. The bottom cutter box assembly unit is also robust in construction and is made of mild-steel plates and is strong enough to withstand the entire load, as the bottom cutter assembly unit moves up and down. The two rotors (18) are connected to the hydraulic motors on one side from which they derive the rotary motion (Bi-Directional) and to the other side of the rotor shaft, blades are fixed which cut the sugarcane. Normally, each rotor is fixed with 2 to 3 blades. However, this is optional. The rotors always rotate in opposite directions. Both the hydraulic motors are connected in series through direction control valves. All the direction control valves are accommodated besides the driver for easy operation. (14) uf Figure (3) is the vertical guide for the bottom cutter assembly unit whereas (15) is the vertical supporter for the sliding guide. (16) represent the hydraulic motors and (1?) is the vertical sliding guide central for the base assembly. (18) is the rotor assembly with cutters for the bottom cutting assembly unit, which rotate in opposite directions.<br><br>
The circuit pertaining to additional hydraulic pump assembly is as shown in Figure (4) on sheet No: 4 of the accompanying drawings. Initially all the five motors and the two hydraulic cylinders were connected to a tractor in-built pump. However, the tractor pump was not able to take full load of all the equipment. This resulted in a re-design and the provision of an additional hydraulic pump, which is operated by a special power take-off socket. Through this pump, all the five motors are connected with suitable direction control valves. (10) in Figure (4) on sheet No: 4 of the accompanying drawings depicts the foundation assembly for the additional hydraulic pump. (2) is the additional hydraulic pump that has been newly incorporated to take more loads (1) represents the tractor and (3) the guide plate. (4) is the tank provided for the hydraulic oil for the additional pump and (5) is the oil return pipe. (6) is the relief valve for the hydraulic pump and (7) is the level gauge. (8) is the breather assembly and (9) is the cardon shaft. (11) is the distributor and (12) depicts the position of the plurality number of direction control valves. As reflected in Figure (4) of the accompanying drawings, the control valves (12) are located close to the driver's seat, so that he has an easy access over them.<br><br><br>
