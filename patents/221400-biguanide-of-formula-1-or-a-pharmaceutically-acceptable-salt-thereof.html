				<td>BIGUANIDE AND DIHYDROTRIAZINE DERIVATIVES<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]    This application claims the benefit of U.S. Application Serial No. 60/428,306, filed<br>
November 22,2002, and U.S. Application Serial No.	filed November 18,2003,<br>
the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention generally relates to biguanide and dihydrotriazine derivatives. More specifically, the present invention relates to biguanide and dihydrotriazine derivatives, compositions containing biguanide and dihydrotriazine derivatives, methods of using the biguanide and dihydrotriazine derivatives, inter alia, as antimicrobial agents, and methods of making the biguanide and dihydrotriazine derivatives.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Certain dihydrotriazine derivatives have been explored as antimalarial compositions (Onori et al, Ann. 1st Super Sanita., 1989, 25:659-74). However, they are poorly absorbed and have been shown to be less effective in eliciting cures when administered orally, as compared to injection, to malaria-infected Aotus monkeys. These triazine derivatives must be administered by injection to observe activity comparable to or exceeding other known antimalarial drugs and are poorly tolerated when given by the oral route. (Knight et al, I. Ann. Tropical Med. Parasitol, 1980 74:393-404; Knight et al, IV. Ann. Trap. Med. Parasitol 1982 76:9-14; US-A-4,232,022; andUS-A-4,179,562).<br>
[0004] Certain other dihydrotriazine derivatives have been explored as antimicrobial or antimalarial compositions. (US-A-3,723,429)<br>
[0005] US-A-5,322,858 discloses biguanide derivatives, including N1,N5-substituted asymmetrical imidodicarbonimidic diamides, having antimicrobial and antiparasitic activity of various kinds, including antimalarial and antituberculosis activity, and discloses that such compounds provide elevated levels of bioavailability due to their ready absorption when taken orally. While the imidodicarbonimidic diamides exhibited inherent biological activities<br>
ir&gt;. claimed therapeutic applications, significant activities of the claimed compounds may arise 'fly virtue of their conversions, in vivo, to the corresponding dihydrotriazine metabolites.<br>
[0006] More recently, Jensen, et al, J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44, 3925-3931 reported a series of dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors that were effective as antimalarial agents, and unlike earlier antimalarial agents, were not cross-resistant with then- previous counterparts.<br>
[0007] In view of the importance of pharmaceutical compounds with these types of biological activity in the treatment of malaria, and other microbial and parasitic-type diseases and afflictions, compounds with enhanced pharmaceutical properties, and their methods of manufacture, are needed. Such improvements may include, for example, one or more of the following: enhanced biological activity, decreased toxicity, improved stability, better patient drug tolerance, increased solubility, in-use cost effectiveness, improved bioavailability, ease of drug administration, simplicity of manufacture, use of more environmentally friendly reagents, reduced environmental impact of co-generated by-products and their related waste disposal issues, and the like.<br>
[0008] The compounds, processes for their manufacture, methods of use, and compositions of the present invention are directed to these, as well as other, important needs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] The present invention is generally directed to biguanide and dihydrotriazine derivatives, preferably substituted asymmetrical imidodicarbonimidic diamides derived from hydroxylamines, and compositions containing biguanide and dihydrotriazine derivatives. In addition, the present invention is generally directed to methods of using the biguanide and dihydrotriazine derivatives, inter alia, as antimicrobial agents and methods of using the dihydrotriazine derivatives in biological assays. The present invention is generally directed to methods of making the biguanide and dihydrotriazine derivatives.<br>

[0045] All forms of the compounds, including free acid, free base, and zwitterions, isomorphic crystalline forms, all chiral and racemic forms, hydrates, solvates, and acid salt hydrates, are contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention.<br>
$046] Compounds within the scope of the present invention have antimicrobial and antiparasitic activity of various kinds, including antimalarial activity. In some embodiments, they exhibit enhanced biological activity and/or decreased toxicity, especially when administered orally. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the compounds of the invention have shown a higher tolerated dose relative to the compounds disclosed in US-A-5,322,858.<br>
[0047] It is believed the chemical formulas and names used herein correctly and accurately reflect the underlying chemical compounds. However, the nature and value of the present invention does not depend upon the theoretical correctness of these formulae, in whole or in part. Thus it is understood that the formulas used herein, as well as the chemical names attributed to the correspondingly indicated compounds, are not intended to limit the invention in any way, including restricting it to any specific tautomeric form or to any specific optical or geometric isomer.<br>
[0048] The compounds of the present invention may exist in prodrug form. As used herein, "prodrug" is intended to include any covalently bonded carriers that release the active parent drug or whose form is converted, for example, to compounds of formula I or of formula XIII or of other formulas or compounds employed in the methods of the present invention, in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a patient. Since prodrugs are known to enhance numerous desirable qualities of Pharmaceuticals (e.g., solubility, bioavailability, manufacturing, etc.) the compounds employed in the present methods may, if desired, be delivered in prodrug form. Thus, the present invention contemplates methods of delivering prodrugs.<br>
[0049] Prodrugs include, for example, compounds described herein in which a hydroxy; amino, or carboxy group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxyl, free amino, or carboxylic acid, respectively. Examples include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of alcohol and amine functional groups; and alkyl, carbocyclic, aryl, and alkylaryl esters such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, cyclopropyl, phenyl, benzyl, and phenethyl esters, and the like. Prodrugs also include, for example, compounds that cyclize or are metabolized in vivo to a form that is biologically active or enhanced in its biological activity, such as the oxidative metabolism of compounds of formula I to compounds of formula XIII.<br>
When any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent or in any formula, its definition in each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Thus, for example, if an R1 group is shown to be substituted with, for example, 1 to 5 of-CN, -OCF3, haloalkoxy, -SCF3, haloalkylthio, -SR4, -NR5R6, -SO2R4, -SO2NR5R6a, heteroaryl, or heterocyclyl, then the R1 group may optionally be substituted with up to five of the above-mentioned substiruents, and the substituent at each occurrence is selected independently from the above defined list of possible substituents. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. It is further understood that, while certain substituents are minimally required, such as, for example in the R1 moiety, the moiety may be further substituted with the same substituent(s), another substituent(s) from the group of required substituents, or other substituent(s) not from the group of required substituents.<br>

Where the formulations are tablets or capsules and the like the formulations may be presented as premeasured unit doses or in multidose containers from which the appropriate unit dose may be withdrawn.<br>
[0098] Liquid carriers may be used in preparing solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups, and elixirs. The active ingredient of this invention can be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier such as water, an organic solvent, a mixture of both or pharmaceutically acceptable oils or fat. The liquid carrier can contain other suitable pharmaceutical additives such as solubilizers, emulsifiers, buffers, preservatives, sweeteners, flavoring agents, suspending agents,, thickening agents, colors, viscosity regulators, stabilizers, or osmo-regulators. Suitable examples of liquid carriers for oral and parenteral administration include water (particularly containing additives as above, e.g. cellulose derivatives, preferably sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution), alcohols (including monohydric alcohols and polyhydric alcohols e.g. glycols) and their derivatives, and oils (e.g. fractionated coconut oil and arachis oil). For parenteral administration the carrier can also be an oily ester such as ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate. Sterile liquid carriers are used in sterile liquid form compositions for parenteral administration.<br>

Sterile solutions can also be administered intravenously. Oral administration may be either liquid or solid composition form.<br>
[0100] The injectable form may be an aqueous or nonaqueous solution, suspension or emulsion in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid, e.g. sterile pyrogen-free water or parenterally acceptable oils or mixture of liquids which may contain bacteriostatic agents, antioxidants or other preservatives and stabilizers, buffers (preferably but not limited to a physiological pH range of 6.5-7.7, solutes to render the solution isotonic with the blood, thickening agents, suspending agents or other pharmaceutically acceptable additives.

All formulations for injection are preferable as sterile and pyrogen free. Suppositories containing the compound will also contain suitable carriers, e.g. cocoa butter, polyglycols or other state-of-the-art carriers.<br>
[0101] Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition is in unit dosage form, e.g. as tablets, capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, granules, or suppositories. In such form, the composition is sub-divided in unit dose containing appropriate quantities of the active ingredient; the unit dosage forms can be packaged compositions, for example packeted powders, vials, ampoules, prefilled syringes or sachets containing liquids. The unit dosage form can be, for example, a capsule or tablet itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any such compositions in package form.<br>
[0102] In addition to standard pharmaceutical additives there may be included within formulations of the compound other therapeutic agents, particularly including other antimalarial agents and antiinfective agents.

R'-DH<br>

XV<br>
wherein:<br>

for a time and under conditions sufficient to provide the compound of the formula .

[0107] The route shown directly below is valid where D is -O-, -S-, or -N(R9)- and R&amp; is hydrogen or acyl in the intended compound (la). Where the starting material is an alkanol (VI), an excess of the alkanol is utilized and the desired reactant quantity is treated with one equivalent of alkali metal sodium to form the alkali metal salt in alkanolic solution.<br>
[0108] In instances where the desired phenol is not commercially available, it may be prepared, for example, from the corresponding aromatic amine through its diazonium ion. (See F. A. Carey and R. J. Sundberg, Advanced Organic Chemistry, Part B: Reactions and Synthesis, 3rd Ed., p. 588-591, Plenum Press, New York (1990) and R. C. Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers, New York, (1989)<br>
[0109] In the case of amines, thiols, or phenols (VI), an excess of base is utilized, suitably aqueous alkali hydroxide or alkali carbonate. An excess of dihaloalkane, di-methanesulfonate, or di-para-toluenesulfonate (VII) is then added, suitably a 2-fold excess over the calculated amount of VI. When an aqueous solution is employed, a surfactant or phase transfer agent may be added to enhance the interaction of the phases. The mixture is heated with stirring at a temperature in the range of about 50°C to about 100°C for a time in the range of about 1 hour to about 48 hours, preferably about 12 hours to about 48 hours. The mixture is cooled, and the organic layer is separated. Distillation under reduced pressure, or separation by column chromatography provides the desired oxy-, amino-, of thioalkyl halide (IV), its corresponding methanesulfonate, orpara-toluenesulfonate.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
 [0110] Alternatively, the desired oxy-, amino-, or thioalkyl halide (IV), or its corresponding methanesulfonate, or para-toluenesulfonate may be prepared by contacting a compound of the formula XIV with an alcohol halogenation agent or alcohol sulfonation agent. NonT<br>
Smiting examples of typical reagents or conditions of use can be found in Larock, R. C. Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCJ Publishers, Inc. NY, 353-363 (1989) and Greene, T. W. and Wuts, P. G. M. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. NY, 117-118 (1991), incorporated herein by reference, in their entireties. The compound of formula XIV may be prepared by contacting a compound of the formula VI with a compound of formula XV (X-R2-OH), wherein R2 is C2-Cio alkylene, for a time and under conditions similar to those utilized in the production of a compound of formula IV through contacting of a compound of formula VI with a compound of formula VII.<br>
[0111] Acetohydroxamic acid, N-hydroxyacetimidate, or a functional equivalent is converted into the corresponding alkali metal salt in an alcohol solution by addition of base. Suitable bases include those bases which can effectively deprotonate the acidic proton in acetohydroxamic acid, and include, but are not limited to, NaOH, KOH, alkali metal salts of alkanols, alkali metal carbonates, KH, NaH, and the like. The oxy-, arnino-, or thioalkyl halide (IV), or its corresponding methanesulfonate, or /?ara-toluenesulfonate, produced as above, is then added and the mixture heated to a temperature in the range of about 45 °C to 70°C for a time in the range of about 1 to 24 hours, preferably between about 12 to 24 hours. The solvents are removed under reduced pressure and the residue is partitioned between water and a water-immiscible, organic solvent. The organic solvent is dried, filtered, and evaporated to give the anticipated oxy-, amino-, or thioalkyl acetohydroxamate (Va) or imidate derivative (Vb).<br>
[0112] The acetohydroxamate hydrochloride(Va) or imidate derivative (Vb) is taken up in an alkanol, optionally with an excess of dilute mineral acid added, suitably hydrochloric acid, preferably without excess acid, and the mixture is heated under reflux for a time in the range of about 2 to about 24 hours, preferably about 16 hours, and the solvents are removed under reduced pressure to give the desired alkoxyamine (II, as its hydrochloride salt).<br>
[0113] The alkoxyamine hydrochloride (II) is taken up in an alkanol and the appropriate omega-substituted dicyandiamide (HI), for example, a lower alkyl dicyandiamide, is added. The mixture is heated under reflux for a time in the range of about 4 to about 24 hours. The resulting solution may be diluted with water, basified and extracted with an organic water-immiscible solvent to provide, after removal of solvents under reduced pressure, the desired alkoxy omega-substituted iminodicarbonimidic diamide (la) as a free base. Alternatively, the<br>
resulting alkanolic solution can be evaporated under reduced pressure to give the desired alkoxy omega-substituted iminodicarbonimidic diamide (la) as its hydrochloride salt or salt hydrate (la), which can be purified by column chromatography or by crystallization. Where reagent (III) is a mono omega-substituted dicyandiamide carrying no substitution on the remaining imino nitrogen, then R8 in compound III is hydrogen and, in the thus obtained product of formula I, R7 and R8 will be hydrogen.<br>
[0114] Where it is desired either to place the same substituent at R7 and R8 or where R8 is other than hydrogen, and a substituent is desired at R7, the hydrochloride hydrate of la is suspended in a suitable water-immiscible, reaction-inert organic solvent, suitably ethyl acetate, shaken with an excess of aqueous alkali, suitably aqueous sodium hydroxide, the organic layer is separated, dried, and heated under reflux for from about 1 hours to about 4 hours with an excess of a suitable acylating agent, for example, acetyl chloride. After completion of the reaction, the volatile components are removed under reduced pressure to yield the desired acylated compound.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
 [0115] Where R8 is alkyl, a different synthetic route is desirable, as illustrated above. For example, see Curd, F. H. S., et al. J. Chem. Soc. 1630-45 (1948) and Davidson, J. S., Chemistry and Industry, 1977-8 (1965).<br>
[0116] The R3 isothiocyanate (VIII) is added to a suspension of sodium cyanamide in alkanol, such as ethanol, which precipitates the sodium salt of 3-cyano-l-R3-isothiourea (IX). After filtering off the sodium salt and washing it with alkanol, methyl iodide is added to the filtrate with rapid stirring at ambient temperature. The product separates. The suspension is cooled in an ice bath, the solids filtered off, washed with water, and dried to give 3-cyano-S-methyl-l-R3-isothiourea (X).<br>
[0117] The isothiourea (X) is added to an alkanolic solution of R8 alkylamine and the mixture is heated for 4 hours in a pressure bottle at about 50°C. The resulting clear solution is gradually diluted with water (75 ml) and product crystallizes out to give the N'-cyano-N3-CHR3aR3b-N2-R8-guanidine (HI). This can then be reacted with the hydroxylamine hydrochloride salt (II) as described previously to obtain the desired compound (la).<br>
 (Figure Remove)<br>
 [0118] Alternatively, the appropriate omega-substituted dicyandiamide (III), for example, a lower alkyl dicyandiamide, may be reacted with an alkyl halide in the presence of base to provide the corresponding alkylated omega-substituted dicyandiamide (III). This may then be reacted as described, supra, to yield a compound of formula I.<br>
[0119] This reaction can be carried out in the absence or presence of solvent, as one skilled in the art would recognize. Preferably this is carried out in the presence of an aprotic solvent. Non-limiting examples of aprotic solvents include hydrocarbon solvents, and halogenated derivatives thereof, such as cyclohexane, pentane, toluene, benzene, cycloheptane,<br>
"^fnethylcyclohexane, ethylbenzene, m-, o-, or p-xylene, octane, indane, nonane, dichloromethane, chloroform, and the like. Aprotic solvent further include ethers such as diethyl ether, dimethoxymethane, tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1,3-dioxane, 1,4-dioxane, furan, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol diethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol diethyl ether, trieithylene glycol diisopropyl ether, anisole, or t-butylmethyl ether. Other aprotic solvents include, for example, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAC), l,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(lH)-pyrimidinone (DMPU), l,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI), N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP), formamide, N-methylacetamide, N-methylformamide, acetonitrile (MeCN), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), propionitrile, ethyl formate, methyl acetate, hexachloroacetone, acetone, ethyl methyl ketone, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, t-butyl acetate, sulfolane, N,N-dimethylpropionamide, nitromethane, nitrobenzene, and hexamethylphosphoramide.<br>
[0120] The compounds of the present invention may be made in the form of the monohydrohalic acid addition salts and/or the solvated compound, for example the hydrochloride hydrate or the hydrobromide. Other salts may be made however by simple reaction of a base with acid and may be desirable in order to modify the properties of the product, such as its toxicity, taste, physical form, or rate of release into the body. For example, the compounds may be made in the form of the sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, nitrate, acetate, maleate, phthalate, succinate, phosphate, nitrobenzoate, stearate, mandelate, N-acetyl-glycinate, pamoate, sulfonate, di-sulfonate, cyclohexyl sulfamate, citrate, tartrate, propionate, glycolate, lactate, malate, ascorbate, hydroxymaleate, phenylacetate, glutamate, benzoate, salicylate, sulfanilate, 2-acetoxybenzoate, fumarate, toluenesulfonate, methanesulfonate, ethane disulfonate, isethionate, mesylate or gluconate, and the like.<br>
[0121] Stable salts are normally formed with a ratio of one molecule of N',N5-disubstituted imidodicarbonimidic diamides to one or two molecules of monoprotic acid (or more than one molecule of compound la in the case of polyprotic acids) but the possibility of having basic groups as substituents in R1, for example, means that further quantities of acid may be combined with the disubstituted imidodicarbonimidic diamide in some cases. In addition the above molecules may contain various hydrated forms with molecules of water or other solvent included in the molecular formula of the stable entity.<br>
**«»|(0122]        The presence of the imino biguanide nitrogens on the molecule creates the possibility of forming acyl derivatives by reaction with appropriate substrates.<br>
[0123] The dihydrotriazine compounds of formula XIII may be prepared enzymatically by the oxidative cyclization of the N',N5-substituted asymmetrical imidodicarbonimidic diamides of the invention. The cyclization may occur naturally in vivo via metabolic processes. The cyclization may also be carried out in vitro with the appropriate microbes or enzymes.<br>
[0124] Alternatively, the dihydrotriazine compounds of formula XIII may be prepared synthetically by reacting alkoxyamine (II), as its hydrochloride salt, with sodium dicyandiamide (XI) in an alkanol . or other appropriate solvent. The product alkoxydicyandiamide (XII) is treated with a mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid, in an alkanol, such as methanol, and ketone, such as acetone, or a cyclopropanone equivalent, such as 1-trimethylsilyloxy-l-ethoxy cyclopropane. The reaction may be conducted at 10°C-50°C, preferably ambient temperature, and for 0.5 hours-10 hours, preferably one hour. The product (XIII where R7 and R8 = H) may be isolated by trituration with a solvent, such as acetone, or by column chromatography.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
 [0125] While the biguanide derivatives of formula I have inherent biological activity, these compounds, in part, owe their in vivo pharmacological activity to the metabolic conversion of the biguanide to its corresponding dihydrotriazine metabolite (XIII). Dihydrotriazines have been shown to be potent inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and, as such, are effective as therapeutic agents, including but not limited to antimicrobial agents.<br>
[0126] In certain preferred embodiments, the dihydrotriazines of the invention (compounds of formula XIII) may be employed in an in vitro method to evaluate and predict the biological activities of their predecessor biguanides (i.e., the biguanides of formula I are prodrugs of the dihydrotriazine of formula XHI). These prodrugs do not exhibit the full extent of their biological activity until they are converted to their dihydrotriazine counterparts in vivo, and thus may not be readily evaluated in vitro. However, the biguanide derivatives of formula I may be evaluated in vitro by assaying for the activity of their corresponding dihydrotriazines.<br>

[0128] There is disclosed an improved mode of prophylaxis and treatment of infections by one or more of plasmodia; mycobacteria; toxoplasmosis; and pneumocystis organisms; and agents causing nocardia infections. The biguanide derivatives of formula I, and the corresponding dihydrotriazines of formula XIII, of the present invention, their salts and derivatives thereof have antimalarial and antibacterial activity, as well as effectiveness against some fungi, protozoans, parasites and viruses. Additionally, the biguanide derivatives of formula I or XIII exhibit similar activities. In particular, these disubstituted asymmetrical biguanides, the corresponding dihydrotriazines, and salts, as well as their substituted derivatives, exhibit antiparasitic activity including activity against the plasmodia of malaria (P. berghei), exhibit antimicrobial activity against mycobacteria including, but not limited to, M. avium inter cellulare, M. avium complex, M. tuberculosis, M. leprae and Toxoplasma gondii, and pneumocystis organisms such as P. carinii associated with, but not limited to, immuno-compromised patients. In addition, these compounds have activity against nocardia infections.<br>
[0.129] In yet other embodiments, the invention is directed to methods for reducing in a patient the level of infection caused by an organism selected from the group consisting of Plasmodium sp., Mycobacterium sp., Toxoplasma gondii, and Pneumocystis carinii, comprising the step of:<br>
administering to said patient in need thereof an effective amount of at least one compound of formula I or formula XIEI.<br>
[0130] In yet further embodiments, the invention is directed to methods for protecting a patient susceptible to infection caused by exposure to an organism selected from the group consisting of Plasmodium sp., Mycobacterium sp., Toxoplasma gondii, and Pneumocystis carinii, comprising the step of:<br>
administering to said patient in need thereof an effective amount of at least one compound of formula I or formula XIII.<br>
[0131] The preferred dosage range is between 0.5 and 10 mg/kg/day. The range is quite large because the physician must use his/her judgment on whether the dosage is prophylactic and if given to an infected subject, on what the level of infection is. When given as tablets the tablets may contain 25-500 mg of active material.<br>
EXAMPLE OF BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF THE INVENTION [0132]   Biological Activity Against Plasmodium berghei (KGB Strain) Mouse Malaria Model:<br>
Selective compounds of this invention were tested for antimalarial activity in the established modification of the Thomson model. Jensen, et al, J. Med. Chem., 2001, 44, 3925-3931 as follows: CD-I mice (male and/or female), 4 to 5 weeks old, are purchased from Charles River. Seven (7) mice are typically used in each experimental group. The mice are housed 3 to 4 per cage and are maintained at a temperature of 75°C with a 12-hour day light cycle. The mice are fed a standard Ralston Purina® mouse chow and given water ad. lib. Their cages and water bottles were changed twice a week.<br>
[0133] Preparation of the test compounds oral administration involved grinding the material with a mortar and pestle before diluting in 0.5% hydroxyethylcellulose-Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan mono-oleate) for oral administration. For subcutaneous administration, the test compounds were suspended in peanut oil.<br>
^0134] The mice were infected intraperitoneally with 50,000 red blood cells infected with a drug-sensitive strain of Plasmodium berghei (KBG strain) on day 0. The inoculum was obtained from a donor mouse having a parasitemia between 5% and 10%.<br>
[0135] The compounds were administered according to the weight of the mice. The mice were weighed each day before the drugs were administered. Test compounds are given in a volume of 10 ml/kg of body weight. Compounds were administered either orally or subcutaneously twice a day (6 hours apart) for 3 days starting on the 3rd day post infection. Blood films were taken on day 6 post-infection and twice weekly for 30 days. The level of parasites (parasitemia) was determined from the Giemsa stained blood films.<br>
[0136] Antimalarial activity was quantified by a percent survival calculated for each treated group on Day 31. The infected non-treated control mice usually die between days 7 and 10. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
Antituberculosis activities were assessed in vitro using the biologically active dihydrotriazine metabolites of the imidodicarbonimidic diamides. The assay methodology is detailed as follows:<br>
[0138] To tissue culture treated 96-well microtiter plates were added 20 |Jl of a solution of test compound. The plates were allowed to dry in an incubator at a temperature between 50° to 60°C for 20 to 30 minutes. Then the plates were subjected to UV light for 15 minutes to kill bacteria. The plates were generally used within 2-3 days of being made. To each well<br>
was added 100 pi of culture broth and the appropriate strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Mycobacterium avium. The plates were then incubated at 37°C for between 18 days to 21 days. Growth was assessed by turbidity measurement and MICs reported in jjg/ml.<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
 [0139] The invention is further described in the following examples. All the examples are actual examples. These examples are for illustrative purposes only, and are not to be construed as limiting the appended claims.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0140] The following experimental details apply to examples below. All chemicals were reagent grade and used without further purification. Melting points were determined on a Laboratory Devices Mel-Temp II heating block type melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. TLC was performed on Baker Si250F254 silica gel plates using UV/fluorescence visualization. Visualization was, where noted, also aided by the use of a diazonium salt spray prepared by dissolving 4-nitroaniline (1.0 g) in 2N HCI (200 mL). An aliquot of this solution<br>
^Jf/as then titrated to colorlessness with 2N sodium nitrite just prior to use as a spray. After the spraying with the diazonium spray, the plate was sprayed with a 5% sodium carbonate solution to develop the TLC spots. A TLC eluent found to be useful for the biguanides and triazines was a 12:6:3:2 mixture of CHCla/acetone/n-butanol/formic acid. Aldrich Chemical Co. 200-400 or 70-230 mesh 60A silica gel was used for column chromatography. Elemental analyses were done by Robertson Microlit of Madison, NJ.<br>
