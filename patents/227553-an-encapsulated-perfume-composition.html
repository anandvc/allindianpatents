				<td>PERFUME OOMPOQITIONO<br>
Technical field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to/perfume compositions for delivery of high impact accord (HIA) perfume ingredients. In particular, the present invention relates to said encapsulated perfume composition and their use in laundry and cleaning products.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Most consumers have come to expect scented detergent products and to expect that fabrics and other items which have been laundered with these products also have a pleasing fragrance. Further, perfumes by their ability to provide an olfactory aesthetic benefit can serve as a signal of cleanliness.<br>
Therefore, it is desirable and commercially beneficial to add perfume materials to such products. Perfume additives make laundry compositions more aesthetically pleasing to the consumer, and in some cases the perfume imparts a pleasant fragrance to fabrics treated therewith. However, the amount of perfume carry-over from an aqueous laundry bath onto fabrics is often marginal. Industry, therefore, has long searched for an effective perfume delivery system for use in detergent products which provides long-lasting, storage-stable fragrance to the product, as well as fragrance which masks wet solution odor during use and provides fragrance to the laundered items.<br>
Detergent compositions which contain perfume mixed with or sprayed onto the compositions are well known from commercial practice. Because perfumes are made of a combination of volatile compounds, perfume can be continuously emitted from simple solutions and dry mixes to which the perfume has been added. Various techniques have been developed to hinder or delay<br><br>
the release of perfume from compositions so that they will remain aesthetically pleasing for a longer length of time. To date, however, few of the methods deliver significant fabric and wet solution odor benefits after prolonged storage of the product.<br>
Moreover, there has been a continuing search for methods and compositions which will effectively and efficiently deliver perfume into an aqueous laundry bath providing a relatively strong scent in the headspace just above the solution, then from the laundry bath onto fabric surfaces. Various methods of perfume delivery have been developed involving protection of the perfume through the wash cycle, with subsequent release of the perfume onto fabrics.<br>
One method for delivery of perfume in the wash cycle involves combining the perfume with an emulsifier and water-soluble polymer, forming the mixture into particles, and adding them to a laundry composition, as is described in U.S. Pat. 4,209,417, Whyte, issued June 24, 1980; U.S. Pat. 4,339,356. Whyte, issued July 13, 1982; and U.S. Pat. No. 3,576,760, Gould et al, issued April 27, 1971.<br>
However, even with the substantial work done by industry in this area, a need still exists for a simple, more efficient and effective perfume delivery system which can be mixed with laundry compositions to provide initial and lasting perfume benefits to fabrics which have been treated with the laundry product.<br>
Another problem in providing perfumed products is the odor intensity associated with the products, especially high density granular detergent compositions. As the density and concentration of the detergent composition increase, the odor from the perfume components can become undesirably intense. A need therefore exists for a perfume delivery system which substantially releases the perfume odor during use and thereafter from the dry fabric, but which does not provide an overly- intensive odor to the product itself.<br>
Still another problem in providing perfumes for products is the odor intensity on fabrics. Indeed, nowadays with the trends for consumer to have mixed laundering such as synthetic and cotton, it is desirable to provide increased<br><br>
odour on both synthetic and cotton fabrics. It has now been found that odor intensity although good on wet fabric is somewhat lessened on dry fabrics, in particular dry cotton fabrics. Accordingly, a need exists for a perfume delivery system which substantially releases the perfume odor during use and thereafter from the dry fabric whatever the type of fabrics treated therewith.<br>
By the present invention, it has now been discovered that perfume inojBdiexits, can be selected based on specific selection criteria to rriaxiiTH2e4mpxict during and/or after the wash process, while minimizing the amount of ingredients needed in total to achieve a consumer noticeable benefit. Such compositions are desirable not only for their consumer noticeable benefits (e.g., odor aesthetics), but also for their potentially reduced cost through efficient use of lesser amounts of ingredients.<br>
r<br>
The present invention solves the long-standing need for a simple, effective, storage-stable delivery system which provides surprising odor benefits (especially odor benefits on fabrics) after the  laundering process. Further, encapsulated perfume-containing compositions have reduced product odor ^during storage of the composition.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention is a perfume composition comprising:<br>
a)-at least 10% by weight of at least one High Impact Accord ("HIA") perfume ingredient of Class 1, the Class 1 perfume ingredient having (1) a boiling point at 760 mm Hg, of 275°C or lower, (2) a calculated CLogP of at least 2.0, and (3) an odor detection threshold ("ODT") less than or equal to 50 ppb; and<br>

In a preferred embodiment, the perfume composition is present in an encapsulated form<br>
In another aspect of the invention, there is provided a laundry and cleaning composition comprising the perfume composition of the invention.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According  to  the  present  invention  there   is  provided  an  encapsulated  perfume composition comprising:<br>
a)	at least 10% by weight of at least one High Impact Accordf'HIA") perfume<br>
ingredient of Class 1 such as hereinbefore described, the Class 1 perfume ingredient<br>
having (1) a boiling point at 760 mm Hg, of 275°C or lower, (2) a calculated CLogP of at<br>
least 2.0, and (3) an odor detection threshold ("ODT") less than or equal to 50 ppb; and<br>
b)	at least 30% by weight of at least one High Impact Accord("HIA") perfume<br>
ingredient of class 2 such as hereinbefore described, the Class 2 perfume ingredient<br>
having (1) a boiling point at 760 mm Hg, of greater than 275°C, (2) a calculated CLogP<br>
of at least 4.0, and (3) an odor detection threshold ("ODT") less than or equal to 50 ppb.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Perfume composition<br>
A perfume composition as defined hereinafter is an essential component of the invention. The perfume composition according to the ..invention comprises at least two class of perfume ingredients: a first High Impact Accord ("HIA") perfume ingredients, the first perfume ingredient having (1) a boiling point at 760 mm Hg, of 275°C or lower, (2) a calculated CLogP of at least 2.0, and (3) an odor detection threshold ("ODT") less than or equal to 50 ppb, and a second High Impact Accord ("HIA") perfume ingredients, the second perfume ingredient having (1) a boiling point at 760 mm Hg, of greater than 275°C, (2) a calculated CLogP of at least 4.0, and (3) an odor detection threshold ("ODT") less than or equal to 50 ppb.<br>
The HIA perfume ingredients are characterized by their respective boiling point (B.P.), octanol/water partition coefficient (P) and odor detection threshold ("ODT1).<br>
The octanol/water partition coefficient of a perfume ingredient is the ratio between its equilibrium concentrations in octanol and in water.<br>
The boiling points of many perfume ingredients, at standard 760 mm Hg are given in, e.g., "Perfume and Flavor Chemicals (Aroma Chemicals)," Steffen Arctander, published by the author, 1969, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The logP values of many perfume ingredients have been reported; for example, the Pomona92 database, available from Daylight Chemical Information Systems, Inc. (Daylight CIS), Irvine, California, contains many, along with citations to the original literature. However, the logP values are most conveniently calculated by the "CLOGP" program, also available from Daylight CIS. This program also lists experimental logP values when they are available in the Pomona92 database. The "calculated logP" (ClogP) is determined by the fragment approach of Hansch and Leo ( cf., A. Leo, in Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 4, C. Hansch, P. G. Sammens, J. B. Taylor and C. A. Ramsden, Eds., p. 295, Pergamon Press, 1990, incorporated herein by reference). The fragment approach is based on the chemical structure of each perfume ingredient, and takes into account the numbers and types of atoms, the atom connectivity, and chemical bonding. The ClogP values, which are the most reliable and widely used estimates for this physicochemical property, are preferably used instead of the experimental logP values in the selection of perfume ingredients which are useful in the present invention.<br>
Odor detection thresholds are determined using a gas chromatograph. The gas chromatograph is calibrated to determine the exact volume of material injected by the syringe, the precise split ratio, and the hydrocarbon response using a hydrocarbon standard of known concentration and chain-length distribution. The air flow rate is accurately measured and, assuming the duration of a human inhalation to last 12 seconds, the sampled volume is calculated. Since the precise concentration at the detector at any point in time is known, the mass per volume inhaled is known and hence the concentration of material. To determine whether a material has a threshold below 50 ppb, solutions are delivered to the sniff port at the back-calculated concentration. A panelist sniffs the GC effluent and identifies the retention time when odor is noticed. The average across all panelists determines the threshold of noticeability.<br>
The necessary amount of analyte is injected onto the column to achieve a 50 ppb concentration at the detector. Typical gas chromatograph parameters for determining odor detection thresholds are listed below.<br>

A- High Impact Accord ("HIA") perfume ingredients of Class 1 For this first class of perfume ingredients, each Class 1 HIA perfume ingredient of this invention has a B.P., determined at the normal, standard pressure of about 760 mm Hg, of 275°C or lower, an octanol/water partition coefficient P of about 2,000 or higher, and an ODT of less than or-equal to SOparts per billion (ppb). Since the partition coefficients of the preferred perfume ingredients of this invention have high values, they are more conveniently given in the form of their logarithm to the base 10, logP. Thus the preferred perfume ingredients of this invention have ClogP of about 2 and higher.<br>
Table 1 gives some non-limiting examples of HIA perfume ingredients of Class 1.(Table Removed)<br>
Of course, the perfume composition of the invention may comprises one or more HIA perfume ingredient of Class 1.<br>
The first class of HIA perfume ingredient is very effusive and very noticeable when the product is in use as well as on fabric items that come in contact with the wash solution, in particular on synthetic fabrics. Of the perfume ingredients in a given perfume composition, at least 10%, preferably at least 20% and most preferably at least 30% are HIA perfume ingredients of Class 1.<br>
Ethyl-2-Methyl Butyrate9-<br>
B- High Impact Accord ("HIA") perfume ingredients of Class 2 For this second class of perfume ingredients, each Class 2 HIA perfume ingredient of this invention has a B.P., determined at the normal, standard pressure of about 760 mm Hg, of greater than 275°C, an octanol/water partition coefficient P of at least 4,000, and an ODT of less than or equal to 50 parts per billion (ppb). Since the partition coefficients of the preferred perfume ingredients of this invention have high values, they are more conveniently given in the form of their logarithm to the base 10, logP. Thus the preferred perfume ingredients of this invention have ClogP of at least 4.<br>
Table 2 gives some non-limiting examples of HIA perfume ingredients of Class 2.<br>
Table 2. HIA Perfume Ingredients of Class 2<br>
HIA Ingredient of Class 2<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Of course, the perfume composition of the invention may comprises one or more HIA perfume ingredient of Class 2.<br>
The second class of HIA perfume ingredient is very effusive and very noticeable when the product is in use as well as on dried fabric items that have been in contact with the wash solution, in particular on cotton fabrics. Of the perfume ingredients in a given perfume composition, at least 30%, preferably at least 40% and most preferably at least 50% are HIA perfume ingredients of Class 2.<br>
The perfume composition may also comprises some optional conventional to perfume composition materials such as other perfume ingredients not falling within either Class 1 or Class 2, or odourless solvents or oxidation inhibitors , or mixture thereof.<br>
The laundry and cleaning compositions herein comprise from about 0.01% to 50% of the above described HIA perfume composition according to the invention. More preferably, the laundry and cleaning compositions herein comprise from about 0.05% to 8.0% by weight of the HIA perfume composition, even more preferably from about 0.05% to 3.0%, and most preferably from about 0.05% to 1.0% of the HIA perfume composition.<br>
Encapsulating Material<br>
In a preferred  embodiment of the  invention,  the perfume composition  is<br>
encapsulated.<br>
A wide variety of capsules exist which will allow for delivery of perfume effect at various times in the cleaning or conditioning process.<br>
Examples of such capsules with different encapsulated materials are capsules provided by microencapsulation. One method comprises a capsule core which is coated completely with a material which may be polymeric. U.S. Patent 4,145,184, Brain et al, issued March 20, 1979, and U.S. Patent 4,234,627, Schilling, issued November 18, 1980, teach using a tough coating material which essentialy prohibits the diffusions out of the perfume. The perfume is delivered to fabric via the microcapsules and is then released by rupture of the micropcapsules such as would occur with manipulation of the fabric.<br>
Another method involves providing protection of perfume through the wash cycle and release of perfume in the heat-elevated conditions of the dryer. U.S. Patent 4,096,072, Brock et al, issued June 20, 1978, teaches a method for delivering fabric conditioning agents to textiles through the wash and dry cycle via particles containing hydrogenated caster oil and a fatty quaternary ammonium salt. Perfume may be incorporated into these particles.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,152,272, Young, teaches incorporating perfume into wax particles to protect the perfume through storage in dry compositions and enhance the deposition of the particles on the fabrics during the rinse by the concommitant use of a cationic surfactant. The perfume then diffuses through the wax matrix of the particles on the fabric in the heat-elevated conditions of the dryer.<br>
In general, the encapsulating materials of the perfumed particles can be a water-insoluble or water-soluble encapsulating material, preferably is a water-soluble encapsulating material.<br>
Nonlimiting examples of useful water-insoluble materials include polyethylenes, polyamides, polystyrenes, polyisoprenes, polycarbonates, polyesters, polyacrylates, vinyl polymers and polyurethanes and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable water soluble encapsulating materials are capsules which consist of a matrix of polysaccharide and polyhydroxy compounds such as described in GB 1,464,616. Still other suitable water soluble or water dispersible encapsulating materials comprise dextrins derived from ungelatinized starch acid-esters of substituted dicarboxylic acids such as described in US 3,455,838. These acid-ester dextrins are preferably prepared from such starches as waxy maize, waxy sorghum, sage, tapioca and potato.<br>
When starch is employed, the starches suitable for encapsulating the perfume oils of the present invention can be made from, raw starch, pregelatinized starch, modified starch derived from tubers, legumes, cereal and grains, for example corn starch, wheat starch, rice starch, waxy corn starch, oat starch, cassava starch, waxy barley, waxy rice starch, sweet rice starch, amioca, potato starch, tapioca starch, oat starch, cassava starch, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Modified starches suitable for use as the encapsulating matrix in the present invention include, hydrolyzed starch, acid thinned starch, starch esters of long chain hydrocarbons, starch acetates, starch octenyl succinate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The term "hydrolyzed starch" refers to oligosaccharide-type materials that are typically obtained by acid and/or enzymatic hydrolysis of starches, preferably corn starch.  Suitable hydrolyzed starches for inclusion in the present invention include maltodextrins and corn syrup solids.    The hydrolyzed starches for inclusion with the mixture of starch esters have a Dextrose Equivalent (DE) values of from about 10 to about 36 DE.   The DE value is a measure of the reducing equivalence of the hydrolyzed starch referenced to dextrose and expressed as a percent (on a dry basis).   The higher the DE value, the more reducing sugars present. A method for determining DE values can be found in Standard Analytical Methods of the Member Companies of Corn Industries Research Foundation, 6th ed. Corn Refineries Association, Inc. Washington, DC 1980, D-52.<br>
Starch esters having a degree of substitution in the range of from about 0.01% to about 10.0% may be used to encapsulate the perfume oils of the present invention. The hydrocarbon part of the modifying ester should be from a C5 to C16 carbon chain. Preferably, octenylsuccinate (OSAN) substituted waxy corn starches of various types such as 1) waxy starch: acid thinned and OSAN substituted, 2) blend of corn syrup solids: waxy starch, OSAN substituted, and dextrinized, 3) waxy starch: OSAN substituted and dextrinized, 4) blend of corn syrup solids or maltodextrins with waxy starch: acid thinned OSAN substituted, and then cooked and spray dried, 5) waxy starch: acid thinned and OSAN substituted then cooked and spray dried, and 6) the high and low viscosities of<br>
the above modifications (based on the level of acid treatment) can also be used in the present invention.<br>
Modified starches having emulsifying and emulsion stabilizing capacity such as starch octenyl succinates have the ability to entrap the perfume oil droplets in the emulsion due to the hydrophobic character of the starch modifying agent. The perfume oils remain trapped in the modified starch until dissolved in the wash solution, due to thermodynamic factors i.e., hydrophobic interactions and stabilization of the emulsion because of steric hindrance.<br>
More preferably, the perfume composition of the invention is encapsulated with a water soluble, modified starch to form the modified starch encapsulate. Preferably, the encapsulating material is water-soluble modified starch solid matrix, preferably a starch raw material that has been modified by treating said starch raw material with octenyl-succinic acid anhydride. More preferably the said modified starch is mixed with a polyhydroxy compound before treatment with octenyl-succinic acid anhydride.<br>
Most preferably, for the purpose of the invention the modified starch is a waxy, maize starch, pregelatinised, dextrinised is mixed with sorbitol or any other alcohol type and then treated with octenyl succinic anhydride.<br>
Suitable examples of said encapsulating materials are N-Lok®, manufactured by National Starch, Narlex ® (ST and ST2), and Capsul E ®. These encapsulating materials comprise pregelatinised waxy maize starch and optionally, glucose. The starch is modified by adding monofunctional substituted groups such as octenyl succinic acid anhydride.<br>
Manufacture of Modified Starch Encapsulated Perfume composition<br>
The following is a non-limiting example of a suitable process for manufacture of a modified starch encapsulated perfume composition for use in laundry and cleaning compositions according to the present invention.<br>
1.	225 g of CAPSUL modified starch (National Starch &amp; Chemical) is added to<br>
450 g of water at 24°C.<br>
2.	The mixture is agitated at 600 RPM (turbine impeller 2 inches in diameter) for<br>
20 minutes.<br>
3.	75 g perfume composition is added near the vortex of the starch solution.<br>
4.	The emulsion formed is agitated for an additional 20 minutes (at 600 RPM).<br>
5.	Upon achieving a perfume droplet size of less than 15 microns, the emulsion<br>
is pumped to a spray drying tower and atomized through a spinning disk with<br>
co-current airflow for drying.   The inlet air temperature is set at 205-210°C,<br>
the exit air temperature is stabilized at 98-103°C.<br>
6.	Dried particles of the starch encapsulated perfume composition are collected<br>
at the dryer outlet.<br>
Analysis of the finished HIA perfume particle (all % based on weight):<br>
Total Perfume Oil	24.56%<br>
Encapsulated Oil	24.46%<br>
Free/Surface Oil	0.10%<br>
Starch	72.57%<br>
Moisture	2.87%<br>
Particle Size Distribution<br>
50-500 micrometers	83%<br>
&gt; 500 micrometers	1%<br>
Still another preferred manufacture of modified starch encapsulated perfume composition is described in GB 1,464,616, which comprises a mixture of polysaccharide material which is a modified starch and a polyhydroxy compound present in an amount of at least 20% of the mixture by weight and selected from alcohols such as sorbitol, plant-type sugars, lactones, monoethers and acetals. The process comprises forming a solution of the modified starch and the polyhydroxycompound, in proportions such that their mixture softens at the<br>
temperature of spray-drying, in water, emulsifying the oil in solution and spray drying said emulsion to remove water therefrom.<br>
Still another process of encapsulation suitable for use herein is described in EP-A-0,550,067, and WO 94/19448.<br>
Other known methods of manufacturing the starch encapsulates of the present invention, include but are not limited to, fluid bed agglomeration, extrusion, cooling/crystallization methods and the use of phase transfer catalysts to promote interfacial polymerization. The encapsulated perfume particles can be made by mixing the perfume with the encapsulating matrix, spray-drying emulsions containing the encapsulating material and the perfume. In addition, the particle size of the product from the spray-drying tower can be modified. These modifications can comprise specific processing steps such as post-tower agglomeration steps (e.g. fluidised bed) for enlarging the particle size and/or processing steps wherein the surface properties of the encapsulates are modified, e.g. dusting with hydrophobic silica in order to reduce the hygroscopicity of the encapsulates.<br>
When a laundry and cleaning composition containing the encapsulated perfume composition described herein is added to water the modified starch of the perfume composition begins to dissolve in the water. Not wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that the dissolving modified starch swells and an emulsion of perfume droplets, modified starch and water is formed, the modified starch being the emulsifier and emulsion stabilizer. After the emulsion is formed, the perfume composition begins to coalesce into larger droplets of perfume, which can migrate to either the surface of the solution or to the surface of fabrics in the wash solution due to the relative density difference between the perfume droplets (mostly low density hydrophobic oils) and the wash water. When the droplets reach either interface, they spread out quickly along the surface or<br>
rnier-face. The spreading of the perfume droplet at the wash surface increases the surface area from which the perfume composition can volatilize, thereby releasing larger amounts of the perfume into the headspace above the wash solution. This provides a surprisingly strong and consumer noticeable scent in the headspace above the wash solution. Furthermore, the interaction of the perfume droplets with wet fabrics in solution provides a surprisingly strong and consumer noticeable scent on wet and dry fabrics.<br>
Encapsulation of the perfume composition with a modified starch as described above allows for loading of larger amounts of perfume composition than if they were encapsulated in a  native starch granule.     Encapsulation of perfume composition using cylodextrin is limited by the particle size of the guest molecule (perfume) and the cavity of the host (cyclodextrin).   It is difficult to load more than about 20% perfume into a cyclodextrin particle.   However, encapsulation with a starch that has been modified to have emulsion properties does not impose this limitation.  Since the encapsulation in the present invention  is achieved by entrapping perfume oil droplets of less than 15 microns, preferably less than 5 microns and most preferably less than 2.5 microns in size, within the modified starch matrix, while the matrix is being formed by removal of water from the emulsion, more perfume can be loaded based on the type, method and level of modification of the starch.  In contrast, traditional cyclodextrin molecules trap the perfume composition completely inside their cavity thereby limiting the size and amount of the perfume oil encapsulated. Loads much greater than 20% are possible when encapsulating with the modified starches described  by this invention.<br>
Encapsulation of the volatile perfume composition also minimizes depletion during storage and when the product container is opened. Further, HIA perfumes are generally only released when laundry and cleaning products containing the encapsulated particle are dissolved in the wash solution. Furthermore, the water soluble encapsulating matrix protects the perfume composition from chemical degradation caused in the neat product as well as in the wash solution, by the different surfactant systems or bleaches which are commonly present in the particulate detergent compositions of this invention.<br><br>
Other suitable matrix materials and process details are disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 3,971,852, Brenner et at., issued July 27, 1976, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Water soluble perfume microcapsules containing conventional, non-HIA perfume oils may optionally be added. This will provide for a further aesthetically pleasing fragrance. These can be obtained commercially, e.g., as IN-CAP® from Polak's Frutal Works, Inc., Middletown, New York; and as Optilok System® encapsulated perfumes from Encapsulated Technology, Inc., Nyack, New York.<br>
When the HIA perfume composition is present in encapsulated form, the laundry and cleaning compositions herein preferably comprise from about 0.05% to 8.0% by weight of the encapsulated HIA perfume particle, even more preferably from about 0.05% to 3.0%, and most preferably from about 0.05% to 1.0% of the encapsulated HIA perfume particle. The encapsulated perfume particles preferably have size of from about 1 micron to about 1000 microns, more preferably from about 50 microns to about 500 microns.<br>
Of course, mixtures of perfume composition and encapsulated HIA perfume composition can be employed in the laundry and cleaning composition of the invention. This will allow a desirable immediate release of fragrance upon opening of the package containing the HIA perfume composition and as the product is added to water as well as a long lasting fragrance release on the dry fabric as provided by the encapsulated HIA perfume composition.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, the perfume composition and/or encapsulated perfume particles are used in laundry and cleaning compositions.<br>
Laundry and cleaning compositions<br>
The present invention include both laundry and cleaning compositions which are typically used for laundering fabrics and cleaning hard surfaces such as dishware, floors, bathrooms, toilet, kitchen, animal litter and other surfaces in need of a release of perfume scent in both wet and dry conditions. Accordingly, by laundry and cleaning compositions, these are to be understood to include not only detergent compositions which provide fabric cleaning benefits, but also<br>
compositions such as hard surface cleaning which provide hard surface cleaning benefit.<br>
Of course, the present invention may also be used where a need for a release on dry surface is needed such in personal care product like shampoo or shower gel.<br>
Typically the laundry and cleaning composition comprises a detersive ingredient such as detersive surfactants and detersive builders and further optional ingredients as described hereinafter as optional ingredients.<br>
Detersive ingredients<br>
Non-limiting examples of surfactants useful herein typically at levels from 1% to 55%, by weight, include the conventional C11-C18 alkyl benzene sulfonates ("LAS") and primary, branched-chain and random C10-C20 alkyl sulfates ("AS"), the C10-C18 secondary (2,3) alkyl sulfates of the formula<br>
CH3(CH2)X(CHOSO3M+) CH3 and CH3(CH2)y(CHOSO3'-M+) CH2CH3 where x and (y + 1) are integers of at least 7, preferably at least 9, and M is a water-solubilizing cation, especially sodium, unsaturated sulfates such as oleyl sulfate, the C10-C18 alkyl alkoxy sulfates ("AEXS"; especially x up to 7 EO ethoxy sulfates), C10-C18 alkyl alkoxy carboxylates (especially the EO 1-5 ethoxycarboxylates), the C10-18 glycerol ethers, the C10-C18 alkyl polyglycosides and their corresponding sulfated polyglycosides, and C12-C18<br>
alpha-sulfonated fatty acid esters. If desired, the conventional nonionic and amphoteric surfactants such as the C12-C18 alkyl ethoxylates ("AE") including the so-called narrow peaked alkyl ethoxylates and C6-C12 alkyl phenol alkoxylates (especially ethoxylates and mixed ethoxy/propoxy), C12-C18 betaines and sulfobetaines ("sultaines"), C10-C18 amine oxides, cationic<br>
surfactants and the like, can also be included in the overall compositions. The C10-C18 N-alkyl polyhydroxy fatty acid amides can also be used. Typical examples include the C12-C18 N-methylglucamides. See WO 92/06154. Other<br>
sugar-derived surfactants include the N-alkoxy polyhydroxy fatty acid amides, such as C10-C18 N-(3-methoxypropyl) glucamide. The N-propyl through N-hexyl C12-C18 glucamides can be used for low sudsing. C10-C20 conventional soaps may also be used. If high sudsing is desired, the branched-chain C-jo-3-js soaps may be used. Mixtures of anionic and nonionic surfactants are<br>
especially useful.   Other conventional useful surfactants are listed in standard texts.<br>
Fully formulated laundry and cleaning compositions preferably contain, in addition to the hereinbefore described components, one or more of the following ingredients.<br>
Detersive Builders<br>
Detergent builders can optionally be included in the compositions herein to assist in controlling mineral hardness. Inorganic as well as organic builders can be used. Builders are typically used in fabric laundering compositions to assist in the removal of particulate soils.<br>
The level of builder can vary widely depending upon the end use of the composition and its desired physical form. When present, the compositions will typically comprise at least 1% builder, preferably from 1% to 80%. Liquid formulations typically comprise from 5% to 50%, more typically 5% to 30%, by weight, of detergent builder. Granular formulations typically comprise from 1% to 80%, more typically from 5% to 50% by weight, of the detergent builder. Lower or higher levels of builder, however, are not meant to be excluded.<br>
Inorganic or P-containing detergent builders include, but are not limited to, the alkali metal, ammonium and alkanolammonium salts of polyphosphates (exemplified by the tripolyphosphates, pyrophosphates, and glassy polymeric meta-phosphates), phosphonates, phytic acid, silicates, carbonates (including bicarbonates and sesquicarbonates), sulphates, and aluminosilicates. However, non-phosphate builders are required in some locales. Importantly, the compositions herein function surprisingly well even in the presence of the so-called "weak" builders (as compared with phosphates) such as citrate, or in the so-called "underbuilt" situation that may occur with zeolite or layered silicate builders.<br>
Examples of silicate builders are the alkali metal silicates, particularly those having a Si02:Na2O ratio in the range 1.0:1 to 3.2:1 and layered silicates, such<br>
as the layered sodium silicates described in U.S. 4,664,839.   NaSKS-6 is the trademark for a crystalline layered silicate marketed by. Hoechst (commonly<br>
abbreviated herein as "SKS-6").   Unlike zeolite builders, the Na SKS-6 silicate builder  does   not   contain   aluminum.      NaSKS-6   has   the   delta-Na2SiC&gt;5<br>
morphology form of layered silicate. It can be prepared by methods such as those described in DE-A-3,417,649 and DE-A-3,742,043. SKS-6 is a highly preferred layered silicate for use herein, but other such layered silicates, such as those having the general formula NaMSixO2x+ryH2O wherein M is sodium or hydrogen, x is a number from 1.9 to 4, preferably 2, and y is a number from 0 to 20, preferably 0 can be used herein. Various other layered silicates from Hoechst include NaSKS-5, NaSKS-7 and NaSKS-11, as the alpha, beta and gamma forms. As noted above, the delta-Na2SiO5 (NaSKS-6 form) is most<br>
preferred for use herein. Other silicates may also be useful such as for example magnesium silicate, which can serve as a crispening agent in granular formulations, as a stabilizing agent for oxygen bleaches, and as a component of suds control systems.<br>
Examples of carbonate builders are the alkaline earth and alkali metal carbonates as disclosed in DE 2,321,001.<br>
Aluminosilicate builders are useful in the present invention. Aluminosilicate builders are of great importance in most currently marketed heavy duty granular detergent compositions, and can also be a significant builder ingredient in liquid detergent formulations. Aluminosilicate builders include those having the empirical formula: Mz/n[(AI02)z(Si02)y]-xH20<br>
wherein z and y are integers usually of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to y is in the range from 1.0 to 0, and x is an integer from 0 to 264, and M is a Group IA or IIA element, e.g., Na, K, Mg, Ca with valence n.<br>
Useful aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are commercially available. These aluminosilicates can be crystalline or amorphous in structure and can be naturally-occurring aluminosilicates or synthetically derived. A method for producing aluminosilicate ion exchange materials is disclosed in U.S. 3,985,669. Preferred synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange materials useful herein are available under the designations Zeolite A, Zeolite P (B), Zeolite MAP and Zeolite X. In an especially preferred embodiment, the crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange material has the formula: Na12[(AI02)12(Si02)12]-xH20<br>
wherein x is from 20 to 30, especially 27. This material is known as Zeolite A. Dehydrated zeolites (x = 0 - 10) may also be used herein. Preferably, the aluminosilicate has a particle size of 0.1-10 microns in diameter.<br>
Organic detergent builders suitable for the purposes of the present invention include, but are not restricted to, a wide variety of polycarboxylate compounds. As used herein, "polycarboxylate" refers to compounds having a plurality of carboxylate groups, preferably at least 3 carboxylates. Polycarboxylate builder can generally be added to the composition in acid form, but can also be added in the form of a neutralized salt. When utilized in salt form, alkali metals, such as sodium, potassium, and lithium, or alkanolammonium salts are preferred.<br>
Included among the polycarboxylate builders are a variety of categories of useful materials. One important category of polycarboxylate builders encompasses the ether polycarboxylates, including oxydisuccinate, as disclosed in Berg, U.S. 3,128,287, U.S. 3,635,830. See also "TMS/TDS" builders of U.S. 4,663,071. Suitable ether polycarboxylates also include cyclic compounds, particularly alicyclic compounds, such as those described in U.S. 3,923,679; 3,835,163; 4,158,635; 4,120,874 and 4,102,903.<br>
Other useful detergency builders include the ether hydroxypolycarboxylates, copolymers of maleic anhydride with ethylene or vinyl methyl ether, 1, 3, 5-trihydroxy benzene-2, 4, 6-trisulphonic acid, and carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, the various alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of polyacetic acids such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid, as well as polycarboxylates such as mellitic acid, pyromellitic, succinic acid, oxydisuccinic acid, polymaleic acid, benzene 1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid, carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, and soluble salts thereof.<br>
Citrate builders, e.g., citric acid and soluble salts thereof (particularly sodium salt), are polycarboxylate builders of particular importance for heavy duty liquid detergent formulations due to their availability from renewable resources and their biodegradability. Citrates can also be used in granular compositions, especially in combination with zeolite and/or layered silicate builders. Oxydisuccinates are also especially useful in such compositions and combinations.<br>
Also suitable in the detergent compositions of the present invention are the 3,3-dicarboxy-4-oxa-1,6-hexanedioates and the related compounds disclosed in U.S. 4,566,984. Useful succinic acid builders include the C5-C20 alkyl and alkenyl<br>
succinic acids and salts thereof. A particularly preferred compound of this type is dodecenylsuccinic acid. Specific examples of succinate builders include: laurylsuccinate, myristylsuccinate, palmitylsuccinate, 2-dodecenylsuccinate (preferred), 2-pentadecenylsuccinate, and the like. Laurylsuccinates are the preferred builders of this group, and are described in EP 0,200,263.<br>
Other suitable polycarboxylates are disclosed in U.S 4,144,226 and in U.S. 3,308,067. See also U.S. 3,723,322.<br>
Fatty acids, e.g., C12-C18 monocarboxylic acids such as oleic acid and/or its salts, can also be incorporated into the compositions alone, or in combination with the aforesaid builders, especially citrate and/or the succinate builders, to provide additional builder activity. Such use of fatty acids will generally result in a diminution of sudsing, which should be taken into account by the formulator.<br>
In situations where phosphorus-based builders can be used, and especially in the formulation of bars used for hand-laundering operations, the various alkali metal phosphates such as the well-known sodium tripolyphosphates, sodium pyrophosphate and sodium orthophosphate can be used. Phosphonate builders such as etnane-1-hydroxy-1,1-diphosphonate and other known phosphonates (see, for example, U.S. Patents 3,159,581; 3,213,030; 3,422,021; 3,400,148 and 3,422,137) can also be used.<br>
Bleaching Compounds - Bleaching Agents and Bleach Activators The detergent compositions herein may optionally contain a bleaching system such as bleaching agents or bleaching compositions containing a bleaching agent and one or more bleach activators. When present, bleaching agents will typically be at levels of from 1% to 30%, more typically from 5% to 20%, of the detergent composition, especially for fabric laundering. If present, the amount of bleach activators will typically be from 0.1% to 60%, more typically from 0.5% to 40% of the bleaching composition comprising the bleaching agent-plus-bleach activator.<br>
The bleaching agents used herein can be any of the bleaching agents useful for detergent compositions in textile cleaning or other cleaning purposes that are now known or become known. These include oxygen bleaches as well as other bleaching agents. Perborate bleaches, e.g., sodium perborate (e.g., mono- or tetra-hydrate) can be used herein.<br>
Another category of bleaching agent that can be used without restriction encompasses percarboxylic acid bleaching agents and salts thereof. Suitable examples of this class of agents include magnesium monoperoxyphthalate hexahydrate, the magnesium salt of metachloro perbenzoic acid, 4-nonylamino-4-oxoperoxybutyric acid and diperoxydodecanedioic acid. Such bleaching agents are disclosed in U.S 4,483,781, U.S 740,446, EP 0,133,354, and U.S 4,412,934. Highly preferred bleaching agents also include 6-nonylamino-6-oxoperoxycaproic acid as described in U.S 4,634,551.<br>
Peroxygen bleaching agents can also be used. Suitable peroxygen bleaching compounds include sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate and equivalent "percarbonate" bleaches, sodium pyrophosphate peroxyhydrate, urea peroxyhydrate, and sodium peroxide. Persulfate bleach (e.g., OXONE, manufactured commercially by DuPont) can also be used.<br>
A preferred percarbonate bleach comprises dry particles having an average particle size in the range from 500 micrometers to 1,000 micrometers, not more than 10% by weight of said particles being smaller than 200 micrometers and not more than 10% by weight of said particles being larger than 1,250 micrometers. Optionally, the percarbonate can be coated with silicate, borate or water-soluble surfactants. Percarbonate is available from various commercial sources such as FMC, Solvay and Tokai Denka.<br>
Mixtures of bleaching agents can also be used.<br>
Peroxygen bleaching agents, the perborates, the percarbonates, etc., are preferably combined with bleach activators, which lead to the in situ production in aqueous solution (i.e., during the washing process) of the peroxy acid corresponding to the bleach activator. Various non-limiting examples of<br>
activators are disclosed in U.S 4,915,854, and U.S 4,412,934. The nonanoyloxybenzene sulfonate (NOBS), 3,5,5-tri-methyl hexanoyl oxybenzene sulfonate (ISONOBS) and tetraacetyl ethylene diamine (TAED) activators are typical, and mixtures thereof can also be used. See also U.S. 4,634,551 for other typical bleaches and activators useful herein. Highly preferred amido-derived bleach activators are those of the formulae:<br>
RlN(R5)C(O)R2C(0)L or R1C(O)N(R5)R2C(0)L wherein R1 is an alkyl group containing from 6 to 12 carbon atoms, R2 is an alkylene containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, R5 is H or alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl containing from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and L is any suitable leaving group. A leaving group is any group that is displaced from the bleach activator as a consequence of the nucleophilic attack on the bleach activator by the perhydrolysis anion. A preferred leaving group is phenyl sulfonate.<br>
Preferred examples of bleach activators of the above formulae include (6-octanamido-caproyl)oxybenzenesulfonate, (6-nonanamidocaproyl)oxybenzene sulfonate, (6-decanamido-caproyl)oxybenzenesulfonate, and mixtures thereof as described in U.S. Patent 4,634,551, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Another class of bleach activators comprises the benzoxazin-type activators disclosed by Hodge et al in U.S. Patent 4,966,723. A highly preferred activator of the benzoxazin-type is: (Formula Removed)<br>
Still another class of preferred bleach activators  includes the acyl lactam activators, especially acyl caprolactams and acyl valerolactams of the formulae: (Formula Removed)<br>
»<br>
wherein R6 is H or an alkyl, aryl, alkoxyaryl, or alkaryl group containing from 1 to 12   carbon   atoms.       Highly   preferred   lactam   activators   include   benzoyl<br>

See also U.S. Patent 4,545,784, issued to Sanderson, October 8, 1985, incorporated herein by reference, which discloses acyl caprolactams, including benzoyl caprolactam, adsorbed into sodium perborate.<br>
Bleaching agents other than oxygen bleaching agents are also known in the art and can be utilized herein. One type of non-oxygen bleaching agent of particular interest includes photoactivated bleaching agents such as the sulfonated zinc and/or aluminum phthalocyanines. See U.S. 4,033,718. If used, detergent compositions will typically contain from 0.025% to 1.25%, by weight, of such bleaches, especially sulfonate zinc phthalocyanine.<br>
If desired, the bleaching compounds can be catalyzed by means of a manganese compound. Such compounds are well-known in the art and include, for example, the manganese-based catalysts disclosed in U.S. 5,246,621, U.S. 5,244,594; U.S. 5,194,416; U.S. 5,114,606; and EP 549.271A1, 549.272A1, 544.440A2, and 544.490A1; Preferred examples of these catalysts include MnIV2(u-0)3(1,4,7-trimethyl-1 ,4,7-triazacyclononane)2(PF6)2, Mn"'2 (u-O)1 (u-OAc)2(1,4,7-trimethyl-1 ,4,7-triazacyclononane)2-(CIO4)2, MnIV4(U-O)6(1,4,7-triazacyclononane)4(CIO4)4, MnlllMnIV4(u-O)1(u-OAc)2-(1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane)2(CIO4)3, Mn'v(1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane)-(OCH3)3(PF6), and mixtures thereof. Other metal-based bleach catalysts include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. 4,430,243 and U.S. 5,114,611. The use of manganese with various complex ligands to enhance bleaching is also reported in the following US Patents: 4,728,455; 5,284,944; 5,246,612; 5,256,779; 5,280,117; 5,274,147; 5,153,161; and 5,227,084.<br>
As a practical matter, and not by way of limitation, the compositions and processes herein can be adjusted to provide on the order of at least one part per ten million of the active bleach catalyst species in the aqueous washing liquor, and will preferably provide from 0.1 ppm to 700 ppm, more preferably from 1 ppm to 500 ppm, of the catalyst species in the laundry liquor.<br>
Brighteners<br>
The compositions herein can also optionally contain from 0.005% to 5% by<br>
weight of certain types of hydrophilic optical brighteners which also provide a<br>
dye transfer inhibition action.   If used, the compositions herein will preferably<br>
comprise from 0.001% to 1% by weight of such optical brighteners.<br>
The hydrophilic optical brighteners useful in the present invention are those<br>
having the structural formula: (Formula Removed)<br>
wherein   R1   is   selected   from   anilino,   N-2-bis-hydroxyethyl   and    NH-2-hydroxyethyl; R£ is selected from N-2-bis-hydroxyethyl,  N-2-hydroxyethyl-N-methylamino, morphilino, chloro and amino; and M is a salt-forming cation such as sodium or potassium. When in the above formula, RI is anilino, R2 is N-2-bis-hydroxyethyl and M is a<br>
cation such as sodium, the brightener is 4,4',-bis[(4-anilino-6-(N-2-bis-hydroxyethyl)-s-triazine-2-yl)amino]-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid and disodium salt. This particular brightener species is commercially marketed under the tradename Tinopal-UNPA-GX® by Ciba-Geigy Corporation. Tinopal-UNPA-GX is the preferred hydrophilic optical brightener useful in the rinse added compositions herein. When in the above formula, R1 is anilino, R2 is N-2-hydroxyethyl-N-2-<br>
methylamino and M is a cation such as sodium, the brightener is 4,4'-bis[(4-<br>
anilino-6-(N-2-hydroxyethyl-N-methylamino)-s-triazine-2-yl)amino]2,2'-<br>
stilbenedisulfonic acid disodium salt.     This particular brightener species is<br>
commercially marketed under the tradename Tinopal 5BM-GX® by Ciba-Geigy<br>
Corporation.<br>
When in the above formula, R1 is anilino, R2 is morphilino and M is a cation<br>

Soil Release Agent<br><br>
In the present invention, an optional soil release agent can be added. Typical levels of incorporation in the composition are from 0% to 10%, preferably from 0.2% to 5%, of a soil release agent. Preferably, such a soil release agent is a polymer.<br>
Soil Release agents are desirably used in fabric softening compositions of the instant invention. Any polymeric soil release agent known to those skilled in the art can optionally be employed in the compositions of this invention. Polymeric soil release agents are characterized by having both hydrophilic segments, to hydrophilize the surface of hydrophobic fibers, such as polyester and nylon, and hydrophobic segments, to deposit upon hydrophobic fibers and remain adhered thereto through completion of washing and rinsing cycles and, thus, serve as an anchor for the hydrophilic segments. This can enable stains occurring subsequent to treatment with the soil release agent to be more easily cleaned in later washing procedures.<br>
If utilized, soil release agents will generally comprise from about 0.01% to about 10.0%, by weight, of the detergent compositions herein, typically from about 0.1% to about 5%, preferably from about 0.2% to about 3.0%.<br>
The following, all included herein by reference, describe soil release polymers suitable for use in the present invention. U.S. 3,959,230 Hays, issued May 25, 1976; U.S. 3,893,929 Basadur, issued July 8, 1975; U.S. 4,000,093, Nicol, et a/., issued December 28, 1976; U.S. Patent 4,702,857 Gosselink, issued October 27, 1987; U.S. 4,968,451, Scheibel et a/., issued November 6; U.S. 4,702,857, Gosselink, issued October 27, 1987; U.S. 4,711,730, Gosselink ef a/., issued December 8, 1987; U.S. 4,721,580, Gosselink, issued January 26, 1988; U.S. 4,877,896, Maldonado ef a/., issued October 31, 1989; U.S. 4,956,447, Gosselink et a/., issued September 11, 1990; U.S. 5,415,807 Gosselink et a/., issued May 16, 1995; European Patent Application 0 219 048, published April 22, 1987 by Kud, et a/..<br>
Further suitable soil release agents are described in U.S. 4,201,824, Violland et a/.; U.S. 4,240,918 Lagasse ef a/.; U.S. 4,525,524 Tung ef a/.; U.S. 4,579,681, Ruppert ef a/.; U.S. 4,240,918; U.S. 4,787,989; U.S. 4,525,524; EP 279,134 A,<br>
1988, to Rhone-Poulenc Chemie; EP 457,205 A to BASF (1991); and DE 2,335,044 to Unilever N. V., 1974 all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Commercially available soil release agents include the METOLOSE SM100, METOLOSE SM200 manufactured by Shin-etsu Kagaku Kogyo K.K., SOKALAN type of material, e.g., SOKALAN HP-22, available from BASF (Germany), ZELCON 5126 (from Dupont) and MILEASE T (from ICI).<br>
Scum Dispersant<br>
In the present invention, the premix can be combined with an optional scum dispersant, other than the soil release agent, and heated to a temperature at or above the melting point(s) of the components.<br>
The preferred scum dispersants  herein  are formed by highly ethoxylating hydrophobic materials.   The hydrophobic material can be a fatty alcohol, fatty acid,  fatty  amine,  fatty  acid  amide,   amine  oxide,  quaternary  ammonium compound, or the hydrophobic moieties used to form soil release polymers. The preferred  scum  dispersants  are   highly  ethoxylated,  e.g.,   more  than   17, preferably more than 25, more preferably more than 40, moles of ethylene oxide per molecule on the average, with the polyethylene oxide portion being from 76% to 97%, preferably from 81% to 94%, of the total molecular weight. The level of scum dispersant is sufficient to keep the scum at an acceptable, preferably unnoticeable to the consumer, level under the conditions of use, but not enough to adversely affect softening. For some purposes it is desirable that the scum is nonexistent. Depending on the amount of anionic or nonionic detergent, etc., used in the wash cycle of a typical laundering process, the efficiency of the rinsing steps prior to the introduction of the compositions herein, and the water hardness, the amount of anionic or nonionic detergent surfactant and detergency builder (especially phosphates and zeolites) entrapped in the fabric (laundry) will vary.   Normally, the minimum amount of scum dispersant should be used to avoid adversely affecting softening properties. Typically scum dispersion requires at least 2%, preferably at least 4% (at least 6% and preferably at least 10% for maximum scum avoidance) based upon the level of softener active. However, at levels of 10% (relative to the softener material) or more, one risks loss of softening efficacy of the product especially when the fabrics contain high proportions of nonionic surfactant which has been absorbed during the washing operation.<br>
Preferred scum dispersants are: Brij 700®; Varonic U-250®; Genapol T-500®, Genapol T-800®; Plurafac A-79®; and Neodol 25-50®.<br>
Bactericides<br>
Examples of bactericides used in the compositions of this invention include glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, 2-bromo-2-nitro-propane-1,3-diol sold by Inolex Chemicals, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, under the trade name Bronopol®, and a mixture of 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazoline-3-one and 2-methyl-4-isothiazoline-3-one sold by Rohm and Haas Company under the trade name Kathon 1 to 1,000 ppm by weight of the agent.<br>
Perfume<br>
The laundry and cleaning composition of the present invention can also contain another perfume composition. Suitable perfumes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. 5,500,138, said patent being incorporated herein by reference.

Such water-soluble chelating agents can be selected from the group consisting of amino carboxylates, amino phosphonates, polyfunctionally-substituted aromatic chelating agents and mixtures thereof, all as hereinafter defined. The whiteness and/or brightness of fabrics are substantially improved or restored by such chelating agents and the stability of the materials in the compositions are improved. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the benefit of these materials is due in part to their exceptional ability to remove iron and manganese ions from washing solutions by formation of soluble chelates.<br>
Amino    carboxylates     useful     as    optional     chelating    agents    include<br>
ethylenediaminetetracetates,	N-hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetates,<br>
nitrilotriacetates,       ethylenediamine       tetraproprionates,       triethylenetetra-aminehexacetates,   diethylenetriaminepentaacetates,    and   ethanoldiglycines,<br>
alkali metal, ammonium, and substituted ammonium salts therein and mixtures therein.<br>
Amino phospdonates are also suitable for use as chelating agents in the compositions of the invention when at lease low levels of total phosphorus are permitted in detergent compositions, and include ethylenediaminetetrakis (methylenephosphonates) as DEQUEST. Preferred, these amino phosphonates to not contain alkyl or alkenyl groups with more than about 6 carbon atoms.<br>
Polyfunctionally-substituted aromatic chelating agents are also useful in the compositions herein. See U.S. Patent 3,812,044, issued May 21, 1974, to Connor et al. Preferred compounds of this type in acid form are dihydroxydisulfobenzenes such as 1,2-dihydroxy-3,5-disulfobenzene.<br>
A preferred biodegradable chelator for use herein is ethylenediamine disuccinate ("EDDS"), especially the [S,S] isomer as described in U.S. Patent 4,704,233, November 3, 1987, to Hartman and Perkins.<br>

acid<br>
Organo monophosphonic acid or one of its salts or complexes is also suitable for<br>
use herein as a CGI.<br>
By organo monophosphonic acid it is meant herein an organo monophosphonic acid which does not contain nitrogen as part of its chemical structure. This definition therefore excludes the organo aminophosphonates, which however may be included in compositions of the invention as heavy metal ion sequestrants.<br>
The organo monophosphonic acid component may be present in its acid form or in the form of one of its salts or complexes with a suitable counter cation. Preferably any salts/complexes are water soluble, with the alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts/complexes being especially preferred.<br>
A prefered organo monophosphonic acid is 2-phosphonobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid commercially available from Bayer under the tradename of Bayhibit.<br>
Enzyme<br>
The compositions and processes herein can optionally employ one or more enzymes such as lipases, proteases, cellulase, amylases and peroxidases. A preferred enzyme for use herein is a cellulase enzyme. Indeed, this type of enzyme will further provide a color care benefit to the treated fabric. Cellulases<br>
usable herein include both bacterial and fungal types, preferably having a pH optimum  between  5 and  9.5.     U.S.     4,435,307  discloses  suitable fungal cellulases from Humicola insolens or Humicola strain DSM1800 or a cellulase 212-producing  fungus  belonging  to  the  genus  Aeromonas,   and   cellulase extracted from the hepatopancreas of a marine mollusk, Dolabella Auricula Solander.    Suitable cellulases are also disclosed in GB-A-2.075.028; GB-A-2.095.275 and DE-OS-2.247.832.    CAREZYME® and CELLUZYME® (Novo) are especially useful.    Other suitable cellulases are also disclosed in WO 91/17243  to  Novo,  WO  96/34092,  WO  96/34945  and  EP-A-0,739,982.   In practical terms for current commercial preparations, typical amounts are up to 5 mg by weight, more typically 0.01 mg to 3 mg, of active enzyme per gram of the detergent composition.   Stated otherwise, the compositions herein will typically comprise from 0.001% to 5%, preferably 0.01%-1% by weight of a commercial enzyme preparation.  In the particular cases where activity of the enzyme preparation can be defined otherwise such as with cellulases, corresponding activity units are preferred (e.g. CEVU or cellulase Equivalent Viscosity Units). For instance, the compositions of the present invention can contain cellulase enzymes at a level equivalent to an activity from 0.5 to 1000 CEVU/gram of composition. Cellulase enzyme preparations used for the purpose of formulating the compositions of this invention typically have an activity comprised between 1,000 and 10,000 CEVU/gram in liquid form, around 1,000 CEVU/gram in solid form.<br>
Optionally, the detergent ingredients can include one or more other detersive adjuncts or other materials for assisting or enhancing cleaning performance, treatment of the substrate to be cleaned, or to modify the aesthetics of the detergent composition.<br>
Other preferred optional ingredients when used are employed at their conventional art-established levels of use, generally from 0% to about 80% by weight of the detergent ingredients, preferably from about 0.5% to about 20% and can include color speckles, suds boosters, suds suppressors, antitarnish and/or anticorrosion agents, soil-suspending agents, dyes, fillers, germicides, alkalinity sources, hydrotropes, antioxidants, enzyme stabilizing agents, solvents, solubilizing agents, clay soil removal/anti-redeposition agents, polymeric dispersing agents, processing aids, fabric softening components such<br>
as clay, static control agents, bleach stabilizers, materials effective for inhibiting the transfer of dyes from one fabric to another during the cleaning process (i.e., dye transfer inhibiting agents), polymeric dispersing agents, optical brighteners or other brightening or whitening agents, other active ingredients, carriers, processing aids, dyes or pigments, solvents for liquid formulations and solid fillers for bar compositions, etc.<br>
Preferably, for the purpose of the invention, the laundry and cleaning composition is selected from a detergent composition, a hard surface cleaning composition, a dishwashing composition, more preferably is a detergent composition, more preferably a granular detergent composition.<br>
Granular Detergent Composition<br>
The perfume composition and encapsulated particles hereinbefore described can be used in both low density (below 550 grams/liter) and high density granular detergent compositions in which the density of the granule is at least 550 grams/liter or in a laundry detergent additive product. Such high density detergent compositions typically comprise from about 30% to about 90% of detersive surfactant.<br>
Low density compositions can be prepared by standard spray- drying processes. Various means and equipment are available to prepare high density granular detergent compositions. Current commercial practice in the field employs spray-drying towers to manufacture granular laundry detergents which often have a density less than about 500 g/l. Accordingly, if spray drying is used as part of the overall process, the resulting spray-dried detergent particles must be further densified using the means and equipment described hereinafter. In the alternative, the formulator can eliminate spray-drying by using mixing, densifying and granulating equipment that is commercially available.<br>
High speed mixer/densifiers can be used in the present process. For example, the device marketed under the trademark "Lodige CB30" Recycler comprises a static cylindrical mixing drum having a central rotating shaft with mixing/cutting blades mounted thereon. Other such apparatus includes the devices<br>
marketed under the trademark "Shugi Granulator" and under the trademark "Drais K-TTP 80". Equipment such as that marketed under the trademark "Lodige KM600 Mixer" can be used for further densification.<br>
In one mode of operation, the compositions are prepared and densified by passage through two mixer and densifier machines operating in sequence. Thus, the desired compositional ingredients can be admixed and passed through a Lodige mixture using residence times of 0.1 to 1.0 minute then passed through a second Lodige mixer using residence times of 1 minute to 5 minutes.<br>
In another mode, an aqueous slurry comprising the desired formulation ingredients is sprayed into a fluidized bed of particulate surfactants. The resulting particles can be further densified by passage through a Lodige apparatus, as noted above. The perfume delivery particles are admixed with the detergent composition in the Lodige apparatus.<br>
The final density of the particles herein can be measured by a variety of simple techniques, which typically involve dispensing a quantity of the granular detergent into a container of known volume, measuring the weight of detergent and reporting the density in grams/liter.<br>
Once the low or high density granular detergent "base" composition is prepared, the encapsulated perfume particles of this invention are added thereto by any suitable dry-mixing operation.<br>
Other applications of the perfume and/or encapsulated perfume particles of the invention<br>
The perfume composition and/or encapsulated perfume particle hereinbefore described as components of the laundry detergent compositions herein may also be used to impart surprising odor benefits, especially on dry fabrics in the absence of the detersive ingredient of the laundry and cleaning composition embodiments of this invention. Thus, for example, a fabric conditioning composition comprising only the perfume composition and/or encapsulated perfume particle themselves, or comprising an aqueous solution of the perfume composition and/or encapsulated perfume particle, may be added<br>
during the rinse cycle of a conventional home laundering operation in order to impart the desired pleasing scent benefits hereinbefore described.<br>
Deposition of Perfume onto Fabric Surfaces<br>
The method of washing fabrics and depositing perfume thereto comprises contacting said fabrics with-an aqueous wash liquor comprising at least about 100 ppm of conventional detersive ingredients described hereinabove, as well as at least about 0.1 ppm of the above-disclosed perfume composition and/or encapsulated perfume particles. Preferably, the aqueous liquor comprises from about 500 ppm to about 20,000 ppm of the conventional detersive ingredients and from about 10 ppm to about 200 ppm of the perfume composition and/or encapsulated perfume particles of the invention.<br>
When the perfume composition of the invention is in encapsulated form, the encapsulated perfume particles work under all wash conditions, but they are particularly useful for providing odor benefits to the wet laundry solution during use and on dried fabrics during their storage.<br>
Method of use<br>
Also provided herein is a method of delivering perfume residuality on surfaces, preferably mixed type of surfaces, which comprises the steps of contacting the surface to be treated with a perfume composition of the invention or composition containing said perfume composition, preferably in an aqueous medium.<br>
By "surface", it is meant any surface onto which the perfume composition can deposit. Typical examples of such material are fabrics, hard surfaces such as dishware, floors, bathrooms, toilet, kitchen and other surfaces in need of a release of a perfume scent such as that with litter like animal litter.<br>
By "mixed type of surfaces", it is meant surfaces made of more than one materials. For examples, where the surface to be treated is a fabric, the fabric or fabric load is composed for example of synthetic and cotton. When the surface is a hard surface, it can be made of plastic and ceramic.<br>
When not specified, by "perfume composition of the invention", it is meant a perfume composition per se, and/or an encapsulated perfume particles, and/or laundry and cleaning composition comprising said perfume composition per se, and/or an encapsulated perfume particles.<br>
