The present invention relates to prefabricated building panels, and more particularly but not exclusively to thermal and acoustic insulating building panels.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Described in Australian Patent 568548 is a building panel which consists of a core of expanded cellular plastics material within which there is embedded vertical columns formed from metal strip. The columns have a U shaped transverse cross section. Still further, the panel has horizontally extending strips at the top and bottom of the panel..<br>
The above mentioned building panels are expensive to manufacture.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
It is the object of the present invention to overcome or substantially ameliorate the above disadvantages.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
There is disclosed herein a building panel comprising:<br>
a core of expanded plastics material of generally rectilinear configuration having two major generally parallel and coextensive surfaces which are separated by the thickness of the core; and<br>
a plurality of generally parallel coextensive reinforcing channel members, the channel members being arranged so as to extend generally parallel to an edge of the panel and being transversely spaced, each member having a longitudinally extending base portion from which there transversely extends longitudinally extending leg portions, with the base portion or one of the legs being arranged so as to be generally co-planar with one of said surface; and wherein<br>
the panel is not provided with reinforcing strips extending generally transverse of said reinforcing members.<br>
Preferably, said expanded plastics material has a density of 16 to 24 kg/m’. Brief Description of the Drawing<br>
The preferred forms of the present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic perspective view of a building panel;<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic perspective view of a further building panel; and<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic perspective view of a reinforcing member employed in the panel of Figure 2.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
In Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings there is schematically depicted a building panel 10, which is to be used with wall of a building.<br><br>
The panel 10 is formed of expanded plastics material such as expanded polystyrene having a density of 16 to 24 kg/m3. Being formed of expanded plastics material, the panel 10 has good thermal and acoustic insulating properties.<br>
The panel 10 has a core 11 formed of the expanded plastics material, within which there is embedded a plurality of vertically extending reinforcing members 12 and 13.<br>
The reinforcing members 12 and 13 have a U-shaped transverse cross section so as to have a base 14 from which there extends a pair of legs 15.<br>
The core 11 is of a rectilinear configuration having a pair of generally parallel coextensive major surfaces 16 and 17 and generally parallel vertically extending edges 18 and 19. The edges 18 and 19 are arranged so that adjacent panels of the same configuration have overlapping portions. In this embodiment, the edges 18 and 19 are stepped, however it should be appreciated that other edge configurations may be employed such as a "tongue and groove" configuration.<br>
Each of the members 12 and 13 has its base portion 14 generally co-planar with respect to its associated surface 16 or 17. In this regard it should be appreciated that the members 12 and 13 are arranged in two sets, each set associated with a respective one of the surfaces 16 or 17.<br>
The members 12 and 13 extend vertically the full height of the panel 10 and are dimensioned to provide the panel 10 with sufficient rigidity and load supporting characteristics. Preferably the members 12 and 13 are galvanized steel members having a material thickness of .75 mm and a width (base 14) of about 90 mm and a depth (legs 15) of about 30 mm.<br>
When the panel 10 is being formed, a hollow mould is provided and the members<br>
12	and 13 placed in the mould and held in position. Thereafter, the polystyrene beads<br>
are placed under pressure with the use of steam to cause them to expand and form the<br>
core 11. Preferably the members 12 and 13 are coated with a chloroprene base adhesive<br>
to ensure that they adhere to the core 11.<br>
The above mentioned panel 10 may be used to form a wall in conjunction with other panels as discussed. Preferably the wall would be provided with a top plate 20, and a bottom plate 21. The plates 20 and 21 would be of a channel configuration having a longitudinally extending slot dimensioned to cooperate with the depth of the panel 10. Preferably the members 12 and 13 would be secured to the plates 20 and 21 by means of fasteners such as screws and rivets.<br>
In the above discussed preferred embodiment, the members 12 and 13 are aligned transversely of the core 11.   However it should be appreciated that the members 12 and<br>
13	may also be staggered so as to not be transversely aligned.<br>
Typically, the panel 10 would have overall dimensions of 2400 x 1200 x 90 mm.<br><br>
In Figures 2 and 3 there is schematically depicted a building panel 30. The panel 30, as with the panel 10, is to be used with co-operating panels of similar configuration to form a wall, particularly an internal wall they are building.<br>
The panel 30 is formed of expanded polystyrene foam having a density of 16-24 kg/m-*.   More preferably, it has a density of 20 kg/m’.<br>
The panel 30 has segments 31 formed of the expanded plastics material, between which there is located vertically extending reinforcing members 32 and 33. If so require further reinforcing members may be provided.<br>
The reinforcing members 32 and 33 have a U-shaped transverse cross section so as to have a base 34 from which there extends a pair of legs 35.<br>
The panel 30 is of rectilinear configuration having a parentally parallel co extensive major surfaces 36 and 37 and generally parallel vertically extending edges 38 and 39. The edges 38 and 39 are arranged so that adjacent panels of the same configuration have overlapping portions. In this embodiment, the edges 38 and 39 are step, however it should be appreciated that other edge configurations may be employed such as a "tongue and groove" configuration.<br>
Each of the members 32 and 33 has its legs 35 generally co-planar with respect to the major surfaces 36 and 37. In this regard it should be appreciated that the members 32 and 33 have their legs 35 projecting generally within the plane of the panel 30.<br>
The members 32 and 33 extend vertically the full height of the panel 30 and are dimensioned to provide panel 30 with sufficient rigidity and load supporting characteristics. Preferably, the members 32 and 33 are galvanised steel members having a thickness of about 0.75 mm, a width (base 34) of about 90 mm and a depth (leg 35) of about 30 mm. Another example is having the panel about 75 mm thick, that is the base 34 would be 75 mm.<br>
Each of the members 32 and 33 is provided with a plurality of apertures 40 in its base 34 so that the expanded polystyrene foam may extend therethrough to join the segments 31.<br>
Preferably, the reinforcing members are coated with an adhesive such as a chloroprene based adhesive.  For example, the adhesive could be spray applied.<br>
The abovementioned panel 30 may be used to form a wall in conjunction with other panels as discussed. Preferably, the wall would be provided with a top plate 41 and a bottom plate 42. The plates 41 and 42 would be of a channel configuration having a longitudinal extending slot dimensioned to co-operate with the depth of the panel 30. Preferably, the members 32 and 33 would be secured to the plates 41 and 42 by means of fasteners such as screws or rivets.<br><br><br>
