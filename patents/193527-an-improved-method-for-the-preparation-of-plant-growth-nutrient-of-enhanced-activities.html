				<td>Introduction to the Field of the Invention:<br>
This invention relates to an improved method for the preparation of plant growth nutrient of enhanced activities<br>
Prior Art and Drawbacks:<br>
It is well known that higher fatty alcohol can be denved from plant sources and that triacontanol, C-30 alcohol is a prominent plant growth promoter Higher fatty alcohol such as C-28 to C32<br>
alcohol have been extracted by many methods in the past and vanous formulations based on the same are currently used as plant growth promoters<br>
For example, plant waxes such as nee bran wax, carnauba wax, sugarcane wax have been a source which are subjected to a first step of saponification and the unsaponified matter is then subjected is solvent extraction for obtaining higher fatty alcohol<br>
In another method, the unsaponifiable are subjected to reduction<br>
In yet another method, rice bran oil distillation residue is subjected to saponification, then treatment with alkaline earth metal halides and then extraction and salting out<br>
Plant growth promoting compositions prepared by these methods have been of course effective and have given useful results<br>
However, our research has established that the full potential of the important constituent triacontanol has not been realized due to the punty level of same not exceeding 95% or 96% at the most<br>
It is possible to enhance the growth promotion effect and extent of areas of uses if the punty of C-30 alcohol is over 96% and of the order of 98% or even more<br>
Objects of the Invention:<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to propose an improved method for the extraction of triacontanol of higher punty than possible so far from plant sources and convert the same into an effective plant growth nutrient composition<br>
2<br>
 It is another object of this invention to propose a plant growth promoter composition having higher synergistic activity than known growth promoting compositions<br>
In the pursuit of achieving our objects, we have investigated various other sources of triacontanol and have carried out extensive experiments, prepared formulations based on the triacontanol of the new and hitherto untried source We have also applied these formulation on various plants, vegetables, fruits bearing plants, leaf bearing plants and many others and in all cases we have obtained unexpected excellent results We have also found that small quantities of micro nutrients with the new triacontanol gave excellent results BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>

nutrient composition from sugar cane mud which comprises<br>

i.	Subjecting sugarcane press mud to a step of organic solvent extraction,<br>
II.	Recovering the sugarcane wax there from,<br>
iii.	Subjecting an alcoholic suspension of the sugarcane wax to a step of trans-esterification<br>

iv.	Concentrating the esterified product,<br>
v	Subjecting same to organic solvent extraction in the presence of inorganic acid<br>
vi.	Followed by the filtration of the extract to obtain crude triacontanol, where after<br>
vii. The crude product is subjected to crystallization using organic solvent to obtain technical<br>
grade traicontanol VIII. Converting same to high purity grade by purification through column chromatography on<br>
silicagel using solvents of varying polarity and<br>
ix.	collecting pure n-triacontanol from petroleum ether fraction which is filtered and dried to<br>
obtain pure n-triacontanol crystals and there after<br>
(B) converting the said pure triacontanol into applicable formulations like emulsions / solutions / or other useful forms with or without conventional micro nutrients in a conventional manner using conventional ingredients<br>
The formulations are thus prepared with or without micro nutrients suited for Application to agricultural crops cereals, floriculture, vegetables products such as potatoes and tomatoes, plantation crops such as bananas, tea and for fruit plants For further details of the extraction process, attention is invited to the parent Application<br>
