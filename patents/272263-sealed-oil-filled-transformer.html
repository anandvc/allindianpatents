				<td>Field Of The Inyeotign:<br>
The present invention relates to sealed oil filled transformers and a method of<br>
making the same. These transformers are used for conversion of electric energy<br>
from one level to another for various purpose, and are of sealed construction to<br>
eliminate ingress of atmospheric moisture.<br>
Background Qt The Inventign:-<br>
For distribution and transmission of electricity from generating station to various<br>
utilities transformer is a Vital device. The transformers are generally oil filled and<br>
the oil in the transformers acts as a cooling and dielectric agent to cater to the<br>
requirement of the transformer for working at high voltages. For good service life<br>
it is required to continuously maintain the oil quality so that it carries out both<br>
the required functions effectively throughout the long service life of the<br>
transformer.<br>
The dielectric capacity of the transformer oil is dependent on the moisture<br>
content of the oil. Presence of even minute traces of moisture, above a certain<br>
level, lowers the oil dielectric property drastically even so much so that if moisture content is higher, even in parts per millions, it becomes a reason for<br>
failure of the transformer. Hence, to ensure good dielectric property of oil it is<br>
essential to maintain the oil moisture content at the acceptable level continuously<br>
during service of transformer.<br>
The second important factor is to keep a check on the sludge content in the oil.<br>
When the oil is exposed to air, the oxygen present in the air oxidizes the hydrocarbons<br>
in oil and creates heavy compounds that settle in the form of sludge in<br>
the transformer and restrict heat dissipation leading to over-heating and failure<br>
of the transformer.<br>
The third factor in oil-filled transformers to be taken care is that during its<br>
service, the transformer gets heated up when transformer has to cater for higher<br>
loads. During this period the oil also becomes hot and on heating it expands. To<br>
allow for oil expansion without causing build-up of pressure that may damage<br>
the transformer tank, transformers are provided with oil expansion chamber<br>
called conservator. The conservator is half filled with oil and the other half is<br>
kept empty, only filled with air. When the transformer is catering to higher loads<br>
the oil also heats up and expands. The expanded oil rises from the transformer<br>
oil tank and goes into the conservator. Similarly, when the load is not there, the<br>
transformer cools down, cooling the oil. Now on cooling, the oil contracts and the extra oil form the conservator goes into the transformer tank. To facilitate<br>
smooth exchange of oil, conservator is provided with a small outlet that allows<br>
the air to go from the conservator into the atmosphere, when oil heats up and<br>
expands, and lets air into the conservator when oil contracts on cooling down.<br>
The air is passed through a moisture removing device, called silica gel breather,<br>
so that only dry air goes in the conservator and moisturized air is prevented to<br>
come into contact with oil. But, this requires lot of maintenance of air-drying<br>
silica gel breather which is a cumbersome task. Even with best of efforts and<br>
practices many times moist air still comes into contact with oil due to the above<br>
arrangement and it has been always felt that the best way is to avoid contact of<br>
air with oil completely for better life of the transformer.<br>
Prior Art And Background:-<br>
At present, for sealed type of transformers, the folloWing arrangements are<br>
being used:<br>
1. USPatent No. 5,736,915 dated April 7th, 1998 from Goedde et al. describes a<br>
hermetically sealed non-venting electrical apparatus with dielectric fluid.<br>
However, in this invention for the expansion of the dielectric fluid, expandable<br>
chamber with flexible walls is required. The practical problem faced in provision<br>
of expandable chamber with flexible walls is that the life of the expandable chamber is limited. Many times the flexible walls develop leaks and overall<br>
arrangement is costly. Whereas in the presently proposed method the metal<br>
conservator with extra space provides for simple and cost effective long term<br>
solution with none of the above problems.<br>
2. USPatent No 6,233,198 dated February 1, 1966 from Roger F Schrader et al.<br>
describes a Hermetically sealed distribution transformer with the transformer<br>
being totally filled with dielectric fluid and sealed, allowing no extra space for<br>
expansion of dielectric fluid. This arrangement is possible only for very small<br>
ratings of transformers in the range of 100-200 VA and low voltage application of<br>
120V 240 V since, for any larger rating the fluid volume will be such that<br>
containing the same in completely sealed chamber without any space for<br>
allowance of thermal expansion of fluid will not be feasible as it will lead to<br>
bursting of the sealed chamber. In the present proposed arrangement the<br>
transformers rated in the range of 500KVAand high voltage class of 66KV are<br>
possible.<br>
3. US Patent No 3,544,938 dated June 12, 1969 from Elmer G Bergmann et al.<br>
describes sealed power transformers with the space for expansion of fluid in the<br>
same tank without extra conservator. In this type of transformer design the<br>
problem is that proper protection for detection of gas in case of internal transformer fault cannot be provided. Any type of fault inside a liquid a liquid<br>
filled transformer results in generation of gas and early detection of gas using<br>
gas detection relays prOVideseffective protection of transformers by early fault<br>
detection and safety from catastrophic failure of transformer that may lead to<br>
serious accident. Also, for llKV class and above the design has got limitations as<br>
the HV bushing ends inside the tank are exposed to air leading to reqUirement of<br>
expensive bushings with higher creepage.<br>
4. In other practices, the oil filled transformers are prOVidedwith conservator<br>
and a rubber or plastic bag, filled with air, is prOVidedinside the conservator on<br>
top of the oil. The air bag then expands and contracts to take care of the change<br>
in volume of transformer fluid due to thermal expansion. However, this has a<br>
problem that the arrangement is expensive and frequently the rubber bags<br>
develop leakage due to continuous contact with hot oil and number of cycles of<br>
expansion and contraction experienced over the long service life of the<br>
transformer. This requires continuous maintenance and checking of expansion<br>
bags or membranes inside the conservators. The arrangement is more suitable<br>
for larger transformer where the fixing of air bag inside the large conservator can<br>
be made easily. But, for smaller transformer with small size of conservator, the<br>
arrangement is difficult and maintenance of rubber membrane bags is cumbersome. This problem is eliminated in the proposed arrangement where the<br>
air spaceabove the oil inside the conservator provides for expansion of oil.<br>
S. In yet another practice the transformer tank walls are made of thin steel<br>
corrugated sheet having continuous fin-like structure. The corrugations in the<br>
steel sheets are flexible so that the fins, created by the sheet corrugations are<br>
flexible and can expand and contract as the oil expands or contracts. The<br>
expansion and contraction of the corrugated sheets take care of the change in<br>
the volume of fluid during service. These type of transformers are not provided<br>
with conservator and the tank is completely sealed. But, the shortcoming in this<br>
arrangement is that the tank walls are very thin, only 1.0 to 1.2 mm, and are<br>
prone to easy damage during transportation and storage. Another problem is<br>
that during service there is a slow permanent set in the steel corrugations which<br>
requires frequent oil topping up. The thin steel walls are also not suitable for<br>
sufficient vacuum and pressure required for drying up of transformers in case of<br>
any problem at site when the transformer fault needs to be attended by opening<br>
the transformer. Further problem is that expensive differential oil and gas<br>
protection relay is required for protection, instead of simple standard buchholz<br>
relay. In the present proposed arrangement the transformer tank is made with<br>
standard sturdy steel walls which are rugged and suitable for long service in the<br>
most strenuous conditions. There is no permanent set in the extra space provided for the oil expansion in the conservator which gives trouble free<br>
operation and the transformer is fully suited to take the desired vacuum level<br>
and pressure required for processing in case any repair is required at site. Thus<br>
this present arrangement leads to a very simple and cost effective sealed<br>
transformer arrangement which gives maintenance free unattended and safe<br>
long service life to the transformer.<br>
The present invention overcomes the above mentioned drawbacks of the prior<br>
art.<br>
Objects Of The Invention:-<br>
It is therefore, an object of the present invention to prOVidea sealed oil filled<br>
transformer which does not have an expandable chamber.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provided a sealed oil filled transformer<br>
which has a long service life.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provided sealed oil filled transformer with<br>
conservator but without an air bag.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to prOVidea sealed oil filled transformer<br>
without thin walled corrugated steel sheets.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a sealed oil filled transformer<br>
which allows normal oil and gas relay protection for the transformer. Another object of the invention is to provide sealed oil transformers which have<br>
capacity of up to 1000 KVA.<br>
grief Description Of The Accompanying Drawing:-<br>
Fig. 1 shows the front view and side view of the sealed oil transformer according<br>
to the invention.<br>
The invention will now be described in an exemplary embodiment as depicted in<br>
the accompanying drawing. However, then can be other embodiments of the<br>
same inventions, all of which are deemed covered by this description.<br>
Description Of The Invention:-<br>
In the proposed invention of a sealed type of transformer (A), the arrangement<br>
is shown in the figure-1. As per the figure, the main transformer tank (01) is<br>
made in the similar fashion as the conventional oil tank with steel walls of<br>
sufficient thickness as required for suitable vacuum and pressure levels.<br>
Additional stiffeners (12), wherever reqUired, are provided.<br>
Rollers(03) and HV/LV bushings (04) are prOVIDEdon the side or top of the tank,<br>
as required. The conservator (06) is made bigger than the usual conventional conservator<br>
used in the oil filled transformers. The volume of the oil in the conservator is<br>
kept same as that required in conventional transformer, to cater for the oil<br>
expansion and contraction during the service but, the total volume of the<br>
conservator is increased. The increased volume of conservator is kept for the<br>
space for air expansion and contraction during service. The complete volume of<br>
the conservator is calculated considering the total service temperature range, the<br>
expected maximum ambient air temperature variation and the maximum change<br>
in volume of oil expected during the service under the worst of circumstances.<br>
The total conservator volume and its size is thus increased so that the pressure<br>
inside the transformer can rise only up to a pre-determined value when the oil<br>
expands on heating, due to normal loading or overload conditions.<br>
During service, when oil temperature rises, the oil expands. The air, being a gas,<br>
gets compressed and when the oil temperature falls, the oil contracts and the air<br>
in the conservator expands. The increased volume of the conservator is<br>
calculated such that during the worst of load condition also the expansion of oil<br>
gives rise to the pre-determined maximum air pressure. The air inside the larger<br>
conservator acts as a cushion and continuous exchange of air with raw<br>
atmospheric air is avoided. The conservator is connected to the tank through<br>
standard gas and oil protection relay, the buchholz relay (07). All other fittings<br>
and accessoriesare also standard and maintained as in any conventional oil filled transformer for case in maintenance/replacement. In the accompanied figure the<br>
transformer is shown with pressure relief valve, part no. 08 of figure-1, but, the<br>
same arrangement can be used with pressure relief vent also. The list of<br>
components given below gives the main components of the transformer.<br>
The empty portion of the transformer conservator is filled with dry air or with dry<br>
nitrogen after filling the transformer with oil, and then sealed to have a trouble<br>
free and Virtually maintenance free long service life. The breather or air bag<br>
inside the conservator is not required and the conservator is totally sealed. The<br>
magnetic oil level gauge (09), is SUitably fixed in the lower half of the<br>
conservator instead of in the center to monitor the oil level in conservator. <br>
