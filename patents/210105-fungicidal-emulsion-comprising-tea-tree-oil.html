				<td>FUNGICIDAL EMULSION COMPRISING TEA TREE OIL<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates fungicide composition containing tea tree oil (hereinafter TTO) and more specifically to an etheric oil emulsion obtained from the tea tree, especially adapted for the control of wide range of fungal plant pathogens.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Increasing intensive agriculture favors the epidemic development of many new and previously unknown plant pests. This development has in turn necessarily led to the use of increasing dosage of chemicals, which negatively affects environmental health. On the other hand, registered pesticides are not always available to control pests effectively and reliably. Therefore, health and environmental considerations dictate the need for alternative method of pest control, which can be promoted as possible strategies for inclusions in an Integrated Pest Management program. This program is a combination of crop protection practice, designed to maintain pests below a designated economic threshold; these practice fall into the categories of chemical; cultural and host-plant resistance.<br>
The control and treatment of plant diseases in green houses and field-grown horticultural corps is a serious problem in agriculture. So far powdering or spraying compositions of mineral source, e.g., sulfur, cuprous hydroxide, calcium polysulfate etc. or compositions based on detergents or oils have been mainly used. However, the use of said compositions is very unsatisfactory as they have many drawbacks.<br>
It has been shown that tea tree oil inhibits certain fungi (See for example Australian Journal of Experimental Agriculture 39:1, 81- 86, 1999). The treatment was satisfactory as it killed the fungi to a large extent, and mainly fungi that attack human, while in plants it caused phytotoxicity to attacked plants.<br>
-1-<br><br>
It was thus desirable to develop a composition adapted to the treatment of a wide range of fungal plant pathogens, e.g., which would not use any of the above known compositions, e.g., mineral oils, detergents and/or fats. However, it may comprise tea tree oil as one of its components. It should be convenient to use and be stable.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the core of the invention to provide a cost effective fungicidal emulsion comprising tea tree oil and a water emulsion, wherein the emulsifier is a water solution of a reaction product of a high molecular weight organic fatty acid and an alkali or ammonium compound. Preferably, the emulsion additionally comprising etheric oil. This etheric acid may be selected among lavender oil, pine oil, manuka oil, kanuca oil, eucalyptus oil, bergamot oil, clove oil, lemon oil, lemon grass oil, rosemary oil, geranium oil.<br>
It is in the scope of the present invention wherein the concentration of the tea tree oil is between 0.01% up to 10%, and preferably between 0.1% to 1.5%. It is also in the scope of the present invention wherein the concentration of the tea tree oil is between 0.1% to 1.5%, wherein the concentration of the emulsifier is 0.1% to 1% and further wherein the remainder being water.<br>
It is also in the scope of the present invention wherein the alkali and ammonium compounds are selected among sodium, potassium and/or ammonium hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates or any mixture thereof. Preferably, the concentration of the additional etheric oils is between 0.01% to 5%.<br>
It is still in the scope of the present invention wherein the acid is selected among; (a) tall oil acids, naftenic acids, rosin acids and any mixture thereof; (b) saturated fatty acid selected among lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearicacid, arahinoic acid, behenic acid, lingocerinicacd or any mixture thereof; and, (c) unsaturated fatty acids selected among decenoic acid, dodecenoic acid, palamitinoleic acid, oleic acid, lonoleic acid, undecelenic acid, sorbic acid, recinoleic acid or any mixture thereof.<br>

Foliar applications of the TTO compositions to field-grown grapevines and melons inhibit downy and powdery mildews development, respectively. The inhibitory effectiveness of TTO compositions makes it well suited for integration into control programs targeted against various diseases in agricultural organic-grown corps and as a replacement of sulfur and/or cupper containing pesticides.<br>
The experiments were performed by one of the following methods:<br>

Spore germination test of downy mildews late Wight, Alternate and mst pathogens<br>
Sporangial suspensions were mixed with various concentrations of TTO, which ranges from 0 to about \%t and 0.1 mL droplets were transferred to depression glass slides (4 slides per each concentration). Slides were incubated in moist Petri dishes at 20DC in darkness for about 8 hours. The percentage of sporangia releasing zoospores and of zoospores producing germ tubes were counted under the microscope.<br>
Effect of germination of conidia of powdery mildews pathogens<br>
TTO was dissolved and admixed with sterile distilled water to give a stock solution of a known concentration. TTO was admixed with pre-autoclaved 1% water agar to give final concentrations of 0%, 0-001%, 0.01%, 0.1% and 1%. Conidia were shaken onto glass slides previously coated with water agai containing TTO. Slides were placed in Petri dishes containing wet filter paper and kept in the dark at 20°C for about 16 hours. The number of germinated conidia was counted under a microscope.<br>
In vitro activity of mycelia growth of fungi<br>
3 mm diameter agar disks bearing the tested fungus were taken from freshly growing colony on potato dextrose agar, 39 g of JDifco in 1 liter of distilled water, and placed on freshly amended with various concentrations of TTO in 9 cm diameter Petri dishes. Plates were incubated at 25°C for about 6 days k the dark, and the colony diameter was recorded every two days. Three Petri dishes, each containing three inoculum disks, were used for each treatment concentration. Experimented were carried on in duplicates.<br>
In viva {inptantii) experiments<br>
Plants were sprayed with TTO at various concentrations ranges from 0 to 2% on both surfaces, and 24 hours later were inoculated on the lower surface with sporangia! suspension of Plasmopara viticula (grape downy mildew). The lower surface of each of six to eight attached leaves on each of six plants of each treatment was uniformly sprayed with 2 mL of a sporangial suspension of 4xl04 sporangia per mL, delivered from a glass chromatography sprayer. After inoculation, plants were covered with plastic gages, lightly sprayed on the inside with water, and were incubated at 19°C for about 20 hours in<br>

darkness. The plants were then uncovered and kept in a growth chamber for disease development. 9 days after inoculation, disease developed on each leaf of treated plant was evaluated. In some cases, plants were lightly sprayed with water, covered with plastic bags and incubated at 19°C for 24 hours in darkness, to induce sporulation to determine sporangial production. Leaves are bleached and the percent leaf area covered with sporangiophores and sporangia of P. viticula sere visually estimated and recorded. The number of sporangia produced per square centimeter of leaf tissue was calculated as<br>
Powdery mildew inoculations<br>
