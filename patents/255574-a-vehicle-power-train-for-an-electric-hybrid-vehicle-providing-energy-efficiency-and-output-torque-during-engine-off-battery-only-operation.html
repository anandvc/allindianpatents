INPUT BRAKE PROVIDING ELECTRIC ONLY FIXED GEAR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention pertains generally to electric hybrid motor vehicles<br>
having an engine driving an input member of an electrically variable transmission (EVT)<br>
and, more particularly, to an EVT having a selectively operable torque transmitting<br>
device or input brake configured to restrain or mechanically ground the rotation of the<br>
input member when the vehicle is operating in an engine off, battery only propulsion<br>
mode thereby providing a reaction torque enabling the motor/generators to be used with<br>
improved electrical power to mechanical power conversion efficiency for electric<br>
propulsion or regenerative braking.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Internal combustion engines power the majority of motor vehicles. Such<br>
engines are typically powered by the combustion of refined oil products such as diesel<br>
fuel or gasoline. The dependence on oil for energy and transportation, together with the<br>
desire to produce a more fuel efficient vehicle have lead to the development of hybrid<br>
vehicles. In the current art, hybrid vehicles are generally equipped with an electrically<br>
variable transmission (EVT). EVTs generally have an input shaft driven by the vehicle<br>
engine and an output shaft driving or being driven by the vehicle powertrain between<br>
the EVT output shaft and the vehicle's driven wheels. Connecting the input and output<br>
shafts within the EVT is a gear train having one or more differential gear sets which are<br>
selectively controllable to provide a plurality of EVT transmission operating modes.<br>
EVTs are equipped with two or more electric motor/generators, the motor/generators<br>
are adapted to provide power to or receive power from the differential gear sets. The<br>
motor/generators are connected to a storage battery or batteries in the vehicle and are<br>
adapted to receive power from the batteries to power the vehicle (for example, electric<br>
only propulsion with the vehicle engine off) or to provide power to the batteries from<br>
the drive train (example, when slowing the vehicle through regenerative braking).<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
2<br>
Examples of suitable storage batteries include lead acid batteries, nickel-metal hydride<br>
(NiMH) batteries and lithium ion (Li-Ion) batteries. The motor/generators can<br>
transform electrical power from the battery into mechanical power at different torques<br>
and speeds to drive the vehicle powertrain or driveably assist the engine during vehicle<br>
acceleration for example. Each motor/generator is operatively connected to the<br>
differential gear sets of the EVT gear train to provide a range of transmission operation<br>
characterized by continuously controllably variable speeds between the input and output<br>
shafts of the EVT. EVTs may also incorporate one or more fixed gears which arc<br>
characterized by a fixed speed and torque relationship between input and output. Hybrid<br>
equipped vehicles with electrically variable transmissions are operable in several modes<br>
including modes for electric only vehicle drive (engine power off). The inclusion of the<br>
electric drive capability in the EVT allows the vehicle engine to be shut off under<br>
conditions where it is lightly loaded and inefficient, thereby providing better fuel<br>
economy and reduced emissions.<br>
[0003]	Modern electrically variable transmissions are generally of the power<br>
split transmission type, utilizing differential gearing to achieve continuously variable<br>
torque and speed ratios between the EVT input and output. The power split EVT<br>
transmission can utilize differential gearing to send a portion of its transmitted power<br>
through a pair of motor/generators, the remainder of the stick diagraming through a<br>
parallel directly geared path or gear train.<br>
[0004]	One form of differential gearing known to those skilled in the art is the<br>
planetary gear set. Planetary gear sets consist of a sun gear meshed with and orbited by<br>
one or more planetary gears, the planetary gears meshed with a ring gear. Such a<br>
combination provides the benefits of compactness and different torque and speed ratios<br>
among the members of the gear set. Differential gear sets can be built, without using<br>
planetary gear sets, for example by using bevel gears and other gears in an arrangement<br>
where the rotation speed of one gear is always a weighted average of the speeds of the<br>
other two gear members.<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
[0005]	Hybrid electric vehicles include one or more electric energy storage<br>
devices. The typical electric energy device is a chemical storage battery. The storage<br>
battery permits the power output from the transmission to vary from the power output<br>
of the engine to the transmission, with the battery and motor/generators making up the<br>
difference or regeneratively storing the excess as in the case of regenerative vehicle<br>
braking. A control unit regulates the stick diagram between the motor/generators and<br>
the energy storage device as well as regulating power between the first and second<br>
motor/generators.<br>
[0006]	One type of EVT is the 2 mode input-compound split type, which<br>
contains a first mode input split and a second mode compound split. Operation in first<br>
or second variable-speed-ratio modes of operation may be selectively achieved by using<br>
torque transfer devices such as friction clutches for example. In the first mode, an input<br>
power split ratio is formed by the application of a first clutch and the output speed of<br>
the transmission is proportional to the speed of one motor/generator. In a second<br>
mode, a compound power split ratio range is achieved by the application of a second<br>
clutch and the output speed of the transmission is not proportional to the speed of either<br>
motor/generator but is instead proportional to the linear algebraic combination of the<br>
speeds of the two motor/generators. EVT operation at a fixed speed ratio may be<br>
obtained by operation of both of the clutches.<br>
[0007]	An EVT may be operated purely in an electrical only drive mode<br>
wherein the engine is in an off condition or mechanically disconnected from the EVT<br>
input member.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008]	A selectively operable torque transmitting device or input brake is<br>
provided that can either be incorporated directly into or provided externally to an EVT.<br>
The selectively operable torque transmitting device locks the rotation of the EVT input<br>
member to a mechanical ground such as the EVT housing to selectively restrain or<br>
prevent the rotation of the input member when the vehicle is operating in an engine off,<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
4<br>
battery only propulsion mode. By restraining the rotation of the EVT input member, the<br>
torque transmitting device changes the mechanical configuration of the EVT's electric<br>
power-split hybrid powertrain to improve the electromechanical drive operation and<br>
efficiency of the vehicle in using electrical energy supplied from the stored electrical<br>
energy source of the vehicle.<br>
[0009]	The disclosed invention is advantageously adapted for use with hybrid<br>
vehicles having storage batteries configured to be charged from an electrical utility<br>
power grid, for example, when the vehicle is parked overnight. By providing the<br>
vehicle with batteries having the capacity and configuration to receive and store<br>
electrical energy from the electric utility grid, the hybrid vehicle is then usable for an<br>
extended range on electric only power (i.e. with the vehicle engine off) resulting in<br>
increase fuel savings. Specifically, the electrical energy supplied by the utility to charge<br>
the vehicle batteries can be utilized with higher efficiency when propelling the vehicle<br>
using the EVT's electric motors only (engine off) and thereby achieve greater driving<br>
range from the stored energy, if a torque transmitting device is applied to selectively<br>
ground or prevent the rotation of the EVT input member. The torque transmitting<br>
device is controllably operable to ground rotation of the EVT input member, thereby<br>
changing the mechanical configuration of the power-split transmission to a fixed gear<br>
ratio between one or both EVT motors and the output member of the transmission and<br>
eliminating power circulation and drive inefficiencies as discussed below.<br>
[0010]	The torque transmitting device operable to ground rotation of the EVT<br>
input member may also be applied to improve the efficiency of the usage of stored<br>
electric power by the EVT motors when reversing the vehicle in an electric only mode.<br>
The efficiency is realized by providing a reaction torque at the EVT input member so<br>
that the motor/generators can develop torque against the locked input shaft, eliminating<br>
the need for one of the electric motors to rotate or motor the vehicle engine while<br>
developing reaction torque for the other motor/generator.<br>
[0011]	Exemplary devices for selectively locking the rotation of the EVT input<br>
member to ground include an electromagnetic clutch configured to selectively lock the<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
5<br>
EVT input member and a hydraulically actuated disk brake configured to selectively<br>
lock the EVT input member, as well as various known types of wet or dry friction<br>
clutches.<br>
[0012]	The above features and advantages as well as other features and<br>
advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent from the following detailed<br>
description of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection<br>
with the accompanying drawings.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0017]	Referring to the drawings wherein like characters represent the same or<br>
corresponding parts throughout the several views, there is shown in Figure 1 a<br>
schematic stick diagram representation of a two mode input/compound split, electrically<br>
variable transmission (EVT) 10 for a hybrid motor vehicle (not shown) equipped with<br>
an input torque transfer device consisting of an input brake 12 and/or one way clutch 66<br>
in accordance with the disclosed invention. It should be appreciated that the illustrated<br>
electrically variable transmission is just one specific embodiment of a two mode<br>
input/compound split EVT with which the input brake 12 and/or one-way clutch 66<br>
may be advantageously applied. In all embodiments disclosed and illustrated herein, it<br>
is to be understood that the input torque transfer device may comprise either the input<br>
brake 12 or one-way clutch 66, or both the input brake 12 and one-way clutch 66 in<br>
combination. The one way clutch 66 permits the input member 14 to rotate in a positive<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
7<br>
direction as normally driven by the engine 80 while preventing the input member 14<br>
from rotating in a negative direction. The input brake 12 to ground 58 is selectively<br>
operable by the control unit 86 to resist rotation of the input member 14 by frictionally<br>
braking the input member 14 to ground 58. These features pertain to all descriptions<br>
and illustrations of various embodiments presented herein.<br>
[0018]	The EVT 10 includes an input member 14 through which mechanical<br>
rotary power is delivered to the EVT from a mechanical power source such as a<br>
gasoline or diesel engine (not shown). The input member 14, in some embodiments,<br>
may comprise a driven shaft mechanically connecting the input member 14 to the<br>
engine.<br>
[0019]	The electrically variable transmission illustrated in Figure 1 utilizes three<br>
differential gear sets 16, 18 and 20, each having a first gear member, a second gear<br>
member and a third gear member. The differential gear sets 16, 18 and 20 are<br>
preferably planetary gear sets 16, 18 and 20. The first planetary gear set 16 employs an<br>
outer gear member 22, typically designated as the ring gear. The ring gear 22<br>
circumscribes an inner gear member 24, typically designated as the sun gear. A carrier<br>
26 rotatably supports a plurality of planet gears 28 such that each planet gear 28<br>
meshingly engages both the outer, ring gear member 22 and the inner, sun gear<br>
member 24 of the first planetary gear set 16. The input member 14 is secured to the<br>
ring gear member 22 of the planetary gear set 16.<br>
[0020]	The planetary gear set 18 also has an outer gear member 30, often<br>
designated as the ring gear, that circumscribes an inner gear member 31, often<br>
designated as the sun gear. A plurality of planet gears 34 are also rotatably mounted in<br>
a carrier 32 such that each planet gear member 34 simultaneously, and meshingly,<br>
engages both the outer, ring gear member 30 and the inner, sun gear member 31 of the<br>
planetary gear set 18.<br>
[0021]	The planetary gear set 20 also has an outer gear member 36, also<br>
designated as the ring gear, that circumscribes an inner gear member 38, often<br>
designated as the sun gear. A plurality of planet gears 42 are also rotatably mounted in<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
8<br>
a carrier 40 such that each planet gear member 42 simultaneously, and meshingly,<br>
engages both the outer, ring gear member 36 and the inner, sun gear member 38 of the<br>
planetary gear set 20.<br>
[0022]	A first interconnecting member 44 continuously connects the sun gear 24<br>
of the planetary gear set 16 with the ring gear 30 of the planetary gear set 18. The first<br>
gear set 16 and the second gear set 18 are compounded by a second interconnecting<br>
member 46 continuously connecting the carrier 26 of the planetary gear set 16 with the<br>
carrier 32 of the planetary gear set 18. A third interconnecting member 48 continuously<br>
connects the sun gear 31 of the planetary gear set 18 with the sun gear 38 of the<br>
planetary gear set 20.<br>
[0023]	The EVT 10 also includes electric motor/generator 'A' 50 and electric<br>
motor/generator 'B' 52. The stator of the first motor/generator 50 is secured to the<br>
transmission housing (not shown). The rotor of the first motor/generator 50 is secured<br>
to the first interconnecting member 44.<br>
[0024]	The stator of the second motor/generator 52 is also secured to the<br>
transmission housing (not shown). The rotor of the second motor/generator 52 is<br>
secured to the third interconnecting member 48.<br>
[0025]	A first torque transfer device, such as a clutch 54, selectively connects<br>
the ring gear 30 of the planetary gear set 18 to the sun gear 31 of the planetary gear set<br>
18, thereby mechanically locking the rotation of the sun gear 31, planetary gears 34,<br>
carrier 32 and ring gear 30 to rotate together with the same rotational speed.<br>
[0026]	A second torque transfer device, such as brake 56, selectively connects<br>
the sun gear 31 of the planetary gear set 18 with the ground 58, such as the<br>
transmission housing. Activating or engaging the clutch 56 locks or grounds the sun<br>
gear 31 of planetary gear set 18 and the rotor 70 of motor/generator 52 to ground.<br>
[0027]	A third torque transfer device, such as brake 60, selectively connects the<br>
ring gear 36 of the planetary gear set 20 with the ground 58, such as the transmission<br>
housing. That is, the ring gear 36 is selectively secured against rotation by an operative<br>
connection to the non-rotatable ground 58.<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
9<br>
[0028]	The first, second and third torque transfer devices 54, 56 and 60 are<br>
employed to assist in the selection of the operational modes of the hybrid EVT<br>
transmission 10, as will be hereinafter more fully explained at least as pertains to the<br>
electric only engine off EVT operation modes pertinent to the present invention.<br>
[0029]	The output drive member 62 of the EVT 10 is secured to the carrier 40<br>
of the planetary gear set 20.<br>
[0030]	A fourth torque transfer device, such as clutch 64, selectively connects<br>
the second interconnecting member 46 to the output member 62.<br>
[0031]	The first, second, third and fourth torque transfer devices 54, 56, 60 and<br>
64 are employed to assist in the selection of the operational modes of the hybrid EVT<br>
transmission 10.<br>
[0032]	A control unit 86 regulates the motor speed and torque of<br>
motor/generators 50 and 52. Torque transfer devices 12, 54, 60 and 64 are selectively<br>
controlled by control unit 86 to configure the EVT into various operation modes. The<br>
control unit 86 is electrically interfaced to the electrical energy storage device such as a<br>
battery 88.<br>
[0033]	An input torque transfer device, such as the input brake 12, selectively<br>
locks the EVT input member 14 to the ground, such as the transmission housing. The<br>
input torque transfer device 12 is locked only when the vehicle engine 80 is not<br>
running. By locking the input member 14 against rotation, the EVT 10 is adapted for<br>
efficient operation in one or more battery only fixed gear modes. These modes allow<br>
both motors 50 and 52 to be used with additive power to maximize the utilization of the<br>
designed motor capacity for electric propulsion or regenerative braking, as described<br>
below.<br>
[0034]	The electrically variable transmission 10, as illustrated in Eigure 1, is a<br>
two mode input/compound split EVT having an input split low range and a compound<br>
split high range. Typically, the input split range is used for electric only propulsion<br>
mode (vehicle engine off), however, this results in motor/generator 52 spinning at a<br>
high negative speed. In an EVT transmission without the input brake 12 of the present<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
10<br>
invention, operation at compound split range with the engine 80 at zero speed requires<br>
motor/generator 52 to operate as a generator when motor/generator 50 is operating as a<br>
motor to propel the vehicle or requiring motor/generator 52 to operate as a motor<br>
whenever motor/generator 50 is generating electric power. This interaction between<br>
motor/generators 50 and 52 results in poor energy efficiency and limits the usefulness<br>
of the compound split range for electric only operation. However, if the input member<br>
of the EVT is locked or braked as by torque transfer or input brake device 12, then an<br>
additional torque reaction point is added at the EVT input member node allowing the<br>
torques on motor/generators 50 and 52 to be controlled independently. In this case,<br>
motor/generator 52 can supply power additively to motor/generator 50, eliminating<br>
circulating power and improving efficiency. With the presence of the input torque<br>
transfer device or input brake 12, the compound split range now has high torque<br>
capacity as the torques of motors 50 and 52 are additive through gear ratios to the<br>
output member 62, through two new transmission modes EV1 and EV2 as discussed<br>
more fully below.<br>
[0035]	The clutch states required to actuate the electric drive only EVT<br>
transmission modes together with the use of input brake 12 in enabling these new<br>
modes will now be discussed. As discussed earlier, the addition of the input brake 12 to<br>
the two mode input/compound split EVT provides additional electric only propulsion,<br>
engine off, fixed gear ratio modes of operation of the hybrid vehicle EVT. Two of the<br>
possible electric only propulsion EVT fixed gear ratio modes are presented herein, the<br>
first is the "EV low" (EV1) mode, and the second is the "EV high" (EV2) mode.<br>
Referring again to Figure 1, both modes EV 1 and EV2 require the engine 80 to be in<br>
an off state with the torque transfer device or input brake 12 to be engaged, thereby<br>
grounding the input member 14 to prevent the rotation of input member 14. As<br>
discussed earlier, this provides another torque reaction point to the EVT and, in<br>
particular, lock or inhibits the rotation of ring gear 22 of the planetary gear set 16<br>
(using the specific example of Figure 1). This enforces a fixed gearing ratio between<br>
the rotor of motor/generator 50 through the sun gear 24 and the planetary gears 28.<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
11<br>
[0036]	To enable the "EV low" (EV1) electric only propulsion EVT fixed gear<br>
ratio mode, the following clutches and brake are engaged or locked: brake 60 and<br>
torque transmission device/input brake 12. The remaining torque transfer devices 64,<br>
56 and 54 are disengaged. Brake 60 locks the ring gear 36 of planetary gear set 20 to<br>
ground, thereby enforcing a fixed gear ratio between the rotor 70 of motor/generator 52<br>
and the EVT output member 62. Similarly, the input brake 12 enforces a fixed gear<br>
ratio between the rotor 68 of motor/generator 50 and the rotation of the second<br>
interconnecting member 46 which connects to and drives the planetary gears 34 of the<br>
planetary gear set 18. The rotor 68 of motor/generator 50 also drives the ring gear 30<br>
of planetary gear set 18. As the ring gear 30 and planetary gears 34 are both driven by<br>
motor/generator 50, a fixed gearing ratio is enforced between the rotational speed of<br>
rotor 68 of motor/generator 50 and the rotor 70 of motor/generator 52. As discussed<br>
above, rotor 70 of motor/generator 52 drives the EVT output member 62 at a fixed<br>
gear ratio due to the locked state of brake 60. As can be understood from the above,<br>
motor/generators 50 and 52 are driveably geared by separate fixed ratios to the<br>
transmission output member 62.<br>
[0037]	To enable the "EV high" (EV2) electric only propulsion EVT fixed gear<br>
ratio mode, the following clutches and brakes are engaged or locked: clutch 64 and<br>
torque transmission device/input brake 12 (illustrative element numbers specific to the<br>
EVT embodiment 10 depicted in Figure 1). The remaining torque transfer devices 60,<br>
56 and 54 are disengaged. Clutch 64 locks the rotation of the planetary gears 42 of<br>
planetary gear set 20 to the rotation of the planetary gears 28 of planetary gear set 16.<br>
The input brake 12 enforces a fixed gear ratio between the rotor 68 of motor/generator<br>
50 and the rotation of the second interconnecting member 46 which driveably connects<br>
directly to the output member 62 through engaged clutch 64. Rotor 70 of<br>
motor/generator 52 drives the sun gear 31 of planetary gear set 18. Rotor 68 of<br>
motor/generator 50 drives the ring gear 30 of planetary gear set 18 and also drives the<br>
planetary gears 34 at a fixed gear ratio determined by the planetary gears 28 and sun<br>
gear 24 of the planetary gear set 16. The rotation speed ratio between the ring gear 30<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
12<br>
and the planetary gears 34 being fixed, as just described, enforces a fixed gear ratio<br>
between the rotation speeds of rotors 68 and 70 of motor/generators 50 and 52.<br>
Motor/generator 52 delivers power to output member 62 through the sun gear 31 and<br>
planetary gears 34 of planetary gear set 18. As can be understood from the above,<br>
motor/generators 50 and 52 are driveably geared by separate fixed ratios to the<br>
transmission output member 62.<br>
[0038]	As can be understood from the above discussion, electric drive only EVT<br>
transmission modes EV1 and EV2 permit both motor/generators 50 and 52 to be<br>
operated in motoring mode to produce mechanical power which is additively combined<br>
for electric propulsion, maximizing the designed motor capacity for electric propulsion.<br>
Similarly, modes EV1 and EV2 enable motor/generators 50 and 52 to operate with<br>
additive generating power to maximize utilization of the designed motor capacity for<br>
regenerative braking. These fixed gear additive modes are enabled through the addition<br>
of the input brake 12 which locks the input member 14 providing a torque reaction<br>
point at the EVT input to facilitate these modes as described above. The addition of the<br>
torque transmission device or input brake 12 of the present invention eliminates<br>
circulating power and improves operating and energy efficiency of the EVT in electric<br>
only modes (engine off) thereby yielding measurable benefits in increased efficiency in<br>
electric to mechanical energy conversion and increased available electric drive torque.<br>
[0039]	If the input brake 12 is capable of lockably preventing the rotation of the<br>
input member 14 in both the positive and negative directions, then the hybrid vehicle<br>
EVT system is capable of both motoring and regenerative braking in the EV1 and EV2<br>
modes. The torque transfer device or input brake 12 may be realized as a wet friction<br>
clutch, dry friction clutch, dog clutch, or pawl mechanism as just a few examples. The<br>
input brake 12 may also be implemented as a one way clutch 66 to ground 58, since the<br>
engine 80 is not required to spin in the reverse direction. In this case (without the<br>
input brake 12), the improved efficiency and torque capacity is provided for motoring<br>
torque at the output, but power circulation is still required for braking torque at the<br>
output. Additionally, the input brake 12 may be implemented as a mechanism known as<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
13<br>
a controllable one way clutch with two modes. In the first mode, the mechanism<br>
operates as a conventional one way clutch 66, allowing the engine 80 to free spin as<br>
long as it is in the positive direction. If the speed of the engine 80 reaches zero, the<br>
one way clutch 66 engages, preventing the engine 80 from rotating backwards. In the<br>
second mode, the one way clutch 66 mechanism locks, preventing input member 14<br>
rotation in either direction. The mechanism may be transitioned between modes<br>
whenever the engine 80 speed is zero. This implementation is capable of providing full<br>
functionality for both motoring and regenerative braking.<br>
[0040]	The EVT has several other modes, specifically engine running modes,<br>
which are not discussed herein as these additional modes are known to those skilled in<br>
the art and while important to the functioning of the EVT, are not relevant to the<br>
understanding of the present invention.<br>
[0041]	Turning now to Figure 2 wherein like numbers are used to refer to like<br>
components. Figure 2 is a schematic stick diagram representation of another<br>
embodiment of a two mode input/compound split, electrically variable transmission 72<br>
for a hybrid motor vehicle equipped with an input brake 112 and/or one way clutch 166<br>
in accordance with the disclosed invention. It is to be understood that wherever the<br>
input brake 112 is discussed below, the input brake 112 can be replaced with the one-<br>
way clutch 166 to achieve the EV1 and EV2 electric only drive modes discussed below.<br>
The one-way clutch 166 is operable to lock the input member 14 from rotating in a<br>
counter to normal engine operation direction, thereby locking the input member 14 to<br>
ground when the vehicle is operated in electric only propulsion modes EV1 or EV2. It<br>
should be appreciated that the illustrated electrically variable transmission 72 is just one<br>
specific embodiment of a two mode input/compound split EVT with which the input<br>
brake 112 and/or one-way clutch 166 may be advantageously applied. The one way<br>
clutch 166 permits the input member 14 to rotate in a positive direction as normally<br>
driven by the engine 80 while preventing the input member 14 from rotating in a<br>
negative direction. The input brake 112 to ground 158 is selectively operable by the<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
14<br>
control unit 186 to resist rotation of the input member 14 by frictionally braking the<br>
input member 14 to ground.<br>
[0042]	EVT 72 includes an input member 14 through which mechanical rotary<br>
power is delivered to the EVT 72 from a mechanical power source such as a gasoline<br>
or diesel engine 80. The input member 14, in some embodiments, may comprise a<br>
driven shaft mechanically connecting the input member 14 to the engine 80.<br>
[0043]	The electrically variable transmission as illustrated in Figures 2 utilizes<br>
two differential gear sets, preferably planetary gear sets 116 and 118. The first<br>
planetary gear set 116 employs an outer gear member 122, typically designated as the<br>
ring gear. The ring gear 122 circumscribes an inner gear member 124, typically<br>
designated as the sun gear. In Figure 2 this is a compound planetary gear set. In Figure<br>
2, the planetary gear set 116 has an outer ring gear member 122, that circumscribes an<br>
inner gear member typically designated as a sun gear 124. A plurality of planet gears<br>
127, 128 are also rotatably mounted in a carrier 126 such that each planet gear member<br>
127 meshingly engages the sun gear 124 and each planet gear member 128<br>
simultaneously and meshingly engages the ring gear member 122 of the planetary gear<br>
set 116. The input member 14 is secured to the ring gear member 122 of the planetary<br>
gear set 116.<br>
[0044]	The planetary gear set 118 also has an outer gear member 130, often also<br>
designated as the ring gear, which circumscribes an inner gear member 131, also often<br>
designated as the sun gear. A plurality of planet gears 134 are also rotatably mounted in<br>
a carrier 132 such that each planet gear member 134 simultaneously and meshingly<br>
engages both the outer, ring gear member 130 and the inner, sun gear member 131 of<br>
the planetary gear set 118. In EVT 72 the input member 14 is driveably connected to<br>
the ring gear 122 of planetary gear set 116.<br>
[0045]	A first torque transfer device 154, such as a clutch, selectively connects<br>
the input member 14 to the carrier 126 of planetary gear set 116 thereby mechanically<br>
locking the rotation of the input member 14 and carrier 126, resulting in a fixed gear<br>
ratio between the input member 14 and the rotor 168 of motor/generator 150. The sun<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
15<br>
gear 124 of planetary gear set 116 is continuously connected to the rotor 168 of<br>
motor/generator 150.<br>
[0046]	A second torque transfer device 164, such as a clutch, selectively<br>
connects the rotor 168 of motor/generator 150 to the ring gear 130 of the planetary gear<br>
set 118.<br>
[0047]	A third torque transfer device, such as brake 160, selectively connects<br>
the ring gear 130 of the planetary gear set 118 with the ground 158, such as the<br>
transmission housing. That is, the ring gear 130 is selectively secured against rotation<br>
by an operative connection to the non-rotatable ground 158. The carrier member 132 of<br>
planetary gear set 118 is continuously connected to the output member 62. The sun gear<br>
131 of planetary gear set 118 is continuously connected to the rotor 170 of<br>
motor/generator 152.<br>
[0048]	A fourth torque transfer device 156, such as a brake, selectively connects<br>
the rotor 170 and sun gear 131 to ground 58 preventing their rotation.<br>
[0049]	A control unit 186 regulates the motor speed and torque of<br>
motor/generators 150 and 152. Torque transfer devices 112, 154, 160 and 164 are<br>
selectively controlled by control unit 186 to configure the EVT into various operation<br>
modes. The control unit 186 is electrically interfaced to the electrical energy storage<br>
device such as a battery 188.<br>
[0050]	Similar to the earlier discussion of EVT 10 presented in Figure 1, in<br>
Figures 2 the torque transfer devices 154, 156, 160 and 164 are employed to assist in<br>
the selection of the operational modes of the hybrid EVT transmission 72, as will be<br>
hereinafter more fully explained.<br>
[0051]	Similar to the earlier discussion concerning Figure 1, electrically<br>
variable transmission 72 is a two mode input/compound split EVTs having an input<br>
split low range and a compound split high range. Typically, the input split range is used<br>
for electric only propulsion mode (vehicle engine off), however, this results in<br>
motor/generator 152 spinning at a high negative speed. In an EVT transmission without<br>
the input brake 112 of the present invention, operation at compound split range with the<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
16<br>
engine 80 at zero speed requires motor/generator 152 to operate as a generator when<br>
motor/generator 150 is motoring to propel the vehicle or requiring motor/generator 152<br>
to operate as a motor whenever motor/generator 150 is generating electric power. This<br>
interaction between motor/generators 150 and 152 results in poor efficiency and limits<br>
the usefulness of the compound split range for electric only operation, as discussed<br>
earlier. However, if the input member 14 of EVT 72 is locked or braked as by torque<br>
transfer or input brake device 112, then an additional torque reaction point is added at<br>
the EVT input member 14 allowing the torques on motor/generators 150 and 152 to be<br>
controlled independently. In this case, motor/generator 152 can supply power<br>
additively to motor/generator 150, eliminating circulating power and improving<br>
efficiency. With the presence of the input brake 112, the compound split range now<br>
has high torque capacity as the torques of motors 150 and 152 are additive through gear<br>
ratios to the output 62, through two new modes EV1 and EV2 as discussed below.<br>
[0052]	The clutch states required to actuate the electric drive only HVT<br>
transmission modes enabled together with the use of input brake 112 will now be<br>
discussed. As discussed earlier, the addition of the input brake 112 to the two mode<br>
input/compound split EVT 72 provides additional electric only propulsion, engine off,<br>
fixed gear ratio modes of operation of the hybrid vehicle EVT 72. Two of the possible<br>
electric only propulsion EVT fixed gear ration modes are presented herein, the first is<br>
the "EV low" (EV1) mode, and the second is the "EV high" (EV2) mode. Referring<br>
again to Figure 2, both modes EV1 and EV2 require the engine 80 to be in an off state<br>
with the torque transfer device or input brake 112 to be engaged, thereby grounding the<br>
input member 14 to prevent the rotation of input member 14. As discussed earlier, this<br>
provides another torque reaction point to the EVT 72 and, in particular, lock or inhibits<br>
the rotation of either the ring gear 122 . This enforces a fixed gearing ratio between the<br>
rotor 168 of motor/generator 150 and the input member 14 through the planetary gear<br>
set 116.<br>
[0053]	To enable the "EV low" (EV1) electric only propulsion EVT fixed gear<br>
ratio mode, the following torque transfer devices are engaged or locked: brake 160 and<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
17<br>
torque transmission device/input brake 112. The remaining torque transfer devices 164,<br>
156 and 154 are disengaged. Brake 160 locks the ring gear 130 of planetary gear set<br>
118 to ground 158, thereby enforcing a fixed gear ratio between the rotor 170 of<br>
motor/generator 152 and the EVT output member 62.<br>
[0054]	Similarly, the input brake 112 enforces a fixed gear ratio between the<br>
rotor 168 of motor/generator 150 and the rotation of the sun gear 131 by locking a<br>
member of the planetary gear set 116 to ground 158. In Figure 2 EVT 72, input brake<br>
112 locks ring gear 122 to ground 158. In this configuration, motor/generator 150<br>
drives the sun gear 131 through planetary gear set 116 at a fixed gear ratio.<br>
Motor/generator 152 also drives sun gear 131. Both 150 and 152 then drive the output<br>
member 62 at a fixed gear ratio through planetary gear set 118. As can be understood<br>
from the above, motor/generators 150 and 152 are driveably geared by separate fixed<br>
ratios to the transmission output member 62.<br>
[0055]	To enable the "EV high" (EV2) electric only propulsion EVT fixed gear<br>
ratio mode, the following torque transfer devices are engaged or locked: clutch 164 and<br>
torque transmission device/input brake 112. The remaining torque transfer devices 160,<br>
156 and 154 are disengaged. Clutch 164 locks the rotation of the rotor 168 of<br>
motor/generator 150 to the ring gear 130 of planetary gear set 118. As discussed<br>
above, input brake 112 enforces a fixed gear ratio between the rotor 168 of<br>
motor/generator 150 and the rotation of the sun gear 131 by locking a member of the<br>
planetary gear set 116 to ground 158. The rotation speed ratio between the rotor 168 of<br>
motor/generator 150 and the rotor 170 of motor/generator 152 is a fixed value due to<br>
the locking action of input brake 112 on planetary gear set 116 as described above.<br>
Motor/generator 152 delivers power to output member 62 through the sun gear 131 and<br>
planetary gears 134 of planetary gear set 118. Motor/generator 150 delivers power to<br>
output member 62 through the ring gear 130 and planetary gears 134 of planetary gear<br>
set 118, providing an output speed proportional to the speed of the two<br>
motor/generators 150 and 152.<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
18<br>
[0056]	As discussed earlier with Figure 1, electric drive only EVT transmission<br>
modes EV1 and EV2 permit both motor/generators 150 and 152 to be operated in<br>
motoring mode to produce mechanical power which is additively combined or electric<br>
propulsion, maximizing the designed motor capacity for electric propulsion. Similarly,<br>
modes EV1 and EV2 enable motor/generators 150 and 152 to operate with additive<br>
generating power to maximize utilization of the designed motor capacity for<br>
regenerative braking. These fixed gear additive modes are enabled through the addition<br>
of the input brake device 112 which locks the input member 14 to facilitate these modes<br>
as described above. The addition of the torque transmission device or input brake 112<br>
of the present invention eliminates circulating power and improves operating and<br>
energy efficiency of the EVT 72 in electric only modes (engine off) as described above.<br>
[0057]	EVT 72 has several 'engine on' modes which are not discussed herein as<br>
these additional modes are known to those skilled in the art and are not essential or<br>
relevant to the understanding of the present invention which is directed to engine off<br>
electric only EVT operation.<br>
[0058]	Turning now to Figures 3 wherein like numbers are used to refer to like<br>
components. Figure 3 is a schematic stick diagram representation of an alternate<br>
version of the EVT 72 illustrated and discussed earlier with in Figure 2. In Figure 3,<br>
electrically variable transmission 74 for a hybrid motor vehicle is equipped with an<br>
input brake 212 and/or one way clutch 266 in accordance with the disclosed invention.<br>
It is to be understood that wherever the input brake 212 is discussed below, the input<br>
brake 212 can be replaced with the one-way clutch 266 to achieve the EV1 and EV2<br>
electric only drive modes discussed below. The one-way clutch 266 is operable to lock<br>
the input member 14 from rotating in a counter to normal engine operation direction,<br>
thereby locking the input member 14 to ground when the vehicle is operated in electric<br>
only propulsion modes EV1 or EV2. It should be appreciated that the illustrated<br>
electrically variable transmission 74 is just one specific embodiment of a two mode<br>
input/compound split EVT with which the input brake 212 and/or one-way clutch 266<br>
may be advantageously applied. The one way clutch 266 permits the input member 14<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
19<br>
to rotate in a positive direction as normally driven by the engine 80 while preventing<br>
the input member 14 from rotating in a negative direction. The input brake 212 to<br>
ground 258 is selectively operable by the control unit 286 to resist rotation of the input<br>
member 14 by frictionally braking the input member 14 to ground.<br>
[0059]	EVT 74 includes an input member 14 through which mechanical rotary<br>
power is delivered to the EVT 74 from a mechanical power source such as a gasoline<br>
or diesel engine 80. The input member 14, in some embodiments, may comprise a<br>
driven shaft mechanically connecting the input member 14 to the engine 80.<br>
[0060]	The electrically variable transmission as illustrated in Figures 3 utilize<br>
two differential gear sets, preferably planetary gear sets 216 and 218. The first<br>
planetary gear set 216 employs an outer gear member 222, typically designated as the<br>
ring gear. The ring gear 222 circumscribes an inner gear member 224, typically<br>
designated as the sun gear. In Figure 3, this is a simple planetary gear set, while in<br>
previously discussed Figure 2 this was a compound planetary gearset. In Figure 3, a<br>
carrier 226 rotatably supports a plurality of planet gears 228 such that each planet gear<br>
228 meshingly engages both the outer, ring gear member 222 and the inner, sun gear<br>
member 224 of the first planetary gear set 216. The input member 14 is secured to the<br>
carrier 226 of the planetary gear set 216.<br>
[0061]	The planetary gear set 218 also has an outer gear member 230, often also<br>
designated as the ring gear, which circumscribes an inner gear member 231, also often<br>
designated as the sun gear. A plurality of planet gears 234 are also rotatably mounted in<br>
a carrier 232 such that each planet gear member 234 simultaneously and meshingly<br>
engages both the outer, ring gear member 230 and the inner, sun gear member 231 of<br>
the planetary gear set 218.<br>
[0062]	Previously discussed EVT 72 (Figure 2) and EVT 74 differs in where<br>
mechanical power from input member 14 is delivered to the planetary gear set 216 (116<br>
in Figure 2). In EVT 72 the input member 14 is driveably connected to the ring gear<br>
122 of planetary gear set 116. In Figure 3, EVT 74, the input member 14 is driveably<br>
connected to the carrier 226 of planetary gear set 216.<br><br>

[0063]	A first torque transfer device 254 , such as a clutch, selectively connects<br>
the input member 14 to the carrier 226 of planetary gear set 216 thereby mechanically<br>
locking the rotation of the input member 14 and carrier 226, resulting in a fixed gear<br>
ratio between the input member 14 and the rotor 268 of motor/generator 250. The sun<br>
gear 224 of planetary gear set 216 is continuously connected to the rotor 268 of<br>
motor/generator 250.<br>
[0064]	A second torque transfer device 264, such as a clutch, selectively<br>
connects the rotor 268 of motor/generator 250 to the ring gear 230 of the planetary gear<br>
set 218.<br>
[0065]	A third torque transfer device, such as brake 260, selectively connects<br>
the ring gear 230 of the planetary gear set 218 with the ground 258, such as the<br>
transmission housing. That is, the ring gear 230 is selectively secured against rotation<br>
by an operative connection to the non-rotatable ground 258. The carrier 232 of<br>
planetary gear set 218 is continuously connected to the output member 62. The sun gear<br>
231 of planetary gear set 218 is continuously connected to the rotor 270 of<br>
motor/generator 252.<br>
[0066]	A fourth torque transfer device 256, such as a brake, selectively connects<br>
the rotor 270 and sun gear 231 to ground 258 preventing their rotation.<br>
[0067]	A control unit 286 regulates the motor speed and torque of<br>
motor/generators 250 and 252. Torque transfer devices 212, 254, 260 and 264 are<br>
selectively controlled by control unit 286 to configure the EVT into various operation<br>
modes. The control unit 286 is electrically interfaced to the electrical energy storage<br>
device such as a battery 288.<br>
[0068]	Similar to the earlier discussion of EVT 72 presented in Figure 2, in<br>
Figure 3 torque transfer devices 254, 256, 260 and 264 are employed to assist in the<br>
selection of the operational modes of the hybrid EVT transmission 74, as will be<br>
hereinafter more fully explained.<br>
[0069]	Similar to the earlier discussion concerning Figure 2, electrically<br>
variable transmission 74 is a two mode input/compound split EVTs having an input<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
21<br>
split low range and a compound split high range. Typically, the input split range is used<br>
for electric only propulsion mode (vehicle engine off), however, this results in<br>
motor/generator 252 spinning at a high negative speed. In an EVT transmission without<br>
the input brake 212 of the present invention, operation at compound split range with the<br>
engine 80 at zero speed requires motor/generator 252 to operate as a generator when<br>
motor/generator 250 is motoring to propel the vehicle or requiring motor/generator 252<br>
to operate as a motor whenever motor/generator 250 is generating electric power. This<br>
interaction between motor/generators 250 and 252 results in poor efficiency and limits<br>
the usefulness of the compound split range for electric only operation, as discussed<br>
earlier. However, if the input member 14 of EVT 74 is locked or braked as by torque<br>
transfer or input brake device 212, then an additional torque reaction point is added at<br>
the EVT input member 14 allowing the torques on motor/generators 250 and 252 to be<br>
controlled independently. In this case, motor/generator 252 can supply power<br>
additively to motor/generator 250, eliminating circulating power and improving<br>
efficiency. With the presence of the input brake 212, the compound split range now<br>
has high torque capacity as the torques of motors 250 and 252 are additive through gear<br>
ratios to the output 62, through two new modes EV1 and EV2 as discussed below.<br>
[0070]	The clutch states required to actuate the electric drive only EVT<br>
transmission modes enabled together with the use of input brake 212 will now be<br>
discussed. As discussed earlier, the addition of the input brake 212 to the two mode<br>
input/compound split EVT 74 provides additional electric only propulsion, engine off,<br>
fixed gear ratio modes of operation of the hybrid vehicle EVT 74. Two of the possible<br>
electric only propulsion EVT fixed gear ration modes are presented herein, the first is<br>
the "EV low" (EV1) mode, and the second is the "EV high" (EV2) mode. Referring<br>
again to Figure 3, both modes EV1 and EV2 require the engine 80 to be in an off state<br>
with the torque transfer device or input brake 212 to be engaged, thereby grounding the<br>
input member 14 to prevent the rotation of input member 14. As discussed earlier, this<br>
provides another torque reaction point to the EVT 74 and, in particular, lock or inhibits<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
22<br>
the rotation of the carrier 226. This enforces a fixed gearing ratio between the rotor 268<br>
of motor/generator 250 and the input member 14 through the planetary gear set 216.<br>
[0071]	To enable the "EV low" (EV1) electric only propulsion EVT fixed gear<br>
ratio mode, the following clutches and brake are engaged or locked: brake 260 and<br>
torque transmission device/input brake 212. The remaining torque transfer devices 264,<br>
256 and 254 are disengaged. Brake 260 locks the ring gear 230 of planetary gear set<br>
218 to ground 258, thereby enforcing a fixed gear ratio between the rotor 270 of<br>
motor/generator 252 and the EVT output member 62.<br>
[0072]	Similarly, the input brake 212 enforces a fixed gear ratio between the<br>
rotor 268 of motor/generator 250 and the rotation of the sun gear 231 by locking a<br>
member of the planetary gear set 216 to ground 258. In Figure 3, HVT 74, input brake<br>
212 locks carrier 226 to ground 258. In this configuration, motor/generator 250 drives<br>
the sun gear 231 through planetary gear set 216 at a fixed gear ratio. Motor/generator<br>
252 also drives sun gear 231. Both motor/generators 250 and 252 then drive the output<br>
member 62 at a fixed gear ratio through planetary gear set 218. As can be understood<br>
from the above, motor/generators 250 and 252 are driveably geared by separate fixed<br>
ratios to the transmission output member 62.<br>
[0073]	To enable the "EV high" (EV2) electric only propulsion EVT fixed gear<br>
ratio mode, the following clutches and brakes are engaged or locked: clutch 264 and<br>
torque transmission device/input brake 212. The remaining torque transfer devices 260,<br>
256 and 254 are disengaged. Clutch 264 locks the rotation of the rotor 268 of<br>
motor/generator 250 to the ring gear 230 of planetary gear set 218. As discussed<br>
above, input brake 212 enforces a fixed gear ratio between the rotor 268 of<br>
motor/generator 250 and the rotation of the sun gear 231 by locking a member of the<br>
planetary gear set 216 to ground 258. The rotation speed ratio between the rotor 268 of<br>
motor/generator 250 and the rotor 270 of motor/generator 252 is a fixed value due to<br>
the locking action of input brake 212 on planetary gear set 216 as described above.<br>
Motor/generator 252 delivers power to output member 62 through the sun gear 231 and<br>
planetary gears 234 of planetary gear set 218. Motor/generator 250 delivers power to<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
23<br>
output member 62 through the ring gear 230 and planetary gears 234 of planetary gear<br>
set 218, providing an output speed proportional to the speed of the two<br>
motor/generators 250 and 252.<br>
[0074]	As discussed earlier with Figures 1 and 2, electric drive only EVT<br>
transmission modes EV1 and EV2 permit both motor/generators 250 and 252 to be<br>
operated in motoring mode to produce mechanical power which is additively combined<br>
or electric propulsion, maximizing the designed motor capacity for electric propulsion.<br>
Similarly, modes EV1 and EV2 enable motor/generators 250 and 252 to operate with<br>
additive generating power to maximize utilization of the designed motor capacity for<br>
regenerative braking. These fixed gear additive modes are enabled through the addition<br>
of the input brake device 212 which locks the input member 14 to facilitate these modes<br>
as described above. The addition of the torque transmission device or input brake 212<br>
of the present invention eliminates circulating power and improves operating and<br>
energy efficiency of the EVT 72 or 74 in electric only modes (engine off) as described<br>
above.<br>
[0075]	EVT 74 has several 'engine on' modes which are not discussed herein as<br>
these additional modes are known to those skilled in the art and are not essential or<br>
relevant to the understanding of the present invention which is directed to engine off<br>
electric only EVT operation.<br>
[0076]	Turning now to Figure 4 wherein like numbers are used to refer to like<br>
components. Figure 4 is a schematic stick diagram representation of another<br>
embodiment of a two mode input/compound split, electrically variable transmission 78<br>
for a hybrid motor vehicle equipped with an input brake 312 and/or one way clutch 366<br>
in accordance with the disclosed invention. It is to be understood that wherever the<br>
input brake 312 is discussed below, the input brake 312 can be replaced with the one-<br>
way clutch 366 to achieve the EV1 and EV2 electric only drive modes discussed below.<br>
The one-way clutch 366 is operable to lock the input member 14 from rotating in a<br>
counter to normal engine operation direction, thereby locking the input member 14 to<br>
ground when the vehicle is operated in electric only propulsion modes EV1 or EV2. It<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
24<br>
should be appreciated that the illustrated electrically variable transmission 78 is just one<br>
specific embodiment of a two mode input/compound split EVT with which the input<br>
brake 312 and/or one-way clutch 366 may be advantageously applied. The one way<br>
clutch 366 permits the input member 14 to rotate in a positive direction as normally<br>
driven by the engine 80 while preventing the input member 14 from rotating in a<br>
negative direction. The input brake 312 to ground 358 is selectively operable by the<br>
control unit 386 to resist rotation of the input member 14 by frictionally braking the<br>
input member 14 to ground.<br>
[0077]	The EVT 78 includes an input member 14 through which mechanical<br>
rotary power is delivered to the EVT 78 from a mechanical power source such as a<br>
gasoline or diesel engine 80. The input member 14, in some embodiments, may<br>
comprise a driven shaft mechanically connecting the input member 14 to the engine 80.<br>
[0078]	The electrically variable transmission as illustrated in Figures 4 utilizes<br>
two differential gear sets, preferably planetary gear sets 316 and 318. The first<br>
planetary gear set 316 employs an outer gear member 322, typically designated as the<br>
ring gear. The ring gear 322 circumscribes an inner gear member 324, typically<br>
designated as the sun gear. A carrier 326 rotatably supports a plurality of planet gears<br>
328 such that each planet gear 328 meshingly engages both the outer, ring gear member<br>
322 and the inner, sun gear member 324 of the first planetary gear set 316. The input<br>
member 14 is secured to the ring gear member 322 of the planetary gear set 316.<br>
[0079]	The planetary gear set 318 also has an outer gear member 330, often also<br>
designated as the ring gear, which circumscribes an inner gear member 331, also often<br>
designated as the sun gear. A plurality of planet gears 334 are also rotatably mounted in<br>
a carrier 332 such that each planet gear member 334 simultaneously and meshingly<br>
engages both the outer, ring gear member 330 and the inner, sun gear member 331 of<br>
the planetary gear set 318.<br>
[0080]	The input member 14 is drivably connected to the ring gear 322 of the<br>
planetary gear set 316 thereby mechanically locking the rotation of the input member 14<br>
and ring gear 316. The sun gear 324 of planetary gear set 316 is continuously<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
25<br>
connected to the rotor 368 of motor/generator 350. The carrier 326 of planetary gear<br>
set 316 is continuously connected to the carrier 332 of planetary gear set 328, both<br>
carriers 326 and 332 are also continuously drivably connected to the output member 62<br>
of the EVT. The sun gear 331 of planetary gear set 318 is continuously connected to<br>
the rotor 370 of motor/generator 352.<br>
[0081]	A first torque transfer device 364, such as a clutch, selectively connects<br>
the rotor 368 of motor/generator 350 to the ring gear 330 of the planetary gear set 318.<br>
A second torque transfer device, such as brake 360, selectively connects the ring gear<br>
330 of the planetary gear set 318 with the ground 358, such as the transmission<br>
housing. That is, the ring gear 330 is selectively secured against rotation by an<br>
operative connection to the non-rotatable ground 358. The carrier 332 of planetary gear<br>
set 318 is continuously connected to the output member 62.<br>
[0082]	A control unit 386 regulates the motor speed and torque of<br>
motor/generators 350 and 352. Torque transfer devices 312, 354, 360 and 364 are<br>
selectively controlled by control unit 386 to configure the EVT into various operation<br>
modes. The control unit 386 is electrically interfaced to the electrical energy storage<br>
device such as a battery 388.<br>
[0083]	Similar to the earlier discussion of EVT 10 presented in Figure 1, in<br>
Figure 4 torque transfer devices 360 and 354 together with input brake/torque transfer<br>
device 312 are employed to assist in the selection of the engine-off battery-only<br>
operational modes of the hybrid EVT transmission 78, as will be hereinafter more fully<br>
explained.<br>
[0084]	Similar to the earlier discussion concerning Figure 1, electrically<br>
variable transmission 78 is of the two mode input/compound split EVT having an input<br>
split low range and a compound split high range. Typically, the input split range is used<br>
for electric only propulsion mode (vehicle engine off), however, this results in<br>
motor/generator 352 spinning at a high negative speed. In an EVT transmission without<br>
the input brake 312 of the present invention, operation at compound split range with the<br>
engine 80 at zero speed requires motor/generator 352 to operate as a generator when<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
26<br>
motor/generator 350 is motoring to propel the vehicle or requiring motor/generator 352<br>
to operate as a motor whenever motor/generator 350 is generating electric power. This<br>
interaction between motor/generators 350 and 352 results in poor efficiency and limits<br>
the usefulness of the compound split range for electric only operation, as discussed<br>
earlier. However, if the input member 14 of EVT 78 is locked or braked as by torque<br>
transfer or input brake device 312, then an additional torque reaction point is added at<br>
the EVT input member 14 allowing the torques on motor/generators 350 and 352 to be<br>
controlled independently. In this case, motor/generator 352 can supply power<br>
additively to motor/generator 350, eliminating circulating power and improving<br>
efficiency. With the presence of the input brake 312, the compound split range now<br>
has high torque capacity as the torques of motors 350 and 352 are additive through gear<br>
ratios to the output 62, through two new modes EV1 and EV2 as discussed below.<br>
[0085]	The clutch states required to actuate the electric drive only EVT<br>
transmission modes enabled together with the use of input brake 312 will now be<br>
discussed. As discussed earlier, the addition of the input brake 312 to the two mode<br>
input/compound split EVT 78 provides additional electric only propulsion, engine off,<br>
fixed gear ratio modes of operation of the hybrid vehicle EVT 78. Two of the possible<br>
electric only propulsion EVT fixed gear ration modes are presented herein, the first is<br>
the "EV low" (EV1) mode, and the second is the "EV high" (EV2) mode. Referring<br>
again to Figures 4, both modes EV1 and EV2 require the engine 80 to be in an off state<br>
with the torque transfer device or input brake 312 to be engaged, thereby grounding the<br>
input member 14 to prevent the rotation of input member 14. As discussed earlier, this<br>
provides another torque reaction point to the EVT 78 and, in particular, locks or<br>
inhibits the rotation of either the ring gear 322. This enforces a fixed gearing ratio<br>
between the rotor 368 of motor/generator 350 and the output member 62 through the<br>
planetary gear set 316.<br>
[0086]	To enable the "EV low" (EV1) electric only propulsion EVT fixed gear<br>
ratio mode, the following torque transfer devices are engaged or locked: brake 360 and<br>
torque transmission device/input brake 312. The remaining clutch 364 is disengaged.<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
27<br>
Brake 360 locks the ring gear 330 of planetary gear set 318 to ground 358, thereby<br>
enforcing a fixed gear ratio between the rotor 370 of motor/generator 352 and the EVT<br>
output member 62 through carrier 332 of planetary gear set 318. As discussed above,<br>
with input brake 312 engaged a fixed gear ratio is also enforced between the rotor 368<br>
of motor/generator 350 and the output member 62 through the planetary gear set 316.<br>
Therefore, both motor/generators 350 and 352 are configured to drive in parallel the<br>
output member 62 at fixed gear ratios when in the "EV low" (EV1) mode.<br>
[0087]	To enable the "EV high" (EV2) electric only propulsion EVT fixed gear<br>
ratio mode, the following clutches and brakes are engaged or locked: clutch 364 and<br>
torque transmission device/input brake 312. The remaining torque transfer device 360<br>
is disengaged. Clutch 364 locks the rotation of the rotor 368 of motor/generator 350 to<br>
the ring gear 330 of planetary gear set 318. As described before in discussions of EV1<br>
mode, with the input brake 312 engaged a fixed gear ratio is also enforced between the<br>
rotor 368 of motor/generator 350 and the output member 62 through the planetary gear<br>
set 316. Motor/generator 352 is drivably connected to output member 62 through the<br>
carrier 332 of planetary gear set 318. The gearing ratio at which the rotor 370 of<br>
motor/generator 352 drives the output member 62 is a function of the rotary speed of<br>
the rotor 368 of motor/generator 350 as well as the gear ratios between the ring gear<br>
330, planetary gears 334 and sun gear 331 of planetary gear set 318.<br>
[0088]	As discussed earlier with Figure 1, electric drive only EVT transmission<br>
modes EV1 and EV2 permit both motor/generators 350 and 352 to be operated in<br>
motoring mode to produce mechanical power which is additively combined or electric<br>
propulsion, maximizing the designed motor capacity for electric propulsion. Similarly,<br>
modes EV1 and EV2 enable motor/generators 350 and 352 to operate with additive<br>
generating power to maximize utilization of the designed motor capacity for<br>
regenerative braking. These fixed gear additive modes are enabled through the addition<br>
of the input brake device 312 which locks the input member 14 to facilitate these modes<br>
as described above. The addition of the torque transmission device or input brake 312<br><br>
GP-308792-PTH-CD<br>
28<br>
of the present invention eliminates circulating power and improves operating and<br>
energy efficiency of the EVT 78 in electric only modes (engine off) as described above.<br>
[0089]	The electric drive only EVT transmission modes are particularly<br>
beneficial for use in "plug-in hybrid" applications, that is, a hybrid vehicle that<br>
operates in a battery charge depleting mode during a drive schedule, with the battery<br>
charge at least partially received from an external off-vehicle power source. One<br>
example is a hybrid vehicle configured to receive a substantial electrical charge<br>
overnight by plugging or connecting a power cord of the vehicle into an electrical<br>
receptacle receiving power from an electric utility. The EVT transmission modes,<br>
enabled at least partially through the input brake/torque transfer device 312, extend<br>
vehicle range on battery only engine off operation by improving the electrical energy<br>
efficiency of the EVT as discussed earlier.<br>
[0090]	In all Figures 1 through 4, the input torque transfer device/input brake<br>
(12, 112, 212, and 312) can include a one way clutch device (66, 166, 266, and 366).<br>
The one way clutch (66, 166, 266, and 366) is operable to allow the input member 14<br>
to rotate freely as long as the rotation is in a positive (normal engine operation)<br>
direction, i.e. the direction at which a normally operating engine 80 drives the input<br>
member 14. The one way clutch (66, 166, 266, and 366) is operable to prevent the<br>
input member 14 from rotating in a negative direction (opposite to the direction of<br>
normal engine operation) by engaging and locking the input member 14 to ground (58,<br>
158, 258, and 358).<br>

in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize<br>

scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
