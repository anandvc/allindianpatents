				<td>AUTOMATED HAIR-IMPLANTING APPARATUS FOR MANUFACTURING WIG AND<br>
METHOD OF MANUFACTURING WIG<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to automated hair implanting for<br>
manufacturing wig and method of manufacturing wig, and it pertains to an<br>
automation of wig manufacturing and, more particularly to an automated hair-<br>
implanting apparatus for manufacturing a wig and a method of manufacturing a<br>
wig. The expression "transplanting" used throughout the description ought to<br>
mean "implanting".<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
A wig has been manufactured in such a manner that a hair segment to be<br>
transplanted/implanted is folded in two, which is one by one transplanted onto a three-<br>
dimensional thick base by handwork. When one folded hair segment is transplanted<br>
on the base, it looks as if two hairs are transplanted. Several folded hair segments<br>
may be transplanted at one time.<br>
However, such a prior art handwork is extremely inefficient, because it would<br>
take two or three weeks or more to transplant 20,000 hairs, for example. When a wig<br>
is manufactured in foreign countries in order to save labor costs, it tends to increase<br>
inferior products and reduce a production yield.<br>
Some attempts have been made to develop automated wig manufacturing<br>
systems, but no success has been achieved.<br>
To achieve the above-described object, the present invention has been made<br>
in view of the above-described background. Its object is to provide an automated hair-<br>
transplanting apparatus for manufacturing a wig and a method of manufacturing a wig,<br>
which makes it possible to achieve automation of wig manufacturing, manufacture a<br>
wig quickly and efficiently while preventing inferior products.<br>

MOST PREFERABLE EMBODIMENTS OF INVENTION<br>
Next, an automated hair-transplanting apparatus for manufacturing a wig<br>
embodying the present invention will be described in more detail in reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings showing embodiments thereof. For the sake of convenience,<br>
elements or parts having the same function are indicated by the same reference<br>
numerals and explanation thereof will be omitted. Fig.1 is a general view<br>
diagrammatically showing an automated hair-transplanting apparatus for<br>
manufacturing a wig in accordance with the present invention together with a process<br>
flow. As shown also in Fig.2, a base supply unit 1 supplies a base 11 to a<br>
tensioning/positioning unit 2 in a horizontal orientation. The base. 11 is a very thin<br>
sheet woven by polyurethane fiber, for example, having a thickness of 0.06mm, for<br>
example, which is reeled around a sheet roller 13. The sheet roller 13 is driven by a<br>
motor 15 to supply the reeled base 11 therefrom onto a conveyor table 21. A<br>
reference numeral 17 indicates a sheet roller stopper.<br>
Fig.3 shows the tensioning/positioning unit 2. The tensioning/positioning unit 2<br>
has conveyor table 21 movable on a two-dimensional plane in directions<br>
perpendicular to each other, that is, along X- and Y-axes. The conveyor table 21 is<br>
moved along X- and Y-axes over a predetermined pitch of 2mm, for example, by an X-<br>
axis drive motor (not shown) and a Y-axis drive motor (not shown), respectively, in a<br>
predetermined order. By this, the base 11 becomes stretched and is positioned in a<br>
predetermined position. More particularly, there are tensioners 23 at four corners on<br>
the conveyor table 21 for tensioning the supplied base 11. Each tensioner 23<br>
comprises a pair of opposed tension nip rollers 24, 25 for pressing and clamping the<br>
base 11 from up and down, and tensioning motors 26 (26a, 26b, 26c, 26d) that may<br>
be rotated in forward and reverse directions to drive the rollers 24, 25. A reference<br>
numeral 27 indicates upper and lower sheet feeding rollers arranged at a supply side<br>
of the tensioning/positioning unit 2, which are driven by a motor 27a, shown in Fig.14,<br>
to rotate in one predetermined direction for feeding the base 11 onto the conveyor<br>
table 21. A reference numeral 28 indicates upper and lower sheet discharging rollers<br>
arranged at a discharge side of the tensioning/positioning unit 2, which is rotatable in<br>
forward and reverse directions by a motor 28a, shown in Fig. 14. A reference numeral<br>
29 indicates a sheet slack sensor 29 mounted at the supply side of the<br>
tensioning/positioning unit 2, upstream of the sheet feedingTollers 27, for detecting a<br>
slack of the supplied base 11.<br>
An artificial hair supplying unit 3 shown in Fig. 4, including bobbins 31 A, 31B,<br>
31C and 31D (which may be hereinlater referred to by a generic humeral 31),<br>
supplies an artificial hair 30 onto the upper surface of the base 11. A thread (or the<br>
artificial hair 30) of a different color is reeled around each bobbin 31, which may be<br>
unreeled from the bobbin over a predetermined length by an unreeling motor 31AM,<br>
31BM, 31 CM, 31 DM. The unreeled thread is fed by actuating a vacuum generator 32<br>
(32a, 32b, 32c, 32d) and a single vacuum generator 33, shown in Fig.1. Each bobbin<br>
system 31 has a conduit 35a, 35b, 35c, 35d that forms a travel path, and the artificial<br>
hairs 30 are supplied through the conduit 35a, 35b, 35c, 35d and a conduit 35 to a<br>
hair-transplanting unit 4. As shown in Fig.4, in the middle of each travel path, there is<br>
a movable cutter 34 driven by a cutter motor 34a for cutting the respective artificial<br>
hairs 30 after they are unreeled over a predetermined length by the unreeling motors<br>
31AM, 31 BM, 31 CM, 31 DM. Between the conduit 35 and the conduits 35a, 35b, 35c,<br>
35d are formed gap G1 that allows the cutter 34 to pass therethrough. The artificial<br>
hair 30 may comprise, for example, polyester, acrylic or other chemical fiber that has<br>
been subjected to special treatment for use as an artificial hair. The respective<br>
artificial hairs 30 are supplied through the conduit 35.<br>
Figs.5-7 show the hair-transplant unit 4. The hair-transplant unit 4 comprises<br>
vertically reciprocatable needles 41 (41a, 41b) arranged below the base 11 and a<br>
head 42 arranged above the base 11 and just above the needles 41. The head 42 is<br>
provided with a movable guide 43 in the form of a pipe detachably connected to an<br>
artificial hair supplying nozzle 37 attached to the leading end of the conduit 35, and<br>
press means 44, 45 that may be opened and closed for clamping the artificial hair 30<br>
that has been removed from the movable guide 43 and the artificial hair supplying<br>
nozzle 37, and is driven by a motor 46 to rotate on horizontal plane of the base 11. A<br>
reference numeral 43a indicates a motor for reciprocating the movable guide 43 on a<br>
horizontal plane, which drives the movable guide 43 via a lever 43b connected to a<br>
motor shaft and a connector plate 43c. The press means 44 comprises a movable<br>
member 44a driven by a motor 44c to be opened and closed, and a stationary<br>
receiving member 44b, between which the artificial hair 30 is clamped from opposite<br>
sides thereof. The press means 45 comprises members 45a, 45b that are moved up<br>
and down in synchronism with movement of the movable member 44a to clamp the<br>
artificial hair 30 therebetween. A reference numeral 47 indicates a motor for swinging<br>
the head 42, including the press means 44, toward the needles 41. A reference<br>
numeral 48a indicates a sensor for detecting a rotational angle of the head 42. A<br>
reference numeral 48b indicates a sensor for detecting a rotational angle of the press<br>
means 44. A reference numeral 49a indicates a motor for reciprocating the needles<br>
41, and a reference numeral 49b indicates a motor operative in synchronism with the<br>
motor 46 to rotate the needles 41 on a horizontal plane with respect to the plane of<br>
the base 11. In Fig.5, the artificial hair 30 is transferred in an arrowed direction (in a<br>
direction of X-axis) with respect to the base 11. The needle 41 has a speared or<br>
pointed end provided with a groove 41". The needle 41 comprises two needles 41a,<br>
41b supported to a vertically reciprocatable needle arm (not shown) with a<br>
predetermined gap of 1mm, for example, therebetween. The needles 41a, 41b are<br>
positioned with their grooves 41" extending in the same direction that is perpendicular<br>
to the artificial hair 30.<br>
Fig.8 shows a hair-blowing unit 5 in the hair-transplanting unit 4. More<br>
particularly, just below the transplanted artificial hair 30 is arranged a chain conveyor<br>
51 that rotates clockwise, and the conveyor 51 is provided with a plurality of raking<br>
bars 52. A holding bar 53 is suitably separated from the transplanted artificial hairs<br>
30. The conveyor 51 is driven to rotate at a predetermined time interval so that the<br>
raking bars 52 rake the transplanted artificial hairs 30 to right, which are then held by<br>
the holding bar 53. This assures that next transplanting operation may be done with<br>
no obstacles on an area to be hair-transplanted.<br>
Shown in Fig.15 is an electrostatic valve (three position, closed center double<br>
solenoid) 39a that is linked with an air compressor 39 to actuate the vacuum<br>
generators 32, 33.<br>
Next, operation of the automated hair-transplanting apparatus for<br>
manufacturing a wig in accordance with the present invention will be described in<br>
reference to Figs.9-14. A slack T1 is first given between the sheet feeding rollers 27<br>
and the tension nip rollers 24, 25 (Fig.9(A)), and the discharge roller 28 is driven to<br>
rotate to feed the base 11 (Fig.9 (B)). Up to this time, the tension nip rollers 24, 25<br>
remains opened. Next, the tension nip rollers 24, 25 are closed to hold the supplied<br>
base 11 therebetween, thereby again providing a slack T1 between the sheet feeding<br>
rollers 27 and the tension nip rollers 24, 25 (Fig.9 (C)). Then, the sheet discharging<br>
rollers 28 are driven to rotate in a reverse direction to provide another slack T2<br>
between the tension nip rollers 24, 25 and the sheet discharging rollers 28 (Fig.9<br>
(D)). The total amount of the slacks T1 and T2 thus given should be enough to move<br>
the conveyor table 21. The hatched portion of the sheet slack sensor 29 in Fig.9<br>
indicates a detectable area. The base 11 is transferred from left to right.<br>
The base 11 thus fed is nipped from top and bottom between the tension nip<br>
rollers 24, 25 to become stretched on the conveyor table 21 (see Fig.3). Then,<br>
predetermined data designating a pitch of hair-transplantation, coloring of the artificial<br>
hairs 30, etc. are read out by control means comprising a computer, not shown,<br>
according to which hair-transplanting process will start. The color scheme of the<br>
artificial hairs 30 is determined in advance as a combination of 50% of the hair from<br>
the bobbin 31 A, 30% from the bobbin 31B, 15% from the bobbin 31C and 5% from the<br>
bobbin 31D, for example.<br>
Prior to the hair-transplanting process, the artificial hairs 30 have been supplied<br>
to above the base 11. Supply of the artificial hair 30 is carried out by the vacuum<br>
generators 32, 33 that are driven in response to a command from the control means<br>
to absorb by vacuum the thread. More specifically, when the artificial hair 30 of "A"<br>
color is to be selected, ports "1-A" and "2-A" of the electromagnetic valve 39a (shown<br>
in Fig.15) in the vacuum generator 32 are turned on, and a motor for the bobbin 31A<br>
is turned on. When the artificial hair 30 of "B" color is to be selected, ports "1-B" and<br>
"2-B" of the electromagnetic valve 39a are turned on, and a motor for the bobbin 31B<br>
is turned on. When the artificial hair 30 of "C" color should be selected, ports "3-A"<br>
and "4-A" of the electromagnetic valve 39a are turned on, and a motor for the bobbin<br>
31C is turned on. When the artificial hair 30 of "D" color is to be selected, ports "3-B"<br>
and "4-B" of the electromagnetic valve 39a are turned on, and a motor for the bobbin<br>
31D is turned on. When a thread sensor (not shown) comprising a photoelectric tube,<br>
for example, detects that the artificial hair 30 reaches a predetermined length, the<br>
cutter 34 become operative to cut the artificial hair 30 to a predetermined length. The<br>
artificial hair segment 30 thus cut is supplied to above the base 11.<br>
Then, the artificial hair 30 is transplanted. First, the movable guide 43 is<br>
moved to right to be connected with the artificial hair supply nozzle 37. At this time,<br>
the press means 44, 45 remain opened. When the artificial hair 30 is inserted into the<br>
movable guide 43, the movable guide 43 is moved to left to separate from the artificial<br>
hair supply nozzle 37. Then, the press means 44, 45 are closed substantially at the<br>
same time to hold the artificial hair 30 into a horizontal orientation. While the artificial<br>
hair 30 is temporarily fixed in such a manner, the head 42 is driven by the motor 46 to<br>
rotate about its axis. At the same time, the needle 41 is driven by the motor 49b in<br>
synchronism with the motor 46 to rotate about its axis. Then, the needle 41 is moved<br>
upward. While the artificial hair 30 is temporarily fixed by the press means 44, 45, it is<br>
driven by the motor 47 to rotate toward the needle 41 so that the artificial hair 30 is<br>
forced against the needle 41, and then needle 41 is moved downward. An angle of<br>
this swinging movement is determined in advance, which is detected by the sensor<br>
48a. During descent of the needle 41, the artificial hair 30 goes into the groove 41" of<br>
the needle 41 and, therefore, is pulled out by the needle 41 to below the base 11. At<br>
this time, the press means 44, 45 remain opened. The conveyor 51 is driven to rotate<br>
at a predetermined time interval, and the transplanted artificial hair 30 is raked to right<br>
by the raking bars 53. This assures that next transplanting operation may be done<br>
with no obstacles on an area to be hair-transplanted. Transplantation of the artificial<br>
hair 30 onto the base 11 may be done at a predetermined pitch of 2mm, for example,<br>
in a predetermined order, after the base 11 has been moved in a direction of Y-axis<br>
(shown in Fig. 13) that is perpendicular to the direction of supply of the artificial hair 30<br>
(X-axis) or it has been moved in a direction of X-axis.<br>
After completing the hair-transplantation in the above-described manner, the<br>
stretched condition of the base 11 is released, and the sheet discharging rollers 28<br>
are rotated to discharge the completed base 11a (Fig.14(A)). Next, the base feeding<br>
process is again carried out in the afore-mentioned manner to feed a plane 11b as a<br>
new base 11 to be hair-transplanted (Fig.14(B)).<br>
The respective parts, described above, will be controlled by control means<br>
comprising a computer, not shown.<br>
The above-described process A will be described in detail in reference to the<br>
flowcharts of Figs. 16-33.<br>
In Figs. 16-18, the power source is turned on (S1) and the respective units are<br>
initialized (to be ready for starting operation) (S2). Then, a READY signal that notifies<br>
completion of initialization is supplied from each unit to the computer (S3). The<br>
computer then outputs an operation start signal. When receiving this signal (S4), the<br>
procedure goes to a step 5 (S5). If this signal is not received, the procedure is<br>
returned to the step 4 (S4). At the step 5 (S5), it is discriminated that there is a film<br>
sheet to be used as a base 11 between the sheet discharging rollers 28 at the<br>
discharge side. When there is the base 11, the sheet feeding process (S6) is carried<br>
out, which will be described in detail in reference to Fig.30, and the sheet discharging<br>
process (S7) is carried out wherein the sheet discharging rollers 28 are driven to<br>
rotate in a forward direction, which will be described in detail in reference to Fig.31.<br>
When there is no film sheet to be used as a base 11 at the discharge side, the<br>
computer determines that the apparatus is in an ERROR LEVEL 9 indicating no film<br>
sheet set (S8), and the procedure is returned to the step 5 (S5). Then, the tensioning<br>
motor 26a rotates in a forward or clockwise direction, the tensioning motor 26b rotates<br>
in a reverse direction, the tensioning motor 26c rotates in a forward direction and the<br>
tensioning motor 26d rotates in a reverse direction (S9a-S9d). It is then discriminated<br>
if cam sensors, not shown, are ON or not (S10a-S10d). When the cam sensor is ON,<br>
the corresponding tensioning motor 26a, 26b, 26c, 26d is turned off (S11a-S11d).<br>
When the cam sensor is not ON, the procedure is returned to S9a-S9d. Then,<br>
variables that determines the amount of rotation of the tensioning motors 26a, 26b,<br>
26c, 26d are initialized (S12a-S12d), and It is discriminated if its value reaches a<br>
predetermined value (S13a-S13d). If YES, the tensioning motors 26a, 26b, 26c, 26d<br>
are caused to stop (S14a-S14d). If NO, the tensioning motor 26a rotates in a reverse<br>
direction, the tensioning motor 26b rotates forward, the tensioning motor 26c rotates<br>
reversely and the tensioning motor 26d rotates forward (S15a-S15d), and the amount<br>
of rotation of the respective tensioning motors 26a, 26b, 26c, 26d are count (S16a-<br>
S16d). By performing the processes through S9a, S9b, S9c and S9d to S14a, S14b,<br>
S14c and S14d, the sheet base 11 supplied onto the conveyor table 21 is nipped<br>
between the tensioning nip rollers 24, 25 and become stretched. Then, the sheet<br>
feeding process is carried out, which will be described in detail in reference to Fig.30,<br>
wherein the sheet feeding rollers 27 becomes operative (S17). Then, the sheet<br>
discharging process is carried out, which will be described in detail in reference to<br>
Fig.32, wherein the sheet discharging rollers 28 become operative (S18). Then, the<br>
prescribed data are received (S19), and the coordinate data are read out (S20). After<br>
the coordinate data have been read out (S21), the X-axis drive motor for the<br>
conveyor table 21 will stop (S22), and the Y-axis drive motor will also stop (S23).<br>
Then, the procedure advances to the discharging process (S24), which will be<br>
described in detail in reference to Fig.33. If all the coordinate data have not yet been<br>
read out, the procedure advances to a step 25 (S25) where it is discriminated if the<br>
coordinate data designates predetermined position. If YES, the X-axis drive motor<br>
(not shown) for the conveyor table 21 is caused to stop (S26), and then the Y-axis<br>
drive motor is also caused to stop (S27). Thus, the positioning has been completed,<br>
and the procedure advances to the next, hair-transplanting process is to be carried out<br>
(S28). If the coordinate data position is NO, the X-axis drive motor for the conveyor<br>
table 21 is turned on (S29), and it is then discriminated if an X-axis limit sensor is ON<br>
or not (S30). If YES, the X-axis drive motor for the conveyor table 21 is caused to<br>
stop (S31). If there is an ERROR 11 (S32), the procedure is returned to S2. If the X-<br>
axis limit sensor is not ON, it is then discriminated if a Y-axis limit sensor is ON or not<br>
(S33). If it is ON, the Y-axis drive motor for the conveyor table 21 is caused to stop<br>
(S34). If there is an ERROR 12 (S35), which indicates that an X-axis H/P sensor and<br>
the X-axis drive motor should be out of order, the procedure is returned to S2. When<br>
the left-hand Y-axis limit sensor is not ON, it is then discriminated if the Y-axis limit<br>
sensor is ON or not (S36). If YES, the procedure advances to S34. If NO, the Y-axis<br>
drive motor for the conveyor table 21 is turned on (S37), and the procedure is<br>
returned to S25.<br>
The initialization of the respective units (S2) will be described based on<br>
Figs. 19-23. It is first discriminated if a sensor for detecting insertion of the artificial<br>
hairs 30 into the bobbins 31 is ON or not (S201). If the sensor is ON, the artificial<br>
hairs 30 of different colors reeled around the bobbins 31A, 31B, 31C and 31D are<br>
ready for starting operation, and the roller initialization is carried out, which will be<br>
described in detail in reference to Fig.20 (S203). If the sensor is not ON, there is an<br>
ERROR LEVEL 7 indicating no insertion of the artificial hair 30 into the bobbin (S202),<br>
and the procedure is returned to S201. The tensioning rollers 23 in the<br>
tensioning/positioning unit 2 and the needle 41 in the hair-transplanting unit 4 are set<br>
to be ready for starting the respective operation (S204, S205). The conveyor table 21<br>
is then set to be ready for its operation (S206).<br>
The above-described roller initialization is shown in more detail in Fig.20. A<br>
timer is first initialized (S2031) and the variation determining the amount of rotation of<br>
the sheet feeding rollers 27 that feeds a film sheet to be used as a base 11 is<br>
initialized (S2032). Then, the timer starts (S2033), and it is discriminated if the sheet<br>
slack sensor 29 is ON or not (S2034). If YES, the drive motor for the sheet feeding<br>
rollers 27 is turned off (S2035), and the procedure is returned. If NO at S2034, it is<br>
then discriminated if the timer reaches to a predetermined count (S2036). If YES, the<br>
drive motor for the sheet feeding rollers 27 is turned off (S2037). When there arises<br>
an ERROR LEVEL 1 indicating no film sheet for use as a base 11 (S2038), the<br>
procedure is returned to S201. If the timer does not reach the predetermined count,<br>
the drive motor for the sheet feeding rollers 27 is turned on (S2039), the amount of<br>
rotation of the sheet feeding rollers 27 is count (S2040), and the procedure is returned<br>
to S2034.<br>
The tensioner initialization will be described in more detail based on Fig.21 and<br>
Fig.22. The timer is first itialized (S2041) and then caused to start (S2042). The<br>

forward, the tensioning motor 26c rotates reversely and the tensioning motor 26d<br>
rotates forward (S2043a-S2043d). It is then discriminated if the cam position sensors,<br>
not shown, are ON or not (S2044a-S2044d). If YES, the corresponding tensioning<br>
motor 26a, 26b, 26c, 26d will stop (S2045a-S2045d), and the procedure is returned.<br>
If NO at S2044a-S2044d, it is then discriminated if the timer has reached a<br>
predetermined count (S2046a-S2046d). If YES, the corresponding tensioning motor<br>
26a, 26b, 26c, 26d stops (S2047a-S2047d). If there is an ERROR LEVEL 2, 3, 4 or 5<br>
(S2048a-S2048d), which indicates that the tensioning roller 23 is out of order, the<br>
procedure is returned to S201. If NO at S2046a-S2046d, the procedure is returned to<br>
S2043a-S2043d.<br>
The needle initialization is shown in more detail in Fig.23. The timer is first<br>
initialized (S2051) and then caused to start (S2052). It is then discriminated if there is<br>
a film sheet for use as a. base 11 above a needle position sensor, not shown (S2053).<br>
If YES, a motor 49a for initialization of the needle 41 stops (S2054), and the<br>
procedure is returned. If NO at S2053, it is discriminated if the timer has reached a<br>
predetermined count (S2055). If YES, the motor 49a for initialization of the needle 41<br>
stops (S2056). When there is an ERROR LEVEL 6 indicating that the needle unit<br>
would be out of order, the procedure is returned to S201. When the timer has not yet<br>
reached a predetermined count, the motor 49a for initialization of the needle 41 is<br>
turned on (S2058), and the procedure is returned to S2053.<br>
The conveyor table initialization is shown in more detail in Fig.24 and Fig.25.<br>
The timer is initialized (S2061) and caused to start (S2062). It is then discriminated if<br>
a Y-axis H/P sensor for detecting the origin along Y-axis is ON or not (S2063). If YES,<br>
the Y-axis drive motor for the conveyor table 21 is turned off (S2064). Next, it is<br>
discriminated if the X-axis H/P sensor for detecting the origin along X-axis is ON or not<br>
(S2065). If YES, the X-axis drive motor for the conveyor table 21 is turned off<br>
(S2066), and the timer stops (S2067). It is then discriminated if the table position<br>
agrees with the origin on the Y-axis at which the hair-transplantation should start<br>
(S2068). If YES, the Y-axis drive motor for the conveyor table 21 is turned off<br>
(S2069). The variation deterrhining the amount of movement along the X-axis is<br>
initialized (S2070) and then the variation determining the amount of movement along<br>
the Y-axis is initialized (S2071), and the procedure is returned. If NO at S2068, the Y-<br>
axis drive motor for the conveyor table 21 is turned on to rotate in a forward direction<br>
(S2072). The amount of movement along the Y-axis is count (S2073), and the<br>
procedure is returned to S2068.<br>
If No at S2063, the procedure advances to S2074 where it is discriminated if<br>
the Y-axis limit sensor is ON or not. If YES, the Y-axis drive motor for the conveyor<br>
table 21 is turned off (S2075), and the timer also stops (S2076). When there arises<br>
an ERROR LEVEL 10 (S2077), indicating that the Y-axis H/P sensor and the Y-axis<br>
drive motor are both out of order, the procedure is returned to S201. If NO at S2074,<br>
it is then discriminated if the timer has reached a predetermined count (S2078). If<br>
YES, the procedure advances to S2075, whereas if NO, the Y-axis drive motor for the<br>
conveyor table 21 rotates in a reverse direction (S2079), and the procedure is<br>
returned to S2063.<br>
If No at S2065, it is then discriminated if the X-axis limit sensor is ON or not<br>
(S2080). If YES, the X-axis drive motor for the conveyor table 21 is turned off<br>
(S2081), and the timer stops (S2082). When there arises an ERROR LEVEL 11<br>
indicating malfunction (S2083), the procedure is returned to S201. If NO at S2080, it<br>
is then discriminated if the timer has reached a predetermined count (S2084). If YES,<br>
the procedure advances to S2081. If NO, the X-axis drive motor on the conveyor<br>
table 21 is turned on to rotate in a forward direction (S2085), and the procedure is<br>
returned to S2065.<br>
The hair-transplantation of the artificial hair 30 will now be described in<br>
reference to Figs.26-28. The timer is initialized (S2801) and caused to start (S2802).<br>
The electromagnetic valve in the vacuum generator 32 is turned on (S2803), and the<br>
electromagnetic valve in the vacuum generator 33 is also turned on (S2804). Then,<br>
the drive motor for the selected bobbin is turned on so that the artificial hair 30 is<br>
supplied therefrom (S2805) to pass through the movable guide 43. It is then<br>
discriminated if the thread sensor for detecting the artificial hair 30 of a predetermined<br>
length is ON or not (S2806). If YES, a motor (not shown) for driving the selected<br>
bobbin 31 is turned off (S2807). The electromagnetic valve in the vacuum generator<br>
33 is turned off (S2808) and the electromagnetic valve in the vacuum generator 32 is<br>
turned off (S2809). The motor 43a for driving the movable guide 43 is turned on to<br>
rotate in a reverse direction (S2810) to rotate the movable guide 43 to move to left<br>
(S2811-S2812). Once the movable guide 43 reaches the left-end position, the<br>
reverse rotation of the motor 43a is turned off by the limit switch (not shown). At the<br>
same time, the motor 44c rotates over a predetermined angle (S2813-S2815) to close<br>
the press means 44,45 to hold the artificial hair 30 therebetween (S2816). Then, the<br>
cutter motor 34a is driven (S2817). The cutter solenoid is turned on to move the<br>
cutter 34 into the gap G1 (S2818). After the cutter solenoid has been turned off<br>
(S1819), the cutter motor 34a stops (S2820) so that the artificial hair 30 is cut by the<br>
cutter 34 into a predetermined length. Then, the cutter solenoid is turned on to return<br>
its original position (S2821-S2822), and then turned off (S2823). Then, the motors<br>
46, 49b rotates forward to horizontally rotate the head 42 and the needle 41 (S2824-<br>
S2825), followed by the needle elevation (S2826) that will be described in detail in<br>
reference to Fig.28. Then, the motor 47 rotates over a predetermined angle to rotate<br>
the press means 44 toward the needle 41 (S2827-S2829), followed by the needle<br>
descent (S2830) that will be described in detail in reference to Fig.29. In the needle<br>
descending step, the needle 41 goes down with the artificial hair 30 being entrapped<br>
by the groove 41". Immediately after (or almost at the same time when) the needle-<br>
descending step, the motor 44c starts to rotate reversely to open the movable<br>
member 44a (S2831-S2833). This allows the artificial hair 3Q to be pulled down.<br>
Then, the motors 46, 49b rotates reversely on a horizontal plane to be returned to<br>
their original positions (S2834-S2835). Then, the motor 43a for driving the movable<br>
guide 43 is turned on to rotate forward (S2836) to move the movable guide 43 to right<br>
(S2837). This connects the movable guide 43 with the artificial hair supply nozzle 37,<br>
and the forward rotation of the motor 43a is turned off (S2838). The procedure is then<br>
returned to S2803 and, after movement along X-axis and Y-axis over predetermined<br>
pitches, respectively, the above-described transplanting operation of the artificial hair<br>
30 will be repeated. If NO at S2806, it is discriminated if the timer has reached a set<br>
value (S2839). If YES, the motors for driving the respective bobbins 31 will stop<br>
(S2840). If there arises an ERROR LEVEL 8 indicating no artificial hair 30 around<br>
bobbin 31, a stopped-up condition with hairs or sensor malfunction (S2841), the<br>
procedure is returned to S2801. If the count has not yet reached the set value at<br>
S2839, the motors for driving the respective bobbins 31 are driven (S2842), and the<br>
procedure is returned to S2806.<br>
The needle-elevating step at S2826 will be described in more detail based on<br>
Fig.29(A). It is first discriminated if the needle position sensor, not shown, detects that<br>
the needle is in the upper position (S2826-1). If YES, rotation of the motor 49a for<br>
elevating the needle 41 comes to a stop (S2826-2), and the procedure is returned. If<br>
NO, rotation of the motor 49a for elevating the needle 41 is turned on (S2826-3), and<br>
the procedure is returned to S2826-1.<br>
The needle-descending step at S2830 will be described in more detail based<br>
on Fig.29(B). It is first discriminated if the needle position sensor, not shown, detects<br>
that the needle is in the lower position (S2830-1). If YES, rotation of the motor 49a for<br>
lowering the needle 41 comes to a stop (S2830-2), and the procedure is returned. If<br>
NO, rotation of the motor 49a for lowering the needle 41 is turned on (S2830-3), and<br>
the procedure is returned to S2830-1.<br>
The sheet-feeding step at S6 will be described in more detail based on Fig.30.<br>
After the variation for determining the amount of rotation of the feeder rollers 27 is<br>
initialized (S61), it is discriminated if the slack sensor 29 is ON or not (S62). If YES,<br>
the roller drive motor 15 in the base supply unit 1 is turned off (S63). If NO, the said<br>
roller drive motor 15 is turned on (S64), and the procedure is returned to S62. It is<br>
then discriminated if the sheet feeding rollers 27 has been rotated over a<br>
predetermined unreel period (S65). If YES, the sheet feeding motor 27a for driving<br>
the sheet feeding rollers 27 is turned off (S66), and the procedure is returned. If NO<br>
at S65, the sheet feeding motor 27a is turned on (S67), the amount of rotation of the<br>
sheet feeding rollers 27 is count by a pulse counter (S68), and the procedure is then<br>
returned to S62.<br>
The sheet discharging operation at S7 wherein the sheet discharging rollers 28<br>
rotate forward will be described in more detail based on Fig.31. The count value<br>
indicating the number of forward rotation of the sheet discharging rollers 28 is<br>
initialized (S71). It is then discriminated if the number of forward rotation of the sheet<br>
discharging rollers 28 has reached a predetermined number (S72). If YES, the drive<br>
motor 28a for the sheet discharging rollers 28 is turned off (S73), and the procedure is<br>
returned. If NO at S72, the drive motor 28a for the sheet discharging rollers 28 is<br>
driven forward (S74), and the number of forward rotation thereof is count (S75). The<br>
procedure is then returned to S72. Thus, the operation shown in Figs.9(A)-9(C) has<br>
been carried out.<br>
The sheet-discharging step at S18 wherein the sheet discharging rollers 28<br>
rotate reversely will be described in more detail based on Fig.32. The count value<br>
indicating the number of reverse rotation of the sheet discharging rollers 28 is<br>
initialized (S181). It is then discriminated if the number of reverse rotation of the sheet<br>
discharging rollers 28 has reached a predetermined number (S182). If YES, the drive<br>
motor 28a for the sheet discharging rollers 28 is turned off (S183), and the procedure<br>
is returned. If NO at S182, the drive motor 28a for the sheet discharging rollers 28 is<br>
driven reversely (S184), and the number of reverse rotation thereof is count (S185).<br>
The procedure is then returned to S182. Thus, the operation shown in Fig.9(D) has<br>
been carried out.<br>
The sheet-discharging step at S24 will be described in more detail based on<br>
Fig.33. At first, it is discriminated if the Y-axis H/P sensor is ON or not and if the X-<br>
axis H/P sensor are ON or not (S241 a, S241 b). If YES, the Y-axis drive motor for the<br>
conveyor table 21 is turned off (S242a), and the X-axis drive motor for the conveyor<br>
table 21 is also turned off (S242b). If NO, the Y-axis drive motor on the conveyor<br>
table 21 is driven to rotate reversely (S243a), and the procedure is returned to S241a.<br>
Likewise, the X-axis drive motor for the conveyor table 21 is driven to rotate forward<br>
(S243b), and the procedure is returned to S241b. The pulse counter is then initialized<br>
so that the amount of movement along the Y-axis is set to zero (S244). It is then<br>
discriminated if the amount of movement along the Y-axis has reached a<br>
predetermined position (S245). If YES, the Y-axis drive motor for the conveyor table<br>
21 is turned off (S246). If NO, the Y-axis drive motor for the conveyor table 21 is<br>
driven to rotate forward (S247), and the amount of forward movement is count (S248).<br>
The procedure is then returned to S245. The procedure then advances to the sheet-<br>
discharging step (Fig.31) (S249), followed by the tensioner initialization (Fig.21 and<br>
Fig.22) (S250). Then, the amount of rotation of the sheet discharging rollers 28 is<br>
initialized (S251), and it is discriminated if it reaches a predetermined amount (S252).<br>
If YES, the sheet discharging motor 28a for driving the discharge, rollers 28 is turned<br>
off (S253), and the procedure is returned. If NO at S252, the sheet discharging motor<br>
28a is driven to rotate forward (S254), the amount of movement at the discharge end<br>
is count (S255), and the procedure is returned to S252.<br>
The following advantages and effects may be achieved in accordance with the<br>
above-mentioned embodiment. First, relationship between width (W) of the needle 41<br>
and the transplanting pitch (P) may be interrupted. More particularly, the pitch of<br>
natural human hairs is less than 1mm, usually approximately 0.5mm. Therefore, it is<br>
desirable that a wig has an equivalent hair-transplanting pitch (P) of less than 1mm,<br>
or of the order of 0.5mm. In order to provide a hair-transplanting pitch (P) of<br>
approximately 0.5mm, the needle width should be much shorter than 0.5mm,<br>
otherwise needle holes in the base produced by needle penetration would become a<br>
continuous slit, which makes hair-transplantation impossible. However, according to<br>
the currently available technology and materials, the width (W) of the needle 41<br>
should be approximately 1mm or larger. If the width (W) of the needle 41 should be<br>
reduced to about 0.5mm, the needle tends to cause some trouble such as breakage<br>
or deformation.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the base made from an elastic sheet<br>
can be stretched when subjected to tension. Since the pitch (P) (that is 2mm in the<br>
embodiment) is larger than the width (W) of the needle 41 (that is 1mm in the<br>
embodiment) in a direction perpendicular to the feeding direction of the artificial hair<br>
30 that is fed onto the stretched base 11, the needle holes formed by transplantation<br>
can not be transformed into a continuous groove. Further, even when the<br>
transplantation pitch (P) is determined as a double of the needle width (W), when the<br>
stretched condition of the base 11 is released after the transplanting operation is<br>
completed, the base 11 will shrink so that the transplantation pitch (P) is decreased to<br>
substantially a half (to be approximately 0.5mm in the embodiment), which means that<br>
a favorable pitch (P) may be obtained. This enables mechanization, which makes it<br>
possible to manufacture wigs in a reduced time and prevent inferior products. In<br>
addition the base 11 has good breathability, thereby preventing a sweaty condition in<br>
a wig when it is worn on a head or other human body part.<br>
The artificial hair 30 once transplanted is blown away by the blowing unit 5 in a<br>
direction opposite to the needle 41, which assures that the artificial hair 30 may be<br>
transplanted onto a surface having no obstacles. Accordingly, the artificial hair 30 that<br>
has been transplanted and the next artificial hair 30 could not get entangled with each<br>
other, so that he transplanting operation can be achieved smoothly.<br>
Because the base 11 is very thin, post-processing after the hair-<br>
transplanting process A may be done freely and have wide application. Fig.1<br>
illustrates an application where a three-dimensional wig is manufactured in<br>
accordance with the present invention. The discharged base 11 is subjected<br>
to the first adhesive applying process B. A first glue applicator 6 provides first<br>
glue 61 for securing the artificial hairs 30 that have been transplanted onto the<br>
top surface of the base 11. More specifically, the first glue applicator 6<br>
comprises a tank 62, the first glue 61 in the tank 62, and a nozzle device 63<br>
driven by the air compressor 39 to jet the first glue 61. At the hair-<br>
transplanting process A, it jets the first glue 61 toward the base end portions<br>
30a (shown in Fig.8) of the artificial hairs 30 remaining on the top surface of<br>
the base 11 onto which the artificial hairs 30 have been transplanted, thereby<br>
securing the base end portions 30a onto the base 11. The first glue 61 is of a<br>
quick-drying nature and contains a hardening agent for bearing heat and<br>
pressure applied at the forming process D to be described later.<br>
Then, the cutting process C will be carried out. Here, the base 11 to<br>
which the first glue 61 has been applied is cut by the cutter unit 7 comprising<br>
the cutter device 71 into a predetermined shape.<br>
Then, the forming process D will be carried out. Here, the base 11 thus<br>
cut by a forming unit 8 is subjected to heat and pressure to be formed into a<br>
predetermined shape. The forming unit 8 has, for example, a three-<br>
dimensional forming cavity 81 corresponding to a head size, and the base 11<br>
is transformed in conformity to the forming cavity 81. The forming cavity 81 is<br>
divided into right and left halves, each having a pair of upper and lower teeth.<br>
Then, the second adhesive applying process E will be carried out. Here,<br>
a second glue applicator 9 applies second glue 91 onto the top surface of the<br>
base 11. More specifically, the second glue applicator 9 comprises a tank 92,<br>
the second glue 91 in the tank 92, and a nozzle device 93 driven by the air<br>
compressor 39 to jet the second glue 91. It jets the second glue 91 onto the<br>
first glue 61 that has been hardened, to form an adhesive layer (not shown) of<br>
the wig. The second glue 91 is of an adhesive nature that is fittable to the<br>
human skin, which may be one for medical use. Thus, the wig is completely<br>
manufactured and may be directly attached to the head.<br>
The length of the artificial hair 30 is not limited, not like the human hair, and<br>
may be supplied as an endless, continuous one. Accordingly, when the artificial hair<br>
30 in an amount corresponding to the estimated amount of daily work consumption is<br>
supplied to the rollers, the work may be done continuously, without interruption, which<br>
further contributes to improvement of efficiency.<br>
Since the artificial hairs 30 may have different colors and different materials, a<br>
special wig such as one streaked with grizzled hair, one being well resistant to water<br>
and moisture, etc. may conveniently and easily be manufactured. When<br>
manufacturing a wig streaked with grizzled hair, it may be possible to control at will<br>
proportion of gray and black hairs which may differ at different sites.<br>
Since movement of the conveyor table 21 and the needle 41 is controlled by<br>
the control unit such as a computer, the manner or mode of transplanting the artificial<br>
hairs 30 onto the base 11 may be not only a straight stitching but also a zigzag<br>
stitching that provides more resistant to separation after transplanting.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the embodiments that have been<br>
described hereinabove and should be understood to have various variations and<br>
modifications without departing from the spirits and scope of the invention defined in<br>
the appended claims. For example, a degree of tension applied to the base 11 is<br>
variable depending upon stretchability of material of the base 11, by which the<br>
transplanting pitch (P) may be determined upon demand.<br>
Although the base 11 is supplied in a horizontal orientation in the foregoing<br>
embodiment, it may be supplied in a vertical orientation. It may also be supplied in a<br>
slanting orientation.<br>
The kinds and number of bobbins 31 may be optional.<br>
The material of the base 11 preferably comprises non-woven made of synthetic<br>
resin fiber or a breathable film, but they are not limitative. It may be made from animal<br>
fiber, vegetable fiber, mineral fiber, etc. It may be woven material, as well. The<br>
material and kind is not at all limited, as far as it has stretchability.<br>
The transplantation of the artificial hair 30 onto the base 11 may be done in a<br>
slanting direction.<br>
The length of the artificial hair 30 may be varied at will in accordance with a<br>
design determined and controlled by the computer.<br>
Means for feeding the artificial hair 30 into the conduit 35 may be one other<br>
than the vacuum generator.<br>
One or plurality of the artificial hair 30 may be supplied.<br>
The hair-transplanted wig, that is flat because not subjected to the forming<br>
process D shown in Fig.1, may be shipped as a final product.<br>
Because the base 11 is very thin in the wig manufactured in accordance with<br>
the present invention, it is applicable not only to one directly fitted on a head but also<br>
to one for actors or actresses. In the latter application, the wig is attached to a<br>
separate, thick matrix (that is formed into a three-dimensional shape, without artificial<br>
hairs 30, corresponding to a head of a wearer).<br>
Where the needle 41 is moved perpendicular to the artificial hair 30, the needle<br>
41 may be arranged so as to be movable to left and right.<br>
