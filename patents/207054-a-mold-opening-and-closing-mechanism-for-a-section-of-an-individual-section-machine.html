COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10] RULE 13<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
EMHART GLASS S.A., a Swiss corporation having a place of business at Gewerbestrasse 11, CH-6330 Cham, Switzerland,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
2OO0	GRANTED<br><br>
21 FEB 2000<br><br>
1 <br>
SPECIFICATION<br>
I.S. MACHINE<br>
 The present invention relates to I.S. (individual section) machines which transform gobs of molten glass into bottles in a two step process and more particularly to the mechanism for cooling the blankmolds of that machine.<br><br><br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The first I.S. machine was patented in U.S. Patents Nos. 1,843,159, dated February 2, 1932, and 1,911,119, dated May 23,  1933.   An I.S.  (individual section)  machine has a<br><br>
 plurality of identical sections (a section frame in which and on which are mounted a number of section mechanisms) each of which has a blank station which has one or more blankmolds for receiving a corresponding number of gobs of molten glass. The received gobs are formed into parisons having a threaded opening at the bottom (the finish) and a blow station which receives the parisons and forms them into bottles standing upright with the finish at the top. The more effective the heat transfer from a gob of molten glass within a blankmold, the quicker the forming process.<br>
	Conventionally, the blankmolds are formed with a series<br><br>
of vertical holes and cooling air is either directed upwardly through these holes (bottom up) or downwardly through these holes (top down). The most recent design for an I.S. machine is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,830,254 and a conventional system for supplying top down cooling air is shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,561,875.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an<br><br>
2 <br>
improved top down air cooling system for blank molds in such a machine.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the present invention<br>
will become apparent from the following portion of this<br>
specification  and  from  the  accompanying  drawings  which<br>
illustrate a presently preferred embodiment incorporating the<br>
Principles of theinvention-<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a mold opening and closing mechanism for a section of an Individual Section machine comprising<br>
at least one mold half having vertical cooling air passage means,<br>
a mold carrier assembly including carrier/insert means for supporting said at least one mold half and horizontal axially extending shaft means connected to said carrier/insert means,<br>
a housing including means for supporting said horizontal axially extending shaft means for axial displacement so that said carrier/insert means can be axially displaced between retracted and advanced positions,<br>
said housing additionally including first and second vertically extending duct means, said first and second vertically extending duct means each having, at the upper end thereof, a sleeve,<br>
a manifold assembly including<br>
a manifold including a plenum including a portion for overlying each of said at least one mold half, the at least one plenum portion having downwardly opening exit means,<br>
a spacer secured beneath said frame and having vertically extending spacer hole means communicating with the downwardly opening exit means of each of the at least one plenum portion for delivering cooling air from the plenum to the vertical cooling air passage means of the at least one mold half,<br>
said manifold including a pair of horizontally facing cylindrical inlet holes,<br>
a pair of cylindrical tubes each having a first end received by one of said cylindrical holes, and<br>
first and second elbow means for connecting a second end of each of the cylindrical tubes to said sleeves so that cooling air from the duces will be delivered to the pair of tubes,<br>
each of said pair of cylindrical tubes having a length selected so that the first end of each of said cylindrical tubes will be in the corresponding inlet holes as said carrier/insert means is displaced between the retracted and advanced positions.<br>
3 <br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE [DRAWINGS   <br><br>
Referring to the drawings:<br>
Figure 1 is a side elevational view, partly in section, of half of the top down cooling system made in accordance with the teachings of the present invention; and        Figure 2 is an oblique view of the manifold portion of the system shown in figure 1.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br><br>
 A gob of molten glass is formed into a parison at the blank station of section of an I.S. machine. The gob is formed in a blankmold which includes a pair of opposed blankmold halves 10. Each blankmold half is carried by one or more inserts 12 which are supported by a carrier 14. The carrier is secured to a pair of round shafts 16 (one shown) which are slidingly received in suitable bearings (not shown) which are part of a housing 18 secured to the section frame or box 19 by suitable fasteners 20. The housing supports a vertical ball screw (not shown) which drives a pair of nuts (also not shown) connected to the left hand end of corresponding links 21. The right hand end of each link is connected via a horizontal shaft 22 to a yoke 24 which is interconnected with the carrier via a vertical shaft (not shown). The carrier is displaceable between the illustrated advanced position whereat the illustrated blankmold half will<br><br><br>
4 <br><br>
be in engagement with the other blankmold half and a retracted, mold open position, where the carrier will be proximate the housing, by driving the ball screw with a suitable motor (not shown). Complete details of such a mold  opening and closing mechanism are disclosed in the above referred to U.S. Patent No. 5,830,254, which is incorporated by reference herein.<br><br><br>
Each blankmold half has a series of vertical cooling holes 30 which extend from its top to its bottom. Cooling air is supplied to these cooling holes through a pair of ducts 32, which extend from the bottom to the top of the housing 18 at either side of the housing. These ducts 32 terminate at the top of the housing with a circular recess 34 which receives the bottom of a cylindrical locating sleeve 36 secured within a mounting collar 38 which is fixed to the housing with suitable screws 40 (figure 2). Slidingly received on the top portion of each locating sleeve 36 is an "L" shaped elbow 42 which has a vertical portion 45 having a cylindrical base 44 for sliding onto the sleeve and an upper portion which has a flat vertical face 46 connected to a horizontally extending tube 48.<br>
Associated with each housing is a manifold 49 which will deliver cooling air to one set of the blankmold halves supported by one of the carriers. The free end of each of the tubes (figure 1) is slidingly received by an oil impregnated bronze bushing 50 which is retained adjacent the corresponding inlet 51 of the frame 52 of the manifold 49, by an end cap 54. These plenum inlets 51 communicate with inlets 53 to a plenum chamber 60 which includes three continuous semi circular portions 59 corresponding to the semi-circular tops of three blankmold halves that would be present in an I.S. section producing three bottles each cycle. Each semiannular plenum portion 59 communicates with a semiannular vertical slot 62, defined in a spacer 64 which   is connected to the manifold by means of a number of screws<br>
5<br><br><br>
(not shown) which extend upwardly through the spacer into the manifold frame. These semi-annular slots overlie the series of cooling holes 30 in corresponding blankmolds 10.<br>
The manifold assembly (the interconnected manifold and spacer) sits on top of the carrier 12 with movement relative to the carrier controlled by a pair of vertical screws 66 which are secured to the top of the carrier and which are located in suitable slots 67 in the manifold frame 52 (the manifold assembly may accordingly be lifted to change the blankmold halves) . A set screw 70 secures the elbow 42 to the sleeve 36 accommodating a limited amount of vertical adjustment. To accommodate a much taller set of blankmolds, the sleeves 36 and spacers can be exchanged with taller sleeves and spacers.<br><br>
6 <br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1. A mold opening and closing mechanism for a section of an Individual Section machine comprising<br>
at least one mold half having vertical cooling air passage means,<br>
a mold carrier assembly including carrier/insert means for supporting said at least one mold half and horizontal axially extending shaft means connected to said carrier/insert means,<br>
