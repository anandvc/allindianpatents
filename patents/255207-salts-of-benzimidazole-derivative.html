				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to salts of Benzimidazole Derivative. More specifically, the present invention relates to (1) a process for manufacturing alkali metal salts of 2-[{4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl}methylsulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole which are useful as gastric acid secretion inhibitors, anti-ulcer agents and other drugs and (2) salts of 2-[{4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl}methylsulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole with amines which are intermediates for the production of the alkali metal salts, and a process for manufacturing them.<br>
Background Art<br>
Alkali metal salts of 2-[{4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl}methylsulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole are known to be useful as anti-ulcer agents and the like because they have the effect of inhibiting gastric acid secretion (see for example U.S. Patent Publication 5,045,552). Although salts of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole with amines are known (see for example International Patent Publications (pamphlets) WO 03/74514 and WO 94/27988 and European Patent Publication 124495), salts of 2-[{4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl}methylsulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole with amines are not known.<br>
The crystallization process of salts of compounds such as omeprazole that act as proton pump inhibitors with amines is also not known to be useful for removing impurities and the like.<br>
Moreover, no method is known of obtaining alkali metal salts of 2-[{4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl}methylsulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazolefrom salts of 2-[{4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl}methylsulfinyl]-1 H-benzimidazole with amines.<br>
On the other hand, methods are known of manufacturing a 2-[{4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl}methylsulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole sodium salt in which the content of the impurity (2-[{4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl}methylsulfonyl]-1 /-/-benzimidazole (hereinafter simply referred to as "sulfone") is reduced to between 0.82% and 0.30% (see for example European Patent Publication 1000943).<br>

Process for manufacturing salts of 2-f(4-(3-methoxvpropoxv)-3-methvlpvridin-2-<br>
vl)methvlsulfinvl1-1H-benzimidazole with amines<br>
The compound (2-[{4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl}methylsulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole) (VII) used as the starting material in the manufacturing process according to the present invention can be manufactured by the process described in U.S. Patent Publication 5,045,552 or by the known improvement on this process (for example, Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open Nos. H11-71370 &amp; 2000-143659, International Patent Publication (pamphlet) WO 01/68594, European Patent Publication 1,270,555, etc.). The compound (VII) used as the starting raw material may either include or not include the sulfone, (2-[{4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl}methylsulfonyl]-1 H-benzimidazole) (VI).<br>
An organic solvent and an amine (isopropylamine, sec-butylamine or cyclopentylamine) are added to dissolve 2-[{4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl}methylsulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole (with heating if desired). This solution is then stirred at 30 to -40°C (preferably -20 to -40°C). The stirring time is not particularly limited but is preferably from 1 hour to 1 day or more preferably overnight (from 10 to 12 hours). Crystals are deposited in a step of cooling and stirring.<br>
Seed crystals (a small amount of crystals of a salt of 2-[{4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl}methylsulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole with an amine) may be added or not added during this crystal deposition step. The temperature for adding the seed crystals is not particularly restricted but is preferably 55°C or less or more preferably from 35°C to 0°C. A solvent such as hexane, acetic acid n-butyl ester or f-butyl methyl ether can be added as appropriate before crystal deposition or during step of crystal deposition.<br>
Crystals deposited in the mixture can be filtered out to obtain the target salt of 2-[{4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl}methylsulfinyl]-1 H-benzimidazole with the amine.<br>
The resulting crystals can be washed as necessary in the same solvent used for dissolution. The resulting crystals can then be dried as necessary at room temperature or with heating, either at a normal pressure or under a reduced pressure.<br>
There are no particular limitations on the aforementioned organic solvent, but specific examples of the organic solvent include ester solvents, nitrile solvents, ether solvents, alcohol solvents, ketone solvents, aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents, aromatic hydrocarbon solvents, water and mixed solvents of the foregoing, and one or more solvents selected from the group<br>

Manufacturing Process B<br>
Synthesis of 2-ff4-(3-methoxvpropoxv)-3-methvlpvridin-2-vl)methvlsulfinvl]-1 H-benzimidazole alkali metal salt from salt of 2-K4-(3-methoxvpropoxv)-3-methvlpyridin-2-vl)methvlsulfinvl1-1H-benzimidazole with amine<br>
This step can be accomplished by the ordinary methods of converting amine salts of organic compounds into alkali metal salts thereof.  Specifically, a salt of 2-[{4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl}methylsulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole with an amine is dissolved in 1 to 3 solvents selected from the group consisting of toluene, methanol, ethanol, water, acetone, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, f-butyl methyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, hexane and isopropanol, and about 1 equivalent of a base (sodium hydroxide, sodium ethoxide, sodium methoxide, sodium hydride, potassium hydroxide, potassium ethoxide,<br>
potassium methoxide, potassium hydride or a solution of the foregoing or the like) is added to the mixture and stirred. The 2-[{4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl}methylsulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole alkali metal salt can be obtained by evaporating the solvent from this mixture.<br>
This alkali metal salt can be obtained by crystallization, sedimentation by salt-producing or lyophilization from the mixture or a concentrated residue thereof. This alkali metal salt can also be manufactured by a suitable combination of a step of manufacturing acetone-containing crystals (an acetone complex) of 2-[{4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl}methylsulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole and a high-temperature drying step (International Publication Pamphlet WO 04/085424, European Patent Publication 1000943).<br>
The resulting 2-[{4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl}methylsulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole alkali metal salt can also be dried at 30°C to 60°C under a reduced pressure or at a normal pressure. This drying step can be performed either statically or with shaking, under ventilation if desired.<br>

Manufacturing step of 2-[(4-(3-methoxvpropoxv)-3-methvlpvridin-2-<br>
vl&gt;methvlsulfinvl1-1/-/-benzimidazole<br>
The compound (VII) used as the starting raw material in the manufacturing process according to the present invention can be manufactured by the methods shown below.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
The compound represented by the formula (3x) above (hereinafter simply referred to as "compound (3x)"; the same applies to the compounds represented by the formulae (4x) and (5x)) through compound (5) are all known compounds. (Step 1x)<br>
This step is a step wherein the crude compound (4x) is manufactured by reacting compound (3x) with a chlorinating agent in an inactive solvent and concentrating the resulting reaction mixture. The inactive solvent used in this step is not particularly limited as long as it can dissolve the raw material compounds somewhat without impeding the reaction.  Preferable examples of the inactive solvent used in this step include aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene or xylene, organic acid esters such as methyl acetate or ethyl acetate, ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or dimethoxyethane, halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride or dichloroethane, or the like.   It is<br><br>
especially preferable to use toluene, ethyl acetate, dimethoxyethane or dichloromethane.<br>
Examples of the chlorinating agent used in this step include phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus oxychloride, thionyl chloride or the like can be used as the chlorinating agent in this step, but preferably one is used such as thionyl chloride that can be evaporated together with the solvent.<br>
The reaction temperature for this step varies depending on the solvents, the raw material compounds and the chlorinating agents used or the like, but is generally from -20°C to 50°C or preferably from 0 to 30°C. The reaction time for this step varies depending on the solvents, the raw material compounds, the chlorinating agents, reaction temperature or the like, but is generally from 30 minutes to 6 hours or preferably from 1 to 2 hours.<br>
After completion of the reaction, (1) quenching, (2) concentration and drying of the reaction mixture and (3) purification, etc. are performed as appropriate. To quench the reaction, for example a suitable amount of water or a lower alcohol (particularly ethanol) can be added to the reaction mixture.<br>
After quenching and concentration and drying of the reaction mixture, the reaction mixture can be used as is in Step 2x without any particular purification, and preferably it is used as is after quenching with only slight concentration and drying and purification.<br>
(Step 2x)<br>
This step is a step wherein compound (5x) is manufactured by reacting 2-benzimidazole thiol with compound (4x) obtained in Step 1 in the presence of a base. The inactive solvent used in this step is not particularly limited as long<br><br>
as it can dissolve the raw material compounds somewhat without impeding the reaction, but for example, it is preferable to use alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol or terf-butanol, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene or xylene or a mixed solvent of the foregoing.<br>
The base used in this step is not particularly limited as long as it dissolves to a certain extent in the solvent.  Examples of the base include alkali metal hydrides such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, and sodium hydroxide is preferred. The reaction temperature for this step varies depending on the solvent, the raw material compounds and the base used or the like, but is generally from -20°C to 70°C or preferably from 20 to 70°C.<br>
The reaction time for this step varies depending on the solvent, the raw material compounds, the base, the reaction temperature or the like, but is generally from 30 minutes to 6 hours, preferably from 1 to 2 hours.<br>
After completion of the reaction, compound (5x) can be separated from the reaction mixture by the standard methods.  For example, after completion of the reaction the reaction mixture can be concentrated under a reduced pressure and then extracted with water and an organic solvent not miscible with water (such as dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, n-butyl acetate or toluene), and the organic layer can then be washed with aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and water and concentrated to manufacture compound (5x). After completion of the reaction the reaction mixture can also be washed with water and used in Step 3x without any concentration or purification.<br>
In particular, a highly pure compound (5x) can be manufactured as a crystal using an organic solvent such as the following:<br><br>
ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, f-butyl methyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or dimethoxyethane (particularly diisopropyl ether or f-butyl methyl ether);<br>
nitriles such as acetonitrile (particularly acetonitrile);<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene or xylene (particularly toluene);<br>
alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol or isopropanol (particularly isopropanol);<br>
ketones such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone (particularly acetone);<br>
organic acid esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, dimethyl carbonate or diethyl carbonate (particularly ethyl acetate or diethyl acetate); or<br>
a mixed solvent containing at least two of these solvents.<br>
The amount of solvent used during crystallization varies according to the type of solvent, but is from 3 to 40 ml based on 1 g of compound (5).<br>
(Step 3x)<br>
This step is a step wherein compound (I) is manufacturing by reacting compound (5x) with an oxidizing agent in an inactive solvent. The inactive solvent used in this step is not particularly limited as long as it can dissolve the raw material compounds somewhat without impeding the reaction.  Preferable examples of the inactive solvent include halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform, dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride or dichloroethane, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene or xylene, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol or terf-butanol, or a mixed solvent of the foregoing, with dichloromethane, toluene, methanol, ethanol or a mixed solvent of the foregoing being particularly preferable.<br><br>
Examples of the oxidizing agent used in this step include hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, m-chloroperbenzoic acid, sodium periodate or the like, m-chloroperbenzoic acid being preferably used, in an amount of from 0.3 to 1.1 equivalents based on compound (5x).<br>
The reaction temperature for this step varies depending on the solvent, raw material compounds and the oxidizing agent used or the like, but is generally from -50°C to 0°C, preferably from -40°C to -10°C. The reaction time for this step varies depending on the solvent, the raw material compounds, the oxidizing agent, reaction temperature or the like, but is generally from 30 minutes to 6 hours, preferably from 1 to 2 hours.<br>
After completion of the reaction, compound (I) can be separated from the reaction mixture by the standard methods, for example by performing the following operations in sequence:<br>
(Operation 1): a basic aqueous solution (such as an aqueous solution of an alkali metal hydroxide, particularly an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution) is added to the resulting reaction mixture, followed by vigorous stirring or shaking and then standing, and the organic layer is separated to obtain water layer (a);<br>
(Operation 2): an organic solvent (for example, a halogenated hydrocarbon such as chloroform, dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride or dichloroethane, an organic acid ester such as ethyl acetate, methyl acetate or n-butyl acetate, an aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene, an alcohol including butanol and mixtures of these) is added to water layer (a), followed by vigorous stirring or shaking and then standing, and the organic layer is separated to obtain water layer (b);<br><br>
(Operation 3): the same organic solvent is added to water layer (b), which is then vigorously stirring or shaking and then allowed to stand in a state of a pH of 8.0 to 11.0, and separated to obtain organic layer (a) and water layer (c) (an aqueous buffer solution such as an aqueous ammonium acetate solution or acetic acid can be added here as appropriate);<br>
(Operation 4): the same organic solvent is added to water layer (c), followed by vigorous stirring or shaking and then standing, organic layer (b) is separated and combined with organic layer (a), and water or sodium bicarbonate solution is added to the mixture followed by vigorous stirring or shaking and then standing, after which the water layer is removed and the resulting organic layer (c) is concentrated.<br>
In particular, a highly pure compound (I) can be manufactured as the crystals by crystallization using an organic solvent such as the following after concentration:<br>
ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, f-butyl methyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or dimethoxyethane (particularly diethyl ether);<br>
nitriles such as acetonitrile (particularly acetonitrile);<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene or xylene (particularly toluene);<br>
alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol or isobutyl alcohol (particularly isopropanol);<br>
ketones such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone (particularly acetone);<br>
organic acid esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, dimethyl carbonate or diethyl carbonate (particularly n-butyl acetate); or<br><br>
a mixture of these solvents (particularly a mixture of a nitrile with an organic acid ester).<br>
The water layer (a) obtained by the above Operation 1 or the water layer (b) obtained by the above Operations 1 and 2 can also be used in manufacturing process A without any concentration or purification.<br>
