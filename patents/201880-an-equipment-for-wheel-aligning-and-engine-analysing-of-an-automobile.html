The probes/clips (7) are provided with cables (9) and is located on a cable arm (8).<br>
The wheel aligner consists of two sensor arms (4) and two rear LED cabinets (5). Each sensor arm (4) consist of an arm tube (20), at least one LED (28), a front charge couple device (CCD) camera (27) and a rear charge couple device (CCD) camera (26) and two angle sensors (24) such as clinometers. The sensor arm is provided with an arm holder knob (15) and a handle (18) for proper fitting and handling . The arm holder knob (15) goes into the bush which is attached with a backplate (23) of the sensor arm cabinet (22). A viewing glass (16) is provided so that light from LED can pass through it to the CCD camera. A cable connector (18) is provided on the sensor arm cabinet (22). The front CCD camera (27) with cover (21)  is mounted on the  arm<br><br>
tube (20). A buzzer (25) is provided on the back plate (23) of the sensor am for outputting the audio signals. A keypad (17) is also provided on the front side of the sensor am oabinet (22) to enter the datas acquired through sensor arm.<br>
The rear LED cabinet (5) comprises an LED (37) and a spirit level (32) for leveling the rear LED oabinet horizontally, A lens (36) is provided to focus the light from the LED to the rear CCD camera (28). A viewing glass (30) is provided on the rear LED cabinet (5) for allowing the light to reach the rear CCD camera (26) and a cable connector (31) is provided for connecting the cable. A handle (33) and an arm holder knob (29) are provided on the rear LED cabinet (5) for proper handling and fitting of the rear LED cabinet. An arm holder knob (29) is provided on a back plate (35) of the rear LED cabinet (34).<br>
The sensor arms (4) are mounted to the front wheels for carrying out the two wheel alignment. Each front wheel is fitted with a sensor arm while aligning. The rear LED cabinets are mounted on the back wheels. The LED in the right sensor arm is located such that it can act as a source of light for the front CCD camera (27) in the left sensor arm which is mounted perpendicular to the wheel plane. The rear CCD camera (28) is mounted parallel to the wheel plane so that it can receive light rays from the LED (37) in the rear LED cabinet (34). which is mounted parallel to the wheel plane.<br><br>
The computer comprises a PC motherboard (101), a hard disc (104), a monitor (1) and a keyboard (3). The computer provides the output parameters of wheel alignment and engine analysis with the help of suitable interfaces provided in the unit. The computer is provided with a wheel alignment software and an engine analysis software in the same hard disk (104) and share the system resources available on the computer such as monitor (1) keyboard (3), printer (2), hard disk (104) and system memory without conflicts. An EA connector PCB (109) connects all the cables coming from the engine analyser to an EA interface board (103) and an interface unit (10) consisting of a transformer (110) and a personality board (102) connects all the cables from the wheel aligner to the mother board (101). The personality board interacts with the computer directly. The EA interface board (103) Interacts with PC motherboard (101) through an EAADC card (107) and the PC mother board (101) Interacts with the EA interface board (103) either directly or through the said EAADC card (107). A super video graphic adaptor (SVGA) card (108) is connected in between the motherboard and the monitor since the software is menu driven and provides on line help to the user at various points In the program sequence. The probes and clips (7) provided for engine analysis Interacts with the EA Interface board (103) through the EA connector PCB (109). The output of the EA interface board (103) is also given to a speaker  (25) for audible signal.  It is desirable to provide a<br><br>
voltage stabilizer (112) connected to the AC mains for supplying stabilized voltage to the equipment. Preferably a separate DC power supply (105) provides supply to PC - mother board (101) and EA interface board (103) through an SMPS power distribution PCB (106). The same DC power supply (105) provides supply to hard disk (104). Power supply is also given to the personality board and EA interface board through transformers (110, 111) respectively.<br>
Preferably the equipment is also provided with cable holding (11) and cable clamps (12). For the easy movement of the equipment, it is preferably provided with caster wheels (13).<br>
The wheel alignment procedure is as follows. Initially the vehicle is taken to the pit keeping the front wheels on a rotary plate and rear wheels on a rear wheel slider. Then the front sensor arm and rear LED cabinets are fitted to the wheels. The measurement is carried out and the data is fed to the computer. The computer proceses the measured data and the output is given through the interfacing boards to the printer or to the display or both.<br>
The engine analysis procedure includes connecting all the clips and probes to various parts of the engine for measurement and the measured data is fed to the computer through the EA interface board.<br><br>
For carrying out a four wheel alignment on a vehicle the two rear LED cabinet (5) are replaced with two rear sensor arms consisting of a front CCD camara fixed perpendicular to the wheel plane, an angle sensor, an LED parallel to the wheel plane and another LED perpendicular to the wheel plane and a spirit level to level the rear sensor arm horizontally.<br>
The equipment according to the invention is cost effective and space saving.<br>
The procedure  is less time consuming  since  the wheel alignment  and  the  engine analysis are done  in  the  same bay without moving the vehicle from one bay to the other.<br><br><br>
