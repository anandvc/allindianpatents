DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to laundry detergent compositions suitable for washing both white and coloured fabrics.  The compositions of the invention, which contain a seauestrant, iminodisuccinate or hydroxyiminodi succinate, in controlled amounts, have been found to give improved maintenance and/or restoration of colour fidelity during the wash.  The presence of the seguestrant also reduces dye fading due to chlorine in water, and in addition provides improved stain  removal.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Certain colours used in the textile industry have the tendency to degrade during the laundry process.  Coloured articles may become darker or the colour may change as a result of laundering, thus changing the appearance and shortening the useful life of the articles.   White articles may also become discoloured, for example, yellowed, with time.<br>
It has now been found that new fabrics may be protected against such colour degradation, and the colour fidelity of previously washed fabrics may be restored (ie the degradation reversed) , if the fabrics are laundered using non-bleaching detergent compositions containing controlled amounts of iminodisuccinic acid or its water-soluble salts.<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
The benefits are especially marked if the wash is carried out at low pH.<br>
Fading of coloured fabrics in the wash because of the presence of sodium hypochlorite and other chlorine compounds in water is also a known problem.  It has been found that iminodisuccinic acid and its salts are also effective chlorine scavengers and the inclusion of these compounds also mitigates this problem.<br>
Additionally, the inclusion of these compounds also gives improved removal of certain stains, especially red mud.<br>

The total amount of surfactant present is preferably within the range of from 5 to 60 wt%.<br>
Detergency builders<br>
The compositions may suitably contain from 10 to 80%, preferably from 15 to 70% by weight, of detergency builder.<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
Preferably, the quantity of builder is in the range of from 15 to 50% by weight.<br>
The detergent compositions may contain as builder a crystalline aluminosilicate, preferably an alkali metal aluminosilicate, more preferably a sodium aluminosilicate (zeolite).<br>
The zeolite used- as a builder may be the commercially available zeolite A (zeolite 4A) now widely used in laundry detergent powders. Alternatively, the zeolite may be maximum aluminium zeolite P (zeolite MAP) as described and claimed in EP 384 070B (Unilever) , and commercially available as Doucil (Trade Mark) A24 from Crosfield Chemicals Ltd, UK. Zeolite MAP is defined as an alkali metal aluminosilicate of zeolite P type having a silicon to aluminium ratio not exceeding 1.33, preferably within the range of from 0.90 to 1.33, preferably within the range of from 0.50 to 1.20.<br>
Especially preferred is zeolite MAP having a silicon to aluminium ratio not1 exceeding 1.07, more preferably about 1.00.  The particle size of the zeolite is not critical. Zeolite A or zeolite MAP of any suitable particle size may be used.<br>
Also preferred according to the present invention are phosphate builders, especially sodium tripolyphosphate. This may be used in combination with sodium orthophosphate, and/or sodium pyrophosphate.<br>
Other inorganic builders that may be present additionally or alternatively include sodium carbonate, layered silicate, amorphous aluminosilicates.<br><br>

Especially preferred supplementary organic builders are citrates, suitably used in amounts of from 5 to 3 0 wt %, preferably from 10 to 25 wt %; and acrylic polymers, more especially acrylic/maleic copolymers, suitably used in amounts of from 0.5 to 15 wt %, preferably from 1 to 10 wt%.<br>
Builders, both inorganic and organic, are preferably present in alkali metal salt, especially sodium salt, form.<br>
Other ingredients<br>
The detergent compositions may also contain one or more enzymes.  Suitable enzymes include the proteases, amylases, cellulases, oxidases, peroxidases and lipases usable for incorporation in detergent compositions.<br>
Preferred proteolytic enzymes (proteases) are catalytically active protein materials which degrade or alter protein types of stains when present as in fabric stains in a hydrolysis reaction. They may be of any suitable origin, such as vegetable, animal, bacterial or yeast origin.<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
Proteolytic enzymes or proteases of various qualities and origins and having activity in various pH ranges of from 4-12 are available.   Proteases of both high and low isoelectric point are suitable.<br>
Other enzymes that may suitably be present include lipases, amylases, and cellulases including high-activity cellulases such as "Carezyme").<br>
In particulate detergent compositions, detergency enzymes are commonly employed in granular form in amounts of from about 0.1 to about 3.0 wt%.  However, any suitable physical form of enzyme may be used in any effective amount.<br>
Antiredeposition agents, for example cellulose esters and ethers, for example sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, may also be present.<br>
The compositions may also contain soil release polymers, for example sulphonated and unsulphonated PET/POET polymers, both end-capped and1 non-end-capped, and polyethylene glycol/polyvinyl alcohol graft copolymers such as Sokolan (Trade Mark) HP22.   <br>

Product form<br>
As previously indicated, the compositions of the invention may be of any suitable physical form, for example, particulates (powders, granules, tablets), liquids, pastes, gels or bars.<br>
According to one especially preferred embodiment of the invention, the detergent composition is in particulate form.<br>
If necessary, the IDS may be incorporated in particulate compositions in the form of granules containing an inert carrier material.<br>
Compositions in powder form may be of any bulk density and may be prepared by spray-drying, non-tower granulation, or any combination of these techniques.<br>
According to another especially preferred embodiment of the invention, the detergent composition is in liquid form.<br>
Liquid detergent compositions may be prepared by admixing the essential and optional ingredients in any desired order to provide compositions containing the ingredients in the the requisite concentrations.<br><br>
 15 -<br>
The colour care benefit<br>
The colour benefit associated with the compositions of the invention is twofold:  protection (maintenance) of the colour or whiteness of new fabrics, and restoration (recovery) of the colour or whiteness of previously washed fabrics.<br>
New fabrics, when washed with the compositions of the invention, show reduced colour degradation as compared with fabrics washed in control formulations without IDS.  The fabrics maintain a new appearance even after multiple washing.  This protection or maintenance benefit has been found to apply both to white and to coloured fabrics.<br>
Previously washed fabrics which have already undergone<br>
colour degradation show significant improvements in colour<br>
fidelity when washed using compositions according to the<br>
invention.   Thus colour damage that has already occurred<br>
can be reversed and the new appearance of the fabrics<br>
restored.	<br>
It is believed  that a cause of -the colour degradation resulting from the laundry process may be heavy metal ions, especially iron but also copper, zinc and manganese:  these may originate from the water or water pipes, from washing machine parts, from the detergent composition used, or from the soil present on the fabric.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the colour care benefit obtained according to the present invention may be attributed to the sequestration by the IDS of any heavy metal ions present in the wash liquor.<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
However, it is not known why IDS should be especially effective- in this"regard.   In particular, it is surprising that IDS should be significantly more effective that the more common detergent and highly effective seguestrant, nitrilotriacetate (NTA).<br>
PH of composition<br>
-	■*-<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the composition has a 0.25% aqueous solution pH (in demineralised water at 30°C) not exceeding 10.5, preferably not  exceeding 10.0.   The preferred pH range is from 8.0 to 10.5, more preferably from 8.5 to 10.0.<br>
The colour care benefits of the invention have been found to be especially marked under low-pH conditions.<br>
The wash process<br>
As indicated previously, a further subject of the invention is a process in which white or coloured fabrics are laundered using the composition of the invention.  According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the process is carried out in a wash liquor having a pH not exceeding 10.5, more preferably not exceeding 10.0.<br>
It has been found that the colour care benefits of the invention..-both-protection and recovery, are especially marked when the wash liquor pH is low.<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
Particularly good results are obtained at pH values of from 8.0 to 10.5, preferably from 8.5 to 10.0.<br>
Whilst the invention is also applicable to the machine wash, the two preferred conditions previously mentioned   -  very low pK, and low sequestrant level   -  have especial relevance to the handwash as carried out, for example, in South East Asia.  In that region, it is a common habit to presoak or prerinse the fabrics in water, without detergent, to remove gross soiling.  At this stage the wash liquor pH may be as low as 6.0 to 7.0.   The wet fabrics are then immersed in the main wash liquor (detergent solution).  The additional water imported into the wash liquor from the wet fabrics has the dual effect of diluting the wash liquor (and thus lowering the sequestrant level) and lowering the pH.<br>
Under these conditions, especially significant colour care benefits according to the present invention have been observed.<br>
The chlorine scavenging benefit<br>
The incorporation of IDS has also been found to reduce the fading upon laundering of chlorine-sensitive dyes.  This fading occurs due to the presence of sodium hypochlorite, which is routinely put into supply water for hygiene purposes:  levels of 0.5 ppm are typical.  This causes fading of dyes of a wide range of colours.   The incorporation of IDS in accordance with the present invention can significantly reduce the amount of fading attributable to chlorine in the wash water.<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
The stain removal benefit<br>
A further benefit for the incorporation of IDS has unexpectedly been observed:  a significant improval in the removal of certain highly coloured stains, notably red mud. Better removal of blood and tea stains is also observed.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The invention will now be illustrated in further detail by means of the following Examples, in which parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise stated.  Examples designated with a number illustrate the invention, while examples designated with a letter are comparative.<br><br>

The fabrics were washed.in demineralised water containing copper ions (0.5 ppm Cu2+ ex CuCl2) at a liquor to cloth ratio of 200:1 in tergotometers for 30 minutes at 30PC at 90 rpm.<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
Experiments were carried out at two different pH values, 9.5 and 6.5. the pH adjustment being made by adding sodium hydroxide (the addition of the copper salt having caused a slight drop in pH).<br>
At each pH, experiments were carried out at two different sequestrant levels:<br>
(i)  a sequestrant level of 0.00286 g/1, calculated as equivalent to the concentration in the final rinse when using a detergent composition containing 0.5 wt% of the sequestrant; and<br>
(ii) a sequestrant level of 0.00572 g/1, calculated as equivalent to the concentration in the final rinse when using a detergent composition containing 1.0 wt% of the sequestrant.<br>
Control runs containing no sequestrant, and containing neither copper ions nor sequestrant, were also carried out at each pH.  No detergent ingredients were present in these experiments.<br>
Colour changes were monitored as reflectances differences at 620 nm.   Two different effects are in operation here:  dye fading, which leads to a generally small reflectance increase;  and dye darkening (colour degradation) resulting from the presence of the copper ions, leading to a rather larger reflectance decrease.  Both effects are undesirable and-result"in- deterioration of the appearance of the fabric. Ideally the reflectance difference observed should be close to zero or a small increase (not greater than 3 units, and preferably not greater than 2 units).<br><br>

The results were as shown in the Table below.<br><br>

It will be seen that only IDS gave reflectance differences within the 0 to +3 range under all four conditions.  EDTMP performed well at pH 9.S but not at pH 6.5.  With NTA, dye fading predominated.  This also occurred with EDDS under most conditions.  The inorganic sequestrants, sodium tripolyphosphate and magnesium silicate, had only an insignificantly small protective effect against darkening.<br><br>

Restoration/recovery of coloured fabrics that have been colour-damaged by exposure to copper ions<br>
These experiments demonstrate the benefits of IDS in restoring colour-damaged coloured fabrics.<br>
The fabrics used were cotton dyed with Direct Red 80.   They were pre-treated with demineralised water containing 0.5 ppm Cu2+ ions and having the pH adjusted to 6.5 by means of sodium hydroxide.  The pretreatment was carried out using tergotometers at 3 0°C, 90 rpm and a liquor to cloth ratio of 200:1, then the fabrics were line dried.<br>
The fabrics were then washed in a wash liquor containing 2.5 g/1 of the detergent composition used in Example 3, and 0.5 ppm Cu2+, in 20/6° Ca/Mg French hard water) :  the pH was adjusted from 9.9 to 9.5 using dilute sulphuric acid.   The washes were carried out in tergotometers at 3 0°C, 90 rpm and a liquor to cloth ratio of 200:1.   The washes were followed by two rinses in 20/6° Ca/Mg French hard water containing 0.05 ppm Cu2+ at a liquor to cloth ratio of 200:1, and the fabrics were then line dried.<br>
The sequestrants, where present, were dosed directly into the wash liquor in the amounts indicated in the table below (percentages based on the detergent composition).<br>
The procedure was also repeated using 15-minute handwashes (using a strictly controlled protocol) at liquor to cloth ratios of 25:1 and 7:1 instead of the tergotometer washes at 200:1<br><br>
