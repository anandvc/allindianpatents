				<td>            FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a colored composition comprising a chromophore having two azo acetoacetanilide moieties, wherein said moieties each have at least one poly(oxyalkylene) chain, preferably at least two such chains.   Such colorants exhibit excellent good base stability and lightfastness, particularly when incorporated within certain media and/or on the surface of certain substrates. These poly(oxyalkylene) chains provide solubility in different solvents or resins thereby permitting the introduction of such excellent coloring chromophores within diverse media and/or or diverse substrates. Compositions and articles comprising such colorants are provided as are methods for producing such inventive colorants.<br>
Discussion of the Prior Art<br>
All U.S. patents cited within this specification are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Bis-acetoacetanilide azo pigments, dyes, and dyestuffs generally provide effective and desirable colorations to certain substrates, such as textiles, paper, and the like. However, their use is limited to such a narrow range of substrates and/or media due to the difficulty of solubility, compatability, and migratory problems inherent with such pigments, dyes, or dyestuffs. Such pigments, dyes, and/or dyestuffs have not been widely introduced as colorants within plastics (such as polyolefins, polyurethanes, and the like) due to such physical limitations. However, the utilization of such colorants is highly desired for a number of reasons, foremost the actual colorations available from such specific compounds.<br>
The standard types of polymeric colorants now utilized within plastics (be they<br>
thermoplastics or thennoset types) are primarily poly(oxyalkylenated) compounds, such as triphenylmethanes, methines, and the like (i.e., those found within U.S. Patent U.S. Patent 4,992,204, to Kluger et al.). Some of these colorants exhibit certain problems in association with the catalysts utilized to effectuate plastic formation. For example, the triphenylmethane and methine moieties of such colorants are susceptible to attack by nucleophilic catalysts and their residues. As a result, the colorations provided by such polymeric colorants may be reduced in strength or changed in shade under such circumstances.<br>
There is thus a desire to introduce such polymeric colorants having bis-acetoacetanilide groups therein within different types of compositions and therefore a desire to provide a bis-acetoacetanilide-type colorant containing polyoxyalkylene chains that can be tailored for versatility. Furthermore, there is a need to provide a colorant for introduction within thermoplastic and thennoset compositions which is far less susceptible to degradation due to attack by basic catalyst residues than the standard poly(oxyalkylenated) colorants of use today. To date, there have been no teachings or fair suggestions of such a highly desirable, specific polymeric bisacetoacetanilide colorant within the pertinent prior art or within the colorant industry itself.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
It is thus an object of the invention to provide base stable yellow polymeric colorants for utilization within thermoplastic and thermoset articles. Another object of this invention to provide a yellow polymeric colorant exhibiting amide groups rather than base-susceptible methine moieties, which are thus less susceptible to attack by basic thermoplastic and thermoset catalysts, are easy to process, mixes well within target plastics, and provides excellent colorations within the target finished articles. Yet another object of this invention is<br>
to provide excellent colorations within liquid compositions (such as inks, and the like) through the utilization of water-soluble, liquid polymeric colorants, as noted above.<br>

EXAMPLE 24<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The polymeric 2'-acetoacetoluidide azo yellow colorant (50 g, 67 mmol) from Example 19 and Jeffamine® D-400 (14 g, 34 mmol, sample from Huntsman Corp.) were charged into a 100-ml 3-neck flask. The mixture was stirred and heated to 160-165°C for 1-2 hours while a stream of nitrogen was passed through the mixture to remove from it the water formed by the reaction. The reaction was monitored by Infrared analysis. Upon being cooled to room temperature, 58 g of product Jeffamine® D-400 modified polymeric 2'-acetoacetoluidide azo colorant was collected as a viscous yellow liquid (structure above) with a color-strength of 28 abs./g/L (MeOH) and the maximum absorbency at 389.5 nm.<br>
Compositions of the Inventive Colorants 1. Wax Formulations<br>
0.20g of the colorant from EXAMPLE 22 were diluted in 19.80g of Span® 80. 2g of this mixture were subsequently introduced within 98g of molten paraffin wax. After mixing, the liquid wax solution became a homogeneous yellow composition. The liquid wax solution was then poured into a candle mold with a wick inserted in the middle and subsequently<br>
 allowed to cool. The resultant homogeneous liquid wax solution (prior to cooling) exhibited little or no colorant droplets and the colorant was well dispersed throughout the resultant solid wax candle (after cooling). Furthermore, after removing the solid candle from the plastic beaker, there was no transfer of color from the candle indicating no appreciable migration of the colorant from the solid wax medium.<br>
2. Thermoplastic and Thermoset Formulations<br>
Tests were conducted to determine the extractability and clarity of the inventive bis-acetoacetanilide azo yellow colorants prepared (as described earlier) within certain thermoplastics and thermosets (e.g., polyolefins, such as polypropylene, polyesters, such as polyethylene terephthalate, and polyurethanes, such as polyurethane foams). In all such tested media, the colorants provided excellent, bright yellow colorations therein.<br>
In order to correct for varying color strengths, the colorants were all cut to a consistent color value with a polyethylene glycol 400 NF. This was accomplished by taking a known amount of colorant with a known color value. The amount of diluent added was determined as' follows:<br>
[(Uncut CV/Desired Cut CV) - 1] (Wgt. Of uncut color) = Weight of PEG 400 added<br>
In this case, the preferred colorant was cut to a color value (CV) of 27.<br>
a. Thermoplastics - Polypropylene<br>
For the thermoplastic extraction test, all colorants were loaded into polyolefin resins at 4000 ppm (4% by weight). The polypropylene random copolymer resin used in the extraction study was Fina® 7525. The general procedure for making plaques for extraction,<br>
clarity, and lightfastness testing was as follows. The proper weight of colorant was added to 100 gram of pelletized polyolefin resin. The mixture was then mixed 3 minutes on a laboratory Hobart mixer to insure uniform colorant distribution over the surface of the pellets. The samples were then extruded on a laboratory MPM single screw extruder at 325 F. The resulting colored pellets were then injection molded at 200°C on an Arburg® 25-ton molder into plaques measuring 2" X 3" X 0.05". Background plaques were made by extruding and molding uncolored resin using the same procedure described above.<br>
The procedure for testing extraction on the colored PP plaques prepared above was as follows. Plaques were placed in stainless steel dye kettles. The vessels had Teflon lined tops. The total volume of the container was 200 cc. It required 125 g of extraction solvent to cover the plaques. One plaque was cut in half and placed in each stainless steel pressure vessel.   The two pieces of the plaque were separated by a glass slide.  125 Gram of the extraction solvent (10% EtOH) which had been preheated to 70°C was then poured into the extraction vessel. The vessel was screw closed and placed in a 70°C oven for two hours after which time the plaques were removed from the extraction solutions. The amount of color that was extracted from the plaques was determined by measuring the absorbance of the extracting solution in a 1.0 cm cell on a Beckman® DU-650 Spectrophotometer. The extraction solution from the uncolored plaques was used as a background. The results are summarized below:<br>

Example 13	42.9	0.005<br>
Example 19	34.8	0.006<br>
Thermoplastics - Polyesters<br>
The Yellow polymeric colorants were incorporated into PET resin as follows. In order to correct for varying color strengths, the loading of each color was calculated so that it was equivalent to 0.2% (by weight of the PET) at a color value of 27.0. The color was then mixed onto the surface of dried PET (Shell® 8430) pellets in a Hobart blender. The resulting colored pellets were then injection molded at 200 C on an Arburg® 25-ton molder into plaques measuring 2" X 3" X 0.05". Background plaques were made by extruding and molding uncolored resin using the same procedure described above.<br>

c. Thermosets<br>
Polyurethane foams were produced with the following composition and in accordance with the following prcedure:<br>
Component	Amount fphp of thepolyol content)<br>
F3022Polyol	100 parts<br>
Water	4.53<br>
DABCO TL (catalyst)	0.15<br>

L520 Silicone (from Witco)	1.0<br>
82/20 toluene diisocyanate	43.6<br>
Colorant	1.0<br>
The individual colorants utilized within the example foams were the following: Examples<br>
13, 14, 19, and 20. Upon mixture within a reaction vessel, the reaction created a "health"<br>
bubble, and the vessel was then exposed to 185°C (generated within a microwave oven to<br>
simulate actual temperatures encountered on an industrial production level) for about 10<br>
minutes. The resultant foam bun was then sliced in half and analyzed empirically. All of the<br>
above inventive colorants provided very bright yellow foam articles.<br>
The foam articles comprising the inventive colorants from Examples 13, 14, 19, and<br>
20 were also analyzed for lightfastness by directly exposing each individual article to a<br>
Xenon light for 5,10 and 20 hour duration intervals. Each article exhibited outstanding<br>
lightfastness results as no appreciable discoloration was observed.<br>
There are, of course, many alternative embodiments and modifications of the present<br>
invention which are intended to be included within the spirit and scope of this invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
