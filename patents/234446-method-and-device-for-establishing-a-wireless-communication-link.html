Method for establishing a wireless communication link<br>
The present invention relates to a method for establishing a wireless communication<br>
link between two communication devices. In particular, the invention relates to a<br>
method for establishing a bluetooth audio link between two mobile terminals of a<br>
wireless cellular communication system, e.g. the GSM or the UMTS system. The<br>
mobile terminals are e.g. mobile cell phones, PDAs or the like.<br>
There are a lot of different ways for connecting electronic devices in order to<br>
wirelessly exchange communication data. Nowadays, GSM networks are widely used<br>
for audio communication between at least one mobile terminal and another<br>
communication device. In future, UMTS networks will be available which allow a<br>
significantly higher rate of data transfer.<br>
One of the most interesting technologies for wireless data communication is the<br>
recently developed so-called bluetooth technology. Bluetooth is an international<br>
standard which has been developed by a group of electronics manufacturers that<br>
allows any sort of electronic equipment - e.g. computers, cellular phones, keyboards<br>
or headphones - to establish its own wireless data connection. It is an universal radio<br>
interface using the 2.45 GHz frequency band that has been set aside by an<br>
international agreement for the use of industrial, scientific and medical devices<br>
(ISM).<br>
One of the possibilities bluetooth offers, is that two mobile terminals can connect to<br>
each other and use this communication link to carry audio information back and<br>
forward, thus enabling them to work as two-way radios. Since such a bluetooth link<br>
does not require a communication network such as a GSM network, data<br>
communication using the bluetooth technology would be significantly cheaper than<br>
using a mobile telephone network.<br>
However, the establishment of a bluetooth link requires the called communication<br>
device to be in the so-called Discoverable/Connectable mode which is a state<br>
wherein the communication device is able to receive signals from other bluetooth<br>
devices. Since the communication device does not know when a communication link<br>
according to the bluetooth standard is to be established, it has to stay permanently in<br>
the Discoverable/Connectable mode which might result in significant impairment of<br>
the standby time of portable communication devices. Furthermore, leaving the<br>
communication device permanently in the Discoverable/Connectable mode is not<br>
recommended due to security reasons.<br>
US patent application 2002/0094801 Al discloses a method of operating a<br>
telecommunication system in which a mobile communication device which is sending<br>
and receiving GSM communication data, upon receiving a bluetooth signal from a<br>
fixed station, answers the bluetooth signal by transmitting also bluetooth signals to<br>
the fixed station. This method allows to change from GSM communication to<br>
bluetooth communication to the fixed station provided that a bluetooth link was<br>
successfully established. However, in this method the fixed station permanently<br>
transmits bluetooth signals and the portable communication device is permanently in<br>
the Discoverable/Connectable mode.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for establishing<br>
a wireless communication link - preferably a bluetooth link - that eliminates the<br>
above-described problems.<br>
According to the present invention, a method for establishing a wireless<br>
communication link between two communication devices is provided, said method<br>
comprising the steps of<br>
a) emitting from a first communication device a communication signal for contacting<br>
a second communication device, said communication signal being of a first type<br>
of wireless data communication,<br>
b) activating in said first communication device communication means which are<br>
able to transmit and receive data according to a second type of data<br>
communication,<br>
c) activating in said second communication device upon receipt of said<br>
communication signal communication means which are also able to transmit and<br>
receive data according to said second type of data communication and<br>
d) establishing the communication link according to said second type of data<br>
communication between the communication means of the two communication<br>
devices.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, said first communication signal<br>
is a signal of a wireless cellular communication system, e.g. a GSM signal and the<br>
second type of data communication is a bluetooth link.<br>
With the method according to the present invention, the establishment of the desired<br>
communication link according to the second type of data communication, e.g. the<br>
bluetooth link, is triggered by the communication link according to the first type of<br>
data communication, e.g. the link over the GSM network.. Therefore, the<br>
establishment of the desired bluetooth link is basically handled like a typical GSM<br>
call without the need of keeping the circuitry for the bluetooth communication<br>
permanently activated. In other words, the communication means for the bluetooth<br>
communication are only activated for the time for which a bluetooth communication<br>
is desired. Since the energy for the bluetooth communication is restricted to a<br>
minimum, the standby time of portable communication devices can be significantly<br>
extended.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the first communication<br>
signal for contacting the second communication device is refused by the second<br>
communication device in case the desired communication link according to the<br>
second type of data communication was successfully established. However, if an<br>
establishment of the second communication link - e.g. due to too large distances<br>
between the two communication devices - was not possible, the communication<br>
between the two devices will be continued via the first communication link. The<br>
circuitry for the second type of the data communication is then shut down in order to<br>
save energy.<br>
Preferably, the type of communication link which has been established between the<br>
two communication devices is displayed on the two devices.<br>
The establishment of the desired second type of communication link can be<br>
accelerated if identification information for contacting the other communication<br>
device via this second type of data communication is available. Therefore, in a<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, each communication device comprises<br>
storing means for storing such identification information. According to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the required identification information is<br>
transmitted via the first communication signal when contacting the other<br>
communication device.<br>
The present invention also relates to a wireless communication device which<br>
comprises means for emitting and receiving communication signals according to a<br>
first type of data communication and communication means for emitting and<br>
receiving communication signals according to a second type of data communication.<br>
In order to establish a communication link according to said second type of data<br>
communication with another communication device, controlling means are provided<br>
which automatically activate the communication means if a communication signal<br>
according to the first type of data communication is emitted from or received by the<br>
communication device. The present invention further relates to a wireless<br>
communication system which comprises at least two of such communication devices.<br>
Further advantages, features and details of the present invention will become<br>
apparent from the following description of preferred embodiments with reference to<br>
the drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic view of a wireless communication device in accordance with<br>
the present invention.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a first embodiment of a method for establishing a communication link<br>
in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a second embodiment of a method for establishing a communication<br>
link in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The wireless communication device shown in Fig. 1 is a mobile terminal or portable<br>
telephone 1 for a wireless cellular communication system, e.g. the GSM or UMTS<br>
system. Only the components which are relevant in respect to the present invention<br>
are described.<br>
The portable telephone 1 comprises first an antenna 2 for transmitting and receiving<br>
wireless communication signals. According to the present invention, the portable<br>
telephone 1 is able to transmit and receive communication signals of two different<br>
types of data communication. Therefore, the portable telephone 1 comprises first<br>
communication means 3 for emitting and receiving communication signals according<br>
to a first type of data communication and second communication means 4 for<br>
emitting and receiving communication signals according to a second type of data<br>
communication. Both communication means 3 and 4 are connected to the antenna 2<br>
in order to exchange communication signals provided a respective communication<br>
link has been established. Alternatively, each of the communication means 3 and 4<br>
can be connected to a respective antenna, so that two antennas are provided.<br>
The first and second communication means 3 and 4 are further connected to<br>
controlling means 5 which activate or deactivate the communication means 3, 4<br>
depending on the kind of communication link which has to be established. Said<br>
controlling means 5 are further connected to storing means 6 in which identification<br>
information for contacting other communication devices are stored.<br>
Preferably, the information contained in the storing means 6 comprises identification<br>
information for contacting other devices via the first communication means 3 as well<br>
as via the second communication means 4. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 1 the storing<br>
means 6 are divided in two memories 6a, 6b wherein memory 6a contains<br>
identification information for contacting other communication devices via the first<br>
communication means 3 and the second memory 6b comprises identification<br>
information for the second communication means 4. In a portable telephone as<br>
shown in figure 1, memory 6a is the typical phone book. Preferably, each<br>
information stored in memory 6a is assigned to a second information stored in<br>
memory 6b. Therefore, the storing means 6 comprise for each communication device<br>
to be contacted identification information in respect to the first type of data<br>
communication as well as the second type of data communication.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the steps of a first embodiment of a method in accordance with the<br>
present invention for establishing a communication link. In this embodiment, the<br>
first type of data communication refers to a communication via the GSM mobile<br>
network and the second type of data communication refers to bluetooth<br>
communication. However, it has to be noted that the present invention is not<br>
restricted to GSM and bluetooth communication. E.g. the first communication means<br>
could also communicate via an UMTS network or any other cellular network for<br>
mobile communications while the second type of data communication could be any<br>
kind of communication which provides a direct wireless link between two devices.<br>
Further, the two communication devices which are to be linked could be any kind of<br>
wireless communication devices.<br>
In Fig. 2, a bluetooth link has to be established between the first mobile telephone<br>
11 and the second mobile telephone 21 which might be within the bluetooth range of<br>
telephone 11. In this first embodiment of the present invention, both mobile<br>
telephones 11, 21 are so-called paired to each other since they frequently exchange<br>
communication data via a bluetooth link. As a result of the pairing process,<br>
identification information, i. e. device name, path key, the 48-bit bluetooth ID - of<br>
the respectively other communication device is stored in the memory 6b of each<br>
portable telephone 11, 21. Further, in the memory 6a the GSM number of the other<br>
portable telephone is stored wherein the GSM number and the bluetooth<br>
At the beginning, the bluetooth interfaces of both telephones 11, 21 are deactivated.<br>
In order to establish the desired bluetooth link to the telephone 21, the user of the<br>
first telephone 11 in a first step dials the GSM number of the second telephone 21 in<br>
order to contact the other telephone 21 via the GSM network. At this moment, the<br>
controlling means 5 automatically activate the second communication means 4 and<br>
switch the bluetooth interface of telephone 11 in the Discoverable/Connectable<br>
mode. Telephone 11 is now able to establish a bluetooth link.<br>
When the second telephone 21 gets the call from the GSM network, the controlling<br>
means 5 read the storing means 6 in order to check whether telephone 11 is a<br>
bluetooth partner, i. e. whether bluetooth identification information stored in<br>
memory 6b is associated to the GSM number of telephone 11. Since in the present<br>
example both memories 6a and 6b of telephone 21 contain identification information<br>
in regard to telephone 11, the controlling means of 5 of telephone 21 activate the<br>
communication means 4 for bluetooth communication and start a bluetooth<br>
connection by activating the paging mode in order to find the communication device<br>
which has the stored bluetooth identification number, i.e. in order to contact<br>
telephone 11 via bluetooth.<br>
In case telephone 21 finds telephone 11 within its bluetooth range and can<br>
successfully establish a bluetooth link, the incoming GSM call from telephone 11 is<br>
automatically refused by telephone 21. As a result, both telephones 11 and 21 are<br>
only connected via the bluetooth link and can now work as two-way radios. On the<br>
displays 7 provided at each telephone 11, 21 it is indicated that the connection to the<br>
communication partner is being routed via bluetooth and is therefore completely for<br>
free.<br>
In case telephone 21 is not able to contact telephone 11 via bluetooth, e.g. because<br>
the distance is too high, then the call between both telephones 11, 21 will be handled<br>
as a normal GSM call. Both telephones automatically switch off the bluetooth<br>
communication means 4 in order to save energy. Preferably, the shut down of the<br>
bluetooth interfaces takes place if a bluetooth link cannot be established within a<br>
certain period of time after telephone 11 contacts telephone 21 via the GSM call.<br>
In some cases, there is a certain likelihood that the second communication device -<br>
here the telephone 21 - is already in the Discoverable/Connectable mode. Then, the<br>
establishment of the desired bluetooth link can be accelerated in that the first<br>
telephone 11 - simultaneously with transmitting the GSM call - tries to contact the<br>
second telephone via bluetooth. If the second telephone 21 is indeed already in the<br>
Discoverable/Connectable mode, the bluetooth link can be established right away<br>
without the need of first contacting the second telephone 21 via GSM. However, if<br>
the bluetooth communication means of telephone 21 are deactivated and the first<br>
telephone 11 is thus not able to contact the second telephone 21 via bluetooth, the<br>
link is established following the steps described above.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a variation of the procedure shown in Fig. 2. In this example, the<br>
telephones 11 and 21 are not paired with each other. Again, telephone 11 starts the<br>
communication via a GSM call in order to contact telephone 21 via the GSM<br>
network. Besides that, the bluetooth communication means 4 are automatically<br>
activated and put in the Discoverable/Connectable mode.<br>
In order to allow telephone 21 to contact telephone 11 via a bluetooth link,<br>
identification information is transmitted from telephone 11 to telephone 21 via the<br>
GSM network. As an example, the six last digits of the bluetooth identification<br>
number could be transmitted via the GSM call.<br>
After receipt of the GSM call, telephone 21 activates its bluetooth communication<br>
means and starts a so-called bluetooth inquiry and name discovery in order to find a<br>
bluetooth device in its range whose identification number corresponds to the received<br>
identification information.<br>
In case telephone 21 finds telephone 11 and successfully establishes a bluetooth<br>
connection, the GSM call of telephone 11 is automatically refused by the controlling<br>
means of telephone 21. Again, both telephones 11 and 21 are only connected via the<br>
bluetooth link and work as two-way radios. In case a bluetooth link can not be<br>
successfully established, the call between both telephones 11 and 21 will be handled<br>
as a normal GSM call. The type of communication link which has been established is<br>
again shown on both displays 7.<br>
In this second embodiment it is not necessary to pair both communication devices<br>
before establishing a bluetooth link. However, the inquiry and name discovery mode<br>
requires more time to contact the partner via bluetooth.<br>
As can be seen from both examples, the bluetooth interfaces of both telephones 11,<br>
21 are only activated at the time telephone 11 tries to contact telephone 21. Since the<br>
bluetooth link is triggered by the GSM network, the energy for the bluetooth<br>
communication means 4 is saved and the stand-by time of the telephones is<br>
significantly increased.<br><br><br><br>
