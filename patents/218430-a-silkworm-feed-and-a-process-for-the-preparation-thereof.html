				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to  a silkworm feed and<br>
to   a   process  for  the  preparation   thareof.    In particular,  this invention relates to a  silkworm  feed<br>
which is an alternate to mulberry leaf. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The silkworm being monophagous insect  feeds<br>
on  mulberry  leaves only.  The quantum and  quality of food  of  silkworm directly influences the quantue and<br>
quality  of  concoon  yield.   An  artificial  diet  for silkworm  was suggested in Japan and containing  SOX  or<br>
more  dried  pulverized  mulberry leaves  as  the  basal ingredients.    Subsequently,  attempts  were  made   to<br>
replace the sane by other sources of protein.   However, several distinct disadvantages were associated with such<br>
a  known  feed.  One such disadvantage is that  of  poor accetability.   Another  disadvantage was that  of  poor<br>
survival and growth of worm on such feeds.  Yet another disadvantage was that of the quick spoiling of the feed,<br>
particularly due to fungal attack in rearing bed.<br>
An  object  of  this  invention  ie   to<br>
propose  a  silkworm  feed  and to  a  process  for  the preparation  thereof  which obviates  the  disadvantages<br>
associated with those of the prior art.<br><br>
Another  object  of  this  invention  is  to propose  &amp;  silkworm  feed  and to a process  for  the preparation  thereof and which no longer has  a  limited accetability.<br>
Yet  another object of this invention  is  to propose  a  silkworm  feed  and to  a  process  for  the preparation thereof and which has a long survival.<br>
A  further  object of this  invention  is  to propose  a  si 1 kworm  feed  and to  a  process  for  the preparation  thereof  which no longer spoils  fay  fungal attack.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a silkworm feed comprising 30-40% by weight of mulberry leaf powder, 13-25% by weight of soya powder, 7-13% by weight  of ground nut cake, 5-10% by weight o-f  mulberry<br>
branch powder, 5-10% by weight of Agar, 0.3-0.5% by weight of gallic acid, 3-5% by weight of citric  acid,<br>
3-5% by weight of sucrose, 0.7-1.3% by weight of ascorbic  acid, 0.1-0.5% by weight of sorbic acid,  3-5%<br>
by  weight  of   salt mixture, 0.05-0.1%  by  weight  of<br><br><br>
chioramphenical, 0.3-0.5% fay weight of vitamin Mixture* 0.3-0.6% by weight of propionic acid, 2-SX by might  of<br>
acetic acid and 29—35% by Height of water blended together thoroughly.<br>
Further according to this invention there is<br>
provided a process for the preparation of silkworm feed comprising 30—48% by weight of eulberry leaf powder, 15—<br>
25% by weight of soya powder, 7-13% by weight of ground nut cake, 3-10% by weight of mulberry branch powder,  5—<br>
10% by weight of Agar, 0.3-0.5% by weight of gallic acid, 3-5% by weight of  citric acid, 3—5% by weight  of<br>
sucrose, 0.7-1.3% by weight of ascorbic acid, 0,1-0.5% by  weight  of  sorbic acid, 3-5%  by  weight  of   salt<br>
mixture, 0.05-0.1% by weight of chioramphenical and 2-5% by weight of acetic acid blended together thoroughly  so<br>
as to form a pramix, adding 0.3-0.6% by weight of propionic  acid to 25-35% by weight of water and  adding<br>
the same to the above blended mixture, 0.3-0.5% by weight  of   vitamin mixture was mixed  with  the  above<br>
mixture and the mixture was blended together thoroughly in  order to obtain a silkworm feed, cooking  the  above<br><br>
mixture at an elivated temperature and stirring the sase<br>
immediately to reduce the temperature to about the  stirred  mixture is then suddenly  cooled  down  to<br>
obtain the silk wore. feed.<br>
In accordance with this invention a  silkworm<br>
feed  has 30—40% by weight of mulberry leaf powder,  13— 297. by weight of soya powder, 7-13X by weight of  ground<br>
nut cake, 5-10% by weight of Mulberry branch powder,  3-10%  by  weight of Agar, 0.3-0.9% by weight  of   g"Uic<br>
acid, 3-97. by weight of  citric acid, 3-9% by weight of sucrose,  0.7-1.3% by weight of ascorbic acid,  0.1-*).SX<br>
by  weight  of  aarbic acid, 3-9%  by  weight  of   salt mixture,  0.03-0.1% by weight of  chloramphenical,  0.3-<br>
0.5% by weight of vitanin mixture, 0.3-0.6% by weight of propionic acid, 2-9% by weight of acetic acid and 29-35X<br>
by weight of water mixed together to form a  homogeneous mixture.<br>
Further in accordance with this invention the<br>
silkworm  feed  has  30-40% by weight of  mulberry  leaf powder, 15-25% by weight of soya powder, 7-13% by weight<br>
of  ground nut cake, 5—10% by weight of mulberry  branch<br><br>
powder,  5-10% by weight of Agar, 0.3-0.5% by weight  of gallic  acid,  3-5% by weight of  citric acid,  3-5%  by<br>
weight of sucrose, 0.7-1.3% by weight of ascorbic  acid, 0.1-0.5%  by  weight of corbie acid, 3-5% by  weight  of<br>
salt mixture, 0.05—0.1% by weight of chloramphenical and 2-5% by weight of acetic acid are nixed together to fore<br>
a  premix-  0.3 to 0.6% by weight of propionic  acid  is added to 25-35% by weight of water which is added to the<br>
above  premix.   To this mixture 0.3-0.5% by  weight of vitamin mixture is added to form the silkworm feed.  The<br>
mixture  so  obtained  is  blended  thoroughly  and   is subsequently cooked for 15—25 minutes under 10-15  pound<br>
pressure at an elivated temperature.  The cooked mixture is  subjected to the step of stirring immediately  after<br>
cooking  in order to reduce the temperature  to  75-85°C<br>
and  then this mixture is suddenly cooled down to  0—5°C so as to obtain silkworm feed.  The feed so obtained can<br>
be  preserved  for 20—25 days at the temperature  of  5—<br>
10°C-   For this purpose the mixture is packed  in  dark       "<br>
colour polyethene bags to avoid photochemical reaction.<br><br>
In  I instar rearing, larvas are brushed on<br>
diet provided through semai making hand press Machine by aaking ribbon type strip* (2-2.9 mm thick) on the  tray.<br>
In the II instar diet is provided in similar May on the plastic  nets-   Bed hueidity is kept  90-95X  and  rose<br>
temperature is maintained at 30-32°C. Only one time diet  is  provided in each instar.  After  II  molt  the<br>
larvae are shifted over to mulberry leaf and continued up to end of the rearing.<br>
The silkworm  feed and the process  for  the<br>
preparation thereof is herein described and illustrated in the following examples:—<br>
ESflUPtfi.<br>
365  grams  mulberry leaf powder,  198  grams<br>
soya powder, 95 grams ground nut cake, 78 grams mulberry branch powder, 83 grams agar, 4.50 grams gallic acid* 36<br>
grams citric acid, 37 grams sucrose, 9.50 grams ascorbic acid,  2.50  grams sorbic acid, 36 grams  salt  mixture,<br>
0.18 gram chloramphenical and 35 ml acetic acid ware blended  together thoroughly to form a prmmix.  4.90  ml<br>
propionic acid was mixed into 3000 ml of water which was<br><br>
added to the above premix.  4 grans vitaMin Mixture was added to the above Mixture.  The Mixture to obtained warn<br>
blended  together thoroughly.  The blended  Mixture  Mas then  cooked  for 15-23 Minutes at a pressure  of  1B-15<br>
pound   at   an  elivated   temperature-    The   cooked Mixture/feed  Has  stirred  immediately  to  reduce  the<br>
temperature  thereof  to  about 75-85°C.   The  feed  so obtained  Mas  then  subjected to  the  step  of  sudden<br>
cooling  to a temperature of 0—3°C so as to  obtain  the si 1 kwonm   feed  and  which  can  be  preserved   at   a temperature of 9—19% for a period of 22-25 days.<br><br><br>
