				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF DELMOPINOL AND DERIVATIVES<br>
THEREOF Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of delmopinol or a derivative thereof, as well as to intermediates useful in the production process. Background to the Invention<br>
Delmopinol is the International Non-proprietary Name (INN) of 3-(4-propylheptyl)-4-morpholinethanol (CAS No. 79874-76-3). Delmopinol hydrochloride salt (CAS No 98092-92-3) is intended to be used in the treatment of gingivitis. The structure of delmopinol hydrochloride corresponds to formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Different processes for the production of delmopinol and its salts are known in the art. EP-A-038785 describes several processes to produce this compound. In particular, EP-A-038785 disclosed the preparation of delmopinol by alkylation of a 3-substituted morpholine, by dialkylation of a primary amine with a substituted bis(haloethyl)ether or a substituted diethyleneglycol disulfonate, by reduction of a diketomorpholine, or by transformation of the N-substituent of the morpholone into a hydroxyethyl group. EP-A-0426826 describes a process for the production of delmopinol which comprises a cycloaddition from a morpholine oxide to obtain a morpholine-iso-oxazolidine, a reductive ring opening, followed by transformation of functional groups present in the side chain, and finally alkylation of the nitrogen to yield delmopinol.<br>
The known processes to produce delmopinol are long and require the use of some very toxic reagents, which make their industrial exploitation difficult and expensive. Therefore, the provision of a new process for producing delmopinol is highly desirable. Summary of the Invention<br>
The current invention is based on the surprising realisation that delmopinol, and derivatives thereof, can be obtained by a short and convergent synthesis which takes<br>
place through a reaction between an oxazolidin[2,3-c]morpholine compound and a Grignard compound.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, a process for the production of a compound of formula (I) wherein R1 is an alkyl or aryl moiety, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, or a solvate thereof, including a hydrate,<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
comprises reacting a compound of formula (II) with a grignard compound of formula (III) where X is an halogen selected from CI, Br and I and R1 is an alkyl or aryl moiety, and optionally converting the compound of formula (I) free base obtained into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The inventors have also found an efficient production process of the new oxazolidin [2,3-c]morpholine (II), starting from commercially available diethanolamine which proceeds with high yields and purity. Therefore, a second aspect of the present invention is the provision of a process for the production of oxazolidin[2,3-c]morpholine, which involves the reaction of diethanolamine with a (C1-C4)-alkyl haloacetate yielding the known 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-morpholin-3-one, followed by a reduction reaction, to yield the oxazolidinI2,3-c]morpholine. Both steps can also be joined in a one pot reaction, avoiding the isolation of the 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-morpholin-3-one.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
According to a third aspect of the present invention, the production of a specific grignard compound (MA) is carried out by treatment of a 1-halo-4-propylheptane with magnesium.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the present invention is provided compounds (II) and (IMA). These are useful as intermediates for the production of a compound of formula (IA).<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
According to a fifth aspect of the invention, compounds (II) and (III) are used in the manufacture of a compound of formula (I).<br>
The process of the present invention is an easy and efficient alternative to manufacture delmopinol, derivatives of delmopinol and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, on an industrial scale. The process is advantageous because it is a short and convergent synthesis, it avoids the use of toxic and flammable reagents, it uses mild reaction conditions, and delmopinol is obtained with high yields and high purity. Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
A compound of formula (I) is produced according to the present invention.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In the compound of formula (I), R, is an alkyl or aryl moiety. The aJkyl or aryi moiety can be of any length, can be straight-chain or branched and can be substituted, i.e. can contain atoms other than carbon in the carbon backbone. As used herein, the terms "alkyi" and "aryl" are to be given their usual meanings on the art. Preferably, the alkyl or aryl moiety comprises between 1 and 30 carbon atoms, more preferably between 2 and 20 carbon atoms, for example 6,7,8,9 or 10 carbon atoms. Compounds of formula (I) have been prepared where the R, group is a 1-Propyl, Benzyl, 1-Octyl, 1-Heptyl, 1-(2-ethyl)hexyl or 1-(2-propyl)hexyl group. The preparation of these compounds is described in Examples 6 to 11.<br>
A preferred compound of formula (I) is delmopinol, which is represented below as formula (IA). In delmopinol, R, is a 4-propylheptyl chain.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
According to the present invention, a compound of formula (l) is obtained by a reaction between the oxazolidin[2,3-c]morpholine (II) and the Grignard compound (ill) where X is an halogen selected from CI, Br and I, and R., is an alkyl or aryl moiety as defined above and most preferably a 4-propylheptyl chain. A preferred compound of formula (III), wherein R1 is a 4-propylheptyl chain is depicted as formula (IIIA) below.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Most preferably, the compound of formula (III) is 4-propylheptylmagnesium bromide. As used herein, the term "Grignard Compound" is to be given its standard meaning, which is well known in the art, i.e. an organo-magnesium compound.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, a compound of formula (I) is prepared by reacting a compound of formula (II) with a Grignard compound of formula (III). A preferred<br>
embodiment of this general reaction comprises the production of delmopinol (formula (MIA) by reacting a compound of formula (It) with the preferred Grignard compound of formula (IHA).<br>
The formation of the Grignard compound (111) and its subsequent reaction with the oxazolidine (II) is carried out in a suitable solvent such as ethers (C4-C12) and mixtures of said ethers with (Cs-C8) aliphatic or (C6-C8) aromatic hydrocarbons. Preferably the solvent is selected from the group consisting of diethylether, tetrahydrofuran, methyltetrahydrofuran, dibutylether and the following mixtures: tetrahydrofuran-toluene, tetrahydrofuran-xylene, methyltetrahydrofuran-toluene, methyltetrahydrofuran-xylene, dibutylether-xylene, dibutylether-toluene.<br>
A compound of formula (I), for example delmopinol, obtained by the process of the present invention may be converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, preferably into the hydrochloride salt, and delmopinol salts may be converted into delmopinol, by known methods described in the art. By a way of example, delmopinol hydrochloride can be prepared from delmopinol by reaction with hydrochloric acid in any suitable solvent. Examples of suitable solvents are, for instance, toluene, xylene, methylisobutylketone, dibutylether, methyl-tert-butylether, ethyl acetate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The compound of formula (II) can be obtained by the process summarised in Scheme I, which can be carried out in two steps or as a one pot reaction. As used herein, the term "one pot reaction" is to be given its normal meaning in the art, i.e. the compound of formula (II) is produced in a single reaction vessel, such that at least a proportion of compounds (V) and (VI) are converted to compound (IV), and subsequently compound (II), without the isolation of intermediates.<br>
The alternative to a one pot reaction is a two step reaction wherein formula (IV) is produced in a first step, and the second step of converting (IV) into (II) is carried out separately.<br>
SCHEME I:<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
In formula (VI), X is an halogen selected from CI, Br and I, and R, is a (C1-C4)-alkyl radical. Preferably the compound of formula (VI) is methyl chloroacetate.<br>
The reaction between the diethanolamine (V) and the haloacetate of formula (VI) is preferably carried out in the presence of a suitable base and a suitable solvent. Examples of suitable bases are sodium hydride, sodium metoxide, potassium tert-butoxyde and sodium tert-butoxide. The best results are obtained with potassium tert-butoxide. Suitable solvents are for example tetrahydrofuran, xylene, toluene or dibutylether.<br>
The reaction between the diethanolamine (V) and the haloacetate (VI) can be carried out at a temperature between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent used. Preferably, the reaction is carried out at high temperatures (i.e. slightly less than the reflux temperature of the solvent, for example 50% of the reflux temperature or above, preferably 60%, 70%, 80% or 90% of the reflux temperature) to avoid thickness of the crude mixture by insolubility of diethanolamine alkoxyde at low temperatures. Compound (IV) can be isolated from the reaction medium with high yield as an oil, which can be used without purification in the next step. If required, it can be purified by distillation.<br>
3-Morpholinone (IV) can also be prepared by a process described in the literature (Australian Journal of Chemistry, 1996, vol. 49, pp. 1235-1242). However, this process uses an excess of acylating reagent, it goes through an unstable intermediate and proceeds with low yields.<br>
The reduction of 3-morpholinone (IV) to yield the oxazolidine (II) is carried out using a reducing agent. Examples of reducing agents are sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminum hydride (Vitride), sodium borohydride, lithium aluminiun hydride and sodium bisethoxyaluminum hydride. A preferred reducing agent is sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminum hydride. The reduction reaction is carried out in a solvent selected from a (C8-C8) aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene or xilene and an ether (C4-C12) such as diethylether, tetrahydrofuran, dibutylether, methyl tert-butylether, and diethyleneglycol dibutyl ether.<br>
Preferably, when the process of producing the compound of formula II is carried out in one pot, the alcohols generated during the reaction between the diethanolamine and the compound of formula (VI) are distilled before adding the reducing agent.<br>
The compound of formula (111) can be produced by reacting an alkyl or aryl halide with magnesium. Preferably, the halide is in the terminal or secondary position. In a preferred embodiment, as illustrated in Scheme II, the compound of formula (IMA)<br>
is previously prepared by treating a compound of formula (VII) wherein X is an halogen selected from CI, Br, and I, with magnesium. Any suitable solvent for Grignard reactions such as ethers (C4-C12) and mixtures of such ethers with (C5-Ca) aliphatic or (C6-C„) aromatic hydrocarbons can be used for the formation of Grignard compound. The Grignard compound of formula (III) is not isolated and is used in solution. Its formation is easily detectable by the disappearance of magnesium and the brownish colouration of the solution.<br>
SCHEME II:<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
The compound of formula (VII) can be prepared from the corresponding hydroxy compound of formula (VIII) by an halogenation reaction.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Preferably in the compound of formula (VII), X is bromine and is preferably obtained by a brominating reaction of the compound (VIII) with aqueous hydrobromic acid. The compound of formula (VIII) can be prepared by the process described in Justus Liebigs Annalen Chemie ,1966, vol. 693, p. 90, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
