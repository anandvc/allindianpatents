PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
Field of Invention<br>
The invention relates to a temper proof seal made from polycarbonate plastic material and having stainless steel twisted wire moulded itself in temper proof seal male and female part.<br>
Prior Art<br>
ORDINEKY PLASTIC/SEALS<br>
Ordinary seals are made up of PP or HDP material having no UV resistance.<br>
Plastic/Lead seals are opaque so inside tempering cannot be easily visible.<br>
a)	Easy to tamper<br>
b)	Tamper attempts are not easily evident<br>
c)	Easy to re assemble usually Single wire<br>
d)	One can cut and change seal wire easily<br>
e)	Plastic seals can withstand to 120° C so it can be easily tamper by boiling<br>
Consecutive numbering is tough to do on lead seals. General plastic seals have printed or itching type number on male or female portion of the seals and it can be easily duplicated.<br>
Cheaper plastics quickly deteriorate due to weather and other harsh conditions lead seal suffer from corrosion made from single plastic material. Usually low quality.<br>
Tool require for lead seals as well as plastic seals.<br>
Impossible with lead seals. Ordinary Plastic seals do not offer this level of customization.<br>
Therefore there is a need to prevent such tempering of seal, with double locking system using polycarbonate male female part which are push fit, the male part and<br><br>
the female part are connected by non-corosive and non- magnetic stainless steel wire which are moulded while making the seal<br>
To manufacture the temper proof seal first of all we have to pre heat the Polycarbonate plastic materials at 110 ° C in drier for three to four hours before using. And mean time Stainless steel wire is tested first in dimension and acid test and then it is twisted in twisting machine up to desired twist and then it is cut by cutter to required length.<br>
First we put pre heated Polycarbonate plastic materials granule in Vertical type molding machine and then mould of seal is been closed by hydraulic pressure of machine and then wire is insert in mould and then material is been injected in mould through moulds machine and hence temper proof seal is got ready.<br>
The emboss type numbering arrangement on male and side of female part of the temper proof seal is itself in the mould and the constructive numbering is obtain -in all The temper proof seals by automatic arrangement of numerator counter inserted in mould itself.<br>
Then these temper proof seals are tested by pullout test, Acidic test and arranging in serially, tide with the steel wire forming a loop and the same shall be packed in polythene bag with labels furnishing sr. nos. of seal, packed in corrugated box.<br>
1.	These seals are made up of plastic (Polycarbonate) which have a melting point of 270° C and have transparent property so tempering can be easily detect.<br>
2.	These seal are having Anchor type double locking arrangement with molded Stainless Steel wire in male &amp; female part of seal so that male and female part of seal can't be separated after locking.<br><br>
3.	These seal have emboss type seven digit unique numbering of male and side of female part and have arrangement of providing company logo on both side of female part.<br>
4.	These seals are having properties to withstand in all whether conditions.<br>
5.	These seals are withstood in the acid test to stop the tempering of the seals.<br>

The invention will now be clear from the Figure (1) in the accompanying drawing. Figure (1) is the perspective view of temper proof seal.<br>
Detail description of the drawing<br>
Referring to figure (1) a male part (1) and a female part (2) with base (3) and (4) respectively made from polycarbonate plastic material wherein the male part having V-shaped projection (5) and (6) with complementary groups (7) and (8) in the female parts for double locking in a push fit manner said base member (3) of male part and the base member (4) of female part is mouldably connected by a double stand stainless steel twisted wire (9).<br>
Power unity has also started demanding the supply of meters with plastic seal. This type of seals are specially designed for the purpose of meter manufacturer considering easy operation, handling and low cost. The specially designed seals have in built seal wire. One has to simply insert the seal wire end through hole via meter and insert male part into female part by applying pressure through thumb and it<br><br>
will be fitted permanently. The seal once fitted can not be removed unless it is broken or cut through sharp object. For sealing of seal no tool is required.<br>
This is a plastic seal made from polycarbonate material which is transparent so that the inside can be visible frotn out side. The male part (1) having a "V" shaped configuration with inwardly directed flange (5), (6) at least two which when pushed in the female part (2) having complementary grooves (7), (8) locked the further movment of the male part there was in built base (3) which is connected to the base (4) of the female part though wire, so that the material is sealed through the wire will be permanently locked and as such the material cannot be tempered.<br>
This is pilproof seal comprising a male part &amp; female part made from polycarbonate wherein a twisted double stand steel wire is mouldably connected to the base of the male part &amp; female part , said male part having double notch &amp; V shaped projection &amp; said female part having complementary grooves to arrest the projected part when pushed in to the female part permanentely locking the male &amp; female part together which has serial numbers &amp; firm's name or client logo / name on the male part inside the female whiles moulding which can be seen from outside due to transparent character of polycarbonate.<br>
There are many utility services which requires strictly monitoring of the reading such as electric meters and materials supplied to the chent so that the original material is supplied without adulations. These are effected by a packaging system wherein a tempered proof se«tf is essential to establish the original of the substance supplied to the chent. The client by seeing the logo or the serial number can identify the material where the seal is intact nowadays most often it is found that some unauthorized person with mingle with the seal &amp; adulated the materials thereby the correct material is not reached to the client, whenever the seal is broken its evident that the tempering thus occurred. Therefore there is a need to develop temper proof ,seal which prove the originally of material<br><br>
A temper proof seal wherein the male part made from plastic material wherein the base rectangular configuration wherein the said wire is embaded mouldably and on the back of the base member by embossing numerical letters, loges, names provided for identification and on the male part outwardly projected portion.<br>
A temper proof seal wherein the female part made from polycarbonate material wherein a hollow box type construction to receive the male member having inner groups atleast two receive the projected V-shaped projections when pressed fit a base embaded with steel wire in continuation of the male member is provided while moulding so that when pressed fit the seal is permanently locked wherein the loop portion of the wire between the base members are used for fastening to the electric meters so that the electric meters cannot be tempered.<br>
The seals are available in (1) Polycarbonate material and (2) Polypropylene material as per the requirement of the client.<br>
