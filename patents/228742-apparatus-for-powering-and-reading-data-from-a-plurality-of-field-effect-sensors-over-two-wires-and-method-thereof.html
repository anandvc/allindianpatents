				<td>APPARATUS FOR POWERING AND READING DATA FROM A PLURALITY<br>
OF FIELD EFFECT SENSORS OVER TWO WIRES AND METHOD THEREOF<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority from United States Provisional Patent Application<br>
60/464,613, filed on April 22,2003, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. The Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for interconnecting a field effect sensor<br>
with a control system or controlled device using only two wires, and in particular to apparatus for<br>
powering and reading data from a plurality of field effect sensors over two wires and method thereof.<br>
2.	The Prior Art<br>
Mechanical switches are sometimes used to detect change in position of a mechanical<br>
part or level of a fluid, among other things. Such uses are particularly prevalent in<br>
automotive applications. For example, mechanical switches have long been used in<br>
automobiles to sense parameters such as throttle position and windshield washer fluid level.<br>
Although mechanical switches have been refined extensively over the years, they<br>
nevertheless are inherently prone to failure because they include moving parts. Further, such<br>
switches are often used in connection with mechanical linkages which also are inherently<br>
prone to failure and which add cost, weight, and complexity.<br>
Field effect sensors have been used as replacements for mechanical switches in many<br>
applications. Indeed, field effect sensors can be used to sense proximity of a mechanical part<br>
or a liquid. Field effect sensors have many advantages over mechanical switches. For<br>
example, they have no moving parts which can wear out or break. Also, they can be<br><br>
inexpensively mass-produced and customized for use in applications that would not readily<br>
accommodate mechanical switches.<br>
Mechanical switches in their simplest form are two-wire (input and output) devices<br>
that mechanically make or break an electrical circuit They operate using mechanical force<br>
and do not require electrical power for their operation. Conversely, field effect sensors are<br>
solid state-devices which require electrical power for their operation. Accordingly, a field<br>
effect sensor typically requires at least one more wire for its operation than does a mechanical<br>
switch. As such, known field effect sensors typically cannot be used as drop-in replacements<br>
for mechanical switches without some modification to the apparatus into which they would<br>
be installed.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENT<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a first preferred embodiment of the present invention wherein first,<br>
second and third field effect sensors S1,S2,S3 are connected to power supply 10 over two<br>
wires 12,14 in a daisy chain configuration. Sensors S1,S2,S3 preferably are embodied as<br><br>
field effect sensors using a TS100 integrated control circuit available from TouchSensor<br>
Technologies, LLC of Wheaton, Illinois. A corresponding load resistor LR1,LR2,LR3 is<br><br>
connected to the output of each sensor S1,S2,S3, respectively. Each load resistor<br>
LR1,LR2,LR3 has a unique value of resistance. Other embodiments can use more or fewer<br>
man three sensors and corresponding load resistors. Detection circuit 18 detects the current<br>
drawn by sensors S1,S2,S3. In the illustrated embodiment, detection circuit 18 includes sense<br>
resistor 16 between power supply 10 and sensors S1,S2,S3. Detection circuit 18 detects the<br>
voltage drop across sense resistor 16 and provides an output line Vout to a suitable decoding<br>
circuit, for example, an analog to digital converter, as would be known to one skilled in the<br>
art. The design of detection circuit 18 is not critical to the invention. The design shown in<br>
FIG. 1 is for illustration and can be varied or substituted with another design as would be<br>
known to one skilled in the art<br>
When none of sensors S1,S2,S3 is activated, sensors S1,S2,S3 draw a baseline current<br>
from power supply 10. This baseline current can be detected as a voltage drop across sense<br>
resistor 16 or in any other suitable manner, as would be known to one skilled in the art.<br>
Typically, this baseline current will be negligible and, accordingly, will produce a negligible<br>
voltage drop across sense resistor 16.<br>
When any of sensors S1,S2,S3 is activated through touch or proximity of an object or<br>
fluid, additional current is drawn from power supply 10 in response to the sensor activation.<br>
This additional current is a function of the value of the load resistor connected to the activated<br>
sensor's output Because each load resistor has a unique value of resistance, this additional<br>
current varies depending on which of sensors S1,S2,S3 is activated. This additional current<br>
can be detected as an additional voltage drop across sense resistor 16 or in any other suitable<br>
manner, as would be known to one skilled in the art.<br>
By monitoring the baseline current (or corresponding voltage drop across sense<br>
resistor 16) and changes thereto, it can be readily determined which, if any, of sensors<br><br>
S1,S2,S3 is activated at any particular time. Indeed, load resistances LR1,LR2,LR3 can be<br>
selected such that a unique additional current is drawn for each unique combination of<br>
sensors S1 ,S2,S3 activated simultaneously. Thus, it can be readily determined which<br>
combination, if any, of sensors S1,S2,S3 is activated at any particular time.<br>
For example, FIG. 1 illustrates an embodiment having a nominal 5 volt power supply<br>
10, a 125 ohm sense resistor 16 and 1.25 K-ohm, 2.5 K-ohm, and 5K-ohm load resistances<br>
L1,L2,L3, respectively. These specific values are provided here for illustration and can vary<br>
to meet the demands of any particular application, as would be known to one skilled in the<br>
art. As discussed above, negligible current is required to power sensors S1,S2,S3 when none<br>
of them is actuated. Thus, when none of sensors S1,S2,S3 is activated, the voltage drop<br>
across sense resistor 16 is negligible and the output Vout of detection circuit 18 is 0 volts. If<br>
sensor S3 is activated and sensors SI and S2 are not activated, the current through sense<br>
resistor 16 is substantially equal to the current through load resistor LR3, producing a<br>
corresponding voltage drop across sense resistor 16. Based on this voltage drop, detection<br>
circuit 18 outputs a signal Vout of 0.714 volts. Based on this output voltage, the decoding<br>
circuit (not shown) determines mat sensor S3, but not sensors S1 and S2, must have been<br>
activated. Similarly, if sensors S1 and S2 are activated and sensor S3 is not activated, the<br>
current through sense resistor is substantially equal to the sum of the currents through load<br>
resistors LR1 and LR2, producing a corresponding voltage drop across sense resistor 16.<br>
Based on this voltage drop, detection circuit 18 outputs a signal Vwt of 4.28 volts. Based on<br>
ibis output voltage, the decoding circuit (not shown) determines that sensors SI and S2, but<br>
/ not sensor S3, must have been activated. The table in FIG. 1 illustrates that a unique output<br>
Ym is produced for each unique combination of sensors activated at any given time. Based<br>
on the value of Vout at any particular time, the decoding circuit determines which individual<br><br>
sensor or combination of sensors is activated at that time.<br>
FIGS. 2A and 2B illustrate a second embodiment of the present invention wherein a<br>
capacitor is used as a temporary local power supply for a field effect sensor. Referring to<br>
FIG. 2 A, power input 102 of field effect sensor 100 is coupled through isolation diode 110 to<br>
a pulse generator and detection circuit via line 108. In a preferred embodiment, the pulse<br>
generator and detection circuit is embodied as microcomputer 106 having areconfigurable<br>
port 104 to which line 108 is connected. Output 112 of field effect sensor 100 is coupled to<br>
port 104 through switched resistor 114 and FET 116. Port 104 selectively functions as an<br>
input port and output port, as discussed below. Capacitor 117 is coupled between ground and<br>
the node coupling diode 110 and power input 102 of sensor 100. Pull-down resistor 118 is<br>
coupled between ground and the node coupling sensor 100 output 112 and the gate of FET<br>
116. A first terminal of pull-up resistor 120 is connected to a source of electrical potential, in<br>
this example, a 5 V source. The second terminal of pull-up resistor 120 is connected to line<br>
108. Pull-up resistor 120 is shown as a discrete component separate from microcomputer<br>
106. Alternatively, pull-up resistor 120 could be integral with, or its function otherwise could<br>
be provided by, microcomputer 106, as would be known to one skilled in the art.<br>
With, port 104 configured as an output port, microcomputer 106 outputs a pulse<br>
through port 104 over line 108 and through isolation diode 110. This pulse powers sensor<br>
100 and charges capacitor 117. In the subsequent no-pulse condition, the energy stored in<br>
capacitor 117 continues to power sensor 100 for a short period of time. During this time,<br>
with port 104 reconfigured as an input port, microcomputer 106 can read data from line 108.<br>
When sensor 100 is not activated, output 112 of sensor 100 is low and FET 116 is in<br>
the "off' state. In this state, no current flows through FET 116. Thus, the potential at line<br>
108 is at 5 V. Microcomputer 106 senses this voltage through port 104 (while port 104 is<br><br>
configured as an input port) and determines, based on the sensed voltage, that sensor 100 is in<br>
the not activated condition.<br>
When sensor 100 is activated, output 112 of sensor 100 is high, switching FET 116 to<br>
the "on" state. In this state, current flows from the 5 V source, through FET 116, to ground.<br>
Pull-up resistor 120 and switched resistor 114 function as a voltage divider, wherein the<br>
voltage at the node between these two resistors is between 0V and 5 V. Microcomputer 106<br>
senses this voltage through port 104 (while port 104 is configured as an input port) and<br>
determines, based on the sensed voltage, that sensor 100 is in the activated condition.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2B, the principles of this embodiment of the present invention can<br>
be applied to operate and read multiple sensors 100 using a single pulse generator and<br>
detection circuit. FIG. 2B differs from FIG. 2A in that FIG. 2B illustrates a second sensor<br>
100' and corresponding circuitry (namely, sensor input 102', sensor output 112", capacitor<br>
117', diode 110', FET 116', switched resistor 114*, and pull-down resistor 118') coupled to<br>
microprocessor 106 through line 108 and port 104. The circuitry corresponding to sensor<br>
100' is generally the same as the circuitry corresponding to sensor 100, except that switched<br>
resistors 114 and 114' have different values of resistance. Thus, when sensor 100 is activated<br>
and sensor 110' is not activated, a first voltage is present at the node between pull-up resistor<br>
120 and switched resistors 114 and 114'. Based on the value of this first voltage,<br>
microprocessor 106 determines that sensor 100 is in the activated condition and sensor 100' is<br>
in the not activated condition. Likewise, when sensor 100' is activated and sensor 110 is not<br>
activated, a second voltage is present at the node between pull-up resistor 120 and switched<br>
resistors 114 and 114'. Based on the value of this second voltage, microprocessor 106<br>
determines that sensor 100' is in the activated condition and sensor 100 is in the not activated<br>
condition. Similarly, when both sensors 100 and 100' are activated, a third voltage is present<br><br>
at the node between pull-up resistor 120 and switched resistors 114 and 114'. Based on the<br>
value of this third voltage, microprocessor 106 determines that both sensors 100 and 100' are<br>
in the activated condition. Additional sensors and corresponding circuitry can be coupled to<br>
line 108 and operated and read in this manner, as would be known to one skilled in the art.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a third embodiment of the present invention wherein power input<br>
202 of sensor 200 is coupled to a pulse generator and detection circuit, for example,<br>
microcomputer 206, via line 208 and output 212 of sensor 200 is coupled to line 208 via FET<br>
216 and load resistor 214. Pull-down resistor 218 is coupled between ground and the node<br>
coupling sensor 200 output 212 and the gate of FET 216. A first terminal of pull-up resistor<br>
220 is connected to a voltage source, for example, a 5 V source, and the second terminal of<br>
pull-up resistor 220 is connected to line 208. Load resistor 214 and pull-up resistor 220 each<br>
preferably have a value of about 100 ohms. As in FIGS. 2A and 2B, pull-up resistor 220 is<br>
shown as a discrete component separate from microcomputer 206. Alternatively, pull-up<br>
resistor 220 could be integral with, or its function otherwise could be. provided by,<br>
microcomputer 206, as would be known to one skilled in the art.<br>
When sensor 200 is not activated, its output 212 is low. Thus, FET 216 is in the "off'<br>
state. In this condition, the full voltage provided from microcomputer 206 is applied to<br>
sensor 200. When sensor 200 is activated, output 212 is high, switching transistor 216 to the<br>
"on" state. In this condition, pull-up resistor 220 and load resistor 214 form a voltage divider,<br>
and the voltage applied to sensor 200 is substantially equal to the voltage drop across load<br>
resistor 214. Microcomputer 206 senses the voltage applied to sensor 200 and thus<br>
determines whether sensor 200 is activated or not.<br>
In alternate embodiments, pull-up resistor 220 can be omitted and/or current sensing<br>
techniques can be used to detect whether sensor 200 is activated or not. As discussed above,<br><br>
when sensor 200 is not activated, FET 216 is in the "off" state and the only current through<br>
line 208 is the negligible current required to power sensor 200. Microcomputer 206 perceives<br>
this condition as an open circuit, as it would a mechanical switch with open contacts. When<br>
sensor 200 is activated, transistor 216 is in the "on" state, enabling current through load<br>
resistor 214. Microcomputer 206 detects the increased current and determines that sensor 200<br>
is activated. Indeed, if load resistor is selected to have a sufficiently low value of resistance,<br>
for example, 100 ohms, microcomputer 206 perceives the current through load resistor 214 as<br>
a dead short, as it would a mechanical switch with closed contacts.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a fourth embodiment of the present invention wherein a battery 320<br>
provides power to sensor 300. Output 312 of sensor 300 is coupled to the gate of FET 316<br>
and to pull-down resistor 318. When sensor 300 is not activated, output 312 is low, and FET<br>
316 is in the "off' state, emulating a mechanical switch with open contacts. When sensor 300<br>
is activated, output 312 is high, switching FET 316 to the "on" state, emulating a mechanical<br>
switch with closed contacts. Sensor 300 with battery 320 can be used as a drop in<br>
replacement for a mechanical switch because it does not require any wiring beyond that<br>
provided for the mechanical switch. The sensor input and output can simply be connected to<br>
the same wires to which the former mechanical switch was connected.<br>
While several embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described<br>
above, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that numerous modifications can be made<br>
without departing from the spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined by the claims<br>
