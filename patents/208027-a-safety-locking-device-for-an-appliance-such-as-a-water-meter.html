This invention relates to a safety-locking device for appliances such as a water meter that are fitted between two tubular ends.<br>
Water meters commonly have threaded inlet and outlet ends and are fitted between two tubular ends by means of threaded sleeve nuts and flanged adaptors for measuring the flow of water through the pipe. Usually a pipe valve is provided at the inlet end and another at the outlet end of the water meter. The whole assembly usually kept outside the house is enclosed within a brick housing and covered by a metal plate that is locked to the said housing by a padlock. As time goes by the metal plate at the top undergoes rusting and gets damaged. A person who wants to steal the water meter can gain access into the chamber through the damaged metal plate and remove the water meter with the help of only a spanner that engages the internally threaded sleeve nut. Several instances where a number of water meters in the neighbourhood have been stolen in one night have been reported. The object of this invention is to provide a safety-locking device for appliances such as a water meter (that are fitted between two tubular ends), which would make the unauthorized removal of the appliance by a simple tool such as a spanner difficult. It is another object of this invention to provide a simple and strong safety-locking device so that it is economical and long lasting.<br>
Accordingly this invention provides a safety locking device for an appliance such as a water meter W of the type having externally threaded inlet and outlet tubular ends (I and O) capable of being fitted by internally threaded sleeve nuts N (having an inward flange F at one end) between the two main pipe ends P, Q through tubular adaptors T having at one end an outward flanged edge G dimensioned to be held within the said internally threaded sleeve nut N against the said inward flange F of said sleeve nut when the appliance is fitted, said safety locking device comprising two sleeves L, one of the sleeves L being dimensioned to slide over an internally threaded sleeve nut N and the other sleeve on the other sleeve nut respectively, at least one of said sleeves L being provided with a limb member M extending towards the other sleeve, means for fitting a padlock between the two limb members M and M or between one limb member M and the other sleeve L being provided, the arrangement being such that when the padlock is fitted on the said safety locking device the sleeves L cover the said internally threaded sleeve nuts N in the fitted position of the appliance and when the padlock is removed the sleeves L can be displaced sideward away from the said internally threaded sleeve nuts N to expose the sleeve nuts N for removing the appliance.<br><br>
Preferably the sleeves L are provided at their remote ends with an inward flange H dimensioned to abut on the said internally threaded sleeve nut N when the sleeve is pulled towards the appliance. Alternatively the appliance itself may be dimensioned to abut on the inner ends of the sleeves L so as to make inward displacement of the sleeves L impossible in the locked position of the safety device. This can also be provided by a tight fitting washer provided on the inlet and outlet limbs of the water meter central to the sleeve nuts N. The means for fitting a padlock comprises the provision of holes E at the adjacent ends of the said two limb members M, the limb of the padlock capable of being passed through the said holes for locking the two sleeves together. The body of each said tubular adaptor T has a length greater than the length of the body of the respective internally threaded sleeve nut N enabling the sleeve nut N to be displaced sideward.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein: Fig.l: is the pictorial view of a water meter fitted on to the inlet and outlet main pipe ends and provided with the safety-locking device according to the invention; Fig.2: is the exploded view of the safety-locking device according to the invention; Fig.3: is the sectional plan of the inlet end of the water meter fitted with the safety locking device, the horizontal sectional plan passing through the limb member M shown in Fig.l.<br>
As shown in the figures the water meter W having externally threaded inlet and outlet tubular ends (I, O) is capable of being fitted by internally threaded sleeve nuts N (having an inward flange F at one end) between the two main pipe ends P, Q through tubular adaptors T having at one end an outward flanged edge G dimensioned to be held within the said internally threaded sleeve nut against the said inward flange F of said sleeve nut when the appliance is fitted. Resilient washers S prevent leakage at the joints. It is customary to provide a pipe valve at each end of the water meter and these are denoted as V in the figures and the central ends of the pipe valves in the embodiment shown constitute the main pipe ends P and Q between which the water meter is fitted. The fitted position of the safety- locking device on the water meter is shown in Fig.l. The safety-locking device should have been introduced over the tubular adaptors T before fitting the adaptors on to the pipe valves. The safety locking device in the embodiment shown comprises of two parts, each part comprising a sleeve L dimensioned to slide over the respective sleeve nut N and a limb member M extending towards the other sleeve. Each limb member M is provided with an ear R towards its central end, said ear R being orovided with a hole E. The Hmh<br><br>
of a padlock is passed through the two holed ears R and the padlock locked. The inward flange H provided at the remote ends of the sleeves L prevents central displacement of the sleeve L. This central displacement may also be prevented by an extra long sleeve L, or by a tight fitting washer provided on the inlet and outlet limbs of the water meter central to the sleeve nuts N. In the locked position of the padlock on the safety-locking device, the sleeves cannot be displaced towards the periphery or towards the center from over the sleeve nuts N and it is not possible to apply a spanner to loosen the sleeve nuts N. Removal of the water meter is thus rendered difficult. The other joints of the pipe system are more difficult to be loosened when compared to the simple fitting of the water meter at the sleeve nut N. Removal of several locked water meters at a stretch in one night is thus rendered difficult making it unattractive for the thief who wants to sell them together in the old market. When the padlock is unlocked the sleeves can be displaced towards the periphery so as to expose the sleeve nuts N for removing the water meter. The locking device may be made of cast iron to make it economical and strong. The reading of the water meter can be taken without removing the padlock.<br><br><br><br><br>
I claim:<br>
