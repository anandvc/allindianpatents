MANUFACTURING METHOD FOR PRESTRESSED STEEL COMPOSITE<br>
GIRDER AND PRESTRESSED STEEL COMPOSITE GIRDER THEREBY<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(a)	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a prestressed<br>
steel composite girder having a lower flange of the steel girder reinforced with<br>
concrete, and a steel composite girder manufactured using the same, and more<br>
particularly, to a method of manufacturing a prestressed steel composite girder for<br>
previously introducing compressive prestress on concrete in order to compensate<br>
for tensile stress generated during common use and a steel composite girder<br>
manufactured using the same.<br>
(b)	Description of the Related Art<br>
Generally, it is known in the art that concrete is resistant to compressive<br>
stress but not resistant to tensile stress. A prestressed steel composite girder has<br>
been designed to compensate for the tensile stress generated when applying live<br>
and dead loads for the compressive prestress.<br>
Conventional engineering methods for previously introducing<br>
compressive stress to concrete to provide a resistive cross-section can be classified<br>
into the following three kinds of technologies depending on a method of<br>
introducing the compressive prestress and material composition for the resistive<br>
cross-section.<br>
First, as a most common and fundamental engineering method for<br>
introducing the compressive prestress into a concrete by using only tension (i.e., a<br>
prestress force) of a tendon, a prestressed concrete (PSC) beam has been known in<br>
the art. In a conventional PSC beam engineering method, a resistant force is given<br>
to the concrete by artificially estimating stress distribution and strength and<br>
adopting a high strength steel (generally referred to as a tendon) for compensating<br>
for the tensile stress generated by an external force up to a certain point.<br>
In order to overcome mechanical shortcomings of the conventional PSC<br>
beam, in other words, in order to increase resistance strength for a tension crack that<br>
can occur in an upper surface of the beam cross-section when introducing tension<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/065085	PCT/KR2005/004320<br>
and reduce the height of the beam with respect to the same effective span, another<br>
improved technology has been proposed in a Korean unexamined patent<br>
application publication No. 10-2004-0058542, entitled "A Prestressed Steel<br>
Reinforced Concrete Unit Beam and Manufacturing Method Thereof". In this<br>
technology, a T-shaped steel plate is inserted into upper and lower flanges of the<br>
conventional prestressed concrete beam. Specifically, steel strands are provided in<br>
sheath pipes installed in the steel assembly, and the T-shaped steel plates are<br>
provided on the upper and lower flanges, a guide pipe is provided in the T-shaped<br>
steel plate installed in the center of the lower flange, steel strands are further<br>
provided in the guide pipe, the guide pipe is jointed with a lower reinforcing plate<br>
installed under the T shape steel plate using nuts to integrate and fix it, and then,<br>
the concrete is placed and cured. Lastly, the steel strands are settled on both ends<br>
of the beam after a prestress force is introduced into the steel strands.<br>
Unlike the aforementioned PSC beam or the prestressed steel reinforced<br>
concrete unit beam, a structure in which die steels are inserted into a cross-section of<br>
the concrete has been proposed in a Korean unexamined patent application<br>
publication No. 10-2004-0004197, entitled "Composite Beam Stiffened with<br>
Prestressed Concrete Panel Having Embedded Lower Flange and Multi-stepped<br>
Jacking Structure", wherein this structure is generally referred to as an MSP<br>
structure in the art. In this structure, unlike the aforementioned technologies, a<br>
precasted concrete panel composite beam is made by combining a steel beam with a<br>
precasted concrete panel. Specifically, a protrusion is provided on an upper<br>
surface of the precasted concrete panel to bury the lower flange of the steel beam;<br>
first and second tendons are provided on the precasted concrete panel, wherein the<br>
first tendon is disposed on left and right sides of a position where the protrusion is<br>
provided under the center axis of the precasted concrete panel near the center axis,<br>
and the second tendon is spaced far from the center axis of the composite cross-<br>
section after integrated under the protrusion; the first tendon is firstly prestressed<br>
before the lower flange of the steel beam is positioned in the protrusion of the<br>
precasted concrete panel, and then, secondly prestressed after the steel beam is<br>
disposed on the protrusion and second concrete is placed in the protrusion, so that<br>
compressive stress is also applied to the second concrete by introducing the second<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/065085	PCT/KR2005/004320<br>
prestress; the second tendon is thirdly prestressed and settled in the state that the<br>
self-weights of the steel beam and the panel is reflected on the entire load after the<br>
steel beam is combined with the precasted concrete panel, so that third prestress can<br>
be applied on the panel and additionally applied to the second concreted.<br>
A second conventional technology is to introduce the compressive<br>
prestress into concrete only by a recovery force of the steel beam. This technology<br>
stems from a Belgian engineering method invented in 1950's, and is frequently<br>
adopted in the Northeast Asia. The resultant girder manufactured by this<br>
technology is called "a preflex beam" in the art. In this technology, while slope<br>
deflection is generated by applying a predetermined load on the steel girder,<br>
concrete is placed on the lower flange of the steel girder and cured. The<br>
compressive prestress is introduced into the lower flange concrete in the process of<br>
releasing the slope deflection by removing the load on the steel girder (i.e., a<br>
releasing process).<br>
A third conventional technology is to introduce the compressive prestress<br>
into the concrete by using both the recovery force of the steel beam and the tension<br>
of the tendon. The resultant girder manufactured by this technology is call "a re-<br>
prestressed preflex (RPF) girder" in the art as disclosed in Korean Patent Publication<br>
No. 10-024084. In this technology, the RPF steel complex girder is manufactured<br>
by placing the concrete in the lower flange and cured with the preflexion load<br>
applied to the steel girder as the aforementioned preflex girder and then<br>
introducing the second prestress into the lower flange concrete using the tension of<br>
the tendon in the state that the compressive prestress is initially introduced by the<br>
recovery force of the steel beam. Specifically, this technology relates to a method<br>
of manufacturing a re-prestressed steel composite beam, in which a load generating<br>
bending moment having a predetermined strength (i.e., a Pf load) is previously<br>
applied to an I-shaped beam; a concrete is placed in the lower flange of the beam<br>
and cured, the previously applied load (Pf) is removed to introduce first<br>
compressive prestress into the lower flange concrete; and second compressive<br>
prestress is introduced by a tendon installed in the lower flange concrete, wherein<br>
unbonded strands are used as the tendon; a plurality of strands are disposed with a<br>
constant interval in upper and/or lower portions of the lower flange and installed<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/065085	PCT/KR2005/004320<br>
in the lower flange concrete before concrete is placed in the lower flange of the beam<br>
and cured; after the lower flange concrete is cured, the strands are installed in a<br>
prestressed state using a compressive strength of 450 kgf/cm, so that the lower<br>
flange concrete is perfectly prestressed.<br>
In the aforementioned conventional methods (i.e., the aforementioned PSC<br>
beam or the prestressed steel reinforced concrete unit beam) for previously<br>
introducing compressive prestress to constitute a resistance cross-section, although<br>
they have a cross-section consisting of reinforced bars, a high rigidity of concrete,<br>
and tendons, and allow a more economical construction in comparison with other<br>
conventional methods for manufacturing a composite beam with the I-shaped beam<br>
installed in its cross-section, they may be limited by the height of the beam and<br>
particularly, by the effective span due to a structural limitation that the self-weight<br>
is dominant among external forces applied to the cross-section. Therefore, the<br>
bridges based on the aforementioned methods are applicable to constructions<br>
having an effective span more or less than 30m, and particularly, to constructions<br>
not limited by overhead clearance or discharge capacity.<br>
In order to compensate for the limitation of the height of the beam or the<br>
effective span, a steel composite beam adopting both advantages of a high rigidity<br>
of concrete as well as the I-shaped beam has been proposed. Among<br>
aforementioned engineering methods, the preflex girder and the re-prestressed<br>
preflex steel composite girder (RPF) correspond to such a thing. However, in these<br>
engineering methods, since the compressive stress for the concrete surrounding the<br>
steel beam is introduced using a recovery force of the steel beam, the upper and<br>
lower flanges of the beam must be enlarged. Also, additional processes and costs<br>
should be prepared for the preflexion and release. Further, since large bending<br>
deformation occurs in the beam during the manufacturing process, it is very<br>
difficult to manage a camber of a finally manufactured product. Particularly, in the<br>
aforementioned preflex beam, since a typical steel beam is used to introduce<br>
compressive stress, such a composite cross-section is vulnerable to creep of the<br>
concrete. In other words, the concrete experiences creep deformation as time goes<br>
by, and the compressive prestress introduced in the manufacturing process is lost<br>
due to deformation confinement of the concrete composite beam. Meanwhile, in<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/065085	PCT/KR2005/004320<br>
the preflex girder, since the prestress is applied to the concrete by dominantly using<br>
the recovery force of the steel beam, the area of the lower flange should be large.<br>
Therefore, loss of the compressive prestress resulted from dry shrinkage<br>
deformation and creep deformation in the concrete becomes big problems in the art.<br>
Also, construction may become difficult and its cost may increase because an<br>
amount of shear connections should be provided for the lower flange of the steel<br>
girder.<br>
In order to compensate for the shortcomings of the preflex girder from the<br>
view point of a long-time behavior, a re-prestressed preflex steel composite beam<br>
(RPF) has been developed. In this technology, secondary prestress is further<br>
applied to the conventional preflex girder. As a result, it is possible to compensate<br>
for an amount of creep loss generated during a suspending period until the preflex<br>
girder is installed in a bridge or a building, and to apply sufficient prestress to the<br>
lower concrete. Also, it is possible to reduce the size of the flange of the beam due<br>
to a tendon. However, similar to the conventional preflex girder, cumbersome<br>
processes such as preflexion and release should be also applied to the RPF girder.<br>
In addition, a prestress process using a tendon should be further applied. As a<br>
result, manufacturing cost is never reduced. Although a secondary prestress<br>
process using a tendon can be performed just before the girder is installed in a<br>
target structure, a primary prestress process is introduced in a release process.<br>
Therefore, similar to the conventional preflex girder, the creep loss is inevitably<br>
generated during a suspending period. In addition, problems of the conventional<br>
preflex girder, such as relating to a number of shear connections and camber<br>
management, still exist.<br>
Recently, a multi-stage prestressed (MSP) precasted concrete panel<br>
composite girder having a lower flange buried in a single connection structure has<br>
been developed in order to overcome problems caused by introducing compressive<br>
stress into the concrete using an elastic force of the steel beam. However, although<br>
this engineering method solves problems of the conventional technologies, its<br>
construction is very complicated. Therefore, construction cost increases, and<br>
particularly, quality control becomes very difficult because it has a construction<br>
joint in lower casing concrete.<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/065085	PCT/KR2005/004320<br>
In addition, all the aforementioned conventional methods of<br>
manufacturing steel composite girders have a structural problem that the stress<br>
caused by the self-weight of the steel composite girder (including a self-weight of an<br>
I-shaped beam and a self-weight of the concrete) acts as tensile stress of the lower<br>
flange concrete. This fact means that additional stress for compensating for the<br>
tensile stress caused by the self-weight of the composite girder should be previously<br>
introduced before the compressive stress caused by bending deformation in the<br>
steel beam or tension of the tendon is introduced.<br>
Furthermore, in all the aforementioned conventional steel composite<br>
girders, since the concrete experiences a predetermined strength of compressive<br>
stress during they are suspended in a bridge or a abutment before a slab is<br>
composed, compressive stress loss caused by the creep deformation is inevitable as<br>
time goes by.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made to solve the aforementioned<br>
problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide a method of<br>
manufacturing a prestressed steel composite girder allowing stress caused by the<br>
self-weight of the girder to be applied to a steel beam and not to be applied to the<br>
concrete, and a steel composite girder manufactured using the same.<br>
In other words, the present invention provides a method of manufacturing<br>
a prestressed steel composite girder, in which the stress caused by the self-weight of<br>
the concrete is not generated in a cross-section of the concrete by allowing the self-<br>
weight of the concrete positioned around the lower flange of the steel beam to be<br>
supported by only the steel beam, and loss of compressive stress caused by creep<br>
deformation of the concrete can be minimized by previously introducing<br>
compressive stress into the concrete before it is placed on a bridge or an abutment,<br>
and a steel composite girder manufactured using the same.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>

In the above aspect, the method may further comprises steps of: installing a<br>
reinforcement bar and a sheath pipe for inserting a tendon in the steel beam before<br>
placing the concrete and curing it; and introducing compressive prestress into the<br>
concrete by tensioning the tendon in the sheath pipe after composing the concrete.<br>
In addition, in the installation of the sheath pipe, the steel beam may be an<br>
I-shaped beam comprising an upper flange, a lower flange, and a web; and the<br>
sheath pipe may be arranged around the lower flange of the steel beam along a<br>
length of the steel beam.<br>
In addition, in the installation of the sheath pipe, the sheath pipe may be<br>
extended in a parabolic shape via the web adjacent to a support and a circumference<br>
of the lower flange in the center of the steel beam.<br>
In addition, in the placing the steel beam above the ground, the steel beam<br>
may be supported at both ends thereof. In addition, the steel beam may be<br>

beam. In addition, an intermediate support may be further provided between the<br>
beam-suspending end supports to avoid lateral buckling or swaying of the steel<br>
beam.<br>
In addition, the reinforcement bar and the form may surround the lower<br>
flange of the steel beam. In addition, the reinforcement bar and the form may<br>
surround the lower flange and the web of the steel beam. In addition, the<br>
reinforcement bar and the form may surround the entire steel beam.<br>
In addition, the method may further comprise: placing a weighting<br>
member on an upper surface of the steel beam to generate positive moment on the<br>
steel beam before composing the concrete and the steel beam; and removing the<br>
weight member after composing the steel beam and the concrete, thereby<br>

WO 2006/065085	PCT/KR2005/004320<br>
inserted into connection portions of the segments and cured. In addition, the steel<br>
beam may be an I-shaped beam comprising an upper flange, a lower flange, and a<br>
web connecting the upper flange and the lower flange, and an area of the upper<br>
flange may be larger than that of the lower flange.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
method of manufacturing a prestressed steel composite girder by composing steel<br>
beams and a concrete in a single body, the method comprising steps of: placing the<br>
steel beams above the ground, the steel beams are separated from each other;<br>

two or more steel beams, the form being suspended by the steel beam; inserting the<br>
concrete into an internal space of the form and curing it; and removing the form to<br>

In addition, the form may surround a portion of the steel beam in a U-<br>
shape.<br>
In addition, the form may surround a portion of all the steel beams to<br>

In addition, the method may further comprise: installing a sheath pipe for<br>
inserting a reinforcement bar and a tendon into the steel beam before inserting the<br>
concrete and curing it; and tensioning the tendon in the sheath pipe to introduce<br>
compressive prestress in the concrete after composing the concrete. In addition,<br>
the steel beam may be an I-shaped beam comprising an upper flange, a lower flange,<br>
and a web connecting the upper and lower flanges, and an area of the upper flange<br>
may be larger than that of the lower flange.<br>
According to still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided<br>
a prestressed steel composite girder, comprising: a steel beam; a concrete composed<br>
to surround a portion of the steel beam so that stress caused by its self-weight can<br>
be applied on only the steel beam; a tendon installed in the steel beam and /or the<br>
concrete to provide the concrete with compressive prestress; and a reinforcement<br>
bar installed in the steel bar and/or the concrete to reinforce strength of the concrete.<br>
According to further still an aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a prestressed steel composite girder, comprising: a plurality of steel<br>
beams separated from each other; a concrete formed to surround a portion of the<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/065085	PCT/KR2005/004320<br>
plurality of steel beams together, so that stress caused by its self-weight is applied<br>
on only the steel beams; a tendon installed in the steel beam and/or the concrete to<br>
provide the concrete with compressive stress; and a reinforcement bar installed in<br>
the steel beam and/or the concrete to reinforce strength of the concrete.<br>
In addition, the steel beam may be an I-shaped beam comprising an upper<br>
flange, a lower flange, and a web connecting the upper and lower flanges.<br>
In addition, the upper flange of the steel beam may have a large area than<br>
the lower flange of the steel beam.<br>

steel beam.<br>
In addition, the concrete may surround the entire I-shaped beam.<br>
In addition, the tendon may be extended in a parabolic shape via the web<br>
adjacent to a support and a circumference of the lower flange in the center of the<br>
steel beam.<br>
In summary, the present invention relates to a prestressed steel composite<br>
girder comprising a reinforced concrete unit formed to apply stress caused by a self-<br>
weight and an I-shaped steel beam to only the I-shaped steel beam and a tendon<br>
providing the reinforced concrete unit with compressive prestress. The advantages<br>
of the present invention can be summarized as follows:<br>
First, in the steel composite girder structure formed by composing the<br>
concrete around the I-shaped steel beam, the reinforced concrete unit is<br>
manufactured to allow stress caused by the self-weight of the girder to be applied<br>
on only the I-shaped beam. Therefore, unlike conventional engineering methods,<br>
there is no tensile stress caused by the self-weight of the concrete of the girder.<br>
Secondly, the compressive stress for the reinforced concrete unit composed<br>
with the I-shaped beam is introduced by a tendon just before the slab concrete is<br>
placed, and the concrete previously constructed in the manufacturing process has<br>
no stress. Therefore, unlike conventional engineering methods, there is no stress<br>
loss caused by creep deformation that progresses in proportion to the strength of the<br>
stress applied during the girder is placed.<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/065085	PCT/KR2005/004320<br>
Thirdly, according to the present invention, the lower flange of the I-<br>
shaped beam has a smaller area than the upper flange. Therefore, the amount of<br>
loss of the compressive stress caused by creep or dry shrinkage deformation of the<br>
reinforced concrete unit can be minimized while the compressive stress is<br>
introduced into the reinforced concrete unit. As a result, it is possible to improve<br>
structural performance and safety of the steel composite girder.<br>
Fourthly, the steel composite girder according to the present invention is<br>
not required to comprise preflexion and release processes for the I-shaped beam, in<br>
which compressive stress is introduced into the concrete by using a recovery force<br>
of the steel beam. Also, an excessive amount of shear connections are not required<br>
to use. Therefore, it is possible to significantly reduce the amount of materials and<br>
construction cost. In addition, it is possible to exclude a work classification which<br>
is dangerous in relation to the preflexion and release processes, and thus to<br>
significantly reduce possibility of a safety accident.<br>
Fifthly, in the steel composite girder according to the present invention, a<br>
tendon and an I-shaped steel beam having a significant strength of bending stiffness<br>
are installed in the concrete. Therefore, a long span can be established while the<br>
height of the beam is low. Particularly, applicability may be remarkable when<br>
there is limitation to overhead clearance or discharge capacity.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Now, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
The prestressed steel composite girder according to the present invention is<br>
structured by casting a concrete in a portion of the steel beam (e.g., a lower flange of<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/065085	PCT/KR2005/004320<br>
the I-shaped steel beam if a T-shaped steel beam is used) and introducing<br>
compressive prestress of a predetermined quantity into the concrete using tension of<br>
a tendon. Such a prestressed steel composite girder is placed on an abutment or a<br>
bridge pier to support a concrete slab while compensate for the tensile stress<br>
generated when dead and live loads are applied for the aforementioned<br>
compressive prestress.<br>
FIGS. 1 to 7 are schematic diagrams for describing a method of<br>
manufacturing a prestressed steel composite girder according to a first embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
Now, a method of manufacturing a prestressed steel composite girder 100<br>
according to the embodiment of the present invention will be described. As shown<br>
in FIG. 1, an I-shaped steel beam 10 comprising an upper flange 11, a lower flange<br>
13, and a web 15 for connecting the flanges 11 and 13 with each other is prepared.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, this I-shaped steel beam 10 is placed in a simply supported<br>
position by providing temporary supports at both ends of the beam 10 (Step S10).<br>
In this case, it is preferable that the lower flange 13 of the I-shaped steel beam 10 has<br>
a smaller area than the lower flange 11 while a plurality of shear connections are<br>
provided on an upper surface of the upper flange 11.<br>
Placing the I-shaped steel beam 10 in a simply supported position at both<br>
ends by supports 20 may be achieved by suspending the beam 10 by a beam-<br>
suspending end support 9110 at both ends as shown in FIGS. 19 and 20. In other<br>
words, the beam-suspending end support 9110 comprises two vertical members 911<br>
erected on the ground; a horizontal member 9111 placed on and supported by the<br>
vertical members 9111; a hydraulic jack 9113 installed on an upper end of the<br>
vertical member 9111 to lift up and down the horizontal member 9112; a bracing<br>
member 9114 slanted by the side of the vertical member 911; a vertical reinforcing<br>
member 9115 interposed between the upper and lower flanges 11 and 13 to<br>
reinforce elasticity of the I-shaped beam 10 when the I-shaped beam is connected to<br>
the horizontal member 912; and a turn-buckle (9116) of which both ends are hinge-<br>
connected between the vertical reinforcing member 9115 and the horizontal member<br>
9112 with bolts and the like to support the I-shaped beam 10. As a result, the I-<br>
shaped beam 10 can be suspended by the beam-suspending end support 9110 in a<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/065085	PCT/KR2005/004320<br>
both-ends-supported shape by fixing the vertical reinforcing member 9115 installed<br>
on both ends of the I-shaped beam 10 with the turn-buckle 9116.<br>
Meanwhile, an intermediate support (not shown) having a shape similar to<br>
the beam-suspending end support 9110 may be preferably provided between the<br>
beam-suspending end supports 9110 to avoid lateral buckling or swaying of the<br>
beam during a manufacturing process of the beam.<br>
Then, as shown in FIG. 3, a reinforcement bar assembly 70 is provided by<br>
cross-connecting vertical and horizontal bars on the lower flange 13 of the I-shaped<br>
beam 10. The reinforcement bar assembly 70 is integrated to the beam 10 in a<br>
single body by welding the assembly 70 with the web 15 of the I-shaped beam 10 so<br>
that it can be supported by the I-shaped beam 10 (Step S20).<br>
Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 4, a plurality of sheath pipes 60 for<br>
installing tendons 50 (see FIG. 7) are disposed in the lower flange 13 and the bar<br>
assembly 70 (Step S30). In this case, the sheath pipe 60 is preferably installed in an<br>
internal space of the reinforcement bar assembly 70 around the lower flange 13<br>
along a length of the I-shaped beam.<br>
Then, as shown in FIG. 5, a form 40 for placing the concrete is installed to<br>
be supported by only the I-shaped beam 10. For this purpose, a separate support<br>
member 80 as shown in a one-dotted chain line in FIG. 5 is used to integrate the<br>
form 40 into the I-shaped beam 10. In this case, the support member 80 may<br>
comprise: a first support 81 for transferring the load of the form 40 to the upper<br>
flange of the I-shaped beam 10; a second support 82 for substantially connecting the<br>
first support 81 and the form 40 to transfer a vertical load; and a third support 83<br>
connected to the I-shaped beam 10 to transfer the horizontal load applied on the<br>
form 40.<br>
As a result, as shown in FIGS. 19 and 20, since the I-shaped beam 10 is<br>
suspended from the ground with its both ends supported, the self-weight of the<br>
form 40 is supported by the I-shaped beam 10 and the support member 80 while the<br>
form 40 surrounds the bar assembly 70 and the sheath pipes 60.<br>
Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 6, a predetermined amount of the concrete<br>
is inserted into the internal space of the form 40, and then cured during a<br>
predetermined time period (Step S40) (see FIG. 6). In this state, it is noted that<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/065085	PCT/KR2005/004320<br>
bending moment is generated in the I-shaped beam 10 by the load of the I-shaped<br>
beam 10 and the concrete itself, and compressive stress is applied on the upper<br>
flange while the tensile stress is applied on the lower flange 13.<br>
After the concrete surrounding the lower flange of the I-shaped beam 10 is<br>
completely cured, the form 40 is removed from the I-shaped beam 10. Then, as<br>
shown in FIG. 7, tendons 50 are inserted into the inside of the sheath pipes 60. As a<br>
result, it is possible to provide a reinforced concrete unit 30 having no stress on the<br>
lower flange 13 while the lower flange 13 is sufficiently tensioned by the self-<br>
weights of the I-shaped beam 10 and the concrete.<br>
Through the aforementioned process, it is possible to manufacture a<br>
prestressed steel composite girder 100 according to a first embodiment of the<br>
present invention, in which the reinforced concrete unit 30 is built in the lower<br>
flange 13 of the I-shaped beam 10 with no stress while only the I-shaped beam 10<br>
experiences the stress caused by the self-weights of the I-shaped beam 10 and the<br>
concrete.<br>
FIG. 8 is a perspective view illustrating a prestressed steel composite girder<br>
manufactured according to a method of manufacturing a prestressed steel<br>
composite girder according to a first embodiment of the present invention, and FIG.<br>
9 is a front view schematically illustrating a simple support state of a prestressed<br>
steel composite girder according to the present embodiment.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 8 and 9, just before or after the steel composite girder<br>
100 manufactured as the described above is placed on a bridge or an abutment, the<br>
tendons 50 are tensioned by using a tension device such as a hydraulic jack as<br>
shown in FIG. 7, and both ends of the tendon 50 are anchored on both ends of the<br>
reinforced concrete unit 30 using an anchorage 90. As a result, a predetermined<br>
strength of compressive stress is introduced into the reinforced concrete unit 30.<br>
Now, the prestressed steel composite girder 100 configured as described<br>
above will be described in more detail. The prestressed steel composite girder 100<br>
comprises: an I-shaped steel beam 10; a reinforced concrete unit 30 mixed with the I-<br>
shaped beam 10 to be supported by the I-shaped beam 10 with no stress; and a<br>
tendon 50 installed in the reinforced concrete unit 30 to provide prestress with the<br>
reinforced concrete unit 30.<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/065085	PCT/KR2005/004320<br>
The I-shaped beam 10, as described above, comprises: an upper flange 11; a<br>
lower flange 13; and a web 15 for connecting the flanges 11 and 13 with each other.<br>
The upper and lower flanges 11 and 13 are connected to upper and lower sides of<br>
the web 15 which horizontally elongated and thus also horizontally elongated.<br>
Preferably, the lower flange 13 of the I-shaped beam 10 has a smaller area<br>
than the upper flange 11. In the I-shaped beam 10 having such a shape, since a<br>
neutral axis is substantially high for the upper and lower flanges 11 and 13, the<br>
lower flange 13 can be subjected to sufficient tensile stress by the self-weights of the<br>
I-shaped beam 10 and the reinforced concrete unit 30. In other words, in the I-<br>
shaped beam 10, the upper flange experiences compressive stress and the lower<br>
flange experiences tensile stress by the self-weights of the I-shaped beam 10 and the<br>
reinforced concrete unit 30.<br>
As shown in FIG. 9, the reinforced concrete unit 30 (referred to as a lower<br>
flange concrete in the art) is combined with the lower flange 13 of the I-shaped beam<br>
10 by using the reinforcement bar assembly 70 and the form 40 (see FIG. 5)<br>
supported by only the I-shaped beam 10 while both ends of the I-shaped beam 10<br>
are simply supported by the support 20.<br>
More specifically, in the process of manufacturing the steel composite<br>
girder according to the present,<br>
Since the reinforced concrete unit 30 is manufactured in such a way that<br>
both ends of the I-shaped beam 10 are simply supported by supports 20, and the<br>
form 40 is supported by only the I-shaped beam 10, the entire self-weight of the<br>
concrete placed in the form 40 is transferred to the I-shaped beam 10. In other<br>
words, the reinforced concrete unit 30 is combined with the lower flange 13 while<br>
the lower flange 13 experiences sufficient tensile stress by the self-weights of the I-<br>
shaped beam 10 and the concrete itself.<br>
Therefore, since the I-shaped beam 10 is substantially responsible for the<br>
self-weights of the I-shaped beam 10 and the reinforced concrete unit 30, if the<br>
concrete is cured and the form 40 is removed, the reinforced concrete unit 30 is<br>
supported by the lower flange 13 of the I-shaped beam 10 with no stress.<br>
As a result, in the steel composite girder 100 according to a first<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the stress caused by the self-weights of the I-<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/065085	PCT/KR2005/004320<br>
shaped beam 10 and the reinforced concrete unit 30 is applied on only the I-shaped<br>
beam 10 while its both ends are simply supported by the supports 20, but the stress<br>
caused by the self-weights is not applied on the reinforced concrete unit 30. In this<br>
case, the stress applied on the I-shaped beam 10 is generated by the weights of the I-<br>
shaped beam 10 and the reinforced concrete unit 30, and includes compressive<br>
stress applied on the upper flange and tensile stress applied on the lower flange.<br>
The tendon 50 which provides prestress on the reinforced concrete unit 30<br>
is inserted into the sheath pipe 60 distributed around the reinforced bar assembly 70<br>
and the lower flange 13 along the length of the I-shaped beam 10.<br>
Both ends of the tendon 50 may be installed on both ends of the reinforced<br>
concrete unit 30 by twisting strands in a single one and tensioning it with a<br>
tensioning device such as a hydraulic jack.<br>
For this purpose, as shown in FIG. 8, an anchorage 90 is provided on both<br>
ends of the reinforced concrete unit 30 for anchoring both ends of the tendon 50 in<br>
both ends of the reinforced concrete unit 30. In this case, the anchorage 90 has a<br>
typical jointing structure that can joint the tendon 50 at both ends of the reinforced<br>
concrete unit 30 by installing a wedge with an anchor cone (not shown).<br>
Now, advantages of the prestressed steel composite girder 100 according to<br>
the embodiment of the present invention will be described below. Since the<br>
prestressed steel composite girder 100 is manufactured by sufficiently tensioning<br>
the I-shaped beam 10 and combining the reinforced concrete unit 20 with the lower<br>
flange 13 of the I-shaped beam 10 without stress, no stress is generated by the self-<br>
weight of the steel composite girder 100. Also, since the stress generated by the<br>
self-weight of the steel composite girder 100 is not applied on the reinforced<br>
concrete unit 30 while both ends of the girder 100 is simply supported by the<br>
supports 20, the loss of compressive stress caused by the self-weight is not<br>
generated, and particularly, since the concrete experiences no stress, there is no<br>
stress loss caused by creep deformation that progresses in proportion to the strength<br>
of the applied stress. In addition, it is possible to consider additional loads that<br>
will be applied on the girder 100 after completing construction of a bridge by<br>
combining slab concrete. Also, since tension is introduced by the tendon just<br>
before the slab concrete is placed, and the applied stress is not large in a common<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/065085	PCT/KR2005/004320<br>
use, the loss of compressive stress caused by creep of the concrete with the slab<br>
mixed is negligible. Furthermore, if the steel composite girder is collapsed, and the<br>
reinforced concrete unit 30 is completely broken down so that the girder loses its<br>
function, the lower flange 13 of the I-shaped beam 10 does not experience much<br>
marginal stress. As a result, its cross-section can be efficiently used.<br>
Further, in the prestressed steel composite girder 100 according to the<br>
present embodiment, the lower flange of the I-shaped beam 10 has a smaller area<br>
than the upper flange 11. Therefore, it is possible to reduce loss of the compressive<br>
prestress caused by dry shrinkage deformation of the reinforced concrete unit 30<br>
after the compressive prestress is introduced into the reinforced concrete unit 30.<br>
Furthermore, in the prestressed steel composite girder 100 according to the<br>
present embodiment, the upper flange 11 of the I-shaped beam 10 experiences<br>
relatively less compressive stress in comparison with the tensile stress applied on<br>
the lower flange 13. Therefore, it is possible to have a large margin for additional<br>
loads.<br>
FIG. 10 is a horizontal cross-sectional view schematically illustrating a<br>
prestressed steel composite girder manufactured by a method of manufacturing a<br>
prestressed steel composite girder according to a second embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Now, a method of manufacturing a prestressed steel composite girder<br>
according to a second embodiment of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings. Similar to the steps S20 and S30<br>
described above, the reinforcement bar assembly 170 and the form 140 are installed<br>
in the I-shaped beam 110. However, according to the second embodiment, the<br>
reinforcement bar assembly 170 and the form 140 surrounds the lower flange 113<br>
and the web 115 of the I-shaped beam 110 as shown in FIG. 10, and they are<br>
supported by only the I-shaped beam 110.<br>
In this state, concrete is placed in an internal space of the form 140 and<br>
cured, and the form 140 is removed.<br>
Through this manufacturing method, a prestressed steel composite girder<br>
200 according to a second embodiment of the present invention can be<br>
manufactured by combining the reinforced concrete unit 130 with the lower flange<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/065085	PCT/KR2005/004320<br>
113 and the web 115 of the I-shaped beam 110. It should be noted that the tendon<br>
150 is also installed between the opposite sheath pipes 160 of the reinforced concrete<br>
unit 130.<br>
In the second embodiment, since other manufacturing procedures,<br>
structures, and effectiveness are similar to those of the aforementioned first<br>
embodiment, their descriptions will be omitted.<br>
FIG. 11 is a horizontal cross-sectional view schematically illustrating a<br>
prestressed steel composite girder manufactured by a method of manufacturing a<br>
prestressed steel composite girder according to a third embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Now, a method of manufacturing the prestressed steel composite girder<br>
according to a third embodiment of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 11. Similar to the steps S20 and S30 of the aforementioned first<br>
embodiment, the reinforcement bar assembly 270 and the form 240 are installed in<br>
the I-shaped beam 210. However, according to the third embodiment, the<br>
reinforcement bar assembly 270 and the form 240 surrounds the entire I-shaped<br>
beam 110 as shown in FIG. 11, and they are supported by only the I-shaped beam<br>
110.<br>
In this state, concrete is placed in an internal space of the form 240 and<br>
cured, and the form 240 is removed.<br>
According to the method of manufacturing the prestressed steel composite<br>
girder according to the third embodiment, the reinforced concrete unit 230<br>
surrounds the entire I-shaped beam 210, or preferably, the entire surfaces excluding<br>
an upper surface of the upper flange 211 of the I-shaped beam. It should be noted<br>
that the tendon 250 is also installed between the opposite sheath pipes 260 of the<br>
reinforced concrete unit 230.<br>
In the third embodiment, since other manufacturing procedures, structures,<br>
and effectiveness are similar to those of the aforementioned first embodiment, their<br>
descriptions will be omitted.<br>
FIG. 12 is a horizontal cross-sectional view schematically illustrating a<br>
prestressed steel composite girder manufactured by a method of manufacturing a<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/065085	PCT/KR2005/004320<br>
prestressed steel composite girder according to a fourth embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Now, a method of manufacturing the prestressed steel composite girder<br>
according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 12. Similar to the steps S20 of the aforementioned first<br>
embodiment, the sheath pipe 360 is installed. However, according to the fourth<br>
embodiment, the sheath pipe 360 is installed in a parabolic shape as shown in the<br>
one-dotted chain line of FIG. 12, so that the sheath pipe 360 can be extended via the<br>
web 315 of the I-shaped beam 310 corresponding to the support 320 and a<br>
circumference of the I-shaped beam 310 in the center of the lower flange 313.<br>
In this state, concrete is placed in the lower flange 313 of the I-shaped beam<br>
310 and portions of the web 315 corresponding to the supports 320, and cured.<br>
Then, a tensioning device such as a hydraulic jack is used to tension the tendon 350<br>
while the tendon 350 (shown as a one-dotted chain line in FIG. 12) is installed in the<br>
internal space of the sheath pipe 360. Subsequently, both ends of the tendon 350<br>
are fixed at both ends of the concrete unit 330 through the anchorage 390. The fourth<br>
embodiment of the present invention is not limited to the configuration of installing<br>
the anchorage 390 in both ends of the concrete unit. Alternatively, the anchorage<br>
390 may be installed in an inner side separated from the concrete unit 390 with a<br>
predetermined distance.<br>
According to the fourth embodiment of the present invention, it is possible<br>
to manufacture a prestressed steel composite girder 400 having a sheath pipe 360<br>
extending in a parabolic shape via the web 315 adjacent to the supports 320 and the<br>
lower flange 313 in the center of the I-shaped beam 310.<br>
In the fourth embodiment, since other manufacturing procedures,<br>
structures, and effectiveness are similar to those of the aforementioned first<br>
embodiment, their descriptions will be omitted.<br>
FIG. 13 is a horizontal cross-sectional view schematically illustrating a<br>
prestressed steel composite girder manufactured by a method of manufacturing a<br>
prestressed steel composite girder according to a fifth embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/065085	PCT/KR2005/004320<br>
Now, a method of manufacturing the prestressed steel composite girder<br>
according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 13. Similar to the steps S10 of the aforementioned first<br>
embodiment, the I-shaped beam 410 is provided. However, according to the fifth<br>
embodiment of the present invention, at least two I-shaped beams 410, or preferably,<br>
a pair of I-shaped beams 410 are provided in such a way that they can be lined up<br>
with a predetermined interval.<br>
In this state, the reinforcement bar assembly 470 and the form 440 are<br>
installed in the I-shaped beam 410 as shown in FIG. 13. Specifically, the<br>
reinforcement bar assembly 470 and the form 440 surrounds the lower flanges 113<br>
and the webs 115 of two I-shaped beams 410 together, so that they can be supported<br>
by only the I-shaped beams 410.<br>
Then, concrete is placed in an internal space of the form 440 and cured, and<br>
the form 440 is removed.<br>
In the fifth embodiment of the present invention, since the reinforced<br>
concrete unit 430 is manufactured to surround a pair of I-shaped beams 410 together,<br>
a cross-sectional shape of the girder 500 can have a U-shape. In this case, it should<br>
be noted that the sheath pipe 460 is also provided in the reinforced concrete unit 430,<br>
and the tendon 450 is also inserted into the sheath pipe 460.<br>
If the prestressed steel composite girder 500 according to the fifth<br>
embodiment of the present invention is employed in a deck bridge, the cross-<br>
sectional shape of the bridge after applying concrete slabs may be a closed shape.<br>
As a result, it is possible to increase torsional stiffness allowing for a long span of a<br>
bridge. In addition, the prestressed steel composite girder according to the fifth<br>
embodiment of the present invention can be used as a deck bridge.<br>
In the fifth embodiment, since other manufacturing procedures, structures,<br>
and effectiveness are similar to those of the aforementioned first embodiment, their<br>
descriptions will be omitted.<br>
FIGS. 14 and 15 are front views schematically illustrating a prestressed<br>
steel composite girder manufactured by a method of manufacturing a prestressed<br>
steel composite girder according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2006/065085	PCT/KR2005/004320<br>
Now, a method of manufacturing the prestressed steel composite girder<br>
according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to FIGS. 14 and 15. As shown in FIG. 14, after the Step S30 in the<br>
aforementioned first embodiment, a weighting member W having a predetermine<br>
weight is disposed on the I-shaped beam 510 to generate positive moment on the I-<br>
shaped beam 510.<br>
In this state, concrete is placed in an internal space of the former 540 shown<br>
as a dashed line in FIG. 14 and cured, and the weight member W and the former 540<br>
are removed. As a result, as shown in FIG. 15, it is possible to introduce additional<br>
compressive stress into the reinforced concrete unit 530 by the weighting member W.<br>
The prestressed steel composite girder 600 according to the sixth<br>
embodiment of the present invention is manufactured by a manufacturing process<br>
similar to that of the first embodiment. However, since the self-weight of the<br>
weighting member W is applied on the I-shaped beam 510, it is possible to more<br>
easily compensate for the tensile stress generated in a negative moment cross-<br>
section when a design load is applied.<br>
FIGS. 16 to 18 are front views schematically illustrating a prestressed steel<br>
composite girder for describing a method of manufacturing a prestressed steel<br>
composite girder according to a seventh embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Now, a method of manufacturing the prestressed steel composite girder<br>
according to a seventh embodiment of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to FIGS. 16 through 18. As shown in FIG. 16, taking the structure of the I-<br>
shaped beam and a delivery condition into account, three girder members 610a,<br>
610b, and 610c that have been previously manufactured in a factory are prepared.<br>
The three girder members 610a, 610b, and 610c are combined with one another in a<br>
single body to provide an I-shaped beam 610 according to the seventh embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
In this process, connecting plates 617 are provided at the connecting areas<br>
a and b (i.e., adjoining portions of the girder members 610a, 610b, and 610c in an<br>
upper flange 611a, a lower flange 613a, and a web 615a), and then, fixing members<br>
such as bolts are engaged in the connecting plate 617, so that each of the girder<br>
members 610a, 610b, and 610c are connected with one another in a single body.<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2006/065085	PCT/KR2005/004320<br>
In this state, as shown in FIG. 17, the reinforced concrete unit 630 is formed<br>
in the lower flange 613a except for the connection areas a and b of the girder<br>
members 610a, 610b, and 610c through a process similar to that of the first<br>
embodiment.<br>
Then, the connecting plates 617 provided in the connecting areas a and b<br>
are removed from the girder members 610a, 610b, and 610c, so that three pieces of<br>
segmented girders 600a, 600b, and 600c are manufactured.<br>
Then, the segmented girders 600a, 600b, and 600c are delivered to a<br>
construction site, the connecting plates 617 are installed in each of the connecting<br>
areas a and b of the segmented girders 600a, 600b, and 600c, so that the each of the<br>
segmented girders 600a, 600b, and 600c are connected in a single body.<br>
Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 18, the reinforcement bar assemblies 670a<br>
and the sheath pipes 650a shown as a dashed line are also installed in the<br>
connecting areas a and b between the segmented girders 600a, 600b, and 600c (i.e.,<br>
between the reinforced concrete units 630 of each segmented girder 600a, 600b, and<br>
600c). The reinforcement bar assembly 670a may be connected to the opposite<br>
reinforcement bar assembly 670 installed in the reinforced concrete unit 630 of each<br>
segmented girder 600a, 600b, and 600c by using a typical connection method such as<br>
a welding. Similarly, the sheath pipe 650a may be connected to the opposite sheath<br>
pipe 650 installed in the reinforced concrete unit 630 of each segmented girder 600a,<br>
600b, and 600c by using a jointing member (not shown).<br>
Subsequently, the forms (not shown) are installed in each connection area a<br>
and b between the segmented girders 600a, 600b, and 600c. Then, concrete is<br>
placed in the forms and cured for a predetermined time period, and the forms are<br>
removed. As a result, it is possible to manufacture a prestressed steel composite<br>
girder 700 having a segmented structure according to the seventh embodiment of<br>
the present invention, in which the reinforced concrete unit 630 is connected along a<br>
plurality of lower flanges (not shown) of all the I-shaped beams 610.<br>
While the present invention has been particularly shown and described<br>
with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those<br>
skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein<br>
