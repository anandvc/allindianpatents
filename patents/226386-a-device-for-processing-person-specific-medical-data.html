				<td>System For Detecting And Storing Individual-Specific Data, A Corresponding Storage<br>
Element And A Method For Rescuing And/Or Medically Caring For Living Beings In An<br>
Emergency<br>
Specification<br>
The invention relates to a storage element with at least two storage areas for<br>
storing individual-specific data, as well as a system for recording and storing individual-<br>
specific data, comprising a computer, a corresponding storage element and a connection<br>
device. The invention also relates to a system for recording and storing individual-<br>
specific data, comprising a first computer which contains different storage areas on a<br>
computer storage element. The invention furthermore relates to a method for rescuing<br>
and/or medically caring for living beings in emergency situations, in particular<br>
individuals involved in accidents, as well as to a computer program product for realizing<br>
this method.<br>
Individual-specific data in particular refers to data relating to humans, but also to<br>
data relating to animals.<br>
Storage elements and systems for storing individual-specific data are known, for<br>
example, from the health services. It is standard procedure nowadays to store a patient's<br>
master data on an insurance card. The patient carries along this insurance card and hands<br>
it over, for example during a visit to the physician, so that the data stored on the storage<br>
element can be input into a computer system at the physician's office. The master data in<br>
this case comprise in particular the name, the health insurance information and the age of<br>
the patient.<br>
Systems already exist at the physician's office, which store additional patient data<br>
on a computer, for example previous diagnoses, laboratory tests and previously issued<br>
prescriptions. In particular the anamnesis or case history of a patient is extremely<br>
important to the treating physician. The physician normally issues a prescription based<br>
on the latest diagnosis, which the patient then takes to the pharmacy to be filled.<br>
This method and/or this system is relatively involved. The pharmacist must input<br>
the prescription data into his/her computer system for the corresponding accounting.<br>
Thus, the traditional action of filling out paper prescriptions is time consuming.<br>
In an emergency situation, for example involving an accident, it is very difficult<br>
for the treating physician to obtain a case history of the emergency patient. Only a few<br>
emergency patients carry along an emergency information card. In most cases, the<br>
information stored on this card is furthermore very incomplete.<br>
Problems additionally come up during the rescue of accident victims or persons<br>
who have fainted because much time passes during the rescue of these individuals before<br>
they are provided with the proper initial medial care. As a rule, the individuals involved<br>
in the emergency situation are not admitted to an appropriate special clinic, but instead<br>
are given initial medical care at a general clinic. A decision concerning a specialized<br>
treatment is made only afterwards. In emergency situations of this type, much time<br>
furthermore passes until data relating to patient is available. This is particularly true if<br>
the accident victim has fainted and/or does not respond.<br>
Accordingly, it is the object of the present invention to improve the medical care<br>
in general and in particular to improve the rescue of individuals involved in accidents or<br>
emergency situations, wherein data protection rights of individuals must be taken into<br>
consideration.<br>
This object is solved with a storage element having at least two storage areas for<br>
storing individual-specific data, wherein different logon authorizations are assigned to the<br>
different storage areas.<br>
With the storage element according to the invention, for example, auxiliary<br>
personnel at the physician's office can read the data in only one storage area while the<br>
physician provided with a special logon authorization can read and write data on<br>
additional storage areas. With a storage element of this type, access to important<br>
diagnostic data such as blood type and allergies can be protected, so that it can be<br>
accessed only by the physician with logon authorization. If the storage element also<br>
comprises a storage area for prescriptions, the prescription data can be read easily and<br>
without problems by a pharmacist, which saves time and cost.<br>
It is furthermore possible to store additional data in the memory, which can be<br>
authorized by the patient himself and can be read, for example, together with the<br>
physician.<br>
The storage element preferably comprises at least one storage area configured as<br>
ROM, meaning an area that can be read only, as well as at least one additional storage<br>
area configured as RAM, meaning an area for reading and writing. The ROM, for<br>
example, is used to store master data such as the name and address, health insurance<br>
information, information relating to the nearest relatives or a personal physician and, if<br>
possible, a passport photo. Other individual-specific data can also be stored, in particular<br>
biometric data such as an image of the iris or a finger print. The addresses and/or<br>
telephone numbers of individuals who should be notified in case of an emergency can<br>
also be stored. The RAM, which can be divided into several regions or fields, can be<br>
used to store diagnostic data such as heart diseases, metabolic diseases, circulatory<br>
diseases, lung diseases, infectious diseases such as hepatitis or HIV, allergies,<br>
neurological problems such as epilepsy and the blood type. Variables can be stored in<br>
another field, i.e. the results of laboratory tests, data from the most recent checkups,<br>
neoplasias, the results of X-rays of, for example, the thorax, medications and the most<br>
recent prescription, operations, pregnancies, implants such as silicon and, for example,<br>
also the status of teeth, meaning whether the patient wears a prosthesis. A prescription<br>
written by a physician could be entered into a different RAM field. The patient can then<br>
take the storage element to a pharmacy where the pharmacist can view the master data of<br>
the patient and the prescription field.<br>
It is preferable if the second storage area that is assigned to a second logon<br>
authorization can be written on with a first logon authorization for the associated first<br>
storage area and can be read and deleted with the second logon authorization. An<br>
additional storage area, i.e. the prescription field, is furthermore provided and can be read<br>
without logon authorization. Without logon authorization in this case is understood to<br>
mean in particular the normal and standard use of a card reader by the auxiliary personnel<br>
in a physician's office, wherein access is obtained, for example, to a ROM in which the<br>
patient's master data are stored.<br>
The two storage areas that require logon authorization are preferably located in at<br>
least one RAM and/or the storage area that can be read without logon authorization is<br>
located in a ROM.<br>
The storage element preferably is a one-piece element. If this storage element is<br>
advantageously located on a flat configuration, in particular is disposed on a card, then a<br>
standard health insurance card can be used. In that case, the card is preferably a so-called<br>
chip card in the form of a credit card or a "smart card."<br>
Different individuals can be provided with different codes if the storage content of<br>
the at least two storage areas is advantageously provided with a different coding, so that<br>
the respective individuals have access only to very specific areas on the storage element.<br>
The object is furthermore solved with a system for recording and storing<br>
individual-specific data, comprising a computer, a storage element as described in the<br>
above, and a connection device. The storage element can engage in the connection<br>
device in such a way that data can be read from the storage element into the computer<br>
and/or can be written from the computer to the storage element.<br>
A system of this type is advantageous for emergency events, for example if a<br>
person has become an accident victim. Once the physician arrives at the accident scene,<br>
he/she must only retrieve the health insurance card of the accident victim and engage this<br>
card in the connection device to obtain access to the corresponding relevant data.<br>
It is preferable if a logon element is provided for transmitting data to the computer<br>
and/or via the computer to the connection device, wherein the data contain at least a<br>
portion of the logon authorization. As a result, not every individual can read all the data<br>
on the storage element, but only those individuals having the respective logon<br>
authorization and/or the corresponding logon element. The logon element in this case<br>
can be a storage element on a card, for example, which the physician always carries. A<br>
portion of the logon authorization can be stored on mis card. The card is preferably also<br>
secured with a PIN code, so that it cannot be used by other unauthorized individuals if the<br>
respective access card of a physician is lost. The PIN code is an example of a preferably<br>
additional section of the logon authorization that can be transmitted via a communication<br>
means in the form of data to a computer and/or via the computer to the connection<br>
device.<br>
The office help at the physician's office, for example, can read only the ROM area<br>
of the storage element. In that case, the logon element can be a code that is stored on a<br>
computer and is supplied to the card during the reading in order to open up an area that is<br>
assigned to the logon code of the logon element. Within the framework of this invention,<br>
a computer of this type can also be a card reader. Another area, for example a RAM area,<br>
is intended for viewing by the physician only. The physician can read and/or write in this<br>
area with the aid of a corresponding logon element, for example a code stored in the<br>
computer and a personal code which must be input by the physician into his/her<br>
computer, in particular a barcode or a biometric code. However, a logon element can<br>
also be a storage element installed on a portable card. Of course, the physician preferably<br>
should also be able to read the ROM area. A pharmacist can read and correspondingly<br>
delete only a portion of the RAM, namely the portion set aside for the prescription. The<br>
logon element provided for this can be a code, for example, that exists in the card reader<br>
or computer at the pharmacy and can be transmitted via an interface to the storage<br>
element on the insurance card to provide the pharmacist with access to this area.<br>
Remote data transmission means are preferably provided, in particular comprising<br>
a mobile telephone. These remote data transmission means makes it possible, for<br>
example, to transmit individual-relevant data to a hospital, so that the hospital staff can<br>
take all necessary steps to prepare for the arrival of an accident victim.<br>
The object of the invention is furthermore solved with a system for recording and<br>
storing individual-specific data, comprising a first computer that contains different<br>
storage areas on a computer storage element, wherein at least in part different storage<br>
areas are assigned to different logon authorizations, further comprising a portable storage<br>
element on which data can be stored and a connection device. The portable storage<br>
element can be made to engage in the connection device in such a way that data from the<br>
portable storage element can be transferred to the first computer, wherein the individual-<br>
specific data from one of the areas with logon authorization on the computer storage<br>
element can be read and/or changed through entering a corresponding logon authorization<br>
or using an existing logon authorization.<br>
The solution according to the invention, for which the first computer is provided<br>
with different storage areas on a computer storage element and the storage areas at least<br>
in part comprise different logon authorizations, permits the intermediate storage of<br>
individual-specific data on a fast computer system and, with the aid of this computer<br>
system, allows different individuals with different logon authorizations access only to the<br>
respective areas of the data.<br>
It is preferable if remote data transfer means are provided, wherein the data can be<br>
transmitted from a first computer to a second computer that is assigned to the connection<br>
device. In that case, it is not necessary to store all data on the portable storage element.<br>
Additional data can be stored on a central computer, in particular the first computer as a<br>
server, which is particularly advantageous with high amounts of data. In that case, access<br>
can be obtained to corresponding storage areas of the computer storage element on the<br>
first computer with the aid of the portable storage element and the logon authorizations<br>
and/or the logon authorization elements or the codes. For example, if the data on the<br>
patient's insurance card is input following an accident, the data are transmitted together<br>
with a physician code to the first computer at the hospital, so that the data accessible with<br>
this logon authorization can be transmitted back to the physician at the scene of the<br>
accident and can be read and, if necessary, can be changed by the physician on his/her<br>
portable, second computer and/or a mobile telephone, which in particular also comprises<br>
the functions of a computer.<br>
If an electromagnetic signal can be transmitted and received, preferably with the<br>
connection device for detecting the data on the portable storage element, wherein the<br>
portable storage element comprises a transponder, it is not even necessary to find the<br>
insurance cards, for example at the scene of an accident. It is sufficient to come close to<br>
the respective insurance card to transmit the respective data, for example from the<br>
insurance card to a computer of the treating physician. A scanner using electromagnetic<br>
rays is used, for example, for reading the data on the chip, which saves a great deal of<br>
time during an accident. A card of this type, carried along by the patient, preferably<br>
comprises a so-called active and/or passive controller. This technique permits a non-<br>
problematic determination of whether or not a patient carries precisely this patient card.<br>
In particular, the controller consists of a small program that is initialized with the aid of a<br>
coil, with electromagnetic energy provided by a carrier. The initializing carrier can either<br>
be a hand-held computer or a notebook computer with small accessory device. The<br>
carrier initializes the coil whereupon the chip set anchored on the card is supplied with<br>
energy. Controlled by its program, this chip set in turn reads specific data on the memory<br>
and makes these data available to the network for transmittal. Slow networks such as the<br>
Ethernet can be used, corresponding to the IEE802.X Standard. The hand-held computer<br>
can be linked via a standard serial interface to the computer processing the data for the<br>
purpose of further transmitting the data or, in the case of emergency measures at the<br>
accident location, to the notebook with remote data transmission (DFU) link and<br>
corresponding protocols. This technique can also be used in the field of veterinary<br>
medicine.<br>
The advantage of this technique is that especially in cases involving a higher<br>
number of accident victims, ranging from interstate accidents to fires in a tunnel, the time<br>
for questioning and maybe searching for data to help with the rescue and save lives is<br>
extremely reduced and the rescue personnel can operate with a much higher<br>
effectiveness, which leads to considerable cost savings. Not to be neglected in this case<br>
is the considerable reduction in secondary health problems that may result from unknown<br>
and undetected injuries, which is not possible without the transfer of data from the<br>
storage element with the aid of a passive and/or active controller.<br>
The object is furthermore solved according to the invention with a computer<br>
program product and/or a technique for writing and/or reading data on a first storage<br>
element, as described in the above. In order to input and/or write data into at least one<br>
storage area of the first storage element, which is at least partially secured by at least one<br>
logon authorization, a logon authorization is transmitted to a storage area on a second<br>
storage element and is compared to at least one logon authorization that can be specified<br>
on the first storage element. If the logon authorization matches at least one of the<br>
specified logon authorizations, then the storage areas of the first storage element that are<br>
assigned to this logon authorization are released or unblocked.<br>
As a result of the inventive computer program product and the inventive method,<br>
it is possible to release corresponding storage areas on the first storage element,<br>
depending on the logon authorization. Different logon authorizations can be considered,<br>
for example, for a physician, for a physician's aide and for the pharmacy. For example,<br>
the physician is provided with an additional card containing at least a portion of the logon<br>
authorization. This additional card must be inserted, for example, into a card reader or a<br>
computer to input the logon authorization and/or the corresponding code thereon. The<br>
physician then enters another code, i.e. a PIN code, to obtain logon authorization to<br>
respective areas of the first storage element. Alternatively, the physician can also record<br>
and input biometric data to obtain a logon authorization.<br>
To display the released data, the data from the first storage element are preferably<br>
input into an additional storage area on the second storage element and are then sent to a<br>
display unit. In order to write in the unblocked storage areas of the first storage element,<br>
data are advantageously input into the second storage element and are then transmitted<br>
from there to the unblocked storage area on the first storage element where they are<br>
stored. If the remote transmission of data is planned, as is advantageous, the location of<br>
the first storage element can differ from that of the second storage element.<br>
According to the invention, a storage element arranged on a card is used for<br>
storing and/or changing individual-specific data relating to the area of health services, in<br>
particular the area of emergency medicine, so as to quickly detect the case histories of<br>
accident patients.<br>
This object is furthermore solved with a method for rescuing and/or medically<br>
caring for living beings in emergency situations, in particular people involved in<br>
accidents. With this method, a central unit contains in particular current data relating to<br>
available mobile rescue objects, in particular emergency physicians, emergency medical<br>
technicians, emergency-room physicians, ambulances and/or emergency vehicles.<br>
Following a report of an emergency situation involving living beings to the central unit, a<br>
suitable mobile rescue object is assigned by the central unit to the emergency situation<br>
based on the available emergency situation information and/or the available data on<br>
mobile rescue objects. The central unit then transmits a message relating the emergency<br>
situation to the at least one assigned mobile rescue object. Corresponding to the accident<br>
location and/or the type of accident that occurred, the most suitable rescue vehicle<br>
available at the moment and/or the most qualified rescue personnel are automatically<br>
determined.<br>
To ensure optimum care for accident victims or people in emergency situations,<br>
the central unit must have the requisite data on the rescue vehicles and/or the rescue<br>
personnel. Already existing data relating to the accident or emergency situations can<br>
additionally be considered when determining the rescue objects. A report of the event<br>
can be sent, for example via telephone, to a main command post for rescue operations,<br>
which can be reached via the known emergency telephone numbers, wherein the main<br>
command post for rescue operations is either connected permanently to the central unit or<br>
is connected once the accident report is received. Data on accidents and emergency<br>
situations can be collected and administered or monitored and controlled in the central<br>
unit, either for the region and/or beyond the region as well as nationally and globally. A<br>
central computer and/or a network of computers are primarily used for this, which can<br>
optimally assign rescue objects to the respective event either locally and/or regionally as<br>
well as (internationally following a report of an accident.<br>
Within the framework of this invention, reporting an emergency event in<br>
particular refers to the transfer of data that is specific to this emergency event. These<br>
data can be input in schematic form into a computer system by a person taking the<br>
telephone call and can then be transmitted to the central unit. The data can also be<br>
transmitted automatically, for example with the aid of a voice-controlled prompt from the<br>
caller. The accident and/or emergency event alternatively can also be reported<br>
automatically. For example, a vehicle carrying endangered cargo can be equipped with<br><br>
an accident-signaling device which, in the event that the vehicle should be involved in an<br>
accident, automatically reports this accident to a central unit via remote data<br>
transmission, i.e. mobile radio transmission. The accident location can be detected, for<br>
example, with mobile radio technology. Data relating to the endangered cargo can also<br>
be transmitted along with the accident report. For yet another modification of the<br>
invention, vehicles, airplanes, ships and trains can be provided with a (semi-) automatic<br>
reporting system and/or a device of this type. When transporting people, the number of<br>
transported individuals can also be reported.<br>
To ensure optimum care for individuals involved in an accident, for example, it is<br>
advantageous if the data on the mobile rescue objects also contain data relating to the<br>
availability and/or the location and/or the qualification and are transmitted to the central<br>
unit.<br>
It is preferable if any change in the data relating to mobile rescue objects is<br>
transmitted. As a safety measure, the data on the mobile rescue objects should be<br>
updated at regular intervals, at least in part, and sent to the central unit.<br>
According to a further modification of the method, the data and/or the location of<br>
a mobile rescue object are transmitted with the aid of a GPS device to the central unit.<br>
By making use of the global positioning system (GPS), the central unit consequently has<br>
information on where the available rescue object is located at the moment. Thus, it is<br>
always possible to find out which rescue object, i.e. an emergency physician, is located<br>
near the emergency event. The term "qualification of a rescue object," for example, is<br>
understood to mean the training and professional qualifications of the available rescue<br>
personnel. In the case of vehicles, for example, the qualification refers to the capacity<br>
and the equipment available in the vehicle. Alternatively, the locations of vehicles can<br>
also be determined via mobile radio technology.<br>
The rescue of accident victims can be improved further if the data on mobile<br>
rescue objects are updated, preferably at predetermined time intervals.<br>
If a respective mobile rescue object, for example a physician who is less qualified<br>
than an emergency physician, is already present at the location for the emergency or<br>
accident event, a request for an additional mobile rescue object can preferably be<br>
transmitted to the central unit to reinforce and aid the rescue personnel on location.<br>
Based on the request and/or the data relating to available mobile rescue objects, the<br>
central unit can assign at least one additional mobile rescue object to the event and can<br>
transmit a message to the additional mobile rescue object.<br>
It is furthermore advantageous if, following the report of the emergency event to<br>
the mobile rescue object, the mobile rescue object sends a cancellation message to the<br>
central unit. The central unit thus has knowledge of available and not available rescue<br>
objects, meaning objects that are either deployed or which are available for deployment.<br>
One advantageous modification of the solution according to the invention<br>
provides that the central unit is connected to stationary rescue installations and contains<br>
data, in particular updated information, on the stationary rescue installations. As a result,<br>
the central unit stores information on available resources, for example hospitals and<br>
specialized clinics, so that the central unit generally is always informed of which medical<br>
measures and installations (i.e. in a special clinic for an acute emergency) are available<br>
and whether a bed, for example, is empty. Within the framework of this invention, a<br>
connection to stationary rescue installations in particular means a connection to<br>
respectively one data processing system, i.e. a computer in the rescue installations, on<br>
which relevant data relating to the rescue installations are stored and updated.<br>
The quality of care during a rescue operation can be improved further if,<br>
following a message indicating the need for further treatment of the living being, in an<br>
emergency from the mobile rescue object to the central unit, a suitable rescue installation<br>
is determined based on the need for further treatment and/or based on the data relating to<br>
stationary rescue installations and if the information relating to the detected rescue<br>
installation is transmitted to the mobile rescue object. The need for further treatment is<br>
determined, for example, if an emergency physician transmits data relating to the<br>
accident victims to the central unit via a data line, i.e. via mobile radio transmission. A<br>
standardized protocol can be used by the emergency physician to report the diagnosis.<br>
The data relating to the detected rescue installation can include the location of the<br>
rescue installation, for example, wherein the coordinates and the address can be<br>
transmitted. The coordinates can then be entered into the navigational system of a mobile<br>
rescue object, such as an ambulance, so that the navigation can start immediately and<br>
automatically.<br>
It is furthermore advantageous while the living being involved in an accident is<br>
cared for and/or after the care is administered, if data are exchanged between the mobile<br>
rescue object and/or the central unit, in particular patient data and/or data relating to<br>
further treatment. As a result of this data transfer, information relating to an accident<br>
victim can be obtained quickly and immediately from other medical computer networks<br>
and can be made available to a specialist in a selected emergency clinic while the patient<br>
is still en route to the emergency clinic. Valuable time can thus be saved when rescuing<br>
people since the specialist can make preparations and gather information while the<br>
individual to be rescued is transported to the location.<br>
Within the framework of this invention, a mobile rescue object comprises a<br>
computer, on which the actual data for the emergency event can be stored and which can<br>
be used to supply the data to a remote data transfer device in order to communicate with<br>
the central unit.<br>
To select a suitable stationary rescue installation that meets the further treatment<br>
requirements of the person to be rescued, it is advantageous if the data on the stationary<br>
rescue installations contain data on whether the installation is available and/or meets the<br>
qualifications and/or is within reaching distance and if the information is then transmitted<br>
to the central unit.<br>
The medical care is further improved if the data on stationary rescue installations<br>
is updated, preferably at predetermined time intervals and/or following a change in the<br>
data and/or the status. Thus, it is possible to react quickly and spontaneously to the<br>
momentary requirements of an accident event, shortly after the accident occurs. For<br>
example, if a bed becomes available in a hospital, this information is immediately<br>
transmitted to the central computer and/or the central unit, so that the empty bed is<br>
available.<br>
A physician thus can also obtain information on the patient to be treated before<br>
the patient is admitted if data relating to the accident event and/or the living being that is<br>
hurt in an accident (human or animal) are transmitted to the stationary rescue installation.<br>
According to one modification of the invention, it is advantageous if the data<br>
collected while caring for the living being and/or during the transport are transmitted to<br>
the associated stationary rescue installation, so that clinics and emergency clinics can<br>
react within a short time to the accident event and can take appropriate measures.<br>
The object is further solved with a computer program with program code for<br>
realizing the above-described method for rescuing and/or medically caring for living<br>
beings involved in an accident, in particular people or animals, so that the above-<br>
described method steps can be carried out if the program runs on at least one computer.<br>
The computer program can be realized with a system for rescuing living beings,<br>
wherein the system comprises at least one central unit, a mobile rescue object and a<br>
stationary rescue installation. The central unit and the rescue objects are preferably<br>
linked via a radio data transmission line. The link between central unit and rescue<br>
installation can be realized via a remote data transmission line.<br>
A computer program is furthermore provided with a program code that is stored<br>
on a machine-readable carrier for realizing the above-described method for rescuing<br>
and/or medically caring for living beings, so that the above-described method steps can<br>
be realized if the program is running on a computer.<br>
Within the framework of this invention, practicing physicians can also use the<br>
method according to the invention to provide suitable medical care to a patient in a<br>
correspondingly suitable hospital. The physician is provided with timely information on<br>
the occupancy of beds and operating rooms and thus can admit his/her patient to a<br>
hospital.<br>
The invention is described in the following without limiting the general inventive<br>
idea, with the aid of exemplary embodiments and reference to the drawings, to which we<br>
expressly refer with respect to all details of the invention not explained further in the text.<br>

people or animals involved in an accident.<br>
The same elements are provided with the same reference numbers in the<br>
following Figures. The respective elements will not be introduced again.<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of an exemplary embodiment of a<br>
system for detecting and storing individual-specific data. An insurance card 10 is divided<br>
into 4 fields, namely the field 1 for storing the master data and the fields II, HI and IV<br>
where additional data can be stored. In field I, data can be input without further logon<br>
authorization and it contains master data as described in the above. The fields II and III<br>
can be accessed only with a logon authorization card 11 and a physician PIN code,<br>
wherein the stored contents can be read and data can be written in. Field II, for example,<br>
contains data relating to diagnoses while field III contains additional data, as previously<br>
described in the above. Field IV may contain the contents of a prescription, wherein the<br>
physician can write and delete data in this field, while the pharmacist can only read and<br>
delete data.<br>
A patient arrives at the physician's office and hands his insurance card to the<br>
office personnel for insertion into a computer 12. The personnel at the physician's office<br>
can then load in the master data and can view it on the monitor. The physician, who also<br>
has a computer 12 in his/her office, inserts the respective logon authorization card into a<br>
corresponding interface and also enters a PIN code. Together with the PIN code, the<br>
logon authorization card enables the physician to read and write on the insurance card in<br>
fields II, III and IV. The code is input via the keyboard 13. The data can then be viewed<br>
on the monitor 30.<br>
Of course, it is possible to transfer the data on the insurance card via a data line<br>
from the computer in the reception area to the computer in the physician's office. It is<br>
therefore not necessary to insert the insurance card into another card reader and/or<br>
storage device in the physician's computer. However, the variant shown in Figure 1<br>
where the insurance card as well as the logon authorization card of the physician are<br>
inserted into respectively different interfaces is preferred.<br>
The flow chart in Figure 2 shows a preferred sequence of steps in a physician's<br>
office. The sequence starts with step 100. Initially, the insurance card is inserted into a<br>
computer 12 (step 101) and the master data are loaded (step 102). Next, the master data<br>
are displayed on the monitor (step 103), wherein standard computer programs are used to<br>
realize these steps. For this, data are loaded in the standard way onto a processor and are<br>
stored on corresponding storage areas of the computer and processed for display on the<br>
monitor.<br>
An inquiry is made (step 104) to determine whether the insurance card was<br>
removed. If that is the case, the process sequence ends according to Figure 2. If that is<br>
not the case, another inquiry is made at step 104 [sic]. In field 106 it is possible to<br>
introduce an insertion. This insertion is described in further detail in a simplified<br>
sequence shown in Figure 3.<br>
Step 107 represents the start of the insertion at the physician's office. At step 108,<br>
the logon authorization card is inserted into the physician's computer and at step 109 the<br>
logon authorization is checked. If the logon authorization card does not contain a logon<br>
authorization that matches a corresponding logon authorization stored on the insurance<br>
card 10 or the computers, the end of the insertion by the "physician" occurs at step 110 in<br>
case of a "no." If the logon authorization matches one of the stored logon authorizations<br>
("yes"), then the field 111 awaits the input of a PIN code via a keyboard and the entered<br>
PIN code is checked. If the entered PIN code is incorrect (f), a counter previously set to<br><br>
zero is incremented upward by one (step 112). An inquiry is made at step 113 to see if<br>
the counter is higher than 3. If this inquiry is answered positively, the insertion by the<br>
physician ends with 110. If this inquiry is answered negatively (n), a warning appears at<br>
114 on the monitor, and the system returns back to field 111. If the entered PIN code (w)<br>
is correct, the process continues on to field 115 where the additional fields of the<br>
insurance card are shown according to the input logon authorization. In field 116, an<br>
inquiry is made whether the access card has been removed. If that is the case (yes) the<br>
insertion ends at 110. If that is not the case (n), the system waits to see whether data are<br>
input (field 117). If no data is input, the process sequence reverts back to field 115. If<br>
data are input, then the data on the insurance card are altered in field 118 and the system<br>
returns once more to field 115.<br>
Figure 4 shows a simplified process sequence, i.e. at a pharmacy, where the<br>
process sequence starts at 200. The insurance card is initially inserted into a card reader<br>
(field 201). In field 202, the logon authorization for the prescription area on the<br>
insurance card is transferred to the insurance card (field 202). In field 203, an inquiry is<br>
made as to whether the logon authorization is correct. If this is not correct (n), the<br>
process is stopped at the pharmacy. If the logon authorization is correct (y), the<br>
prescription data is indicated in field 204, if necessary the data from the computer system<br>
for billing the insurances is supplied to the pharmacist and is subsequently deleted in the<br>
prescription area and/or the field IV of the insurance card. Following this, the process<br>
ends at the pharmacy.<br><br>
The above-described process sequences according to the preferred exemplary<br>
embodiments and also the additional embodiments are for the most part realized with<br>
computer program steps, known per se to the person skilled in the art, which can be<br>
realized without problems and do not require further explanations herein.<br>
Figure 5 shows another schematic representation of an exemplary embodiment,<br>
for which an external computer (14) that may be located at a clinic contains storage areas<br>
16,17,18 and 19 for patient-relevant data. The storage area 27, shown only<br>
schematically herein, is designed to represent a storage area that may be located on the<br>
processor or hard drive. The different storage areas 16 to 19 are provided for the<br>
different fields containing patient data.<br>
For example, an emergency physician at the accident location has a laptop or<br>
palm-size computer, meaning a computer (12). An insurance card 10, for example, is<br>
inserted into a connection device 20 that may be integrated into this computer (12). The<br>
data stored in the memory 25 of the insurance card 10 thus can be transferred to the<br>
physician if necessary, wherein the memory 25 in this case contains only master data. A<br>
schematically shown memory 26, installed on the computer 12, in particular comprises a<br>
storage area 28. The master data are subsequently displayed, for example on the monitor<br>
30. Corresponding data are then transmitted, for example via a radio data transfer 29, to<br>
the computer 14. In addition, a logon authorization for the physician is stored in the<br>
storage area 28 of the memory 26. The logon authorization data and/or the logon<br>
authorization code are supplied via the data transfer 29 to the computer 14. The<br>
emergency physician furthermore enters a PIN code via the keyboard 13 into the<br>
computer 12. This PIN code is also transmitted to the computer 14. If the complete<br>
logon authorization, consisting of the logon authorization stored on the storage area 28<br>
and the PIN code, is correct, then the physician can read the areas 16 to 19 of the memory<br>
IS and, if necessary, can also change these areas.<br>
With this embodiment, the essential and individual-relevant data are thus stored in<br>
a computer, i.e. a computer at a clinic. However, the data can also be stored in a central<br>
computer that may store data for the whole country.<br>
According to another exemplary embodiment, also described with the aid of<br>
Figure 5, all data on the insurance card 10 can alternatively be stored in the memory 25.<br>
That is to say, the data can be stored in the above-described, different areas that can be<br>
accessed with different logon authorizations. These data can be read with the aid of the<br>
logon authorization data in the storage area 28 of memory 26 and the PIN code, which is<br>
input by the physician.<br>
It is advantageous if the insurance card is provided with a transponder 21 that is<br>
linked via a connecting line 22 to the memory 25 in case the insurance card is not found<br>
at the scene of the accident. In that case, the physician's laptop computer may comprises<br>
a type of radio transmitter that emits electromagnetic rays, which make it possible to read<br>
the data stored in the memory 25. The range for this can be correspondingly limited, so<br>
that data from different insurance cards disposed at distances of only a few meters from<br>
each other are not scrambled. The radio transmitter and/or the transmitter/receiver can<br>
also be provided in an accessory device for the computer 12 and can be linked to the<br>
computer with a data link. In that case, the insurance card functions as a type of ID<br><br>
(identification) tracker. In that case, gigahertz waves are preferably coupled via a small<br>
antenna into a surface wave component, wherein the surface waves are provided with a<br>
respective coding by the waveguide. The reflected wave is then once more limited and/or<br>
uncoupled and is received by a receiving device and is further processed.<br>
In particular, provisions must be made for a physician to access the data without<br>
the input of a special PIN code stored on the insurance card, which is valid only for the<br>
insurance card, because the insurance card and/or the patient may not respond at specific<br>
moments. The PIN code and the additional logon authorization data should therefore<br>
function independent of the respective individual insurance card. It also makes sense to<br>
provide the insurance card with a photograph of the patient to permit a quick<br>
identification.<br>
The access card and/or the logon authorization that is stored in a computer<br>
memory should be protected with a PIN code for the person with read/write authorization<br>
to avoid any misuse.<br>
To embed a passport photo in the form of data and/or optically on the insurance<br>
card prevents the misuse of the card in case it is lost or stolen. The writing ability offers<br>
the advantage that a double diagnosis can be avoided, thus avoiding the costs tied thereto<br>
and the corresponding medical risks. In addition, the last-prescribed medication is<br>
preferably documented on the card, thus limiting the "hopping" between physicians as<br>
well as any double treatment due to a lack of knowledge of the previous treatment.<br>
One preferred embodiment of the invention is the data transfer via the Intranet or<br>
the Internet or via radio or telephone<br>
For the German territory, an interface protocol such as a Capi-link, for example, is<br>
preferably used for utilizing a pear-to-pear protocol via ISDN1 by making use of the<br>
batch transfer protocol TCP/IP batch for rapid data transport. A corresponding ISDN<br>
controller should support B-channel protocols in ISDN with the respective controller<br>
software. These are, for example, X.75, HDLC transparent2, transparent, X.25, ISO 8208<br>
(X.25 DTE-DTE), X.31 case a/b, T.90, Fax G3, V.110 and V.120, which results in<br>
compatibility with generally used standards and equipment and thus a corresponding cost<br>
reduction. By including a Capi port, which makes available virtual modems for data<br>
links with X.32-X.7S data compression during the transfer, as well as with a compression<br>
method that conforms to Capi 2.0 specifications and/or V.42bis (Capi soft compression<br>
X.75/V.42bis), an uncomplicated connection can be established, even to analog networks.<br>
It appears useful to provide direct access to medically relevant data between<br>
different clinics, from the ambulance to the clinic, from the physician to the clinic, from<br>
the clinic to the physician etc. This is useful particularly for acute deployments, e.g.<br>
mass accidents and for the disaster protection, where the implementation of a NDIS-<br>
WAN3 port can be advantageous. Accordingly, it is also possible to create UMTS and/or<br>
GSM4 connections. The remote data transfer between the physician's computers and/or<br>
the card reader for the physician and an emergency clinic and/or a hospital can be via a<br>
mobile radiotelephone service.<br>
1 ISDN = telephone link that functions like modem but is 5 times faster<br>
2 HDLC/transparent - refers to data transfer rate<br>
3 NDIS-WAN port = for connection to the Internet<br>
4 UMTS -universal mobile telecommunication system;<br>
GSM - relates to digital mobile telephone service<br>
It is furthermore possible to fill out a medical protocol automatically, which can<br>
then be transmitted to the health insurances and/or the hospitals, preferably via remote<br>
data transmission. For the transfer, the data in particular can be encoded to safeguard the<br>
data.<br>
It is furthermore conceivable that other groups or individuals can gain access to<br>
specific data. The police, for example, should be able to access data of individuals in<br>
order to be able to identify them. In addition, persons to be contacted immediately in<br>
case of an accident can be noted on the chip card.<br>
Figure 6 shows a simplified, schematic embodiment of a method for rescuing<br>
and/or medically caring for living beings (involved in an accident). The method can be<br>
used not only for rescuing people in an emergency, but also for rescuing animals,<br>
particularly dogs and horses.<br>
Following an accident or emergency event 51 that results in injuries or causes<br>
other problems for people and/or an animals, a report 52 of the accident event 51 is<br>
transmitted to a central computer 53. The accident event 51 can be reported, for example,<br>
via telephone to the main office for rescue services and can include information on the<br>
location of the accident and/or the type of accident, so that a respective report 52 is then<br>
transmitted from the rescue services main office to the central computer 53. The main<br>
office can be connected permanently to the central computer 53 via a corresponding<br>
remote data link or can be connected only if an accident 51 occurs.<br>
The central computer 53 is additionally linked to mobile rescue objects 54.1, 54.2,<br>
54.3 via a radio link or via mobile data lines. The mobile rescue objects 54.1, 54.2, 54.3<br>
can be located with the so-called global positioning system (GPS), so that the current<br>
location of the mobile rescue objects 54.1,54.2, 54.3 is always stored in the central<br>
computer 53. In addition, other mobile rescue object data relating to equipment and/or<br>
qualification and/or type of the mobile rescue objects 54.1,54.2,54.3 can be transmitted<br>
to the central computer 53. Mobile rescue objects 54.1 to 54.3, for example, can include<br>
emergency physicians, ambulances and rescue vehicles.<br>
Corresponding to the information provided on the accident event 51 and based on<br>
the data relating to available mobile rescue objects 54.1, 54.2, 54.3, the central computer<br>
53 determines in a step 55 a momentarily available rescue object. The rescue object,<br>
which is assigned based on the requirements of the accident event 51, receives a message<br>
on the accident 51 and is directed to the deployment location and/or the accident event.<br>
Since the rescue object assigned to the accident event is deployed, a cancellation 56 of<br>
the rescue object availability is sent to the central unit 53. The central computer 53 thus<br>
stores the information that the rescue object directed to the location of deployment is not<br>
(no longer) available for deployment at another accident location.<br>
Once it arrives at the accident 51 location, the insurance card of the accident<br>
victim can be scanned in a first step to provide initial medical care to the accident victim.<br>
For this, the insurance chip card is provided with features as described in the above for an<br>
insurance card and/or a storage element according to the invention. In addition, the<br>
insurance chip card can be provided with a coil, so that on the whole a passive<br>
transponder is created.<br><br>
After recording the patient data, the patient data can be input into a computer, e.g.<br>
a laptop, which can establish a network connection to the central computer 53, in<br>
particular via a radio link. As an alternative, the patient data are recorded with a mobile<br>
computer, i.e. a handheld computer, which is in contact with a mobile base station in the<br>
rescue vehicle. The mobile base station in turn has a wireless connection to the central<br>
computer 53, wherein the data is preferably encoded for the transfer.<br>
In addition, the accident victims are initially cared for in a step 58, wherein the<br>
emergency physician inputs the further treatment requirements into his/her computer.<br>
The further treatment requirements are then transmitted to the central computer 53 via the<br>
previously mentioned mobile remote data transmission link.<br>
The central computer 53 is furthermore linked with emergency clinics and other<br>
hospitals 60.1 to 60.4 via the corresponding connections 61. These stationary rescue<br>
installations 60.1 to 60.4 also provide data to the computer 53 on the momentary<br>
availability of beds and/or treatment resources. In addition, a stationary rescue unit 60.1<br>
to 60.4 can provide additional data to the central computer 53 relating to personnel<br>
qualifications and/or specialized treatment options and specialized equipment, such as<br>
diagnostic and treatment devices at the clinic. These data are continuously updated. In<br>
particular, it means that if a bed becomes available in a hospital, the central computer is<br>
informed of the availability of the bed.<br>
According to yet another modification, the central computer 53 and/or the rescue<br>
system can support the diagnosis made by the emergency physician at the scene of the<br>
accident in that the system instructs or urges the emergency physician to perform a<br>
specific and more comprehensive examinations and to input the examination results.<br>
Inadequate preliminary examinations can thus be reduced or avoided.<br>
Based on the data relating to the available stationary rescue installations 60.1 to<br>
60.4 and with the aid of the transmitted protocol for further treatment, sent by the<br>
emergency physician at the scene of the accident 51, the central computer 53 then<br>
determines in a further step 59 a respective emergency clinic, which ensures optimum<br>
medical care for the accident victim. When selecting the respective emergency clinic<br>
with the central computer 53, other factors such as location and qualification of medical<br>
personnel can also have an influence.<br>
The central computer 53 then notifies the mobile rescue object (emergency<br>
physician) at the location of deployment of the detected emergency clinic and/or assigns<br>
it (process step 63). At the same time, the emergency clinic is informed of the accident<br>
event 51 and the further treatment requirements and the patient data of the accident<br>
victim are transferred to the emergency clinic. The data for the patient to be cared for as<br>
well as the patient history and the injuries to the accident victim are thus available to the<br>
team of physicians at the emergency clinic while the patient is still being treated at the<br>
accident location 51 by the emergency physician.<br>
According to one alternative embodiment, the emergency physician at the<br>
accident event 51, for example, can request via the mobile data line an additional rescue<br>
vehicle, i.e. containing additional equipment, which is then determined by the central<br>
computer 53 in accordance with the requirement profile and the availability of rescue<br>
objects.<br>
The above-described rescue system with a central computer and/or central unit,<br>
mobile rescue objects and stationary rescue installations can be organized on a global as<br>
well as a local level, wherein several central computers on the local level can be<br>
distributed over different regions and cities and all these computers jointly form the main<br>
central unit. As a result, a region can be monitored effectively with respect to the<br>
medical care, so that the waiting times and delivery times for the accident victims can be<br>
reduced with the method shown herein. More people can thus receive better medical care<br>
faster, so that the rescue of individuals can be improved. Based on the regional<br>
monitoring, the rescue services can be optimized on the local level as well as the regional<br>
level and beyond. In particular, statistics can be gathered through monitoring and/or<br>
evaluating data, which can be used to determine the need for mobile rescue objects and<br>
stationary rescue installations. Thus, the quality (in particular qualification of physicians<br>
and quality of beds and equipment, i.e. in particular optimized beds and related<br>
equipment and hospital personnel for people suffering from heart-circulatory illnesses),<br>
as well as the quantity (i.e. the number of required rescue vehicles and/or ambulances in<br>
the city of Kiel, the number of required emergency medical technicians and/or emergency<br>
physicians, the number of required beds, etc) can be determined, in particular for<br>
predetermined time periods. The rescue objects and rescue installations can then be<br>
optimized accordingly, which also leads to cost savings. The statistical evaluation can be<br>
utilized for an improved positioning of the ambulances.<br>
Within the framework of this invention, the term individual-specific data in<br>
particular aiso includes animal-specific data.<br>
