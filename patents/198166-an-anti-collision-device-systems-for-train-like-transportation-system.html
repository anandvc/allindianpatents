COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
Anti-collision device (ACP) system for trains and the like transportation systems.<br>
M/s. KONKAN RAILWAY CORPORATION LIMITED, Belapur Bhavan, Sector 11, CBD Belapur, Navi Mumbai - 400 614.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention, and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
-1-<br><br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to art Anti-collision device (ACD) for trains and the like transportation system. More particularly this invention relates to an ACD, mainly working on microprocessor based system with radio-trans receiver, working in a pre¬determined range of say 3 Km and having own power supply system, which when mounted on locomotive, brake van, level crossing gates, railway station or any other station automatically generates signals for converting and adopting into various safety measures such as activating, biaking system of a running train to retard its speed to a safe limit or completely halting the train within a safe distance, all sorts of train collisions are prevented by activating nooteis at tevei CTossmg gates road users me ^warned and safe guarded, by activating audio / visual signals, crew member or gate man at level crossing gates are alerted to take preventive measures even to stop a moving train remotely, if danger is perceived..<br>
Trains are widely used for transportation. Accidents involving trains and at level crossing gates are more frequent involving loss of property and the life. The trauma a train accident leaves on the minds of people left behind by the dead is most significant. The various train accidents are trains colliding with each other, like head on collision, side collision, rear end collision, collision between trains and road vehicles carts, animal or persons at manned (interlocked or non-inter locked) as well as unmanned level crossing (LC) gates, may be due to the mistake of road users or railway staff Mishaps occur due to train crew becoming inactive for sometime, due to any reason. These accidents may be due to system failure or due to human error. Such incidents caused by human errors are not generally preventable with the currently available and used technology, unless very expensive imported technologies are used, which is not practical.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART<br>
There have been efforts to provide methods and apparatus that will detect and automatically avoid train collisions. The following patents represent proposed solutions to the long standing problem of vehicular collisions, some of them catastrophic, including collisions between locomotives<br>
US PATENT NO 5,574,469 explains a method for improved collision avoidance of two locomotives by periodically receiving on each locomotive digitally encoded data to determine its geographical location, speed and direction of travel by means of an onboard global positioning system receiver. However, this method only tells the Engineer/Driver that another train is within 7-mile range. Human intervention is required to negate the penalty brake if the other train is on different track. Also this is not suitable for yard/terminal yards where it has to be switched off manually.<br>
-2-<br><br>
European Patent No EP0952062 explains about mechanical device mounted on each vehicle of the train to reduce the impact of collision.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Primary Objective<br>
The Anti-Collision Device when mounted on a locomotive and guard van of a train, prevents collision at speed higher than 15kmph with another running train fitted with similar ACD's, in block sections and running lines at stations, totally independent of signalling and interlocking systems currently prevailing, as well as collisions with road vehicles at level crossing gates, thus providing a silent safety shield by networking with other ACD's fitted at stations and level crossing gates.<br>
Other objectives:<br>
i.	The loco ACD acts as alertness check device for the running staff.<br>
ii.        Serves as warning device for the driver to look for aspect of first stop signal as<br>
train approaches station, iii.       Empowers guard, station master, gate keeper and driver to remotely control and<br>
Stop an approaching train, without involvement of the train crew, when dangerous<br>
Situation is perceived, iv.       As a warning device for the road users of an approaching train at level crossing<br>
Gate.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide an anti collision device for trains which works automatically, having its own power source and actively operates within a desired predetermined range of distance, so that trains move at such a safe speed that without colliding they move together at such a speed that in case, the inter-se distance tends to reduce speed is automatically controlled.<br>
A new concept deviation count is presented and used for first time in world.<br>
Concept of Angular Deviation<br><br>
□      GPS receiver gives output in 'Angular' terms as the loco/guard van is turning away from the main line while negotiating a turn-out in a station yard<br>
D      A 'deviation' is counted when such Angular change either towards LEFT or RIGHT is detected quickly followed by another angular change of the same order which is more than THREE degrees.<br>
-3-<br><br>
While exiting station area where the train had arrived earlier, the deviation count at the time of exit is used to determine whether the train is dispatched on expected correct or not.<br>
The number of deviation count from the line the train entered the station, indicates the number of line from the entry line, on to which the train has entered.<br>
In any given yard it is possible to uniquely work out the deviation count required from a given starting line to reach a specified line, and the station ACD carries this knowledge, which it shares with the loco ACD as explained in fig. 5.<br>
Example 1 - (with reference to fig. 5)<br>
Where DC means Deviation Count as defined, LDC means Left Deviation Count, (Left or Right is with reference to direction of movement as one enters station area), RDC is Right Deviation Count.<br>
If the block section is of same type on either side of the station, i.e., either single or double line, then the number of LDC detected by the train after entering into the station area must be same as the number of RDC detected while exiting, for it to go on right track. If a train enters the station on up right entry line and passes through second loop line (11), it will observe two LDCs. When it comes out on the other side, to exit on right exit line it has to take two RDCs. Therefore if the LDC is equal to RDC the train exits the station on Right line otherwise not. Similarly, if a train enters the station from down right entry line and passes through the loop line (14), it has to take one RDC. When it comes out on other side, to exit on down right exit line it has to take one LDC. Again, RDC is equal to LDC. In case a train passes run through (without deviating) it will not observe any deviation i.e., DC=0 (15) and (13).<br>
Example 2 - (with Ref Figure 6)<br>
Where DC means Deviation Count as defined, LDC means Left Deviation Count, (Left or Right is with reference to direction of movement as one enters station area), RDC is Right Deviation Count.<br>
If the block sections are of different types on either side of Station area i.e., on one side single line (21) and other side double line (20), then the number of LDC detected by the train after entering into the station area and the number of RDC detected while exiting, for it to go on right track will have a predefined residual count (either LDC or RDC), which will vary from station to station based on the point layouts.<br>
If a train enters the station from single line section (21) and passes through Down line (24) then it detects only one LDC and NO RDC. So in this case the residual count is LDC=1 for it to exit on right down line.<br>
-4-<br><br>
This can be seen when the train passes through the extreme left line (25) The train will observe two LDC and one RDC therefore the residual count is same i.e., LDC=1.<br>
Accordingly this invention provides an anti collision device for trains and the like transportation system comprising of a microprocessor based command and control unit, a global positioning system with satellite signal receiver antenna, a crew interface of desired capacity / range with directional antenna an I/O. sub system, a breaking signal unit linked with breaking mechanism for locomotive speed control, a message display unit having audio and / or visual display means and a power supply system, preferably consisting of a battery and power converter, all units and system functionally interconnected.<br>

The ACD is capable of functioning with or without inputs from GPS when inputs are<br>
provided from standard digital tacho-meter normally available in locomotives coupled<br>
with angular measurements of the bogie relative to the longitudinal axis of the loco body.<br>
The above inputs make it possible for the ACDs to replace the inputs that it is getting from the GPS and act in the same manner as described above.<br>
The working of the ACD according to this invention with its Various Scenarios in Action is as under;<br>
How ACD is activate: Loco ACDs:<br>
If two ACDS within 3 km range find themselves approaching each other, they check if they are on same line, and if so, initiate action to apply brakes on both the locomotives. If two ACDs within 3 km range or as prescribed range depending upon the braking distances, find themselves approaching each other, but on different lines and at normal speed, then they just pass each other safely. But if one of them had slowed down and driver fails to press the normalcy button, to indicate he has stopped but nothing serious for the adjacent line, then the ACD moving at normal speed will continue on it's course.<br>
Else, that is driver has a problem or he is not yet sure, so he does not press the normalcy button, speed of approaching train is brought down to 25 or 15 kmph as prescribed, to enable driver to quickly stop if he detects any obstruction to him.<br>
If any of these two ACDs initiated an SOS signal, because derailment has detected and adjacent track needs protection, bake application starts automatically and train is brought to halt-avoiding collision.<br>
Types of collisions and description as how ACDs act to prevent the same occurring at<br>
dangerous speeds:<br>
1. Head-on collisions: Head on collisions should not normally occur if all present systems of signalling and other prescribed rules are observed by staff rigorously. But when rules are not observed or flouted like drivers passing signals at danger or station masters carelessly giving memos comprising facts-thus involving occurrence of more than two or three persons failing-collisions do take place. ACD can take care at this stage independent of staff actions. Each type of head on collision is described and how the ACD protects the same:<br>
1.2 In single line block section: In present system:<br>
The block section in advance is already occupied by a running train, but paper line clear, by-passing the block instruments provided is issued by station master allowing another train to enter the same block section, or a driver mistakes some signals and passes signal at danger and enters the block section-or the station is non-interlocked and station-master commits a mistake, which means more than two or three errors<br>
-10-<br><br>
would have taken place, in such cases-the trains may have head on collision, if the trains are approaching each other.<br>
When ACDs are fitted:<br>
Since ACDs are working independent of actions of station master as well as<br>
interlocking or signals at stations, they are not influenced by these mistakes or<br>
failures.<br>
When two Loco ACDs detect each other within 3 km range, since it is a case of<br>
reducing the relative distance between them, and both are on same line, braking will<br>
start and trains brought to stop short of each other.<br>
1.3	Double-line sections.<br>
Present system:<br>
Generally when for some operational reasons, if a train is diverted from its normal correct track, it has to negotiate a cross-over to change the line. In such cases paper line authorities are served on the driver-to proceed on to the "wrong" line. In case station master commits a mistake, which may happen if the station also is working on temporary non-interlocked basis, and declares to driver that he is going on the correct and "right" line only without being diverted, perhaps even believes so, forgetting to set the cross over correctly, then the train can proceed on the "wrong" line and may collide with another train coming in the opposite direction following correct procedures.<br>
When ACDs are provided:<br>
Since Loco ACD is constructed in such a way that, it can detect the deviation count,<br>
based on information from the station ACD, automatically finds out that the train has<br>
been diverted on to a wrong line, and will not allow another Loco ACD on the same<br>
line to collide with, by braking both the trains once they detect each other within 3<br>
km.<br>
1.4	Station area-single line sections on either side:<br>
Present system:<br>
A train received on the main line is stopping for signals to proceed further, say. As per rules another train is permitted to approach the station from opposite side. Signals not given pending setting of route, say. The approaching train must stop at signal as per rules. But driver commits a mistake and passes the signal at danger and head on collision takes place. When ACDs are fitted:<br>
The Loco ACD of train received in the station and standing on the main line, by virtue of its construction identifies that deviation count is zero and hence, the line identification is transmitted to other loco ACD.<br>
The train approaching the station area from block section knows from the station ACD that facing points are not set or not set to loop. If not set to loop, the Loco ACD of approaching train will apply brakes to stop the train detecting another Loco ACD on the same line. If station ACD conveys that facing point is set to loop, then, even though the approaching train detects a Loco ACD standing on the main line, will only<br>
-11-<br><br>
reduce speed to 15 kmph to enter loop. At this stage, driver will have enough time to stop. If he further discovers that the loop also is occupied by another train.<br>
Since Loco ACD is so constructed to know that within 3 km range if two of them are approaching each other on the same line, brakes automatically apply, and hence no collision takes place<br>
2.0 Rear-end collisions; Presently: A train is received and is waiting for further line clear, say on main line.<br>
Meantime Another train approaches that station from the block section in rear. Station master is correct in not taking off signal for the approaching station as he may need time to set route etc. and expects rightly the train to stop at signal. Driver commits a mistake and passes the signal at danger and rams into the standing train.<br>
When fitted with ACDs:<br>
Loco ACD of approaching train while demanding for alertness of driver as the train approaches the station area to observe the first stop signal, takes action to slow down train to 15 kmph if driver is not vigilant. In case driver also declares that he is vigilant and still tends to commit a mistake of not observing signal, the ACDs will further act; because the station ACD advises the approaching Loco that, say, facing points are not set to loop, then brakes apply automatically once the other Loco ACD in station area is detected on the same line as the approaching train. In addition the Guard ACD also will act to stop the approaching tTain. Hence collision will be prevented.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
9. Demarcation of Station Section from Adjacent Block Section-Station ACD will demarcate the station section between two consecutive block sections. Station ACD will continuously communicate the location details (latitude and longitude) of its first stop signal (home or outer, as the case may be, provided at either ends), to loco ACDs of all the approaching trains. Based on the information received, the "loco ACD" will then light up "Station Approaching" lamp indication and give audio indication also to alert the driver. If the driver fails to acknowledge the same within 30 seconds, the normal application of brakes will be initiated by the "Loco ACD" to bring to A STOP, irrespective of the fact that the aspect of the FIRST stop signal is in 'ON' or 'OFF' or ' BLANK' position.<br>
-14-<br><br>
10.	Locos Within Station Section-Once the loco ACDs find themselves within the station section (based on the information received from the station ACD), and their speeds are also 15 Kmph or less, they will switch over to "Receive only" mode, automatically. However, in case of emergencies, such ACDs will still be in a position to send "SOS" signals to other ACDs who are within their radio range.<br>
11.	Locos (including Shunting Locos) Moving At Speeds More Than 15 Kmph In Station Section Or Moving Out Of The Station Section-<br>
The loco ACD of the train will permit resumption of transmission of its own information for the benefit of other ACDs in the vicinity when its speed in the station yard goes above 15 Kmph or the loco comes out of the station section (as demarcated by station ACD).<br>
12.	Dispatching Trains on "Wrong" Line From The Station Section-<br>
After ensuring that the FIRST train on the WRONG line has already been sent with speed<br>
restriction of 25 Kmph, the station ACD will permit loco ACDs of subsequent trains on<br>
WRONG lines at normal speeds,  by conveying such information to loco ACD,<br>
automatically, through radio communication.<br>
In such cases, driver will also have a facility to view such updated information on screen of loco ACD, before initiating appropriate necessary action. But the loco ACD knows independently because of its unique construction, whether it is proceeding on wrong or right line, irrespective of declarations by the station staff.<br>
13.	Additional Safety Features For Non Inter-Locked Working At Stations-<br>
Station ACD will take following extra precautions, in case Non Interlocked working has<br>
been introduced at such stations and the Station ACD has been advised of the same by<br>
Station master on duty.<br>
Station ACD will restrict the speed of ALL the approaching trains to 15 Kmph by communicating the Non Interlocked working to their respective loco ACDs, in advance.<br>
Since Loco ACD does not depend on track circuits or inputs from station staff to determine its line occupation, does not therefore depend on the status of the station being interlocked or non-interlocked.<br>
The ACD is capable of functioning with or without inputs from GPS when inputs are provided from standard digital tacho-meter normally available in locomotives coupled with angular measurements of the bogie relative to the longitudinal axis of the loco body.<br>
-15-<br><br>
The above inputs make it possible for the ACDs to replace the inputs that it is getting from the GPS and act in the saine manner as described above<br>
When coupled with inputs of (JPS as well as inputs coming from the tacho-meter and the angular measurement of the bgies, the availability and reliability of the device increases many-fold, with the result one can introduce a moving-block system on any working railway, dispensing with currently available signalling and track circuiting system.<br>
The ACD works in all kinds of signalling territory whether they are automatic block system or block section working on tokens which are the oldest systems currently surviving - that means any category of signalling from the oldest category to the most sophisticated category, the ACDs function independently and ensure that no collision takes ptace at a speed Yiigher than 15 kmpTn so long as both tine moving objects are fitted with the ACDs.<br>
The above description and illustration are given just to understand the invention rather than to limit its scope. The ACD referred herein for trains can also be similarly adopted and used for any other transportation system.<br>
