[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/956,590, filed on August 17, 2007. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to engine control systems, and<br>
more particularly to fuel control systems for internal combustion engines.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The background description provided herein is for the purpose<br>
of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently<br>
named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well<br>
as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the<br>
time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
[0004] A fuel control system reduces emissions of a gasoline engine.<br>
The fuel control system may include an inner feedback loop and an outer<br>
feedback loop. The inner feedback loop may use data from an exhaust gas<br><br>
oxygen (EGO) sensor arranged before a catalytic converter of the engine system<br>
(i.e., a pre-catalyst EGO sensor) to control an amount of fuel sent to the engine.<br>
[0005] For example, when the pre-catalyst EGO sensor senses a rich<br>
air/fuel ratio in an exhaust gas (i.e., non-burnt fuel vapor), the inner feedback<br>
loop may decrease a desired amount of fuel sent to the engine (i.e., decrease a<br>
fuel command). When the pre-catalyst EGO sensor senses a lean air/fuel ratio in<br>
the exhaust gas (i.e., excess oxygen), the inner feedback loop may increase the<br>
fuel command. This maintains the air/fuel ratio at true stoichiometry, or an ideal<br>
air/fuel ratio, improving the performance (e.g., the fuel economy) of the fuel<br>
control system.<br>
[0006] The inner feedback loop may use a proportional-integral control<br>
scheme to correct the fuel command. The fuel command may be further<br>
corrected based on a short term fuel trim or a long term fuel trim. The short term<br>
fuel trim may correct the fuel command by changing gains of the proportional-<br>
integral control scheme based on engine operating conditions. The long term<br>
fuel trim may correct the fuel command when the short term fuel trim is unable to<br>
fully correct the fuel command within a desired time period.<br>
[0007] The outer feedback loop may use information from an EGO<br>
sensor arranged after the converter (i.e., a post-catalyst EGO sensor) to correct<br>
the EGO sensors and/or the converter when there is an unexpected reading. For<br>
example, the outer feedback loop may use the information from the post-catalyst<br>
EGO sensor to maintain the post-catalyst EGO sensor at a required voltage<br>
level. As such, the converter maintains a desired amount of oxygen stored,<br><br>
improving the performance of the fuel control system. The outer feedback loop<br>
may control the inner feedback loop by changing thresholds used by the inner<br>
feedback loop to determine whether the air/fuel ratio is rich or lean.<br>
[0008] Exhaust gas composition affects the behavior of the EGO<br>
sensors, thereby affecting accuracy of the EGO sensor values. As a result, fuel<br>
control systems have been designed to operate based on values that are<br>
different than those reported. For example, fuel control systems have been<br>
designed to operate "asymmetrically," (i.e., the threshold used to indicate the<br>
lean air/fuel ratio is different than the threshold used to indicate the rich air/fuel<br>
ratio).<br>
[0009] Since the asymmetry is a function of the exhaust gas<br>
composition and the exhaust gas composition is a function of the engine<br>
operating conditions, the asymmetry is typically designed as a function of the<br>
engine operating conditions. The asymmetry is achieved indirectly by adjusting<br>
the gains and the thresholds of the inner feedback loop, requiring numerous tests<br>
at each of the engine operating conditions. Moreover, this extensive calibration<br>
is required for each powertrain and vehicle class and does not easily<br>
accommodate other technologies, including, but not limited to, variable valve<br>
timing and lift.<br>
SUMMARY<br>

catalyst exhaust gas oxygen (EGO) sensor and a control module. The pre-<br>
catalyst EGO sensor determines a pre-catalyst EGO signal based on an oxygen<br><br><br>
concentration of an exhaust gas. The control module determines a dither signal.<br>
The control module determines a fuel command based on the pre-catalyst EGO<br>
signal and the dither signal.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0021] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in<br>
no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of<br>
clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should<br>
be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It<br>
should be understood that steps within a method may be executed in different<br>
order without altering the principles of the present disclosure.<br><br>
[0022] As used herein, the term module refers to an Application<br>
Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that<br>
provide the described functionality.<br>
[0023] To reduce calibration costs associated with conventional fuel<br>
control systems, the fuel control system of the present disclosure allows for direct<br>
achievement of desired behavior, including asymmetric behavior. In other words,<br>
the fuel control system achieves the desired behavior through open loop control<br>
instead of closed loop control. Open loop control may include using a model that<br>
relates the desired behavior to a fuel command or a dither signal needed to<br>
achieve the desired behavior instead of a calibration of closed loop control gains.<br>
[0024] In particular, the fuel control system achieves the desired<br>
behavior of an oscillating oxygen concentration level of an exhaust gas of an<br>
engine system through open loop control. Such oscillations improve the<br>
performance of the fuel control system (i.e., prevent a low or a high oxygen<br>
storage level in a catalytic converter of the engine system). The fuel control<br>
system achieves the oscillating oxygen concentration level by determining a<br>
dither signal based on a model that relates the oscillating oxygen concentration<br>
level to the dither signal. The fuel control system applies the dither signal to the<br>
fuel command to cause the oscillations. In addition, the fuel control system<br>
tracks and corrects a frequency and a duty cycle (DC) of a signal based on the<br>
oscillating oxygen concentration level as described herein.<br><br>
[0025] Referring now to FIG. 1, an exemplary engine system 10 is<br>
shown. The engine system 10 includes an engine 12, an intake system 14, a<br>
fuel system 16, an ignition system 18, and an exhaust system 20. The engine 12<br>
may be any type of internal combustion engine with fuel injection. For example<br>
only, the engine 12 may include fuel injected engines, gasoline direct injection<br>
engines, homogeneous charge compression ignition engines, or other types of<br>
engines.<br>
[0026] The intake system 14 includes a throttle 22 and an intake<br>
manifold 24. The throttle 22 controls air flow into the engine 12. The fuel system<br>
16 controls fuel flow into the engine 12. The ignition system 18 ignites an air/fuel<br>
mixture provided to the engine 12 by the intake system 14 and the fuel system<br>
16.<br>
[0027] An exhaust gas created by combustion of the air/fuel mixture<br>
exits the engine 12 through the exhaust system 20. The exhaust system 20<br>
includes an exhaust manifold 26 and a catalytic converter 28. The catalytic<br>
converter 28 receives the exhaust gas from the exhaust manifold 26 and reduces<br>
toxicity of the exhaust gas before it leaves the engine system 10.<br>
[0028] The engine system 10 further includes a control module 30 that<br>
regulates operation of the engine 12 based on various engine operating<br>
parameters. The control module 30 is in communication with the fuel system 16<br>
and the ignition system 18. The control module 30 is further in communication<br>
with a mass air flow (MAF) sensor 32 and an exhaust gas oxygen (EGO) sensor<br>
arranged in the exhaust manifold 26 (i.e., a pre-catalyst EGO sensor 34).<br><br>
[0029] The MAF sensor 32 generates a MAF signal based on a mass<br>
of air flowing into the intake manifold 24. The pre-catalyst EGO sensor 34<br>
generates a pre-catalyst EGO signal based on an oxygen concentration level of<br>
the exhaust gas in the exhaust manifold 26.' The pre-catalyst EGO sensor 34<br>
includes a switching EGO sensor that generates the pre-catalyst EGO signal in<br>
units of voltage. The switching EGO sensor switches the pre-catalyst EGO<br>
signal to a low or a high voltage when the oxygen concentration level is lean or<br>
rich, respectively.<br>
[0030] Referring now to FIG. 2, the control module 30 is shown. The<br>
control module 30 includes a dither module 102, a correction factor module 104,<br>
and a fuel determination module 106. The dither module 102 receives data on<br>
engine operating conditions.<br>
[0031] For example only, the engine operating conditions may include,<br>
but are not limited to, a rotational velocity of a crankshaft (not shown) of the<br>
engine 12, an air pressure in the intake manifold 24, and/or a temperature of<br>
engine coolant. The dither module 102 is an open loop command generator that<br>
determines a dither signal based on the engine operating conditions. The control<br>
module 30 uses the dither signal to command oscillation of the oxygen<br>
concentration level of the exhaust gas in the exhaust manifold 26.<br>
[0032] The correction factor module 104 receives the dither signal and<br>
the pre-catalyst EGO signal. The correction factor module 104 determines a<br>
frequency and a DC of the dither signal. The DC of the dither signal is a<br><br>
proportion of the period of the dither signal that the voltage of the dither signal is<br>
high (i.e., not zero in value).<br>
[0033] The correction factor module 104 delays the frequency and the<br>
DC of the dither signal for a delay time period (i.e., until a fuel command of the<br>
control module 30 affects the pre-catalyst EGO signal). The correction factor<br>
module 104 determines the delay time period based on a number of cylinders of<br>
the engine 12 and a location of the pre-catalyst EGO sensor 34. The correction<br>
factor module 104 determines the delay time period further based on a<br>
measurement time period from when the control module 30 outputs the fuel<br>
command to the fuel system 16 to when the pre-catalyst EGO sensor 34<br>
generates the pre-catalyst EGO signal. A delay time period perioddeiay is<br>
determined according to the following relationship:<br>
(1) perioddelay = f(#, location, periodmeasure),<br>
where # is the number of cylinders, location is the location of the pre-catalyst<br>
EGO sensor 34, and periodmeasure is the measurement time period.<br>
[0034] The correction factor module 104 quantizes (i.e., converts into a<br>
discrete and/or digital signal) the pre-catalyst EGO signal and determines a<br>
frequency and a DC of the quantized pre-catalyst EGO signal. The correction<br>
factor module 104 compares the delayed frequency of the dither signal to the<br>
frequency of the quantized pre-catalyst EGO signal to determine a frequency<br>
correction factor. The correction factor module 104 compares the delayed DC of<br>
the dither signal to the DC of the quantized pre-catalyst EGO signal to determine<br>
a DC correction factor.<br><br>
[0035] The correction factor module 104 uses a proportional (P) control<br>
scheme to meet the delayed frequency and the delayed DC of the dither signal.<br>
The frequency correction factor includes a proportional offset based on the<br>
difference between the delayed frequency of the dither signal and the frequency<br>
of the quantized pre-catalyst EGO signal. A frequency correction factor Pf is<br>
determined according to the following equation:<br>
(2)	Pf =Kpf (fdither.(k-n)-fmeasure(k-n)),<br>
where Kpf is a predetermined proportional constant, fdither(k-n) is the delayed<br>
frequency of the dither signal, fmeasure(k-n) is the frequency of the quantized pre-<br>
catalyst EGO signal. The DC correction factor includes a proportional offset<br>
based on the difference between the delayed DC of the dither signal and the DC<br>
of the quantized pre-catalyst EGO signal. A DC correction factor PDC is<br>
determined according to the following equation:<br>
(3)	PDC = KpDC(DCdither(k - n)-DCmauured(k - n)),<br>
where KpDC is a predetermined proportional constant, DCdither(K-n) is the delayed<br>
DC of the dither signal, DCmeasured(k-n) is the DC of the quantized pre-catalyst<br>
EGO signal.<br>
[0036] The fuel determination module 106 receives the frequency<br>
correction factor, the DC correction factor, the DC of the dither signal, the<br>
frequency of the dither signal, the dither signal, and the pre-catalyst EGO signal.<br>
The fuel determination module 106 further receives the MAF signal. The fuel<br>
determination module 106 determines whether either of the correction factors is<br>
saturated. The frequency correction factor is saturated when it is so small in<br><br><br>
value that it corrects effectively no voltage switching in the dither signal. The DC<br>
correction factor is saturated when it is almost 1 or 0 in value that it corrects<br>
effectively no voltage switching in the dither signal.<br>
[0037] If both of the correction factors are not saturated (i.e., in their<br>
linear range), the fuel determination module 106 compensates the frequency and<br>
the DC of the dither signal with the frequency correction factor and the DC<br>
correction factor, respectively. By compensating the frequency and the DC of the<br>
dither signal, the fuel determination module 106 corrects small errors between<br>
the delayed frequency and the delayed DC of the dither signal and the frequency<br>
and the DC of the quantized pre-catalyst EGO signal, respectively. The fuel<br>
determination module 106 determines a desired fuel command based on the<br>
compensated frequency of the dither signal, the compensated DC of the dither<br>
signal, the dither signal, and the MAF signal.<br>
[0038] If either of the correction factors is saturated, the fuel<br>
determination module 106 discretely integrates the frequency correction factor.<br>
The fuel determination module 106 scales the integrated frequency correction<br>
factor with the sign of the quantized pre-catalyst EGO signal to determine the<br>
desired fuel correction factor. The fuel determination module 106 uses a<br>
proportional-integral control scheme to determine the desired fuel correction<br>
factor.<br>
[0039] The desired fuel correction factor includes an offset based on a<br>
discrete integral of the difference between the delayed frequency of the dither<br><br>
signal and the frequency of the quantized pre-catalyst EGO signal. A desired<br>
fuel correction factor FuelPI is determined according to the following equation:<br><br>
where Kit is a predetermined integral constant and sign(EGOquant) is the<br>
quantized pre-catalyst EGO sign. The fuel determination module 106<br>
compensates the desired fuel command with the desired fuel correction factor to<br>
determine a compensated desired fuel command for the fuel system 16. By<br>
compensating the desired fuel command, the fuel determination module 106<br>
corrects large errors between the dither signal and the quantized pre-catalyst<br>
EGO signal.<br>
[0040] Referring now to FIG. 3, the correction factor module 104 is<br>
shown. The correction factor module 104 includes a dither frequency/DC module<br>
202, a delay module 204, a quantizer module 206, a pre-catalyst EGO frequency<br>
module 208, and a pre-catalyst EGO DC module 210. The correction factor<br>
module 104 further includes a subtraction module 212, a subtraction module 214,<br>
a P module 216, and a P module 218. The dither frequency/DC module 202<br>
receives the dither signal and determines a frequency of the dither signal (i.e., a<br>
dither frequency). The dither frequency/DC module 202 further determines a DC<br>
of the dither signal (i.e., a dither DC).<br>
[0041] The delay module 204 receives the dither frequency and the<br>
dither DC and determines the delay time period. The delay module 204 delays<br>
the dither frequency and the dither DC for the delay time period to determine a<br>
delayed dither frequency and a delayed dither DC. The quantizer module 206<br><br><br>
receives the pre-catalyst EGO signal and quantizes the pre-catalyst EGO signal<br>
to determine a quantized pre-catalyst EGO signal. The pre-catalyst EGO<br>
frequency module 208 receives the quantized pre-catalyst EGO signal and<br>
determines the frequency of the quantized pre-catalyst EGO signal (i.e., a pre-<br>
catalyst EGO frequency). The pre-catalyst EGO DC module 210 receives the<br>
quantized pre-catalyst EGO signal and determines the DC of the quantized pre-<br>
catalyst EGO signal (i.e., a pre-catalyst EGO DC).<br>
[0042] The subtraction module 212 receives the pre-catalyst EGO<br>
frequency and the delayed dither frequency and subtracts the pre-catalyst EGO<br>
frequency from the delayed dither frequency to determine a frequency error. The<br>
subtraction module 214 receives the pre-catalyst EGO DC and the delayed dither<br>
DC. The subtraction module 214 subtracts the pre-catalyst EGO DC from the<br>
delayed dither DC to determine a DC error. The P module 216 receives the<br>
frequency error and determines the frequency correction factor based on the<br>
frequency error. The P module 218 receives the DC error and determines the<br>
DC correction factor based on the DC error.<br>
[0043] Referring now to FIG. 4, the fuel determination module 106 is<br>
shown. The fuel determination module 106 includes a saturation check module<br>
302, a linear compensator module 304, a desired pre-catalyst EGO module 306,<br>
a summation module 308, a scaling module 310, and a saturated compensator<br>
module 312. The saturation check module 302 receives the frequency and the<br>
DC correction factors and determines whether either of the correction factors is<br>
saturated. When both of the correction factors are not saturated, the saturation<br><br>
check module 302 outputs the correction factors to the linear compensator<br>
module 304. When either of the correction factors is saturated, the saturation<br>
check module 302 outputs the frequency correction factor to the saturated<br>
compensator module 312.<br>
[0044] The linear compensator module 304 receives the frequency<br>
correction factor, the DC correction factor, the dither signal, the dither frequency,<br>
and the dither DC. The linear compensator module 304 compensates the dither<br>
frequency and the dither DC with the frequency correction factor and the DC<br>
correction factor, respectively. The linear compensator module 304 determines a<br>
unity compensated dither signal (i.e., with an amplitude of 1 in value) based on<br>
the compensated dither frequency and the compensated dither DC. A unity<br>
compensated dither signal Ditherunity is determined according to the following<br>
relationship:<br>
(5) Ditherunity = f(fdither + Pf, DCdither + PDC).<br>
[0045] The linear compensator module 304 further determines an<br>
amplitude of the dither signal. The linear compensator module 304 determines a<br>
compensated dither signal based on the unity compensated dither signal and the<br>
amplitude of the dither signal. By compensating the dither frequency and the<br>
dither DC, the linear compensator module 304 corrects small errors between the<br>
amplitudes of the dither signal and the quantized pre-catalyst EGO signal. This<br>
is because of the direct relationship between the dither frequency and the dither<br>
DC and a mean of the amplitude of the dither signal.<br><br>
[0046] The desired pre-catalyst EGO module 306 receives the data on<br>
the engine operating conditions. The desired pre-catalyst EGO module 306 is an<br>
open loop command generator. The desired pre-catalyst EGO module 306<br>
determines a desired pre-catalyst EGO signal based on a desired oxygen<br>
concentration level of the exhaust gas in the exhaust manifold 26. The desired<br>
pre-catalyst EGO module 306 determines the desired oxygen concentration level<br>
based on the engine operating conditions. The desired pre-catalyst EGO module<br>
306 determines the desired pre-catalyst EGO signal in units of equivalence ratio.<br>
[0047] The summation module 308 receives the desired pre-catalyst<br>
EGO signal and the compensated dither signal. The summation module 308<br>
adds the compensated dither signal to the desired pre-catalyst EGO signal to<br>
determine a dithered desired pre-catalyst EGO signal. The dithered desired pre-<br>
catalyst EGO signal oscillates about the desired oxygen concentration level. The<br>
compensated dither signal causes the oscillations, while the desired pre-catalyst<br>
EGO signal causes the oscillating about the desired oxygen concentration level.<br>
[0048] The scaling module 310 receives the dithered desired pre-<br>
catalyst EGO signal and the MAF signal. The scaling module 310 determines<br>
the desired fuel command based on the dithered desired pre-catalyst EGO signal<br>
and the MAF signal. A desired fuel command Fuel is determined according to<br>
the following equation:<br>
(6) Fuel = AFRstolch x MAF(EGOdes + Adither x Ditherunity ),<br>
where AFRstolch is a predetermined air-fuel ratio at stoichiometry (e.g., 1:14.7 for<br>
typical fuels), MAF is the MAF signal, EGOdes is the desired pre-catalyst EGO<br><br><br>
signal, and Adither is the amplitude of the dither signal. The desired fuel command<br>
oscillates due to the oscillations of the dithered desired pre-catalyst EGO signal.<br>
[0049] The saturated compensator module 312 receives the desired<br>
fuel command, the frequency correction factor, and the quantized pre-catalyst<br>
EGO signal. The saturated compensator module 312 integrates the frequency<br>
correction factor. The saturated compensator module 312 scales the integrated<br>
frequency correction factor with the sign of the quantized pre-catalyst EGO signal<br>
to determine the desired fuel correction factor. The saturated compensator<br>
module 312 compensates the desired fuel command with the desired fuel<br>
correction factor to determine the compensated desired fuel command for the<br>
fuel system 16. A compensated desired fuel command FuelCOmp is determined<br>
according to the following equation:<br>
(7) Fuelcomp= Fuel + Fuelpf.<br>
[0050] Referring now to FIG. 5, the linear compensator module 304 is<br>
shown. The linear compensator module 304 includes a summation module 402,<br>
a summation module 404, a dither generator module 406, a dither amplitude<br>
module 408, and a multiplication module 410. The summation module 402<br>
receives the frequency correction factor and the dither frequency. The<br>
summation module 402 adds the frequency correction factor to the dither<br>
frequency to determine a compensated dither frequency.<br>
[0051] The summation module 404 receives the DC correction factor<br>
and the dither DC and adds the DC correction factor to the dither DC to<br>
determine a compensated dither DC. The dither generator module 406 receives<br><br><br>
the compensated dither frequency and the compensated dither DC. The dither<br>
generator module 406 generates the unity compensated dither signal based on<br>
the compensated dither frequency and the compensated dither DC.<br>
[0052] The dither amplitude module 408 receives the dither signal and<br>
determines the amplitude of the dither signal (i.e., a dither amplitude). The<br>
multiplication module 410 receives the dither amplitude and the unity<br>
compensated dither signal. The multiplication module 410 scales the unity<br>
compensated dither signal with the dither amplitude to determine the<br>
compensated dither signal.<br>
[0053] Referring now to FIG. 6, the saturated compensator module 312<br>
is shown. The saturated compensator module 312 includes a discrete integrator<br>
module 412, a pre-catalyst EGO sign module 414, a multiplication module 416,<br>
and a summation module 418. The discrete integrator module 412 receives the<br>
frequency correction factor. The discrete integrator module 412 discretely<br>
integrates the frequency correction factor to determine an integrated frequency<br>
correction factor. The pre-catalyst EGO sign module 414 receives the pre-<br>
catalyst EGO signal, quantizes the discrete pre-catalyst EGO signal, and<br>
determines a sign of the quantized pre-catalyst EGO signal.<br>
[0054] The multiplication module 416 receives the integrated frequency<br>
correction factor and the sign of the quantized pre-catalyst EGO signal. The<br>
multiplication module 416 scales the integrated frequency correction factor with<br>
the sign of the quantized pre-catalyst EGO signal to determine the desired fuel<br>
correction factor. The summation module 418 receives the desired fuel<br><br>
correction factor and the desired fuel command. The summation module 418<br>
adds the desired fuel correction factor to the desired fuel command to determine<br>
the compensated desired fuel command.<br>
[0055] Referring now to FIG. 7, a flowchart depicts exemplary steps<br>
performed by the control module 30. Control starts in step 502. In step 504, the<br>
dither signal (i.e., Dither) is determined. In step 506, the dither frequency and the<br>
dither DC are determined based on the dither signal.<br>
[0056] In step 508, the delay time period is determined. In step 510,<br>
the delayed dither frequency is determined based on the dither frequency and<br>
the delay time period, and the delayed dither DC is determined based on the<br>
dither DC and the delay time period. In step 512, the pre-catalyst EGO signal<br>
(i.e., Pre-Catalyst EGO) is determined.<br>
[0057] In step 514, the quantized pre-catalyst EGO signal (i.e.,<br>
Quantized Pre-Catalyst EGO) is determined based on the pre-catalyst EGO<br>
signal. In step 516, the pre-cataiyst EGO frequency and the pre-catalyst EGO<br>
DC are determined based on the quantized pre-catalyst EGO signal. In step<br>
518, the frequency error is determined based on the delayed dither frequency<br>
and the pre-catalyst EGO frequency, and the DC error is determined based on<br>
the delayed dither DC and the pre-catalyst EGO DC.<br>
[0058] In step 520, the frequency and the DC correction factors are<br>
determined based on the frequency and DC errors, respectively. In step 522,<br>
control determines whether the frequency correction factor is saturated. If false,<br>
control continues in step 524. If true, control continues in step 526.<br><br>
[0059] In step 524, control determines whether the DC correction factor<br>
is saturated. If true, control continues in step 526. If false, control continues in<br>
step 528. In step 526, the integrated frequency correction factor is determined<br>
based on the frequency correction factor.<br>
[0060] In step 530, the sign of the quantized pre-catalyst EGO signal is<br>
determined based on the pre-catalyst EGO signal. In step 532, the desired fuel<br>
correction factor is determined based on the integrated frequency correction<br>
factor and the sign of the quantized pre-catalyst EGO signal. Control continues<br>
in step 534.<br>
[0061] In step 528, the compensated dither frequency is determined<br>
based on the dither frequency and the frequency correction factor, and the<br>
compensated dither DC is determined based on the dither DC and the DC<br>
correction factor. In step 536, the unity compensated dither signal (i.e., Unity<br>
Compensated Dither) is determined based on the compensated dither frequency<br>
and the compensated dither DC. In step 538, the dither amplitude is determined<br>
based on the dither signal.<br>
[0062] In step 540, the compensated dither (i.e., Compensated Dither)<br>
signal is determined based on the unity compensated dither signal and the dither<br>
amplitude. In step 542, the desired pre-catalyst EGO signal (i.e., Desired Pre-<br>
Catalyst EGO) is determined. In step 544, the dithered desired pre-catalyst EGO<br>
signal (i.e., Dithered Desired Pre-Catalyst EGO) is determined based on the<br>
compensated dither signal and the desired pre-catalyst EGO signal.<br><br>
[0063] In step 546, the MAF signal (i.e., MAF) is determined. In step<br>
548, the desired fuel command (i.e., Desired Fuel) is determined based on the<br>
dithered desired pre-catalyst EGO signal and the MAF signal. In step 534, the<br>
compensated desired fuel command (i.e., Compensated Desired Fuel) is<br>
determined based on the desired fuel correction factor and the desired fuel<br>
command. Control returns to step 504.<br>
