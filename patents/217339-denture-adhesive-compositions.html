				<td>                          BECKGROUND OF THE INVENTION <br>
Ordinary removable dentures, dental plates and the like, comprise teeth mounted in a suitable plate or base. Denture stabilizers are used to fill the interstices between the dentures and the gums or tissues. Prior to placement of the denture in the oral cavity, a denture stabilizer is applied to the denture-plate surface which, for a perfect fit, should uniformly contact the gums and mucous tissues. The denture stabilizer is formulated not only for its adherent properties, but also to provide a cushion or gasket between the denture and the gums or tissues, thereby positioning the denture securely in the oral cavity.<br>
Considerable effort has been made over the years to develop improved denture adhesive compositions. Both synthetic and natural polymers and gums have been used singly, in combination, and in combination with various adhesives and other materials in an attempt to lessen certain deficiencies. These deficiencies include inadequate holding power, oozing of the adhesive from under the dental plate during insertion and throughout the wearing period, and messiness and difficulty of removing the residual adhesive from the mouth and dentures. Additionally, food may become trapped between the denture and the oral cavity of the wearer.<br>
Alkyl vinyl ether-maleic copolymers and salts thereof are known in the art for use in denture adhesive compositions. Such disclosures include: U.S. Patent 3,003,988 to Germann et al., issued October 10, 1961; U.S. Patent 4,980,391 to Kumar et al., issued December 25, 1990; U.S. Patent 5,073,604 to Holeva et al., issued December 17, 1991; U.S. Patent 5,900,470, Prosise et al., issued May 4, 1999; U.S. Patent 5,037,924, Tazi et al, issued August 6,1991; U.S. Patent 5,082,913, Tazi et al., issued January 21, 1992; and U.S. Patent 5,525,652 to Clarke, issued June 11, 1996.        In   addition   strip   or  insert<br>
denture adhesives are also known. For example, U.S. Patent 4,880,702 to Homan et al., issued 11/14/89 discloses a denture stabilizer in the form of a strip consisting of three layers. The two outside layers consist of a polymer selected from the group consisting of polyethylene oxide having an average molecular weight of about 200,000 to 10,000,000, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. The inside layer consists of microcrystalline wax and a polymer sufficient to adhere the inside layer to gums and a denture base, after contact with water, when the outside layers have been dissolved. European Patent Application 0,353,375 to Altwirth published 2/7/90, discloses an adhesive insert for dentures consisting of a adhesive permeated fibrous fleece and an adhesive consisting of a pasty mixture of alginate and/or carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinyl acetate and an alcoholic solvent. Despite the above-noted technologies as well as many others, a need still exists for denture stabilizing compositions providing improved hold.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, it has been discovered that denture adhesive compositions comprising alkyl vinyl ether-maleic acid copolymers and/or terpolymers with isobutylene comprising magnesium and zinc mixed salts together with specific levels of free acid provide superior denture hold. The present denture adhesive compositions may also be effectively used as a wound dressing, underwater adhesive, a bioadhesive, a delivery vehicle for other actives, and/or any other application that requires adhesion to skin or tissue, including cosmetic pore cleansing strips.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide alkyl vinyl ether-maleic copolymers and/or terpolymers comprising magnesium and zinc mixed salts, together with specific levels of free acid for adhesive compositions for firm hold, which may be used with dentures. These composition effectively hold dentures in place for a prolonged period of time.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a denture adhesive composition comprising mixed salts of an alkyl vinyl ether-maleic acid copolymer and/or terpolymers with isobutylene wherein the mixed salt contains a cationic salt function comprising, or in the alternative consists essentially of, from about 5% to about 50% zinc cations; from 0% to about 2.5% of a cation selected from the group consisting of iron, boron, aluminum, vanadium,<br>

In addition the present invention relates to denture adhesive compositions comprising the above composition and at least one non-adhesive self-supporting layer. The present denture adhesive compositions can optionally comprise one or more additional adhesive components. The present invention further relates to a method of increasing the adhesion of dentures to the oral cavity by applying the above compositions to dentures, directly to the oral cavity, palate or ridge of the oral cavity, or applying it to both, and thereafter securing the denture to the ridge or palate of the oral cavity.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a denture adhesive composition comprising a mixed salt of a copolymer of alkyl vinyl ether and maleic acid or anhydride, the mixed salt containing a cationic salt function consisting essentially of:<br>

More preferably, the term "free acid" refers only to the unreacted carboxyl groups (-COOH) of the AVE/MA and/or AVE/MA/IB.   The term "additional adhesive component", as used herein, refers to adhesives other than those described as essential AVE/MA and/or AVE/MA/IB mixed salts of the present invention.<br>
The percentages used herein to describe the mixed salt function of the copolymers or terpolymer are defined as the stoichiometric percent of the total initial carboxyl groups reacted on the polymer. All other percentages used herein are by weight unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Polymer<br>
The alkyl vinyl ether-maleic acid copolymer comprises the repeated structural unit:<br>
(Structure Removed) <br>
wherein R represents an alkyl radical, preferably a C1 to C5 alkyl radical, n is an integer greater than one representing the number of repeated occurrences of the structural unit in -a molecule of the polymer.<br>
The "terpolymer" or "terpolymer with isobutylene" means a terpolymer of maleic anhydride or acid, an alkyl vinyl ether (preferably with a C1-C5 alkyl radical), and isobutylene, having a structure of (A-B)n where A is maleic anhydride or acid and B is alkyl vinyl ether (preferably with a C1-C5 alkyl radical), and/or isobutylene. The specific viscosity of the starting anhydride or acid of the terpolymer is preferably at least about 5.5, preferably at least about 6, preferably measured as a 1% weight/volume solution of methyl ethyl ketone at 25°C. The terpolymer must contain at least some isobutylene.<br>
The present denture adhesive compositions comprise mixed salts of an AVE/MA copolymer and/or terpolymer wherein the mixed salt contains a cationic salt function comprising (or in the alternative consists essentially of) an effective adhesive amount of magnesium cations, from about 5% to about 50% zinc cations, from 0% to about 2.5% of a cation selected from the group consisting of iron, boron, aluminum, vanadium, chromium, manganese, nickel, copper, yttrium, titanium, and mixtures thereof, and an effective adhesive amount of a cation selected from the group consisting of calcium, strontium, and mixtures thereof, of the total initial carboxyl groups reacted, the mixed salt containing from about 30% to about 60% free acid component. The AVE/MA copolymers have a range of specific viscosities. For example, the specific viscosity is preferably from 1.2 to 14, as preferably measured as a 1% weight/volume solution of the starting anhydride or acid of the copolymer, in methyl ethyl ketone at 25 °C. Other methods and solvents can be used to measure the specific viscosity such as a 1%<br>
weight/volume solution in DMF (dimethyl formamide) at 25°C and a 1% weight/volume solution in 2-butanone at 25°C.<br>
Preferably, the total level of magnesium, calcium and strontium is from about 10% to about 60%, more preferably from about 15% to about 55%, of the initial carboxyl groups reacted. In addition, preferably the cationic salt function contains from about 10% to about 45% zinc, more preferably from about 15% to about 40% zinc cations, of the initial carboxyl groups reacted; preferably from about 0.001% to about 2.5 %, more preferably from about 0.01% to about 2% of a cation selected from the group consisting of iron, boron, aluminum, vanadium, chromium, manganese, nickel, copper, yttrium, titanium, and mixtures thereof, more preferably from about 0.01% to about 2% iron-cations, of the initial carboxyl groups reacted. Preferably the cationic salt function contains from about 37.5% to about 55%, more preferably from about 37.5% to about 50%, free acid component, of the total initial carboxyl groups.<br>
The   alkyl   vinyl   ether  maleic   anhydride   copolymers   are  obtained   by co-polymerizing an alkyl vinyl ether monomer, such as methyl vinyl ether, ethyl vinyl ether, divinyl ether, propyl vinyl ether and isobutyl vinyl ether, with maleic anhydride to yield the  corresponding  alkyl  vinyl   ether-maleic   anhydride  copolymer which  is  readily hydrolyzable to the acid copolymer. Suitable copolymers may be prepared by well-known methods of the prior art, for example US 2,782,182, and US 2,047,398, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Both anhydride and acid forms are also available from commercial suppliers.   For example, the ISP Corporation, Wayne, N.J. provides both the polymeric free acid form (I) and the corresponding anhydride form under its "GANTREZ" trademark as the "GANTREZ S Series" and "GANTREZ AN Series", respectively.   When the anhydride copolymer dissolves in water, the anhydride linkage is cleaved so that the highly polar, polymeric free acid (I) is formed. Accordingly, the anhydride form, which is relatively less expensive than the acid form, may be used as a convenient  and cheaper precursor for the acid.     Elevated temperatures may be advantageously employed to enhance the rate of anhydride-to-acid hydrolysis.    The terpolymers can be made by the methods discussed in U.S. Patent 5,900,470, Prosise et al., issued May 4, 1999; U.S. Patent <br>
5,037,924, Tazi et al., issued Aug. 6, 1991; and U.S.<br>
Patent 5,082,913, Tazi et al., issued Jan. 21, 1992, herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
The salt form of the subject polymers may be prepared by the interaction of the AVE/M anhydride or acid copolymer or terpolymer with at least one cationic salt function, such as magnesium, zinc, calcium, sodium, potassium, iron, or ammonium compounds having a functional group typical of reactants of a carboxylic acid, such as, for example, the hydroxide, oxide, acetate, halide, lactate, etc. in an aqueous medium. In a preferred embodiment, the zinc oxide, magnesium oxide, combined with strontium carbonate and/or calcium hydroxide are utilized. Mixed polymer salts comprising iron cations can be prepared by the interaction of the AVE/M anhydride/acid polymers with -iron compounds, in the form of a salt, such as iron sulfate n-hydrate.<br>
Ions that form toxic, irritating or contaminating by-products should be avoided, or special precautions and treatment provided to assure the removal and absence of such byproducts from the polymeric salt end-product. The particular compound used should be substantially pure to assure obtaining a substantially pure, polymeric salt end-product.<br>
If the salt form of the polymer is desired, then an aqueous dispersion of particulate zinc oxide is combined with magnesium oxide (combined with strontium carbonate and/or calcium hydroxide) and, optionally, ferric sulfate n-hydrate. This is combined with the powder polymer, in the form of a slurry, in an amount sufficient to provide the desire cationic content desired in the end-product. This is done at ambient temperature and then slowly heated to 70°-95°C with continuous vigorous mixing so as to prevent localized precipitation of the cationic polymeric salt; mixing is continued to ensure that all the salt forming compound is reacted with the copolymer.<br>
Alternatively, the polymer is hydrolyzed and neutralized in an aqueous mixture or slurry of one or more divalent and/or monovalent metal bases by heating the copolymer/base mixture to a temperature ranging from about 45°C to about 100°C. Reaction of the mixed polymer salt with iron cations is obtained through addition of iron salts to the hydrolyzed and neutralized mixed salt of the polymer. Completion of the reaction with iron cations is indicated by an increase in viscosity to stabilization. Alternatively, iron salts may be blended with the polymer/metal base mixture prior to the hydrolysis and neutralization reactions.<br>
In either of the above processes, the resulting slurry or solution is transferred to<br>
shallow stainless steel drying trays and placed in a forced air mechanical convection oven<br>
at 60-70°C for a time sufficient to evaporate the reaction medium (water) and remove<br>
water from the polymer (about 18-24 hours).    Alternatively, the resulting slurry or<br>
soluti on can be drum-dried at 100° to 200°C with hot steam to evaporate the water<br>
content and recover the polymer in the flake form. After drying, the polymer forms brittle<br>
flakes which can easily be peeled off from the trays or drum surface and ground to a fine<br>
powder as desired to provide satisfactory denture stabilizing properties.    Methods of<br>
making these mixed salts of AVE/MA polymers are further disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,073,604, Holeva et al., issued Dec. 17, 1991; 5,872,161, Liang et al., issued Feb. 16,-<br>
1999; 5,830,933, Synodis et al., issued Nov. 3,1998, all of which are herein incorporated<br>
by reference in their entirety.<br>

The present compositions may be used as a denture adhesive and/or used as a bioadhesive on wet tissue such as mucosal tissues, wounds, oral mucosa, etc. The present adhesive compositions can be used to deliver one or more<br>
therapeutic actives suitable for topical administration to mucosal or wet tissues. The phrase "therapeutic actives", as used herein, describes agents which are pharmacologically active when absorbed through wet tissue or mucosal surfaces of the body such as the oral cavity, wounds, or applied to the surfaces of the skin. Therapeutic actives may be present at a level of from about 0% to about 70%, by weight of the composition.<br>
Therapeutic actives that are useful in the present compositions include antimicrobial agents such as iodine, sulfonamides, bisbiguanides, or phenolics; antibiotics such as tetracycline, neomycin, kanamycin, metronidazole, or clindamycin; antiinflammatory agents such as aspirin, acetaminophen, naproxen and its salts, ibuprofen, ketorolac, flurbiprofen, indomethacin, eugenol, or hydrocortisone; dentinal desensitizing-, agents such as potassium nitrate, strontium chloride or sodium fluoride; anesthetic agents such as lidocaine or benzocaine; anti-fungals; aromatics such as camphor, eucalyptus oil, flavors, fragrances, or sensates (warming or cooling agents), and aldehyde derivatives such as benzaldehyde; insulin; steroids; and anti-neoplasties. It is recognized that in certain forms of therapy, combinations of these agents in the same delivery system may be useful in order to obtain an optimal effect. Thus, for example, an antimicrobial and an anti-inflammatory agent may be combined in a single delivery system to provide combined effectiveness. Process for Preparation of the Composition<br>
A process for preparing denture adhesive compositions of the present invention (creams, powders, wafers, liquids, aerosols, pastes) comprises conventional methods disclosed in the art. Conventional methods are taught in US 5,525,652, issued June 11, 1996, Clarke et al.; US 3,003,988, issued Oct. 10, 1961, Germann et al.; US 5,073,604, Holeva et al., issued Dec. 17, 1991; and US 5,872,161, Liang et al., issued Feb. 16, 1999, all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
A process for the preparation of the present denture adhesive compositions optionally comprising a non-adhesive self-supporting layer, comprises coating a weighed amount of the adhesive components onto the non-adhesive self-supporting layer. This process is disclosed in US 5,877,233, Liang et al, issued March 2, 1999; US 5,872,160, issued 2/16/99, Liang et al.; US 5,880,172, Rajaiah et al., filed Oct. 25, 1996, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
The term "mixture", as used in this "Process for Preparation the Composition" section, refers to a solution, slurry, or suspension.<br>
The adhesive components may be coated on the non-adhesive self-supporting layer using various methods. These include: (a) wetting the non-adhesive self-supporting layer with water, uniformly sifting the adhesive component powder(s) onto the wet layer and then rewetting the layer with water; (b) dissolving the adhesive component(s) in water and/or other solvent(s) and coating the resulting mixture on the layer; (c) coating the layer with the mixture produced during AVE/MA polymer processing; (d) incorporating the adhesive component(s) into the layer as the layer is being formed; and (e) dissolving the adhesive component(s) in water and/or other solvent(s), wetting/coating. the resulting mixture onto the layer, and uniformly sifting one or more adhesives in powder form onto the wet/coated layer and optionally re-coating/re-wetting the layer with the mixture and/or water; (f) the method of step (e) repeated multiple times; and (g) any combination of the methods in (a) through (f) above.<br>
As disclosed above, the adhesive components may be dissolved in water and/or other solvents and the resulting mixture coated onto the layer. Solvents for the polymers include water and/or alcohols such as methanol, propanol, isopropanol, ethanol, butanol, 1,4-butanediol, cyciohexanol, and diethylene glycol; ethers or ether alcohols such as tetrahydrofuran, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, dioxane, and ethyl ether; esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate and sec-butyl acetate; aldehydes, ketones or ketone-alcohols such as benzaldehyde, formaldehyde solution, methyl ethyl ketone, diacetone alcohol, acetone, cyclohexanone, mesityl oxide, and methyl isobutyl ketone; lactams or lactones such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone, 2-pyrrolidone, and butyrolactone; hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, mineral spirits, mineral oil, and gasoline; chlorinated hydrocarbons such as carbon tetrachloride, chlorobenzene, chloroform, ethylene dichloride, methylene chloride; nitroparaffins such as nitroethane, and nitromethane; mercaptans such as thiophenol and 2-mercapto-l-ethanol; and others such as acetic acid, pyridine and dimethyl formamide.<br>
Preferred solvents for the polymers are water, methanol, propanol, isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran,  methyl  acetate,  benzaldehyde,  formaldehyde solution, methyl ethyl<br>
ketone, diacetone alcohol, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N-vinyl-2-pyrroIidone, dimethyl formamide and mixtures thereof. Compounds commonly used as plasticizers can also be used as solvents for the polymers. Such plasticizers include dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, glycercin, diethylene glycol, methylene glycol, Igepal® CO-630, Gafac ® RE-610, sorbitol, tricresyl phosphate, dimethyl sebacate, ethyl glycolate, ethylphthalyl ethyl glycolate, and p-toluene ethyl sulfonamide.<br>
Solvents for other adhesives such as CMC, which may be optionally included in the adhesive compositions include mixtures of water and water-miscible solvents such as ethanol and acetone. Solutions of low concentration can be made with up to 40% acetone and/or 50% alcohol. Other solvents which made be used include ethanolamines; ethylene glycol; glycerol; 1,2,6-hexanetriol; mono-, di-, and triacetin; 1,5-pentanediol; polyethylene glycol (molecular weight 600 or less); propylene glycol; and trimethylolpropane.<br>
When the adhesive compositions are prepared by dissolving the adhesive component(s) in water and/or other solvents, various embodiments of the process includes: dissolving the polymers in one or more of the solvents for polymers; dissolving an optional adhesive in a suitable solvent and coating the resulting mixture onto the non-adhesive self-supporting layer and then optionally sifting one or more adhesives onto the coated layer. Coating the layer can be achieved by techniques commonly known in the art including extrusion, doctor blading, spraying, dipping, etc.<br>
After the polymer has been deposited on the layer by one of the means described above, the layer is then dried. Next, the denture adhesive composition is mechanically softened by running it through a ring-roller or micro-cracker or any other suitable means. The composition is then pressed smooth in a hydraulic press or flat-roller or other suitable means. The composition is then die-cut into denture shapes. These shapes may facilitate application of the composition to the dentures.<br>
The following examples further describe and demonstrate embodiments within the scope of the present invention. The examples are given solely for the purpose of illustration and are not to be construed as limitations of the present invention. Many variations of these are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>

 (Table Removed) <br>
2 Gantrez AN 169 available from ISP Corporation, and/or AVE/MA copolymer with specific viscosity of 6.3 and/or 7.3.<br>
Weigh the above components and add to a 4 liter reaction vessel while mixing. Use 15% of water to pre-slurry all powders except the AVE/MA. Wash down the residual powders from the wall of the vessel. Then react the mixture at 80 to 95°C. Dry the solution in trays in an oven at 60 to 70°C. Mill ail dried flakes to a fine powder. Equivalent mixed salts of AVE/MA/IB can be obtained by the same method as above, substituting the AVE/MA/IB for AVE/MA, at various levels.<br>
EXAMPLE II Denture stabilizing compositions in cream form can be made by blending together the following ingredients:<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Weigh, heat and mix the red dye, petrolatum, and mineral oil in a glass jar at 50 to 60°C until visually uniform. Then weigh and shake-blend the powders (colloidal silicon dioxide, CMC, AVE/MA copolymer mixed salt or AVE/MA/IB mixed salt) together in a container. Thereafter, mix the powders into the liquid with a spatula until visually a uniform pink cream. The above cream can be modified by increasing or decreasing the level of AVE/MA mixed salt or AVE/MA/IB mixed salt by 0 to 18.75 grams, petrolatum by 0 to 18.75 grams, and/or the CMC by 0 to 18.75 grams. The above cream composition can also be modified by using mixtures of the various AVE/MA mixed polymer salts and/or AVE/MA/IB mixed<br>
salts.   The subject places from   0.1 to 2 grams of the cream composition on the denture. Then the subject inserts the denture into his/her mouth and presses it into place.<br>
EXAMPLE ffl Denture stabilizing compositions in powder form can be made by blending together the following ingredients:<br><br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Blend all components together. The above compositions can be modified by increasing or decreasing the AVE/MA mixed salt or AVE/MA/EB mixed polymer salt by 0 to 50 grams and/or the CMC by 0 to 40 grams. The above powder compositions can also be modified by using mixtures of the various AVE/MA mixed salts and/or AVE/MA/IB mixed salts. The subject places from 0.1 to 2 grams of the composition on a pre-moistened denture, allowing it to hydrate briefly. Then the subject inserts the denture into his/her mouth and presses it into place.<br>
EXAMPLE IV Denture stabilizing compositions in wafer form can be made by wetting a 58" by 20" non-woven polyester (non-adhesive self-supporting layer) with water. Uniformly coat this wet sheet with the compositions listed below. Thereafter, rewet the layer with water. Dry the layer. Mechanically soften the composition by ring-roller, and then smooth the composition on a hydraulic press. Die-cut the composition into desired shapes. Moisten and apply these wafer compositions to the dentures. Then insert the denture into the mouth and press it into place.<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
These wafer compositions can be modified by increasing or decreasing the AVE/MA mixed polymer salt or AVE/MA/IB mixed polymer salt by 0 to 60 grams and/or CMC by 0 to 60 grams. The above wafer compositions can also be modified by using mixtures of the various AVE/MA mixed salts and/or AVE/MA/IB mixed polymer salt.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
