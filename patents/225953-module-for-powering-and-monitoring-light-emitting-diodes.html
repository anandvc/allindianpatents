				<td>MODULE FOR POWERING AND MONITORING LIGHT-EMITTING DIODES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the electric power supply of light-emitting loads,<br>
in particular light-emitting diode (LED) lamps that require remote monitoring.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Light-emitting diode (LED) lamps are becoming more and more popular in<br>
automotive traffic lights, railway signal lights and other applications. Their lower<br>
power consumption is an attractive feature, but the main reason for their<br>
popularity is their long life (100 000 hours) compared to standard incandescent<br>
lamps (5 000 hours). Manifestly, these features allow important reduction in<br>
maintenance costs.<br>
In certain applications, such as railway signal lights, these lamps may be used,<br>
as those skilled in the art would know, for main line signalling and/or grade<br>
crossing signalling. Grade crossing signals are usually situated in populated<br>
areas such as road intersections and redundant signals are used. Remote<br>
monitoring of the LED lamps in grade crossing signals is therefore not common.<br>
Main line signals, on the other hand, can be installed in remote areas, which are<br>
not easily accessible. Remote monitoring for checking the integrity of the lamps<br>
signals is therefore common practice in order to be able to downgrade the<br>
aspect in case of a detected signal failure.<br>
For lamps equipped with standard incandescent bulb, electrical integrity can be<br>
easily verified. If the filament of the incandescent bulb is in normal condition,<br>
current flows through the bulb according to Ohm's law (I = V/R). Otherwise, if the<br>
filament is open, no current flows through the bulb and it should be replaced.<br>
For LED lamps, however, LED current is controlled by a power supply. Current<br>
characteristics are therefore not identical in a LED lamp and in an incandescent<br>
lamp. In a LED lamp, alternative current (ac) line voltage is rectified and then<br>
converted to a suitable level by a dc-dc (direct current) converter, which also<br>
regulates LED current. In case of LED failure, or failure of any other electrical<br>
component in the LED lamp, it is possible for the power supply to continue<br>
drawing current at or near the nominal current value, even if the LED's are not<br><br>
emitting any light. Remote monitoring systems could therefore see the LED lamp<br>
as functioning correctly when in reality it is not. This situation is not acceptable<br>
since it can lead to very hazardous train operations and cause major accidents.<br>
Another problem, related to LED lamps and their power supplies and controllers,<br>
is caused by electric components which retain residual voltage differentials after<br>
power is removed from the LED lamp. The resulting characteristic is that a LED<br>
lamp will effectively light up when the power applied to it reaches a first high<br>
level while it will be turned off only when the power reaches a second lower<br>
level. The resulting problem is that if a certain power is induced by, for example,<br>
other nearby cables, the LED lamp could remain on while in fact it should be off.<br>
This could also lead to dangerous situations.<br>
These particularities of LED lamps limit their widespread use in situations where<br>
they need to be remotely monitored such as in railway main line signalling<br>
applications.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is therefore to allow LED lamps to become<br>
compatible with remote detection systems designed for monitorina , of<br>
incandescent lamps.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide LED lamp circuitry which will<br>
emulate an incandescent lamp's behavior upon remote monitoring of the LED<br>
lamp.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a control circuit for<br>
enabling/disabling the power supply to LED lamps in relation to the level of the<br>
line voltage<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to Figure 1, a dc (direct current) line voltage is supplied to an LED<br>
(light-emitting diodes) module 1 via line 11. The LED module 1 consists of a<br>
functional circuitry 10, a PCB (printed circuit board) LED light source array 12<br>
and a safety circuitry 14.<br>
The functional circuitry 10 includes an input power switch circuit 22 (shown in<br>
Figure 2) that typically converts a + 10 Vdc input voltage to an 100 mA output<br>
constant current for the Red, White and Yellow LEDs, and 60 mA for the Green<br>
LEDs of the LED light source array 12.<br>
The safety circuitry 14 includes a fuse blow out circuit 30 and a LED current<br>
detector circuit 38 (shown in Figure 2) that monitors the LED's current and turns<br>
off permanently the input power switch circuit 22 (see Figure 2) by blowing the<br>
FBO fuse when the LEDs current is typically below 20% of its nominal value.<br>
The PCB LED light source array 12 may be, for example, a matrix of high-<br>
brightness 5 mm LEDs configured for redundancy. As will be described further<br>
below, the current flowing in the LEDs is regulated by a PSU's (Power Supply<br>
Unit) feedback loop providing constant light flow. The LEDs preferably form a<br>
pattern made of 4 columns (one group of 4 LEDs connected in parallel) by 22<br>
rows (22 groups connected in series) for the Red LEDs, 4 x 33 for the Yellow<br>
LEDs and 6 x 15 for the Green and White LEDs. In case of an LED failure in a<br>
group over the course of operation, the current is redistributed to the other LEDs<br>
of the same group and the signal maintains its light output. The LEDs are also<br>
more generally referred to in the present specification as light-emitting diode<br>
loads. Various embodiments of LED arrays can be used. These embodiments<br>
are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and, accordingly, will not be<br>
further described in the present specification.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2, the LED module 1 may be made of 3 physical parts:<br>
the PCB LED array 12, a dummy load 16 and a PCB PSU (power supply unit)<br>
18.<br>
DUMMY LOAD<br>
The input line current is monitored by the system LOD (light out detection)<br>
function that consists to check if the lamp is functional or not. In a preferred<br><br>
embodiment, the module 1 detects a Light Out if the input current is below a pre-<br>
determined value.<br>
The PSU 18 regulates the LEDs current in order to maintain constant light<br>
intensity. The power stage circuit 20 provides output constant power and<br>
assuming that the internal losses are almost constant for different input voltage<br>
conditions, it could be assumed that the input power delivered to the PSU 18 is<br>
constant. Having a constant input power, the line current amplitude is higher at<br>
8Vdc and lower at 16Vdc. In terms of input impedance, the PSU 18 has a<br>
negative slope resistance.<br>
A dummy load resistor 16 may be added across the input line to cancel out the<br>
negative slope effect of the PSU's input impedance. The input power switch<br>
circuit 22 isolates the dummy load when the PSU 18 is off.<br>
PSU PCB<br>
The +10Vdc input line voltage is fed to the PSU PCB 18 via the connector J3.<br>
The connector J3 provides also an interface connection to feed the +10Vdc to<br>
the dummy load resistor 16 when the power switch circuit 22 turns on. The<br>
PSU's power stage circuit 20 converts the +10Vdc to a constant current that<br>
flows in the LEDs 12 via the wiring cable 24 connected to connector J1 and the<br>
LED array PCB connector 26.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the PSU 18 provides the following functions that will be<br>
described below:<br>
-	protected input filter circuit 28;<br>
-	input power switch circuit 22;<br>
-	fuse blow out (FBO) circuit 30;<br>
-	cold filament test (CFT) circuit 32;<br>
-	start-up circuit 34;<br>
-	power stage circuit 20;<br>
-	bleeder circuit 36;<br>
-	LED current detection circuit 38;<br>
CONNECTORS<br>
The connector J3 is a 4 circuits connector that is used to mate the +10Vdc<br>
voltage source and the dummy load wires with AWG16 wires, as shown in<br><br>
Figure 3. The connectors J2 and J4 that are illustrated in Figure 3 are used only<br>
for testing the PSU 18 during the manufacturing process to verify the main<br>
functions of the PSU 18.<br>
PROTECTED INPUT FILTER CIRCUIT<br>
Referring to Figures 2 and 3, the protected input filter circuit 28 provides<br>
protection against the PSU's internal overload, input voltage reverse polarity and<br>
line voltage surges. The protected input filter circuit 28 filters the switching<br>
frequency of the power stage input current in order to meet FCC conducted and<br>
radiated FCC Class A EMC.<br>
Referring to Figure 3, the fuse F1 provides protection against overload greater<br>
than 2A. The power supply has a constant output current and that condition will<br>
occur only when a component fails short as described above.<br>
The diode D1 provides protection against reverse polarity connection. The diode<br>
D1 may be a MUR420 diode having a current rating of 4A and can handle the<br>
input line current that can vary between 1.2 and 2A.<br>
The PSU 18 may withstand a surge of 1000 volts 1.2/50 μs open circuit voltage<br>
and a 8/20 μs short circuit current surge having a source impedance of 2 ohms.<br>
The varistor V1 clamps VIN to 170V when subjected to these threats.<br>
The switching frequency of the power stage input current is filtered by L1 and<br>
C1. Measurements of the conducted and radiated emission show that the EMC<br>
specifications are met.<br>
INPUT POWER SWITCH CIRCUIT<br>
Railroads safety issue requires a circuit to control the turn-on and turn-off of the<br>
LED module 1. The implementation of the input power switch circuit 22 of the<br>
PSU 18 provides such protection against out of range low input voltage.<br>
The input power switch circuit 22 has a turn-on feature that monitors the input<br>
line voltage. The specifications typically require to turn on the light signal at<br>
8Vdc and to turn it off at 4Vdc. The input power switch circuit 22 is therefore<br>
designed to turn on when the input line voltage exceeds 7Vdc and turns off<br>
below 5.5Vdc providing sufficient margins.<br>
Referring to Figure 3, there is shown a combined protected input filter and input<br>
power switch circuit. The input power switch circuit 22 shown in Figure 2 is<br><br>
linked to the input voltage by a 125 mA fuse F70 that is shown in Figure 3. The<br>
fuse F70 blows when a FBO (fuse blow out) command is enabled at line F2.<br>
That way the PSU 18 will turn off and the CFT (cold filament test) circuit 32 will<br>
detect a failure by the system's controller as will be explained further below.<br>
Also, to make sure that upon physical damage of the signal (by bullet or other<br>
impact) the input switch is kept off, a serpentine trace 42 (shown in Figure 10) is<br>
added in series with fuse F70 all around the PSU 18. This trace 42 occupies a<br>
complete layer of a multi-layer PCB so that if a bullet penetrates the power<br>
supply PCB 18 or if the power supply's PCB 18 is damaged, the trace 42 opens.<br>
This is equivalent as having the fuse F70 blown and ensures detection of a dark<br>
signal in case of physical damage.<br>
Referring to figure 3, the function of diode D70 is to prevent capacitor C70 from<br>
discharging when the FBO command is activated at line F2. This occurs when<br>
fuse F70 is shorted to ground. The energy bank of capacitor C70 keeps<br>
MOSFETs Q70 and Q71 on long enough to blow fuse F70 when the FBO circuit<br>
30 is activated. The resistor R70 provides the adequate time constant with<br>
capacitor C70 to allow the FBO circuit 30 to open fuse F70 when required.<br>
Furthermore, the resistor R70 limits the inrush current through fuse F70 at turn-<br>
on.<br>
The MOSFETs Q70 and Q71 which act as a power switch provide the function<br>
of a solid state switch that isolates the power stage circuit 20 when the input<br>
voltage is below the input voltage range. The MOSFETs Q70 and Q71 turn on<br>
when the voltage at line 3 of comparator U70A reaches 1.225V and turns off<br>
when it is below it. Diode D71 is a 1.225V high precision voltage reference diode<br>
that is stable under temperature variations. Resistor R73 limits the bias current<br>
of diode D71. Resistors R71 and R72 form the voltage divider that reduces down<br>
the input voltage to be compared to the voltage reference. The comparators<br>
U70A and U70B combined with the hysteresis resistor R74 provide noise<br>
immunity against false triggering signals. Diode D75 forces line 1 of comparator<br>
U70A to LOW when comparator U70B reacts faster than comparator U70A. Line<br>
7 of comparator U70B provides the interface command of the MOSFETs Q70<br>
and Q71 acting as the power switch.<br><br>
Diodes D71, D72, D73 and D74 provide immunity against the varistor V1<br>
clamped voltage lightning surge. Resistor R77 limits the current when input line<br>
voltage surge occurs.<br>
LED CURRENT DETECTION CIRCUIT<br>
Referring to Figure 4, the LED current detection circuit 38 disables the FBO,<br>
CFT and start-up circuits 30, 32, 34 when the LED current exceeds 20% of its<br>
nominal value. If the LED current does not reaches 20% of INOM within 300 ms<br>
then the FBO circuit 30 blows out F70 and the PSU 18 turns off.<br>
In the current detection circuit 38, the voltage sense Vs (the voltage across the<br>
current sense resistor) is compared to a reference voltage. In normal operation,<br>
voltage sense Vs is regulated at 2.5V and the reference voltage is set at 17% of<br>
the nominal value. The 4.7V zener diode D53 is biased by resistor R57 from<br>
voltage Vcc to provide voltage VREF and the voltage divider resistors R58 and<br>
R59 reduce voltage VREF to 0.43V or 17% of nominal current INOM providing a<br>
margin of 3%. Voltage sense Vs is applied at line 6 of comparator U50B<br>
(inverted input) and the 0.45V reference voltage at line 5 of comparator U50B<br>
(non-inverted input). At turn-on, voltage sense Vs is 0V and the comparator<br>
output at line 7 of comparator U50B-7 is floating (LM2903 is an open collector<br>
comparator) which enable the FBO, CFT and start-up circuits 30, 32, 34 to<br>
operate. Typically after 50 ms, voltage sense Vs reaches 0.43V and line 7 of<br>
comparator U50B is shorted to ground to disable the FBO, CFT and start-up<br>
circuits 30, 32, 34. The time taken by voltage sense Vs to reach 0.43V depends<br>
directly to the input line voltage amplitude, the amount of LEDs in series and the<br>
forward voltage of the LEDs.<br>
FUSE BLOW OUT (FBO) CIRCUIT<br>
Referring to Figure 5, the fuse blow out (FBO) circuit 30 forces the fuse F70 to<br>
blow out when the LED current is lower than 20% of its nominal value. If that<br>
condition occurs, the link between voltage V|N and the input power switch circuit<br>
22 is permanently opened, as the MOSFETs Q70 and Q71 open and the PSU<br>
18 turns off. The LED module 1 will then be unusable anymore and the system's<br>
CFT (cold filament test) circuit 32 detects a failure.<br><br>
A time delay circuit 40 has been implemented in order to provide enough time to<br>
the PSU 18 to turn on (100 to 170 ms) and sufficiently short to blow the fuse F70<br>
in a flashing mode (330 ms). The time delay is obtained from the time constant<br>
given by resistors R50, R51 and capacitor C50. Capacitor C50 (1uF) charges<br>
through resistor R50 (523k) up to half VREF (2.4V) and is fed to line 3 of<br>
comparator U50A via resistor R53. At turn-off, resistor R51 provides a path to<br>
ground to discharge capacitor C50. In order to minimize the offset voltage of the<br>
comparator U50A, the resistance value of resistor R52 matches the input<br>
impedance at line 3 of comparator U50A (parallel combination of resistors R53<br>
and R54). Resistors R53 and R54 provide the comparator threshold voltage, at<br>
line 2 of comparator U50A, which matches 63% of half VREF (1.5V). Capacitor<br>
C50 being 1u.F, the time delay is easily computed by dividing the value of<br>
resistor R53 by 2 where the result is in milliseconds (1uF x 523k/2 = 262 ms).<br>
At turn-on, capacitor C50 charges only during 50 ms, typically, and is clamped<br>
by diode D50 to ground by line 7 of comparator U50B when 20% of LED current<br>
ILED is reached, as described above with regard to the Led current detection<br>
circuit 38. The clamping voltage is about 0.5V at 25°C and will vary at hot and<br>
cold temperature. In case of a failure occurrence, where line 7 of comparator<br>
U50B is floating after turn-on, then capacitor C50 starts charging from 0.5V<br>
toward 2.4V and reaches a 1.5V comparator threshold voltage faster but this<br>
does not cause any concern. Line 1 of comparator U50A becomes floating when<br>
capacitor C50 charges above 1.5V, voltage VCC is applied to the gate of the<br>
power MOSFET Q50 via resistor R55, MOSFET Q50 saturates pulling to ground<br>
diode D55, and the + 10Vdc input voltage appears across fuse F70 and fuse F70<br>
blows out. In normal operation, line 7 of comparator U50B is shorted to ground,<br>
line 1 of comparator U50A maintains the MOSFET's Q50 gate to ground and<br>
the FBO command is disabled. Diode D54 limits the gate-source voltage of<br>
MOSFET Q50 below its maximum limit of 20V. The purpose of diode D55 is to<br>
isolate fuse F70 from voltage Vcc when the FBO circuit 30 is enabled.<br>
COLD FILAMENT TEST (CFT) CIRCUIT<br>
Originally, the Cold Filament Test (CFT) has been incorporated to verify if the<br>
filament of the incandescent lamp is open or not. The system controller supplies<br><br>
the lamp for 2 ms and checks the lamp current. Of course, 2 ms is too short for<br>
an incandescent lamp to radiate light and is sufficient to validate its status. The<br>
same test may be performed on the LED module 1 to check it.<br>
When the system controller applies the input voltage to the PSU 18, the input<br>
power switch circuit 22 turns on and capacitor C1 starts to charge up. The<br>
voltage across capacitor C1, VFL, is applied directly to the gate of MOSFET Q60<br>
via R60 (see Figure 6). Typically, MOSFET Q60 starts to conduct when VFL<br>
reaches 4.2V. VFL rises up to the +10Vdc input line voltage. MOSFET Q60<br>
saturates and connects resistors R61 and R62 to ground providing 7.5 ohms<br>
across the +10 Vdc input line voltage. The system controller starts monitoring the<br>
LED module's input current after the application of the input voltage and the<br>
current must be greater than a pre-determined value, otherwise the test fails.<br>
The load current of the CFT circuit 32 combined with the dummy load current<br>
and the inrush current of capacitor C1 during turn-on provides the necessary<br>
current at 8Vdc. Diode D60 limits the gate-source voltage of MOSFET Q60<br>
below its maximum limit of 20V.<br>
In normal operation during turn-on, the CFT circuit 32 stays enabled until 20% of<br>
the LED current is reached. Then, line 7 of comparator U50B (see Figure 4)<br>
goes low and the gate of MOSFET Q60 is kept below the gate threshold voltage<br>
via diode D52 disabling the CFT circuit 32.<br>
START-UP CIRCUIT<br>
Referring to Figure 7, the start-up circuit 34 that is shown in Figure 2 is a switch-<br>
mode boost converter that uses the voltage across capacitor C1, VFL, (shown in<br>
Figure 3) to generate voltage VCC. The duty cycle is constant and set to get an<br>
output voltage of 15V for an input voltage of 7V. The Pulse Width Modulator<br>
(PWM), U1 (shown in Figure 9), needs 15V to start up. The start-up circuit 34<br>
stays enabled until 20% of the LED current is reached. The start-up circuit stops<br>
feeding VCC and lines 6 and 10 of transformer T1 start feeding VCC via resistor<br>
R49 and diode D5 (shown in Figure 9).<br>
The boost converter is fed from VFL and is made of inductor L30, MOSFET Q30,<br>
diode D31 and capacitor C3. Inductor L30 builds energy in its core when<br>
MOSFET Q30 is ON and inductor L30 transfers its energy to capacitor C3 via<br><br>
diode D31 when MOSFET Q30 is OFF. MOSFET Q30 is driven at a constant<br>
rate of 50% provided by timer circuit U30 and the voltage at capacitor C3 is<br>
about twice VFL. Line 3 of timer circuit U30, SE555CN Timer, works in the<br>
astable mode where the duty cycle is set by resistors R33, R34 and capacitor<br>
C32. The supply voltage at line 8 of timer circuit U30 is limited to 14 V by diode<br>
D32. Voltage VFL could reach 36V for 80 ms. Resistor R31 is the bias resistor of<br>
diode D32. Capacitor C31 is a high frequency bypass capacitor used to filter the<br>
control voltage at line 5 of timer circuit U30. The reset at line 4 of timer circuit<br>
U30 is kept high by the pull-up resistor R32 to ensure the operation at line 3 of<br>
timer circuit U30. The start-up circuit 34 stays enabled until 20% of the LED<br>
current is reached. Then, line 7 of comparator U50B (shown in Figure 4) goes<br>
low pulling down to ground the reset pin at line 4 of timer circuit U30 to disable<br>
line 3 of timer circuit U30.<br>
QUICK-BLEEDER CIRCUIT<br>
Referring to Figure 8, the purpose of the quick-bleeder circuit 36 (also shown in<br>
Figure 2) is to turn off faster the LED module 1. The bleeder circuit 36 uses a<br>
peak voltage detector to monitor the switching waveform voltage of transformer<br>
T1. At turn-off, the switching waveform voltage disappears and a 1 Kohm<br>
resistor R1 is shunted across the output capacitor C7 to force capacitor C7 to<br>
discharge faster.<br>
The auxiliary voltage, VAUX, is a square waveform that is used to feed Vcc via<br>
diode D5 (shown in Figure 7). Capacitor C6 charges up to VAux via resistor R49<br>
and diode D8. Diode D8 prevents capacitor C6 from discharging when VAux is<br>
0V. Capacitor C6 discharges slowly through resistor R17 and transistor Q5,<br>
based on a time constant established by capacitor C6 and resistor R17.<br>
Capacitor C6 recharges at the beginning of each cycle of VAux. The saturation of<br>
transistor Q5 is maintained as long as the Voltage across capacitor C6 is<br>
sufficient to drive the base current such as the forced hFE is greater than 15<br>
(forced hFE = Ic /Ib). The collector of transistor Q5 forces the gate of transistor<br>
Q4 to ground thus keeping transistor Q4 OFF.<br>
The LED module turn-off command occurs when the system controller removes<br>
the +10Vdc from the input voltage line. The input power switch circuit 22 turns<br><br>
off and the switching waveform voltage VAux stops when the energy of the input<br>
filter made of inductor L1 and capacitor C1 vanishes. Capacitor C6 stops<br>
recharging and discharges slowly toward OV at a time rate of 100 us. After 500<br>
ujxs, transistor Q5 turns off, the gate of transistor Q4 charges up to 14V, limited<br>
by diode D9, via resistor R16. Transistor Q4 turns on when VGS exceeds 4.2V<br>
and resistor R1 is pulled down to ground. Capacitor C7 discharges through the<br>
LEDs and resistor R1. Without the use of the bleeder resistor R1, capacitor C7<br>
would discharge at a constant rate established by the characteristic VF - IF of the<br>
LEDs down to VF minimum. At VF minimum, IF is very small and capacitor C7<br>
would discharge even slower. The resultant would be that the LEDs would still<br>
emit light that would be detected by the eyes. Resistor R1 will force capacitor C7<br>
discharging down to 0V in a short period of time.<br>
BOOST POWER STAGE CIRCUIT<br>
Referring to Figure 9, the boost power stage circuit 20 that is shown in Figure 2<br>
is a switch-mode converter that transforms the + 10Vdc voltage across capacitor<br>
C1, VFL, to a constant output DC current to feed the LEDs. That way the LEDs<br>
emit constant light. A boost converter topology is used since the resultant<br>
voltage across the LEDs is 57V for 22 Red LEDs, 75V for 33 Yellow LEDs and<br>
52V for 15 Green LEDs.<br>
The Pulse Width Modulator, U1, starts up when VCC exceeds 15V. The power<br>
stage is fed from VFL and is made of transformer T1 (primary winding inductance<br>
at lines 1 and 5), MOSFET Q1, diode D7, and capacitor C7. Transformer T1 (at<br>
lines 1 and 5) builds energy in its core when MOSFET Q1 is ON and that energy<br>
is transferred to capacitor C7 via diode D7 when MOSFET Q1 is OFF. MOSFET<br>
Q1 is driven by line 7 of PWM U1 where resistor R8 limits the turn-on gate<br>
current.<br>
The Pulse Width Modulator, U1, (MC33262) does not have an oscillator but the<br>
operation frequency is determined by the power stage. The power stage is a<br>
peak detector current-mode boost converter that operates in critical conduction<br>
mode at a fixed on-time and variable off-time. The critical conduction mode is<br>
the boundary limit between the continuous and the discontinuous conduction<br>
mode of the power inductor current leading to stable current loop without the<br><br>
need of slope compensation. There is no switching loss at turn-on when using<br>
the critical mode.<br>
The off-time is determined when transformer T1 is completely discharged. The<br>
voltage at transformer T1 (lines 10 and 6), VAux, is fed to line 5 of PWM U1 via<br>
resistor R5. When the voltage at line 5 of PWM U1 goes below 1.5V, PWM U1<br>
resets the drive output at line 7 of PWM U1and MOSFET Q1 turns on. The<br>
switching power stage current is sensed by the parallel combination of resistors<br>
R7 and R9.<br>
The on-time ends when the boost inductor current reaches a determined peak<br>
value. The boost inductor current is sensed by resistors R7 and R9. The<br>
resultant sensed voltage is filtered by resistor R6 and capacitor C5 and fed to<br>
line 4 of PWM U1. The voltage at line 4 of PWM U1 is compared to a voltage<br>
reference established by the product combination of the voltage at lines 2 and 3<br>
of PWM U1. The power MOSFET Q1 turns off when the voltage at U1-4<br>
exceeds the voltage reference. The voltage at U1-3 is proportional to the input<br>
voltage VFL determined by the voltage divider made of resistors R2 and R3 thus<br>
allowing feedforward compensation for the input voltage variations. The voltage<br>
across the LEDs current sense resistor is fed to line 1 of PWM U1 and internally<br>
inverted. That feedback voltage is available at line 2 of PWM U1 where capacitor<br>
C4 is used to compensate the loop. The LEDs current being constant, the peak<br>
current of transitor T1 at lines 1 and 5 is directly proportional to the input voltage<br>
and the on-time remains constant.<br>
Capacitor C2 is a high frequency bypass capacitor used to filter the feedforward<br>
voltage at line 3 of PWM U1. Diode D10 clamps the voltage at -0.2V to prevent<br>
false triggering.<br>
The power stage provides the feature to select the LEDs current using a shunt<br>
with S1. The current selection is: 40mA, 60mA, 80mA, 100mA and 120mA.<br>
Current sense resistors R40, R41, R43-R47 are used to set the LEDs current at<br>
the predetermined value shown above. In normal operation, the voltage is<br>
regulated to 2.5V at line 1 of PWM U1 and the current value is obtained by<br>
dividing 2.5V by the current sense resistor. Resistor R42 and capacitor C8 is a<br>
low pass filter to attenuate the switching ripple across capacitor C7.<br><br>
Although the present disclosure describes particular types of transistors in the<br>
different circuits shown in the Figures, it should be kept in mind that these<br>
different types of transistors can be substituted or replaced by other available<br>
