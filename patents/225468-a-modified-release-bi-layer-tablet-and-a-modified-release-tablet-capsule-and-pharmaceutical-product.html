				<td>"A MODIFIED RELEASE BI-LAYER TABLET AND A MODIFIED RELEASE<br>
TABLET, CAPSULE AND PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT"<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a sustained release guaifenesin<br>
formulation for oral administration and methods of its manufacture. In particular, it<br>
relates to a sustained release guaifenesin formulation which maintains a<br>
therapeutically effective blood concentration of guaifenesin for a duration of at least<br>
twelve hours without an increase in dosage strength. The present invention further<br>
relates to a modified release bi-layer guaifenesin tablet which demonstrates a<br>
maximum serum concentration equivalent to an immediate release tablet yet<br>
maintains a therapeutically effective blood concentration of guaifenesin for a<br>
duration of at least twelve hours.<br>
2. Description of Related Art<br>
Sustained release pharmaceutical formulations provide a significant<br>
advantage over immediate release formulations to both clinicians and their patients.<br>
Sustained release dosage forms are administered to patients in much fewer daily<br>
doses than their immediate release counterparts and generally achieve improved.<br>
therapeutic effect and efficiency in the fewer daily doses.<br>
For example, a 400 mg immediate release dosage form of an active<br>
ingredient (hereinafter "drug" or "medicament") with a short half-life, such as<br>
guaifenesin, may have to be administered to a patient three times within 12 hours to<br>
maintain adequate bioavailability of the drug to achieve therapeutic effect. This<br>
results in a series- of three serum concentration profiles in the patient in which there<br>
is a rapid increase of drug followed by a similar rapid decrease. Such rapid<br>
increases and decreases provide a patient with a short window of appropriate blood<br>
concentration of the medicament for optimum therapy. A 1200 mg sustained release<br>
dosage form, on the other hand, may only have to be administered to a patient once<br>
every 12 hours to achieve therapeutic effect. Sustained release dosage forms<br>
generally control the rate of active drug absorption, so as to avoid excessive drug<br>
absorption while maintaining effective blood concentration of the drug to provide a<br>
patient with a consistent therapeutic effect over an extended duration of time.<br>
Besides reducing the frequency of dosing and providing a more<br>
consistent therapeutic effect, sustained release dosage forms generally help reduce<br>
side effects caused by a drug. Because sustained release dosage forms deliver the<br>
drug in slow, incremental amounts versus the cyclic high and low concentrations of<br>
immediate release formulations, it is easier for a patient's body to digest the drug,<br>
thereby avoiding undesirable side-effects. For patients who self-administer<br>
therapies, sustained release dosage forms generally result in greater compliance due<br>
to the lower frequency of dosing, lower quantity of dosage units to be consumed,<br>
and reduced undesired side-effects.<br>
Sustained release formulations for the sequential or timed release of<br>
medicaments are well known in the art. Generally, such formulations contain drug<br>
particles mixed with or covered by a polymer material, or blend of materials, which<br>
is resistant to degradation or disintegration in the stomach and/or in the intestine for<br>
a selected period of time. Release of the drug may occur by leeching, erosion,<br>
rupture, diffusion or similar actions depending upon the nature of the polymer<br>
material or polymer blend used.<br>
Conventionally, pharmaceutical manufacturers have used hydrophilic<br>
hydrocolloid gelling polymers such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose, or Pullulan to formulate sustained release tablets or<br>
capsules. These polymers first form a gel when exposed to an aqueous environment<br>
of low pH thereby slowly diffusing the active medicament which is contained within<br>
the polymer matrix. When the gel enters a higher pH environment such as that<br>
found in the intestines, however, it dissolves resulting in a less controlled drug<br>
release. To provide better sustained release properties in higher pH environments,<br>
some pharmaceutical manufacturers use polymers which dissolve only at higher<br>
pHs, such as acrylic resins, acrylic latex dispersions, cellulose acetate phthalate, and<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, either alone or in combination with<br>
hydrophilic polymers.<br>
Generally, these formulations are prepared by combining the<br>
medicament with a finely divided powder of the hydrophilic polymer, or the<br>
hydrophilic and water-insoluble polymers. These ingredients are mixed and<br>
granulated with water or an organic solvent and the granulation is dried. The dry<br>
granulation is then usually further blended with various pharmaceutical additives<br>
and compressed into tablets.<br>
Although these types of formulations have been successfully used to<br>
manufacture dosage forms which demonstrate sustained release properties, these<br>
formulations generally do not have the desired release profile or serum concentration<br>
of medicament over an extended period of time. These sustained release<br>
formulations generally result in a delay in the appearance of drug in the blood<br>
stream, thereby delaying therapeutic effect. Additionally, when the drug does<br>
appear, its maximum serum concentration (Cmax) is lower than the maximum<br>
concentration required for the most effective therapeutic result. Furthermore, most<br>
formulations which claim twelve hour potency release almost all of their drug within<br>
six to eight hours, making the formulation less therapeurically effective towards the<br>
end of the twelve hour period. To prevent blood serum concentrations of active drug<br>
from falling below a therapeutically effective level at extended time periods, many<br>
manufacturers increase the drug strength of the dosage form. The increase in drug<br>
strength, however, results in a concomitant increase in side-effects.<br>
To improve the release profile of certain sustained release dosage<br>
forms, some pharmaceutical manufacturers have made tablets and capsules which<br>
comprise a combination of an immediate release formulation and a sustained release<br>
formulation. Although this solution improves the Cmax and length of time before<br>
the drug appears in the blood stream in some formulations, the extended therapeutic<br>
effect is not improved.<br>
Furthermore, every medicament has different solubility properties<br>
and pH dependencies which affect its dissolution rate, and hence its bioavailability.<br>
Bioavailability can also be affected by a number of factors such as the amounts and<br>
types of adjuvants used, the granulation process, compression forces (in tablet<br>
manufacturing), surface area available for dissolution and environmental factors<br>
such as agitation in the stomach and the presence of food. Due to these numerous<br>
factors, specific formulations play an important role in the preparation of prolonged<br>
action solid dosage forms, particularly in the preparation of solid dosage forms<br>
which achieve appropriate bio availability for optimum therapeutic effect.<br>
Guaifenesin is known chemically as 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-l,2-<br>
propanediol. It is an expectorant, a drug which increases respiratory tract fluid<br>
secretions and helps to loosen phlegm and bronchial secretions. By reducing the<br>
viscosity of secretions, guaifenesin increases the efficiency of a cough reflex and of<br>
ciliary action in removing accumulated secretions from trachea and bronchi.<br>
Guaifenesin is readily absorbed from the intestinal tract and is rapidly metabolized<br>
and excreted in urine. Guaifenesin has a typical plasma half-life of approximately<br>
one hour. Because of the rapid metabolization and excretion of guaifenesin, typical<br>
immediate release dosage tablets of guaifenesin provide only a short window of<br>
therapeutic effectiveness for patients resulting in the various recognized problems<br>
described above.<br>
None of the prior art has described a sustained release dosage form of<br>
guaifenesin which is capable of sustaining therapeutic effective for at least twelve<br>
hours. Likewise, none of the prior art has described a sustained release dosage form<br>
cf guaifenesin which has a Cmax equivalent to that of an immediate release<br>
formulation, appears in the blood stream as quickly as an immediate release<br>
formulation, yet sustains therapeutic effect for at least twelve hours.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention overcomes the problems and disadvantage<br>
associated with current strategies and designs in formulation of modified release<br>
guaifenesin dosage forms.<br>
This invention relates to a novel sustained release pharmaceutical<br>
formulation comprising guaifenesin. The sustained release formulation may<br>
comprise a combination of at least one hydrophilic polymer and at least one water-<br>
insoluble polymer. The total weight ratio of hydrophilic polymer to water-insoluble<br>
polymer may be in a range of about one-to-one (1:1) to about six-to-one (6:1), more<br>
preferably a range of about three-to-two (3:2) to about four-to-one (4:1), and most<br>
preferably about two-to-one (2:1). When a tablet comprising the sustained release<br>
formulation is exposed to an aqueous medium of low pH, such as that found in the<br>
stomach, the polymer combination gels causing guaifenesin to diffuse from the gel.<br>
When the tablet passes to the intestines where an aqueous medium of higher pH is<br>
present, the gel begins to dissolve, thereby releasing guaifenesin in controlled<br>
amounts. The tablet is capable of releasing therapeutically effective amounts of<br>
guaifenesin over an extended period, i.e. twelve or more hours.<br>
This invention also relates to a modified release guaifenesin tablet<br>
which comprises two discrete portions ( a bi-layer tablet), a rapid release portion and<br>
a sustained release portion, each portion comprising a specific quantity of<br>
guaifenesin. The rapid release portion is formulated to dissolve in aqueous acidic<br>
medium, such as that found in the stomach, to quickly release guaifenesin contained<br>
within the portion. The sustained release portion may comprise a combination of<br>
hydrophilic polymer in a ratio range of about one-to-one (1:1) to about six-to-one<br>
(6:1), more preferably a range of about three-to-two (3:2) to about four-to-one (4:1),<br>
and most preferably about two-to-one (2:1, with a water-insoluble polymers as<br>
described above.<br>
The present invention also relates to modified release guaifenesin<br>
preparations of the type described above in the form of capsules having beads of<br>
both rapid release formulation and beads of sustained release formulation.<br>
The bi-layer tablet of the present invention demonstrates a maximum<br>
serum concentration (Cmax) and time of availability in the blood stream that are<br>
equivalent to an immediate release tablet. The bi-layer tablet also provides sustained<br>
release of guaifenesin over at least a twelve hour period from one dose. The bi-layer<br>
tablet of the present invention further maintains serum concentration levels of<br>
guaifenesin at a therapeutically effective level for at least a twelve hour period<br>
without an increase in the drug strength of the dosage form.<br>
The present invention also relates to methods of manufacturing<br>
sustained release formulations and bi-layer guaifenesin tablets of the present<br>
invention.. An example of a manufacturing method for a sustained release<br>
formulation comprises mixing a hydrophilic polymer and active ingredients in a<br>
mixer, adding water to the mixture and continuing to mix and chop, drying the<br>
mixture to obtain hydrophilic polymer encapsulated granules, milling and screening<br>
the resulting granulation, and blending it with various pharmaceutical additives,<br>
additional hydrophilic polymer, and water insoluble polymer. The formulation may<br>
then be tableted and may further be film coated with a protective coating which<br>
rapidly dissolves or disperses in gastric juices.<br>
An example of a bi-layer tablet manufacturing method comprises<br>
blending a quantity of guaifenesin with various excipients, colorants, and/or other<br>
pharmaceutical additives to form a rapid release formulation, blending another<br>
quantity of guaifenesin with a hydrophilic polymer, a water-insoluble polymer, and<br>
various excipients, colorants, and/or other pharmaceutical additives to form a<br>
sustained release formulation, and compressing a quantity of the rapid release<br>
formulation with a quantity of the sustained release formulation to form a bi-layer<br>
tablet. The tablet may then be optionally coated with a protective coating which<br>
rapidly dissolves or disperses in gastric juices.<br>
Other objects, advantages and embodiments of the invention are set<br>
forth in part in the description which follows, and in part, will be obvious from this<br>
description, or may be learned from the practice of the invention.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel modified release formulation<br>
comprising guaifenesin. In a preferred embodiment, a modified release formulation<br>
comprises a combination of a hydrophilic polymer in a ratio range of about one-to-<br>
one (1:1) to about six-to-one (6:1), more preferably a range of about three-to-two<br>
(3:2) to about four-to-one (4:1), and most preferably about two-to-one (2:1), with a<br>
water-insoluble polymer. The sustained release formulation may be compressed into<br>
a tablet. The present invention also relates to a novel compressed tablet which is<br>
made of two portions (a bi-layer tablet): a portion which comprises a modified<br>
release formulation of the present invention and a portion which is an immediate<br>
release formulation.<br>
a) Sustained Release Formulation<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a sustained release<br>
formulation comprises guaifenesin mixed with a polymer blend which consists of at<br>
least one hydrophilic polymer and at least one water-insoluble polymer. In a further<br>
embodiment, the sustained release formulation may comprise a combination of<br>
guaifenesin and at least one other drug including, but not limited to, an antitussive<br>
such as dextromethorphan hydrobromide, a decongestant such as phenylephrine<br>
hydrochloride, phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride<br>
or ephedrine, an antihistamine such as chlorpheniramine maleate, brompheniramine<br>
maleate, phenindamine tartrate, pyrilamine maleate, doxylamine succinate,<br>
phenyltoloxamine citrate, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, promethazine, and<br>
clemastine fumerate, or a combination thereof.<br>
Hydrophilic polymers suitable for use in the sustained release<br>
formulation include: one or more natural or partially or totally synthetic hydrophilic<br>
gums such as acacia, gum tragacanth, locust bean gum, guar gum, or karaya gum,<br>
modified cellulosic substances such as methylcellulose, hydroxomethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose; proteinaceous substances such as agar, pectin, carrageen,<br>
and alginates; and other hydrophilic polymers such as carboxypolymethylene,<br>
gelatin, casein, zein, bentonite, magnesium aluminum silicate, polysaccharides,<br>
modified starch derivatives, and other hydrophilic polymers known to those of skill<br>
in the art or a combination of such polymers.<br>
These hydrophilic polymers gel and dissolve slowly in aqueous<br>
acidic media thereby allowing the guaifenesin to diffuse from the gel in the stomach.<br>
When the gel reaches the intestines, it dissolves in controlled quantities in the higher<br>
pH medium, where the guaifenesin itself is fairly absorbable, to allow sustained<br>
release of guaifenesin throughout the digestive tract. Preferred hydrophilic polymers<br>
are the hydroxypropyl methylcelluloses such as those manufactured by The Dow<br>
Chemical Company and known as METHOCEL ethers. In one preferred<br>
embodiment of a sustained release formulation the hydrophilic polymer is a<br>
METHOCEL ether known as METHOCEL E10M.<br>
Water-insoluble polymers which are suitable for use in the sustained<br>
release formulation are polymers which generally do not dissolve in solutions of a<br>
pH below 5, and dissolve more slowly in basic solutions than the hydrophilic<br>
polymer. Because the polymer is insoluble in low pH environments such as those<br>
found in gastric fluid, it aids in retarding drug release in those regions. Likewise,<br>
because the polymer dissolves more slowly in solutions of higher pH than<br>
hydrophilic polymers, it aids in retarding drug release throughout the intestines.<br>
This overall delayed release results in a more uniform serum concentration of<br>
guaifenesin.<br>
The water-insoluble polymers suitable for use in this invention<br>
include: polyacrylic acids, acrylic resins, acrylic latex dispersions, cellulose acetate<br>
phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate and<br>
other polymers common to those of skill in the art. In a preferred embodiment, a<br>
sustained release formulation comprises the acrylic resin CARBOPOL 974P<br>
supplied by BF Goodrich.<br>
A sustained release formulation of the present invention may further<br>
comprise pharmaceutical additives including, but not limited to: lubricants such as<br>
magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, powdered stearic acid,<br>
hydrogenated vegetable oils, talc, polyethylene glycol, and mineral oil; colorants<br>
such as Emerald Green Lake and various FD&amp;C colors; binders such as sucrose,<br>
lactose, gelatin, starch paste, acacia, tragacanth, povidone polyethylene glycol,<br>
Pullulan and com syrup; glidants such as colloidal silicon dioxide and talc; surface<br>
active agents such as sodium lauryl sulfate, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate,<br>
triethanolamine, polyoxyethylene sorbitan, poloxalkol, and quarternary ammonium<br>
salts; preservatives and stabilizers; excipients such as lactose, mannitol, glucose,<br>
fructose, xylose, galactose, sucrose, maltose, xylitol, sorbitol, chloride, sulfate and<br>
phosphate salts of potassium, sodium, and magnesium; and/or any other<br>
pharmaceutical additives known to those of skill in the art. In one preferred<br>
embodiment, a sustained release formulation further comprises magnesium stearate<br>
and Emerald Green Lake. In another preferred embodiment, a sustained release<br>
formulation further comprises magnesium stearate and FD&amp;C Blue #1 Aluminum<br>
Lake Dye. <br>
A sustained release formulation of the present invention may<br>
comprise at least one drug ingredient, at least one hydrophilic polymer, at least one<br>
water-insoluble polymer, and at least one pharmaceutical additive in any appropriate<br>
percent quantity which permits dissolution of drug ingredients that results in a<br>
therapeutically effective serum concentration profile for a full twelve hours. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, a sustained release formulation comprises approximately<br>
95.5% guaifenesin, approximately 2.4% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose,<br>
approximately 1.2% acrylic resin, approximately 0.5% magnesium stearate, and<br>
approximately 0.3% colorant such as Emerald Green Lake or FD&amp;C Blue #1.,<br>
The present inventive sustained release formulation controls release<br>
of guaifenesin into the digestive tract slowly over time. The drug guaifenesin<br>
experiences a shift in water solubility as the pH of the environment in which it<br>
resides (i.e. stomach versus intestinal tract) changes. In a more acidic environment,<br>
such as that found in the stomach, guaifenesin is less soluble while in a higher pH<br>
environment, such as that found in the intestines, guaifenesin is readily soluble.<br>
Dissolution rate of guaifenesin throughout the digestive tract is thus of primary<br>
importance in determining concentrations of guaifenesin attained in the blood and<br>
tissues as a drug formulation is digested.<br>
To maintain a blood concentration of guaifenesin which provides<br>
good therapeutic effect, the release, or dissolution, of guaifenesin from a formulation<br>
matrix is preferably retarded and/or controlled through the intestines. The<br>
combination of hydrophilic and water-insoluble polymers of the sustained release<br>
formulation of the present invention gels when exposed to media of low pH. This<br>
creates a matrix out of which guaifenesin can diffuse. When the gelled polymer<br>
combination is exposed to media of a higher pH, the gel begins to slowly dissolve<br>
thereby releasing guaifenesin at a controlled rate.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a sustained<br>
release formulation comprises a hydrophilic polymer, preferably hydroxypropyl<br>
methylcellulose, in a ratio range of about one-to-one (1:1) to about six-to-one (6:1),<br>
more preferably a range of about three-to-two (3:2) to about four-to-one (4:1), and<br>
most preferably about two-to-one (2:1), with a water-insoluble polymer, preferably<br>
acrylic resin. Further in a preferred embodiment, a sustained release formulation<br>
comprises not more than 6% hydrophilic polymer. In another preferred<br>
embodiment, a sustained release formulation comprises not more than 2.5%<br>
hydrophilic polymer. The inventors have discovered that this combination results in<br>
a serum concentration profile of guaifenesin that provides an optimal therapeutic<br>
concentration for at least twelve hours.<br>
A sustained release formulation of the present invention may be<br>
manufactured according to any appropriate method known to those of skill in the art<br>
of pharmaceutical manufacture. In one embodiment, guaifenesin and a hydrophilic<br>
polymer may be mixed in a mixer with an aliquot of water to form a wet granulation.<br>
The granulation may be dried to obtain hydrophilic polymer encapsulated granules<br>
of guaifenesin. The resulting granulation may be milled, screened, then blended<br>
with various pharmaceutical additives, water insoluble polymer, and additional<br>
hydrophilic polymer. The formulation may then tableted and may further be film<br>
coated with a protective coating which rapidly dissolves or disperses in gastric<br>
juices.<br>
A preferred embodiment of a method of preparing a sustained release<br>
formulation of the present invention may comprise loading approximately 126 kg of<br>
GUAIFENESIN and about 2 kg of METHOCEL E10M into a high shear mixer.<br>
The METHOCEL E10M and GUAIFENESIN may be mixed for about seven<br>
minutes at a mixing speed of about 150 RPM and a chopper speed of about 2000<br>
RPM. The mixing and chopping speeds may then be increased to about 200 RPM<br>
and 3000 RPM respectively for about five minutes while about 49 kg of water are<br>
added to the mixer contents. The mixer may be run for two additional minutes to<br>
complete granulation. In a further preferred embodiment, the shut off for the mixer<br>
load is set to 21 kilowatts.<br>
The wet granulation may be emptied into a fluid bed bowl and placed<br>
into a fluid bed dryer set to a dryer air flow of 900 CFM and an inlet temperature of<br>
about 50 to about 55°C until the outlet temperature increases at a rate of 1° per<br>
minute. The air flow may then be decreased to 600 CFM, and the inlet temperature<br>
may be decreased to 43°C until the granulation is dried to a moisture content of no<br>
more than 0.5%. In another preferred embodiment, the outlet temperature is set to a<br>
cut-off of 48°C. In yet another preferred embodiment, an agitator in the fluid bed<br>
bowl may be run intermittently during drying. The dried granulation may be passed<br>
through a mill fitted with a suitable screen size so that not more than about 30% of<br>
the resulting granulation comes through a 100 mesh screen and not more than about<br>
10% of the resulting granulation is retained on a 10 mesh screen. In one preferred<br>
embodiment, the dried granulation may be passed through a mill fitted with a 0.109"<br>
size screen at a mill speed of about 500 to about 1500 RPM and a screw feed rate of<br>
about 35 to about 45 RPM. The resulting screened granulation is about 95%<br>
GUAIFENESIN and is called GUAIFENESIN DC (Direct Compressed) herein<br>
after. Screened granulation may be transferred to a 10 cubic foot V blender,<br>
combined with about another 0.6 kg of METHOCEL E10M, about 0.3 kg of a<br>
colorant such as EMERALD GREEN LAKE or FD&amp;C BLUE #1, about 0.7 kg of<br>
magnesium stearate, and about 1.3 kg of CARBOPOL 974P. The combination may<br>
be blended for about three minutes.<br>
The resulting formulation may further be compressed on a tablet<br>
compressor machine using tooling to form tablets. The tablets may be any<br>
appropriate weight, size, and shape depending on the desired dosage strength of<br>
tablet. In one embodiment, these tablets may further be loaded into a coating pan<br>
and film coated with OPADRY Y-S-3-714 (supplied by COLORCON, INC.) and air<br>
dried in the pan.<br>
Another embodiment of a method of preparing a sustained release<br>
formulation of the present invention may comprise blending the drug ingredients,<br>
hydrophilic polymer, water insoluble polymer, and any pharmaceutical additives.<br>
The resulting blend may then be compressed into tablets and, if desired, film coated<br>
with a protective coating which rapidly dissolves or disperses in gastric juices. In a<br>
preferred embodiment of such a method, about 126 kg of GUAIFENESIN DC<br>
(about 95% purity), about 2.6 kg of METHOCEL E10M, about 1.3 kg of<br>
CARBOPOL 974P and about 0.333 kg of a colorant such as EMERALD GREEN<br>
LAKE or FD&amp;C BLUE #1 may be loaded into a 10 cubic foot V BLENDER. The<br>
ingredients may be blended for about 20 minutes at which time about 0.6 kg of<br>
magnesium stearate may be added to the blended ingredients. This mixture may be<br>
blended for about another 10 minutes. The resulting formulation may further be<br>
compressed on a tablet compressor machine using tooling to form tablets. The<br>
tablets may be any appropriate weight, size, and shape depending on the desired<br>
dosage strength of the tablet. These tablets may further be loaded into a coating pan<br>
and film coated with OPADRY Y-S-3-714 (supplied by COLORCON, INC.) and air<br>
dried in the pan.<br>
Tablets comprising a sustained release formulation of the present<br>
invention were prepared and tested for both in vitro and in vivo release<br>
characteristics as described in Examples 1, 2, and 3 below. In the in vitro testing,<br>
the dissolution rates of these tablets were compared against modified release tablets<br>
formulated without acrylic resin (EXAMPLE 1), and three commercially available<br>
tablets, one being an immediate release formulation and the other two being<br>
modified release formulations. Tablets comprising the sustained release formulation<br>
of the present invention demonstrated a slower, more controlled release of<br>
guaifenesin over a twelve hour period than any of the other tablets (see EXAMPLE<br>
1 and 2, and Figures 4 and 5).<br>
In the in vivo testing, serum concentrations of subjects talcing tablets<br>
comprising the sustained release formulation of the present invention were<br>
compared with serum concentrations of subjects taking immediate release<br>
guaifenesin tablets and modified release guaifenesin tablets formulated without<br>
acrylic resin (see EXAMPLE 3 and Figure 6). Tablets comprising the sustained<br>
release formulation of the present invention demonstrated improved sustained<br>
release and therapeutic concentration at extended time periods that the other two<br>
formulations. However, in the subjects taking tablets comprising the sustained<br>
release formulation of the present invention, it took longer for guaifenesin to appear<br>
in the blood stream and the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of guaifenesin in<br>
these subject was less than half of that of the subjects taking the immediate release<br>
tablets.<br>
(b) Bi-Laver Tablets<br>
To improve the Cmax and speed of appearance of guaifenesin in<br>
patients while maintaining therapeutic effect for at least twelve hours, a portion of a<br>
sustained release formulation of the present invention as described above may be<br>
combined with a portion ot an immediate release formulation in a bi-layer tablet.<br>
The immediate release formulation may comprise guaifenesin and<br>
various pharmaceutical additives such as lubricants, colorants, binders, glidants,<br>
surface active agents, preservatives, stabilizers, as described above and/or any other<br>
pharmaceutical additives known to those of skill in the art. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, an immediate release formulation comprises guaifenesin,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, and magnesium stearate. In a<br>
further preferred embodiment, an immediate release formulation may comprise<br>
about 58% guaifenesin, about 33% microcrystalline cellulose, about 8% sodium<br>
starch glycolate, and about 0.3% magnesium stearate.<br>
The bi-layer tablet may be manufactured according to any method<br>
known to those of skill in the art. The resulting tablet may comprise the two<br>
portions compressed against one another so that the face of each portion is exposed<br>
as either the top or bottom of the tablet, or the resulting tablet may comprise the<br>
sustained release portion in the center coated by the immediate release portion so<br>
that only the immediate release portion is exposed. In a preferred embodiment, a bi-<br>
layer tablet of the present invention comprises the two portions compressed against<br>
one another so that the face of each portion is exposed.<br>
In a preferred method of manufacturing the bi-layer tablets of the<br>
present invention a sustained release formulation is prepared according to either a<br>
wet granulation or dry granulation method as described above. The immediate<br>
release formulation may be prepared by simply blending the guaifenesin with any<br>
pharmaceutical additives. In a further preferred embodiment, appropriate quantities<br>
of GUAIFENESIN DC, macrocrystalline cellulose, and sodium starch glycolate are<br>
blended in a 10 cubic foot blender for about twenty minutes. An appropriate<br>
quantity of magnesium stearate is then added to the ingredients and blended for<br>
about ten more minutes to make an immediate release formulation. Portions of the<br>
sustained release formulation and immediate release formulation are then<br>
compressed by a tablet compressor machine capable of forming bi-layer tablets. In<br>
one embodiment, these tablets may further be coated with a protective film which<br>
rapidly disintegrated or dissolves in gastric juices.<br>
The tablets may be made with any ratio of sustained release to<br>
modified release formulation which results in a blood profile demonstrating<br>
appropriate therapeutic effect over extended time periods. In one preferred<br>
embodiment, the bi-layer tablets comprise portions of sustained release formulation<br>
and immediate release formulation which result in about a five-to-one (5:1) ratio of<br>
guaifenesin respectively. For example, in a 1200 mg bi-layer modified release<br>
guaifenesin tablet of the present invention, there may be about 200 mg of<br>
guaifenesin in the immediate release layer and about 1000 mg of guaifenesin in the<br>
sustained release layer.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of manufacturing a 1200 mg bi-layer<br>
modified release guaifenesin tablet, about 105 kg of GUAIFENESIN DC, about 2.5<br>
kg of METHOCEL E10M, about 1.25 kg of CARBOPOL 974P, and about 0.333 kg<br>
of EMERALD GREEN LAKE or FD&amp;C BLUE #1 in a 10 cubic foot P.K. blender<br>
for about twenty minutes. About 0.6 kg of magnesium stearate may then be added<br>
and blending continued for about another ten minutes to prepare the sustained<br>
release formulation. Approximately 21 kg of GUAIFENESIN DC, approximately<br>
11.75 kg of microcrystalline cellulose, and approximately 3 kg of sodium starch<br>
glycolate may be blended in a 3 cubic foot P.K. blender for about twenty minutes.<br>
Approximately 0.1 kg of magnesium stearate may then be added and blending<br>
continued for about another ten minutes to prepare the immediate release<br>
formulation. The two formulations may then be compressed to make bi-layer tablets<br>
wherein about 75% of each tablet may be sustained release formulation and about<br>
25% if each tablet may be immediate release formulation. The tablets may be any<br>
dosage strength, size, or shape, hi a preferred embodiment, 1200 mg tablets are<br>
round and about 5/8 inch in diameter, about 0.28 inch - 0.31 inch in thickness, weigh<br>
about 1.46 grams and have a hardness range of about 15-40 SCU. In another<br>
preferred embodiment, 600 mg tablets are round and about 1/2 inch in diameter,<br>
about 0.218 inch - 0.230 inch in thickness, weigh about 0.729 grams and have a<br>
hardness range of about 12-30 SCU.<br>
The immediate release portion of the bi-layer tablet is formulated to<br>
dissolve in aqueous media of low pH, such as that found in the stomach, to quickly<br>
release the guaifenesin contained within the portion. This results in rapid<br>
bioavailability of a high concentration of guaifenesin. As demonstrated in<br>
EXAMPLE 6 and Figures 9 and 10 below, the immediate release portion of the bi-<br>
layer tablet results in a maximum serum concentration (Cmax) and time of<br>
maximum serum concentration (Tmax) equivalent to that of immediate release<br>
tablets.<br>
The sustained release portion gels when exposed to media of low pH<br>
allowing the sustained release portion of the tablet to be passed into the intestinal<br>
tract. In the intestines, the gelled sustained release portion is exposed to media of a<br>
higher pH, causing the gel to slowly dissolve, thereby allowing guaifenesin to<br>
diffuse and dissolve out of the gelled matrix. This results in controlled<br>
bioavailability over an extended time period (i.e. twelve or more hours) causing the<br>
tablet to provide extended therapeutic effect. This result is evidenced in EXAMPLE<br>
6 and Figures 9 and 10 below - the half-life of the modified release bi-layer tablet is<br>
increased to more than 3 hours and the tablet has an AUCinf (the area under a<br>
plasma concentration versus time curve from time 0 to infinity) of greater than 8000<br>
hr* mg/mL. As demonstrated in EXAMPLE 7 and Figure 11, the bi-layer tablets of<br>
the present invention had a further surprising result in that a 600 mg tablet had a<br>
Tmax equivalent to that of a 1200 mg and a Cmax and AUCinf approximately half<br>
of a 1200 mg tablet. Thus, without adjusting or changing the composition of the<br>
sustained release formulation or bi-layer tablet, a lower dosage strength guaifenesin<br>
tablet of the present invention exhibits plasma concentration profile that is<br>
approximately directly proportional to that of a higher dosage strength guaifenesin<br>
tablet also of the present invention. As further demonstrated in EXAMPLE 7 and<br>
Figure 11, the bi-layer tablets of the present invention had another surprising result<br>
in that the Cmax and AUCinf of a 1200 mg tablet administered to volunteers who<br>
had been fasting and the Cmax and AUCinf of a 1200 mg tablet administered to<br>
volunteers who had consumed a high fat meal were approximately equivalent. Thus,<br>
a bi-layer tablet of the present invention demonstrates a reduced food effect, being<br>
approximately equally effective when administered to a patient on an empty or full<br>
stomach.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A batch of sustained release guaifenesin tablets, Lot# 7LB-31FC,<br>
with the following composition was prepared:<br>
Another batch of sustained release guaifenesin tablets, Lor# 7LB-<br>
32FC, with the following composition was prepared :<br>
Six tablets from Lot /LB-31FC and six tablets bom Lot 7LB-32FC<br>
were tested for in vitro guaifenesin release using an Acid/Base dissolution (slightly<br>
modified USP 23/NF 18  Drug Release using Apparatus 2). Six dissolution<br>
vessels of a USP calibrated Hanson dissolution bath, equipped with shafts and<br>
paddles, were filled with 675 ml of 0.1N hydrochorlic acid at 37.0°C. The bath and<br>
vessels were maintained at a temperature of 37.0 ± 0.5°C throughout the 12 hr.<br>
dissolution test. The paddles were set to rotate at 50 RPM and slowly lowered into<br>
the vessels. One tablet of lot 7LB-31 was then dropped into each vessel.<br>
At the one hour and two hour intervals of testing, 5 mL samples of<br>
dissolution solution were withdrawn from each vessel and filtered through a 10<br>
micron polyethylene filter into glass IIPLC vials. Immediately after the two hour<br>
samples were withdrawn, 225 mL of 0.2M sodium phosphate tribasic was added to<br>
each vessel to increase the solution pH to about 6.8. The dissolution was run for ten<br>
more hours, 2.0 mL samples being withdrawn from each vessel at the 4 hr., 8 hr., 10<br>
hr., and 12 hr. intervals. The filtered samples from each sampling interval were then<br>
run on an HPLC to determine percent guaifenesin released from each tablet at each<br>
of the sampling intervals.<br>
The same dissolution testing procedure was performed for lot 7LB-32<br>
FC. The lots gave dissolution profiles shown below and depicted in Figure 4.<br>
Both formulations demonstrated sustained release of guaifenesin over<br>
a 12 hour period. Lot 7LB-32FC demonstrated identical release properties to Lot<br>
7LB-31FC in 0.1N HC1. In buffered solution, however, Lot 7LB-32FC, the lot<br>
comprising a 2:1 ratio of METHOCEL E10M to CARBOPOL 974P, demonstrated a<br>
statistically slower release than Lot 7LB-31FC, comprising METHOCEL E10M and<br>
no CARBOPOL 974P. A slower release rate in viti-o translates to a slower, more<br>
controlled release with longer drug action in vivo — a favorable characteristic for<br>
pharmaceutical products containing a high concentration of an active ingredient with<br>
a short half-life.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A dissolution study was run to compare dissolution profiles of lots<br>
7LB-32FC and 7LB-31FC with currently available guaifenesin dosage forms. One<br>
immediate release tablet, ORGANIDIN NR, and two sustained release tablets,<br>
HUMEBID L.A. and DURATUSS, were subjected to the same dissolution study as<br>
described for lots 7LB031FC and 7LB-32FC in Example 1 above. The following is<br>
a summary of the results which are also depicted in Figure 5.<br><br>
The immediate release ORGANIDIN released 100% of guaifenesin<br>
content within the first hour of dissolution. The two sustained release dosage forms<br>
which are currently available both demonstrated a slower release of guaifenesin.<br>
However, both the HUMIBID LA and DURATUSS released guaifenesin more<br>
rapidly than either Lot 7LB-31FC or 7LB-32FC. Both HUMIBID LA and<br>
DURATUSS would, therefore, exhibit a faster rate of release and thus a shorter lived<br>
therapeutic effect in vivo.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
The in vivo behavior of sustained release tablets of Lot 7LB-31FC<br>
and Lot 7LB-32 FC from Example 1 were compared to the in vivo behavior of an<br>
immediate release formulation (ORGANIDIN NR). The open-label study involved<br>
9 healthy volunteers averaging 38 ±11.01 years of age with a range of 23 years to<br>
55 years of age. The subjects weighed 175.56 ± 24,22 lbs. with a range of 143 to<br>
210 lbs. One subject was female and the remainder were male. Each subject<br>
received either one 1200 mg dose of one of the two above described sustained<br>
release tablets or 400 mg every four hours for 3 doses of the immediate release<br>
formulation.<br>
Blood samples (7 mL with sodium heparin as anticoagulant) were<br>
taken prior to dosing and at specific intervals up to 12 hours after dosing. All blood<br>
samples were chilled and centrifuged within 30 minutes of being drawn. The<br>
plasma was separated, transferred to a polypropylene tube, frozen at -20°C or below<br>
and stored frozen until being shipped for guaifenesin analysis.<br>
The plasma samples were analyzed by a fully validated HPLC<br>
method. The results are depicted in Figure 6. This resulting plasma concentration v.<br>
time data was subjected to pharmacokinetic analysis using non-compartmental<br>
analysis with Winnonlin 1.5. The results of the pharmacokinetic parameters analysis<br>
are below.<br>
Subjects given the 1200 mg formulation 7LB-32FC reached<br>
maximum plasma guaifenesin concentrations of 1016 g/mL in 1.25 hours and had<br>
an AUCinf of 7663 hr* g/mL. The subjects given formulation 7LB-31FC reached<br>
maximum plasma guaifenesin concentrations of 821 g/mL in 1.67 hours and had<br>
an AUCinf of 5453 hr* g/mL. The subjects given the immediate release<br>
formulation, ORGANIDIN NR, reached maximum plasma guaifenesin<br>
concentrations of 2263 g/mL in 1.75 hours (2 subjects peaked at 0.5 hours after the<br>
first dose and the third peaked at 0.25 hours after the second dose at 4 hours) and<br>
had an AUCinf of 7752 hr* g/mL. The two controlled release formulations<br>
demonstrated sustained release in that their half-lives were longer, 5.77 hours for the<br>
7LB-32FC and 3.59 hours for the 7LB-31 FC compared to 0.8 hours for the<br>
immediate release formulation, ORGANIDIN NR.<br>
Both formulations 7LB-32FC (with both METHOCEL E10M and<br>
CARBOPOL 974P) and 7LB-31FC (with METHOCEL E10M only) control the<br>
release of guaifenesin from the tablet compared to the immediate release<br>
ORGANIDIN NR. Formulation 7LB-32FC, the formulation containing a 6:1 ratio<br>
of METHOCEL E10M to CARBOPOL 974P, had the longest half life at 5.77 hours<br>
with the largest AUCinf between the two sustained release formulation. However,<br>
both sustained release formulation has a Cmax that was less than half of the Cmax of<br>
the immediate release ORGANIDIN NR.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Three different modified release tablet lots were prepared with the<br>
following compositions:<br>
Modified Release Formulation I, non-layered tablet<br>
The in vivo behavior of each of the three modified release tablets and<br>
an immediate release formulation (ORGANIDIN NR) were compared. The open-<br>
label study involved 15 healthy volunteers averaging 31.67 ± 11.89 years of age<br>
with a range of 20 years to 51 years of age. The subjects weighed 162.00 ± 25.05<br>
lbs. with a range of 123 to 212 lbs. All 15 subjects were administered 400 mg of the<br>
immediate release formulation every 4 hours for a total of 12 hours in on one day.<br>
On another day, 5 subjects were administered Modified Formulation I, another 5<br>
subjects were administered Modified Formulation n, and yet another 5 subjects were<br>
administered Modified Formulation IE.<br>
Blood samples (7 mL with sodium heparin as anticoagulant) were<br>
taken prior to dosing and at specific intervals up to 12 hours after dosing. All blood<br>
samples were chilled and centrifuged within 30 minutes of being drawn. The<br>
plasma was separated, transferred to a polypropylene tube, frozen at -20°C or below<br>
and stored frozen until being shipped for guaifenesin analysis.<br>
The plasma samples were analyzed by a fully validated HPLC<br>
method. The results are depicted in Figure 7. This resulting plasma concentration v.<br>
time data was subjected to pharmacokinetic analysis using non-compartmental<br>
analysis with Winnonlin 1.5. The results of the pharmacokinetic parameters analysis<br>
are below.<br>
Modified Formulations II and III exhibited a Cmax more comparable<br>
to the immediate release formulation and an increased AUCinf from that of the non-<br>
layered Modified Formulation I. However, the half-lives of both Modified<br>
Formulation II and III were reduced from the half-life of Modified Formulation I.<br>
Although these bi-layer tablets showed an improved serum concentration of<br>
guaifenesin and an increased overall concentration with time, their half-life was<br>
compromised.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
A dissolution study was run to compare dissolution profiles of<br>
Formulation I, Formulation II and Formulation HI prepared as defined in<br>
EXAMPLE 4 above, and Formulation IV, a bi-layer lable lot with 200 mg IR and<br>
1000 mg SR prepared with the following composition:<br>
Formulation I, the non bi-layered tablet, demonstrated the slowest<br>
release of GUATFENESIN. Formulation II and Formulation III had the fastest rates<br>
of release and would, therefore, exhibit a faster rate of release and thus a shorter<br>
lived therapeutic effect in vivo. Formulation IV has a rate of release which was<br>
faster than Formulation I, comprising no immediate release blend, but slower than<br>
Formulation II and Formulation III, both comprising more immediate release blend<br>
than Formulation IV.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
The in vivo behavior of Formulation IV bi-layered tablets, prepared<br>
as described above in EXAMPLE 5, was compared to an immediate release<br>
formulation (ORGANIDIN NR). The open-label, multiple dose, randomized, 2-way<br>
crossover study involved 26 healthy volunteers averaging 31.31 ±9.81 years of age<br>
with a range of 19 years to 50 years of age. The subjects weighed 166.77 ±29.83<br>
lbs. The subjects were placed into one of two treatment groups. Group 1 received<br>
Formulation IV tablet with 240 mL of water after an overnight fast every 12 hours<br>
for 5 days and a single dose on day 6 Group 2 received 400 mg of ORGANIDIN<br>
NR (2 x 200 mg tablets) with 240 mL of water every 4 hours for 5 days and one 400<br>
mg dose every four hours for a total of 3 doses on day 6.<br>
Blood samples (5 mL with sodium heparin as anticoagulant) were<br>
taken prior to dosing on days 1, 4, 5, and 6. On Day 1, additional blood samples (5<br>
mL with sodium heparin as anticoagulant) were also obtained at 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2,<br>
3, 4, 4.5, 4.75, 5, 5.5, 6, 7, 8, 8.5, 8.75, 9, 9.5, 10. 11, and 12 hours after the initial<br>
dose. On Day 6, additional blood samples (5 mL with sodium heparin as<br>
anticoagulant) were also obtained at 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 4.5, 4.75, 5, 5.5, 6, 7, 8,<br>
8.5, 8.75, 9, 9.5, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, and 24 hours after the initial dose. Plasma was<br>
separated and the plasma frozen until analyzed for guaifenesin content. The<br>
resulting plasma concentration data was subjected to pharmacokinetic and statistical<br>
analysis in order to determine if the sustained release tablets performed as controlled<br>
release tablets at steady state.<br>
The results of the pharmacokinetic parameters analysis are below.<br>
Averaged Testing - 11 Twelve-Hour Intervals<br><br>
The results of the testing are depicted in Figure 9.<br>
The results of the testing are depicted in Figure 10.<br>
The 200/1000 mg bi-layered tablet exhibited a Cmax and a AUCinf<br>
equivalent to that of the immediate release blend, a short Tmax and an extended<br>
half-life. Thus, a bi-layered tablet with 200 mg guaifenesin in the immediate release<br>
formulation and 1000 mg of guaifenesin in the sustained release formulation results<br>
in a tablet which delivers a high serum concentration in a short period of time, yet<br>
maintains an effective concentration of guaifenesin in the blood stream for a full<br>
twelve hours.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
A study was performed to examine the relative bioavailability of two<br>
different dosage strengths of modified release guaifenesin formulations of the<br>
present invention as well as the effect of food on the relative bioavailability of a<br>
guaifenesin formulation of the present invention in normal, healthy male and/or<br>
female volunteers. Two batches of guaifenesin bi-layer tablets, one 600 mg and one<br>
1200 mg, were prepared according to the following composition.<br>
600 mg Tablet<br>
IR Formulation<br><br>
Note: the 600 mg and 1200 mg tablets were similarly prepared, the<br>
only difference between the dosage forms being that the 1200 mg tablet contained<br>
about twice as much of each ingredient as the 600 mg tablet.<br>
The in vivo behaviors of a 600 mg tablet administered to volunteers<br>
in the fasting state (about 10 hours pre-dose until about 4 hours after dosing), the<br>
1200 mg tablet administered to volunteers in the fasting state (about 10 hours pre-<br>
dose until about 4 hours after dosing), and the 1200 mg tablet administered to<br>
volunteers after a high fat meal (consumed within 30 minutes of dosing) were<br>
compared. The open-label study involved 27 healthy volunteers between the ages of<br>
18 and 55. The subjects weighed within 15% of their Ideal Body Weight as defined<br>
by the 1983 Metropolitan Life chart. The 27 volunteers were divided into 3<br>
treatment groups, 9 receiving the 600 mg tablet, 9 receiving the 1200 mg tablet<br>
while fasting, and 9 receiving a 1200 mg tablet after consuming a high fat meal for<br>
Period 1 of the trial. After completion of Period 1, the volunteers were crossed-over<br>
for Period 2 (e.g. so that the 9 volunteers who had been receiving the 600 mg tablet<br>
in Period 1 received the 1200 mg tablet while fasting in Period 2). After completion<br>
of Period 2, the volunteers were crossed-over again into their 3rd and final treatment<br>
group (i.e. the 9 volunteers who received the 1200 mg tablet while fasting in Period<br>
2 and the 600 mg tablet while fasting in Period 1 received the 1200 mg tablet after<br>
consumption of a high fat meal in Period 3). Each volunteer was administered one<br>
dose of the appropriate tablet and then monitored over a 16 hour period.<br>
Blood samples (7 mL with sodium heparin as anticoagulant) were<br>
taken about one hour prior to dosing and at specific intervals up to 16 hours after<br>
dosing (at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 hours). All blood<br>
samples were chilled and centrifuged within 30 minutes of being drawn. The<br>
plasma was separated, transferred to a polypropylene tube, frozen at -20°C or below<br>
and stored frozen until being shipped for guaifenesin analysis. The volunteers were<br>
then given at least a seven day washout period (where no guaifenesin was<br>
administered to them under the study) prior to being crossed-over to the next<br>
treatment group.<br>
The plasma samples were analyzed by a fully validated HPLC<br>
method. The results are depicted in Figure 11. This resulting plasma concentration<br>
v. time data was subjected to pharmacokinetic analysis using non-compartmental<br>
analysis with Winnonlin 1.5. The results of the pharmacokinetic parameters analysis<br>
are below.<br><br>
The 600 mg tablet demonstrated a serum profile approximately<br>
directly proportional to the serum profile of the 1200 mg tablet. The Cmax of the<br>
600 mg tablet was about 55% that of the 1200 mg tablet. The AUC0-12 of the 600<br>
mg tablet was about 48% that of the 1200 mg tablet and the AUCinf of the 600 mg<br>
tablet was about 46% that of the 1200 mg. improved serum concentration of<br>
guaifenesin and an increased overall concentration with time, their half-life was<br>
compromised.<br>
The 1200 mg tablet demonstrated that the bi-layer tablets of this<br>
invention greatly reduce the food effect in bioavailability and serum concentration of<br>
guaifenesin. The Cmax of the 1200 mg tablet administered after a high fat meal (fed<br>
tablet) was about 102% of the Cmax of the 1200 mg tablet administered after fasting<br>
(fasted tablet). The AUC0-12 of the 1200 mg fed tablet was about 99% that of the<br>
fasted tablet and the AUCing of the 1200 mg fed tablet was about 94% that of the<br>
fasted tablet.<br>
