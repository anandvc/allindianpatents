				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention is directed to a toothbrush, either manual or powered, which includes a handle and a head.  Cleaning elements are mounted to the head such as tufts of bristles.  When toothpaste is applied to the cleaning elements the user inserts the head into the mouth and brushes the teeth in a known manner.  Also included in this invention are prophylaxis polishing cups or arrays of bristles forming cups in the center of the head to hold toothpaste.  These cups are closely surrounded by  cleaning elements which help to retain the toothpaste within the head. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The head of a conventional toothbrush usually has a flat or slightly altered surface to which cleaning elements are attached.   Usually the cleaning elements are strands of plastic material(s) formed into tufts, bundles or other groupings. The strands are attached to the head either before or after forming the toothbrush.<br>
Various approaches have been advanced in the prior art for orientating the cleaning elements in the toothbrush.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 2,083,217 issued June 8, 1937 to E. I. Brothers, et al. discloses two or three circular brush sections which are arranged within cups 5 and 5' that may be screwed into mating receptacles in the tooth brush handle so that they can be removed and replaced as needed (page 2, lines 52-70).   Each brush section contains stiff cleaning<br>
elements and is spaced from the other along the longitudinal axis of the handle at a distance less than the thickness of a tooth so that the brush operates on both the lingual (inside) and facial (outside) surfaces of the teeth (page 2, column 1, line 71 to column 2, line 9).<br>
U.S. Patent NO. 5,604,951 describes a toothbrush with a head containing a flexible, rubber-like prophylaxis polishing cup or "prophy cup" similar to that used by dental personnel to professionally clean teeth.  This prophy cup is loaded with toothpaste by the user and applied to the teeth. According to this patent, the "soft rubber-like prophy cup device follows the contours of teeth more effectively than bristles" (column 2, lines 23-26).  This patent also discloses a ring of cleaning elements ("bristle tufts") placed about the periphery of the toothbrush head which coact with the prophy cups to clean the user's teeth and gums (column 2, lines 34-47) .<br>
Another approach to oral hygiene is described in the toothbrush described in U.S. Patent No. 6,041,468 issued to the assignee of this application. The cleaning elements (bristles) of this toothbrush are arranged in a concave shape across the width of the toothbrush head (See Figs. 3-5 and column 4, lines 1-22).<br>
Design Patents illustrating circular groups of cleaning elements are U.S. Patent Nos. Des. 273,635 issued May 1, 1984 to Stocchi and D450,929S issued November 27, 2001 to Angelina, et al.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention seeks to improve the tooth buffing/polishing capability of a toothbrush by inter alia providing a configuration that promotes retention of toothpaste in place within a toothbrush head while in use. This goal is achieved by mounting elastomeric prophy cups on a toothbrush head, which cups are closely surrounded by cleaning elements extending above the surface of the cups.<br>
Unlike a professional dentist's office where the dental professional can repeatedly add toothpaste to a prophy cup, a typical domestic toothbrush user applies but one portion of toothpaste to a toothbrush.  A substantial portion of the applied toothpaste, and thus its cleaning power, is typically lost after the first few movements of the toothbrush in the user's mouth.  It either falls off as the top of the toothbrush head is tilted from horizontal to vertical as it approaches the mouth or is squeezed off as the toothbrush is pressed against the teeth.  The toothpaste is of no cleaning value once it leaves contact with the brush and teeth.<br>
Accordingly, this invention provides a unique combination of features to maintain and retain toothpaste on the head of a toothbrush. Prophy cup(s) are arranged in the center of the toothbrush head, preferably on the longitudinal axis of the head. Alternatively, the cups could be in the form of an array of bristles. These cups are closely surrounded by groupings of cleaning elements that have a greater height relative to the face of the toothbrush head<br>
than the height of the prophy cup from that face. This grouping of taller cleaning elements at least partially surrounds the prophy cup to form a barrier around the prophy cup that retains toothpaste when the toothbrush is in use.<br>
An additional set of cleaning elements can then be arranged about the periphery of the toothbrush head to clean the teeth with the toothpaste retained by the prophy cup and surrounding cleaning elements. The outer set of cleaning elements also promotes massaging of the gum and removal of plaque at the gum line.<br>
The cleaning elements are typically bristles secured to the toothbrush head by anchor free tufting (AFT) technology.<br>
The invention may be practiced where each set of cup and surrounding cleaning elements is mounted on a disk and the disk is power driven to rotate continuously in the same direction or back and forth in an oscillating movement. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
This invention is capable of use in a broad array of oral hygiene products. The drawings illustrate one use of the invention and are not to be construed as the only embodiment of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a manual toothbrush 10 containing the features of this invention. This toothbrush 10 includes a handle 12 and a head 14. Handle 12 may include a suitable textured grip (not shown) made of elastomeric material. This invention, however, is primarily directed to the arrangement of prophy cups and cleaning elements on the head 14. In accordance with this invention, prophy cups 16 are arrayed in the center of head 14, preferable aligned with the longitudinal axis of toothbrush 10. As illustrated, three prophy cups 16 are affixed to head 14, although use of a larger or smaller number of such cups is contemplated for use with toothbrush 10. The prophy cups 16<br>
are typically made of a soft elastomeric material and, as the name implies, are cup-shaped. The inner surface of the cup can contain ridges which help to clean teeth when the toothbrush is pressed against the user's teeth. More importantly, the cup shape of prophy cups 16 acts to hold toothpaste in place while the toothbrush 10 is in use.<br>
Complementing this function of toothpaste retention is a set of cleaning elements or bristle rings 18 surrounding some or all of the prophy cups 16. As best illustrated in Figure 2, the bristle rings 18 extend a greater distance above the face 20 of head 14 than the prophy cups 16. This extra height relative to cups 16 acts as a further means for retaining toothpaste within the toothbrush head 14 during use. A preferred placement of the bristle rings 18 is with a space of about one (1) millimeter from the outer circumference of the prophy cup 16.<br>
Upon the user's application of force on the handle 14 as the toothbrush 10 approaches the user's teeth, the toothpaste applied by the user will be forced into the holding areas 22 formed by between a prophy cup 16 and the surrounding bristle ring 18. The toothpaste will be held in holding areas 22 near the top of the bristle rings by the top of prophy cup 16.<br>
This unique combination of prophy cups 16 and closely surrounding bristle rings 18 holds most of the toothpaste exactly where desired, namely, in the area 22 where the principal cleansing components, prophy cup and bristle rings, are in contact with the user's teeth.  The<br>
surrounding ring of bristles 18 captures the toothpaste as it escapes from the cup 16, to act as a replenishing reservoir when one changes the direction of one's brush stroke.<br>
To complement the cleaning effect of the prophy cups 16 and bristle rings 18, additional elements 24 can be arranged about the periphery of head 14 in a manner similar to that shown in Figures 1 and 2. These peripheral cleaning elements 24 help to clean deep between teeth and along the gumline. These additional cleaning elements may be tufts of bristles and may be elastomeric walls or fingers, as illustrated.<br>
Cleaning elements 24 and bristle rings 18 are arranged in both portions of head 14 in a known manner.  For example, anchor free tufting (AFT) could be used to mount the cleaning elements.  In AFT a plate or membrane is secured to the brush head such as by ultrasonic welding.  The bristles extend through the plate or membrane.   The free ends of the bristles on one side of the plate or membrane perform the cleaning function.  The ends of the bristles on the other side of the plate or membrane are melted together by heat to be anchored in place.   Any suitable form of cleaning elements may be used in the broad practice of this invention.  The term "cleaning elements" is intended to be used in a generic sense which could include conventional fiber bristles or massage elements or other forms of cleaning elements such as elastomeric fingers or walls arranged in a circular cross-section shape or any  type of desired shape including straight portions or sinusoidal portions.  Where<br>
bristles are used, the bristles could be mounted to tuft blocks or sections by extending through suitable openings in the tuft blocks so that the base of the bristles is mounted within or below the tuft block.<br>
It is to be understood that the specific illustration of the cleaning elements is merely for exemplary purposes.  The invention can be practiced with various combinations (such as AFT, etc.) and/or with the same bristle or cleaning element materials (such as nylon bristles, spiral bristles, rubber bristles, etc.)  Similarly, while the Figures illustrate the cleaning elements to be generally perpendicular to head 14, some or all of the cleaning elements may be angled at various angles with respect to the face 20 of head 14.  It is thereby possible to select the combination of cleaning element configurations, materials and orientations to achieve specific intended results to deliver additional oral health benefits, like enhanced cleaning, tooth polishing,  tooth whitening and/or massaging of the gums.<br>
Although the bristle ring 18 is illustrated as being formed by fibrous bristles, the bristle ring could be formed by other types of cleaning elements such as elastomer fingers.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a powered version 10A of 2 5  the toothbrush wherein sections 40 of the head 14 are moved under power or may contain a powered set of cleaning elements.   Sections 40 may take the form of circular discs.  Preferably, the prophy cups 16 and/or bris-<br>
tle rings 18 would be mounted to the section 40 to be powered to provide rotational or oscillating movement thereto. Switch 26 on toothbrush 10A can be used to activate and deactivate power to the movable elements of toothbrush 10A.<br>
The movable section 40 could be oscillated ro-tationally such as by using the type of drive mechanism shown in U.S. Patent No. 5,625,916, or could move in and out using the type of drive mechanism shown in U.S. Patent No. RE 35,941; all of the details of both patents are incorporated herein by reference thereto. Alternatively, the other types of drives referred to above could move section 40 in other manners and directions. Although Figure 3 shows movable section 40 to be at one end of the head 14, the movable section(s) would be located at any desired location on the head.<br>
Figures 1-3 relate to the practice of the invention wherein the cleaning elements 18 surround prophy cups 16. The invention could, however, be practiced where instead of prophy cups the cups are formed by a dense pack of cleaning elements. This embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Figures 4-6. As shown therein the toothbrush 110 has many of the same features as the toothbrush 10. Thus, the toothbrush 110 includes a handle 112 and a head 114 similar to the same components in Figures 1-3.<br>
In accordance with the practice of the invention shown in Figure 4-6, a central,  dense pack of<br>
cleaning elements 116 is arrayed in the center of head 114, preferable aligned with the longitudinal axis of toothbrush 110. As illustrated, three circular groups of densely packed cleaning elements 116 are affixed to head 114, although use of a larger or smaller number of such groups is contemplated for use with toothbrush 110. The ends of cleaning element groups 116 are typically contoured in cross-section to provide a cup-like shape. The cup-like shape of cleaning elements 116 acts to hold toothpaste in place while the toothbrush 110 is in use.<br>
Complementing this function of toothpaste retention is a set of cleaning elements or bristle rings 118 surrounding some or all of the cup-shaped cleaning elements 116. As best illustrated in Figure 5, the bristle rings 118 extend a greater distance above the face 120 of head 114 than the cup-shaped elements 116. This extra height relative to cup-shaped cleaning elements 116 acts as a further means for retaining toothpaste within the toothbrush head 114 during use. A preferred placement of the bristle rings 118 is v/ith a space of about one (1) millimeter from the outer circumference of the cup-shaped elements 116.<br>
Upon the user's application of force on the handle 114 as the toothbrush 110 approaches the user's teeth, the toothpaste applied by the user will be forced into the holding areas 122 formed by the surrounding bristle rings 118.  The toothpaste will be held in holding areas<br>
122 near the top of the bristle rings by the top of cup-shaped elements 116.<br>
This unique combination of elements 116 and closely surrounding bristle rings 118 holds most of the toothpaste exactly where desired, namely, in the area 122 adjacent where the principal cleansing components, which are in contact with the user's teeth. The surrounding ring of bristles 118 captures the toothpaste as it escapes from the cup-shaped bristles 116, to act as a replenishing reservoir when one changes the direction of one's brush stroke.<br>
To complement the cleaning effect of the cup-shaped elements 116 and bristle rings 118, additional elements 124 can be arranged about the periphery of head 114 in a manner similar to that shown in Figures 4 and 5. These peripheral cleaning elements 124 help to clean deep between teeth and along the gumline.<br>
As with toothbrush 10 of Figures 1-2, cleaning elements 116, 118, and 124 are arranged in head 114 in a known manner. Any suitable form of cleaning elements may be used in the broad practice of this invention.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates a powered version 110A of the toothbrush wherein portions 140 of the head 114 are moved under power or may contain a powered set of cleaning elements. Preferably, the cup-shaped cleaning elements 116 and/or bristle rings 118 would be powered to provide rotational or oscillating movement thereto. A switch 126 on toothbrush 110A can be used to activate<br>
and deactivate power to the movable elements of toothbrush 11OA. Toothbrush 110A could operate in the same manner as toothbrush 110A.<br>
The toothbrushes 10A and 110A utilize a power drive to move the respective sections 40, 140. Figures 7-8 illustrate in greater detail one such practice of the invention. As shown in Figure 7, a powered toothbrush 210 includes a handle 212 and a head 214. Handle 212 includes a battery pack or rechargeable unit 216 which provides the motive power to toothbrush 210. This power source 216 is electrically connected to motor 218 by suitable wiring or after connection. Selective operation of motor 218 is controlled by switch 220.<br>
Extending from one end of motor 218 toward head 214 is drive shaft 222. Motor 218 can be geared to impart rotational or reciprocating motion to drive shaft 222. The other end underlies the discs or movable platforms 224 on which are mounted cups 226 and taller cleaning elements 228.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in Figures 7 and 8, the drive shaft rotates back and forth through an angle of about 60-90° as illustrated in Figure 8.  Offsets<br>
223	in drive shaft 222 rotate a similar angular distance. These offsets 223 in drive shaft 222 are positioned in slots 225 formed in the base of platforms 224. As the shaft rotates back and forth through the aforesaid, angle, offsets 223 cause reciprocation of platforms<br>
224	as the offsets alternatively push the sides of slots<br>
225 in one direction and then another.  This, in turn, causes reciprocating movement of  cups 226 or bristles 228, depending upon which is mounted on platform 224. That movement aids in cleaning of teeth and invigoration of gums.<br>
In accordance with this invention,  cups 226 are mounted on platforms 224 in the center of head 214, preferably aligned with   the longitudinal  axis of toothbrush 210.  As illustrated, three cups 226 are contained in head 214, although use of a larger or smaller number of  such cups  is contemplated  for use with toothbrush 210.   Where cups 226 are prophy cups, the prophy cups 226 are typically made of a soft elastomeric material and, as the name implies, are cup-shaped.  The inner surface of the cup can contain ridges which help to clean teeth when the toothbrush is pressed against the user's teeth.  Also, the cup shape of prophy cups 226 acts to hold toothpaste in place while the powered toothbrush 10 is in use.<br>
Although prophy cups are specifically illustrated, cups 226 could also be densely packed cleaning elements, such as cups 116.<br>
Complementing these functions of toothpaste retention and cleaning is a set of cleaning elements or bristle rings 228 surrounding some or all of the cups 22 6, as previously described with respect to toothbrushes 10 and 110.<br>
It is to be understood that various features shown in an individual embodiment may be incorporated in other  embodiments.    Thus,  for  example,  where  a toothbrush utilizes a plurality of cups all of the cups may be prophy cups or all of the cups may be cups formed by densely packed cleaning elements.  Alternatively, a combination of the two different types of cups may be used in any suitable arrangement.   Thus, where three cups are used the end cups may be of one type which differs from the central cup or only one of the end cups may differ from the other cups.  Where more than three cups are used the cups are preferably longitudinally aligned and could be all or a combination of the different types of cups.  Alternatively, where the plurality of cups are used if a wider toothbrush head is used the cups need not be longitudinally aligned.   Although the sets of cups and bristle rings are illustrated as being uniformly spaced from each other, a non-uniform spacing could be used.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
