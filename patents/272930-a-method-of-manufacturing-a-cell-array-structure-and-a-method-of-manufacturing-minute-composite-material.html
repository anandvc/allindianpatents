DESCRIPTION<br>
MINIATURE CELL ARRAY STRUCTURE AND MANUFACTURING<br>
METHOD OF MINIATURIZED COMPOSITE. COMPONENT USING SUCH<br>
A MINIATURE CELL ARRAY STRUCTURE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention generally relates to<br>
molding technology of plastic components and more<br>
particularly to the high-precision molding technology<br>
of highly miniaturized plastic composites formed of<br>
plural parts. The technology of the present invention<br>
is applicable to the production of miniature plastic<br>
lens arrays for use in optical scanning system of<br>
copying machines, facsimile machines, solid-state<br>
scanning type printers, and the like, or optical<br>
waveguides having built-in miniature lens array<br>
designed for optical transmission, production of<br>
lenses of digital cameras, production of optical<br>
fiber array used for projector screens, touch panels,<br>
photosensitive bodies for electron photography<br>
process, display devices, and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Conventionally, there is a technology of<br>
forming high-precision plastic products formed of<br>
plural miniaturized components by way of molding.<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
More specifically, there is a technology of forming:<br>
(1) miniature lens arrays; and (2) minute optical<br>
fiber arrays.<br>
(1) Conventional Technology related to Miniature<br>
Lens Arrays<br>
For the conventional technology related to<br>
miniature lens arrays or microlens arrays, Japanese<br>
Laid-Open Patent Application 1-107202 (Patent<br>
Reference 1), Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application<br>
2004-341474 (Patent Reference 2); Japanese Laid-Open<br>
Patent Application 2004-45586 (Patent Reference 3)<br>
are cited.<br>
More specifically, Patent Reference 1<br>
discloses a manufacturing method of a lens array<br>
according to the steps of: arraying GRIN (graded<br>
index) cylindrical lenses in a mold such that the<br>
optical axes thereof are aligned in a predetermined<br>
direction; and injecting a molten resin into the mold<br>
to form a molding in which the lens array and the<br>
resin are integrated.<br>
Further, Patent Reference 2 describes the<br>
method for producing an optical component by an<br>
extrusion molding-process. More specifically, the<br>
technology of Patent Reference 2 aims for a<br>
production method of an optical component<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
characterized by long lifetime of the mold,<br>
capability of forming the lenses without distortion<br>
or optical defects and capability of integrating the<br>
lenses easily into a main apparatus with high<br>
precision.<br>
Thus, a lens holding member is placed on a<br>
lower mold in such a manner that the lens holding<br>
member is formed with a large number of lens holes,<br>
and lenses are placed on the respective lens holes of<br>
the lens holding member. Thereby, the lower mold and<br>
the upper mold are formed respectively with a lower<br>
lens mold surface and an upper lens mold surface with<br>
the diameter smaller than the diameter of the lens<br>
holes, and lenses are formed by pressing the lower<br>
mold and the upper mold with each other. By using<br>
different materials for the lens and the lens holding<br>
member, it becomes possible to suppress optical noise<br>
of the lens. Particularly, by using a metal for the<br>
lens holding member, it becomes possible to mount the<br>
lens array to a main apparatus easily by way of<br>
soldering.<br>
Further, Patent Reference 4 provides the<br>
method of manufacturing a high-precision composite -<br>
molding having a thin optical shielding part. The<br>
reference eliminates the problem of misalignment<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
between a molded product and a molding apparatus<br>
applying a secondary molding process to the molded<br>
product and enables manufacturing of a composite by<br>
molding process with high precision in terms of<br>
dimensions and pattern transfer precision. With this<br>
prior art, reference positions are defined<br>
respectively to the molded product produced by the<br>
first molding process and to the mold used for the<br>
secondary molding process for mutual alignment at the<br>
time of initial setup of the secondary molding<br>
process. Further, adjustment of dimensions is<br>
achieved by way of expanding or shrinking the primary<br>
molding or the mold or by way of mechanical<br>
dimensional adjustment. Further, the start timing of<br>
holding the primary molding in the secondary molding<br>
apparatus is controlled by detecting the mutual<br>
positional relationship therebetween or by evaluating<br>
the mutual positional relationship based on the<br>
linear thermal expansion coefficients by detecting<br>
the temperature. Alternatively, the start timing may<br>
be controlled based on the time calculated from the<br>
temperature and the dimension. Thereby, the start<br>
timing of the secondary molding is defined as the<br>
timing in which the temperature of the primary<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
molding has reached a temperature higher than the<br>
glass transition point by 3 - 25°C.<br>
Japanese Patent 3,521,469 (Patent Reference<br>
5) describes a manufacturing method of resin lens<br>
array according to the process steps of: forming a<br>
resin layer on one side of a flat substrate by<br>
applying a transparent resin with a uniform<br>
thickness; urging the resin layer against an optical<br>
shielding plate of an optically shielding material<br>
formed with plural through-holes; forming lenses by<br>
extruding a part of the resin layer into the through-<br>
holes of the optical shielding plate; curing the<br>
resin layer to form a lens array sheet; and fixing<br>
the substrate and the optical shielding plate by way<br>
of the resin layer.<br>
Further, Japanese Laid-Open Patent<br>
Application 2004-45586 provides a method of<br>
manufacturing a microlens array sheet having an<br>
optical shielding layer comprising the steps of:<br>
irradiating a ultraviolet radiation to a microlens<br>
array sheet comprising a consecutive lamination of: a<br>
transparent support substrate carrying microlenses at<br>
one side and a transparent a photosensitive layer or<br>
a thermoplastic resin layer at the other side; a UV-<br>
cure adhesive resin layer colored in black; and a<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
protective film layer, such that the ultraviolet<br>
radiation is applied to the side where the lenses are<br>
formed; curing the UV-cure resin layer at the parts<br>
where the UV radiation is focused by the microlenses<br>
to cause transfer of the cured resin layer<br>
corresponding to the focused parts to the protective<br>
film layer; peeling off the cured resin layer of the<br>
focused parts from the transparent photosensitive<br>
layer or the thermoplastic layer by peeling the<br>
protective film layer therefrom and forming an<br>
optical shielding pattern of the UV-cure resin layer<br>
in correspondence to the parts not exposed to the UV<br>
radiation and remaining in intimate contact with the<br>
transparent photosensitive layer.<br>

Arrays<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION. . .<br>
[Problem with Manufacture of Lens Array]<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
When manufacturing a miniature composite<br>
honeycomb structure, a typical example of which being<br>
the one shown in Figure 1, more than one hundred<br>
lenses 72 are assembled to form a microlens array in<br>
an optical shielding part 71 in the form of lattice<br>
by way of molding process.<br>
With such a honeycomb structure, there is a<br>
need of solving, the problems that:<br>
(a)	forming the optical shielding part as<br>
thin as possible; and<br>
(b)	maintaining high precision after<br>
formation of the composite.<br>
In the case of the technology of Patent<br>
Reference 1, in which the optical shielding part is<br>
injected after arraying the lenses, there arises no<br>
problem with regard to the foregoing point (a) . On<br>
the other hand, there is a possibility with this<br>
technology to form the lenses after formation of the<br>
optical shielding part. In such a case, however, the<br>
optical shielding part may be damaged at the time of<br>
removing the composite from the mold.<br>
Further, in the case the microlens array is<br>
miniaturized and the thickness of the optical<br>
shielding part is reduced to about 20um, it is not<br>
possible to fill such a small space with ordinary<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
injection molding process because of the too large<br>
viscosity of the resin, and it is not possible to<br>
form the optical shielding part by way of the molding<br>
process.<br>
In order to attend to the problem (b) noted<br>
above, Patent Reference 2 describes the process of<br>
forming a lens array by injecting the lenses to the<br>
holes formed in the optical shielding part, followed<br>
by pressing. However, this process of Patent<br>
Reference 2 has a drawback in that it requires high<br>
precision for the dimension of the optical shielding<br>
part and high precision for the alignment of the<br>
optical shielding part.<br>
In order to attend to the foregoing problem<br>
of Patent Reference 2, Patent Reference 4 proposes a<br>
dimension control by way of the temperature control.<br>
However, this process of Patent Reference 4 suffers<br>
from the problem of high cost in view of the need of<br>
using expensive apparatus and long cycle time for the<br>
forming process.<br>
Further, Patent Reference 5 proposes the<br>
solution of the foregoing problems. More specifically,<br>
the process of Patent Reference 5 forms the lens part<br>
by urging a transparent sheet to the optical<br>
shielding part and causing plastic deformation in the<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
sheet material. While this process is effective for<br>
eliminating the misalignment between the lenses and<br>
the optical shielding part, there is a problem that -<br>
the lens shape cannot be controlled because of the<br>
absence of lens mold.<br>
Patent Reference 3, on the other hand,<br>
teaches the method of forming a microlens array by<br>
forming the optical shielding pattern after formation<br>
of the microlenses, by disposing an adhesive UV-cure<br>
resin layer behind the lenses and causing focusing of<br>
UV radiation to the UV-cure resin through the lenses.<br>
While this method is effective for eliminating the<br>
misalignment between the lenses and the optical<br>
shielding part, the size and/or shape of the optical<br>
shielding part is restricted by the form of the<br>
lenses. More particularly, this process has a<br>
drawback in that the optical shielding pattern<br>
inevitably takes a tapered shape because of the<br>
curing taking place with the focusing of the UV<br>
radiation.<br>
[Problem with Manufacture of Optical Fiber Array]<br>
	 - With, regard, to. the method of forming the—<br>
plastic optical fiber array, it takes a very long<br>
time when the optical fibers are laid one by one to<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
form the optical fiber array. Such an approach is<br>
hardly efficient.<br>
Thus, there is a proposal shown in Figure<br>
19A to form a comb-shaped molding 1 having plural<br>
bar-shaped fingers lb extending parallel from a<br>
bridging part la and cause the bar-shaped fingers lb<br>
to make a contact substantially simultaneously with<br>
the a molten resin 2 by lowering the comb-shaped<br>
molding 1 toward the molten resin 2.<br>
Thereafter, the comb-shaped molding 1 is<br>
pulled up in the step of Figure 19B gently in the<br>
upward direction while irradiating a weak UV<br>
radiation, and with this, the molten resin 2 is<br>
pulled up with the bar-shaped fingers lb to form<br>
cores 4 extending parallel with each other in<br>
correspondence to the fingers lb of the comb shaped<br>
member 1.<br>
Further, in the step of Figure 19C, a resin<br>
member 3 is attached to the distal end parts of the<br>
cores 4 to hold the cores 4 in the respective<br>
positions, and ultraviolet radiation is applied for<br>
fully curing the cores 4 thus formed.<br>
Next, in the step of Figure 19D, the. cores<br>
4 thus formed are dipped in a resin 6 held in a<br>
vessel in the state that the cores 4 are held between<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
the comb-shaped molding 1 and the resin member 3, and<br>
with this, a cladding layer is formed on each of the<br>
cores 4.	. . ..<br>
Further, in the step of Figure 19E, the<br>
member including the cores 4 carrying thereon the<br>
cladding layer and held between the comb-shaped<br>
molding 1 and the resin member 3 is dipped in a<br>
thermosetting resin 8 held in a vessel 9. After<br>
curing the thermosetting resin 8, the comb-shaped<br>
molding 1 and the resin member 3 are disconnected in<br>
the step of Figure 19F.<br>
This is the technology disclosed in Patent<br>
Reference 6.<br>
With the technology of Patent Reference 6,<br>
on the other hand, there arises a problem, associated<br>
with its principle of forming the cores by pulling up<br>
the comb-shaped member 1, in that the cores 4<br>
inevitably have a tapered shape. Thus, the optical<br>
fiber array formed with such a process suffers from<br>
the problem of low efficiency of light utilization.<br>
The present invention addresses the<br>
foregoing problem by forming the cladding layer at<br>
first by an extension process, followed, by injection-<br>
of core material into the hollow space inside the<br>
cladding layer to form a plastic optical fiber array.<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
With such a process of forming the cladding<br>
layer part at first, there is a need of providing the<br>
technology of forming a cell array structure in which<br>
columnar cells are formed side-by-side.<br>
Conventionally, there is a process of<br>
forming a honeycomb structure according to Japanese<br>
Patent Publication 56-34780 (Patent Reference 9)<br>
comprising the steps of holding a plastic material<br>
between heating platens having an escaping holes of<br>
the plastic material; pressing and heating the resin<br>
between the platens; and pulling apart the platens<br>
from each other to expand the plastic material. This<br>
conventional process, which uses a plastic material<br>
for the honeycomb structure, however, has a drawback<br>
in that the honeycomb structure has a thick cell wall.<br>
Further, similar problem arises also in the<br>
technology described in Patent Reference 7 or Patent<br>
Reference 8 because of the use of thermoplastic resin.<br>
Meanwhile, it is known to form a cell of<br>
very thin cell wall by expanding water containing<br>
surfactant as in the case of soap bubble. With this<br>
process, it is possible to form a cell having a wall<br>
thickness of several nanometers to several microns.<br>
On the other hand, soap bubbles use the effects of<br>
electrostatic repulsion, interaction between<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
hydrophobic groups, Marangoni effect, and the like,<br>
wherein such effects become insignificant with drying<br>
of the film and the soap bubble -is-collapsed in due<br>
course. Further, in the case of plastic, none of<br>
these effects are available.<br>
In the bubbling process for forming a<br>
honeycomb structure or cell array structure of<br>
elongated columnar shape, it is important to cause<br>
the bubbling at the same time. When the bubbled are<br>
formed one by one without relationship, the bubbles<br>
take a spherical form and the desired honeycomb<br>
structure is not formed.<br>
It should be noted that Patent Reference 7<br>
and Patent Reference 8 attempts the bubbling by way<br>
of heating, while such formation of bubbles by<br>
heating cannot form the desired honeycomb structure<br>
unless the heating is achieved with uniform<br>
temperature.<br>
Further, the technology of Patent Reference<br>
9 forms the honeycomb structure by the operation of<br>
separating the platens from each other as noted<br>
before, while it is very important with such a<br>
process to control the viscosity of the plastic to be<br>
uniform. Thus, formation of honeycomb structure with<br>
this process is also difficult.<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
In an aspect, the present invention<br>
provides a method of forming a cellular array<br>
structure in which plural columnar cells are disposed<br>
adjacent to each other, comprising:<br>
a first step of laminating a deformable<br>
layer on a substrate formed with plural depressions,<br>
said plural depressions being formed in said<br>
substrate in a manner isolated from each other, said<br>
deformable layer being laminated on said substrate<br>
such that said depressions define respective spaces<br>
isolated from each other; and<br>
a second step of causing said space to<br>
expand in said plural depressions by causing plastic<br>
deformation in said deformable layer, such that said<br>
plural columnar cells are formed in said deformable<br>
layer respectively in correspondence to said<br>
depressions.<br>
According to the present invention, it<br>
becomes possible to form a cellular array structure<br>
in which plural columnar cells defined by a cell wall<br>
of very small thickness are disposed adjacent with<br>
each other, by a simple and reliable process.<br>
In another -aspect, the present invention<br>
provides a method for manufacturing a miniature<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
composite component in which plural columnar members<br>
are disposed in a matrix, comprising:<br>
a first step of laminating a-deformable<br>
layer on a substrate formed with plural depressions,<br>
said plural depressions being formed in said<br>
substrate in a manner isolated from each other, said<br>
deformable layer being laminated on said substrate<br>
such that said depressions define respective spaces<br>
isolated from each other;<br>
a second step of causing said space to<br>
expand in said plural depressions by causing plastic<br>
deformation in said deformable layer, such that<br>
plural columnar cells are formed in said deformable<br>
layer respectively in correspondence to said<br>
depressions; and<br>
forming said plural columnar members<br>
respectively in said plural columnar cells,<br>
said deformable member forming said matrix.<br>
According to the present invention, it<br>
becomes possible to form a miniature composite<br>
component in which plural columnar members are<br>
disposed in a matrix in the form or array.<br>
Particularly, it becomes possible with the present<br>
invention to form the columnar members in the form of<br><br>
- 19 -<br>
microlens array defined with thin shells forming an<br>
optical shielding part.<br>
-- In another aspect, the present invention<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[OVERVIEW OF THE INVENTION]<br>
In view of the prior art noted heretofore,<br>
the present invention has its main objective of:<br>
(1) providing a method of manufacturing a<br>
miniature cell array structure including therein an<br>
array of miniature columnar cells comprising the<br>
steps of: expanding plural, mutually isolated cells<br>
in a common direction with mutually identical<br>
expansion time and expansion amount such that the<br><br>
- 23 -<br>
miniature columnar cells are formed adjacent with<br>
each other across a thin shell wall; and fixing the<br>
expanded columnar cells promptly while maintaining<br>
respective shapes thereof.<br>
Further, the present invention has a first<br>
subsidiary objective of:<br>
(1.1)	providing a simple and easy method of<br>
manufacturing a miniature lens array in which<br>
individual miniature lenses forming the array have<br>
high precision and formed in a manner that the<br>
individual lenses are isolated from each other by a<br>
thin optical shielding part.<br>
Further, the present invention has a second<br>
subsidiary objective of:<br>
(1.2)	providing a simple and easy method of<br>
manufacturing an optical fiber array capable of<br>
forming an optical fiber array with high precision<br>
and with high efficiency of utilization of light.<br>
The main objective of the present invention<br>
is attained by the method of manufacturing a<br>
miniature cell array structure comprising: a first<br>
step of covering a first substrate formed with plural,<br>
mutually.independent depressions-at respective<br>
locations with a first material having a function of<br>
plastic deformation such that spaces are formed in<br><br>
- 24 -<br>
the respective depressions; and a second step of<br>
forming elongated columnar cells isolated by a thin<br>
cell wall by causing to expand the foregoing spaces<br>
simultaneously in a predetermined direction by a gas<br>
pressure in the foregoing spaces.<br>
According to the foregoing manufacturing<br>
method of the present invention, it becomes possible<br>
to cause the expansion of the first material with the<br>
gas pressure of the spaced by decreasing the pressure<br>
at the side of the substrate covered with the first<br>
material.<br>
Here, it should be noted that "mutually<br>
independent depressions" noted above means that<br>
individual depressions form a respective, mutually<br>
isolated spaces not communicating with the rear side<br>
of the first material or communicating with other<br>
depressions.<br>
The first subsidiary objective of the<br>
present invention is attained by the method of<br>
manufacturing a miniature composite component,<br>
comprising: a first step of covering a first<br>
substrate formed with plural, mutually independent<br>
depressions at respective locations with, a first ... _<br>
material having a function of plastic deformation<br>
such that spaces are formed in the respective<br><br>
- 25 -<br>
depressions; a second step of expanding the first<br>
material at plural locations simultaneously by the<br>
gas pressure of the spaces to form elongated cells<br>
having thin cell walls such that the cells are<br>
elongated in a predetermined, common direction; and<br>
third step of forming the cellular shape and the<br>
depressions by injecting a second material without<br>
departing the first material from the first substrate.<br>
The foregoing depressions may have the<br>
shape of a lens. In this case, the present invention<br>
provides a method of manufacturing a lens array as<br>
the miniature composite component, by forming the<br>
lenses by using the miniature cell array structure of<br>
the first material as the optical shielding part and<br>
injecting the material of lens into the miniature<br>
cell array structure without separating the lens mold<br>
and the miniature cell array structure (optical<br>
shielding part) from each other.<br>
The second subsidiary objective of the<br>
present invention is attained by the method of<br>
manufacturing an optical fiber plate in which the<br>
cell array structure is injected with a core member<br>
having a refractive index larger than the refractive..<br>
index of the cell array structure. With this process,<br>
the cell array structure is removed subsequently, and<br><br>
- 26 -<br>
the gap formed with such removal of the cell array is<br>
filled with a cladding material.<br>
In order .to solve the second- subsidiary<br>
objective and to obtain a miniature cell array<br>
structure including therein elongated columnar cells<br>
defined with thin cell walls, the present invention<br>
discloses a method of arraying a number of bubbles or<br>
cells in an aqueous solution added with a surfactant<br>
and solidifying the bubbles after causing<br>
simultaneous dilatation in such a manner that the<br>
shape of the bubbles is maintained during the<br>
solidification process.<br>
Particularly, the present invention<br>
provides the independent depressed spaces<br>
(depressions) on the top surface of the substrate and<br>
uses the means of controlling the pressure of the<br>
ambient in which the substrate is placed.<br>
Further, in order to dry the cellular array<br>
structure without causing disintegration in the shape<br>
thereof, the present invention discloses a method of<br>
using a gelatin solution that causes a sol-gel<br>
transition with temperature change for the deformable<br>
material. With this,, the gelatin solution .Is...changed<br>
to gel for increasing the rigidity thereof before<br>
conducting the drying process. Here, it should be<br><br>
- 27 -<br>
noted that the "deformable material" noted above<br>
means the material that forms the cellular array<br>
structure therein when it is processed according, to<br>
the present invention.<br>
According to the present invention, the<br>
method of manufacturing the cellular array structure<br>
comprises the steps of: covering a top surface of a<br>
substrate (A) formed with minute depressions with<br>
high density with a deformable material (B) having<br>
the function of ductile deformation under a<br>
predetermined condition by applying the deformable<br>
material (B) on the top surface of the substrate (A);<br>
causing expansion in the deformable material (B) ..by<br>
the gas pressure in the closed spaces formed between<br>
the depressions and the deformable material (B) such<br>
that the plural spaces are elongated simultaneously<br>
and such that there are formed a number of elongated<br>
cells extending in a predetermined direction in the<br>
state separated from each other by thin walls having<br>
a micrometer thickness, wherein the depressions on<br>
the substrate (A) are formed in a manner isolated<br>
from each other.<br>
With regard to the manufacturing method, of,<br>
the cellular array structure, it becomes possible to<br>
extend the deformable material (B) by lowering the<br><br>
- 28 -<br>
pressure at the side of the substrate (A) covered by<br>
the deformable material (B).<br>
With-the foregoing method of manufacturing .<br>
the cellular array structure, it is possible to use a<br>
gelatin aqueous solution added with a surfactant for<br>
the deformable material (B).<br>
Further, the method of manufacturing the<br>
cellular array structure may be conducted by<br>
providing a ventilation space behind the deformable<br>
material (B) such that the deformable material (B) is<br>
dried from this side.<br>
With regard to the method of manufacturing<br>
the cellular array structure, it is preferable to<br>
form the ventilation space behind the deformable<br>
material (B) provided on the substrate (A) and causes<br>
a member to make contact with the deformable cell<br>
array structure (B) from the behind such that the<br>
member is formed with penetrating holes with a pitch<br>
smaller than the pitch of the columnar cells formed<br>
in the deformable material (B). Thereby, drying of<br>
the deformable material (B) is conducted via such<br>
through-holes.<br>
	 Further, it is preferable, to process the _ ..<br>
depressions such that the depressions have a water-<br>
repellant surface. Further, it is preferable to form<br><br>
- 29 -<br>
the depressions such that the depressions have a<br>
large diameter in the interior of the substrate (A)<br>
as compared with at the top surface.<br>
Next, the means of solution of the second<br>
subsidiary objective will be explained.<br>
1)	The means for expanding the cellular<br>
array structure<br>
For the means of expanding the<br>
cellular array structure such that plural columnar<br>
cells are formed side by side therein, there is<br>
provided a substrate structure in which plural<br>
depressions are formed on the surface of a substrate,<br>
in combination with the means for applying the<br>
deformable material such that there are formed spaces<br>
between the respective depressions and the deformable<br>
material formed on the substrate.<br>
2)	The means for forming thin cell walls<br>
(1)	In order to form the columnar<br>
cells with thin cell walls, the present invention<br>
uses an aqueous solution containing a surfactant and<br>
dissolved with a gelatin that causes a sol-gel<br>
transition upon temperature change for the means for<br>
forming the thin cell walls.	<br>
(2)	Further, the present invention<br>
uses the means for causing dry shrinking. Here, it<br><br>
- 30 -<br>
should be noted that this means for causing dry-<br>
shrinking means a depressurizing process conducted by<br>
using a pressure control apparatus. Therein,<br>
evaporation of water content contained in the gelatin<br>
is accelerated, and with this, thinning of the cell<br>
wall caused by shrinkage of the volume of the<br>
material forming the cell wall, which in turn is<br>
caused by the water evaporation, is facilitated.<br>
3) The means for solidifying the cell walls<br>
while maintaining the columnar cell array structure<br>
(1)	For solidifying the cell walls<br>
while maintaining the columnar cell array structure,<br>
the present invention uses an aqueous solution added<br>
with a surfactant and dissolved with a gelatin that<br>
causes a sol-gel transition with temperature, for the<br>
material of the deformable material.<br>
(2)	Further, the present invention<br>
controls the temperature to the state of sols during<br>
the phase of expansion and control the temperature to<br>
the state of gels after the expansion has been<br>
completed.<br>
(3)	Further, the present invention<br>
secures a space for facilitating drying of the<br>
deformable material while not restricting the<br>
expansion thereof. With this, there is facilitated<br><br>
- 31 -<br>
evaporation of water as a result of decompression,<br>
and the cell array structure formed as a result of<br>
the expansion o.f the deformable material is<br>
solidified as a result of the drying.<br>
4) Other means<br>
Further, the present invention attains<br>
the simultaneous expansion of the cells and high<br>
speed drying of the deformable material at the same<br>
time by depressurizing by way of depressurizing means.<br>
[The method of manufacturing optical fiber array]<br>
Further, the present invention provides a<br>
method of manufacturing an optical fiber array based<br>
on the foregoing method of manufacturing miniature<br>
cellular array structure. Thus, the present invention<br>
forms an optical fiber array in which a large number<br>
of optical fibers are disposed in the form of high-<br>
density array, by injecting core material of a<br>
refractive index higher than the refractive index of<br>
the deformable material (B), into the cells in the<br>
miniature cell array structure formed of the<br>
deformable material (B) now forming the cell walls.<br>
Further, the present invention provides a<br>
"method of manufacturing an optical fiber array",<br>
comprising the steps of: injecting a core material<br>
into the cells of a miniature cell array structure<br><br>
- 32 -<br>
formed by the "method of manufacturing a miniature<br>
cellular array structure"; removing the deformable<br>
material (B) ; and forming a. large number ..of optical<br>
fibers in the form of an array in the spaces formed<br>
as a result of the step of removing the deformable<br>
material (B) by filling the spaces thus formed<br>
simultaneously with a cladding material.<br>

- 33 -<br>
According to the first aspect, it becomes<br>

and high precision at the same time.<br>
(2)	Second aspect of the invention<br>

cells without separating the first material and the<br>
first substrate from each other to form the cells<br>
such that the cells have respective end parts<br>
corresponding to the depressions on the first<br>
substrate<br>
According to the third aspect of the<br>
present invention, the spaces are formed in the<br>
depressions in the first step and the first material<br>
is expanded and extended in the second step, and thus,<br>
it becomes possible to form the plural cells<br>
simultaneously.<br>
Further, by injecting the second material<br>
to the cells in a third step, it becomes possible to<br>
form the plural cells simultaneously, such that each<br>
cell includes an end part corresponding to the<br>
depression on the first substrate.<br><br>
- 35 -<br>
Particularly, it becomes possible to<br>
manufacture the cells without misalignment between<br>
the part formed in the first and second steps., and the<br>
part formed in the third step, by conducting the<br>
third step continuously to the first and second steps,<br>
without separating the first material and the first<br>
substrate from each other.<br>
(4) Fourth aspect of the invention<br>
According to a fourth aspect, the present<br>
invention provides a method of manufacturing a<br>
miniature composite component, comprising: a first<br>
step of covering a surface of a first substrate<br>
formed with a large number of mutually independent<br>
depressions (depressions not communicating to the<br>
outside or other depressions) at respective,<br>
predetermined locations, with a first material that<br>
has a function of ductile deformation under a<br>
predetermined condition, such that there are formed<br>
spaces in the foregoing depressions on the first<br>
substrate; a second step of expanding and extending<br>
the first material by the gas pressure in the<br>
foregoing plural spaces simultaneously to form a<br>
miniature array.of cells in the first material such<br>
that the plural cells extend parallel in a<br>
predetermined direction; a third step of adhering a<br><br>
- 36 -<br>
third material to a cell wall of the plural cells<br>
without separating the first material and the first<br>
substrate form each other; and a fourth step of<br>
injecting a second material to the plural cells<br>
without separating the first material and the first<br>
substrate from each other to form the cells such that<br>
the cells have respective end parts corresponding to<br>
the depressions on the first substrate.<br>
According to the present invention, it<br>
becomes possible to form the miniature composite<br>
component with high precision similarly to the third<br>
aspect of the present invention in view of the fact<br>
that the third and fourth steps are conducted without<br>
separating the first material and the first substrate<br>
from each other.<br>
(5) Fifth aspect of the invention<br>
According to a fifth aspect, the present<br>
invention carries out the expansion and the extension<br>
of the first material in the state that the first<br>
material is sandwiched between the first substrate<br>
and a second substrate.<br>
According to the fifth aspect, it becomes<br>
possible to achieve high precision in the shape of<br>
the cells with the use of the second substrate. By-<br>

length.<br>
(6)	Sixth aspect of the invention<br>
According to a sixth aspect, it becomes<br>
possible to generate the gas pressure in the spaces<br>
corresponding to the depressions in the first step by<br>
causing depressurizing. With the use of<br>
depressurizing, the gas pressure becomes uniform in<br>
all the spaces corresponding to the foregoing plural<br>
depressions at any time, and it becomes possible to<br>
form the cells to have a uniform volume and shape.<br>
(7)	Seventh aspect of the invention<br>

material is applied to the opening parts of the cells<br>
in a depressurized state, and the second material<br>
thus applied is injected into the cells by increasing<br>
the pressure beyond the atmospheric pressure.<br>
According to the present invention, there<br>
is formed a uniform static pressure because of the<br>
use of the difference of gas pressure, the injection<br>
of the second material is conducted uniformly,<br>
without variation. Further, the first and second<br>
steps can be conducted in continuation in the same<br>
apparatus at the time of manufacturing, and it<br><br>
- 38 -<br>

the miniature composite component.<br>
(8)	Eighth aspect of the invention<br>
According to an eighth aspect, it becomes<br>
possible to inject the second material into the cells<br>
by applying the second material at the opening parts<br>
of the cells in a depressurized state and<br>
subsequently applying a centrifugal force. By using<br>
the centrifugal force, the substances of different<br>
specific gravity are separated easily, and thus, it<br>
becomes possible to easily evacuate the gas in the<br>
cells and inject the second material in the liquid<br>
state into the cells.<br>
(9)	Ninth aspect of the invention<br>
According to a ninth aspect, the present<br>
invention can manufacture a miniature lens array<br>
(microlens array) for the miniature composite<br>
component.<br>
(10)	Tenth aspect of the invention<br>
According to a tenth aspect, the present<br>
invention uses a slab of hydrophobic nature for the<br>
second substrate. With this, the first material is<br>
easily.separated from the second substrate in the<br>
second step, and thus, it becomes possible to form<br>
the penetrating cells easily.<br><br>
- 39 -<br>
(11)	Eleventh aspect of the invention<br>
According to an eleventh aspect, the<br>
depressions formed on .the first substrate have the<br>
shape of a lens. Thus, according to the present<br>
invention, it becomes possible to transfer the lens<br>
shape to the cells in the third step of the third<br>
aspect or in the fourth step of the fourth aspect<br>
with the dilatation of the gas caused in the first<br>
step. Thus, transfer of the lens shape is achieved at<br>
the same time to the formation of the cells, and it<br>
becomes possible with the eleventh aspect to form a<br>
lens array for the miniature composite component.<br>
(12)	Twelfth aspect of the invention<br>
According to a twelfth aspect, the present<br>
invention provides a miniature lens array in which<br>
the lenses forming the lens array are separated from<br>
each other by the first material having the function<br>
of optical shielding, by using a transparent material<br>
for the second material and an opaque or optical<br>
shielding material for the first material. With this,<br>
flare or stray light is eliminated in the lens array.<br>
(13)	Thirteen aspect of the invention<br>
According to a thirteen aspect, the<br>
miniature lens array (microlens array) of the present<br>
invention is formed of the first material at least<br><br>
- 40 -<br>
having the function of isolation, the second material<br>
having the function of optical transmission, and the<br>
third material having the function of optical<br>
shielding. With this, it becomes possible to obtain a<br>
miniature lens array (microlens array) free from<br>
stray light or flare. Because the miniature lens<br>
array of the thirteen aspect attains the foregoing<br>
three functions by three different materials, it<br>
becomes possible to enhance the respective functions<br>
as compared with the invention of the twelfth aspect.<br>
Further, there is attained increased degree of<br>
freedom at the time of manufacture of the miniature<br>
lens array.<br>
(14) Fourteenth aspect of the invention<br>
According to a fourteenth aspect, the<br>
present invention provides a method of manufacturing<br>
a miniature cell array structure, comprising the<br>
steps of: covering a top surface of a substrate (A)<br>
formed with minute depressions with high density with<br>
a deformable material (B) having a function of<br>
ductile deformation under a predetermined condition;<br>
extending the deformable material (B) by a gas<br>
pressure in plural spaces formed by the plural<br>
depressions and the deformable material, such that<br>
the plural spaces are expanded and elongated in a<br><br>
- 41 -<br>
predetermined direction to form plural cells<br>
separated from each other by thin cell walls of a<br>
micron thickness, wherein the depressions are formed<br>
independently on the substrate (A).<br>
According to the present invention, the<br>
depressions on the substrate (A) are formed<br>
independently to each other, and thus, the expansion<br>
time and the expansion amount become identical<br>
between the plural depressions when depressurization<br>
is applied. Thereby, the elongated, columnar cells<br>
are formed uniformly in a manner separated form each<br>
other by the cell walls formed of the deformable<br>
material.<br>
(15)	Fifteenth aspect of the invention<br>
According to a fifteen aspect, the present<br>
invention depressurizes the side of the substrate (A)<br>
covered with the deformable material (B), and thus,<br>
the expansion time and expansion amount become<br>
identical between the adjacent depressions. Thereby,<br>
it becomes possible to grow a cell array formed of<br>
plural, mutually independent columnar cells uniformly.<br>
(16)	Sixteenth aspect of the invention<br>
According to a sixteenth aspect, the<br>
present invention uses a gelatin aqueous solution<br>
added with a surfactant for the deformable material<br><br>
- 42 -<br>
(B). Thus, the cells are grown like soap bubbles<br>
having a very thin cell wall, wherein the cells thus<br>
grown undergo transition to. a.gel thereafter. Thereby<br>
the cells are dried while maintaining the shape<br>
thereof. Further, because the temperature of sol-gel<br>
transition is about 40°C, it becomes possible to<br>
increase the amount of expansion at low temperatures<br>
while suppressing the boiling of water, and it<br>
becomes possible to use a high degree of<br>
depressurization for the growth of the cell array<br>
structure.<br>
(17)	Seventeenth aspect of the invention<br>
According to a seventeenth aspect, the<br>
present invention provided a ventilation space at the<br>
side of the substrate (A) covered with the deformable<br>
material (B). With this, it is possible to dry the<br>
deformable material (B) form this side.<br>
(18)	Eighteenth aspect of the invention<br>
According to an eighteenth aspect, the<br>
present invention causes a structural body formed<br>
with penetrating holes with a pitch smaller than the<br>
pitch of the cells in the cell array structure to<br>
make a contact with the deformable material (B)<br>
covering the top surface of the substrate (A) where<br>
the depressions are formed. With this, it becomes<br><br>
- 43 -<br>
possible to control the relationship between the<br>
spaces formed in the structural body in the<br>
penetrating holes and the substrate (A), and the<br>
thickness of the deformable material (B) applied to<br>
the substrate (A) becomes uniform. Further, because<br>
the penetrating holes are formed with the pitch<br>
smaller than the pith of the cells in the deformable<br>
material (B), the cells can grow without losing their<br>
shapes. Further, by ventilating the space behind the<br>
deformable material (B) through the penetrating holes,<br>
the cells are solidified promptly.<br>
(6) Nineteenth aspect of the invention<br>
According to a nineteenth aspect, the<br>
present invention applies a process to make the<br>
depressions hydrophobic. With this, the deformable<br>
material (B) does not enter to the depressions at the<br>
time of application of the deformable material (B)<br>
upon the surface of the substrate (A).<br>
(20) Twentieth aspect of the invention<br>
According to a twelfth aspect of the<br>
present invention, the depressions are formed in the<br>
substrate (A) such that a diameter thereof is larger<br>
than a diameter of an opening part formed on the<br>
surface of the substrate (A) by the depressions.<br><br>
- 44 -<br>
According to the twentieth aspect, it<br>
becomes possible to apply the deformable material (B)<br>
on the surface of the substrate (A) without causing<br>
the deformable material (B) to invade substantially<br>
into the depressions on the substrate (A). Further,<br>
because of the reduced contact area of the opening<br>
parts, degassing from the depressions after the<br>
application of the deformable material (B) is reduced,<br>
and it becomes possible to cause maximum expansion<br>
for the cells at the time of the depressurizing.<br>
(21)	Twenty first aspect of the invention<br>
According to a twenty first aspect, the<br>
present invention injects a core material having a<br>
refractive index larger than the refractive index of<br>
the deformable material (B) into the cells formed in<br>
the deformable material (B). Thus, it becomes<br>
possible to manufacture an optical fiber array with<br>
high dimensional precision and high efficiency of<br>
utilization of light, with low cost and high<br>
production efficiency.<br>
(22)	Twenty second aspect of the invention<br>
According to a twenty second aspect, the<br>
present invention removes the deformable material (B,<br>
after injecting the core material into the cells<br>
formed in the deformable material (B), and fills the<br><br>
- 45 -<br>
gaps formed with the removal of the deformable<br>
material (B) , with a cladding material. As a result,<br>
it becomes possible to manufacture an optical fiber<br>
array having resistance to water while using various<br>
materials for the cores.<br>
Working Examples of the Invention<br>
Next, description will be made with regard<br>
to (1) "manufacturing of lens array", and (2)<br>
"manufacturing of an optical fiber plate (optical<br>
fiber array)".<br>
1. Manufacturing of Lens Array<br>
[Example 1]<br>
First, processing method pertinent to the<br>
third aspect of the invention will be explained with<br>
reference to Figure 1 and Figures 2A - 2F.<br>
Lens Mold (First Substrate)<br>
Referring to Figures 2A, it should be noted<br>
that a lens mold 80 (first substrate) is a mold that<br>
determines the pitch of the lens elements of a lens<br>
array to be formed. Further, the lens mold 80<br>
determines the basic structure of the cell array<br>
formed by expanding a deformable opaque material 82<br>
provided thereon so as to form voids therein in the<br>
form of columnar cells and used for holding the lens<br><br>
- 46 -<br>
elements of the lens array. Further, the lens mold 80<br>
is used for the mold of the lens elements in the<br>
process conducted after formation of the cell array.<br>
In Example 1, the lens mold 8 0 is formed of<br>
a silicone rubber having a water-repellent surface,<br>
and lens parts 80a are formed in the lens mold 80 in<br>
a lattice pattern with a pitch of 200pm. Each lens<br>
part 80a has a semispherical surface of the radius of<br>
180um, wherein one hundred and sixty nine such lens<br>
parts 80a are formed on the lens mold 80 in thirteen<br>
rows and thirteen columns.<br>
Opaque Material (First Material)<br>
The opaque material 82 is a deformable<br>
material forming the cellular array structure<br>
including the elongated, columnar cells defined by<br>
cell walls. The opaque material 82 thereby functions<br>
to suppress flares or stray light when optical<br>
elements are formed in the cells. In the Example 1,<br>
an UV-cure acrylic resin of the refractive index of<br>
1.56 is used for the opaque material 82. Thereby, in<br>
order to function as an opaque optical shield, the<br>
opaque material 82 is added with carbon black<br>
particles with the amount of 0.5wt%. Because the<br>
opaque material 82 has the same refractive index to<br><br>
- 47 -<br>
the lenses to be formed in the cells, there is caused<br>
no total reflection of light, and optical absorption<br>
is attained efficiently.<br>
Lens Material (Second Material)<br>
With Example 1, an UV-cure acrylic resin of<br>
the refractive index of 1.56 is used for lenses 83<br>
that are formed in the opaque material 82 in<br>
correspondence to the columnar cells therein.<br>
Pressure Control Apparatus<br>
A pressure control apparatus 100 compresses<br>
and/or evacuating gases and is used for controlling<br>
the dimension, primarily the height, of the cell<br>
array structure forming the cellular walls in the<br>
opaque material 82.<br>
[Function]<br>
The process of Example 1 proceeds as shown<br>
in Figures 2B - 2F.<br>
(1) In the step of Figure 2B, the opaque<br>
material 82 is spin-coated on a flat glass substrate<br>
81 transparent to ultraviolet lights and having a<br>
high degree of flatness, with a film thickness 0.1 -<br>
lOOum in the state that the glass substrate 81 is<br><br>
- 48 -<br>
placed upon the lens mold 80. In Example 1, the<br>
opaque material is spin-coated with the thickness of<br>
20um (First Step).. .<br>
The pressure control apparatus 100 is the<br>
apparatus capable of controlling the ambient pressure<br>
therein to a predetermined pressure. In Example 1,<br>
the ambient pressure is controlled usually to O.lMPa.<br>
It should be noted that this pressure is chosen for<br>
controlling the gas dilatation caused in the<br>
subsequent steps.<br>
(2) The structure of Figure 2B obtained in<br>
the first step is incorporated into the pressure<br>
control apparatus 100 and the ambient pressure<br>
therein is reduced to 0.003MPa.<br>
With this process of depressurization,<br>
there starts expansion or dilatation of gas in the<br>
spaces corresponding to the lens parts 80a, and thus,<br>
there is caused expansion of the spaces in the lens<br>
parts 80a with the expansion of the gas therein by<br>
causing deformation in the opaque material 82.<br>
Here, it should be noted that the expansion<br>
takes.place in all of the lens parts 80a on the lens<br>
mold 80 simultaneously, and thus, lateral expansion<br>
of the spaces is restricted because of the<br><br>
- 49 -<br>
interference of the adjacent spaces. Thus, the<br>
expansion takes place solely in the direction upward,<br>
leading to formation of a cell.._a.rr.ay structure in<br>
which plural columnar cells are formed adjacent with<br>
each other in the deformed opaque material 82 in<br>
correspondence to the lens parts 80a in such a manner<br>
that the plural cells extend parallel with each other<br>
in the upward direction from the substrate 80.<br>
Thereby, the opaque material 82 forms opaque cell<br>
walls 84 defining the columnar cells formed therein.<br>
In the state of Figure 2C, ultraviolet radiation is<br>
applied for about ten seconds for curing the opaque<br>
material 82 thus deformed, and with this, the opaque<br>
cell walls 84 thus formed are solidified and the<br>
cellular array structure is fixed (Second Step).<br>
Next, in the step of Figure 2D, the<br>
substrate 80 thus carrying thereon the cellular array<br>
structure is taken away from the pressure control<br>
apparatus 100. Further, after removing the glass<br>
substrate 81, the cells forming the cell array in the<br>
opaque material 82 are injected with a resin forming<br>
the lens, wherein this injection of the resin is<br>
conducted in a centrifugal separator under a<br>
centrifugal force of 3000G for 30 seconds (Third<br>
Step).<br><br>
- 50 -<br>
Here, it is important to note that the lens<br>
mold 80 and the cell walls 84 are not separated from<br>
each other during this, process.<br>
Next, in the step of Figure 2E, a reflector<br>
plate 85 transparent to the ultraviolet radiations is<br>
placed is placed upon the structure of Figure 2D and<br>
ultraviolet radiation is applied for about 10 seconds<br>
for curing the lens material 83. With this, lens<br>
elements 86 are formed in the cells of the cellular<br>
array structure in the form of lens array (Fourth<br>
Step).<br>
Finally, the lens mold 80 and the reflector<br>
plate.85 are removed, and the lens array is obtained<br>
such that microlens elements 86 are held in the<br>
elongated, columnar cells defined with the opaque<br>
cell walls 84.<br>
While not illustrated, it is preferable to<br>
anneal the structure thus obtained such that the<br>
curing proceeds thoroughly in the lens elements 86<br>
and also in the cell walls 84 and such that there<br>
remains no uncured site, especially in the opaque<br>
cell walls 84.<br>
[Example 2]<br><br>
- 51 -<br>
Example 2 is an embodiment corresponding to<br>
the second aspect of the invention and forms the<br>
opaque part in two. steps as. will be explained with<br>
reference to Figures 3A - 3G. Therein, it will be<br>
noted that the process of Example 2 is different from<br>
the process of Example 1 in the following aspects:<br>
(a)	a cell wall 94 corresponding to the<br>
opaque cell wall 8 4 of Example 1 includes an opaque<br>
film 94a covering a cell wall 94b; and<br>
(b)	an acrylic UV-cure resin is used for<br>
the material of the cell wall 94b (first material),<br>
while the opaque film (third material) 94a is formed<br>
by applying carbon black particles to the cell wall<br>
94b.<br>
Otherwise, Example 2 is identical to<br>
Example 1.<br>
[Function]<br>
The process of Example 3 is shown in<br>
Figures 3A - 3G, wherein there is no difference to<br>
the process of Example 1 except that an opaque liquid<br>
in which carbon black particles are dispersed in a<br>
volatile solvent is injected into the cells in the<br>
step of Figure 3D after formation of the cell walls<br>
94b. In Figures 3A - 3G, it should be noted that<br><br>
- 52 -<br>
those parts corresponding to the parts described<br>
previously with reference to Example 1 are designated<br>
by the same reference numerals and the description<br>
thereof will be omitted.<br>
Thereby, because the lens mold 80 has<br>
water-repellency, the opaque liquid adheres<br>
selectively to the cell walls 94b, and the carbon<br>
black particles thus adhered to the cell wall 94 form<br>
the foregoing opaque film 94a (Third Step).<br>
Because the material 92 corresponding to<br>
the material 82 of Example 1 is free from the opaque<br>
material with Example 2, the UV curing process of<br>
Figure 3C proceeds efficiently, and curing of the<br>
cell walls 94b is attained in short time. Further,<br>
because it becomes possible to use the opaque<br>
material in large amount, the effect of eliminating<br>
stray light or flares is enhanced with Example 2, and<br>
it becomes possible to suppress the leakage of light<br>
in the lens array effectively.<br>
[Example 3]<br>
Example 3 shown in Figures 4A and 4B<br>
provides an optical fiber array (optical fiber plate)<br>
formed by using the process of Example 1 and Example<br>
2.<br><br>
- 53 -<br>
Thus, with the construction of Figure 4A, a<br>
cladding layer 101 forms a cell array structure<br>
holding cores 102 in the cells of the cell array<br>
structure, wherein Example 3 forms the cladding layer<br>
101 by using a UV-cure methacrylate resin of the<br>
refractive index of 1.45 for the first material<br>
forming the cell walls while using a UV-cure acrylic<br>
resin of the refractive index of 1.56 for the second<br>
material used for the core 102.<br>
Thereby, it is possible to provide lens<br>
effect to the optical fiber elements by forming the<br>
optical fiber elements to have a semi-spherical as<br>
shown in Figure 4A.<br>
Alternatively, it is possible to form the<br>
optical fiber elements to have an end part of conical<br>
shape for diffusing the light as shown in Figure 4B.<br>
[Example 4]<br>
In contrast to the microlens array of<br>
Figure 1 in which the lens elements are arranged in<br>
the form of a lattice, Example 4 shown in Figure 5<br>
provides a lens array in which the lens elements are<br>
arranged in a staggered array.<br>
Thus, it is possible with the present<br>
invention to manufacture a miniature lens array of<br><br>
- 54 -<br>
staggered arrangement for the lens element shown in<br>
Figure 5 while using a similar process explained<br>
heretofore. In this case, it should be noted that the<br>
opaque cell walls forming the cladding layer 101 form<br>
therein cells of hexagonal pillar shape as shown in<br>
Figure 5, and the cores 102 filling the cells have<br>
the corresponding shape of hexagonal pillar.<br>
Next, the eighth aspect of the present<br>
invention that uses the second substrate of<br>
hydrophobic nature will be explained with reference<br>
to Figure 6.<br>
(Case 1) Second substrate is not water-repellent<br>
In the case the second substrate 81 lacks<br>
water-repellency, the cells are formed in the cell<br>
array structure of a second material 112<br>
corresponding to the deformable material 82 of<br>
Figures 2A - 2F as shown in Figure 6, wherein it will<br>
be noted that each cell has a closed end at the side<br>
facing the second substrate 81. This is because the<br>
film of the material 112 remained in contact with the<br>
second substrate 81 at the end part of the cells<br>
because of the high wetness between the second<br>
material 112 and the second substrate 81.<br>
(Case 2) Second substrate is water-repellent<br><br>
- 55 -<br>
In the case the second substrate 81 is<br>
repellent to water, there appears a cellular array<br>
structure similar to the case of Examples 1 and 2<br>
shown in Figures 2A - 2F or 3A - 3G in which each<br>
cell has opened ends. Such a structure is caused<br>
because the film of the second material 112 has moved<br>
elsewhere because of the poor wetting between the<br>
second material 112 and the second substrate 81.<br>
From Cases 1 and 2 noted above, it will be<br>
understood that control of the cell array structure<br>
is possible by the water-repellent nature of the<br>
first substrate 80.<br>
2. Examples of manufacturing optical fiber plate<br>
[Example 5] - Method of forming a cell array<br>
structure of columnar elongated cells<br>
Figures 7-9 show the process of<br>
manufacturing an optical fiber plate (optical fiber<br>
array) according to Example 5.<br>
Referring to the drawings, there is<br>
provided a temperature control apparatus 22 on a<br>
coater machine 21, and a substrate (A) carrying a<br>
large number of depressions on a top surface thereof<br>
with high density is mounted upon the temperature<br>
control apparatus 22.<br><br>
- 56 -<br>
With this embodiment, a cell array<br>
structure including therein fine columnar cells with<br>
high density is formed on such a substrate (A).<br>
The construction and operation of Example 5<br>
will be explained hereinafter.<br>
1. Construction of Example 5<br>
(1)	Substrate (A)<br>
The substrate (A) of Figure 7 serves for<br>
the mold for growing a cell array structure thereon<br>
and determines the pitch of the cells in the cell<br>
array structure thus formed. More specifically, the<br>
substrate (A) is formed of a silicon rubber and is<br>
formed with depressions 23 having a semispherical<br>
shape of the diameter of 25um in a staggered pattern<br>
with a pitch of 38um.<br>
(2)	Cellular structure material (B)<br>
The cell array structure material (B) of<br>
Figure 7 forms the body of the cell array structure<br>
formed with a number of columnar, elongated cells.<br>
For the cell array structure material (B) , it is<br>
possible to use an aqueous solution of commercially<br>
available gelatin (trade name Jellice) diluted by<br>
five times in purified water and added with a<br>
surfactant (dodecyl sodium sulfate) by lwt%. In this<br><br>
- 57 -<br>
case, the sol-gel transition takes place for the<br>
material of the cell array structure at about 38°C.<br>
(3)	Temperature control apparatus<br>
The temperature control apparatus 22<br>
control the viscosity (sol-gel transition) by<br>
controlling the temperature of the cellular<br>
structural material (B).<br>
(4)	Pressure control apparatus<br>
A pressure control apparatus 24 of Figure 7<br>
is an apparatus that compresses and evacuates gases<br>
and controls the dimension, particularly the height<br>
of the cell array structure. Further, the pressure<br>
control apparatus facilitates drying of the cellular<br>
structural material (B).<br>
(5)	Ejector<br>
An ejector 25 of Figure 7 is a device for<br>
ejecting the cellular structural material (B) on the<br>
substrate (A) with a predetermined amount.<br>
(6)	Coater machine<br>
The coater machine 21 of Figure 7 is an<br>
apparatus that spreads the cellular structural<br><br>
- 58 -<br>
material (B) ejected on the top surface of the<br>
substrate (A) from the ejector 25 to form a film of a<br>
predetermined thickness. In the illustrated example,<br>
the coater machine 21 is a spin-coater that utilizes<br>
a centrifugal force.<br>
Operation of Example 1<br>
(1)	First, the ambient pressure of the<br>
coater machine 21 is controlled to a predetermined<br>
pressure such as 0.IMPa by using the pressure control<br>
apparatus 24. This process is conducted for<br>
controlling the amount of gas dilation in the later<br>
process.<br>
(2)	The temperature of the substrate (A) is<br>
controlled by using the temperature control apparatus<br>
22. Thereby, heating may be conducted by any of<br>
heater, infrared light, microwave, and the like. In<br>
the case of Example 1, an electric cartridge heater<br>
is used for the temperature control apparatus 22. The<br>
temperature may be set close to the sol-gel<br>
transition temperature such as 38°C. This temperature<br>
is chosen for controlling the viscosity, and hence<br>
sol-gel transition of the cellular structural<br>
material (B).<br><br>
- 59 -<br>
(B) Eject the cellular structural material<br>
(B) on the substrate (A) by using the ejector 25.<br>
Almost simultaneously, the cellular structural<br>
material (B) thus ejected is spread over the<br>
substrate (A) by squeezing or spin-coating, such that<br>
there are formed vacant spaces in the depressions 23.<br>
In this step of coating, the cellular structural<br>
material (B) may form a film having a film thickness<br>
of 1 - lOOum. In the example of Embodiment 5, the<br>
cellular structural material (B) forms a film of the<br>
thickness of lOum. Ejection of the cellular<br>
structural material (B) from the ejector 25 is<br>
attained at the temperature of 45°C, and hence in the<br>
state of sol of low viscosity.<br>
(4) Lower the ambient pressure of the<br>
coater machine 21, after lowering the temperature of<br>
the substrate (A) such that there is caused gel<br>
transition in the cellular structural material (B).<br>
With Example 5, the control temperature of<br>
the temperature control apparatus 22 is reduced to<br>
20°C and the ambient pressure is lowered thereafter<br>
to 0.03MPa by using the pressure control apparatus 24.<br>
With this, the gas in the spaces of the depressions<br>
starts dilatation and the spaces cause extension as<br>
represented in Figure 8.<br><br>
- 60 -<br>
Thereby, because of the simultaneous<br>
dilatations in the adjacent depressions 23, lateral<br>
expansion of the spaces is restricted and the<br>
dilatation of the spaces takes place only in the<br>
direction upward from the substrate (A). Thus, there<br>
are formed a number of cells 31 simultaneously in the<br>
cellular structural material (B) in the form of<br>
mutually independent elongated bubbles, while the<br>
bubbles or cells 31 thus formed form a columnar cell<br>
array structure 30.<br>
Thereafter, the temperature of the<br>
substrate (A) is lowered by the temperature control<br>
apparatus 22, and the cellular structural material<br>
(B) thus formed with a cell array structure is<br>
solidified and dried while maintaining the shape<br>
thereof. Thereby, the time for the solidification is<br>
reduced greatly by evacuating the ambient by using<br>
the pressure control apparatus 24.<br>
(5) Next, the processing chamber of the<br>
pressure control apparatus 24 is opened and the work<br>
corresponding to the cell array structure thus formed<br>
is taken out to the outside.<br>
Figure 8 shows the cell array structure<br>
thus formed in an enlarged scale in the state that<br>
the cell array structure is taken out from the<br><br>
- 61 -<br>
pressure control apparatus 24 after 10 minutes<br>
elapsed from the dilatation process and in the state<br>
that the substrate (A) is removed.<br>
It was confirmed that the cell array<br>
structure thus obtained is sufficiently dried and has<br>
a mechanical strength maintaining its shape. In the<br>
illustrated example, each cell 31 in the cell array<br>
structure 30 has a diameter of '35um and a length of<br>
120um, with the wall thickness of 3um.<br>
[Example 6] - Embodiment corresponding to eighteen<br>
aspect of the invention<br>
Next, the embodiment corresponding to the<br>
eighteenth aspect of the invention will be explained.<br>
The eighteen aspect of the invention<br>
corresponds to the construction shown in Figure 10 in<br>
which a flat slab structure 26 formed with a number<br>
of penetrating holes is contacted to the deformable<br>
material (B) on the substrate (A). Thereby, the<br>
penetrating holes are formed with a pitch smaller<br>
than the pitch of the cells in the cell array<br>
structure.<br>
It should be noted that such minute<br>
penetrating holes can be formed easily with a<br>
diameter of 0.lum or less by causing anode oxidation<br><br>
- 62 -<br>
in an aluminum plate of the thickness of 200um.<br>
Because the penetrating holes are formed with a pitch<br>
smaller than the pitch of the cells in the cell array<br>
structure, it becomes possible to cause dilatation in<br>
the deformable material (B) without damaging the<br>
shape of the individual cells 31 by contacting the<br>
slab structure 26 to the backside of the deformable<br>
material (B).<br>
[Example 7] - Embodiment corresponding to twentieth<br>
aspect of the invention<br>
Figure 11A schematically shows the problem<br>
that may arise when a deformable material (B) is<br>
applied to a surface of the substrate (A) formed with<br>
semispherical depressions 23.<br>
More specifically, Figure 11A shows the<br>
situation in which the gas in the depression 23 is<br>
dissolved into the deformable material (B) or escapes<br>
to the outside by passing through the deformable<br>
member (B) as shown at the left part of the drawing.<br>
Associated with such degassing, it can be seen in<br>
Figure 11A that the deformable material (B) invades<br>
into the depressions in some of the depressions 23.<br>
Figure 11B illustrates the Young-Laplace<br>
equation.<br><br>
- 63 -<br>
According to the Young-Laplace equation, a<br>
pressure difference AP between a gas pressure Pi and<br>
a liquid pressure PL is represented for a bubble of<br>
elliptical shape formed in a liquid as<br>
AP=Pi-PL = a( 1 /Ri+1 /R2) ,<br>
wherein Rl and R2 respectively represent the radius<br>
of the bubble measured along a minor axis thereof and<br>
the radius of the bubble measured along a major axis<br>
thereof.<br>
Thus, the foregoing equation represents<br>
that the pressure difference AP is increased when<br>
the radius Ri and the radius R2 are decreased. Here,<br>
a represents the surface tension of the liquid.<br>
Thus, when the diameter of the depression<br>
23 has become 30um or less, the pressure of the<br>
bubble is increased according to the Young-Laplace<br>
equation, resulting in absorption of the gas by the<br>
liquid. Alternatively, the gas escapes from the<br>
depression 23 to the outside by passing through the<br>
deformable material (B). In any of these cases, there<br>
arises the problem that the deformable material<br>
invades into the depression 23 as shown in Figure 11A.<br>
Thus, Example 7 reduces this problem by<br>
decreasing the area of the depression 23 opened at<br>
the surface of the substrate (A) as represented in<br><br>
- 64 -<br>
Figure 12A, in which it will be noted that there are<br>
formed a number of spherical voids in the substrate<br>
(A) such that each spherical void is exposed at the<br>
surface of the substrate (A) at an opening having a<br>
diameter much smaller than the diameter of the void<br>
itself.<br>
It should be noted that the structure of<br>
Figure 12A is obtained easily by the steps of:<br>
arraying polystyrene microspheres on the surface of<br>
the substrate (A); covering the microspheres by an<br>
UV-cure resin layer; and removing the polystyrene<br>
microspheres by an organic solvent such as acetone.<br>
Figure 12B shows another example of the<br>
substrate (A) in which there are formed a number of<br>
deep depressions 23b in the substrate (A). The<br>
structure of Figure 12B can be formed by<br>
photolithography.<br>
[Example 8] - Embodiment corresponding to twentieth<br>
aspect<br>
Figures 13A - 13D, 14A and 14B show the<br>
process of manufacturing an optical fiber array<br>
according to the twentieth aspect of the invention.<br>
With the twentieth aspect, there is formed<br>
a cell array structure 30 in which the cells have a<br><br>
- 65 -<br>
closed end at the side of the substrate (A) while the<br>
other, opposite end is opened.<br>
(1) The cell array structure 30 obtained<br>
with the process of Example 5 is turned over upside<br>
down as shown in Figure 13A, and a transparent core<br>
material 41 is injected to the cells therein in this<br>
state. In the illustrated example, an uncured UV-cure<br>
resin is used for the core material 41. More<br>
specifically, the illustrated example uses an acrylic<br>
UV-cure resin of the refractive index of 1.56 for the<br>
core material 41.<br>
In order to ensure positive injection of<br>
the more material 41 into the miniature cells 31<br>
without voids, the present embodiment uses a<br>
centrifugal separator 50 shown in Figures 14A, and<br>
the core material 41 is injected in the step of<br>
Figure 14B with a pressure of 3000G for the duration<br>
of 30 seconds by operating the centrifugal separator<br>
50.<br>
Thus, in the step of Figure 14A, the cell<br>
array structure 30 is mounted upon a rotary drum 51<br>
of the centrifugal separator 50 and the core material<br>
41 is poured upon the cell array structure 30.<br>
Next, in the step of Figure 14B, the drum<br>
51 is rotated at high speed and the core material 41<br><br>
- 66 -<br>
is pressed into the cells 3 by the centrifugal force<br>
acting upon the core material 41. Thereby, any air<br>
bubble 52 in the cell 41 is separated and the cells<br>
31 are fully loaded with the core material 41.<br>
(2)	Next, in the step of Figure 13B, the<br>
UV-cure resin forming the core material 41 is cured<br>
by irradiating UV light.<br>
(3)	Next, the cell array 30 of gelatin is<br>
replaced with other, preferably opaque material<br>
capable of performing optical shielding function, in<br>
view of the fact that gelatin forming the cell array<br>
30 has poor resistance to water and relatively high<br>
refractive index.<br>
Thus, the optical fiber array of Figure 13B<br>
is dipped into water for removal of the cell walls<br>
formed of gelatin in the step of Figure 13C, and with<br>
this, there are formed gaps 42 between the cores 41<br>
in correspondence to the gelatin cell walls.<br>
(4)	Further, in the step of Figure 13C, a<br>
cladding material 43 is injected into the gaps 42<br>
thus formed by using the centrifugal separator 50 of<br>
Figures 14A and 14B similarly to the case of the<br>
cores 41. In the illustrated example, a PMMA solution<br>
in which polymethacrylate (PMMA) having a refractive<br>
index of 1.49 dissolved into a volatile solvent and<br><br>
- 67 -<br>
added with carbon black with the amount of 0.5wt% is<br>
used.<br>
After the injection of the cladding<br>
material 43, the cladding structure 44 is formed<br>
after drying as shown in Figure 13D.<br>
(5) With the foregoing process, it is<br>
possible to manufacture a miniature optical fiber<br>
plate or optical fiber array 40 shown in Figure 13D<br>
or 15 with simple process and short time period, such<br>
that optical fibers 45 having a diameter of 35um and<br>
carrying a cladding layer of 3um thickness are<br>
arranged in the form of array of the height of 120um.<br>
It should be noted that the efficiency of<br>
utilization of light of such an optical fiber plate<br>
40 reaches as large as 22% in the case the distance<br>
to the optical source is set to 15um or less.<br>
[Example 9]<br>
While the substrate or "mold" used in the<br>
preceding embodiments have a flat top surface formed<br>
with the depressions, the present invention is not<br>
limited to such a flat substrate and it is also<br>
possible to use a cylindrical substrate 201 as shown<br>
in Figure 16A. In each of Figures 16A - 16C, it<br>
should be noted that the right drawing shows the<br><br>
- 68 -<br>
cylindrical substrate 201 and the components formed<br>
thereon in an oblique view while the left drawing<br>
shows the cross-section taken along a plane L.<br>
As represented in Figure 16A, the<br>
cylindrical substrate 201 is formed with a number of<br>
depressions 202 corresponding to the depressions 80a<br>
of Figure 2A, and a deformable material 203 is coated<br>
upon the cylindrical surface of the substrate 202 in<br>
correspondence to the deformable material 82 of<br>
Figure 2B. Thereby, there are formed isolated spaces<br>
on the surface of the cylindrical substrate 201 in<br>
correspondence to the depressions 202.<br>
Further, in the step of Figure 16C, the<br>
ambient pressure is decreased and there is caused<br>
dilatation in the gas filling the depressions 202,<br>
and there are formed elongated cells 203A in the<br>
deformable material 203 now forming a cell array<br>
structure, such that the cells 203A are aligned in<br>
the direction perpendicular to the cylindrical<br>
surface of the substrate.<br>
[Example 10]<br>
Figure 17 shows an electronic reusable<br>
paper 400 according to Example 10 of the present<br>
invention.<br><br>
- 69 -<br>
Referring to Figure 17, the electronic<br>
reusable paper 400 is includes a back plane 401<br>
formed of a substrate 401A carrying thereon an<br>
electrode layer 401B including various electrodes and<br>
active elements, and a front plane 402 is adhered<br>
upon the back plane 401 by an adhesive layer 403.<br>
The front plane 401 includes a transparent<br>
substrate 402A and a transparent electrode layer 402B<br>
formed thereon, wherein the transparent electrode<br>
layer 402B is adhered to a cell structure 402D<br>
including therein mutually isolated cells 402c in<br>
such a manner that the cells 402c are separated by<br>
cell walls 402d. The cells 402c are filled with an<br>
electrophoretic substance 402e and covered with a<br>
sealing layer 402E, wherein the transparent electrode<br>
layer 402B is adhered to a sealing .layer 402E by way<br>
of an adhesive layer 402C.<br>
Thus, by applying a voltage across the<br>
electrode pattern in the electrode layer 401B of the<br>
backplane 401 and the transparent electrode layer<br>
402B of the front plane 402, there is caused<br>
electrophoretic migration in the electrophoretic<br>
substance 402c filling the cells 402c, and images are<br>
displayed by the electrophoretic migration thus<br>
inducted.<br><br>
- 70 -<br>
In an example, the cell structure 402D has<br>
a thickness t of 50um, and each cell 402c may have a<br>
width W of 150um. Further, the cell wall 402d may<br>
have a thickness of 8um or less.<br>
Figures 18A - 18G show the•fabrication<br>
process of the electronic reusable paper 400 of<br>
Figure 18.<br>
Referring to Figure 18A, a mold 501 of a<br>
silicone rubber is provided such that the mold 501 is<br>
formed with depressions 501A in a staggered pattern,<br>
similarly to the step of Figure 2A, except that the<br>
depressions 501A are formed in a cylindrical pit<br>
having a diameter of lOOum and with a pitch of 150um.<br>
Further, a UV-cure acrylic resin admixed<br>
with carbon black particles with a concentration of<br>
0.5wt% is applied to the substrate 501 by a coating<br>
process to form a deformable layer 502 in the step of<br>
Figure 18A, and in the step of Figure 18B, the<br>
ambient behind the deformable layer 502 is evacuated<br>
to the pressure of 0.03MPa to cause expansion of the<br>
gas filling the spaces 501A.<br>
After curing the deformable material 502 by<br>
UV irradiation, the substrate 501 is removed, and the<br>
cell structure 402D of the structure of Figure 17 is<br>
obtained by the cured material 502 such that the<br><br>
- 71 -<br>
cells 402c are formed in the cell structure 402D in<br>
the form isolated with each other by the cell walls<br>
402d. The cell structure thus formed has an A5 size<br>
(148mm&gt;
cell pitch A of 150um, and the cell wall thickness d<br>
of 8um.<br>
Next, in the step of Figure 18D, the cells<br>
402c are filled with an electrophoretic substance,<br>
typically formed of titanium oxide particles, carbon<br>
black particles and isoparaffin, and in the step of<br>
Figure 18E, the seal layer 402E of a urethane resin<br>
is provided so as to cover the opened cells 402c such<br>
that there remains no air bubbles.<br>
Next, in the step of Figure 18F, the<br>
adhesive layer 402 is applied to the seal layer 402E,<br>
and in the step of Figure 18E, the transparent<br>
substrate 402A carrying thereon the transparent<br>
electrode 402B of ITO, or the like, is adhered to the<br>
adhesive layer 402C in the upside down state.<br>
Further, in the step of Figure 18G, the<br>
structure of Figure 18E is adhered to the backplane<br>
401 via the adhesive layer 403, and the electronic<br>
reusable paper 400 of Figure 17 is obtained.<br>
Further, the present invention is by no<br><br>
- 72 -<br>
means limited to the embodiments described heretofore,<br>
but various variations and modifications may be made<br>
without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
