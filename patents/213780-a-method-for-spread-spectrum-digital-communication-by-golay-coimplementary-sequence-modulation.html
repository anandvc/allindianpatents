				<td>A METHOD FOR SPREAD- SPECTRUM DIGITAL COMMUNICATION<br>
BY GOLAY COMPLEMENTARY SEQUENCE MODULATION<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
FIELD OF THE ART<br>
The present invention refers to the modulation and<br>
demodulation merhod as well as the transmitter and receiver<br>
which makes it possible to transmit and receive data by means<br>
of any transmission means, particularly when it is necessary<br>
or preferable to use spread spectrum techniques.<br>
STATE OF THE ART<br>
The spread spectrum concept was developed for use in military<br>
communications due to its immunity features towards noise and<br>
interference. Its principle is based on the use of certain<br>
binary sequences having certain features similar to noise and<br>
which, however, a receiver which knows said sequence is<br>
capable to detect as a signal. In the same manner the<br>
compression of impulses by means of binary sequences is useful<br>
also in RADAR, SONAR and echograph applications since it<br>
allows better resolution of the detected objects. However, in<br>
recent years its use has become widespread in space<br>
applications and civil communications such as mobile<br>
telephony, DS-CDMA (Direct Sequence Code-Division Multiple-<br>
Access), radio telephone access loops, Internet access,<br>
wireless local area networks, deep space communications, etc.<br>
All of which are based on digital modulation by means of using<br>
of sequences which are suitable for this type of applications<br>
due to their auto-correlation and cross-correlation features<br>
are suitable for this kind of applications. Therefore,<br>
international organisations (IEEE, UIT, etc.), have begun<br>
norrralising and standardising modulation systems v/hich<br>
facilitates the use of certain sequences to modulate the<br>
transmitted binary data and thus obtain characteristics which<br>
makes it possible to use, among others, certain frequencies<br>
reserved for industrial, scientific and medical applications<br>
(ISM bands) and whose use and exploitation do not require any<br>
kind of administrative license. The need to send as much<br>
information as possible with the same bandwidth has made the<br>
telecommunications industry to develop commercial applications<br>
which use the IEEE 802.11 standard for the transmission of<br>
information by radio in local networks obtaining increasingly<br>
higher speeds by means of the use of binary sequences such as<br>
the 11-bit Barker (to obtain a minimum processing gain of 10.4<br>
dB) or 5-bit Walsh, and dif ferent modulation techniques (BPSK,<br>
QPSK, MBOK, QMBOK, etc.) which makes it possible to attain<br>
transmission speeds of up to 11 Mbps. This standard makes it<br>
possible to work within three frequency bands with a null-to-<br>
null bandwidth of 22 MHz, in the so-called 2.4GHz band.<br>
Likewise, reliable transmission methods are needed for the so-<br>
called deep space communications between spaceships and the<br>
bases on Earth, allowing a big processing gain due to the need<br>
to limit the emission power of the ship"s transmission<br>
equipment, and due to the reduced signal to noise ratio of<br>
said signals when they are received.<br>
In the present applications (Figure 1) the length of the<br>
coding sequence (Barker, PN, Walsh, etc.,....) determines both<br>
the processing gain and the bandwidth used. Generally, the<br>
transmission speed will be reduced if we attempt to increase<br>
the processing gain, which is why a compromise between the two<br>
parameters must always be found. The transmission speed may be<br>
increased by increasing the number of modulation phases,<br>
however, the restrictions of this technique increase with the<br>
decrease in the signal to noise ratio during reception.<br>
Based on the above it can be deduced that there is a need for<br>
a spread spectrum digital modulation technique which on the<br>
one hand makes it possible to increase transmission speed and<br>
on the other to obtain a bigger processing gain to make it<br>
possible to reduce the needed transmission power or improve<br>
the signal to noise ratio during reception, and at the same<br>
time to reduce the complexity of the present modulation<br>
tables.<br>
No patent or utility model whatsoever is known whose features<br>
are the object of the present invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention uses pairs of Golay complementary<br>
sequences for the modulation by means of spread spectrum and<br>
DS-CDMA of the amplitude modulated binary data in combination<br>
with an N-PSK modulation widely used in digital communication<br>
systems.<br>
The main property of the sequences used in this invention is<br>
that in contrast to the Barker sequences, which have side<br>
lobes, the Golay sequences are characterised by an ideal auto-<br>
correlation, that is, they correspond to a perfect Kronecker<br>
delta so that they meet:<br>
 2M, n=0<br>
CA[n]+ CA[n] = { 0, n?O<br>
where CA and Cn are the individual autocorrelations of the A<br>
and B sequences of the pair of selected Golay complementary<br>
sequences, M length; and whose values belong to the bi-valued<br>
set (1,-1) .<br>
The generation of such sequences is based on the so-called<br>
kernel basics of 2, 10 and 26 bits, known hitherto (the rules<br>
of Golay sequence generation are discussed in the article<br>
called "Complementary Sequences" by M.J.E. Golay, published in<br>
IRE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. IT-7, pp. 82-87,<br>
April 1961).<br>
The communication system object of the present invention makes<br>
it possible to establish a physical end-to-end or end-to-<br>
multi-point connection at a transmission rate, which will<br>
depend on the employed means and on the available bandwidth<br>
and on the acceptable error rate.<br>
It consists of two pieces of equipment or devices: One is a<br>
transmitter and the other one is a receiver.<br>
The transmitter equipment is used to perform the following<br>
tasks:<br>
â¢ Receive the data and generate the symbols corresponding<br>
to each group of (m) bits as a function of the Golay<br>
sequence number (n) of the selected length (M) , number<br>
of amplitudes (A) per symbol, number of phases (N) used<br>
for the modulation and processing gain needed to comply<br>
with the quality requirements of the system.<br>
â¢ Carry out the adding up of the different phases to form<br>
an N-PSK modulation and thus generating the transmission<br>
signal.<br>
â¢ Transmit the composite signal to the transmitter means,<br>
for example by means of an RF stage and antenna.<br>
The receiver equipment is used to perform the following<br>
operations:<br>
â¢ Demodulate the N-PSK information and extract the<br>
components of each of the different phases.<br>
â¢ Adapt, filter and correlate the extracted components<br>
with their corresponding complementary pairs or Golay.<br>
â¢ Sum up the correlations and thus obtain the original<br>
data stream as digital levels.<br>
â¢ Perform the level decoding to obtain the original data.<br>
The first advantage of this method is being able to obtain as<br>
biq a processing gain as one wishes, independently from the<br>
transmission rate, as will be seen later, and only by<br>
increasing the length of the selected Golay sequences, for<br>
which reason high transmissin power is not needed to obtain a<br>
high signal to noise ration during reception. The processing<br>
gain (in decibel) in this case is defined as:<br>
GP = 10 log10 (2M) dB. (1.1)<br>
where M corresponds to the length of the Golay sequences used<br>
in the modulation. This feature is very important in<br>
applications where a low transmission power is<br>
desired(portable terminals, space ships and communication<br>
satellites), the communication is performed over great<br>
distances (deep space transmissions), and even military<br>
applications in which the interference caused by the enemy or<br>
the need to encrypt the transmission determine the security<br>
and quality of the communication.<br>
Furthermore, this method makes it possible to transmit<br>
simultaneous information flows in the same frequency bands<br>
over the channel by means of using n different low cross-<br>
correlation Golay sequences, thus facilitating the creation of<br>
n communication sub-net works within a same band, or to<br>
multiply the transmission rate by a factor proportional to rj.<br>
Likewise, it is possible to increase the transmission rate<br>
even more if a prior amplitude modulation of the entry data by<br>
means of A amplitudes is performed.<br>
Therefore, from the aforementioned it can be deduced that the<br>
transmission speed, or capacity (C), that can be obtained in a<br>
spread spectrum communication system using this method will<br>
be:<br>
C= n â¢ log2A â¢ (1/2) â¢ log2N â¢ (B/2) n bits/sec. (1.2)<br>
where B (Hertz) is the null-to-null bandwidth used, N is the<br>
number of phases used in the modulation (power of 4), A is the<br>
number of amplitudes used in the binary data encoding and rj is<br>
the number of pairs of Golay complementary sequences used. In<br>
the previous expression it is observed that C is independent<br>
of M.<br>
Therefore, the described invention constitutes a powerful<br>
communication system for use in spread spectrum applications,<br>
DS-CDMA, hostile environments, when restrictions on the<br>
transmission power exists, or simply when there is a wish to<br>
improve the quality of the communication without a<br>
transmission rate degradation.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows the present basic transmission technique of a<br>
spread spectrum system and particularly using an 11-bit Barker<br>
sequence, which by means of an exclusive OR function performs<br>
the spreading of the spectrum of the original data signal. It<br>
is seen that the bit frequency is 11 times lower to the one<br>
used for the Barker sequence, which makes it possible to<br>
obtain a processing gain of 10 â¢ loglO (11) Ë 10.4 dB.<br>
Figure 2 shows the basic outline of the transmission method<br>
and a possible implementation of the transmitter which uses<br>
this method for N=4. The binary data (1) enter the emitter in<br>
groups of nxm bits. Each i group of m bits multiply with sign<br>
(3) by both Golay sequences A and B (2) corresponding to the<br>
BMB i number. The result of both multipliers independently<br>
accumulates in each of the phases, and in each element, within<br>
the displacement register (4) and moves towards the right to<br>
wait for the next symbol.<br>
The output values of the shift register of each BMB are summed<br>
(5) and the result is phase and quadrature modulated by means<br>
of the product with, for example, a sine and cosine symbol<br>
(6). The result is sent to a conventional transmission stage<br>
(7).<br>
Figure 3 shows a basic outline of the reception method and<br>
particularly an example of a receiver using this method for N<br>
= 4. Both phases are reduced by a 4-PSK demodulation obtaining<br>
one in-phase signal and another in quadrature (1). The<br>
obtained analogue in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) signals are<br>
quantified and introduced into all the BDBs, and the result of<br>
both is correlated with the corresponding original sequences<br>
(2), the sum (3) of both flows will provide us with an<br>
amplitude coded signal corresponding to the data of each<br>
subgroup of m original bits which are demodulated. A<br>
multiplexer block (4) manages the decoding and arrangement of<br>
the bits to recover the original data flow.<br>
Figure 4 corresponds to a possible embodiment of the<br>
modulation. For the sake of simplification only the embodiment<br>
of phase 1 is shown. Phase Q is identical but modulating with<br>
the complementary sequence. Therefore, only one of the Golay<br>
registers (1), one of the accumulators and shift registers (2)<br>
and one multiplier (3) is shown.<br>
PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A possible embodiment of this method applied to a end-to-end<br>
open-air radio communication system is shown below. For<br>
reasons of clarity the implementation in the case of a QPSK<br>
transmitter (N=4) is outlined in figure 2, performing data<br>
modulation using n Golay sequences, amplitude modulated by<br>
means of A amplitudes. Therefore, by applying the formula<br>
(1.2), the transmission rate will be:<br>
C= n â¢ log2A â¢ (B/2) bits/sec. (1.3)<br>
In accordance with what has been explained above, the starting<br>
point is a set of n pairs of Golay sequences of M bits<br>
generated and stored in the transmitter by means of,<br>
generally, 2xg binary registers (values 1 and -1) which we aim<br>
to amplitude modulate with A amplitudes and with 4 Q PSK<br>
phases (4-PSK) . In the same figure 2 one of the basic<br>
modulator blocks (BMB) of which the transmitter consists is<br>
shown in detail.<br>
The transmitter performs the following operations where R is<br>
the transmission rate in symbols:<br>
(1) Encoder (a. 2) : The NRZ digital data received at nxmxR<br>
bits/sec. arrive encoded and are grouped in n groups of<br>
m=log2A bits. Each BMB processes in parallel a group of m<br>
bits, so that the system will transmit nxm bits per symbol.<br>
The bit with the highest weight of each group corresponds to<br>
the sign, and the m-1 of less weight, to the module.<br>
(2)Golay register(a.3): Formed by two binary registers of M<br>
length which store the pair of A and B complementary sequences<br>
whose values belong to the set (1, -1), which will modulate<br>
the data processed by the corresponding BMB.<br>
(3)Multiplier (a. 4): Consists of two multipliers with sign<br>
(highest weight bit) of the pair of A and B Golay sequences of<br>
the BMB with the arithmetic value of the corresponding group<br>
within the set of groups of the input symbol.<br>
(4)Double accumulator (a.5) and Shift register (a. 6): Perform the<br>
arithmetic summing of the result of the multipliers with the<br>
content of the double shift register (the upper path with A<br>
and the inner path with B) and shifts a register to the right<br>
for each symbol cycle, updating the register, located furthest<br>
to the left of the same, to the value of zero. The shift<br>
register is formed by basic elements which store signal<br>
values, and therefore, the number (n) of bits used in each<br>
basic element of said register, must be dimensioned to avoid<br>
overflow during the accumulation operations. Thus, the number<br>
of elements in the shift register must be equal to or higher<br>
than M for each of the paths A and B.<br>
(5) Adder(a. 7): Independently sums up the data corresponding<br>
to the output of each shift register of each of the BMBs thus<br>
obtaining the total IT and QT signals which are afterwards<br>
modulated.<br>
(6) QPSK modulator(a.8): Modulates the output signals from<br>
the adder by multiplying the exit signals of the adders by two<br>
quadrature symbols, for example, a sinusoidal symbol with<br>
phase o (via IT) and another quadrature 0 - n/2 (via Qr) , and<br>
adding the result of both phases, thus obtaining the<br>
transmission signal in QPSK.<br>
(7) Exit stage (a. 9) :Consists of a D/A converter stage (a. 9 .1) and a<br>
conventional radio frequency stage(a.9.2), for example, sending the<br>
signal to the transmission means.<br>
Figure 3 shows an example outline of a receiver for N=4,<br>
which is formed by ? basic demodulator blocks (BDB) detailed<br>
in the same figure, and the structure of the receiver which<br>
consists of the following blocks:<br>
{1) QPSK receiver (b. 1) :Amplifies the RF input signal and if<br>
necessary converts the signal to an intermediate frequency<br>
(IF), obtains the phase information and makes it possible to<br>
demodulate (b.2)and recover the different flows in-phase I and<br>
quadrature Q corresponding to the phases 0 and 0 - n/2. The I<br>
and Q signals are digitised and their output passed on to the<br>
correlator blocks. This block is common for all the BDBs.<br>
(2) Golay correlators (b.3): Makes it possible to correlate<br>
the different flows received with their corresponding Golay<br>
sequences. Given that the sequences are normalised between +1<br>
and -1, the correlation is reduced to performing adding and<br>
subtraction.<br>
(3) Adder and detector(b. 4): Performs the adding up of the<br>
correlations, two and two, so that the result are the original<br>
amplitude modulated data. These are thresholded and converted<br>
into binary data generated at the symbol rate at the output of<br>
each block.<br>
(4) Decoder (b.5) : Performs the grouping of the ? groups<br>
received within the data stream, corresponding to the<br>
transmitted data in the order in which they were transmitted<br>
at ?xmxR bits/sec.<br>
Both devices together make up the transmission system.<br>

elements of the products of each of the phases obtained in the previous<br>
stage.<br>
- displacement of the said registers in a basic element towards the M<br>
element of said registers - output - adding the value zero in the basic<br>
elements of first order of the double register.<br>
- providing the sum of the ? values obtained at the output of the I and Q<br>
phases of each one of the BMBs independently in order to obtain the total<br>
It and Qt phases.<br>
- modulation of both lT and QT phases by means of quadrature<br>
symbols and the sum of both to obtain the transmission signal.<br>
- transmitting the obtained signal to a transmission stage.<br>
11. A method as claimed in claim 10, wherein demodulation is caused to occur on the<br>
basis of an N-PSK reception, coherent or non-coherent, which extracts the specific phases<br>
and performs the correlation with the corresponding ? sequences per phase, adding them<br>
and obtaining the binary data flow transmitted at origin by means of amplitude detection.<br>
12. A method as claimed in claim 10, which involves the steps of:<br>
- adapting and synchronising the signal received and demodulating the<br>
quadrature phases which make up the said signal and inserting all these<br>
into each one of the ? basic demodulator blocks (BDB);<br>
- filtration by means of correlation, convolution or filter adapted to the<br>
? pairs of Golay complementary sequences of the various recovered<br>
phases, the ? sums of the results of every two correlations corresponding<br>
to the same pair of Golay complementary sequence to obtain an<br>
information stream, modulated in amplitude with A amplitudes ;<br>
demodulating the ? modulated flows in amplitude to obtain r| groups of<br>
m = log2A bits ; and<br>
- multiplexing said groups to form the original data flow.<br>
The frequency spectrum of a transmission system is spread in the transmitter (1)<br>
by information bit encoding by means of Golay complementary sequence pairs. The<br>
spectrum is picked up in the receiver (2) and passed through a filter that is adapted to the<br>
characteristics of said frequencies enabling detection of digital levels corresponding to the<br>
transmitted original information. If ? pairs of orthogonal sequences, A amplitudes for<br>
data modulation and N- PSK modulation are used, it is possible to obtain transmission<br>
speed (C) which equals formula (I), wherein B is the null-to-null bandwidth used in<br>
Hertz. This makes it possible to improve quality in comparison with other digital<br>
communication systems using spread-spectrum techniques and CDMA. A process gain<br>
independent of transmission speed is obtained.</td>
