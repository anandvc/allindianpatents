				<td>Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates a novel intrauterine device comprising a polymeric matrix<br>
embedded with microspheres for releasing therapeutically active agents at a controlled<br>
rate for a prolonged period of time wherein said polymeric matrix and microspheres<br>
consist essentially of contraceptive hormones.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Contraceptive methods involving the administration of hormone substances are widely<br>
practiced among women who desire to limit pregnancies. Such methods control fertility<br>
through various biological mechanisms. Among the presently used hormonal methods of ,<br>
fertility control, the most important are those which act by means of the following: (a)<br>
suppression of ovulation through inhibition of gonadotropin release; (b) alteration of the<br>
female reproductive tract to prevent migration of sperm to the site of fertilization or, if<br>
fertilization occurs, to block implantation of the zygote (nidation); or (c) spermicidal<br>
action.<br>
The oral contraceptives are the most prominent hormonal contraceptive agents. These<br>
agents are of two types: (a) an estrogen combined with a progestin, and (b) a progestin<br>
alone. The contraceptives of the combined type act primarily by suppressing ovulation by<br>
negative feedback to prevent gonadotropin (LH and FSH) release by the hypothalamus,<br>
but alterations in the reproductive tract may also contribute to the antifertility effect. Such<br>
alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm<br>
migration) and in the endometrium (which decrease the likelihood of nidation). The<br>
action of a progestin alone in a very low oral dose (the "mini-pill") appears to involve<br>
primarily alterations in the female reproductive tract, but ovulation suppression may also<br>
occur. Although the oral contraceptives are highly effective, their use is associated with<br>
unpleasant side effects (such as nausea, depression, weight-gain, and headache) and an<br>
increased long-time risk of severe disease (such as thromboembolism, stroke, myocardial<br>
infarction, hepatic adenoma, gall bladder disease, and hypertension). Bleeding<br>
2<br>
irregularities (such as break-through bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea) are also<br>
frequent. A progestin, when administered alone, causes an increased incidence of changes<br>
in menstrual patterns, especially a marked increase in the amount and duration of<br>
menstrual bleeding.<br>
Besides the oral route of administration a progestin alone may be administered<br>
systemically by various sustained-release dosage forms which include: (a) depo injection<br>
(IM) of an insoluble progestin (e.g medroxy progesterone acetate), 9b) a subdrmal<br>
implant, or (c) an intravaginal insert With these methods of administration, the progestin<br>
is absorbed into the body continuously at a very low daily dose, and the systemic effects<br>
are similar to those produced by oral administration of a progestin. However, as with the<br>
oral progestins, the sustained release methods may cause serious menstrual flow<br>
irregularities.<br>
Other hormonal methods of contraception include the post coital administration of<br>
estrogens (e.g. diethylstilbestrol or ethinylestradiol) to prevent nidation or of<br>
prostaglandins which act as abortifacients. Both of these methods, at present, are limited<br>
to emergency situations. Still in the very early stages of development are immunological<br>
methods (vaccination) and methods involving the direct control of LHRH secretion from<br>
the pituitary by LHRH agonists or antagonists.<br>
The intrauterine device (IUD) is the most common alternative to the oral contraceptives.<br>
The anti-fertility effect of the IUD is not caused by chemical activity. Instead the material<br>
forming the IUD induces a foreign body reaction (irritation) in the contiguous<br>
endomentrium which appears to interfere in some way with nidation. The use of the IUD<br>
is complicated, however, by serious problems including the possibility of intrauterine<br>
perforation, pelvic inflammation, discomfort, or aggravated menstrual periods.<br>
A recent development is the flexible IUD bearing metallic copper. The contraceptive<br>
action of this device results from the combined effects of the copper (which very slowly<br>
dissolves in the uterine fluids), which acts on the blastocyst and on the cervical mucus or<br>
3<br>
endometrium, and of theIUD itself, which causes a foreign body reaction in the<br>
endomentrium.<br>
Another recent method of contraception involves the sustained release of progesterone<br>
locally within the uterine lumen. In this method the progesterone is incorporated into a<br>
chamber within a flexible intra-uterine device (IUD) formed from a polymer which is<br>
capable of releasing progesterone continuously into the uterine fluids at a slow rate over a<br>
prolonged period of time. The progesterone acts primarily locally to produce<br>
progestational alterations in the cervical mucus and endometrium. However, the<br>
antifertility action may also be caused by the reaction of the endometrium to the device<br>
itself ("IUD effect") or by systemic absorption of progesterone through the uterine<br>
membrane.<br>
Medicated IUDs as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,341,728 is useful but have several<br>
drawbacks. An IUD is designed to be inserted into the woman"s uterus which makes<br>
positioning of the IUD important and requires insertion and removal by a qualified health<br>
professional.<br>
Medicated intracervical devices (ICDs) which are introduced into the cervical canal just<br>
beyond the cervical os in order to prevent pregnancy are also known and have also been<br>
used to release contraceptive hormones". Medicated ICDs can be useful for the inhibition<br>
of fertility but are also useful in treating and medicating other conditions of the female<br>
reproductive system.<br>
The patent U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,557 presents a delivery system for controlled delivery of<br>
an active substance comprising a hollow space enclosed by a wall and filled with said<br>
active substance. The wall is made of a biodegradable polymer and only one example of<br>
the filling is given, namely dispersion of an active substance in castor oil. This system<br>
does thus not disclose a core made of an elastomer. The system is further coated with<br>
non-permeable biodegradable polymer and the rate of diffusion of the active substance is<br>
controlled by the surface of the wall not covered by said non-permeable polymer. A<br>
El Mahgoub, S., Contraception, 1982, Vol., 25, No. 4, p. 357-374.<br>
problem that could occur with this kind of system is that if the wall is broken, the active<br>
substance is released in a non-controlled manner. Such release could lead to serious<br>
problems due to the side effects of the active substances or an intoxication by the active<br>
substances.<br>
From the foregoing, it is evident that the presently available methods of contraception are<br>
inadequate for various reasons because they: (a) may produce unpleasant side effects or<br>
increase the risk of serious disease, (b) may be unreliable, or (c) may be inconvenient and<br>
intrude on sexual enjoyment. Although many women practice contraception in spite of<br>
these inadequacies, a need exists in medicine for improved methods which combine<br>
effectiveness with increased safety and convenience.<br>
Further there has been a consistently large demand for the development of new, long-<br>
acting contraceptives that require minimal medical guidance. This is particularly the case<br>
in less developed countries where medical and family planning organizations are<br>
inadequate. Such improvements are afforded by the present invention.<br>

The polymeric matrix and the membrane encasing said polymeric matrix are thus<br>
essentially made of same or different elastomer composition that is described further<br>
below. In this application, the term "elastomer composition" may stand for one single<br>
elastomer, or the elastomer composition may be made up of two elastomers that are<br>
interlaced, one inside the other.<br>
Particularly, elastomer used is ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer. The ethylene-vinyl<br>
acetate copolymer can be any commercially available ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer,<br>

system is for example an intrauterine system, it may further comprise a body forming the<br>
structure of the system. In this case, the microsphere-embedded polymeric matrix-<br>
membrane-structure of the system is hollow so that it can be positioned over the body of<br>
the system. The body may have the form of T, S or 7.<br>

The invention is described below in greater detail by the following, non-limiting<br>
drawings and examples.<br>
12<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
I Preparation of Levonorgestrel containing microspheres:<br>
Microspheres were prepared by solvent evaporation technique. Ethyl cellulose was<br>
dissolved in methylene chloride to form a homogeneous polymer solution having a<br>
concentration of approximately 16%. To this known quantity (25mg) of Levonorgestrel<br>
was added and mixed thoroughly using vortex mixer for l0minutes, to completely mix<br>
with the polymer solution.<br>
The resultant polymer solution containing levonorgestrel was emulsified in 0.1% aqueous<br>
solution of poly vinyl alcohol, under stirring at 300 rpm using vortex mixer to form<br>
microspheres. The stirring was continued until the evaporation of methylene chloride<br>
complete. The microspheres were filtered using whatman paper washed 3 times with cold<br>
water and air-dried overnight at room temperature.<br>
The entrapment efficiency of the formulation was determined by solvent-extraction<br>
technique. l0mg of levonorgestrel loaded microspheres were dissolved in 10ml of<br>
methanol. After complete solubilization the samples were analyzed for Levonorgestrel in<br>
the UV Spectrophotometer, The microspheres prepared were sieved to separate lmm<br>
sized microspheres for further usage.<br>
II Preparation of Levonorgestrel containing polymeric matrix:<br>
Ethylene vinyl acetate (Elvax® 40w) was dissolved in methylene chloride to give 10%<br>
solution (w/v). To this polymeric solution accurately weighed quantity of Levonorgestrel<br>
13<br>
was added and mixed thoroughly. The polymer/levonorgestrel mixture was poured into<br>
the glass mold, which is previously cooled by placing it on dry ice for 5 minutes. After<br>
pouring, the mold remained dry ice for 10-15 minutes, to freeze the mixture.<br>
The frozen slab was pried loose with a cold spatula, transferred onto a wire screen (steel<br>
mesh) and kept at -20°C for 2 days in a freezer. The slabs were further dried for 2 more<br>
days at room temperature in a desiccator kept under a mild, house-line vacuum.<br>
The drug content of the prepared polymeric slabs were determined by solvent extraction<br>
technique. 100mg of levonorgestrel loaded polymeric slab was dissolved in 10 ml<br>
methylene chloride. After complete solubilization the samples were analyzed for<br>
levonorgestrel contents in the UV Spectrophotometer.<br>
III Preparation of novel intrauterine device:<br>
The intrauterine devices were prepared in the size of 2mm diameter X 20mm length<br>
according to the uterine dimension of rats.<br>
The levonorgestrel containing polymeric matrix prepared in step II were placed over the<br>
stainless mold (internal diameter size 2mm and length 20mm), which was preheated to<br>
40 C. Calculated quantity of microspheres were carefully placed between the polymeric<br>
sheets in the mold. The mold was compressed in mild heat (40°C) and held in oven for 10<br>
minutes at 40°C.<br>
The mold was then cooled and the cylindrical shaped, microspheres embedded<br>
intrauterine device was removed. The total levonorgestrel content in a single device was<br>
limited to 500mg, where the levonorgestrel was distributed equally in a weight ratio of<br>
50:50 between the " -microspheres and polymeric matrix system. Intrauterine devices<br>
devoid of microspheres with the same quantity of levonorgestrel were also prepared for<br>
comparative study.<br>
14<br>
Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of novel intrauterine device containing microspheres;<br>
Fig. 2 shows the schematic diagram of plain intrauterine device.<br>
IV In-vitro drug release study:<br>
The intrauterine device prepared in step III were placed in a test tube containing 10ml of<br>
10% methanolic phosphate buffer saline (Phosphate buffer saline pH 7.4 containing 10%<br>
methanol). The tubes were incubated at 37+l°C and shaken at 70±5 rpm.<br>
At designated times, the device was removed and transferred to the fresh buffer. The<br>
solution was measured for levonorgestrel content and the whole medium was changed<br>
after each sampling.<br>
In-vitro results<br>
About 94% of drug release was seen up to 143 days (Fig. 3) in plain device (device<br>
without microspheres), whereas microspheres embedded device released 91% of drug in<br>
more controlled manner upto 297 days (Fig. 4).<br>
In vivo studies<br>
Cyclic female adult Sprague Dawley rats were selected in the proestrus stage. Animals<br>
were anaesthetized under ether and the entire surgical area was wiped with disinfectant.<br>
A small incision was made in the dorsolateral side and the uterus was exposed. A small<br>
stab wound was made in the antimesometrial wall (near the cervix), through which the<br>
polymeric device (size 2mm diameter and 20mm length) was inserted. Care was taken<br>
throughout the procedure to avoid excess bleeding. The uterine horn was closed with a<br>
single stitch of 6-0 silk suture. The skin was closed with cotton suture. After allowing 2<br>
weeks of rest period the animals were checked for their cyclicity.<br>
15<br>
The animals in proestrus stage were allowed to mate with males of proven fertility. On<br>
day 3 of pregnancy, the animals were sacrificed and their fallopian tubes were flushed out<br>
with phosphate buffer saline and checked for fertilized ova.<br>
Results expressed as mean ± S.E.M. of data from 10 animals.<br>
While there has \been shown and described what are the preferred emboliments of the<br>
invention, one skilled in the pharmaceutical formulation art will appreciate that various<br>
