1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising liposomes and methods of using such liposomes to prevent, treat, or manage a variety of diseases and/or bodily conditions. The liposomes may comprise large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) alone or in combination with multilamellar vesicles (MLVs), small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), or other therapeutics. The invention relates to liposomes having certain diameters administered to patients using specific doses and/or dosing regimens.<br>
2.	Background of the Invention<br>
[0003]- Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death in the United States. Atherosclerosis is the formation of plaques in arterial walls that can occlude the vessel lumen and obstmct blood flow through the vessel. The plaques can also rupture and lead to thrombus formation even in a blood vessel without a criticai stenosis and can lead to occlusion of blood vessels and the obstmction of blood flow. Morbidity and mortality generally occur through end organ damage and organ dysfunction resulting from ischemia. The most comtnon forms of ischemic end organ damage are myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents. Disabihty or death often result from these vascular events. Even atherosclerosis-related ischemia that does not permanently injure myocardium or leads to minor myocardial damage is responsible for significant morbidity in the form of angina pectoris and congestive heart failure. Other organs, such as the kidneys, the intestines, and the spinal cord, may also be injured by atherosclerotic occlusions. Further, in diseases such as aortic aneurysms, atherosclerotic arteries may cause clinical symptoms independent of end organ dysfunction. Arteriosclerotic lesions are plaques that form by accumulation of cholesterol, cholesterol esters, and phospholipids, proliferation of smooth muscle cells, the diapedesis of monocytes including their transformation into macrophages and foam cells in the intima of major arteries. Lipid contributes a major portion of the plaque volmne (generally 30-65% dry weight). Small, .ARTERIOSCLEROSIS, 8:103-129 (19SS). in fact, the risk of developing arteriosclerosis is directly related to the concentration of certain forms of plasma cholesterol.<br><br>
 Other diseases and conditions associated with abnormally high Hpid levels include acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, unstable angina, inflammation, vascular inflammation, derma] inflammation, coronary heart disease (CHD), ventricular arrythmias, peripheral vascular disease, peripheral occlusive disease, inteimittent claudication, transient ischemic attacks, restenosis, decreased need for revascularization, coagulation disorders, ischemia, cardiovascular ischemia, ischemia unrelated to cardiovascular disease such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, thrombocytopenia, pancreatitis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy, painful diabetic neuropathy, claudication, psoriasis, critical limb ischemia, impotence, hyperlipidemia, hyperlipoproteinemia, hypoalphalipoproteinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, any stenotic condition leading to ischemic pathology, diabetes, ichtyosis, stroke, vulnerable plaques, lower-limb ulceration, severe coronary ischemia, lymphomas, cataracts, endotheUal dysfunction, xanthomas, vascular disease, vascular disease that results from smoking and diabetes, carotid and coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, regress and shrink established plaques, Alzheimer's Disease, combinations of surgical procedures that result in endothelial injury, endothelial damage as a result of surgical procedures, morbidity associated with vascular disease, ulcerations in the arterial lumen, restenosis as a result of balloon angioplasty, and subindications of the foregoing.  Lipids, including cholesterol, are generally insoluble in aqueous plasma. Plasma lipids are carried by soluble lipoprotein complexes. These lipoprotein complexes consist of an inner core of non-polar lipids (cholesteryl esters and triglycerides) and a surface layer of amphipathic proteins and polar lipids (phospholipids and non-esterified cholesterol). Different proteins (apolipoproteins) are present in the surface coat of different Upoprotein complexes (lipoproteins). The different lipoproteins perform different functions in lipid metabolism.<br>
-Five classes of lipoproteins are known. Some lipoproteins carry triglycerides and cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues while others transport lipids to the liver. Cholesterol may be metabolized in the liver to bile salts that are excreted, thus lowering total body cholesterol. Two lipoproteins, low density lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL), have a high degree of association with the development of atherosclerosis. LDL has a high cholesterol concentration, delivers lipids to cells of peripheral tissues, and is associated with a high risk of atherosclerosis. HDL also has a relatively high cholesterol concentration, but carries lipids to the liver for metabolism into bile salts and is associated with decreasing the risk of developing atherosclerosis.<br><br>
 Cholesterol metabolism and homeostasis is the result of a complex eqmlibnum between free sterol in the cell and in plasma. Phillips et al., BiocHiM. BiOPH\'S, ACTA, 906:223-276 (1987). Delivery of cholesterol to cells occurs via the receptor-mediated LDL pathway, selective uptake through scavenger receptor B-I, and by passive exchange of sterol between plasma membranes and lipoproteins. Only tissues that produce steroid hormones and bile acids can metabolize cholesterol. In order to prevent accumulation of excess free sterol in remaining peripheral tissues there is a reverse transport of cholesterol from plasma membranes into HDL and lipoprotein-like particles. HDL transports excess cholesterol to the liver where it can either be exported in the bile as unesterified cholesterol, processed into bile salts for excretion, esterified and stored in the liver, or incorporated into very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) to re-enter the lipoprotein pool. [OGWfl The passive exchange of cholesterol between ceils and lipoproteins occurs via the diffusion of sterol molecules across the aqueous space. Phillips et aj., supra, and Schroeder et ai., EXP. BIOL. MED., 196:235-252 (1991). Net cellular efflux occurs if the chemical potential of free cholesterol is lower in the plasma than in the cells so that sterol leaves the membrane following its activity gradient. Under these conditions, it has been shown that cholesterol-ester-loaded cells, which are morphologically characteristic of early atherosclerotic lesions, not only lose cholesterol, but promote ester hydrolysis, resulting in the reduction of intracellular deposits of this lipid. Small, ARTERIOSCLEROSIS, 8:103-129 (1988). Moreover as mentioned above, there is epidemiological evidence diat conditions which miglit be expected to enhance reverse cholesterol transport (low plasma cholesterol concentrations, or increased HDL concentrations) are correlated with reduced risk of premature atherosclerosis and may give rise to plaque regression.<br>
 Characieristically, plaques are associated with ulceration of the vessel intima. The lipid-containing plaques grow in the ulcerations projecting friable masses into the arterial lumen. The plaques may also injure and weaken the smooth muscle media of the vessel. As plaque formation progresses, more central regions of the plaques are shielded from the cfrculation. Extensive plaque formation also causes concentric or eccentric constriction of the vessel at the plaque site.<br>
 Presently, the most effective treatment of atherosclerosis is prevention. There is evidence that the progression and accumulation of lipids in lesions can be halted when plasma LDL concentrations are kept to near normal levels. Reynolds, Circulation,79:1146-1148 (1989). Current preventive management of atherosclerotic disease has focused on the use of drugs in conjunction with dietary restrictions to regulate plasma cholesterol levels. Moreover, antioxidant therapies which suppress the fonnation<br><br>
and uptake of modified LDL particles by the cells of the arterial wall are also proving beneficial. Chisolm, CLIN.CARDIOL., 14:25-30 (1991). However, while hypocholesterolemic drugs induce favorable plasma cholesterol changes which appear to slow the progression of atherosclerosis, they do not generally induce conditions that promote the efflux and removal of atheroma cholesterol. Clearly, in order to achieve significant regression of atheroma and lessen lumen obstruction, these space occupjang lipids must be mobilized. Present evidence suggests that processes which stimulate the efflux of extra hepatic cell cholesterol and transport it to the liver for excretion, reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), are important events in the prevention of atherosclerosis. Gwynne, Clin. CARDIOL., 14:17-24 (1991).<br>
 Current therapeutic modalities of arteriosclerosis are generally divided into surgical and medical management. Surgical therapy may entail vascular graft procedures to bypass regions of occlusion (e.g., coronary artery bypass grafting), removal of occluding plaques from the arterial wall {e.g., carotid endarterectomy), or percutaneously cracking the plaques (e.g., balloon angioplasty). Surgical therapies carry significant risk and only treat isolated lesions. Atherosclerotic plaques do\vnstream fi-om the treated lesion may continue to obstruct blood flow. Surgical therapies also do not limit the progression of atherosclerosis and are associated with the late complication of restenosis.<br>
 Medical therapy is directed to reducing other risk factors related to vascular disease (e.g., smoking, diabetes, and hypertension) and lowering forms of serum cholesterol that are associated with the development of atherosclerosis as described above. While medical therapies may slow the progression of plaque formation, plaque regression is relatively rare. Therefore, symptomatic atherosclerosis often requires both surgical and medical treatment.  Paradoxically, intravenous infiision of phospholipids and liposomes has been shown to produce regression of atherosclerotic plaques although serum lipid levels are transiently elevated. Williams et al., PERSPECT. BIOL. MED., 27:417-431 (1984). In some instances, however, cholesterol associated with development and progression of atherosclerosis may increase follovdng liposome administration.<br>
 Previous studies investigating phospholipid-induced mobilization of cholesterol in vivo have employed multilamellar or sonicated liposome vesicles. Liposome size is a key characteristic in clearance kinetics and is one of several reasons why sonicated vesicles have been expected to represent the bilayer structure best suited to enhance reverse cholesterol transpori. Sonication reduces multilamellar vesicles (MLV) to limit size' vesicles. These systems exhibit the minimum radius of curvature that can be adopted by the bilayer configuration without disruption. For example, the minimum size egg<br><br>
phosphatidylcholine hposome that can be generated is typically about 3U-nm diameter, often classified as a small unilamellar vesicle (SUV). For a given liposome composition, it is generally assumed that the smaller the particle diameter the greater the circulation half-life (Gregoriadis and Senior, LIFE SCL, 113:183-192 (1986)). Consequently, it was expected that SUV composed of phosphatidylcholine would circulate longer than larger liposomes, and therefore mobihze more cholesterol. Furthermore, packing constraints experienced by phospholipids in SUV, (due to the acute radius of curvature) gives rise to an instability that can result m fusion, Hope et al., CHEM. PHYS. LIPIDS; 40;89-107 (19S6), as well as an increased tendency to assimilate with lipoproteins. See, e.g., Scheiphofet a!., BiocHiM. BiOPHYS. ACTA, 542:296-307 (1978) and Kmpp et al., BiocHiM. BIOPHYS. ACTA, 72:1251-1258 (1976). Therefore, it was expected that SUV would produce a greater number of HDL-like particles, thus promoting efflux of sterol from peripheral tissues. Supporting this expectation, liposomes having diameters of 50-80 nni have been reported to opthnize sterol mobilization and plaque regression. European Patent Pubhcation No. 0461559A2.<br>
 United States Patent No. 5,746,223 (the '223 patent), entitled "Method of Forcing The Reverse Transport of Cholesterol From A Body Part While Avoidmg Harmful Disruptions Of Hepatic Cholesterol Homeostasis," United States Patent No. 6,080,422 (the 422 patent), entitled "Methods of Angioplasty and Cardiac Catheterization," and United States Patent No. 6,139,871 (the '871 patent), entitled Liposome Compositions And Methods For The Treatment of Artherosclerosis, each ofwhich is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, disclose {intei- alia) the use of LUVs to induce the reverse transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues, to treat atherosclerosis, and for use in angioplasty procedures.<br>
 More specifically, the '223 and '422 patents disclose the use of LUVs with a diameter up to 1000 nm (larger liposomes may be "less efficient"), with claims reciting larger than about 50, 80, or 100 nm diameters and the specification disclosing a preferable diameter of 120 nm in one embodiment. The doses administered in the '223 and '422 patents range from 10-1600 mg/kg per dose. In more specific embodiments the dose is less than 600 mg/kg per day and in other particular embodiments the dose is a bolus of 300 mg/kg administered to rabbits at one, three, and five days.<br>
 The '871 patent discloses the use of LUVs having a diameter ranging from 100-150 nm with a preferable diameter of 125 nm. The '871 patent also discloses administering LUVs in a range of about 100-150 mg/kg, "usually" about 200 to 750 mg/kg, and "most usually" about 280 to 420 mg/kg in multiple treatments, "generally weekly" for about 4-16<br><br>
weekS, "usually aoout lu -weeKs.tIhe 871 patent states that the concentration of the LUVs in the cairier may vary, but generally the concentration will be about 20-200 mg/ml, usually about 50-150 mg/ml, and most usually about lOOmg/ml.<br>
 Recently, two studies were conducted using ETC-5SS (liposomes made from 1-palmitoyl, 2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine, a proprietary product of Esperion Therapeutics, Inc.). ETC-58S sequesters cholesterol and otter exchangeable lipids from vascular and peripheral tissue (a process known as mobilization) resulting in transient increases in serum cholesterol that return to predose levels after ETC-5S8 delivers its cholesterol load to e liver for processing or excretion. Mobilization and regression of experimentally induced atherosclerosis has been showoi in pre-clinical models using a liposome size and composition very similar to ETC-5SS. ETC-588 acutely increases cholesterol flux within the body and enhances reverse lipid transport pathways.<br>
 The first study assessed the safety and tolerability of ETC-5S8 in healthy volunteers with single doses of 20, 60,150, 300, and 600 mg/kg of ETC-5SS liposomes. ETC-58S liposomes (200 mg/ml) were inftised intravenously at 10 ml per minute using an mfusion pump. ETC-588 in. plasma was assayed as phosphoHpid (PL), Total and unesterified cholesterol (UC) and PL were assayed by standard, automated methods.   Subjects were allocated to treatment groups according to a randomization schedule. Safety and tolerability, laboratory data, vital signs and adverse events were summarized at each time point and for pre-dose to pose-dose change using descriptive statistics. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measures were summarized using descriptive statistics. The results indicated that although cholesterol mobilization occurred across a wide range of doses the efficiency varied. In addition, three out of three subjects had elevated liver iunction tests at 600 mg/kg and one individual had a serious adverse event mdicated by increased liver function enzymes. Other adverse events included headache, dizziness, nausea, and fatigue.  The second study assessed the safety and tolerability of ETC-58S in healthy volunteers who received a total of 4 doses given at 3 day intervals. Doses administered were 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 mg/kg ETC-5SS liposomes (200 mg/ml) were infused intravenously at 10 ml per minute using an infijsion pump. ETC-5SS in plasma was assayed as phospholipid (PL). Total and unesterified cholesterol (UC) and PL were assayed by standard, automated methods. Subjects were allocated to treatment groups accordiag to a randomization schedule. Safety' and tolerability, laboratory data, vital signs and adverse events were summarized at each time point and for pre-dose to post-dose change using descripti\'e statistics. Pharmacoldnetic and pharmacodynamic measures were summarized using descriptive statistics. The results indicated that cholesterol mobilization increased in a<br><br>
dose-dependent fashion, although efficiency vaned. hi addition, dosing at li day intervals for a total of 4 doses appeared to cause an undesirable accumulation of ETC-588. As in the first study, other adverse events included headache, dizziness, nausea, and fatigue. Furthermore, these dosing studies, were conducted solely on healthy patients and not on patients with disease or other undesu-able bodily conditions.<br>
Therefore, a need exists to determine safe, effective, and non-toxic doses and dosina regimens in diseased patients that prevents or reduces any unwanted side effects. In addition, there is a need to detemiine more optimal dosing regimens using optimally sized liposomes to treat patients suffering from the diseases and/or bodily conditions disclosed herein or other diseases or conditions.<br>

USEFUL DEFINITIONS As used herein, "drug" is meant to indicate a synthetic compound suitable for<br>
therapeutic use without associated bound carriers, adjuvants, activators, or co-factors.<br>
"Drug" does not include natural or endogenous apolipoproteins, lecithin-cholesterol<br>
acyltransferase, or albumin. "Liposome", "vesicle" and "liposome vesicle" will be<br>
understood to indicate structures having lipid-containing membranes enclosing an aqueous<br>
interior. The structures may have or one more lipid membranes unless othen\dse indicated,<br>
although generally the liposomes will have only one membrane. Such single layered<br>
liposomes are referred to herein as "unilamellar". The term "LUVs" refers to large<br>
unilamellar vesicles, the term "SUVs" refers to small unilamellar vesicles, and the term<br>
"MLVs" refers to multilamellar vesicles. As used herein, the term "treating<br>
atherosclerosis" encompasses performing a therapeutic intervention that results in reducing<br>
the cholesterol content of at least one atherosclerotic plaque or prophylactically inhibiting<br>
or preventing the formation or expansion of an atherosclerotic plaque.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  The present invention is based, in part, on the discovery that specific doses and<br>
dosing regimens used to deliver liposomes, particularly liposomes of specific size play<br>
critical roles in optimizing the removal or cholesterol from peripheral tissues and/or the<br>
metabolism of cholesterol removed from atherosclerotic plaques by such liposomes. The<br>
novel methods of the invention encompass the treatment or prevention of disease or the<br>
symptoms thereof while reducing or avoiding adverse effects, e.g., toxic side effects or<br>
unwanted effects. In addition, contrary to previous descriptions of liposome therapy, the<br>
inventors of the present invention have discovered that liposomes may be used to prevent,<br>
treat or manage a variety of diseases and bodily conditions besides atherosclerosis and other<br>
indications previously described for liposome therapy.<br>
[0032] In one embodiment, the invention encompasses a method of dosing liposomes to a<br>
patient in need thereof, which method comprises administering liposomes with an average<br>
diameter of 100 nm and preferably less than 250 nm, to a patient having a disease treatable<br>
by cholesterol reduction in a single or divided dose administered every 4 to 7 days of from<br>
about 100 mg/kg to about 250 mg/kg, preferably from about 100 mg/kg to about 200<br>
mg/kg. The patients to be freated, the liposomes to be used in the present invention and the<br>
specific doses and dosing regimens are discussed in detail below.<br><br>
1. Liposomes<br>
 The invenrors of the present invention have discovered that hposoraes with an average diameter greater than 100 nm and preferably ranging from 100 nm to 140 nm, more preferably from 110 nm to 120 nm are optimal for cholesterol removal from the system, hi general, the superior action of liposomes greater than 100 nanometers in diameter may be explained by the micro-anatomy of the liver. When circulating in the liver, large liposomes (as used herein, liposomes greater than 100 nm in diameter) may be cleared predominantly by the Kupffer cells that line the sinusoidal openings. The Kupffer cells transfer cholesterol to hepatocytes for excretion in the bile or for re-utilization. Small liposomes (as used herein, liposomes smaller than 100 nm) may directly access hepatocytes without (or with limited) prior processing by the Kupffer cells. Because for a fixed dose there may be more small liposomes infused than larger sized particles, hepatocytes may be acutely exposed to a relatively high concentration of small Uposomes and their accumulated cholesterol. The inventors of the present invention have discovered that liposomes with a diameter of between 100 nm and 140 mn, preferably 110 nm and 120 nm are optimal because Uiey are both cleared predominantly by the Kupffer cells and are more effective in mobilizing cholesterol than either smaller or larger sized liposomes.<br>
In addition to and separate from the Uposome size distribution, the inventors have discovered that in diseased patients certain doses and dose regimens are both safer and more effective in treating diseases. In such methods and the compositions used within the methods, one may use liposomes of any size or liposomes having any average diameter with any standard deviation or size distribution. Indeed, it is preferred that liposomes of the optimal size be used within the novel dosing regimens or within the preferred doses.  In specific embodiments, the hposomes have an average diameter greater than 100 nm regardless of the standard deviation or size distribution. In separate preferred embodiments the liposomes have an average diameter between 50-250 nanometers (nm) with any standard deviation or size distribution. In separate preferred embodiments the liposomes have an average diameter between 50-250 mn ± 40-50%. In separate preferred embodiments, the liposomes have an average diameter between 100-140 nm with any standard deviation or size distribution. In separate preferred embodiments, the liposomes have an average diameter between 100-140 nm ± 40-50%. hi separate preferred embodiments, the liposomes have an average diameter between 110-120 nm with any standard deviation or size distribution, ti separate preferred embodiments, the liposomes have an average diameter between 110-120 nm ± 40-50%. In separate preferable embodiments, the liposomes have an average diameter between 100 and 200 nm with any<br><br>
standard deviation or size distnbution. In particular embodiments, the liposomes tiave an average diameter size between: 100 and 110 nm, 110 and 120 nm, 120 and 130 ran, 130 and 140 nm, 140 and 150 nm, 150 and 160 nm, 160 and 170 nm, 170 and 180 nm, ISO and 190 nm, or between 190 and 200 ran with any standard deviation or size distribution, preferably the size distribution is between ± 40% and ± 50%. In a preferred separate embodiment, the liposomes utiHzed are ETC-5S8 (a proprietary product of Esperion Therapeutics, Inc.) having an average diameter between 100 nm and 140 nm ± 40-50% after manufacture. ] The invention also contemplates the use of liposomes with an average diameter greater than 50 nm and preferably greater dian 100 nm and less than 250 nm which when administered, does or does not raise LDL serum concentrations. The invention also contemplates the use of Uposomes with an average diameter greater than 50 nm and preferably greater than 100 ran and less than 250 nm which when administered does or does not lower LDL serum concentrations. In some instances the liposomes will not fae bound to another molecule such as a drug or protein. In other instances, the liposomes of the present invention will be bound, combined and/or administered in combination with: (1) proteins and peptides bound to liposomes such as lipid binding proteins including peptides, paraoxonase, lipoprotein lipase, lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase, phospholipid transfer protein, Apo A-I and mimetics or variants of ApoA-I; (2) small acceptors including HDL, synthetic and/or recombinant HDL particles, synthetic and/or recombinant HDL particles made with apolipoproteins ApoA-I or ApoA-I mimetics; (3) cardiovascular agents including small molecules, statins, aspirin, clopidogrel, beta-blockers, glycemjc control and/or anti-diabetic agents, antihypertensive agents, heparin, nitrates, Hb/IIIa inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, fibrates, calcium channel blockers, and/or bile acid sequestrants; (4) and antidiabetic (and/or glycemic control) phamiacotherapy including but not limited to insulin and oral agents. In addition, large liposomes may be administered alone or in combination with multilamellar vesicles and/or small unilamellar vesicles. Examples of proteins and peptides (such as lipid bmding proteins including peptides, Apo A-I and mimetics or variants of A-I) are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,004,925, 6,046,166, 6,037,323, 6,287,590, 6,329,341, and 6,265,377 all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Examples of small molecules that moderate HDL, LDL or cholesterol levels are described in U.S. Patent Application Nos. 09/540,740, 09/540,739, and 09/540,738 all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. [0037] Persons of skill will appreciate that the liposomes in the compositions of the present invention may be synthesized by a variety of methods, such as described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,186,183; 4,217.344; 4,261,975; 4,485,054; 4,774,085; 4,946,787; 5,726,157;<br><br>

NATL. ACAD. Sci. USA, 76:3348-3352 (1979); Hope et al., BiocHlM. BIOPHYS. ACTA, 812:55-65 (1985); Mayer et al., BIOCHIM. BIOPPR'S. ACTA, 858:161-168 (1986); and Williams et al.,PROC. NATL. ACAD. SCI., 85:242-246 (1988), each of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Suitable methods include, e.g., sonication, extrusion, high pressure/homogenization, microfluidization, detergent dialysis, calcium-induced fusion of small liposome vesicles, and ether-infiision methods, all well known m the art.<br>
 Generally, the liposomes are most conveniently generated by sonication and extrusion procedures. Briefly, lipid is mixed with physiological saline and buffer. In one embodiment, a chloroform solution of lipid is vortexed and the solvent removed under a steady stream of Ni. The sample is dried under a high vacuum. The resulting dry lipid film is rehydrated in 150 mM NaCl and 20 mM [4-(2-hydroxyethyl)]-piperazine-etbanesulfonic acid (Hepes, pH 7.4). This generally produces multilamellar liposomal vesicles. Unilamellar vesicles are prepared by sonication or extrusion.<br>
 Sonication is generally performed with a tip sonifier, such as a Branson tip sonifier, in an ice bath. Typically, the suspension is subjected to several sonication cycles. Extrusion may be carried out by membrane extmders, such as the Lipex Biomembrane Extruder. Defined pore size in the extrusion filters may generate unilamellar liposomal vesicles of specific sizes. The liposomes may also be formed by extrusion tiirough an asymmetric ceramic filter, such as a Ceraflow Microfilter, commercially available from the Norton Company, Worcester Mass. ETC-5 88 Hposomes (a proprietary product fi-om Esperion Therapeutics, currraitly being evaluated in clinical trials) are produced by extrusion. The current method involves hydrating l-palmitoyl-2-oleoyI phosphatidylcholine (POPC) with phosphate-buffered saline and pushing these through membrane filters until an average diameter of about 100 to 140 nm is achieved, and more preferably until an average diameter of about 110 to 120nmis achieved. Single or multiple passes may be made through the membrane filters. In one specific embodiment, 2-10 passes are made, preferably 2-5 passes are made. In addition, the filter membranes may be the same or different sizes (i.e., there may be a gradient of membranes). The resulting product is called ETC-588. Examples of preparing liposomes of specific sizes by extrusion are described m U.S. Provisional Patent AppHcation No. 60/326,032, filed on Sept. 28, 2001, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br><br>
 Other ways of producing liposomes with the same average diameter include homogenization or microf]uidization, however the distribution of particles is larger. See Figure lA versus Figure IB. Using current technology, the biological effect particles produced by homogenization or microfluidization are different from those produced by extrusion. The clearance kinetics is slightly faster and area under the curve measurements for cholesterol mobilization are slightly less indicating that these particles are less efficacious than extruded liposomes even when animals ai'e administered the equivalent dose on a mg phospholipid/fcg basis.<br>
 The size of the hposomal vesicles may be determined by quasi-electric light scattering (QELS) as described in Bloomfield, ANN.REV. BIOPHYS. BIOENG., 10:421-450 (1981), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Average liposome diameter may be reducedbysonication of formed liposomes. Intermittent sonication cycles may be alternated with QELS assessment to guide efficient liposome synthesis. The liposomes may becomposedof a variety of lipids. Generally, the liposomes will be composed of at least one phospholipid, typically egg phosphatidylcholine, egg phosphatidylglycerol, distearoylphosphatidylcholine, or distearoylphosphatidylglycerol. Many embodiments of the present invention will include more than one phospholipid.<br>
 Other phospholipids suitable for formation of liposomes that can be used within the compositions or mediods described herein include, but are not limited to, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, lecithin, beta,<br>
ganmia-dipalmitoyl-alpha-lecithin, sphingomyehn, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid, N-(23-di(9-(Z)-octadecenyloxy))-pTop-l-yl-N,N,N-trimefhylanimonium chloride, phosphatidylethanoiamine, lysolecithin, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, cephalin, cardiolipin, cerebrosides, dicetylphosphate, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, dipahnitoylphosphatidylcholme, dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol, dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol, palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine, di-stearoyl-phosphatidylcholine, stearoyl-palmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine, di-pahnitoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine, di-stearoyl-phosphatidyJethanoIamine, di-myrstoyl-phosphatidyiserine, di-oleoyl-phosphatidy!choline, oleoyl-palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, pahnitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine, lipid which is in a liquid-crystalline phase at 37** C, mixtures thereof, and the like. In a preferred embodiment, the liposomes are composed of pahnitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine. Non-phosphorus containing lipids may also be used in the liposomes of the compositions of the present invention. These include, e.g., stearylaraine, docecylamine, acetyl palmitate, fatty acid amides, and the like. Additional lipids suitable<br><br>
tor use in the bposomes of the present invention are well known to persons ot skill m the art and are cited in a variety of well known sources, e.g., McCuTCHEON's DETERGENTS AND EMULSIFIERS and MCCUTCHEON'S FUNCTIONAL M-TERIALS, Allured Publishing Co., Ridgewood, N.J., both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
Generally, it is desirable that the liposomes be composed of lipids that are liquid-crystalline at 37°C, often at 35°C, and even 32C. Liposomes in the liquid-crystalline state typically accept cholesterol more efficiently than liposomes in the gel state. As patients typically have a core temperature of about 37°C, liposomes composed of lipids that are hquid-crystalline at 37°C are generally in a liquid-crystalline state during treatment and, therefore, optimize removal of cholesterol from plaques.<br>
 Preferably the hposomes used within the methods and compositions are cholesterol-free.<br>
2. Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
[0045] The pharmaceutical compositions of the present mvention may comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Many pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may be employed in the compositions of the present invention. Generally, normal saline will be employed as the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Other suitable carriers include, e.g., water, buffered water, 0.4% saline, 0.3% glycine, and the like, including glycoproteins for enhanced stability, such as albumin, lipoprotein, globulin, etc. These compositions may be sterilized by conventional, well known sterilization techniques. The resulting aqueous solutions maybe packaged for use or filtered under aseptic conditions and lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous solution prior to administration. The compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances required to approximate physiological conditions, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents and the like, for example, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, etc.<br>
[0046] The concentration of liposomes may vary.   In particular embodiments the concenfration of liposomes may range from about 20 mg/ml to about 1000 mg/m!, preferably between 50-300 mg/ml, more preferably between 50-200 mg/ml, and more preferably bet\veen 100-200 mg/ml. In separate preferable embodiments the concentration of liposomes may range from about 1-20 mg/ml, 20-30 mg/ml, 30-40 mg/ml, 40-50 mg/ml, 50-60 mg/ml, 60-70 mg/ml, 70-SO mg/ml, 80-90 mg/ml, 90-100 mg/ml, 100-110 mg/ml, 110-120 mg/ml, 120-130 mg/ml, 130-140 rag/ml, 140-150 mg/ml, 150-160 mg/ml, 160-170 mg/ml, 170-180 mg/ml, 180-190 mg/ml. or 190-200 mg/ml. In certain preferable<br><br>
embodiments, the concentration will be about 50 mg/ml, lOU mg/nal, 150 mg/mi, 200 mg/ml, 250 mg/ml, or 300 mg/ml. Persons of skill may vary these concentrations to optimize treatment with different liposomal components or of particular patients. For example, the concentration may be increased to lower the fluid load associated with treatment. This may be particularly desirable in patients having atherosclerosis-associated congestive heart failure or severe hypertension. Alternatively. liposomes composed of irritatuig lipids may be diluted to low concentrations to lessen inflammation at the site of administration.<br>
 The liposomes may optionally be bound to a variety of proteins and polypeptides to increase the rate of cholesterol transfer or the cholesterol-carrying capacity of the liposomes. Binding of apolipoproteins to the liposomes is particularly useful. As used herein,"bound to liposomes" or "binding to Hposomes" indicates that the subject compound is covalently or non-covalently bound to the surface of the liposome or contained, wholly or partially, in the ulterior of the Hposome. Apohpoprotein Ai, apolipoprotein An, and apolipoprotein E will generally be the most useful apolipoproteins to bind to the liposomes. These apolipoproteins promote transfer of cholesterol and cholesteryl esters to the liver for metabolism. Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase is also useful for metabolizing fi-ee cholesterol to cholesteryl esters. Liposomes in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention maybe bound to molecules of apolipoprotein Ai, apolipoprotein An, apohpoprotein E, and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, singly or in any combination and molar ratio. Additional proteins or other non-protein molecules may also be useflil to bind to the liposomes to enhance hposome stability or half-hfe and the like. These include, e.g., cholesterol, polyethylene glycol-linked phospholipid and gangliosides, sterols, alkylsulfates, ammonium bromide, albumin, and the like.<br>
 In specific embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiharies which facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used phannaceutically. In specific embodiments, such formulations include stabiHzers and/or antioxidants. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. The liposomes of the present invention may be in lyophilized fomis, liquid forms, frozen forms, or powder forms. In particular embodiments the liposomes of the present invention are in powder form, preferably lyophilized form, more preferably frozen form, and most preferably liquid form.  For particular embodiments, the Hposomes of the invention may be formulated in aqueous solutions for injection, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as<br><br>
Hanks' s solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art. In specific embodiments, topical or transdermal formulations include stabihzers and/or antioxidants.<br>
In other embodiments, the compounds can be formulated readily for oral administration by combining the liposomes with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art. Such carriers enable the compounds of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, push-fit capsules made of gelatin, soft or sealed capsules made of gelatin and plasticizer, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated. In addition, stabilizers may be added. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration.  In particular embodiments relating to buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of drops, tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner. The liposomes may be formulated for parenteral administration by inj ection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous inflision as described above. In several embodiments the compounds may be administered by continuous infusion intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. the compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizirsg and/or dispersing agents.  Additionally, suspensions of Uposomes may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, glycerol, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the liposomes to allow for the preparation of highly concenhated solutions.<br>
 Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder or lyophilized form for constitution or reconstitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use. The compounds may also be fonnulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
 In addition to the formulations described preiously, the liposomes may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection.<br><br>
Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or<br>
hydrophobic materials or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives.<br>
 The pharmaceutical compositions also may comprise suitable solid or gel phase<br>
carriers or excipients. Examples of such carriers or excipients include but are not limited to<br>
calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives,<br>
gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.<br>

 The liposome formulations of the present invention may also be administered to patients to urcrease HDL levels, increase low HDL levels, decrease LDL levels, decrease high LDL levels, temporarily increase LDL levels, decrease triglyceride levels, increase or decrease the level of other hpids, increase plaque stability or decrease the probability of plaque mpture, increase or decrease vasodilation, treat or pre\'ent inflammation, treat or prevent inflammatory diseases or an inflammatory response, strengthen or stabilize smooth muscle and vessel intima, stimulate efflux of extracellular cholesterol for transport to the liver, modulate immtine responses, mobihze cholesterol from atherosclerotic plaques, and modify any membrane, cell, tissue, organ, and extracellular region and/or stmcture in which compositional and/or functional modifications would be advantageous. The compositions and methods of the present invention also encompass topical applications and wound healing.<br>
 The methods of the present in\'ention are also useful for prophylactic treatments, particularly to prevent relapse or complications in patients recovering from invasive vascular procedures. Vascular regions having injured endothelium are at increased risk for developing atherosclerotic plaques. Therefore, invasive vascular procedures, such as coronary angioplasty, vascular bypass grafting, and other procedures that injure the vascular endothelial layer, may be practiced in conjunction with the methods of the present invention. As the mvasive procedure injures the endothehum, the liposomes act to remove cholesterol from the injured region and inhibit or prevent plaque formation of expansion during endothelial healing.<br>
 Hyperlipidemias may also be treated by the methods of the present invention. Administration of liposomes, alone or bound to apolipoprotein AI and apolipoprotern AH, apolipoprotein E, to individuals having hypoalphahpoproteinemia from genetic or secondary causes, familial combined hyperhpidemia, and familial hypercholesterolemia is a useful treatment.<br>
[0064] The liposomes administered in the methods of the present invention will be composed of lipids as described above. The lipids will generally be iri the hquid-crystalline<br><br>
state at 37C. The lipids will also generally include one or more phospholipids, m some cases phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylglycerol, although liposomes may be composed of many other lipids, examples of which are described above.<br>
 The liposomes may be administered in many ways. For example, the compositions may be administered orally or parenterally. Generally, the compositions will be administered parenterally, preferably intravenously or the administration may be intramuscular, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intra-arterial, intrathecal, via lymphatics, intravascular. Administration may be achieved via a chronically indwelling catheter or an acutely placed catheter via venous-infusion with a pump, via venous-infusion with a syringe, or via venous-iniusion with a syringe-push administration. In other embodiments, the administration may be sublingual, buccal, mucosal, topical, rectal, vaginal, or transdermal. in a particular embodiment, the compositions of the present invention are administered topically to prevent or treat inflaimTiation or to aid in the healing of wounds. In preferred embodiments, the liposomes will be adimnistered intravenously. Often, the liposomes will be administered into a large central vein, such as the superior vena cava or inferior vena cava, to allow highly concentrated solutions to be administered into large volume and flow vessels. The liposomes may be administered intraarterially prior to, during, or following vascular procedures to deliver a high concentration directly to an affected vessel. The liposomes may also be administered directly to vessels in a topical manner by surgeons during open procedures. In some instances, the liposomes may be administered orally or transdermally. The liposomes may also be incorporated in vascular stents for long duration release following placement. This is particularly effective for angioplasty treatment of restenosis of lesions in the coronary arteries.

 Dose regimes also include bolus administrations or continuous intuston treatment that may include the use of a primer dose followed by a maintenance dose. In preferred embodiments, the dose will be constant over the course of treatment, in other preferred embodiments, the dose will vary. In particular embodiments, the liposome formulations will be administered only once, and in other embodiment serially administered in multiple doses and in other embodiments administered in non-consecutive multiple doses. The duration, schedule of treatments, and dosing regimens may be varied by methods well known to those skilled in the art. Serum measurements of total free cholesterol, total esterified cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and VLDL cholesterol may be used to assess and modify dosage amounts and schedules during the treatment regimen. As cholesterol is mobilized from plaques, total serum cholesterol rises. It is desirable that total serum cholesterol and HDL cholesterol rise during therapy and esterified cholesterol drop (or be minimally affected) during therapy. The liposome dose for different animals will generally approximate the human weight-detemiined dosage. Patients treated with such compositions and according to such methods may be of any age and may be afflicted wdth one or more of the diseases or bodily conditions enumerated above and/or other diseases and conditions.<br>
EXAMPLES [0096] The following examples are offered by way of illustration and not limitation.<br>
Example 1 Multiple Doses of ETC-588 Liposomes in Patients With Atherosclerosis<br>
 A multiple-dose study was conducted which evaluated the effects of multiple-doses of ETC-58S liposomes (the ETC-5S8-003 study) in human patients with atherosclerosis. ETC-588 liposomes (200 mg/ml) were infused intravenously using an infusion pump. ETC-588 in plasma was assayed as phospholipid (PL). The dose groups were as follows: placebo (7 or 14 doses), 50 mg/kg (14 doses), 100 mg/kg (7 doses) or 200 mg/kg (7 doses) were studied. Doses were given at 4 day intervals (q4d) or 7 day intervals (q7d). A total of 42 patients participated in the study (male; 36, female: 6) between 44 and 76 years of age (the mean age being 63 ± 7 years). The mean weight of the patients was 87.7 kg ± 17.0 kg with a range of 52.4 kg to 147.7 kg. The mean baseline HDL-choIesterollevels of the patients were 36 ± 4 mg/dL and the mean baseline total cholesterol levels of the patients were 182 ± 36 mg/dL. In addition the following percentage of patients had a cardiovascular<br><br>
history of: coronary artery disease: 98%, peripheral artery disease: 2%; coronary artery bypass graft: 57%; Stable Angina: 29%; and Unstable Angina: 19%.<br>
 Total and unesterified cholesterol (UC) and PL were assayed by standard, automated methods. Subjects were allocated to treatment groups according to a randomization schedule. Safety and tolerability, laboratory data, vital signs and adverse events were summarized at each time point and for pre-dose to post-dose change using descriptive statistics. Pharmacokinetic and phamiacodynamic measures were summarized using descriptive statistics. Of the 42 patients who participated in the study 36 actually received the drug although 2 patients withdrew before completing all doses for reasons other than adverse events or side effects. The number of patients who reported any adverse event (AE) was 26 total (72%) and the number of patients who reported a serious adverse event (SAE) was 5 (14%) in total. The number of patients included in the safety analysis was 36 while 33 patients were included in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses (with incomplete pharmacokinetic data for 3 patients). The effects of ETC-588 on endothelial function (vascular structure), inflanunatory markers and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was also examined.<br>
 The results are presented in Figures 2 &amp; 3. The results demonstrate that cholesterol mobilization occurred across all doses of ETC-5SS with varying efficiencies. The following adverse events and serious adverse events were reported for each group:<br><br>
(OlQjif The most common adverse events in patients with at least once occurrence of an adverse event are sunmiarized below. Serious adverse events (bladder neck contracture, chest pain, hyperglycemia or exacerbation of diabetes) was considered by the treating physician to be unrelated to the administration of ETC-588:<br><br><br>
[0101] Overall, the results from the ETC-588-003 study suggest that ETC-58S liposomes mobilize cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner and that doses of 200 mg/kg or less are generally safe and well-tolerated. Further, as demonstrated above, seven day dosing intervals appear to be optimal over 4 day dosing intervals for ETC-5S8 liposomes because 7 day Josing enables optimal clearance of phospholipid and unesterified cholesterol in serum. In addition, 7 day dosing intervals may be optimal over  day dosing intervals because adverse events and serious adverse events may be reduced or prevented. [ For example, as demonstrated in the tables above, when 200 mg/kg was adininjstered in 7 day intervals the percentage of any adverse event was 40% and any serious adverse event was 20%. In contrast when 200 mg/kg was administered in 4 day intervals the percentage of any adverse event was 85.7% and any serious adverse event was 28.6%. Similarly, when 100 mg/kg was administered in 7 day intervals the percentage of any serious adverse event" was 0%. In contrast, when 100 mg/kg was administered in 4 day intervals the percentage of "any serious adverse event" was 25%. Likewise, when 50 rag/kg was administered in 7 day intervals the percentage of "any serious adverse event" was 0%. However, when 50 mg/kg was administered in 4 day intervals the percentage of "any serious adverse event" was 25%.<br><br><br>
