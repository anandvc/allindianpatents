According to a second aspect, the present invention provides a process for preparing the compounds of the invention comprising combining (a) a Group VII IB metal or compound thereof, as defined herein; with (b) a compound of formula I as defined herein.<br>
Conveniently, the compounds of the invention may be obtained by dissolving the Group VII IB metal or compound thereof as defined herein in a suitable solvent such as the ultimate end product of the carbonylation reaction, for example methylpropanoate where the ethylenically unsaturated compound to be carbonylated is ethene in the presence of methanol or methylnonanoate where it is intended to carbonylate octene in the presence of methanol. Preferably, the react ants are mixed at room temperature under an inert atmosphere (e.g. under nitrogen) . The molar ratio of the compound of formula I (referred to as (b)) to the Group VII IB metal or compound thereof (referred to as (a)) is preferably in the range of 1:1 to 5:1, more preferably in the range of 1:1 to 3:1, most preferably in the range of 1:1 to 1:1.25. Conveniently, the possibility of applying these low molar ratios is advantageous, as it avoids the use of an excess<br><br>
of the compound of formula I and hence minimises the consumption  of  these  usually  expensive  compounds.

Preferably, the carbonylation process is performed under a total pressure of less than or equal to 100 x 105Nm"2, more preferably less than or equal to 65 x lO5^"2, most preferably less than or equal to 50 x 105Nm'2.<br>
Carbon monoxide partial pressures in the range of 1 to 65, particularly 5 to 50 x 105Nm~3, are preferred. In the process according to the present invention, the carbon monoxide may be used in pure form or diluted with an inert gas such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide or a noble gas such as argon. Small amounts of hydrogen, typically less than 5% by volume, may also be present.<br>
The ratio (volume/volume) of ethylenically unsaturated compound to coreactant containing compound may vary between wide limits and suitably lies in the range of 1:0.1 to 1:10, preferably from 2:1 to 1:2.<br>
The amount of the catalyst of the invention used in the carbonylation process of the ethylenically unsaturated<br>
compound is not critical. Good results may be obtained by using 10"7 to 10"1 moles, more preferably 10"6 to 10o moles, of Group VII IB metal or a compound thereof (referred to as (a) herein) per mole of ethylenically unsaturated compound.<br>
Preferably, as mentioned herein, the process is performed by the inclusion of a source of anions as defined herein in addition to the compounds of the invention. Suitably, a source of anions separate from the compounds of the invention may be added to the carbonylation process. Preferably, as mentioned herein, the compounds of the invention include a source of anions. Suitably, the mole ratio of anions to the moles of Group VII IB metal in the compounds of the invention when used to carbonylate ethylenically unsaturated compounds lies between wide limits and suitably lies between 2:1 to 2000:1, preferably 10:1 to 200:1.<br>
Suitably, the carbonylation of an ethylenically unsaturated compound as defined herein may be performed in one or more aprotic solvents. Suitable solvents include ketones, such as for example methylbutylketone; ethers, such as for example anisole (methyl phenyl ether), 2,5,8-trioxanonane (diglyme), diethylether, tetrahydrofuran, diphenylether, diisopropylether and the dimethylether of di-ethylene-glycol; esters, such as for example methylacetate, dimethyladipate and butyrolactone; amides, such as for example dimethylacetamide and N-methylpyrrolidone; and sulfoxides and sulphones, such as for example dimethyl sulphoxide, di-i sopropyl sulphone, sulfolane (tetrahydrothiophene-2,2-dioxide) 2 -methylsulfolane and 2-methyl-4-ethylsulfolane.<br>
Very suitable are aprotic solvents having a dielectric<br>
constant that is below a value of 50, more preferably in<br>
the range of 3 to 8, at 298.15 K and 1 x lOm"2. In the<br>
present context, the dielectric constant for a -given<br>
solvent is used in its normal meaning of representing the<br>
ratio of the capacity of a condenser with that substance<br>
as dielectric to the capacity of the same condenser with a<br>
vacuum for dielectric. Values for the dielectric constants<br>
of common organic liquids can be found in general<br>
reference books, such as the Handbook of Chemistry and<br>
Physics, 76th edition, edited by David R. Lide et al, and<br>
published by CRC press in 1995, and are usually quoted for<br>
a temperature of about 20Â°C or 25"C, i.e. about 293.15k or<br>
298.15 K, and atmospheric pressure, i.e. about 1 x 105Nm"2,<br>
or can readily be converted to that temperature and<br>
pressure using the conversion factors quoted.  If no<br>
literature data for a particular compound is available,<br>
the dielectric constant may be readily measured using<br>
established physico-chemical methods.<br>
For example, the dielectric constant of anisole is 4.3 (at 294.2 K) , of diethyl ether is 4.3 (at 293.2 K), of sulfolane is 43.4 (at 303.2 K), of methylpentanoate is 5.0 (at 293.2 K), of diphenylether is 3.7 (at 283.2 K) , of dimethyladipate is 6.8 (at 293.2 K), of tetrahydrofuran is 7.5 (at 295.2 K) , of methylnonanoate is 3.9 (at 293.2 K). A preferred solvent is anisole.<br>
If the coreactant compound is an alkanol, a further preferred aprotic solvent is the ester carbonylation product of the ethylenically unsaturated compound, carbon monoxide and the alkanol.<br>
The process may advantageously be carried out in an excess of aprotic solvent, i.e. at a ratio (v/v) of aprotic solvent to coreactant containing compound of at least 1:1. Preferably, this- ratio ranges from 1:1 to 10:1 and more preferably from 1:1 to 5:1. Most preferably the ratio (v/v) ranges from 1.5:1 to 3:1.<br>
The catalyst compounds of the present invention may act as a 'heterogeneous catalyst or a "homogeneous" catalyst.<br>
By the term  homogeneous" catalyst we mean a catalyst, i.e. a compound of the invention, which is not supported but is simply admixed or formed in-situ with the reactants of the carbonylation reaction (e.g. the ethylenically unsaturated compound, the hydroxyl containing compound and carbon monoxide), preferably in a suitable solvent as described herein.<br>
By the term "heterogeneous" catalyst we mean a catalyst, i.e. the compound of the invention, which is carried on a support.<br>
Thus according to a seventh aspect, the present invention provides a catalyst system comprising a support, preferably an insoluble support, and a compound of the invention as defined herein. Conveniently, the use of an insoluble support permits easy separation of the catalyst, for example by filtration, from the reaction medium.<br>
Preferably, the support comprises a polymer such as a polyolefin, polystyrene and polystyrene/divinylbenezene copolymer; a silicon derivative such as a functionalised<br><br>
silica, a silicone or a silicone rubber; or other porous particulate material such as for example inorganic oxides and inorganic chlorides such as alumina and montmorillomite.<br>
Preferably the support material is porous silica which has a surface area in the range of from 10 to 700 m2/g, a total pore volume in the range of from 0.1 to 4.0 cc/g and an average particle size in the range of from 10 to 500/im. More preferably, the surface area is in the range of from 50 to 500 ma/g, the pore volume is in the range of from 0.5 to 2.5 cc/g and the average particle size is in the range of from 20 to 200 fim. Most desirably the surface area is in the range of from 100 to 400 ma/g, the pore volume is in the range of from 0.8 to 3.0 cc/g and the average particle size is in the range of from 30 to 100 im. The average pore size of typical porous support materials  is in the range of from 10  to 1000 A. Preferably, a support material is used that has an average pore diameter of from 50 to 500 A, and most desirably from 75 to 350 A. It may be particularly desirable to dehydrate the silica at a temperature of from 100 Â°C to 800Â°C anywhere from 3 to 24 hours.<br>
Suitably, the support may be flexible or a rigid support, the insoluble support is coated and/or impregnated with the compound of the invention by techniques well known to those skilled in the art. Alternatively, the compound of the invention is fixed to the surface of insoluble support, optionally via a covalent bond, and optionally includes a bi functional spacer molecule to space the compound from the insoluble support.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be fixed to the surface of the insoluble support by promoting reaction of a functional group present in the compound of formula I, for example a substituent of the ligand LI or a substituent K, D and E of the cyclopentadienyl moiety, with a complimentary reactive group present on or previously inserted into the support. The combination of the reactive group of the support with a complimentary substituent of the compound of the invention provides a heterogeneous catalyst where the compound of the invention and the support are linked via a linkage such as an ether, ester, amide, amine, urea, keto group.<br>
The choice of reaction conditions to link a compound of the present invention to the support depend upon the nature of the substituents (s) of the compound and the groups of the support. For example, reagents such as carbodiimides, l,l'-carbonyldiimidazole, and processes such as the use of mixed anhydrides, reductive animation may be employed.<br>
According to an eighth aspect, the present invention provides the use of a compound of the invention or a compound of the invention attached to a support as a catalyst.<br>
It will be appreciated that any of the features set forth in the first aspect of the invention may be regarded as preferred features of the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth aspect of the present invention and vice versa.<br>

Example l<br>
Preparation of 1,2-bis- (dimethylaminomethyl) ferrocene<br>
n-Butyllithium (Aldrich, 2.5 molar in hexane, 24 ml, 54 mcnol) is added to a solution of (dimethylaminomethyl) ferrocene (Aldrich, 13.13 g, 10.69 ml, 48.97 mmol) in diethyl ether (80 ml) under nitrogen at a temperature of 25aC and the reaction mixture stirred for 4 hours. The resulting red solution is then cooled to approximately -70 Â°C in a dry ice/acetone bath and Eschenmoaers salt (ICHaMNea) (Aldrich, 10 g, 54 mmol) is added. The reaction is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight.<br>
The resultant solution is quenched with excess aqueous sodium hydroxide and the resulting product extracted with diethyl ether (3 x 80 ml) dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered over celite, and volatiles removed In vacua to yield the crude title compound as a light orange crystalline solid. The crude product is recrystallised from light petrol with cooling to -17 Â°C and the recrystallised product washed with cold petrol to yield the title compound as a light orange solid (13.2 g, 74%). The compound can be further purified by sublimation to give 8.5 g (52%) of the title compound (mpt 74Â»C) .<br>

bis-me thanesulphonate<br>
Di-adamantylphosphine (prepared according to J.R.Qoerlich, R.Schmutzler; Phosphorus Sulphur and Silicon; 1995, 102, 211-215, 20.Og, 0.066 mol) was added to a solution of 1,2-bis (dime thylaminomethyl) ferrocene (Example 1, 10 g, 0.033 mol) in anhydrous acetic acid (100 ml) under nitrogen and the resulting mixture is stirred at 80"C for 72 hours. The orange yellow precipitate which forms is filtered and dried In vacuo at approximately 70Â°C to yield the title compound as an orange/yellow solid. The title compound is insoluble in a range of organic solvents and it is<br>
therefore purified by conversion to the bis-methanesulphonate salt by addition of excess methanesulphonic acid to a methanol slurry of the crude product. This resulted in complete dissolution of the product salt which was then isolated by removal of the methanol in vacua followed by washing with ether and drying to give the title compound as a pale yellow solid (14.Og, 54%).<br>

Preparation  of  1,2  bia(di-l-adamantylphosphinomethyl)<br>
ferrocene-bis-methane sulphonate<br>
The preparation of this ligand was carried out as follows: 14.1   Preparation of (l-Ad)2P(O)Cl<br>
Phosphorous trichloride (83 cm3, 0.98 mol) was added rapidly via cannula to a combination of aluminium chloride (25.0 g, 0.19 mol) and adamantane (27.2 g, 0.20 mol) affording a tan suspension. The reaction was heated to reflux. After 10 minutes, a yellow-orange suspension was formed. The reaction was refluxed for a total of 6 hours. The excess PCls was removed by distillation at atmospheric<br>
pressure {BP 75Â°C) . On cooling to ambient temperature, an orange solid was formed. Chloroform (250 cm3) was added yielding an orange suspension, which was cooled to 0Â°C. Water (150 cm3) was added slowly: initially the suspension viscosity increased, but on full addition of water the viscosity lessened. From this point the reaction was no longer kept under an atmosphere of Ar. The suspension was Buchner filtered to remove the yellow-orange solid impurity. The filtrate consisted of a two phase system. The lower phase was separated using a separating funnel, dried over MgS04 and Buchner filtered. The volatiles were removed via rotary evaporation, drying finally in-vacuo, affording an off-white powder. Yield 35.0 g, 99%. 31P NMR: * 85 ppm, 99% pure. PW Â» 352.85.<br>

The reaction was allowed to warm to ambient temperature then stirred for 20 hours. The grey suspension was cooled to -10Â°C. HC1 (aq. 5 cm3 c. HC1 in 50 cm3 degassed water) was added slowly via syringe (initially very slowly due to exotherm of reaction), yielding a two phase system, with some solid material in the lower phase. Further HC1 ( 5 cm3 c. HC1) was added to improve the separation of the layers. The upper phase was removed via flat ended cannula, dried over MgSO4 and filtered via cannula. The volatiles were removed in-vacuo affording the product as a white powder, isolated in the glovebox. Yield 6.00 g, 70%. 31P NMR: - 17 ppm, 100% pure. FW  302.44.<br>

Preparation of methyl	propanoate from ethylene, carbon<br>

present invention	.<br>
A mechanically stirred autoclave (Hastelloy) of 2 litre capacity was evacuated of air and then charged with a solution of tri (dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium (1.44 x 10"5    moles),    l,2-bis-(di-tertbutylphosphinomethyl) ferrocene of Example 2, (7.61 x 10'5 moles) and methane sulfonic acid (2.25 x 10"3 moles) in 300 ml of methyl propanoate/methanol  (70  wt%  methyl propanoate) .  The autoclave  was  heated  to  100 "C  and when  at  that temperature, ethylene (8 x 105Nm"2) was added on top of the vapour pressure of the solvents and immediately an eguimolar mixture of carbon monoxide and ethylene (2 x 105Nm"3) added to the system through a pressure regulating valve set to 10 x 105Nm"a above the solvent vapour pressure. Suitably, the molar ratio of ethylene to carbon monoxide  in the reactor is  approximately 9:1.  The temperature of the reactor was maintained at 100 "C and as the reaction proceeded additional carbon monoxide and ethylene was added (on an equimolar basis) through the pressure   regulating  Tescom  valve.   No  catalyst precipitation was observed.<br>
Initial reaction rates measured in moles of methyl propanoate (MeP) per mole of palladium per hour and turnover measured in moles of methyl propanoate per mole of palladium were determined for the catalyst. This may be accomplished by an analysis of the amount of gas consumed per unit time (rate) and the total amount of gas consumed<br><br>
during the reaction, assuming ideal gas behaviour and 100% selectivity to methyl propanoate.<br>
The reaction was repeated (Run 2) and initial reaction rates and turnover numbers calculated as described above. The data for both runs is displayed in Table 1.<br><br>

Example 24 was repeated (Runs 5 to 9 respectively) except the catalyst system employed was obtained by charging the autoclave with 1,2-bis- (di- 1-adamantylphosphinomethyl) ferrocene-bis-methane sulphonate (Example 13 or 14, 7.61 x 10"5 moles), tri (dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium (1.44 x 10"5 moles) and methane sulfonic acid (2.25 x 103 moles)<br>
in methyl propanoate/methanol (300 ml,  70 wt% methyl propanoate).<br>
The initial reaction rates (moles MeP/mole Pd per hour) and turnover numbers (moles Pd/moles MeP) for the catalyst were calculated as described in Example 24 above. The results are presented in Table 3 below.<br>
(Table Remove)<br><br><br>
Tabte3<br>
The results demonstrate (see Table 3 and Table 2), that the catalyst of the present invention palladium 1,2-bis (di-1-adamantylphosphinomethyl) ferrocene-bis-me thane sulphonate exhibits a significantly higher initial catalytic rate and a significantly higher turnover number than the known catalyst palladium 1,2-bis-(di-t-butylphosphinomethyl) benzene, thereby indicating the compound of the present invention increases the rate of the carbonylation reaction compared to the known bidentate system.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
