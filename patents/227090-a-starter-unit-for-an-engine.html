In the crank case 12, an engine hanger boss 117 for mounting of the engine in the vehicle is provided below the crankshaft 16, and the oil intake passage<br>
115	is arranged so as to communicate between the crankshaft 16 and the engine<br>
hanger boss 117.<br>
[0056]<br>
Next, operation of this embodiment will be described. The second oil sump 82 spanning the joint surface 19 is formed at a lower part of the crankcase 12, lower down than the crankshaft 16, and the pump chamber 106 for the oil pump 102 for drawing in oil from the lower most part of the second oil sump 82 is formed between the right and left case half bodies 17 and 18 sandwiching the joint surface 19, but the oil intake passage 115 connecting between the oil pump 102 and the lowermost part of the second oil sump 82 is formed between the two case half bodies 17 and 18 sandwiching the joint surface 19 using the passage groove<br>
116	provided on at least one of the two case half bodies 17 and 18 (the left<br>
case half body 18 in this embodiment).<br>
[0057]<br>
Specifically, by constructing the crank case 12 by joining the right and left case half bodies 17 and 18 together with the joint surface 19, the oil intake passage 115 guiding oil of the second oil sump 82 to the oil pump 102 is<br>
formed, and compared to using an oil pipe etc., it is possible to reduce the<br>
number of components and to improve ease of assembly.<br>
[0058]<br>
Also, since the oil pump 102 is arranged further forward than the crankshaft 16 in a state mounted on the vehicle, and the oil intake passage 115 arranged around the crankshaft 16 is connected to the second oil sump 82 at a front wall lower section of the lowermost section of the second oil sump 82, it is possible to set the ground clearance comparatively high by arranging the oil intake passage 115 adjacent to the crankshaft 16, and it is possible to make the volume of the second oil sump 82 comparatively large. [0059]<br>
Also, in the crank case 12, an engine hanger boss 117 is provided lower down than the crankshaft 16, with the oil intake passage 115 being arranged so as to communicate between the crankshaft 16 and the engine cover hanger 117. Internal pressure of the oil intake passage 115 is low, and the seal width of the oil intake passage 115 at the joint surface 19 can be set low, which means that it is possible to set the engine hanger boss 117 at a comparatively high position, and it is possible to set the ground clearance of the crankcase 12 even higher. [0060]<br>
The first oil sump 81 communicating with a lower part of the crank chamber 20, and the second oil sump 82, causing the reed valve 83 that is opened arid closed according to pressure variations inside the crank chamber 20 to be interposed between the first oil sump 81 and the crank case 12, are formed in the crankcase 12, but the first and second oil sumps 81 and 82 are formed in the crank case 12 so that a lowermost part of the second oil sump 82 is arranged below the first oil sump 81, the drain hole 96, having an upper end opening to a bottom part of the first oil sump 81 and extending vertically, and is provided at a lower part of the right case half body 17 of the crank case 12 so that a middle section opens to the lowermost section of the second oil sump 82, and the lower end opens to a bottom surface of the crank case 12, and a drain bolt 97 inserted into the drain hole 96 for blocking between lowermost sections of the first oil sump 81 and the second oil sump 82, and also blocking the second oil sump 82 from the outside of the crankcase 12, is screwed into the right case half body 17 from below the crank case 12. [0061]<br>
Therefore, by unscrewing the single drain bolt 97 and removing it from the crank case 12, it is possible to discharge oil from the first oil sump 81 and the second oil sump 82 to the outside of the crank case 12 together, and by screwing the drain bolt 97 into the right case half body 17 and tightening it up it is possible to block the first and second oil sumps 81 and 82 from the<br>
outside of the crank case 12, which means that with respect to discharging oil from the first and second oil sumps 81 and 82, it is possible to reduce the number of components and to improve maintainability. [0062]<br>
The drain hole 96 is made up of an insertion hole section 96a having a lower end opening to a bottom surface of the right case half body 17, and a screw hole section 96b formed in a smaller diameter than the insertion hole section 96a coaxially with the insertion hole section 96a, and having an upper end opening to the first oil sump 81, a connecting hole 98 having one end communicating with the lowermost section of the second oil sump 82 and the other end opening to a middle section inner surface of the insertion hole 96a is provided in the right case half body 17, and a drain bolt 97, forming an annular chamber 99 communicating with the communicating hole 98 between the inner surface of the insertion hole 96a, has an expanded head section 97a that touches and engages with a bottom part of the right case half body 18, and is screwed into the screw hole 96b. [0063]<br>
According to the type of structure for drain hole 96, it is possible to allow communication between the second oil sump 82 and the drain hole 96 at as low a position inside the lowermost section as possible, while keeping the length of a screw hole section 96a required to fasten the drain bolt 97 firmly to the crank case 12 comparatively large, it is possible to make the amount of residual oil inside the first oil sump 81 as small as possible, and it is also possible to make the amount of residual oil inside the second oil sump 82 as small as possible. [0064]<br>
Also, the main shaft 27 having an axis parallel to the crankshaft 16 rotatably supported in the crankcase 12, and fitted with a plurality of gear stage drive gear groups 29, is rotatably supported in the crank case 12, the gear switching clutch 30 switching between engaging and disengaging drive force between the crankshaft 16 and the main shaft 27 is mounted on one end of the main shaft 27, the power transmission gear train 34, including the clutch gear 36 rotating together with the input member 31 of the gear switching clutch 30, is provided between one end of the crankshaft 16 and the input member 31, the kick start gear train 76 for inputting starting operation force corresponding to a kick operation to the clutch gear 36 is arranged between the drive gear group 29 and the clutch gear 36, running in the axial direction of the main shaft 27, and the one-way starter clutch 39 interposed between the starter motor 38 and the crankshaft 16 is arranged between the drive gear group 29 and the clutch gear 36 running in the axial direction of the main shaft 27, and fitted to the crankshaft 16.<br>
[0065]<br>
According to the above-described structure, by fitting the one-way starter clutch 39 on the crankshaft 16, a power transmission load imposed by the one-way starter clutch 39 is made comparatively small and it is possible to make the one-way starter clutch 39 small, and reduce to size of the engine. Also, by arranging the one-way starter clutch 39 and the kick start gear train 76 between a drive gear group 29 and the clutch gear 36 along the axial direction of the main shaft 27, in addition to starting the engine using the starter motor 38, it is also possible to start the engine using a kick start operation, so it is possible for a kick start gear train 76 to be efficiently arranged in a space between the drive gear group 29 and the clutch gear 36 created by arranging the one-way starter clutch 39, and it is also possible to avoid making the engine large because of arrangement of the kick start gear train 76. [0066]<br>
Also, since the first drive gear 35 constituting part of the power transmission gear train 34 is fixed to one end of the crankshaft 16 projecting from the crankcase 12 with a ball bearing 24 interposed between the right case half body 17 of the crankcase 12 and the crankshaft 16, and the one way starter clutch 39 and the second drive gear 44, fixed to the crankshaft 16 and constituting part of an auxiliary drive power transmission gear train 43 are arranged parallel to each other between the first drive gear 35 and the ball bearing 24, effective use is made of the space for arranging the kick start gear train 76, making it possible to arrange the auxiliary drive power transmission gear train 43 and contribute to reduction in engine size. [0067]<br>
The one way starter clutch 39 is provided with a clutch inner 41, input with drive force from the starter motor 38, and a clutch outer 42, fitted to the crankshaft 16 incapable of relative rotation, and having an inner boss section 42a supported on the clutch inner 41 capable of relative rotation, with the inner boss section 42a being fitted between the first drive gear 35 and the second drive gear 44. [0068]<br>
Therefore, backlash of the one-way starter clutch 39 in a direction along the axis of the crankshaft 16 can be suppressed without using dedicated components, and it is possible to improve durability of the one-way starter clutch 39 and reduce noise while avoiding significant increase in the number of components. [0069]<br>
The first drive gear 35, inner boss section 42a of the clutch outer 42, and the second drive gear 44 are in contact with each other, and fixed to the crankshaft 16 so as to be incapable of relative rotation, with a tubular section<br>
44a coming into contact with an inner race outer surface of the ball bearing 24 interposed between the crankshaft 16 and the crank case 12 being integrally provided in an extended manner on the second drive gear 44, axially further inwards than the second drive gear 44, and a bolt 46 having an expanded head section 46a that touches and engages with an outer end of the first drive gear 35 being coaxially screwed into one end of the crankshaft 16. [0070]<br>
Therefore, the first drive gear 35 the clutch outer 42 and the second drive gear 44 are fixed to the crankshaft 16 with a simple structure with few components not requiring parts other than the bolt 46, and also the first drive gear 35, clutch outer 42 and second drive gear 44 are prevented from being inclined with respect to the axis of the crankshaft 16, significantly increasing the durability of the one-way starter clutch 39 and reducing noise. [0071]<br>

[0072]<br>
Further, since one end sides of a plurality (in this embodiment 2) of support shafts 69, 70 are fixed to the holder plate 67 attached to the right case half body 17 of the crank case 12, and, of the gears 63 - 66 and 40 constituting the starting power transmission gear train 61, except for the free wheel gear 40 and the third drive gear 63, a plurality of gear 64 - 66 are rotatably supported on the other ends of the support shafts 69 and 70, it is possible to attach the holder plate 67 with the plurality of gears 64 - 66 constituting part of the starting power transmission gear train 61 assembled to the crank case 12, which means that ease of assembly is improved. Also, compared to making the crank case 12 of aluminum alloy, the holder plate 67 is made from a steel material, and the load on the right case half body 17 at the parts supporting the gears 64 - 66 is reduced, making it possible to make the holder plate 67 comparatively thin. [0073]<br>
