COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"AN ACRYLAMIDE BASED COMPOUND OF FORMULA I, PROCESS FOR PREPARATION AND PHARMCEUTICAL COMPOSITION THEREOF."<br>
AFFINIUM PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., a Canadian Corporation of 100 University Avenue, 10th floor, South Tower, Toronto Ontario, Canada M5J 1V6,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br>
This invention relates to pharmaceutically active compounds which inhibit Fab I and are useful for the treatment of bacterial infections.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
While the overall pathway of saturated fatty acid biosynthesis is similar in all organisms, the fatty acid synthase (FAS) systems vary considerably widi respect to their structural organization. Vertebrates and yeast possess a FAS in which all the enzymatic activities are encoded on one or two polypeptide chains, respectively, and the acyl carrier protein (ACP) is an integral part of the complex. In contrast, in bacterial FAS, each of the reactions is catalyzed by a distinct, mono-functional enzyme and the ACP is a discrete protein. Therefore, there is considerable potential for die selective inhibition of the bacterial system by antibacterial agents.<br>
Fab I (previously designated EnvM) functions as an enoyl-ACP reductase (Bergler, et al, (1994), J.BioLChem. 269, 5493-5496) in the final step of the four reactions involved in each cycle of bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis. In this pathway, the first step is catalyzed by P-ketoacyl-ACP synthase, which condenses malonyl-ACP with acetyl-CoA (FabH, synthase m)- In subsequent rounds, malonyl-ACP is condensed with die growing-chain acyl-ACP (FabB and FabF, synthases I and II, respectively). The second step in the elongation cycle is ketoester reduction by NADPH-dependent (3-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (FabG). Subsequent dehydration by p-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrase (either FabA or FabZ) leads to trans-2-enoyl-ACP, which in turn is converted to acyl-ACP by NADH-dependent enoyl-ACP reductase (Fab I). Further rounds of this cycle, adding two carbon atoms per cycle, eventually lead to palmitoyl-ACP (16C), where upon the cycle is stopped largely due to feedback inhibition of Fab I by palmitoyl-ACP (Heath, et al, (1996), J.BioLChem. 271, 1833-1836). Thus, Fab I is a major biosynthetic enzyme and is a key regulatory point in the overall synthetic pathwayof bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis. Therefore, Fab I is an ideal target for antibacterial intervention.<br>
Studies have shown that diazaborine antibiotics inhibit fatty acid, phospholipid and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis and that the antibacterial target of these compounds is Fab I. For example, derivative 2b 18 from Grassberger, et al, (1984) J. Med Chem 27. 947-953 has been reported to be a non-competitive inhibitor of Fab I (Bergler, et al, (1994) J.BioLChem. 269, 5493-5496). Also, plasmids containing the Fab I gene from diazaborine<br><br>
WO 01/271<br><br>
PCT/US00/27844<br><br>
resistant 5. typhimurium conferred diazaborine resistance in E.coli (Turnowsky, et al, (1989) J.Bacteriol, 171, 6555-6565). Furthermore, inhibition of Fab I either by diazaborine or by raising the temperature in a Fab I temperature sensitive mutant is lethal. These results demonstrate that Fab I is essential to the survival of the organism (Bergler, et 5      al, (1994) J.Biol.Chem. 269, 5493-5496).<br>
Recent studies have shown that Fab I is also the target for the broad spectrum antibacterial agent triclosan (McMurry, et al, (1998) Nature 394, 531-532). A crystal structure of the E. Coli Fab I complexed with NAD and triclosan shows that triclosan acts as a site-directed, very potent inhibitor of Fab I by mimicking its natural substrate (Levy, et 10      al. (1999) Nature 398, 383-384). Ward, et al ((1999) Biochem. 38, 12514-12525) have<br>
shown that there is no evidence for the formation of a covalent complex between Fab I and triclosan, which would be analogous to the diazaborines; triclosan differs from these compounds in that it is a reversible inhibitor of Fab I. The structural data for the complex of Fab I with NAD and triclosan provides important information about Fab I as a 15-     therapeutic target.<br>
Importantly, it has now been discovered that certain compounds are Fab I inhibitors and have antibacterial activity, and, therefore, may be useful for the treatment of bacterial infections in mammals, particularly in man.<br>
Additionally, two of the instant Fab I inhibiting compounds have been found to be 20      inhibitors of Streptococcus Fab K. Fab I is not present in Streptococcus, and is not<br>
essential in Pseudomonas. There is also reason to believe that Fab I may not be essential in Enterococcus. In all of these organisms, another enoyl reductase, termed Fab K, is present (Heath, R. J.; Rock, CO., Nature (2000), 406,145-146). Pseudomonas and Enterococcus contain both Fab I and Fab K, and Streptococcus contains only Fab K. Consequently, pure 25      Fab I inhibitors are not expected to have antibacterial activity in these organisms. Thus, compounds that inhibit both Fab I and Fab K have the potential to be broad-spectrum antibacterial agents.<br>

Generally, compounds of this invention are prepared by:<br>
(i) reacting a compound of formula (HI) with a compound of formula (IV):<br><br>
wherein R2, R3 R4, R5 and X are as defined in formula (I), with any reactive functional groups protected, in the presence of EDC and HOBT;<br>

any reactive functional groups protected, in the presence of a palladium (II) salt, a<br>
phosphine ligand and base;<br>
15	and thereafter removing any protecting groups, and optionally forming a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
In particular, compounds of the formula (I) are prepared by the general methods described in the Schemes hereinafter.<br>
Scheme I<br><br>
(a) benzyl acrylate, Pd(OAc)2, P(o-tol)3, (i-Pr)2NEt, propionitrile; (b) 1.0 N NaOH, MeOH; (c) l-methyl-2-(methylaminomethyl)indole, EDC, HOBt • H20, Et3N, DMF.<br><br>
t WO 01/27103	PCT/US00/27844<br>
A suitable haloaromatic derivative, for instance for instance 2-amino-5-<br>
 bromopyridine (1-1), reacts with an appropriate <z ester for example benzyl></z>
aery late, in a Heck-type reaction (see Heck, Org. Reactions 1982, 27, 345) to afford 1-2.<br>
5      The reaction is mediated by a palladium(O) species, and generally is conducted in an inert<br>
solvent, such as CH3CN, propionitrile, or toluene, in the presence of an appropriate acid<br>
scavenger, such as triethylamine (Et3N) or diisopropylethylamine ((i-Pr)2NEt). Typical<br>
sources of the palladium(0) species include palladium (IT) acetate (Pd(0Ac)2) and<br>
palladium(II) chloride (PdCl2), and oftentimes phosphine ligands, for instance<br>
10      triphenylphosphine (PPh3&gt; or tri-ortho-tolylphosphine (P(tol)3), are included. The ethyl<br>
ester of 1-2 is hydrolyzed using aqueous base, for example, LiOH in aqueous THF or NaOH<br>
in aqueous methanol or ethanol, and the intermediate carboxylate salt is acidified with a<br>
suitable acid, for instance TFA or HCI, to afford the carboxylic acid 1-3. The carboxylic<br>
acid of 1-3 is converted to an activated form using, for example, EDC and HOBt, or SOQ2,<br>
15      and the activated form is subsequently reacted with an appropriate amine, for instance 1-<br>
methyl-2-(methylaminomethyl)indole, in a suitable solvent such as DMF, CH2CI2, or<br>
CH3CN, to afford 1-4. Depending on whether acid neutralization is required, an added<br>
base, such as triethylamine (Et3N), diisopropylethylamine ((i-Pr)2NEt), or pyridine, may be<br>
used,<br>
20	Many additional methods for converting a carboxylic acid to an amide are known,<br>
and can be found in standard reference books, such as "Compendium of Organic Synthetic<br>
Methods", Vol. I - VI (published by Wiley-Interscience), or Bodansky; "The Practice of<br>
Peptide Synthesis" (published by Springer-Verlag), which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
25	Amide coupling reagents as used herein denote reagents which may be used to form<br>
peptide bonds. Typical coupling methods employ carbodiimides, activated anhydrides and esters and acyl halides. Reagents such as EDC, DCC, DPPA, PPA, BOP reagent, HOBt, N-hydroxysuccinimide and oxalyl chloride are typical.<br>
Typically, the amine is coupled via its free amino group to an appropriate 30      carboxylic acid substrate using a suitable carbodiimide coupling agent, such as N,N' dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (DCC), optionally in the presence of catalysts such as 1-hydroxybenzptriazole (HOBt) and dimethylamino pyridine (DMAP). Other methods, such as the formation of activated esters, anhydrides or acid halides, of the free carboxyl of a suitably protected acid substrate, and subsequent reaction with the free amine, optionally in 35      the presence of a base, are also suitable. For example, a benzoic acid is treated in an<br>
anhydrous solvent, such as methylene chloride or tetrahydrofuran (THF), in the presence of<br><br>
VO 01/27103<br><br>
PCT/US00/27844<br><br>
a base, such as N-methylmorpholine, DMAP or a trialkyiamine, with isobutyl chloroformate to form the "activated anhydride", which is subsequently reacted with the free amine.<br>
Scheme II<br>
5-<br><br>
(a) NaH, Mel, DMF; (b) CH3NH2, H20, MeOH; (c) L1AIH4, THF.<br>
10      The amine coupling partners used in the present invention were prepared by established<br>
methods well-known to those of skill in the art. For example, amine 0-4 is prepared by the straightforward procedure outlined in Scheme II. Commercially available ethyl indole-2-carboxylate (II-l) is deprotonated with a suitable base, generally sodium hydride (NaH),. and the intermediate sodium salt is reacted with an appropriate alkylating agent, for<br>
15      instance methyl iodide, to afford II-2. Polar solvents such as DMF, THF, or mixtures thereof are generally preferred for this reaction. Compound II-2 can be conveniently converted to II-3 by reaction with an excess of an amine, such as methylamine, in a polar solvent, generally H2O or a mixture of H2O and methanol. Alternatively, the ester of II-2 can be saponified under standard conditions, typically with an alkali metal hydroxide such<br>
20      as LiOH, NaOH, or KOH, in an aqueous solvent, such as THF, ethanol, or methanol, and the resulting carboxylic acid can be converted to the desired amide. Typical methods for forming amides are described in Scheme I. Reduction of the amide II-3 to the amine II-4 is typically accomplished with lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH^ in refluxing THF, although many other methods can be used to reduce amides to amines.

The amine coupling partners used in the present invention can also be prepared by the reductive animation of an appropriate aldehyde (Scheme HI). This method, which is well-known to those of skill in the art, involves the initial conversion of an aldehyde to an<br>
10      intermediate imine, which is subsequently reduced, oftentimes in situ, to afford the amine. For example, the commercially-available aldehyde HI-1 reacts with an appropriate amine, for instance methylamine, to afford an intermediate imine (not shown), which is reduced in situ to amine III-2 by reaction with a suitable reducing agent, usually sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium (triacetoxy)borohydride. Frequently, the reaction is<br>

Cloning of S. aureus FabI:<br>
The/aW gene was cloned from the chromosomal DNA of S. aureus strain 10      WCUH29 using the polymerase chain reaction. Amplification was performed using Taq DNA polymerase (BRL) and the following primers: 5-CGCCTCGAGATGTTAAATCTTGAAAACAAAACATATGTC-3' and 5-CGCGGATCCAATCAAGTCAGGTTGAAATATCCA-3' (Xhol and BamHl sites underlined). The resulting fragment was then digested with Xhol and BamVH and ligated<br>
15      into Xhol- and BamHI-digested expression vector pET- 16b (Novagen), producing pET-HisiQ-fabl. The gene sequence offabl was confirmed by automated cycle sequencing using an Applied Biosystems model 377-machine. The untagged version of pET-fabl was constructed by digesting pET-Uis\Q-fabI with Ncol and Ndel to remove a 97 bp fragment encoding the His 10 tag, the factor Xa cleavage site and the first 8 amino acids of FabI, and<br>

between the initiator methionine and the lysine at position 2. This plasmid was called pET-fabl. The linker was made by annealing the following two oligonucleotides: 5-CATGGGCTTAAATCTTGAAAACAAAACA-3' and 5'-TATGTTTTGTTTTCAAGATTTAAGCC-3'. The linker sequence in pET-fabl was<br>

FabK catalyses the reduction of enoyl-ACPs with the concomitant oxidation of 5      NADH. The reduction of crotonoyl-ACP to butyryl-ACP can be monitored by following the change in absorbance at 340 nm as NADH is oxidized.<br>
Assays were carried out in Costar 3696 half-area plates in a final assay volume of 150 uL on a Spectramax platereader.

According to the instant invention, the preferred Fab I and Fab K enzyme inhibition assays use crotonoyl-ACP, rather than crotonoyl CoA, as a substrate. Thus, this invention comprises the preparation and purification of crotonoyl-ACP and the use of this purified<br>
10      enzyme in F*b I and Fab K enzyme inhibition assays. Crotonoyl-ACP was synthesised using 5. pneumoniae ACP synthase to catalyse the addition of a crotonoyl group from crotonoyl CoA to E.coli apo-acyl carrier protein (ACP). In a further aspect of this invention, it is contemplated that an apo-acyl carrier protein from any bacterial species, such as from Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, can be used in the<br>
15      preparation of crotonoyl-ACP. This synthesis was carried out in the presence of<br>
magnesium chloride in NaHEPES, pH 7.5. The reaction was complete in 2 hours at a reaction temperature of about 20-30°C, preferably at 23°C.<br>
The purified crotonoyl-ACP prepared above is then used in the Fab I and Fab K assays to determine the inhibitors of the instant invention. Assays may be carried out, for<br>
20      example, in Costar 3696 half-area plates, preferably at a final assay volume of 150 ul on a Spectramax platereader. Preferred substrates used in the methods of the invention are NADH, NADPH, an NADH analogue and crotonoyl-ACP. Further provided are preferred methods comprising the step of incubating substrates with Fab I or Fab K in 100 mM N-[2-acetamido]-2 iminodiacetic acid (ADA), pH 6.5. This reaction may be monitored at 340<br>
25      nm, among other wavelengths.<br>
The examples which follow are intended in no way to limit the scope of this invention, but are provided to illustrate how to make and use the compounds of this invention. Many other embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
