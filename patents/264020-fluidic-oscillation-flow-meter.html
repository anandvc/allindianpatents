				<td>FLUIDIC OSCILLATION FLOW METER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to an apparatus for measuring the<br>
amount of fluid flowing in a channel, and more particularly to a fluidic oscillation<br>
flow meter for determining the flow rate of a gas.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Fluidic oscillator flow meters are well known in the art. See for example,<br>
Horton et al., U.S. Patent Number 3,185,166; Testerman et al„ U.S. Patent Number<br>
3,273,377; Taplin, U.S. Patent Number 3,373,600; Adams et al„ U.S. Patent<br>
Number 3,640,133; Villarroel et al., U.S. Patent Number 3,756,068; Zupanick,<br>
U.S. Patent Number 4,150,561; Bauer, U.S. Patent Number 4,244,230; and<br>
Drzewiecki, U.S. Patent Number 6,553,844. These conventional fluidic oscillators<br>
comprise a fluidic amplifier having two channels with the outputs fed back to the<br>
input to produce a free running oscillation wherein the fluid alternatively flows<br>
through one channel then the other by means of the fluid fed back being<br>
transversely applied to the input stream thereby forcing the input to the other<br>
channel.<br>
[0003] Most fluidic oscillator flow meters measure some characteristic, e.g.,<br>
volumetric flow, density, quality, enthalpy, and bulk modulus of a fluid. In the<br>
case of measuring volumetric flow, this is typically accomplished by measuring the<br>
frequency of the fluid shifting from one channel to the other. The frequency is<br>
linearly related to the volumetric flow because the flow transit time is related to<br>
flow velocity. Since the amplifier nozzle area is known, the product of velocity<br>
and area yields volumetric flow. In most cases, the acoustic feedback time for<br>
most fluids can be designed to be only a few percent of the total flow transit time.<br>
1<br><br>
[0004] In U.S. Patent Number 6,076,392, the constituents of a gas mixture are<br>
determined by measuring both the flow of the fluid sample stream and the speed of<br>
sound in the fluid. A measure of the volumetric flow is required to determine the<br>
properties density and viscosity of the fluid sample, and a measure of the speed of<br>
sound is required to determine the property specific heat of the fluid.<br>
[0005] In "A Fluidic-Electronic Hybrid System for Measuring the Composition<br>
of Binary Mixtures", Anderson et al., Ind. Eng. Chem. Fundam., Vol . 11, No. 3,<br>
1972, it has been shown that the density of a gas may be determined by use of an<br>
oscillation flow meter for gasses with temperatures ranging from -20 to +120°C.<br>
The speed of a pressure pulse traveling through a gas (sonic velocity) is<br>
proportional to the square root of the gas density. However, the disclosed system<br>
requires a separate liquid vaporizer.<br>
[0006] Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a fluidic oscillation flow meter<br>
integrated within a fuel cell for measuring the volumetric flow rate of elevated<br>
temperature vapor. Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of the<br>
present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description of<br>
the invention and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings and this background of the invention.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] An integrated vaporizer and flow meter is provided for determining the<br>
flow rate of a gas. The apparatus comprises a housing forming a vaporization<br>
chamber for converting a fluid into a gas vapor when subjected to heat. An<br>
oscillation flow meter is formed within the housing, thereby being integrated with<br>
the vaporization chamber, for receiving the gas vapor and providing a frequency<br>
signal indicative of the rate of flow of the gas vapor.<br>
2<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0008] The present invention will hereinafter be described in conjunction with<br>
the following drawing figures, wherein like numerals denote like elements, and<br>
[0009] FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a fluidic oscillation flow meter in<br>
accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention; and<br>
[0010] FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a fuel cell system including the fluidic<br>
oscillation flow meter of FIG. 1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0011] The following detailed description of the invention is merely exemplary<br>
in nature and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of<br>
the invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any theory<br>
presented in the preceding background of the invention or the following detailed<br>
description of the invention.<br>
[0012] Referring to FIG. 1, a gas oscillation flow meter 10 in accordance with an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a vaporization chamber<br>
14 and a flow meter 16 within a housing 12. Ideally the device should be able to<br>
operate from a minimum of the boiling point temperature of the measured fluid to<br>
a maximum of the temperature of a secondary process. The housing 12 comprises<br>
a material able to withstand high temperatures, such as a metal, but would<br>
preferably comprise ceramic. The vaporization chamber 12 optionally includes a<br>
porous material 18 spaced throughout. The porous material 18 may comprise<br>
zirconia or alumina, for example. The porous material 18 improves the spreading<br>
of the fluid resulting in an improved uniform evaporation.<br>
[0013] The flow meter 16 comprises a flow meter inlet nozzle 26 and first and<br>
second diversion channels 28, 30. Vents 32, 34, 36, and 38 (output vias) are<br>
accessible through output channels 42, 44, 46, 48. Piezo chamber 52 is spaced<br>
between the first diversion channel 28 and a first return channel 54, and piezo<br>
chamber 56 is spaced between the second diversion channel 30 and a second return<br>
3<br><br>
channel 58. A piezo device 62 is positioned within piezo chamber 52 and a piezo<br>
device 64 is positioned within piezo chamber 56. In some embodiments, e.g., a<br>
multi-layer ceramic embodiment, the various elements may reside on different<br>
levels. For simplicity, the various components are shown in FIG. 1 as being on the<br>
same level.<br>
[0014] In operation, a liquid is provided into the chamber 14 at the inlet 20.<br>
The liquid may comprise, for example, a methanol and water mixture (such as may<br>
be used in a fuel cell system to be described subsequently in more detail). The<br>
liquid will saturate a portion of the porous material 18. Heat 22 is applied to the<br>
chamber 14, either by actively heating the chamber or by reclaiming waste heat<br>
from a thermally coupled secondary process, resulting in a gas vapor exiting the<br>
chamber 14 at outlet 24. The desired temperature of heat is above the maximum<br>
boiling temperature of the inlet fluid and below the thermal constraints of the<br>
construction materials.<br>
[0015] The gas vapor exiting the outlet 24 enters the flow meter inlet nozzle 26<br>
having a certain velocity. As the gas vapor proceeds into the flow meter 16, the<br>
majority of the gas vapor will enter either the first or second diversion channel.<br>
For example, the gas vapor might enter diversion channel 28, and proceed around<br>
through piezo chamber 52 and first return channel 54, passing through the first<br>
nozzle 66. As the gas vapor passes through first nozzle 66, it impacts the gas<br>
vapor entering at flow meter inlet nozzle 26, deflecting the entering gas vapor and<br>
causing the majority, of the entering gas vapor to now divert to the second<br>
diversion channel 30; .The gas vapor would then proceed around through piezo<br>
chamber 56 and second return channel 58, passing through the second nozzle 68.<br>
As the gas vapor passes through second nozzle 68, it impacts the gas vapor<br>
entering at flow meter inlet nozzle 26, deflecting the entering gas vapor and<br>
causing the majority of the entering gas vapor to again enter the first diversion<br>
channel 28. This switching from one side of the flow meter 16 to the other will<br>
continue in a cyclic fashion having a certain frequency depending on the rate of<br>
flow of the gas as long as gas vapor enters the flow meter 16.<br>
4<br><br>
[0016] As gas vapor fills the flow meter 16 and the pressure builds, gas vapor<br>
will enter output channels 42, 44, 46, 48 and exit.the flow meter 16 through vents<br>
32, 34, 36, 38. The vents 32, 34, 36, 38 may converge into a single outlet (not<br>
shown). Additionally, though four vents 32, 34, 36, 38 are shown, any number of<br>
vents may be used. Typically, an equal number of vents would be positioned on<br>
both sides.<br>
[0017] As the gas vapor passes through piezo chambers 52, 56, the pressure<br>
pulse is sufficient to trigger piezo devices 62, 64 thus generating an ac electrical<br>
signal 60 indicative of the frequency of the oscillatory nature of the flow meter 16.<br>
The frequency of the gas shifting from one channel 28, 30 to the other is<br>
approximately linearly related to the volumetric flow.<br>
[0018] The gas oscillation flow meter 10 may be used most effectively in any<br>
application that consumes liquid fuel and operates at temperatures above the<br>
boiling point of that fuel, e.g., internal combustion engine, microreactors, and more<br>
specifically fuel cells. Fuel cells are electrochemical cells in which a free energy<br>
change resulting from a fuel oxidation reaction is converted into electrical energy.<br>
Reformed Hydrogen Fuel Cells (RHFCs) utilize hydrogen fuel processed from<br>
liquid or gaseous hydrocarbon fuels, such as methanol, using a reactor, called a<br>
fuel reformer, for converting the fuel into hydrogen. Methanol is the preferred fuel<br>
for use in fuel reformers for portable applications because it is easier to reform into<br>
hydrogen gas at a relatively low temperature compared to other hydrocarbon fuels<br>
such as ethanol, gasoline, or butane. The reforming or converting of methanol into<br>
hydrogen usually takes place by one of three different types of reforming. These<br>
three types are steam reforming, partial oxidation reforming, and autothermal<br>
reforming. Of these types, steam reforming is the preferred process for methanol<br>
reforming because it is the easiest to control and produces a higher concentration<br>
of hydrogen output by the reformer, at a lower temperature, thus lending itself to<br>
favored use.<br>
5<br><br>
[0019] Utilizing multilayer laminated ceramic technology, ceramic components<br>
and systems are now being developed for use in microfluidic chemical processing<br>
and energy management systems, e.g., fuel cells. Monolithic structures formed of<br>
these laminated ceramic components are inert and stable to chemical reactions and<br>
capable of tolerating high temperatures. These structures can also provide for<br>
miniaturized components, with a high degree of electrical and electronic circuitry<br>
or components embedded or integrated into the ceramic structure for system<br>
control and functionality. Additionally, the ceramic materials used to form<br>
ceramic components or devices, including microchanneled configurations, are<br>
considered to be excellent candidates for catalyst supports and so are<br>
extraordinarily compatible for use in microreactor devices for generating hydrogen<br>
used in conjunction with miniaturized fuel cells. An example of a fuel cell formed<br>
in a ceramic material is disclosed in U.S. Patent Number 6,569,553.<br>
[0020] A simplified block diagram of a fuel cell system, including an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the fluidic oscillation flow meter 10, is shown in FIG. 2. A<br>
mixture 70 of methanol and water is supplied by a fuel pump 72 via fuel line 71 to<br>
the fluidic oscillation flow meter 10. The mixture 70 of methanol and water is<br>
converted to a gas vapor as previously explained. Heat 22 is supplied to the gas<br>
oscillation flow meter 10 by the waste heat of a fuel cell 92 (an electric heater, not<br>
shown, may provide heat for startup). A frequency signal 60 is generated, as<br>
previously discussed, as well as a vapor temperature signal 73, and supplied to<br>
micro-controller 74. The micro-controller 74 forwards a control signal 76 to the<br>
fuel pump 72 for controlling the amount of fuel pumped in response to the<br>
frequency signal 60. Each frequency relates proportionally to a specific flow rate.<br>
The pump control circuitry 74 determines the flow rate based on the frequency<br>
signal 60 and the vapor temperature signal 73 and directs the fuel pump 72 via the<br>
control signal 76 to increase, decrease, or maintain the fuel flow rate.<br>
[0021] The gas vapor exits the fluidic oscillation flow meter 10 via line 81 and<br>
enters a reformer section 82 of a fuel processor 80. A first air pump 84 pumps<br>
preferably air, though any oxidant could be used, to a mixer 86, for mixing the air<br>
6<br><br>
with fuel received from the fuel cell 92 via line 85. The micro-controller 74<br>
determines the speed of the flow rate of the first air pump 84 and controls the<br>
speed thereof with the combustor pump control signal 81. The mixture of air and<br>
fuel is fed via line 87 to a combustor 88 for supplying heat to the reformer 82. A<br>
heater control signal 79 from the micro-controller 74 to the combustor 88 controls<br>
the amount of heat generated by the combustor 88 for optimum operation of the<br>
reformer 82. The reformer supplies hydrogen vapor via line 83 to the anode 72 of<br>
the fuel cell 92.<br>
[0022] The fuel cell 92 comprises a fuel electrode, or anode 94, and an oxidant<br>
electrode, or cathode 96, separated by an ion-conducting electrolyte 98. The<br>
electrodes 94, 96 are connected electrically to a load (such as an electronic circuit)<br>
by an external circuit conductor (not shown). In the circuit conductor, electric<br>
current is transported by the flow of electrons, whereas in the electrolyte 98, it is<br>
transported by the flow of ions, such as the hydrogen ion (H ) in acid electrolytes,<br>
or the hydroxyl ion (OH) in alkaline electrolytes. In theory, any substance<br>
capable of chemical oxidation that can be supplied continuously (as a gas or fluid)<br>
can be oxidized galvanically as the fuel at the anode of a fuel cell. Similarly, the<br>
oxidant, supplied via line 103 by second air pump 102, can be any material that can<br>
be reduced at a sufficient rate. Gaseous hydrogen has become the fuel of choice<br>
for most applications, because of its high reactivity in the presence of suitable<br>
catalysts and because of its high power density. Similarly, at the fuel cell cathode<br>
96, the most common oxidant is gaseous oxygen, which is readily and<br>
economically available from air for fuel cells used in terrestrial applications.<br>
When gaseous hydrogen and oxygen are used as fuel and oxidant, the electrodes<br>
94, 96 are porous to permit the gas-electrolyte junction area to be as great as<br>
possible. The electrodes 94, 96 must be electronic conductors, and possess the<br>
appropriate reactivity to give significant reaction rates. At the anode 94, incoming<br>
hydrogen gas is oxidized to produce hydrogen ions (protons) and electrons. Since<br>
the electrolyte is a non-electronic conductor, the electrons flow away from the<br>
anode 94 via an external electrical circuit. At the cathode 96, oxygen gas is<br>
reduced and reacts with the hydrogen ions migrating through the electrolyte 98 and<br>
7<br><br>
the incoming electrons from the external circuit to produce water as a byproduct.<br>
The byproduct water is typically expelled as vapor at elevated temperatures via<br>
line 99. The overall reaction that takes place in the fuel cell is the sum of the<br>
anode 94 and cathode 96 reactions, with part of the free energy of reaction released<br>
directly as electrical energy. The difference between this available free energy and<br>
the heat of reaction is produced as heat at the temperature of the fuel cell 92. It can<br>
be seen that as long as hydrogen and oxygen are supplied to the fuel cell 92, the<br>
flow of electric current will be sustained by electronic flow in the external circuit<br>
and ionic flow in the electrolyte.<br>
[0023] In practice, a number of these unit fuel cells 92 are normally stacked or<br>
'ganged' together to form a fuel cell assembly. A number of individual cells are<br>
electrically connected in series by abutting the anode current collector of one cell<br>
with the cathode current collector of its nearest neighbor in the stack.<br>
[0024] The micro-controller 74 controls the overall operation of the system. For<br>
example, the operating point of the fuel cell 92 is controlled by a heater control<br>
signal 91 from the micro-controller 74 in response to a temperature signal 93 and a<br>
cell voltage signal 95 from the fuel cell 92. The amount of oxidant supplied to the<br>
cathode 96 by the second air pump (or blower) 102 is controlled by the cathode<br>
blower signal 101 from the micro-controller. Exhaust from the fuel cell 92 via line<br>
99 through dilution fan 106 is controlled by the micro-processor 74 via dilution fan<br>
signal 105. A DC-DC converter 108 receives electrical current produced by the<br>
fuel cell 92 and provides power to the micro-controller 74.<br>
