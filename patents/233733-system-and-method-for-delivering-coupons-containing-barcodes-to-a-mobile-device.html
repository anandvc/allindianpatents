OPTIMISED  M1SSAGSS   CONTAINING  BARCODE   INFORMATION  FOR  MOBILE  RECEIVING DEVICES<br>
Optimised Mobile Barcode Messages<br>
The present invention relates to coupons, in particular delivering coupons containing barcodes to a mobile device.<br>
The display of a mobile device may be used to ge-arate bar codes for reading by a conventional bar code scanner. This has uses in coupon and ticket applications. The mobile solution has a number of unique aspects v\en compared to traditional methods such as paper cr internet email. These include:<br>
-	Instant Delivery. The barcode is delivered to ne<br>
mobile phone almost iirjnediately,<br>
-	Reach. The consumer can be reached wherever t-  - are.<br>
-	Increased Redemption. Unlike paper coupons wh  . may be<br>
left behind, a mobile phone is normally csrriec<br>
everywhere.<br>
G3 Patent .Application Number G32361570 to Briti.	Airways<br>
discloses a method of operating a ticketing Sys-	. A<br>
reservation centre generates data representing •	icket<br>
which is broadcast to a mobile station e.g. a c-	ilar<br>
CONHRMATIONCOPY<br><br>
phone. The data from the mobile station can then be used to verify t,ne transaction e.g. via a reader linked to a reservations computer. The tickst data can be sent in the form of a text e.g. SMS message or in brovjser readable format and is preferably in machine readable code. Preferably, the reader is an optical bar or - pin code reader. The system is preferably used for air travel. The problems with the disclosed system are that:<br>
-	There doesn't appear to be a way of enforcing single<br>
redemption of a ticket (for security) .<br>
-	It relies on a "SIM toolkit" application in the handset<br>
to translate the ticket number into a barcode image. It<br>
would be advantageous to deliver the actual barcode image<br>
in the message. The SIM toolkit has a number of problems.<br>
Many network operators discourage or prevent downloading<br>
of applications into the SIM card. SIM storage is limited<br>
and it's harder to update the software on all of the<br>
phones.<br>
International- Patent Application number WO 01/95267 to Nokia relates to the*provision of goods and services," * Receipt data corresponding to a purchase of predetermined goods or a service are downloaded to a mobile handset and displayed as a bar code. A vending delivery station receives the receipt data from the handset and enables the provision of the purchase goods or service to the customer. In one example, cinstuS tickets are DrovM-*4 printed by a ticket printer- The problem with the system is that it requires the consumer to collect tickets which are printed by a vending station before entry. It wculd be advantageous to simply treat the phone / barcode as a ticket which is scanned at the actual entry point, t*us eliminating the queueing / inconvenience and printing.<br><br>
The publication discloses MPEG film previews  when browsing   the cinema   options.   This   is  net  however   included as   parr  of the  ticket.   It  would be advantageou-s  to provide multimedia tickets  to phones  that can  support their viewing.<br>
G3  Patent  Application Number GB2362012  to  IBM  discloses Paying  for goods and services without  needing zo carry nany cards.  A customer,   who has registered  infr. rmation such a  credit  card number with a server,   receives payment information as an  identification code when he/,me pays for a purchase at  a  store.   The payment  information can be transmitted wirelessly to  the  cash  register   in   store, or displayed  as  a two-dimensional barcode  on disp.. -.y of the terminal  and read by  a barcode reader of  the c;   h register.   The payment  information  is -associate:;   with sales  information  and  sent  to the  server  which     ssociates the payment  information with the registered in:   rmation for the  customer,   seeks  approval from  the  appr-,   riata credit  institution,   and sends  an approval  numbf      to the store.   A ticket processing system embodiments  .     also described.<br>
The problem with both the Nokia and ISM system:.	s that<br>
they don't  facilitate operation with a variety         phones<br>
with different messaging formats and display o,.<br>
corarrunication cspabi.Uti-23.   For exainpls,   it wo.       be<br>
advantageous  fcr one  system to support mobile r.	;es that<br>
do  cr do not  support   "Picture Messaging"   or Blv	ooth.<br>
In  this document/   including the specification E       claims, the term coupon includes vouchers ar.d tickets.<br><br>

With reference to Figure 1, the application 102 interfaces to the core technology platform 104 : -advanced mobile messaging using XML content d»"&gt; ^-T-PH over the internet http protocol.<br><br>
a  hvooage .^IOC^-^O^   J.L^  J.^   o^arcsc  aurcntaticaiiy in response   to   the  delivery of .ir^ssage   content   to   a specified   URL.<br>
The message  processor receives  the mobile phone  number, barcode  number and syrnbclogy,   handset/device  type and additional  message  content  for delivery  to  the device. The  handset/device   type is  optional.   When  it  is  provided, it   is  stored  in  the  database  against  the mobile  number. In  the  case  of future messages  for that mobile  number where the  device type is not .provided,   then the recorded device  type   is  retrieved.   This  avoids   the  need  to  capture the  handset/device  type or. multiple  occasions  or  for different  purposes  such as  coupon or  ticket delivery.<br>
The message  content   is provided in XML  format,   and delivered  using   the   http post  protocol.   The  XML   is   a list of  messages   containing  information  including:<br>
-	Mobile  phone number<br>
-	Barcode   number  and  syiriology<br>
-	Additional  text  content   (optional)<br>
-	Recipient  details  such as  Name   (optional)<br>
-	Handset  and Network details   (optional)<br>
The Message  Processor 106 processes  the messages  and stores them in the database for  retrieval by the  Queue Control "i »&gt;*   i "■ $<br>
The   Barcode   5::wC-der   103   is  invoked to   ce^\^=  hrrccna images from -he barcode number ar.ci syrnbolcgy.   The  imaaes are  stored  as  Pictures  in the database  110.<br><br>
Customer systems can be integrated with the mobile messaging platform through the message processor 106.<br>
The database 110 stores the following core entities: ' *<br>
-	Barcodes - Barcodes with a particular number and<br>
symbology<br>
-	Pictures - Pictures (may represent a barcode image)<br>
-	Handset - information on a particular handset including<br>
owner details, mobile number, model, etc.<br>
-	Messages - Outbound and inbound messages<br>
-	Gateways - Network messaging gateways<br>
The barcode encoder 108 generates the barcode i:~age for a . specified barcode ar.d symbology. The resulting picture is stored in the database 110 in binary form. The encoder supports both linear barcodes such as EAN-8, E/V.-13 upc- •" A, etc. as well as 2D barcodes such as DataMatr:.&gt;:  P3F-417, etc.<br>
•A similar approach can be used for other advance message types such as smart tickets.<br>
The Message Engine 112 starts a separate queue . .itrcller 114 for each message priority level (1-3). The  ssage engine 112 also starts the gateways 120.<br>
The Queue Controllers 114 poll the database lie periodic intervals to retrieve all rr-essages wit  -.he relevant prion.y* The messages are then fed th..  :~h r'no Message Opt.inissr 115 and Message Routers 118 --  out through ths selected gateway 120.<br><br>
The Message Optimiser 116 chcos^s the optimal message format depending on the capabilities of the target handset.- For basic handsets, a. simole text messaae will be delivered. Otherwise, subject to the handset supporting the required display dimensions and colour depth, pictures are delivered using the richest format available.<br>
The Message Optimiser 116 overcomes many of the problems inherent with known methods. In particular,, the wide range of device types/models arid message protocols restrict rr.any alternative solutions to providing support for only a limited number of users. Devices can vary in cheir support for particular picture messaging protocols such as Nokia Smart Messaging cr EMS (Enhanced Message Service) . Device display capabilities such as display resolution also constrain the barcode symbologies and codes that may be represented. The present invention enables a comprehensive support of the installed base of devices to be orovidecL<br>
Ikl<br>
The Message Optimiser 116 takes the barccde image generated by the Barcode Encoder 108, and device type and optimises the messages for transmission based on the<br>
capabilities of the target handset.<br>
"■vhere the target device dees net; have sufficient capability zr. r^r.eive or represent the mess-jicye correctly, the concern: is downgraded accordingly. Ultimately, for a handset that supports only SMS text messaging, then the barcode number and associated text is transmitted. E.g. xx3arcode . Ticket fcr Event at Venue on Da:a". In the case of a text-only barcode, the barcode is<br><br>
redeemed by  keying-in the  number.   This  is  also  the common,    automatic  approach  when  *  barcode   image   fails  to<br>
** '"* P T\ .<br>
The   downgrading  of  the  content  is  controlled  bv  a hierarchy  of  rules  based  on   the  device  capability.   This includes:<br>
1.	MViS   support<br>
2.	EMS   support<br>
3.	Nokia Smart Message support<br>
4.	Display Resolution<br>
If  the  display  resolution   is  insufficient  to  represent the  barcode,   then  the message is downgraded  to  text.<br>
A  table   of  device   attributes  associated with  a  device<br>
.-■*•■<br>
type is maintained ir. the database 110. This table includes the following information;<br>
1.	Handset/Device Type<br>
2.	MMS Support<br>
3.	EMS Support<br>
4.	Nokia Smart Message Support<br>
5.	Display Resolution<br>
6.	Colour Depth (1 = mono)<br>
7.	Bluetooth support<br>
8.	Java support<br>
Where the handoac model is not kr:own, then the capabilities of -he database device entry with id of "DSFAULT" are s?suited. This enables such behaviour to be controlled, i.e. whether to assume ths^cr. unknown handset supports Nokia picture messages or not.<br><br>
The barcode image can also be a 20 barcode, A 2D barcode enables a larger amount of information to bs contained v:ithin the barcode.<br>
If the dsvice has a multimedia capability, then messages can also be enhanced by the addition of moving video, colour i.mages, and audio clips. Mobile phones n~y support MH5 (Multimedia Messaging Service). In this case a ticket for a music concert could include a short piece of video of the band, an image of the cover of the new album, and an audio clip for a recently released track in addition to the barcode. Similarly, in order to promote - brand, a coupon could contain, a video clip and audio f re:~ a TV advertisement in addition to the barccde. In severity applications, a photograph could be included w.;a the barcode.<br>
The message router 118 chooses the optimal net'	zk<br>
gatev/ay based'on rules stored in the database.	.ilticle<br>
gateway connections can be supported for load	-ancing<br>
and scalability* Wheire there is ~iore than one	risible<br>
route, the gateway with the lowest latency is	:sen.<br>
- The gateways 120 are the route to the external	;s<br>
gateways or SMS centres over a network. The g:	ays 120<br>
maintain a queue of messages sorted bv priori:	A number<br>
of different SMS gateway technologies ara SUD:	ed<br>
including XML/http, SMP?, GSM terminals, etc.<br>
Alternatively .she gateway 120 can be an email	ew~v,<br>
delivering the messages 52 an sir,ail message, r	uires .cay<br>
be attached as a GIF image.<br><br>
rhe SMS gateway 122 is a gateway to the mobile network short messaging service. Alternatiyaly, this nay be a direct connection to the mobile network operator's massaging centre. The SMS gateway may support enhanced<br>
	-,_., ^J-, si.cn a^ ^lCuUic messages. The SMS gateway<br>
may be a multi-media message (HMS) gateway for delivery of multimedia messages including high-resoluticp. colour images and video.<br>
The mobile handset 124 can be a mobile phone or other wireless-enabled device such as a PDA.<br>
The core technology platform 1C4 supports processes in a number of applications. Additional components are defined to support the specific steps in such solutions. Thus the ., system also may include an Autc.uatic Download exponent 126_and a Random Barcode Generator component i:: for customisation of the system as described below ."or rstail coupon and security applications respectively.<br>
with reference to Figure 2 the core mobile ba^ ■-&gt;■= generation, delivery, and redemption process 2'  is depicted.<br>
The consumer cpts-in to receive barcodes by re	rtaring<br>
(step 202) with the supplier. Registration may	- through<br>
a variety of channels including internet web s.<br>
telephens csll centre, paper forms, or text xr.e	ae.<br>
The registration details are scored in t^e d.'t   ^ fet-.n 204). The da-cabase contains customer contact a1 profiling information. This information indue--<br><br>
-	Customer  details   and  contact   information  including<br>
mobilG   number  and  possibly r.arcs,   smail   address,   postal<br>
address,   photograph,   etc.<br>
-	Customer  demographics  including age,   sex     etc.<br>
-	Customer  preferences<br>
-	Customer  buying  history<br>
In the Target Profile step (step 205), an offer for c product, service, or information is matched with the database of customer profiles. The matching criteria may include one or nore of:<br>
-	Demographics<br>
-	Preferences/Product Criteria<br>
-	Buying History<br>
The  result   of  the  match  is  a   list  of rricbile  numbers  for ccn.tact   purposes  and  profile   information  for  messaae personalisation.<br>
The   specified barcodes   are generated  from the number(s) provided and delivered   (step  208)   to the list of mobile numbers  using the messaging  platform.   This step  is expanded towards the  right hand side  of Figure 2.<br>
After inputting and  storing   (step 210)   device  attributes defining the device  capabilities  in  the database  and inputting   (seep 212)   a device  type  identifier   (e.g.  .-rodel cf  mobile   fphon=),   the  system generates   (step 214} m-ssscge  data  comprising a coupon  ar.d optionally  the c;sv2.cs   type   lac-ntiiier.<br>
The  system retrieves   (step 21S)   device  attributes defining the device  capabilities  corresponding to the<br><br>
mobile device type identifier and generates (step 218) an optimised .message responsive to the msss&amp;ge data and the retrieved capabilities.<br>
Finally in the delivery step, the system transmits (step 220) the optimised message to zha target mobile device via one or more gateways through a network.<br>
The delivery of a barcode is recorded in the database for subsequent authentication purposes.<br>
The barcode is redeemed (step 222) in the same way as any product containing a barcode, by scanning the mobile phone display using a conventional barcode scanner. An alternative to scanning the barcode for redemption could be to use Bluetooth or an alternative radio or electromagnetic transmission method.<br>
The barcode is authenticated {sz%p 224) by examining the barcode delivery records and retrieving the associated customer details. The customer details, possibly including a photograph, may be displayed on a computer display for human validation.<br>
Barcoco redemption is recorded in the database for audit<br>
purposes.<br>
s<br>
If this barcode is to b-s redeemed only once, then tha barcode record in the database is marked as redeemed, and cannot be redeemed again.<br>
With reference ;o Figure 3, the redemption process 3DD is shown. In the case of a coupon, the barcode is sent to<br><br>
the mobile  device  302  and   is   ^s^eH   - -   • u.<br>

in  the  database  is  then marked =.3   V-d=p-oH'   x. ^  ^<br>
&gt;.~&gt;J -0     ivCse,:,sci     to  prevent<br>
multiple  redemption of the  same barcode.<br>
Specific   solutions  based  on the core  technology platform are  defined and  will be  presents* below  for  a   number of markets:<br>
-	Retail Coupons<br>
-	Ticketing<br>
-	Security<br>
With reference to Figure 4, the mobile barcode solution process 4 00 is customised for the retail coupon market. The mobile barcode represents a discount coupon which is • redeemed by scanning in a retail outlet.<br>
Barcodes representing discount coupons may be redeemed multiple tinas without any authentication. Indeed, viral marketing may be encouraged through forwarding of the mobile barcode to friends and family.<br>
-a :^'J^° •■' •' ancl o- sacri or ui:e steos h*v
corrjnon with Figure 2 are cescn'-ed above.<br>
The Coupon Download ("pull") (step 402)_is initiated by a consumer via a number of channels including:<br>
-	Web site<br>
-	Telephone<br><br>
-   Mobile   text  Message   sent   to  a  supplier mobile   number<br>
In  each  case,   the   recipient's mobile number  is  captured in  order  that  the mobile barcode coupon may ba  delivered * (step   404).<br>
The  solution builds  on  the  core process  with  an Automatic Download  component   126  shown  in Figure   1.   The  automatic download  component   126  is   invoked  from  a web  site, automated telephone  system,   or through  receipt  of a text message.   The  component   126  takes  the  mobile  number and barcode  number and  invokes  the Message   Processor  106 using  XML/http  to  deliver  the mobile  barcode.<br>
With reference to  Figure  5,   the mobile  barcode  solution process   500  is  customised  for  ticketing  applications. The mobile barcode  represents  a  ticket  thafis   redeemed by scanning  the phone  display at the venue.<br>
Specific   steps  in  the  mobile  ticketing   solution  are:<br>
-	Deliver   Promotional  Message   (step  502)<br>
-	Purchase   (step 504)<br>
With reference to  Figure 5,   the first  steps   (down to but not  including Purchase   (step  50-1))   are  optional.<br>
An  example promotional message might be:<br>
Ticket  available for Sat.   Call  0800   123455  or  reply "1"<br>
The promotional message may be delivered as  a  simple text message,   or might be s richer message including text and pictures.<br><br>
The purchase may be achieved through * number of channels including:<br>
-	Ticket sales call centre<br>
-	7Jeb site<br>
-	Text message reply<br>
Payment m.sy be received through one- of many existing . methods including credit card zr.d existing account. Whan payment is accepted, then the rr.obile barcode ticket is delivered (step 506).<br>
As the Message Processor supports simple text messages as v/ell as more sophisticated data (barcodes) , the promotional message is delivered using the core platform.<br>
The ticket purchase is achieved using traditional methods.<br>
/?ith reference to Figure 6, the mobile barcode solution process 600 is customised for security applications. The mobile barcode represents an identity that is validated by scanning the phone display. Upon validation, access can be granted to a secure location, or a product can be provided.<br>
.here is an automatic rar-doni barccds gsnerstior; steo GO 2. A new random bcrcode may optionally be generated and delivered every time a barcode is redeemed.<br>
The solution builds on the core process with the Random bsrcoca generator component 129 shown in Figure 1. The Random barcode generator 128 automatically generates a<br><br>
random barcode number. The barcode nuir.ber generate <s unique amongst unredeemed barcodes in the database.></s>
Key features of the solutions described herein are:<br>
-	Targeting using a customer profile database<br>
-	Dynamic barcode image Generation ^v-~™ u<br>
y  . '■««t.on ;rcm oarcode number<br>
and symbology<br>
-	Delivery of barcode to mobile phone or other wireless<br>
device<br>
-	Redemption and authentication of barcode by scanning<br>
display<br>
-	Specific processes for particular applications<br>
The solutions described above are implanted using Java 2 Enterprise Edition, SQL, and XML (extensible markup language). Alternative technologies could however be used to implement the solutions described above.<br>
