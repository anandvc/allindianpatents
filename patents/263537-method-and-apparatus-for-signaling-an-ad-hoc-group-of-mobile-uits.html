				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>Various embodiments are described for signaling an ad-hoc group of mobile units (MUs). The ad-hoc group may be a group of MUs for which signaling awaits transmission via a wireless communication resource (111). Signaling such a group involves deriving a mobile unit group identifier (MUGI) by combining individual mobile unit identifiers (MUIs) of the targeted ad-hoc group. The individual MUIs are either an identifier of each MU or derived from an identifier of each MU. The derived MUGI is then included in combined signaling that is transmitted (by RAN 121, e.g.) via the wireless communication resource. A receiving MU (101) determines whether the MUGI could have been derived from its MUI in combination with at least one other MU&amp;quot;s MUI. When it determines that the MUGI could have been derived from its MUI, the receiving MU processes the signaling as directed to itself.</td>

METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SIGNALING AN AD-HOC GROUP OF<br>
MOBILE UNITS<br>
Reference(s) to Related Application(s)<br>
The present application claims priority from provisional application,<br>
Serial No. 60/673077, entitled "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR<br>
SIGNALING AN AD-HOC GROUP OF MOBILE UNITS," filed April 20, 2005,<br>
which is commonly owned and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to communication systems<br>
and, in particular, to signaling an ad-hoc group of mobile units.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In existing wireless communication systems, common signaling<br>
channels such as paging channels (PCHs) are in need of greater bandwidth.<br>
Today, short message service (SMS) and voice mail notification (VMN)<br>
consume a large part of PCH bandwidth, for example. The introduction of new<br>
services such as push-to-talk (PTT), presence, and "push" (which refers<br>
generally to network initiated services) will continue to worsen the PCH<br>
bandwidth situation going forward.<br>
In today's CDMA 2000 systems a General Page Message (GPM) is<br>
used for paging. Keeping the GPM to a single frame is important, especially<br>
during times of congestion, because of the PCH bandwidth situation. In<br>
practice, only one page, addressed by IMSI (international mobile subscriber<br><br>
WO 2006/113616	PCT/US2006/014396<br>
2<br>
identity), can be placed in a single frame GPM, although as many as four<br>
pages addressed by IMSI can be packed into a two-frame GPM. However,<br>
using such two-frame GPMs can result in some negative effects on latency,<br>
battery life and reliability. Thus, a method and apparatus that enabled two or<br>
more mobile units to be paged in a single PCH frame would be very<br>
desirable.<br>

dimensions of some of the figure elements may be exaggerated relative to<br>
other elements, and well-known elements that are beneficial or even<br>
necessary to a commercially successful implementation may not be depicted<br>
so that a less obstructed and a more clear presentation of embodiments may<br>
be achieved. Simplicity and clarity in both illustration and description are<br>
sought to effectively enable a person of skill in the art to make, use, and best<br>
practice the present invention in view of what is already known in the art. One<br><br>
WO 2006/113616	PCT/US2006/014396<br>
3<br>
of skill in the art will appreciate that various modifications and changes may<br>
be made to the specific embodiments described below without departing from<br>
the spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus, the specification and<br>
drawings are to be regarded as illustrative and exemplary rather than<br>
restrictive or all-encompassing, and all such modifications to the specific<br>
embodiments described below are intended to be included within the scope of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Detailed Description of Embodiments<br>
Various embodiments are described for signaling an ad-hoc group of<br>
mobile units (MUs). The ad-hoc group may merely be a group of MUs for<br>
which signaling awaits transmission via a wireless communication resource.<br>
Signaling such a group involves deriving a mobile unit group identifier (MUG1)<br>
by combining individual mobile unit identifiers (MUls) of the targeted ad-hoc<br>
group. The individual MUls are either an identifier of each ML) or derived from<br>
an identifier of each ML). The derived MUGI is then included in combined<br>
signaling that is transmitted via the wireless communication resource. A<br>
receiving ML) determines whether the MUGI could have been derived from its<br>
MUI in combination with at least one other MU's MUI. When it determines that<br>
the MUGI could have been derived from its MUI, the receiving MU processes<br>
the signaling as directed to itself.<br>
The disclosed embodiments can be more fully understood with<br>
reference to FIGs. 1-4. FIG. 1 is a block diagram depiction of a wireless<br>
communication system 100 in accordance with multiple embodiments of the<br>
present invention. At present, standards bodies such as OMA (Open Mobile<br>
Alliance), 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project), 3GPP2 (3rd<br>
Generation Partnership Project 2) and IEEE (Institute of Electrical and<br>
Electronics Engineers) 802 are developing standards specifications for<br>
wireless telecommunications systems. (These groups may be contacted via<br>
http://www.openmobilealliance.com. http://www.3qpp.org/.<br>
http://www.3qpp2.com/ and http://www.ieee802.org/. respectively.)<br><br>
WO 2006/113616	PCT/US2006/014396<br>

Communication system 100 represents a system having an architecture in<br>
accordance with one or more of the 3GPP2 technologies (e.g., IS-2000 and<br>
IS-2001), suitably modified, as needed, to implement the present invention.<br>
Alternative embodiments of the present invention may be implemented in<br>
communication systems that employ other or additional technologies such as,<br>
but not limited to, others described in the 3GPP2 specifications (e.g., HRPD<br>
(also known as 1xEV-DO)), those described in the 3GPP specifications (e.g.,<br>
GSM, GPRS, EDGE, W-CDMA, UTRAN, FOMA, UMTS, HSDPA, and<br>
HSUPA), those described in the IEEE's 802 specifications, those described in<br>
the IS-136 (TDMA Third Generation Wireless Standards) specification, those<br>
described in the IS-95 (CDMA) specification, "IxEV-DV technologies, and<br>
integrated dispatch enhanced network technologies.<br>
More specifically, communication system 100 comprises mobile unit<br>
(MU) 101, radio access network (RAN) 121, packet data network 141, IP<br>
(internet protocol) network 145, mobile switching center (MSC) 131, and<br>
public switched telephone network (PSTN) 135. Those skilled in the art will<br>
recognize that FIG. 1 does not depict all of the network equipment necessary<br>
for system 100 to operate but only those system components and logical<br>
entities particularly relevant to the description of embodiments herein.<br>
For example, packet data networks are known to comprise devices<br>
such as packet data serving nodes (PDSNs), serving GPRS support nodes<br>
(SGSNs) and/or gateway GPRS support nodes (GGSNs). Also, RANs are<br>
known to comprise devices such as base transceiver stations (BTSs), access<br>
points (APs), packet control functions (PCFs), packet control units (PCUs),<br>
base site controllers (BSCs), and/or radio network controllers (RNCs),<br>
depending on which technology is employed. However, none of these devices<br>
are specifically shown in FIG. 1.<br>
Instead, RAN 121 is depicted in FIG. 1 as comprising controller 125<br>
and transceiver 127. In general, components such as RAN controllers and<br>
RAN transceivers are well-known. For example, RAN controllers are known to<br>
comprise basic components such as, but not limited to, microprocessors,<br>
memory devices, network interface circuitry, application-specific integrated<br>
circuits (ASICs), and/or logic circuitry. Such RAN components are typically<br><br>
WO 2006/113616	PCT/US2006/014396<br>
5<br>
adapted to implement algorithms and/or protocols that have been expressed<br>
using high-level design languages or descriptions, expressed using computer<br>
instructions, expressed using messaging flow diagrams, and/or expressed<br>
using logic flow diagrams.<br>
Thus, given an algorithm, a logic flow, a messaging/signaling flow, a<br>
call flow, and/or a protocol specification, those skilled in the art are aware of<br>
the many design and development techniques available to implement a RAN<br>
that performs the given logic. Furthermore, those skilled in the art will<br>
recognize that aspects of the present invention may be implemented in and<br>
across various physical components and none are necessarily limited to<br>
single platform implementations. For example, the RAN aspect of the present<br>
invention may be implemented in a base transceiver station, in a base/packet<br>
controller, or across both a base transceiver station and a base/packet<br>
controller.<br>
Thus, RAN 121 represents a known RAN that has been adapted, in<br>
accordance with the description herein, to implement multiple embodiments<br>
of the present invention. Furthermore, controller 125 and transceiver 127 is<br>
not intended to precisely correspond to a base/packet controller and base<br>
transceiver station, respectively. Rather, controller 125 and transceiver 127<br>
each represent devices that can extend across separate physical components<br>
that perhaps are not even co-located.<br>
As depicted in FIG. 1, RAN 121 uses an air interface comprising<br>
channel groups 111 and 113 for communication with MU 101. IS-2000<br>
channel group 111 comprises a variety of well-known non-traffic channel<br>
types, such as broadcast, paging, access, and control (both shared and<br>
common). In contrast, IS-2000 channel group 113 comprises well-known<br>
traffic channel types, which are dynamically assigned and de-assigned to<br>
support user services.<br>
Standards terminology refers to mobile units by terms such as mobile<br>
stations (MSs), user equipment (UE), access terminals (ATs), terminal<br>
equipment and mobile nodes (MNs). MU platforms are known to refer to a<br>
wide variety of consumer electronic platforms such as, but not limited to, cell<br>
phones, gaming devices, personal computers, and personal digital assistants<br><br>
WO 2006/113616<br><br>
PCT/US2006/014396<br><br>
6<br>
(PDAs). In particular, MU 101 comprises processing unit 105, transceiver 107,<br>
a keypad (not shown), a speaker (not shown), a microphone (not shown), and<br>
a display (not shown). Processing units, transceivers, keypads, speakers,<br>
microphones, and displays as used in MUs are all well-known in the art.<br>
For example, MU processing units are known to comprise basic<br>
components such as, but not limited to, microprocessors, digital signal<br>
processors (DSPs), microcontrollers, memory devices, application-specific<br>
integrated circuits (ASICs), and/or logic circuitry. Such MU components are<br>
typically adapted to implement algorithms and/or protocols that have been<br>
expressed using high-level design languages or descriptions, expressed using<br>
computer instructions, expressed using messaging flow diagrams, and/or<br>
expressed using logic flow diagrams. Thus, given an algorithm, a logic flow, a<br>
messaging/signaling flow, a call flow, and/or a protocol specification, those<br>
skilled in the art are aware of the many design and development techniques<br>
available to implement user equipment that performs the given logic.<br>
Therefore, MU 101 represents a known MU that has been adapted, in<br>
accordance with the description herein, to implement embodiments of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Operation of various embodiments in accordance with the present<br>
invention occur substantially as follows. In general, the various embodiments<br>
involve signaling an ad-hoc group of mobile units (MUs). The group signaled<br>
is ad-hoc in the sense that the members may only be associated or related to<br>
one another for the purpose of this signaling. They may be otherwise related<br>
or associated, perhaps as members of a call group, for example, but they<br>
need not be otherwise related. The ad-hoc group is signaled using a mobile<br>
unit group identifier (MUGI), which is derived by combining the individual<br>
mobile unit identifiers (MUls) of the MUs in the ad-hoc group. Each MU's MUI<br>
may either be an identifier of the MU or a derivation of an identifier of the MU.<br>
There are many possible MU identifiers upon which an MU's MUI may<br>
be based. Examples of MU identifiers include, but are not limited to, an<br>
international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI), an international mobile<br>
equipment identifier (IMEI), a mobile equipment identifier (MEID), an<br>
electronic serial number (ESN), a user identity module identifier (UIMJD), a<br><br>
WO 2006/113616	PCT/US2006/014396<br>
7<br>
UMTS subscriber information module identifier (USIMJD), a subscriber<br>
identity module identifier (SIMJD), a temporary subscription identifier (TMS1),<br>
a media access control (MAC) identifier, a Unicast Access Terminal Identifier<br>
(UATI), and an Internet Protocol (IP) address. In some embodiments, an<br>
MU's individual MUI is derived by applying a hashing function to one of the<br>
MU's identifiers, or perhaps, to a part of the identifier.<br>
One function that may be used for this hashing is a modulo function. In<br>
addition, whatever function is used, the result may be expressed in a variety<br>
of formats. For example, in some embodiments, the modulo result is<br>
represented by setting a single bit in a bitmap. Thus, for a bitmap having M<br>
bits, the n th bit of the M bits may be set, where n equals one plus modulo M<br>
of the MU identifier (or part of the MU identifier).<br>
To make each MU's individual MUI more unique, its derivation may<br>
include multiple bitmaps of different lengths. For example, each MUI may<br>
include a bitmap where M=29, a bitmap where M=31, a bitmap where M=33,<br>
and a bitmap where M=35. Each of these bitmaps would have the n th bit set,<br>
where n equals one plus modulo M of the MU identifier (or part of the MU<br>
identifier).<br>
As described above, an ad-hoc group of MUs can then be signaled<br>
using a MUGI, derived by combining the MUs' individual MUls. For<br>
embodiments in which one or more bitmaps are employed, the individual<br>
MUls of the ad-hoc group members may be combined by performing a bitwise<br>
logical OR of all the individual MUls. Thus, the resulting MUGI includes one or<br>
more bitmaps having M bits, where M differs for each bitmap (e.g., M=29,<br>
M=31, M=33, and M=35), where an n th bit of the M bits is set for each MU of<br>
the ad-hoc group, and where n, for each MU of the ad-hoc group, equals one<br>
plus modulo M of the respective MU's identifier.<br>
Embodiments in which MUls and MUGIs have four bitmaps, with<br>
M=29, M=31, M=33, and M=35, have some desirable addressing properties.<br>
With four bitmaps, each MUI can be seen as a "point" in a 4-dimensional<br>
space, with each dimension of the "space" corresponding to one of the four<br>
bitmaps. The informational entropy of the representation scheme is fairly<br>
close to maximal for the total space (128 bits= 29 + 31 + 33 +35) and number<br><br>
WO 2006/113616	PCT/US2006/014396<br>
8<br>
of dimensions (4), since the 4 moduli are all very close to the 128/4 = 32<br>
value and prime relative to each other. This results in a statistically balanced<br>
(uniform) distribution of the addresses among the bitmaps.<br>
For a single address, the uniqueness coefficient is 1 in 29*31*33*35 =<br>
1038345, i.e., approximately 1 in 1 million. This corresponds to an information<br>
entropy of roughly 20 bits. Thus, the target MU address used in computation<br>
is I MSI mod 220, which is the same as a positive integer given by the 20 least<br>
significant bits of the IMSI.<br>
Since the MUGI-based signaling is intended to target several MUs<br>
concurrently, the address uniqueness coefficient goes down sharply with the<br>
4th (because there are 4 dimensions in the space) power of the number of<br>
MUs being targeted. (The address uniqueness coefficient is the maximum<br>
theoretical size of a set of MUs, such that random targeting of one MU from<br>
the set will not probabilistically result in more than one MS being addressed. It<br>
assumes that all MUs in the set have unique identity addresses which are<br>
uniformly distributed in the addressing space.) The table below shows the<br>
variation of the uniqueness coefficient with the number of targeted MUs. In<br>
particular, it shows the equivalent uniqueness for different paging scenarios,<br>
where a MUGI is used to address a paging message.<br><br>

WO 2006/113616	PCT/US2006/014396<br>

Targeting MUs using this ad-hoc signaling approach may not always<br>
be beneficial. Again, the use of MUGIs in paging is considered. If only one<br>
mobile is targeted, signaling using a MUGI does not save any bandwidth<br>
since the current General Page Message (GPM) also requires a single frame.<br>
If two MUs are targeted, signaling using a MUGI is beneficial, potentially<br>
doubling PCH bandwidth.<br>
For more than two MUs, however, the uniqueness coefficient should<br>
be considered when evaluating the benefit. A uniqueness coefficient of above<br>
1 in 10,000 is probably selective enough to not result in too many potential<br>
false positives, even for very large paging zones. ("False positives" refer to<br>
MUs that are inadvertently addressed (or paged) as a result of MUGIs not<br>
being unique identifiers of the group of MUs targeted.) As the coefficient goes<br>
down, but remains above 1 in 3000, signaling using a MUGI may still be<br>
beneficial for moderate to large paging zones. Below the 1 in 3000 value, the<br>
number of potential false positives may be considered too large for MUGI-<br>
based signaling to be beneficial. However, it should be noted that "false<br>
positives" are not necessarily wasted, since they can be used to refresh<br>
presence, status, and tracking information as is described in more detail<br>
below.<br>
As depicted in FIG. 1, RAN 121 comprises RAN controller 125 and<br>
RAN transceiver 127, while MU 101 comprises MU processing unit 105 and<br>
MU transceiver 107. RAN 121 and MU 101 communicate via non-traffic<br>
channel group 111 and traffic channel group 113. RAN controller 125 derives<br>
a MUGI by combining individual MUls of targeted MUs (such as MU 101) for<br>
which signaling awaits transmission. RAN controller 125 then transmits, via<br>
transceiver 127 and channel group 111, combined signaling comprising the<br>
derived MUGI.<br>
MU processing unit 105 receives, via channel group 111 and<br>
transceiver 107, the combined signaling comprising the MUGI. Processing<br>
unit 105 then determines whether the MUGI could have been derived from an<br>
MUI of MU 101 in combination with one or more other MUls of other MUs.<br>
Depending on the embodiment, this determination may simply involve<br>
performing a bitwise logical AND of the MUGI and an MUI of MU 101 to see if<br><br>
WO 2006/113616	PCT/US2006/014396<br>
10<br>
the MUI results. This of course works for embodiments in which the individual<br>
MUls are bitwise ORed together to derive the MUGI.<br>
Also, for simplicity it is desirable that MU 101 and RAN 121 use the<br>
same identifier (or identifier portion) and derivational process to derive the<br>
MUI used by MU 101. As a matter of implementation, MU 101 will probably<br>
store the MUI that it uses for quick retrieval whenever the MUI is needed<br>
rather than deriving it over and over. However, in some embodiments, MU<br>
101 may store/derive multiple MUls, perhaps based on different MU<br>
identifiers and/or different derivational processes, for MUGI-based signaling<br>
with different RANs, for different applications, using different channels, or for<br>
different RAN operating conditions.<br>
When processing unit 105 determines that the MUGI could have been<br>
derived from a MUI of MU 101, processing unit 105 processes the combined<br>
signaling as directed to MU 101. The combined signaling can take a variety of<br>
forms. The signaling may comprise control messaging on a shared or<br>
common control channel. It may also comprise signaling over a paging<br>
channel (PCH), such as paging messages, broadcast messages, SMS<br>
messages, and/or VMN messages. As an example, combined signaling using<br>
a MUGI will be described below for the case of paging a group of MUs using a<br>
group page message.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram depiction of group page message 200 in<br>
accordance with multiple embodiments of the present invention. Generally, in<br>
addition to a MUGI, a group page message may include many assorted<br>
indications to the ad-hoc group of MUs targeted. Some examples that may be<br>
included, depending on the embodiment, follow: an indication of whether an<br>
acknowledgment to a response to the group page message should be<br>
requested by a responding MU, an indication of a persistence level with which<br>
a responding MU should respond to the group page message (the<br>
persistence level may be based on an estimated size of the group of MUs that<br>
may respond to the group page message, including the number targeted by<br>
the MUGI and/or expected to false), an indication of what type of signaling in<br>
response to the group page message is requested from a responding MU, an<br>
indication of a communication service to which the group page message<br><br>
WO 2006/113616	PCT/US2006/014396<br>
11<br>
pertains (this may take the form of a compressed service option field that only<br>
includes the most often used service options, e.g.), an indication to switch to<br>
an unslotted mode, an indication to switch to a semi-dormant mode, an<br>
indication to switch to a page monitoring mode using an RSCI (reduced slot<br>
cycle index), and an indication of whether the group page message is the last<br>
group page message in the present paging slot.<br>
As a specific example, group page message 200 is presented as a<br>
"single frame" (i.e., 20ms) message to be sent on a full-rate (9600 bps) PCH.<br>
The message can also be employed as a two (consecutive) frame message<br>
to be sent on a half-rate (4800 bps) PCH. Either way, the information payload<br>
is intended be the same, 138 bits.<br>
The MUGI of message 200 is depicted as HB1_BITMAP_29,<br>
HB1_BITMAP_31, HB1_BITMAP__33, and HB1_BITMAP_35. Thus, the MUGI<br>
of message 200 is in accordance with the embodiments of a 4-bitmap MUGI<br>
described above. A specific description of the bit definitions for the<br>
information payload follow:<br>
RESERVED -	Reserved.<br>
The base station sets this field to '00'.<br>
ACK_REQ - Acknowledgment required.<br>
The base station sets this field to '1' if the response to this message is<br>
to be sent by the mobile station in assured mode; otherwise, the base station<br>
sets this field to '0'.<br>
PERSISTENCE - Persistence level.<br>
The base station sets this field to '0' if the response to this message is<br>
not required (ACK_REQ was set to '0') or if the response to this message is<br>
required (ACK_REQ was set to '1') to be sent using the same persistence<br>
level as the Page Response Message. The base station sets this field to '1', if<br>
the response to this message is to be sent by the mobile station using the<br>
lowest allowed persistence level for that mobile station.<br><br>
WO 2006/113616<br><br>
PCT/US2006/014396<br><br>
12<br>
RESPONSE_MSG - Response message<br>
The base station sets this field '0' if the requested response is a BS<br>
Ack or Radio Environment Report Message; the base station sets this field to<br>
'1' if the requested response is a Page Response Message.<br>
SERVICEJD	- id of the service<br>
The base station sets this field according to the definitions in the<br>
applicable standard.<br>
GRP_PGS_DONE - No more messages in the page slot indicator.<br>
The base station sets this field to '1' if this message is the last Group<br>
Page Message in the paging slot; otherwise the base station sets this field to<br>
'0'.<br>
HB1_BITMAP_29 -	Hash bucket number 1.<br>
For each mobile station that is paged, the base station computes the<br>
number i = 1 + (IMSI mod 29) and sets the ith bit (from the left) of this field to<br>
'1'. The base station sets to '0', all the other bits in the field.<br>
HB2_BITMAP_31 -	Hash bucket number 2.<br>
For each mobile station that is paged, the base station computes the<br>
number i = 1 + (IMSI mod 31) and sets the i,h bit (from the left) of this field to<br>
'1'. The base station sets to '0', all the other bits in the field.<br>
HB3_BITMAP_33 -	Hash bucket number 3.<br>
For each mobile station that is paged, the base station computes the<br>
number i = 1 + (IMSI mod 33) and sets the ith bit (from the left) of this field to<br>
'1'. The base station sets to '0', all the other bits in the field.<br>
HB4_BITMAP_35 -	Hash bucket number 4.<br>
For each mobile station that is paged, the base station computes the<br>
number i = 1 + (IMSI mod 35) and sets the ith bit (from the left) of this field to<br>
'1'. The base station sets to '0', all the other bits in the field.<br><br>

FIG. 3 is a logic flow diagram of functionality performed by a RAN in<br>
accordance with multiple embodiments of the present invention. For some<br>
embodiments, logic flow 300 begins (301) with the RAN determining (303)<br>
that a wireless communication resource has insufficient bandwidth to convey<br>
signaling individually to a group of MUs during a targeted time period. For<br>
example, in the case of PCH signaling, the RAN may determine that there are<br>
more pages to be transmitted during a paging slot than PCH bandwidth will<br>
allow if the pages are transmitted individually. Another example would be<br>
situations where the targeted time period is not necessarily a paging slot but<br>
is dictated by user expectations of how responsive the system or application<br>
should be.<br>
The RAN then selects (305) an ad-hoc group of MUs to target as a<br>
group. Determining how many and which MUs to target can depend on many<br>
different combinations of factors depending on the embodiment. Some<br>
potential factors include the following: whether a quick paging channel<br>
(QPCH) is provided in a paging area, a transmit power level of the QPCH, a<br>
slot cycle index (SCI) used in the paging area, a present loading level of an<br>
access channel (ACH) associated with the communication resource, a<br>
number of MUs known to be registered in the paging area, a number of MUs<br>
known to be registered in the paging area that also support group signaling of<br>
MUs, which communication service is targeted, a present loading level of the<br>
communication resource (e.g., how many MUs need to be signaled in the<br>
target time period), and/or an estimated number of MUs that may respond<br>
(those targeted and/or those potentially falsing).<br>
In addition to these, there also may be some factors that would<br>
eliminate a potential MU from being included in the ad-hoc group targeted.<br>
Some of these factors include the following: a service class associated with<br>
the potential MU, whether the potential MU has been recently targeted by an<br>
ad-hoc group but did not respond, a battery level of the potential MU, a<br>
plugged-in / battery-only operating mode of the potential MU, and/or the<br>
number of other MUs expected to false if the potential MU is included (the<br><br>
WO 2006/113616	PCT/US2006/014396<br>
14<br>
RAN may be able to check its list of Mils in the paging area, such as semi-<br>
dormant MUs, to predict possible falsing).<br>
In contrast, there also may be some factors that would provide a strong<br>
reason for including a potential MU in the ad-hoc group. Some of these<br>
factors include the following: the potential MU is a member of a PTT (push-to-<br>
talk) group that is being signaled, the potential MU has low priority signaling<br>
awaiting transmission, the potential MU needs to be paged for a multicast,<br>
and/or the potential MU has a presence update request awaiting<br>
transmission.<br>
Having selected the ad-hoc group of MUs, the RAN derives a MUG I by<br>
combining the MUls associated with the selected MUs. The RAN then<br>
transmits (307) combined signaling comprising the derived MUGI via the<br>
wireless communication resource. In response, the RAN receives (309)<br>
signaling from an MU and determines (311) whether the responding MU is a<br>
selected member of the ad-hoc group targeted by the MUGI or a falsing MU.<br>
In the case where the responding MU was a member of the ad-hoc group, the<br>
RAN processes (313) the responsive signaling in accordance with the<br>
combined signaling directed to the MU.<br>
However, in the case where the responding MU is falsing, the RAN<br>
may either ignore (315) the responsive signaling or opportunistically make<br>
use of it. For example, the RAN may perform one or more of the following<br>
actions in response to the signaling from the falsing MU: update the location<br>
of the MU, register the falsing MU, perform a semi-dormant update for the<br>
falsing MU, signal the falsing MU, and/or interpret the responsive signaling<br>
from the falsing MU as a presence update. Thus, logic flow 300 ends (317);<br>
however, in order to perform the signaling of an ad-hoc group of MUs,<br>
functionality not depicted in FIG. 3 may be additionally performed while<br>
certain depicted functionality may not be performed, depending on the<br>
particular embodiment of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 4 is a logic flow diagram of functionality performed by a mobile<br>
unit (MU) in accordance with multiple embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Logic flow 400 begins (401) with the MU receiving (403) signaling that<br>
comprises a MUGI via a wireless communication resource. The MU<br><br>
WO 2006/113616	PCT/US2006/014396<br>
15<br>
determines (405) whether the MUGI could have been derived from an MUI of<br>
the MU in combination with one or more other MU's MUls. If (407) so, the MU<br>
processes (409) the signaling as directed to the MU.<br>
However, depending on whether (411) certain conditions are present,<br>
the MU may either respond (413) to the signaling as appropriate or determine<br>
not to respond. Some conditions that may cause the MU to not respond<br>
include the following: the MU has a low battery, the MU has an associated<br>
service class that provides enhanced battery life, the MU does not participate<br>
in a communication service indicated by the signaling, and/or the MU detects<br>
subsequent signaling that indicates that another MU responded to the<br>
signaling (e.g., another MU that derives the same MUI). Thus, logic flow 400<br>
ends (415); however, in order to perform the receiving of signaling for an ad-<br>
hoc group of MUs, functionality not depicted in FIG. 4 may be additionally<br>
performed while certain depicted functionality may not be performed,<br>
depending on the particular embodiment of the present invention.<br>

Various embodiments are described for signaling an ad-hoc group of mobile units (MUs). The ad-hoc group may be a group of MUs for which signaling awaits transmission via a wireless communication resource (111). Signaling such a group involves deriving a mobile unit group identifier (MUGI) by combining individual mobile unit identifiers (MUIs) of the targeted ad-hoc group. The individual MUIs are either an identifier of each MU or derived from an identifier of each MU. The derived MUGI<br>
is then included in combined signaling that is transmitted (by RAN 121, e.g.) via the wireless communication resource. A receiving MU (101) determines whether the MUGI could have been derived from its MUI in combination with at least one other MU's MUI. When it determines that the MUGI could have been derived from its MUI, the receiving MU processes the signaling as directed to itself.</td>
