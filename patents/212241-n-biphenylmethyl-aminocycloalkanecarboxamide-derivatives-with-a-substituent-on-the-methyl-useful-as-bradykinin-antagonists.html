N-BIPKENYLMETHYL AMINOCYCLOALKANECARBOXAMIDE<br>
DERIVATES  VIITH  A  SU3STITUENT  ON<br>
THE  METHYL   USEFUL  AS   BRADYKIMIN   A^TTAGONISTS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to aminocycloalkanecarboxamide compounds. In particular, this invention is directed to aniinocycloalkanecarboxamide compounds that are bradykinin antagonists or inverse agonists.<br>
Bradyldnin ("BK") is a kinin which plays an important role in the pathophysiological processes accompanying acute and chronic pain and inflammation. Bradykinin (BK), like other kinins, is an autacoid peptide produced by the catalytic action of kallikrein enzymes on plasma and tissue precursors termed kininogens. The biological actions of BK are mediated by at least two major G-protein-coupled BK receptors termed Bl and B2. It is generally believed that B2 receptors, but not Bl receptors, are expressed in normal tissues and that inflammation, tissue damage or bacterial infection can rapidly induce Bl receptor expression. This makes the Bl receptor a particularly attractive drug target. The putative role of kinins, and specifically BK, in the managem.ent of pain and inflammation has provided the impetus for developing potent and selective BK antagonists. In recent years, this effort has been heightened with the expectation that useful therapeutic agents with analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties would provide relief from maladies mediated through a BK receptor pathway (see e.g., M.G. Bock and J, Longmore, Current Opinion in Chem. Biol., 4:401-406(2000)). Accordingly, there is a need for novel compounds that are effective in blocking or reversing activation of bradykinin receptors. Such compounds would be useful in the management of pain and inflammation, as well as in the treatment or prevention of diseases and disorders mediated by bradykinin; further, such compounds are also useful as research tools {in vivo and in vitro),<br>

Biological Evaluation<br>
Assessing the Affinity of Selected Compounds to Bind to the Bradykinin B1 or B2<br>
Receptor<br>
Radioligand binding assays are performed using membranes from CHO cells that stably express the human, rabbit, rat, or dog B1 receptors or CHO cells that express the human B2 recep'or. For all receptor types, cells are harvested from culture flasks in PBS/lmM EDTA and centrifuged at 1000x2 for 10 minutes. The cell pellets are homogenized with a polytron in ice cold 20mM HEPES, InaM EDTA, pH 7.4 (lysis buffer) and centrifuged at 20,000xg for 20 minutes. The membrane pellets are rehomogenized in lysis buffer, centrifuged again at 20,000xg and the final pellets are resuspended at 5mg protein/ml in assay buffer (120mM NaCl, 5mM KCl, 20mM HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1% BSA and frozen at-80°C.<br>
On the day of assay, membranes are centrifuged at 14,000xg for 5 minutes and resuspended to the desired protein concentration in assay buffer containing lOOnM enaliprilat, 140µg/mL bacitracin and 0,1% BSA. 3H-des-arglO, leu9 kallidin is the radioligand used for the human and rabbit B1 receptors, 3H-des-arglO kallidin is used for the rat and dog Bl receptors, and 3H-bradykinin is used to label the human B2 receptor.<br>
For all assays, compounds are diluted from DMSO stock solutions with 4µL added to assay tubes for a final DMSO concentration of 2%. This is followed by the addition of lOOµL radioligand and lOOµL of the membrane suspension. Nonspecific binding for the Bl receptor binding assays is determined<br><br>
using lµM des-arglO kallidjn and nonspecific binding for the B2 receptor is determined with lµM bradykin. Tubes are incubated at room temperature (220C) for 60 minutes followed by filtranon using a Tomtec 96-well harvesting systeni. Radioactivity retained by the filler is counted using a Wallac Beta-plate scintillation counter.<br>
The compounds of this invention have affinity for the Bl receptor in the above assay as demonstrated by results of less than SpcNL It is advantageous that the assay results be less than lµM, even more advantageous for the results be less than 0.5MM. It is further advanrageous that compounds of this invention have affinity for the bradyidnin Bl receptor over the bradykinin B2 receptor; more advantageously, the affinity for the Bl receptor is at least 10 fold, and preferably over 100 fold, over that for the B2 receptor.<br>
Assay for Bradykinin Bl Antagonists<br>
Bl agonist-induced calcium mobilization was monitored using a Fluorescence Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR). CHO cells expressing the Bl receptor were plated in 96 or 384 well plates and allowed to incubate in Iscove's modified DMEM overnight. Wells were washed two times with a physiological buffered salt solution and'then incubated with 4uM Fluo-3 for one hour at 370C. The plates were then washed two times with buffered salt solution and lOOuL of buffer was added to each well. Plates were placed in the FLIPR unit and allowed to equilibrate for two minutes. The test compound was then added in 50ul volumes followed five minutes later by 50ul of agonist (des-arglO kallidin). Relative fluorescence peak heights in the absence and presence of antagonist were used to calculate the degree of inhibition of the Bl receptor agonist response by the test compound. Eight to ten concentrations of test compound were typically evaluated to construct an inhibition curve and detennine IC50 values using a four-parameter nonlinear regression curve fitting routine.<br>
Assay for Bradykinin Inverse Agonists<br>
Inverse agonist acrivity at the hunaan Bl receptor was evaluated using transiently transfected HEK293 cells. One day following transfection cell flasks were labeled overnight with 6uCi/ml pHjmyo-inositoI. On the day of assay, the media was removed and the attached cells were gently rinsed with 2x20ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Assay buffer (HEPES buffered physiological salts, pH 7.4) was added and the cells were detached by tapping of the flask. The cells were centrifuged at 800xg for<br><br>
five minutes and resuspended a: lxl06 cells/ml in assay buffer supplemented with lOmM lithium chloride. After 10 minutes at room temperature, one-half ml aliquots were distributed to tubes containing test compound or vehicle. After an additional 10 minutes the tubes were transferred to a 37°C water bath for 30 minutes. The incubation was terminated by the addition of a 12% perchloric acid solution and the tubes were placed on ice for 30 .Tiinutes. The acid was then neutralized with KOH and the tubes centrifuged to pellet precipitated material [3H]Inosito[ monophosphate formed was recovered by standard ion exchange chromatographic techniques and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Inverse agonist activity was determined by the degree to which a test compound reduced basal (cells incubated with vehicle) levels of [3H]inositol monophosphate accumulation.<br>

Compounds of formula I may be prepared according to the following illustrative schemes.<br><br><br>
In Scheme 1, compound (la) is assembled by coupling the biaryhnethanamine derivative (1) to the protected aminocycloalkanoic acid (2) using standard peptide coupling reagent combinations, such as EDCI/HOBt, in an appropriate solvent, such as THF, to provide (3). The Boc protecting group is then removed by the action of an acid, like HCl, in an appropriate solvent, like MeOH, to yield an ammonium salt from which the free-base derivative (4) may be obtained using an appropriate base, such as ammonia, and an appropriate solvent, such as<br><br>
chloroform. This amine deriva:ive (4) is then reacted with a carboxylic acid or carboxylic acid equivalent to yield title compound (la). Alternatively, the acid-salt of (4) can be used in the final reaction to yield title compound (la) provided an appropriate base such as triethylamine is added.<br>
Alternatively, compound (la) may be assembled by coupling the biarylmethanamine derivati\e (2), with the acylated aminocycloalkanoic acid (5) as shown in Scheme la.<br><br><br><br>
In Scheme 2a, the cyanobiaryl derivative (S) is assembled using a Suzuki reaction between an aromatic boronic acid derivative (6), or an appropriate boronic ester derivative, and an aromatic halide (7) in the presence of a triarylphosphine, like triphenylphosphine, and a metal catalyst, like palladiuna acetate. The resultant cyano biaryl intermediate (8) is then catalytically reduced to the corresponding amine biaryl derivative (la) using hydrogen and a metal, such as Raney Ni, in an appropriate solvent.<br>
Alternatively, as illustrated in Scheme 2b, a methanamine derivative (9), after primary amine protection with an appropriate protecting group such as Boo, is elaborated to the pinacol boron ester (11) using a palladium catalyst in an appropriate solvent, like dimethyl sulfoxide. This boron ester (11) is coupled^to an aryl halide derivative (7) employing Suzuki reaction conditions to yield (1).<br><br><br>
A third method for the preparation of biarylmethanamine derivatives is depicted in Scheme 2c. The biaryl moiety (14) is first assembled using a palladium catalyzed coupling of (12) with an aryl zinc compound (13) as shown. The methyl group of biaryl (14) is then elaborated according to the three step sequence of halogenation, nucleophilic displacement of the halogen with azide, and reduction to provide the corresponding amine intermediate (la). Alternatively, the biarylmethanamine (la) can also be prepared starting from the arylcarbonitrile (16) and aryl zinc compuond (13) as previously discussed. The resulting biarylcarbonitrile (8) is then reduced using hydrogen to provide (la).<br><br><br>
It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that functional group interconversion can be used to provide various compounds of formula I. As illustrated in Scheme 3, derivative (3a) is bis-deprotected first by the action of a strong acid, like TFA, and second by alkaline hydrolysis in a suitable mixture of water and an organic solvent, like methanol, at a temperature between 25 and 100 °C to yield the amino acid derivative (17). Prior activation of a carboxylic acid (R5COOH) with an appropriate set of peptide coupling reagents, like EDCI/HOBt, forms the 'active ester' which then reacts with the amino acid derivative (17) to yield (18). The latter compound can either react with amines (HNRbRc) or alkyloxy amines (H2N0Ra) under the action of an appropriate set of peptide coupling reagents, like<br>
EDCI/HOBt, to form the claimed compounds (lb) and (Ic), respectively.<br><br><br>
N-alkylation is illustrated in Scheme 4. The amine (4) is alkylated with excess alkyl iodide (I-Rl) in an appropriate solvent, like THF, in the presence of<br><br><br>
The preparation of compounds of fonnula I having a 1,2-cis- or 1,2-trans-cyclopropyl moiety is illustrated in Schemes 5 and 6, According to known procedures (K. Burgess et al., J. Org. Chem., 57:5931-5936(1992)), di-ttert-butyl malonate is elaborated to derivative (20). The N-Boc group is removed using methane sulfonic acid according to L. S. Lin et al. Tetrahedron Lett, 41:7013-7016(2000) to give amine (21). This amine is allowed to react with a carboxylic acid or carboxylic acid equivalent under appropriate peptide coupling conditions to yield (22). The tert-, butyl ester is then cleaved with an acid, like TFA, in an appropriate solvent, like DCM, to provide acid (23). Biarylmethanamine (1) is then coupled with the acid (23)<br><br>
using an appropriate set of peptide coupling reagents, like EDCI/HOBt, to produce the title compound (le). Further elaboration of (le) to additional compounds of formula I may be accomplished using procedures well known to those skilled in the art. For example, the acetyl group may be removed by hydrolysis to provide the con'esponding alcohol; the alcohol may be convened to the corresponding sulfonate by treatment with sulfonyl chloride, and the sulfonate may be converted to the corresponding halide by treatment with a source of the halide. These and other functional transformations to provide compounds of formula I are described in typical organic chemistry textbooks such as March's Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure. 5th Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2000.<br><br><br>
In Scheme 6, according to known procedures (K. Burgess et al.,7. Org.<br>
Chem., 57:5931-5936(1992)), di-tert-butyl malonate is elaborated to derivative (24).<br>
The N-Boc group is removed using an acid, like TFA, in an appropriate solvent, like<br>
DCM. This amine is allowed to react with a carboxylic acid or carboxylic acid equivalent under appropriate peptide coupling conditions, like EDCI/H0Bt/NEt3 to<br>
yield (25). Biarylmethanamine (1), is then allowed to open the lactone (25) in an appropriate aprotic solvent, like D!vIF, at a temperature between 20 and 100 °C, to produce the title compound (If). Further elaboration of (If) to additional title compounds may be accomplished using procedures well known to those skilled in the art as previously discussed.<br><br><br>
