				<td>The invention relates to a novel polymorph of methyl {+)- (S)- a-(2-chlorophenyi)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5-acetate hydrogen sulfate also known as clopidogrel hydrogen sulfate, processes for its preparation and pharmaceutical composition containing it.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Clopidogrel hydrogen sulfate or methyl (+)- (S)- a-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5-acetate hydrogen sulfate is a platelet aggregation inhibitor which is described in Eur.Pat. No. 281459 (hereinafter referred to as "the '459 patent"). Various methods of synthesis of clopidogrel and its salts are disclosed in US 6.215,005, US 6,180,793, US 5,132,435, US 6,080,875 and WO 02/059128. Two forms of clopidogrel hydrogen chloride are so far known. U.S. Pat. No. 6,429,210 (hereinafter referred to as "the *210 patent") claims a polymorph of clopidogrel hydrogen sulfate, designated as Form II. '210 patent also indicated that the process described in '459 patent for the preparation of clopidogrel hydrogen sulfate leads to a polymorph which is called Form I. Form I and Form II have characteristic x-ray diffraction pattern, infrared absorption spectra. Significant reflections of x-ray powder diffraction pattern of Form 1 and Form II as represented by interplanar spacings are shown in Table I. Characteristic absorption bands of infrared spectra of Form I and Form II are shown in Table II.<br>
According to the prior art, preparation of clopidogrel hydrogen sulfate Form I can be described as follows:<br>
a)	Methyl (+)- (S)- a-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5-acetate R-Camphor-10-sulfate (Clopidogrel camphor sulfonate ) in water is made alkaline with an aq. solution of sodium bicarbonate, aqueous layer is extracted with dichloromethane and the organic layer is dried to get a residue.<br>
b)	The residue is dissolved in ice-cold acetone and then concentrated sulfuric acid is added.<br>
c)	the precipitate obtained is filtered, washed and dried.<br>
As described in patent '210, Form II of clopidogrel hydrogen sulfate is prepared by suspending methyl (+)- (S)- a-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5-acetate R-camphor -10-sulfonate in dichloromethane, extracting camphorsulfonic acid<br><br>
into an aqueous potassium carbonate, concentrating the organic layer, dissolving the residue obtained in acetone, adding 96% sulfuric acid, seeding the resulting solution with clopidogrel hydrogen sulfate Form II to give Form II of clopidogrel hydrogen sulfate. A novel polymorph of clopidogrel hydrogen sulfate (hereinafter referred to as Form III) has been synthesized and characterized and it possesses distinct advantages over the previously known Forms. In accordance with the present invention, the new polymorph of clopidogrel hydrogen sulfate is found to be obtainable in highly pure form, that is free from Form I and Form II and contamination by solvates, is stable and does not convert automatically into other forms.So, Form III can be used in pharmaceutical formulation as a platelet aggregation inhibitor. Moreover, Preparation of Form III is very easy when compared with that of Form II.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a substantially pure, stable and easily obtainable novel form of clopidogrel hydrogen sulfate (Form III), methods for preparing the novel form and pharmaceutical formulations containing the novel form.<br>
