				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
Embodiments of the present invention relate to circuit design. Particularly,<br>
embodiments of the present invention relate to improvements in phase lock loop<br>
(PLL) circuits.<br>
Background of the Related Art<br>
Phase locked loops (PLLs) are widely used in various wireless systems due<br>
to its usefulness for digital clock synchronization, frequency synthesizing, and die<br>
like Fig. 1 illustrates a general schematic diagram of a PLL according to the<br>
related art The PLL includes a phase frequency detector 102 (PFD), charge<br>
pump (CP) and loop filter (LF) 104, voltage-controlled oscillator 106(VCO), and<br>
frequency divider. PFD 102 compares the phase/frequency of input and output<br>
signals and sends the result to CP &amp; LF 104. CP &amp; LF 104 converts the result of<br>
comparison in PFD 102 into a DC voltage. PFD 102 generates the "UP" or<br>
"DOWN" signal according to whether the input signal leads or lags the output<br>
VCO 106 generates the pulse frequency as a function of the DC voltage<br>
(Vcontrol) supplied from CP &amp; LF 104.<br>
In PLL applications, inductor-capacitor VCOs (LC-VCOs) are widely used<br>
because of their jitter/phase noise performance, which is typically better than ring<br>
oscillators, for example. LC-VCOs are tuned because process variations, â€¢which<br>
produce tolerances/variations in the various inductor and capacitor components '<br>
and to cover the required frequency and range.<br>
A simple schematic diagram of a related art LC-VCO is illustrated in Fig. 2.<br>
Two CMOS inverters 202 and 204 are cross-coupled by connecting the common<br>
drain of the first inverter 202 to the common gate of the second inverter 204 and<br><br>
vice versa. The cross-coupled inverters 202 and 204 constitute a multivibrator.<br>
The inductor 206 (L) is connected in parallel with the capacitor circuit 210 to form<br>
a tank circuit. The capacitor circuit 210 is subdivided into analog varactor 212<br>
(CV) and discrete capacitor array 214 (CD). The discrete capacitor array 214 is<br>
used for coarse tuning of the frequency and the varactor is used for fee-tuning.<br>
The voltage nodes for controlling the switches of the discrete capacitor array 214<br>
are omitted in this figure for simplicity. This type of VCO has recently been<br>
applied in wireless applications, because it provides better phase noise<br>
performance than typical varactor-only controlled LC oscillators.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a block diagram of a related art PLL incorporating the<br>
LC- VCO with discrete capacitors as part of the tank circuit in phase lock<br>
operation. During the normal operating mode, the PFD and the charge pump<br>
302 via low pass filter 304 control the analog varactor 306 to have an exact<br>
frequency and phase lock However, when the PLL becomes activated or tries to<br>
change the desired frequency, the PLL enters into the coarse tuning period to<br>
achieve coarse frequency lock. This coarse frequency acquisition process is<br>
performed using the coarse tuning controller 310, which turns on and off the<br>
appropriate capacitor(s) 312 to move the output frequency of the VCO 308 as<br>
close as possible to the desired frequency.<br>
The block diagram of the PLL during the coarse tuning process according<br>
to the related art is illustrated in Fig. 4. In coarse tuning process, the Bias<br>
Generator generates a fixed control voltage for the varactor of the VCO. Hence,<br>
the capacitance of the varactor (e.g., Cv in Fig. 2) is fixed during the coarse tuning.<br>
Instead of controlling the capacitance of the varactor, the frequency of the VCO<br>
is determined by the discrete coarse tuning capacitors. The Crystal Oscillator<br>
provides the reference for coarse tuning. The Prescaler &amp; Counter counts the<br>
number of VCO clocks during the pre-determined duration for the desired lock<br>
frequency. Here, the predetermined duration is the high duration of the<br>
EN_COUNTER. In each coarse tuning stage, the Digital Comparator compares<br><br>
the reference number and the counter value from the Prescaler&amp;Counter and<br>
generates UP/DOWN signal to determine whether the VCO frequency is higher<br>
or lower than the desired frequency. With the UP/DOWN signal, the capacitor of<br>
each stage is set as ON or OFF. The Reset Generator &amp; Counter Controller<br>
resets the counter value of the Prescaler&amp;Counter for each coarse tuning stage.<br>
Several methods are published in the related art that perform coarse tuning<br>
and fine-tuning control of the VCO (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,137,372 and "A<br>
CMOS Self-Calibrating Frequency Synthesizer", IEEE Journal of solid-state<br>
circuits, Vol. 35, No. 10,2000. Each reference is hereby incorporated by reference<br>
herein in its entirety). The accuracy of the coarse tuning process is relevant to<br>
reducing the varactor size. Since the size of the varactor is inversely proportional<br>
to the phase noise, it is advantageous to reduce the size of the varactor to improve<br>
the phase noise performance. As the coarse tuning process is performed more<br>
accurately, the smallest capacitor should be designed to provide a fine frequency<br>
step size during coarse tuning.<br>
To perform the coarse tuning process accurately, both frequency error<br>
detection and the step size of the smallest capacitor should be determined<br>
accurately. Even though modem process techniques provide well-matched<br>
capacitors in terms of capacitance, this error can be minirnized or compensated<br>
during the coarse tuning for a more accurate coarse tuning. The design of the<br>
frequency error detector during the coarse tuning is related to the coarse tuning<br>
time, which will be discussed below in the following paragraphs.<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate an example of the coarse tuning process with key<br>
timing parameters and a block diagram of detection logic in the coarse tuning<br>
controller, respectively, according to the related art The coarse tuning process<br>
starts whenever the desired frequency is changed or after power-up. Since the<br>
coarse tuning process is a kind of frequency tracking, the digital accumulator 630<br>
is used to estimate the period of the VCO 610. This result is compared with the<br>
reference-timing signal from the external crystal clock. In the particular<br><br>
implementation of the coarse tuning illustrated in Fig. 6, the digital accumulator<br>
630 (or counter) is periodically reset by the RST_COUNTER signal generated-by<br>
the coarse tuning controller. This counting operation is masked by the<br>
EN_COUNTER signal. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the operation of the counter is<br>
enabled (e.g., using AND gate 620) only when the EN_COUNTER is high.<br>
When the output of the accumulator/counter 630 exceeds the reference number<br>
(e.g., "M" in Figure 6) as determined by digital comparator 650, the<br>
OUT_COUNTER signal becomes high. This OUT_COUNTER signal and<br>
COMP_CLK signal from the coarse tuning controller are used for lead-and-lag<br>
detection of die frequency, by flip-flop 660.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 5, the OUT_COUNTER signal becomes high at 510<br>
prior to low-to-high transition of the COMP_CLK signal. According to the<br>
frequency error, the latched value will vary from one to zero at 520. In the<br>
illustration of Fig. 5, the VCO frequency is determined to be greater than<br>
expected. This polarity at the latched output (e.g., flip-flop 660) can be used to<br>
decide the polarity of the switch connected to the (i-th) capacitor in the VCO.<br>
When the PLL receives the channel information, the coarse tuning<br>
controller converts the channel information to appropriate timing parameters for<br>
the coarse tuning. For example, when the desired target frequency is 1GHz and<br>
the external reference clock frequency is 20MHz, the coarse tuning controller<br>
works with this 20MHz external clock signal to generate RST_COUNTER,<br>
EN_COUNTER, the reference number, and COMP_CLK signals.<br>
For example, let's assume that the high duration of the EN__COUNTER is<br>
set as 1 us and the target VCO frequency is 1 GHz. Here, the "lus" for the<br>
duration of the EN_COUNTER is a design value and can be changed to other<br>
value according to the accuracy of the coarse tuning process. In this example, the<br>
external clock is divided by 20 (20/20MHz=lus) to generate the high duration of<br>
the EN_COUNTER signal. The reference number is determined from the<br>
division of the EN_COUNTER by the duration of the target VCO frequency.<br><br>
Hence, in this example, the reference number is 1000 ( = lus/(l/lGHz)). This<br>
reference number is compared with the counter value of the Prescaler&amp;Counter at<br>
the Digital Comparator. The COMP_CLK is synchronized with the falling edge of<br>
the EN_COUNTER and used as a timing clock in the Digital Comparator. The<br>
RST_COUNTER is a reset signal for each coarse toning stage and high during<br>
one external clock after the EN_COUNTER goes from high to low.<br>
The accuracy of the coarse tuning process is a design parameter to be<br>
decided and is mainly determined by the EN_COUNTER signal In Fig. 5 the<br>
Tc,1bit means the total cycle time for switch on and off of one bit in the coarse<br>
tuning, which is mainly determined by operating time of the counter, Tccounter.<br>
A limiting factor for the accurate coarse tuning is the uncertainty of the<br>
lead-and-lag detection logic in Fig. 6. Assuming the goal of the coarse tuning is to<br>
discriminate the frequency difference of 1MHz, then two VCO frequencies of<br>
0.9995GHz and 1.0005GHz should be detected, for example. When the duration<br>
of the EN_COUNTER is set to lus, then the reference number ("M" in Fig. 6)<br>
should be set to 1000(=lus/lns). The time differences between the rising edge of<br>
EN_COUNTER and the rising edge of the OUT_COUNTER are 1.0005 us for<br>
the VCO frequency of 0.9995GHz and 0.9995 us for the VCO frequency of the<br>
1.001 GHz. "When there is no timing uncertainty, the former case will produce<br>
frequency "DOWN" signal and the latter case will produce frequency "UP" by<br>
the lead-and-lag detection logic. However, if the timing uncertainty from the lead-<br>
and-lag detection logic is Ins, the two results can be same. Thus, it is uncertain<br>
whether those two VCO frequencies can be distinguished by the lead-and-lag<br>
detection logic.<br>
When the timing uncertainty is fixed, the accuracy can be improved by<br>
increasing the reference number or the duration of EN_COUNTER. Assuming<br>
that the reference number is increased by 10 times, then the time differences will<br>
be 10.005 us and 9.995 us for those two cases. Since the timing margin of 5ns is<br>
larger than the timing uncertainty of 1ns, the decision will be correct. In other<br><br>
words, 0.1% of the initial frequency difference of the VCO results in 10ns of the<br>
difference in time rather than Ins in former case. Since this value is large enough<br>
to compensate the uncertainty from the lead-and-lag detection logic, the desired<br>
accuracy can be obtained.<br>
However, the penalty for the improvement in coarse tuning is an increase<br>
of the comparison time or the time required for the coarse tuning. If the number<br>
of bits to be determined is 10bits, then the time required to finish the coarse<br>
tuning will be 10 times for the 1bit decision case. In summary, as the number of<br>
the bits or the accuracy for the coarse tuning is increased, the coarse tuning time is<br>
also increased.<br>
After finishing the coarse tuning, the PLL enters into the phase lock<br>
operation (eg., as illustrated in Fig. 3). Since the total lock time of the PLL<br>
includes the time required for the coarse tuning, an accurate coarse tuning tends<br>
to increase the total lock time. Further, as stated earlier, the size reduction of the<br>
analog varactor can improve the phase noise performance, because the analog<br>
varactor typically has a poor quality factor when compared to a discrete capacitor<br>
array used for coarse tuning. Additionally, the size of the analog varactor can be<br>
reduced only when the accurate coarse tuning is guaranteed. If the coarse tuning<br>
is less accurate, then the operating range of the analog varactor can extend beyond<br>
the desired frequency and no phase and frequency lock can be achieved.<br>
Accordingly, the coarse tuning should be performed very fast both for good phase<br>
noise performance and small lock time.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the following detailed description of preferred embodiments, reference<br>
. is made to the accompanying drawings that show, by way of illustration, specific<br>
embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. In the drawings, like<br>
numerals describe substantially similar components throughout the several views.<br>
These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the<br>
art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and structural,<br>
logical, and intellectual changes may be made without departing from the scope of<br>
the present invention. Moreover, it is to be understood that various embodiments<br>
of the invention, although different, are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For<br>
example, a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in one<br>
embodiment may be included within other embodiments. The following detailed<br>
description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present<br>
invention is defined only by appended claims, along with the full scope of<br>
equivalence to which such claims are entitled.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention disclose methods to reduce the<br>
total bit-comparison time of the coarse tuning period. For example, the trade-off<br>
between the coarse tuning time and the accuracy of the coarse tuning can be<br>
resolved by adopting weighted comparison time for the coarse tuning of the each<br>
bit decision. Thus, the bit-comparison time for each coarse tuning bit can be set<br>
differently according to its comparison resolution. <br>
Fig. 7r illustrates a simplified timing diagram of the coarse tuning process in<br>
the related art for comparison purposes. As noted above, the final resolution of<br>
the coarse tuning should be set small enough to allow reduction of the varactor.<br><br>
However, the coarse tuning time fot the each bit also is set large enough to cover<br>
all of the variation in decision process. Those variations can come from the<br>
uncertainty of the lead-and-lag detection logic, other logic delay, noise (e.g., power<br>
supply noise), start-up time of the each component, and the like. Accordingly,<br>
when the number of the coarse tuning bits increases, the total time required for<br>
the coarse tuning increases linearly as illustrated in Fig. 7.<br>
In contrast, Fig. 8 illustrates a simplified timing diagram of the coarse<br>
tuning process according to embodiments of the present invention. Unlike the<br>
example in Fig. 7, the decision time for the each bit can set differently. The last<br>
bit (e.g., LSB) has a longer decision time and the first bit (e.g., MSB) has a shorter<br>
decision time. However, the duration of the each bit can be optimized according<br>
to the specific implementation of the coarse tuning algorithm. Therefore,<br>
weighting the decision time can provide accurate coarse tuning result, while also<br>
reducing coarse tuning time.<br>
Adaptive time regulation for the coarse tuning according to embodiments<br>
of the present invention is provided by incorporating redundant weighting in the<br>
discrete capacitor array for the coarse tuning. Table 1 shows an example for the<br>
implementation of the capacitor array for the coarse tuning. However, those<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate other weighing schemes can be used. In Table 1,<br>
Caps(n) corresponds to the (n-th) capacitor used to tune the frequency of the<br>
VCO. For example, Caps(l) is the last capacitor to be selected through the coarse<br>
tuning process. Referring to Table 1, only the relative weighting factor for the<br>
capacitance value is shown. The weighting factors from Caps(lO) to Caps(7) are<br>
selected by binary weighting for the wide VCO range. Further, the weighting factors<br>
from Caps(6) to Caps(l) can be selected, empirically from the trade-off the coarse tuning<br>
time and the redundancy margin. For example, the weighting of Caps(6) is 10 and the<br>
sum of the weightings from Caps(5) to Caps(l) is 16. So there is redundancy amount of 6<br>
in Caps(6) level.<br><br>
Since the frequency of the LC-VCO is determined by the equation of<br>
  the relative weighting of the capacitance is sufficient to indicate the<br>
variation of the frequency. The redundancy R(i) in the Table 1 can be obtained<br>
using the weighting W(i) by equation (1) as follows.<br><br>
Since the capacitance value corresponds with the frequency, the above equation<br>
indicates that the redundancy can be used to compensate error in the decision<br>
process. For example, R(10) is 10 and thus if the switch for the Caps(10) is<br>
selected in wrong way, this error can be corrected in the following decision<br>
process. However, when the polarity of the switch for Caps(10) is set to zero by<br>
unexpected error in the decision logic and the amount of the redundancy is<br>
negative unlike Table. 1. The coarse tuning process cannot resolve the frequency<br>
error caused by this negative redundancy. In an ideal situation, if the decision<br>
process is perfect and the redundancy can be all set to zero, then the result of the<br>
coarse tuning will also be ideal and the resulting accuracy will be determined by<br>
the smallest weighting factor. However, in practical implementations of the<br>
capacitor array, there is some mismatch between two binary-weighted capacitors.<br>
If there is no redundancy for the lower bits, this mismatch at certain stage cannot<br>
be resolved. Since the amount of the mismatch is proportional to the weighting<br>
factor, the frequency error caused by the mismatch will be less severe for<br>
capacitor arrays with smaller weighting factors. For example, a 10% error for two<br>
binary weighted capacitors, 64 and 1, will result in the error of the capacitance, 6.4<br><br>
and 0.1, respectively. If the final resolution of the tuning capacitor is assumed to<br>
be one, a 10% error in the most-significant bit will give too large an error for the<br>
frequency calculation. Thus, the redundancy is usually given to high index (e.g.,<br>
MSB) value rather than the low index as illustrated in Table 1.<br><br>
Although redundancy in an array of capacitors can intentionally be made to<br>
compensate for fabrication mismatch of the capacitor array, this property can also<br>
be used to reduce the coarse tuning time effectively. Even though some<br>
uncertainty or error happens to exist in the decision process of the coarse tuning,<br>
those errors or uncertainty will be corrected if amount of the error is smaller than<br>
the redundancy amount at that specific index.<br>
For example, assuming that the desired target frequency corresponds to<br>
"130" as the sum of the weighted capacitance, the coarse tuning values of<br>
Caps(10) and Caps(2) should be set to one (e.g., switched on) in the ideal case. For<br>
example, referring to Fig. 6, even though the Caps(10) is set to one, the lead-and-<br>
lag detection logic produces the comparison result of "UP". Accordingly, the<br>
frequency of the VCO should be increased. In this case, it is assumed that the<br>
frequency increases as the number of weighted capacitor increases. Thus, the<br>
effective frequency of the VCO with "1" of Caps(10) is slower than the target<br>
frequency with "130" of the effective weighting value. If the decision logic has<br><br>
some offset and, for example, that value is "3", then the coarse toning value for<br>
Caps(lO) will be one rather than zero. Since the weighting factor given to the<br>
capacitor is a factor to determine the operating frequency of the VCO, the offset<br>
value is directly expressed as timing error when converted to the time domain<br>
from the frequency domain.<br>
For example, if the unit value of "1" corresponds to a period error of 3ns,<br>
then an offset value "3" indicates that the coarse tuning process has a 9ns offset at<br>
its decision. This timing error can be corrected by increasing the comparison time<br>
for each bit. Assuming that only the first decision process has decision error for<br>
simplicity, then the remaining coarse toning decision will be correct. Thus, the<br>
Caps(lO-l) from the coarse tuning will be [0111101101] to get the total weighted<br>
value of 130. Even though the above example is simplified for the decision error,<br>
it is clear that the redundancy helps to compensate the decision error at certain<br>
stage. Redundancy in Caps(N) level,where N32, is the difference between the sum<br>
of Caps from N-1 to 1 and Caps(N). For example, the target VCO frequency is<br>
"13". Let's assume there is a decision error in Caps(6) level and, therefore, Caps(6)<br>
is erroneously selected as "0", instead of the correct "1". Because the weighting of<br>
the Caps(6) is "10" and selected as "0", the rest of the Caps(i.e. Caps(5-1)) should<br>
be selected to cover the target VCO frequency. As a result, Caps, [0000011100],<br>
instead of [0000100100] is selected. So, in case there are decision errors, the rest<br>
of the stages can cover the error with the help of redundancy.<br>
The amount of the mismatch in two binary-weighted capacitor arrays is<br>
typically larger than error sources from the decision logic. Thus, the redundancy<br>
value is designed to be able to compensate for the mismatch rather than the error<br>
in the decision process of the coarse toning. Therefore, the timing error during<br>
the decision process has less impact on the accuracy of the coarse toning. Thus,<br>
the duration of the coarse tuning can be reduced if there is large redundancy.<br>
Since the extension of the duration of the comparison time (e.g., as illustrated in<br>
Fig. 5) can reduce the effect from the decision process, the most accurate decision<br><br>
or longest comparison time can be made when the redundancy is zero. In the<br>
particular example of Table, the coarse tuning controller should have the most<br>
accurate decision when it decides the switching polarity of Caps (3-1) where the<br>
redundancy is zero. The comparison accuracy for the other bits can be relaxed and<br>
thus smaller comparison time can be allowed.<br>
As stated before, when the comparison time is doubled, the accuracy of the<br>
coarse toning process is typically doubled. Assuming that Tmin is the minimum 1-<br>
bit comparison time required for Caps(1-3), the comparison time for Caps(4) can<br>
have the value of Tmin/2 to give correct coarse tuning result Likewise, the<br>
comparison time of Tmin/10 can be used for Caps(10), which will have the same<br>
probability of error with that of Tmin for Caps(1-3).. The following table illustrates<br>
one example procedure for timing according to embodiments of the present<br>
invention.	<br><br><br><br>
As illustrated in Table 2, multiple bits are switched in a different way than<br>
disclosure in the related art. Caps can be switched from the MSB to LSB in pairs,<br>
sequentially. For example, in the first stage, Caps(10) and Caps(9) are selected. In<br>
the second stage, Caps(9) and Caps(8) are selected. Coarse tuning time is limited<br>
by the longest comparison time between neighboring Caps, Caps(N) and Caps(N-<br>
1). In contrast in the related art, Caps(6) and Caps(3) are switched at lie same<br>
stage, thus, coarse tuning time is limited by the redundancy amount of Caps(3).<br>
However, according to the broadwork of the present invention, Caps(6) and<br>
Caps(5) are switched at the same stage, thus, coarse tuning time is limited by that<br>
of Caps(5), not Caps(3). Accordingly, cbarse tuning time can be significantly<br>
reduced compared to the related art systems.<br>
If the same comparison cycle time is applied for the coarse tuning, the total<br>
time for the coarse tuning will be 10* Tmin However, when the adaptive<br>
optimization for the comparison time is made, the total coarse tuning time will be<br>
reduced. For example, the course tuning time of Table 1 is <br>
  Thus, the total coarse tuning is reduced by<br>
greater than two times with essentially the same accuracy. Accordingly, accurate<br>
coarse tuning can be performed by using the adaptive scaling for the comparison<br>
time as described in embodiments of the present invention. The accurate coarse<br>
tuning also allows for a smaller size of the analog varactor, which improves phase<br>
noise performance.<br>
Additionally, the total lock time can be reduced or made consistent across<br>
all conditions by employing techniques described with reference to embodiments<br>
of the present invention. The coarse tuning process is digital and thus its<br>
functionality and the operating time is determined by the initial design. However,<br><br>
the phase lock operation after the coarse tuning is affected by the initial state of<br>
the PFD, the amount of the frequency error, and the variation of the loop<br>
characteristics. Accurate coarse tuning reduces the frequency error to the target<br><br>
frequency after the coarse tuning, and thus the maximum value of the frequency<br>
error can be reduced. Accordingly, the time required to obtain frequency and<br>
phase lock can be reduced. Thus, the total lock time can be regulated and reduced<br>
over all initial frequency errors by the accurate coarse tuning.<br>
The overhead due to accurate coarse tuning is greatly relaxed due to the<br>
adaptation of the comparison time in embodiments of present invention. The<br>
overhead for the accurate coarse tuning and increase of number of bits to be<br>
decided are nulled by the regulation of the coarse tuning time and the time<br>
reduction of the phase lock operation. Accordingly, embodiments of the present<br>
invention can reduce the time of coarse tuning in LC-VCOs and thus reduce the<br>
lock time of PLLs.<br>
The foregoing description relates to coarse tuning methods and<br>
apparatuses for LC oscillators to improve the phase noise performance and to<br>
increase the operating range of the LC oscillator. The coarse tuning increases the<br>
effective lock time of the PLL and this overhead increases as the desired accuracy<br>
of the coarse tuning increases. In embodiments of the present invention, the bit-<br>
comparison time is adaptively controlled to provide the smallest coarse tuning<br>
time. The redundancy in the weighted capacitor array for the coarse tuning allows<br>
for reduced comparison times without sacrificing the accuracy of the coarse<br>
tuning. The bit comparison time is scaled according to the amount of the<br>
redundancy. Since the redundancy of the weighted capacitor is used to<br>
compensate for the mismatch in the capacitance, the use of this property to<br>
reduce the coarse tuning is not an additional burden. Further, if the same time<br>
limit on the coarse tuning time is used, embodiments of the present invention can<br>
increase the accuracy of the coarse tuning. Since accurate coarse tuning can<br>
reduce the operating time and the time variation for the phase lock operation,<br>
embodiments of the present invention can reduce lock time of PLLs.<br><br>
The foregoing embodiments and advantages are merely exemplary and are<br>
not to be construed as limiting the present invention. The present teaching can be<br>
readily applied to other types of apparatuses. The description of the present<br>
invention is intended to be illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the claims.<br>
