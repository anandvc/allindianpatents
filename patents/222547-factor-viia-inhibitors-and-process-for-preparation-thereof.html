Factor Vila Inhibitors<br>
The present invention relates to compounds of the formula I,<br><br>
, in which R\ R2, R81, R92, R93, R94, R85, RS6, R97, r, s and t have the meanings indicated below. The compounds of the formula I are valuable pharmacologically-active compounds. They exhibit a strong antithrombotic effect and are suitable, for example, for the therapy and prophylaxis of thromboembolic diseases or restenoses. They are reversible inhibitors of the blood clotting enzyme factor Vila (F Vila) and can in general be applied in conditions in which an undesired activity of factor Vila is present or for the cure or prevention of which an inhibition of factor Vila is intended. The invention furthermore relates to processes for the preparation of compounds of the formula f, their use, in particular as active ingredients in pharmaceuticals, and pharmaceutical preparations comprising them.<br>
The ability to form blood clots is vital to survival. The. formation of a blood clot or a thrombus is normally the result of tissue injury which initiates the coagulation cascade and has the effect of slowing or preventing blood flow in wound healing. Other factors which are not directly related to tissue injury like atherosclerosis and inflammation may also initiate the coagulation cascade. In general, a relationship exists between inflammation and the coagulation cascade. Inflammation mediators regulate the coagulation cascade and coagulation components influence the<br><br>
production and activity of inflammation mediators. However, in certain disease states the formation of blood clots within the circulatory system reaches an undesired extent and is itself the source of morbidity potentially leading to pathological consequences. It is nevertheless not desirable in such disease states to completely inhibit the blood clotting system because life threatening hemorraghe would ensue, in the treatment of such states a well-balanced intervention into the blood clotting system is required, and there is still a need for substances exhibiting a suitable pharmacological activity for achieving such a result.<br>
Blood coagulation is a complex process involving a progressively amplified series of enzyme activation reactions in which plasma zymogens are sequentially activated by limited proteolysis. Mechanistically the bloodI coagulation cascade has been divided into intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, which converge at the activation of factor X. Subsequent generation of thrombin proceeds through a single common pathway (see Scheme 1). Present evidence suggests that the intrinsic pathway plays an important role in the maintenance and growth of fibrin formation, while the extrinsic pathway is critical in the initiation phase of blood coagulation (H. Cole, Aust. J. Med. Sci. 16 (1995) 87-93; G. J. Braze, Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis 6, Suppl. 1 (1995) S7-S13). It is generally accepted that blood coagulation is physically initiated upon formation of a factor Vila/tissue factor(TF) complex. Once formed, this complex rapidly initiates coagulation by activating factors IX and X. The newly generated activated factor X, i. e. factor Xa, then forms a one-to-one complex with factor Va and phospholipids to form a prothrombinase complex, which is responsible for converting soluble fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin via the activation of thrombin from its precursor prothrombin. As time progresses, the activity of the factor Vila/tissue factor complex (extrinsic pathway) is suppressed by a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor protein, TFPI, which, when complexed to factor Xa, can directly inhibit the proteolytic activity of factor Vila/tissue factor.<br><br><br>
In order to maintain the coagulation process in the presence of an inhibited extrinsic system, additional factor Xa is produced via the thrombin-mediated activity ofMhe intrinsic pathway. Thus, thrombin plays a dual autocatalytic role, mediating itslown production and the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. The autocatalytic naturdfibf' thrombin generation is an important safeguard against uncontrolled bleeding and it ensures that, once a given threshold level of prothrombinase is present, blood coagulation will proceed to completion. Thus, it is most desirable to develop agents that inhibit coagulation without directly inhibiting thrombin but by inhibiting other steps in the coagulation cascade like factor VHa activity.<br>
In many clinical applications there is a great need for the prevention of intravascular blood clots or for some anticoagulant treatment. For example, nearly 50 % of patients who have undergone a total hip replacement develop deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The currently available drugs like heparin and derivatives thereof are not satisfactory in many specific clinical applications. The currently approved therapies include fixed dose iow molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and variable dose heparin. Even with<br><br>
these drug regimes 10 % to 20 % of patients develop DVT, and 5 % to 10 % develop bleeding complications.<br>
Another clinical situation for which better anticoagulants are needed concerns subjects undergoing transluminal coronary angioplasty and subjects at risk for myocardial infarction or suffering from crescendo angina. The present, conventionally accepted therapy which consists of administering heparin and aspirin, is associated with a 6 % to 8 % abrupt vessel closure rate within 24 hours of the procedure. The rate of bleeding complications requiring transfusion therapy due to the use of heparin also is approximately 7 %. Moreover, even though delayed closures are significant, administration of heparin after termination of the procedures is of little value and can be detrimental.<br>
The widely used blood-clotting inhibitors like heparin and related sulfated polysaccharides like LMWH and heparin sulfate exert their anti-clotting effects by promoting the binding of a natural regulator of the clotting process, anti-thrombin III, to thrombin and to factor Xa. The inhibitory activity of heparin primarily is directed toward thrombin, which is inactivated approximately 100 times faster than factor Xa. Hirudin and hiruiog are two additional thrombin-specific anticoagulants presently in clinical trials. However, these anticoagulants which inhibit thrombin also are associated with bleeding complications. Preclinical studies in baboons and dogs have shown that targeting enzymes involved at earlier stages of the coagulation cascade, such as factor Xa or factor Vila, prevents clot formation without producing the bleeding side effects observed with direct thrombin inhibitors (L. A. Harker et al., Thromb. Hemostas. 74 (1995) 464-472). C1-rtain peptides and peptide analogs which inhibit blood clotting by specifically inhibiting factor Xa are disclosed, for example, in WO-A-95729189.<br>
Specific inhibition of the factor Vila/tissue factor catalytic complex using monoclonal antibodies (WO-A-92/06711) or a protein such as chloromethyl ketone inactivated factor Vila (WO-A-96/12800 and WO-A-97/47651) is an extremely effective means of controlling thrombus formation caused by acute arterial injury or tine thrombotic<br><br>
complications rotated to bacterial septicemia. There is also experimental evidence suggesting that inhibition of factor VI ia/tissue factor activity inhibits restenosis following balloon angioplasty (L A. Harker et al., Haemostasis 26 (1996) S 1:76-82). Bleeding studies have been conducted in baboons and indicate that inhibition of the factor Vila/tissue factor complex has the widest safety window with respect to therapeutic effectiveness and bleeding risk of any anticoagulant approach tested including thrombin, platelet and factor Xa inhibition (L A. Harker et al., Thromb. Hemostas. 74 {1995) 464-472).<br>
A specific inhibitor of factor Vila which has a favorable property profile would have substantial practical value in the practice of medicine. In particular, a factor Vila inhibitor would be effective under circumstances where the present drugs of choice, like heparin and related sulfated polysaccharides, are ineffective or only marginally effective. C1-rtain inhibitors of factor Vila have already been described, e. g. in WO-A-89/09612. EP-A-987274 discloses compounds containing a tripeptide unit which inhibit factor VIla. However, the property profile of these compounds is still not ideal, and there is a need for further low molecular weight factor Vila-specific blood clotting inhibitors that are effective and do not cause unwanted side effects. The present invention satisfies this need by providing novel factor Vila activity inhibiting compounds of the formula I.<br>
Thus, a subject of the present invention are compounds of the formula I,<br>

All residues which can occur several times in the compounds of the formula I, for example the residues R40, RM or Het, can each independently of one another have the meanings indicated, and can in each case be identical or different.<br>
As used herein, the term alkyl is to be understood in the broadest sense to mean hydrocarbon residues which can be linear, i. e. straight-chain, or branched and which can be acyclic or cyclic residues or comprise any combination of acyclic and cyclic subunits. Further, the term alkyl as used herein expressly includes saturated groups as well as unsaturated groups which latter groups contain one or more, for example one, two or three, double bonds and/or triple bonds, provided that the double bonds are not located within a cyclic alkyl group in such a manner that an aromatic system results. All these statements also apply if an alkyi group carries substituents or occurs as a substituent on another residue, for-example in an alkyloxy residue, an alkyloxycarbonyl residue or an arylalkyl residue. Examples of alkyl residues containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, penty!, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tetradecyi, hexadecyl, octadecyl and eicosyl, the n-isomers of all these residues, isopropyl, isobutyl, 1-methyibutyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, 2,2-dimethylbutyl, 2-methylpentyl, 3-methylpentyl, isohexyl, 2,3,4-trimethylhexyl, isodecyi, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, or tert-pentyl.<br><br>
Unsaturated alkyl residues are, for example, alkenyl residues such as vinyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl (= ally I), 2-butenyl, 3-fcutenyl. 2-methyl-2-butenyl, 3-methyl-2-butenyl, 5-hexenyl or 1,3-pentadienyl, or alkynyl residues such as ethynyl, 1-propynyl, 2-propynyl (= propargyl) or 2-butynyl. Alkyl residues can also be unsaturated when they are substituted.<br>
Examples of cyclic alkyl residues are cycloalkyl residues containing 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 ring carbon atoms like cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyciopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl or cyclooctyl which can also be substituted and/or unsaturated. Unsaturated cyclic alkyl groups and unsaturated cycloalkyl groups like, for example, cyclopentenyl or cyclohexenyl can be bonded via any carbon atom. The term alkyl as used herein also comprises cycloalkyl-substituted alkyl groups like cyclopropylrnethyl-cyclobutylmethyl-, cycfopentylmethyl-, cyclohexylmethyl-, cycloheptylmethyl-, cyclooctylmethyl- 1-cyclopropylethyl-, 1-cyclobutylethyl-, 1-cyc!opentyiethyl-, 1-cyclohexylethyl-, 1-cycIoheptylethyl-, 1-cyclooctylethyl-, 2-cyclopropylethy!-, 2-cyclobutylethyl-, 2-cyclopentylethyl-, 2-cyclohexylethyl-, 2-cycloheptylethyl-, 2-cyclooctylethyl-, 3-cycIopropylpropyl-, 3-cyclobutylpropyl-, 3-cyclopentylpropyl-T 3-cyclohexylpropyl-, 3-cycloheptyl propyl-, 3-cyclooctylpropyl- etc. in which groups the cycloalkyl subgroup as well as acyclic subgroup also can be unsaturated and/or substituted.<br>
Of course, a cyclic alkyl group has to contain at least three carbon atoms and an unsaturated alkyl group has to contain at least two carbon atoms. Thus, a group like (C1-Ca)-alkyl is to be understood as comprising, among others, saturated acyclic (C1-C8)-alkyl, (C3-C8)-cycloalkyi, cycioalkyl-alkyl groups like <c3-c7 wherein the total number of carbon atoms can range from to and unsaturated like or similarly a group is be understood as comprising among others saturated acyclic cyclopropyl-methyl-></c3-c7><br>
Unless stated otherwise, the term alkyl preferably comprises acyclic saturated hydrocarbon residues containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms which can be linear or branched, acyclic unsaturated hydrocarbon residues containing from 2 to 6 carbon atoms which can be linear or branched like (C2~C6)-alkenyl and (C2-C6)-alkynyl, and cyclic alkyl groups containing from 3 to 8 ring carbon atoms, in particular from 3 to 6 ring carbon atoms. A particular group of saturated acyclic alkyl residues is formed by (C1-C4)-alkyi residues like methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyi, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl and tert-butyl.<br>
The above statements relating to alkyi groups do not only apply to monovalent residues but correspondingly to divalent residues like alkanediyl groups, alkylene groups or polymethylene groups examples of which are methylene, 1,2-ethyiene (= ethane-1,2-diyl), 1,1-ethylene (= 1-methyl-methylene), 1 -isobutyl-methyiene, 1,3-propylene, 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propylene, 1,4-butylene, but-2-en-1,4-diyl, 1,2-cyclopropylene, 1,2-cyclohexylene, 1,3-cyclohexylene or 1,4-cydohexylene.<br>
Unless stated otherwise, and irrespective of any specific substituents bonded to alkyl groups which are indicated in the definition of the compounds of the formula I, alkyl groups can in general be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more, for example one, two, three or four, identical or different substituents. Any kind of substituents present in substituted alkyl residues can be present in any desired position provided that the substitution does not lead to an unstable molecule. Examples of substituted alkyl residues are alkyl residues in which one or more, for example 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, hydrogen atoms are replaced with halogen atoms, in particular fluorine atoms.<br>
Examples of substituted cycloalkyl groups are cycloalkyl groups which carry as substituent one or more, for example one, two, three or four, identical or different acyclic alkyl groups, for example acyclic (d-C-alky! groups like methyl groups. Examples of substituted cycloalkyl groups are 4-methyicyclohexyi, 4-tert-butylcyclohexyl or 2,3-dimethylcyclopentyl.<br><br>
The term aryl refers to a monocyclic or pofycyclic hydrocarbon residue in which at least one carbocyclic ring is present that has a conjugated pi electron system. In a (C1--C14)-aryl residue from 6 to 14 ring carbon atoms are present. Examples of (C1--C14)-aryl residues are phenyl, naphthyt, biphenylyl, fiuorenyl or anthracenyi. Examples of (Cs-C1o)-aryl residues are phenyl or naphthyt Unless stated otherwise, and irrespective of any specific substituents bonded to aryl groups which are indicated in the definition of the compounds of the formula I, aryl residues including, for example, phenyl, naphthyl and fiuorenyl can in general be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more, for example one, two, three or four, identical or different substituents. Aryl residues can be bonded via any desired position, and in substituted aryl residues the substituents can be located in any desired position.<br>
In monosubstituted phenyl residues the substituent can be located in the 2-position, the 3-position or the 4-position, the 3-position and the 4-position being preferred. If a phenyl group carries two substituents, they can be located in 2,3-position, 2,4-position, 2,5-position, 2,6-position, 3,4-position or 3,5-position. In phenyl residues carrying three substituents the substituents can be located in 2,3,4-position, 2,3,5-position, 2,3,6-position, 2,4,5-position, 2,4,6-position, or 3,4,5-position. Naphthyl residues can be 1-naphthyl and 2-naphthyl. In substituted naphthyl residues the substituents can be located in any positions, for example in monosubstituted 1-naphthyl residues in the 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-,- 7-, or 8-position and in monosubstituted 2-naphthyl residues in the 1-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, or 8-position. Biphenylyl residues can be 2-biphenylyl, 3-biphenylyl or4-biphenylyl. Fiuorenyl residues can be 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- or 9-fluorenyl. In monosubstituted fiuorenyl residues bonded via the 9-position the substituent is preferably present in the 1-, 2-, 3- or 4-position.<br>
Unless stated otherwise, substituents that can be present in substituted aryi groups are, for example, (C1-C8)-alkyl1 in particular (C,-C4)-alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl or tert-butyl, hydroxy, (C1-C1-)-alkyloxy, in particular (C1-C4)-alkyIoxy, such as methoxy, ethoxy or tert-butoxy, methyienedioxy, ethyienedioxy, F, CI, Br, 1, cyano, nitro, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, hydroxymethyl, formyl, acetyl, amino, mono- or di-(C1-C4)-alkyJamino, ((C1-C4)-afkyl)carbonylamino like acetylamino, hydroxycarbonyl,<br><br>
;(C1-C4)-aikyioxy)carbonyl, carbamoyl, optionally substituted phenyl, benzyl optionally substituted in the phenyl group, optionally substituted phenoxy or benzyioxy optionally substituted in the phenyl group. A substituted aryl group that can be present in a specific position of the compounds of formula I can independently of other aryl groups be substituted by substituents selected from any desired subgroup of the substituents listed before and/or in the definition of that group. For example, a substituted aryl group may be substituted by one or more identical or different substituents from the group consisting of (C1-C4)-alkyI, hydroxy, (C1-C4)-alky!oxy, F, CI, Br, I, cyano, nitro, trifluoromethyl, amino, phenyl, benzyl, phenoxy and benzyioxy. Preferably not more than two nitfb groups are present in the compounds of the formula I.<br>
The above statements relating to aryl groups correspondingly apply to divalent residues derived from aryl groups, i. e. to arylene groups like phenylene which can be unsubstituted or substituted 1,2-phenylene, 1,3-phenylene or 1,4-phenylene, or naphthylene which can be unsubstituted or substituted 1,2-naphthalenediyl, 1,3-naphthalenediyl, 1,4-naphthalenediyl, 1,5-naphthalenediyl, 1,6rnaphthalenediyl, 1,7-naphthalenediyl, 1,8-naphthalenediyl, 2,3-naphthalenediyl, 2,6-naphthalenedlyl or 2,7-naphthalenediyl. The above statements also correspondingly apply to the aryl subgroup in arylalkyl- groups. Examples of arylalkyl- groups which can also be unsubstituted or substituted in the aryl subgroup as well as in the alkyl subgroup, are benzyl, 1 -phenylethyl, 2-phenylethyl, 3-phenyipropyl, 4-phenylbutyl, 1-methyi-3-phenyi-propyl, 1-naphthylmethyl, 2-naphthyimethyl, 1-(1-naphthyl)ethyl, 1-(2-naphthyl)ethyl, 2-(1-naphthyl)ethyl, 2-{2-naphthyl)ethyl, or 9-fluorenylmethyl. All these explanations also corresponding apply to aromatic rings which may be condensed (or fused) to a ring formed by the groups R21 and R22 and the carbon atom to which these groups are attached.<br>
The group Het comprises groups containing 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 ring atoms in the parent monocyclic or bicyciic heterocyclic ring system. In monocyclic groups Het the heterocyclic ring preferably is a 3-membered, 4-membered, 5-membered, 6-membered ,or 7-membered ring, particularly preferably a 5-membered or 6-<br><br>
membered ring. In bicyclic groups Het preferably two fused rings are present one of which is a 5-membered ring or 6-membersd heterocyclic ring and the other of which is a 5-membered or 6-membered heterocyclic or carbocyclic ring. 1. e., a bicyclic ring Het preferably contains 8, 9 or 10 ring atoms, particularly preferably 9 or 10 ring atoms.<br>
Het comprises saturated heterocyclic ring systems which do not contain any double bonds within the rings, as well as mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated heterocyclic ring systems which contain one or more, for example one, two, three, four or five, double bonds within the rings provided that the resulting system is stable. Unsaturated rings may be non-aromatic or aromatic, i. e. double bonds within the rings in the group Het may be arranged in such a manner that a conjugated pi electron system results. Aromatic rings in a group Het may be 5-membered or 6-membered rings, i. e. aromatic groups in a group Het contain 5 to 10 ring atoms. Aromatic rings in a group Het thus comprise 5-membered and 6-membered monocyclic heterocycles and bicyclic heterocycles composed of two 5-membered rings, one 5-membered ring and one 6-membered ring, or two 6-membered rings. In bicyclic aromatic groups in a group Het one or both rings may contain heteroatoms. Aromatic groups Het may also be referred to by the customary term heteroaryl for which all the definitions and explanations above and below relating to Het correspondingly apply. Alt these explanations also corresponding apply to heteroaromatic rings which may be condensed (or fused) to a ring formed by the groups R21 and R22 and the carbon atom to which these groups are attached.<br>
Unless stated otherwise, in the groups Het and any other heterocyclic groups preferably 1, 2, 3 or 4 identical or different ring heteroatoms from the series consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur atoms are present. Particularly preferably in these groups 1 or 2 identical or different heteroatoms from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur are present. The ring heteroatoms can be present in any desired number and in any position with respect to each other provided that the resulting heterocyclic system is known in the art and is stable and suitable as a<br>
subgroup in a drug substance. Examples of parent structures of heterocycles from<br>
i<br><br>
Atiich the group Het can be derived are aziridine, oxirane, azetidine, pyrrole, furan, thiophene, dioxole, imidazole, pyrazole, oxazole, isoxazole, thiazole, isothiazole, 1,2,3-triazole, 1,2,4-triazole, tetrazole, pyridine, pyran, thiopyran, pyridazine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, 1,2-oxazine, 1,3-oxazine, 1,4-oxazine, 1,2-thiazine, 1,3-thiazine, 1,4-thiazine, 1,2,3-triazihe, 1,2,4-triazine, 1,3,5-triazine, azepine, 1,2-diazepine, 1,3-diazepine, 1,4-diazepine, indole, isoindole, benzofuran, benzothiophene, 1,3-benzodioxote, indazole, benzimidazole, benzoxazole, benzothiazole, quinoline, isoquinoline, chromane, isochromane, cinnoiine, quinazoline, quinoxaltne, phthafazine, pyridoimidazoles, pyridopyridines, pyridopyrimidines, purine, pteridine etc. as well as ring systems which result from the listed heterocycles by fusion (or condensation) of a carbocycllc ring, for example benzo-fused, cyclopenta-fused, cyclohexa-fused or cyclohepta-fused derivatives of these heterocycles.<br>
The fact that many of the before-listed names of heterocycles are the chemical names of unsaturated or aromatic ring systems does not imply that the groups Het could only be derived from the respective unsaturated ring system. The names here only serve to describe the ring system with respect to ring size and the number of the heteroatoms and their relative positions. As explained above, the group Het can be saturated or partially unsaturated or aromatic, and can thus be derived not only from the before-listed heterocycles themselves but also from all their partially or completely hydrogenated analogues and also from their more highly unsaturated analogues if applicable. As examples of completely or partially hydrogenated analogues of the before-listed heterocycles from which the groups Het may be derived the following may be mentioned: pyrroline, pyrrolidine, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydrothiophene, dihydropyridine, tetrahydropyridine, piperidine, 1,3-dioxoiane, 2-imidazoline, imidazoline, 4,5~dihydro~1,3-oxazol, 1,3-oxazolidine, 4,5-dihydro-1,3-thiazote, 1,3-thiazo!idine, perhydro-1,4-dioxane, piperazine, perhydro-1,4-oxazine (= morpholine), perhydro-1,4-thiazine (= thiomorpholine), perhydroazepine, indoline, isoindoline, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, etc.<br><br>
The residue Het may be bonded via any ring carbon atom, and in the case of nitrogen heterocycles via any suitable ring nitrogen atom. Thus, for example, a pyrrolyl residue can be 1-pyrrolyl, 2-pyrrolyi or 3-pyrrolyl, a pyrroiidinyl residue can be 1-pyrrolidinyi (= pyrrolidine), 2-pyrroiidinyl or 3-pyrrolidinyl, a pyridyl residue can be 2-pyridyi, 3-pyridyl or4-pyridyl, a piperidinyi residue can be 1-piperidinyl {= piperidino), 2-piperidinyl, 3-piperidinyi or 4-piperidinyl. Fury! can be 2-furyl or 3-furyl, thienyl can be 2-thienyI or 3-thienyl, imidazolyl can be 1-imidazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl or 5-imidazoiyl, 1,3-oxazolyl can be 1,3-oxazol-2-yl, 1,3-oxazol-4-yl or 1,3-oxazol-5-yl, 1,3-thiazolyi can be 1,3-thiazol-2-yl, 1,3-thiazo!-4-yl or 1,3-thiazol-5-yl, pyrimidinyi can 'De 2-pyrimfdinyl, 4-pyrirnidinyl (= 6-pyrimidinyI) or 5-pyrimidiriyl, piperazinyl can be 1-piperazinyl (= 4-piperazinyl = piperazino) or 2-piperazinyl. indoiyl can be 1-indoiyl, 2-indolyi, 3-indoiyl, 4-indolyl, 5-indolyl, 6-indolyi or 7-indolyl. Similarly, benzimidazolyl, benzoxazolyi and benzothiazblyi residues can be bonded via the 2-position and via any of the positions 4, 5, 6, and 7, benzimidazolyl also via the 1-position. Quinolyl can be 2-quinolyl, 3-quinolyl, 4-quinolyl, 5-quino(yl, 6-quinolyl, 7-quinolyl or 8-quinolyl, isoqinolyl can be 1-isoquinolyl, 3-isoquinolyl, 4-isoquinolyl, 5-isoquinolyl, 6-isoquinolyl, 7-isoquinolyl or 8-isoquinolyl. In addition to being bonded via any of the positions indicated for quinolyl and isoquinolyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolyl and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolyl can also be bonded via the nitrogen atoms in 1-position and 2-position, respectively.<br>
Unless stated otherwise, and irrespective of any specific substituents bonded to groups Het or any other heterocyclic groups which are indicated in the definition of the compounds of the formula I, the group Het can be unsubstituted or substituted on ring carbon atoms with one or more, for example one, two, three, four or five, identical or different substituents like (C1-C8)-aikyl, in particular (C1-C-alkyl, (C1-Cs)-alkyloxy, in particular (d-C-O-alkyloxy, (C1-C4)-alkylthio, halogen, nitro, amino, ((C1-C4)-alkyi)carbonylamino like acetylamino, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, hydroxy, oxo, hydroxy-{C1-C4)~alkyl such as, for example, hydroxymethyl or 1-hydroxyethyl or 2-hydroxyethyl, methylenedioxy, ethylenedioxy, formyl, acetyl, cyano, methyisulfonyl, hydroxycarbonyi, aminocarbonyl, (C1-C4)-alkyloxycarbonyl, optionally substituted<br>
phenyl, optionally substituted phenoxy, benzyl optionally substituted in the phenyl<br>
i<br><br>
group, benzyloxy optionally substituted in the phenyl group, etc. The substituents can be present in any desired position provided that a stable molecule results. Of course an oxo group cannot be present in an aromatic ring. Each suitable ring nitrogen atom in a group Het can independently of each other be unsubstituted, i. e. carry a hydrogen atom, or can be substituted, i. e. carry a substituent like (d-C8)-alkyl, for example (C1-C4)-alkyl such as methyl or ethyl, optionally substituted phenyl, phenyl-(C1-C4)-alkyl, for example benzyl, optionally substituted in the phenyl group, hydroxy-(C2-C4)-alkyl such as, for example 2-hydroxyethyi, acetyl or another acyl group, methyisulfony! or another suifonyl group, aminocarbonyi, (C1-C4&gt;-alkyloxycarbonyl, etc. Nitrogen heterocyctes can also be present as N-oxides or as quaternary salts. Ring sulfur atoms can be oxidized to the sulfoxide or to the sulfone. Thus, for example a tetrahydrothienyl residue may be present as S,S-dioxotetrahydrothienyl residue or a thiomorpholinyl residue like 4-thiomorpholinyl may be present as 1-oxo~ 4-thiomorpholinyl or 1,1-dioxo-4-thiomorpholinyl. A substituted group Het that can be present in a specific position of the compounds of formula I can independently of other groups Het be substituted by substituents selected from from any desired subgroup of the substituents listed before and/or in the definition of that group.<br>
The explanations relating to the residue Het correspondingly apply to divalent residues Het including divalent heteroaromatic residues which may be bonded via any two ring carbon atoms and in the case of nitrogen heterocycles via any carbon atom and any suitable ring nitrogen atom or via any two suitable nitrogen atoms. For example, a pyridinediyl residue can be 2,3-pyridinediyl, 2,4-pyridinediyl, 2,5-pyridinediyl, 2,6-pyridinediyl, 3,4-pyridinediyl or 3,5-pyridinediyl, a piperidinediyl residue can be, among others, 1,2-piperidinediyl, 1,3-piperidinediyl, 1,4-piperidinediyl, 2,3-piperidinediyl, 2,4-ptperidinediyl or3,5-piperidinediy!, a piperazinediyl residue can be, among others, 1,3-piperazinediyl, 1,4-piperazinediyl, 2,3-piperazinediyl, 2,5-piperazinediyl, etc. The above statements also correspondingly apply to the Het subgroup in the groups Het-alkyk Examples of such groups Het-alkyl- which can also be unsubstituted or substituted in the Het subgroup as well as in the alky! subgroup, are (2-pyridy!)methyl, (3-pyridyl)methyi, (4-pyridyl)methyl, 2-(2-pyridyl)ethyl, 2-
 <br>
those skilled in the art, for example by combining a compound of the formula I with an inorganic or organic acid or base in a solvent or dispersant, or from other salts by cation exchange or anion exchange. The present invention also includes all salts of the compounds of the formula I which, because of low physiologically tolerability, are not directly suitable for use in pharmaceuticals but are suitable, for example, as intermediates for carrying out further chemical modifications of the compounds of the formula I or as starting materials for the preparation of physiologically tolerable salts.<br>
The present invention furthermore includes all solvates of compounds of the formula I, for example hydrates or adducts with alcohols. The invention also includes derivatives and modifications of the compounds of the formula I, for example prodrugs, protected forms and other physiologically tolerable derivatives including esters and amides, as well as active metabolites of the compounds of the formula I. Such esters and amides are, for example, (C1-CO-alkyl esters, unsubstituted amides or (C1-C4)-alkylamides. The invention relates in particular to prodrugs and protected forms of the compounds of the formula I which can be converted into compounds of the formula i under physiological conditions. Suitable prodrugs for the compounds of the formula !, i. e. chemically modified derivatives of the compounds of the formula I having properties which are improved in a desired manner, for example with respect to solubility, bioavailability or duration of action, are known to those skilled in the art. More detailed information relating to prodrugs is found in standard literature like, for example, Design of Prodrugs, H. Bundgaard (ed.), Elsevier, 1985,, Fieisheret al., Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 19 (1996) 115-130; or H. Bundgaard, Drugs of the Future 16 (1991) 443 which are all incorporated herein by reference. Suitable prodrugs for the compounds of the formula I are especially ester prodrugs and amide prodrugs of carboxylic acid groups, and also acyl prodrugs and carbamate prodrugs of acylatable nitrogen-containing groups such as amino groups, amidtno groups and guanidino groups. In the acyl prodrugs and carbamate prodrugs one or more, for example one or two, hydrogen atoms on nitrogen atoms in such groups are replaced with an acyl group or a carbamate group. Suitable acyl groups and carbamate groups for acyl prodrugs and carbamate prodrugs are, for example, the groups Rp1-CO- and Rp20-CO-, in which Rp1 is hydrogen, (Ct-C18)-alkyl, (C3-C8)-cycloalkyl, (C3-C8)-<br><br>
cycloalkyi-(C1-C4)-alky!-, (C6-C14)-aryl, Het-, (C6-C14)-aryi-(C1-C4)~alkyi- or Het-(C1-C4)-a!kyl- and in which RpZ has the meanings indicated for Rp1 with the exception of hydrogen.<br>
From another point of view the concept of converting a compound of the formula 1 into a derivative or a prodrug can also be regarded as protecting or masking functional groups like amino groups, amidino groups, guanidino groups, carboxy groups etc. that are present in the compound of the formula I. As already mentioned, the present invention also relates to all such protected forms for which some details are exemplarily given in the following.<br>
For example, the compounds of the invention can be chemically modified or protected at any amino group such that the amino group carries as a substituent, for example, an acetyl, cyclopentyicarbonyl, allyloxycarbonyl, propyloxycarbonyl, benzoyl or other such group, in which groups further substituents can optionally be present as described above. The term amino group is used broadly herein to refer to any acylatable amino group, including a primary or secondary amino group. Such amino groups can occur, for example, at the N-terminus of the compound of the formula I, or as substituents in alkyl groups or aryl groups or in the side chain of an amino acid building block, for example in the groups RS6, R97 or R2. The term N-terminus refers to the a-amino group of the first amino acid unit present in a compound of the formula I written in the conventional manner of representing a peptide, i. e. to the group RRJN. Specifically the N-terminus of a compound of the invention can be protected by linking thereto an amino-protecting group.<br>
The term protecting group (or blocking group) is used broadly herein to refer to a conventional chemical group that can replace a hydrogen atom present in an amino group and that is introduced by reacting the amino group with an amino-protecting agent, including, for example, the a-amino group present at the N-terminus of a compound of the invention. An amino-protecting group protects the otherwise reactive amino group against undesirable reactions as can occur, for example, due to exopeptidase activity on a final compound of the formula I but also, for example,<br><br>
1-' during a synthetic procedure or during storage of a compound. As already mentioned, the modification of an amino group can also provide additional advantages including, for example, increasing the solubility or the bioactivity of the compound. Various amino-protecting groups are known in the. art and include, for example, acyl groups such as formyl, acetyl, picoloyl, tert-butyiacetyl, tert-butyloxycarbonyl, allyioxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl or benzoyl groups, as well as aminoacyl residues which themselves can be modified by an amino-protecting group. Other amino-protecting groups are described, for example, in Gross and Meienhofer (eds.), The Peptides, vol. 3, Academic Press, 1981, or in Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed., pages 309-405, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. The product of any such modification of the N-terminus amino group of a compound of the formula I is referred to as an N-terminal derivative.<br>
The above explanations relating to protecting groups on amino groups in the compounds of formula I correspondingly apply to protecting groups on amtdino groups and guanidino groups. Like in an amino group, in these latter groups which may for example represent the residue R95, a hydrogen atom may be replaced with an acyl group like, for example, formyl, {(C1-C4)-alkyl)carbonyl, ((C1-C4)-alkyi)oxycarbonyl, (C6-C14)-arylcarbonyl„ (Cs-C14)-aryl-(C1-C4)-alkyloxycarbonyl etc. in order to improve the property profile of a compound of the formula I in a desired manner.<br>
Similarly, the compounds of the invention can be chemically modified at any carboxy group by introducing a carboxy-protecting group. The term protecting group (or blocking group) is also used broadly herein to refer to a conventional chemical group that can replace the hydrogen atom or the hydroxy group or the oxo group of a carboxy group (COOH) or the total carboxy group. Carboxy groups that may advantageously be present in protected form or modified form can occur, for example, as substituents in alkyl groups or aryl group or in the side chain of an amino acid building block, for example in the groups R98, R97 and R2. A carboxy group can<br>
be protected or modified, for example by a conventional reduction of the carboxy<br>
i<br><br>
group or of an derivative thereof like an ester which leads to an alcohol group CH2OH or an aldehyde group CHO that replaces the group COOH. A carboxy group can also be protected by converting the group COOH into an ester group, for example by formation of an oral ester. Oral esters are well known in the art and include, for example, aikyloxymethyl esters such as (C1-C4)-aikyioxymethy! esters like methoxymethyi, ethoxymethyl, isopropoxymethyl esters and the like; 1-(C1-C4)-alkyloxyethyl esters such as 1-methoxyeihyl, 1-ethoxyethyl, 1-propoxyethyi, 1-isopropoxyethyl esters and the like; 2-oxo-1,3-dioxolen-4-ylmethyl esters such as 5-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxolen-4-ylmethyi, 5-pheny!-2-oxo-1,3-dioxolen~4-ylmethyl esters and the like; (C1-C4)~alkylthiomethyl esters such as methylthiomethyl, ethylthiomethyl, isopropyithiomethyl esters and the like; acyloxymethyl esters such as pivaloyloxymethyl, acetoxymethyl esters and the like; 1-ethoxycarbonylmethyl ester; 1-acyloxy-1 -substituted methyl esters such as 1 -acetoxyethyl; 3-phthalidyi or 5,6-dimethyl-3-phthalidyl esters; 1-({C1-C4)-alkyloxycarbonyloxy)ethyl esters such as 1 -(ethoxycarbonyloxy)ethy! ester; and 1 -{(C1-C4)-alkyiaminocarbonyloxy)ethy! esters such as 1-(methylaminocarbonyloxy)ethyi ester. A carboxy group may also be modified by replacement of the total carboxy group with a substituent such as a 2-thiazolyl, tetrazolyl, cyclohexyl or another group. Carboxy-protecting groups like the above ones are well known in the art (see, for example, Greene and Wilts, loc. cit., pages 224-276, which is incorporated herein by reference) and protect a carboxy group against undesirable reactions as explained above with respect to amino-protecting groups.<br>
The -N(R92)-C(R96){R97)-CO- unit present in the compounds of formula I represents the residue of an a-amino acid which is formally obtained from the respective a-amino acid by removing a hydrogen atom from the N-termina! amino group and the hydroxy group from the C-terminal carboxy group as is customary in peptide chemistry. The groups R96 and/or R97 may thus be regarded as corresponding to the groups bonded to the central carbon atom of an a-amino acid, i, e. in the case of an a-monosubstituted a-aminoacid the group R86 corresponds to the hydrogen atom attached to the centra! carbon atom and the group R97 corresponds to the side chain<br><br>
of the amino acid. As is outlined below, the -N(R92)-C(R9B)(R97)-CO- unit may be synthetically incorporated into the compounds of the formula 1 by employing as a building block the respective amino acid of the formula HN(R92)-C(R96)(R97)-COOH. Parent amino acids from which the -N(R82)-C(R96)(R97')-CO- unit may be derived can be natural or unnatural amino acids examples of which are Aad, Asn, Asp, Gin, Glu, hGIn or hGlu. Functional groups in such amino acids can be present in protected form or can be derivatized. Similarly, the -N(R91)-CH(-(CH2V-(substituted phenyl)}-CO- unit present in the compounds of formula I represents me residue of an a-amino acid.<br>
Besides the compounds of the formula I which are defined as described at the beginning, a second subject of the present invention are also compounds of the formula I in which all residues, groups and numbers are defined as described at the beginning except for the residues R98 and R99 which in this second embodiment of the invention are independent of each other and can be identical or different and are selected from the series consisting of hydrogen, hydroxycarbonyl-, (C1-C8)-a!kyloxycarbonyl-, (C6-C14)-aryloxycarbonyl-, (CB-C14)-aryl-{C1-C4)-alkyloxycarbonyl-, aminocarbonyl-, (C1-C8)-alkylaminocarbonyl-, tetrazolyl, -P(0)(OH)2, -S(0)2OH and -S(0)2NH2, in all their stereoisomers forms and mixtures thereof in any ratio, and their physiologically tolerable salts, with the proviso that in this second embodiment of the invention the compounds acetyl-(4-amidinophenylalanyl)-cyclohexylglycyl-(4-methylpyridiniummethyl)amide, acetyl-(4-amidinophenylalanyl)-cyclohexylglycyl-(2-(3-methylpyridinium)ethyl)amide, acetyl-(4-amidinophenylalanyl)-cyclohexylglycyl-(2-(4-methylpyridinium)ethyl)amide, acetyl-(4-amidinophenylaianyl)-cydohexylglycyl-(4-amidinobenzyl)amide, acetyl-(4-amidinophenylalanyl)-cyclohexylglycyl-{3-amidinobenzyl)amide and acetyi-{4-amidinophenylalanyl)-

is hydrogen. As examples of parent amino acids from which in this second embodiment of the invention the -N(R92)-C(R96)(R97)-CO- unit may be derived, Aad, Ala, Asn, Asp, Gin, Glu, hAla, hGIn, hGlu, His, hlle, hLeu, hPhe, hTrp, hTyr, lie, Leu, Nle, Nva, Phe, Phg, Thi, Trp, Tyr, Val, tert-butylgiycine (Tbg), neopentylglycine (Npg), cyctohexylglycine (Chg), cyclohexylalanine (Cha), 2-thienylalanine (Thia), 2,2-diphenylaminoacetic acid or 2-(p-chlorophenyl)aminoacetic acid (cf. Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie {Methods of Organic Chemistry], Volume 15/1 and 15/2, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, 1974) may be mentioned, where functional groups in these amino acids can be present in protected form or can be derivatized.<br>
The structural elements in the compounds of formula I have the following preferred denotations which they can have independently of the denotations of other elements.<br>
The number r, i. e. the number of CH2 groups in the polymethytene chain connecting the phenyl group depicted in formula I and the carbon atom which carries the amino group R1(RS1)N, preferably is 0,1 or 2, more preferably 0 or 1, particularly preferably 1. Thus, preferably the group -(CHzV is a direct bond or one of the groups -CH2- or -CH2-CH2-, more preferably a direct bond or the group -CH2-, particularly preferably the group -CH2-.<br>
The number s, L e. the number of substituents R94 present on the phenyl group depicted in formula i, preferably is 0, 1 or 2, more preferably 0 or 1, particularly preferably 0. In case all substituents R34 present on the phenyl group are halogen atoms, in particular fluorine atoms, a further preferred denotation of s is 4. Positions on the phenyl group to which neither a substituent R94 nor the group Rss-(CH2)r are bonded carry hydrogen atoms. If, for example, s is 0 the phenyl group carries the group R9S-(CH2)r which at any rate is present in the compounds of formula 1, and four hydrogen atoms. The group R8S-(CH2)r can be present in any desired position of the phenyl ring, i. e. in the 2-position, the 3-position or the 4-position. Preferably the group R96-(CH2)t- is present in the 3-position or the 4-position, more preferably it is present in tl-je 4-position (with respect to the group (CH2)r). Substituents R94 can be<br><br>
present in any desired position of the phenyl group not occupied by the group R9S-(CH2)r. Thus, if the group R9S-(CH2)r is present in the 4-position and s is 1, the single substituent R94 can be present in the 2-position or the 3-position where the 3-position is preferred. If the group R9S-(CH2)t- is present in the 3-position (with respect to the group (CH2)r) and s is 1, the single substituent R84 can be present in the 2-position, the 4-position, the 5-position or the 6-position where the 4-position is preferred. If the group R95-(CH2)r is present in the 4-position and s is 2, the two substituents R94 can be present in 2,3-position, 2,5-positlon, 2,6-position or the 3,5-position where the 3,5-position is preferred.<br>
i The number t, i. e. the number of the CH2 groups in the potymethylene chain<br>
connecting the phenyl group depicted in formula 1 and the group R96, preferably is 0<br>
or 1, more preferably 0. Thus, preferably the group -(CH2)r is a direct bond or the<br>
group -CH2-. More preferably the group -{CH2)r is a direct bond, i. e. the group R95 is<br>
directly bonded to the phenyl group.<br>

The present invention also relates to processes of preparation by which the impounds of the formula i are obtainable. The compounds of the formula I can generally be prepared by linkage of two or more fragments (or building blocks) which :an be derived retrosynthetically from the formula I. In the preparation of the sompounds of the formula I it can generally be advantageous or necessary in the course of the synthesis to introduce functional groups which could lead to undesired reactions or side reactions in a synthesis step in the form of precursors which are later converted into the desired functional groups, or to temporarily block functional groups by a protective group strategy suited to the synthesis problem. Such strategies are well known to those skilled in the art (see, for example, Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed., John Wiley and Sons, 1991). As examples of precursor groups nitro groups may be mentioned which can later be converted by reduction, for example by catalytic hydrogenation, into amino groups, or cyano groups may be mentioned which may later be converted into amidino groups or, by reduction, into aminomethy! groups. Protecting groups (or blocking groups) that may be present on functional groups include allyl, tert-butyl, benzyl, tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) and 9fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) as protecting groups for hydroxy, carboxyfic acid, amino, guanidino and amidino groups.<br>
In particular, in the preparation of the compounds of the formula I building blocks are connected by performing one or more amide couplings (or condensations), i. e. by forming amide bonds between a carboxylic acid group (or a similar group like a sulfonic acid group) of one building block and an amino group (or a similar group) of another building block. For example, compounds of the formula I can be prepared by linking the building blocks of the formulae II, Hi and IV by means of forming in a manner known per se an amide bond between the carboxylic acid derivative group CO-Y1 depicted in formula II and the nitrogen atom depicted in formula III and by<br><br>
'orming a further amide bond between the carboxylic acid derivative CO-Y2 depicted n formula III and the nitrogen atom depicted in formula IV.<br><br>
In the compounds of formulae II, III and IV the groups R\ R2, R91, R92, R93, R84, R95, R96, R97 and r, s and t are defined as above, but functional groups in these compounds can also be present in the form of precursor groups which are later converted into the groups present in the compounds of the formula I, or functional groups can be present in protected form. Y1 and Y2 which can be identical or different are hydroxy or other nucleophilicaliy substitutable leaving groups, i, e. the groups COY1 and COY2 in the compounds of the formulae II and III are carboxylic acid groups COQH or activated derivatives of carboxylic acids such as, for example, acid chlorides, esters like {C1-C4)-aikyi esters or activated esters, or mixed anhydrides.<br>
The starting compounds of the formulae II, HI and IV and other compounds which are employed in the synthesis of the compounds of formula I for introducing certain structural units, are commercially available or can be readily prepared from commercially available compounds by or analogously to procedures described below or in the literature which is readily available to one skilled in the art.<br>
For the preparation of the compounds of formula I first the compounds of the formulae II and HI may be condensed and the resulting intermediate product is then<br><br>
ondensed with a compound of the formula IV to give a compound of the formufa I, or irst the compounds of the formulae III and IV may be condensed and the resulting ntermediate product is then condensed with a compound of the formula II to give a impound of the formula I. After any such step in the course of such syntheses &gt;rotecting and deprotecting steps and conversions of precursor groups into the iesired final groups may be carried out and further modifications may be made. For jxample, a group like R1 that is different from hydrogen may already be present in he compound of formula II which is employed into the coupling reaction with the compound of formula III or with the intermediate obtained from the compounds of ormula III and IV, but the group R1 may also be introduced only after performing one ;oupling reaction or both coupling reactions. The synthetic strategy for the sreparation of a compound of the formula I can thus be varied broadly, and it depends on the individual case which synthetic procedures is preferred.<br>
Various general methods for the formation of an amide bond that can be employed in the synthesis of the compounds of formula I are known to those skilled in the art, for example from peptide chemistry. The coupling step can be carried out by employing a free carboxylic acid, i. e. a compound of the formula II or II! or an intermediate coupling product in which a group COY1 or COY2 reacting in that step is a COOH group, activating that carboxylic acid group, preferably in situ, by means of a customary coupling reagent such as a carbodiimide like dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), or a carbonyldiazole like ca.rbonyidiimidazole, or a uranium salt like 0-((cyano-(ethoxycarbonyl)-methylene)amino)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafiuoroborate (TOTU) orO-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N,,N'-tetramethyiuronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU), or a chloroformic acid ester like ethyl chloroformate or isobutyl chloroformate, or tosyl chloride, or propylphosphonic acid anhydride, or others, and then reacting the activated carboxylic acid derivative with an amino compound. An amide bond can also be formed by reacting an amino compound w'rth a carboxylic acid haiide, in particular a carboxylic acid chloride, which can be prepared in a separate step or in situ from a carboxylic acid and, for example, thionyl chloride, or an carboxylic acid ester or thioester, for example a methyl ester, ethyl ester, phenyl ester, nitrophenyl<br><br>
sster, pentafluorophenyl ester, methylthio ester, phenylthio ester or 2-pyridylthio sster, i. e. with a compound of the formula II or 111 or with an intermediate coupling Droduct in which Y1 or Y2 is CI, methoxy, ethoxy, optionally substituted phenyloxy, nethylthio, phenylthio or 2-pyridylthio.<br>
The activation reactions and coupling reactions are usually performed in the presence of an inert solvent (or diluent), for example in the presence of an aprotic solvent like dimethylformamide (DMF), tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), hexamethyl phosphoric triamide (HMPT), 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), dioxane, or others, or in a mixture of such solvents. Depending on the specific process, the reaction temperature may be varied over a wide range and may be, for example, from about -20 °C to the boiling temperature of the solvent or diluent. Also depending on the specific process,, it may be necessary or advantageous to add in a suitable amount one or more auxiliary agents, for example a base like a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine, or an alkali metal alcoholate, such as sodium methoxide or potassium tert-butoxide, for adjusting the pH or for neutralizing an acid that is formed or for liberating the free base of an amino compound that is employed in the form of an acid addition salt, or an N-hydroxyazole like 1-hydroxybenzotriazo!e, or a catalyst like 4-dimethylaminopyridine. Details on methods for the preparation of activated carboxylic acid derivatives and the formation of amide bonds as well as source literature are given in-various standard references like, for example, J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1992; or Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Georg Thieme Verlag.<br>
Protective groups that may still be present in the products obtained in the coupling reaction are then removed by standard procedures. For example, tert-butyl protecting groups, in particular a tert-butyl ester group which is a protected form of a COOH group, can be deprotected, i. e. converted into the carboxylic acid group in the case of an ester, by treatment with trifluoroacetlc acid. Benzyl groups can be removed by hydrogenation. Fluorenyimethoxycarbonyl groups can be removed by secondary amines like, piperidine. As already explained, after the coupling reaction also<br><br>
functional groups can be generated from suitable precursor groups or, if desired, 'urther reactions can be carried out on the coupling products by standard processes, or example acylation reactions or esterification reactions. In addition, a conversion nto a physiologically tolerable salt or a prodrug of a compound of the formula I can :hen be carried out by known processes.<br>
As examples of the introduction of specific functional groups, procedures for the introduction of amidino groups and guanidino groups may be explained which groups represent, for example, the group R95. Amidines can be prepared from cyano compounds by addition of an alcohol under acidic anhydrous conditions, for example in methanol or ethanol saturated with hydrogen chloride, and subsequent ammonolysis. A furthermethodof preparing amidines is the addition of hydrogen sulfide to the cyano group, followed by methylation of the resulting thioamide and subsequent reaction with ammonia. Another method is the addition of hydroxylamine to the cyano group which leads to a hydroxyamidine. If desired the N-O bond in the hydroxyamidine can be cleaved, for example by catalytic hydrogenation, to give the amidine.<br>
An amino group which may be obtained from a nitro precursor group can be* converted into a guanidino or nitroguanidino group In which latter group the nitro group is a protecting group. For the guanylation or nitroguanylation of an amino group the following reagents can be used which are well known to one skilled in the art and which are all described in the literature: O-methylisourea, S-methylisothiourea, nitro-S-methyiisothiourea, formamtdinesulfonic acid, 3,5-dimethyl-1 -pyrazolyiformamidinium nitrate, N,N'-di-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-S-methyiisothiourea, or N-alkyloxycarbonyl- and N.N'-dialkyloxycarbonyl-S-methylisothiourea.<br>
In general, a reaction mixture containing a final compound of the formula I or an intermediate is worked up and, if desired, the product is then purified by customary processes known to those skilled in the art. For example, a synthesized compound can be purified using well known methods such as crystallization, chromatography or reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) or other methods<br><br>
of separation based, for example, on the size, charge or hydrophobicity of the compound. Similarly, well known methods such as amino acid sequence analysis, NMR, 1R and mass spectrometry (MS) can be used for characterizing a compound of the invention.<br>
The reactions described above and below that are carried out in the syntheses of the compounds of the formula I can generally be carried out according to the methods of conventional solution phase chemistry as well as according to the methods of solid phase chemistry which both are customarily applied in peptide synthesis. Among the various strategies that may be employed if compounds of the formula I are to be prepared on solid phase the following strategy for the preparation of compounds in which a hydroxycarbonyl group is present in the group R86 or the group R97 may be mentioned. As starting material a compound of the formula Fmoc-HN-C(R96)(R97)-CO-OPG is employed in which Fmoc is 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyI, PG is a carboxyitc acid protecting group, and R9e and R97 are defined as above with the proviso that in one of the groups R96 and R97 a free hydroxycarbonyl group COOH is present. Said starting compound is attached to Wang resin {S. S. Wang, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 95 (1973) 1328) by coupling the COOH group to the resin. Then the Fmoc protecting group is deaved off and a compound of formula II is coupled to the amino group. Subsequently the PG protecting group is cleaved off and the resulting carboxyiic acid group is coupled to a compound of formula IV. Finally the compound is cleaved off from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid. When solid phase synthesis methods are used functional groups that are present can be modified or functional groups can be introduced into the nascent compound while it is attached to the resin or after the compound has been cleaved off from the resin to obtain, for example, an N-terminai derivative such as an N-terminal allyloxycarbonylated compound or a derivative of a carboxy group which group can, for example, be amidated. A compound of the invention may also be synthesized by combining steps performed according to the methods of solution phase organic chemistry and steps performed according to the methods of solid phase organic chemistry. A compound of the invention can also be synthesized using an automated synthesizer.<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention inhibit the activity of the blood coagulation enzyme factor Vila. In particular, they are specific inhibitors of factor Vila. As used herein, the term specific when used in reference to the inhibition of factor Vila activity means that a compound of the formula I can inhibit factor Vila activity without substantially inhibiting the activity of other specified proteases involved in the blood coagulation and/or the fibrinolysis pathway including, for example, factor Xa, piasmin and thrombin (using the same concentration of the inhibitor). The activity of the compounds of the formula I can be determined, for example, in the assays described below or in other assays known to those skilled in the art. Preferred compounds of the present invention are those compounds which have a Ki s 10 uM, particularly preferably £ 1 uM, for factor Vila inhibition as determined in the assay described below, and which preferably do not substantially inhibit the activity of other proteases involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis relative to the inhibition of factor Vila (using the same concentration of the inhibitor). The compounds of the invention inhibit factor Vila catalytic activity either directly, within the prothrombinase complex or as a soluble subunit, or indirectly, by inhibiting the assembly of factor Vila into the prothrombinase complex.<br>
Because of their factor Vila inhibitory activity the compounds of the formula I are useful pharmacologically active compounds which are suitable, for example, for influencing blood coagulation (or clotting) and fibrinolysis and for the therapy and prophylaxis of, for example, cardiovascular disorders, thromboembolic diseases or restenoses. The compounds of the formula I and their physiologically tolerable salts and their prodrugs can be administered to animals, preferably to mammals, and in particular to humans as pharmaceuticals for therapy or prophylaxis. They can be administered on their own, or in mixtures with one another or in the form of pharmaceutical preparations which permit enteral or parenteral administration and which contain, as active constituent, an effective amount of at least one compound of the formula I and/or its physiologically tolerable salts and/or its prodrugs in addition to a pharmaceuticaily acceptable carrier.<br>
The present invention therefore also relates to the compounds of the formula I and/or<br>
I<br><br>
their physiologically tolerable salts and/or their prodrugs for use as pharmaceuticals (or medicaments), to the use of the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and/or their prodrugs for the production of pharmaceuticals for the inhibition of factor Vila or for influencing blood coagulation or fibrinolysis or for the therapy or prophylaxis of the diseases mentioned above or below, for example for the production of pharmaceuticals for the therapy and prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders, thromboembolic diseases or restenoses. The invention also relates to the use of the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and/or their prodrugs for the inhibition of factor Vila or for influencing blood coagulation or fibrinolysis or for the therapy or prophylaxis of the diseases mentioned above or below, for example for use in the therapy and prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders, thromboembolic diseases or restenoses, and to methods of treatment aiming at such purposes including methods for said therapies and prophylaxes. The present invention furthermore relates to pharmaceutical preparations (or pharmaceutical compositions) which contain an effective amount of at least one compound of the formula I and/or its physiologically tolerabte salts and/or its prodrugs in addition to a pharmaceutical acceptable carrier, i. e. one or more pharmaceutical acceptable carrier substances (or vehicles) and/or additives (or excipients).<br>
The pharmaceuticals can be administered orally, for example in the form of pills, tablets, lacquered tablets, coated tablets, granules, hard and soft gelatin capsules, solutions, syrups, emulsions, suspensions or aerosol mixtures. Administration, however, can also be carried out rectally, for example in the form of suppositories, or parenteral, for example intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously, in the form of injection solutions or infusion solutions, microcapsules, implants or rods, or percutaneously or topically, for example in the form of ointments, solutions or tinctures, or in other ways, for example in the form of aerosols or nasal sprays.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations according to the invention are prepared in a manner known per se and familiar to one skilled in the art, pharmaceutical acceptable inert inorganic and/or organic carrier substances being used in addition to<br><br>
the compound(s) of the formula 1 and/or its (their) physiologically tolerable salts and/or its (their) prodrugs. For the production of piils, tablets, coated tablets and hard gelatin capsules it is possible to use, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts, etc. Carrier substances for soft gelatin capsules and suppositories are, for example, fats, waxes, semisolid and liquid polyols, natural or hardened oils, etc. Suitable carrier substances for the production of solutions, for example injection solutions, or of emulsions or syrups are, for example, water, saline, alcohols, glycerol, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose, vegetable oils, etc. Suitable carrier substances for microcapsules, implants or rods are, for example, copolymers of glyeolie acid and lactic acid. The pharmaceutical preparations normally contain about 0.5 to about 90 % by weight of the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and/or their prodrugs. The amount of the active ingredient of the formula I and/or its physiologically tolerable salts and/or its prodrugs in the pharmaceutical preparations, normally is from about 0.5. to about 100.0 mg, preferably from about 1 to about 600 mg.<br>
In addition to the active ingredients of the formula I and/or their physiologically acceptable salts and/or prodrugs and to carrier substances, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain additives such as, for example, fillers, disintegrantstj; binders, lubricants, wetting agents, stabilizers, emulsifiers, preservatives, sweeteners, colorants, flavorings, aromatizers, thickeners, diluents, buffer substances, solvents, solubiiizers, agents for achieving a depot effect, salts for altering the osmotic pressure, coating agents or antioxidants. They can also contain two or more compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and/or their prodrugs, in case a pharmaceutical preparation contains two or more compounds of the formula I the selection of the individual compounds can aim at a specific overall pharmacological profile of the pharmaceutical preparation. For example, a highly potent compound with a shorter duration of action may be combined with a long-acting compound of lower potency. The flexibility permitted with respect to the choice of substituents in the compounds of the formula I allows a great deal of control over the biological and physico-chemical properties of the compounds and thus allows the selection of such desired compounds. Furthermore, in addition to<br><br>
at least one compound of the formula 1 and/or its physiologically tolerable salts and/or ts prodrugs, the pharmaceutical preparations can aiso contain one or more other therapeutically or prophylactically active ingredients.<br>
\s inhibitors of factor Vila the compounds of the formula i and their physiologically tolerable salts and their prodrugs are generally suitable for the therapy and prophylaxis of conditions in which the activity of factor Vila plays a role or has an undesired extent, or which can favorably be influenced by inhibiting factor Vila or by decreasing its activity, or for the prevention, alleviation or cure of which an inhibition of factor Vila or a decrease in its activity is desired by the physician. As inhibition of factor Vila influences blood coagulation and fibrinolysis the compounds of the formula I and their physiologically tolerable salts and their prodrugs are generally suitable for reducing blood clotting, or for the therapy and prophylaxis of conditions in which the activity of the blood coagulation system plays a role or has an undesired extent, or which can favorably be influenced by reducing blood clotting, or for the prevention, alleviation or cure of which a decreased activity of the blood coagulation system is desired by the physician. A specific subject of the present invention thus are the reduction or inhibition of unwanted blood clotting, in particular in an individual, by administering an effective amount of a compound I or a physiologically tolerable salt or a prodrug thereof, as well as pharmaceutical preparations therefor.<br>
Conditions in which a compound of the formula I can be favorably used include, for example, cardiovascular disorders, thromboembolic diseases or complications associated, for example, with infection or surgery. The compounds of the present invention can also be used to reduce an inflammatory response. Examples of specific disorders for the treatment or prophylaxis of which the compounds of the formula I can be used are coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, vascular restenosis, for example restenosis following angioplasty like PTCA, adult respiratory disstress syndrome, multi-organ failure, stroke and disseminated intravascular clotting disorder. Examples of related complications associated with surgery are thromboses like deep vein and proximal vein thrombosis which can occur following surgery. In view of their pharmacological activity the compounds of the<br><br>
invention can replace other anticoagulant agents such as heparin. The use of a compound of the invention can result, for example, in a cost saving as compared to other anticoagulants.<br>
When using the compounds of the formula i the dose can vary within wide limits and, as is customary and is known to the physician, is to be suited to the individual conditions in each individual case. It depends, for example, on the specific compound employed, on the nature and severity of the disease to be treated, on the mode and the schedule of administration, or on whether an acute or chronic condition is treated or whether prophylaxis is carried out An appropriate dosage can be established using clinical approaches well known in the medical art. in general, the daily dose for achieving the desired results in an adult weighing about 75 kg is from about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg, preferably from about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg, in particular from about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg, (in each case in mg per kg of body weight). The daily dose can be divided, in particular in the case of the administration of relatively large amounts, into several, for example 2, 3 or 4, part administrations. As usual, depending on individual behavior it may be necessary to deviate upwards or downwards from the daily dose indicated.<br>
A compound of the formula I can also advantageously be used as an anticoagulant outside an individual. For example, an effective amount of a compound of the invention can be contacted with a freshly drawn blood sample to prevent coagulation of the blood sample. Further, a compound of the formula I and its salts can be used for diagnostic purposes, for example in in vitro diagnoses, and as an auxiliary in biochemical investigations. For example, a compound of the formula I can be used in an assay to identify the presence of factor Vila or to isolate factor Vila in a substantially purified form. A compound of the invention can be labeled, for example, with a radioisotope, and the labeled compound bound to factor Vila is then detected using a routine method useful for detecting the particular label. Thus, a compound of the formula I or a salt thereof can be used advantageously as a probe to detect the location or amount of factor Vila activity in vivo, in vitro or ex vivo.<br><br>
Furthermore, the compounds of the formula I can be used as synthesis intermediates for the preparation of other compounds, in particular of other pharmaceutical active ingredients, which are obtainable from the compounds of the formula I, for example by introduction of substituents or modification of functional groups.<br>

Pharmacological testing<br>
The ability of the compounds of the formula I to inhibit factor Vila or other enzymes like factor Xa, thrombin, piasmin, or trypsin can be assessed by determining the concentration of the compound of the formula I that inhibits enzyme activity by 50 %, i. e. the ICso value, which is related to the inhibition constant W. Purified enzymes are used in chromogenic assays. The concentration of inhibitor that causes a 50 %<br><br>
decrease in the rate of substrate hydrolysis is determined by linear regression after<br>
plotting the relative rates of hydrolysis (compared to the uninhibited control) versus<br>
the log of the concentration of the compound of formula i. For calculating the<br>
inhibition constant Ki, the IC50 value is corrected for competition with substrate using<br>
the formula	Ki = IC50 / {1 + (substrate concentration / Km)}<br>
wherein Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant (Chen and Prusoff, Biochem. Pharmacol. 22 (1973), 3099-3108; I. H. Segal, Enzyme Kinetics, 1975, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 100-125; which are incorporated herein by reference).<br>
a) Factor Vila Assay<br>
The inhibitory activity (expressed as inhibition constant Ki (FVIla)) of the compounds of formula I towards factor Vila/tissue factor activity was determined using a chromogentc assay essentially as described previously (J. A. Ostrem et al., Biochemistry 37 (1998) 1053-1059 which is incorporated herein by reference). Kinetic assays were conducted at 25 °C in half-area microtiter plates (Costar Corp., Cambridge, Massachusetts) using a kinetic plate reader (Molecular Devices Spectramax 250). A typical assay consisted of 25 ul human factor Vila and TF (5 nM and 10 nM, respective final concentration) combined with 40 pi of inhibitor dilutions in 10% DMSO/TBS-PEG buffer (50 mM Tris, 15 mM NaCI, 5 mM CaCI2, 0.05 % PEG 8000, pH 8.15). Following a 15 minute preincubation period, the assay was initiated by the addition of 35 u! of the chromogenic substrate S-2288 (D-lle-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide, Pharmacia Hepar Inc., 500 uM final concentration).<br>

Rat Arteriovenous Shunt Model of Thrombosis<br><br>
The antithrombotic efficacy of the compounds of the invention can be assessed using rat extracorporeal arteriovenous (AV) shunt. The AV shunt circuit consists of a 20 cm length of polyethylene (PE) 60 tubing inserted into the right carotid artery, a 6 cm length of PE 160 tubing containing a 6.5 cm length of mercerized cotton thread (5 cm exposed to blood flow), and a second length of PE 60 tubing (20 cm) completing the circuit into the left jugular vein. The entire circuit is filled with normal saline prior to insertion.<br>
The test compound is administered by continuous infusion Into the tail vein using a syringe pump and butterfly catheter. The compound is administered for 30 min, then the shunt is opened and blood allowed to flow for a period of 15 min (total of 45 min infusion). At the end of the 15 min period, the shunt is clamped arid the thread is carefully removed and weighed on an analytical balance. Percent inhibition of thrombus formation is calculated using the thrombus weight obtained from control rats, which are infused with saline.<br><br><br>
