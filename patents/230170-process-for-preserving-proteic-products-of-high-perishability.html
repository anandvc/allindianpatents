				<td>PROCESS FOR PRESERVING PROTEIC PRODUCTS OF HIGH PERISHABILITY<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention is directed to a physical process causing the effect of preserving<br>
proteic food (seafood and various types of meat) throughout long periods of time, thereby<br>
preserving the properties of a fresh product, such as its color, smell, texture and taste. At the<br>
same time, with the abovementioned process it is possible to maintain the proteic and<br>
vitaminic contents of the original product.<br>
State of the art<br>
So far, the preservation of food with animal origin (whether from sea, river or earth<br>
animals) has been performed using physical, chemical or physicochemical agents, able to<br>
inhibit or avoid the proliferation of bacteria which causes decomposition of dead organic<br>
matter, simultaneously nullifying the action of fungi, bacteria and enzymes present in the field<br>
of organic decomposition. Nevertheless, the positive action of said agents has never been<br>
wide and effective enough as to definitely, or at least widely, avoid the presence of<br>
decomposition in meat food. Thus, for instance, the action of cold applied as ice over<br>
seafood, with or without disinfecting agents, and the bath or wash of beef or seafood with<br>
antiseptic solutions have not been able to fulfill the need of preservation with a greater extent<br>
and effectiveness with respect to the maintenance of optimal freshness conditions for human<br>
consumption, specially in an extended period of time or in long term. Moreover, known<br>
processes so far do not allow considering a treated product to remain within the<br>
characteristics of a fresh product after 2 years, as is the case of the invention herein<br>
revealed.<br>
Patent ES 2,114,503 B1 reveals a procedure to preserve fresh fish on a<br>
fishing boat based on the application of a variable condition atmosphere.<br>
In this process, the first stage is the storage of the captured<br><br>
fish within holds with airtight compartments, then subjecting the stored product to<br>
a cold stage, at a temperature between -1 and 1°C, and keeping said<br>
temperature throughout all the storage period. In the next stage, a gas<br>
composition determined based on different volumetric percentages of carbon<br>
dioxide (CO2), oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2) is applied to the product, said<br>
percentages being previously determined as a function of time and according to<br>
the type of fish. There is also an atmosphere control stage and an atmosphere<br>
restoring stage 12 to 24 hours before the arrival of the boat into the port.<br>
Patent 4,396,636 reveals a method to produce frozen food based on the<br>
production of an ice coat around the meat during the first 15 minutes, using a<br>
temperature from -80 to -100°C. Then, a mild freezing at temperatures of about -<br>
25 to -35°C is performed to reach 0°C at the center of the product. Afterwards, a<br>
fast freezing at -80 to -100°C to reach a temperature of -6°C or less at the center<br>
of the product is performed, and at last the product is frozen between -25 and -<br>
35°C and is stored at -18 to -20°C until consumed.<br>
Patent application CL 431/1986 reveals a method to preserve the texture<br>
and taste of seafood using thermal processing. To achieve this end, in addition to<br>
the thermal processing, the seafood, e.g. shrimp, is treated with a mixture of an<br>
aldonic acid and its lactones, therewith maintaining the texture and taste of<br>
seafood throughout said thermal processing, with no salt addition. Thus, in<br>
addition to seafood, the product also contains thermally processed gluconic acid.<br>
US Patent 5,965,191 reveals a method to process fish which includes<br>
adding to the fish or spraying it with an alkaline agent.<br>
JP 1171433 discloses a preservation process of meat of tuna wherein the<br>
tuna meat is subjected at extremely low-temperature freeze treatment at -60°C;<br>
packaged in vacuum and a freeze treatment is carry out again.<br>
The importance and main advantage that constitutes the difference<br>
between the abovementioned processes and the present invention is the<br>
absence in this invention of any kind of chemical compound or agent that could<br>
change the desirable properties of the product obtained at the end of the<br>
process, and so no other known process has the goal of obtaining a<br><br>
product (fish) with all the attributes of fresh food, after a long storage<br>
period under the conditions of the process of the present invention.<br>
The judgment of renowned professionals on the nutrition field as<br>
well as experts on the packaging and culinary fields, which collaborated in<br>
the development of this project, allow predicting a definite possibility of<br>
extending the success obtained in the case of experiments with fish to<br>
other food, especially to any other type of meat.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The object of this invention had as initial motivation the need of<br>
resolving aspects that condition fish commercialization from<br>
geographically remote places, such is the case of Chile, thus saving the<br>
economic feasibility of businesses of seafood exportation or distribution<br>
for human consumption, having at the same time a definite possibility to<br>
be extended to other fields in the food industry.<br>
The process of this invention presents special economic and<br>
commercial advantages, mostly because it tends to bring a food product,<br>
intrinsically highly perishable, close to a consumer which is physically or<br>
chronologically remote, keeping its original quality. For instance, in the<br>
case of a commercial entity in the northern hemisphere receiving supplies<br>
from the southern hemisphere, said process would provide both the ability<br>
to optimize annual commercial operation cycles in its businesses and to<br>
capitalize the effects of the abovementioned process. These effects would<br>
consist basically in obtaining food with all the attributes of a fresh product,<br>
such as its original color, texture, smell and taste, after a long period of<br>
time.<br>
Oriented by the inspection and research about the characteristics<br>
and requirements of European and North-American markets, namely<br>
France, Germany, Spain and Canada, and resulting from many long<br>
researches assessed by prestigious laboratories in Chile and abroad as<br>
well as by nutrition, culinary and packaging and vacuum techniques<br>
experts, the work invested in this invention has developed an improved<br>
industrial process which is not comparable in its effects with any known<br><br>
process so far, allowing the consumption of food such as "fresh fish" with<br>
its original organoleptic properties, even after tens of moths from its<br>
capture or treatment.<br>
The process of the invention consists generally in a physical and<br>
natural method that excludes chemical agents, and based on simple sub-<br>
processes, applied in specific sequences, giving as a result the<br>
preservation of food for many months, as registered in certificates issued<br>
by CESMEC laboratories at Santiago de Chile, where it could be<br>
assessed a "fresh-like" state after more than 2 years of preservation, with<br>
better color, smell, texture and taste properties as compared to those from<br>
equivalent food products usually commercialized with a "fresh quality"<br>
denomination.<br>
The process of the invention is simple and comparatively economic.<br>
Its key feature lies on the way by which the product is manipulated and<br>
the sequence by which each specific stage or sub-process is performed,<br>
as well as on the characteristics of certain materials and equipment used<br>
in the process.<br>
The process of the invention may be applied to fish and seafood,<br>
such as southern or European hake, common or gayi hake, sole, turbot,<br>
trout, salmon, jack or horse mackerel, conger eel, grouper or sea bass,<br>
meager, albacore (sword fish), scallop, abalone, limpet and the like, and it<br>
results to be highly competitive in northern hemisphere markets where<br>
these products are well known and commercialized.<br>
The effects of preserving the food as fresh, which are the object of<br>
this invention, are obtained by subjecting the food products, "fish, seafood<br>
or meat", to a simple, natural and effective combination of sub-processes<br>
consisting in the following sequence:<br>
a)	A quick initial freezing to reach -5°C at the center of each piece.<br>
b)	An immediate high vacuum packing process using special materials<br>
	with an outstandingly low permeability to gases and water vapor<br>
 and at the same time resistant to handling and to a wide range of<br>
temperatures.<br><br>
c)	Continuing the quick freezing process to reach a temperature of<br>
-18°C at the center of each piece.<br>
d)	Keeping the product in dark chambers with uniformly low<br>
temperatures around -18°C.<br>
e)	Unfreezing, unpacking and reverse processing the product.<br>
Process of the invention applied to fish<br>
Excellent results have been obtained in the case of proteic products<br>
of high perishability, such as fish, with respect to which long time<br>
experiment series have been developed in Puerto Montt, Santiago and the<br>
northern hemisphere (Europe and Canada), concerning both production<br>
and transport. These results have been certified in due time by CESMEC<br>
(Centra de Estudios, Medici6n y Certificacion de Calidad; Center for<br>
Studies, Measuring and Quality Certification) laboratories, after more than<br>
two years after the products have been subjected to said process.<br>
Obviously, these processes are performed under strictly hygienic<br>
conditions.<br>
Specifically, in the case of fish, the procedure has to be carried out<br>
as long as possible before the rigor mortis point, which is specified as a<br>
way to optimize the product in its "fresh quality"; notwithstanding the<br>
process is still valid without the fulfillment of this condition. The process is<br>
described as follows:<br>
a. Extension of rigor mortis, or application of the process to a<br>
fresh product post-rigor mortis.<br>
The fish is captured and immediately cleaned on the boat. To this<br>
end, the fish is selected, eviscerated and washed, and then put in<br>
chambers within boxes with scales of ice, in order to preserve it at a<br>
temperature as near as possible to 0°C. Usually the fish is maintained in<br>
this state more than 2 and less than 24 hours (time required to cover the<br>
distances from within territorial sea limits to the coast), from its capture<br>
until the arrival to the processing plant.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention considers that the process<br>
could be performed on board, if the facilities are arranged to this purpose.<br><br>
With this method, which consists in keeping the fish at low temperatures,<br>
rigor mortis is prolonged, which is the recommended state to cut meat into<br>
pieces or filets, before lactic acid is produced, preserving its texture and<br>
consistency, and avoiding post-rigor mortis flaccidity.<br>
	Notwithstanding that the abovementioned conditions optimize the<br>
degree of freshness of the treated product, the process of the invention is<br>
also valid when applied to a post-rigor mortis fresh product. The only<br>
resulting consequence is to obtain a product with a different degree of<br>
freshness.<br>
	b. Process of preparation, initial quick freezing, high vacuum<br>
packing and complementary quick freezing.<br>
Once fish has been cut into pieces, filets, medallions, slices, "HG"<br>
(eviscerated and beheaded fish) and the like, it must be frozen quickly<br>
using a IQF (individual quick freezing) process and high vacuum packed,<br>
in agreement with the following steps.<br>
i.- A temperature of -5°C must be reached at the center of the<br>
meat piece, in a maximum of 1.5 hours.<br>
ii.- Using appropriate equipments, the meat piece must be<br>
immediately packed under high vacuum (99%), and adequately<br>
 sealed.<br>
iii The individual quick freezing process must be continued until<br>
reaching a temperature of -18°C at the center of the meat piece in<br>
the next 2 hours, at most. In this way, a temperature of-18°C must<br>
be reached at the center of the meat piece in a maximum of 3.5<br>
hours, including the high vacuum packing time.<br>
With this individual quick freezing process of the pieces, crystal<br>
formation is avoided in meat tissues, avoiding damages to its texture<br>
which could cause lack of consistency and degraded aspect. With said<br>
individual quick freezing and a prompt high vacuum packing at the<br>
intermediate stage, an original intact and natural meat preservation state<br>
is achieved, thus avoiding any damage to the cellular membrane and its<br>
potential dehydration, as well as a possible oxidation.<br><br>
The high vacuum packing material consists in thermoformed bags or<br>
envelopes made with special materials which present a high permeability barrier,<br>
mainly for oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, water vapor and odorants. Such<br>
material could be coextruded laminated polyamide-polyethylene films with high<br>
barrier adhesives, such as EVO/EVAH. These materials are comparatively light,<br>
flexible and resistant, with low permeability to gases, water vapor and odorants,<br>
and high mechanical resistance, while able both to adapt to different forms and<br>
to be subjected to a wide temperature range with no damage.<br>
The so packed product is protected from any contact with the<br>
environment, avoiding any possible microbial, liquid or odorant contamination<br>
during its storage, handling and selling. The absence of oxygen achieved<br>
throughout the vacuum sealing process avoids any possible oxidation, as well<br>
as, outstandingly, any dehydration process to which it could be exposed<br>
otherwise. Moreover, it is understood that the packing material restrain odors and<br>
flavors to be transmitted from and towards the food product, independently of the<br>
temperatures to which said product and package is subjected.<br>
More specifically, in the following table the permeability parameters to be<br>
fulfilled by the packing materials are indicated:<br><br><br>
c.	Preservation.<br>
Industrially speaking, the product is stored in plastified cardboard boxes in<br>
order to protect it from light. These boxes are put into plastic boxes that can be<br>
piled up, or into equivalent storage systems, which are introduced into industrial<br>
freezing chambers, at uniform temperatures around -18°C. Obviously, said<br>
procedure is also valid at domestic scale with small volumes stored in home<br>
freezers.<br>
d.	Use and consumption.<br>
The treated product is removed from the chambers or freezers and is<br>
subjected to defrosting using a clean process to remove it from the vacuum<br>
package. For instance, the product is put into the butter chamber of a regular<br>
refrigerator, at temperatures between -2 and +2°C, thus allowing obtaining of a<br>
fresher product than those usually referred to as "fresh", while treating it like any<br>
other fresh product in such refrigerator chamber, ready to be consumed in 1 to 3<br>
days.<br>
Alternatively, the packaged product at -18°C may be put into a microwave<br>
oven for a few minutes, according to the size and shape of the fish piece, after<br>
which the package is opened and the product is ready to consume, with the<br>
characteristics of a highly fresh product.<br>
The piece of fish may also be put directly in hot water for a few minutes,<br>
inside its package.<br>
Similarly, the most diverse known culinary treatments could be applied as<br>
desired, as starting from a fresh piece of meat.<br>
In summary, the subprocess sequence and the cumulative concurrence of<br>
the four stages (a) to (d) of the abovementioned total process, can be<br>
synthesized as follows:<br>
Rigor mortis is prolonged or a fresh product is processed post rigor<br>
mortis.<br><br>
The product is quick frozen in two stages, packing it after the<br>
first stage using a high vacuum sealing process in packages<br>
having a high degree of impermeability to gases and to water<br>
vapor.<br>
Uniform temperatures around-18°C are maintained.<br>
An inverse process is applied, which consists in the following<br>
steps:<br>
 ■ Removing the product from its package using a<br>
normal defrosting process, or<br>
	■ Cooking the food product in its package in a<br>
microwave oven or in hot water.<br>
By this procedure, a high quality product is obtained which could be<br>
preserved in its original conditions and intact for periods of time exceeding<br>
2	years, provided that it is kept packed and under high vacuum at uniform<br>
temperatures around-18°C.<br>
EXAMPLE OF APPLICATION<br>
The abovementioned process was applied to filets of small<br>
southern hake, named "smurf", taking advantage of its low price and the<br>
possibility to use them as "individual portions". Samples of this product,<br>
treated according to the invention previously described, were taken to<br>
Europe (Spain, France and Germany) and Canada, where it raised great<br>
interest between commercializers of this product, such product being<br>
evaluated as a direct competence to the so-called "fresh" product, which is<br>
usually offered under this denomination after 6 to 8 days at<br>
MERCAMADRID (Madrid, Spain) or at RUNGIS (Paris, France).<br>
After multiple tests, the experimental runs submitted to CESMEC<br>
laboratories were carried out in two periods as follows:<br>
1. - On March 1990, fresh small ("smurf") European hake was purchased<br>
at the small fisher's port of Chinquihue, Puerto Montt, Chile. The<br>
product was transported to a fishing industry at Puerto Montt, where it<br>
 was subjected to the following procedure:<br><br>
i.- Fish was eviscerated;<br>
ii.- Skin was removed from fish;<br>
iii.- Two filets of 150-200 grams each were produced from each<br>
fish;<br>
	iv.- Filets were washed;<br>
v.- Said filets were subjected to a quick freezing process in a<br>
specially adapted freezing tunnel;<br>
vi.- Immediately after a temperature between -18 and -20°C was<br>
reached in the center of the product, filets were packed in high<br>
	vacuum bags;<br>
vii.- Bags were sealed with the product inside, using high vacuum<br>
(approximately 99%) produced by an appropriate MULTIVAC<br>
pump (Germany);<br>
viii.- Samples were stored in refrigerated chambers at constant<br>
	temperatures of around -18°C.<br>
A fraction of the previously described samples was carried to<br>
Europe on July in the same year, in coolers with dry ice, to be tested on a<br>
test market. The product obtained very good acceptance, especially in<br>
places of Spain far away from the coast (for instance, Zaragoza), which<br>
require fresh product that is not usually delivered in an adequate way.<br>
A fraction of the same product was submitted on September in the same<br>
year to be analyzed in CESMEC laboratories at Santiago de Chile, said<br>
product achieving successful results when freshness quality was<br>
assessed, which was measured taking into account four parameters to<br>
define this status: color, smell, taste and texture, wherein said product<br>
obtained the following qualifications:<br>
Organoleptic Assay<br>
Color :	*Typical<br>
Smell :	*Typical<br>
 Taste : *Typical	<br>
 Texture: Firm to pressure<br>
*: Characteristic for the species<br><br>
2.- On October 1990 a second lot of product was prepared, in a<br>
completely analogous way as that described before in point 1 (i to viii),<br>
keeping it in adequate refrigerator chambers at uniform temperatures<br>
of about -18°C until January 1993 (more than 2 years), when the<br>
 same tests were applied at CESMEC laboratories, obtaining results<br>
that characterize a fresh product, measured under the same<br>
abovementioned standards, as follows:<br>
Organoleptic Assay<br>
Color : Normal condition for a fresh product<br>
 Smell : Characteristic for a fresh product<br>
Taste : Characteristic and pleasant<br>
Texture : Firm to pressure, good conservation state, humid (no water<br>
loss), pleasant in the mouth.<br>
It should be noted that the high vacuum packaging process in the<br>
foregoing examples was carried out as the final step after the freezing<br>
process, when the center of the pieces was already at temperatures<br>
around -18°C. Nevertheless, the industrial process is set forth in an<br>
optimized form wherein the high vacuum packing stage is performed after<br>
a first freezing stage, when the center of the pieces reaches a<br>
temperature around -5°C, thus avoiding at maximum any oxidation and<br>
dehydration process. Moreover, at present time different technologies are<br>
available allowing to achieve said both freezing stages in substantially less<br>
time than the specified maxima, which contributes efficiently to the<br>
optimization of the quality of the process and the invention.<br><br>

wide range of temperatures, and also being flexible enough to be able to be adapted to<br>
surfaces of diverse shapes and textures, including soft and sharp edges, according to the<br>
requirements of the high vacuum process.<br>
4.- The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the steps (d) to (g) are carried out<br>
together in a single ad hoc industrial facility, maintaining the specified sequence.<br><br>
A physical process causing the effect of preserving fish or meat food throughout<br>
long periods of time, tens of months, thereby preserving the properties of a fresh<br>
product, such as its color, smell, texture and taste, while preserving the proteic and<br>
vitaminic contents of the original product, is revealed. In the case of fish, the process<br>
consists of the following steps : Capturing, eviscerating, cleaning, and washing the fish,<br>
all in an hygienic environment; Keeping said fish under moderate cold, using ice scales<br>
or adequate cold facilities ; Cutting the fish in agreement with the commercial<br>
requirements to be satisfied ; Subjecting the fish to an initial quick freezing process<br>
reaching -5°C ; Packaging the product in special packages, which possess high<br>
impermeability to gases and water vapor, being flexible and adaptable while being<br>
physically resistant ; Subjecting the packed product to a "high vacuum" process,<br>
wherein "high vacuum" is defined as a 99% vacuum ; Continuing the quick freezing of<br>
the process to reach -18°C ; Keeping the packed product in plastified cardboard boxes<br>
on pile-up systems, at low and uniform temperatures around -18°C ; Using the treated<br>
product; Consuming the treated product by cooking it using normal methods.</td>
