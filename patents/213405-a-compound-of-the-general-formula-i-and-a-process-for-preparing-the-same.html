The compounds of Formula I and their acid addition salts may be prepared by<br><br>
a)<br><br>
reacting a compound of the general formula II,<br><br><br><br><br><br>
wherein R1 has the above meaning, with a compound of the general formula III,<br><br><br><br><br><br>
wherein R2 and R3 have the above meanings, and wherein any reactive groups present are blocked by suitable protective groups, or<br><br>
b)<br><br>
reacting a compound of the general formula IV<br><br><br><br><br><br>
wherein R1 has the above meaning, with a compound of the general formula V,<br><br><br><br><br>
wherein R2 and R3 have the above meanings, and wherein<br>
any reactive groups present are blocked by suitable protective groups,<br>
and subsequently cleaving off any protective groups present again and converting a resulting compound of Formula I if desired into its acid addition salt or converting an acid addition salt into a free compound of Formula I.<br>
According to process variant a), a secondary amino function of a substituted piperazine derivative of Formula II can be reacted with an N,N-disubstituted azidobutinamine of Formula III to obtain a compound of Formula I. The reaction can be carried out in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, such as a dipolar-aprotic solvent, for example ethyl acetate or dimethyl formamide (= DMF), or<br><br><br>
preferably in a mixture of such solvents. A mixture of ethyl acetate and DMF is particularly preferred. Suitable reaction temperatures are between room temperature and the boiling temperature of the solvent or of the solvent mixture. Where compounds of Formula III are used which have additional functional groups which are reactive under the reaction conditions, these additional functional groups are expediently blocked by known protective groups. Suitable protective groups, which can be introduced using known methods and later can be cleaved off again using known methods, are known, for example, from J.A.W. McOmie "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Plenum Press 1973, or from T.W. Green and P.G.M. Wuts "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Wiley and Sons 1991. The person skilled in the art can select suitable protective groups for each case by routine methods.<br>
The compounds of Formula II and their stereoisomeric forms are known from EP 0 655 442 Al, and can be prepared according to the processes described in this patent application or analogously to these processes.<br>
Compounds of Formula III can be prepared by reacting a compound of the general formula VI,<br><br>
wherein R2 and R3 have the above meanings and wherein Y stands for a cleavable leaving group, with an alkali metal azide, preferably sodium azide, in a manner known for azide formation. Suitable leaving groups Y are in particular halogen, preferably chlorine, or alternatively sulphonyloxy groups, which form good leaving groups, for example lower-alkane sulphonyloxy such as methanesulphonyloxy, or<br><br><br>
benzenesulphonyloxy optionally substituted in the benzene ring by halogen or lower alkyl, such as p-toluenesulphonyloxy.<br>
Compounds of Formula VI can be prepared by reacting a compound of Formula V with a compound of the general formula VII,<br>
Y — C—C = C — C	Y	VII<br>
H2	H2<br>
wherein Y has the above meaning, in known manner. Resulting compounds of Formula VI may also be purified if desired. For purification, compounds of Formula VI may for example be converted into suitable salts, such as oxalates, and be purified according to known crystallisation methods. The above salts of the compounds of Formula VI may also be used directly for further reactions.<br>
Secondary amines of Formula V are known per se. The compounds of Formula VII are likewise known per se. Preferably 1,4-dichloro-2-butine can be used as the compound of Formula VII.<br>
According to process variant b), a piperazine-N-butinazide of Formula IV may be reacted with a secondary amine of Formula V to obtain a compound of Formula I. The reaction can be performed in known manner, for example in accordance with a method known from K. Banert, Chemische Berichte 122 (1989) 1963-1967 or by methods analogous thereto, in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions such as ethyl acetate or an ether, for example tetrahydrofuran (= THF) or dioxane. If applicable, in a preferred process variant the secondary amine of Formula V itself, for example morpholine, may be used as solvent. A suitable reaction temperature must be selected depending on the secondary amine of Formula V which is used. If the amine of Formula V is liquid or solid at room temperature, usually<br><br><br><br>
operation is possible at temperatures between room temperature and the boiling point of conventional solvents, for example up to about 100°C. Where readily volatile amines of Formula V are used, for example dimethylamine or diethylamine, expediently operation is at low temperatures, for example between -78°C and -10°C, and preferably at elevated pressure, for example at 1.5 to 3 bar. Reactions at elevated pressure can be performed in known autoclaves. Where amines of Formula V are used which have additional functional groups which are reactive under the reaction conditions - for example a secondary amino function, if piperazine is used -these additional functional groups are expediently blocked by known protective groups. Suitable protective groups, which can be introduced using known methods and later can be cleaved off again using known methods, are known, for example, from the publications mentioned above in process variant a). Where piperazine is used as the amine of Formula V, the tert. butoxycarbonyl group is preferred as  protective group. The person skilled in the art can select suitable protective groups for each case by routine methods.<br>
Compounds of Formula IV are novel compounds which are suitable as intermediate products for the preparation of novel active substances, for example for the preparation ol the compounds of Formula I. The compounds of Formula IV can be prepared by reacting compounds of the general formula VIII,<br><br><br>
VIII<br><br><br><br><br>
wherein R1 and Y have the above meanings, with an alkali metal azide, preferably sodium azide, in a manner known for azide formation.<br>
Compounds of Formula VIII can be prepared by reacting compounds of Formula II with compounds of Formula VII in known manner.<br>
The compounds of Formula I may be isolated from the reaction mixture and purified in known manner. Acid addition salts can be converted into the free bases in conventional manner, and these may if desired be converted in known manner into physiologically compatible acid addition salts.<br>
Physiologically compatible salts of compounds of Formula I are their salts with inorganic acids, for example sulphuric acid, phosphoric acids or hydrohalic acids, preferably hydrochloric acid, or with organic acids, for example lower aliphatic monocarboxylic, dicarboxylic or tricarboxylic acids such as maleic acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, or with sulphonic acids, for example lower alkanesulphonic acids such as methanesulphonic acid or benzenesulphonic acids optionally substituted in the benzene ring by halogen or lower aikyi, such as p-toluenesuiphomc acid. A preferred salt of a compound of Formula I is (2R) -1-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl]-2-(lH-indol-3-ylmethyl)-4-{[5-(morpholinomethyl)-2H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl]methyl}piperazine-dihydrochloride, since it is comparatively readily soluble in water.<br>
The compounds of Formula I at any rate contain a chiral carbon atom, namely the carbon atom bearing the lH-indol-3-ylmethyl radical in position 2 of the piperazine parent structure. The compounds of Formula I can thus be present in several stereoisomeric forms. The present invention comprises both the mixtures of optical isomers and the isomerically pure compounds of Formula I. Preferred are compounds of Formula I wherein the indolylmethyl radical is located in<br><br><br><br>
position 2R of the piperazine ring. If mixtures of optical isomers of the starting compound, for example of the compounds of Formula II or the compounds of Formula IV are used in the synthesis of compounds of Formula I, the compounds of Formula I are also obtained in the form of mixtures of optical isomers. Departing from stereochemically uniform forms of the starting compound, stereochemically uniform compounds of Formula I can also be obtained. The stereochemically uniform compounds of Formula I can be obtained from the mixtures of optical isomers in known manner, for example by chromatographic separation on chiral separating materials or by reaction with suitable optically active acids, for example tartaric acid or 10-camphorsulphonic acid, and subsequent separation into their optically active antipodes by fractional crystallisation of the diastereomeric salts obtained.<br>
In the compounds of Formula I, the 1,2,3-triazole ring may be present in several tautomeric forms, so the hydrogen atom may be bonded to different atoms of the 1,2,3-triazole ring. Within the scope of the present invention, the compounds of Formula I should jointly comprise all possible tautomers of the triazole ring.<br>
The compounds of Formula I and their acid addition salts have properties which are antagonistic to neurokinin (= NK) receptors and are suitable for the treatment of pathological conditions in larger mammals, particularly humans, in which neurokinins are involved as transfer agents. In this case, the group of compounds according to the invention is distinguished by a particularly beneficial action profile which is characterised by a high selective affinity to NK-1 receptors. Furthermore, the group of compounds according to the invention is distinguished by good compatibility even over prolonged periods of administration, and by comparatively good oral bioavailability.<br><br>
Owing to its action profile and to its selective and reversible ability to bond to NK-1-receptors, the group of compounds according to the invention is suitable in particular for inhibiting processes in which neurokinins, such as Substance P, which bind to NK-1 receptors are involved. Thus the compounds are selectively suitable for the treatment of pathological conditions in which Substance P is involved. Substance P plays a part, for example, in the transmission of pain, emesis, neurogenic inflammations, bladder inflammation, inflammatory joint diseases and asthmatic complaints. Owing to the action which is advantageously directed at the peripheral region, the action profile of the compounds is suitable for the treatment of peripheral pathological disturbances, in particular for the treatment of functional and inflammatory disturbances in the gastrointestinal tract. The functional disturbances which can be treated by the compounds according to the invention include in particular the disturbances of the lower intestinal tracts known as so-called "irritable bowel syndrome" (= IBS). The essential symptoms of IBS are pains in the lower abdomen, which appear to be due to hypersensitivity of the visceral afferent nervous system, and anomalies in bowel movement, in particular abnormally accelerated passage of the stool in the colon. The increased visceral sensitivity to pain with respect to mechanical or chemical irritants in the intestinal tract results in IBS patients suffering severe visceral pains even upon only physiological slight distension of the colon owing to digestion, e.g. even upon slight gas formation and slight flatulence, which are scarcely noticed by healthy individuals. Inflammatory disturbances in the gastrointestinal tract which can be favourably influenced by the compounds according to the invention include the inflammatory disturbances in the small intestine and large intestine regions generally grouped under the term IBD (= inflammatory bowel disease), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The action profile of the compounds is distinguished by comparatively good oral bioavailability with beneficial selectivity of the actions antagonistic to<br><br><br>
neurokinin receptors with respect to unwanted side-effects, in therapeutic procedures directed particularly at the peripheral region. Thus, in dose ranges which block the NK-1 receptor, in pharmacological tests no cardiovascular calcium-antagonistic action was detected. Furthermore, it can be assumed of the compounds according to the invention that they have no significant side-effects on the central nervous system.<br>
Description of the pharmacological test methods<br>
The example numbers given for the compounds used as test substances in the pharmacological tests relate to the preparation examples described below.<br>
1. Determination of the binding power of the test substances to NK-1 receptors in vitro.<br>
The affinity of the test substances to human NK-1 receptors was measured in vitro. The inhibition of the binding of the physiological neurokinin (Substance P) to neurokinin-1 receptors was determined.<br>
The receptor binamy studies were performed with [3H]-Substance P as ligand. For the binding test, different samples of a membrane preparation of CHO cells (= egg cells of the Chinese hamster, Chinese hamster oocytes), which express the human NK-1 receptor ("Accession Number" of the associated nucleic acid sequence = M74290; "Accession Number" of the associated protein sequence = P25103; cf. Takeda, Y.; Chou, K. B., Takeda, J./ Sachais, B.S. and Krause, J. E; Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, 179(3) (1991) 1232 - 1240), were incubated with a solution of the marked ligand, with the incubation mixtures containing no test substance or additions of different concentrations of test substance. Then, separation of bound and free ligands was performed in each of the samples with the aid of glass-fibre filtration. The fraction remaining in the filter was<br><br>
f<br><br><br>
washed several times with buffer solution and then the radioactivity of the fraction remaining in the filter was measured using a beta scintillation counter.<br>
For the compounds of Examples 1 and 8 to 65, the affinity to human NK-1 receptors was determined in each case by a single measurement of the test substances in a concentration of 10-7 mol/l. All the above test substances in this test model exhibited displacement of the physiological NK-receptor ligand Substance P of &gt;75%. The compounds of Examples 1, 8-15, 17-29, 34-47, 49-55, 57, 59-60 and 62-65 each exhibited a displacement of &gt;90%.<br>
For the compounds of Examples 2 and 4-6, that concentration which effects half maximum displacement of the bound ligand was determined as IC50 of the respective test substance.   From this, the corresponding inhibition constant (K-L value) of the test substance was calculated, and was stated as the negative common logarithm of the KL  value (= pK1 value) . The pK1 value is a measurement of the affinity of the test substances to human NK-1 receptors. In this test model, the test substances set forth in Table 1 below exhibited the given pK1  values:<br><br>
Table 1:   Affinity of the test substances to human NK-1 receptors<br><br><br><br>
2.   Determination of the functional NK-1 antagonism of the test substances on isolated guinea pig tissue in vitro<br>
The action antagonistic to NK-1 receptors of the test substances was measured in vitro on isolated ring preparations, kept in an oxygenated nutrient solution, of the aortas of Pirbright-White guinea pigs. The inhibition by the test substances of  the  relaxation of tone of the aorta preparations, caused after stimulation with the NK-1 agonist Substance P, was determined.<br>
In order to measure the contraction of the vessel muscles, the preparations were fixed to a hook, joined by a thread to a force measuring apparatus and the contractions were recorded in each case on a plotter. The aorta preparations were tonicised with phenylephrine. Then before and after the administration of the test substance the NK-1 receptors of the preparations were stimulated with 0.01 umol Substance P, which caused relaxation of the tone. The relaxations before and after the administration of the test substance were quantified in percent. The effective concentration of the half maximum inhibition of the relaxation of the tone (= ECsn) was calculated. The negative common logarithm of the EC50 value 1= pEC50) was given as characteristic variable. The PEC50 value is a measurement of the functional effectiveness of the test substances on NK-1 receptors. In this test model, the test substances set forth in Table 2 below exhibited the given pEC50 values:<br><br><br>
Table 2:   Functional NK-1 antagonism of the test substances on isolated guinea pig tissue<br><br>
3. Determination of the substance-P-antagonistic action of the test substances in vivo<br>
In order to demonstrate the substance-P-antagonistic action of the test substances, the transient hypotension caused by intravenous (= i.v.) administration of Substance P in guinea pigs was used as the standard test model for Substance P-induced pharmacological effects. The inhibiting effect of the test substances was determined with respect to vasodepression induced by Substance P on one hand after i.v. and on the other hand after oral (= p.o.) administration of the test substances.<br>
Male guinea pigs each had a catheter implanted in a common carotid artery and a jugular vein under anaesthesia (ketamine 67 mg/kg, xylazine 13 mg/kg). The arterial catheter served to measure the blood pressure. The administration of Substance P and, in the case of i.v. administration, also the administration of the test substance, was effected by means of the venous access. After a 20-minute equilibration phase, 50 pmol/animal of Substance P were administered (bolus, i.v.) as a test stimulus. One minute after administration of the test stimulus, in each case the maximum drop in blood pressure induced thereby was determined as a control for the later stimulation of the NK-1 receptors by the test substance. Then the test substance was administered. For the<br><br><br><br>
i.v. investigation, the test substance was administered in metered doses of 0.01 to 0.1 umol/kg. For the p.o. investigation, the test substance was administered in metered doses of 0.1 to 3.2 umol/kg. Tylose or Tylose/ethanol was used as the vehicle for the p.o. investigations. Then, in each case the extent of the vasodepression inhibited by the test substance was measured, starting 1 minute after administration of test substance, up to 90 minutes after administration of test substance, at intervals of 15 minutes each time. The doses at which, dependent on the time, just 50% inhibition of the Substance P-induced vasodepression occurs due to the test substance were determined from these measured values as ED50 values. The negative common logarithm of the ED50 value (= PED50) was given as characteristic variable.<br>
In this test model, the test substance of Example 1 exhibited a pED50 value of 7.6 one hour after i.v. administration. The same test substance of Example 1 exhibited a pED50 value of 6.2 one hour after p.o. administration. The compound of Example 6 exhibited a pED50 value of 7.0 one hour after i.v. administration. These values prove the high pharmacological potency of the compounds of Formula I, in particulal also for oral administiation.<br>
In the same test model, the test substances were also investigated for vasodepressive effects based on calcium-antagonistic properties. To this end, the action of the test substances on the basal blood pressure was investigated. The substance of Example 1 exhibited no significant vasodepression in the dose range investigated (i.v. doses of up to 0.1 umol/kg and p.o. doses of up to 3.2 umol/kg). This is an indication that no calcium-antagonistic side-effects occurred in this dose range. The low calcium-antagonistic side-effects of the compounds according to the invention can also be demonstrated by in vitro standard test models, for example on isolated ileum tissue of guinea pigs.<br><br><br><br>
In a standard test to determine CNS-permeable compounds having an NK~l-antagonistic effect ("gerbil foot tapping test", cf. N, M. Rupniak, A. R. Williams, European Journal of Pharmacology 265 (1994) 179-183), the compound of Example 1 did not exhibit any effects typical of CNS-permeable NK-1 antagonists even at high doses of up to 30 mg/kg p. o.<br>
The compounds of Formula I may be administered in conventional pharmaceutical preparations. The doses to be used may vary individually and will naturally vary according to the type of condition to be treated and the substance used. In general, however, medicinal forms with an active substance content of 0.1 to 80 mg, in particular 1 to 10 mg, active substance per individual dose are suitable for administration to humans and larger mammals.<br>
The compounds may be contained according to the invention, together with conventional pharmaceutical auxiliaries and/or carriers, in solid or liquid pharmaceutical preparations. Examples of solid preparations are preparations which can be administered orally, such as tablets, coated tablets, capsules, powders or granules, or alternatively suppositories. These preparations may contain conventional pharmaceutical inorganic and/or organic carriers, such as talcum, lactose or starch, in addition to conventional pharmaceutical auxiliaries, for example lubricants or tablet disintegrating agents. Liquid preparations such as suspensions or emulsions of the active substances may contain the usual diluents such as water, oils and/or suspension agents such as polyethylene glycols and the like. Other auxiliaries may additionally be added, such as preservatives, taste correctives and the like.<br>
The active substances may be mixed and formulated with the pharmaceutical auxiliaries and/or carriers in known manner. For the production of solid medicament forms, the active substances may for example be mixed with the auxiliaries and/or carriers in conventional manner and may be<br><br><br>
wet or dry granulated. The granules or powder can be poured directly into capsules or be pressed into tablet cores in conventional manner. These can be coated in known manner if desired.<br>
