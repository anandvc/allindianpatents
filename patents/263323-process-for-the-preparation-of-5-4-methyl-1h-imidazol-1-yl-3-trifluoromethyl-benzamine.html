				<td>PROCESS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides an efficient, safe and cost effective way to prepare 5-(4-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-benzenamine of the following formula (I):<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
which is an intermediate for the preparation of substituted pyrimidinylaminobenzamides of formula (II):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Compounds of formula (II) have been disclosed in W. Breitenstein et al, WO 04/005281 A1, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. These compounds have been shown to inhibit one or more tyrosine kinases, such as c-Abl, Bcr-AbI, the receptor tyrosine kinases PDGF-R, Flt3, VEGF-R, EGF-R and c-Kit. As such, compounds of formula (II) can be used for the treatment of certain neoplastic diseases, such as leukemia.<br>
Previous synthesis of compound (I) involves a 4 step synthetic route starting with an aromatic substitution reaction of compound (III) with compound (IV), which requires employing high energy (150°C) (Scheme 1). <br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Furthermore, transformation of compound (VI) to compound (VII) via Curtius rearrangement utilizes an unsafe reagent, diphenylphosphorylazide. This reaction produces inconsistent product yields and quality, and removal of the resulting diphenylphosphoric acid by-product is difficult. The carbamate product (VII) needs to be purified by chromatography, which is expensive and time consuming for commercial operations.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide alternative processes to make the compound of formula (I) efficiently and in high yields.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to make compound (I) from lower cost starting materials and reagents.<br>
It is a still further object of this invention to provide for a process to make the compound of formula (I) using safer reagents.<br>
It is further objective to use a faster heating and cooling cycle or shorter reaction time intervals, e.g., using microwave fields or by additional heat exchanger capacity in batch<br>
vessels or by using continuous reaction equipment will lead to less decomposition and cleaner reaction.<br>
The present invention overcomes the problems of the reaction shown in Scheme 1 above.<br>
The present invention also includes a novel intermediate compound (XVIII), and its preparation.<br>
 (Formula Removed)<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides novel synthetic processes for the manufacture of 5-(4-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-benzenamine having formula (I):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The compound of formula (I) is an intermediate for the preparation of substituted pyrimidinylamino-benzamides of formula (II):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The compounds of formula (II) have been disclosed in W. Breitenstein et al., WO 04/005281, which published on January 15,2004, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. A preferred compound of formula (II) is 4-methyl-3-[[4-(3-pyridinyl)-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]-/V-[5-(4-methyl-1 H-imidazol-1-yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]benzamide. Compounds of formula (II) can be used for the treatment of certain neoplastic diseases, such as leukemia.<br>
More specifically, the present invention provides the general process of making compound (I) as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein<br>
X is halogen, sulfonate or NO2; and Y is NH2, NO2, halogen or CN.<br>
The general reaction scheme is to react (A) and (III) under suitable reaction conditions to prepare (B). When Y is NH2, then (B) is the compound of formula (I). When Y is NO2 or CN, or X and Y are both halogens, additional process steps are needed, as set forth below.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The general reaction scheme of the invention can be illustrated in the following embodiments:<br>
The first embodiment is represented by reaction Scheme 3:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where Y in compound A is NO2:<br>

When X is Br, Step A comprises the use of a transition metal catalyst and a mild to strong base, and Step B comprises a reduction step using a transition metal catalyst in a suitable polar solvent.<br>
When X is hydrogen, the reaction is modified by Scheme 4:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
This process comprises:<br>
(i) treating 1-nitro-3-trifluoro-methyl-benzene (X) with a brominating agent, preferably with 1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (i.e., 1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethyl-imidazolidine-2,4-dione), in the presence of a strong acid, preferably concentrated sulfuric acid, in an inert solvent, preferably dichloromethane, at a temperature of 25-40°C, preferably 35°C, to give 1-bt*omo-3-nitro-5-trifluoro-methyl-benzene (XI) as main product,<br>
(ii) reacting a mixture of 1-bromo-3-nitro-5-trifluoromethyl-benzene (XI) and 4-methyl-1 /-fimidazole in the presence of a transition metal catalyst, such as a copper, palladium or nickel compound, preferably a copper(l) salt, and a moderately strong to mild base, preferably a carbonate, alkanoate or hydrogencarbonate salt, and optionally a coordinating additive, such as a 1,2-diamine, preferably ethylene-diamine, in a dipolar aprotic solvent, preferably A/,A/-dimethylformamide or 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, at elevated temperature, preferably at 100-120°C, to give 4-methyl-1-(3-nitro-5-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-1 W-imidazole (IX) as the main product,<br>

When X is iodine, Scheme 3 above, Step A comprises the use of a transition metal catalyst and a mild to strong base, and Step B comprises a reduction step using a transition metal catalyst in a suitable polar solvent as shown below in Scheme 5:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Compound (I) can be prepared starting from 1-iodo-3-nitro-5-trifluoromethyl-benzene (XII) using the methodology of steps (ii) and (iii) described above. The preparation of 1-iodo-3-nitro-5-trifluoromethyl-benzene (XII) is described in JMedChem, Vol. 44, p. 4641 (2001).<br>
When X is F, in Scheme 3 above, Step A comprises the use of a strong to mild base in a solvent at an elevated temperature (70-130°C) and Step B comprises a reduction step using a transition metal catalyst in a suitable polar solvent as shown below: <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
This process comprises:<br>
(i) reacting a mixture of 1-fluoro-3-nitro-5-trifluoro-methyl-benzene (XIII) and 4-methyl-1ff imidazole in the presence of a moderately strong to mild base, preferably a carbonate or hydrogencarbonate salt, in a suitable solvent, preferably /V.W-dimethylformamide, A/,/V-dimethylacetamide or 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, at 70-130°C, preferably at 75-100°C, to give 4-methyl-1-(3-nitro-5-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-1H-imidazole (IX) as the main product; and<br>
(ii) reducing 4-methyl-1-(3-nitro-5-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-1H-imidazole (IX), preferably using hydrogen in the presence of a transition metal catalyst, in a suitable polar solvent, preferably methanol or ethanol, and, preferably at an elevated temperature to give 5-(4-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-benzenamine (I). This embodiment can also be a coupling reaction.<br>
In addition, each of the processes described above may optionally involve the transformation of compound (IX) into a salt of the formula (XV), e.g., for purification reasons, as illustrated by the following scheme:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Here, a solution of compound (IX) is treated with an acid, or a solution thereof in water or an organic solvent, followed by isolation of the salt (XV), e.g., by filtration. Compound (IX) may then be obtained by treating salt (XV) with a base, preferably with aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, and isolating the free base (IX) by extraction or crystallization.<br>
For the first embodiment, the strong to mild base is preferably a carbonate, alkonate or hydrogencarbonate; more preferably potassium alkoxide, sodium alkoxide, lithium alkoxide, potassium hydride, sodium hydride, or a carbonate of lithium, sodium, potassium or cesium.<br>
A second embodiment of -Scheme 2 is when Y is NH2. Here a first sub-embodiment is when X is halogen. Where X is Br, the reaction is represented by Scheme 8:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
This reaction involves reacting a mixture of 3-bromo-5-trifluoromethyl-phenylamine (XVI) and 4-methyl-1H-imidazole in the presence of a transition metal catalyst, such as a copper, palladium or nickel compound, preferably a copper(l) salt, and a strong to mild base, preferably a carbonate, alkanoate or hydrogencarbonate salt, and optionally a coordinating additive, such as a 1,2-diamine, preferably cyclohexanediamine, in a dipolar aprotic solvent, preferably diglyme, A/,AWimethylformamide or 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, at elevated temperature, preferably at 100-150°C, to give 5-(4-methyl-1 H-imidazol-1 -yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-benzenamine (I) as the main product.<br>
When X is F, an alternative synthesis of (XIX) and (I) is provided utilizing inexpensive starting material 2-bromo-5-fluoro-benzotrifluoride (XVII). Therefore, a compound of formula (I) can be synthesized by the following scheme:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Nitration of the commercially readily available 2-bromo-5-fluoro-benzotrifluoride (XVII) with potassium nitrate and sulphuric acid gives the novel compound 2-bromo-5-fluoro-1-nitro-3-trifluoro-methyl-benzene (XVIII). Reduction of compound (XVIII) by catalytic hydrogenation on palladium/charcoal affords 3-fluoro-5-trifluoromethyl-phenylamine [compound (XIX)], which is reacted with the sodium salt of 4-methyl-imidazole to produce compound (I). Crude compound (I) comprises the desired product as the main product and at least one regioisomer as a by-product. Crude compound (I) can be recrystallized from toluene and renders pure compound (I) with &gt;99.8 area% purity using HPLC.<br>
It is noteworthy to mention that 3-fluoro-5-trifluoromethyl-phenylamine (XIX) is also commercially available in small quantities, e.g., from ABCR. The synthesis route described herein provides a new synthetic route to make compound (XIX) from the novel versatile compound (XVIII). 3-Fluoro-5-trifluoromethyl-phenylamine (XIX) prepared by this route proved to be identical with a commercially purchased sample from ABCR (ABCR F01075).<br>
The novel compound (XVIII) disclosed herein is a versatile compound and can be used as a starting material for the synthesis of a variety of interesting trif luoromethyl-benzene derivatives, which are intermediates for the preparation of substituted pyrimidinylaminobenzamides of formula (II) which have been shown to have anti-leukemic activities. See WO 04/005281.<br>
A third embodiment of Scheme 2 is when X is F and Y is CN. The reaction, by Hofmann Degradation, is represented by Scheme 10 below:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
A fourth embodiment of Scheme 2 both X and Y are both halogens. This reaction is represented by the following scheme:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
According to this process commercially-available 3-bromo-5-fluoro-benzotrifluoride (XXV) is reacted with 4-methylimidazole (III) at 25*C in the presence of a strong base, such as NaH, thus generating crude compound (XXVI) [containing 16% regioisomer]. Crude compound (XXVI) can be recrystallized from heptane and renders pure bromoarene (XXVI) with no detectable amount of regioisomer. An/lamination of compound (XXVI) and diphenylimine (XXVII) in the presence of a palladium catalyst, a phosphine ligand, and a base, such as the combination of Pd(OAc)2/Xantphos/NaO'Bu or PdtOAcJa/BINAP/NaO'Bu, yields imine (XXVIII). Residual palladium contents in compound (XXVIII) can be reduced to 3.4 ppm after PICA charcoal treatments. Hydrolysis of compound (XXVIII) with aqueous hydrochloric solution produces compound (I) in the form of the HCI salt. The salt can be converted to its free base [compound (I)] with potassium bicarbonate and thus affords pure compound (I) of high quality: HPLC purity &gt;99%; palladium content 0.5 ppm. The process of the present invention is safer, more practical, and commercially acceptable than the previously utilized synthetic pathway (Scheme 1). Other palladium catalyst useful in the above reaction include tetrakis(triphenyl)phospine palladium (0); tris (dibenzylideneacetone dipalladium (0) or pallidum chloride, and other catalysts known to one of skill in the art. Other ligands useful in the above reaction include triphenylphoshine or trialkyl phosphines.<br>

Example 4    3-Fluoro-5-trlfluoromethyl-phenylamlne, compound of formula (XIX)<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
2-Bromo-5-fluoro-1-nitro-3-trifluoromethyl-benzene (XVIII) (55.5 g) is dissolved in 500 mL of eihanol. Triethylamine (19.63 g) and palladium on charcoal (6 g, Pd/C 10%, Engelhard 4505) are added and the mixture is subjected to hydrogenation at 20-25°C. After 20 hours reaction time, the consumption of hydrogen had ceased. The hydrogen pressure is released and the solution is separated from the catalyst by filtration on Cellflock. The filter residue comprising the catalyst is washed with ethanol (2 x 100 mL). The filtrate and wash fractions are combined and the solution thus obtained is concentrated at 45°C under reduced pressure to a final volume of ca. 400 mL. Toluene (400 mL) is added and the resulting solution is concentrated to a final volume of ca. 250 mL to obtain a suspension. The precipitate is removed by filtration and the filter cake is washed with toluene (2 x 100 mL). The solution is concentrated again to a final volume of 200 mL and the formed precipitate is removed again by filtration. The filter cake is washed with toluene (3 x 50 mL). The process of dilution with toluene, concentration and filtration is repeated until no substantial precipitation occurred in the toluene solution.
