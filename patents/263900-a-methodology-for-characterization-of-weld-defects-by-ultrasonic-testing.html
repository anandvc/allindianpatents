				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a methodology for defect detection in raw material semi-<br>
finished and finished products using ultrasonic testing equipment More<br>
particularly, the invention relates to a method for identifying weld defects by<br>
classifying reflected signals in an ultrasonic testing system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Ultrasonic testing is a well established non destructive testing method used in<br>
the industry for the detection of the defects at the different stages of<br>
manufacture namely raw material stage, semi finished stage and final, stage after<br>
manufacture. The method consists of in injecting an ultrasonic wave inside the<br>
test specimen and observing a reflected wave from the defect, if any. The<br>
reflection follows the law of reflection of sound. Thus the presence of a defect is<br>
essentially ascertained by seeing the presence of the reflected sound which is<br>
indicated in a screen after required amplification by the instrument. The nature<br>
of the reflecting surface is checked by the nature of the echo produced in the<br>
screen and this gives the impression on the nature of the defect.<br>
The signal pattern contains information about the nature of the discontinuity.<br>
The present practice is to judge the echo dynamics and drawing conclusions<br>
about the defect and is not standardized in predicting the nature of the defect.<br><br>
RU2325637 describes a method, of exciting a pipe using acoustic damped<br>
oscillations and collecting the signals at different locations along the axis of the<br>
pipeline at equal intervals using laser based systems. Patent US2008i83466<br>
describes a procedure for removing transient signal from speech signals.<br>
US2008179521 describes about a method to remove the noise from an image<br>
produced by a coherent source.<br>
US2008107311 describes a method for the recognition of face in the in a n<br>
image.<br>
WO2008081459 describes a method for compressing the data and wavelet<br>
transformation is employed for this.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a method for identifying<br>
weld defects by classifying reflected signals in an ultrasonic testing system.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a method for identifying weld<br>
defects by classifying reflected signals in an ultrasonic testing system which will<br>
be independent of the operator.<br><br>
An yet another object of the invention is to propose a method for identifying<br>
weld defects by classifying reflected signals in an ultrasonic testing system which<br>
is not influenced by the effectiveness of contact between the transducer and the<br>
test specimen.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to propose a method for identifying weld<br>
defects by classifying reflected signals in an ultrasonic testing system which will<br>
be independent of the surface roughness of the specimen.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to propose a method for identifying weld<br>
defects by classifying reflected signals in an ultrasonic testing system<br>
independent of the strength of the reflected signal.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a method for identifying weld defects by<br>
classifying reflected signals in an ultrasonic testing (UT) system, comprising the<br>
steps of providing an ultrasonic testing (UT) equipment having an ultrasonic<br>
probe, the probe is enabled to generate, receive and convert sound signals into<br>
electrical signals, the U. T. equipment is capable of receiving electrical signals<br>
from the probe and amplifying and displaying the received electrical signals;<br>
injecting ultrasound wave signals via the probe at a predetermined location of a<br>
weld in a job; the sound signals when encountering a defect in the weld get<br>
reflected, the intensity of the reflection of the sound waves depending on the<br>
orientation of the encountered defect in the weld; receiving the reflected sound<br>
signals in the probe when the defect in the weld is so oriented that the reflected<br>
signals are capable of reaching the probe; converting the received sound signals<br><br>
in the probe to .electrical signals and feeding the converted electrical, signals into<br>
the UT - equipment in which the electrical signals being amplified and displayed;<br>
feeding the electrical signals into a computer apparatus embedded with a<br>
software for carrying out wavelet analysis of the received signals; detecting the<br>
plurality of features responsible for said reflection intensity of the sound waves<br>
from the weld defect, depending on the parameters of wavelet transformation<br>
produced through the wavelet analysis; and extracting the more important<br>
features out of said plurality of detected features for identifying the nature of the<br>
weld defects.<br>
According to the present invention, a beam of ultrasound is directed towards a<br>
defect and refection signals from a single defect is collected and analysed. The<br>
sound is ultrasound and is directed towards a specific location. Wavelet analysis<br>
has been associated with noise removal from signals and for image<br>
enhancement.<br>
The present invention encompasses an ultrasonic testing and for finding weld<br>
defects.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Fig. 1: Shows an arrangement for the measurement of the signal and analysis.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
The method includes injecting ultrasound at a specific location in a job (1)<br>
towards a weld (2), by using an ultrasonic probe (3) which is capable of<br>
generating and receiving and converting the received sound signal into electrical<br>
signals. Sound signal when encounters a defect, is reflected back (7). If the<br>
defect is oriented such that the reflected sound signal reaches the transducer<br>
(3), the transducer (3) converts the sound signal to electrical signals which is fed<br>
into an UT equipment (5). The ultrasonic testing equipment (5) displays the<br>
received signal pattern (6) depending on the nature and the size of the defect.<br>
The signal so received by the equipment (5) is again fed into a computer (8),<br>
where it is analyzed by a software. The wavelet analysis is applied to the<br>
received signal. The parameters of the wavelet transformation clearly indicate<br>
the features of the defects responsible for the reflection. The important features<br>
extracted by the wavelet analysis, namely kurtosis function, mean instantaneous<br>
frequency are clearly indicative of the nature of the defect.<br><br>
