BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to scroii compressors for<br>
use in, for example, air conditioners and refrigerators, and<br>
particularly to a scroll compressor having a pin-and-ring<br>
rotation-preventing mechanism.<br>
2. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
A scroii compressor having a pin-and-ring rotation-<br>
preventing mechanism is disclosed in, for example, Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Application, Publication No. 5-321850.<br>
This type of scroll compressor undesirably exhibits<br>
decreased compression performance as a result of increased<br>
compression leakage due to improper engagement between gear<br>
surfaces of an orbiting scroii and a fixed scroll if a<br>
theoretical orbiting radius pth defined by the scrolls (the<br>
engagement between the gear surfaces of the orbiting scroll<br>
and the fixed scroll) is larger than an orbiting radius defined by pins and rings.<br>
The scroii compressor also exhibits decreased compression<br>
performance as a result of increased compression leakage due<br>
to twisting of the orbiting scroii (rotation relative to the<br>
fixed scroll) if the orbiting radius Ppin. defined by the pins<br>
and the rings is larger than the theoretical orbiting radius<br><br><br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In light of the circumstances described above, an object<br>
of the present invention is to provide a scroll compressor<br>
that can achieve excellent engagement between gear surfaces of<br>
fixed and orbiting scrolls and minimize compression leakage to<br>
avoid a decrease in compression performance.<br>
To achieve the above object, the present invention<br>
provides the following solutions.<br>
A scroll compressor according to the present invention<br>
includes an orbiting scroll engaged with a front case by pins<br>
and rings or ring holes to prevent rotation of the orbiting<br>
scroll. The rings or the ring holes have such an inside<br>
diameter that an orbiting radius defined by the pins and the<br>
rings or the ring holes is larger than a theoretical orbiting<br>
radius defined by engagement between gear surfaces of a fixed<br>
scroll and the orbiting scroll. The pins, the rings, or the<br>
ring holes are shifted in such a direction as to relieve<br>
twisting of the orbiting scroll relative to the fixed scroll.<br>
This scroll compressor can prevent engagement failure<br>
between the gear surfaces of the fixed scroll and the orbiting<br>
scroll because the orbiting radius is larger than the<br>
theoretical orbiting radius.<br>
The scroll compressor can also minimize twisting of the<br><br>
orbiting scroll (rotation relative to the fixed scroll)<br>
because the pins, the rings, or the ring holes are shifted in<br>
such a direction as to relieve the twisting of the orbiting<br>
scroll relative to the fixed scroll.<br>
The scroll compressor can thus provide increased ease of<br>
assembly and minimize compression leakage to avoid a decrease<br>
in compression performance.<br>
Another scroll compressor according to the present<br>
invention includes an orbiting scroll engaged with a front<br>
case by pins disposed on an outer end surface of the orbiting<br>
scroll and rings or ring holes disposed on an inner end<br>
surface of the front case to prevent rotation of the orbiting<br>
scroll. The rings or the ring holes have such an inside<br>
diameter that an orbiting radius defined by the pins and the<br>
rings or the ring holes is larger than a theoretical orbiting<br>
radius defined by engagement between gear surfaces of a fixed<br>
scroll and the orbiting scroll. The pins are shifted in such<br>
a direction as to relieve twisting of the orbiting scroll<br>
relative to the fixed scroll.<br>
This scroll compressor can prevent engagement failure<br>
between the gear surfaces of the fixed scroll and the orbiting<br>
scroll because the orbiting radius is larger than the<br>
theoretical orbiting radius.<br>
The scroll compressor can also minimize twisting of the<br>
orbiting scroll (rotation relative to the fixed scroll)<br>
because the pins are shifted in such a direction as to relieve<br>
the twisting of the orbiting scroll relative to the fixed<br>
scroll, that is, in the same direction as a direction in which<br>
the orbiting scroll orbits.<br>
The scroll compressor can thus provide increased ease of<br>
assembly and minimize compression leakage to avoid a decrease<br>
in compression performance.<br>
Another scroll compressor according to the present<br>
invention includes an orbiting scroll engaged with a front<br>
case by pins disposed on an outer end surface of the orbiting<br>
scroll and rings or ring holes disposed on an inner end<br>
surface of the front case to prevent rotation of the orbiting<br>
scroll. The rings or the ring holes have such an inside<br>
diameter that an orbiting radius defined by the pins and the<br>
rings or the ring holes is larger than a theoretical orbiting<br>
radius defined by engagement between gear surfaces of a fixed<br>
scroll and the orbiting scroll. The rings or the ring holes<br>
are shifted in such a direction as to relieve twisting of the<br>
orbiting scroll relative to the fixed scroll.<br>
This scroll compressor can prevent engagement failure<br>
between the gear surfaces of the fixed scroll and the orbiting<br>
scroll because the orbiting radius is larger than the<br>
theoretical orbiting radius.<br>
The scroll compressor can also minimize twisting of the<br>
orbiting scroll (rotation relative to the fixed scroll)<br>
because the rings or the ring holes are shifted in such a<br>
direction as to relieve the twisting of the orbiting scroll<br>
relative to the fixed scroll, that is, in the direction<br>
opposite to a direction in which the orbiting scroll orbits.<br>
The scroll compressor can thus provide increased ease of<br>
assembly and minimize compression leakage to avoid a decrease<br>
in compression performance.<br>
Another scroll compressor according to the present<br>
invention includes an orbiting scroll engaged with a front<br>
case by rings or ring holes disposed on an outer end surface<br>
of the orbiting scroll and pins disposed on an inner end<br>
surface of the front case to prevent rotation of the orbiting<br>
scroll. The rings or the ring holes have such an inside<br>
diameter that an orbiting radius defined by the pins and the<br>
rings or the ring holes is larger than a theoretical orbiting<br>
radius defined by engagement between gear surfaces of a fixed<br>
scroll and the orbiting scroll. The pins are shifted in such<br>
a direction as to relieve twisting of the orbiting scroll<br>
relative to the fixed scroll.<br>
This scroll compressor can prevent engagement failure<br>
between the gear surfaces of the fixed scroll and the orbiting<br>
scroll because the orbiting radius is larger than the<br>
theoretical orbiting radius.<br>
The scroll compressor can also minimize twisting of the<br>
orbiting scroll (rotation relative to the fixed scroll)<br>
because the pins are shifted in such a direction as to relieve<br>
the twisting of the orbiting scroll relative to the fixed<br>
scroll, that is, in the direction opposite to a direction in<br>
which the orbiting scroll orbits.<br>
The scroll compressor can thus provide increased ease of<br>
assembly and minimize compression leakage to avoid a decrease<br>
in compression performance.<br>
Another scroll compressor according to the present<br>
invention includes an orbiting scroll engaged with a front<br>
case by rings or ring holes disposed on an outer end surface<br>
of the orbiting scroll and pins disposed on an inner end<br>
surface of the front case to prevent rotation of the orbiting<br>
scroll. The rings or the ring holes have such an inside<br>
diameter that an orbiting radius defined by the pins and the<br>
rings or the ring holes is larger than a theoretical orbiting<br>
radius defined by engagement between gear surfaces of a fixed<br>
scroll and the orbiting scroll. The rings or the ring holes<br>
are shifted in such a direction as to relieve twisting of the<br>
orbiting scroll relative to the fixed scroll.<br>
This scroll compressor can prevent engagement failure<br>
between the gear surfaces of the fixed scroll and the orbiting<br>
scroll because the orbiting radius is larger than the<br>
theoretical orbiting radius.<br>
The scroll compressor can also minimize twisting of the<br>
orbiting scroll (rotation relative to the fixed scroll)<br><br>
because the rings or the ring holes are shifted in such a<br>
direction as to relieve the twisting of the orbiting scroll<br>
relative to the fixed scroll, that is, in the same direction<br>
as a direction in which the orbiting scroll orbits.<br>
The scroll compressor can thus provide increased ease of<br>
assembly and minimize compression leakage to avoid a decrease<br>
in compression performance.<br>
In the scroll compressors described above, the pins, the<br>
rings, or the ring holes are preferably shifted<br>
circumferentially in a direction that is the same as or<br>
opposite to the direction in which the orbiting scroll orbits.<br>
Such scroll compressors can minimize twisting of the<br>
orbiting scroll relative to the fixed scroll to minimize<br>
compression leakage and thus a decrease in compression<br>
performance.<br>
In the scroll compressors described above, the pins, the<br>
rings, or the ring holes are preferably shifted along a<br>
tangent to a circle passing through the pins, the rings, or<br>
the ring holes in a direction that is the same as or opposite<br>
to the direction in which the orbiting scroll orbits.<br>
Such scroll compressors can achieve increased ease of<br>
processing and reduced production costs.<br>
Another scroll compressor according to the present<br>
invention includes orbiting scroll pins disposed on an outer<br>
end surface of an orbiting scroll and front case pins disposed<br>
on an inner end surface of a front case. The orbiting scroll<br>
pins and the front case pins extend in opposite directions and<br>
are engaged with inner circumferential surfaces of common<br>
rings to prevent rotation of the orbiting scroll. The rings<br>
have such an inside diameter that an orbiting radius: defined<br>
by the orbiting scroll pins, the front case pins, and the<br>
rings is larger than a theoretical orbiting radius defined by<br>
engagement between gear surfaces of a fixed scroll and the<br>
orbiting scroll. The orbiting scroll pins and the front case<br>
pins are shifted in such a direction as to relieve twisting of<br>
the orbiting scroll relative to the fixed scroll.<br>
As described above, the present invention can also be<br>
applied to a scroll compressor including pins protruding from<br>
an orbiting scroll and pins protruding from a front case which<br>
are engaged with inner circumferential surfaces of rings to<br>
prevent rotation of the orbiting scroll.<br>
The scroll compressors according to the present invention<br>
have the advantage of achieving excellent engagement between<br>
gear surfaces of fixed and orbiting scrolls and minimizing<br>
compression leakage to avoid a decrease in compression<br>
performance.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A scroll compressor according to a first embodiment of<br><br>
the present invention will now be described with reference to<br>
Figs. 1 and 2. Fig. 1 is a sectional view of the scroll<br>
compressor according to this embodiment. Fig. 2 is a view of<br>
the scroll compressor in a direction indicated by arrow A of<br>
Fig. 1, showing the relationship between rings disposed on an<br>
inner end surface of a front case and pins disposed on an<br>
outer end surface of an orbiting scroll.<br>
In Fig. 1, a scroll compressor 1 includes a fixed scroll<br>
2 fixed to a housing 7 with bolts 12 and an orbiting scroll 3<br>
that orbits without rotating relative to the fixed scroll 2 to<br>
compress, for example, a refrigerant.<br>
A front case 6 is fixed to the housing 7 on the outer<br>
side of the orbiting scroll 3 (on the left in Fig. 1) to<br>
receive a thrust force from the orbiting scroll 3. The front<br>
case 6 has ring holes 4 (four ring holes 4 arranged every 90"<br>
circumferentially in this embodiment) in an inner end surface<br>
of the front case 6 (a substantially annular surface in<br>
contact with an outer end surface of the orbiting scroll 3)<br>
and rings 11 press-fitted or loosely fitted into the ring<br>
holes 4.<br>
Pins 5 protruding from the outer end surface of the<br>
orbiting scroll 3 (the surface in contact with the inner end<br>
surface of the front case 6) are loosely inserted into the<br>
corresponding rings 11. The number of pins 5 corresponds to<br>
the number of ring holes 4 (four pins 5 in this embodiment).<br><br>
A crank chamber 10 is defined in the center of the inner side<br>
of the front case 6 to accommodate an eccentric shaft 9 and a<br>
balance weight 8.<br>
The orbiting scroll 3 engages with the front case 6 via<br>
the pins 5 loosely inserted into the rings 11 so as not to<br>
rotate while being made to orbit by the eccentric shaft 9.<br>
The pins 5 orbit along inner circumferential surfaces of the<br>
rings 11 in the same direction as the orbiting scroll 3 does.<br>
In this emibodiment, as shown in Fig. 2, the rings 11 and<br>
the ring holes 4 have such inside diameters that an orbiting<br>
radius ppj_j^ defined by the rings 11 and the pins 5 is slightly<br>
larger than a theoretical orbiting radius p^^^ defined by the<br>
scrolls 2 and 3 (engagement between gear surfaces of the<br>
orbiting scroll 3 and the fixed scroll 2) by a length of, for<br>
example, 0.05 to 0.2 mm. In addition, the pins 5 are slightly<br>
shifted in a direction opposite to the direction indicated in<br>
Fig. 6, that is, circumferentially (along an arc) in the same<br>
direction as the direction in which the orbiting scroll 3<br>
orbits, by a distance of, for example, 0.05 to 0.2 mm.<br>
The scroll compressor 1 according to this embodiment can<br>
prevent engagement failure between the gear surfaces of the<br>
fixed scroll 2 and the orbiting scroll 3 because the orbiting<br>
radius p^^^^ is larger than the theoretical orbiting radius Pth-<br>
The scroll compressor 1 can also minimize twisting of the<br>
orbiting scroll 3 (rotation relative to the fixed scroll 2)<br><br>
because the pins 5 are slightly shifted circumferentially<br>
(along an arc) in the same direction as the direction in which<br>
the orbiting scroll 3 orbits.<br>
The scroll compressor 1 can thus provide increased ease<br>
of assembly and minimize compression leakage to avoid a<br>
decrease in compression performance.<br>
A scroll compressor according to a second embodiment of<br>
the present invention will be described with reference to Fig.<br>
3, wherein the same reference numerals as used in the first<br>
embodiment indicate the same components. A scroll compressor<br>
20 shown in Fig. 3 according to this embodiment differs from<br>
the scroll compressor 1 according to the first embodiment as<br>
follows. In Fig. 3, the rings 11 and the ring holes 4 have<br>
such inside diameters that the orbiting radius p ^^^ defined by<br>
the rings 11 and the pins 5 is slightly larger than the<br>
theoretical orbiting radius p^j^ defined by the scrolls 2 and 3<br>
(the engagement between the gear surfaces of the orbiting<br>
scroll 3 and the fixed scroll 2) by a length of, for example,<br>
0.05 to 0.2 mm. In addition, the rings II and the ring holes<br>
4 are slightly shifted in the direction indicated in Fig. 6,<br>
that is, circumferentially (along an arc) in the direction<br>
opposite to the direction in which the orbiting scroll 3<br>
orbits, by a distance of, for example, 0.05 to 0.2 mm. The<br>
other components are the same as used in the first embodiment<br>
and will not be described herein.<br><br>
The scroll compressor 20 according to this embodiment can<br>
prevent engagement failure between the gear surfaces of the<br>
fixed scroll 2 and the orbiting scroll 3 because the orbiting<br>
radius ppj_j^ is larger than the theoretical orbiting radius p^^.<br>
The scroll compressor 20 can also minimize twisting of<br>
the orbiting scroll 3 (rotation relative to the fixed scroll<br>
2) because the rings 11 and the ring holes 4 are slightly<br>
shifted circumferentially (along an arc) in the direction<br>
opposite to the direction in which the orbiting scroll 3<br>
orbits .<br>
The scroll compressor 20 can thus provide increased ease<br>
of assembly and minimize compression leakage to avoid a<br>
decrease in compression performance.<br>
A scroll compressor according to a third embodiment of<br>
the present invention will be described with reference to Fig.<br>
4, wherein the same reference numerals as used in the previous<br>
embodiments indicate the same components. A scroll compressor<br>
30 shown in Fig. 4 according to this embodiment differs from<br>
those according to the previous embodiments as follows. In<br>
Fig. 4, the scroll compressor 30 has the pins 5 on the inner<br>
end surface of the front case 6 and the rings 11 and the ring<br>
holes 4 on the outer end surface of the orbiting scroll 3.<br>
The rings 11 and the ring holes 4 have such inside diameters<br>
that the orbiting radius ppii^ defined by the rings 11 and the<br>
pins 5 is slightly larger than the theoretical orbiting radius<br>
p^^ defined by the scrolls 2 and 3 (the engagement between the<br>
gear surfaces of the orbiting scroll 3 and the fixed scroll 2)<br>
by a length of, for example, 0.05 to 0.2 mm. In addition, the<br>
pins 5 are slightly shifted in the direction indicated in Fig.<br>
6, that is, circumferentially (along an arc) in the direction<br>
opposite to the direction in which the orbiting scroll 3<br>
orbits, by a distance of, for example, 0.05 to 0.2 mm. The<br>
other components are the same as used in the previous<br>
embodiments and will not be described herein.<br>
The scroll compressor 30 according to this embodiment can<br>
prevent engagement failure between the gear surfaces of the<br>
fixed scroll 2 and the orbiting scroll 3 because the orbiting<br>
radius pp^^ is larger than the theoretical orbiting radius p^j^.<br>
The scroll compressor 30 can also minimize twisting of<br>
the orbiting scroll 3 (rotation relative to the fixed scroll<br>
2) because the pins 5 are slightly shifted circumferentially<br>
(along an arc) in the direction opposite to the direction in<br>
which the orbiting scroll 3 orbits.<br>
The scroll compressor 30 can thus provide increased ease<br>
of assembly and minimize compression leakage to avoid a<br>
decrease in compression performance.<br>
A scroll compressor according to a fourth embodiment of<br>
the present invention will be described with reference to Fig.<br>
5, wherein the same reference numerals as used in the first<br>
and second embodiments indicate the same components. A scroll<br><br>
compressor 4 0 shown in Fig. 5 according to this embodiment<br>
differs from those according to the first and second<br>
embodiments as follows. In Fig. 5, the scroll compressor 40<br>
has the pins 5 on the inner end surface of the front case 6<br>
and the rings 11 and the ring holes 4 on the outer end surface<br>
of the orbiting scroll 3. The rings 11 and the ring holes 4<br>
have such inside diameters that the orbiting radius pp^j^<br>
defined by the rings 11 and the pins 5 is slightly larger than<br>
the theoretical orbiting radius p^jj defined by the scrolls 2<br>
and 3 (the engagement between the gear surfaces of the<br>
orbiting scroll 3 and the fixed scroll 2) by a length of, for<br>
example, 0.05 to 0.2 mm. In addition, the rings 11 and the<br>
ring holes 4 are slightly shifted in the direction opposite to<br>
the direction indicated in Fig. 6, that is, circumferentially<br>
(along an arc) in the same direction as the direction in which<br>
the orbiting scroll 3 orbits, by a distance of, for example,<br>
0.05 to 0.2 mm. The other components are the same as used in<br>
the first and second embodiments and will not be described<br>
herein.<br>
The scroll compressor 40 according to this embodiment can<br>
prevent engagement failure between the gear surfaces of the<br>
fixed scroll 2 and the orbiting scroll 3 because the orbiting<br>
radius Pp^^ is larger than the theoretical orbiting radius p^.^.<br>
The scroll compressor 40 can also minimize twisting of<br>
the orbiting scroll 3 (rotation relative to the fixed scroll<br><br>
2) because the rings 11 and the ring holes 4 are slightly<br>
shifted circumferentially (along an arc) in the same direction<br>
as the direction in which the orbiting scroll 3 orbits.<br>
The scroll compressor 40 can thus provide increased ease<br>
of assembly and minimize compression leakage to avoid a<br>
decrease in compression performance.<br>
The pins 5 or the rings 11 and the ring holes 4 do not<br>
necessarily have to be shifted in the direction that is the<br>
same as or opposite to the direction indicated in Fig. 6, that<br>
is, circumferentially at the same radius in the direction that<br>
is the same as or opposite to the direction in which the<br>
orbiting scroll 3 orbits. For example, the pins 5 or the<br>
rings 11 and the ring holes 4 may be shifted in a direction<br>
that is the same as or opposite to the direction indicated in<br>
Fig. 7, that is, linearly (along a tangent to a circle passing<br>
through the pins 5, the rings 11, or the ring holes 4) in the<br>
direction that is the same as or opposite to the direction in<br>
which the orbiting scroll 3 orbits.<br>
If the pins 5 or the rings 11 and the ring holes 4 are<br>
shifted as shown in Fig. 7, increased ease of processing and<br>
reduced production costs can be achieved.<br>
Either the pins 5 or the rings 11 and the ring holes 4<br>
are shifted in the embodiments described above. However, the<br>
present invention is not limited to these embodiments; both<br>
the pins 5 and the rings 11 and the ring holes 4 may be<br><br>
shifted.<br>
The four pins 5, the four rings 11, and the four ring<br>
holes 4 are provided in the embodiments described above.<br>
However, the present invention is not limited to these<br>
embodiments; at least three pins 5, at least three rings 11,<br>
and at least three ring holes 4 may be provided (for example,<br>
five or six) .<br>
The rings 11 are press-fitted or loosely fitted into the<br>
ring holes 4 in the embodiments described above. However, the<br>
present invention is not limited to these embodiments; it may<br>
also be applied to the case where the rings 11 are not<br>
provided in the ring holes 4, that is, where the pins 5 orbit<br>
along the inner circumferential surfaces of the ring holes 4<br>
or the ring holes 4 orbit along the outer circumferential<br>
surfaces of the pins 5.<br>
The present invention may also be applied to a scroll<br>
compressor having a rotation-preventing mechanism shown in<br>
Figs. 8 and 9.<br>
Fig. 8 is a partial sectional view of an end plate of the<br>
orbiting scroll 3 and its vicinity. Orbiting scroll pins 21<br>
(one of them is shown in Fig. 8) protrude from the outer side<br>
of the orbiting scroll 3 while front case pins 22 (one of them<br>
is shown in Fig. 8) protrude from the inner side of a wall<br>
portion of the front case 6. The orbiting scroll pins 21 and<br>
the front case pins 22 extend in opposite directions.<br><br>
Rings 24 (one of them is shown in Fig. 8) corresponding<br>
to the pins 21 and 22 are disposed between the end plate of<br>
the orbiting scroll 3 and the front case 6. Each of the rings<br>
24 has one corresponding pair of pins 21 and 22 engaged with<br>
the inner circumferential surface thereof (see Fig. 9).<br>
The inside diameter of the rings 24 is determined so that<br>
the orbiting radius defined by the rings 24 and the<br>
corresponding pairs of pins 21 and 22 is larger than the<br>
theoretical orbiting radius defined by the engagement between<br>
the gear surfaces of the fixed scroll 2 and the orbiting<br>
scroll 3. This prevents engagement failure between the gear<br>
surfaces of the fixed scroll 2 and the orbiting scroll 3.<br>
In addition, the pins 21 and 22 are shifted in such a<br>
direction as to relieve twisting of the orbiting scroll 3<br>
(rotation relative to the fixed scroll 2) , thus minimizing the<br>
twisting of the orbiting scroll 3.<br><br>
