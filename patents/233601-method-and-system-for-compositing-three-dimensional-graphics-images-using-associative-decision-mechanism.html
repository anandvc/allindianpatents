				<td>METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR COMPOSITING THREE-DIMENSIONAL GRAPHICS IMAGES USING ASSOCIATIVE DECISION MECHANISM<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of computer graphics rendering. More particularly, the invention relates to a method and apparatus for the re-composition of multiple three-dimensional/depth raster images into a two dimensional image.<br>
Cross-Reference to Related Applications<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/442,750 filed on January 28, 2003, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
As with many types of information processing implementations, there is a ongoing effort to improve performance of computer graphics rendering. One of the attractive attempts to improve rendering performance is based on using multiple graphic processing units (GPUs) harnessed together to render in parallel a single scene.<br>
There are three predominant methods for rendering graphic data with multiple GPUs. These include Time Domain Composition, in which each GPU renders the next successive frame, Screen Space Composition, in which each GPU renders a subset of the pixels of each frame, and Scene based Composition, in which each GPU renders a subset of the database.<br>
In Time Domain Composition each GPU renders the next successive frame. A major disadvantage of this method is in having each GPU rendering an entire frame. Thus, the speed at which each frame is rendered is limited to the rendering rate of a single GPU. While multiple GPUs enable a higher frame rate, a delay can be imparted (i.e., impairing latency) in Time Domain Composition applications in the response time of the system to user's input. These delays typically occurs since at any given time only one GPU is engaged in displaying a rendered frame, while all the other GPUs are in the process of rendering one of a series of frames in a sequence. In order to maintain a steady frame rate,<br><br>
the system delays acting on the user's input until the specific GPU that first received the user's input cycles through the sequence and is again engaged in displaying its rendered frame. In practical applications, this condition serves to limit the number of GPUs that are used in a system.<br>
Another difficulty associated with Time Domain Composition applications is related to the large data sets that each GPU should be able to access, since in these applications each GPU should be able to gain access to the entire data used for the image rendering. This is typically achieved by maintaining multiple copies of large data_sets in order to prevent possible conflicts due to multiple attempts to access a single copy.<br>
Screen Space Composition applications have a similar problem in the processing of large data sets, since each GPU must examine the entire data base to determine which graphic elements fall within its part of the screen. The system latency in this case is equivalent to the time required for rendering a single frame by a single GPU.<br>
The Scene Composition methods, to which the present invention relates, excludes the aforementioned latency problems, the requirement of maintaining multiple copies of data sets, and of the problems involved in handling the entire database by each GPU.<br>
The Scene Composition methods well suits applications requiring the rendering of a huge amount of geometrical data. Typically these are CAD applications, and comparable visual simulation applications, considered as "viewers," meaning that the data have been pre¬designed such that their three-dimensional positions in space are not under the interactive control of the user. However, the user does have interactive control over the viewer's position, the direction of view, and the scale of the graphic data. The user also may have control over the selection of a subset of the data and the method by which it is rendered. This includes manipulating the effects of image lighting, coloration, transparency and other visual characteristics of the underlying data.<br>
In CAD applications, the data tends to be very complex, as it usually consists of massive amount of geometry entities at the display list or vertex array. Therefore the construction<br><br>
time of a single frame tends to be very long (e.g., typically 0.5 sec for 20 million polygons), which in result slows down the overall system response.<br>
Scene Composition (e.g. object based decomposition) methods are based on the distribution of data subsets among multiple GPUs. The data subsets are rendered in the GPU pipeline, and converted to Frame Buffer (FB) of fragments (sub-image pixels). The multiple FB's sub-images have to be merged to generate the final image to be displayed. As shown in Fig. 1, for each pixel in the X/Y plane of the final image there are various possible values corresponding to different image depths presented by the FBs' sub-images.<br>
Each GPU produces at most one pixel 12 at each screen's (X/Y) coordinate. This composed pixel 12 is a result of the removal of hidden surfaces and the shading and color blending needed for effectuating transparency. Each of the pixels 12 generated by the GPUs holds a different depth measure (Z-value), which have to be resolved for the highest Z (the closest to the viewer). Only one pixel is finally allowed through. The merging of the sub-image of each FB is the result of determining which value (10) from the various possible pixels values 12 provided by the FBs represents the closest point that is visible in viewer's perspective. However, the merging of the partial scene data to one single raster, still poses a performance bottleneck in the prior art.<br>
The level of parallelism in the prior art is limited, due to the inadequacies in the composition performance of multiple rasters. The composition of two rasters is usually performed by Z-buffering, which is a hardware technique for performing hidden surface elimination. In the conventional methods of the prior art Z-buffering allows merging of only two rasters at a time.<br>
Conventional hardware compositing techniques, as examplifed in Fig. 2A, are typically based on an iterative collating process of pairs of rasters (S. Molner "Combining Z-buffer Engines for Higher-Speed Rendering," Eurographics, 1988), or on pipelined techniques (J. Eyes at al. "PixelFlow: The Realization," ACM Siggraph, 1997). The merging of these techniques is carried out within log2R steps, of S stages, wherein R is the number of rendering GPUs. In the collating case, the time needed to accomplish comparison between two depth measures at each such comparator (MX) is log2Z, where Z is the depth domain<br><br>
of the scene. E.g. for typical depth buffers with 24 bits per pixel, the comparison between two Z-buffers is typically performed in 24 time clocks.<br>
Since in the prior art techniques the merging of only two Z-buffers is allowed at a time, composition of multiple rasters is made in a hierarchical fashion. The complexity of these composition structures is 0(\og2R), making the performance highly effected by R, the number of graphic pipelines. For growing values of R the compositing time exceeds the allocated time slot for real time animation. In practical applications, this condition serves to limit the number of GPUs that are used in a system. Fig. 2B shows the theoretical improvement of performance by increasing parallelism. The composition time grows by the factor of the complexity, 0(log2R). The aggregated time starts increasing at (e.g.) 16 pipelines. Obviously, In this case there is no advantage in increasing the level of parallelism beyond 16.<br>
Software techniques are usually based on compositing the output of R GPUs by utilizing P general purpose processors (E. Reinhard and C. Hansen "A Comparison of Parallel Compositing Techniques on Shared Memory Architectures," Eurographics Workshop on Parallel Graphics and Visualisation, Girona, 2000). However, these solutions typically requires utilizing (i) binary swap, (ii) parallel pipeline, and (iii) shared memory compositor, which significantly increase the complexity and cost of such implemetations.<br>
The most efficient implementation among the software techniques is the Shared Memory Compositor method (known also as "Direct Send' on distributed memory architectures). In this method the computation effort for rendering the sub-images is increased by utilizing additional GPUs (renderers), as shown in the block diagram of Fig. 3A and the pseudo code shown in Fig. 3B. In the system illustrated in Fig. 3A, 2 compositors (CPUs, po and p1) are operating concurrently on the same sub-images, which are generated by 3 renderers (GPUs, Bo, B1, and B2). The computation task distributed between the CPUs, each performing composition of one half of the same image. It is well-known that for any given number of GPUs one can speed up the compositing by increasing the number of parallel compositors.<br><br>
However, increased number of Tenderers slows down the performance severely. The complexity of this method is 0(N*R/P) where N is the number of pixels in a raster (image), R is the number of GPUs, and P is the number of compositing units (CPUs, Pt). The compositing process in this technique is completed within R-l iterations. In the implementation of this technique on SGI's Origin 2000 Supercomputer the compositing was carried out utilizing CPUs. The results of the compositing performed by this system are shown in Fig. 4. Fig, 4 demonstrates the overhead of this method, the compositing time required for this system is over 6 times the time required for the rendering.<br>
All the methods described above have not yet provided satisfactory solutions to the problems of the prior art methods for compositing large quantities of sub-images data into one image.<br>
US20010013048 discloses a minimum value search method among number sets where each is split into coded sub-values and ranked by a set parameter. Selected values are then encoded using a thermometric method. A parallel search is made for the minimum sub value where all values greater are deselected. The evaluation and de-selection process continues until the last sub-value has been processed leaving the value corresponding to the number of the lowest value. However, the proposed method still requires substantial computing resources, which slow down performance.<br>
US 6772187 discloses an apparatus and method for determining if a first number is greater than or equal to a second number by analyzing nibbles of two multi-bit numbers in parallel. A digital logic circuit is employed for such analysis. Central decision logic is proposed by US 6772187, that enables competition between only two numbers. This patent discusses about self examination of a bit against corresponding bit of all other numbers, but by means of a regular logic. This limits the amount of competing numbers to only two in US 6772187. The present invention recites a method and system that overcomes all the above shortcomings.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system for rendering in parallel a plurality of sub-image frames within a close to real time viewing.<br><br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a method and system for concurrently composing large amounts of sub-image data into a single image.<br>

It is a still another object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for concurrently composing large amounts of sub-image data into a single image that can be implemented efficiently as a semiconductor based device.<br>
It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for composing sub-image data based on presenting a competition between the multiple sources of the sub-image data.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent as the description proceeds.<br>

In a second step, starting from the second set of Segments Z1(N-2)',Z2(N-2),...,ZR(N-2), the binary grades of the Segments of the Depth values which corresponds to the group are compared by the logic circuitry, and Depth value indications are removed from the group by the logic circuitry if their binary grade is less than the highest binary grade which corresponds to another Depth values in the group.

Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br><br>
 \\\ to an integrated circuit, in which a method and system for re-composition of multiple three-dimensional/depth raster images into a two dimensional image in an associative fashion. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the rendered graphics data (sub-images), provided via multiple graphic pipelines, is resolved at each raster coordinate for the closest pixel to the viewer. This task is accomplished by performing an autonomous associative decision process at each pixel, simultaneously for all pixels at a given raster coordinate by utilizing multiple Associative Units (AU). The final image obtained by the composition outcome is outputted for viewing. The present invention overcomes the inadequate overhead of the prior art methods, which are generally based on hierarchical combination of images for viewing.<br>
In principle, the present invention presents a competition for the highest depth (Z) value among multiple sources. The highest depth value should be determined by utilizing multiple AUs. Each AU continuously examines the local depth value against the other values that are presented, and autonomously decides whether to quit the competition against other AUs or to further compete. In contrast to the conventional sorting methods, which are of sequential nature, according to the present invention a decentralized process can be performed in parallel, which substantially speeds up the composition performance. Additional advantages of the present invention are: (i) it can be performed on binary values of any length; and (ii) it suits any number of sources, without diminishing the performance.<br>
Fig. 5 provides a general illustration of the composing mechanism of the invention. The Composition System 51 present in the logic circuitry of the integrated circuit of the invention is fed with the sub-image data provided by the graphics pipelines (FBj,j-l, 2, 3,..., R). At the Composition System 51 the sub-Image's datum (Zj, Pj) is provided to a set of R corresponding AUs (AUj,j-l, 2, 3,..., R), each of which is capable of handling image pixels at the same X/Y coordinate of the screen. Each competing datum is composed of contents Pj (e.g. color, transparency, also referred to as RGB-value herein) and depth of a pixel Zj.<br>
The Z-values are received by the AUs and introduced on the Depth Competition Bus (DCB) 71. The logical state of the DCB lines is sensed by the AUs which accordingly produces Carry-in and Stop-Mark vectors which are used together with the Promotion<br><br>
Matrices (PM) 53 to determine whether they hold the highest Z-value. The decision concerning a competing datum is carried out locally at each AU, based on an associative mechanism, and on comparison with other AUs on the DCB. Finally, the AU holding the closest pixel (i.e., highest Z-value) is allowed to pass the pixel's color Pj (RGB-value) to the final raster 50, which constructs the final image 55.<br>
The Depth Composition Bus (DCB) 71 architecture intelligently deploys a wired-AND logic, as shown and demonstrated in Figs. 7A and 7B. The functionality of the wired-AND logic 70 is similar to the functionality of the regular logical AND function. However, the Wired-AND function introduces numerous outputs on a single electric point, wherein the regular logical AND gate must output its signal to another gate, which is isolated from any other output. As demonstrated in Fig. 7A, a logical "0" state on any one of the inputs forces a logical "0" state on the output line.<br>
The comparison process on the DCB is carried out in a bit-significance successive manner. As shown in Fig. 7B, each Z-value {Z1, Z2, Z3,..., ZR) provided via the graphic pipeline (FBj) is fed into the respective AU (AU,). The lines of the DCB are used for outputting the wired-AND results of each segment of the N-binary Z-values {Zj(i), i=0, 1, 2,..., N),<br>
according to their level of significance. In this way the DCB(0) 73 lines are used as outputs of the wired-AND logic carried out on the Least Significant Segment (LSS, also referred to as non-primary segment 101) of the Z-values (Zj(0)), and the DCB(N-1) 72 lines are used for<br>
outputting the wired-AND carried out on the Most Significant Segment (MSS, also referred to as the primary segment 100) of the Z-values {Zj(N-1)).<br>
The comparison process is carried out in an ordered fashion, starting from the most significant bits of the Z-values, and it is finalized at the least significant bits of the Z-values. The competition starts when the AUs output the Most Significant Bit (MSB) on the up most line of DCB(N-1) The duration of this process always takes a constant time of log1\Z\, where \Z\ is the depth domain of the scene, i.e. the bit length of the Z-values. Consequently, the multiple-stage structure of the prior art methods, is replaced by a single stage according to the method of the present invention. The performance complexity of<br><br>
O(log2Z * log2N) of the prior art methods is significantly reduced by the method of the present invention to O(Iog2Z).<br>
In the comparison of the of the MSS bits Zj(N-1), placing a single logical "0" state, or any<br>
number of them, on the DCB lines DCB(N-1), forces a "0" logical state on said lines. AUs which placed a "1" logical state on a DCB line, and sensed a resulting "0" logical state on said line, terminates their competition for their current Z-value, otherwise the AUs are permitted to continue their competition to the next successive bit (less in significance), as exemplified in Table 1.<br>
Table 1: comparison of the MSS bits Zj(N-1).<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It should be noted that the last case shown in Table 1 above is actually not feasible, since the forcing of a logical "0" state on a DCB line must force this line to a logical "0" state.<br>
The decision as to whether the Z-value ought to continue competing is established by each AU by sensing the logical state of the DCB lines. The last surviving AU "wins" the competition. When the comparison logic of the AUs identifies a higher Z-value on the bus, it detaches itself from the competition. Otherwise it keeps competing until the value remaining on the bus is the one with the highest Z-value.<br>
Fig. 8 is a block diagram illustrating the AU operation. The Kth Z-value ( ZK(N-1), ZK(N-2),..., ZK(0)) is wired to the DCB 71 via a set of gates (90, shown in Fig. 9), and the pixel value PK is gated through to the merged FB 50 via gate 84. The Associative Logic 80 enables the Wired-AND functioning, controls the unit's competition, and allows the RGB-value PK to pass through to FB 50 utilizing an enabling indication 81, upon accepting winning acknowledge 86 (WK) from one of the PM 53.<br><br>
The AU's logic for generating the Carry indications for the first segment Zj(N-1) = (Zj,0(N-1),Zj,1(N-1),...,Zj,n-1(N-1) of the Z-values is shown in Fig. 9. To exploit the Wired-AND functionality the inverse state of each bit is introduced to the DCB lines via the logical NAND gates 90. For each examined bit Zj,k(N-1) a logical OR gate 91 is used for<br>
determining if the Z-value continues to compete in the next bit level Zj,k+1(N-1) according to<br>
the logical state of the respective DCB line and the logical state of the examined bitZj,k(N-1).<br>
Each bit stage Zj,k(N-1) controls the next bit stage Zj,k(N-1) via the logical AND gates 92. The<br>
Carry-Out indication Cj(N-1) is generated only if all n bit stages survived the competition.<br>
The Carry-Out indication is provided to the PM(N-1) Promotion Matrix shown in Fig. 6, and in this way enables further competition of the Z-value Zj in the next segment.<br>
Simultaneously, while the AUs examine the first segments of the Z-values, each of the LSSs (Zj(i), i=0, 1, 2,..., N-2) is also examined by wired-AND logic. However, in the<br>
examination of the LSSs   Stop-Mark SMj(i) (i=0, 1, 2,..., N-2) signals are generated,<br>
instead of the Carry-Out C]/^"' indications which were generated for the first segment.<br>
Each Stop-Mark SMj(i) signal is forwarded to the respective PM(i) Promotion Matrix as<br>
part of Stop-Mark vector SM(i).<br>
A Stop-Mark SMj(i) indicates the "weak" bit of the respective segment Zj(i) that potentially drops-out the entire Z-value Zj from the competition. The logic for generating the SM signals for the LSSs (SMj(i), i=0, 1,2,..., N-2) is shown in Fig. 10. In principal, this logic is similar to the logic used for the generation of the Carry-Out vector C(N-1) . However, it differs in that each bit stage can generate a Stop-Mark signal, "stop 1" - "stop (n+l)", via inverters 99. For each LSSs segment (Zj(i)=0, 1, 2,..., N-2) only one Stop-Mark signal<br>
SMj(i)is generated. The highest possible Stop-Mark signal "stop (n+1)" indicates that the examined segment did not fail in any of its wiring comparisons.<br><br>
The logic of the Associative Matrices handles the Stop-Mark vector  SMj(i) and the<br>
previously generated Carry-Out vectors C(i+1), and generating a new Carry-Out vector C(i).<br>
In this new Carry-Out vector C(i) only those AUs which survived the competition so far<br>
are participating. If just a single AU survived, it becomes the final winner, discontinuing the competition process. Otherwise the next PM (PM(,_1)) performs the same task, until a single winner is left.<br>
Fig. 11 is a block diagram illustrating the logic of a PM (reduced case). For the sake of simplicity Fig. 11 illustrates an ith PM (i.e., PM(,)) serving two AUs (R=2), wherein the /th segment is 4 bits long (i.e., 5 Stop-Marks, 5MJ') = (S'A/{],SA/J)2,...,5'A{'i)J)). Each of the<br>
Stop-Mark vectorsSM 1(i) and SM2(i) sets on one of the FFs 110 and 111. No more than one FF 110 and 111 can be in "ON" state in a row. The Stop-Mark vector for which a winning indication Cj(i+1) is received from the previous PM (PM(,+1)) will generate a Carry-Out if,<br>
and only if there is no other Stop-Mark (in another row) with a higher binary value and having a Carry-Out indicating winning in the previous PM (PM(,+1)).<br>
The operation of previous columns in the PM is disabled via the Disable Function 113 upon receipt of a corresponding indication from the logical AND gates 117 gathered via the logical OR gate 119 of the column in which a Stop-Mark indication having the highest level is received, and for which a corresponding Carry-Out indication is received from the previous PM. If the Stop-Marks received by the PM are of the same significance (e.g., SM1,4(i) and SM2,4(i)), Carry-Out indications C1(i) and C2((i) are provided to the next PM (PM(0) via buffers 112.<br>
Only one winning W(i) signal can be produced by one of the PMs. Whenever Detector 115 indicates that a single winner was determined in the current stage, the Disable Function 113 produces a Stop(i) indication which will disable further processing by the PM of the next stage PM(i_1). Whenever a Stop signal is received by the Disable Function (e.g., Stop(i+1)) it disables the functioning of the current and the following PMs by disabling the gates 117 and by issuing a Stop indication (e.g., Stop(i)) to the Disable Function of the following PM.<br><br>
For example, assuming that AU1 sets on Stop-Mark 4, SM1,4(i'), AU2 sets on stop-mark 2, SM2,2(i), and that both Carry indications, c,(,+1) and c(/+1) , received from the previous PM<br>
indicates winning in the previous stage of the competition. In such case the Z-value competing in AUi wins, disables columns 1-3 via the Disable Function 113, and generates the only Carry-Out C1(i). Detection of a single Carry-Out, indicating a single winner at the<br>
current stage, results is generating a win acknowledge signal W(i) via the Single Carry-Out<br>
detector 115 which is provided on the W1 line to AU1. The winning AU is then enabled to provide its RGB value PK to FB 50.<br>
If for instance AU1 and AU2 both turn on Stop-Mark 4, SMj,4(i), and Carry indications C1(i+1)and C2(i+1) indicates that both Z-values won in the previous stage, then the two Carry-Outs c0) and c(,) transferred to the next PM (PM(,+1)) will indicate also wining in the current stage.<br>
Fig. 12 exemplifies the competition process of R=5 Z-values (Zi, Z2, Z^, Z4, and Z$) belonging to AUs a through e. In this example the depth measure of the Z-values is of 32 bits, and the depth values are segmented into N=A segments (ZJ3), Z7(2), Zf, and Z
bits each. The total processing time in this example is 11 time units, while sequential wired-AND process (without Promotion Matrices) would take 32 time units.<br>
In the first segment in this example, the MSSs, Z2(3)', Z3(3), and Z5(3) are all equal and greater than Z1(3)  and Z4(3), and therefore only the corresponding Cf}, C3(3), and c5(3))<br>
Carry-Out signals are produced to indicated the Z-values Z2, Z3, and Z5, won the first stage. At the same time, the SM vectors of the LSSs are produced by the AUs.<br>
As for the second segment of the Z-values, the 6 MSBs of the Zf} binary values are all equal. A "Stop 7" SM is indicated for Z,(2), and it does not further compete since the state of its 7th bit is "0" (Z,(2) =0) while the state of the 7th bit of all other Z-values in the segment is "1" (Z2,7(2) = Z3,7(2) = Z4,7(2) = Z5,7(2) = 1). A "Stop 8" SM is indicated for Z3(2) and it is<br><br>
also terminating further competition since the state of its 8th bit is "0" (Z3,8(2) = 0 ), while the state of the 8th bit of the values that their competition proceeds in this bit stage is "1" {Zf} = Z{2} = Z5(2) =1). Consequently, "Stop 9" SM is indications are produced for Z2(2), Z(2), and Z;2), since they won in each and every bit stage in the segment. Accordingly, the processing of the SM(2) and C(3) vectors in PM(2) will produce Carry-Out indications C2(2) and C5(2) to the next PM, PM(1).<br>
As for the third segment of the Z-values, a "Stop 2" SM is indicated for Z5(1), which stops any further competing since Z$=0 and Zf}=0 while Z^ = Z$ = Z$ = Z = 1, and "Stop 9" SM is indicated for Z,(1), Z
in equality. Accordingly, the processing of the Shfi' and C^2' vectors in PM(1) will produce a single Carry-Out indication C^° to the last PM, PM(0). Since PM(1) determined a single winner, its detector 115 generates a corresponding indication W2 to the winning AU, AU2, which enables its RGB value P2 into FB 50. Consequently, the Disable Function of PM(1) generates a Stop(0) indication which disables further processing in the last PM, PM(0).<br>
The processing of the third segment is not carried out. Nevertheless, SM(0) indications are produced by the AUs. A "Stop 1" SM is indicated for  Z5(0) since Z5,1(0)=0  while<br>
Z1,1(0)=Z2,1(0)=Z3.1(0)=Z4.1(0)=1. A"Stop 7" SM is indicated for Z3(0) and Z(0), since Z1,r(0) =Z1,r(0) =Z3,r(0)=Z4,r(0)=1 for r=2,3,4,5, and 6, Z3,7(0)=Z4,7(0)and Z1.7(0)=Z2.7(0)?=1<br>
Consequently, "Stop 8" SM is indicated for Z2(0) and "Stop 9" SM is indicated for Z1(0) since Z2,8(0)=0 and Z1,8(0)=1.<br>
The competition time can be further reduced by merging the SM results of segments, while all segments are kept uniform in length. Such reduction allows clustering of results prior to the arrival of the Carry-Out indications from the previous PM. This approach further reduces the complexity from O (log2Z), to O ((log2Z/k), while k is a folding factor. For example, assuming Z=232, a sequential wired-AND process would take complexity of O<br><br>
(32). However, using 4 PMs of 8 bits each, the second half of the binary value is being "folded" at the time of processing the first half. As a result, the complexity is reduced to 0(8+1+1). In this case the folding factor k is 32/10 — 3.2. In case of longer binary values of e.g. 64 bits, the order of complexity is not significantly changed: 0(8+1+1+1). The advantage of this parallel approach is in that any bit length of Z-value binary values can be processed at almost the same short time, while keeping high efficiency.<br>
Fig. 13 is a block diagram illustrating a chip implementation of an integrated circuit 140 of a preferred embodiment of the invention (e.g., VLSI). This example illustrates an implementation for compositing 6 FBs from 6 different GPUs. This implementation realizes a compositing unit for simultaneously composing a plurality sub-images pixels by a plurality of Sub-Image Units (SIU). Each SIU comprises a set of AUs corresponding to the binary value of GPUs, a DCB, a PM, and Control Logic 141. The Control Logic 141 at each SIU sorts-out, from the data input stream retrieved via the Port-Port6 input ports, only those pixels that match with the coordinates of the respective sub-image. Each SIU outputs the RGB data of one of the sub-images, which is outputted to FB 50 via output port 142.<br>
The entire compositing process is further parallelized by dividing each FB into 16 sub-images. For example, for an image having resolution of 1024x1024 pixels, each Sub-Image Unit (SIU) processes a 64x64 sub-image (1/16 of the image). If for example the pixels' color data is 24 bits long, the output of the stack of SIUs includes 12KBytes of winning pixels color data.<br>
Opposed to prior art, the present invention allows carrying out a single merging step for any number of GPUs R, as described in Fig. 5. The hierarchical structure of the prior art method has been replaced in the present invention by a unique, flat, and single step structure. The performance of this new structure is insensitive to the level of parallelism, i.e., the number of participating GPUs. Composition time is practically reduced to a single comparison and any arbitrary number of GPUs is allowed, with no sacrifice to the overall performance.<br>
The above examples and description have of course been provided only for the purpose of illustration, and are not intended to limit the invention in any way. As will be appreciated<br><br>
