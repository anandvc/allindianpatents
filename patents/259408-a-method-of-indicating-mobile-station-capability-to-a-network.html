The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br>
Downlink dual carrier transmission is being developed in the 3rd   generation partnership project (3GPP) as part of global system for mobile conununications (GSM) enhanced data rates for GSM evolution (EDGE) Radio Access Network (GERAN) specifications in Release 7. With the additional capabilities of the dual carrier mobiles, the support of the new multi-slot capabilities has to be indicated by the mobile station (MS) in the Classmark 3 and MS radio access capability (RAC) as set out in 3GPP TS 24.008. As there are already quite a large number of bits in the Classmark 3 and MS RAC, increasing the size further by a large number of bits is undesirable. A large number of bits in those messages would delay the network attach procedure for the MS. However, some flexibility is needed in the MS implementation to allow early introduction of the feature in the in arket and this needs a number of MS classes to be allowed with varying in ulti-slot capabilities. Hence any new indication needs to be done in the most efficient possible way..<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a method of indicating multi-slot capabilities of a multi-carrier mobile station to a network comprises sending an indication from the mobile station to the network of the capability of the mobile station to receive or transmit on (wo or more carriers simultaneously; wherein the network determines an ideal multi-carrier multi-slot capability of the mobile station from an existing capability indication for single carrier transmission mode of the mobile station; and wherein the mobile station sends in an additional field an indication in respect of a reduction in number of time slots from the ideal multi-carrier multi-slot capability determined by the network.<br>
The present invention shows a way to use as few bits as possible to indicate the muiti-(dual) carrier capabilities of the MS to the network. The invention also allows greater flexibility for implementation of the dual carrier MS since a large number of downlink multi-slot capabilities can be signalled by an MS belonging to a given single carrier multi-slot c\ass. This cases the implementation options for the MS manufacturers.<br>
Preferably, the mobile station is GSM EDGE capable.<br><br><br>
Preferably, the indication of the multi-carrier capabilities and the indication of reduction in time slots from ideal multi carrier multi slot capability is done using the mobile station radio access capability or Classmark 3 information elements.<br>
In one embodiment, the mobile station sends the indication in respect of a reduction in the number of time slots from the ideal multi-carrier multi-slot capability determined by the network in separate additional fields for each of general packet radio service (GPRS) and enhanced GPRS modes, which need different modulations.<br>
An example of a method of indicating multi-slot capabilities of a multi-carrier mobile station to a network will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a system in which the method of the present invention is applied:<br>
Figure 2 is a block diagram of a mobile station in the system of Fig. 1; Figure 3 illustrates a first example of times lot allocation using the method of the present invention; and,<br>
Figure 4 is a second example of timeslot allocation using the method of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a system in winch the method of the present invention can be applied. A mobile station X communicates 9 with &amp; network 10. A downlink dual carrier MS is expected to be capable of receiving on two downlink carriers simultaneously. In GSM a carrier is the smallest chutik of radio frequency bandwidth which the MS, or the network, is allowed to use to communicate. It is also assumed that the MS is capable of monitoring neighbour cell signal strength in parallel to reception of data whenever possible. The radio frequency (RF) architecture assumed for the receiver in such an MS is as shown in Fig.2. This illustration from 3GPP TR 45.912 shows RF architecture for downlink dual carrier MS as a simple extension of that of the single carrier MS. In the MS of Fig.2 individual RF inputs 1, 2 arc combined with the signals generated by the respective local oscillators LOI, L02 in multipliers 3,4 and converted to digital signals in respective analogue to digital converters 5, 6. The digital signals are input to a digital signal processor 7 for further base-band processing.<br>
The base-band module of the MS is a single unit common for both RF receive chains. This gives rise to the possibility that the base-band processing power at the MS<br><br><br>
side could now become a bottleneck for the total number of receivable timeslots. Neighbour cell monitoring on the other hand takes relatively little base-band processing power. It is assumed that either of the local oscillators LOl, L02 is capable of switching to transmit mode when necessary.<br>
Although dual carrier mobiles are predominantly expected to be of Type 1 (i.e. they cannot transmit and receive simultaneously, as defined in 3GPP TS 45.002), the present invention also applies to Type 2 mobiles, which arc capable of simultaneous transmission and reception.<br>
One option to encode the multi-slot capabilities of a MS that supports downlink dual carrier is to simply double its downlink multi-slot capabilities. The advantage of this solution is that it needs just a single bit in the Classmark 3 / MS RAC, indicating downlink dual carrier capability of file MS, which make this solution very attractive.<br>
A dual carrier mobile still needs to indicate its multi-slot class capability when operating as a single carrier mobile, as it could be in a network that does not support dual carrier, for example in a network of Release 6 or earlier. In 3GPP technical specification (TS) 45.002, the multi-slot class is defined in the following way: Muluslas class: RX + TX=Sum where:<br>
RX= maximum number of receive timeslots (TS) that the MS can use per time division multiple access (TDMA) frame;<br>
TX= maximum number of transmit timeslots that the MS can use per TDMA frame; Sum = total number of uplink and downlink TS that can actually be used by the MS per TDMA frame.<br>
For dual carrier, there is currently no intention to define new multi-slot classes, but to derive the multi-slot capabilities from the single carrier multi-slot. For this purpose the ideal number of timeslots that an MS is able to receive data on in the dual carrier mode is fixed for each single carrier multi-slot class that is indicated by the MS. This value is double the total number of timcslots in single carrier mode for most of the multi-slot classes. However, more than double the number of timeslots may also be possible in case of some multi-slot classes and this value is fixed in the standard. Hence, the ideal dual carrier multi-slot capability of a dual carrier mobile could be derived by the network just by knowing its equivalent capability indicated for a single carrier network. The RF (turn around parameters) of the dual carrier MS are also<br><br><br>
derived from the multi-slot class indicated by the MS to the network. The MS then needs only to indicate whether it is capable of dual-carrier reception or not. This then needs a single bit in the Classmark 3/MSRAC of the MS. The problem with the simple extension described is that the implementation options for the dual carrier MS are very limited. Although the RF capabilities double, the base-band capabilities need not be double and thus the MS might not be able to support double, or more than double in some cases, the number of timeslots in single carrier mode. When a dual carrier MS is developed, if the above method of capability indication is adopted, the MS manufacturers are forced to double the base-band capabilities as well as RF capabilities at the same time and this is expected to delay the introduction of the feature in the market. Hence, a flexibility in number of downlink timeslots that could be supported by a dual carrier MS is highly desirable.<br>
For each multi-slot class, allowing such flexibility and encoding all possible combinations depending on the base-band capabilities of the MS leads to a very large number of different multi-slot classes and this makes it extremely difficult for coding the capability as a large number of bits in the Classmark are needed to indicate the correct capability of the MS explicitly.<br>
lo overcome the issues highlighted, a futher feature of thu present invention is<br>
done dimply by indicating the number of timestores that the maximum downblank carrier capability should be reduced by.<br>
Fig.3 shows an example of a class 12 mobile station capable of downlink dual carrier. Downlink carrier fl was assigned four receive timeslots 11 out of eight possible receive time slots and downlink f2 also was assigned four receive timeslots 13. In addition, downlink i2 uses one slot 12 for neighbour cell monitoring. In uplink carrier fl', one slot in eight is used as a transmit timeslot 14 and is chosen so as not to coincide with the downlink timeslots used 11, 12, 13 - Type 1 operation.<br>
The MS shown in Fig. 4 is also a class 12 MS capable of dual carrier as is the one shown in Fig.3 with a reduction of one timeslot because of base-band processing power restrictions. Thus, the downlink carrier ft was assigned one timeslot less than the downlink carrier f2. The reduction couid be done on any downlink carrier as long as the base-band processing requirements are same for the timeslots on either carriers.<br><br><br>
Since there are only 8 timesiots in a TDMA frame for GSM system, the maximum reduction in the number of timesiots due to restrictions in baseband capabilities ranges from 0 - meaning no restrictions from base-band perspective - to 7. This can be done using a 3-bit field to indicate the reduction in the number of possible receive timesiots due to limited base-band resources. As an optional enhancement, the indication can be done independently for GPRS and EGPRS. However, a 3 bit field is not necessary in all cases since all possible reductions may not necessarily be defined. Hence a reduction of the number of bits needed to signal the base-band capability is possible. For this purpose, the reduction field's meaning can be tied to the indicated muli-slot class. Greater reduction is needed when a greater number of time-slots are supported by the MS. Thus, by combining the meaning of the reduction field to the indicated multi-slot class of the MS, it is possible to cover a large number of meaningful multi-slot reductions with only 2 bits. Thus, the invention provides enough flexibility and still keeps the multi-slotclass reduction field small enough, so that the number of bits in the Classmark 3/MSRAC is not increased too much.<br>
This reduction is intended per assignment. For example, in the case of Fig. 4, illustrating a case not covered by simple extension of multi-slot classes, the network usings three timesiots is as  reuuve timesiots on cirrev fl, four timesiots 16 as receive ' allots on carrier meslot 1  for htighbuu:-  .vopitoring; one slot on<br>
apabihties of the mobile<br>
As a further example, for the case where the MS is of class 12 and the required reduction is of 3 timesiots., then, the network either assigns 4 downlink timesiots on fl and 1 on G, or 3 downlink timesiots on fl and 2 on f2, or 2 downlink timesiots on fl and 3 on f2 or 1 downlink timesiots on fl and 4 on f2. The reduction in the number of time slots from the ideal multi-carrier multi-slot capability in the downlink may be because of limited base band processing power of the mobile station, or heat dissipation problems.<br>
There are a number of advantages of the present invention. These include the fact that very few bits are needed in the Classmark 3 .' MS RAC, i.e. only 3 or 4 additional bits are needed. Also, the invention reuses all the optimizations already done in coding the existing multi-slot classes because of the simple extension of existing multi-slot class indication. Furthermore, the invention is flexible enough to<br><br><br>
apply to future systems in the sense that if an uplink enhancement like dual carrier on uplink is standardized in future, the same technique can be used to code all the uplink multi-slot classes by adding one bit to signal support for dual carrier in the uplink and a 3 bit field to indicate the reduction in number of timeslots in uplink from maximum dual carrier uplink capability.<br><br><br>
