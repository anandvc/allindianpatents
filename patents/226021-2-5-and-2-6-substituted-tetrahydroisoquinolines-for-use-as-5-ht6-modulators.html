2,5- AND 2,6-SUBSTITUTKD TETRAHYDROISOQUINOLINES FOR USE AS 5-HT6 MODULATORS<br>
This invention relates to substituted tetrahydroisoquinoline and isoquinoline compounds, and associated compositions, methods for use as therapeutic agents, and methods of preparation thereof.<br>
The actions of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) as a major modulatory neurotransmitter in the brain, are mediated through a number of receptor families termed 5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5- HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7. Based on a high level of 5-HT6 receptor mRNA in the brain, it has been stated that the 5-HT6 receptor may play a role in the pathology and treatment of central nerve system disorders. In particular, 5-HT6 selective ligands have been identified as potentially useful in the treatment of certain CNS disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, anxiety, depression, manic depression, psychoses, epilepsy, obsessive compulsive disorders, migraine, Alzheimer's disease (enhancement of cognitive memory), sleep disorders, feeding disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, panic attacks, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), attention deficit disorder (ADD), withdrawal from drug abuse such as cocaine, ethanol, nicotine and benzodiazepines, schizophrenia, and also disorders associated with spinal trauma and/or head injury such as hydrocephalus. Such compounds are also expected to be of use in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as functional bowel disorder. See for example, B.L. Roth et al., /. Pharmacol Exp. Titer., 1994,268, pages 1403-14120, D. R. Sibley et al., Mol Pharmacol, 1993, 43, 320-327, A.J. Sleight et al., Neurotransmission, 1995, J J, 1-5, and A. J. Sleight et al., Serotonin ID Research Alert, 1997,2(3), 115-8.<br>

Compounds of the present invention can be made by a variety of methods depicted in the illustrative synthetic reaction schemes shown and described below.<br>
The starting materials and reagents used in preparing these compounds generally are either available from commercial suppliers, such as Aldrich Chemical Co., or are prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art following procedures set forth in references such as Fieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis^ Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1991, Volumes 1-15; Rodd's Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Elsevier Science Publishers, 1989, Volumes 1-5 and Supplemental; and Organic Reactions, WHey &amp; Sons: New York, 1991, Volumes 1-40. The following synthetic reaction schemes are merely illustrative of some methods by which the compounds of the present invention can be synthesized, and various modifications to these synthetic reaction schemes can be made and will be suggested to one skilled in the art having referred to the disclosure contained in this Application.<br>
The starting materials and the intermediates of the synthetic reaction schemes can be isolated and purified if desired using conventional techniques, including but not limited to, filtration, distillation, crystallization, chromatography, and the like. Such materials can be characterized using conventional means, including physical constants and spectral data.<br>
Unless specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein preferably are conducted under an inert atmosphere at atmospheric pressure at a reaction temperature<br>
range of from about -78 °C to about 150 °C, more preferably from about 0 °C to about<br>
125 °C, and most preferably and conveniently at about room (or ambient) temperature,<br>
e.g., about 20 °C.<br>
Scheme A below illustrates one synthetic procedure usable to prepare specific compounds of formula I, wherein G is halo or other leaving group, and n, r, R , R , R , R4, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10 and Ra are as defined herein.<br><br><br>
In Step 1 of Scheme A, a nitroisoquinoline a is reduced to an aminoisoquinoline b. This selective nitro reduction maybe carried out under relatively mild conditions using H2 in the presence of a Pd or Pt catalyst. Various nitro- substituted isoquinolines usable in this step are commercially available or can be prepared via well known techniques.<br>
In Step 2 a deamination reaction is carried out in the presence of acid HX and copper powder under aqueous, oxidizing conditions to provide a substituted isoquinoline c wherein X is halo, preferably bromo or chloro. Various amino-substituted isoquinolines are commercially available or can be prepared via well known techniques for use in this step.<br>
In Step 3, a cross-coupling reaction is utilized in which the substituted isoquinoline c is treated with a heterocyclic amine d in the presence of a palladium catalyst to yield a heterocyclyl- substituted isoquinoline e. This cross-coupling reaction maybe achieved with heating under nonpolar solvent conditions. Where R10 is hydrogen, BOC protection or other removable protection strategies maybe used to protect the exposed nitrogen of heteroq^clic amine d. This cross-coupling amination reaction is described in An Improved Catalyst System For Aromatic Carbon-Nitrogen Bond Formation: The Possible Involvement OfBis(Phosphine) Palladium Complexes As Key Intermediates. Wolfe et al., J. Am. Chem, Soc. (1996), 118(30), 7215-7216.<br><br>
The heterocyclyl- substituted isoquinoline e of Step 3 is optionally reduced in Step 4 to provide a heterocyclyl-substituted tetraliydroisoquinoline f. The reduction of Step 4 maybe achieved using excess borane under polar aprotic solvent conditions.<br>
In Step 5, the heterocyclyl-substituted tetrahydroisoquinoline f of Step 4 is treated with a sulfonyl halide R S02G to provide a sulfonylated, heterocyclyl-substituted tetrahydroisoquinoline VI, wherein R2 is aryl, heteroaryl or cycloalkyl as described above. Numerous aryl, heteroaryl and cycloalkyl sulfonyl chlorides and bromides are commercially available or are readily prepared, and may be used with the well-known Schotten-Baumann procedure (Et20/aqueous K2CO3) in Step 5 to form the sulfonylated heterocyclyl-substituted tetrahydroisoquinoline Ik.<br>
The tetrahydroisoquinoline Ik of Scheme A is of the formula I discussed above and represents a more specific case wherein Z is N, X is -CRaR - with R shown as hydrogen, and with Y being -SO2-. In many embodiments the heterocyclic amine d utilized in Scheme A may be a piperazine of the formula:<br><br>
In such embodiments, compounds of formula Ie would more specifically be of the formula:<br><br>
described above (with R being shown as hydrogen in formula Ii.<br><br>
Many variations on the procedure of Scheme A are possible and will suggest themselves to those skilled in the art upon review of this disclosure. For example, the heterocyclyl- substituted isoquinoline e may be prepared directly by reaction of nitrogen mustard (bis- (2-chloroethyl) -amine) with the amine b, with Steps 2 and 3 of Scheme A being omitted. The reaction of nitrogen mustard with amines to form heterocycles in this manner is well known in the art. The carbon at position 1 of the tetrahydroisoquinoline Ie is benzylic in nature and subject to relatively facile alkylation, and thus in another variation of Scheme A, an alkyl group R may be introduced at position 1 using conventional synthetic techniques. Similarly, position 4 of the tetrahydroisoquinoline Ie may be subject to alkylation if desired. Additionally, the location and chemical nature of the R1 groups may in some embodiments be selected to facilitate the cross coupling reaction of Step 3.<br>
Specific compounds of formula I may also be prepared via the procedure shown in Scheme B, wherein G is halo or other leaving group and n, q, R1, R2, R3, R4, R6, R7, E8, R9&gt; R10 and Ra are as defined herein.<br><br>
In Step 1 of Scheme B, the halo-substituted isoquinoline g is treated with an alkylHthium reagent or other strong base under anhydrous polar aprotic conditions and dry ice/acetone temperature to generate a lithiated isoquinoline h. The lithiated isoquinoline h is not isolated but is used directly in Step 2.<br><br>
An alkylation is effected in Step 2 by introducing a Heterocyclic ketone i to the lithiated isoquinoline h to provide a heterocyclyl-substituted isoquinoline ]. The heterocyclic ketone i may comprise, for example, pyrrolidone (q = 1) or piperidone (q = 2), both of which are commercially available. Many substituted pyrrolidinones and piperidinones are also commercially available or are readily prepared via known synthetic routes, and maybe used in this step. Where R10 is hydrogen, BOC protection or other removable protection strategies maybe used to protect the exposed nitrogen of heterocyclic ketone i and corresponding nitrogen on the heterocyclyl-substituted isoquinoline j.<br>
In Step 3, the heterocyclyl-substituted isoquinoline j, prepared in Step 2 is dehydrated by treatment with mild acid to yield a heterocyclyl-substituted isoquinoline k wherein the heterocyclyl moiety is partially unsaturated.<br>
In Step 4, the heterocyclyl-substituted isoquinoline k.of Step 3 is reduced to provide a heterocyclyl-substituted tetrahydroisoquinoline 1. This reduction may be achieved via hydrogenation using a platinum or palladium catalyst under mild ethanolic conditions.<br>
In Step 5, the heterocyclyl-substituted tetrahydroisoquinoline 1 of Step 4 is sulfonylated, using the sulfonyl halide R"S02G in the manner described above for Scheme A, to provide a heterocyclyl-substituted, sulfonylated tetrahydroisoquinoline Im in accordance with the invention. Sulfonyl halide g may comprise, for example, an arylsulfonyl halide, a heteroarylsulfonylhalide, or a cycloalkylsulfonyl halide. The compound of formula VII represents a compound of formula I, discussed above, in the specific case wherein Z is -CH-, X is -CRaRb- with Rb shown as hydrogen, and Y is -<br>
SOr-.<br>
As in the case of Scheme A discussed above, variations on the synthetic procedures of Scheme B are possible and will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. In one such variation, for example, reduction of the isoquinoline ring maybe carried out selectively, leaving the unsaturation present in the heterocyclyl moiety. In another variation, the unsaturation in the heterocyclyl moiety may be selectively reduced without reduction of the isoquinoline ring system. In certain embodiments, the dehydration event of Step 3 may occur spontaneously, in situ following the alkylation of Step 2, and in such embodiments Step 3 maybe omitted.<br><br>
In other embodiments of the invention, specific compounds of formula I may be prepared according to the procedure shown in Scheme C, wherein, G is a leaving group, preferably halo, and maybe the same or different in each occurrence, R is any lower alkyl, preferably methyl, and maybe the same or different in each occurrence, and n, R1, R2, R3, R4, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, Rc and Rd are as defined herein.<br><br>
In Step 1 of Scheme C, allcylation of a 2-alkyl-nitrobenzoic acid ester m is carried out by reaction of the benzylic carbon of compound m with a "masked aldehyde" provided by an amide acetal n, with heating under mild basic conditions (Matsui et al, /. Med. Chem. 35,18 (1992) 3307-3319), to provide an aldol condensation product o.<br>
A cyclization of the aldol condensation product o is effected in Step 2 to provide a nitrobenzopyranone or nitroisochromone |&gt;. Cyclization maybe achieved using silica as a catalyst by passing or eluting aldol condensation product o through silica using a hexane/ethyl acetate solvent system as described by Matsui et al., Supra.<br>
In Step 3 amide formation occurs, and maybe achieved by heating the nitrobenzopyranone p. of Step 2 in the presence of amine £ to provide a nitroisoquinolinone r. In many embodiments R may be aryl or heteroaryl as noted<br><br>
above, such that amine <j is bemylic in nature. amine a may also be cyclohexylamine or other cycloalkylamine.></j>
The nitro group of nitroisoquinolinone r is reduced in Step 4 to create a corresponding aminoisoquinolinone s. This reduction may be effected by hydrogenation using a platinum or palladium catalyst under mild conditions.<br>
In Step 5 a ring formation occurs in which the aminoisoquinolinone s of Step 4 is reacted with a bis-haloalkylamine t to provide piperazinyl-substituted isoquinoline u. Bis-haLoalkylamine t may comprise, for example, nitrogen mustard (G is CI and R6, R7, R\ W and R1U are hydrogen), and may be introduced to aminoisoquinolinone rasa hydrochloride salt. Where R10 is hydrogen, BOC protection or other removable protection strategies maybe used to protect the exposed nitrogen in subsequent steps.<br>
The piperazinyl-substituted isoquinoline u of Step 5 is reduced in step 6 to provide a piperazinyl-substituted dihydroisoquinolinone In. This reduction may be achieved using excess borane under polar aprotic solvent conditions. In certain embodiments this reduction maybe omitted such that the 3- position of the isoquinoline ring system remains unsaturated.<br>
The piperazinyl-substituted dihydroisoquinolinone In represents a specific compound of formula I wherein X is -C(O)-, Y is -(CRcRd)-, and Z is N. Many variations of the procedure illustrated in Scheme C may be used to provided other compounds of formula I in accordance with the invention. For example, a deamination of aminoisoquinolinone r in the manner described in Step 2 of Scheme A to yield a bromo-substituted isoquinoline (not shown), followed by the cross-coupling reaction of Step 3 of Scheme A and then reduction, provides an alternate route to the piperazinyl-substituted dihydroisoquinolinone VIIL Alternatively, such a bromo-substituted isoquinoline could be lithiated and then reacted with a heterocyclyl ketone as described in Steps 2 and 3 of Scheme B, to provide various heterocyclyl-substituted dihydroisoquinolinones in accordance with the invention. Other variations of Scheme C are also possible and are considered to be within the scope of this disclosure.<br>

Radioligand binding studies<br>
This example illustrates in vitro radioligand binding studies of compound of formula I.<br>
The binding activity of compounds of this invention in vitro was determined as follows. Duplicate determinations of ligand affinity are made by competing for binding of [3H]LSD in cell membranes derived from HEK293 cells stably expressing recombinant human 5-HT6 receptor. This cell line was prepared as described by Monsma et al., Molecular Pharmacology, Vol. 43 pp. 320-327 (1993).<br>
All determinations were made in assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgS04, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM ascorbic acid, pH 7.4 at 37 °C, in a 250 microliter reactior volume. Assay tubes containing [3H] LSD (5nM)3 competing ligand, and membrane were incubated in a shaking water bath for 60 min. at 37 °C, filtered onto Packard GF-B plates (pre-soaked with 0.3% PEI) using a Packard 96 well cell harvester and washed 3 times in ice cold 50 mM Tris-HCl. Bound [3H] LSD was determined as radioactive counts per minute using Packard TopCount.<br><br><br><br>
Example 5 Cognition Enhancement<br>
The cognition-enhancing properties of compounds of the invention may be in a model of animal cognition: the object recognition task model.   4-month-old male Wistar rats (Charles River, The Netherlands) were used. Compounds were prepared daily and dissolved in physiological saline and tested at three doses. Administration was always given i.p. (injection volume 1 ml/leg) 60 minutes before Tl. Scopolamine hydrobromide was injected 30 minutes after compound injection. Two equal testing groups were made of 24 rats and were tested by two experimenters. The testing order of doses was determined randomly. The experiments were performed using a double blind protocol. All rats were treated once with each dose condition. The object recognition test was performed as described by Ennaceur, A., Delacour, J., 1988, A new one-trial test for neurobiological studies of memory in rats. 1: Behavioral data. Behav. Brain Res. 31, 47-59.<br>
