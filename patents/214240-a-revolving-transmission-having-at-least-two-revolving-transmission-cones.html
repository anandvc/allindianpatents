TRANSMISSION<br>
	The present invention relates to a transmission<br>
	particularly having two revolving transmission elements,<br>
5	each of which has at least one runnining surface for a<br>
	revolving coupling element, which couples the two devolving<br>
	transmission elements.. At least one of the running surfaces<br>
	of the two revolving transmission elements preferably has<br>
	at least two running paths for the coupling element having<br>
10	different running radii in this case, so that in this way a<br>
	continuously and/or nearly continuously variable-<br>
	transmission may be implemented. In an arrangement of this&gt;<br>
	type, the two transmission elements may be braced, while<br>
	including the coupling element, via a bracing device which<br>
15	presses the two transmission elements against the coupling<br>
	element with a variable pressure. In this way, variable and<br>
	therefore adjustable pressures, which act between the<br>
	revolving transmission elements and the coupling element,<br>
	may be implemented.<br>
20<br>
	Arrangements of this type are known, for example, from EP 0<br>
	87B 641 A1 and from EP 0 980 993 A2. Both of these two<br>
	publications relate to conical friction ring transmissions,<br>
	in which two .cones having- opposing conical angles are<br>
25	mounted so that they revolve in such a way that a constant<br>
	gap remains between thorn, in which a ring revolves<br>
	enclosing one of the cones as a coupling element. The two<br>
	publications disclose both hydrostatic and/or hydrodynamic<br>
	pressure devices and mechanical pressure devices, using<br>
30	which at least one cone may be displaced in such a way that<br>
	the gap width is reduced-. In this way, the coupling element<br>
	may be pressed against both running surfaces of the cone,<br>
	so that in this way the pressure may implement sufficient<br>
	force transmission. While for the hydrostatic and/or<br>
35	hydro-dynamic achievements of the object, a variation may be<br>
	implemented without anything further by varying the<br>
	hydraulic ratios, and/or the hydrostatic or hydrodynamic<br><br><br>
- 2 -<br>
	ratios, the mechanical achievements of the object provide<br>
	approach ramps, which are engaged with one another, of two-<br>
	assemblies which transmit torque, so that these two-<br>
	assemblies may twist toward one another as a function of<br>
5	the torque, through which the corresponding pressure device<br>
	expands axially and/or has its axial dimension reduced as a<br>
	function of torque. In this way, at higher torques a higher<br>
	pressure may also be implemented without anything further,<br>
	these forces being countered through suitable bracing<br>
10	bearings, such as taper roller bearings, so that finally a<br>
	larger bracing force results for the coupling element<br>
	and/or the friction ring.<br>
	It is the object of the present invention to provide a<br>
15	transmission having two revolving transmission elements,<br>
	each of which has at least one running surface for a<br>
	revolving coupling element, at Least one running surface<br>
	having at least two running surfaces for the coupling<br>
	element having different running radii and the two<br>
20	transmission elements being braced, while incorporating the<br>
	coupling element, via a bracing device which presses the<br>
	two transmission elements against the coupling element with<br>
	a variable pressure/ in which the pressure may be applied<br>
	more reliably and/or more reproducibly as a function of the<br>
25	torque, but also as a function of other operating<br>
	parameters.<br>
	To achieve this object, the present invention suggests a<br>
	transmission according to the species, in which the bracing<br>
30	device comprises a pressure device, which presses the<br>
	running surface of one of the two transmission elements<br>
	against the coupling element and also supports itself on a<br>
	bracing bearing with a variable pressure, and a spring<br>
	element, which is positioned to act in series with the<br>
35	pressure device.<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
	In the present case, the bracing device thus comprises all<br>
	of the assemblies of the transmission according to the<br>
	present invention which ensure sufficient pressure and<br>
	correspondingly are loaded with at least parts thereof,<br>
5	while the pressure device according to the present<br>
	invention has the assemblies responsible for a variable<br>
	pressure. By connecting the spring element and pressure<br>
	device in series, at the same pressure, which may<br>
	naturally, as a function of the spring constant of the<br>
10	spring element, may reach the same dimensions as in<br>
	pressure devices according to the related art, the pressure<br>
	device has significantly more movement play available,<br>
	through which essentially uniform movement of the pressure<br>
	device may be implemented. This particularly leads to<br>
15	increased reproducibility of the particular pressures. In<br>
	addition, the present invention allows variation of the<br>
	force-pressure and/or torque-pressure characteristic<br>
	curves, by varying the slopes of paths for cranks, rolling<br>
	bodies, or similar things, so that a tolerance equalization<br>
20	may be provided.<br>
	In a second achievement of the object, the spring element<br>
	cumulatively and/or alternatively preferably transmits both<br>
	the variable pressure and a torque between the running<br>
25	surface of the first transmission element and the bracing-<br>
	device and/or between the running surface of the first<br>
	transmission element and the pressure device.<br>
In this way, the pressure device may be relieved, at least<br>
30	partially, from the double load of transmitting torque both<br>
	directly to the running surface of the first transmission<br>
	element and/or to an assebly connected to this running<br>
	surface and simultaneously having to shift in relation to<br>
	this assebly. The above-mentioned object of applying- the<br>
35	variable pressure as reproducibly as possible may also be<br>
	fulfilled in this way. This embodiment is thus advantageous<br>
	cumulatively with or alternatively to the achievement of<br><br><br>
- 4 -<br>
	the object described above for a transmission according to<br>
	the species EP 0 990 99-3 A2 merely representing a spring<br>
	element, which is, however, connected in parallel to the<br>
	pressure device and does not transmit a torque,<br>
5<br>
	As a third achievement of the object, the present invention<br>
	suggests a. transmission according to the species, in which<br>
	the bracing device comprises a pressure device having two<br>
	pressure elements and at least one rolling element, which<br>
10	rolls on at least one rolling element path as a. function of<br>
	torque, which is implemented in such a way that a first-<br>
	pressure element is displaced in relation to the second<br>
	pressure element in the direction of the pressure when the<br>
	rolling element changes its position on the rolling element<br>
15	as a function of torque.<br>
	In this way, the displacement of the second pressure<br>
	element because of torque may be ensured at relatively low<br>
	friction, so that in this achievement of the object as well<br>
20	a high reproducibility of the pressure as a function of<br>
	and/or because of torque is ensured.<br>
	In a preferred embodiment, a torque sensor may be provided<br>
	on the drive and/or output side, the pressure of the<br>
25	pressure device being selected as a function of the torque<br>
	determined. In this way, the pressure and therefore a<br>
	contact force and/or friction force which occurs between<br>
	the coupling element and one of the transmission elements<br>
	may be adapted to the existing torque ratios. It is obvious<br>
30	that a sensor of this type may also be applied<br>
	advantageously independently of the remaining features of<br>
	the present transmission, particularly in a continuous<br>
	transmission and/or a transmission which acts via friction<br>
	or hydraulic interactions, particularly to adapt the<br>
35	pressure to the existing ratios and, for example, prevent<br>
	slip with the smallest possible losses or, for example,<br>
	select the transmission ratios suitably. Strain gauges<br><br><br>
- 5-<br>
	and/or tension meters or torsion meters and/or similar<br>
	measurement systems may be used as the sensor.<br>
	The latter arrangement described is particularly<br>
5	advantageous if the pressure device is activated<br>
	externally, as is particularly the case for hydrostatic or<br>
	hydrodynamic bearings. In addition, the pressure device may<br>
	also, particularly if it is implemented mechanically, be<br>
	activated internally as a function of torque, for example,<br>
10	by a torque which acts upon it. Particularly in an<br>
	embodiment of this type, a pressure caused by a torque<br>
	and/or a shift of components of the pressure device caused<br>
	by a torque may be used to measure the torque. In this way,<br>
	a torque measurement may be performed especially cost-<br>
15	effectively, since further costly torque sensors may be<br>
	dispensed with. This arrangement is especially advantageous<br>
	if the pressure device is provided in the driven.<br>
	transmission element of the transmission. It is obvious<br>
	that this arrangement also provides cost-effective<br>
20	achievement of the object independently of the remaining<br>
	features of the transmission.<br>
	In an pressure device, it may be advantageous,<br>
	independently of the remaining features of the present-<br>
25	invention, to provide a clutch element which alternately<br>
	disengages these two transmission elements from a third<br>
	transmission element by opening and/or engages them to this<br>
	third transmission element by closing, so that the<br>
	particular transmission path may be engaged alternately to<br>
30	an overall transmission. In an arrangement of this types,<br>
	the forces necessary to close the clutch element are<br>
	preferably applied by the pressure device. It is thus;<br>
	advantageous if the clutch element is positioned in the^<br>
	force path of the pressure:.<br>
35<br>
	In an arrangement of this type/ it is sufficient to open a<br>
	clutch to compensate for the pressure at a suitable point,<br><br><br>
— 6 -<br>
	so that the pressure no longer loads the corresponding,<br>
	clutch. In this way, the corresponding clutch opens and the<br>
	two transmission elements are accordingly disengaged.<br>
	Particularly if the pressure device is activated as a.<br>
5	function of torque, this immediately results in the<br>
	pressure being reduced since, because of the open clutch, a<br>
	torque is no longer transmitted. In this way, the forces to<br>
	be applied for opening are directly reduced to a<br>
	significant extent. In addition, the reduction of the<br>
10	pressure also causes a reduction of the losses which may be<br>
	caused by transmission elements which may possibly also be<br>
	freewheeling. To close the clutch, the corresponding<br>
	counterforce merely has to be reduced, so that the pressure<br>
	device is again active-. Therefore, no additional assemblies<br>
15	are necessary to close the clutch.<br>
	In an especially preferred embodiment variation, a gap may<br>
	be provided between at least one of the revolving<br>
	transmission elements and the coupling element during<br>
20	operation. Through as contactless operation of this type, a<br>
	transmission of this type may be made extremely low-wear,<br>
	even independently of the remaining features of the<br>
	transmission according to the present invention, a suitable<br>
	interaction mechanism being provided . between the<br>
25	corresponding transmission elements and the coupling<br>
	element for force and/or torque transmission. The coupling<br>
	is preferably provided via a fluid and/or a liquid which<br>
	remains in the gap despite a pressure and transmits the<br>
	necessary forces and/or torques. In addition, other<br>
30	interaction mechanisms may be provided, such as<br>
	electrostatic or magnetic arrangements.<br>
	A gap of this type is particularly suitable for conical<br>
	friction ring transmissions, in which the gap and/or the<br>
35	liquid is located between the cone and the friction ring at<br>
	least during operation. In this way, the ring may also be<br>
	positioned for a desired transmission ratio without<br><br><br>
- 7 -<br>
	anything further. However, a gap of this type is also<br>
	suitable for other continuously variable transmissions in<br>
	which transmission elements interact with one another<br>
	through friction.<br>
	In the present context, the concept of a "fractional<br>
	interrelationship" between transmission elements describes<br>
	an interrelationship in which torques are transmitted from<br>
	one transmission element to the other transmission element,<br>
10	without a form fit existing between these transmission<br>
	elements for this purpose. Typically, a certain slip exists<br>
	in a frictional interrelationship, at least above<br>
	relatively high limiting torques, a slip of this type<br>
	frequently occurring non-destructively and the<br>
15	corresponding transmissions typically being operated below<br>
	these limiting torques.<br>
	Alternatively and/or cumulatively to the gap described<br>
	above, a liquid, particularly a silicone oil, which<br>
20	comprises methyl siloxanes, dimethyl diphenyl siloxanes,<br>
	and/or methyl phenyl siloxanes having phenyl groups, may be<br>
	used as the liquid with which at least one of the revolving<br>
	transmission elements and/or a coupling element, such as a<br>
	friction ring, is wetted. In particular, dimethyl<br>
25	polysiloxanes, which contain, for example, phenyl-alkyl1<br>
	groups or fluoroalkyl groups, may also be used. In this<br>
	case-, dimethyl siloxy groups may particularly alternate<br>
	therein, individually or as siloxane blocks, with diphenyl<br>
	siloxy -groups.<br>
30<br>
	Liquids of this type are generally known under the term<br>
	"silicone oils, which are also - non-specifically- <br>
	generally disclosed in EP 0 B7B 641 A1 as a liquid for<br>
	wetting the revolving transmission elements of a<br>
35	continuously variable transmission.<br><br>
-8 -<br>
	Silicons oils have relatively slight lubrication<br>
	properties, which has been shown to be disadvantageous in<br>
	practical tests, particularly in interaction with rolling,<br>
	coupling elements, such as coupling rollers or friction<br>
5	rings, so that it is assumed that a liquid film breaks down<br>
	during operation with known silicons oils. However,<br>
	silicone oils are especially distinguished by a high<br>
	temperature carrying capacity of their properties in<br>
	comparison to other liquids.<br>
10<br>
	The liquids suggested, comprising methyl siloxanes,<br>
	dimethyl diphenyl siloxanes, and/or methyl phenyl siloxanes<br>
	having phenyl groups, particularly iff for example,<br>
	diphenyl siloxane blocks are incorporated into polyme-thyl<br>
15	siloxane, are distinguished by high compressibility in<br>
	comparison to other liquids, which presumably prevents<br>
	breakdown of the film. Thus, oils may be provided which<br>
	have behavior advantageous for transmissions having rolling<br>
	coupling elements in their temperature/viscosity end/or<br>
20	temperature/compressibility behavior, it having been found<br>
	that for systems of this type, liquids of any type whose<br>
	viscosity and/or compressibility changes with a<br>
	temperature-dependent viscosity gradient and/or<br>
	compressibility gradient which lies between the viscosity<br>
25	gradients and/or compressibility gradients of mineral oils<br>
	and the viscosity gradients and/or compressibility<br>
	gradients of dimethyl siloxanes, may very generally be used<br>
	advantageously for transmissions. Using these properties, a<br>
	liquid and/or an oil may lubricate the corresponding<br>
30	transmission enough so that operating temperatures which<br>
	are too high are not reached. However, the lubrication is<br>
	not so strong that sufficient coupling between the coupling<br>
	element and the corresponding transmission element would be<br>
	prevented. In addition, the compressibility window<br>
35	described produces sufficient stability of the fluid film<br>
	enclosing the components even under pressure, without<br>
	uniform distribution of the liquid being prevented.<br><br>
	In particular, liquids having polydimethyl siloxanes,<br>
	polydimethyl diphenyl siloxanes,, and/or polymethyl phenyl<br>
	siloxanes having phenyl groups, and/or alkyl-substituted y-<br>
5	trifluoropropyl-substituted polydimethyl siloxanes may be<br>
	used. "Silicones" may also be used in which organic<br>
	substituents, such as 10 to 25% phenyl groups or y-<br>
	trifluoropropyl groups or other alkyl groups, are contained<br>
	as substituents in the polydimethyl siloxanes which are<br>
	1.0 used.<br>
	In addition, cumulatively and/or alternatively, it is<br>
	especially advantageous if the corresponding liquid is<br>
	stabilized in regard to its temperature and, as much as<br>
15	possible, changes less in regard to its properties than<br>
	mineral oils do. In this way, a long service life of the<br>
	transmission may be ensured, since the corresponding fluid<br>
	degenerates less. Furthermore, the physical properties of<br>
	the fluid remain as constant as possible even in different<br>
20	operating states, such as under extremely high load or<br>
	extremely high speeds or even, for example, during start<br>
	procedures in winter.<br>
	In regard to the phenyl siloxane units in this polydimethyl<br>
25	siloxanes, and/or in regard to phenyl siloxane units in<br>
	siloxanes in- general, these may be used both in pairs and<br>
	in blocks in. order to achieve the desired results. In<br>
	addition, the compressibility described above is especially<br>
	advantageous in cooperation with a gap remaining between<br>
30	the coupling element and revolving transmission element,<br>
	which is filled with the corresponding liquid and is stably<br>
	bridged by liquid even at high pressures. In this case, the<br>
	liquid is used for force transmission, so that the shear<br>
	forces arising herein may connect the coupling element and<br>
35	the corresponding transmission element non-positively. In<br>
	addition, the high compressibility ensures that this<br>
	transmission is possible even at high and/or higher<br><br><br>
- 10 -<br>
	torques, at which only a small gap may implement<br>
	sufficiently high shear forces and a liquid film which does<br>
	not break down, the gap otherwise able to be maintained<br>
	only by high pressures and a high resistance forces of the<br>
5	liquid against pressures this high,<br>
	It is obvious that the above-mentioned considerations in<br>
	regard to the gap arid/or the liquidf whether relating t&amp;<br>
	their temperature stability, their compressibility, and/or<br>
10	their viscosity, may be advantageous, even independently of<br>
	the remaining features of the transmission according to the<br>
	present invention, individually or together for a<br>
	continuous transmission, particularly for a transmission<br>
	having two transmission elements which roll on one another.<br>
15<br>
	Particularly for transmission elements which are coupled<br>
	per se via a friction lock or even via hydraulic,<br>
	hydrostatic, or hydrodynamic, magnetic or other contactless<br>
	interaction, and/or other non-positive interactions, it may<br>
20	be advantageous if, in a transmission which comprises, two<br>
	running paths of a transmission element for a coupling<br>
	element, these running paths are provided with different<br>
	surfaces in order to able to implement and/or adapt the<br>
	interaction, for example, a surface pressure or something<br>
25	similar, in a suitable way. In this case, for example,<br>
	grooves or projections of different widths and/or a varying<br>
	surface texture and/or surface treatment may be provided<br>
	along at least one of the revolving transmission elements.<br>
	In this way, for example, a surface pressure may be adapted<br>
30	to different radii of the transmission element. It is<br>
	obvious that a surface variation of this type is<br>
	advantageous in running paths On a transmission element,<br>
	even independently of the remaining features of the<br>
	transmission according to the present invention.<br>
35<br>
	For an embodiment of the interaction which is independent<br>
	of the running paths, the surface of the coupling element<br><br><br>
- 11 -<br>
	may also be textured. In particular, the surface may have<br>
	grooves or something similar in order to influence the<br>
	shear and compression forces in -a suitable way in the event<br>
	of a hydraulic interaction. In addition, the coupling<br>
5	element may also have different surfaces for different<br>
	transmission elements with which it is in contact.<br>
	In order to ensure good shear force distribution,<br>
	particularly in interaction with a liquid which wets the<br>
10 	running surface of the coupling element and/or the'<br>
	corresponding running surface of a corresponding.-,<br>
	transmission element, without the liquid film breaking-<br>
	down, the coupling element may have at least one running-<br>
	surface having a cross-section which deviates from a<br>
15 	straight line, preferably having a convex and/or crowned<br>
	cross-section. A continuous liquid film which transmits<br>
	sufficient shear forces may thus be ensured even at high<br>
	pressures. The selection of the cross-section is preferably<br>
	tailored to the liquid in this case. Cumulatively and/or<br>
20 	alternatively, the cross-section may deviate suitably from<br>
	a straight line for a coupling element which is only held<br>
	on one side by a holding device, particularly as described<br>
	below since a one-sided holding device of this type,<br>
	although it leaves the coupling- element a relatively large<br>
25	amount of freedom, may also interact with a coupling<br>
	element, which is relatively unstable because of the<br>
	running surface deviating from a straight line, in a<br>
	stabilizing way, so that the overall system, particularly<br>
	in the event of a running path change, may also be operated<br>
30 	with a low expenditure of force.<br>
	It is obvious that a surface design of this type of the<br>
	coupling element and/or the revolving transmission elements<br>
	may also be used advantageously, independently of the<br>
35	remaining features of the transmission according to the<br>
	present invention, to design the interaction between<br>
	transmission element and coupling element.<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
	As already known front EP 0 980 993 A2 and/or from EP 0 876<br>
	641 Al, the coupling element, particularly if it is<br>
	implemented as a revolving friction ring, may change its.<br>
5	running path under its own power as a function of a set<br>
	adjustment angle. In this case, the angle of the coupling<br>
	element is preferably set to regulate the particular<br>
	running path. Since precisely this angle is critical in<br>
	regard to an adjustment and/or in regard to the stability<br>
10	of a running path which has been selected, it is<br>
	advantageous if a corresponding actuator for the angle of a<br>
	holding device and/or the holding device itself is<br>
	implemented without play through pre-tension, through a<br>
	spring for example. It is obvious that pre-tension of this<br>
15	type is advantageous even independently of the type of the<br>
	angle adjustment of the coupling element, particularly even<br>
	independently of the remaining features of the present<br>
	transmission.<br>
20 	in particular, a forced adjustment of the coupling element<br>
	may be provided, as is disclosed, for example, in DE 38 35<br>
	052 Al. Particularly in an arrangement of this type, it has<br>
	been shown to be advantageous, independently of the.<br>
	remaining features of the transmission, if the coupling<br>
25	element is merely in contact with a holding device in the'<br>
	approach region and is guided accordingly. It has been<br>
	shown that a guide of the coupling element in the departure<br>
	region brings instability into the system, since - because<br>
	of the positive control - in addition to the twisting of<br>
30	the coupling element, such as a friction ring, displacement<br>
	of the coupling element is also caused, which destabilizes,<br>
	the overall system if it acts in the departure region. For<br>
	this reason, it is suggested that the revolving coupling<br>
	element merely be in contact with a holding device in the<br>
35	approach region, through which instability of this type may<br>
	be avoided.<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
	It Is obvious that in the present context the term<br>
	"friction ring" also includes coupling elements in which<br>
	the friction ring does not interact frictionally directly,<br>
	but rather is in contact with the corresponding<br>
5	transmission elements via an interaction differing from a<br>
	positive connection.<br>
	In an arrangement of this type, a rotational degree of<br>
	freedom around an axis perpendicular to a rotational plane<br>
10	of the revolving axis of the coupling element preferably<br>
	remains between an actuator for the holding device, which<br>
	may be implemented by a spindle or even by a rod assembly,<br>
	for example, and the coupling element. In this way, the<br>
	influence of an adjusting positive control may be<br>
15	minimized, so that the friction ring and/or the coupling<br>
	element may assume its appropriate position almost<br>
	automatically. In particular, the possibility exists in an<br>
	arrangement of this type that the holding device may be<br>
	implemented extremely cost-effectively, since - in a<br>
20	minimal embodiment - it merely has to have a rest aligned<br>
	perpendicularly to the revolving plane of the coupling<br>
	element which points toward the coupling element. In an<br>
	alternative embodiment, the holding device may hold the<br>
	coupling element essentially without play and a<br>
	2 5 corresponding rotational degree of freedom, such as a<br>
	joint, may be provided between the holding device in the.<br>
	actuator. Alternatively, it is also possible for the<br>
	holding device to have sufficient play for the rotational<br>
	degree of freedom of the coupling element.<br>
30<br>
	Alternatively and/or cumulatively, a stationary holding<br>
	device may be provided for the coupling element, through,<br>
	which the coupling element may be held as selected in a<br>
	defined running path. Through a stationary holding device<br>
35	of this type, for example, a continuous operating state may <br>
	be implemented which may include rapid acceleration or<br><br><br>
- 14 -<br>
	braking caused by the motor only for special situations,<br>
	startup, for example.<br>
	In addition, a transmission having two revolving<br>
5	transmission elements is suggested, each of which has at<br>
	least one running surface for a revolving coupling element,<br>
	at least one of the running surfaces having at least two:<br>
	running paths for the coupling element having different<br>
	running radii and actuating means being provided, via which<br>
10	the coupling element may be adjusted from one of the two<br>
	running paths to the other of the two running paths and<br>
	which includes an activatable actuator, the transmission<br>
	being distinguished in that the actuating means includes a<br>
	safety device which adjusts the coupling element into a<br>
15	safety running path in the event of breakdown of the<br>
	activatable actuator.<br>
	Cumulatively and/or alternatively, it is suggested that the<br>
	safety device adjust the coupling element, preferably into<br>
20	the safety running, path, using a defined speed.<br>
	In addition, it is suggested cumulatively and/or<br>
	alternatively thereto that the safety device comprise pre-<br>
	tensioning of at least one further assembly of the<br>
25	actuating means.<br>
	Through the measures described, it is ensured that the<br>
	transmission remains in controlled operating states even in<br>
	the event of a system breakdown, particularly in the event<br>
30	of a breakdown of the controller. In this way, by pre-<br>
	tensioning an assembly, such as an actuating bridge, a<br>
	cage, or something similar, it may be ensured that if an<br>
	adjustment force of the activatable actuator fails, this<br>
	assembly reaches a desired position because of the pre-<br>
35	tensioning, so that the coupling element is adjusted in a<br>
	suitable way. Particularly if the coupling element is<br>
	adjusted into a safety running path, it is ensured, that a<br><br><br>
- 15 -<br>
	vehicle and/or a drivetrain having the transmission remains<br>
	functional and the coupling element does not leave the<br>
	running surface because of the system error. Preferably,<br>
	the safety running path is selected for a transmission<br>
5	ratio at which a motor may also perform start procedures.<br>
	In this way it is ensured that a vehicle may still be moved<br>
	up to a target point, such as a parking place, even if it<br>
	is only slowly. Otherwise, the vehicle would no longer be<br>
	able to start in the event of a temporary stop. However, if<br>
10	the transmission has further transmission elements which<br>
	regulate transmission ratios, such as a first gear, in<br>
	addition to the revolving transmission elements and the<br>
	coupling element, a running path having a transmission<br>
	ratio which allows more rapid travel may be selected as the<br>
15	safety running path. Start procedures may then be assumed<br>
	by this first gear, while the safety running path may be<br>
	used for more rapid travel.<br>
	The coupling element is preferably adjusted into the safety<br>
20	running path at a defined speed, since in transmissions of<br>
	this type arrangements are possible in which the coupling<br>
	element may be adjusted over all of the possible running<br>
	paths and/or over the entire running surface within a few<br>
	rotations of the corresponding transmission element, in<br>
25	arrangements of this type, uncontrolled adjustment under<br>
	unfavorable operating conditions would occur so rapidly<br>
	that the driving motor would not. be capable of adapting<br>
	itself to the changed operating conditions. This may lead,<br>
	to immediate stoppage of the motor, its destruction, and/or<br>
30	to destruction of the transmission, through which a motor<br>
	vehicle would suddenly become uncontrollable, for example.<br>
	Through a defined adjustment speed, it is ensured that the<br>
	operating conditions do not change in an- uncontrolled way<br>
	and particularly do not change too rapidly even during a<br>
35	system breakdown, of an electronic controller, for example<br>
	so that a motor may follow this change. A defined<br>
	adjustment speed of this type may be ensured, for example,<br><br><br>
- 16 -<br>
	through a suitable pre-tension. A safety running path may <br>
	be defined, for example, by a corresponding stop, which is<br>
	possibly provided with a spring. Two spring devices may<br>
	also be provided, one of which decisively controls at least<br>
5	the adjustment speed in one adjustment direction and the<br>
	other of which decisively controls at least the adjustment<br>
	speed in the other adjustment direction, so that the<br>
	corresponding coupling element may be guided from any<br>
	operating position into a safety running path without a<br>
10	hard stop through the interplay of these two fault<br>
	arrangements.<br>
	Instead of a fixed stop and/or instead of a fixed but<br>
	spring-loaded stop, the safety device may have an<br>
15	adjustable stop and/or an adjustable and spring-leaded<br>
	stop, which is displaceable via an additional actuator. In<br>
	this way, a directly unchangeably defined safety running<br>
	path does not result. Rather the running path may be<br>
	preset by the additional actuator.<br>
20<br>
	In addition, it is advantageous if the final positions of<br>
	the coupling element are detected by a sensor, particularly<br>
	electrically- In this way, special operating' states, such<br>
	as a defect of the transmission, may be detected rapidly<br>
25	and reliably. Preferably, the transmission additionally has<br>
	at least one mechanical end stop in the approach region of<br>
	the coupling element, against which the coupling element<br>
	may run in the event of a running path change and which are<br>
	positioned in such a way that they bring the revolving axis<br>
30	of the coupling element into a stationary position if the<br>
	coupling element runs against one of the end stops. This<br>
	achievement of the object is also based on the knowledge<br>
	that stable ring guiding is performed most reliably in the<br>
	approach region,, so that in this regard the end stops may<br>
35	actively influence the adjustment angle of the coupling<br>
	element and therefore its- travel from one running path to<br><br><br>
- 17 -<br>
	the other in order to prevent total transmission damage in<br>
	this way if the holding device breaks down, for example.<br>
	The features described above in regard to the holding<br>
5	device are also advantageous independently of the remaining<br>
	features of the transmission, particularly for<br>
	significantly reducing the number of assemblies and<br>
	therefore the costs for the overall transmission. In<br>
	particular, in a holding device of this type the holding<br>
10	device itself may be constructed significantly lighter, so<br>
	that the necessary movement sequences may also be<br>
	implemented more rapidly and/or using fewer motorized<br>
	drives. In this regard, a force-adjusted holding device<br>
	additionally has the advantage that the position of the<br>
15	coupling element may be determined directly on the basis of<br>
	the position of the holding device, so that further sensors<br>
	may be dispensed with.<br>
	In order to ensure, in a transmission having a continuously<br>
20	variable partial transmission, that problems in special<br>
	driving situations, for example, during slow driving, in a<br>
	reverse gear, and/or during constant steady load, are<br>
	reduced, a transmission having a continuously variable<br>
	partial transmission is suggested which is distinguished by<br>
25	two transmission paths connected in parallel, the<br>
	continuously variable partial transmission being provided<br>
	in a first of the two transmission paths.<br>
	An arrangement of this type allows special driving and/or<br>
30	load situations to be implemented by the second<br>
	transmission path, while the first transmission path may<br>
	provide advantages of the continuously variable<br>
	transmission. In the present context, the term "parallel<br>
	connection of two transmission paths*1 indicates that the<br>
35	two transmission paths have [word missing] between a shared<br>
	input-side partial transmission, such as the drive shaft of<br>
	a motor or a clutch disk or something similar, and a shared<br><br><br>
- 18 -<br>
	output-side partial transmission, such as the main<br>
	differential of a motor vehicle. Between the shared input-<br>
	side partial transmission and the shared output-side<br>
	partial transmission, the two transmission paths may be<br>
5	operated simultaneously alternately, additively, and/or<br>
	differentiallyr in order to thus meet different<br>
	requirements. It is obvious that an arrangement of this'<br>
	type is advantageous even independently of the remaining<br>
	features of the present invention.<br>
10<br>
	It may thus be advantageous if a reverse gear, a first <br>
	gear, and/or an overdrive is provided in the second of the<br>
	two transmission paths. For these situations, continuously<br>
	variable transmissions are only usable in a limited way and<br>
15	with a relatively large outlay and/or are subjected to<br>
	large losses, particularly in overdrive, i.e., at high<br>
	speeds and low torques.<br>
	If at least one freewheel is provided between the two<br>
20	transmission paths, these transmission paths may be guided<br>
	together without complex switching outlay and/or without<br>
	complex switching and regulatory technology.<br>
	Cumulatively and/or alternatively, in a transmission which<br>
25	comprises a continuously variable partial transmission, the<br>
	latter may be positioned between two power dividers, such<br>
	as a differential gear part or a planetary gear part, at<br>
	least one input of the continuously variable partial<br>
	transmission being mechanically connected to at least one<br>
30	output of an input-side power divider and at least one<br>
	output of the continuously variable partial transmission<br>
	being mechanically connected to at least one input of an<br>
	output-side power divider. Through an arrangement of this<br>
	type, a torque transmission may be implemented so it may be<br>
35	enlarged and/or the adjustment range of the continuously<br>
	variable partial transmission may be enlarged, this<br>
	occurring at the cost of the efficiency according to the<br><br><br>
- 19 -<br>
	current knowledge, since the two power dividers naturally<br>
	lead to losses. However, an arrangement of this type allows<br>
	a significant increase- in the breadth of application for<br>
	continuous transmissions. In addition, the torque which<br>
5	must be conducted through the continuously variable partial<br>
	transmission itself may be reduced, through which the<br>
	losses may be kept within limits with a suitable<br>
	implementation, since a lower torque in the continuously<br>
	variable transmission, particularly if it is a conical<br>
10	friction ring transmission, leads to lower losses there,<br>
	which correspondingly may reduce the losses in the power<br>
	dividers.<br>
	Cumulatively and/or alternatively, in a transmission which<br>
15	also comprises at least one forward gear and at least one<br>
	reverse gear, independently of the presence of a continuous<br>
	transmission, a differential gear may be provided which<br>
	implements this forward gear and this reverse gear, at<br>
	least one assembly of the differential gear part able to be<br>
20	fixed alternately with the housing and/or with another<br>
	assembly of the differential gear part. In this way, a<br>
	transmission having a forward gear and a reverse gear may <br>
	be implemented very compactly, in which, for example, a<br>
	differential assembly of the differential gear is; used as<br>
25	the input. If the central assembly of the differential is.<br>
	then connected to the second differential assembly, one<br>
	rotational direction may be implemented. In contrast, if<br>
	the second differential assembly and/or the central<br>
	assembly of the differential is connected to the housing<br>
30	and fixed in this way, the other assembly which is not<br>
	fixed changes its rotational direction, through which the<br>
	above mentioned gear reversal may be implemented. In this<br>
	way, a transmission which has a forward gear and a reverse<br>
	gear may be implemented especially compactly.<br>
35<br>
	In addition, a transmission is cumulatively and/or<br>
	alternatively suggested which comprises at least two<br><br><br>
- 20 -<br>
	transmission stages which may be switched alternately into<br>
	the transmission path via a switching gear part, a first of<br>
	the two transmission stages having a continuously variable<br>
	partial transmission. An arrangement of this type first<br>
5	appears contrary to the system, since a continuous<br>
	transmission is provided in order to be able to dispense<br>
	with switches of any type. However, an arrangement of this<br>
	type allows a continuous transmission to be. used only when<br>
	its advantages actually predominate. For example,<br>
10	relatively high torques frequently occur during startup,<br>
	which significantly load a continuous transmission end/or<br>
	require an excessively large design of the continuous<br>
	transmission. It is thus advantageous to implement a first<br>
	gear separately, for example, and only connect the<br>
15	continuously variable partial transmission after startup.<br>
	In this case, the continuously variable. partial<br>
	transmission may particularly be dimensioned in such a way<br>
	that before the switching procedure from one in to the<br>
	other; of the two transmission stages, the speed of the<br>
20	. second transmission stage is adapted by the continuously<br>
	variable transmission to. the speed of the first<br>
	transmission stage, so that the transition from the first<br>
	transmission stage to the second transmission stage and/or<br>
	even from the second transmission stage to the first<br>
25	transmission stage may occur continuously per se. In this,<br>
	way, the advantages of a continuous, partial transmission<br>
	may be exploited optimally, without having to accept<br>
	disadvantages as may arise during startup, for example,<br>
30 	This is also true for states having essentially constant<br>
	output and/or having essentially constant torques, in which,<br>
	a continuously variable partial transmission is not<br>
	absolutely necessary per se, since speed changes may be<br>
	implemented by speed changes of the motor. In operating<br>
35	states of this type, continuously variable partial<br>
	transmissions typically have high losses - caused by slip,<br>
	for example - which may be avoided by a connected<br><br><br>
- 21 -<br>
	transmission stage, the switching also able to be<br>
	implemented here at operating points at which a stage<br>
	change of this type is not or is only insignificantly<br>
	noticeable to vehicle occupants. In particular, the<br>
5	' continuously variable transmission may be brought into a<br>
	suitable operating situation for this purpose. For example,<br>
	engaging and/or disengaging a transmission stage of this<br>
	type via a freewheel is also conceivable.<br>
10	In addition, the transmission stage, which may be engaged<br>
	in addition to the transmission stage comprising the<br>
	continuously variable partial transmission, may comprise a<br>
	differential gear element which is used, for example, to<br>
	switch between forward and reverse gears arid for a startup<br>
15	gear. Particularly in an embodiment of this type, it is<br>
	advantageous if the assemblies of the differential gear<br>
	element which are necessary for switching between forward<br>
	and reverse qears are fixed via friction clutches, through<br>
	which the most careful and uniform changeover possible may<br>
20	be implemented.<br>
	In a transmission having two transmission stages, which may<br>
	be switched alternately into the transmission path via a<br>
	switching part part, a first of the two transmission stages<br>
25	comprising a continuously variable partial transmission,<br>
	the switching gear part may couple the continuously<br>
	variable, partial transmission to a pump wheel of a Trilok<br>
	converter, or another assembly which is connected directly<br>
	to a motor output shaft, and the second transmission stage<br>
30	may be coupled to a turbine wheel of the Trilok converter,<br>
	or another connectable motor output assembly. In this way,<br>
	the motor output, particularly in normal operating states,<br>
	may be conducted directly to the continuously variable<br>
	partial transmission, while, partictilarly during startup<br>
35	procedures, high torques may be transmitted to the second<br>
	transmission stage, so that it is unloaded in relation to<br>
	the continuously variable partial transmission. This is<br><br><br>
- 22 -<br>
	particularly true in the interact ion with the turbine wheel<br>
	of a Trilok converter, in which a torque overload naturally<br>
	occurs, which would otherwise significantly load the.<br>
	continuously variable partial transmission.<br>
5<br>
	Particularly in combination with an electric motor, a<br>
	continuously variable partial transmission having coaxially<br>
	positioned drive and output is advantageous even<br>
	independently of the remaining features of the transmission<br>
10	according to the present invention, since in an arrangement<br>
	of this type, torques acting on the housing may be<br>
	minimised in an especially compact way. Preferably, a<br>
	differential gear part is provided in the coaxial output,<br>
	which is in turn driven by an output of the continuous<br>
15	transmission. This arrangement is especially compact, since<br>
	the output of the continuous transmission acts without<br>
	further intermediate stages on a differential gear, which<br>
	must be provided anyway, particularly in motor vehicles. In<br>
	addition, gear wheels ox other transmissions are typically<br>
20	required anyway in order to provide a coaxial drive and<br>
	output, so that no additional components become necessary<br>
	due to the differential gear part. The arrangements<br>
	described above are suitable in connection with an electric<br>
	motor drive in particular, it initially appearing contrary<br>
25	to the system to connect an electric motor to a<br>
	continuously variable transmission, since the speed, of an<br>
	electric motor is nearly arbitrarily adjustable anyway.<br>
	However, the continuously variable transmission allows an<br>
	electric motor to be operated at speeds at which it has<br>
30	favorable torque/current intensity ratios. In this way, the<br>
	Overall efficiency of the corresponding drivetrain may be<br>
	elevated and/or the amount of current necessary,<br>
	particularly at low speeds, may be reduced.<br>
35	A transmission according to the present invention, but also<br>
	a different continuously variable transmission, may be<br>
	mechanically connected at the drive or output side to a<br><br><br>
- 23 -<br>
	disengagement point, such as a startup clutch/ a converter,<br>
	a friction disk, a hydraulic clutch, and/or a<br>
	synchronization. This arrangement, which is contrary to a<br>
	continuously variable transmission per se, has the<br>
5	advantage that the continuous transmission and/or the drive<br>
	may be cared for in startup procedures, so that the service<br>
	life is extended. A startup clutch and/or disengagement<br>
	point provided on the output side is especially<br>
	advantageous, since in an arrangement of this type a<br>
10	stoppage adjustment is possible with the motor running• In<br>
	addition, a startup clutch and/or disengagement point on<br>
	the drive side allows connection of other transmission<br>
	elements if they are necessary.<br>
15 	The output of the two partial transmissions preferably<br>
	engages at a drive of the following transmission path and<br>
	the partial transmissions are preferably guided together<br>
	again in this way. The transmission is built especially<br>
	compactly if this drive of the following transmission path<br>
20	is the main differential, i.e., the differential which<br>
	connects and drives the two wheels of a driven motor<br>
	vehicle axle. A compact construction of this type is<br>
	reflected in a lower piece count, through which the costs<br>
	may be reduced- In addition, a compact construction of this<br>
25	type results in a smaller overall volume, through which the<br>
	total costs for the motor vehicle may be reduced further.<br>
	Depending on the concrete implementation, it may be<br>
	advantageous if one of the two partial transmissions<br>
30	comprises a reverse gear, possibly having a first gear,<br>
	while the second partial transmission has. the continuously<br>
	variable transmission, particularly a conical friction ring<br>
	transmission, particularly if the first of these partial<br>
	transmissions dispenses with a separate first gear, this<br>
35	results in an especially compact construction having the<br>
	above-mentioned advantages.<br><br>
- 24 -<br>
	The two partial transmissions may preferably each be<br>
	engaged and/or disengaged. This may particularly be<br>
	performed by interrupting the particular partial<br>
	transmission path via a clutch. In a first approximation,<br>
5	it plays no role for this purpose at which, point this<br>
	interruption is performed; it way be both on the drive side<br>
	and on the output side, the transmission elements<br>
	positioned beyond this disengagement being able to run on<br>
	unloaded without anything further, so that the two partial<br>
10	transmission paths do not each have to be provided with two<br>
	clutches. To avoid losses because of freewheeling<br>
	transmission elements, however, multiple clutches may be<br>
	provided in the partial transmission paths. However, the<br>
	latter increases the number of components arid the<br>
15	installation space necessary, which in turn has effects in<br>
	regard to cost.<br>
	It is obvious that a construction of this type of a<br>
	continuous transmission having a parallel partial<br>
20	transmission is advantageous even independently of the<br>
	remaining features of the present, invention. This is<br>
	particularly true in connection with a conical friction<br>
	ring transmission as the continuous transmission, since in<br>
	this way the advantages of a rotational direction reversal<br>
25	caused by the conical friction ring transmission may be<br>
	implemented very effectively in a compact way with the<br>
	other partial transmission.<br>
	In regard to a compact construct ion, it is additionally<br>
30	suggested, in a continuously variable transmission,<br>
	particularly in a conical friction ring transmission, that<br>
	a clutch element, which is used for engaging and/or<br>
	disengaging the transmission path comprising the<br>
	continuously variable transmission, be provided inside one<br>
35	of the continuously variable transmission elements, for<br>
	example, inside a cone, of the particular continuously<br>
	variable transmission. In a continuously variable<br><br><br>
- 25 -<br>
	transmission, relatively large, interaction surfaces must be<br>
	provided on the essential transmission elements, so that a<br>
	corresponding variability may be ensured. Through the<br>
	arrangement of a clutch element of this type within. the<br>
5	transmission elements, which comprise these large<br>
	interaction surfaces, significant overall space may be<br>
	saved, since the otherwise unused overall space inside<br>
	these transmission elements may be used It is obvious that<br>
	an arrangement of this type of a clutch element shows the<br>
10	corresponding advantages in a continuously variable<br>
	transmission even independently of the remaining features<br>
	of the present invention.<br>
	Furthermore, cumulatively and/or alternatively, a<br>
15	continuously variable transmission, particularly a conical<br>
	friction ting transmission, having a reverse gear provided<br>
	behind the output in series with the remaining<br>
	transmission, is suggested, An arrangement of this type has<br>
	the advantage that the transmission nay be operated using a<br>
20	constant rotational direction, which is advantageous for<br>
	the continuously variable transmission in regards to its<br>
	activation and/or in regard to the adjustment of the<br>
	friction ring. In addition, this arrangement also allows<br>
	the reverse gear to be varied continuously.<br>
	In regard to the arrangement of the reverse gear, the terms-<br>
	"in series", "in front", and/or "behind" relate to the flow<br>
	of force in the drivatrain comprising a continuous<br>
	transmission. Thus, according to the present invention, the<br>
30	reverse gear is to be provided in series on the side of the<br>
	continuously variable transmission facing away from the<br>
	motor in the drivetrain.<br>
	The reverse gear preferably includes an epicyclic gear<br>
35	having at least one revolving gear mount, which mounts at<br>
	least one transmission element of the epicyclic gear and<br>
	may be fined alternately with a housing and/or with a<br><br><br>
- 26 -<br>
	revolving transmission element. Tfirougn an arrangement of<br>
	this type, a reverse gear is provided which as required -<br>
	may be switched even during the rotation of the drive,<br>
	i.e./ even during the rotation of the conical friction ring<br>
5	drive and/or the contiguously variable transmission, by<br>
	alternately fixing the revolving transmission element<br>
	correspondingly, filing of this type able to be performed<br>
	appropriately carefully through suitable clutches and/or<br>
	synchronizations. A changeover capability of this type is<br>
10	particularly tailored to the requirements of a conical<br>
	friction, rinq transmission, which may only have its<br>
	transmission ratio varied in the rotating state.<br>
	The reverse gear may particularly comprise a planetary gear<br>
	Is having pLa.net wheels, sun. wheel, and external wheel, of<br>
	which a first transmission element is mechanically<br>
	connected to the output of the continuously variable<br>
	transmission and a second transmission element is<br>
	mechanically connected to the output of the overall<br>
20	arrangement made of the continuously variable transmission<br>
	and reverse gear, while the third transmission element may<br>
	.be fixed at least in regard to one degree of freedom in<br>
	relation to a housing. A planetary gear has the<br>
	.advantageous property that when one of the transmission<br>
25	elements is fixed - external wheel, sun wheel, or planet<br>
	wheels, the latter advantageously maintaining their<br>
	intrinsic rotation capability - the particular other<br>
	transmission elements ma/ revolve further ^nd interact with<br>
	one another in accordance with the transmission ratios<br>
30 	resulting therefrom. In particular, a corresponding fixing<br>
	of a transmission .element, particularly in regard to a<br>
	degree of freedom, causes a substantial change of the<br>
	relative speeds between the remaining two transmission<br>
	elements, so that this change of the relative speed may be<br>
35	used to activate the reverse gear.<br><br>
- 27 -<br>
	The latter may particularly be ensured if the planet wheels i<br>
	are the third transmission element. If the planet wheels ,<br>
	per se are fixed in their rotational degree of freedom<br>
	around the corresponding sun -wheel in a planetary gear, a<br>
5	reverse in direction immediately occurs between the<br>
	external wheel and. the sun wheel, through which a<br>
	corresponding reverse gear may be implemented if the<br>
	particular forward gear is implemented with planet wheels<br>
	also running correspondingly, transmission ratios - if<br>
10	necessary - able to be selected in a suitable way through<br>
	the planetary gear.<br>
	The overall arrangement, made of the continuously variable<br>
	transmission and/or particularly of the conical friction<br>
15	ring transmission and reverse gear, is built especially<br>
	compactly if the first transmission element is driven by a<br>
	pinion revolving with the output cone of the- conical<br>
	friction ring transmission. An arrangement of this type<br>
	ensures immediate and direct force and/or torque flow<br>
20	between the conical friction ring transmission and the<br>
	reverse gear, so that the overall arrangement may be built,<br>
	extremely compactly and therefore extremely cost-<br>
	effectively, particularly for modern motor vehicles.<br>
25 	In regard to the latter requirement, it may be cumulatively<br>
	and/or alternatively advantageous if the second,<br>
	transmission element revolves connected to the revolving<br>
	mount of a differential. In connection with the use in a<br>
	motor vehicle in particular, the main differential may thus<br>
30	be advantageously used, so that the reverse gear is<br>
	integrated immediately and directly into the differential,<br>
	a compact construction resulting particularly in connection<br>
	with a conical friction ring transmission, independently of<br>
	the drive-side embodiment of the reverse gear.<br>
35<br>
	Particularly in regard to normal operation, it is<br>
	advantageous if the first and the second transmission<br><br><br>
- 28 -<br>
	elements may be fixed with one another. Depending on the<br>
	concrete embodiment of the switching process in regard to<br>
	the reverse gear, an adjustment of this type may also be<br>
	advantageously used in other ways in order to fix a desired<br>
5	operating state of the planetary gear. Because the first<br>
	and the second transmission elements may be fixed with one<br>
	another, a direct force flow via the planetary gear is<br>
	ensured, so that in this operating state the planetary gear<br>
	operates essentially without loss and the overall<br>
10	arrangement operates with an extremely high efficiency,<br>
	particularly in regard to a forward gear. The alternate<br>
	fixing of the third transmission and the two first<br>
	transmission elements is preferably coupled appropriately,<br>
	so that the planetary gear revolves, reliably in each of its<br>
15	states. It is especially advantageous in this regard if the<br>
	first and second transmission elements are formed by the<br>
	external wheel and sun wheel of the planetary gear,<br>
	respectively, and the third transmission element is formed<br>
	by the planet wheels, since in this way the necessary<br>
	2 0 interaction between the transmission elements may be<br>
	implemented very simply and compactly. This is particularly<br>
	true if the second transmission element is connected<br>
	directly to the revolving mount of the differential and/or<br>
	is implemented in one piece therewith and/or the first<br>
25	transmission element is driven directly by .a pinion running<br>
	with the output cone. In an embodiment of this type, the<br>
	overall arrangement, particularly in typical motor vehicle<br>
	drives, each of which are implemented with equidirectional<br>
	drives because of the high piece counts and variations in<br>
30	the complementary motor vehicle classes, leads to an<br>
	extremely compact and therefore cost-effective<br>
	transmission, which is even usable in extremely small<br>
	vehicles.<br>
35 	Greatly varying types of fixing, such as friction-lock or<br>
	form-fit connections, may be advantageously applied for<br>
	fixing the revolving transmission mount and/or the planet<br><br><br>
- 29- -<br>
	wheels or the third transmission element in relation to the<br>
	housing in regard to a degree of freedom, for example,<br>
	friction lock connections, which allow a smooth transition<br>
	and which - depending on the concrete embodiment - even<br>
5	allow switching on the reverse gear during rotation, have<br>
	bean shown to be particularly advantageous. However, the<br>
	latter is not advantageous for every application because of<br>
	the relatively high forces and friction losses, so that a<br>
	startup clutch between the motor and the conical friction<br>
10	ring transmission may be advantageous in cases of this type<br>
	in particular. Depending on the concrete application,<br>
	clutches, slanted brakes, synchronizations, and similar<br>
	arrangements may be suitable for the fixing, as are<br>
	generally typical in connection with well-known<br>
15	transmissions.<br>
	It is obvious that an arrangement of this type of a reverse<br>
	gear is also advantageous cumulatively with and/or<br>
	alternatively to the features of the present invention in<br>
20	order to provide a transmission with the corresponding<br>
	advantages described above. The degree of compactness and<br>
	therefore the number of assemblies used and/or the cost<br>
	reduction resulting therefrom and/or the rotational<br>
	direction of the motor are particularly in the foreground,<br>
25	in this case.<br>
In order to provide a continuously variable transmission<br>
	which may also transmit higher torques reliably and with<br>
	low losses, it is suggested that a transmission of this<br>
30	type be provided, cumulatively and/or alternatively to the<br>
	above-mentioned features, with at least two continuously<br>
	variable partial transmissions which are positioned in<br>
	parallel in a transmission path, the two continuously<br>
	variable partial transmissions being switched via summation<br>
35	gear at an input and/or output element.<br><br>
- 30 -<br>
	The use of a summation gear, also called a superposition<br>
	gear, has the advantage that identical speeds and/or<br>
	exactly fixed speeds for one of the transmission elements<br>
	of the partial transmissions,. as are necessary in the<br>
5	related art, are not required. Rather, both partial<br>
	transmissions provide their own, speed-dependent<br>
	contribution to the resulting speed of the summation gear.<br>
	The arrangement according to the present invention thus<br>
	allows both partial transmissions- to be activated and also<br>
10	regulated separately, and therefore uses the advantages<br>
	which result from disassembly of a continuously variable<br>
	transmission into two continuously variable partial<br>
	transmission, such as dividing the torque onto the two<br>
	Partial transmissions, without having to accept the<br>
15	disadvantages which result from a forced speed, such as<br>
	friction lasses or increased regulating cost, because of<br>
	this.<br>
	The switching of the two partial transmissions via the<br>
20	summation gear, which is asymmetrical and therefore free<br>
	per se, therefore causes advantages in an unexpected way in<br>
	regard to the transmission conception and/or usage,<br>
	particularly in regard to the efficiency and in regard co<br>
	the requirements on the controller, which is not possible-<br>
25	in the event of symmetry, as is required by the coupling of<br>
	the planet wheels of a planetary gear.<br>
	Typical representatives of a summation gear according to<br>
	the present invention are, for example, planetary gears, in<br>
30	which two of the three gear components (planet wheels, sun<br>
	wheel, external wheell are connected to the two partial<br>
	transmissions and the third gear component is used as the<br>
	output and/or drive, the planet wheels being used together'<br>
	as a gear components, and/or a differential, in which the<br>
35	two partial transmissions are each connected to one of the<br>
	differentiating elements of the differential.<br><br>
- 31 -<br>
	The two continuously variable partial transmissions may<br>
	have a shared transmission element on their side facing<br>
	away from the summation gear. This may be, for example, a<br>
	shared input shaft or a shared output shaft. This may also<br>
5	particularly be a direct transmission element of the two.<br>
	continuously variable transmissions, which is used together<br>
	by both partial transmissions. For this purpose in conical<br>
	friction ring transmissions, for example, one of the cones<br>
	suggests itself as the shared transmission element. Through<br>
10	an embodiment of this type, a transmission of this type is<br>
	built relatively compactly and cost-effectively, since the<br>
	total number of the elements of the corresponding<br>
	transmission nay be minimized through the double use.<br>
15 	In the present context, the term "the side facing away from<br>
	the summation gear" refers to a direction in the<br>
	transmission path which is defined by the. force flow<br>
	through the transmission and does not absolutely have to<br>
	correspond with the geometric and/or spatial relationships.<br>
20<br>
	Manifold continuously variable transmissions have a main<br>
	transmission plane, in which the essential assemblies, such<br>
	as input and output shaft, input and output cones, or<br>
	similar rotationally-symmetric bodies, are positioned and<br>
25	define a transmission plane in this way. A transmission<br>
	according to the present invention is built especially<br>
	compactly if the two main transmission planes of the two<br>
	partial transmissions are positioned parallel to one<br>
	another. An especially flat construction may be achieved if<br>
30	the two partial transmission planes are identical. A<br>
	transmission according to the present invention embodied in<br>
	this way is constructed extremely flat and is additionally<br>
	capable of countering even relatively large torques. Among<br>
	other things, a transmission of this type is thus<br>
35	particularly suitable for small trucks having diesel<br>
	engines, since it is especially well designed in regard to '<br>
	its overall space for attachment under a loading surface,<br><br><br>
- 32 -<br>
	for example, and in addition may counter the high torques<br>
	of modern diesel engines without anything further.<br>
	In addition, a further adjustable partial transmission,<br>
5	such as a switching gear and/or a reverse gear, may be<br>
	provided between at least one of the continuously variable<br>
	partial transmissions and the summation gear. Through an<br>
	arrangement of this type, transmissions having a very broad<br>
	drive behavior, particularly with the possibility of<br>
10	continuous forward and reverse drive, may be implemented.<br>
	In' particular, it is possible to feed back a transmission<br>
	of this type, even with the drive running, in such a way<br>
	that the output stops without torque.<br>
15 	Even if the present invention significantly increases the<br>
	efficiency of the overall transmission in relation to<br>
	transmissions according to the related art, continuously<br>
	variable transmissions, particularly under relatively<br>
	constant operating conditions, such as after a startup<br>
20	procedure or on a highway or freeway, display relatively<br>
	high losses. In order to avoid losses of this type,<br>
	particularly under operating conditions in which s.<br>
	continuously variable transmission is not absolutely<br>
	necessary, it is advantageous if at least one of the<br>
25	continuously variable transmissions may be bypassed. In<br>
	this way, for example, under the above-mentioned operating<br>
	conditions, the continuously variable partial transmission<br>
	having its relatively high losses may be bypassed, so that<br>
	under these operating conditions the efficiency is<br>
30	increased- It is obvious that the use of two continuously<br>
	variable transmissions of this type is advantageous even<br>
	independently of the remaining features of the present<br>
	invention.<br>

	The transmission illustrated in Figures 1 through 3 to<br>
	essentially comprises two transmission stages 1, 2, which<br>
10	may be switched alternately into a drive-train, via a<br>
	synchronized switching gear 3.<br>
	In this case, the first transmission stage 1 has a conical<br>
	friction ring transmission having two cones 4, 5, situated<br>
15	opposing in such a way that a gap 6 remains between the<br>
	cones 4, 5, in which a friction ring 7 runs while enclosing<br>
	the cone 5. So that this conical friction ring transmission<br>
	may transmit torques, the cone 4 includes a pressure device<br>
	8, which braces the two cones 4 and 5 between bracing<br>
20	bearings 9, 10 while applying a variable pressure.<br>
	As is particularly obvious from Figures 1 and 4, the cone 4<br>
	has a running surface 12 and, in addition, a bracing <br>
	element 11, between which the pressure device 8 is active;<br>
25	the pressure device 8 able to displace the bracing element<br>
	11 axially in relation to the running surface 12, so that<br>
	the bracing element 11 is supported an the bracing bearing<br>
	9 and, in addition, presses the running surface 12 against<br>
	the friction ring 7, this pressure being countered by the<br>
30	second cone 4 and the complementary bracing bearing 10.<br>
	In detail, the pressure device 8 includes two disk springs<br>
	13, 14, as well as two pressure elements 15, 16 and two.<br>
	roller elements 11 positioned between the pressure<br>
35	elements. As is immediately obvious from Figure 2, the disk<br>
	springs 13, 14 and the pressure elements 15, 16 are<br>
	positioned in series in regard to the pressure, so that a<br><br><br>
- 37 -<br>
	significantly larger movement play than that in the related<br>
	art remains to the pressure elements 15 in the event of :a<br>
	torque change, which leads to more precise and reproducible<br>
	setting of the pressure. In addition, the disk spring 13<br>
5	has radial recesses 13, 19, which engage in corresponding<br>
	projections of the assembly having the running surface 112<br>
	and/or the pressure element 15. In this way, the disk<br>
	spring 13 transmits torque between the assembly having the<br>
	running surface 12 and the pressure element 15, through<br>
10	which the pressure element 15 is unloaded from a torque-<br>
	loaded sliding movement in relation to the assembly<br>
	comprising the running surface 12, which in turn leads to<br>
	higher reproducibility of the resulting torque-dependent<br>
	pressure. The rolling bodies 17 run in paths of the<br>
15	particular pressure element 15, 16, which have a changeable<br>
	depth, in this exemplary embodiment. In this way, a torque-<br>
	dependent distance between the pressure elements may bie<br>
	implemented, the rolling bodies 17 ensuring high<br>
	reproducibility of the resulting pressure when the pressure<br>
20	elements 15, 16 are displaced around the circumference by<br>
	the occurrence of torque. It is obvious that the above-<br>
	mentioned features may advantageously ensure<br>
	reproducibility of the resulting pressure independently of<br>
	one another.<br>
25<br>
	In addition, it is obvious that instead of the balls 17,<br>
	other rolling bodies, such as rollers and/or rolling bodies<br>
	fixed stationary on the pressure element, may be used;.<br>
	Furthermore, it is also conceivable to provide a pressure<br>
30	device of this type in the driving cone 5.<br>
	Instead of the mechanical arrangement, however, in an<br>
	alternative embodiment a motorized actuator may also be<br>
	provided for the pressure device, which, like hydrodynamic<br>
35	or hydrostatic axial bearings, is driven on the basis of<br>
	measured torque in order to implement a torque-dependent<br>
	pressure.<br><br><br>
- 38 -<br>
	In addition, It is obvious that only displacement of the<br>
	pressure elements 15, 16, and/or displacement around the<br>
	circumference of the component comprising the running<br>
5	surface 12 and the bracing element 11 or, for example, an<br>
	axial force of the bracing bearings 9, 10, may be used to<br>
	determine the torque occurring.<br>
	The exemplary embodiment shown in Figures 1 through 5<br>
10	additionally includes a startup clutch, which is<br>
	implemented as a Trilok converter, on the drive side' in<br>
	relation to the continuously variable conical friction ring<br>
	transmission 2. For this purpose, the transmission stage<br>
	comprising the conical friction ring transmission 1 is<br>
15	connectable via the switching gear 3, and/or a drive<br>
	gearwheel 35 and a synchronized gearwheel 34, directly to<br>
	the pump wheel 21 of the Trilok converter 2G, startup able<br>
	to be performed via the turbine wheel 22 of the Trilok<br>
	converter and via a differential gear part 23. A<br>
20	differential side 24 of the latter differential gear part<br>
	23 is rigidly connected to the turbine wheel 22, while the<br>
	second differential side 25 is used from output of this<br>
	transmission stage and is connected via a gearwheel 26 and<br>
	to the gearwheel 27 of a main output shaft 28, comprising<br>
	2 5 an output pinion 33, of the overall transmission, the<br>
	gearwheel 27 also engaging with the output 29 of the<br>
	conical friction ring partial transmission 1. The output<br>
	pinion 33 may, for example, engage with the main<br>
	differential of a motor vehicle. The differential gear part<br>
30	23 comprises two friction clutches 30, 31, which may<br>
	alternately fix the main input of the differential gear<br>
	part 23 on the housing 32 or on the output 25. In this way,<br>
	as is immediately obvious,, the rotational direction of the<br>
	output may be changed, through which a forward- ana a<br>
35	reverse gear may be implemented without anything further<br>
	When clutches 30, 31 are open, the differential and the<br>
	turbine wheel 22 freewheel with it, so that the conical<br><br><br>
- 39 -<br>
	friction ring transmission may be- used in spite of the<br>
	coupling of the outputs -<br>
	This arrangement has the advantage that for startup and/or<br>
5	in the reverse gear, the advantages of the Triiok converter<br>
	20 may be used, in addition, forward and reverse gears are<br>
	implemented in an extremely compact way by the differential<br>
	23. In addition, through the switch 3, the disadvantage of<br>
	the Triiok converter 20, causing large output losses and an<br>
10	excess torque increase through slip in normal operation,<br>
	may be avoided, since the turbine wheel 22. nnay be short-<br>
	circuited by the switch 3 and the conical friction ring<br>
	partial transmission 1 is driven directly via the puitip<br>
	wheel 21. The output-side coupling of the two transmission<br>
15	stages 1 and 2 additionally allows the conical friction<br>
	ring partial transmission 1 to be set in regard to its<br>
	transmission ratio before a switching procedure between<br>
	these two transmission stages 1 and 2 in such a way that<br>
	the two transmission stages 1 and 2 are also nearly<br>
20	synchronised on the input side. The remaining<br>
	synchronization may be performed by the switching" gear 3<br>
	itself, the Triiok converter 2 0 also able to act as a<br>
	support.<br>
25 	In the transmission arrangement shown in Figure 6, two<br>
	revolving, cones 91, 92 positioned coaxially opposing are<br>
	also mechanically connected to one another via a friction<br>
	ring 93, which nay be displaced along a gap remaining<br>
	between the mantel surfaces of the cones 91, 92, so that<br>
30	different transmission ratios may be implemented. In this<br>
	arrangement, both the drive cone 91 and the output cone 92<br>
	are switchable via a synchronisation 94 onto a main output.<br>
	shaft 95, which in turn engages via a pinion 96 with the<br>
	main differential 97 of a motor" vehicle. In this-<br>
35	arrangement, the drive cons 91 and the output cone 92 are<br>
	connected to the main output shaft 95 with an identical<br>
	number of rotational direction reversals, so that a<br><br><br>
- 40 -<br>
	rotational direction reversal may be ensured immediately by<br>
	the synchronization 94. This arrangement allows a forward<br>
	and reverse gear to be implemented with the most minimal<br>
	number of assemblies, and therefore in an extremely cost-<br>
5	effective way. A rotational direction reversal may<br>
	alternately be caused in this case between only one of the<br>
	cones 91, 92 and the synchronization 94 by engaging<br>
	gearwheels or revolving belts, so that a first gear or an<br>
	overdrive may also be produced cost-effectively through<br>
10	this arrangement if necessary. Depending on the rotational<br>
	direction of the drive, the pinions 91a and/or 92a and the<br>
	wheels 91b and 92b may be connected via a belt arrangement<br>
	or may engage directly. In addition, it is conceivable to<br>
	provide a gearwheel which reverses rotational direction<br>
15	between the pinion 96 and the main differential 97.<br>
	The synchronization is preferably provided with a rest<br>
	setting and/or a middle position, so that the cones 91, 92<br>
	may freewheel. In this way, the friction ring 93 and/or<br>
20	another coupling element may be adjusted even when the<br>
	vehicle is stopped.<br>
	The arrangement shown in Figure 6 particularly uses the<br>
	rotational direction reversal of the conical friction ring<br>
25	transmission, in order to provide a forward and reverse gear<br>
	in a cost-effective way. It is thus also suitable for all<br>
	other continuously variable transmissions which reverse the<br>
	rotational direction.<br>
30 	In addition, the arrangement shown in Figure 6, like the<br>
	arrangement in Figures 1 through 5, has a transmission<br>
	element on both the output and the drive sides, using whith<br>
	the torque may be conducted around the conical friction<br>
	ring transmission 91, 92, 93.<br>
35<br>
	The drivetrain shown in Figure 7 also comprises a conical<br>
	friction ring transmission 40 as a continuously variable<br><br><br>
- 41 -<br>
	partial transmission which, as in the exemplary embodiment<br>
	shown in Figures 1 through 5, is assigned a power divider<br>
	41 on the drive side and a power divider 42 on the output<br>
	side. In this case, a first gear 4 3 is connected in<br>
5	parallel to the conical friction ring transmission 40 via<br>
	the power dividers 41 and 42, these being synchronized on<br>
	the drive side, as already described, and able to be<br>
	switched alternately into the drivetrain between drive 46<br>
	and output 47 via friction clutches 44, 45.<br>
10<br>
	The exemplary embodiment shown in figure 8 shows a coaxial<br>
	arrangement of drive and output, which advantageousaly<br>
	implements a coaxial output on both sides in a continuous<br>
	transmission, particularly in a conical friction ring<br>
15	transmission. This leads to relatively low housing loads<br>
	and, in addition, is built extremely compactly, an output<br>
	Shaft 50 preferably penetrating - particularly in this<br>
	exemplary embodiment - the drive cone 51 of a conical<br>
	friction ring transmission 52. This arrangement is also<br>
20	advantageous in other types of continuous transmissions,<br>
	particularly in combination with, electric motors, the<br>
	output shaft also able to penetrate through the armature<br>
	shaft of the electric motor in the latter case.<br>
25 	In this exemplary embodiment, a motor (not shown) thus<br>
	drives, via a drive 53, the driving cone 51, which in turn<br>
	acts on an output cone 55 via a friction ring 54. This cone-<br>
	is mechanically connected via a pinion 56 to an output<br>
	wheel 57, which is seated on the output shaft 50.<br>
30<br>
	The transmission shown in Figure 9, whose housing 60 is<br>
	placed on a housing 61 of an electric motor, has a similar<br>
	construction. In this exemplary embodiment as well, the<br>
	armature shaft 53 is implemented as hollow and is<br>
35	penetrated by the output shaft 50. The output pinion 66,<br>
	however, engages with a drive wheel 58 of a differential<br>
5	9, which is in turn connected to the two-part drive shaft<br><br><br>
- 42 -<br>
50.	Since a gearwheel must be provided at this point<br>
	anyway, this arrangement is built extremely compactly.<br>
	In addition, this arrangement has a planetary gear 62 for<br>
5	torque reduction as a supplement between motor and<br>
	continuous transmission, so that the continuously variable<br>
	transmission is not overloaded.<br>
	The conical friction ring arrangement 80 shown in Figure 10<br>
10	may particularly be applied in combination with the<br>
	arrangements in Figures 7, 8, and 9 and implement a reverse<br>
	gear extremely compactly, this transmission 90 including<br>
	two cones 81 and 82, which interact with one another via a<br>
	ring 83. The cone 82 has, in addition to a normal cone<br>
15	region (D), a region (R) revolving in the opposite<br>
	direction, which is implemented in this exemplary<br>
	embodiment by a conical ring 84 which revolves around<br>
	planet wheels 85, which are in turn mounted fixed in the<br>
	transmission housing 86 and whose insides roll on a conical<br>
20	shaft 87 of the cone 82. In this way, the conical ring 84<br>
	rotates opposite to the remaining part of the cone 82. In<br>
	addition, the cone 82 has a neutral region (N} , which<br>
	includes a ring 68, which is in turn mounted on the coins<br>
	shaft 81 so it rotates freely.<br>
25<br>
	In this arrangement, the friction ring 93 may first be<br>
	displaced from the main region (D) of the cone 82 into the<br>
	neutral region (N) , the conical ring 88 adapting itself to<br>
	the rotation preset by the main cone 82 and the friction<br>
30	ring 83, if the friction ring S3 is displaced further in<br>
	the direction toward the reverse region (R), it leaves the<br>
	main region (D), so that the rotational direction of the<br>
	neutral region (N) may adapt to the rotational direction of<br>
	the reverse ring 84, In this way, a reverse gear is<br>
	3 5 implemented, extremely compactly.<br><br>
- 43 -<br>
	A reverse gear 80 of this types, and/or even an arrangement<br>
	for rotational direction reversal implemented in a way<br>
	known per se, may particularly be advantageous with this<br>
	exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 7, since in this way<br>
5	if the power and/or speed dividers and/or adders 41 or 42<br>
	are switched suitably and the transmission ratios are<br>
	selected suitably, stoppage of the output shaft 47 may be<br>
	implemented, although the conical friction ring<br>
	transmission 40 and the shaft 43 rotate. In this way, all<br>
10	driving situations may be implemented in a vehicle, i.e.<br>
	reverse travel, forward travel, and stoppage, without<br>
	transitions and without further clutches, clutches or<br>
	further transmission stages certainly still able to be<br>
	provided for additional driving situations', such as full<br>
15	load or continuous load operation.<br>
	In the arrangement shown in Figures 11 through 18, which<br>
	essentially corresponds to the arrangement in Figures 1<br>
	through 5, so that repeated explanations will be dispensed<br>
20	with, two transmission paths 101, 102 are provided, which<br>
	may be switched alternately into a drivetrain via a<br>
	synchronized switching gear 123 and/or a conical clutch<br>
	134. In this case, the first transmission path 101 again<br>
	has a conical friction ring transmission having two cones<br>
25	104, 105 positioned opposing in such a way that a gap 6<br>
	remains between the cones 104, 105, in which a friction<br>
	ring 107 runs while enclosing the cone 105- So that this<br>
	conical friction ring transmission can transmit torques,<br>
	the cone 104 comprises a pressure device 10B, which braces<br>
30	the two cones 104 and 105 in a way known per so and/or<br>
	described above between bracing bearings 109, 110 while<br>
	applying a variable pressure. For this purpose, the<br>
	pressure device has two rolling elements 117 and guide<br>
	bodies 118 and 119, which are braced via disk springs 120<br>
35	and via which, as will be explained in the following, a<br>
	pressure which is a function of the torque is applied in<br>
	that the pressure device 10S expands as a function of the<br><br><br>
- 44 -<br>
	torque and correspondingly supports itself against the<br>
	bearings 109, 110.<br>
	As is particularly obvious from Figure 11, the reverse gear<br>
5	includes a drive wheel 124, using which the transmission<br>
	paths 102 is branched off from the main transmission path-<br>
	A switching wheel 125 is driven via intermediate wheels 130<br>
	and 133, which may be coupled via the synchronized<br>
	switching gear 123 to the pinion 126, which in turn engages<br>
10	directly with the external wheel 127 of the main<br>
	differential 115. The overall arrangement is built<br>
	extremely compactly and may be implemented even more<br>
	compactly if the drive wheel 124 is connectable to the<br>
	drive shaft 121 via a synchronized switching gear and<br>
15	engages directly with the external wheel 127.<br>
	In addition to this reverse gear 102, the arrangement<br>
	includes- a forward gear, which is implemented by the<br>
	continuous transmission 101. The forward gear is coupled<br>
20	vis. the pinion 129 to the external wheel 127 and thus to<br>
	the reverse gear 102 -and may be engaged and disengaged via-<br>
	the clutch 134. As is immediately obvious, the particular<br>
	transmission elements of the partial transmission paths 101<br>
	and 102also freewheel in the disengaged state.<br>
25<br>
	As already indicated above, the pressure device 106 works<br>
	together with the clutch 134. The mode of operation may be<br>
	seen most clearly on the basis of Figures 15 through 16, As<br>
	shown in Figures 15 and 16, the pressure device 108 may<br>
30	expand as a function of the transmitted torque. In this<br>
	case,, Figure 15 shows the arrangement at a high torque and<br>
	therefore high pressures and Figure 16 shows the<br>
	arrangement at low pressures. The pressure is essentially<br>
	generated s,s a function of the torque in that the support<br>
35	body 119 supports itself on the bracing bearings 109 via a<br>
	counterpart 150 and via an output shaft 151. The output<br>
	pinion 129 is also seated on the shaft 151. In addition,<br><br><br>
- 45 -<br>
	the shaft 151 is radially mounted on a centering body l53<br>
	via a needle bearing 152, Torque is transmitted to the<br>
	output pinion 129 from the output cone 104 via teeth |L54<br>
	(see Figure 18) and 155.<br>
5<br>
	In the pressure device 108, these torques cause a<br>
	displacement of the cone 117, so that the pressure may be<br>
	varied in the way desired, as is obvious in Figures 15 and<br>
	16, As is immediately obvious from Figures 15 through 18,<br>
10	the two bodies 119 and 150 press against one another via<br>
	conical surfaces 155, 157 (see Figure 18). Finally, the two<br>
	conical surfaces 156, 157 form the active clutch 134, which<br>
	is closed by the pressure device 108. To open the clutch<br>
	134, the overall arrangement has a cylinder 158 fixed on<br>
15	the housing, in which a piston 155 runs winch may have<br>
	pressure applied to it via a hydraulic line 160. The piston<br>
15	9 is mounted on the support body 119 via an axial bearing<br>
	161 and a support body 162. If the piston 159 has pressure<br>
	applied to it, it unloads the body 150 of the clutch 134<br>
20	from the pressure of the pressure device 103. As the clutch<br>
	134 opens, torque- is no longer transmitted, so that the<br>
	pressure device 103 relaxes, and only a very slight<br>
	pressure must be applied in order to open the clutch 134 pr<br>
	keep it open. When clutch 134 is open, a gap 163 remains<br>
25	between the conical surfaces 156, 157, as may be seen in<br>
	Figure 18. It is obvious that instead of the piston 153 and<br>
	the hydraulic line 160, other measures may also be<br>
	provided, through which the body 119 may be unloaded and<br>
	the clutch 13d may be opened. Any measure, using which the<br>
30	body 119 may be supported on the housing of the overall<br>
	transmission while bypassing the clutch 134, is especially<br>
	suitable.<br>
	The arrangement Shown in Figures 15 through 18 is<br>
35	distinguished in particular in that the piston 1.59 does not<br>
	also rotate, so that it may be sealed relatively costi-<br>
	effectively.<br><br>
- 46 -<br>
	The arrangement particularly has the advantage that no<br>
	additional devices are necessary to close the clutch. In<br>
	addition, the closing forces are a function of the torque<br>
5	transmitted and rise with it, since the pressure device is<br>
	correspondingly equipped in this regard in any case.<br>
	The arrangements shown in Figures 19 and 20 each comprise a<br>
	conical friction ring transmission 201 and a reverse gear<br>
10	202 connected in series therewith. In these exemplary<br>
	embodiments, the conical friction ring transmission 201<br>
	are constructed essentially identically and each have an<br>
	input cone 203 and an output cone 204,, which are positioned<br>
	axially parallel and pointing toward one another and<br>
15	between which a friction ring 205 is displaceable in a gap<br>
	206, so that a variable transmission ratio may be set as a<br>
	function of the position of the friction ring 205. The<br>
	friction ring 205 encloses the drive cone 203 in these<br>
	exemplary embodiments, while the output cone 203 carries an<br>
	2D output pinion 207- It is obvious that the conical friction<br>
	ring transmission may also be implemented differently,<br>
	depending on the concrete ebodiment.<br>
	In the exemplary embodiment in Figure 19, the output pinion<br>
25	207 engages directly with an assembly 206, which carries'<br>
	the sun wheel 209 of a planetary gear 210. The arrangement<br>
	shown in Figure 20 also comprises a planetary gear 211<br>
	having a sun wheel 212, which is driven by the output<br>
	pinion 207. This is performed via a belt 213 and a wheel<br>
30	214 which revolves with the sun wheel 212. All of the known<br>
	belt and/or chain arrangements through which a sufficiently<br>
	reliable force transmission may be ensured continuously may <br>
	be used as the belt 213.<br>
35	Both planetary gears 210 and 211 have planet wheels 215 and<br>
	2l6t respectively, which engage on one side with the<br>
	particular sun wheel 209 and 212, respectively, and on the:<br><br>
- 47 -<br>
	other side with a particular external wheel 217 and 218,<br>
	respectively.<br>
	In the embodiment in Figure 19, the external wheel 217 is<br>
5	connected directly to the revolving mount 219 of a<br>
	differential 220. In this arrangement, the planetary gear<br>
	210 and therefore the reverse gear 202 thus lie directly on<br>
	the differential 220. This arrangement has been shown to<br>
	have an extremely compact construction and extremely high<br>
10	efficiency for this reason, since the number of<br>
	transmission elements in the drivetrain is minimized. it is<br>
	obvious that a reverse gear 202 positioned directly on the<br>
	differential 220 is advantageous even independently of the<br>
	remaining features of the present invention, because of the<br>
15	compact construction. Otherwise, an arrangement in which<br>
	the output pinion 207 engages directly with an input wheel<br>
	of a reverse gear and the output wheel of the- reverse gear<br>
	is connected directly to the revolving mount of the<br>
	differential is advantageous for current motor vehicle<br>
20	engines because of the direction reversal caused by a<br>
	conical friction ring transmission since an arrangement bf<br>
	this type requires only a minimal number of transmission<br>
	elements and therefore has an extremely high efficiency.<br>
25	In contrast, in the embodiment in Figure 20, the external<br>
	wheel 218 is connected to an output wheel 221 and revolves<br>
	with it, which in turn engages with the revolving mount 222<br>
	of a differential 223. The direction reversal caused by<br>
	this is compensated for by the belt arrangement 213, the<br>
30	reverse gear being positioned on and/or around an<br>
	intermediate shaft 324 in the exemplary embodiment in<br>
	Figure 20. Arrangement on the intermediate shaft 224 has<br>
	the advantage over the arrangement directly a.n the<br>
	differential 220 suggested in Figure 19 that the overall<br>
35	arrangement in Figure 20 may have its spatial arrangement<br>
	implemented more flexibly. This is particularly<br>
	advantageous for environments in which the spatial<br><br><br>
- 48 -<br>
	relationship in direct proximity to the differential are<br>
	limited by third assemblies. It is obvious that the<br>
	arrangement of the reverse gear on an intermediate shaft<br>
	224 - particularly also because of the rotational direction<br>
5	change caused by it is advantageous even independently of<br>
	the remaining features of the present invention. The latter<br>
	is particularly true when conical friction ring<br>
	transmissions are to be used in combination with foreign<br>
	motors which have a contrary rotational direction. In cases<br>
10	of this type, the belt arrangement 213 may be dispensed.<br>
	with and the pinion 207 may engage with the collar 214.<br>
	Furthermore, it may be advantageous if the output cone 204<br>
	is positioned directly on the shaft 224, so that a separate1<br>
	output pinion 207 and the belt arrangement 213 may be<br>
15	dispensed with entirely.<br>
	In addition, it is immediately obvious to one skilled in.<br>
	the art that the- drive originating from the conical,<br>
	friction ring transmission 201 may also occur via the<br>
20	external wheels 217 and/or 218 and/or the other<br>
	transmission elements of the reverse gear instead of via<br>
	the sun wheels 209 and/or 212, The output of the reverse<br>
	gear also does not have to occur via the external wheels;<br>
	217 and/or 218. Rather, the sun wheels and/or other<br>
25 	transmission elements may also be used for this purpose.<br>
	In order that the exemplary embodiments shown in Figures 19<br>
	and 20 may reliably maintain their states "forward" and/ox<br>
	"backward", fixing systems .are provided in each case, using<br>
30	which a transmission element may be fixed rigidly, in these<br>
	exemplary embodiments a mount 225 and/or 226, on which the<br>
	planet wheels 215 and/or 216 are mounted a*d which revolves<br>
	with the planet wheels. Furthermore, fixing systems are<br>
	provided which allow fixing of two transmission elements of<br>
35	the particular planetary gear 510 and/or 211 to one<br>
	another. In this case, in the exemplary embodiment in<br>
	Figure 19, the sun wheel 209 and external wheel 211 are<br><br>
- 49 -<br>
	alternately fixed with one another, and in the exemplary<br>
	embodiment in Figure 20, the external wheel 218 and the<br>
	revolving mount 226 of the planet wheels 216 are<br>
	alternately fixed with one another.<br>
5<br>
	Different fixing systems, such as clutches, slanted brakes,<br>
	and/or synchronizations may be used to fix the transmission<br>
	elements to the housing and/or to one another. Three of<br>
	these are shown as examples in the exemplary embodiments<br>
10	shown, these able to be exchanged without anything further<br>
	(depending on the concrete requirements.<br>
	In the exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 19, the mount<br>
	225 of the planet wheels 215 is fixed using an<br>
15	electromagnetic brake 221, which may alternately brake a<br>
	braking pinion 228, which in turn engages with the mount<br>
	225 of the planet wheels 215. Therefore, if the rotational<br>
	direction is to be changed in this arrangement, the brake<br>
	is activated so that, in the degree to which the mount 225<br>
20	is slowed in relation to the sun wheel 209 and the external<br>
	wheel 217, the travel and/or speed of the output is reduced<br>
	until it finally comes to a stop and then changes the<br>
	direction.<br>
25 	External wheel 211 and sun wheel 209 are fixed via a brake<br>
	229, the planet wheels 215 also being fixed in relation to<br>
	external wheel 217 and sun wheel 209 in this way. Since in<br>
	this state the planetary gear 210 runs with extremely low<br>
	losses, this state is preferably selected as the forward<br>
30	gear, it being immediately obvious that a- brake<br>
	corresponding to the brake 22 9 may also be provided, for<br>
	example, between mount 225 and sun wheel 209 and/or<br>
	external wheel 211. It may also suffice to merely prevent.<br>
	the planet wheels 215 from rotating in relation to the<br>
35	mount 225, in order to correspondingly stop the planetary<br>
	gear 210 per se and allow it to revolve as a whole.<br><br>
- 50 -<br>
	in the exemplary embodiment in Figure 20, the alternate<br>
	fixing is performed via a synchronization 230, using which<br>
	the mount 22 6, which carries the planet wheels 216 and<br>
	revolves with them, may be synchronized alternately with<br>
5	the external wheel 219 or in relation to a fixed wheel 2 31,.<br>
	which is fixed on the housing 232 in this exemplary<br>
	embodiment. The mechanisms arising in this case correspond<br>
	to the mechanisms as already explained in the exemplary<br>
	embodiment in Figure 19, it being obvious that the mount<br>
10	226 may also be synchronized with the sun wheel 212 instead<br>
	of with the external wheel 218.<br>
The continuously variable transmission shown in Figure 21<br>
	has an input cone 301 and two output cones 302, 303, each<br>
15	of which is coupled via a friction ring 304, 305, which<br>
	revolves around the particular output cone 302, 303, to the<br>
	input cone 301, By displacing the friction tings 304, 305<br>
	along the gaps remaining between the cones 301, 302, 303<br>
	the partial transmissions 306 and 307, respectively, formed-<br>
20	by the cones 301 and 302 or 301 and 303, respectively, may<br>
	be varied continuously.<br>
	On the output side, the two partial transmissions 306, 307<br>
	and/or the two output cones 302, 303 are switched onto an<br>
25	output shaft 309 via a summation gear 308. In the exemplary<br>
	embodiment shown in Figure 21, the summation gear 308<br>
	comprises a planetary gear having an external collar 311,<br>
	planet wheels 312, and a sun wheel 313. The external collar<br>
	311 is connected fixed to a further collar 314, which in<br>
30	turn engages with 3 pinion 315 positioned on the output<br>
	shaft 316 of the cone 303. The sun wheel 313 is also<br>
	connected fixed to a wheel 317 and revolves with it, which<br>
	in turn engages with a pinion 318 which is positioned on<br>
	the output shaft 319 of the cone 302. Furthermore, the<br>
35	planet wheels 312 are mounted in a mount 320 which is<br>
	connected to the output shaft 309 and revolves together<br>
	with the output shaft 30 9 and the planet wheels 312.<br><br>
-51 -<br>
	Therefore, a summation gear 308 is provided in which the<br>
	speeds of the pinions 315, 310 and/or of the output cones<br>
30	2, 303 are added up to the total speed of the shaft 309<br>
	depending on the transmission ratio and the position of the<br>
5	friction rings 304, 305. The transmission ratios are <br>
	preferably selected in such a way that with an identical<br>
	position of the friction rings 304, 305, i.e., identical<br>
	speeds of the two output cones 302, 303, the planet wheels<br>
	312 stand still in regard to their intrinsic rotation in<br>
10 	the mount 320 and merely revolve together with the external<br>
	collar 311 and the sun wheel 313. In this way, losses in<br>
	continuous operation may be minimized. In addition, a<br>
	clutch 321 is used to minimize loss, using which the output<br>
	shaft 309 may be connected directly, or via a speed-change<br>
15	gear depending on the concrete embodiment, to the drive<br>
	cone 301, so that particularly at high and relatively<br>
	uniform speeds, at which the advantages of a continuously<br>
	variable transmission may hot be used in any case and<br>
	continuously variable transmissions of this type lead to<br>
20	unnecessary losses, the two partial transmissions 306, 307<br>
	may be bypassed.<br>
	As is immediately obvious, the summation gear 308 adds<br>
	together the speeds of the two cones 302, 303 and is also<br>
25	used as a torque balance for the torques applied to these<br>
	cones 302, 303.<br>
	The exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 22 essentially<br>
	corresponds to the exemplary embodiment in Figure 21, so<br>
30	that identically acting assemblies also have identical<br>
	reference numbers and repetition of the identical<br>
	functionalities will be dispensed with. In addition to the<br>
	features of the exemplary embodiment in Figure 21, the<br>
	exemplary embodiment in Figure 22 also has a fixing clutch<br>
35	322, using which the revolving mount 320 of the planet<br>
	wheels 312 may be fixed to the external collar 311, and, in<br>
	addition, a clutch 323, using which the mount 320 and the<br><br><br>
- 52 -<br>
	output shaft 309 may be fixed to a fixed clutch housing<br>
	(not shown in more detail) . The first clutch 322 is used<br>
	for the purpose of causing stoppage of the planet wheels<br>
	312 in their intrinsic rotation in certain operating<br>
5	states, so that losses due to the planet wheels 312 are<br>
	avoided and the housing 320 and the shaft 309 revolve<br>
	together with the external collar 311 and the sun wheel<br>
	313. The second clutch 323 is used for the purpose of<br>
	keeping the planet wheels 312 fixed in place, but rotatable<br>
10	around their own axes. This arrangement is particularly<br>
	provided for interaction with a transmission in which the<br>
	transmission is designed in such a way that the external<br>
	collar and the sun wheel 313 may and/or do revolve in<br>
	opposite directions- This may be implemented, for example,<br>
15	through an additional interposed gearwheel or even by a<br>
	separate reverse gear in the transmission path between at<br>
	least one of the partial transmissions- 306, 307 and the<br>
	summation gear 308. In an arrangement of this type, the<br>
	transmission gear 308 may be activated via the two partial<br>
20	transmissions 306f 307 in such a way that a speed of 0<br>
	results on the shaft 309 even though the drive cone 301is<br>
	rotating. In this state, the clutch 323 may be used, to fix<br>
	the transmission. In an arrangement of this type, it is<br>
	then possible to start up the output shaft 309 merely by<br>
25	adjusting the friction rings 304, 305 and/or by adjusting<br>
	the partial transmissions 306, 307.<br>
	The arrangement shown in Figure 23 also essentially<br>
	corresponds to the arrangement in Figure 23. The partial<br>
30	transmissions 306, 307 of the two arrangements are thus<br>
	identical. Only the summation gear 308 is implemented<br>
	differently in the arrangement in Figure 23 than in the<br>
	arrangement in Figure 23. For this reason, more detailed<br>
	explanation of the corresponding components and thsir mode<br>
35	of operation will also be dispensed with here.<br><br>
- 53 -<br>
	In the contiguously variable transmission shown in Figure<br>
	23, the output shaft 309 is connected directly to an<br>
	external collar 324 of a planetary gear and revolves<br>
	together with it. In addition, the planet wheels 312 are<br>
5	mounted in a mount 325 which may revolve together with the<br>
	planet wheels 312 and a wheel 326, the wheel 326 engaging,<br>
	with the pinion 315 on the output shaft 306 of the cone<br>
30	3. The sun wheel 313, in contrast, as in the exemplary<br>
	embodiment in Figures 21 and 22, is connected to a wheel<br>
10	317 which engages with the pinions 318 on the output shaft<br>
	319 of the cone 2.<br>
	The gear 309 shown in Figure 23 "thus also acts as a<br>
	summation gear and adds and/or subtracts the speeds of the<br>
15	two partial transmissions 306, 307.<br>
	The arrangement shown in Figure 24 also essentially<br>
	corresponds to the arrangement shown in Figures 21 through<br>
	23 in regard to its partial transmissions 306, 307.<br>
20	Essentially, only the gear 306 is implemented differently.<br>
	In this case, the. summation gear 308 is driven via beyel.<br>
	wheels 327 and 328, each of which is positioned on the:<br>
	output shaft 32 6 and 319, respectively, of the cones 303<br>
	and 302, respectively. For this purpose, the bevel wheels<br>
25	327 and 328 engage with bevel wheels 329 and 330,<br>
	respectively, which are in turn connected to the fixed<br>
	bevel wheels 331 and 332, respectively, of the<br>
	differential, which rotate around their own axis. the<br>
	output of the gear in Figure 2 4 occurs via a gearwheel 310<br>
30	which is connected to the axial bearings of the revolving<br>
	bevel wheels 333 and 334 of the differential, which in turn<br>
	engage with the bevel wheels 331 and 332, respectively, of<br>
	the differential- As is immediately obvious, a summation<br>
	gear is also provided by this arrangertien-t.<br>
35<br>
	The basic construction of the exemplary embodiment in<br>
	Figure 25 corresponds to the exemplary embodiment in Figure<br><br><br>
- 54 -<br>
	24, so that here the summation gear 308 is also essentially<br>
	formed by a differential 335, which drives the output shaft<br>
30	9 via a bevel wheel 337 using an output vrheel 336. In<br>
	addition, the output wheel 336 engages with a bevel wheel<br>
5	338, which is in turn connectable via a synchronized clunch.<br>
	339 to the drive cone 301, so that the two partial<br>
	transmissions 306, 307 may be bypassed as needed. In<br>
	addition, in this arrangement the output shafts 316, 319 of<br>
	the output cones 302, 303 are alternately swifchable via<br>
10	synchronized clutches 340 and 341, respectively, to. bevel<br>
	wheels 342, 343 and 344, 345, respectively, which in turn<br>
	engage with bevel wheels 346 and 347, respectively, each of<br>
	which is connected to the bevel wheels of the differential,.<br>
	which revolve around a fixed axis. The active rotational<br>
15	direction of the partial transmissions 306, 307 may thus be<br>
	changed easily by the clutches 34 0 and/or 341, so that the<br>
	transmission in Figure 2 5 has extremely versatile<br>
	transmission behavior.<br>
20 It is obvious that instead of the conical friction ring<br>
	transmissions 306, 307 shown, other continuously variable<br>
	transmissions may advantageously be used as partial<br>
	transmissions for continuously variable transmissions of<br>
	this type according to the present invention. As is<br>
25	immediately obvious from Figures 21 through 25f the partial<br>
	transmissions 306 r 307 have partial transmission planes,<br>
	defined by the particular cons axes 348, 349, 350, which<br>
	are each aligned parallel to one another, which all lie in<br>
	the plane of the drawing.<br>
30<br>
	In this way, these transmissions are built extremely flat<br>
	and are particularly suitable for use in trucks and/or<br>
	small trucks, since they may be provided below a loading<br>
	surface, fox example. It is all the more suitable since the<br>
35	transmission according to the present invention operates<br>
	with good efficiency by using two partial transmissions<br>
	even at higher torques, as are applied by modern diesel<br><br><br>
- 55 -<br>
	engines, because extremely high pressures may be avoided by<br>
	using two partial transmissions.<br>
	As already indicated on the basis of the description and<br>
5	the exemplary embodiment in Figures 21 through 24 and<br>
	explained for exemplary purposes on the basis of the<br>
	exemplary monument in Figure 25, the characteristic of the<br>
	overall transmission may be significantly influenced<br>
	through the selection of the rotational directions with<br>
10	which the partial transmissions 306, 307 act on the<br>
	summation gear 308, In particular, reverse gears of this<br>
	type and/or partial transmissions which change the<br>
	rotational direction are advantageous. An alternative in<br>
	this regard was explained in Figure 10 as an example for<br>
15	the above-mentioned partial transmission 80.<br>
	It is obvious that in the transmissions shown in Figures;21<br>
	through 25, the force flow may also be selected as<br>
	reversed, so that the output elements 309, 310 are used, as<br>
20	input elements and the input cone 301 is used as the output<br>
	cones.<br>
	As may be inferred from Figures 1, 4, 6, and 9 as well as<br>
	14 through 17, the continuously variable transmissions<br>
25	shown therein are each sealed in the direction of their<br>
	bearings by seals 70 (only identified as examples). In this<br>
	way, as is known from the related art, a separate fluid<br>
	chamber arises, in which the cones and the coupling- element<br>
	are positioned. In the present exemplary embodiment, a<br>
30	"sillicone oil" is preferably used as the fluid, in which<br>
	approximately 10 to 30 mole-percent of the methyl groups| in<br>
	polydimethyl siloxane are preferably replaced by phehyl<br>
	groups and whose viscosity at 25ºC is preferably<br>
	approximately 200 m2sec. However, any other fluid whose<br>
35	temperature .dependence of its physical and chemical-<br>
	parameters is stabilized in relation to the temperature<br>
	dependence of mineral oils and/or is located between the<br><br><br>
- 56 -<br>
	gradients of mineral oils and the gradients of silicone oil<br>
	in regard to the temperature-dependent; compression<br>
	gradients and/or the temperature-dependent viscosity-<br>
	gradients, may be used-<br>
5	<br>
	The temperature dependence of exemplary fluids and/or<br>
	liquids described above is shown as an example in Figure 26<br>
	in logarithmic form, the white line 8 9a representing<br>
	mineral oils and the white line 89b representing silicons<br>
10	oil. These fluids ensure under operating conditions that a<br>
	gap which is bridged by the fluid may form between the<br>
	cones 4, 5, 51, 55, 81, 82, 91, 92, 104, 105, 203, 204,<br>
	301, 302, 303 and the coupling elements 7,- 54, 83, 93, 107,<br>
	205, 304, 305, The existence of this gap may be detected in<br>
15	metallic components through electrical voltage<br>
	measurements, for example, it having been experimentally<br>
	determined that this gap is only formed after several<br>
	rotations, i.e., when the fluid is distributed, so that the<br>
	compressibility and the viscosity are to be selected<br>
20	suitably in regard to the gap dimension. In this case, the<br>
	bracing and/or pressure devices are dimensioned in such e<br>
	way that a corresponding gap is maintained in operating<br>
	conditions.<br>
25 In order to ensure uniform surface pressure for different<br>
	running paths and therefore for different radii of the<br>
	cones 4, 5, 51, 55, 81, 82, 91, 92, 104, 105, 203, 204,<br>
30	1, 302, 303, the running surface 12 of each cone is<br>
	preferably implemented as axially different. In the present30 	exemplary embodiments, this is implemented, through grooves<br>
	of different widths (not shown). Alternatively, an axially<br>
	varying surface roughness or something similar may be<br>
	provided.<br>
35 	The surface of the friction ring 7; 54, 83, 93, 107, 205<br>
	304, 305 is also preferably provided with grooves in order<br>
	to influence the shear force of the liquid in the gaps.<br><br><br>
57<br>
	remaining between the cones 4, 5; 51, 55, 81, 82, 91, 92,<br>
	104, 105, 203, 204, 301, 302, 303 and the friction ring 7;<br>
	54, 83, 93, 107, 205, 304, 305, as is shown for exemplary<br>
	purposes in Figure 27 on the basis of the friction ring 71.<br>
5 The friction ring 71 has two revolving surfaces 72, 73,<br>
	each of which, as explained on the basis of the fricti&amp;n<br>
	rings 1; 54, interacts with the surfaces of cones 4, 5; 51<br>
	55, 81, 82, 91, 92, 104, 105, 203, 204, 301, 302r 303. In<br>
	this case, the surfaces 72, 73 may have different surface<br>
10	designs. For example, trapezoidal webs 74 (cf- Figure 27b)<br>
	are especially advantageous, since they may support<br>
	themselves especially well on the remaining material of the<br>
	ring 71, Cumulatively and/or alternatively, rounded groove-<br>
	inlets (cf. Figures 27b and 27c) may be provided, through<br>
15	which inward flanges in a diametrically opposing surface<br>
	may be avoided. Rounded groove inlets 7 5 also appear<br>
	advantageous for the distribution of the oil film and/or<br>
	the surface pressure. Rounded groove bases (76, cf. Figures<br>
	27b, 27 c, and 27d), in contrast., may avoid notch effects in<br>
20	the groove bases under load. Essentially cuboid webs 77<br>
	(cf. Figure 27c) may also be provided-. The webs 78 having<br>
	round external cross-sectional shapes 79 may also be used,<br>
	as shown in Figures 27d and 27e.<br>
25 Grooves off this type may be provided identically and/or<br>
	differently both on the cones and, depending on the<br>
	concrete embodiment, on the friction ring surfaces. .In '<br>
	particular, the distribution of the grooves and/or webs may<br>
	vary over a surface, particularly in the axial direction.<br>
30	The surface pressure and/or surface pressure distribution,<br>
	for example, may thus be varied and/or set suitably even<br>
	along a cone and/or the all film thickness may be adapted-<br>
	The groove cross-section in particular largely determines<br>
	the drain quantity of the oil from the contact zone of the<br>
35	particular "transmission element in this case.<br><br>
- 58 -<br>
	In addition, the friction ring preferably has a crowned<br>
	cross-section, so that in spite of the existence of a gap,<br>
	the largest possible contact area may be implemented via a<br>
	Hertzian stress.<br>
5<br>
	The conical friction ring transmission shown in Figures 28<br>
	and 29 includes two bevel friction wheels 403, 404,<br>
	positioned on parallel axes 401, 402 at a radial distance<br>
	which ate positioned opposing to one another and have the<br>
10	same conical angle. Between the bevel friction wheels 403,<br>
	404, a friction ring 405 is positioned, which fills up<br>
	their gap, encloses the bevel friction wheel 403, and is<br>
	held in a cage 406.<br>
15 	The cage 40 5 comprises a frame, which is formed by two<br>
	crossheads 407, 408 and two parallel axles 409, 4l0<br>
	received therein. These axles 409, 410 are positioned<br>
	parallel to the axles 401, 402 and simultaneously to the<br>
	generatrices of the bevel friction wheels 403, 404 slanted<br>
20	at the conical angle and carry an actuating bridge 411<br>
	having two pins 412 pointing toward one another, on each of<br>
	which a guide roll 413 is seated. The guide rolls 413<br>
	engage the friction ring 4 05 on both sides and provide it<br>
	with the necessary axial guiding.<br>
25<br>
	The middle of the crosshead 407 has a vertical axis of"<br>
	rotation 14, around which the entire cage 406 is pivotable.<br>
	For this purpose, the lower crosshead 408 is connected to a<br>
	transverse drive 415 engaging therein (not shown in greater<br>
30	detail) and an actuating motor 416.<br>
	The axis of rotation 414 lies - in this exemplary<br>
	embodiment and in the exemplary embodiments explained below<br>
	- in the plane defined by the axes of rotation of the bevel<br>
35	friction wheels 4O3, 404. It may also lie in a plane<br>
	parallel thereto or intersect the former plane at an acute<br>
	angle.<br><br>
- 59 -<br>
	If the cage 406 is pivoted around small angles, the<br>
	friction drive causes an axial adjustment of the actuating<br>
	bridge 411 and therefore a change of the transmission ratio<br>
5	of the conical friction rings. A very low expenditure of<br>
	energy suffices for this purpose.<br>
To implement a pre-tension, a spring 417 is positioned on<br>
	the transverse drive 415, which applies a pre-tension to<br>
10	the cage 406. Through this pre-tension, it is ensured that<br>
	in the event of breakdown of the actuating motor 416 and/or<br>
	breakdown of the electronics which drive this actuating<br>
	motor 4l6t the cage 406 is pivoted around a defined<br>
	adjustment angle in relation to the plane defined by the<br>
15	axes of rotation of the bevel friction wheels 403, 404.<br>
	This causes, as is already known, the friction ring to<br>
	travel along the conical mantel surfaces because of the<br>
	rotation of the two bevel friction wheels 403, 404.<br>
20	In this case, the spring 417 is set in such a way that a<br>
	preset angle and therefore a preset travel speed and/or<br>
	adjustment speed is ensured, so that the driving motor is<br>
	not overloaded in regard to the actuating motor 416 .even in<br>
	case of a system breakdown.<br>
25<br>
	In addition, a slanted ramp 418 is provided on the<br>
	actuating bridge 411 in this exemplary embodiment, which<br>
	corresponds to a wedge 415 which is attached to the<br>
	transmission housing via a spring 420. Via the spring 420,<br>
30	a counterforce is applied against the force of the spring<br>
	41"?, SCJ that the friction ring is held in a defined safety<br>
	running path if the actuating motor 4l6 and/or another<br>
	element of the actuator has an operational breakdown. In<br>
	another embodiment, this arrangement and/or the spring 417<br>
35	may be dispensed with.<br><br>
- 60 -<br>
	The springs 417, 420 are selected in this exemplary<br>
	embodiment in such a way that the actuating motor 416<br>
	and/or the frictional forces of the bevel friction wheels<br>
	403, 404 may overcome then without anything further.<br>
5<br>
	The transmission shown in Figure 30 essentially corresponds<br>
	to the transmissions in Figures 28 and 29, so that 3 more<br>
	detailed explanation may be dispensed with This<br>
	transmission also includes two bevel friction wheels, only<br>
10	one of which is shown dashed as the bevel friction wheel<br>
	421. A cage 422 is also provided in this transmission,<br>
	which holds an actuating bridge (not shown) for a friction<br>
	ring (not shown) and is pivotable around an axis of<br>
	rotation 423. In this exemplary embodiment, the axis of<br>
15	rotation 423 is positioned approximately at the height of<br>
	the middle of the cone of the bevel friction wheel 421.<br>
	This arrangement also has actuating means, which comprise<br>
	an activatable actuator in the form of an actuating motor<br>
20	and/or a hydraulic actuator or a similar drive and a safety<br>
	device. In this case, the safety device has a spring 424,<br>
	which is attached to a transmission housing 425 and pre-<br>
	tensions the cage 422 in such a way that it is adjusted at<br>
	a slight angle in relation to the axis of the bevel<br>
25	friction wheel 421 when the activatable actuator is not<br>
	powered - for whatever reason. In this way, the cage 422 is<br>
	thus kept under a pre-tension in normal operating state<br>
	In a deviation from the exemplary embodiment shown in-<br>
30	Figures 2 8 and 29, this arrangement has a stop 427 spring<br>
	loaded by a spring 426. The spring 426 builds up a<br>
	counterforce when the friction ring runs against the stop<br>
	427, so that the cage 422 is adjusted against the force of<br>
	the spring 424 and the friction ring runs in a defined<br>
35	safety running path.<br><br>
- 61 -<br>
	This arrangement in Figures 31 essentially corresponds to<br>
	the arrangement in Figures 30, the stop 427 being dispensed<br>
	with, however. For this reason, identical reference numbers<br>
	have also' been selected in this exemplary embodiment.<br>
	Depending on the concrete embodiment of this exemplary<br>
	embodiment, the cage 422 may be used as a stop. However, it<br>
	has been shown that through suitable adaptation of the ring<br>
	surfaces, the friction rings experience a torque because of<br>
10	the rotational movements of the two bevel friction wheels,<br>
	which tends to twist the friction ring around an axis which<br>
	lies in the plane defined by the axes of rotation of the<br>
	bevel friction wheels and is positioned perpendicular to<br>
	the gap between the bevel friction wheels. This torque is<br>
15	apparently caused by the different contact areas between<br>
	the friction ring and the particular bevel friction wheel<br>
	and by the different radii of these contact areas and its<br>
	rotational direction is a function of the rotational<br>
	direction of the bevel friction wheels.<br>
20<br>
	Because of this torque, an unguided friction ring tends to<br>
	travel in a specific direction along the gap between the<br>
	two bevel friction wheels, This is also true for a friction<br>
	ring guided via a cage and/or an actuating bridge, as long<br>
25	as the cage and/or the actuating bridge is mounted so it<br>
	runs sufficiently smoothly and is otherwise free of forces.<br>
	Depending on the concrete embodiment of the surface of the<br>
	friction ring, the strength of this torque varies along the<br>
30	adjustment path.<br>
	In the embodiment shown in Figure 31, the spring 424 may be<br>
	selected in such a way that the spring- force- compensates. |<br>
	for the torque at a defined speed on a specific running<br>
35	path, which is then used as the safety running path. Beyond<br>
	this safety running path, the torque applied by the<br>
	friction ring predominatest so that the friction ring moves<br><br><br>
- 62 -<br>
	toward the safety running path, while on the other side the<br>
	spring force of the spring 424 predominates, so that it is<br>
	also ensured in this regard that the friction ring runs<br>
	toward the safety running path. An example of a safety<br>
5	running path 428 is shown in Figure 31-<br>
	Figure 32 shows a concrete implementation o£ the exemplary<br>
	embodiment schematically shown in Figure 31. This, is a<br>
	corresponding transmission as is used for a rear wheel<br>
10	drive of a vehicle. A hydraulic clutch and/or a hydraulic<br>
	converter 430 is located in front of an actual conical<br>
	friction ring transmission 429 and a planetary gear 431 ;is<br>
	located behind the conical friction ring transmission 4 2i9.<br>
	The output shaft 432 simultaneously forms the shaft of the<br>
15	driving bevel friction wheel 433, which drives, via a<br>
	friction ring 434, an output bevel friction, wheel 435, on<br>
	whose output shaft 436 a pinion 437 is seated, which<br>
	engages with a freely rotating gearwheel 440 seated on a<br>
	transmission output shaft 435. 'The transmission Output<br>
20	shaft 439 is aligned with the shaft 432 and is received<br>
	therein so it may rotate freely.<br>
A pinion 441, connected in one piece with the gearwheel<br>
	440, forms the sun wheel of the planetary gear 431. This<br>
25	engages with planet gearwheels 4 42 which are held in a<br>
	planet carrier 443, which runs around the transmission<br>
	output shaft 439. The planet carrier 453 has a cylindrical<br>
	projection, which encloses a magnet, wheel 444 which engages<br>
	with the planet gearwheels 4 42 and is connected fixed to<br>
30	the transmission output shaft 439 via longitudinal teeth<br>
	445.<br>
	Furthermore, a lamellar clutch 446 is provided in the<br>
	planetary gear 431, which may connect the transmission.<br>
35	output shaft 439 to the internal gearwheel 444. Finallyl,a<br>
	brake 446 is assigned to the cylindrical projection of the<br>
	planet carrier 443. By actuating the lamellar clutch, the<br><br><br>
- 63 -<br>
	forward drive is switched on If the hraks 446 is actuated,<br>
	the planet carrier 443 is fixed and a change in direction<br>
	of the transmission output shaft 439 results, i.e., a<br>
	reverse drive.<br>
5	<br>
	As is immediately obvious from Figure 32, the driving bevel<br>
	friction wheel 433 is enclosed by the friction ring 434,<br>
	whose inner mantel surface is fractionally engaged with a<br>
	running surface 415 of the driving bevel friction wheel 433<br>
10	and whose outer mantel surface is £rictionaly engaged with<br>
	a running surface 451 of the output bevel friction wheel<br>
	435.<br>
	The two bevel friction wheels 4 33, 4 35 may, as shown, have<br>
15	different diameters, through which a transmission stags may<br>
	be saved in the following output, if necessary. For reasons<br>
	of weight, the two bevel friction wheels 433, 435 may also<br>
	be implement as hollow, i.e., they may merely include<br>
	their mantel surfaces.<br>
20<br>
	The friction ring 434 is held in a cage 422, which is<br>
	positioned so it. is pivotable around the axes of rotation<br>
	423 at the. point 452. Two parallel axles 453 are held1 in<br>
	the cage 422, whose angle of inclination is equal to the<br>
25	conical angle of the bevel friction wheels 433. 435. An<br>
	actuating bridge 454, in which the friction ring 434 is<br>
	mounted so it slides, is guided on these axles 453.<br>
An actuating spindle 455, which is mounted on housing 425<br>
30	and which is connected to an actuating motor or magnet (not<br>
	shown) as an activatable actuator and engages on the cage<br>
	422, is provided for the adjustment of the cage 422. The<br>
	spring 424 is provided on the end of the cage 422 facing<br>
	away from the actuating spindle 455.<br>
35<br>
	It is obvious that the actuating bridge does not absolutely<br>
	has to be implemented like a bridge. Rather, any assembly<br><br><br>
- 64 -<br>
	which is displaceable parallel to the cone axes and guides<br>
	the friction ring may be used in this regard. This is also<br>
	true for the cage, instead of which any other assembly<br>
	which holds the actuating bridge may be used. Furthermore,<br>
5	this transmission also has seals 70 to separate the fluid<br>
	chambers. In addition, a gap is provided between the cones<br>
	433 and 435 and the friction ting 434 in the operating<br>
	state in this arrangement as well.<br>
10 	As already indicated above, a spring-loaded stop may be<br>
	dispensed with. Instead, a rigid stop may be used, for<br>
	example, as shown on the basis of the exemplary embodiment<br>
	in Figure 33. Otherwise, the construction o.f this exemplary<br>
	embodiment essentially corresponds to the construction of<br>
15	the transmissions described above, so that a more detailed<br>
	explanation will be dispensed with in this regard. In this<br>
	trsnsmissiori as well, a friction ring 4 60 enclose a bevel<br>
	friction wheel 461 and is mounted via an actuating btidge<br>
	462 and a cage, having two axles 463, which is pivotable<br>
20	around an axis of rotation 464, as in the above exemplary<br>
	embodiment, The mode of operation and/or cons cruetion of<br>
	the transmission is otherwise essentially identical to the<br>
	transmissions shown in Figures 1 through 5, 28 and 29<br>
	and/or 32. In contrast to the exemplary embodiment shown in<br>
25	Figure 30, the transmission in Figure 33 does not include a.<br>
	Spring-loaded stop. In this exemplary eiufcradiment, a fixed<br>
	stop 466 provided on the housing 4 65 is used to define a<br>
	safety tunning path. In this case the safety device has<br>
	means (not shown) which exert a torque on the cage araund<br>
30	the axis of rotation 464 in the direction of the arrow 467,<br>
	This may be, for example, a spring corresponding to the<br>
	spring 424 of the exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 30;<br>
	or a. torque caused by the rotation of the bevel friction<br>
	wheels and/or the friction ring 4 60. Upon reaching the stop<br>
35	466/ the torque 467 is counteracted, so that the friction<br>
	ring 460 is aligned perpendicularly to the plane formed by<br>
	the cone axes. If the counter torque exceeds the torque<br><br><br>
