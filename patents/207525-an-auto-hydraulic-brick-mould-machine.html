This description explains and specifies the nature of this new machine, its performance and working.<br>
This machine is used to fix the pressed material in to shaped bricks which is made up with the help of clay mixture or fly ash or stone powder and similar materials.<br>
At present, as known in the state of art, bricks of cutting with the help of a wire the existing machine is know as wire cut brick machine. In the existing system, the material is pressed into a narrow shaped wooden die while the material coming out like a cake form that is cut with the help of wire and preserved under a roof to dry.<br><br>
Another type of existing hydraulic machines being used in this fields or hallow blocks field or press the semi - solid material with high pressure at a sudden movement. The bricks prepared by this way is mechanically operated and there have been not time limit. In some cases the sudden pressure is given by a hydraulic cylinder in between fabricated frames (or) with in graded materials. This way large quantity of material pressed and shaped into small brick from the output is almost dry and suitable because of dry tight pressure packing.<br>
The main drawback of these machines is that there are not suitable for all type of clay. It can only be used for a particular soil, which are available in particular districts in India.<br>
In these machines one must use only semi - solid material (i.e. lightly water mixed) if the material is over dried or diluted there will be no result.<br>
Further, in the machines oil is used to polish the bricks at the same time used as lubricant for free flow of materials.<br>
MAIN BOX:<br>
Accordingly invention provides for the present invention comprises of following main feature;.<br>
A fabricated welded box is placed in the center. It has four side named as Al Bl CI and Dl. It has four circular rods. (1) projecting vertically from the four top corners of the box, which is rigidly, welded Four rods. (2) Projecting horizontally form the "Dl" side of the box. One end of the rods are welded with main box corners other threaded ends tightly fixed with a plate. (3) On the by nuts plate a hydraulic cylinder S2, is fixed.<br>
Al side of the box is opened as rectangular shape for the purpose of injecting material in to the box planch (4) Also welded in this side which is used to fix the machine with feeding box. A feeding box specially designed is used to feed the material in to the main box with particular pressure or Revolution per minute ( R.P.M) with the help of a torque hydraulic motor Bl side of the box is semi closed with fabricated plate a lower part of a torque hydraulic motor Bl side of the box is semi closed with fabricated plate a lower part of this side is opened to release the bricks without damage CI side of<br><br>
this box is completely closed but has some oval shape holes in order to prevent overloading or bust of machine. Dl side of this box has four rods (2) projecting horizontally this rods are tightly fixed with plates in one end another side end of the rods are welded firmly in the corner of Dl side of the fixed plate. This cylinder is known as S2 cylinder.<br>
Further the main box has 8 metal bushes (6) which are four each on the side of Al and CI and located two on the top side of Al two on the bottom side of CI each pair bushes are setup in a straight line. Through this bushes four rods (7) are of sliding this rods are designed as to easily move reciprocally these four rods are well polished and threaded in both end. In the Bl side of the main box. The inserted rods are fixed with the sliding box another Bl side ends are fixed with the U shaped plate (8) which has a stopper (9) This stopper is welded in one side of U shape plate and help to control the flow of material from the feeding machine. Further this stopper is designed as to insert in a rectangular key way gap (10) which is with the ' Al * side plate of the main box.<br>
AUXILLIARY BOX<br>
This box also has four sides A2, B2, C2 and D2 like main box and designed to<br>
set perfectly into the main box an this auxiliary box move vertically. On that movements the main box frame is acts as guide to auxiliary box in order to move freely and perfectly. There has been two guide stumps also to control the movement. Four sides of the auxiliary box is welded in corners and shaped neatly. A2 side of the auxiliary box is sectioned vertically into two by three plates. Sections are hollow as the size the brick and these section plates are arrested the flowing material in two sides. B2 side of the auxiliary box is plain plate the inner side of the plate has key way in where sliding box moves horizontally. D2 side of the auxiliary box is splitted into two pieces a gap is provided to decamped and clamp.<br>
The entire auxilliary box is welded with 4 angles (13) in the top corners, other ends of the angles are welded with a plate (14). In the centre of the top plate there is a threaded bush in which hydraulic cylinder S3 is connected. Also two pipes for lubricating the brick using water as lubricant are provided in the auxiliary box.<br>
SLIDING BOX:<br>
The sliding box has two plates horizontally one plate is thin (15) another is thick (16). These two plates are welded with one vertical heavy plate (17) on the center of this<br><br>
plate hydraulic cylinder S2 is attached. The gap between two pfetes are maintained according to the size of Bricks. The plates move to and fro while the sliding rods (7) move.<br>
While sliding the upper plate of this box is clamping in between Dl side of the main box and D2 side of the auxiliary box. A key way gap (18) is already provided for the straight clamping.<br>
INJECTION BOX:<br>
Injection box is a fabricated hollow shaped welded box is to feed the materials in to the main box. It has a door gap (22) and a plate shutter. The door gap have a gap to allow the clay mixed material to be filled in the box. A plate (20) press the material with help of cylinder (SI) and the limit switches LI and L2 control the to and from motion of plate 20. A lubrication system (23) is placed in the front edge of the box.<br>
A rectangular slot is made on the side of injection box for positioning the limit switch at the desired locations as per density of clay used.<br>
WORKING SYSTEM:<br>
STAGE ONE:<br>
In the initial stage the main box auxiliary box and sliding box are over lapped with one another. In this initial stage two brick shaped hollow space provided in between the three boxes.<br>
At first grinded clay material is pour in to the door gap (22). Then the gap closed manually now electronic control panel system gives on signal to limit switch (LI). Now plate (20) injects material.<br>
Into Al, A2 side of the main and auxiliary box which results the Material to form brick shape in the lower portion of auxiliary box. After feeding material control panel gives ON signal to limit switch (L2) which pulls plate (20) backward by SI cylinder.<br><br>
STAGE TWO<br>
Now control panel gives ON signal two limit switch (L3) which pulls ram and declamp the sliding box by cylinder (S2) now control panel gives ON signal to limit switch (L4) which operate cylinder (S3) and pull the auxiliary box upwards. Now the bricks are release from all arrested surfaces and get down to a conveyor surface. While moving the conveyor shift the bricks to drying shed for drying purpose.<br>
STAGE THREE:<br>
Now the control panel gives ON singal to limit switch (L5) which press the auxiliary box downwards by cylinder S3 after auxiliary box set in its original position control panel give ON signal to limit switch (L6) which moves the sliding box into its original position. By this way a same process carry over continuously by automatic electronic switches and electronic timers the inner surface of auxiliary box and inner surface of injecting box are lubricated by oil or water continuously special tubes and circulation system (23) is used to spray this liquid in the inner surface. Some holes and key ways are provided in the particular boxes for lubrication.<br>
The terms and expression in this specification are of description and not of limitations there being no intention to exclude any equivalents of the features illustrated and described since various embodiment the Auto hydraulic mold machine proposed here  in are possible without departure from the scope and ambit of the invention.<br><br><br><br>
