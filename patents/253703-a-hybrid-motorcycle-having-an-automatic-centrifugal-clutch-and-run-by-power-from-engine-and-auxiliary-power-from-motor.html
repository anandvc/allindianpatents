BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a hybrid motorcycle run<br>
by power from an engine and auxiliary power from a motor.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
A conventional hybrid vehicle run by power from an engine<br>
and auxiliary power from a motor is disclosed in, for example,<br>
JP-A-2000-287306. The motor of the vehicle disclosed in<br>
JP-A-2000-287306 is connected to a crankshaft of the engine,<br>
and the operation of the motor is controlled by a control device.<br>
The auxiliary power from the motor and the power from the engine<br>
are added at the crankshaft, and transmitted to a driving wheel<br>
as a resultant force. A power transmission system between the<br>
engine and the driving wheel includes a manually operable<br>
clutch.<br>
The vehicle disclosed in JP-A-2000-287306 is run primarily<br>
by the power from the engine, to which the power from the motor<br>
is added, when the vehicle starts running, in order to increase<br>
the driving force. The control device for controlling the<br>
operation of the motor rotates the motor to generate a<br>
predetermined torque when predetermined starting conditions<br>
are satisfied. One of the starting conditions for this vehicle<br>
is that the clutch mentioned above is engaged.<br>
1<br><br>
This vehicle uses a clutch switch to detect whether or not<br>
the clutch is engaged. In general, in vehicles such as<br>
automobiles, a clutch is disengaged when the operator presses<br>
a clutch pedal, and the clutch switch detects displacement of<br>
the clutch pedal, or a detection element integrated with the<br>
clutch pedal.<br>
The present inventors thought of providing a scooter-type<br>
hybrid motorcycle utilizing the conventional technique for<br>
hybrid vehicles described above.<br>
However, the scooter-type motorcycle is provided with an<br>
automatic centrifugal clutch, rather than a manually operable<br>
clutch, in the power transmission system between the engine and<br>
the rear wheel, and thus it has not been easy to realize a<br>
scooter-type hybrid motorcycle.<br>
Different from the engine, the motor generates a large<br>
torque at relatively low speed. Thus, if the clutch is not<br>
completely engaged when applying auxiliary power from the motor<br>
when the motorcycle starts running, transmission of this large<br>
torque causes friction members in the clutch to slip, which<br>
makes it impossible for the motorcycle to start running. That<br>
is, if it is not possible to accurately detect the timing at<br>
which the automatic centrifugal clutch is completely engaged,<br>
that would be a problem in realizing a scooter-type hybrid<br>
motorcycle.<br>
The clutch switch used in JP-A-2000-287306 mentioned above<br>
2<br><br>
merely detects displacement of a manually operable member, and<br>
thus cannot detect the timing when the automatic centrifugal<br>
clutch is completely engaged. Even if the clutch switch could<br>
detect the engagement completion timing of the automatic<br>
centrifugal clutch, providing such a clutch switch would<br>
increase the cost, and if the clutch switch broke down,<br>
auxiliary power could not even be generated.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made to solve the foregoing<br>
problems, and therefore has an object to provide a hybrid<br>
motorcycle with excellent start and acceleration performance,<br>
in spite of including an automatic centrifugal clutch.<br>
In order to solve the above problems, a first aspect of<br>
the present invention provides a hybrid motorcycle having an<br>
automatic centrifugal clutch interposed in a power transmission<br>
system between an engine and a driving wheel, and a motor for<br>
auxiliary power connected to a crankshaft of the engine, the<br>
motor having a power generation function and also being supplied<br>
with electricity from a battery to rotate, the hybrid motorcycle<br>
including: an acceleration data acquisition means for acquiring<br>
as acceleration data at least an accelerator operation amount<br>
of an accelerator operating element, of accelerator operation<br>
amount and accelerator operation speed thereof; a rotational<br>
speed detection means for detecting a rotational speed of the<br>
3<br><br>
crankshaft or a rotary body for rotation in sync with the<br>
crankshaft; a rotational speed estimation means for estimating<br>
an engagement completion rotational speed, which is a<br>
rotational speed at which the automatic centrifugal clutch is<br>
completely engaged, according to the acceleration data acquired<br>
by the acceleration data acquisition means; and a motor control<br>
means for supplying the motor with a magnitude of electricity<br>
in accordance with the acceleration data when the rotational<br>
speed detected by the rotational speed detection means has<br>
reached the engagement completion rotational speed estimated<br>
by the rotational speed estimation means.<br>
The invention of a second aspect provides the hybrid<br>
motorcycle further including: an electricity supply<br>
restriction means for continuing supply of electricity to the<br>
motor for a predetermined electricity supply time and<br>
discontinuing the supply of electricity to the motor after the<br>
electricity supply time has elapsed.<br>
The invention of a third aspect provides the hybrid<br>
motorcycle further including: a charge level detection means<br>
for detecting a charge level of the battery, in which the<br>
electricity supply restriction means shortens the electricity<br>
supply time as the charge level detected by the charge level<br>
detection means becomes lower.<br>
The invention of a fourth aspect provides the hybrid<br>
motorcycle further including: a charging means for causing the<br>
4<br><br>
motor to generate electricity after the electricity supply time<br>
has elapsed and charging the battery with the generated<br>
electricity.<br>
The invention of a fifth aspect provides the hybrid<br>
motorcycle, in which the acceleration data acquisition means<br>
acquires the accelerator operation amount and the accelerator<br>
operation speed as the acceleration data, and the rotational<br>
speed estimation means estimates the engagement completion<br>
rotational speed based on a higher one of a first rotational<br>
speed and a second rotational speed, the first rotational speed<br>
being obtained based on the accelerator operation amount<br>
acquired by the acceleration data acquisition means, and the<br>
second rotational speed being obtained based on the accelerator<br>
operation speed acquired by the acceleration data acquisition<br>
means.<br>
The invention of a sixth aspect provides the hybrid<br>
motorcycle, in which the motor control means includes a<br>
prerotation means for rotating the motor in conjunction with<br>
rotation of the engine after an engine start and in an operating<br>
state in which power from the motor is not applied to the<br>
crankshaft.<br>
The invention of a seventh aspect provides the hybrid<br>
motorcycle, in which a rotation start timing, at which the<br>
prerotation means rotates the motor in conjunction with<br>
rotation of the engine, is set to a timing after an engine start<br>
5<br><br>
and when an engine speed is lower than an idling speed.<br>
The invention of an eighth aspect provides the hybrid<br>
motorcycle further including: a charge level determination<br>
means for determining whether or not the charge level of the<br>
battery is lower than a predetermined minimum charge level; and<br>
a precharging means for causing the motor to generate<br>
electricity and charging the battery with the generated<br>
electricity after an engine start and in an operating state in<br>
which power from the motor is not applied to the crankshaft,<br>
if the charge level determination means determines that the<br>
charge level of the battery is lower than the minimum charge<br>
level.<br>
The rotational speed of the rotary body when the automatic<br>
centrifugal clutch is completely engaged (engagement<br>
completion rotational speed) changes according to the<br>
accelerator operation amount (magnitude of the output torque<br>
from the engine) . That is, as the accelerator operation amount<br>
becomes larger, the output torque from the engine becomes larger<br>
and hence the engagement completion rotational speed becomes<br>
higher.<br>
According to the present invention, the engagement<br>
completion rotational speed is estimated by the rotational<br>
speed estimation means according to the acceleration data<br>
(operation amount of the accelerator operating element,<br>
accelerator operation speed).  The motor is supplied with<br>
6<br><br>
electricity to generate power when the rotational speed of the<br>
rotary body is increased with the accelerator operation and has<br>
reached the engagement completion rotational speed.<br>
Therefore, according to the present invention, the<br>
auxiliary power from the motor can be applied to the automatic<br>
centrifugal clutch with the clutch completely engaged. Thus,<br>
the power from the engine and the auxiliary power from the motor<br>
can be efficiently transmitted via the automatic centrifugal<br>
clutch to the driving wheel. As a result, the present invention<br>
can provide a hybrid motorcycle with excellent start and<br>
acceleration performance.<br>
An existing sensor for use to control the rotation of the<br>
engine can be used to detect the operation amount and the<br>
operation speed of the accelerator operating element. Thus,<br>
it is not necessary to provide a new member for detection<br>
purposes, such as sensor or switch, in order to implement the<br>
present invention. In this way, the present invention can be<br>
implemented while reducing the cost.<br>
The hybrid motorcycle 1 according to the present invention<br>
does not include a sensor or a switch exclusively for detecting<br>
the completion of engagement of the automatic centrifugal<br>
clutch. Thus, according to the hybrid motorcycle, the<br>
operation to apply auxiliary power can be performed with high<br>
reliability compared to the case where a dedicated sensor or<br>
switch is used to detect the completion of engagement of the<br>
7<br><br>
clutch.<br>
According to the second aspect the invention, the supply<br>
of electricity to the motor is discontinued after the vehicle<br>
starts running or accelerates. Thus, the consumption of<br>
electricity in the battery can be reduced compared to the case<br>
where the supply of electricity to the motor is continued after<br>
the vehicle starts running or accelerates.<br>
According to the third aspect of the invention, the charge<br>
level of the battery is not lowered excessively. Thus, it is<br>
possible to secure electricity for use to cause the motor to<br>
generate auxiliary power next time.<br>
According to the fourth aspect of the invention, the battery<br>
can be charged after electricity in the battery has been<br>
consumed. Thus, it is possible to secure sufficient<br>
electricity to be supplied to the motor 13 next time.<br>
According to the fifth aspect of the invention, the<br>
rotational speed estimation means can estimate the engagement<br>
completion rotational speed to be higher as the accelerator<br>
operation speed is higher, even if the accelerator operation<br>
amount is constant. Thus, the power from the motor can be<br>
applied to the automatic centrifugal clutch at an appropriate<br>
timing in accordance with the accelerator operation speed, even<br>
in the case of a motorcycle which is often caused to start running<br>
or accelerate with the accelerator fully open, such as<br>
motorcycle incorporating a small-displacement engine.<br>
8<br><br>
Therefore, according to the present invention, the power<br>
from the engine and the auxiliary power from the motor can be<br>
more reliably transmitted to the rear wheel.<br>
According to the sixth aspect of the invention, it is<br>
possible to prevent the motor, which is not driving to generate<br>
auxiliary power, from serving as a load on the engine, which<br>
can stabilize the rotation of the engine in an idling state.<br>
According to the seventh aspect of the invention, the motor<br>
is rotated after an engine start and before the engine speed<br>
reaches an idling speed, which reduces a load on the engine.<br>
Thus, the engine shifts to an idling state while rotating stably<br>
after an engine start, even if the motor is connected to the<br>
crankshaft. Therefore, the present invention can provide a<br>
hybrid motorcycle in which the series of operations, including<br>
starting the engine and the vehicle starting running and<br>
accelerating, can be performed smoothly.<br>
According to the eighth aspect of the invention, if the<br>
charge level of the battery is low, the battery can be charged<br>
when auxiliary power from the motor is not necessary, for<br>
example when the vehicle is at a halt. Thus, according to the<br>
present invention, the battery can be prevented from being<br>
over-discharged, and it is possible to secure electricity for<br>
use to cause the motor to generate auxiliary power next time.<br>

denotes a front wheel of the motorcycle 1, 3a front fork, 4<br>
12<br><br>
steering handlebars, 5 a rear wheel as the driving wheel, 6 a<br>
power unit for driving the rear wheel 5, 7 a seat, and 8 a body<br>
cover.<br>
The front wheel 2 can be steered to the left and right by<br>
rotationally moving the steering handlebars 4. An accelerator<br>
grip 9 for increasing and decreasing the driving force of the<br>
power unit 6 and a front wheel brake lever (not shown) are<br>
provided at an end of the steering handlebars 4 on the right<br>
side of the vehicle body. The accelerator grip 9 constitutes<br>
the accelerator operating element of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the accelerator grip 9 is supported<br>
for free rotational movement on the steering handlebars 4,<br>
although not shown. The accelerator grip 9 is provided with<br>
an accelerator operation amount detector 11 (hereinafter simply<br>
referred to as "APS" (accelerator position sensor)) for<br>
detecting the operation amount (rotational angle relative to<br>
the handlebars) of the accelerator grip 9.<br>
The rear wheel 5 is supported for free rotation at the rear<br>
end of the power unit 6 to be discussed later, in order to be<br>
rotated by the power from an engine 12 and the auxiliary power<br>
from a motor 13 provided in the power unit 6.<br>
The power unit 6 is a unit swing type, and supported for<br>
free vertical swinging movement on a body frame by a link<br>
mechanism (not shown) coupled to the front end. As shown in<br>
FIG. 1, a cushion unit 14 is interposed between the rear end<br>
13<br><br>
of the power unit 6 and the body frame (not shown).<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the power unit 6 is made up of an engine<br>
12 and a motor 13 provided at its end on the front side of the<br>
vehicle (on the right side in FIG. 2) , a belt-type continuously<br>
variable transmission 15 (hereinafter simply referred to as<br>
"CVT") extending longitudinally on the left side of the vehicle<br>
body, an automatic centrifugal clutch 16 provided at the rear<br>
end of the CVT 15, a gear-type speed reducer 18 provided between<br>
the automatic centrifugal clutch 16 and an axle 17 of the rear<br>
wheel 5, a control device 19 (see FIG. 3) for controlling the<br>
operation of the engine 12 and the motor 13, etc.<br>
A main switch 21, a start switch 22, a battery 23, etc.,<br>
are connected to the control device 19. The start switch 22<br>
is intended to start the engine 12, and in this embodiment uses<br>
the motor 13 to start the engine 12. At the time of starting,<br>
the motor 13 substantially functions as a starter motor.<br>
Alternatively, a dedicated starter motor may be used to start<br>
the engine 12, as in the case with common conventional<br>
motorcycles.<br>
The engine 12 is a 4-cycle engine including a crankcase<br>
31 shown in FIG. 2, and a cylinder (not shown) provided in front<br>
of the crankcase 31 and extending upward. An intake system<br>
having a throttle valve 32 (see FIG. 3) and an exhaust system<br>
having a muffler 33 (see FIG. 1) are connected to the cylinder.<br>
The throttle valve 32 is connected to the accelerator grip<br>
14<br><br>
9 via a wire (not shown) , and opens and closes through operation<br>
of the accelerator grip 9. The throttle valve 32 is provided<br>
with a throttle valve opening sensor (not shown) for detecting<br>
the opening of the throttle valve 32. The throttle valve<br>
opening sensor is connected to an engine control section 34 of<br>
the control device 19 shown in FIG. 3 and to be discussed later,<br>
and sends to the engine control section 34 the opening of the<br>
throttle valve 32 as detected data.<br>
The engine 12 is arranged in such that the fuel injector<br>
35 (see FIG. 3) injects fuel into an intake passage. The fuel<br>
injection amount from the fuel injector 35 is set by the engine<br>
control section 34 according to the opening of the throttle<br>
valve 32 and the speed of the engine 12. The speed of the engine<br>
12 is calculated utilizing the number of ignition pulses<br>
generated by an ignition system having an ignition plug (not<br>
shown).  The ignition timing of the engine 12 is set by the<br>
engine control section 34 based on the rotational angle of the<br>
crankshaft 36.<br>
The rotational angle of the crankshaft 36 is detected by<br>
an electromagnetic pickup 37 (see FIG. 2) attached to the<br>
crankcase 31. The electromagnetic pickup 37 is positioned to<br>
face a tooth 38a provided to a rotor 38 (see FIG. 2) of the motor<br>
13 to be discussed later, and sends a detection signal to the<br>
engine control section 34 when it has detected the tooth 38a<br>
magnetically.<br>
15<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the crankshaft 36 of the engine 12 is<br>
supported on the crankcase 31 by bearings 39, 40 for free<br>
rotation. The crankcase 31 is made up of a left half 41 and<br>
a right half 42. The left half 41 is formed integrally with<br>
a longitudinally extending portion 41a extending<br>
longitudinally on the left side of the rear wheel 5, to which<br>
a transmission case cover 43 is attached.<br>
The left half 41 of the crankcase 31 and the transmission<br>
case cover 43 constitute a transmission case 44 housing and also<br>
supporting the CVT 15, the automatic centrifugal clutch 16, the<br>
gear-type speed reducer 18, etc.<br>
A motor housing 45 for the motor 13 to be discussed later<br>
is attached to the right half 42 of the crankcase 31.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, a driving pulley 4 6 of the CVT 15 is<br>
mounted to an end of the crankshaft 36 on the left side of the<br>
vehicle body. The driving pulley 4 6 is made up of a fixed sheave<br>
half 46a fixed to the crankshaft 36, a movable sheave half 46b<br>
supported on the crankshaft 36 so as to move freely axially<br>
thereof but not to rotate relative thereto, and a drive<br>
mechanism (not shown) for moving the movable sheave half 46b<br>
axially on the crankshaft 36.<br>
The CVT 15 is made up of the above driving pulley 46, a<br>
driven pulley 47 positioned on the rear side of the vehicle body,<br>
and a V-belt 48 wrapped around both the pulleys 46, 47. As<br>
conventionally well known, the CVT 15 continuously varies the<br>
16<br><br>
rotation of the crankshaft 36 for transmission to a rotary shaft<br>
49 of the driven pulley 47. The driven pulley 47 is made up<br>
of a fixed sheave half 47a fixed to the rotary shaft 49, and<br>
a movable sheave half 47b supported on the rotary shaft 49 so<br>
as to be movable axially thereof and also be urged toward the<br>
fixed sheave half 47a by a compression coil spring (not shown) .<br>
The rotary shaft 4 9 is formed in the shape of a cylinder,<br>
and supported for free rotation through a bearing (not shown)<br>
on an intermediate shaft 50 passing through the hollow part of<br>
the rotary shaft 49. The intermediate shaft 50 is supported<br>
for free rotation on the transmission case 44 through bearings<br>
51, 52. An input part 16a of the automatic centrifugal clutch<br>
16 is connected to an end of the rotary shaft 4 9 on the left<br>
side of the vehicle body.<br>
The automatic centrifugal clutch 16 is made up of the above<br>
input part 16a having a clutch shoe 16b, and a clutch outer 16c<br>
housing the input part 16a. The clutch outer 16c is fixed to<br>
an end of the intermediate shaft 50 on the left side of the<br>
vehicle body.<br>
An end of the intermediate shaft 50 on the right side of<br>
the vehicle body is connected to the axle 17 of the rear wheel<br>
5 via the gear-type speed reducer 18, which is a two-staged type.<br>
The axle 17 of the rear wheel 5 is supported for free rotation<br>
on the transmission case 44 through bearings 53, 54.<br>
With the thus constructed power unit 6, rotation of the<br>
17<br><br>
crankshaft 36 is transmitted from the driving pulley 46 via the<br>
V-belt 48 to the driven pulley 47 of the CVT 15, and then from<br>
the rotary shaft 4 9 to the input part 16a of the automatic<br>
centrifugal clutch 16. As the rotation of the crankshaft 36<br>
increases, the rotation of the input part 16a increases. Then,<br>
a centrifugal force increases the diameter of the clutch shoe<br>
16b, which causes the clutch shoe 16b to engage with the clutch<br>
outer 16c. This in turn causes the clutch outer 16c to rotate.<br>
This rotation is transmitted from the intermediate shaft 50 via<br>
the gear-type speed reducer 18 to the axle 17 (rear wheel 5) .<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, a rotor 38 of the motor 13 to be discussed<br>
later is mounted to an end of the crankshaft 36 on the right<br>
side of the vehicle body.<br>
The motor 13 is intended to apply auxiliary power to the<br>
crankshaft 36, and has a function to generate electricity by<br>
being driven by the engine 12. The motor 13 includes the above<br>
rotor 38 and a stator 61 fixed to the motor housing 45, and as<br>
shown in FIG. 3, is connected to a motor/generator control<br>
section 62 of the control device 19.<br>
The rotor 38 is made up of a boss 38b fixed to the crankshaft<br>
36, a disk 38c extending radially from an end of the boss 38b<br>
on the left side of the vehicle body, a cylinder 38d housing<br>
the disk 38c, and a permanent magnet 63 secured to an end surface<br>
of the disk 38c on the right side of the vehicle body. The tooth<br>
38a to be detected by the electromagnetic pickup 37 is formed<br>
18<br><br>
on the outer periphery of the cylinder 38d. The motor 13<br>
directly drives the crankshaft 36.<br>
The stator 61 incorporates a coil 64, and is fixed to the<br>
motor housing 45 in such a manner as to be partially inserted<br>
into the cylinder 38d and face the permanent magnet 63. The<br>
stator 61 is provided on a circumference centered on the axis<br>
of the crankshaft 36.<br>
The stator 61 of the motor 13 also incorporates an encoder<br>
65 (see FIG. 3) for detecting the speed of the rotor 38 (speed<br>
of the crankshaft 36).<br>
The motor/generator control section 62 is intended to<br>
control the timing for supplying the motor 13 with electricity<br>
and the magnitude of the electricity, and also switch the motor<br>
13 to function as a generator. As shown in FIG. 4, the<br>
motor/generator control section 62 includes an acceleration<br>
data acquisition means 71, a rotational speed detection means<br>
72, a rotational speed estimation means 73, a motor control<br>
means 74, a charge level detection means 75, a charging means<br>
76, a charge level determination means 77, a precharging means<br>
78 and a timer 79.<br>
The acceleration data acquisition means 71 acquires the<br>
accelerator operation amount (operation angle of the<br>
accelerator grip 9) detected by the APS 11 and the accelerator<br>
operation speed (speed at the time when the accelerator grip<br>
9 is operated) as acceleration data.<br>
19<br><br>
The rotational speed detection means 72 detects the speed<br>
of the engine 12. According to this embodiment, the rotational<br>
speed detection means 72 is arranged to obtain the speed of the<br>
crankshaft 36 using the encoder 65.  Instead of the speed of<br>
the crankshaft 36, the rotational speed detection means 72 may<br>
detect the speed of the rotor 38 of the motor 13. Also, the<br>
rotational speed detection means 72 may detect the rotational<br>
speed of a rotary body directly connected to the crankshaft 36,<br>
the rotor 38 or the like for rotation in sync therewith, or that<br>
of a rotary body (not shown) connected to the crankshaft 36,<br>
the rotor 38 or the like via a transmission means (not shown)<br>
such as gear or chain for rotation in sync therewith. To detect<br>
the speed of the rotor 38, the electromagnetic pickup 37 may<br>
be used.<br>
The rotational speed estimation means 73 estimates the<br>
speed of the engine 12 at which the motor 13 is caused to generate<br>
auxiliary power, in a manner to be described later. Here,<br>
estimation is made in such that the estimated rotational speed<br>
is the rotational speed at which the automatic centrifugal<br>
clutch is completely engaged (engagement completion rotational<br>
speed).<br>
For example, in the case where the accelerator grip 9 is<br>
operated greatly and rapidly, the power from the engine 12 to<br>
be applied to the automatic centrifugal clutch 16 becomes<br>
relatively large, which makes the rotational speed at which the<br>
20<br><br>
automatic centrifugal clutch 16 is completely engaged<br>
relatively high. Thus, the engagement completion rotational<br>
speed is estimated to be relatively high. In the case where<br>
the engagement completion rotational speed is not estimated and<br>
the motor 13 is supplied with electricity in conjunction with<br>
the accelerator operation, auxiliary power is generated by the<br>
driving of the motor 13 right at the start of the accelerator<br>
operation, and too large a torque is applied before the<br>
automatic centrifugal clutch 16 has been completely engaged.<br>
Thus, the clutch shoe 16b may slip to prevent the vehicle from<br>
starting running.<br>
The rotational speed estimation means 73 estimates the<br>
engagement completion rotational speed based on a higher one<br>
of a provisional rotational speed estimated based on the<br>
accelerator operation amount (hereinafter referred to as "first<br>
rotational speed") and a provisional rotational speed estimated<br>
based on the accelerator operation speed (hereinafter referred<br>
to as "second rotational speed").<br>
Now, a detailed description will be made of how to estimate<br>
the engagement completion rotational speed. The rotational<br>
speed estimation means 73 according to this embodiment<br>
estimates the final engagement completion rotational speed<br>
using the maps shown in FIGs. 5 (A) to 5 (C) . FIG. 5 (A) is a graph<br>
as a map for obtaining a set value A, which is equivalent to<br>
the first rotational speed in accordance with the accelerator<br>
21<br><br>
operation amount. FIG. 5 (B) is a graph as a map for obtaining<br>
a set value B, which is equivalent to the second rotational speed<br>
in accordance with the accelerator operation speed. FIG. 5(C)<br>
is a graph as a map for estimating the final engagement<br>
completion rotational speed based on the set value A and the<br>
set value B.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5 (A) , the set value A is set in such that<br>
the rotational speed becomes higher as the accelerator<br>
operation amount becomes larger until the accelerator operation<br>
amount reaches a predetermined upper limit, and in such that<br>
the rotational speed maintains a constant maximum speed, even<br>
if the accelerator operation amount increases, after the<br>
accelerator operation amount has reached the upper limit.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5(B), the set value B is set in such that<br>
the rotational speed becomes higher as the accelerator<br>
operation speed becomes higher until the accelerator operation<br>
speed reaches a predetermined upper limit, and in such that the<br>
rotational speed maintains a constant maximum speed, even if<br>
the accelerator operation speed increases, after the<br>
accelerator operation speed has reached the upper limit.<br>
The rotational speed estimation means 73 reads a set value<br>
A in accordance with the accelerator operation amount acquired<br>
by the acceleration data acquisition means 71, from the map<br>
shown in FIG. 5 (A) . The rotational speed estimation means 73<br>
also reads a set value B in accordance with the accelerator<br>
22<br><br>
operation speed acquired by the acceleration data acquisition<br>
means 71, from the map shown in FIG. 5 (B) . The rotational speed<br>
estimation means 73 then compares the set value A and the set<br>
value B, applies the larger one of the set values A, B to the<br>
map shown in FIG. 5 (C) , and reads the final engagement<br>
completion rotational speed as a set value from the drawing.<br>
The motor control means 74 includes an electricity supply<br>
restriction means 81 and a prerotation means 82 to be discussed<br>
later, and supplies the motor 13 with a magnitude of electricity<br>
in accordance with the accelerator operation amount after the<br>
accelerator grip 9 in an idling state is operated and the speed<br>
of the engine 12 has reached the engagement completion<br>
rotational speed.<br>
Whether or not the accelerator grip 9 is in an idling state<br>
is detected using the accelerator operation amount acquired by<br>
the acceleration data acquisition means 71. That is, the<br>
accelerator grip 9 is determined to be in an idling state if<br>
the accelerator operation amount is 0.<br>
Whether or not the accelerator grip 9 has been operated<br>
is detected by determining whether or not the accelerator<br>
operation amount has changed from 0.<br>
In supplying the motor 13 with a magnitude of electricity<br>
in accordance with the accelerator operation amount, the motor<br>
control means 74 reads a magnitude of driving current in<br>
accordance with the accelerator operation amount, from the map<br>
23<br><br>
shown in FIG. 6, and controls the voltage such that the magnitude<br>
of driving current flows through the motor 13. The motor<br>
control means 74 supplies the motor 13 with electricity only<br>
when the charge level of the battery 23 is above a minimum charge<br>
level to be discussed later.<br>
The electricity supply restriction means 81 restricts the<br>
length of time for the motor control means 74 to supply the motor<br>
13 with electricity, to a predetermined electricity supply time.<br>
The electricity supply time is set by an electricity supply time<br>
setting means 83 to be discussed later. That is, the<br>
electricity supply restriction means 81 continues the supply<br>
of electricity to the motor 13 for the electricity supply time,<br>
and discontinues the supply of electricity to the motor 13 after<br>
the electricity supply time has elapsed. The electricity<br>
supply time is counted by the timer 79.<br>
The electricity supply time setting means 83 changes the<br>
electricity supply time according to the charge level of the<br>
battery 23 detected by the charge level detection means 75 to<br>
be discussed later. In changing the electricity supply time,<br>
the electricity supply time setting means 83 uses the map shown<br>
in FIG. 7. FIG. 7 is a graph showing the driving time for a<br>
charge level of the battery 23 (battery SOC). As shown in the<br>
graph, the electricity supply time is set to be shorter as the<br>
charge level of the battery 23 becomes lower. The electricity<br>
supply time setting means 83 reads an electricity supply time<br>
24<br><br>
in accordance with the present charge level of the battery 23,<br>
from the map shown in FIG. 7, and sends the electricity supply<br>
time to the electricity supply restriction means 81. That is,<br>
the electricity supply restriction means 81 shortens the<br>
electricity supply time as the charge level detected by the<br>
electricity supply time setting means 83 becomes lower.<br>
The prerotation means 82 is intended to prevent the motor<br>
13 not generating auxiliary power from serving as a load on the<br>
engine 12, and arranged to start energization in order to rotate<br>
the motor 13 when the speed of the engine 12 has reached a<br>
predetermined prerotation speed. In this embodiment, the<br>
prerotation speed is set to be lower than the speed of the engine<br>
12 in an idling state (idling speed).<br>
That is, in the hybrid motorcycle 1 according to this<br>
embodiment, the prerotation means 82 rotates the motor 13 in<br>
conjunction with the rotation of the engine 12 after an engine<br>
start and when the engine speed has reached the prerotation<br>
speed lower than the idling speed. The speed of the engine 12<br>
is detected by the rotational speed detection means 72.<br>
The charge level detection means 75 obtains a charge level<br>
(SOC) of the battery 23 in accordance with the release voltage<br>
of the battery 23 using a map as the graph shown in FIG. 8, and<br>
then adds, to this charge level, the current amount while the<br>
battery 23 is charging and the current amount while the battery<br>
23 is discharging to obtain the present charge level.  The<br>
25<br><br>
battery release voltage is detected by the charge level<br>
detection means 75 while electricity in the battery 23 is not<br>
consumed or while the battery 23 is not charged, for example<br>
when the engine is stopped. The battery 23 is charged by the<br>
charging means 7 6 to be discussed later. The current while<br>
charging and the current while the battery 23 is discharging<br>
are measured by a current detector 84 (see FIG. 3) provided in<br>
the circuit connecting the battery 23 and the motor/generator<br>
control section 62.<br>
Instead of measuring and adding the charge current and the<br>
discharge current each time as discussed above, a map as shown<br>
in FIG. 9 may be used to detect the charge level of the battery<br>
23 during engine operation. In the map shown in FIG. 9, the<br>
charge level (SOC) of the battery 23 is defined by the battery<br>
current and the battery voltage. The map shows the relation<br>
between the voltage between the terminals of the battery 23 and<br>
the current flowing through the battery 23 at each charge level<br>
from 0% to 100%. In the case of using this map to obtain the<br>
charge level of the battery 23, the charge level detection means<br>
75 detects the present values of the current flowing through<br>
the battery 23 and the voltage between the terminals of the<br>
battery 23, and reads a charge level (SOC) in accordance with<br>
these current and voltage values from the map.<br>
The charging means 76 causes the motor 13 to function as<br>
a generator and to generate electricity after the above<br>
26<br><br>
electricity supply time has elapsed, and charges the battery<br>
23 with the generated electricity. The charging means 76 also<br>
changes the amount of electricity to be generated according to<br>
the charge level detected by the charge level detection means<br>
75. That is, the charging means 76 reduces the charge current<br>
when the charge level of the battery 23 is relatively high, and<br>
increases the charge current when the charge level of the<br>
battery 23 is relatively low.<br>
The charge level determination means 77 compares the charge<br>
level of the battery 23 detected by the charge level detection<br>
means 75 and the predetermined minimum charge level if auxiliary<br>
power is not generated by the driving of the motor 13. The<br>
charge level determination means 77 also sends a control signal<br>
to the prerotation means 82 to discontinue the supply of<br>
electricity to the motor 13, and sends a control signal to the<br>
precharging means 78 to be discussed later to start charging,<br>
when the charge level of the battery 23 is lower than the minimum<br>
charge level. On receiving the control signal, the prerotation<br>
means 82 stops the supply of electricity to the motor 13.<br>
When the control signal is sent from the charge level<br>
determination means 77, the precharging means 77 causes the<br>
motor 13 to function as a generator and to generate electricity<br>
if auxiliary power is not generated by the driving of the motor<br>
13. The charge current while generating electricity is read<br>
from the map shown in FIG. 10 and set. The map shows the charge<br>
27<br><br>
current and the discharge current of the battery 23 for a charge<br>
level (SOC) of the battery 23.<br>
As can be understood from this map, the precharging means<br>
78 according to this embodiment increases the charge current<br>
as the charge level of the battery 23 becomes lower when the<br>
charge level is between the minimum charge level Cl and a limit<br>
value C2 lower than that. Also, the precharging means 78<br>
performs charging at a constant maximum charge current when the<br>
charge level is lower than the limit value C2. When the motor<br>
13 is caused to function as a generator while the engine 12 in<br>
low-speed operation, the engine control section 34 of the hybrid<br>
motorcycle 1 increases the fuel injection amount from the<br>
injector 35 so as to stabilize the rotation of the engine 12.<br>
At this time, for example when the accelerator grip 9 is<br>
in an idling position, the fuel injection amount is controlled<br>
such that the engine speed reaches the idling speed during<br>
normal operation. When the accelerator operation amount is<br>
increased from the idling state, the engine control section 34<br>
increases the fuel injection amount according to the increase<br>
in accelerator operation amount. Thus, since the fuel<br>
injection amount is increased according to an increase in load<br>
due to electricity generation by the motor 13, the engine 12<br>
can be prevented from stalling because of such an increase in<br>
load due to electricity generation.<br>
Now, a description will be made of the operation of the<br>
28<br><br>
motor/generator control section 62 constructed as described<br>
above using the flowcharts shown in FIGs. 11 and 12 and the time<br>
chart shown in FIG. 13.<br>
The engine 12 is started by turning ON the main switch 21<br>
and then turning ON the start switch 22 in steps Pi to P3 of<br>
the flowchart shown in FIG. 11.<br>
The timing of turning ON the main switch 21 is indicated<br>
as time Tl in FIG. 13, and the timing of turning ON the start<br>
switch 22 is indicated as time T2 in FIG. 13.<br>
After an engine start, the acceleration data acquisition<br>
means 71 acquires acceleration data (accelerator operation<br>
amount and accelerator operation speed) in step P4, and the<br>
charge level determination means 77 determines in step P5<br>
whether or not the charge level of the battery 23 is lower than<br>
the minimum charge amount.<br>
If the charge level of the battery 23 is equal to minimum<br>
charge level or lower, the precharging means 7 8 reads a charge<br>
current for the motor 13 from the map shown in FIG. 10 in step<br>
P6, and causes the motor 13 to function as a generator and to<br>
generate electricity so as to obtain the charge current in step<br>
P7. Then, the process returns to step P4 to repeat the above<br>
processes. The timing at which electricity generation is<br>
started in step P7 is indicated as time T3 in FIG. 13.<br>
On the other hand, if it is determined in step P5 that the<br>
charge level of the battery 23 is higher than the minimum charge<br>
29<br><br>
level, the process proceeds to step P8, where the driving<br>
current for the motor 13 is set. Here, the operation performed<br>
in step P8 is described with reference to the flowchart shown<br>
in FIG. 12.<br>
First of all, the speed of the engine 12 is detected in<br>
step SI of the flowchart shown in FIG. 12, and energization is<br>
started to rotate the motor 13 when the engine speed has reached<br>
the prerotation speed as shown in steps S2 to S3. The<br>
prerotation speed is indicated as symbol R in FIG. 13. Also,<br>
the timing at which the motor 13 rotates in conjunction with<br>
the rotation of the engine 12 is indicated as time T4 in FIG.<br>
13.<br>
Subsequently, acceleration data are acquired again in step<br>
S4, and it is determined in step S5 whether or not an accelerator<br>
operation has been performed. If an accelerator operation has<br>
not been performed, the process returns to step S1. If an<br>
accelerator operation has been performed, a set value A (first<br>
rotational speed) in accordance with the accelerator operation<br>
amount at that time is read from the map shown in FIG. 5 (A) in<br>
step S6, and a set value B (second rotational speed) in<br>
accordance with the accelerator operation speed at that time<br>
is read from the map shown in FIG. 5(B) in step S7. The timing<br>
at which the accelerator operation has been performed is<br>
indicated as time T5 in FIG. 13.<br>
Then, in step S8, based on the larger one of the set value<br>
30<br><br>
A and the set value B (the one that brings about a higher<br>
rotational speed), the final engagement completion rotational<br>
speed is read as a set value from the map shown in FIG. 5(C).<br>
After the engagement completion rotational speed is<br>
estimated in this way, it is determined in step S9 whether or<br>
not the speed of the engine 12 has reached the engagement<br>
completion rotational speed. If the speed of the engine 12 has<br>
not reached the engagement completion rotational speed, the<br>
process returns to step S4. After the speed of the engine 12<br>
has reached the engagement completion rotational speed, the<br>
driving current for the motor 13 is read from the map shown in<br>
FIG. 6 in step S10, and the electricity supply time is read from<br>
the map shown in FIG. 7 in step Sll. The electricity supply<br>
time becomes shorter as the charge level of the battery 23<br>
becomes lower.<br>
After preparations have been made to cause the motor 13<br>
to generate auxiliary power, the driving current is passed to<br>
the motor 13 to generate auxiliary power by the driving of the<br>
motor 13 in step P9 of the flowchart shown in FIG. 11. The timing<br>
of generating auxiliary power is indicated as time T6 in FIG.<br>
13. At this time, the timer 7 9 starts counting the time.<br>
At this time, the speed of the engine 12 has increased to<br>
the engagement completion rotational speed since the start of<br>
the accelerator operation (T5), and the automatic centrifugal<br>
clutch 16 has completely been engaged.  Thus, the resultant<br>
31<br><br>
force of the power from the engine 12 and the auxiliary power<br>
from the motor 13 is transmitted from the automatic centrifugal<br>
clutch 16 via the gear-type speed reducer 18 and the axle 17<br>
to the rear wheel 5.<br>
As a result, the acceleration at which this vehicle starts<br>
running is large compared to common motorcycles that run only<br>
on the power from the engine 12. Meanwhile, if the charge level<br>
of the battery 23 is lower than the minimum charge level, the<br>
electricity generation amount is increased from an electricity<br>
generation amount for idling L to an electricity generation<br>
amount for running H after the speed of the engine 12 has reached<br>
the engagement completion rotational speed, as shown in FIG.<br>
13.<br>
After auxiliary power is generated by the driving of the<br>
motor 13 as discussed above, it is determined in step P10 whether<br>
or not the electricity supply time has elapsed from the start<br>
of the driving of the motor 13. If the electricity supply time<br>
has not elapsed, the process returns to step P9. If the<br>
electricity supply time has elapsed, the supply of electricity<br>
to the motor 13 is discontinued in step Pll. The timing of<br>
stopping the supply of electricity is indicated as time T7 in<br>
FIG. 13.<br>
After the supply of electricity to the motor 13 is<br>
discontinued, the motor 13 is caused to function as a generator<br>
and to generate electricity in steps P6, P7.  The timing of<br>
32<br><br>
starting the generation of electricity is indicated as time T8<br>
in FIG. 13. The amount of electricity generated at this time<br>
is also increased and decreased according to the charge level<br>
of the battery 23.<br>
Aside from when the vehicle starts running as discussed<br>
above, the motor 13 is also caused to generate auxiliary power<br>
for example when the accelerator grip 9 is returned to an idling<br>
position while the vehicle is running and then operated to<br>
increase the running speed from a coasting state. Thus, also<br>
at this time, the automatic centrifugal clutch 16 does not slip<br>
and high acceleration performance can be achieved by the<br>
auxiliary power by the driving of the motor 13.<br>
In the operation example shown in FIG. 13, the operation<br>
amount of the accelerator grip 9 is continuously increased from<br>
the start of the operation until the vehicle starts running.<br>
In the case where the accelerator is operated irregularly, an<br>
operation similar to the above example where only the engagement<br>
completion rotational speed is different is performed. For<br>
example, in the case where the accelerator grip 9 is once<br>
reversed slightly at the middle of the starting operation and<br>
then the starting operation is performed again, the operation<br>
as shown in FIG. 14 is performed.<br>
In FIG. 14, the timing of starting the reversing operation<br>
of the accelerator grip 9 at the middle of the starting operation<br>
is indicated as time T10, and the timing at which the accelerator<br>
33<br><br>
grip 9 is completely reversed and the starting operation is<br>
started again is indicated as time T11.<br>
As shown in FIG. 14, the estimated value, which represents<br>
the engagement completion rotational speed, is reduced by<br>
reversing the accelerator grip 9, and increased by operating<br>
the accelerator grip 9 again. Also in this case, the motor 13<br>
is caused to generate auxiliary power when the speed of the<br>
engine 12 has reached the engagement completion rotational<br>
speed (T6) after the start of the accelerator operation (T5).<br>
In the hybrid motorcycle 1 constructed as described above,<br>
the auxiliary power from the motor 13 is applied to the automatic<br>
centrifugal clutch 16 with the automatic centrifugal clutch 16<br>
completely engaged. Thus, the resultant force of the power from<br>
the engine 12 and the auxiliary power from the motor 13 can be<br>
efficiently transmitted from the automatic centrifugal clutch<br>
16 to the rear wheel 5 side without any loss of power in the<br>
automatic centrifugal clutch 16.<br>
Therefore, according to this embodiment, a hybrid<br>
motorcycle 1 with excellent start and acceleration performance<br>
can be manufactured.<br>
Also, in this embodiment, an existing APS 11 for use to<br>
control the rotation of the engine 12 is used to detect the<br>
operation amount and the operation speed of the accelerator grip<br>
9. Thus, it is not necessary to provide a new member for<br>
detection purposes, such as sensor or switch, in order to<br>
34<br><br>
manufacture the hybrid motorcycle 1, which contributes to cost<br>
reduction.<br>
In the hybrid motorcycle 1 according to this embodiment,<br>
a sensor or a switch for detecting the completion of engagement<br>
of the automatic centrifugal clutch 16 is not exclusively used.<br>
Thus, according to the hybrid motorcycle 1, the operation to<br>
apply auxiliary power can be performed with high reliability<br>
compared to the case where a dedicated sensor or switch is used<br>
to detect the completion of engagement of the automatic<br>
centrifugal clutch.<br>
In the hybrid motorcycle 1 according to this embodiment,<br>
the supply of electricity to the motor 13 is discontinued after<br>
the vehicle starts running or accelerates and when a<br>
predetermined electricity supply time has elapsed. Thus, the<br>
consumption of electricity in the battery 23 can be reduced<br>
compared to the case where the supply of electricity to the motor<br>
13 is continued after the vehicle starts running or accelerates .<br>
In the hybrid motorcycle 1 according to this embodiment,<br>
the electricity supply time becomes shorter as the charge level<br>
of the battery 23 becomes lower. Thus, the charge level of the<br>
battery 23 is not lowered excessively. Therefore, according<br>
to the hybrid motorcycle 1, it is possible to secure electricity<br>
for use to cause the motor 13 to generate auxiliary power next<br>
time.<br>
In the hybrid motorcycle 1 according to this embodiment,<br>
35<br><br>
the motor 13 generates electricity after the electricity supply<br>
time has elapsed, and the battery 23 is charged with the<br>
generated electricity In this way, according to the hybrid<br>
motorcycle 1, the battery 23 can be charged after electricity<br>
in the battery 23 has been consumed. Thus, it is possible to<br>
secure sufficient electricity to be supplied to the motor 13<br>
next time.<br>
The hybrid motorcycle 1 according to this embodiment is<br>
arranged to use a higher one of the first rotational speed<br>
obtained based on the accelerator operation amount and the<br>
second rotational speed obtained based on the accelerator<br>
operation speed. Thus, according to the hybrid motorcycle 1,<br>
the power from the motor 13 can be applied to the automatic<br>
centrifugal clutch 16 at an appropriate timing in accordance<br>
with the accelerator operation speed, even if the accelerator<br>
grip 9 is operated to fully open the throttle valve 32 in order<br>
for the vehicle to start running or accelerate. As a result,<br>
in the hybrid motorcycle 1, the power from the engine 12 and<br>
the auxiliary power from the motor 13 can be more reliably<br>
transmitted to the rear wheel 5.<br>
The hybrid motorcycle 1 according to this embodiment is<br>
arranged to rotate the motor 13 in conjunction with the rotation<br>
of the engine 12 after an engine start and in an operating state<br>
where the power from the motor 13 is not applied to the crankshaft<br>
36. Thus, according to the hybrid motorcycle 1, it is possible<br>
36<br><br>
to prevent the motor 13 not generating auxiliary power from<br>
serving as a load on the engine 12, which stabilizes the rotation<br>
of the engine 12 in an idling state.<br>
In the hybrid motorcycle 1 according to this embodiment,<br>
the motor 13 is rotated after the start of the engine 12 and<br>
before the speed of the engine 12 reaches an idling speed, which<br>
reduces a load on the engine 12. Thus, the engine 12 shifts<br>
to an idling state while rotating stably after an engine start,<br>
even if the motor 13 is connected to the crankshaft 36. As a<br>
result, according to the hybrid motorcycle 1, the series of<br>
operations, including starting the engine 12 and the vehicle<br>
starting running and accelerating, can be performed smoothly.<br>
In the hybrid motorcycle 1 according to this embodiment,<br>
if the charge level of the battery 23 is low, the battery 23<br>
can be charged when auxiliary power from the motor 13 is not<br>
necessary, for example when the vehicle is at a halt. Thus,<br>
according to the hybrid motorcycle 1, the battery 23 can be<br>
prevented from being over-discharged, and it is possible to<br>
secure electricity for use to cause the motor 13 to generate<br>
auxiliary power next time.<br>
In the above embodiment, the rotor 38 of the motor 13 is<br>
mounted on the crankshaft 36. However, the motor 13 may be<br>
formed separately from the engine 12 . In such a case, the rotary<br>
shaft of the motor 13 and the crankshaft 36 may be connected<br>
directly or via a transmission means that can maintain the ratio<br>
37<br><br>
between the speeds of both the shafts to a constant value.<br>
In the above embodiment, both the accelerator operation<br>
amount and the accelerator operation speed are used to set the<br>
engagement completion rotational speed. However, only the<br>
accelerator operation amount may be used to set the engagement<br>
completion rotational speed. Also, in the above embodiment,<br>
the driving current supplied to the motor 13 in order to cause<br>
the motor 13 to generate auxiliary power is increased and<br>
decreased in proportion to the accelerator operation amount.<br>
However, the driving current may be increased and decreased in<br>
consideration of the accelerator operation speed as well.<br>
In the above embodiment, the present invention is applied<br>
to a scooter. However, the present invention is not limited<br>
thereto, and may be applied to other types of motorcycle.<br>
