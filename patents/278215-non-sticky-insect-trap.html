				<td>3.   The following specification (particularly) describes the nature of invention and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed<br>
The present invention relates to a Non-sticky Insect Trap invented for monitoring or mass<br>
trapping of the population of flying insects in the field.<br>
Modern pest management cannot operate without accurate estimates of pest<br>
and natural enemies' population densities or without reliable assessments of plant<br>
damage and its effect on yield. Acquiring quantitative information about the<br>
agroecosystem is a preliminary phase of any basic or applied work on insect-plant<br>
interactions. A vast array of different techniques and tools are used to monitor the<br>
population of insects in the fields viz., the hand net or butterfly net, light trap, pheromone<br>
traps, yellow sticky traps and the alike.<br>
The hand net is just like a badminton racket in which the gut is replaced by<br>
the mosquito net. The flying insect is targeted to trap in it. Some of the insects of the<br>
plant canopy get trapped which are later collected in a jar and studied.<br>
The shortcoming of this hand net is that the insects active at the time of<br>
collection are only trapped. Different types of insects are active at different periods of<br>
times. Therefore, it can't give true picture of the population of insect in the field.<br>
The insect light trap is kept in the field during night to target phototropic<br>
insects which are attracted towards it and hover around the source of light. Just below the<br>
light source is positioned a funnel. The hovering insects fall into this funnel and get<br>
trapped.<br>
The limitation of this light trap is that it traps only the phototropic insects.<br>
Therefore, it can't work for other kind of flying insects.<br>
The sex pheromone traps are based upon the chemical lures. The adult male<br>
insects are attracted towards the septa having the scent of the female of that species and<br>
got trapped in the funnel which is kept beneath these septa. The limitation of this type of<br>
trap is that the sex pheromone lures are known only for a few insect species. Moreover,<br>
the chemical lure varies from one insect species to another. Hence, only the population of<br>
a particular insect species can be trapped whose lure is known to the science and is<br>
available in the market.<br>
The yellow sticky trap is used to trap some specific type of insects which are<br>
attracted towards yellow colour. The yellow colour sheet is smeared with a sticky<br>
substance and installed in the field. The insect attracted towards the yellow colour and<br>
trapped in the sticky material pasted on the sheet. The limitation of this type of trap is that<br>
one has to replace the sticky material and the yellow coloured sheet frequently because it<br>
becomes non-functional due to adherence of soil particles (particularly during dust storms);<br>
adherence of insects on it and occupy the surface on it which results the scarcity of the<br>
sticky surface area for the subsequent insect population for adherence on it and washing<br>
and destruction of sticky surface with rains, crop straws etc. in the field. These<br>
shortcomings have been well overcome in this newly designed trap.<br>
The present invention comprises of a barrel shaped structure. All around the<br>
surface, it contains split walls which move inwards in a tapering fashion and stops near<br>
the meeting end to facilitate an aperture. The top portion of this structure is enclosed with<br>
a lid. The inner portion of the lid is provided with obstructive baffles and this extends up<br>
to the rear end of the structure. The bottom surface of this barrel shaped upright contains<br>
a funnel. The funnel's narrow aperture ends in a detachable container. The whole barrel<br>
shaped structure is painted with colour.<br>
The flying insects get hit by the baffles and fall into it which get collected in the<br>
detachable container through the funnel.<br>
The entire structure is firmly fixed in telescopic rod. The telescopic rod is rigidly<br>
fixed to the ground. The above arrangement holds the barrel shaped structure vertically in<br>
the field. The flying insects (such as aphids and the alike) enter into the sac through the<br>
narrow aperture of the structure and get trapped.<br>
Prior Art<br>
The insect pests cause enormous losses to the crops under field conditions.<br>
Mostly the synthetic chemical pesticides are applied to control them. The injudicious use<br>
of these chemical pesticides has led to several side effects. Residues of the chemical<br>
pesticides in foodgrains, fruits and vegetables, fish, milk, water and soil have often been<br>
reported to exceed their acceptance limits (Dhaliwal and Kalra, 1977; Kalra and Chawla,<br>
1981). Modern pest management cannot operate without accurate estimates of pest and<br>
natural enemies' population densities or without reliable assessments of plant damage<br>
and its effect on yield. The importance of understanding insect activity to make decisions<br>
in insect pest management cannot be overstated. Indeed, this knowledge is indispensable<br>
to the paramount principle of pest management: to take no action against a pest unless<br>
that pest is known to be present and is an acute or potential threat.<br>
A few tools are available to monitor the population of insects in the fields<br>
viz., the hand net or butterfly net, light trap, pheromone traps, yellow sticky traps and the<br>
alike.<br>
Among these insect sampling tools, the sticky traps hold an important<br>
position. The sticky traps are generally used for catching the aerial insect population.<br>
Generally smaller sized insects like hoppers, white flies, aphids are trapped in these<br>
models. The sticky materials used include castor oil, Vaseline, grease etc. The sticky trap<br>
models include simple rectangular galvanized sheets, plastic jars or tin boxes, cylindrical<br>
tubes etc. over which the sticky adhesive material is applied. Generally different colours<br>
are painted on the trap depending upon the preference by various insects to colours and<br>
used as coloured sticky traps. White coloured traps are most effective in attracting the<br>
pigeon pea fly, Melanagromyza obtuse; yellow colour attract cotton white fly, Bemisia<br>
tabaci; cotton aphids, Aphis gossypi G. and green house white fly Trialeurodes<br>
vaporariorum (Bhatnager and Davies, 1979 and Gillespie and Quiring, 1987). Most traps<br>
are set in the field, left unattended for a period of time and then visited to pick up the<br>
catch. They are often operated continuously, integrating time, insect density, and insect<br>
activity to produce the numbers collected.<br>
These sticky traps have a number of limitations like: one has to replace the<br>
sticky materials and the coloured sheet frequently because it becomes non-functional due<br>
to adherence of soil particles (particularly during dust storms); adherence of insects on it<br>
and occupy the surface on it which results the scarcity of the sticky surface area for the<br>
subsequent insect population for adherence on it and washing and destruction of sticky<br>
surface with rains, crop straws etc. in the field. The rains may also cause loss of collected<br>
specimens due to runoff. It is also difficult to identify and count the tiny insects adhered<br>
on these sticky traps as separating the tiny insects from the sticky surface is difficult<br>
process.<br>
These shortcomings have been well overcome in this newly invented non-sticky<br>
insect trap.<br>
The present invention comprises a barrel shaped structure. All around the surface,<br>
it contains split walls which move inwards in a tapering fashion and stops near the<br>
meeting end to facilitate an aperture. The top portion of this structure is enclosed with a<br>
lid. The inner portion of the lid is provided with obstructive baffles and this extends up to<br>
the rear end of the structure. The bottom surface of this barrel shaped structure contains a<br>
funnel. The funnel's narrow aperture ends in a detachable container. The whole structure<br>
is painted with colour.<br>
The flying insects get hit by the baffles and fall into it which get collected in the<br>
detachable container through the funnel.<br>
The entire structure is firmly fixed in telescopic rod. The telescopic rod is rigidly<br>
fixed to the ground. The above arrangement holds the structure vertically in the field. The<br>
flying insects (such as aphids and the alike) enter into the sac through the narrow aperture<br>
of the structure and get trapped.<br>
Objective of the Invention<br>
The present invention - non-sticky insect trap is to monitor the population of<br>
flying insects in the field. The accurate estimates of pest and natural enemies' population<br>
densities in the fields are needed to understand insect activity to take good insect pest<br>
management decisions at right time. Indeed, this knowledge is indispensable to the<br>
paramount principle of pest management: to take no action against a pest unless that pest<br>
is known to be present and is an acute or potential threat. It may also be used for mass<br>
trapping of insects in the fields.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, non-sticky insect trap comprises of two parts: the barrel shaped<br>
structure 1 and the telescopic rod 2.<br>
The all around surface of the barrel shaped structure contains split walls 3 which<br>
move inwards in a tapering fashion and stops near the meeting end to facilitate an<br>
aperture 4. The top portion of this structure is enclosed with a lid 5. The inner portion of<br>
the lid is provided with obstructive baffles 6 and this extends up to the rear end of the<br>
structure. The bottom surface of this barrel shaped structure contains a funnel 7. The<br>
funnel's narrow aperture ends in a detachable container 8. The whole barrel shaped<br>
structure is painted with colour.<br>
The physical stimulus (colour painted on the barrel shaped structure) lure the<br>
flying insects particularly which are responding to the colour such as aphids and the<br>
alike towards it and these insects 9 get hit by the baffles and fall into it which get<br>
collected in the detachable container.<br>
The telescopic rod consists of first pipe 10, the lower end of which is sharp<br>
elongated cone shaped 11. This cone shape of the lower end helps implanting the whole<br>
stricture in the ground. There is second pipe 12, which can move freely inside the first<br>
pipe. The outer diameter of the inner pipe is slightly less than the inner diameter of outer<br>
pipe. The first pipe is provided with paired holes 13. The second pipe is also provided<br>
with several paired holes 14. By aligning the paired holes of outer pipe with any of the<br>
paired holes of inner pipe, the peg 15 is inserted in the holes. The vertical movement of<br>
these two pipes and the series of paired holes in the inner pipe provide for the adjustment<br>
of the height of the barrel shaped structure. The trap may be installed in the field<br>
wherever one would like to monitor or trap the insects.<br>
The telescopic rod is firmly fixed in barrel shaped structure through the<br>
provision provided in it. The telescopic rod is rigidly fixed to the ground. The above<br>
arrangement holds the structure vertically in the field. The flying insects (such as aphids<br>
and the alike) enter into the detachable container through the funnel of the structure and<br>
get trapped.<br>
The height of the trap can be increased or decreased as per the requirement by<br>
just increasing or decreasing the height of the pole inside the telescopic rod.<br>
The precise advantages of this invention are:<br>
(i)       It can be used to monitor or mass trap the population of flying insects in the<br>
field. The accurate estimates of pest and natural enemies' population densities<br>
in the crop fields is needed to understand insect activity to take good insect pest<br>
management decisions at right time,<br>
(ii)       It can work in the fields during and after harsh weather conditions. Hence,<br>
frequent replacement of the trap is not required,<br>
(iii)      Collection of insects from it for insect identification, counting purposes is very<br>
comfortable,<br>
(iv)      It can be painted with any desirable colour as per the need,<br>
(v)       It is durable and may be used year after year,<br>
(vi)      It provides valuable information on the insect population fluctuations and their<br>
peak period of activities,<br>
(vii)     The height of the trap can be increased or decreased as per the requirement by<br>
doing adjustment in the telescopic rod.<br>
