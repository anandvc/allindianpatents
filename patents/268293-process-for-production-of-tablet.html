				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF TABLET<br>
Technical Field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for producing a tablet used as a pharmaceutical product, health food, or the like.<br>
Background Art [0002]<br>
In the fields of pharmaceutical products or health foods, it is preferred to provide a product in a form of tablet for its easiness of administration.  Generally, a tablet is provided as a film-coated tablet or a sugar-coated tablet to ensure stability of an active ingredient, to attain good appearance, or to achieve even easier administration with addition of sweet flavor.<br>
However, in preparation of either form of tablet, a plain tablet (an uncoated tablet) is coated with a coating agent which has been dissolved or suspended in a solvent in advance.  Thus, the above-described coating could not be applied to a medicinal agent unstable to water or a solvent.<br><br>
In this circumstance a dry coating method was developed in which a coating agent was applied to a tablet as it was in a solid form, not in a liquid form. [0003]<br>
As a previously reported dry coating method for a tablet, for example, a method using a tableting machine for compression coated tablets (tablet within a tablet, dry coated tablet) is known.  The method is characterized by compression-coating a core tablet with powder containing a fatty, waxy substance or a thermoplastic<br>
substance which melts or softens at 40°C or higher, and further heating a coated tablet (Patent Document 1). However, the above-described method requires a special tableting machine for compression coated tablets. Also, disintegration time tends to become longer because a relatively large volume of a coating agent needs to be used to completely coat a tablet so as to prevent exposure of a core tablet. [0004]<br>
Another dry coating method has been reported in which a plain tablet is spray-coated with a finely powdered enteric polymer such as<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate, while the tablet is sprayed with a plasticizing liquid such as triethyl citrate (Patent Document 2). However, a film of the enteric polymer formed by the above-described dry coating<br><br>
method is aimed to prevent water in a sugar-coating suspension from entering, the center core tablet and it is not intended to be used as the outermost layer of a finished product.  It is necessary to form a sugar-coating layer over the film in order to attain properties such as an appearance and resistance to breaking or cracking necessary for a tablet. [0005]<br>
Furthermore, a dry coating method used for a granule having an average particle size of approximately from 50 to 2000 urn, preferably approximately from 100 to 1500 urn, is described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 4-290817 (Patent Document 3).  In this method a granule preheated<br>
to 65°C which contains a principal agent is contacted and coated with a powder mixture containing an enteric substance and a meltable substance, followed by cooling to the melting point of the meltable substance or lower. In this document, examples of the meltable substance include higher fatty acids, higher aliphatic alcohols, higher fatty acid esters, and hydroxy higher fatty acid esters.  It is further described in paragraph 14 of the document that these meltable substances can be used concomitantly with a water-soluble meltable substance such as polyethylene glycol. [0006]<br><br>
However, a dry-coating technique which is able to coat a tablet, which has a larger surface area as compared to a granule, giving it good appearance in a simple manner with high efficiency, while forming a surface hardly causing breaking or cracking has not been found up until now. [0007]<br>

The process for producing the tablet according to the present invention enables coating of a tablet in a simple manner in a short period of time, the coating of the tablet thus produced has beautiful appearance comparable to that of a sugar-coated tablet and favorable physical properties of, for example, disintegration and resistance to a drop impact.  Further, a production cost can be reduced according to the process of the present invention.  Furthermore, the process enables thin and uniform coating; therefore, an effect of masking a unique property and a taste of the plain tablet can be obtained, while the tablet is prevented to become larger in size and calories from the coating agent can be suppressed. Moreover, the process enables coating of a tablet containing an ingredient which decomposes when coexisting with water or a solvent because the process does not require a solvent during a process of production.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention [0011]<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention are described in detail hereinbelow.<br><br>
In the process for producing a coated tablet according to the present invention, a plain tablet produced in a conventional manner is heated to a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point of a meltable substance contained in a coating agent.  For example, a large quantity of plain tablet can be uniformly heated by pouring the plain tablet into a coating pan or an automated coating machine and heating the tablet while rotating the pan. [0012]<br>
Next, the heated plain tablet is contacted with the coating agent containing the meltable substance for coating.  For example, this step is conducted by pouring the coating agent into the coating machine either while the pan containing the plain tablet is rotated or while rotation is interrupted, then further rotating the pan. The meltable substance contained in the coating agent melts when the heated plain tablet contacts with the coating agent, and the coating agent favorably attaches to the surface area of the plain tablet. At this point, a uniformly coated tablet with no unevenness can be obtained by conducting the coating in a gradual manner by changing the coating agent normally in 2 to 50 portions, preferably in 3 to 30 portions, more preferably in 5 to 15 portions. [0013]<br><br>
Subsequently, a tablet having a beautiful appearance with an increased surface luster is obtained by cooling the tablet until the temperature thereof is lowered to approximately equal to the room temperature, while rotating the pan of the coating machine. [0014]<br>
The meltable substance used in the present invention means a substance which is solid at normal temperature and has a melting point at room temperature or higher. The melting point of the meltable substance is preferably<br>
from 30°C to 100°C, more preferably from 50°C to 70°C. Examples of the meltable substance include, but are not limited to, a higher saturated alcohol having a carbon number of 14 or more, a higher saturated fatty acid having a carbon number of 10 or more, a waxy substance, a polymer substance, and the like. [0015]<br>
Examples of the higher saturated alcohol include myristyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, and the like. [0016]<br>
Examples of the higher fatty acid include capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, and the like. [0017]<br><br>
Examples of the waxy substance include bees wax, whale wax, Japan wax, carnauba wax, cacao butter, beef tallow, lard, lanolin, vaseline, paraffin, and the like. [0018]<br>
Examples of the polymer substance include polyethylene glycol, which preferably has an average molecular weight of from 1000 to 50000, more preferably from 4000 to approximately 20000, in view of its melting point. [0019]<br>
The coating agent of the present invention can contain only one kind or more than two kinds of the meltable substance as described above. [0020]<br>
The content of the meltable substance in the coating agent is preferably from 10% to 60%, more preferably from 10% to 50%. [0021]<br>
Plural kinds of coating agent having different contents of the meltable substance can be prepared and contacted with the plain tablet in a sequential manner. [0022]<br>
Various kinds of substance can be added to the coating agent used in the present invention in addition to the aforementioned meltable substance as long as they can be employed as a coating agent of a tablet. A<br><br>
substance to be added to the coating agent can be sugars such as sucrose, lactose, mannitol, erythritol, maltitol, xylitol, inorganic substances such as talc, calcium hydrogen phosphate, titanium oxide, magnesium stearate, calcium carbonate, celluloses such as hydroxyethy1cellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, crystalline cellulose, acryl acid-based polymers such as methacrylate copolymer, methacrylate/butyl acrylate copolymer, methacrylate/ethyl acrylate copolymer, ethyl acrylate/methyl methacrylate copolymer, aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer, pigments, and the like. [0023]<br>
The coating agent is preferably in a form of powder when poured into the pan of the coating machine.  The coating powder can be produced by a conventional manner using the aforementioned ingredient. A uniform coating powder can be produced after appropriately mixing plural kinds of the aforementioned ingredient. Alternatively, two or more kinds of different coating powder, each containing any of the aforementioned ingredients, can be produced in advance and poured into the pan simultaneously or sequentially. When using two or more kinds of coating powder, the content of the meltable substance accounts for preferably 10% to 60% based on the total weight of all the coating powder poured into the<br><br>
pan.  Plural kinds of coating powder containing the meltable substance at various rates can be prepared and poured into the pan in a sequential manner. [0024]<br>
A plain tablet used in the present invention can be any one produced by a known method, and no particular limitation is imposed thereon.  Generally, an appropriate additive is mixed to the plain tablet in addition to an active ingredient upon tableting. [0025]<br>

Examples [0041]<br>
The present invention is described further in detail with examples hereinbelow; however, it should not be construed that the present invention is limited to these examples. [0042] [Example 1]<br>
Using a tumbler mixer (model: WP-50, Tokuju Corporation), 6000 g of lactose, 3000 g of crystalline cellulose (CEOLUS 101, Asahi Kasei Corporation), 980 g of corn starch and 20 g of calcium stearate were mixed.  The obtained powder mixture was then tableted using a rotary tablet press (model: AP-15SS, Hata Iron Works Co., Ltd.) with a mortar having a diameter of 7.5 mm so that each tablet had a weight of 160 mg, thereby plain tablets were obtained.<br>
Then, polyethylene glycol 6000 (MACROGOL 6000, Sanyo Chemical Industries, Ltd., which will be hereinafter expressed as PEG 6000) and talc were mixed at a weight<br><br>
ratio of 5:5, 4:6, 3:7, 2:8, and 1:9 to give coating powder.<br>
Coating of 7000 g of the plain tablets was conducted using a coating machine (model: Hicoater HC-MULTI, Freund Corporation) with the coating powder.  The tablets were poured into the pan of the coating machine, followed by heating (inlet air temperature: 80°C) .  It was controlled so that the temperature of the tablets was 62°C to 65°C as the melting point of PEG 6000 was 60°C to 62°C.<br>
The coating powder was then poured into the coating machine.  The five kinds of coating powder mixtures obtained as above were sequentially poured into the pan, 140 g each, in descending order of the content of PEG 6000. After 140 g of the coating powder having a mixing ratio of 1:9 was poured, coating was continued with the coating powder until the amount of coating reached 20% by weight of the plain tablets. Subsequently, the tablets were cooled until the temperature thereof was lowered to approximately equal to the room temperature, while rotation of the pan of the coating machine was continued.<br>
[0043]<br>
[Example 2]<br>
In a similar manner to Example 1, 7000 g of the plain tablets were produced and similarly heated using the coating machine (model: HC-MULTI, Freund Corporation). The coating machine was charged with 70 g of PEG 6000,<br><br>
and 70 g of talc was poured thereto after PEG melted. Coating was then conducted by pouring PEG and talc alternately so that the weight ratio of PEG to talc was 4:6, 3:7, and 2:8, where the total amount of input was 140 g each time.  Thereafter, PEG and talc were alternately poured so that the weight ratio of PEG to talc was 1:9, where the total amount of input was 140 g, and coating was continued until the amount of coating reached 20% by weight of the plain tablets.  The tablets were then cooled. [0044]<br>
[Comparative Example 1] Film-coated tablet<br>
In 13500 g of purified water, 840 g of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and 180 g of PEG 6000 were dissolved.  Then, 240 g of talc and 240 g of titanium oxide were uniformly dispersed therein using a homomixer, thereby a film-coating suspension was prepared.  The film-coating suspension thus prepared was sprayed to 7000 g of the plain tablets produced in a similar manner to Example 1 in the Hicoater, thereby film-coated tablets each having 20 mg of film layer were obtained. [Comparative Example 2] Sugar-coated tablet<br>
In 3520 g of purified water, 800 g of gum arabic powder, 2540 g of precipitated calcium carbonate, 2020 g<br><br>
of talc, 240 g of titanium oxide, and 6880 g of purified sucrose were dissolved or dispersed, thereby subcoating suspension was prepared.  In 3580 g of purified water, 420 g of titanium oxide, 100 g of gum arabic, and 6700 g of purified sucrose were dissolved or dispersed, thereby color coating suspension was obtained.  In the Hicoater 7000 g of the plain tablets produced in a similar manner to Example 1 were coated with the sugar-coating liquid thus prepared, thereby a sugar-coated tablets each having 85 mg of a subcoating layer and 35 mg of a color coating layer were obtained.<br>
[0045]<br><test example><br>
The dry-coated tablets obtained in Examples 1 and 2, the film-coated tablets obtained in Comparative Example 1, and the sugar-coated tablets obtained in Comparative Example 2 were subjected to visual observation for evaluation of luster and uniformity of the coating. Further, time required for coating with the coating machine and disintegration time were measured, where disintegration time was measured following the disintegration testing method described in Japanese Pharmacopoeia, the 15th edition.  The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0046]<br><br>

®: have excellent luster, O: have luster, A: have little luster, X: have no luster<br>
Evaluation criteria for uniformity<br>
®: uniform, O: faintly uneven, A: slightly uneven, X: uneven [0048]<br>
As shown in Table 1, the tablets produced in Examples 1 and 2 could be produced in a much shorter time compared to the film-coated tablet and the sugar-coated tablet, while attaining an equivalent quality. [0049] [Example 3]<br>
Using a tumbler mixer, 1000 g of caffeine, 5000 g of lactose, 3000 g of crystalline cellulose (CEOLUS 101), 980 g of corn starch, and 20 g of calcium stearate were<br><br>
mixed.  The obtained powder mixture was then tableted using a rotary tablet press with a mortar having a diameter of 7.5 mm so that each tablet had a weight of 160 mg, thereby plain tablets were obtained.<br>
In a similar manner to Example 1, plural kinds of coating powder containing PEG 6000 and talc at various weight ratios were then produced and coating of the plain tablets were conducted with the coating powder thus produced, followed by cooling. [0050] <test example><br>
Ten experienced panelists evaluated whether or not the bitterness of caffeine was tasted by holding the coated tablet and the plain tablet produced by the method of Example 3 in the mouth, each separately. As a result, all of ten panelists tasted the strong bitterness with the plain tablet, whereas none of them tasted the bitterness with the coated tablet of the present invention. [0051] [Example 4]<br>

Evaluation criteria for uniformity<br>
®: uniform, O: faintly uneven, A: slightly uneven, X: uneven [0055]<br><br>
As shown in Table 2, any of the tablets obtained in Examples 1 through 11 was superior in appearance and disintegration property, and had a uniform coating layer. Furthermore, the tablets had superior resistance to a drop impact. [0056] [Comparative Example 3]<br>
PEG 6000 was heated to approximately 70°C and melted, to which pulverized sucrose was added.  The mixture was then uniformly mixed, while it was kept warm<br>
approximately at 60°C.  Subsequently the mixture was left to cool, and when it was slightly hardened, it was sieved through mesh 16 for granulation. A plain tablet having a diameter of 6.5 mm and a weight of 90 mg was provided as a core tablet, and tableting was conducted using a single tablet press (model: N-30E, Okada Seiko Co., Ltd.) so as to cover the core tablet with the powder mixture thus obtained, thereby a compression coated tablet having a diameter of 10 mm and a weight of 490 mg was produced. The tablets thus prepared were poured into the pan of the<br>
coating machine and heated for 20 minutes to 60°C while<br>
rotating, and then cooled with continuous rotation.<br>
