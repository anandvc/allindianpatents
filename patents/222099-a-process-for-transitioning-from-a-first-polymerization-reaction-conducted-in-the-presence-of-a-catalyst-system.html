				<td>The  present  invention   relates   to  a  process   for  transitioning from   a first polymerization reaction conducted in the presence of a catalyst system.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[001]	This invention relates to processes for transitioning among polymerization<br>
catalyst systems, preferably catalyst systems, which are incompatible with each other. Particularly, the invention relates to processes for transitioning among olefin polymerization reactions utilizing Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems, metallocene catalyst systems and chromium-based catalyst systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002]	Transitioning at low bed levels have been practiced commercially in fiuidized<br>
bed polymerization reactors for several years when operates are to be transitioned from one product type to other or transitioned to a different catalyst system. Successful low bed transitions can dramatically reduce transitioning timer and provide substantially reduced amount of off-grade product production. But under conventional practices, wherein low bed levels are accomplished, for example, by controlling the reactor discharge system to provide an increased discharge rates, catastrophic operability problems tend to occur for about 1 out of every 10 such transitions. While the occurrence of catastrophic operability problems at low bed levels have historically been about 10 percent, the 10 percent failure rate invariably diminishes all of the savings and gains from successful low bed transitions. Thus, there is an important need to improve low bed level transitions, especially when transitioning between incompatible catalyst systems.<br>
[003]	Catalyst transitions involve transitioning from one type of catalyst system<br>
producing polymers having certain properties and characteristics to another catalyst system capable of producing polymers of different chemical and/or physical attributes. Transitioning between similar metallocene catalyst systems, or compatible catalyst systems, for instance, generally takes place easily. But, where the catalyst systems are incompatible or of different types, the process is typically complicated. For example, transitioning between two incompatible catalyst systems such as a metallocene catalyst system and a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system, it has been found that some of the components of the metallocene catalyst system act as poisons to the Ziegler-Natta catalyst system. Consequently, the components of<br>
the metallocene catalyst system prevent the Ziegler-Natta catalyst system from promoting polymerization.<br>
[004]	In the past, to accomplish an effective transition between incompatible catalysts,<br>
the first catalyzed olefin polymerization process was stopped by various techniques known in the art. The reactor was then emptied, recharged and a second catalyst system was introduced into the reactor. Such catalyst conversions are time consuming and costly because of the need for a reactor shut-down for an extended period of time during transition.<br>
[005]	It would be highly advantageous if the process for transitioning between<br>
incompatible polymerization catalyst systems could be accomplished at a substantial reduce time, thereby reducing the amount of off-grade material produced during the transition process and reactor down-time. It would also be advantageous to increase the robustness and stability of the transition process as well as avoid the need to open the reactor (to atmosphere) to charge a new seed bed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014] The invention relates to improved low bed level transitions. In particular, the invention relates to processes for low bed level transitioning between catalysts and/or catalyst systems to convert a reactor from producing one type of product to another with minimal reactor downtime.<br>
[0015] hi particular, preferred processes are drawn to transitioning between Ziegler-Narta catalysts/catalyst systems and metallocene catalysts/catalyst systems. For the purposes of this patent specification and appended claims the terms "catalyst" and "catalyst system" shall be used interchangeably and shall have the identical meaning. The term "low bed level" is used herein to mean that the fluidizing bed height has been reduced from about 40 to about 50 percent of its normal height as measured during steady state operations. At low bed levels, the bed height is reduced to a height that is at least 25 percent, preferably at least 35 percent, more preferably at least 50 percent and most preferably at least 70 percent of the length of the straight section of the polymerization reactor. Bed height is conventionally lowered by increasing the product discharge rate from the reactor to downstream equipment e.g. a purge bin. Other conventional techniques for lowering bed height are known in the art.<br>
[0016] The processes of the present invention preferably are used in gas phase, solution phase, slurry or bulk phase polymerization processes. Most preferably, the processes of the present invention are used in a gas phase polymerization process in a fluidized bed reactor.<br>
[0017] In a typical continuous gas fluidized bed polymerization process for the production of polymer from monomer, a gaseous stream comprising monomer is passed through a fluidized bed reactor in the presence of a catalyst under reactive conditions. A polymer product is withdrawn from the fluidized bed reactor. Also withdrawn from the reactor is a cycle gas<br><br>
stream, which is continuously circulated and usually cooled. The cycle gas stream is returned to the reactor together with additional monomer sufficient to replace the monomer consumed in the polymerization- reaction. For detailed descriptions of gas phase fluidized bed polymerization processes, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,543,399 and 4,588,790, 5,028,670, 5,352,769 and 5,405,922.<br>
[0018] For a given catalyst to produce a given product of a certain density and melt index,<br>
which generally depends on how well a catalyst incorporates comonomer, a certain gas<br>
composition must be present in the reactor.	.<br>
[0019] Generally the gas contains at least one alpha-olefin having from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably 2-15 carbon atoms, for example, ethylene, propylene, butene-1, pentene-1, 4-methylpentene-1, hexene-1, octene-1, decene-1 and cyclic olefms such as styrene. Other monomers can include polar vinyl, dienes, norbornene, acetylene and aldehyde monomers, hi the preferred embodiments of the present invention, the gas composition contains ethylene and at least one alpha-olefin having 3 to 15 carbon atoms, most preferably butene-1, hexene-1 or octene-1 is selected as the at least one alpha-olefin.<br>
[0020] Typically, the gas composition also contains an amount of hydrogen to control the melt index of the polymer to be produced. In typical circumstances the gas also contains an amount of dew point increasing component with the balance of the gas composition made up of a non-condensable inerts, for example, nitrogen.<br>
[0021] Depending on the second catalyst to be introduced into the reactor the gas composition, such as the comonomer and hydrogen gas concentrations, can be increased or decreased.<br>
[0022] When transitioning between compatible catalysts, there are typically only slight differences in catalyst performance with regard to hydrogen and comonomer. But when transitioning between incompatible catalysts, the interrelationships and performance differences are not straightforward. For example, conventional Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems and metallocene catalyst systems have extremely different responses to molecular weight regulators, such as hydrogen and comonomer, and as such these catalysts are considered to be<br><br>
incompatible. Any traces of active Ziegler-Natta catalyst will produce very high molecular weight product under metallocene catalyst reactor conditions. Furthermore, particularly in a continuous transition process, the interaction between two incompatible catalysts may lead to production of high levels of small particles less than 100 microns, that is, may lead to fines. These fines can cause operability problems in the reactor such as fouling and sheeting. Applicants have discovered various processes for transitioning between two or more catalysts, including incompatible catalysts, that are particularly useful in a continuous gas phase polymerization process, thus, mitigating or eliminating the problems mentioned above.<br>
[0023] During the transition from a first catalyst to a second catalyst, particularly in a continuous process, it is reasonable to expect that interaction or contact of the two catalysts will occur. For compatible catalysts, the transition normally occurs by discontinuing the feed of the first catalyst while commencing the feed of the second catalyst. Typically it takes many hours until the first catalyst is entirely consumed. So, for a relatively long period of time the resin produced is a mixture from both the first and the second catalyst.<br>
[0024] Compatible catalysts are those catalysts having similar kinetics of termination and insertion of monomer and comonomer(s) and/or do not detrimentally interact with each other.<br>
[0025] For the purposes of this patent specification and appended claims the term "incompatible catalysts" shall refer to and mean catalysts that satisfy one or more of the following:<br>
1)	those catalysts that when present together reduce the activity of at least one of the<br>
catalysts by greater than 50%;<br>
2)	those catalysts that under the same reactive conditions produce polymers such that<br>
one of the polymers has a molecular weight that is more than twice the molecular weight of the<br>
other polymer; and<br>
3)	those catalysts that differ in comonomer incorporation or reactivity ratio under the<br>
same conditions by more than about 30%.<br>
[0026] The processes of the present invention are applicable to any transition between catalysts especially incompatible catalysts. For example, transitioning between a Ziegler-Natta catalyst<br><br>
and a metallocene catalyst or transitioning between a chromium catalyst and a metallocene catalyst or between a Ziegler-Natta catalyst and a chromium catalyst. The present invention contemplates that the direction of transition between incompatible catalysts is not limiting, however, it is preferred that the process of the invention transition from any other catalyst incompatible with a metallocene catalyst.<br>
[0027] According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the process is one for transitioning from a first polymerization reaction conducted in the presence of a first catalyst system to a second polymerization reaction conducted in the presence of a second catalyst system wherein the first and second catalyst systems are incompatible.<br>
[0028] According to this process in a steady-state operation with the first catalyst system, the rate of production of polymer is reduced by lowering or completely stopping the catalyst and cocatalyst (if present) feed into the reactor while continuing to discharge polymer product from the reactor so as to lower the height of the fluidized bed as the polymerization reaction rate declines. The present invention contemplates various operation modifications at this stage that may be used separately or in combination.<br>
[0029] One preferred operation modification includes the addition of a poison or behavior modifier for the first catalyst and cocatalyst (if present). The poison or behavior modifier further reduces the rate of reaction of the first polymerization reaction or chemically reacts with the first catalyst or cocatalyst to prevent these components from interfering with the reactivity and operability of the second catalyst or cocatalyst.<br>
[0030] Another preferred operation modification includes, discontinuing or reducing the feeds of monomer, comonomer and hydrogen such that the partial pressure or concentration of these gases in the reactor is reduced. According to this operation modification, an inert gas such as nitrogen may be optionally introduced to the reactor to maintain a desired total pressure as the partial pressure of the monomer, comonomer and hydrogen declines.<br>
[0031] Still another preferred operation-modification includes altering the cycle gas velocity through the fluidized bed. In one aspect, the cycle gas velocity is increased which results in<br><br>
raising the level of the fluidized bed or particles within the reactor while reducing the fluidized bulk density. Consequently, the weight of the fluidized bed is reduced while maintaining adequate height to minimize sheeting in the expanded section of the reactor. In another aspect, the cycle gas velocity is reduced which (for the region or reactor volume above the fluidizing bed results) in a reduction in entrained active catalyst species and/or fines which consequently precludes the onset or occurrence of reactor wall fouling above the height of the fluidized bed.<br>
[0032] According to this process of the present invention, the weight of the fluidized bed is allowed to drop to at least 50 percent of the steady-state operating bed weight and more preferably from 10 to 30 percent of bed weight. The magnitude of the bed reduction may be limited by the need to retain the level of the bed at least to the height of the catalyst injection level.<br>
[0033] According to a preferred embodiment, the level of resin downstream of the reactor (for example, the level of resin in a purge bin) is lowered prior to the initiation of transition. A reduction in the level of resin in downstream process equipment will permit the polymer particles to be removed from the reactor at a higher rate so as to reduce the time involved in reducing the bed level to a desired target height.<br>
[0034] According to yet another preferred embodiment, the walls of the reactor above the declining resin bed are kept clean by various techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Known wall cleaning techniques include, for example, using acoustic or sonic hammers, tangential flow cleaning systems, external wall temperature control systems, and periodic reactor blow-down cycles.<br>
[0035] As the bed weight in the reactor is reduced or reaches its lowest point, more poison or a different poison or catalyst behavior modifier may be added. Once the bed weight has reached a desired level, transition to a new catalyst or to the production or a new product can begin.<br>
[0036] If a catalyst transition is to be performed, poison or modifier may be added to the reactor to ensure that the first catalyst is no longer active or likely to negatively impact the operation or effectiveness of the second catalyst. Once this point is reached, the introduction of<br><br>
the second catalyst system and its cocatalysts can be started. According to a preferred embodiment, after the introduction of the second catalyst, the partial pressures of the monomer, comonomer and hydrogen gas in the reactor are maintained at a low level, below a steady-state level, and are raised gradually as the bed builds and the production rate increases.<br>
[0037] According to another preferred embodiment, a second catalyst is used that has been modified (i.e. retarded or inhibited such as by the introduction of a reversible catalyst kill or poison) to be less active, more operable and thus less likely to create wall fouling within the reactor. According to this embodiment, once steady-state operations at normal bed height are achieved, for an acceptable number of bed turnovers, the second catalyst is re-modified or allowed to return to its normal activity or a third catalyst may be introduced into the reactor. A suitable third catalyst would have a higher activity than the second catalyst or the modified second catalyst and it can actually be the second catalyst unmodified or the second catalyst without any retarder, inhibitor or reversible catalyst kill or poison present.<br>
[0038] According to yet another embodiment, the cycle gas velocity is manipulated to enhance the effectiveness of the operation at below normal bed heights so as to minimize entrainment of fines and to keep the fluidized bulk density at a low level. According to still another embodiment, no or limited discharge of resin product is taken to allow the fluidized bed of resin within the reactor to rise rapidly. Once the normal or a desired bed level is reached, the recycle gas velocity and the partial pressures of monomers, comonomers and hydrogen are adjusted to steady-state levels. In addition, once the operation has stabilized, the second catalyst is changed to its standard state or the reaction is allowed to continue with the third catalyst.<br>
[0039] In case the transition is a product transition, a modified first catalyst may be used as needed for reactor stability until normal steady-state operations are achieved.<br>
[0040] According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the resin produced by the polymerization process catalyzed by the first catalyst system is completely discharged so that the fluidized bed within the reactor is completely discharged and a new fluidized bed of resin particles is added to the reactor from a seed bin or hopper car. Preferably, the amount<br><br>
added would be the minimum necessary to initiate the polymerization reaction catalyzed by the second catalyst. The seed bed would be made with the second catalyst and preferably has properties as close as possible to the desired polymer product.<br>
[0041] According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, the fluidized bulk density of the polymer in the reactor is lowered prior to transition from the production of one product to another. Transitions from one product to another commercially produce a large amount of off-grade product that either has to be discarded or subsequently treated. This is due to the inherent nature of a fluidized bed reactor in which all of the material produced by the first reaction and catalyst system must be discharged from the reactor and due to the well-mixed fluidized system, a large amount of off-grade product is generated. For some catalyst families, it is desirable to operate at the neck of a fluidized bed reactor, so lowering the bed level is not a desirable option. Lined-out operation also desires a high fluidized bulk density of the resin produced so that production rate is not limited by the amount of product that can be discharged from the reactor. By lowering the fluidized bulk density prior to the transition, however, the weight of the polymer hi the reactor is lower and thus the amount of pounds of the first product to be removed is also reduced. This leads to a reduction in the amount of off-grade product produced during a transition.<br>
[0042] According to this embodiment of the present invention, the fluidized bulk density of the polymer in the reactor can be lowered in several ways. Specifically, the fluidized bulk density can be lowered by:<br>
1)	raising the velocity of the cycle gas;<br>
2)	increasing the density of the cycle gas through pressure, gas composition and/or<br>
temperature modifications;<br>
3)	transitioning to a catalyst that produces a lower fluidized bulk density particle or one<br>
that produces a lower fluidized bulk density while retaining a high settled bulk density;<br>
4)	operating to generate a smaller average particle size; or<br>
5)	operating to produce resin particles that are characterized as having less sphericity.<br><br>
[0043] In processes that tend to result in wall fouling, this embodiment of the present invention achieves the goal of reducing bed inventory during a product transition without causing wall fouling problems as may otherwise be experienced for a low bed level transition.<br>
[0044] During product transition, a large quantity of off-grade product is generated in a fluidized bed polymerization reactor because of the continuous stirred reactor mixing pattern of the particle phase. Reducing the reactor inventory by lowering the level of the fluidized bed during product transition is an efficient way to reduce the quantity of off-grade product. However, low bed level operation of a fluidized bed reactor is limited by the occurrence of fouling and sheeting on the reactor wall above the fluidized bed level. While not desiring to be limited to a particular mode of operation, it is believed that fouling and sheeting is initiated and caused by fines entrained from the fluidized bed. Accordingly, if the entrainment of fines can be significantly reduced, fouling and the formation of sheets could be eliminated or substantially reduced. The present embodiment of the invention, provides various techniques for reducing entrainment of fines during product transition. Specifically, the techniques for reducing entrainment of fines include:<br>
1)	reducing the cycle gas velocity to about 1 to about 1.5 ft/sec or from about 1.5 to<br>
about 10 times, preferably from about 3 to about 8 times the minimum velocity required to<br>
fluidize particles (which varies with bulk density);<br>
2)	reducing the total reactor pressure to a pressure in the range of about 50 to about 250<br>
psi;<br>
3)	reducing the cycle gas density to a density in the range of about 0.5 to about 1.2<br>
lb/ft3;<br>
4)	increasing the average particle size of the polymer product to a size in the range of<br>
about 0.025 to about 0.15 inches;<br>
5)	narrowing the particle size distribution to have from about 0 to about 2 weight-<br>
percent of fines passing US 120 mesh; and<br>
6)	changing the particle morphology to reduce the sphericity of the particles to a<br>
sphericity in the range of 0.3 to 0.7 (wherein 1.0 is indicative of perfectly spherical particles).<br>
[0045] According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a method is defined for operating a gas phase fluidized bed polymerization process at a reduced bed level<br><br>
well below the neck of the transition section for an extended period of time without operational problems such as expanded section sheeting or resin accumulation in the freeboard section by the use of transition agents such as either an antistatic agent, compounds that have a calming effect on reactor operability (e.g. reduce the incidences of erratic static generation and/or large reactor wall temperature swings) or a resin flow aid or combinations thereof. According to this embodiment, this can be accomplished by the addition of a transition agent, especially, an alkoxylated amine or amide material.   Preferably, the alkoxylated amine or amide material comprises an ethoxylated fatty acid amine.  Most preferably, the alkoxylated amine or amide material comprises ethoxylated stearyl amine that is commercially available from Witco Chemical Corporation under the tradename AS-990.   The transition agent and especially the alkoxylated amine or amide material can be added to the fluidized bed continuously and/or preferably to maintain a concentration ranging from about 1 to about 1000 ppm by weight (ppmw) based on the bed weight, more preferably to maintain a concentration from about 5 to about 35 ppmw, most preferably, from about 15 to about 25 ppmw during the transition process. Other suitable transition agents include ATMER 163, LAROSTAT 519,1-malic acid, dicop salts, talc, aluminum stearate, stearic acid and oleic acid. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that this process of the present invention may also be utilized in a linked reactor operation in which the residence time and thus the split of resin material made in each reactor can be controlled by lowering the height of the fluidized bed.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
[0080] In order to provide a better understanding of the present invention, the following examples are offered as related to actual tests performed in the practice of this invention.<br><br>
Reactor and Equipment<br>
[0081] The following examples were conducted in a fluidized bed reactor with a bis-indenyl metallocene catalyst system. The catalyst system was comprised of the reaction product of (H4lndenyl)2 SiMea-ZrCla) and methylalumoxane and was supported on silica and had 3 weight percent aluminum stearate and 0.5 weight percent AS-990 incorporated therein (based on the total weight of the catalyst system) as catalyst additives.<br>
[0082] Experimental indicators of operability problems utilize the measurement of temperatures which exist at the wall of the reactor. The temperature can be measured using any appropriate device but in general thermocouple devices are the most common. Since the temperature being measured is close to the reactor wall or "skin", the thermocouples are referred to as skin thermocouples. Typically, the skin thermocouples are 5°-10° F (1°- 4°C.) below the internal bed temperature. Deviations from this baseline (which can be either positive or negative) are indicative of reactor operability problems.<br>
[0083] Positive skin thermocouple deviations are the result of "hot spots" due to a localized run away reaction at the wall of the reactor. As the temperature continues to increase, it reaches the melting point of the polymer at which point a solid strip or sheet of polymer is formed and dislodged to the main body of the reactor resulting in severe operability problems. In many cases; several hours to days of a reactor shut down are required to remove the sheets before restarting the polymerization process.<br>
[0084]Negative skin thermocouple deviations are generally less serious than positive deviations since negative deviations are indicative of "cold" polymer being situated at the wall of the reactor. But negative deviations can present a problem if they persist by causing a solid insulating layer of polymer to be formed at the reactor walls. If this layer continues to grow, it can transfer into a reactor sheet. This phenomenon is referred to as "cold bands." It has been found that the cold bands are often associated with the adherence of small polymer particles or "fines" to the wall of the reactor. Fines are generally defined as the percentage of the total distribution of particles passing through a 120 mesh standard sieve (that is, the percentage of particles having a size less than or equal to 120 microns). Fines are important since high<br><br>
levels can lead to sheeting and fouling of the reactor cycle gas system. This results in heat exchanger and/or distributor plate fouling requiring a reactor shut down for clean-out.<br>
[0085] The cone angle of the transition section of the gas phase reactor was 15 degrees off vertical. The cone was about 1.7 feet high with a diameter of about 12.6 inches at the bottom and 22.6 inches at the top. The straight section of the reactor extended from the distributor plate to the cone, a distance of about 10 feet. The normal bed height was about 8 feet as calculated from bed weight and fluidized bed density. Rubble from each drum of resin (if present), was screened through half inch openings, collected and weighed to provide.a record of low bed level performance.<br>
Standard Fluidized-Bed Polymerization Conditions<br>
[0086] The polymerization was conducted in a continuous gas phase fluidized bed reactor. The fluidized bed was made up of polymer granules. The gaseous feed streams of ethylene and hydrogen together with liquid comonomer (hexene) were mixed together in a mixing tee arrangement and introduced below the reactor bed into the cycle gas line. The individual flow rates of ethylene, hydrogen and comonomer were controlled to maintain fixed composition targets. The ethylene concentration was controlled to maintain a desired ethylene partial pressure, typically about 200 to 220 psi. The hydrogen partial pressure was controlled to maintain a constant hydrogen to ethylene mole ratio. The concentration of all the gases were measured by an on-line gas chromatograph to ensure relatively constant composition hi the cycle gas stream.<br>
[0087] The support MAO/bis-indenyl metallocene catalyst system described above was injected directly into the fluidized bed as a dry powder from a shot feeder, entering the reactor at about the 2 ft level above the distributor plate with nitrogen gas carrier assist. The catalyst injection rate was adjusted to maintain a constant production rate. The reacting bed of growing polymer particles was maintained in a fluidized stated by the continuous flow of the make up feed and cycle gas through the reaction zone at a cycle gas velocity of about 2.1 to 2.4 ft/sec. The reactor was operated at a total pressure of 350 psig. To maintain a constant reactor temperature, the temperature of the cycle gas was continuously adjusted up or down to accommodate any changes in the rate of heat generation due to the polymerization.<br><br>
[0088] The fluidized bed was maintained at a constant height by withdrawing a portion of the<br>
bed at a rate equal to the rate of formation of particulate product. The product was removed<br>
semi-continuously via a series of valves into a fixed volume chamber, which was<br>
simultaneously vented back to the reactor. This allowed for highly efficient removal of the<br>
product, while at the same time recycled a large portion of the unreacted gases back to the<br>
reactor. The product was purged to remove entrained hydrocarbons and treated with a small<br>
stream of humidified nitrogen to deactivate any trace quantities of residual active catalyst<br>
species		. .<br>
[0089] A conventional voltage static probe was located at about the 1.5-foot level above the distributor plate. The reactor was equipped with twenty-six thermocouples mounted on the external surface of the reactor and expanded section. These were monitored continuously using a Honeywell TDC 3000 process computer. These thermocouples are referred to as "skin thermocouples". The skin thermocouples were located at about the distributor plate (actually about 2 inches above the plate), and at 1 foot, 2 feet, 3 feet, 5 feet, and 8 feet above the distributor plate and at the cone. All skin thermocouples except the one located at the cone extended about 1/8 inch into the bed. The cone skin thermocouple was flush with the reactor wall and was located exactly at the halfway point of the cone.<br>
General Procedure for Moving From High to Low Bed Level<br>
[0090] The following is a general procedure for moving from the standard high bed level<br>
conditions noted above to low bed level conditions and continuing operation of a gas phase<br>
fluidized bed reactor:<br>
•	The catalyst feed is stopped about 15 minutes prior to lowering the bed from<br>
neck level. This will ensure that resin left or deposited in the expanded section as the bed level<br>
drops, does not contain fresh catalyst.  This will help to mitigate the possibility of forming an<br>
expanded section sheet during the bed lowering step.<br>
•	The bed is lowered to about 40 to 50% of its original height as quickly as<br>
possible. If the cycle gas velocity is to be reduced, it is done by a step change prior to lowering<br>
the bed.<br><br>
•	The ethylene (€2) partial pressure is decreased starting immediately when the<br>
bed level decrease is initiated by stopping monomer feed.   Comonomer feed may also be<br>
stopped or adjusted.   The H2 feed is adjusted to maintain the correct concentration.   The<br>
reaction temperature, CX/C2 and Hb concentrations are lowered steadily to the new target as the<br>
€2 partial pressure falls. The target ethylene partial pressure is 120 psi. Make-up pressure on<br>
the reactor is switched to nitrogen gas (N2) to maintain constant total pressure.<br>
•	The catalyst feed is restarted when the production rate reaches about 40% of its<br>
value at full bed level. Generally, the objective is to run the reactor at a production rate that is<br>
proportional to the remaining bed weight relative to the full reactor, and in some cases even<br>
lower to achieve about the same overall catalyst productivity at the lower ethylene partial<br>
pressure.  For example, if the production rate is 40 pph (pounds per hour) at full bed it would<br>
be 20 pph at half-weight and then about 15 pph to account for the lower C2 partial pressure.<br>
This translates to about a 4 to 5 hour residence time at a low bed level.<br>
Chemical Agents to Improve Low Bed Level Transitions<br>
[0091]AS-990 is an ethoxylated stearyl amine that functions as an anti-static agent and/or resin/wall surface modifier and as such has a calming effect on reactor continuity. L-Malic Acid poisons active catalyst in the expanded section as it heats up, thus preventing sheeting; that is, L-malic acid is triggered by melting, and then it deactivates active catalyst locally before it can react.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0092] This example describes an improved low bed level transition, i.e. a transition to low-bed<br>
level at low-ethylene partial pressure and/or low cycle gas velocity conditions.<br>
[0093]The reactor was started on a seedbed of 1 MI/0.920 EX-381 resin making product at normal conditions. The cone, reactor walls, and distributor plate were relatively clean prior to starting.<br>
[0094] Catalyst addition was stopped 15 minutes before the lowering of the bed. The bed weight was lowered steadily from 150 to 90 Ibs over period of about 1 hour. The fluidized bulk density increased from about 19.5 to 21 lb/ft3 with a slightly narrower bandwidth. The<br><br>
bed weight differential pressure (dP) narrowed. The 5-ft. tap reading moved to about zero and intermittently registered a value. The bed level was about 4.5 ft. above the distributor plate during this low bed operation.<br>
[0095] The ethylene partial pressure in the reactor was decreased from 210 to 140 psi essentially simultaneously with the lowering of the bed weight. The comonomer feed was stopped to maintain the Ce/Ca ratio at a constant level. The HI partial pressure was reduced to the range of 570-600 ppm and the total pressure within the reactor was held at 350 psi by the addition of makeup pressure with NI. The hydrogen partial pressure and the Ce/Ca setpoints were maintained to keep the melt index (MI) and density of the polymer product within intended specifications.<br>
[0096] The cycle gas velocity was reduced in two steps from 2.2 to 1.8 ft/sec as the bed level decreased. The cycle gas velocity was lowered from 2.2 to 1.8 ft/sec when the bed lowering was started. The cycle gas velocity was then lowered from 2.0 to 1.8 ft/sec when bed level was halfway to 85 Ibs.<br>
[0097] When the desired low bed, low €2 and low cycle gas velocity levels were reached, the bed was allowed to fluidize for an hour while monitoring for changes in static and bed thermocouple activity. If the skin thermocouples exothermed in the expanded section or the skin thermocouples dropped very low in the bed, the catalyst feed would have been stopped and the fluidized bed would be allowed to circulate for a sufficient period to allow the bed to recover to a steady-state condition.<br>
[0098] Then the catalyst was started at 30% of the previous rate. The rate of catalyst feed was brought up over a 2 hour period to achieve a polymer production rate of 20 pph of resin.<br>
Results<br>
[0099] The bed and 1-foot skin thermocouples dropped low as the bed level was decreased. Well before catalyst feed was started, the static broadened and corresponded to activity on the 2 and 3-foot skin thermocouples. This was the state of the reactor when a little more than six hours after lowering the bed level the catalyst feed was started. That static cleared up a few<br><br>
hours later and the skin activity subsided. Both returned for a short period later, accompanied by erratic activity at the 8-foot skin thermocouple. The cone thermocouple did not exotherm after the catalyst feed was started.<br>
[00100]	The reaction was initiated with the introduction of catalyst and steadily<br>
increased for 4 hours at a slow rate. The cone was slowly warming during this tune. The reaction then started to diminish, beginning about four hours after starting catalyst. This lasted for 2 hours, during which time the cone thermocouple dropped several degrees lower. The plate thermocouple cleaned up at the same time. After two hours, the reaction came on strongly and the cone thermocouple again warmed up. This corresponded to a second episode of static broadening. The cone started to cool again after a couple of hours and static later subsided and the erratic skin thermocouple behavior passed.<br>
[00101]	By the end of two days prior to shutting down, the cone thermocouple had<br>
drifted down to about 28°C below bed temperature. The other skin thermocouples had stabilized and all except the 1-foot level had cleared. It ran about 9°C low.<br>
[00102]	Resin screened through Vz inch mesh showed an absence of agglomerates when<br>
running at normal bed level. But 1A to 1-inch agglomerates showed up after the reactor transitioned to low bed, low ethylene, low cycle gas velocity conditions. Lowering the ethylene partial pressure appears to improve low-bed-level operations and therefore provide an intermediate transition method between a bed dump and a full bed transition.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[00103]	This example describes a transition to low-bed level, low-ethylene partial<br>
pressure and low cycle gas velocity conditions with the addition of AS-990.<br>
[00104]	The reactor was started on a seedbed of 1 MI/0.920 EX-381 resin making<br>
product at normal conditions. The expanded section and cone were blown clean prior to startup.<br><br>
[00105]	Kemamine AS-990, an ethoxylated stearyl amine commercially available from<br>
Witco Chemical Corporation, was dispersed as a 10-wt% slurry in purified Kaydol mineral oil and added to the reactor via an injection tube using a slurry catalyst feeder. Carrier flows of nitrogen (Na) with or without isopentane were swept it into the bed via an injection tube entering the bed at about the 2 foot level. The 10-wt% AS-990 in Kaydol mineral oil was fed by a syringe pump at 20 cc/hr for 1 hr with 2 pph N2 carrier and 2 pph isopentane carrier.<br>
[00106] AS-990 in the mineral oil slurry, added over an hour's time, built a concentration of approximately 20 ppmw AS-990 in the bed. This had a calming effect on static and skin thermocouples and caused no loss in catalyst productivity at normal bed conditions. The cone thermocouple settled within 2°C of the bed and catalyst activity remained good.<br>
[00107]	Catalyst addition was stopped an hour later and the lowering of the bed began<br>
about 15 minutes later. The bed weight was lowered steadily from 150 to 85 Ibs over a period of 1 hour. The fluidized bulk density remained at about 20 Ib/ft but had a narrower bandwidth. The bed weight dP narrowed. The 5-ft tap reading moved to about zero and intermittently registered a value. The bed height was about 4.2 ft.<br>
[00108]	The ethylene partial pressure in the reactor was decreased from 210 to 140 psi<br>
essentially simultaneously with the lowering of the bed weight. The comonomer feed was<br>
stopped to maintain the Cs/Ca ratio at a constant level. The Ek partial pressure was reduced to<br>
the range of 570-600 ppm and the total pressure within the reactor was held at 350 psi by the<br>
addition of makeup pressure with NI. The hydrogen partial pressure and the Ce/Ca setpoints<br>
were maintained to keep the melt index (MI) and density of the polymer product within<br>
intended specifications.	,<br>
[00109]	The cycle gas velocity was reduced in two steps from 2.2 to 1.8 ft/sec as the bed<br>
level decreased. The cycle gas velocity was lowered from 2.2 to 2.0 ft/sec when the bed lowering was started. The cycle gas velocity was then lowered from 2.0 to 1.8 ft/sec when the bed level was halfway to 85 Ibs.<br><br>
[00110] When the desired low bed, low €2 and low cycle gas velocity levels were reached, the bed was allowed to fluidize for an hour while looking for changes in static and bed thermocouple activity. If the skin thermocouples exothermed in the expanded section or the skin thermocouples dropped very low in the bed, the catalyst feed would have been stopped and the fluidized bed would be allowed to circulate for a sufficient period of time to allow the bed to recover to a steady-state condition.<br>
[00111]	Then the catalyst was started at 30% of previous rate. The rate of catalyst feed<br>
was brought up over a 2 hour period to achieve a polymer production rate of 20 pph of resin.<br>
[00112] In addition, the AS-990 feed was turned back on at 1 cc/hr with 2 pph N2 carrier and 0.5-1.0 pph isopentane carrier.<br>
Results<br>
[00113] The cone skin thermocouple dropped from -1 to -4° in response to lowering the bed. Catalyst feed was resumed two hours after starting the transition and the reaction came on steadily without interruption. AS-990 continuous feed was initiated 2 hours after starting the catalyst, but at less than the aim feed rate. Steady-state concentration in the bed was only 7 ppmw. AS-990 moved the static slightly positive.<br>
[00114] The cone thermocouple started to warm 4 hours after initiating catalyst feed (2 hours after starting AS-990 feed). It peaked about 1.8°C above bed temperature within 2 hours and then began a slow decline that eventually reached -9°C below the bed temperature 12 hours into the transition. The 1-foot skin thermocouple cooled a few degrees during this time, but other thermocouples remained steady.<br>
[00115] The AS-990 feed rate was increased by a factor of three (to a 20-ppmw steady-state concentration) in response to the low cone temperature. The rate of descent of the cone temperature tapered off and turned upwards within two hours. Other skin thermocouples similarly responded, moving closer to the bed temperature. Within another 2 hours the cone thermocouple passed through a phase where it quickly warmed to within 5°C of the bed. Over the next 12 hours the cone thermocouple slowly moved steadily closer to the bed temperature<br><br>
reaching within about 2°C near the end of the run. Other thermocouples had their closest approach to bed temperature about four hours after starting continuous AS-990 addition and then very slowly drifted lower. Static steadied out at about 100 volts in the presence of the AS-990.<br>
[00116]	The reactor was run 28 hours at low bed conditions before inspection shutdown.<br>
Approximately 16.5 hours were with continuous AS-990 feed at the 20-ppmw level.<br>
[00117]	Screening drums caught essentially no resin agglomerates during normal<br>
operation, and no resin agglomerates during the AS-990 low-bed, low-ethylene, low cycle gas velocity test.<br>
[00118] The cone was clean down to bare metal in most areas. There remained a very thin region of resin only about 1/32 inch thick adhered to the 5-6 inch vertical band above the cone. The middle of the cone was relatively clean. A very small amount of resin remained in the very lower portion of the cone, only maybe !4 inch thick. It was not fused and easily brushed away. It could not be reached and was not sampled.<br>
[00119]	The expanded section contained a thin resin layer.  The straight section of the<br>
lower reactor was clean. There was no lip of resin at the joining of the cone and lower section.<br>
[00120]	A small sheet was found lying on the distributor plate.   It was composed of a<br>
couple of sections that collectively formed a ring. The shape and contours suggested it formed in the very lower portion of the cone and the top of the straight section.<br>
[00121] Thus, the addition of AS-990 cleaned up the cone section and improved operability during low-bed operation. It also prevented formation of 1A inch resin agglomerates, a characteristic phenomenon for low-bed operation. Although a sheet formed, it was much smaller and less significant than sheet formation without AS-990 injection.<br>
[00122]	There may be an optimal level for the AS-990.   With what appeared to be an<br>
insufficient amount, the cone thermocouple was depressed and falling indicative of resin<br><br>
accumulation in that area. Near the optimal level, the cone cleaned up and the other skin thermocouples exhibited their narrowest temperature spread during the entire investigation. Above the optimal level, the cone thermocouple continued to clean up and the other skin thermocouples slightly diverged. The optimal level of AS-990 appears to be about 20 ppmw in the seedbed resin.<br>
[00123] AS-990 not only caused the cleaning of the expanded section down to bare metal, but also eliminated the cloud of dust above the bed, indicating that entrainment of fines was also reduced.<br>
