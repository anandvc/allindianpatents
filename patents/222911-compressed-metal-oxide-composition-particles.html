				<td>COMPRESSED METAL OXIDE COMPOSITION PARTICLES<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a bound or compressed metal oxide composition<br>
particle for use in removing contaminants, including sulfur compounds, from fluids, and a<br>
method for making such compressed metal oxide composition. More preferably, the present<br>
invention relates to a compressed pelletized iron oxide composition, with the binder<br>
preferably being a water insoluble composition.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
It is well known to use metal oxides, particularly iron oxide (Fex Oy) in a reactor bed<br>
to remove contaminants, typically sulfur compounds, especially hydrogen sulfide (H2S), from<br>
fluids, typically gas streams. Sulfur compounds are removed from fluids because they are<br>
known contaminants, which potentially make gas streams or other fluids unsalable. Gas that<br>
contains too much sulfur is known as sour gas. As such, in the gas industry, as well as related<br>
industries, it is considered necessary to remove sulfur compounds from fluids, including gas.<br>
Note that these fluids are typically devoid of oxygen. (It is known oxygen can increase<br>
reactivity between a metal oxide composition and contaminants.) For this reason, there is a<br>
need for products that remove sulfur compounds from fluids efficiently and cost effectively.<br>
It is further desired to have a method or composition that does not require the inclusion of<br>
activating agents, such as oxygen. Unfortunately, most commercially available iron oxide<br>
compositions (the most frequently used metal oxide material in removing sulfur) that operate<br>
at ambient conditions and are generally non-activated, hold an. amount of sulfur equal to at<br>
most 20% by weight of the total iron oxide composition. More typically, iron oxide material<br>
(like that compressed in the present process) will hold on average 0.12 lbs of H2S/1b of iron<br>
oxide. (The percent held is dependent, in part, on the particular species of iron oxide used.)<br>
Increased H2S absorption capacity for iron oxide compositions, above 20%, typically requires<br>
the addition of a caustic or oxygen to the feed gas, which is dangerous and potentially<br>
difficult, especially at high pressures. This is problematic because approximately 80% of the<br>
total metal oxide product is unused. For this reason, frequent replacement of the metal oxide<br>
is required. Consequently, it is desired to increase the percent by weight of sulfur held by the<br>
total metal oxide product.<br>
Sulfur removal on a level that treats up to millions of cubic feet of gas per day or on<br>
an industrial scale typically requires the use of large reactor beds filled with the iron oxide<br>
media or product. Typically, this media is comprised of iron oxide and a carrier such as<br>
montmorillonite or wood chips. In order to eliminate frequent change-outs, that is, the<br>
replacement of spent metal oxide media (media that no longer has suitable reactivity with<br>
sulfur) with new metal oxide media, large or numerous reactor beds are used. These reactor<br>
beds will either be very tall, 10 feet or higher, or multiple reactors will be lined up in<br>
succession so that a plurality of reactor beds will be used. If the reactor beds are too small or<br>
few, the metal oxide will be spent too fast. This is because when treating large volumes of<br>
gas or other fluids, the metal oxide found in the metal oxide media will be rapidly reacted. In<br>
order to have a sufficient bed life so that frequent changings of the metal or iron oxide media<br>
is not required, large amounts of metal oxide must be used. This is disadvantageous for a<br>
couple of reasons. First, the amount of sulfur held by the metal or iron oxide composition is<br>
low relative to the total weight of the product used. In order to increase efficiency, it is<br>
desired to have a product that holds a greater percentage of reacted sulfur per pound of total<br>
product. Secondly, the amount of area required to remove sulfur can increase costs. It is<br>
desired to have the option to decrease the total area required to remove H2S. In other words,<br>
it is desired to hold a greater amount of sulfur with a decreased amount of metal oxide<br>
composition.<br>
One way to increase the amount of sulfur held in a reactor vessel is to pelletize or<br>
compress the metal oxide. The amount of sulfur held by the metal oxide composition is<br><br>
increased because there is more available metal oxide in the vessel. Normally, metal oxide is<br>
placed on a carrier, with the carrier comprising approximately 80% by weight of the metal<br>
oxide composition. Conversely, a pellet is typically comprised of an amount of binder equal<br>
to from about 1% to about 20% by weight of the pelletized mixture. As can be seen, the<br>
amount of metal oxide is significantly increased. The binders that have been used to form the<br>
pelletized iron oxide particles include cement, bentonite, and similar compositions, especially<br>
inorganic compositions. The pelletized particles made from these binders, however, have<br>
suffered from a problem in that it appears that the efficiencies have been lowered and that the<br>
reactivity of the metal oxides has been decreased. In particular, the amount of sulfur held is<br>
not significantly increased over the amount of sulfur held by the same species of metal oxide<br>
particle on a carrier. For this reason, prior attempts to pelletize metal oxide have been<br>
considered unsuccessful because of inadequate sulfur reactivity, in particular, holding<br>
capacity. Thus, it is necessary to find a binder that allows for sufficient binding of the metal<br>
or iron oxide particles without lowering the reactivity or efficiency with which the sulfur<br>
compounds are removed. More particularly, it is necessary to find a binder that permits the<br>
metal oxide to hold a greater amount of sulfur, in particular, H2S, without the presence of a<br>
caustic or the addition of oxygen in some form.<br>
As stated, it has been known to pelletize metal oxides for use in removing sulfur<br>
compounds from fluids. In particular, U.S. Patent No. 4,732,888, invented by Jha et al.<br>
discloses a zinc ferrite pellet for use in hot coal gas desulfurization. The patent discloses a<br>
composition comprised of zinc and iron oxide bound together with inorganic and organic<br>
binders, and a small amount of activator. Inorganic binders include bentonite, kaolin, and<br>
Portland Cement. The organic binders include starch, methylcellulose, and molasses. The<br>
pellets have a very specific product design because they are used in beds having temperatures<br>
of at least 650°C. Because of the high temperatures, the organic binders dissipate leaving<br>
pellets that are fragmented and porous. Thus, the organic binders are included for the<br><br>
specific purpose of holding the pellets together, initially, and then dissipating so as to create<br>
greater porosity. While this design is outstanding for use in high temperature coal<br>
desulfurization processes, it does not provide for sufficient removal at ambient conditions.<br>
As implied, it has been observed that inorganic binders decrease the amount of sulfur<br>
removed by pelletized metal oxides. As a result, insufficient removal of sulfur will likely<br>
occur at ambient or near ambient conditions when inorganic binders are used to bind the<br>
pellets together. It should also be noted that it has previously been believed that organic<br>
binders were unacceptable for forming pellets used at ambient conditions, because the<br>
organic binders generally do not provide for a pellet that has sufficient crush strength, or<br>
there is insufficient reactivity, or the use of the binders creates a pellet that is cost prohibitive.<br>
Summary of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to bound or compressed, metal oxide composition<br>
particles used in the removal of contaminants, preferably sulfur compounds, from fluids, and<br>
methods related thereto. The compressed metal oxide composition particle will be comprised<br>
of an amount of metal oxide equal to at least 80% by weight of the compressed metal oxide<br>
composition particle. Additionally, the compressed metal oxide composition particles have a<br>
crush strength equal to at least 1 kg and, more preferably, a crush strength equal to at least 3.5<br>
kg. The compressed metal oxide composition will also retain an average amount of sulfur<br>
equal to at least 10% by weight of the compressed metal oxide composition particle and,<br>
more preferably, an amount of sulfur equal to at least 30% by weight of the compressed metal<br>
oxide composition particle. Importantly, the compressed metal oxide composition particle<br>
will hold a greater amount of sulfur than if the particular metal oxide species used to form the<br>
compressed metal oxide composition particle was used in association with a carrier.<br>
Generally, the compressed metal oxide composition particle will be able to hold an amount of<br>
hydrogen sulfide (H2S) equal to at least 0.27 per pound of compressed metal oxide<br><br>
composition particles. The compressed metal oxide composition particle is further<br>
advantageous because it will sufficiently remove sulfur at temperatures of less than 200° C<br>
and, even more advantageously, at ambient conditions.<br>
The compressed metal oxide composition particle will be comprised of an amount of<br>
metal oxide, preferably in powder form or having a small particle size, and a binder. The<br>
metal oxide will have a particle size ranging between about 0.1 microns and about 100<br>
microns, which means that the metal oxide will be similar to dust, also known as fines. Any<br>
of a variety of metal oxides which are reactive with sulfur compounds may be used to form<br>
the compressed metal oxide composition particles. Most preferably, the metal oxide will be<br>
of the formula MexOy, with Me selected from the group consisting of row 4, 5, 6, and 7<br>
metals, with x equal to between 1 and 3, and y equal to between 1 and 4. It is more preferred<br>
if the metal oxide is an iron, zinc, or manganese oxide composition, as these metal oxides<br>
have been known to readily react with sulfur compounds. In particular, iron oxide of the<br>
formula Fea0b will be preferred with a equal to between 1 and 3, and b equal to between 1<br>
and 4. As such, compositions that include iron oxide of the formula Fe3O4 are most<br>
preferred.<br>
Any of a variety of organic binders may be used to hold the metal oxide particles<br>
together to thereby form the compressed or bound metal oxide composition particle. The<br>
binder selected must permit the metal oxide to be reactive with the sulfur compounds, and<br>
must also provide for a bound metal oxide particle having sufficient crush strength. Crush<br>
strength will be equal to at least 1 kg, as mentioned above, and is more preferably equal to at<br>
least 3.5 kg. As such, it has been determined that suitable binders, which provide for a<br>
compressed metal oxide composition particle complying with the present invention are starch<br>
compositions, carboxymethylcellulose, and mixtures thereof. Other suitable binders include<br>
cellulose compositions. Water insoluble binders are preferred, with water insoluble cellulose<br>
compositions being the most preferred binders. Additionally, lignin, bentonite, and<br><br>
lignosulfonate may also be used as binders. The binder can be added to the metal oxide in an<br>
amount equal to between 0.5% and 20% by weight of the metal oxide, and, more preferably,<br>
in an amount equal to between 0.5% and 5% by weight of the metal oxide.<br>
The method of the present invention involves combining the cellulose, which is the<br>
preferred binder, with the metal oxide particles, and thoroughly mixing the two constituents.<br>
Once the two constituents are mixed, it is necessary to compress the mixture so as to form the<br>
compressed metal oxide composition particles. The techniques used to compress the<br>
constituents to form the compressed metal oxide composition particles can be any of a variety<br>
of techniques or devices, including extrusion or compaction. Any compression device or<br>
method can be used, as long as the compressed metal oxide composition particles are suitably<br>
formed and have sufficient crush strength. The current invention uses extrusion or<br>
compaction to compress the metal oxide mixture. The constituents can be passed through an<br>
extruder to form a compressed metal oxide composition. Conversely, the constituents can be<br>
placed in a compactor to form a compressed metal oxide composition. A compactor is a<br>
device having at least two symmetrical wheels, which turn in opposite directions, thereby<br>
compacting the metal oxide composition between them. The use of either an extruder or a<br>
compactor has been found to produce particles which have sufficient crush strength and<br>
reactivity with contaminants, especially sulfur compounds. Any of a variety of compactor or<br>
extrusion devices may be used.<br>
The compressed metal oxide composition particles may be formed into the desired<br>
particle size at the time of formation or may be formed and then broken into the desired size.<br>
At least 90% of the compressed metal oxide composition particles should have a final particle<br>
size equal to between about .1 mm to about 200 mm. It is not possible to have 100% of the<br>
compressed metal oxide composition particles within this range because the smaller end of<br>
the range will include compressed metal oxide composition particles which are powder or<br>
fines, and some of these fines will enter into the final product, Preferably, the final particle<br><br>
size is equal to between about .1 ram and about 20 mm. More preferably, the final particle<br>
size is equal to between about .5 mm to about 5 mm.<br>
Preferably, once the metal oxide mixture has been compressed, it is broken apart so as<br>
to form compressed metal oxide composition particles of the desired size. The smaller final<br>
particle size increases the amount of hydrogen sulfide which the compressed metal oxide<br>
composition particles are able to absorb. The broken apart compressed metal oxide<br>
composition particles are then processed through a screener for granular classification to<br>
ensure at least 90% of the particles have the correct particle size. Any oversize particles are<br>
discharged into a hammer mill, and then sent back to the screener. The fines, meanwhile, are<br>
recycled back into a batch of the compressed metal oxide composition.<br>
The present invention is advantageous for a number of reasons. In particular, the<br>
compressed metal oxide composition particles allow for a product that can be used in a<br>
reactor bed, whereby the product reacts with a greater amount of sulfur so that a greater<br>
amount of sulfur is found in the reactor bed. This is desirable because a lesser amount of<br>
overall space can be used and fewer reactor vessel change-outs are required. The size of the<br>
particles is advantageous because it allows for increased use of the total material. The<br>
present invention is also advantageous because it demonstrates that pelletized compressed<br>
metal oxide composition particles can be formed that have sufficient reactivity with sulfur.<br>
This means that the particles are suitable for commercial use, unlike many other known<br>
pelletized metal oxide compositions.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The present invention relates to a bound or compressed metal oxide composition<br>
particle, a method for making such a particle, and a method of using such a particle to remove<br>
contaminants, preferably sulfur compounds, from fluids. The compressed metal oxide<br>
composition particle is preferably a compressed iron oxide composition particle that is well<br>
suited for removing sulfur compounds, such as H2S, from fluids. The compressed metal<br>
oxide composition particle advantageously retains a greater amount of the sulfur compounds<br>
than other metal oxide compositions. The compressed metal oxide composition can retain an<br>
average amount of sulfur equal to at least 10%, and preferably 30%, by weight of the<br><br>
compressed metal oxide composition particle. The compressed metal oxide composition will<br>
sufficiently remove sulfur at temperatures of less than 200° C and under any pressure. More<br>
preferably, the compressed metal oxide composition will sufficiently remove sulfur at<br>
ambient conditions. A compactor or extruder is used to form the compressed metal oxide<br>
composition, which is comprised of at least one metal oxide and a binder. The binder can be<br>
a starch composition, carboxymethylcellulose, and combinations thereof. Suitable binders<br>
also include cellulose compositions. Water insoluble cellulose compositions are the preferred<br>
binder. The compressed metal oxide composition can then be sized to a final particle size<br>
equal to between about .1 mm and about 200 mm. The final particle size is preferably equal<br>
to between about .1 mm and about 20 mm. More preferably, the final particle size is equal to<br>
between about .5 mm and about 5 mm.<br>
The method is initiated by mixing an amount of metal oxide with an amount of binder<br>
to form a homogenous metal oxide mixture. Any method of mixing the two constituents can<br>
be used, as long as the constituents are thoroughly mixed and a homogenous binder/metal<br>
oxide mixture is formed. It is preferred to add the binder to the metal oxide in an amount<br>
equal to from about 0.5% to about 20% by weight of the metal oxide. More preferably, the<br>
binder is added to the metal oxide in an amount equal to between 0.5% and 5% by weight of<br>
the metal oxide.<br>
Any of a variety of metal oxides can be used in the present invention, with the metal<br>
oxides defined by the formula MexOy, whereby Me is selected from the group consisting of<br>
row 4, 5, 6, and 7 metals, with x equal to between 1 and 3, and y equal to between 1 and 4.<br>
More preferably, the metal oxide is selected from the group consisting of FeaOb, ZnO, MnO,<br>
and combinations thereof, with a being equal to between 1 and 3, and b equal to between 1<br>
and 4. Also," hydrated forms of the metal oxide may be used. Iron oxide compositions (FeaOb)<br>
are the most preferred metal oxides for use in the present invention. Preferably, the bound<br>
metal oxide particle will include Fe3O4 . This composition is commonly sold under the name<br><br>
"black iron oxide" and as such, black iron oxides are preferred for use in the present<br>
invention.<br>
The metal oxide will have a particle size ranging between about 0.1 microns and<br>
about 100 microns and, more preferably, between about 1.5 microns and 50 microns. As<br>
such, the unprocessed or raw metal oxide used to form the bound metal oxide product will be<br>
fines, or in powder form. Thus, a uniform body or bound particle will be formed from a<br>
granular or fine material. Also, the particles are preferably porous so that they are believed to<br>
have at least 25 times more surface area than other non-porous particles such as solid<br>
particles of the same size. These are believed to be desired characteristics.<br>
The binder that is mixed with the metal oxide should be of a sufficient binding<br>
strength so as to form a metal oxide particle that will have a crush strength of at least 1 kg,<br>
and preferably, 3.5 kg, as measured by a Kohl hardness tester. Not only should the binder<br>
impart a sufficient crush strength, but it should be such that it does not impact the reactivity<br>
of the metal oxide particles with sulfur. It is hypothesized that the binder should be such that<br>
it allows for the compressed metal oxide composition particles to have some porosity, or<br>
transfer capability, which allows reasonable use of the interior of a particle. Regardless, the<br>
binder should allow the compressed metal oxide composition, particle to retain an amount of<br>
sulfur equal to at least 10% by weight of the particle and, preferably, at least 30% by weight<br>
of the particle. The binder can be added to a metal oxide in an amount equal to between<br>
0.5% and 20% by weight of the metal oxide, and, more preferably, in an amount equal to<br>
between 0.5% and 5% by weight of the metal oxide. The binder should be such that it is<br>
relatively water insoluble. It is necessary to prevent substantial dissolution of the binder by<br>
water because the particles are typically used in a moist environment. If water does dissolve<br>
the binder, the particles can potentially degrade, as the binder will no longer work. Thus, a<br>
water insoluble binder that does not degrade due to the presence of water, is preferred. Any<br>
of a variety of binders fitting this description can be used; however, it is most preferred to use<br><br>
an organic binder that is more preferably a water insoluble cellulose composition. It is<br>
preferred if the cellulose present in the metal oxide particle composition is equal to, or less<br>
than, 15%.<br>
The preferred binder is a water insoluble cellulose, or a mineral modified cellulose. A<br>
binder comprised of nearly 100% water insoluble cellulose is most preferred. Preferably, the<br>
binder absorbs less than 60% by weight water. An aspect ratio of between 6 and 7 is<br>
preferred. A density of greater than 70 gm/L is preferred. The particle size of the binder<br>
should range between 32 microns and 200 microns. An example of a suitable commercially<br>
available binder is TECHNOCEL™ 202, manufactured by the Cellulose Filler Factory Corp.,<br>
Chestertown, Maryland.<br>
In addition to the metal oxide used to form the compressed metal oxide composition<br>
particle, an amount of activator of metal oxide can be added to the mixture. The addition of<br>
the activator is intended to increase the reactivity of the compressed metal oxide composition<br>
particle and, in particular, will cause the particle to more readily react with sulfur compounds.<br>
Among the available activators are copper oxide, silver oxide, gold oxide, platinum oxide,<br>
cadmium oxide, nickel oxide, palladium oxide, lead oxide, mercury oxide, tin oxide, cobalt<br>
oxide, aluminum oxide, manganese oxide, and combinations thereof. It is most preferred,<br>
however, to use a copper oxide, as this has been known to most readily increase the reactivity<br>
of a metal oxide without the ready formation of hazardous compounds, as specified by the<br>
Environmental Protection Agency. It should be noted that when the metal oxide used is<br>
manganese oxide, the activator will be any available activator other than manganese oxide.<br>
The activator should be added in an amount equal to from about 0.5% to about 5% by weight<br>
of the metal oxide composition used to form the bound metal oxide particle.<br>
Once the metal oxide mixture has been mixed, the metal oxide mixture is compressed<br>
to form the compressed metal oxide composition. Compression can be achieved in a variety<br>
of ways, as long as compressed particles are formed. It is preferred to pass the composition<br>
through a compactor or an extruder so as to form a compressed metal oxide composition.<br>
Any of a variety of devices and methods can be used for forming the compressed metal oxide<br>
composition, as long as sufficient reactivity with sulfur is maintained, and the particles<br>
produced therefrom have sufficient crush strength. Compressed metal oxide composition<br>
particles having the desired final particle size can be produced directly by the extruder or<br>
compactor. The desired final particle size is equal to between about .1 mm and about 200<br>
mm. Preferably, the final particle size is between about .1 mm and 20 mm. More preferably,<br>
the final particle size is equal to between about .5 mm and about 5 mm. At least 90% of the<br>
compressed metal oxide composition particles will be in these ranges. It is not possible to<br>
have 100% of the particles be in the appropriate range because the small end of the range will<br>
include some particles sized to the level of powder, or fines, some of which will end up in the<br>
final product. If compressed metal oxide composition particles having the desired final<br>
particle size are produced by the device, it is not necessary to break them apart or screen<br>
them. It is believed that these conditions will result in a particle having sufficient reactivity<br>
and crush strength.<br>
Preferably, however, the compressed metal oxide composition is in large pieces once<br>
it passes through the compactor or extruder. It is then broken apart into compressed metal<br>
oxide composition particles of the desired particle size. Standard methods in the industry for<br>
forming pellets out of extruded material can be used. As such, the compressed metal oxide<br>
composition will have a crush strength of 3.5 kg, and a final particle size equal to between<br>
about .1 mm and about 200 mm. Preferably, the final particle size will be equal to between<br>
about .1 mm and about 20 mm. More preferably, the final particle size will be equal to<br>
between about .5 mm and about 5 mm. The smaller particle size of the final product allows<br>
the metal oxide, which is present in the particles, to react with an increased amount of the<br>
II2S, thus, increasing the amount of H2S removed. Note that the crush strength of the<br>
particles will be dependent upon a variety of factors, including moisture content, starch<br>
concentration, and particle size.<br>
Besides compacting or extruding the metal oxide and the binder, other compressed<br>
forms may be used. Among the available compressed forms are pellets, tablets, pestilles,<br>
ribbed, ribbed rings, rings, spheres, and extrusions.<br>
Any method can be used for compressing the metal oxide together so that a carrier is<br>
not required, and it can be used in a reaction bed. It is further desired to form particles<br>
instead of simply adding metal oxide powder to a reaction vessel because, for sufficient<br>
reactivity to occur, there must be space within the reactor to allow the fluid to pass. Powder<br>
would not allow for a sufficient flow rate.<br>
When the compressed metal oxide composition is formed by extrusion, it may be<br>
necessary to dry the pellets or particles so as to reduce moisture. Any process for drying can<br>
be used, as long as the particles have a total water content of less than 10% by weight and,<br>
more preferably, less than 3% by weight. The temperature used to dry the particles should be<br>
any temperature that will not breakdown or incinerate the binder, and which does not oxidize<br>
the metal oxide. Preferably, the temperature will be 150° C or less, and, more preferably, the<br>
temperature will be 90° C or less. It is necessary to dry the pellets to maximize the crush<br>
strength.<br>
Dryers that may be used include a rotary dryer or belt dryer. The rotary dryer is<br>
preferred.<br>
After drying, it is preferred to marumerize the compressed metal oxide composition<br>
particles, formed by extrusion as this has been found to increase the hardness and abrasion as<br>
measured by the percentage of fines in the treated compressed metal oxide composition. Any<br>
of a variety of marumerizers may be used in the present invention. Rotary drying may<br>
eliminate the need for a marumerizer.<br>
After the compressed metal oxide composition particles are formed by breaking apart<br>
the compressed metal oxide composition, the particles are processed through a screener for<br>
granular classification. Oversize particles are discharged into a hammer mill, and then<br>
returned to the screener. The fines are recycled into a batch of the compressed metal oxide<br>
composition.<br>
Once the compressed metal oxide composition particles have been formed, they<br>
should be placed in a reactor vessel so as to be contacted with fluids contaminated with sulfur<br>
compounds. The fluids will include gas, liquid, and combinations thereof. It is most<br>
preferred to remove sulfur compounds from contaminated gas streams, such as propane and<br>
hydrocarbon gases. Among the sulfur compounds that can be removed using the present<br>
metal oxide particles are hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbonyl sulfide (COS), carbon disulfide<br>
(CS2), Dimethyl Sulfide (DMS), and mercaptans, such as Methyl Mercaptan (MeSH), Ethyl<br>
Mercaptan (EtSH), and Propyl Mercaptan (PrSH). It should be noted that it is likely that<br>
other contaminants found in fluids, especially hydrocarbon gas, can be removed by the<br>
compressed metal oxide particles. These sulfur compounds can be removed under ambient<br>
conditions. More particularly, sulfur compounds can be removed when the temperature is<br>
equal to, or less than, 70° C, with 200° C being the highest temperature. Any pressure can be<br>
used, with ambient pressure preferred. Additionally, the fluid stream can be passed over the<br>
compressed metal oxide composition particles at a velocity equal to at least 0.6 feet per<br>
minute in gases and 0.1 feet per minute for liquids.<br>
The compressed metal oxide composition particles can retain an average amount of<br>
sulfur equal to at least 10%, and preferably 30%, by weight of the compressed metal oxide<br>
composition particles, and have an H2S holding capacity equal to at least 0.27 pounds of H2S<br>
per pound of compressed metal oxide composition particles. Also, the metal oxide particles<br>
should have a density ranging between 1.0 and 1.5. From this, it can be concluded that the<br>
compressed metal oxide composition particles have increased sulfur holding capacity.<br><br>
The following examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not meant to limit<br>
the claims in any way.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1.<br>
A test was conducted to determine the effectiveness of extruded pelletized iron oxide<br>
in removing sulfur species contaminants, including, hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide,<br>
mercaptans, and possibly carbon disulfide. The test was initiated by packing a 2 inch by 12<br>
inch column with approximately 1.25 pounds, or approximately 10 inches, of pelletized iron<br>
oxide media. The iron oxide pellets were comprised of black iron oxide and a starch binder.<br>
An inlet valve was located at the bottom of the column so that contaminated liquid entered<br>
the column at the bottom and exited the top of the column. The gas to be purified was liquid<br>
propane contaminated with various sulfur species contaminants, including hydrogen sulfide,<br>
carbonyl sulfide, and light mercaptans. Measurements to determine the amount of sulfur<br>
contaminants were made when the gas entered the column and when the gas exited the<br>
column, with measurements taken at different times. Fig. 1 shows the initial amounts of<br>
various sulfur compounds entering the column. The contaminants were measured in parts<br>
ppm by weight. The specific conditions in the reactor or column are listed below as follows:<br>
Type of Treater...................Single, Verticle Flow Direction...........................Up Flow<br>
Treater Temp..........................................65° Contact Time.........................15 mLs/min<br>
L/D Ratio................................................5:1 CEP-1...............................FMl Extrusion<br>
Sample Pressure.............................360 psig<br>
L/D stands for Dieway length/Diameter in the die of the extruder.<br>
The sulfur contaminants were detected by using a copper strip test, which identified<br>
the amount of sulfur and contaminants in the liquid stream, by its corrosivity to polish copper<br>
strips by ASTM method D-1838.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 1, the pelletized iron oxide resulted in excellent removal of<br>
various sulfur compounds. In particular, H2S was readily removed by the pelletized iron<br>
oxide. Additionally, COS, CS2, and rnercaptans were readily removed. Thus, it was<br>
concluded that the pelletized iron oxide provided for excellent removal of sulfur compounds.<br>
This was considered important because it was known that previous iron oxide pellets did not<br>
sufficiaitly remove sulfur, as compared to iron oxide on a carrier.<br>
Example 2.<br>
Compressed iron oxide composition particles of varying particle size were formed in<br>
order to test the effect of particle size on the performance of the compressed iron oxide<br>
composition. The compressed iron oxide composition particles were formed using a MS-75<br>
compaction system by Hosokawa Bepex. The cellulose binder, TECHNOCEL™ 202, was<br>
first hydrated in a Ribbon Blender Model No. IM16 by placing 100 pounds of<br>
TECHNOCEL™ 202 in the blender, turning the blender on, and adding 80 pounds of water<br>
for six minutes and forty seconds at 40 psi. The blender was turned on for an additional five<br>
minutes to uniformly hydrate the TECHNOCEL™ 202. Next, 100 1bs. of cuprous oxide<br>
(Purple Copp 97N) was added, and the blender turned on for an additional five minutes. This<br>
blend was transferred up to the feed introduction level of the MS-75 Compactor and placed in<br>
an Accurate Feeder. Two thousand pounds of iron oxide having a moisture of 1.95% and a<br>
loose bulk density of 86 lbs/ft3 was released by gravity into an Acrison Feeder. The feeder<br>
men transferred the iron oxide into the Turbulizer Model No. TS8. The TECHNOCEL™ 202<br>
blend was metered to the Turbulizer from the Accurate Feeder. The Turbulizer deposited the<br>
TECHNOCEL™ 202 iron oxide blend into the MS-75 compactor. The blender feed was<br>
metered to the rolls of the compactor via a vertical feed screw. After compaction, the flakes<br>
were discharged into the flake breaker, and then were mechanically conveyed to the screener<br>
for granular classification. The oversize material was discharged into the RD-8 hammer mill,<br>
then conveyed back to the screener. The fines were recycled directly back into the feed<br>
hopper, and the on-size product granules were collected.<br>
The composition specified to produce the granules was 87.7% iron oxide, 4.4%<br>
TECHNOCEL™ 202, 4.4% cuprous oxide, and 3.5% water.<br>
A sample of a compressed iron formulation was screened to three different particle<br>
size distributions, as shown in Table 1.<br>
Basically, the average particle size decreases going from Sample 1 to Sample 3, as<br>
shown in Table 2.<br>
Using a standard laboratory performance test, the effect of particle size on<br>
performance is shown in Fig. 2. Sample 1, which contained the largest particle sizes with an<br>
average particle size of 4.5 mm, took approximately 90 days to reach the breakthrough point<br>
of 4 ppm of hydrogen sulfide detected, Sample 2 containing particles of an average size of<br>
2.5 mm took until approximately Day 115 to breakthrough at 4 ppm of hydrogen sulfide<br>
detected, while Sample 3 containing an average particle size of only 2.0 mm did not show a<br>
breakthrough of hydrogen sulfide at 4 ppra until approximately 135 days of testing. These<br>
results indicate that the decrease in average particle size increased the effective H2S removal<br>
capacity of the compressed metal oxide particles.<br>
Example 3.<br>
The same procedure as Example 1 was followed except pelletized zinc oxide was<br>
tested instead of pelletized iron oxide. The conditions were as follows:<br>
Type of Treater...................Single, Verticle L/D Ratio.............................................5:1<br>
Treater Temp..........................................65° Sample Pressure..........................360 psig<br>
Flow Direction...............................Up Flow<br>
Contact Time............................11 mLs/min<br>
CEP-1......................................2.0 extrusion<br>
The results of the test are disclosed in Fig. 3. It was observed that the pelletized zinc<br>
oxide, in general, removed most sulfur compounds except COS. Use of the pelletized zinc<br>
oxide resulted in suitable elimination of most sulfur compounds. This was considered<br>
important because normally zinc oxide suitably eliminates sulfur contaminants at higher<br>
temperatures. At ambient conditions, zinc oxide will typically hold between 3% and 8% total<br>
sulfur.<br>
Example 4.<br>
Tests were conducted to determine the relative crush strength of pelletized iron oxide<br>
particles. Three types of iron oxide known as FM1 (Ferrimagnetic 1), FM2 (Ferrimagnetic<br>
2), and Hoover were pelletized, with all three types of iron oxide being similar black iron<br>
oxides. The FMl and FM2 iron oxides are ferrimagnetic porous iron oxide particles believed<br>
to range in size from 1.5 microns to 50 microns, with a hypothesized surface area of 10<br>
m2/gm. The Hoover oxide is believed to be a much smaller grade material with little or no<br><br>
porosity. Tho iron oxide was blended with various types of binders, with the binders mixed<br>
in different amounts in solution. Also, various extruder die lengths were used. These<br>
variations were made to determine what combination would result in iron oxide particles<br>
having sufficient crush strength. A pelleting press manufactured by ICahl was used to form<br>
all the iron oxide pelletG, with the pellets formed from the press having a diameter of 6 mm.<br>
To assess tho strength of each pellet, a Kohl Pcllet Hardness Tester was used. In order to<br>
derive accurate duto, teats were madc on ten pellets manufactured according to each method,<br>
with the lesults then averaged. The Kahl pellet tester is manufactured by Amundus Kohl<br>
GmbH &amp; Co., Hamburg, Germany. The following table shows the results of the teste, the<br>
particular type of binder for use in forming each or the pellets, the die length used to form the<br>
pellets, and the average crush strength.<br>
The binder listing is the percentage of starch on a dry weight basis found in the<br>
pellets. The percent water represents the amount of binder and water solution mixed with the<br>
metal oxide material. The density of the pellets appears to be unrelated to the crush strength<br>
of the pellets.<br><br>
As can be seen from the data, the use of starch and bentonite provided for excellent<br>
crush strength in the pellets formed therefrom. Carboxymethylcellulose resulted in a pellet<br>
having insufficient crush strength. Additionally, it was determined that a die length of at<br>
least 30 mm was preferred.<br>
Example 5.<br>
The present Example relates to testing the pelletized FM1, FM2, and Hoover iron<br>
oxides to evaluate the reactivity and efficiency of each composition in removing hydrogen<br>
sulfide from gas. Three reactor beds were filled with the three different types of iron oxide.<br>
Two pounds of the pelletized iron oxide material was placed in a 4-foot glass reactor bed<br>
tube. This step was repeated for each test composition listed in Table 4. A sour gas stream<br>
containing 3,000 ppm by weight of H2S was passed over the various pelletized iron oxide<br>
compositions. Specifically, the gas was passed over the FM2 bed once, the FMl bed three<br>
times, and the Hoover bed three times, all of which are listed in the chart below. The flow<br>
rate of the contaminated gas (Q) was set at one of three different rates: 2.09 liters per minute<br>
(L/min), 3.75 L/min, or 5.09 L/min. The outlet H2S was recorded as a function of time of the<br>
varying flow rates.<br>
Fig. 7 shows how much H2S was held on the Hoover and FMl types of iron oxide at<br>
flow rate of 2.09 L/min before break-through of H2S occurred. Additionally, Fig. 7 shows<br>
how much sulfur was held on the same type of iron oxide used to form the FM1 composition,<br>
but with the iron oxide located on a carrier. As can be seen, the pelletized iron oxide held<br>
significantly more sulfur. In Fig. 8, the same thing as Fig. 7 was shown, except a different<br>
flow rate, 5.09 L/min, was used. The system was pressurized at 6 psig, and the sour gas had a<br>
temperature of 68° F. The H2S was measured using an industrial scientific TMX 412<br>
electronic gas analyzer, calibrated with a standard 124 ppm H2S in tube mixture. Also, a<br>
Kitagawa tube was used as a cross check to confirm the H2S levels.<br>
The rate constants (k) were calculated from a determination of the outlet H2S, with the<br>
outlet H2S (lbs.) equation as follows: S[H2S reacted over ?t (lbs.)]. Fig. 4 plots the rate<br>
constant versus the pounds of H2S on the bed for FM1 oxide material. Three different flow<br>
rates were used. The (Bran's) constant k was highest at the fastest flow rate of 5.09 L/min.<br>
The slope of the curve equates to the rate of reactivity over lime. The steeper the curve, the<br>
faster the reactivity will be reduced. Thus, the slope of the lines in Figs. 4, 5, and 6 indicate<br>
reactivity. Fig. 6 shows the same thing as Fig. 4, except the iron oxide was the Hoover<br>
species. Fig. 5 relates to the same data as in Fig. 4, except three different types of iron oxides<br>
were tested.<br>
The FM2 had the highest rate of reactivity, followed by the FMl . Both compositions<br>
showed excellent reactivity. The Hoover material was observed to be not as good a candidate<br>
for use as the other two materials. From the k determination, the estimated per pound<br>
capacity for holding H2S by the oxide was determined using linear regression analysis of a<br>
plot of k versus lbs. of total H2S on the bed. The estimated capacity is listed below. Further,<br>
the slope of the linear regression analysis relates to the speed of reaction between the oxide<br>
material and the H2S, this is R. The x intercept of the plots gave the overall capacity of the<br>
materials. The results are summarized as follows:<br>
As can be seen, the FM2 and FM1 had superior results for holding an amount of H2S<br>
per pound of iron oxide (see Est. Capacity per Pound).<br>
Example 6.<br>
The reaction rate k, from Example 5, was analyzed to determine whether the<br>
pelletized iron oxide had a better reaction efficiency than non-pelletized iron oxide. Pig. 7 is<br>
a combined plot of outlet H2S readings (ppm) v. pounds of H2S that has reacted with a bed of<br>
pelletized material, either the (FM1), (Hoover), or non-pelletized iron oxide materials, at a<br>
flow rate of 2.09 L/rnin. These curves relate to the outlet readings of H2S (ppm) to the<br>
amount of reacted H2S with the bed, and directly illustrates the reactive speed of the<br>
materials.<br>
As can be seen in Fig. 7, two pounds of FMl product reacted with 0.38 pounds of H2S<br>
before the outlet H2S reached 900 ppm. This is compared with non-pelletized iron oxide,<br>
which had only 0.15 pounds of iron oxide reacted before the H2S reached a level of 900 ppm<br>
at the outlet. This shows that the pelletized iron oxide gives a superior result, and reacts with<br>
a greater amount of H2S than non-pelletized iron oxide.<br>
Example 7.<br>
The present Example compared pelletized zinc oxide with SULF ATREAT® (iron<br>
oxide on a montmorillonite carrier). The conditions and results are as follows:<br>
ZnO SulfaTreat<br>
Bed Height 2.0 ft 2.0 ft<br>
Pressure 5 psig 5 psig<br>
Flow Rate 270 cc/min. 270 cc/min.<br>
ZnO SuIfaTreat<br>
Temp 70° F 70° F<br>
Inlet Cone. 3000 + ppm H2S in N2 3000 ppm H2S<br>
Diameter 1.5 in. 1.5 in.<br>
Weight 1065 gins 827 gins<br>
Volume 815 mL 815 mL<br>
Total gas used 12830 L 14774 L<br>
Total H2S removed 38.5 L 44.3 L<br>
Days to Breakthrough 33 38<br>
The ZnO ran for 33 days before hydrogen sulfide broke through. This is 5 days<br>
shorter than SuIfaTreat ran at the same conditions. Although the ZnO did not remove as<br>
much sulfur as SuIfaTreat, the results are positive. ZnO is mainly used at elevated<br>
temperatures and this test was run at room temperature and still removed H2S.<br>
Example 8.<br>
The present Example relates to the preparation of exemplary metal oxide pellets used<br>
in. the removal of sulfur from fluids. The method was initiated by obtaining a sample of black<br>
iron oxide from the Ironrite Products Company, Inc. of St. Louis, Missouri. The black iron<br>
oxide was analyzed and determined to contain an amount of moisture equal to 3% by weight.<br>
Additionally, it was determined that the black iron oxide had a bulk density of 1.558 kg/L.<br>
To form the metal oxide pellets, 9,000 gms of the black iron oxide were placed in a<br>
bladekneader, manufactured by Sigma Corporation, St. Louis, Missouri. To the black iron<br>
oxide, an amount of binder solution was added. The binder solution was formed by mixing<br>
118 gms of starch manufactured by Argo to boiling water. Starch was measured so that it<br>
was equal to 1.34% by weight starch on a dry weight basis, so that the total binder solution<br>
added to the black iron oxide was equal to 17.2% by weight. This formed a binder and iron<br>
oxide composition, which was then kneaded in the bladekneader for 5 minutes. A dough was<br>
produced that was slightly wet and sticky.<br>
The iron oxide dough was then fed into a pellet press, Model 14-175 (manufactured<br>
by Kohl). The pellet press operated at 100 rpm and was equipped with a 6 mm die, having a<br>
60 mm pressway length. The energy input for the pellet press was equal to about 1.51 kw,<br>
and the extrusion rate was equal to 224 kg per hour.<br>
After extrusion, the pellets were processed in a marumerizer (made by LCI<br>
Corporation, Charlotte, North Carolina), with an 8 mm friction plate turning at 300 rpm for<br>
10 seconds. The pellets were thervoven dried at a temperature of about 200° F, and it was<br>
determined that the pellets had a bulk density of approximately 1.25 kg/L. Additionally, it<br>
was determined that the pellets had a hardness equal to about 6.0 kg.<br>
Example 9.<br>
An iron oxide pellet was formed that included a cellulose binder. The process of<br>
formation was as follows:<br>
1. In a tank, 64 lbs. of water was added to 50 lbs of cellulose and mixed.<br>
2. Next, 1000 lbs. of iron oxide with a moisture content of 1% or less was added<br>
to the cellulose and water mixture.<br>
3. The constituents were mixed until a homogenous blend was formed.<br>
4. The blend was then pressed at 45,000 psi to form the pellets. The resultant<br>
pellets were of the following composition:<br>
Component % By Weight<br>
Iron 89<br>
Cellulose 5<br>
Water 6<br>
Thus, there has been shown and described a method, relating to the use of compressed<br>
metal oxide compositions for removing contaminants from fluids, and a method for making<br>
such compressed metal oxide compositions which fulfill all the objects and advantages<br>
sought therefore. It is apparent to those skilled in the art, however, that many changes,<br>
variations, modifications, and other uses and applications for the subject compressed metal<br>
oxide compositions and methods are possible, and also such changes, variations,<br>
modifications, and other uses and applications which do not depart from the spirit and scope<br>
of the invention are deemed to be covered by the invention which is limited only by the<br>
