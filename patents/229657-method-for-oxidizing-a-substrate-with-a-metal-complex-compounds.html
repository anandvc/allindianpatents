Use of metal complex compounds as oxidation catalysts<br>
The present invention relates to the use of metal complex compounds with terpyridine ligands as oxidation catalysts. The present invention relates also to formulations comprising such metal complex compounds, to novel metal complex compounds and to novel ligands.<br>
The metal complex compounds are used especially for improving the action of peroxides, for example in the treatment of textile material, without at the same time causing any appreciable damage to fibres and dyeings.<br>
Peroxide-containing bleaching'agents have been used in washing- anD cleaning processes for some time, they have an excellent action at a liquor temperature of 90°C and above, but their performance noticeably decreases with lower temperatures. It is known that various transition metal ions, added in the form of suitable salts, or coordination compounds containing such cations catalyse the decomposition of H2O2. In that way it is possible to increase the bleaching action of H2O2, or of precursors that release H2O2t or of other peroxo compounds, the bleaching action of which is unsatisfactory at lower temperatures. Particularly significant for practical purposes are those combinations of transition metal ions and ligands the peroxide activation of which is manifested in an increased tendency towards oxidation in respect of substrates and not only in a catalase-like disproportionation. The latter activation, which tends rather to be undesirable in the present case, could impair the bleaching effects of H2O2 and its derivatives which are insufficient at low temperatures.<br>
In respect of H2O2 activation having effective bleaching action, mononuclear and polynuclear variants of manganese complexes with various ligands, especially with 1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,6-triazacyclononane and optionally oxygen-containing bridge ligands, are currently regarded as being especially effective. Such catalysts have adequate stability under practical conditions and, with Mnn+, contain an ecologically acceptable metal cation, but their use is unfortunately associated with considerable damage to dyes and fibres.<br>
The aim of the present invention was, therefore, to provide improved metal complex catalysts for oxidation processes which fulfil the above demands and, especially, improve the action of peroxy compounds in an extremely wide range of fields of use without giving rise to any appreciable damage.<br><br>

The metal complex compounds of formula (1) are known or can be obtained analogously to known processes. They are obtained in a manner known perse by reacting at least one ligand of formula (2) in the desired molar ratio with a metal compound, especially a metal salt, such as the chloride, to form the corresponding metal complex. The reaction is carried out, for example, in a solvent, such-as water or a lower alcohol, such as ethanol, at a temperature of e.g. from 10 to 60aC, especially at room temperature.<br>
Ligands of formula (2) that are substituted by hydroxy! can also be formulated as compounds having a pyridone structure in accordance with the following scheme (illustrated here using the example of a terpyridine substituted by hydroxyl in the ^-position):<br><br>
Their special place within the terpyridine family results from the fact that such ligands are capable of being deprotonated and are therefore able to act as anionic ligands.<br>
Generally, therefore, hydroxyl-substituted terpyridines are also to be understood as including those having a corresponding pyridone structure.<br>
The ligands of formula (2) are known or can be prepared in a manner known perse. For that purpose, for example, two parts of pyridine-2-carboxylic acid ester and one part of acetone can be reacted with sodium hydride and the intermediate, a 1,3,5-triketone,<br><br>
obtained after aqueous working-up can be reacted with ammonium acetate to synthesise the central pyridine ring. The corresponding pyridone derivatives are obtained, which can be converted into the chlorine compounds by reaction with a chlorinating agent, such as PCI5/POCI3. Reactions of such compounds with amines, if desired in the presence of an excess of redox-active transition metal salts, such as iron or ruthenium, in order to accelerate the substitution, yield amine-substituted terpyridines. Such preparation processes are described, for example, in J. Chem. Soc, Dalton Trans. 1990, 1405-1409 (E.C. Constable et a/.) and New. J. Chem. 1992, 16, 855-867.<br>
It has now been found that for the accelerated substitution ofhalide by amine at the ter-pyridine structure it is also possible to use catalytic amounts of non-transition metal salts, such as zinc(ll) salts, which considerably simplifies the reaction procedure and working-up.<br>

Instead of, or in addition to, the anionic or non-ionic dispersant, the granules according to the invention may comprise a water-soluble organic polymer as binder. Such polymers may be used singly or in the form of mixtures of two or more polymers.<br>
Water-soluble polymers that come into consideration are, for example, polyethylene glycols, copolymers of ethylene oxide with propylene oxide, gelatin, polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, polyvinylpyrrolidones, vinylpyrrolidones, vinyl acetates, polyvinylimidazoles, polyvinylpyridine-N-oxides, copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone with long-chain ct-olefinst copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone with vinylimidazole, poly(vinylpyrrolidone/dimethylaminoethyl methacryiates), copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone/dimethylaminopropyl methacrylamides, copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone/dimethylaminopropyl acrylamides, quaternised copolymers of vinylpyrrolidones and dimethylaminoethyl methacryiates, terpolymers of vinylcaprolactam/ vinylpyrrolidone/dimethylaminoethyl methacryiates, copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone and methacrylamidopropyl-trimethylammonium chloride, terpolymers of caprolactam/vinyl-pyrrolidone/dimethylaminoethyl methacryiates, copolymers of styrene and acrylic acid, polycarboxylic acids, polyacrylamides, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, polyvinyl alcohols, polyvi  acetate, hydrolysed polyvinyl acetate, copolymers of ethyl<br><br>

Of those materials, preference is given to polyethylene glycols, polyamides, polyacrylamides, polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinylpyrrolidones, gelatin, hydrolysed polyvinyl acetates, copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone and vinyl acetate, and also polyacrylates, paraffins, fatty acids, copolymers of ethyl acrylate with methacrylate and methacrylic acid, and polymethacrylates.<br>
Further additives (d) that come into consideration are, for example, wetting agents, dust removers, water-insoluble or water-soluble dyes or pigments, and also dissolution accelerators, optical brighteners and sequestering agents.<br>
The preparation of the granules according to the invention is carried out, for example, starting from:<br>
a)	a solution or suspension with a subsequent drying/shaping step or<br>
b)	a suspension of the active ingredient in a melt with subsequent shaping and solidification.<br>
a) First of all the anionic or non-ionic dispersant and/or the polymer and, if appropriate, the further additives are dissolved in water and stirred, if desired with heating, until a homogeneous solution has been obtained. The catalyst according to the invention is then dissolved or suspended in the resulting aqueous solution. The solids content of the solution should preferably be at least 30 % by weight, especially 40 to 50 % by weight, based on the total weight of the solution. The viscosity of the solution is preferably less than 200 mPas.<br><br>
The aqueous solution so prepared, comprising the catalyst according to the invention, is then subjected to a drying step in which all water, with the exception of a residual amount, is removed, solid particles (granules) being formed at the same time. Known methods are suitable for producing the granules from the aqueous solution. In principle, both continuous methods and discontinuous methods are suitable. Continuous methods are preferred, especially spray-drying and fluidised bed granulation processes.<br>
Especially suitable are spray-drying processes in which the active ingredient solution is sprayed into a chamber with circulating hot air. The atomisation of the solution is effected e.g. using unitary or binary nozzles or is brought about by the spinning effect of a rapidly rotating disc. In order to increase the particle size, the spray-drying process may be'com-, bined with an additionalagglbmeration of the liquid particles with solid nuclei in a fluidised bed that forms an integral part of the chamber (so-called fluid spray). The fine particles (
During the granulation step, the water can rapidly be removed from the solutions comprising the catalyst according to the invention, binder and further additives. It is expressly intended that agglomeration of the droplets forming in the atomising cone, or the agglomeration of droplets with solid particles, will take place.<br>
If necessary, the granules formed in the spray-dryer are removed in a continuous process, for example by a sieving operation. The fines and the oversize particles are either recycled directly to the process (without being redissolved) or are dissolved in the liquid active ingredient formulation and subsequently granulated again.<br>
A further preparation method according to a) is a process in which the polymer is mixed with water and then the catalyst is dissolved/suspended in the polymer solution, thus forming an aqueous phase, the catalyst according to the invention being homogeneously distributed in that phase. At the same time or subsequently, the aqueous phase is dispersed in a water-immiscible liquid in the presence of a dispersion stabiliser in order that a stable dispersion is formed. The water is then removed from the dispersion by distillation, forming substantially<br><br>
dry particles. In those particles, the catalyst is homogeneously distributed in the polymer matrix.<br>
The granules according to the invention are wear-resistant, low in dust pourable and readily meterable. They can be added directly to a formulation, such as a washing agent formulation, in the desired concentration of the catalyst according to the invention.<br>
Where the coloured appearance of the granules in the washing agent is to be suppressed, this can be achieved, for example, by embedding the granules in a droplet of a whitish . 'meltable substance ("water-soluble wax") or by adding ;a white pigment (e.g.. JiO2) to the granule formulation or, preferably, by encapsulating tae granulesSn a,melt consisting, for/,., example, of a water-soluble wax, as described in EP-A-0 323 407, a white solid being addet to the melt in order to reinforce the masking effect of the capsule.<br>
b) The catalyst according to the invention is dried in a separate step prior to the melt-granulation and, if necessary, dry-ground in a mill so that all the solids particles are 
The finely particulate catalyst is suspended in the molten carrier material and homogenised. The desired granules are produced from the suspension in a shaping step with simultaneous solidification of the melt. The choice of a suitable melt-granulation process is made in accordance with the desired size of granules. In principle, any process which can be used to produce granules in a particle size of from 0.1 to 4 mm is suitable. Such processes are droplet processes (with solidification on a cooling belt or during free fall in cold air), melt-prilling (cooling medium gas/liquid), and flake formation with a subsequent comminution step, the granulation apparatus being operated continuously ordiscontinuously.<br>
Where the coloured appearance of the granules prepared from a melt is to be suppressed in the washing agent, in addition to the catalyst it is also possible to suspend in the melt white or coloured pigments which, after solidification, impart the desired coloured appearance to the granules (e.g. titanium dioxide).<br><br>
If desired, the granules can be covered or encapsulated in an encapsulating material. Methods suitable for such an encapsulation include the customary methods and also the encapsulation of the granules by a melt consisting e.g. of a water-soluble wax, as described, for example, in EP-A-0 323 407, coacervation, complex coacervation and surface polymerisation.<br>
Encapsulating materials (c) include e.g. water-soluble, water-dispersible or water-emulsifiable polymers and waxes.<br>
Further additives (d) include e,g. wetting agents, dust-removers, water-insoluble or water-soluble dyes or pigrrients,.and also dissolution accelerators, optical brighteners and sequestering agents.<br>
Surprisingly, the metal complex compounds of formula (1) also exhibit a markedly improved bleach-catalysing action on coloured stains on hard surfaces. The addition of such complexes in catalytic amounts to a dishwashing agent that comprises a peroxy compound and optionally TAED (N,N,N\N'-tetraacetylethylenediamine) results in the substantial removal of e.g. tea stains on china. This is the case even when hard water is used, it being known that tea deposits are more difficult to remove in hard water than in soft water. The compounds are also very suitable for cleaning hard surfaces at low temperatures.<br>
The use of metal complex compounds of formula (1) as catalysts for reactions with peroxy compounds in cleaning solutions for hard surfaces, especially for kitchen- and table-ware, is therefore of special interest.<br>
The present invention relates also to cleaning agents for hard surfaces, especially cleaning agents for table- and kitchen-ware and, among such agents, preferably those for use in cleaning processes carried out by machine, which agents comprise one of the above-described metal complex compounds of formula (1) as bleach catalyst. Suitable formulations for such cleaning agents include, for example, the formulations mentioned above for the washing agents.<br><br>
The metal complex compounds of formula (1) also have, together with peroxy compounds, excellent antibacterial action. The use of the metal complex compounds of formula (1) for killing bacteria or for protecting against bacterial attack is therefore likewise of interest.<br>
The metal complex compounds of formula (1) are also outstandingly suitable for selective oxidation in the context of organic synthesis, especially the oxidation of organic molecules, e.g. of olefins to form epoxides. Such selective transformation reactions are required especially in process chemistry. The invention accordingly relates also to the use of the metal complex compounds of formula (1) in selective oxidation reactions in the context of organic synthesis.<br>

APPLICATION EXAMPLES<br>
Application Example 1: (Stability of the Mn complexes)<br>
For this purpose, 50 jjmolar aqueous solutions of a complex of manganese(ll) chloride<br>
tetrahydrate and a terpyridine-like ligand, dissolved in a borax buffer of pH 10.0, are<br>
prepared.<br>
For testing the stablity, the solutions are exposed at 40°C to a hydrogen peroxide concentration of 8.6 mM for 30 minutes.<br>
For comparison purposes, a corresponding solution of the unsubstituted terpyridine iigand is prepared (without hydrogen peroxide).<br>
The optical density is determined by means of the respective UVA/IS spectrum at the wavelength indicated in Table 1 below and is a measure of the stability.<br><br>
The Mn complex of formula (137) given in Table 1 below is the compound of formula<br><br>
The above Example shows that the manganese complex with substituted terpyridine has markedly greater stability in comparison with the manganese complex with unsubstituted terpyridine. In the case of the manganese complex with unsubstituted terpyridine, the complex has largely decomposed after 30 minutes, and the UV/VIS spectrum obtained is virtually the same as that of the ligand (terpyridine), whereas the manganese complex with the substituted terpyridine is stable.<br>
Application Example 2: (Bleaching action in washing agents)<br>
7.5 g of white cotton fabric and 2.5 g of tea-stained cotton fabric are treated in 80 ml of washing liquor. The liquor contains a standard washing agent (ECE, 456 IEC) in a concentration of 7.5 g/l. The hydrogen peroxide concentration is 8.6 mmol/l. The catalyst concentration (1:1 complex of manganese(ll) chloride tetrahydrate with the ligand in question, prepared in methanolic solution with the addition of a small amount of lithium hydroxide) is 50 pmol/l. The washing process is carried out in a steel beaker in a LINITEST<br><br>
apparatus for 30 minutes at 40°C. For evaluating the bleaching results, the increase in the lightness DY (difference in lightness according to CIE) of the stains brought about by the treatment is determined spectrophotometrically in comparison with values obtained without the addition of catalyst.<br><br>
Application Example 3: (Cleaning performance on soiled surfaces at 53°C) A tea-stained cup is filled with 100 ml of a buffer solution (10 mM carbonate, pH = 10.0) containing 1.1 mM of hydrogen peroxide and 7.3 pM of 1:1 manganese complex (prepared as described in Application Example 2). Using a thermostat, the temperature of the solution is raised from 23° to 53°C over a period of 12 minutes and maintained at the final temperature for 23 minutes. After rinsing and drying in air, the results are evaluated visually on a scale of 1 (no cleaning) to 10 (clean). The catalyst-free system is used as reference.<br><br><br>
Application Example 4; (Cleaning performance on soiled surfaces at 23°C)<br>
The procedure is as in Application Example 3 but the cleaning is carried out at a constant<br>
temperature of 23°C (duration: 45 minutes).<br><br>
TAED is a commercially available bleach activator which is included in Table 4 for comparison purposes.<br>
Application Example 5: (Decomposition of hydrogen peroxide)<br>
The procedure is as in Application Example 3 but the consumption of H2O2 is determined<br>
iodometrically.<br><br><br>
As can be seen in Table 5, in the case of the use of the 1:1 manganese complex with the substituted terpyridine ligand the undesired decomposition of H2O2 to O2 and H20 is substantially reduced.<br>
Application Example 6: (Activity of the manganese catalysts after the bleaching cycle) The procedure as described in Application Example 2 is carried out for the 1st cycle, the cotton fabric is removed and for the 2nd cycle the procedure is carried out afresh with a new, as yet untreated cotton fabric. The DY values are determined as described in Application Example 2.<br><br>
As can be seen from Table 6, the liquors comprising the manganese complex can be used for further bleaching cycles without any appreciable reduction in the bleaching action.<br>
Application Example 7: (Catalytic bleaching of cellulose)<br>
20 g of cellulose [TPP-CT CSF129, Ref. No. P-178635 (ISO 57.4)] are steeped in a litre of water for 65 hours and then stirred in a mixer for 2 minutes to give a paste-like pulp. A bleaching bath containing 50 g of the pulp so prepared in 180 ml of water, 100 |jM of Dequest 2041 (sequestering agent), 8.6 mM of hydrogen peroxide and 20 pM of catalyst from Example 35 is maintained at 40°C for 30 minutes. At the same time 1N sodium hydroxide solution is metered-in in such a manner that a pH of 10.0 is maintained. Filtration and air-drying are then carried out. A sample that has been compressed to form a circular<br><br>
sheet of 10 cm diameter is then tested for the lightness Y obtained (according to CIEt reflectance spectroscopy). The results are compiled in the following Table.<br><br>
Application Example 8: (Action as catalyst for DTI (dye transfer inhibition))<br>
In accordance with this application, the redeposition of dyes in washing liquors, especially,<br>
should be avoided.	.V   ■<br>
7.5 g of white cotton fabric are treated in 80 ml of washing liquor, the liquor contains a standard washing agent (ECE, 456 IEC) in a concentration of 7.5 g/l. The hydrogen peroxide concentration is 8.6 mmol/l. The catalyst concentration (of manganese(ll) chloride tetrahydrate with the ligand, prepared in methanolic solution with the addition of a small amount of lithium hydroxide) is 50 |jmol/l, and a solution of the test dye Direct Brown 172 having 10 mg/l of the 250% formulation. The washing process is carried out in a steel beaker in a LINITEST apparatus for 30 minutes at 40°C. For testing the activity of the catalysts, the DTI activity is determined. The DTI (Dye Transfer inhibition) activity a is defined as the following percentage.<br>
a = flY(E) - Y(A)] / [Y(W) - Y(A)]) * 100<br>
where Y(W), Y(A) and Y(E) are the CIE lightness values of the white material, of the material treated without the addition of catalyst and of the material treated with the addition of catalyst, in that order, a = 0 denotes a completely inactive product, the addition of which to the washing liquor does not prevent dye transfer, whereas a = 100% corresponds to a perfect catalyst which totally prevents the staining of the white material. The reflection spectra of the samples were measured using a SPECTRAFLASH 2000 and converted into lightness values (D65/10) in accordance with a standard CIE procedure.<br>
A 1:1 manganese complex with ligand L7 gives a value of a = 90 % in accordance with the test procedure described above.<br><br>
Application Example 9: The use of the catalysts according to the invention causes hardly any additional fading of the dyes in dyed cotton laundry. When used as described above in Application Example 8, after treatment five times, on average, virtually no losses of dye are recorded. The values given in the following Table are relative percentage dye losses, determined on the basis of Kubelka-Munk values at the respective absorption maximum.<br><br>
Application Example 10: (Catalytic action for the epoxidation of olefins) 17 mg (0.05 mmol) of 2-[(2-hydroxy-ethyl)-[2,2,;6\2,]teTDyridin^'-yl-amino]-ethanol (L7, Example 7), 10 mg (0.04 mmol) of manganese(ll) acetate tetrahydrate and 0.32 mmol of sodium ascorbate are added to a solution of 1.09 ml (10 mmol) of ethyl acrylate in 0.5 ml of acetonitrile. The mixture is cooled in an ice bath and a 30 % strength hydrogen peroxide solution (2.27 g, 20 mmol) is added dropwise thereto in the course of 20 minutes. The mixture is then left for 14 hours at room temperature, then diluted with diethyl ether and the phases are separated. The organic extract is dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The catalytic turnover number for the epoxide formed, ethyl oxirane-2-carboxylate, is determined by comparing the intensity of the epoxide methine proton at 3.34-3.38 ppm with the ligand signal L7 at 8.53 ppm as reference and is 35±8. Ethyl oxirane-2-carboxylate, epoxide signals 1H-NMR (360 MHz, CDCI3): 2.68-2.89 (m, 2H, CH2); 3.34-3.38 (m, 1H, CH). Without the addition of ligand, epoxide cannot be detected, (see in this connection also Berkessel, A. et at., Tetrahedron Lett. 1999, 40, 7965-7968).<br><br><br><br>
