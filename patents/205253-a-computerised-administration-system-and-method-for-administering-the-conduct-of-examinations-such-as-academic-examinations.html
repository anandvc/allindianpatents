THE CONDUCT OF<br>
EXAMINATIONS SUCH AS<br>
ACADEMIC EXAMINATIONS"<br>

LIMITED; an Indian Company of 80 - A, Collectors Colony, Chembur, Mumbai - 400 074, India;<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is<br>
to be performed.<br><br>
A COMPUTER ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM AND METHOD<br>
FOR ADMINISTERING THE CONDUCT OF EXAMINATIONS<br>
SUCH AS ACADEMIC EXAMINATIONS<br>
The present invention relates to a computerised administration system and method for administering the conduct of examinations such as academic examinations, and in particular to a ay stem and memod for administering the conduct of examinations via a communications network which minimises the possibility of impersonation or other fraudulent behaviour on the part of a candidate or other third party.<br>
The advent of communications networks such as local or wide area networks (LANs/WAN's), intranets and the internet has introduced opportunities for remote access to education and training systems, and such communication networks and systems have proved ideal mediums for distance learning. Using the techniques offered by multicasting and controlled delivery systems such as very small aperture terminals (VSATs), password access and interactivity, it is now possible to enable access to educational and training material from almost any location in the world. However, a significant problem is that of impersonation or other fraudulent behaviour on the part of a candidate or other third party. Accordingly, whilst distance learning has proved very popular, examination and certification of a candidate via these mediums has not<br>
The present invention provides, in a first aspect, a computerised   administration   system   for   administering   the<br><br>
conduct of examinations such as academic examinations, the system comprising: central computer processing means for processing and storing data;<br>
a plurality of local computer processing means physically remote from the central computer processing means for use by examination candidates, each local computer processing means having sampling means for taking identification samples from an examination candidate; and<br>
a communications network connecting the central computer processing means to each of the local computer processing means to facilitate data transfer there between; wherein:<br>
each examination candidate is presented with examination questions which he/she answers by inputting the answers into one of the plurality of local computer processing means; and<br>
during the examination the sampling means of each local computer processing means takes identification samples from each examination candidate at random intervals, the local computer processing means sending the identification samples associated with an examination candidate to the central computer processing means via the communications network together with the examination answers of the said examination candidate.<br>
In a second aspect, the present invention provides a method of administering the conduct of examinations such as academic examinations, the method comprising:<br>
a central administrator using central computer processing means for processing and storing data;<br><br>
examination candidates using a plurality of local computer processing means physically remote from the central computer processing means, each local computer processing means having sampling means for taking identification samples from each examination candidate; and<br>
the central computer processing means and each local computer processing means communicating via a communications network to transfer data there between wherein:<br>
each examination candidate is presented with examination questions which he/she answers by inputting the answers into one of the plurality of local computer processing means; and<br>
the sampling means of each local computer processing means takes identification samples from each candidate at random intervals during the examination/ the local computer processing means sending the identification samples associated with an examination candidate to the central computer processing means via the communications network together with tiie examination answers of the said candidate.<br>
In a third aspect, the present invention provides a program for a computer system which, when loaded on the computer system causes the computer system to function as a computerised administration system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 14.<br>
In a fourth aspect; the present invention provides a program for a computer which, when loaded on the computer,<br><br>
causes the computer to function as a central computer processing means in a computerised administration system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 14.<br>
In a fifth aspect the present invention provides a program for a computer which, when loaded on the computer, causes the computer to function as a local computer processing means in a computerised administration system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 14.<br>
In a sixth aspect the present invention provides an information storage medium for storing a program as claimed in claim 16.<br>
hi a seventh aspect the present invention provides an information storage medium for storing a program as claimed in claim 17.<br>
In an eighth aspect the present invention provides an information storage medium for storing a program as claimed in claim 18.<br>
The present invention also relates to an examination implementation system and an improved method of implementing an examination. More particularly, though not exclusively, the present invention concerns a method for promoting examination centres using a combination of internet technologies and a brick and mortar examination centre in such a way that it (a) minimises the possibility of impersonation and (b)<br><br>
reduces the potential of forged certificates doing the rounds.<br>
The internet is a wonderful medium for distance learning and while distance education is popular, certification over the internet is not<br>
The present invention addresses this problem. One specific way to tackle this problem is to provide internet cyber cafes, which are structured in such a way as to allow for a near foolproof method for certifying students who have studied a particular educational/training course quite well. The present invention provides a central server which is linked to kiosks at examination centres for implementing controlled examinations of students. The central server also acts as a registry of certificates for candidates who have passed the examination.<br>
The concept of a central registry where people can verify the authenticity of the certificate which is presented to a potential employer is new. Currently, the employer writer to the university or examination authority to seek confirmation. That is how fraudulent activity sometimes comes to light Impersonation, however, is far more difficult to detect It would depend on the combination of recording the face (or fingerprint but deciphering a fingerprint is not very easy for most people) and making the owner/manager of the examination centre legally (even financially) responsible for any such acts of negligence or collusion.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, franchised kiosks with<br><br>
terminals are provided which have specific IP addresses which can either be hard coded, or can be registered with set top boxes with specific identification. The franchise is given by the certification authority on the basis of bank performance guarantees, indemnities and other agreements which commit the franchisee to the rules by which an examination may be held/conducted.<br>
The idea to ensure that only those terminals which have received examination fees from students offer the examination 'paper" to the student This can also be achieved through password-enabled access. However, the trouble with mere password enablement is that it does not guarantee the "location" from where die student is appearing for an examination test In the present invention, one can ascertain both the location and the identification of the student The location becomes important to know the place where the examination was offered to the student and the password access ensures that the right student appeared for the examination test<br>
Since a central server and a local examination centre are being used, this process requires each computer in the examination hall to be pre-registered with the server. This way, the contents of the examination cannot be diverted to any other computer, except the one which has the requisite IP address, and the required security codes embedded in both the hardware and the software of the computer. These security measures are available from any large system integrator, and the same are used. For example, in an embodiment of the present invention,<br><br>
VSATs and TV cable delivery channels are used because the process of pro-registering each remote terminal with the central server is mandatory. That is the function of the set-top box in respect of the TV cable content delivery system, and the same is true with computers attached to central servers through VSATs.<br>
At the same time, when the student offers his or her password from the approved location, the examination paper "opens"" at the right time and "closes" at the right time, thereby not allowing for any spillover of tuning. In this way one can also control the exact time, which may be offered to the student to answer the questions given in the examination.<br>
Examinations are carried out under timed conditions. There are certain skill-based examinations, which can be conducted at any time, e.g. certification of Java engineers'* for which the system can allow people to take die test as and when they please. But the duration of the examination is always controlled by the central server. This way, all advantages of a fixed time approach, as well as a flexible time approach are available.<br>
While the candidate appears for the examination, the programme ensures that anywhere between five to ten snapshots of the candidate are taken through the web camera installed atop the computer screen. The snapshots are taken at random moments so mat it becomes difficult for the candidate to predict when the camera will get activated. If at any time the camera is deactivated, the examination paper gets aborted and the test does not go ahead.<br><br>
When the examination paper is over, the mark sheet gets printed out with the five to ten snapshots of the candidates' face/profile. This mark sheet is then signed by the candidate in the presence of the kiosk owner, and the same mark sheet is then countersigned by the kiosk owner as well. Such a process further commits the kiosk owner to the authenticity/bona fides of the candidate/ and any case of impersonation would make the kiosk-owner also liable to civil and criminal proceedings.<br>
These profiles are also stored in a central archive. Each mark sheet has a unique serial number. The idea is to allow prospective employers to verify the bona fides of the certificate by merely logging into the examination authority's web site and typing in the unique aerial number. That should allow the viewer to see the five to ten snapshots of the candidate, his or her signature and the kiosk owner's signature as well. If these tally with those on the actual certificate, the same is genuine. If not it is a forgery.<br>
All the contents used in the present process can be broadly classified under three heads:<br>
a)	Contend that is generated on the fly.<br>
The teacher sits in front of the camera in a studio linked to the hub/server farm; another camera looks down on the sheet of paper where scribbling can take place,<br>
b)	Content in the form of question papers and tests with<br>
their answers.<br><br>
The entire data is more like a question-answer bank which throws up questions at random, allows candidates to check in their right answers and delivers them their scores immediately after the administration of the test/examination is over. The manner in which the answers are to be granted marks (maybe negative marks for wrong answers) is part of a parameterised act up which can be modified from time to time,<br>
c)	Content in the form of a CRM (Customer Relations<br>
Module) which records a candidate's name, address<br>
etc and then logs in details of each course he or she<br>
has opted for, the number of tests he/she has<br>
appeared for, the scores obtained at such tests.<br>
It is this CRM that also decides whether a candidate<br>
has paid for the course or not, whether he/she has access rights<br>
or not It is this CRM that eventually also stores the photo profiles<br>
of each candidate that the web camera takes when he/she starts<br>
answering a question paper. It is this CRM again which decides<br>
on the kind of certificate the candidate must get - the banding of<br>
the certification authority, the serial number and address of the<br>
centre where the test was administered, and the merging of the<br>
photo-profiles with the certification data.     This CRM also<br>
becomes     the     central     registry     where     a     candidate's<br>
marks/certificate details can be verified to ascertain whether the<br>
same is a forged certificate or is genuine.<br>
The web camera is linked to the computer at the kiosk. The kiosk is maintained at a school/college or a commercial premises which has been certified as an examination<br><br>
centre by the network which runs this entire service. Typically "the system can handle examinations for upwards of 5000 colleges and schools.<br>
It is considered that such an examination process allows for a better conduct of examinations across the country and even the world. It allows students in any part of the world to appear for examinations anywhere, provided entrepreneurs are willing to get themselves certified as examination kiosks with examination authorities in any part of the world.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of a preferred embodiment of computerised administration system according to the present invention:<br>
Figure 2 is a detail schematic illustration of the central server of the computerised administration system of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 is a detail schematic illustration of an examination centre of the computerised administration system of Figure 1;<br>
Figures 4a - 4k are schematic illustrations of a method adininistering the conduct of examinations according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figure 5 is a flow chart illustrating &amp; a method of registration of an examination candidate in accordance with the present inventions; and<br><br>
Figure 6 is a flow chart illustrating a method of studying, examination, assessment and certification in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Referring first to Figure 1, there is shown a schematic illustration of a preferred embodiment of computerised administration system according to the present invention. A central server 10 is connected via a communications network 20 to one or more examination centres 30. An examination centre 30 hosts one or more "kiosks" or "workstations' each having a terminal 32 connected to and operating under the control of the central server 10 via the communications network 20. The connection of each terminal 32 to the central server 10 via the communications network may be effected directly (see "examination centre 2") or via an "internal" network (e.g. a LAN, WAN or intranet) at the examination centre 30 (see "examination centres 1" and "3").<br>
It will be appreciated that the schematic illustration of Figure 1 is very simplified and in reality there could be hundreds or even thousands of terminals 32 at each examination/centre 30. Furthermore, the number of examination centres 30 in communication with the central server 10 via the communications network 20 is also variable, from just one to hundreds or even thousands.<br>
An examination centre 30 may be located at a traditional academic institution such as a school, college or university. Alternatively, a cyber-cafe/internet-cafe or other venue may function as an examination centre 30, e.g. as a franchisee. In such a case the franchisee will be issued by a<br><br>
certification authority on the basis of bank performance guarantees, indemnities and other agreements which commit the franchisee to the rules by which examinations may be held/conducted.<br>
In a preferred embodiments the communications network 20 is the internet However, in alternative embodiments the communications network 20 could instead be a LAN, WAN, intranet or other suitable network such as a cable TV network. The choice of network will vary simply in dependence upon the particular system requirements, taking into account existing and/or preferred hardware and software configurations or other factors including whether the system is to have global capability or instead be organisation or site specific (for example).<br>
Figure 2 is a detail schematic illustration of the central server 10 of trie computerised administration system of Figure 1. The central server 10 comprises standard servers or server farms each having individual components well known in the art Accordingly, it will be appreciated that numerous alternative configurations of central server 10 are possible. A central processing unit (CPU) 11 co-ordinates the activity of the central server 10 in accordance with the direction of the software 13. The central server 10 is also provided with memory 12, an input/output interface 16 for coordinating all communication to and from the central server 10 via the communications network 20, an examination database 14 and a candidate database 15.<br>
The examination database 14 contains examination<br><br>
questions which are installed from memory 12 or uploaded via the communications network 20. The CPU 11 and software 13 interrogates the examination database 14 and generates examinations which are downloaded via the input/output interface 16 to the terminals 32 located in the examination centres 30. An examination is sent to all relevant terminals 32 via the communications network 20 under the control of the central server 10.<br>
The candidate database 15 stores details of all candidates registered for examinations, including personal details such as name, age, sex, home/work/contact address and previous qualifications as well as information generated by the central server 10 such as username/ID and password. The candidate database 15 also stores for each candidate a record of previous examinations sat, the corresponding mark sheets generated upon assessment and grading of a candidate's answer, the identification samples taken from the candidate during an examination and certificates for examinations where a candidate has been successful.<br>
Thus, the central server 10 acts as a central registry of certificates for candidates who have passed the examination. The concept of a central registry where certificates are stored and where third parties can verify the authenticity of a certificate (e.g. when presented to a potential employer at interview) is new. Currently, an employer or other interested party writes to the university or examination/certification authority to seek confirmation. This is how fraudulent activity sometimes come to light. Impersonation, however, is far more difficult to detect and is a particular failing of prior art systems.<br><br>
Figure 3 is a detailed schematic illustration of an examination centre 30 of the computerised administration system of Figure 1. The examination centre 30 can be seen to comprise three "kiosks" or "work stations" each having a terminal 32 which comprises a personal computer 33, a web camera 34, and a communications network interface 35. In the examples shown, the three terminals 32 are connected via an internal network 36 at the examination centre 30, which is in turn connected to the communications network 20 via an interface 37 for communication with the central server 10 of the present invention. The terminals 32 provided have specific addresses (e.g. IP addresses where the communications network 20 Is the internet) which can either be hard coded, or can be registered with set top boxes with specific identification. As such, each terminal address can be provided by means of hardware, external device (e.g. set-top box) or even by software (e.g. cookies, embedded links etc.).<br>
Figures 4a-4k are schematic illustrations of a method of administering the conduct of examinations according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In Figure 4a, the candidate can be seen to be completing a registration application form 40 in order to enroll for an examination. This registration application form 40 may be completed manually in paper format or alternatively it may be completed electronically using one of the terminals 32 at an examination centre 30.<br>
In Figure 4b, the candidate provides an examination centre manager with the completed registration application form 40 which is then scrutinised by the examination centre manager. Subject to the examination centre managers satisfaction of the<br><br>
candidate's suitability for the examination/ bearing in mind the candidate's previous academic background/qualifications, and subject to payment of the requisite examination fees, the examination centre manager either accepts or rejects the candidate's registration application. This scrutineering by the examination centre manager is conducted in person at the examination centre 30, either manually or electronically using a terminal 3Z<br>
However, in order for the candidate to be accepted for registration by the central server 10, the signature of both the candidate and the examination centre manager must be provided on the registration application and provided to the central server 10. This is illustrated in figure 4c and is achieved electronically by scanning the requisite registration application form 40 into a terminal 32 or alternatively by soothing in both the signature of the candidate and of the examination centre manager where an electronic registration application form 40 has been completed by the candidate and/or examination centre manager.<br>
Upon receipt of the duly executed registration application 40, the central server 10 determines whether or not the registration application of the candidate is acceptable and if it is, a usemame/ID and password is generated by the central server 10 which is communicated to the candidate for use in the examination. This is illustrated in Figure 4d. The username/ID and password is of course communicated within the central server 10 to the candidate database 15 for storage.<br>
On the day of the examination, the candidate must attend the examination centre 30 in person and is allocated a terminal 32 as illustrated in Figure 4e. The candidate logs into the<br><br>
terminal 32 using his username or ID and password which is communicated to the central server 10 via the communications network 20. The central server 10 checks both the candidate's username or ID and password and the unique identifying address of the terminal 32 against the records held at the central server 10 for verification purposes. If either the username or ID, password or terminal 32 ID s not correct, the central server 10 relays this to the terminal 32 of the candidate and/or to a terminal 32 of the examination centre manager. If a simple error has occurred then this may be corrected upon correct entry of the requisite information by the examination centre manager. If not, the central server 10 flags this error and blocks the terminal 32 and flags the candidate's details stored on the candidate database 15 of the central server 10, preventing the candidate using an alternative terminal 32 until the problem has been resolved to the satisfaction of the central server 10.<br>
In Figure 4f, there is illustrated a terminal 32 which has been successfully logged on by the candidate and accepted by the central server 10 for examination. Accordingly, at the start of the examination the central server 10 delivers the examination to the terminal 32 for the attention of the candidate.<br>
At random intervals throughout the examination, the web camera 34 goes live and takes a snapshot of the candidate, as illustrated in Figure 4g. This is done for the purpose of verifying that the candidate sitting the examination is the genuine candidate and is not being impersonated by a third party. Whilst in the preferred embodiment the method of verification is a web camera taking live snapshots of the candidate, it will be appreciated that other methods of verification such as images of<br><br>
the candidate a retina, fingerprints or other identification means may be employed. In all cases, the identification samples taken throughout the examination are communicated to the central server 10 via the communications network 20 along with the candidate's answer to the examination.<br>
At the end of the examination the central server 10 deactivates the terminal 32 and the screen of the terminal 32 goes blank. The candidate, answer is assessed and graded by the central server 10 and a mark sheet 50 returned to the candidate. The mark sheet 50 may be sent via the communications network 20 to the terminal 32 or examination centre 30 in electronic form for printing out by the examination centre manager or as a printout direct to the candidate. As illustrated in Figure 4h, the mark sheet 50 incorporates the snapshots 51 of the candidate or other identification samples taken during the examination in order to help nuhimise fraudulent activity.<br>
In Figure 4i, an example mark sheet 50 is illustrated which includes the signatures 52,53 of both the candidate and the examination centre manager as provided to the central server 10 on registration of the candidate. Additionally, the mark sheet 50 is provided with a unique serial number 54, as illustrated in Figure 4j, which enables Interrogation of the central server 10 by a third party to verify that the mark sheet 50 possessed by the candidate is in fact a true version of that issued by the central server 10. This is illustrated in Figure 4k where an interviewer is comparing the hard copy of the certificate 50 presented by the candidate at interview with me electronic version 60 held by the central server 10 or other certifying authority. The information held by the central server 10 includes the unique serial number 54<br><br>
assigned to the mark sheet 50. It will be appreciated that the information held by the central server 10 may be provided to other certifying authorities for storage and interrogation purposely particularly in the case where the present invention is implemented on behalf of an examining authority/ e.g. on a contract basis.<br>
It will be appreciated that only those candidates who have paid examination fees are offered the examination via terminals 32. Also, the present invention requires the candidate to use a terminal 32 at an examination centre 30. This could alternatively be achieved through an unassociated terminal using password enabled access. But the trouble with mere password enablement is that it does not guarantee the "location" from where the candidate is appearing for an examination. The present invention ascertains both the location and the identification of the candidate. The location becomes important to know the place where the examination was offered to the candidate and the password access and identification sampling ensures that the right candidate appeared for the examination test<br>
Since a central server 10 and a local examination centre 30 are being used, this system requires terminal 32 in the examination centre 30 to be pre-registered with the central server 10. In this way, the contents of the examination cannot be diverted to any other computer 33, except the one which has the requisite IP address, and the required security codes embedded in both the hardware and the software of the computer 33. These security measures are available from any large system integrator, and the same are used. For example, in an embodiment of the present invention, VSATs and TV cable delivery channels are<br><br>
used because the process of pre-registering each remote terminal with the central server is mandatory. That is the function of the set-top box in respect of the TV cable content delivery system, and the same is true with computers attached to central servers through VSATs.<br>
At the same time, when the candidate offers his or her password from an approved location, the examination "opens" at the right time and "closes" at the right time, thereby not allowing for any spillover of timing. This way one can also control the exact time which may be offered to the candidate to answer the questions given in the examination. While the candidate appears for the examination, the programme ensures that typically between five to ten snapshots of the candidate are taken through the web camera installed atop the computer screen. The snapshots are taken at random moments so that it becomes difficult for the candidate to predict when the camera will get activated. If, at any time the camera is deactivated, the examination paper gets aborted and the test does not go ahead.<br>
Examinations are carried out under timed conditions. There are certain skill based examinations conducted at any time, e.g. certification of Java engineers, fro which the system can allow people to take the test as and when they please. But the duration of the examination is always controlled by the central server 10. This way, all the advantages of a fixed time approach, as well as a flexible time approach are available.<br>
All the content used in the system can be broadly<br>
classified under three heads:<br>
a)	Content that is generated on the fly.<br>
The teacher sits in front of a camera in a studio<br><br>
linked to the central hub/server farm 10; another camera looks down on the sheet of paper where scribbling can take place.<br>
b)	Content in the form of question papers and tests with<br>
their answers.<br>
The entire data is more like a question-answer bank which throws up questions at random, allows candidates to check in their right answers and delivers them their scores immediately after the administration of the test/examination is over. The manner in which the answers are to be granted marks (maybe negative marks for wrong answers) is part of a parameterised set up which can be modified from time to time.<br>
c)	Content in the form of a CRM (Customer Relations<br>
Module) which records a candidate's name, address<br>
etc and men logs in details of each course he or she<br>
has opted for, the number of tests he/she has<br>
appeared for, the scores obtained at such tests.<br>
It is this CRM that also decides whether a candidate has paid for the course or not, whether he has access rights or not It is this CRM that eventually also stores the photo-profiles of each candidate that the web camera takes when he/she starts answering a question paper. It is this CRM again which decides on the kind of certificate the candidate must get - the branding of the certification authority, the serial number and address of the centre where the test was administered, and the merging of the photo-profiled with the certification data. This CRM also becomes the central registry where a candidate's marks/certificate details can be verified to ascertain whether the same is a forged certificate or is genuine.<br>
Figure 5 is a flow chart illustrating a method of<br><br>
registration of an examination candidate in accordance with the present invention. The registration method 100 starts with step 101, which is an enquiry from a prospective student In response to this enquiry, step 102, the examination centre provider information on various courses to the candidate which is followed by step 103 where the candidate's profile is matched with course requirements. At step 104, if the candidate's profile does indeed match the course requirements then at step 105 the candidate fills out the registration application form. Otherwise, should the candidate's profile not match the course requirements, the candidate is disqualified at step 111. At step 106, it is decided whether or not the candidate is registering on a certification course and if so at step 107, the candidate's money for registration and course examination, is received. Alternatively, if the candidate is not registering for a certification course, at step 112, money is received from the candidate for registration only. At step 108, the candidate is registered in the candidate database 15 for the enrolled course. The central server 10 then allocates a username/ID and password at step 109 and this ends the registration application method 100 of the candidate at step 110.<br>
Figure 6 is a flow chart illustrating a method of studying, examination, assignment and certification in accordance with the present invention. The process 200 begins at step 201 where the candidate is provided with a multicasting view which can include an instructor, a learning application and/or a chat session. The studying process of step 202 then follows in which a self assessment clearance stop 203 is assessed. If the candidate clears the self assessment then completion of the required module is assessed at step 204.   If completion of the<br><br>
required module is not yet effected, then the process returns to the study process 202. In tiie alternative where the completion of the required module is accepted, the next step 205 is an assessment test whereupon the candidate logs into the examination centre 30 using his or her username/ID and password at step 206. The assessment examination for each module then appears on the terminal 32 at step 207 during which the candidate answers tiie examination. At tiie end of the examination at step 208, the screen of the terminal 32 goes blank and the mark sheet 50 is printed together with the snapshots of the candidate. At step 209 the printed mark sheet 50 with its unique serial number 54 is presented to the candidate. The next step 210 determines whether this assessment is the end of the entire curriculum and if not the process returns to step 202, the studying process. Alternatively, if the assessment does mark the end of the entire curriculum at step 210, the process passes to step 211 where a qualification certificate incorporating the candidate's photograph is produced. Next, at step 202, tiie database is updated.<br>
If at step 203 the self assessment is not cleared, then the process passes to step 220 and the candidate continues the studying process. At step 221 the validity of the studying time is decided and if it has not yet expired then the process returns to the studying process at step 202. However, if the validity of the studying time is indeed over, then the student is notified at step 222. If the candidate is eligible for additional hours of studying, which is assessed at step 223, then the candidate is notified at step 224 of the requirements for additional money to be paid. Alternatively, if the candidate is not eligible for additional hours<br><br>
of studying, then this is notified to the candidate at step 227. At step 225, a check is made that money is received for a candidate who is eligible for additional hours of studying as determined at step 223, and provided the money is received the process passes to step 226 where the studying time validity of the candidate is increased. In the alternative, or where money is not receive at step 225, the candidate is notified accordingly at step 227.<br>
Additional instruction is provided at steps 230 where lectures at a studio are provided, and also at step 231 where interactive chat sessions are provided. These two steps key in with the studying process 202.<br>
The identification sampling of the candidate is described at steps 240 and 241 where the web camera goes live and takes a snap shot of the candidate. At step 241, if the snap shot matches the pre-registered photo of the candidate, then this is notified to the central server 10 and the assessment test 205 continues in the normal way. Otherwise, at step 242 action is taken with the examination centre 30 and student and this is flagged to the central server 10 and additionally noted on the printed mark sheet 50 at step 209.<br>
Finally, courses and assessment tests provided on the web at step 250 May be provided to update the database 212.<br>
It will be appreciated that this system is unique in that there is:<br>
(a)	the      combination      of      pro-registration      and<br>
authentication, post-registration authentication, and a mark sheet with the pre - and post-registration images (of signature and face) being printed on the mark sheet itself for easy verification.<br><br>
(b)	provision of a means to crosscheck the genuineness<br>
of the certificate by viewing the same on the website through the unique serial number.<br>
It is considered that such a computerised administration system allows for a better conduct of examinations across the country and even the world. It allows candidates in any part of the world to appear for examinations anywhere, provided entrepreneurs are willing to have themselves certified as examination centres with examination authorities in any part of the world.<br><br>
