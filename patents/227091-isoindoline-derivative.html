ISOINDOLINE DERIVATIVES FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel isoindoline derivatives.  The derivatives of the invention are useful for manufacturing pharmaceutical compositions, especially anesthetics. RELATED ART<br>
Many compounds having isoindoline structure have been reported to have effects on central nerves system. Most of those reports aimed for developing tranquilizers, antispasmodics or anxiolytics (Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Nos. 47-12322 and 58-189163). Heretofore, no isoindoline derivative having anesthetic property has been reported.<br>
As for agents affecting on the CNS, especially intravenous anesthetics, rapid induction and recovery from anesthesia are desired. In order to prepare an injectable dosage form, the anesthetic compounds are also desired to be water-soluble. However, clinically used anesthetic compounds, for example propofol (2, 6-diisopropylphenol) , are slightly water-soluble and thus, the clinically used intravenous anesthetics are provided in the form of emulsion with soy-oil, glycerin and purified egg phospholapid. Due to the formulation, the clinical<br>
intravenous products have side effects such as venous pain during injection and lipid deposition as well as high susceptibility to microbial infection.<br>

(Table 9 Removed)<br>
Therapeutic index (T.I.) of the compound was determined. The HD50 value, the minimum dose at which at least 30 seconds loss of righting reflex were observed in 50% of the injected mice, and the LD50 value, the 50% lethal dose were determined. Then the T.I. of LD50/HD5o was obtained,. Results are shown in Table 10. For the comparison purpose, the T.I. of clinically used intravenous anesthetics, propofol and thiopental sodium, which were disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 50-<br><br><br>
154410, are shown in the table.<br>
Table 10 (Table 10 Removed)<br>
As shown in table 10, the 50% lethal dose (LD50) of the test compound is much higher than the HD50, which is an indicator of the anesthetic action, and the highest LD50 among the test compounds was more than 120mg/kg (i.v.). This means that the anesthetic composition of the invention has a very wide safety margin. Propofol and thiopental sodium, most popular anesthetics, have significantly narrower safety margins.<br>
Anesthesia induction time, the time from the complete injection of the compound (2 x HD50) to loss of righting reflex, and after wake-up recovery time, the time from righting reflex was back to normal to the animal started to move spontaneously were determined. The results are shown in Table 11.<br><br>
Table 11(Table 11 Removed) As shown in table 11, the isoindoline derivatives of the invention can provide rapid induction and recovery from anesthesia.<br><br><br><br>
