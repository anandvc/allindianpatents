The present invention relates to a godet for heating and advancing a yam.<br>
During the production of a yam, in particular a synthetic filament yam, a yam is guided over a heated godet and is advanced by same. For a constant quality of yam, it is necessary to keep the godet unit at a constant temperature. Known from DE 36 21 397 is a godet for heating and advancing yams in a heated godet jacket, which is arranged on a drive shaft. The temperature of the godet jacket is determined by means of one temperature sensor or several temperature sensors on the godet jacket The temperature distribution in the axial direction of the godet is tranamitted by means of a noncontacting inquiry of the measured data to an electronic control unit. The entire sequence of data inquiry, calibration, inquiry frequency, activation of the measuring sensors, and the like is predetermined permanently by the circuit. Errors, faulty controls and the like can be detected only momentarily.<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention to further develop the known godet unit for heating and advancing synthetic filament yams such that the temperature measuring operation can be adapted to the different requirements. A further object is to detect also temporarily occurring deviations from the desired operation and to store same for a later inquiry. A<br><br>
further object is to simplify the diagnostics on the godet.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the object is achieved with a godet unit having the characteristic features of claim 1. Advantageous further developments are subject matter of the dependent claims.<br>
The godet unit of the present invention for heating and advancing yams with a heatable godet jacket is characterized in that the godet unit is provided with an integrated electronic monory.<br>
Dependent on the yam to be produced, the production process, and/or the range of application of a godet within the production process, such a godet unit has to be adapted to a specific task. The use of the godet unit in accordance with the invention simplifies its productioa, since it is possible to define or program the specific fimctions of the godet after prodoctioQ when same is delivered or assembled, and to state the data in the meoxMy. The memory may also be used to make changes of the specific functioas on site, so that within the scope of certain limits it is not necessary to exchange the godets.<br>
The use of a memory in the godet unit, in particular in its totaling<br>
portion, allows to store now likewise calibration values for difforent ambient<br>
temperatures. To this ead. Sot example in a test operation, Ifae temperature<br>
on the outer jacket of the godet is measured with an external temperature<br>
sensor. From the comparison of the mtemal and external temperatures, the<br>
calibration value is obtained In the memory, it is possible to store not only<br>
calibration values for dcQbreot ambient temperatures, but also values for<br>
different load coodifioos. This enables a projection of the temperature on<br>
the outer godet jacket fifcm internal measuring data under different load<br>
situations. This is	<br><br>
especially important for increasing requirements with respect to the yarn quality.<br>
The memory may also be used to register temporary malfunctions within the godet.  Such malfunctions may be changes in voltage and current conditions, which are caused, for example, by loose contacts, temperature sensor breakages, or short circuits. The occurring malfunctions within a godet may he caused not only by the temperature sensors, but also by the commonly used electric heaters.<br>
The memory may also be used to identify and observe a godet.  This has the advantage that the behavior of the godet during the operation may be stored over longer periods of time, and that these operational values may then be evaluated as empirical values for the construction of further godets.<br>
The memory may be inquired at random or predetermined time intervals.  This possibility of inquiry has the advantage that no data receiver need be ready for permanent reception.<br>
The arrangement of the memory on a rotating component has the advantage that the memory can be linXed to and supplied by the electronic system that is integrated in the godet.  Thus, the stored data remains always with the godet unit.  The stationary electronic system could also be accommodated with a control unit in a control cabinet.<br>
In accordance with an advantageous further development, it is proposed to arrange the memory on the drive shaft of the godet, preferably such that the memory is positioned symmetrically with respect to the longitudinal axis of the drive shaft.  This allows to reduce the uneven centrifugal forces caused by the memory, so as to make a balancing of the godet unnecessary.  The arrangement of the memory on the drive shaft has also the<br><br>
advantage that the memory is relatively far reaoved from the hot godet jacket.  The memory may be positioned also on the drive shaft outside of the godet jacket, thereby minimizing the thermal load of the memory.  This arrangement has also the advantage that the memory is located essentially outside of the electromagnetic fields of an electric heater.  This allows to minimize the possibility of an operational malfunction of the memory by strong electromagnetic fields, and to eliminate a     ^ shielding of the memory against the electromagnetic fields.<br>
Instead of arranging the memory on the drive shaft, it is alternatively suggested that same be mounted on the godet jacket. This suggestion takes into account that the godet jacket is exchangesible relative to the stationary portion of the godet, and that the characteristics, in particular the temperature transmitting characteristics of a godet jacket change in the course of the operation by contamination and/or wear. However, it should also be considered that, despite the total identity of several processing stations, the heating efJfect of the godets may be quite different at the processing stations, not only as a result of the different conditions of wear and soiling on the godets, but also due to different losses in heat caused by an air flow.  A memory that is exchangeable along with the godet jacket contains all these data.<br>
The invention is especially advantageous for so-called multi-zone godets, which have heating zones that can be controlled independently of each other, with at least one temperature sensor being associated to each heating zone.  In this instance, it is possible to predetermine, individually and as a function of the respective individual requirements, in particular the<br><br>
inquiry cycle and inquiry frequency in the individual zones by a programming on each godet.<br>
In accordance with a further, advantageous idea, it is proposed to connect the memory to an electronic microprocessor for the inquiry and or supply of data.  The microprocessor is a part of a data transmission unit that is connected to the godet.<br>
It is preferred that the data transmission unit be noncontacting.  In this instance, the transmission of data from the memory can also occur during the operation of the godet. Advantageously, the transmission of data from a rotating to a stationary component may occur with the use of a stationary primary coil and a rotating secondary coil.  This arrangement enables a transmission of the data as voltage pulses in serial and digital form.<br>
An advantageous further development of the godet unit exists with the use of a data transmission unit designed and constructed in accordance with claim 11-Arranged between the rotating components and the stationary components of the godet unit is thus only one transmitter which transmits both the energy and the^data. In this instance, the voltage pulses of the data signals are superimposed over the supply energy, so that a clear association of the data signal exists, and disturbing influences from the supply energy are eliminated.<br>
The godet unit of claim 12 enables a constant transfer of data from the temperature sensor or the measuring sequence to the control unit.  In accordance with the invention, it is possible to transmit all data on the inductive path of the energy supply, which is formed by a stationary primary coil and a rotating secondary coil. The provision of only one transmitter in the godet unit results in a low susceptibility to malfunction and, thus, in a reliable operation.  Temporarily occurring<br><br>
deviations can be transmitted directly to the control unit and be controlled accordingly.<br>
Advantageously the digital data are transmitted as a sequence of voltage pulses. The voltage pulses may be generated directly in the secondary circuit of the voltage supply, in that simply an additional load, for example, a resistor with a predetermined frequency, is interposed in the circuit.<br>
The significance of the respective pulse depends on which shape the pulses have.  A further, advantageous possibility of coding the binary content of the data lies in the variation of the nmnber of pulses occurring in each predetermined cycle. This form of data transmission allows to eliminate disturbing influences, which can affect the accuracy of the transmission.  In the coding of the data, it has been found that in particular the modulation of the pulse duration is advantageous.  Since the height of amplitude of the transmission frequency is not important in this instance, it is thus possible to prevent further disturbing influences.<br>
As a result of superimposing the voltage pulses, a.nd since the transmission frequency, which is, for example, 10 3cHz, differs from the primary frequency, which is, for example 80 IcHz, it is possible to decode the transmitted data flow, irrespective of the distance, by a specially combined filter circuit with a comparator.<br>
In accordance with the invention, digital data of any kind can also be transmitted from the stationary component to the rotating component of the godet linit, the data transmission occurring by frequency modulation.  In this instance, the data transmission and the energy supply may occur with one transmitter.  The primary frequency of the energy supply is varied between two values, and a digital value is associated to each of the two frequencies. Since the eunplitude of the frequency is<br><br>
irrelevant,  fluctuations  of the  amplitude  are  of no  importance  during the transmission of data.<br>
The special advantage of this godet unit lies in that it enables a controlled influence by the control unit on the measuring sequence. Furthermore, it is possible, for example, after an exchange of the godet jacket, to input new calibration data and/or process data in the rotating memory. In addition, it is possible to present new inquiry programs or figures during the operation.<br>
For identifying the frequencies, at which data are transmitted, at least one frequency recognition unit is provided. Advantageously, same way may be designed and constructed in the form of an electronic microprocessor, which recognizes the frequency based on a measurement of the current or voltage, and which decodes the data. The fi-equency, at which the data are transmitted, may be varied, for example, between 40 and 80 kHz. Suitably, the one primary frequency is half as much as the other primary frequency. This firequency may be realized by a frequency divider.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a godet for heating and advancing a yam, — comprising a stationary support member; a rotatable member rotatably mounted to said stationary support member and having a tubular jacket having an outer surface upon which the yam is adapted to run, means for heating the jacket, at least one sensor mounted to said rotatable member for sensing the temperature of said jacket and producing an output signal indicative thereof; data transmission means for transmitting by induction the output signal from said one sensor to an external control unit, and an electronic memory mounted to one of said stationary support member and said rotatable member, with said memory being electrically connected to said temperature sensor such that the memory can store at least a portion of the output signal from the sensor to the control unit.<br><br>
Further advantages and characteristics of the invention are described with reference to an embodiment illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which;<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic view of a path of a yam over two godets;<br>
Figure 2 is an axial sectional view of a godet unit;<br>
Figure 3 shows the circuitry in the rotating componoit of Hat godet unit; and<br>
Figure 4 is a schematic view of a circuitry for a data transmission between the stationary component and &amp;e rotatti^ coDpooent of a god^ unit<br>
Shown in Figure 1 is a path of a yam 1, which is advanced and heated<br>
by two heated godets 2 and 3. In so doing, the yam loops about each godet 2<br>
and 3 in	'- '-"■■		■	<br><br>
several winds, and it is gxiided within each wind by a guide roll 4, 5 which is arranged axially inclined relative to the godet.<br>
Shown in Figure 2 is an enlarged axial sectional view of a godet unit 2 or 3.  The godet unit 2 consists of stationary and rotating components.  The stationary components include a housing 6 that it fixedly connected with a machine frame (not shown).<br>
Arranged on housing 6 is a disk-shaped holder 7. A sleeve 8 extends through the center of holder 7.  Lined up along sleeve 8 are several, in the present embodiment four, lamellar supports 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4. The lamellar supports consist of a plurality of thin sheet metal plates, each being arranged in an axial plane of sleeve a. Fixedly mounted on lamellar supports 9.1 ... 9.4 are induction coils 10.1-10.4.  Consequently, four pairs of lamellar supports and induction coils are arranged on sleeve 8.  For a radial magnetic flux in godet jacket 12, lateral spacers 11 are provided, which are arranged between adjacent coils.  The induction coils 10.1-10.4 can be supplied with a current of a predetermined frequency, and they can be controlled each individually.<br>
The rotating components include godet jacket 12, which is arranged on the front end of a drive shaft 14. As can be noted from the illustration in Figure 2, the godet jacket 12 is connected with drive shaft 14 in form-locking or frictional engagement.  The drive shaft 14 extends concentrically with sleeve 8, and is driven for rotation by a motor 15 stationarily installed in housing 6.<br>
The godet jacket 12 accommodates several temperature measuring sensors 16.1-16.4, one measuring sensor 16 being provided for each induction coil 10.  Each temperature sensor is arranged in godet jacket 12 above its associated induction coil.  The output signals of the<br><br>
temperature sensors 16.1-16.4 are amplified and converted<br>
into a digital signal.  These digital signals are coded in<br>
a sequence of voltage pulses and transmitted stationarily<br>
by an inductive measured data transmitter 17, and they are<br>
converted in a display \init into an analogous, readable<br>
signal, or however, they are used to control induction<br>
coils 10.1 or 10.2 or 10.3 or 10.4.  In this manner, the<br>
temperature measured on the individual sensors 16.1-16.4<br>
is controlled to a desired value.	»<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the circuitry in the rotating component of the godet vmit.  In this circuit arrangement, the measuring sequence with temperature sensors 16.1 and 16.2 as well as fixed-value resistors 29 and 30 are energized by a source of current 28.  The fixed-value resistors 29.1 and 29.2 define the measuring range. As an output signal of the temperature sensors 16.1 and 16.2 the voltage drop is measured and supplied to a multiplexer 32.  From the multiplexer, the signals are supplied via an amplifier 33 to an analog-digital converter 18.  For a zero shift, the analogrdigital converter receives a signal from fixed-value resistors 3 0.1 and 30.2. In the amalog-digital converter, the analog measuring signals are converted to digital values and supplied to microprocessor 19.  The microprocessor 19 is connected with an electronic memory 20, so that the data can be stored in the memory. However, the microprocessor 19 can also retrieve data stored in the memory 20, such as, for example, calibration values, inquiry programs, and process data,  via a line 27, the microprocessor 19 supplies the data to a data transmission ujiit. In this connection, the microprocessor 19 functions as a data input unit and a data output unit for memory 20. The data from a controller (not shown) enter, via a line 26, into the microprocessor 19, and from there into memory 20.<br><br>
r.ange.  in the event of temperature fluctuations in the circuit, it would however be also possible to input previously determined correction values in the individual electronic components.<br>
A comparator 34 detects/ whether the current flow through the measuring sequence is within its predetermined range.  Its signal is supplied to microprocessor 19.<br>
The circuit diagrsun of Figure 4 illustrates the inductive supply of power to the measuring sequence as well as the therein contained data transmission unit.  In this arrangement, a primary coil 22 with its associated circuit is mounted on holder 7.  A secondary coil 21 with its associated circuit is mounted on godet jacket 12.  To supply voltage, primary coil 22 receives in rectangular shape alternating ciirrent at a frequency of, for example, 80 kHz, that is predetermined by a frequency changer 35. The voltage induced in secondary coil 21 is rectified via a diode 37 and a rectifier 38, and it is fed via a voltage regulator 39 to supply the measuring sequence.<br>
The data transmission unit provides that the data line 27 proceeding from microprocessor 19 (note Figure 3) leads to a switch 42.  The switch 42 opens and closes as a function of the data signal, so that a voltage pulse is generated as a result of additional load 41 when the switch is closed. Thus, a sequence of voltage pulses is formed, which is supplied at a transmission frequency determined by microprocessor 19 by means of secondary coil 21 and transmitted to primary coil 22. The binary' content of the data can be coded by the shape of the generated pulses or by the number of pulses for each predetermined cycle. In this connection, a cycle is selected with a constant time, which is independent of the transmission frec[uency. The shape of the voltage pulses may be modulated by the pulse duration or the pulse<br><br>
height.  The binary content of each pulse {0 or 1) can thus be determined either from the pulse width, the pulse height, the number of pulses per cycle/ or from the spacing of the pulses per cycle.  This digital form of the transmission allows to eliminate disturbing influences which could affect the accuracy of the transmission.  The transmission voltage overlies the primary voltage by induction.  The transmission frequency is, for exsunple, lo kHz.  To recover the transmission signal, primary curreijt fluctuations are supplied to measuring resistor 43.  The thus-generated voltage pulses are supplied to a filter 44. The filter 44 filters out the high primary frequency, for example, 80 kHz. The filtered signal is supplied to a second filter 45, which smooths the low frequencies.  Both signals are supplied to comparator 23, which decodes the transmitted signals and supplies same to a control unit. The transmission of data from the control unit (stationary component) to memory 20 (rotating component) or to microprocessor 19 occurs such that the digital signals are supplied to a changeover switch 36.  By means of changeover switch 3 6 the primary frequency is varied between two specific values.  In this connection, it has been found advantageous that the second value of the primary frequency is exactly half the primary frequency. Thus, for example, the primary frequency could vary between 80 kHz and 40 kHz. Subsequently, a digital value is associated to each of the two Trequencies. Thus, primary coil 22  receives an alternating current of different frequencies. The induced voltage pulses in the secondary coil are supplied to a frequency recognition unit 25, which associates a digital value to the respective freqpiency. Instead of measuring the voltage, the frequency recognition unit can identify the frequency of means of a current measurement. A further possibility consists of counting the pulses per unit time. Converter<br><br>
40 converts the serial digital values into parallel data, and supplies same to the microprocessor, or directly to memory 20. The frequency recognition may also be performed directly by microprocessor 19.<br><br><br><br>
