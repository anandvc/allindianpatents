				<td>This  invention relates to a  faulty  packets rejection  device.  The device is used at the  discharge<br>
end  of  a packaging machine for  rejecting  the  faulty, packets.  The device can also be used at the infeed  end<br>
of down stream secondary packaging machine linked to the primary  packaging  machine specifically in  case  of  a<br>
pouch packing machine for biscuits.<br>
The  faulty  packets rejection system  is  as such  known in the art.   This system comprises a  photo<br>
electric  sensor  provided near the discharge  belt  for sensing the faulty packet i.e. jointed packets such that<br>
to convey the signals to fast acting pneumatic  cylinder provided  with  the  machine so as to  push  the  faulty<br>
packet  into  the  rejection  chute  of  the   packaging machine.<br>
There are some disadvantages associated  with<br>
the faulty packet rejection system of the known art. One of  the  main  disadvantage is that the  action  of  the<br>
pneumatic  pusher  has to be very fast as  the  distance between  the two packets is negligible and  the  packets<br>
are  conveyed  on the conveyor belt S  120  packets  per minute, which is very difficult to get.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the packets are conveyed on the belt by friction and push action for<br>
rejection is at the right angle to the conveyor belt movement and thus the orientation of the packets on the<br>
belt is disturbed and therefore the packets got jamed in the side guides.<br>
Therefore  the main object of this  invention<br>
is to propose a device for use with a packaging  machine for  the  rejection of the faulty  packets,  and   which<br>
obviates   the disadvantages associated with  the  prior art.<br>
Another  object  of  this  invention  is   to<br>
propose a device for use with a pouch packaging  machine to  discharge the faulty packets having the means  which<br>
do not  disturb the orientation of the packets  on  the conveyor be1t.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a  faulty  packet  rejection  system  for  use   at  the discharge  end of a packaging machine comprising a  belt conveyor  for  conveying  the packets  from  the   pouch<br>
packaging   machine,   characterised   in   that   means<br>
consisting of a bracket adapted to be operated by pneumatic cylinder secured with the frame of the<br>
machine, a lever being secured with said bracket such that to stop the packet for making stack or to reject as<br>
faulty packet, a photo sensor being provided below the conveyor belt such that to sense the existence of the<br>
faulty packet and to convey signals to operate the said bracket.<br>
In accordance with this invention the  faulty<br>
packet rejection system comprises a bracket adapted to be moved in the upward and downward direction by means<br>
of a pneumatic cylinder secured with the main frame of the pouch packaging machine. A lever is pivotly secured<br>
to the bracket such that to act as a stopper in order to make the stack of the pouches. A spring is provided<br>
between the upper arm of the lever and the bracket such that to keep the lever always in the downward position.<br>
A photosensor is provided near the conveyor belt of the machine so as to sense the existence of the faulty<br>
packet or jointed packet and to provide the signals to the pneumatic cylinder to lift the bracket as well as<br>
the lever so as to allow the passage of the faulty/jointed packet to go to the rejection chute of<br>
the machine.<br>
A  faulty packet rejection system for  use  • packaging machine according to a preferred embodiment is herein  described  and illustrated in  the  accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Fig.  1  shows  the  plane view  of  the  faulty  packet rejection system.of the known art and<br>
Fig. 2 shows the plane view of the faulty packet  system of the present invention<br>
Referring to the drawings particularly fig. 1 the  faulty  packet rejection system has  faulty  packet rejector  R  adapted to be operated by means of  a  fast acting pneumatic cylinder A provided in the proximity of the  belt  conveyor C.  A photosensor B  being  provided near  the  conveyor  belt  C such  that  to  detect  the<br>
existence of the faulty/jointed packet P on the conv»yor belt C and to convey the signals to operate fast  acting<br>
cylinder  A in order to push the faulty packet P in  th« rejection chute RC from the conveyor belt C.<br>
Reference  is  now  made  to   fig.  2,   the faulty/jointed packet rejection system comprises a  belt<br>
conveyor C for conveying the packet P received from  the pouch  making  machine in the  conventional  manner.   A<br>
photosensor  8 is provided near the conveyor belt C  for detecting the presence of the faulty packet on the  belt<br>
C.  These  features  do  not  constitute  the  inventive features according to this invention.<br>
Specifically   in   accordance   with    this invention  the  faulty  packet rejection  system  has  a bracket  1 adapted to be moved up and down by  means  ofr pneumatic  cylinder  3 provided with the  frame  of  the machine.  A lever 2 having a roller secured at the lower end  thereof  rotatably  is  secured  pivotly  with  the bracket  1  at the bottom end thereof.  A  spring  6  is provided between the bracket 1 and the top arm 2A of the lever  2  to  keep the lever 7 always  in  the  downward position.  An adjusting screw 5 is provided to keep  the pressure of the lever 2 on the conveyor belt as per  the requirement.   The  roller  7 is provided  to  keep  the packet  in  the  moving position even if  the  lever  is supported  on the packet.  However, the packet is not  a faulty  packet.   As soon as the packet  passed  through the  lever 2, the lever 2 moves down to act as a  packet stopper for making the stack of the packets P.<br>
During the operation of the machine lever 2 act as a stopper to facilitate the formation of the<br>
stack of the packets. In case of a faulty packet the photosensor sense it and send the signals to operate the<br>
pneumatic cylinder so as to lift the bracket/lever to allow the passage of the packet into the rejection chute<br>
of the machine.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
1 CLAIM; 1.     A faulty packet rejection system for use  at  the<br>
discharge  end of a packaging machine comprising a  balt conveyor  for  conveying  the packets  from  the  ,pouch<br>
packaging   machine,   characterised   in   that   means consisting   of  a  bracket adapted to  be  operated  by<br>
pneumatic  cylinder  secured  with  the  frame  of   the machine,  a lever being secured with said  bracket  such<br>
that to stop the packet for making stack or to reject as faulty  packet, a photo sensor being provided below  the<br>
conveyor  belt such that to sense the existence  of  the faulty packet and to convey signals to operate the  said<br>
bracket.<br>
2.	A  faulty packet rejection system as  claimed  in<br>
claim  1 wherein said lever has a roller secured at  the<br>
lower  end  thereof  rotatably, a   spring  is  provided<br>
between the upper arm of said lever and said bracket  to<br>
keep the lever always into the  downward position.<br>
3.	A  faulty packet rejection system as  claimed  in<br>
claim 1 wherein an adjusting screw is provided with said<br>
bracket  to adjust the pressure of said lever  onto  the conveyor belt.<br>
