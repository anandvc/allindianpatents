				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Description:<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for the manufacture of a spunbond web<br>
made of filaments. The filaments consist typically of a thermoplastic resin.<br>
An apparatus of the above-mentioned type is known in different embodiments<br>
that are used in practice. The filaments are spun first with the help of a<br>
spinneret, and then are usually passed through a cooling chamber. After<br>
cooling, the filaments or the filament bundle reach a stretching passage of a<br>
stretching unit in which they are stretched aerodynamically. The transverse<br>
width of the stretching passage in the machine or travel direction of the spinning<br>
fleece is here normally 10-20 mm. Because of this relatively small dimension,<br>
the filament bundle in the stretching unit is compacted relatively strongly. This<br>
has the disadvantage, in many known installations, that the filaments can be<br>
separated only with considerable difficulty and deposited as individual filaments.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide an apparatus of the type mentioned<br>
above by means of which the filament bundle produced can be separated in a<br>
simple and effective manner into individual filaments that can then be deposited<br>
for the spunbond web.<br>
To attain this object, the invention proposes an apparatus for the continuous<br>
manufacture of a spunbond web from filaments, wherein<br>
a spinneret for producing the filaments is provided, downstream of the spinneret<br>
is a cooling chamber that is supplied with process air to cool the filaments,<br>
a stretching unit for stretching the filaments is connected to the cooling<br>
chamber,<br><br>
a connection region between the cooling chamber and the stretching unit is<br>
closed,<br>
the stretching unit has a stretching passage whose passage walls diverge over<br>
at least a part of the length of the stretching passage, and<br>
a depositing device for the deposition of the filaments for the spunbond web is<br>
provided.<br>
A spinneret is in particular a spinneret that spins the filaments. The spun<br>
filaments are then fed through the cooling chamber in which the cooling of the<br>
filaments takes place. It is within the scope of the invention that the cooling<br>
chamber is a closed chamber that, in addition to the process air intake, and in<br>
addition to the inlet opening and outlet opening for the filament band, is closed<br>
or substantially closed. According to the invention, the connection region<br>
between the cooling chamber and the stretching unit is closed. In the<br>
connection region or the transition region between the cooling chamber and the<br>
stretching unit there is thus, according to the invention, no air feed or<br>
substantially no air feed into the system or into the flow path of the filaments.<br>
In the context of the invention, a diverging design of the passage walls of the<br>
stretching passage means in particular that the passage walls are<br>
arranged/designed to diverge transversely to the machine direction or<br>
transversely to the spunbond web. The spacing between these passage walls<br>
increases in the diverging section in the direction toward the depositing device.<br>
The length of the stretching passage moreover means the extent of the<br>
stretching passage between the cooling chamber and the depositing device.<br>
The diverging part of the stretching passage is also referred to below as the<br>
diverging stretching passage section or in brief as the diverging section.<br><br>
A greatly preferred embodiment of the invention is characterized in that the<br>
cooling chamber is subdivided into at least two cooling compartments, in which<br>
the filaments in each case can be cooled with process air at a different<br>
temperature. This special embodiment has been found to be particularly<br>
advantageous in the scope of the invention. According to an embodiment, the<br>
temperature of the fed process air in the upstream upper cooling compartment<br>
is higher than the temperature of the fed process air in the lower downstream<br>
cooling compartment. The upstream upper cooling compartment here relates to<br>
the cooling compartment into which the filaments enter first.<br>
According to the invention, the connection region between the cooling chamber<br>
and the stretching unit is closed. The stretching unit is thus connected to the<br>
cooling chamber with the condition that no introduction of air or substantially no<br>
introduction of air takes place in the connection region between the cooling<br>
chamber and the stretching unit. The stretching unit can here be connected<br>
directly to the cooling chamber without any air-feed slit. According to a third<br>
embodiment of the invention, an intermediate passage is arranged between the<br>
cooling chamber and the stretching unit. Here, the fact that no air is introduced<br>
from the outside or substantially no air is introduced from the outside into this<br>
intermediate passage falls within the scope of the invention. This means that<br>
only the process air from the cooling chamber is introduced into the<br>
intermediate passage and that otherwise no air introduction or substantially no<br>
air introduction from the outside takes place. It is preferred for the intermediate<br>
passage to have a converging shape from the cooling chamber to the stretching<br>
unit.<br>
Here, the intermediate passage walls, which are spaced transversely to the<br>
machine direction or transversely to the travel direction of the spunbond web,<br>
converge. The intermediate passage thus narrows from the cooling chamber to<br>
the stretching unit. According to an embodiment of the invention, different<br><br>
convergence angles of the intermediate passage can be used. The fact that the<br>
lower end of the intermediate passage is connected to the stretching passage of<br>
the stretching unit without an intake slit for air or substantially without an intake<br>
slit for air falls within the scope of the invention. Thus, only the process air (with<br>
the filament), and no additional air or substantially no additional air, reaches the<br>
stretching passage from the intermediate passage.<br>
However, it is recommended that in the stretching unit, at the upstream end of<br>
the diverging stretching passage section or slightly upstream of the diverging<br>
stretching passage section, additional air is injected into the stretching passage.<br>
Here, the air is advantageously injected parallel to the travel direction of the<br>
filaments or the filament bundle, and preferably tangentially to the filament<br>
bundle. The air is blown in tangentially and preferably as a boundary layer. It is<br>
recommended that the air injection be from opposite facing passage walls or<br>
facing diverging passage walls of the stretching passage and, here, preferably<br>
at the same height with respect to the length of the stretching passage. Such a<br>
two-sided air feed can also take place twice or repeatedly at different heights of<br>
the stretching passage. The air injection takes place advantageously with the<br>
condition that the filament bundle is made broader in the machine direction or in<br>
the travel direction of the spunbond web. In this process, it is preferred to<br>
operate in such a way that the opening angle of the filament bundle is 0.1-10°,<br>
preferably 0.1-1°.<br>
The expression "at the upstream end of the diverging stretching passage<br>
section" means in particular the upstream third, preferably the upstream fourth,<br>
and particularly preferably the upstream fifth of the diverging stretching passage<br>
section, with respect to the length of the diverging stretching passage section.<br>
The spacing between the passage walls of the stretching passage is<br>
advantageously 5-30 mm, preferably 8-25 mm, and preferably 10-20 mm.<br><br>
It is within the scope of the invention that at least one fourth, preferably at least<br>
one third of the length of the stretching passage diverges or is designed as a<br>
diverging section. At least 40% of the length of the stretching passage is<br>
preferably diverging or has a diverging flow cross section. According to a first<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, the stretching passage has diverging<br>
passage walls over its entire length or substantially over its entire length.<br>
According to this embodiment, the entire stretching passage or substantially the<br>
entire stretching passage diverges. It falls within the scope of the invention for<br>
the stretching passage to diverge over at least 90%, preferably over at least<br>
95% of its length.<br>
According to an additional preferred embodiment of the invention, the stretching<br>
passage has over a part of its length parallel passage walls (parallel section)<br>
and downstream of this part are diverging passage walls (diverging section).<br>
Here, it falls within the scope of the invention that the stretching passage in this<br>
embodiment consists exclusively of the mentioned parallel section and the<br>
downstream diverging section. The additional air feed takes place in this<br>
embodiment either at the end of the parallel section or at the upstream end of<br>
the diverging section of the stretching passage. The end of the parallel passage<br>
here refers in particular to the downstream third with respect to the length of the<br>
parallel section, preferably the farthest downstream fourth, and most preferably<br>
the farthest downstream fifth of the parallel section. The upstream end of the<br>
diverging section here and below means in particular the farthest upstream third<br>
with respect to the length of the diverging section, preferably the farthest<br>
upstream fourth, and most preferably the farthest upstream fifth of the diverging<br>
section. It is preferred for the diverging section of this embodiment to be longer<br>
than the parallel section, the diverging section being advantageously at least<br>
1.5 times the length of the parallel section.<br><br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the stretching passage<br>
has converging passage walls (converging section) over part of its length, which<br>
are then ed by diverging passage walls (diverging section). Here, it falls within<br>
the scope of the invention that the stretching passage in this embodiment<br>
consists exclusively of the converging and the diverging section. Thus, the<br>
diverging section is immediately downstream of the converging section. In this<br>
embodiment, the additional air feed is advantageously in the transitional region<br>
between the converging section and the diverging section, or at the upstream<br>
end of the diverging section. It is advantageous in this embodiment for the<br>
diverging section to be longer than the converging section, and the diverging<br>
section is preferably 1.5 times the length of the converging section.<br>
According to an additional embodiment of the invention, the stretching passage<br>
has over a part of its length converging walls (converging section), downstream<br>
of which are parallel passage walls (parallel section), and downstream of which<br>
in turn are diverging passage walls (diverging section). According to an<br>
embodiment, the stretching passage here consists exclusively of the converging<br>
section, the next downstream parallel section, and in turn the next downstream<br>
diverging section. However, in principle, the last-mentioned diverging section<br>
can also be a downstream parallel section. In this embodiment, the additional<br>
air feed takes place advantageously at the end of the (upstream) parallel<br>
section or at the upstream end of the diverging section. The end of the parallel<br>
section means the farthest downstream third, preferably the farthest<br>
downstream fourth, and most preferably the farthest downstream fifth of the<br>
parallel section, with respect to the length of the parallel section. In this<br>
embodiment (converging-parallel-diverging), it is recommended for the<br>
diverging section to be the longest passage section. This means that the<br>
diverging section in each case is longer than the parallel section and longer<br>
than the convergent section. According to a particularly recommended<br><br>
embodiment, the diverging section is longer than the total passage section<br>
consisting of the converging and parallel section.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the diverging passage<br>
walls of the diverging section are in an arrangement that is symmetric with<br>
respect to a middle plane that runs vertically through the stretching passage. In<br>
principle, the scope of the invention also includes that the diverging passage<br>
walls can be arranged asymmetrically with respect to this middle plane. In that<br>
case, one of the two diverging passage walls would thus have a stronger<br>
inclination or slanted position than the other facing passage wall. According to a<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, the divergence angle of the diverging<br>
section remains constant over the length of the diverging section. However, in<br>
principle, it is also possible for the divergence angle to change over the length<br>
of the diverging section.<br>
it falls within the scope of the invention that the cooling chamber and the<br>
stretching unit of the apparatus according to the invention form a closed unit.<br>
Here, air feed into the aggregate consisting of the cooling chamber and the<br>
stretching unit is limited at least substantially to the introduction of the process<br>
air into the cooling chamber, on the one hand, and to the additional air fed in<br>
upstream of the diverging section or at the upstream end of the diverging<br>
section in the stretching passage, on the other hand. Naturally, air can also<br>
reach the cooling chamber from above with the deposition belt.<br>
A particular embodiment, which is particularly important within in the scope of<br>
the invention, is characterized in that downstream of the stretching unit a<br>
repositioning unit with at least one diffuser. Thus, the filaments are, or the<br>
filament bundle is, led through at least one diffuser after the stretching unit. The<br>
diffuser has at least regions with diverging diffuser walls. The diffuser walls are<br>
here spaced transversely to the machine direction or transversely to the travel<br><br>
direction of the spunbond web. According to a recommended embodiment, the<br>
repositioning unit consists of an upstream diffuser and a next downstream<br>
diffuser. It is advantageous to provide an ambient air inlet slit between the<br>
upstream diffuser and the downstream diffuser. Because of the exit pulse from<br>
the upstream diffuser, air is sucked out of the environment through this ambient<br>
air inlet slit. The width of the ambient air inlet slit is advantageously adjustable.<br>
It falls within the scope of the invention that the depositing device of the<br>
apparatus according to the invention is a continuously moving foraminous<br>
deposition belt for the spunbond web. At least one suction apparatus is<br>
advantageously provided under the foraminous deposition belt, by means of<br>
which air can be sucked through the foraminous deposition belt.<br>
The invention is based on the discovery that qualitatively a very high quality<br>
spunbond web can be manufactured with the apparatus according to the<br>
invention, which is characterized particularly by a homogeneous structure and<br>
homogeneous properties. The invention is based particularly on the discovery<br>
that, as a result of the design of the stretching unit according to the invention,<br>
an undesired compaction of the filament bundle can be avoided or any<br>
compaction that has already occurred can be reduced greatly. The treatment<br>
according to the invention of the filament bundle can result in an effective<br>
spacing between the individual filaments. Thus, with the design according to<br>
the invention, a high number of filaments can be deposited in the form of<br>
individual filaments. As a result, the quality of the spunbond web manufactured<br>
according to the invention can be increased considerably in comparison to a<br>
spunbond web manufactured according to the prior art. Moreover, it should be<br>
emphasized that the success according to the invention can be achieved using<br>
relatively simple and cost effective measures. As a result, a high quality<br>
spunbond web can be obtained with even or homogeneous structural<br>
properties.<br><br>
The invention is explained in greater detail below wit reference to a drawing that<br>
shows a single embodiment. Therein, schematically:<br>
FIG. 1	shows a vertical section through an apparatus according to the<br>
invention,<br>
FIG. 2	shows in enlarged scale detail A of FIG. 1,<br>
FIG. 3	shows a second embodiment of the structure according to FIG. 2,<br>
FIG. 4	shows a third embodiment of the structure according to FIG. 2,<br>
and<br>
FIG. 5	shows a fourth embodiment of the structure according to FIG. 2.<br>
The figures show an apparatus for the continuous manufacture of a spunbond<br>
web from aerodynamically stretched filaments made of a thermoplastic resin.<br>
The apparatus has a spinneret 1 for making the filaments. Downstream of the<br>
spinneret 1 is a cooling chamber 2 that is supplied with cool process air to cool<br>
the filaments. The cooling chamber 2 is here preferably subdivided into two<br>
cooling compartments 3 and 4, in which the filaments are cooled with process<br>
air at a different temperatures. According to a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the temperature of the process air that is applied to the filaments in<br>
the upstream cooling compartment 3 is higher than the temperature of the<br>
process air that is applied to the filaments in the downstream cooling<br>
compartment 4.<br>
Downstream of the cooling chamber 2 is a stretching unit 5 that<br>
aerodynamically stretches the filaments. Preferably, as in the illustrated<br><br>
embodiment, the cooling chamber 2 is connected here via an intermediate<br>
passage 6 to the stretching unit 5. The connection region between the cooling<br>
chamber 2 and the stretching unit 5 is designed according to the invention so it<br>
is closed. This means that in this transition region and particularly in the region<br>
of the intermediate passage 6, substantially no air can enter the flow path of the<br>
filaments from outside. Advantageously, as in the illustrated embodiment, the<br>
intermediate passage 6 has a converging shape from the cooling chamber 2 to<br>
the stretching unit 5. In other words, the intermediate passage 6 narrows from<br>
the cooling chamber to the stretching unit 5.<br>
According to the invention, the stretching unit 5 has a stretching passage 7<br>
whose walls 8 and 9 diverge over at least a part of the length of the stretching<br>
passage 7. The passage walls 8 and 9 thus form at least one diverging section<br>
10 in which the spacing between the passage walls 8 and 9 increases<br>
downward. These passage walls 8 and 9 are the passage walls 8 and 9 of the<br>
stretching passage 7 that are transversely spaced relative to the machine or<br>
travel direction of the spunbond web. The travel direction of the spunbond web<br>
is indicated in FIG. 1 by a double arrow.<br>
In FIG. 1, it is apparent that downstream of the stretching unit 5 is a depositing<br>
unit 11 that consists preferably, as in the illustrated embodiment, of an<br>
upstream diffuser 12 and a downstream diffuser 13. Moreover, one can also<br>
see in FIG. 1 that an ambient air inlet slit 14 is provided between the upstream<br>
diffuser 12 and the downstream diffuser 13. Each diffuser 12 and 13 has an<br>
upper converging part as well as a lower diverging part. Accordingly, each<br>
diffuser 12 and 13 has a narrowest region between the upper converging part<br>
and the lower diverging part. It is advantageous for the diffuser walls in the<br>
diverging part of the upstream diffuser 12 and/or the downstream diffuser 13 to<br>
be adjustable, so that the apex angle of the respective diverging parts are<br>
adjustable.<br><br>
Under the depositing unit 11, a continuously moved foraminous deposition belt<br>
15 is provided, as a depositing device for the spunbond web. Beneath this<br>
foraminous deposition belt 15, at least one suction apparatus C not shown in<br>
the figures C is provided advantageously, by means of which air can be drawn<br>
down through the foraminous deposition belt 15 in the usual way.<br>
FIGS. 2-5 show the third embodiments for the design of the stretching passage<br>
7 of the stretching unit 5. In all these illustrated embodiments, additional air is<br>
blown into the stretching passage 7 at the upstream end of the diverging<br>
stretching passage section or at the upstream end of the diverging section 10 or<br>
shortly before the diverging section 10. The introduction of the air here takes<br>
place advantageously in the direction of travel of the filaments or of the filament<br>
bundle, and preferably tangentially to the filaments or to the filament bundle. As<br>
can be seen in FIGS. 2-5, the air injection takes place preferably from both<br>
facing passage walls 8 and 9 and, here, level with the stretching unit 5. Here, it<br>
falls within the scope of the invention that air is blown in with the condition that<br>
the filament bundle is made broader, where the opening angle of the filament<br>
bundle is preferably 0.1-1°. This broadening of the filament bundle is indicated<br>
in FIGS. 2-5.<br>
To the extent that here and below the expression upstream end of the diverging<br>
section 10 is used, it refers particularly to the upstream third, preferably to the<br>
upstream fourth, and most preferably to the upstream fifth of the diverging<br>
section 10, with respect to the length of the diverging section 10.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a first embodiment of the stretching unit 5 according to the<br>
invention, where the stretching passage 7 has passage walls 8 and 9 that<br>
diverge over its entire length. In other words, the entire stretching passage 7 is<br>
divergent. The air intake here is at the upstream end of the diverging stretching<br><br>
passage 7. The passage walls 8 and 9 are symmetrical to a middle plane M. In<br>
addition, the divergence angle between the passage walls 8 and 9 remains<br>
constant over the length of the stretching passage 7.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment according to FIG. 3, the stretching passage 7 has<br>
an upstream parallel section 16 with parallel passage walls 8 and 9,<br>
downstream of which is the diverging section 10. The air intake here is at the<br>
upstream end of this diverging section 10. It is apparent in FIG. 3 that the<br>
diverging section 10 is longer than the parallel section 16, namely<br>
approximately twice as long. In the embodiment according to.FIG. 3, the<br>
passage walls 8 and 9 in the diverging section 10 are also symmetrical to the<br>
middle plane M, and the divergence angle remains constant over the entire<br>
length of the diverging section 10.<br>
FIG. 4 shows an embodiment in which the stretching passage 7 has an<br>
upstream converging section 17 with converging passage walls 8 and 9,<br>
immediately downstream of which is the diverging section 10. The air intake<br>
here too is at the upstream end of the diverging section 10. The diverging<br>
section 10, in the illustrated embodiment according to FIG. 4, is longer than the<br>
converging section 17, namely approximately twice as long.<br>
FIG. 5 shows an embodiment of the stretching unit 5 in which the stretching unit<br>
7 has an upstream converging section 17 with converging passage walls 8 and<br>
9,	downstream of which is a parallel section 16. Directly downstream of the<br>
parallel section 16 is the diverging section 10. The air feed here too is at the<br>
upstream end of the diverging section 10. The length of the diverging section<br>
10,	in the illustrated embodiment, is greater than the length of the remaining<br>
stretching passage 7 consisting of the converging section 17 and the parallel<br>
section 16. In the diverging section 10, the passage walls 8 and 9 are<br><br>
symmetrical to the middle plane M. The divergence angle remains constant<br>
over the length of the diverging section 10.<br><br>
