BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	[0001] With more than 563,000 deaths in the United States annually, cancer is the second leading cause of death behind heart disease (UBS Warburg "Disease Dynamics: The Cancer Market," Nov. 8,2000). Surgery and radiotherapy may be curative if the disease is found early, but current drag therapies for metastatic disease are mostly palliative and seldom offer a long-term cure. Even with the new chemotherapies entering the market, improvement in patient survival is measured in months rather than in years, and the need continues for new drugs effective both in combination with existing agents as first line therapy and as second and third line therapies in treatment of resistant tumors..<br>
[0002] A need remains in the art for improved cell proliferation disorder and cancer treatments.<br>

f   Definitions	J<br>
[000161]	For convenience, certain terms used in the specification, examples and<br>
appended claims are collected here.<br>
[000162]        Protein kinases are a large class of enzymes which catalyze the transfer of the y-phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group on the side chain of Ser/Thr or Tyr in proteins and peptides and are intimately involved in the control of various important cell functions, perhaps most notably: signal transduction, differentiation, and proliferation. There are estimated to be about 2,000 distinct protein kinases in the human body, and although each of these phosphorylate particular protein/peptide substrates, they all bind the same second substrate ATP in a highly conserved pocket. About 50% of the known oncogene products are protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), and their kinase activity has been shown to lead to cell transformation.<br>
[000163]	The PTKs can be classified into two categories, the membrane receptor PTKs<br>
(e.g. growth factor receptor PTKs) and the non-receptor PTKs (e.g. the Src family of proto-<br>
oncogene products and focal adhesion kinase (FAK)). The hyperactivation of Src has been<br>
reported in a number of human cancers, including those of the colon, breast, lung, bladder,<br>
and skin, as well as in gastric cancer, hairy cell leukemia, and neuroblastoma.<br>
[000164]	"Treating", includes any effect, e.g., lessening, reducing, modulating, or<br>
eliminating, that results in the improvement of the condition, disease, disorder, etc.<br>
"Treating" or "treatment" of a disease state includes: (1) preventing the disease state, i.e.<br>
causing the clinical symptoms of the disease state not to develop in a subject that may be<br>
exposed to or predisposed to the disease state, but does not yet experience or display<br>
symptoms of the disease state; (2) inhibiting the disease state, i.e., arresting the development<br>
of the disease state or its clinical symptoms; or (3) relieving the disease state, i.e., causing<br>
temporary or permanent regression of the disease state or its clinical symptoms.<br>
[000165]	"Disease state" means any disease, disorder, condition, symptom, or<br>
indication.<br>
[000166]        As used herein, the term "cell proliferative disorder" refers to conditions in which the unregulated and/or abnormal growth of cells can lead to the development of an unwanted condition or disease, which can be cancerous or non-cancerous, for example a psoriatic condition. As used herein, the terms "psoriatic condition" or "psoriasis" refers to disorders involving keratinocyte hyperproliferation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and cytokine alteration.<br><br>
[000167]	In a preferred embodiment, the cell proliferation disorder is cancer. As used<br>
herein, the term "cancer" includes solid tumors, such as lung, breast, colon, ovarian, brain, liver, pancreas, prostate, malignant melanoma, non-melanoma skin cancers, as well as hematologic tumors and/or malignancies, such as childhood leukemia and lymphomas, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's disease, lymphomas of lymphocytic and cutaneous origin, acute and chronic leukemia such as acute lymphoblastic, acute myelocytic or chronic myelocytic leukemia, plasma cell neoplasm, lymphoid neoplasm and cancers associated with AIDS.<br>
[000168]        In addition to psoriatic conditions, the types of proliferative diseases which may be treated using the compositions of the present invention are epidermic and dermoid cysts, lipomas, adenomas, capillary and cutaneous hemangiomas, lymphangiomas, nevi lesions, teratomas, nephromas, myofibromatosis, osteoplastic tumors, and other dysplastic masses and the like. The proliferative diseases can include dysplasias and disorders of the like.<br>
[000169]        An "effective amount" of a compound of the disclosed invention is the quantity which, when adrninistered to a subject having a disease or disorder, results in regression of the disease or disorder in the subject. Thus, an effective amount of a compound of the disclosed invention is the quantity which, when administered to a subject having a cell proliferation disorder, results in regression of cell growth in the subject. The amount of the disclosed compound to be administered to a subject will depend on the particular disorder, the mode of administration, co-administered compounds, if any, and the characteristics of the subject, such as general health, other diseases, age, sex, genotype, body weight and tolerance to drugs. The skilled artisan will be able to determine appropriate dosages depending on these and other factors.<br>
[000170]	As used herein, the term "effective amount" refers to an amount of a<br>
compound, or a combination of compounds, of the present invention effective when adrninistered alone or in combination as an anti-proliferative agent. For example, an effective amount refers to an amount of the compound present in a formulation or on a medical device given to a recipient patient or subject sufficient to elicit biological activity, for example, anti-proliferative activity, such as e.g., anti-cancer activity or anti-neoplastic activity. The combination of compounds optionally is a synergistic combination. Synergy, as described, for example, by Chou and Talalay, Adv. Enzyme Regul. vol. 22, pp. 27-55 (1984), occurs when the effect of the compounds when administered in combination is greater than the additive effect of the compounds when administered alone as a single agent.<br><br>
In general, a synergistic effect is most clearly demonstrated at sub-optimal concentrations of the compounds. Synergy can be in terms of lower cytotoxicity, or increased anti-proliferative effect, or some other beneficial effect of the combination compared with the individual components.<br>
[000171]        "A therapeutically effective amount" means the amount of a compound that, when administered to a mammal for treating a disease, is suffciect such treatment for the disease. The "therapeutically effective amount" will vary depending on the compound, the disease and its severity and the age, weight, etc., of the mammal to be treated. [000172]        A therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the compounds can be formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for administration to a human or an animal. Accordingly, the compounds or the formulations can be administered, for example, via oral, parenteral, or topical routes, to provide an effective amount of the compound. In alternative embodiments, the compounds prepared in accordance with the present invention can be used to coat or impregnate a medical device, e.g., a stent.<br>
[000173]        The term "prophylactically effective amount" means an effective amount of a compound or compounds, of the present invention that is administered to prevent or reduce the risk of unwanted cellular proliferation.<br>
[000174]	"Pharmacological effect" as used herein encompasses effects produced in the<br>
subject that achieve the intended purpose of a therapy. In one preferred embodiment, a pharmacological effect means that primary indications of the subject being treated are prevented, alleviated, or reduced. For example, a pharmacological effect would be one that results in the prevention, alleviation or reduction of primary indications in a treated subject. In another preferred embodiment, a pharmacological effect means that disorders or symptoms of the primary indications of the subject being treated are prevented, alleviated, or reduced. For example, a pharmacological effect would be one that results in the prevention or reduction of primary indications in a treated subject.<br>
[000175]        With respect to the chemical compounds useful in the present invention, the following terms can be applicable:<br>
[000176]        The term "substituted," as used herein, means that any one or more hydrogens on the designated atom is replaced with a selection from the indicated group, provided that the designated atom's normal valency is not exceeded, and that the substitution results in a stable compound. When a substituent is keto (i.e., =0), then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced. Keto substituents are not present on aromatic moieties. Ring double bonds, as used<br><br>
herein, are double bonds that are formed between two adjacent ring atoms (e.g., C=C, C=N, orN=N).<br>
[000177]	The present invention is intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring in<br>
the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium, and isotopes of carbon include C-13 and C-14. [000178]        The compounds described herein may have asymmetric centers. Compounds of the present invention containing an asymmetrically substituted atom may be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. It is well known in the art how to prepare optically active forms, such as by resolution of racemic forms or by synthesis from optically active starting materials. Many geometric isomers of olefins, C=N double bonds, and the like can also be present in the compounds described herein, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present invention. Cis and trans geometric isomers of the compounds of the present invention are described and may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated isomeric forms. All chiral, diastereomeric, racemic, and geometric isomeric forms of a structure are intended, unless the specific stereochemistry or isomeric form is specifically indicated. All tautomers of shown or described compounds are also considered to be part of the present invention.<br>
[000179]	When any variable (e.g., Ri) occurs more than one time in any constituent or<br>
formula for a compound, its definition at each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0-2 Ri moieties, then the group may optionally be substituted with up to two Ri moieties and R1 at each occurrence is selected independently from the definition of Ri. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible, but only if such combinations result in stable compounds.<br>
[000180]        When a bond to a substituent is shown to cross a bond connecting two atoms in a ring, then such substituent may be bonded to any atom in the ring. When a substituent is listed without indicating the atom via which such substituent is bonded to the rest of the compound of a given formula, then such substituent may be bonded via any atom in such substituent. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible, but only if such combinations result in stable compounds.<br>
[000181]	Compounds of the present invention that contain nitrogens can be converted to<br>
N-oxides by treatment with an oxidizing agent (e.g., 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA) and/or hydrogen peroxides) to afford other compounds of the present invention. Thus, all<br><br>
shown and claimed nitrogen-containing compounds are considered, when allowed by valency and structure, to include both the compound as shown and its N-oxide derivative (which can be designated as N→0 or N+-O"). Furthermore, in other instances, the nitrogens in the compounds of the present invention can be converted to N-hydroxy or N-alkoxy compounds. For example, N-hydroxy compounds can be prepared by oxidation of the parent amine by an oxidizing agent such as TM-CPBA. All shown and claimed nitrogen-containing compounds are also considered, when allowed by valency and structure, to cover both the compound as shown and its N-hydroxy (i.e., N-OH) and N-alkoxy (i.e., N-OR, wherein R is substituted or unsubstituted C1-6 alkyl, C1-6 alkenyl, C1-6alkynyl, C3-14 carbocycle, or 3-14-membered heterocycle) derivatives.<br>
[000182]        When an atom or chemical moiety is followed by a subscripted numeric range<br>
(e.g., C1-6), the invention is meant to encompass each number within the range as well as all<br>
intermediate ranges. For example, "C1-6 alkyl" is meant to include alkyl groups with 1,2, 3,<br>
4, 5, 6,1-6,1-5,1-4,1-3,1-2, 2-6,2-5, 2-4,2-3, 3-6, 3-5, 3-4, 4-6, 4-5, and 5-6 carbons.<br>
[000183]	As used herein, "alkyl" is intended to include both branched and straight-chain<br>
saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms. For example, C1-6alkyl is intended to include Ci, C2, C3, C4, C5, and C$ alkyl groups. Examples of alkyl include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, s-butyl, t-butyl, n-pentyl, s-pentyl, and n-hexyl. "Alkyl" further includes alkyl groups that have oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur or phosphorous atoms replacing one or more hydrocarbon backbone carbon atoms. In certain embodiments, a straight chain or branched chain alkyl has six or fewer carbon atoms in its backbone (e.g., C1-6 for straight chain, C3-C6 for branched chain), and more preferably four or fewer. Likewise, preferred cycloalkyls have from three to eight carbon atoms in their ring structure, and more preferably have five or six carbons in the ring structure.<br>
[000184]	Unless the number of carbons is otherwise specified, "lower alkyl" includes an<br>
alkyl group, as defined above, but having from one to ten, more preferably from one to six, carbon atoms in its backbone structure. "Lower alkenyl" and "lower alkynyl" have chain lengths of, for example, 2-5 carbon atoms.<br>
[000185]        The term "alkyl" also includes both "unsubstituted alkyls" and "substituted alkyls", the latter of which refers to alkyl moieties having substituents replacing a hydrogen on one or more carbons of the hydrocarbon backbone.

[000186]        "Alkenyl" includes unsaturated aliphatic groups analogous in length and possible substitution to the alkyls described above, but that contain at least one double bond. For example, the term "alkenyl" includes straight-chain alkenyl groups (e.g., ethenyl, propenyl, butenyl, pentenyl, hexenyl, heptenyl, octenyl, nonenyl, decenyl), branched-chain alkenyl groups, cycloalkenyl (e.g., alicyclic) groups (e.g., cyclopropenyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexenyl, cycloheptenyl, cyclooctenyl), alkyl or alkenyl substituted cycloalkenyl groups, and cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl substituted alkenyl groups. The term "alkenyl" further includes alkenyl groups, which include oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur or phosphorous atoms replacing one or more hydrocarbon backbone carbons. In certain embodiments, a straight chain or branched chain alkenyl group has six or fewer carbon atoms in its backbone (e.g., C2-C6 for straight chain, C3-C6 for branched chain). Likewise, cycloalkenyl groups may have from three to eight carbon atoms in their ring structure, and more preferably have five or six carbons in the ring structure. The term "C2-C6" includes alkenyl groups containing two to six carbon atoms. The term "C3-C6" includes alkenyl groups containing three to six carbon atoms.<br>
[000187]	The term "alkenyl" also includes both "unsubstituted alkenyls" and<br>
"substituted alkenyls", the latter of which refers to alkenyl moieties having substituents replacing a hydrogen on one or more hydrocarbon backbone carbon atoms. Such substituents can include, for example, alkyl groups, alkynyl groups, halogens, hydroxyl, alkylcarbonyloxy, arylcarbonyloxy, alkoxycarbonyloxy, aryloxycarbonyloxy, carboxylate, alkylcarbonyl, arylcarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, alkylaminocarbonyl, daalkylaminocarbonyl, alkyltbiocarbonyl, alkoxyl, phosphate, phosphonato, phosphinato, cyano, amino (including alkylamino, dialkylamino, arylamino, diarylamino, and alkylarylamino), acylamino (including alkylcarbonylamino, arylcarbonylamino, carbamoyl<br><br>

The term "alkynyl" further includes alkynyl groups having oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur or phosphorous atoms replacing one or more hydrocarbon backbone carbons. In certain embodiments, a straight chain or branched chain alkynyl group has six or fewer carbon atoms in its backbone (e.g., C2-C6 for straight chain, C3-C6 for branched chain). The term "C2-C6" includes alkynyl groups containing two to six carbon atoms. The term "C3-C6" includes alkynyl groups containing three to six carbon atoms.

[000194]	As used herein, "carbocycle" or "carbocyclic ring" is intended to mean any<br>
stable monocyclic, bicyclic, or tricyclic ring having the specified number of carbons, any of which may be saturated, unsaturated, or aromatic. For example a C3.14 carbocycle is intended to mean a mono-, bi-, or tricyclic ring having 3,4, 5,6,7, 8,9,10,11,12,13, or 14 carbon atoms.

A bridged ring occurs when one or more carbon atoms link two non-adjacent carbon atoms. Preferred bridges are one or two carbon<br><br>
atoms. It is noted that a bridge always converts a monocyclic ring into a tricyclic ring. When<br>
a ring is bridged, the substituents recited for the ring may also be present on the bridge.<br>
Fused {e.g., naphthyl and tetrahydronaphthyl) and spiro rings are also included.<br>

any stable monocyclic, bicyclic, or tricyclic ring which is saturated, unsaturated, or aromatic<br>
and comprises carbon atoms and one or more ring heteroatoms, e.g., 1 or 1-2 or 1-3 or 1-4 or<br>
1-5 or 1-6 heteroatoms, independently selected from the group consisting of nitrogen,<br>
oxygen, and sulfur. A bicyclic or tricyclic heterocycle may have one or more heteroatoms<br>
located in one ring, or the heteroatoms may be located in more than one ring. The nitrogen<br>
and sulfur heteroatoms may optionally be oxidized (i.e., N—&gt;0 and S(0)p, where p = 1 or 2).<br>
When a nitrogen atom is included in the ring it is either N or NH, depending on whether or<br>
not it is attached to a double bond in the ring (i.e., a hydrogen is present if needed to maintain<br>
the tri-valency of the nitrogen atom). The nitrogen atom may be substituted or unsubstituted<br>
(i.e., N or NR wherein R is H or another substituent, as defined). The heterocyclic ring may<br>
be attached to its pendant group at any heteroatom or carbon atom that results in a stable<br>
structure. The heterocyclic rings described herein may be substituted on carbon or on a<br>
nitrogen atom if the resulting compound is stable. A nitrogen in the heterocycle may<br>
optionally be quaternized. It is preferred that when the total number of S and O atoms in the<br>
heterocycle exceeds 1, then these heteroatoms are not adjacent to one another. Bridged rings<br>
are also included in the definition of heterocycle. A bridged ring occurs when one or more<br>
atoms (i.e., C, O, N, or S) link two non-adjacent carbon or nitrogen atoms. Preferred bridges<br>
include, but are not limited to, one carbon atom, two carbon atoms, one nitrogen atom, two<br>
nitrogen atoms, and a carbon-nitrogen group. It is noted that a bridge always converts a<br>
monocyclic ring into a tricyclic ring. When a ring is bridged, the substituents recited for the<br>
ring may also be present on the bridge. Spiro and fused rings are also included.<br>
[000196]	As used herein, the term "aromatic heterocycle" or "heteroaryl" is intended to<br>
mean a stable 5,6, or 7-membered monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic heterocyclic ring or 7, 8, 9,10,11, or 12-membered bicyclic aromatic heterocyclic ring which consists of carbon atoms and one or more heteroatoms, e.g., I or 1-2 or 1-3 or 1-4 or 1-5 or 1-6 heteroatoms, independently selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. In the case of bicyclic heterocyclic aromatic rings, only one of the two rings needs to be aromatic (e.g., 2,3-dihydroindole), though both may be (e.g., quinoline). The second ring can also be fused or bridged as defined above for heterocycles. The nitrogen atom may be substituted or unsubstituted (/. e., N or NR wherein R is H or another substituent, as defined). The nitrogen<br><br>
and sulfur heteroatoms may optionally be oxidized (i.e., N—&gt;-0 and S(0)p, where p = 1 or 2). It is to be noted that total number of S and O atoms in the aromatic heterocycle is not more thanl.<br>

as described above, which further include oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atoms replacing one or<br>
more hydrocarbon backbone carbon atoms, e.g., oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atoms.<br>
[000202]	The term "alkoxy" or "alkoxyl" includes substituted and unsubstituted alkyl,<br>
alkenyl, and alkynyl groups covalently linked to an oxygen atom. Examples of alkoxy groups (or alkoxyl radicals) include methoxy, ethoxy, isopropyloxy, propoxy, butoxy, and pentoxy groups. Examples of substituted alkoxy groups include halogenated alkoxy groups. The alkoxy groups can be substituted with groups such as alkenyl, alkynyl, halogen, hydroxyl, alkylcarbonyloxy, arylcarbonyloxy, alkoxycarbonyloxy, aryloxycarbonyloxy, carboxylate, alkylcarbonyl, arylcarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, alkylaminocarbonyl, dialkylaminocarbonyl, alkylthiocarbonyl, alkoxyl, phosphate, phosphonato, phosphinato, cyano, amino (including alkylamino, d^alkylamino, arylamino, diarylamino, and alkylarylarnino), acylamino (including alkylcarbonylamino, arylcarbonylamino, carbamoyl and ureido), amidino, imino, sulfhydryl, alkylthio, arylthio, thiocarboxylate, sulfates, alkylsulfinyl, sulfonato, sulfamoyl, sulfonamido, nitro, trifluoromethyl, cyano, azido, heterocyclyl, alkylaryl, or an aromatic or heteroaromatic moieties.

[000203]        The term "thiocarbonyl" or "thiocarboxy" includes compounds and moieties which contain a carbon connected with a double bond to a sulfur atom. [000204]        The term "ether" includes compounds or moieties which contain an oxygen bonded to two different carbon atoms or heteroatoms. For example, the term includes "alkoxyalkyl" which refers to an alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl group covalently bonded to an oxygen atom which is covalently bonded to another alkyl group.<br><br>
[000205]	The term "ester" includes compounds and moieties which contain a carbon or<br>

The term "alkthioalkyls" include compounds with an alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl group bonded to a sulfur atom which is bonded to an alkyl group. Similarly, the term "alkthioalkenyls" and alkthioalkynyls" refer to compounds or moieties wherein an alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl group is bonded to a sulfur atom which is covalently bonded to an alkynyl group.<br>
[000207]        The term "hydroxy" or "hydroxyl" includes groups with an -OH or -O'. [000208]        "Polycyclyl" or "polycyclic radical" refers to two or more cyclic rings (e.g., cycloalkyls, cycloalkenyls, cycloalkynyls, aryls and/or heterocyclyls) in which two or more<br>
carbons are common to two adjoining rings. Rings that are joined through non-adjacent	<br>
atoms are termed "bridged" rings.

Preferred anionic groups include carboxylate, sulfate, sulfonate, sulfinate, sulfamate, tetrazolyl, phosphate, phosphonate, phosphinate, or phosphorothioate or functional equivalents thereof. "Functional equivalents" of anionic groups are intended to include bioisosteres, e.g., bioisosteres of a carboxylate group. Bioisosteres encompass both classical bioisosteric equivalents and non-classical bioisosteric equivalents. Classical and non-classical bioisosteres are known in the art (see, e.g., Silverman, R. B. The Organic<br><br>
Chemistry of Drag Design and Drug Action, Academic Press, Inc.: San Diego, Calif., 1992, pp. 19-23). A particularly preferred anionic group is a carboxylate.<br>
[000210]        In the present specification, the structural formula of the compound represents a certain isomer for convenience in some cases, but the present invention includes all isomers such as geometrical isomer, optical isomer based on an asymmetrical carbon, stereoisomer, tautomer and the like which occur structurally and an isomer mixture and is not limited to the description of the formula for convenience, and may be any one of isomer or a mixture. Therefore, an asymmetrical carbon atom may be present in the molecule and an optically active compound and a racemic compound may be present in the present compound, but the present invention is not limited to them and includes any one. In addition, a crystal polymorphism may be present but is not limiting, but any crystal form may be single or a crystal form mixture, or an anhydride or hydrate. Further, so-called metabolite which is produced by degradation of the present compound in vivo is included in the scope of the present invention.<br>
[000211]        "Isomerism" means compounds that have identical molecular formulae but that differ in the nature or the sequence of bonding of their atoms or in the arrangement of their atoms in space. Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed "stereoisomers". Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed "diastereoisomers", and stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images are termed "enantiomers", or sometimes optical isomers. A carbon atom bonded to four nonidentical substituents is termed a "chiral center".<br>
[000212]	"Chiral isomer" means a compound with at least one chiral center. It has two<br>
enantiomeric forms of opposite chirality and may exist either as an individual enantiomer or as a mixture of enantiomers. A mixture containing equal amounts of individual enantiomeric forms of opposite chirality is termed a "racemic mixture". A compound that has more than one chiral center has 2""1 enantiomeric pairs, where n is the number of chiral centers. Compounds with more than one chiral center may exist as either an individual diastereomer or as a mixture of diastereomers, termed a "diastereomeric mixture". When one chiral center is present, a stereoisomer may be characterized by the absolute configuration (R. or S) of that chiral center. Absolute configuration refers to the arrangement in space of the substituents attached to the chiral center. The substituents attached to the chiral center under consideration are ranked in accordance with the Sequence Rule of Cahn, Ingold and Prelog. (Cahn et al, Angew. Chem. Inter. Edit. 1966, 5,385; errata 511; Cahn et al., Angew. Chem. 1966, 78,413;<br><br>
Cahn and Ingold, J, Chem. Soc. 1951 (London), 612; Cahn et al., Experientia 1956,12, 81; Cahn, J., Chem. Educ. 1964,41, 116).<br>
[000213]        "Geometric Isomers" means the diastereomers that owe their existence to<br>
hindered rotation about double bonds. These configurations are differentiated in their names<br>
by the prefixes cis and trans, or Z and E, which indicate that the groups are on the same or<br>
opposite side of the double bond in the molecule according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules.<br>
[000214]	Further, the structures and other compounds discussed in this application<br>
include all atropic isomers thereof. "Atropic isomers" are a type of stereoisomer in which the atoms of two isomers are arranged differently in space. Atropic isomers owe their existence to a restricted rotation caused by hindrance of rotation of large groups about a central bond. Such atropic isomers Typically exist as a mixture, however as a result of recent advances in chromatography techniques, it has been possible to separate mixtures of two atropic isomers in select cases.<br>
[000215]	The terms "crystal polymorphs" or "polymorphs" or "crystal forms" means<br>
crystal structures in which a compound (or salt or solvate thereof) can crystallize in different ,  crystal packing arrangements, all of which have the same elemental composition. Different crystal forms usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectral, melting points, density hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability and solubility. Recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, storage temperature, and other factors may cause one crystal form to dominate. Crystal polymorphs of the compounds can be prepared by crystallization under different conditions.<br>
[000216]        Additionally, the compounds of the present invention, for example, the salts of the compounds, can exist in either hydrated or unhydrated (the anhydrous) form or as solvates with other solvent molecules. Nonlimiting examples of hydrates include monohydrates, dihydrates, etc. Nonlimiting examples of solvates include ethanol solvates, acetone solvates, etc.<br>
[000217]        "Solvates" means solvent addition forms that contain either stoichiometric or non stoichiometric amounts of solvent. Some compounds have a tendency to trap a fixed molar ratio of solvent molecules in the crystalline solid state, thus forming a solvate. If the solvent is water the solvate formed is a hydrate, when the solvent is alcohol, the solvate formed is an alcoholate. Hydrates are formed by the combination of one or more molecules of water with one of the substances in which the water retains its molecular state as H2O, such combination being able to form one or more hydrate.<br><br>
[000218]	"Tautomers" refers to compounds whose structures differ markedly in<br>
arrangement of atoms, but which exist in easy and rapid equilibrium. It is to be understood that compounds of Formula I may be depicted as different tautomers. It should also be understood that when compounds have tautomeric forms, all tautomeric forms are intended to be within the scope of the invention, and the naming of the compounds does not exclude any tautomer form.<br>
[000219]        Some compounds of the present invention can exist in a tautomeric form which are also intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention. [000220]        The compounds, salts and prodrugs of the present invention can exist in several tautomeric forms, including the enol and imine form, and the keto and enamine form and geometric isomers and mixtures thereof. All such tautomeric forms are included within the scope of the present invention. Tautomers exist as mixtures of a tautomeric set in solution. In solid form, usually one tautomer predominates. Even though one tautomer may be described, the present invention includes all tautomers of the present compounds [000221]        A tautomer is one of two or more structural isomers that exist in equilibrium<br>
	and are readily converted from one isomeric form to another. This reaction results in the	<br>
formal migration of a hydrogen atom accompanied by a switch of adjacent conjugated double bonds. In solutions where tautomerization is possible, a chemical equilibrium of the tautomers will be reached. The exact ratio of the tautomers depends on several factors, including temperature, solvent, and pH. The concept of tautomers that are interconvertable by tautomerizations is called tautomerism.<br>
[000222]	Of the various types of tautomerism that are possible, two are commonly<br>
observed. In keto-enol tautomerism a simultaneous shift of electrons and a hydrogen atom occurs. Ring-chain tautomerism, is exhibited by glucose. It arises as a result of the aldehyde group (-CHO) in a sugar chain molecule reacting with one of the hydroxy groups (-OH) in the same molecule to give it a cyclic (ring-shaped) form.<br>
[000223]        Tautomerizations are catalyzed by: Base: 1. deprotonation; 2. formation of a delocalized anion (e.g. an enolate); 3. protonation at a different position of the anion; Acid: 1. protonation; 2. formation of a delocalized cation; 3. deprotonation at a different position adjacent to the cation.<br>
[000224]        Common tautomeric pairs are: ketone - enol, amide - nitrile, lactam - lactim, amide - imidic acid tautomerism in heterocyclic rings (e.g. in the nucleobases guanine, thymine, and cytosine), amine - enamine and enamine - enamine. Examples include:<br><br><br>
[000225]        It will be noted that the structure of some of the compounds of the invention include asymmetric carbon atoms. It is to be understood accordingly that the isomers arising from such asymmetry (e.g., all enantiomers and diastereomers) are included within the scope of the invention, unless indicated otherwise. Such isomers can be obtained in substantially pure form by classical separation techniques and by stereochemically controlled synthesis.<br>
Furthermore, the structures and other compounds and moieties discussed in this application	<br>
also include all tautomers thereof. Alkenes can include either the E- or Z-geometry, where appropriate. The compounds of this invention may exist in stereoisomeric form, therefore can be produced as individual stereoisomers or as mixtures.<br>
[000226]        As used herein, the term "analog" refers to a chemical compound that is structurally similar to another but differs slightly in composition (as in the replacement of one atom by an atom of a different element or in the presence of a particular functional group, or the replacement of one functional group by another functional group). Thus, an analog is a compound that is similar or comparable in function and appearance, but not in structure or origin to the reference compound.<br>
[000227]	As defined herein, the term "derivative", refers to compounds that have a<br>
common core structure, and are substituted with various groups as described herein. For example, all of the compounds represented by formula I are indole derivatives, and have formula I as a common core.<br>
[000228]        The term "bioisostere" refers to a compound resulting from the exchange of an atom or of a group of atoms with another, broadly similar, atom or group of atoms. The objective of a bioisosteric replacement is to create a new compound with similar biological properties to the parent compound. The bioisosteric replacement may be physicochemically<br><br>
or topologically based. Examples of carboxylic acid bioisosteres include acyl sulfonimides, tetrazoles, sulfonates, and phosphonates. See, e.g., Patani and LaVoie, Chem. Rev. 96, 3147-3176(1996).<br>
[000229]        A "pharmaceutical composition" is a formulation containing the disclosed compounds in a form suitable for administration to a subject. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is in bulk or in unit dosage form. The unit dosage form is any of a variety of forms, including, for example, a capsule, an IV bag, a tablet, a single pump on an aerosol inhaler, or a vial. The quantity of active ingredient (e.g, a formulation of the disclosed compound or salt, hydrate, solvate, or isomer thereof) in a unit dose of composition is an effective amount and is varied according to the particular treatment involved. One skilled in the art will appreciate that it is sometimes necessary to make routine variations to the dosage depending on the age and condition of the patient. The dosage will also depend on the route of administration. A variety of routes are contemplated, including oral, pulmonary, rectal, parenteral, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, inhalational, buccal, sublingual, intrapleural, intrathecal, intranasal, and the<br>
	like. Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this	<br>
invention include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches<br>
and inhalants. In a preferred embodiment, the active compound is mixed under sterile<br>
conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, or<br>
propellants that are required.<br>
[000230]        The term "flash dose" refers to compound formulations that are rapidly<br>
dispersing dosage forms.<br>
[000231]        The term "immediate release" is defined as a release of compound from a<br>
dosage form in a relatively brief period of time, generally up to about 60 minutes. The term<br>
"modified release" is defined to include delayed release, extended release, and pulsed release.<br>
The term "pulsed release" is defined as a series of releases of drug from a dosage form. The<br>
term "sustained release" or "extended release" is defined as continuous release of a<br>
compound from a dosage form over a prolonged period.<br>
[000232]        A "subject" includes mammals, e.g., humans, companion animals (e.g., dogs,<br>
cats, birds, and the like), farm animals (e.g., cows, sheep, pigs, horses, fowl, and the like) and<br>
laboratory animals (e.g., rats, mice, guinea pigs, birds, and the like). Most preferably, the<br>
subject is human.<br>
[000233]        As used herein, the phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" refers to those<br>
compounds, materials, compositions, carriers, and/or dosage forms which are, within the<br><br>
scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.<br>
[000234]	"Pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" means an excipient that is useful in<br>
preparing a pharmaceutical composition that is generally safe, non-toxic and neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable, and includes excipient that is acceptable for veterinary use as well as human pharmaceutical use. A "pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" as used in the specification and claims includes both one and more than one such excipient.<br>
[000235]	The compounds of the invention are capable of further forming salts. All of<br>
these forms are also contemplated within the scope of the claimed invention.<br>
[000236]	"Pharmaceutically acceptable salt" of a compound means a salt that is<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable and that possesses the desired pharmacological activity of the parent compound.<br>
[000237]        As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines, alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids, and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non-toxic salts include, but are not limited to, those derived from inorganic and organic acids selected from 2-acetoxybenzoic, 2-hydroxyethane sulfonic, acetic, ascorbic, benzene sulfonic, benzoic, bicarbonic, carbonic, citric, edetic, ethane disulfonic, 1,2-ethane sulfonic, fumaric, glucoheptonic, gluconic, glutamic, glycolic, glycollyarsanilic, hexylresorcinic, hydrabamic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, hydroiodic, hydroxymaleic, hydroxynaphthoic, isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, lauryl sulfonic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methane sulfonic, napsylic, nitric, oxalic, pamoic, pantothenic, phenylacetic, phosphoric, polygalacturonic, propionic, salicyclic, stearic, subacetic, succinic, sulfamic, sulfanilic, sulfuric, tannic, tartaric, toluene sulfonic, and the commonly occurring amine acids, e.g., glycine, alanine, phenylalanine, arginine, etc.<br>
[000238]        Other examples include hexanoic acid, cyclopentane propionic acid, pyruvic acid, malonic acid, 3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, 4-chlorobenzenesulfonic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 4-toluenesulfonic acid,<br><br>
camphorsulfonic acid, 4-methylbicyclo-[2.2.2]-oct-2-ene-l-carboxylic acid, 3-phenylpropionic acid, trimethylacetic acid, tertiary butylacetic acid, muconic acid, and the like. The invention also encompasses salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound either is replaced by a metal ion, e.g., an alkali metal ion, an alkaline earth ion, or an aluminum ion; or coordinates with an organic base such as ethanolarnine, diethanolamine, triemanolamine, tromemamine, N-methylglucamine, and the like. [000239]        It should be understood that all references to pharmaceutically acceptable salts include solvent addition forms (solvates) or crystal forms (polymorphs) as defined herein, of the same salt<br>
[000240]        The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from a parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, non-aqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed. (Mack Publishing Company, 1990). For example, salts can include, but are not limited to, the hydrochloride and acetate salts of the aliphatic amine-containing, hydroxyl amine-containing, and imme-containing compounds of the present invention.<br>
[000241]	The compounds of the present invention can also be prepared as esters, for<br>
example pharmaceutically acceptable esters. For example a carboxylic acid function group in a compound can be converted to its corresponding ester, e.g., a methyl, ethyl, or other ester. Also, an alcohol group in a compound can be converted to its corresponding ester, e.g., an acetate, propionate, or other ester.<br>
[000242]	The compounds of the present invention can also be prepared as prodrugs, for<br>
example pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs. The terms "pro-drug" and "prodrug" are used interchangeably herein and refer to any compound which releases an active parent drug in vivo. Since prodrugs are known to enhance numerous desirable qualities of pharmaceuticals (e.g., solubility, bioavailability, manufacturing, etc.) the compounds of the present invention can be delivered in prodrug form. Thus, the present invention is intended to cover prodrugs of the presently claimed compounds, methods of delivering the same and compositions containing the same. "Prodrugs" are intended to include any covalentiy bonded carriers that release an active parent drug of the present invention in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a subject. Prodrugs the present invention are prepared by modifying<br><br>
functional groups present in the compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compound. Prodrugs include compounds of the present invention wherein a hydroxy, amino, sulfhydryl, carboxy, or carbonyl group is bonded to any group that, may be cleaved in vivo to form a free hydroxyl, free amino, free sulfhydryl, free carboxy or free carbonyl group, respectively. [000243]        Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, esters (e.g., acetate, dialkylaminoacetates, formates, phosphates, sulfates, and benzoate derivatives) and carbamates (e.g., N,N-dimemylaminocarbonyl) of hydroxy functional groups, esters groups (e.g. ethyl esters, morpholinoethanol esters) of carboxyl functional groups, N-acyl derivatives (e.g. N-acetyl) N-Mannich bases, Schiffbases and enaminones of amino functional groups, oximes, acetals, ketals and enol esters of ketone and aldehyde functional groups in compounds of Formula I, and the like, See Bundegaard, H. "Design of Prodrugs" pl-92, Elesevier, New York-Oxford (1985).<br>
[000244]	"Protecting group" refers to a grouping of atoms that when attached to a<br>
reactive group in a molecule masks, reduces or prevents that reactivity. Examples of protecting groups can be found in Green and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, (Wiley, 2nd ed. 1991); Harrison and Harrison etal., Compendium of Synthetic Organic Methods, Vols. 1-8 (John Wiley and Sons, 1971-1996); and Kocienski, Protecting Groups, (Verlag, 3rd ed. 2003).<br>
[000245]	The term "amine protecting group" is intended to mean a functional group that<br>
converts an amine, amide, or other nitrogen-containing moiety into a different chemical group that is substantially inert to the conditions of a particular chemical reaction. Amine protecting groups are preferably removed easily and selectively in good yield under conditions that do not affect other functional groups of the molecule. Examples of amine protecting groups include, but are not limited to, formyl, acetyl, benzyl, ^-butyldimethylsilyl, /-butdyldiphenylsilyl, 7-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc),j9-methoxybenzyl, methoxymethyl, tosyl, trifluoroacetyl, trimethylsilyl (TMS), fluorenyl-methyloxycarbonyl, 2-trimethylsilyl-ethyoxycarbonyl, l-methyl-l-(4-biphenylyl) ethoxycarbonyl, allyloxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ), 2-trimethylsilyl-ethanesulfonyl (SES), trityl and substituted trityl groups, 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (FMOC), nitro-veratryloxycarbonyl (NVOC), and the like. Other suitable amine protecting groups are straightforwardly identified by those of skill in the art.<br><br>
[000246]	Representative hydroxy protecting groups include those where the hydroxy<br>
group is either acylated or alkylated such as benzyl, and trityl ethers as well as alkyl ethers,<br>
tetrahydropyranyl ethers, trialkylsilyl ethers and allyl ethers.<br>
[000247]        "Stable compound" and "stable structure" are meant to indicate a compound<br>
that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction<br>
mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent<br>
[000248]        In the specification, the singular forms also include the plural, unless the<br>
context clearly dictates otherwise. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific<br>
terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill<br>
in the art to which this invention belongs. In the case of conflict, the present specification<br>
will control.<br>
[000249]	All percentages and ratios used herein, unless otherwise indicated, are by<br>
weight.<br>
[000250]	"Combination therapy" (or "co-therapy") includes the administration of a<br>
compound of the invention and at least a second agent as part of a specific treatment regimen<br>
intended to provide the beneficial effect from the co-action of these therapeutic agents. The<br>
beneficial effect of the combination includes, but is not limited to, pharmacokinetic or<br>
pharmacodynamic co-action resulting from the combination of therapeutic agents.<br>
Administration of these therapeutic agents in combination typically is carried out over a<br>
defined time period (usually minutes, hours, days or weeks depending upon the combination<br>
selected). "Combination therapy" may, but generally is not, intended to encompass the<br>
administration of two or more of these therapeutic agents as part of separate monotherapy<br>
regimens that incidentally and arbitrarily result in the combinations of the present invention.<br>
[000251]        "Combination therapy" is intended to embrace administration of these<br>
therapeutic agents in a sequential manner, that is, wherein each therapeutic agent is<br>
administered at a different time, as well as administration of these therapeutic agents, or at<br>
least two of the therapeutic agents, in a substantially simultaneous manner. Substantially<br>
simultaneous administration can be accomplished, for example, by administering to the<br>
subject a single capsule having a fixed ratio of each therapeutic agent or in multiple, single<br>
capsules for each of the therapeutic agents. Sequential or substantially simultaneous<br>
administration of each therapeutic agent can be effected by any appropriate route including,<br>
but not limited to, oral routes, intravenous routes, intramuscular routes, and direct absorption<br>
through mucous membrane tissues. The therapeutic agents can be administered by the same<br>
route or by different routes. For example, a first therapeutic agent of the combination<br>
70<br><br>
selected may be administered by intravenous injection while the other therapeutic agents of the combination may be administered orally. Alternatively, for example, all therapeutic agents may be administered orally or all therapeutic agents may be administered by intravenous injection. The sequence in which the therapeutic agents are administered is not narrowly critical.<br>
[000252]        "Combination therapy" also embraces the administration of the therapeutic<br>
agents as described above in further combination with other biologically active ingredients<br>
and non-drug therapies (e.g., surgery or radiation treatment) . Where the combination<br>
therapy further comprises a non-drug treatment, the non-drug treatment may be conducted at<br>
any suitable time so long as a beneficial effect from the co-action of the combination of the<br>
therapeutic agents and non-drug treatment is achieved. For example, in appropriate cases, the<br>
beneficial effect is still achieved when the non-drug treatment is temporally removed from<br>
the administration of the therapeutic agents, perhaps by days or even weeks.<br>
[000253]	Throughout the description, where compositions are described as having,<br>
including, or comprising specific components, it is contemplated that compositions also consist essentially of, or consist of, the recited components. Similarly, where processes are described as having, including, or comprising specific process steps, the processes also consist essentially of, or consist of, the recited processing steps. Further, it should be understood that the order of steps or order for performing certain actions are immaterial so long as the invention remains operable. Moreover, two or more steps or actions may be conducted simultaneously.<br>
[000254]	The compounds, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, is administered<br>
orally, nasally, transdermally, pulmonary, inhalationally, buccally, sublingually, intraperintoneally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intravenously, rectally, intrapleurally, intrathecally and parenterally. In a preferred embodiment, the compound is administered orally. One skilled in the art will recognize the advantages of certain routes of administration.<br>
[000255]        The dosage regimen utilizing the compounds is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, age, weight, sex and medical condition of the patient; the severity of the condition to be treated; the route of administration; the renal and hepatic function of the patient; and the particular compound or salt thereof employed. An ordinarily skilled physician or veterinarian can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter or arrest the progress of the condition.<br><br>
[000256]	Techniques for formulation and administration of the disclosed compounds of<br>
the invention can be found in Remington: the Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19  edition,<br>
Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA (1995). In an embodiment, the compounds described<br>
herein, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, are used in pharmaceutical<br>
preparations in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Suitable<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include inert solid fillers or diluents and sterile aqueous<br>
or organic solutions. The compounds will be present in such pharmaceutical compositions in<br>
amounts sufficient to provide the desired dosage amount in the range described herein.<br>
[000257]        In one embodiment, the compound is prepared for oral administration, wherein<br>
the disclosed compounds or salts thereof are combined with a suitable solid or liquid carrier<br>
or diluent to form capsules, tablets, pills, powders, syrups, solutions, suspensions and the like.<br>
[000258]	The tablets, pills, capsules, and the like contain from about 1 to about 99<br>
weight percent of the active ingredient and a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacias, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch or alginic acid; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and/or a<br>
sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose, saccharin, xylitol, and the like. When a dosage	<br>
unit form is a capsule, it often contains, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil.<br>
[000259]        In some embodiments, various other materials are present as coatings or to<br>
modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, in some embodiments, tablets are<br>
coated with shellac, sugar or both. In some embodiments, a syrup or elixir contains, in<br>
addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens<br>
as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor, and the like.<br>
[000260]	For some embodiments relating to parental administration, the disclosed<br>
compounds, or salts, solvates, tautomers or polymorphs thereof, can be combined with sterile aqueous or organic media to form injectable solutions or suspensions. Injectable compositions are preferably aqueous isotonic solutions or suspensions. The compositions may be sterilized and/or contain adjuvants, such as preserving, stabilizing, wetting or emulsifying agents, solution promoters, salts for regulating the osmotic pressure and/or buffers. In addition, they may also contain other therapeutically valuable substances. The compositions are prepared according to conventional mixing, granulating or coating methods, respectively, and contain about 0.1 to 75%, preferably about 1 to 50%, of the active ingredient.<br><br>
[000261 ]	For example, injectable solutions are produced using solvents such as sesame<br>
or peanut oil or aqueous propylene glycol, as well as aqueous solutions of water-soluble pharmaceutically-acceptable salts of the compounds. In some embodiments, dispersions are prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The terms "parenteral administration" and "administered parenterally" as used herein means modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal and intrastemal injection and infusion.<br>
[000262]        For rectal administration, suitable pharmaceutical compositions are, for example, topical preparations, suppositories or enemas. Suppositories are advantageously prepared from fatty emulsions or suspensions. The compositions may be sterilized and/or contain adjuvants, such as preserving, stabilizing, wetting or emulsifying agents, solution promoters, salts for regulating the osmotic pressure and/or buffers. In addition, they may also contain other therapeutically valuable substances. The compositions are prepared according to conventional mixing, granulating or coating methods, respectively, and contain about 0.1 to 75%, preferably about 1 to 50%, of the active ingredient.<br>
[000263]	In some embodiments, the compounds are formulated to deliver the active<br>
agent by pulmonary administration, e.g., administration of an aerosol formulation containing the active agent from, for example, a manual pump spray, nebulizer or pressurized metered-dose inhaler. In some embodiments, suitable formulations of this type also include other agents, such as antistatic agents, to maintain the disclosed compounds as effective aerosols.<br>
[000264]	A drug delivery device for delivering aerosols comprises a suitable aerosol<br>
canister with a metering valve containing a pharmaceutical aerosol formulation as described and an actuator housing adapted to hold the canister and allow for drug delivery. The canister in the drug delivery device has a headspace representing greater than about 15% of the total volume of the canister. Often, the polymer intended for pulmonary administration is dissolved, suspended or emulsified in a mixture of a solvent, surfactant and propellant. The mixture is maintained under pressure in a canister that has been sealed with a metering valve. [000265]        For nasal administration, either a solid or a liquid carrier can be used. The solid carrier includes a coarse powder having particle size in the range of, for example, from<br><br>
about 20 to about 500 microns and such formulation is administered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passages. In some embodiments where the liquid carrier is used, the formulation is administered as a nasal spray or drops and includes oil or aqueous solutions of the active ingredients.<br>
[000266]	Also contemplated are formulations that are rapidly dispersing dosage forms,<br>
also known as "flash dose" forms. In particular, some embodiments of the present invention are formulated as compositions that release their active ingredients within a short period of time, e.g., typically less than about five minutes, preferably less than about ninety seconds, more preferably in less than about thirty seconds and most preferably in less than about ten or fifteen seconds. Such formulations are suitable for administration to a subject via a variety of routes, for example by insertion into a body cavity or application to a moist body surface or open wound.<br>
[000267]	Typically, a "flash dosage" is a solid dosage form that is administered orally,<br>
which rapidly disperses in the mouth, and hence does not require great effort in swallowing<br>
and allows the compound to be rapidly ingested or absorbed through the oral mucosal<br>
membranes. In some embodiments, suitable rapidly dispersing dosage forms are also used in<br>
other applications, including the treatment of wounds and other bodily insults and diseased<br>
states in which release of the medicament by externally supplied moisture is not possible.<br>
[000268]	"Flash dose" forms are known in the art; see for example, effervescent dosage<br>
forms and quick release coatings of insoluble microparticles in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,578,322 and 5,607,697; freeze dried foams and liquids in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,642,903 and 5,631,023; melt spinning of dosage forms in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,855,326,5,380,473 and 5,518,730; solid, free-form fabrication in U.S. Pat. No. 6,471,992; saccharide-based carrier matrix and a liquid binder in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,587,172,5,616,344, 6,277,406, and 5,622,719; and other forms known to the art.<br>
[000269]	The compounds of the invention are also formulated as "pulsed release"<br>
formulations, in which the compound is released from the pharmaceutical compositions in a series of releases (i.e., pulses). The compounds are also formulated as "sustained release" formulations in which the compound is continuously released from the pharmaceutical composition over a prolonged period.<br>
[000270]        Also contemplated are formulations, e.g., liquid formulations, including cyclic or acyclic encapsulating or solvating agents, e.g., cyclodextrins, polyethers, or polysaccharides (e.g., methylcellulose), or more preferably, polyanionic (5-cyclodextrin derivatives with a sodium sulfonate salt group separate from the lipophilic cavity by an alkyl<br><br>
ether spacer group or polysaccharides. In a preferred embodiment, the agent is methylcellulose. In another preferred embodiment, the agent is a polyanionic p-cyclodextrin derivative with a sodium sulfonate salt separated from the lipophilic cavity by a butyl ether spacer group, e.g., CAPTISOL® (CyDex, Overland, KS). One skilled in the art can evaluate suitable agent/disclosed compound formulation ratios by preparing a solution of the agent in water, e.g., a. 40% by weight solution; preparing serial dilutions, e.g. to make solutions of 20%, 10, 5%, 2.5%, 0% (control), and the like; adding an excess (compared to the amount that can be solubilized by the agent) of the disclosed compound; mixing under appropriate conditions, e.g., heating, agitation, sonication, and the like; centrifuging or filtering the resulting mixtures to obtain clear solutions; and analyzing the solutions for concentration of the disclosed compound.<br>

Synthesis of Compound 3. KX1-306<br>
[000281]	The synthesis, outlined in Scheme 1, began with acid chloride formation of<br>
biphenylacetic acid followed by amide coupling with 3,5-dibenzyloxybenzylamine. A large number of impurities were introduced by acid chloride formation. However, other amide coupling procedures such as, for example, PyBOP or carbodiimides, can also be used in this reaction.<br>

Solvents were removed in vacuo and the residue was dissolved in DCM. 3,5-Dibenzyloxybenzylamine (1.1 eq) was added followed by TEA (1 eq). The reaction was then stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction was diluted to 45 mL (with DCM) and washed with 1 N HC1 (3X20<br>
L). saturated sodium bicarbonate (3X20 mL), and brine (3X20 mL). The Reaction was then	<br>
dried with sodium sulfate and removed in vacuo to give 330 mg of crude product. Silica gel chromatography (1:1 DCMrEtOAc (ethyl acetate)) gave 220 mg pure product.

-—Example 2nCdfGrowth Inhibition /<br>
""""[000360]        The drug concentration required to block net cell growth by 50% relative to a control sample is measured as the GI50. The GI50S for several of the compounds of the invention were assayed as described herein.<br>
[000361]   C The HT29 cell line is a NCI standard human colon carcinoma cell line/ HT-29 cells were obtained from ATCC at passage 125 and were used for inhibition studies between<br><br>
passage 126-151. HT29 cells were routinely cultured in McCoy's 5 A medium supplemented with Fetal Bovine Serum (1.5% v/v) and L-glutamine (2 mM). [000362]        The c-Src 3T3 is a mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 normal cell line that has been transfected with a point-mutant of human c-Src wherein tyrosine 527 has been converted to a phenylalanine. This mutation results in "constitutively active" c-Src because phosphorylation on tyrosine 527 results in auto-inhibition of Src by having it fold back on its own SH2 domain. With a Phe there, this phosphorylation can't occur and therefore auto-inhibition can't occur. Thus, the always fully active mutant Src then converts the normal mouse fibroblasts into rapidly growing tumor cells. Since the hyperactive Src is the main factor driving growth in these cells (particularly when cultured under low growth serum conditions), compounds active in blocking this growth are thought to work by blocking Src signaling (e.g. as a direct Src kinase inhibitor or as an inhibitor acting somewhere else in the Src signaling cascade). The cells were routinely cultured in DMEM supplemented with Fetal Bovine Serum (2.0% v/V), L-glutamine (2 mM) and Sodium Pyruvate (1 mM). [000363]        In the BrdU Assay for ceil growth inhibition, quantitation of cell proliferation<br>
	was-based-enthe^«easurement^f-©r4y4nGerp^^	<br>
Proliferation ELISA BrdU assay kit (colorimetric) was obtained from Roche Applied Science and performed as per vendor instructions.<br>
[000364]	Growth inhibition was expressed as a GI50 where the GI50 is the sample dose<br>
that inhibits 50% of cell growth. The growth inhibition (GI) is determined from the formula<br>
GI= (To-Tn xl 00/To-CONn) where T0 is the BrdU growth of untreated cells at time "0", T„ is<br>
the BrdU growth of treated cells at day V and CONn is the control BrdU growth of control<br>
cells at day "n". The GI50 was extrapolated and the data plotted using XL-Fit 4.0 software.<br>
[000365]        Actively growing cultures were trypsinized and cells were resuspended in<br>
190JJ.L of appropriate culture medium supplemented with 1.05% FBS in each well of a 96-<br>
well culture plate (1000 HT-29 cells ; 2500 c-Src 3T3 cells). For 96 well culture plate<br>
experiments, c-Src 3T3 medium was supplemented with 10 mM HEPES buffer. HT-29 cells<br>
were seeded in standard tissue culture 96-well plates and c-Src 3T3 cells were seeded in 96-<br>
well plates coated with Poly-D-lysine (BIOCOAT ™). To increase C02 diffusion, c-Src 3T3<br>
96-v/ell plates were incubated with their lids raised by ~2 mm using sterile rubber caps.<br>
[00 03 66]	Seeded 96 well plates were allowed to attach overnight for 18-24 hours, either<br>
at 37 °C and 5% C02 for HT-29 or at 37 °C and 10% C02 for c-Src 3T3. Approx 18-24 hours after seeding, the initial growth of cells (To) was determined for untreated cells using the BrdU assay. Samples were reconstituted in DMSO at 20 mM and intermediate dilutions<br><br>
made using DMEM containing 10% FBS. The final assay concentrations were 1.5% for FBS and 0.05% for DMSO. Samples were added as 10 uL aliquots in triplicate and plates were incubated as above for ~72 hours. Negative (vehicle) and positive controls {e.g., AZ (KX-328)) were included. Plates were assayed for BrdU and the data analyzed as above for<br>
GIso-<br>
[000367]        The results are shown in Table 3. In this table, the data is listed as Growth %<br>
of Control, such that a lower number at an indicated concentration indicates a greater potency<br>
of the compound in blocking growth of that tumor cell line. All compounds were initially<br>
prepared as 20 mM DMSO stock solutions and then diluted into buffer for the in vitro tumor<br>
growth assays. NG means no cell growth beyond the control and T means the number of<br>
cells in the drug treated wells was less than in the control (i.e. net cell loss). NT indicates that<br>
the test was not performed. Compound AZ (KX-328) is an ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase<br>
inhibitor, as described in Pie et al., J. Med. Chem, 47:871-887 (2004).<br>
[000368]	As shown in Table 3, GI50S were obtained for a number of the compounds in<br>
other cell lines. These GI50's were determined using the standard tumor growth inhibition<br>
	assay^similarte^foa^e^abed^	-<br>
lines: colon tumor cell lines KM12, lung cancer cell line H460 and lung cancer cell lineA549<br>
