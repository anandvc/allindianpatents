				<td>A ROUTING DEVICE AMD METHOD FOR ROUTING STREAMS AT A NODE IN A PACKET TRANSMISSION NETWORK.<br>
The present invention relates to routing devices for data transmission networks, and especially to routing devices having a capability to make decisions<br>
Communication networks in which data is transferred from a source to a destination in packets, each packet being sent in a series of steps from one component in the network to the next until it reaches its destination, are well known Some such networks attempt to deliver guarantees of bandwidth and specific limits on the delay that packets experience and the proportion of them that must be discarded during periods of congestion<br>
One problem in such networks is to be able to constrain the quantity of data admitted into the network in order to provide a good level of overall service One solution to this problem is to allow a source to introduce a senes of packets of data into the network onty after a request to do so has been accepted by the network (in a step referred to as a "call acceptance") In current networks, the decision whether or not to accept such a request is either made without considering the ability of the network to provide actual end-to-end requirements of the request or involves a centralised process that keeps track of the current set of requests accepted by the network as a whole In the first case no guarantees of service can be offered by the network, only promises to treat some packets relatively better than others, while in the second case the centralised process limits the call-acceptance performance of the network. In any event, in current networks guarantees of service can only be given on the condition of substantial under-utilisation of the network resources, to provide capacity for use by guaranteed quality services<br>
When a switch in a network is running at or close to its full capacity, performance deteriorates for all traffic (i e   the flow of packets of data as previously mentioned) unless some of the traffic is treated preferentially     Traditionally, congestion control mechanisms are introduced to manage traffic at the point when a queue at a switch<br><br>
2<br>
starts to become full. Adding more buffers can apparently control loss There is a penalty for this because the additional buffers introduce further delays and can lead to retransmission of traffic, and this then increases the congestion even more<br>
It is currently commonly understood in the academic literature as exemplified by Kleinrock, L "Queuing Systems Volume II Computer Applications", Wiley, New York, 1976 or Stallings, W, "High-Speed Networks. TCP/IP and ATM Design Principles", Prentice Hall, New Jersey, 1998 (both of which are hereby incorporated by reference) that as the demand at any switch approaches unity then the average queue size and delay grow without bound and this is true however switches are managed and whatever their configuration. Traditionally, congestion control mechanisms as described in Jain, R., "Congestion Control and Traffic Management in ATM Networks Recent Advances and A Survey", Computer Networks and ISDN Systems, vol 28, no 13, November 1996, pp1723-1738, are introduced to manage traffic at the point when the queue at a switch starts to become full. Adding more buffers can apparently control ioss. There is a penalty for this because the additional buffers introduce further delays and can lead to retransmission of traffic, and this then increases the congestion even more.<br>
There is a need to address these problems so as to be able to route transmissions with the possibility of improved service quality.<br>
The use of priority or weighted fair queuing is known, as is the use of selective discard to limit queue length, as described for instance in McDysan, D and Spohn, D. "ATM Theory and Application", McGraw-Hill, New York 1998 pp 630-632. However there is no simple method currently described for deciding whether to admit a call considering both its ioss and delay requirements exploiting the flexibility offered by the combination of these techniques<br>
WO 98/28939 describes a deterministic technique by which traffic is dynamically classified at a node and delivered downstream Transfers can be aborted due to delay tolerance being exceeded    By this means, a certain number of flows are guaranteed a<br><br>
3<br>
minimum bandwidth However, only performance at a single node is addressed, not end-to-end performance Furthermore, traffic is put into classes by the system, not on the basis of a user's decision.<br>
US 5,408,465 describes a system that offers soft deterministic guarantees that the end-to-end QoS (quality of service) is respected most of the time, and uses "pseudo-traffic" to decide whether to admit real traffic<br>
US 5,357,507 describes a system in which cell loss is the primary QoS parameter, relying on second derivatives of the input traffic stream characteristics. The system has 0 buffers WO 95/17061 describes a system in which cell loss is the primary QoS parameter, and which uses large-deviation theory. EP 0 673 138 A describes a deterministic system in which cell loss is the primary QoS parameter. EP 0 814 632 A describes a system in which cell loss is the primary QoS parameter, and which assumes strict priority queuing US 08/723,649 and equivalents describe a system in which cell loss or delay is the QoS parameter None of these systems considers both loss and delay in their QoS decision-making<br>
EP 0 828 362 A describes a system that uses a central network controller for CAC (call admission control), and does not provide guarantees for the duration of a connection.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a routing device for routing calls at a node in a packet transmission network, wherein each call is transmitted with specified parameters for its loss and delay in the network, the routing device comprising:<br>
call admission control circuitry for receiving a call request and for reading:<br>
(i) said specified parameters and any values for loss and delay already incurred at preceding nodes in the network, or<br>
(ii) said specified parameters as modified to take account of loss and delay already incurred at preceding nodes in the network,<br><br>
4<br>
to determine in conjunction with existing calls already being handled by the routing device whether or not to accent or reject the call,<br>
buffer circuitry including a plurality of buffers, wherein one or more of said buffers are allotted to said call if the call request has been accepted, and means for transmitting<br>
(i) the call request with modified values for loss and delay, or (II) the call request with modified parameters to take account of loss and delay incurred at this and preceding nodes in the network,<br>
if the call request has been accepted, and for returning a fail signal if the call request has been rejected<br>
Preferably the routing device includes means for detecting a call fail signal from another node in the network and for releasing the buffers which it had allocated for that call<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a routing device for routing calls at a node in a packet transmission network,  wherein each call  is transmitted with specified parameters for its acceptable delay and probability of loss during transmission in the network, the routing device comprising . call admission control circuitry for:<br>
(i) receiving a call request comprising parameters for quality of service,<br>
(ii) modelling the quality of service for the call if it were routed through this node,<br>
(iii) generating adjusted parameters for quality of service by adjusting the received parameters for quality of service to take account of reduction in auality of service if the call were routed through this node,<br>
(iv) if the adjusted parameters are indicative of unacceptable quality of service rejecting the call, and<br><br>
5<br>
(v) if the adjusted parameters are indicative of acceptable quality of service transmitting the adjusted parameters to another node in the network<br>
The said parameters for quality of service preferably include at least two of minimum delay, maximum loss rate and minimum throughput, and/or levels of variation of delay, loss rate or throughput, and extremes of likely values<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided in a network having one or more nodes for traffic having a variety of requerments, a means whereby a network node having finite resources to allocate (in particular the capacity of network links  which   it  drives   and   its   internal  capacity to   hold  packets  of data   for later transmission) may decide whether it is capable of agreeing to a request (whether implicit or explicit) to support a stream, or collection of streams, of data through it having certain characteristics of data loss and delay, given that a number of other streams or collection of streams are already supported, without engaging in any interactions with other network nodes or keeping information about streams supported by other nodes in<br><br>
6<br>
the network, in such a way that the overall end-to-end requirements of the stream can be satisfied, this means consisting of<br>
1	Maintaining within the node information on each stream of data passing through it, in<br>
particular the accumulated loss and delay of that stream between its source and the<br>
appropriate output link of the node, including the loss and delay imposed by the<br>
node itself the network link bandwidth and internal buffer capacity allocated.<br>
2	Identifying an incoming message as a request to support a new stream of data;<br>
3	Determining from the incoming request the requested maximum loss and delay and<br>
the loss and delay accumulated so far,<br>
4	Applying a parameter to determine what proportion of the difference between the<br>
requested maximum loss and delay and the loss and delay accumulated so far can<br>
be added by this node so as to arrive at a quantity of loss and delay which can be<br>
added,<br>
5	Performing a calculation, either by application of the described algorithm or by<br>
reference to a pre-computed look-up in a table, to establish the additional capacities<br>
needed to support the additional loss and delay to be imposed on the stream,<br>
6	Checking whether these additional capacities are available, and<br>
7	If they are<br>
a updating the message requesting the stream to be established so that the accumulated loss and delay are increased by the loss and delay imposed by the multiplexing of streams onto the network link by the node and sending it on the next stage of its route,<br>
b adding the information regarding this stream to that already held regarding other streams, and<br>
c   computing the optimal allocation of the complete set of streams to the available<br>
resources, and 8    If they are not, returning the message requesting the stream to its source with an<br>
indication that the request is rejected<br>
The requested maximum loss and delay and the loss and delay accumulated so far of the request may suitably be extracted from the request message    The parameter to<br><br>
7<br>
determine what proporition of the difference between the requested maximum loss and delay and the loss and delay accumulated so far can be added by this node so as to arrive at a quantity of loss and delay which can be added may be pre-programmed. The parameter to determine what proportion of the difference between<br>
the requested maximum loss and delay and the loss and delay accumulated so far can be added by this node so as to arrive at a quantity of loss and delay which can be added may suitably be computed from the route taken by the request message The computation of the optimal allocation of the complete set of streams to the available resources may suitably be performed before the request is sent on to the next node The computation of the optimal allocation of the complete set of streams to the available resources may suitably be performed after the request is sent on to the next node The contents of the look-up table may suitably be calculated by solving a certain system of equations representing the operational behaviour of the node The call acceptance message suitably contains information of the surplus loss and delay budget of the end-to-end call, which the node reduces before it sends it on and increases its stored excess budget for use by a subsequent call<br>
It is preferred that in a system according to the present invention queue sizes may be controlled in order to maximise effective throughput and reduce delay. Packet losses may preferably be balanced against throughput and delay The network can then preferably run at full or substantially full utilisation whatever the demand upon it, up to a limit imposed by the network's capacity<br>
It is preferred that steps are not taken to avoid packet loss at all costs. However, packet loss is preferably a QoS parameter, most preferably by the specification of a finite nonzero packet loss rate When the system is running at close to full capacity it is preferred that some traffic will be expected to be lost This loss may suitably be applied equally to. all traffic streams, so that all traffic is equivalents degraded by the congestion it is preferably possible for some traffic to be "cherished" (i e not lost) more, while other traffic (suitably traffic such as voice data that is more urgent and will be useful only if it arrives with a short delay) is not delayed more   This is because if traffic is arriving at its<br><br>
s<br>
destination too late to be of use to an application then it is already effectively lost and it is inappropriate to congest a network with traffic that cannot be delivered on time In general, it is most preferred that both delay and foss can be set and limited in order to retain reasonable system performance<br>
Preferably the system provides strong statistical guarantees of how much of the time a designated QoS is respected The system may use an operational model and/or statistical methods The QoS analysed by the system preferably specifies end-to-end QoS performance for a message<br>
Preferably means is provided whereby a network node that has finite resources to be allocated (especially the capacity of network links which it drives and its internal capacity to hold packets of data for later transmission) may decide whether it is capable of agreeing to a request to support a stream of data through it having certain characteristics of data loss and delay, given that a number of other streams are already supported, without engaging in any interactions with other network nodes or keeping information about streams supported by other nodes in the network, in such a way that the overall end-to-end requirements of the stream can be satisfied To achieve this the following steps are preferably performed<br>
1	Maintaining within the node information on each stream of data passing through it, in<br>
particular the accumulated loss and delay of that stream between its source and the<br>
appropriate output link of the node, including the loss and delay imposed by the<br>
node itself the network link bandwidth and internal buffer capacity allocated,<br>
2	Identifying an incoming message as a request to support a new stream of data,<br>
3.   Extracting from the incoming request the requested maximum loss and delay and<br>
the loss and delay accumulated so far, 4   Applying   a   pre-programmed   parameter   to   determine   what   proportion   of   the<br>
difference between the requested maximum loss and delay and the loss and delay<br>
accumulated so far can be added by this node so as to arrive at a quantity of loss<br>
and delay which can be added,<br><br>
5	Performing a look-up in a table (which may be calculated by solving a certain system<br>
of equations representing the operational behaviour of the node) to establish the<br>
additional capacities needed to support the additional loss and delay to be imposed<br>
on the stream,<br>
6	Checking whether these additional capacities are available, and<br>
7	If they are<br>
a updating the message requesting the stream to be established so that the accumulated loss and delay are increased by the loss and delay imposed by the multiplexing of streams onto the network link by the node and sending it on the next stage of its route;<br>
b adding the information regarding this stream to that already held regarding other streams, and<br>
c   computing the optimal allocation of the complete set of streams to the available<br>
resources, or 8    If they are not, returning the message requesting the stream to its source with an<br>
indication that the request is rejected<br>

Admitting a call or generally a data stream into a network requires confidence that the interaction between that call's traffic and existing traffic is benign in making service level agreements this principle is given a monetary value In this paper we describe the application of a probabilistic approach to call management. This model can be used to derive very conservative performance bounds where this is required, or to evaluate the dynamic probabilities of meeting particular service levels<br>
A large class of network applications, particularly real time applications such as telephony, can only operate satisfactorily when a network can reliably provide quality of service This requires the ability for applications, directly or indirectly, to negotiate with the network to ensure that network delays do not impinge on the application's functionality<br>
The product of these negotiations are Service Level Agreements, they define the acceptable Quality of Service in terms which are both measurable and assurable, they constitute a contractual agreement between the network user and the network In fact, they define the worst acceptable case for data transmission over the connection In admitting a call there is an explicit recognition that the agreed level of service can be provided for the call's duration Allocating resources on the basis of peak demand for each connection is one approach that guarantees this, however it does not allow for the exploitation of the statistical multiplexing of the traffic in the aggregation of the flow In order to evaluate call admission, yet still exploit statistical multiplexing, there is a need<br><br>
11<br>
to produce a model of how the individual streams of data will interact, and which predicts the likely service offered to individual cells and streams If a switch is able, prior to call acceptance, to evaluate the typical cell delay, and probability of cell loss or of cells experiencing unacceptable delay, and manipulate its commitment of resources to ensure that these values fall within limits defined as acceptable by a SLA then it would be in a position to both ensure it meets its commitments, and to maximise the number of SLAs it can undertake.<br>
These   probabilities   are   defined   fundamentally   by   the   node's   available   buffering resources and the switch load<br>
It is generally a simple matter to provide guaranteed quality of service across a network with low utilisation, however, once the network approaches full loading the problem of resource   allocation   becomes   harder    Since   Service   Level   Agreements   form   a contractual obligation for the network, it is imperative that they are only undertaken when there are suitable resources available to meet them   Generally, the difficulties associated  with  managing  an overloaded  network are complicated  by the  lack of knowledge about the behaviour of the system in that state. The techniques described here exploit a new operational model having two degrees of freedom, which we can exploit by choosing to fix one parameter - preferably loss - and hence we are able to evaluate the consequences of different allocations on the total delay and throughput requirements for the calls through the switch This model is theoretically unconditionally stable, even when under overload, and can be used to provide limiting values on Quality of Service parameters that are theoretically always valid<br>
This model is based largely on the consideration of packet loss and delay within a framework that corresponds closely to the actual operation of real network equipment In such equipment packets are rarely lost due to transmission errors, the main source of ioss is the lack of buffers to store the packet/cell for onward transmission Our approach has to been to model the configuration of the system to sustain an agreed (and negotiated) level of loss for a particular stream This loss can be predicted (within the<br><br>
knowledge of the traffic patterns) for the aggregated set of current calls The same queuing process also determines the variation in delay, as well as its mean values These observations allow for created a class of models of finite buffer systems The most significant feature of these models is their description of the relationship between throughput, loss and delay (see diagram above) which allows a quantitative understanding of how to distribute switch resources amongst the active calls<br>
It is obvious that an overloaded node must discard cells Since the routing node also has to meet its SLA commitments, however, it is required to discard cells intelligently. In these models two attributes of each cell strearn may be considered the desire to not discard<br>
the cell from a stream, which we name 'cherish', and the desire to minimise the transit delay of cells from a stream, which we name 'urgency' Our model considers a cell stream to be classified by these two parameters Considering two discrete levels of each of these parameters we arrive at the following distinct quality classes<br><br>
Thus the switch can preferentially discard cells from streams whose SLAs allow a higher loss rate, this, combined with an intelligent CAC model, allows extremely tight bounds to be set on the loss rate for cherished traffic Since this model scales to cover an indefinite number of urgency and loss-tolerance classes, it can provide all the subdivisions of cell disposability required to implement a number of arbitrary Service Level agreements simultaneously.<br>
Although uncherished traffic may appear to suffer heavily as a result of this discard policy, it actually suffers a lower mean delay For many of the applications most dependant on reliable Quality of Service provision (for example, video streaming) delay is a more important consideration than loss rates, since packets substantially delayed by a congested queuing system cannot be used on their eventual arrival. Similarly, at any given moment, the total delay experienced by cells passing through a given node can also be distributed to traffic streams of different urgency classes<br><br>
15<br>
This operational model effectively maps cell streams  into particular service classes<br>
defined by their urgency and cherish levels   Given a set of these mappings - for example, the set of calls that describes a large part of a switching node's state- and the throughput requested for each of those calls, it is possible to calculate the loss rate mean and distribution, and   the   delay  mean and distribution both for  each service class and  the node as a whole<br>
Of course, a connection's Quality of Service requirements are not specified on the level of individual nodes, but end to end A crucial aspect of this model is it's composability, that is to say, the state of the switches along a path can be used to calculate similar key Quality of Service parameters, including the end to end mean loss rate and delay, and the delay's probability distribution function. This therefore provides the predictive model required to assess and optimise the resource commitment required to ensure a cell stream's Service Level Agreement is honoured, it allows probabilistic guarantees to be made regarding honouring the SLA<br>
Since any real switch has only a finite quantity of resources, it is obvious that not all requested calls can be accepted A switch, therefore, must try to optimise the number of calls it can accept, whilst ensuring that it oniy rarefy fails to meet calls' Quality of Service requirements.<br>
This operational model has immediate applications for Connection Admittance Control (CAC) and QoS guarantees. Once a physical route for the connection has been found, it allows us to ensure incrementally that there are sufficient network resources along it to meet the connection's QoS requirements This is done on a per switch basis, using only local knowledge (essentially, the switch's existing commitments in the form of SLAs and other QoS agreements on current connections); this allows a quick decision to be made on call acceptance without additional inter-switch control traffic This bodes well for the scalability of the decision algorithm<br>
Figure 1 shows a data communication network    Data can be communicated between any two of the connected terminal units 1 over data links 2 between switches 3    The<br><br>
14<br>
switches 3 determine the route that the data is to follow, A message at a sending terminal can be divided into datagrams (packets) for transmission, which are then reassembled at the receiving terminal The datagrams of a single message should follow the same route, constituting a call The route taken by each message, and the status of the links and switches it encounters on its route, determine the delay between sending and receiving of packets of the message, and may cause some or all of the packets to be lost    if the packet contains data for a time-critical service such as voice<br>
telephony then the delay between the packet being sent and received must be small if there is to be an acceptable standard of service.  The size of the delay relative to the<br>
acceptable standard of service will be implementation dependent<br>
For a network connection with finite resources, delay, throughput and loss rate are interrelated A detailed consideration of the relationship between these three factors can allow for improved balancing of resources to ensure that as many connections as are possible are accepted in a communication network For example, under an improved regime it may be possible for a switch to meet otherwise unattainable delay requirements by allocating substantially more average bandwidth than was originally requested The detail of the relationship between delay, throughput and ioss rate is defined by the operational behaviour of the switching elements in the network, which may be a function of parameters that can be optimised<br>
Figure 2 shows the structure of an improved packet switch unit, which could act as one of the switches 3 of figure 1 The packet switch unit comprises a packet switch 20 connected to a decider 21 The decider comprises a storage means 22, tcmporary registers 23 and logic 24 (for example a processor) which can act on the contents of the registers to perform comparisons and manipulations of selected bit-fields The logic 24 is connected so that it can read and write values to a memory 22 The packet switch 20 is able to distinguish request packets from other packets and to write them in to the memory for operation upon by the decider. It can also read the (possibly modified) packet from the memory and transmit tt The decider has the ability to indicate to the switch when the packet is to be transmitted and also to set the parameters of the switch that determine the details of the switch behaviour.<br><br>

Figure 3 illustrates the functionality of a switch unit for dealing with a request to establish a new connection Each switch along the connection route followed by a packet consumes a portion of the connection's acceptable delay and loss 'budget' and offers the remainder of that budget to switches further down the route Using the functionality illustrated in figure 3 the delay and loss budget is analysed by switching elements along the route to determine the characteristics of the connection The analysis of the budget consumption is done by means of the operational model of the switching element and the current configuration (encoded in the tables shown below) Instead of making a connection that results eventually in unacceptable loss or delay, using the functionality of figure 3 a connection can be rejected immediately if there is insufficient budget (i.c loss or delay) remaining for the connection to be established, otherwise the request is passed (with [educed budget) on to the next switching element Eventually n message is returned from the destination This will either be a call acceptance (in which case the actual switch configuration is updated to accommodate the new connection) or a rejection, from some element further along the route (in which case the resources allocated to this connection are released) In either case the message is passed back towards the originator of the request as indicated by the arrow to the left<br>
In more detail, the process of establishing a connection for data along a path between a start node and an end node across a plurality of links joined by switch units of the type shown in figure 2 is as follows. The start node, the system or a user of the start or end node establishes a budget of total acceptable delay and loss for the connection This is transmitted to the first switch on the path (arrow 30 in figure 3) The switch applies its operational model (at 31) to determine it and its associated link's effect on a packet, modifies the budget information accordingly to indicate the amount of the budget available to succeeding switches and links of the path, and if there is budget remaining it transmits the updated budget information (at 32) to the next succeeding switch, The next succeeding switch performs the same operation If the budget is exceeded then a message is sent (at 33) to means 34 for accepting or rejecting a connection, to cause the means 34 to reject the connection by sending a reject message (at 35) to the next<br><br>
16<br>
preceding switch    The means 34 can also reject the connection in the same way if it receives a reject message (at 36) from the next succeeding switch   The means 34 can accept the connection if it receives an accept message (at 37) from the next succeeding switch    Accept messages are initiated by the end node receiving a message from the last succeeding switch indicating that the totai available budget is not exceeded for the connection.  If the  connection  is  accepted  then  the  connection  establishment  and  termination processing means 34 transmits a configuration message at 38 to configure the switching element 39 of the switch to cause the data to follow the accepted route through the switch towards the next succeeding switch in the agreed path<br>
The operational model (illustrated at 31 in figure 3) for the switch and its use in call acceptance and control is of importance to define the relationship between the aggregate requirements of the set of streams destined for a particular outgoing link and the required resources associated with that link, and between requirements for loss and delay<br>
Consider the combination of a single output port from a switch, this can be viewed as a multiplexer combining the routed input streams from input ports or as a single device<br>
operating  where the potential maximum input  as a result of the routed  input  streams to the<br>
multiplexer exceeds the output capacity of the multiplexer<br>
During operation of the switching element/multiplexer there may be times at which the rate of arrival of packets will exceed the output capacity.   During these periods there will<br>
be the need to store the excess incoming packets in buffers, otherwise they will be lost There will be occasions when there will be no buffers available for allocation to the<br>
packets from the input streams.   The frequency of these occasions increases as the total capacity of the output link is allocated. Under these cricumstances packets will have to be<br>
discarded Discarding is required both by the physical requirement that memory is finite and to ensure that the switch will recover from overload conditions (by emptying its buffers) within a finite time<br><br>
17<br>
The total amount of such buffering can be allocated amongst the input streams in many ways Each of these ways will implicitly define the loss characteristics of each of the streams We term this operation of such a multiplexer for a given configuration of buffer capacity to input streams a behaviour of the multiplexer<br>
The behaviour of such a multiplexer is a system that has two degrees of freedom, because setting any two of the loss rate, throughput and delay fixes the value of the third of those parameters For example, having decided the loss rates this constrains the operation of the multiplexer to a particular relationship between throughput and delay   For a given set of input streams the relationship is predictable<br>
To optimise behaviour it is, in general, necessary to first assure that the operation will fulfil the quality of service requirements of one of the parameters and then optimise with respect to the remaining degrees of freedom This requirement needs to be met on both a stream-by-stream basis and collectively for the aggregation of all streams<br>
To illustrate this approach consider a mechanism in which the loss parameter is first considered     The physical  instantiation is that of a shared buffer pool for all input streams, there being counters of the instantaneous occupancy of the buffers that can be consulted at the arrival time of a packet at the multiplexer    In particular, consider that there  are  two classes  of input streams,  one that  contains  traffic that should  be preferentially  cherished  over other,   uncherished  streams      This  procedure  can  be generalised to the case when there are more than two classes of input streams with different levels of preferential cherishing    Equation B below allows for the calculation of the number of buffers that should be reserved for the sole use of such cherished streams      This   number   is   calculated   under   the   assumption   that   the   incoming unchenshed traffic is unbounded and tending towards infinity.   This number of buffers gives an unconditional guarantee that the loss rate of the incoming cherished traffic will be below the bounds required     It is this approach that makes the present method unconditionally stable<br><br>
18<br>
Let the total number of such reserved buffers be Kmax - K8. where Kmax is the total amount of buffering available and K8 is the amount to which all traffic (regardless of whether cherished or not) is admitted The assignment of a value to this difference represents fixing one of the degrees of freedom in the system Given this, Kmax can now be chosen to bound the total delay in the system for all the streams (as given by equation A below) such that all the delay requirements can be met given the implemented queuing discipline which distributes the delay across all the streams<br><br>
in order to be able to deliver traffic with a particular quality of service a prediction must be made of how much it is delayed by queuing This is found from the waiting time distributions for each type of traffic and they can be obtained quite readily. The expected value of the waiting time distribution gives the average delay of the traffic and the standard deviation gives a measure of the variability of the delay (which may be regarded as the delay jitter) For unchenshed traffic the waiting time density function is given by<br><br>
(equation A)    The qbn are the probabilities that an arriving packet, that actually enters the queue finds n packets already in the system<br>
For cherished traffic the waiting time density function is given by<br><br>
19<br><br><br><br>
20<br><br>
where   is the rate of arrival of the traffic to be preferentially cherished.   is the rate of arrival of relatively un-cherished traffic,   is the rate at which traffic is served<br>
Po is found from the solution of<br><br>
The existence of a quantitative relationship between these parameters allows optimisations of the switch's operational model to be performed using standard techniques.<br>
It is important to note that the operational mode! allows tradeoffs to be done between loss/delay or throughput/buffers, i e an optimisable CAC is provided, to which standard techniques such as linear programming, neural networks, fuzzy logic etc. can be applied to achieve the optimisation Any such optimisations can occur over different timescales and at different stages of the call-acceptance/call-teardown This could include, but is not limited to<br><br>
(0)      Optimising resource use for the existing set of   active   (or   committed   to)   calls   before receipt of a call request (1)      Calculating and allocating resources to the call request under consideration (2)      Optimising resources for the existing set of<br><br>
21<br><br><br><br>
The relationship for wB(t) given above indicates that the total amount of delay that non-discard cells will experience is dependent on the aggregate arrival rate of all the accepted connections Where facilities exist in the switch this delay can be apportioned in different fractions to classes of streams (eg Weighted fair Queuing, Priority Queuing) Such models are not strictly necessary to make use of this approach as bounds on delay can be calculated for queuing disciplines such as first-in first-out.<br>
There is flexibility in assessing the criteria for calf acceptance In general to come to a decision it is first necessary to assess the capability of system to support an individual parameter (e g loss rate - is there sufficient buffering resource to assure the required loss rate at the required arrival rate for this connection) This can be achieved through the application of the following equation.<br>
P<br><br><br>
(equation B) where P is the desired probability of loss and Pp is the load of the traffic to be given preferential treatment in case of resource contention Having made this decision and chosen a suitable value for this parameter this would define a quantifiable relationship between the remaining two parameters (e g delay and throughput) This decision can be made by calculating the total delay that will be present in the system after the acceptance of the call (an example of such a computation is given in the above<br><br>
22<br>
equation for wB(t)) and comparing this with the sum of allowances for delay for all the current connections The decision can then be made as to whether sufficient capacity exists to satisfy the constraint (e.g is there sufficient un-allocated throughput to allocate to this connection to reduce the delay experienced at this node to an acceptable level) This ordering is only one possible order of considering the parameters - taking loss first and trading deiay for throughput, similar approaches exist choosing one of the other parameters to be initially assessed against<br>
In taking into consideration a bound on the loss rate for a call we are excluding the calculations necessary to admit calls in which there is no bound on the loss (commonly called 'best-effort' traffic within the internet community) As there are no guarantees associated with such calls, such calls can always be admitted provided their effect on other calls is sufficiently benign<br>
The procedure to admit a call is as follows    Note that in this description "throughput" means "mean throughput"     Each  accepted stream has associated with it a set of parameters including throughput, loss rate and delay, which may be stored in a table held in memory as indicated by the set of options for pn set out in the example above There is also a currently allocated throughput, an imposed total delay and an aggregate loss rate for the link   The sum of the throughputs of the streams should be less than or equal to the allocated throughput of the link the sum of the delay bounds of the streams must be greater than or equal to the total delay applied to all streams (equivalent to the total amount of buffering allocated for the queues), and the sum of the loss rates of the streams must be greater than or equal to the aggregate loss applied to all streams Strictly, instead of the allocated throughput of the link the sum of the product of (1 -acceptable loss rate) and the required throughput should be used, but it is usual that the acceptable loss rate is so low that it is practical to use the approximation of the allocated throughput of the link<br>
As  illustrated  in  figure  3,  each  switch  along  the  route  consumes  a  portion of the connection s acceptable delay and loss 'budget' and offers the remainder of that budget<br><br>
25<br>
to switches further down the route The knowledge of the relationship between throughput, delay and loss allows a balancing of resources to ensure that as many connections as are possible are accepted by the CAC, for example, a switch can meet otherwise unattainable delay requirements by allocating substantially more bandwidth than was originally requested In fact, the relationship between throughput, loss and delay described above allows these variables to be traded off against one another in order to produce the combinations of requirements requested by a user The QoS requirements of all current local connections, therefore, dictate the behaviour of the node's switching element in terms of both the call acceptance and the moment-by-moment operational characteristics of the switching element<br>
There, in principle, exists a choice as to whether to "hoard" the bandwidth or the delay -with the operational model giving the ability to predict their interaction with the collection of calls that the switch is processing This allows for deriving a both an instantaneous cost for carrying this call (dependent on the current call configuration) and some measure of a generic cost for carrying such calls It also allows for the assessment of differing switching configuration strategies<br>
What this CAC model arms to ensure, therefore, is the ability to calculate the effect of call acceptance on previously contracted node commitments, and hence the probability that acceptance will cause the switch to violate either the new or previously accepted traffic contracts.<br>
To illustrate how the Call acceptance may be executed in practice, whilst maintaining the Quality of Service already assigned to traffic streams, we consider the following worked example.<br>
Figure 15 represents a small portion of a larger network, with switches A, B and C and cell streams represented by arrows<br><br>
24<br>
The arm of this example is to illustrate the effect of adding a new stream between Ao and Co, showing how the relevant calculations would be performed, and how the acceptance of this call would affect the existing traffic through the network<br>
The following table describes the existing set of calls on this section of the network, and their quality requirements (as expressed in their call request packets) To simplify the calculations we have normalised the throughput of a link to be one The delay values are then in terms of a transmission time of an ATM cell over that link, A nominal rate of 400,000 cells/sec has been used to normalise durations<br><br><br>
This allows calculation of the number of buffers (Kmax - KB) which have to be reserved at a local switch to ensure that the loss rates for cherished traffic can be achieved This formula is for the limit of loss as the non-cherished traffic tends to infinity Having calculated the number of buffers for the required loss rate this reduces the operational model to two degrees of freedom Although it would be now possible to allocate by fixing the delay needed and hence overallocating throughput, fixing the throughput to that requested will be illustrated  This allows calculation of the actual loss probability for<br><br>
25<br>
cherished and uncherished loss using the formulae given above Knowledge of the probability of all the buffers reserved for unchenshed traffic being full allows the calculation of the loss rates for such traffic streams<br>
Returning to figure 15 in this configuration network Switch A contains no urgent traffic The use of equation B allows the bounding of the number of buffers needed to ensure acceptable loss under all circumstances The choice of 20 represents one more than the asymptotic minimum of 19 required for a loss rate of 10-6 In switch A there are 50 allocated buffers, of which twenty have been reserved for the cherished traffic In switch B there are only 30 allocated buffers of which 15 have been reserved for cherished traffic In this particular circumstance the link to switch C, and hence the output links, are lightly loaded, this switch has lots of flexibility in its configuration The effects of this switch traffic are not calculated here<br>
These  calculations  lead  to  the  tabie  of attributes  shown  in  figure  16   The  buffer configuration (N/M) should be read as N buffers retained for cherished traffic out of M The budget and mean delay figures refer to the amount of budget retained and the actual consumption of loss or delay that the cell stream will experience during operation<br>
The decisions and the consequential effects of adding the connection A0 - C0 will now be considered To allow for the loss rates to be sustained, the decision has to be made to allocate more buffers to the cherishing of data (through use of equation B) With this configuration , previously contracted loss rates for the existing calls can be sustained as well as allowing for the admission of the current call The switch configurations after the call has been accepted is documented in figure 17<br>
Practical applications of this technique may call for a refinement of the intermediate switches' share of a calls' loss and delay budget, once an acceptable route through the network has been found This redistribution allows nodes to offer a large amount of resources to the call during the set-up phase (and hence minimise their consumption of the calls' loss and delay budget) without more network resources being committed to<br><br>
26<br>
the call than is strictly necessary This can be done utilising the Call Accept packet as it passes back through the established route<br>
To ensure QoS requirements the notion of a call has to exist This is true in ATM, for IP the use of some additional management information such as RSVP performs this function The present approach is equally applicable to both network technologies The present model is theoretically unconditionally stable and provides guarantees even under extreme network overload (i e extended periods where network bandwidth and buffer resources are insufficient to meet demand) Coupled with its applications in Call Acceptance, switches designed with this model in mind may ensure that SLAs and related contracts will be honoured regardless of the state of the network The ability to calculate loss for streams over the whole of their end-to-end route could be used to provide feedback for certain classes of traffic (for example best effort IP traffic) to attempt to limit loss late in the route<br>
The model presented can be scaled to offer any number of service levels and clearly differentiates between the handling of traffic of different classes Distinct classes of traffic can be allocated different quantities of resources during transit, meaning that grades of traffic can be easily distinguished and allowing the cost of QoS classes in terms of resource utilisation to be accurately assessed This clear separation of traffic classes and accurate connection costing in turn allows for the introduction of charging mechanisms The model is also adaptable to describe a variety of low-level switch management algorithms<br>
Figure 4 shows the state-transition diagram for a simple operational model with two levels of cell-loss priority (cherishing)<br>
As an example, figure 5 shows the situation for a switch where cherished traffic arrives at a rate of 0 7 of the service rate (i e pp =   = 0 7) and where we require that less than one in a million of packets are lost (i e P=10-b) In Figure 5 the top line 50 represents the total amount of traffic arriving at the network node    The next lower line<br><br>
27<br>
51 represents the total amount of traffic that is serviced plotted against the demand for uncherished traffic The lowest line 52 shows the amount of uncherished traffic that is serviced The thick dashed line 53 represents the amount of cherished traffic that is serviced, and it should be noticed that it is almost uninfluenced by the demand for unchenshed traffic Figures 6 and 7 give an indication of the loss rate/throughput/delay relationship, under the same conditions as for figure 5 Figure 6 shows how the average deiay of all traffic increases as the number of buffers allocated to "best effort" (unchenshed) traffic increases The delay is measured in units of time where the service rate is chosen to be one As the total demand increases above one the delay increases linearly with the number of buffers Figure 7 shows the total loss of all traffic For fixed utilisation the loss decreases as the number of buffers increases As throughput increases the total loss increases<br>
Figure 8 shows the state-transition diagram for an operational model that has been extended to allow for traffic that is urgent as well as traffic that is not urgent<br>
Figure 9 shows that as the amount of unchenshed traffic present increases the loss of cherished traffic never increases above 10-6<br>
Figure 10 shows that once the total amount of traffic increases above one the amount of unchenshed traffic lost increases linearly<br>
Figure 11 shows the delay for the urgent traffic where the upper dashed line is the deiay for the cherished traffic and the lower line is the delay for the unchenshed traffic Figure 12 shows the delay for the traffic that Is not urgent<br>
Figures 13 and 14 show the equivalent graphs for the standard deviation of the urgent and not urgent traffic<br>
In addition to or instead of providing for requested minimum delay, maximum loss rate or minimum throughput the operational model could provide for maximum permitted<br><br>
28<br>
variations of those parameters One especially preferred example is for the operational model to provide for maximum permitted variation in delay, corresponding to a required maximum level of jitter in packets' arrival times<br>
The apparatus to run the operational model could be located at a network node or at a unit elsewhere that is in communication with the node The node could be a router, a multiplexer (or combination of two or more multiplexers), a switch or any other unit at which quality of service can usefully be considered<br>
A preferred embodiment of the control and configuration mechanism takes the given requirements, groups them and maps them onto the physically available resources (i e the   finite   number   of  cherish   and   urgency   levels)    This   grouped   version   of  the requirements is then used to derive the feasibility of the servicing the collected set of flows   From that process the parameters for the physical configuration are derived<br>
After some initial checks, the preferred algorithm configures first the cherishing of the composite set of streams and then the urgency   It may conveniently be assumed that<br>
1	The scheduling mechanism is strict priority sharing of delay<br>
2	Cherish mechanism is operating over a single shared buffer<br>
3	There is an approximation of the residual service for the delay mechanism, namely<br><br>
o	Highest urgency has access to the total bandwidth of the link<br>
o	Next highest urgency has access to the total bandwidth of the link minus the<br>
actual throughput of the higher urgency levels<br>
o	This   process   is   repeated   for   each   decreasing   urgency   level   with   the<br>
bandwidth available for that urgency level being the total bandwidth minus the<br>
sum of all the required bandwidths of the more urgent levels<br>
4   All arrivals, services and residual services have a Poisson distribution<br><br>
Z9<br>
The initial checks and the preamble of the algorithm may be performed by means of the following steps<br>
1	Assure that the sum of all the throughput guarantees does not exceed the capacity<br>
of the link<br>
2	Calculate  the  maximum  arrival  rates  of all   the  streams,  even  if they  are  only<br>
restricted by the speed of the interface<br>
The cherishing of the data streams may then be configured as follows<br>
1	Rank   the   streams   in   increasing   order  of  allowable   loss   (decreasing   order  of<br>
cherishing)<br>
2	Choose a starting amount of buffering (this could just be the amount physically<br>
available)<br>
3	Group streams with similar target loss rates together, the number of groups being<br>
limited to the number of physically available cherish levels.<br>
4	Associate with each group the total target throughput for that collection of streams<br>
and the lowest loss rate of any stream in that collection<br>
5	Starting with the most cherished group calculate the required buffering to assure<br>
loss  requirements   This  is  done  under  the  assumption  that all  the  less  cherished<br>
streams are arriving  at their maximum  rates   If this can not be done,   reject the<br>
configuration<br>
6	Repeat this process (step 5)for the decreasing cherish levels, with the assumption<br>
that the higher cherished level traffic is at (or is slightly exceeding) its contracted rate<br>
This represents the cherish configuration for the QoS multiplexor for this collection of<br>
streams<br>
If the configuration   requires  more  buffering  that  is physically available,  reject the configuration<br>
The delay configuration may be performed as follows<br>
1	Rank the streams by decreasing urgency, i e increasing delay tolerance<br>
2	Group the streams together to fit into the finite number of urgency levels<br><br>
30<br>
3	Associate with each group the total throughput of the streams in that group and the<br>
delay requirements of the most urgent stream<br>
4	Starting with the most urgent group, calculate the nominal bandwidth required to be<br>
available in order to satisfy the delay requirements given the total amount of bandwidth<br>
available - the nominal bandwidth may be calculated under the assumptions that this<br>
system is an M/M/1/ Non-pre-emptive  Priority (HOL) Queuing System,   as described in<br>
Table 18 on page 370 of Allen   Probability, Statistics and Queuing Theory(1978)  This<br>
nominal bandwidth is compared with the actual available bandwidth If it is not available<br>
then this configuration is rejected.<br>
5	For decreasing urgency levels repeat (4) calculating the minimum excess bandwidth<br>
in on the same M/M/1/ Non-premptive Priority (HOL) Queuing System assumptions and<br>
ensuring that there is sufficient residual service given that the higher urgency streams<br>
are consuming their allocated bandwidth   If there is insufficient residual bandwidth to<br>
satisfy the constraints then reject this configuration<br>
If step (5) can be completed for all urgency levels then the configuration is feasible Once the above process has been completed there is sufficient information to set the parameters in the hardware to deliver the required set of contracts to the streams.<br>
An operational model of the types described above could be used for a number of purposes, for example<br>
-	deciding whether to accept or reject a call on the basis of whether the quality of<br>
service required for the call can be met:<br>
-	deciding whether to lose or delay a packet at a node or allot buffer space at a node<br>
in order to meet required qualities of service collectively for calls routed through that<br>
node,<br>
-	in response to a request for placement of a calf providing an  indication of an<br>
available quality of service, by means of which a user or unit may decide whether or not<br>
to place the call<br>
In a situation where a quality of service budget is to be shared between two or more nodes in a route there are several ways in which the sharing could be performed<br><br>
31<br>
1	An indication of the available budget could be passed to a node    It could estimate<br>
the reduction in quality of service that it expects to impose on the call, reduce the<br>
budget by the estimated amount, and then pass that reduced budget on to the next<br>
node which performs the same process<br>
2	An indication of the available budget and the amount of budget used so far by<br>
preceding nodes could be passed to a node   It could estimate the reduction in quality of<br>
service that it expects to impose on the call add the estimated amount to the amount of<br>
budget used so far, and then pass the available budget and the revised amount of<br>
budget used so far on to the next node which performs the same process<br>
3	An indication of the available budget could be passed to a node which also has<br>
knowledge of a maximum number (m) of nodes to be used for a call    It could then allow<br>
itself only 1/m of the available budget    Having estimated the reduction in quality of<br>
service that it expects to impose on the call the node could reject the call if it cannot use<br>
less than 1/m of the available budget.   Otherwise it could pass the available budget<br>
unchanged on to the next node<br>
The quality of service information may be sent out of band - that is by another path than the data stream to which the QoS information relates The QoS information may be derived from the source or the destination of the data stream, of elsewhere<br>
Standard optimisation techniques can be used to optimise the use of a selected operational model in given circumstances<br>

if the stream request is accepted, and for returning a fail signal if the stream request has been rejected<br>
12	A method as claimed in claim 11, comprising detecting a stream fail signal from<br>
another node in the network and for releasing the buffers which it had allocated for that<br>
stream<br>
13	A method as claimed in claim 11, wherein the step of allocating memory buffer<br>
resources allots buffers according to the model :<br><br>
36<br><br>
where kmax is the total amount of buffeting available  KB is the amount to which traffic is admitted. P is a desired probability of loss and pp is a load of traffic to be given preferential treatment in the case of resource contention<br>
14 A method as claimed in claim 11 wherein the said loss is a measure of acceptable loss for the respectivc stream and the said delay is a measure of acceptable delay for the respective stream<br>
15. A method as claimed in claim 11. wherein the step of allocating memory buffet resources is arranged to allot the buffers by blanking the streams in order of loss, selecting a starting amount of buffeting, grouping together streams with similar loss, determining for each group the total target throughput for that group of streams and the lowest loss late of any stream in that group, and calculating for each group the required buffering to assure loss requirements, and if the total required buffeting exceeds the available buffering rejecting the configuration of grouped streams<br>
16 A method as claimed in claim 1 1. wherein the step of buffering is arranged to allot the buffers by ranking the sticams by increasing delay tolcrance  grouping together sticams with similar delay tolerance, determining for each group the total throughput for that group of streams and the delay tolerancc of the most urgent stream in that group, and calculating for each gioup the nominal bandwidth required to be available in order to satisfy the delay requirements and if the total requited bandwidth exceeds the available bandwidth rejecting the configuration of grouped streams.<br><br>
37<br>
17. A method as claimed in claim 15, wherem the number of groups is limited to a predetermined number.<br>
18 A method for routing streams at a node in a packet transmission network. wherein each stream is transmitted with specified parameters for its acceptable delay and probability of loss during transmission in the network, said method comprising<br>
(I)    REciving a stream request compnsing parameter for quality of service.<br>
(ii) modelling the quality of service for the stream if it were routed through this node.<br>
(iii) generating adjusted parameters for quality of service by adjusting the received parameters for quality of service to take account of reduction in quality of service if the stream were routed through this node,<br>
(IV) if the adjusted parameters are indicative of unacceptable quality of service, rejecting the stream, and<br>
(v) If the adjusted parameters are indicative of acceptable quality of service, transmitting the adjusted parameters to another node in the network.<br>
19. A method as claimed in claim 18. wherein said parameters for quality of service preferably comprise at least two of: minimum delay, maximum loss rate and minimum throughput, and / or levels of variation of delay, loss rate or throughput.<br>
A routing device for routing streams at a node in a packet transmission network, wherein each stream is transmitted with specified parameters for its loss and delay in the network, the routing device comprising: stream admission control circuitry for receiving a stream request and for reading: (i) said specified parameters and any values for loss and delay already incurred at preceding nodes in the network, or (ii) said specified parameters as modified to take account of loss and delay already incurred at preceding nodes in the network, to determine in conjunction with existing streams already being handled by the routing device whether to accept or reject the stream; buffer circuitry including a plurality of buffers, wherein one or more of said buffers are alloted to said stream if the stream request has been accepted; and means for transmitting: (i) the stream request with<br>
modified values for loss and delay, or (ii) the stream request with modified<br>
parameters to take account of loss and delay incurred at this and preceding nodes<br>
in the network, if the stream request has been accepted, and for returning a fail signal if the stream request has been rejected.<br></td>
