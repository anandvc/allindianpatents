An apparatus tot  conveying wound laps and empty tubes<br>
The invention relates to a lap-forming machine with a discharge device for transferring the formed laps to a conveying device and with a feed device for feeding empty tubes to a lap-forming machine.<br>
In order to supply combing machines with wound laps (referred to hereinafter as laps), conveying devices are provided which transfer individual or entire groups of laps from a lap-forming machine to the individual combing machines.<br>
The transfer of an entire group of laps has proven to be particularly advantageous, which groups are transferred by way of a crane system, for example, which is equipped with respective gripper elements. In JP-OS-52-2 512 5 such a device is disclosed, with a total : of eight such laps being taken by means of a gripper device from a conveyor belt of a lap-forming machine and being transferred to the respective combing machine. The conveyor belt near the lap-forming machine is used for step-by-step follow-up and provision of finished laps. In addition, a further conveyor belt is provided next to the lap-forming machine in the conveying path of the craneway, which belt is used for receiving empty tubes and for transferring the same tq the lap-forming machine. The same gripper devices of the craneway are used to grasp the empty tubes issued at the combing machines and to place them onto the aforementioned conveyor belt for the return transport to the lap-forming machine.<br>
The attachment of such conveyor belts for wound laps ot tubes is relatively expensive and time-consuming,  as<br><br>
each of these conveyor belts or means must be provided with a separate drive and a separate control . The higher the number of such conveyor means, the more sensitive the entire system against soiling and wear and tear.<br>
The invention thus has the object of simplifying such conveying means in order to obtain an inexpensive and reliable conveyor system.<br>
This object is achieved in such a way that the di*ch*£g* d#vtc« tot   th« laps and   the feed device for<br>
the tubes are formed in a lap-forming machine by a common conveying means.<br>
It is proposed that the conveyor belt is formed by an endlessly revolving conveyor belt which is guided over deflection means and, , as seen in the vertical direction, the laps are carried off away from the lap-forming machine on the upper strand of the conveyor belt and the empty tubes are conveyed to the lap-forming machine on the lower strand of the conveyor belt. This allows simultaneously conveying of both the laps as well as the tubes with only one single conveying means.<br>
The term "conveyor belt" shall not be understood as !<br>
i<br>
limiting in respect of a closed belt, but instead the term "conveyor belt" shall also be understood as including terms such as link chains, belts made from individual driving belts, belts with interruptions and other arrangements. Generally, it shall be understood as being a revolving conveying means which is suitable to receive laps and tubes.<br><br><br>
Without such a run-off surface the laps can also be transferred to the lap-forming machine by way of an ejector device, with an ejector device, such as cylinder, being arranged transversally to the conveying direction of the conveyor belt.<br>
In order to position the tubes in the zone of the delivery  location  it  is  proposed  that  a  stop  is j provided in the zone of the delivery location of the ' tubes. The stop projects into the conveying path of the tubes on the lower strand.<br>
It  is  further  proposed  that  a  so-called  buffering function in form of an intermediate storage means is provided for  returned tubes,  which  storage means  is ; attached  adjacent  to  the  conveyor  belt.  The  term<br><br>
"adjacent" can be understood in this respect within the terms of a parallel arrangement of the intermediate storage means to the conveyor belt.<br>
The intermediate storage means can be formed by a plate which slopes downwardly towards the lower strand. In this embodiment the intermediate storage means serves less as a buffer, but instead more as a transfer means from the conveying system to the conveyor belt.<br>
It is further proposed to arrange the intermediate storage means movably, with at least one position of the intermediate storage means being displaceable approximately at the height of the upper strand. This allows providing the vertical lifting movement of the mf&amp;nrn *y*fcetn similarly 
Preferably, the intermediate storage means is held pivotally movable.<br>
It is further proposed that the guide elements for guiding the conveyor belt are made from guide plates and/or guide rolls.<br>
The lighter tubes can be supported on guide rolls which<br>
are  arranged  in  pairs  i.n  such  a  way  that  their<br>
i<br>
rotational axes facing the centre of the conveyor belt intersect at an obtuse angle and thus form a receiving<br><br>
trough for the tubes. The rotational axes of the paired * guide rolls could also be slightly offset as seen in the conveying direction, so that merely the slightly horizontal planes intersect in which said rotational axes extend.<br>
In order to form a delivery location for the tubes on the lower strand it is proposed that at least one row of the guide rolls arranged in pairs is attached in such a way that the obtuse angle of intersection of the rotational axes of the guide rolls is gradually increased, as seen in the conveying direction, up to a slightly stretched position thus forming a downwardly sloping run-off surface.<br>
In order %to achieve an interruption-free discharge of fcM laps *nd a delivery of the tubes it is proposed that in the zone of the conveyor belt and in the zone of the delivery location of the tubes to the J ap-forming machine sensors are provided for recognising laps and empty tubes and that the drive of the conveyor belt is controlled by a control unit on the basis of the signals of the sensors "in such a way that the first tube of a group of tubes supplied by the conveyor system is located in the zone of the delivery location while a group of laps supplied to the upper strand, with the number thereof corresponding to the number of the tubes of the group of tubes, is located in a delivery position to the conveyor system and the receiving location on the upper strand is empty for re-supplying the new lap.<br>
Preferably, these sensors are arranged in the zone of the delivery location on the upper strand for the finished and ejected laps, in the zone of the transfer<br><br>
location of the tubes and in the zone of the upper strand of the conveyor belt which recognises the first lap of the group of laps which following a further conveying step of the conveyor belt reaches the final delivery position to the subsequent conveying system. Additionally, a further sensor is provided which monitors the presence of the group of tubes on the lower strand in order to prevent any inadvertent follow-up of a new group of tubes.<br>
The movement of the conveyor belt preferably occurs in predetermined steps which are adjusted in particular to the gripper device of the subsequent conveying system and with respect to the required distance in the following placement on the combing machine.<br>
To ensure that the tubes meet with the intended stop prior to their delivery to the lap-forming machine and thus assume their precise position, it is proposed that the feed device for the transfer of a group of tubes to the lower strand of the conveyor belt is arranged in such a way that the path of the first tube of the group of tubes, until it reaches the delivery position to the lap-forming machine, is smaller than the required displacement path to move or displace the finished laps in the conveying direction to the delivery position to a subsequent conveying system.<br>
Further advantages are explained and described in closer detail by reference to the following embodiments, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic top view of a group of combing machines with a lap-forming machine and a conveying device;<br><br><br>
Fig. 5    shows a sectional view along the line IV - IV in fig. 1 at the delivery position for the tubes;<br>
Fig. 6    shows a sectional view along the line V - V . in fig. 1 at a location where the tubes are supplied to ; the lap~forming machine;<br>
Fig. 7    shows another embodiment, with the same view and same location as in fig. 5;<br>
Fig, 8 shows an enlarged side view pursuant to f ig. 3 with a movable intermediate storage means;<br>
Fig. 9    shows a schematic view pursuant to fig.  1 with sensors and a control device as well as the drive ' elements, and<br>
Figs. 10 to 12 show a schematic representation of the controlled conveying process of the laps and tubes on the conveyor belt.<br><br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows a top view of an installation in a combing room with a lap-forming machine 1 and combing machines 2, 2a, 2b, Usually, a lap-forming machine 1 will supply approx. six combing machines 2. A conveyor belt 5 (page 2) is arranged near the lap-forming machine (hereinafter referred to as the coiling machine), which belt is used for transferring and providing finished laps 4 to a shifting bridge 3. It is provided simultaneously that the empty tubes 6 which are returned from the combing machines 2, 2a, 2b are also transferred to the coiling machine 1 by way of the conveyor belt 5.<br>
The conveyor belt 5 is driven by a schematically shown<br>
motor M which is controlled by a control unit S. The control unit S is connected with the drive Ml of the shifting bridge 3 and with the control units of the individual combing machines 2, 2a, 2b. In addition, the control unit S receives different signals from several sensors. This is marked schematically with the arrow SE and will be explained below in closer detail by reference to a further representation (fig. 9).<br>
As both the coiling machine 1 as well as the combing machines 2, 2a, 2b and the shifting bridge 3 are known they are only shown schematically in the figures. E'ig. 2 shows an embodiment of a conveyor belt 5. The coiling machine designated with reference numeral 1 is shown on \ the left side in fig. 2. The combing machines are located on the right side, one of which is shown symbolically and is designated with reference numeral 2. These machines stand in one or several rows extending perpendicularly to the plane of the drawing (see fig. 1). Accordingly, the shifting bridge 3 is also movable perpendicularly to this plane in order to<br><br>
lift the finished lap 4 from the conveyor belt 5, namely from its upper section, i.e. the upper strand 5a. The laps are thus supplied step-by-step so that small distances (a-fig. 9) are present between them. As a result, the gripper arms 3a of the shifting bridge 3 which are attached to a crossbeam 3b can engage between the lap rolls 4 and lift them so as to supply them to the machines 2. The entire arrangement as described to this point is known from JP-OS-52-25125, for example.<br>
The new aspect is that the lower section of the conveyor belt 5 which runs back to the coiling machine 1, i.e. the lower strand 5b, is used for the return transport of the tubes 6 to this machine. This was not<br><br>
placement of the tubes 6 by means of the shifting bridge 3 on the lower strand 5b. That is why it was : necessary to date to provide a second conveyor belt extending laterally adjacent to the first one. This second conveyor belt was used for the return transport only. The two belts each required a drive and a control unit and were inadequately utilised. Moreover, this made the entire apparatus more expensive and increased the susceptibility to wear and tear and to soiling.<br>
In order to utilise the lower strand 5b of the one remaining conveyor belt 5 for the aforementioned conveyance, a receiving plate 7 extending parallel adjacent to the lower strand is arranged close to its end facing the machines 2. This plate, which is principally a plane, is inclined as shown in fig. 2 in such a way that the tubes 6 which are received by it and are conveyed by the shifting bridge 3 roll by themselves on to the lower strand 5b in order to be<br><br>
received by the same. The receiving plate 7 is thus attached in such a way that it is provided with an incline towards the strand 5b extending adjacent to it. As is indicated with the broken line, it could be concave, with the edge of the receiving plate 7 which is closer to the strand being situated lower than the edge which i© remote therefrom. In this case too this leads to an incline which allows the tubes 6 to roll onto the strand 5b. In addition, guide plates 51 are attached to the receiving plate 7 which are used for the lateral guidance of the tubes rolling onto the lower strand. These lateral guide means 51 are used to displace the re-supplied group of tubes by a small amount in the direction towards the delivery location near the lap-forming machine with respect to the horizontal position of the laps. This means that, as will be shown in the following fig. 10, as a result of this displacement the path X is longer than the path L. This ensures that the tube to be delivered is located precisely in the delivery position in the installation at a limit stop 29.<br>
To enable the empty tubes 6 to remain on the strand 5b, it is carried by two sets of belt rolls 8, 9. The two sets of rolls are inclined towards one another in such a way that the mutually facing face sides of their rolls are situated at a lower position than the other face sides. In this way the strand passing over it is provided with a tub-like or trough-like V-shape which centres the tubes 6 which rest thereon. It is also possible to additionally attach a third roll (not shown) in the centre zone for support.<br>
Once the tubes 6 finally approach the coiling machine 1 or the delivery location A it is necessary to bring<br><br>
them away from the conveyor belt again. For this purpose the set of rolls 8 ends at a certain distance before the end of the strand 5b and is replaced by a run-off plate 10 (fig. 5) which is inclined obliquely to the running direction of strand 5b and is -in addition situated at a slightly lower position than the upper side of the rolls of the set of rolls 9 which are still present there and are opposite of the run-off plate 10. The strand 5b which now partly slides on this run-off plate 10 is thus provided with an inclined position so that the tubes 6 are no longer centred, but roll to the left over the plate 10 until they fall onto the rolls of a set of conveying rolls 11 and are centred there again. These rolls are arranged in the running direction of the strand 5b over the major part 11a of the set of conveying rolls 11 in such a way that this part is provided with an incline sloping towards th© end of the apparatus (fig* 1 left and fig. 4). Only an end section lib being adjacent to the inclined part 11a is horizontal. As a result of this incline each tube 6 which is held on the set of rolls will start to move by its own weight and will roll towards the end section lib on which it is stopped owing to the stop 12. The following tubes will then come to rest successively on said first tube.<br>
Pursuant to fig. 6 a cylinder piston unit 13, which is j<br>
i<br>
attached transversally to the end section lib,  will ! push tube 6 out of the same towards an inlet 14 which is situated opposite of unit 13 and will conduct the tube into the coiling machine 1 for renewed coiling.<br>
With respect to the aforementioned inclined position of strand 5b as a result: of the run-off plate 10 it is to ' be added that an abrupt transition between the V-shape<br><br>
of the strand 5b and its subsequent inclined position must be prevented because otherwise tensions can occur in the strand. The run-off plate 10 could therefore still have a V-shape immediately after the last roll 8a and change only gradually into the shown inclined plane. However, as such a shape is difficult to produce, it is recommended pursuant to fig. 4 to arrange the rolls of the set of rolls 8 which are the last ones as seen in the running direction of the strand 5b twisted by a small angle from the original plane of the set of rolls. Fig. 3 shows these last rolls 8a by partly omitting the strand resting on them. This continuous bending leads to a continuous transition. Moreover, the run-off plate 10' can be kept short. The angle a between the axes 23 and 2 4 changes until a stretched angle P is reached.<br>
Fig. 7 shows another embodiment of the apparatus. In this case the tubes which are placed onto the strand 5b by means of the receiving plate 7 remain on the latter until virtually its end. The run-off plate 10 and the set of conveying rolls 11 are omitted. The set of belt rolls 8 is now of the same length as the set of rolls 9 and retains its inclination as shown in fig. 2 until the end. A stop 17 is located immediately above the end<br>
of strand 5b, which stop holds up the conveyed tubes. A ,<br>
i<br>
device 18 is attached near or adjacent to it. It could i principally be a button which can be pressed into stop 17 by a tube. In this case it is shown as a light barrier which is actuated at the moment when the tube reaches the stop 17. It is ope rati vely connected with the cylinder-piston unit 13a which is arranged immediately adjacent to the strand 5b and is horizontal in this case. The unit 13a is activated by the signal from the device 18. It pushes its piston transversally<br><br>
over the strand and pushes the tube from the same in such a way (see double arrow and position as shown in the broken line) .<br>
The tube lands here on an intermediate storage means 19 in form of a plate or a rail and rolls into the basin-shaped rocker 20. It is swi veil able about an axis 21, namely by means of a further cylinder-piston unit 22. As a result of the movement in the direction of the curved arrow, the tube is freed in the basin of rocker 20 and can roll towards the inlet 14, whereas the next following tube is held back. Only after the return pivot of the rocker 20 can it roll into it. In this way the tubes are supplied one by one to the coiling machine 1.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a further embodiment, with the intermediate storage means 30 as shown in fig. 1 being described in closer detail. The intermediate storage means 30 is provided upstream with a feed plate 7 (fig. 2) .<br>
The intermediate storage means 30 consists of a receiving trough 31 which is used for receiving the tubes 6 which are conveyed back by conveying system. The receiving trough 31 is arranged in such a way that ■ the placed tubes 6 are securely stored in the upper shown position. As is shown schematically in f ig. 1 f the receiving trough 31 extends alongside the conveyor belt 5, so that the entire group of the tubes 6 which are conveyed back by the conveying system can be loaded.<br>
As soon as it is ensured by the control system S that an empty tube is no longer present on the lower strand<br><br>
5b, the receiving trough 31 can be downwardly swivelled towards the feed plate 7 by way of the swivelling arms 32 about the swivelling axis 36 as a result of the actuation of a cylinder 34. As a result of the shape of the receiving trough 31, the tubes 6 can roll out of the receiving trough 31 as a result of their gravity and reach the feed plate 7 which is positioned in an inclined way- As a result of the inclined position of plate 7, the tubes 6 roll into the receiving trough of the lower strand 5b, laterally guided by means of the guide means 51. The sensor 33 is now used to recognised again that a group of empty tubes 6 is located in the trough of the lower strand 5b. Thes£ tubes 6 are supplied to the coiling machine 1 step-by-step. The control sequence of this step-by-step displacement shall be explained below in closer detail. The entire apparatus comprising the conveyor belt 5 and the swivel1able intermediate storage means 30 is held in a frame 28.<br>
hs a result of the swiveliable intermediate storage means 30 as shown in fig. 8 it is achieved that the shifting bridge 3 for receiving the laps 4 and for delivering the tubes 6 must be downwardly lowered to the same height H. This gains additional time for the movement of the shifting bridge, as the further ; displacement of the tubes 6 into their lower roll-off position can be performed temporally independent of the position of the shifting bridge.<br>
The controlled sequence of the conveying device in the coiling machine 1 is now explained in closer detail in the following figs. 9 to 12.<br><br>
As is shown in fig. 9, the conveyor belt 5 is guided by way of deflection rollers 15, 16, 2 5 and 26. The deflection roller 16 is driven by a motor M which receives its control pulses from a control unit S via the path 40. This control unit S is connected via path 41 with the control units of the combing machines 2, 2a, 2b and the path 42 with the drive motor Ml for the movement of the shifting bridge 3. In addition, the control unit S receives signals from the sensor 33 via the path 43 which reports the presence of an empty tube 6 on the lower strand 5b. As seen with reference to the conveying direction T, the last tube of the placed group of tubes is scanned. Moreover, a sensor 38 is provided which iasueB its signals to a control unit S by way of the path 48. The sensor 38 scans the second<br>
coiling position in the conveying direction Tl and with respect to the delivery position to the shifting bridge. This means that as soon as a lap 4 is recognised by a sensor 38 a further displacement step is necessary so that the laps 4 are ready in sufficient numbers and position for receiving by the shifting bridge 3.<br>
In the area of the delivery position A a sensor 39 is provided which transmits its signals to the control unit S by way of the path 49. As is schematically shown I in particular in fig. 5, the sensor 39 is used for ! recognising a tube 6 which has been ejected from the strand 5b and is to be used for follow-up to the coiling position of the coiling machine 1.<br>
A sensor 37 is attached in the zone of the transfer position B where the lap 4 which is formed and delivered by the coiling machine 1 is placed on the upper strand 5a.  The sensor 37  issues  its  signals<br><br>
through path 4 7 to the control unit S. The signal of the sensor 37 is also issued to the control unit (not shown) of the coiling machine in order to ensure that a new lap is delivered by the coiling machine 1 to the upper strand 5a when the delivery position 3 is free. This means that the sensor 37 scans at the transfer position B for the presence of a lap 4 which has been newly placed on the upper strand 5a. The control will now be explained in below by reference to the position in fig. 9.<br>
In fig. 9 seven laps 4 have already been completed and lie on the strand 5a at a predetermined axial distance a. This means that the entire group of laps must again be conveyed forward by a conveying step X after the eighth lap has been delivered to the strand 5a, so that the subsequent shifting bridge is provided with a complete number of eight laps positioned for receiving.<br>
A group of empty tubes 6? are shown in broken lines below the laps 4 . The tubes are still located in the intermediate storage means 30. The intermediate storage means 30 is still arrested in the upper position, which is shown in particular in fig. 8. The tubes 6' were shown below the laps 4 in fig. 9 only for reasons of clarity. The last one of the empty tubes which is still ■ situated on the lower strand 5b rests with a face side on the limit stop 2 9 in the zone of the delivery position A. As soon as the eighth lap has been delivered by the'coiling machine 1 to the strand 5a, which is reported by the sensor 37 of the control unit S, an ejector device is actuated (see fig, 7, cylinder ■. 13a, for example) in order to convey the last tube 6 which is still located on the lower strand 5b to the coiling machine 1 for further transfer to the coiling<br><br>
position. Finally, the driving of cylinder 34 is performed through the control unit Sf by means of which, when actuated, the swivelling arm 32 and thus the receiving trough 31 with the tubes 6' in the ready position are swivelled downwardly. Once the lower position is reached the tubes 6* roll via the receiving plate 7 into the trough-like recess of the lower strand 5b. Thereafter the trough 31 is swivelled back to its<br>
upper position again through the cylinder 3 4 where it is in readiness for receiving returned empty tubes. The sensor 33 then reports the presence of the re-supplied empty tubes on the strand 5b to the control unit S . The system is now in the position as   shown in fig. 10. The control unit S now actuates the motor M which now puts1 the  conveyor belt  5  into motion  in  the  clockwise direction via the deflection roller 16, namely until the  laps  4  have  been moved  to  the  right  in  the conveying direction Tl over the path X. This rotational movement is monitored by a sensor  (not shown)  which scans  the  rotational  angle  of  the  axis  of  the deflection roller 16, as a result of which the drive motor   M   is   stopped   again   upon   reaching   the . predetermined  displacement.  The  monitoring  of  the displacement of the laps by the path X can also occur by the respective attachment of light barriers instead of the scanning of the rotational angle of the shaft. In this case the edges of- the laps are scanned. The laps are now located in the position as shown in fig. 11 where they have reached their final position at which  the  transfer  can  be made by  the  subsequent conveying system. Simultaneously with the displacement of the laps 4 in the conveying direction Tl the tubes 6 on the lower strand 5b were displaced to the left by the step X, so that the first tube 6e of the new group of tubes reaches the area of the delivery position A<br><br>
and comes into contact with stop 29 with its face side. Sensor 37 now indicates that the transfer position B is again f%ee for the transfer of a new lap on to the upper strand 5a.<br>
As soon as   the combing machines report a need for laps to be re-supplied to the control system S, the eight laps that are in readiness can be received from the shifting bridge 3. Should there not be any need for laps yet, the eight prepared laps can remain in the position as shown in f ig. 11 . Independent of this, a new lap can be formed on the coiling machine 1. As is shown in fig. 12, this newly formed lap is thereafter supplied to the upper strand 5a of the coiling machine 1 and the first one of the empty tubes which sits close to the stop 29 is delivered to the coiling machine 1. This means that the coiling machine 1 can already form a tenth lap while nine laps stand by in readiness on the upper strand 5a. As the sensor 38 still indicates the presence of a lap on the upper strand 5a,  the control unit knows that a removal of the laps 4 in standby has not yet occurred by the shifting bridge 3. This means that a further displacement of the laps in the conveying direction Tl is prevented. The tenth lap, which has been completed in the mean time, cannot be ejected by the coiling machine 1 as the sensor 37 still indicates the presence of a lap in the zone of the transfer position B. The result of this is that the coiling machine 1 is switched off.<br>
As soon as the eight laps that are in standby are taken up by the shifting bridge 3, sensor 38 again shows an empty position on the strand 5a. As a result, the drive of motor M is put into motion again through the control unit S, by means of which the lap 4 still remaining on<br><br><br>
are further conveyed to the left by this step, as a result of which one of the tubes comes to lie on the stop 29 in the delivery zone A. The transfer location B again becomes free for receiving a new lap, which is indicated by sensor 37. The lap formed in the mean time can now be ejected, which enables the production of further laps. The formation and provision of new laps can be performed again as explained above until the situation occurs again as is shown in fig. 12. During the formation of new laps, a new group of empty tubes 6' can be transferred in the meantime to the intermediate storage means 30 by means of the shifting bridge 30.<br>
During the first start of the installation the tubes are manually placed on the lower strand 5b according to fig. 11. Similarly, the intermediate storage means 30 is then manually filled with empty tubes 6'.<br>
The shown arrangement in conjunction with the described control  leads  to  a  simple  and  operatively  secure conveying system for the conveyance of laps and tubes in a coiling machine, whereby the discharge of the laps ! 4 and the feed of tubes 6 can be performed without any ' loss of time in the coiling machine 1.<br><br><br><br>
