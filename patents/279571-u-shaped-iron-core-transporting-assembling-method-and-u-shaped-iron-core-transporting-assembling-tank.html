U-SHAPED IRON CORE TRANSPORTING / ASSEMBLING METHOD, AND U-SHAPED IRON CORE TRANSPORTING / ASSEMBLING TANK<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The   present   invention   relates   to   a   U-shaped<br>
iron core transporting/ assembling method in a transformer transported in a disassembled condition and a U-shaped iron core transporting/ assembling tank used in the method.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]	In   recent   years,   voltage   to   be   supplied   to   a<br>
transmission system increases with an increase in electric power demand. Accordingly, the capacity, size, and weight of stationary induction electric appliances, such as transformers, used for power transmission/ transformation increase.<br>
[0003]	Transformer stations in which a transformer is<br>
installed are often located in sites with severe transport conditions, such as mountain area or underground of urban areas. Therefore, it is necessary to significantly reduce the transportation dimension and weight of the stationary  induction  electric  appliance  installed  in  such sites.<br>
[0004]	In   such   a   case,   a   disassembled  transportation<br>
method capable of significantly reducing the<br>
transportation scale and weight of a product to be<br>
transported has been adopted as a transportation method<br>
of the transformer. In this method, a large capacity<br>
three-phase transformer, etc. that has already been<br>
produced and tested in a factory is disassembled into<br>
several components: a U-shaped iron core, yokes, coils,<br>
and the like, then the components are housed in<br>
transportation tanks specially designed for the respective<br>
components to their installation site, and the respective<br>
components are reassembled in, e.g., a clean house built<br>
at the installation site. A transformer transported<br>
using the above disassembled transportation method is<br>
referred to as "disassembled transportation transformer".<br>
[0005]	Recently,   as   disclosed   in   Patent   Document   1,<br>
the U-shaped iron core is disassembled further into smaller parts (e.g., leg iron core and lower-yoke iron core) in order to reduce the size of each component to be transported.<br>
[0006]	The     clean     house     used     for     assembling    the<br>
disassembled transportation transformer at its installation site generally has two rooms: an assembling room and a spare room and has a structure in which framed   support   column   are   surrounded  by   a   panel   unit<br>
 constituted by a plurality of plate materials. Each room has a roof at the top. The roof is constituted by a framing material and a water-proof sheet and extensively attached to the framing so as to be opened and closed. A dehumidifier, a dust collector, and the like are provided in both the assembling room and spare room for controlling the humidity or dust amount in the rooms. In general, it takes about 20 days to build up the clean house.<br>
[0007]	The   U-shaped   iron   core   that   has  been   divided<br>
into the leg iron core, lower-yoke iron core, and the like and transported to the installation site is carried in the spare room where dehvimidification and dust removal have been accomplished and unpacked from a transportation tank, etc., and then carried into the assembling room where dehumidification and dust removal have been accomplished, by a tow truck,  etc.<br>
Patent Document l: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2007-67112.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVEBTION<br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0008]	However,     the     on-site     iron     core     assembling<br>
method   of   the   disassembled   transportation   transformer<br>
has the following problems.<br>
 <br>
[0009]	For   example,   an   iron   core   of  a   large   capacity<br>
three-phase five-leg transformer is constituted by four U-shaped iron cores. Thus, it is necessary to assemble the four U-shaped iron cores at the installation site after the assembling room of the clean house has been built up. In general, it takes about 7 days to complete the assembly of one U-shaped iron core. In the space of a conventional assembling room where the U-shaped iron core is assembled, it is possible to assemble at most two U-shaped iron cores simultaneously, in general. In this case, it takes about 14 to 17 days to complete the assembly of all the U-shaped iron cores. Thus, it takes more time to install the entire transformer than in the case of a general disassembled transportation transformer where the iron core is transported in the form of the U-shaped iron core by the time length required for assembling the U-shaped iron core at the installation site.<br>
[0010]	Further,  the  above work  schedule is applicable<br>
to only a case where the weather is stable. For example, it is necessary to open the roof of the assembling room when the iron core is carried into the assembling room, so that the carry-in work cannot be performed in the case of rain, delaying the installation.<br>
[OOll]	Further,  carryin of the  leg iron core  and yoke<br>
iron core  and carryout of an  erection tank in which the<br>
 <br>
U-shaped iron core is housed, and erected need to be<br>
performed using a tow truck. Hoisting up/down of the<br>
iron core by a tow truck needs to be performed at both<br>
the assembling room and spare room. The tow truck is<br>
parked in the intermediate portion between the<br>
assembling room and spare room and, there, the hoisting<br>
up/down of the leg iron core and yoke iron core is<br>
performed in a state where the arm of the tow truck is<br>
extended in an inclined manner. Thus, a tow truck with<br>
large hoisting capacity is required. The rental fee, etc.,<br>
of such a tow truck with large hoisting capacity is high,<br>
and there is no other way but to rent a tow truck whose<br>
per-unit time rental fee is high in order to assemble the<br>
U-shaped iron core, causing increase in cost.<br>
[0012]	Further,   the   carry-in  of the  leg  iron   core   and<br>
yoke iron core often needs to be performed many times, and every time the carry-in work is performed, the roofs of the spare rooni and assembling room need to be opened. When the roofs are opened, a large volume of external air is introduced inside the spare room and assembling room, so that it is necessary to perform dehumidification and dust removal every time the roofs are opened, which may cause delay of the installation.<br>
[0013]	The   present   invention  has  been   made   to   solve The   above   problems,   and   an   object  thereof  is   to   reduce the      installation     period      and       cost     by performing on-site assembly of the U-shaped iron core of a transformer, etc. in a U-shaped iron core transporting/ assembling tank in the case where the U-shaped iron core is transported in a disassembled condition.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM<br>

there is presented a U-shaped iron core transporting/ assembling method according to the present invention which is a U-shaped iron core transporting/ assembling method in which a U-shaped iron core of a transformer is disassembled into a first leg iron core, a second leg iron core, and a lower-yoke iron core for transportation and reassembled after the transportation, said method comprising' an in-factory iron core assembling step of assembling the U-shaped iron core in a manufacturing factory of the U"shaped iron core; a U-shaped iron core housing step of housing, after the in-factory iron core assembling step, the U-shaped iron core in a tank that can be divided into a first leg iron core tank and a second leg iron core tank each having an opening/closing opening portion; a lower-yoke iron core separating step of separating, after the U-shaped iron core housing step, the lower-yoke iron core from the first leg iron core and second leg iron core in a state where the positions of the first  leg  iron  core   arid  second  leg  iron  core   are  fixed  in the tank; a lower-yoke iron core transporting tank transferring step of transferring, after the lower-yoke iron core separating step, the lower-yoke iron core to a lower-yoke iron core transporting tankI a tank dividing step of dividing, after the lower-yoke iron core transporting tank transferring step, the tank into the first leg iron core tank and second leg iron core tank for individually housing the first leg iron core and second leg iron core! a transporting step of individually transporting in a sideways attitude, after the tank dividing step, the first leg iron core, second leg iron core, and lower-yoke iron core housed respectively in the first leg iron core tank, second leg iron core tank, and lower-yoke iron core transporting tank in a state where the opening portions of the first leg iron core tank and second leg iron core tank are closed; a lower-yoke iron core assembling tank transferring step of transferring, after the transporting step, the lower-yoke iron core to a lower-yoke iron core assembling tank having an opening portion; a tank connecting step of connecting, after the lower-yoke iron core assembling tank transferring step, the opening portions of the first leg iron core tank, second leg iron core tank, and lower-yoke iron core assembling tank with the opening portions of the first leg iron core tank and second leg iron core tank opened while maintaining the first leg iron core,  second leg iron core, <br>

BEST MODE FOR CARYYING OUT INVENTION<br>
[0020]       Embodiments   of  the   present   invention   will   be<br>
described    below    with    reference    to    the    accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
[0021]	[First Embodiment]<br>
A first embodiment of a U-shaped iron core transporting/ assembling method according to the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 7. FIG. 1 is a schematic plan view showing a state where a U-shaped iron core 51 is housed in a U-shaped iron core transporting/   assembling   tank   50   used   in   the   present<br>
 <br>
embodiment. FIG. 2 is a schematic front view showing<br>
the U-shaped iron core transporting/ assembling tank 50<br>
of FIG. 1. FIGS. 3 to 5 show a second leg iron core tank<br>
2b in a state of being transported, wherein FIG. 3 is a<br>
schematic plan view, FIG. 4 is a schematic front view of<br>
FIG. 3, and FIG. 5 is a schematic side view of FIG. 3.<br>
[0022]	FIG. 6 is a schematic plan view showing a state<br>
where the U-shaped iron core 51 is housed in an erection tank 10 and a third opening portion 20a is closed. FIG. 7 is a schematic view showing a state where the erection tank 10 of FIG. 6 is erected.<br>
[0023]        As  shown in  FIGS.   1  and 2,  the  U-shaped iron<br>
core 51 is constituted by a first leg iron core la, a second<br>
leg iron core lb, a lower-yoke iron core 6, and the like.<br>
[0024]	The    U-shaped    iron    core    51    that    has    been<br>
assembled in a factory is housed in a tank obtained by connecting a first leg iron core tank 2a and a second leg iron core tank 2b in a sideways attitude. [0025] The first leg iron core tank 2a has an opening/closing first longitudinal opening portion 3a formed in one side surface in the longitudinal direction and a first short opening portion 4a formed in the end surface perpendicular to the one side surface. Another opening portion may be optionally formed in the end surface opposed to the first short opening portion 4a. Like  the  first  leg iron  core  tank  2a,  the  second leg iron<br>
 <br>
core tank 2b has an opening/closing second longitudinal opening portion 3b formed in one side surface in the longitudinal direction and a second short opening portion 4b formed in the end surface perpendicular to the one side surface. Another opening portion may be formed in the end surface opposed to the second short opening portion 4b.<br>
[0026]	In a state where all the opening portions of the<br>
first leg iron core tank 2a and the second leg iron core tank 2b are opened, the longitudinal cross-section of the tank has a U-shape with an opening and two right angled corners. A flange portion, etc., is formed around these opening portions so as to allow connection between the respective tanks. Further, a seal material may be optionally used for sealing the opening portions at the time when the tanks are connected.<br>
[0027]	In  a  state  where   the  U-shaped  iron   core   51   is<br>
housed, at least the first longitudinal opening portion 3a<br>
and the second longitudinal opening portion 3b are<br>
connected to each other in a face to face manner in a<br>
state where they are opened. At this time, the first leg<br>
iron core la and the second leg iron core lb are fixed in<br>
the tank in which the first leg iron core tank 2a and the<br>
second leg iron core tank 2b are connected.<br>
[0028]	Subsequently,   the   lower-yoke    iron   core   6   is<br>
separated  from  the  first leg iron core   la  and  the  second leg iron core lb. The fixing state of the first leg iron core la and the second leg iron core lb in the tank is maintained at this time. The separated lower-yoke iron core 6 is transferred to a lower-yoke iron core transporting tank (not shown).<br>
[0029] Then, while the fixing state of the first leg iron core la and the second leg iron core lb in the tank is maintained, the connection between the first leg iron core tank 2a and the second leg iron core tank 2b is released for separation. A detachable transportation lid 160 for leg iron core tank such as an iron plate is fitted to the first longitudinal opening portion 3a and the first short opening portion 4a. Further, a first end plate 5a is positioned in the end surface opposed to the first short opening portion 4a. When the iron core, etc. is housed in the tank, the opening portions are closed by the lids and the end plates.<br>
[0030]	The   detachable   transportation  lids   160  for  leg<br>
iron core tank such as an iron plates are fitted to the second longitudinal opening portion 3b and the second short opening portion 4b. Further, a second end plate 5b is positioned in the end surface opposed to the second short opening portion 4b. When the iron core, etc. is housed in the tank, the opening portions are closed by the lids and end plate. The opening portions closed at this   time   are   maintained  in   a   hermetically-sealed   state<br>
by a seal material.<br>
[0031]	The  first  leg iron  core   la,  the   second  leg iron<br>
core lb, and the lower-yoke iron core 6 are transported to<br>
the installation sit^ of a transformer, etc. by the first leg<br>
iron core tank 2a, the second leg iron core tank 2b, and<br>
the lower-yoke iron core transporting tank, respectively.<br>
At this time, the first leg iron core la and the second leg<br>
iron core lb are housed in the first leg iron core tank 2a<br>
and the second leg iron core tank 2b respectively in a<br>
sideways attitude such that the longitudinal direction<br>
thereof is oriented in the horizontal direction and<br>
respective stacked steel plates extend in the horizontal<br>
direction and are transported in this state. At the<br>
transportation time, the lids and end plates are fitted to<br>
the opening portions of the first leg iron core tank 2a,<br>
the second leg iron core tank 2b, and the lower-yoke iron<br>
core transporting tank, and therefore, each tank is<br>
maintained in a hermetically-sealed state.<br>
[0032]	Next,   an   assembling   method   of   the   U-shaped<br>
iron core at the installation site will be described. [0033] The first leg iron core tank 2a housing the first leg iron core la and the second leg iron core tank 2b housing the second leg iron core lb are transported to the installation site of a transformer, etc. and then disposed such that the longitudinal directions of the tanks are made parallel to each other.     At this time, the<br>
 <br>
first short opening portion 4a and the second short<br>
opening portion 4b are arranged in the same plane, and<br>
the first longitudinal opening portion 3a and the second<br>
longitudinal opening portion 3b, which are set in an open<br>
state, are arranged opposite to each other. In this state,<br>
the first longitudinal opening portion 3a and the second<br>
longitudinal opening portion 3b are connected and the<br>
first leg iron tank 2a and the second leg iron core tank<br>
2b are integrated to each other. A tank obtained by<br>
integrating the first leg iron core tank 2a and the second<br>
leg iron core tank 2b is referred to as an erection tank 10.<br>
[0034]	In the erection tank 10, the first short opening<br>
portion 4a and the second short opening portion 4b are arranged in a single plane. These opening portions 4a and 4b constitute one opening in an open state. This opening is referred to as an erection tank opening portion 10b. After the formation of the erection tank 10, the flanges formed around the first short opening portion 4a and the second short opening portion 4b constitute one flange. The thus obtained flange is referred to as an erection tank flange 10a. Further, the erection tank 10 has an erection tank hoisting lug lOd to which a wire, etc. can be secured.<br>
[0035]	The lower-yoke iron core 6 is transported to the<br>
installation site by the lower-yoke iron core transporting<br>
tank.	A lower-yoke iron core assembling tank 20 has<br>
 <br>
an opening/closing third opening portion 20a through which carry-in and carry-out of the lower-yoke iron core 6 can be performed. The third opening portion 20a is formed in one longitudinal side thereof and which has a flange portion formed therearound. The flange formed around the third opening portion 20a is referred to as a third opening portion flange 20b. At the installation site, the lower-yoke iron core 6 is carried out from the lower-yoke iron core transporting tank by, e.g., a crane or tow truck and carried in the lower-yoke iron core transporting tank through the third opening portion 20a. At this time, the lower-yoke iron core 6 is carried into the lower-yoke iron core assembling tank 20 in such a manner that the longitudinal direction thereof is horizontal.<br>
[0036] The lower-yoke iron core assembling tank 20 in which the lower-yoke iron core 6 has been housed is disposed such that the erection tank opening portion 10b and third opening portion 20a are opposed to each other. In this state, the angle defined by a side surface in which the first longitudinal opening portion 3a and the second longitudinal opening portion 3b are formed and a surface having the third opening portion 20a is set to 90D. In FIGS. 1 and 2, the lower-yoke iron core 6 is shown in the erection tank 10 and lower-yoke iron core assembling tank 20, respectively.<br>
 <br>
[0037]	In    a    state   where    the    erection   tank   opening<br>
portion 10b and third opening portion 20a are opened, the erection tank flange 10a and third opening portion flange 20b are connected so as to integrate the erection tank 10 and lower-yoke iron core assembling tank 20. The thus obtained tank is referred to as a U-shaped iron core transporting/ assembling tank 50.<br>
[0038]	Immediately    after    the    formation    of   the    U-<br>
shaped iron core transporting/ assembling tank 50, the first leg iron core la and the second leg iron core lb are disposed parallel to each other such that the extend lines of the leg iron cores in the longitudinal direction cross at right angles with the longitudinal side of the lower-yoke iron core 6. In this state, these iron cores are kept separated. When the three tanks are connected with the lids of the opening portions removed, or when an erection tank bottom plate iOc is fitted after removal of the lower-yoke iron core assembling tank 20, the opening portions open not upward but in the horizontal direction. Thus, it is possible to prevent dust from entering the tank.<br>
[0039] After that, the lower-yoke iron core 6 is connected to the end portions of the first leg iron core la and the second leg iron core lb to assemble the U-shaped iron core 51. More specifically, the lower-yoke iron core 6 is inserted between the lower ends of the first leg iron<br>
 <br>
core la and the second leg iron core lb, and the lower-yoke iron core 6 and a lower-yoke fixing hardware 101 are secured using a binding tape 120 for example. In this process, the lower-yoke iron core 6 housed in the lower-yoke iron core assembling tank 20 is connected to the lower ends of the first leg iron core la and the second leg iron core lb disposed parallel thereto. That is, when the fitting of the lower-yoke iron core 6 to the lower ends of the first leg iron core la and the second leg iron core lb, the U-shaped iron core 51 is housed in the erection tank 10.<br>
[0040]	In a  state  where the  assembly of the  U-shaped<br>
iron core 51 has been completed, the longitudinal directions of the first leg iron core la, the second leg iron core lb, and the lower-yoke iron core 6 are all horizontal. That is, when viewed as above, the entire integrated iron core has a U-shape.<br>
[0041] After that, an upper portion U-shaped iron core hoisting support 105 connecting the upper end portions of the first leg iron core la and the second leg iron core lb may be fitted to the U-shaped iron core 51 after the first end plate 5a and the second end plate 5b are removed, and then the first end plate 5a and the end plate 5b may be refitted.<br>
[0042]	As  shown in FIG.   3,  in the  U-shaped iron core<br>
transporting/   assembling  tank   50,   after  the   assembly  ofthe U-shaped iron core 51 has been completed, connection between the erection tank opening portion 10b and third opening portion 20a is released. After that, the erection tank opening portion 10b of the erection tank 10 is closed by the erection tank bottom plate 10c such as an iron plate. With the above processes, a state where the assembled U-shaped iron core 51 is housed in the erection tank 10 is obtained.<br>
[0043]	Thus, in the present embodiment, it is possible<br>
to assemble the U-shaped iron core 51 in an environment<br>
almost isolated from the ambient air without using an<br>
assembling room, such as a clean house, for assembling<br>
the U-shaped iron core 51, transformer, or the like, at<br>
the installation site. This allows both assembling<br>
processes of the U-shaped iron core 51 and, e.g., a<br>
transformer assembly clean house to be performed<br>
simultaneously, thereby reducing the entire transformer<br>
installation period and the installation cost.<br>
[0044]	Further,   it   is   possible   to   erect   the   erection<br>
tank 10, in which the U-shaped iron core 51 is housed, by a tow truck 12 (crane truck) by rotating the U-shaped iron core 51 by substantially 90 degrees, so that the erection tank bottom plate 10c becomes the bottom surface. More specifically, as shown in FIG. 4, wires 11, etc. are secured to the erection tank hoisting lugs lOd attached  to  the  erection  tank   10,   and the  erection tank<br>
 <br>
10 is hoisted up by at least two tow trucks 12 followed by rotation of the erection tank 10 by 90D so as to erect it so that the erection tank bottom plate 10c becomes the bottom surface. With this process, it is possible to erect the U-shaped iron core 51.<br>
[0045]	Thereafter,    the    first    end    plate    5a    and    the<br>
second end plate 5b of the erection tank are removed, the<br>
wire 11, etc. is secured to the upper portion U-shaped<br>
iron core hoisting support 105, and the U-shaped iron<br>
core 51 is hoisted up and moved to a predetermined<br>
position.<br>
[0046]	[Second Embodiment]<br>
A second embodiment of the U-shaped iron core transporting/ assembling method according to the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 8 and 9. FIG. 8 shows the U-shaped iron core transporting/ assembling tank 50 used in the present embodiment, which is a schematic plan view showing an example in which the lower-yoke fixing hardware 101 can be divided into a first lower-yoke fixing hardware 101a and a second lower-yoke fixing hardware 101b. FIG. 9 is a schematic side view of FIG. 8. The same reference numerals are given to the same or corresponding parts, and the description will not be repeated.<br>
[0047]	In    the    present    embodiment,    the    lower-yoke<br>
fixing  hardware   101   is   designed   so   as  to  be   divided  at<br>
 <br>
substantially the center thereof into a first lower-yoke fixing hardware 101a and a second lower-yoke fixing hardware 101b. The first lower-yoke fixing hardware 101a and the second lower-yoke fixing hardware 101b have a first lower-yoke fixing hardware connection seat 102a and a second lower-yoke fixing hardware connection seat 102b, respectively so as to be connected to each other.<br>
[0048] At the time when the leg iron cores are transported independently, the first leg iron core la is transported with the first lower-yoke fixing hardware 101a attached thereto and, similarly, the second leg iron core lb is transported with the second lower-yoke fixing hardware 101b attached thereto.<br>
[0049] When the first leg iron core tank 2a and the second leg iron core tank 2b are connected in the assembling process of the U-shaped iron core 51 at the installation site, first the first lower-yoke fixing hardware 101a and the second lower-yoke fixing hardware 101b are connected to each other by the first lower-yoke fixing hardware connection seat 102a and the second lower-yoke fixing hardware connection seat 102b. Then, the lower-yoke iron core 6 is inserted between the lower ends of the first leg iron core la and the second leg iron core lb, and the lower-yoke iron core 6 and lower-yoke   fixing   hardware   101   are   secured   using   a   binding tape  120 for example.<br>
[0050]	Thus,    according   to    the    present   embodiment,<br>
when the lower-yoke iron core 6 and the like are separated from the U-shaped iron core 51 in a factory for disassembled transportation, the lower-yoke fixing hardware 101 need not be removed from the U-shaped iron core 51. Accordingly, after the first leg iron core tank 2a and the second leg iron core tank 2b have been connected to each other in the assembling process of the U-shaped iron core at the installation site, the lower-yoke fixing hardware 101 need not be attached to the U-shaped iron core 51 before insertion of the lower-yoke iron core 6.<br>
[0051]	Further,   since   the   lower-yoke   fixing  hardware<br>
101 is transported in the leg iron core tanks 2a and 2b in<br>
the state of being attached to the leg iron cores la and<br>
lb, it is not necessary to transport the lower-yoke fixing<br>
hardware 101 by itself, thereby reducing the number of<br>
parts to be transported to reduce transportation cost.<br>
[0052]	[Third Embodiment]<br>
A third embodiment of the U-shaped iron core<br>
transporting/ assembling method according to the present<br>
invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 10<br>
and     11.	FIG.     10     shows    the    U-shaped    iron    core<br>
transporting/ assembling tank 50 used in the present embodiment,  which is  a  schematic plan view  showing an<br>
 <br>
example in which the upper portion U-shaped iron core hoisting support 105 can be divided into a first upper portion U-shaped iron core hoisting support 105a and a second upper portion U-shaped iron core hoisting support 105b. FIG. 11 is a schematic side view of FIG. 10. The same reference numerals are given to the same or corresponding parts, and the description will not be repeated.<br>
[0053]	In  the  present   embodiment,   the   upper  portion<br>
U-shaped iron core hoisting support 105 is designed so as to be divided at substantially the center thereof into a first upper portion U-shaped iron core hoisting support 105a and a second upper portion U-shaped iron core hoisting support 105b. The first upper portion U-shaped iron core hoisting support 105a and the second upper portion U-shaped iron core hoisting support 105b have a first upper portion U-shaped iron core hoisting support connection seat 106a and a second upper portion U-shaped iron core hoisting support connection seat 106b, respectively, so as to be connected to each other. [0054] At the time when the leg iron cores are transported independently, the first leg iron core la is transported with the first upper portion U-shaped iron core hoisting support 105a attached thereto and, similarly, the second leg iron core lb is transported with the   second   upper   portion   U-shaped   iron   core   hoisting<br>
 <br>
support 105b attached thereto.<br>
[0055]	When   the   first   leg   iron   core   tank   2a   and   the<br>
second leg iron core tank 2b are connected in the assembling process of the U-shaped iron core 51 at the installation site, first the first upper portion U-shaped iron core hoisting support 105a and the second upper portion U-shaped iron core hoisting support 105b are connected to each other by the first upper portion U-shaped iron core hoisting support connection seat 106a and the second upper portion U-shaped iron core hoisting support connection seat 106b.<br>
[0056]	Thus,    according   to    the    present    embodiment,<br>
when the lower-yoke iron core 6 and the like are<br>
separated from the U-shaped iron core 51 in a factory for<br>
disassembled transportation, the upper portion U-shaped<br>
iron core hoisting support 105 need not be removed from<br>
the U-shaped iron core 51. Accordingly, after the first<br>
leg iron core tank 2a and the second leg iron core tank 2b<br>
have been connected to each other in the assembling<br>
process of the U-shaped iron core 51 at the installation<br>
site, it is possible to easily obtain a state where the<br>
upper portion U-shaped iron core hoisting support 105<br>
has been attached to the leg iron cores la and lb.<br>
[0057]	Further,  since the  upper portion U-shaped iron<br>
core hoisting support 105 is transported in the first leg iron core tank 2a and the second leg iron core tank 2b in<br>
 <br>
the state of being attached to the leg iron cores la and<br>
lb, it is not necessary to transport the upper portion U-<br>
shaped iron core hoisting support 105 by itself, thereby<br>
reducing the number of parts to be transported to reduce<br>
transportation cost.<br>
[0058]	[Fourth Embodiment]<br>
A fourth embodiment of the U-shaped iron core transporting/ assembling method according to the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 12 and 13. FIG. 12 shows the erection tank 10 used in the present embodiment, which is a schematic plan view showing an example in which the side surface opposite to the erection tank opening portion 10b is closed. FIG. 13 is a schematic front view showing an example in which the U-shaped iron core 51 is taken out of the erection tank 10. The same reference numerals are given to the same or corresponding parts, and the description will not be repeated.<br>
[0059]	In   the   present   embodiment,   the   side   surface<br>
opposite to the erection tank opening portion 10b is closed. The present embodiment can be practiced by use of the configuration of the third embodiment in which the first upper portion U-shaped iron core hoisting support 105a and the second upper portion U-shaped iron core hoisting support 105b are connected to each other in the erection tank 10.<br>
 <br>
[0060]	This   eliminates   the   need   to   provide   the   end<br>
plates   5a  and  5b.     Further,   the   side   surface  opposite  to<br>
the    erection    tank    opening    portion    10b    need    not    be<br>
opened/closed,   so   that   it   is   possible   to   prevent   foreign<br>
matters from entering the erection tank 10.<br>
[0061]	As      shown      in      FIG,      13,      in      the      present<br>
embodiment, the first leg iron core tank 2a and the<br>
second leg iron core tank 2b are separated and moved in<br>
the direction away from each other after the erection<br>
tank 10 has been erected, and then the U-shaped iron<br>
core 51 is moved to a predetermined position.<br>
[0062]	[Fifth Embodiment]<br>
A fifth embodiment of the U-shaped iron core<br>
transporting/ assembling method according to the present<br>
invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 14,<br>
15, and 16. FIG. 14 shows the second leg iron core tank<br>
2b used in the present embodiment, which is a schematic<br>
plan view showing an example in which an opening<br>
portion gasket 110 is provided in the opening portions.<br>
FIG. 15 is a schematic front view of FIG. 14, and FIG. 16<br>
is a schematic side view of FIG. 14. The same reference<br>
numerals are given to the same or corresponding parts,<br>
and the description will not be repeated.<br>
[0063]	In the present embodiment,  as  shown in  FIGS.<br>
14 to 16, an opening portion gasket 110 is provided in the second   leg   iron   core   tank   2b   at   its   opening   portions<br>
 <br>
including the second longitudinal opening portion 3b, the<br>
second short opening portion 4b, and the opening portion<br>
opposite to the second short opening portion 4b.<br>
Similarly, although not shown, the opening portion<br>
gasket 110 is provided in the first leg iron core tank 2a<br>
at its opening portions including the first longitudinal<br>
opening portion 3a, the first short opening portion 4a,<br>
and opening portion opposite to the first short opening<br>
portion 4a. These opening portions have a sealable<br>
structure. That is, lids such as an iron plate are fitted<br>
to the opening portion gasket 110 provided at the flange<br>
portion, and bolts, etc. are tightened on the lids.<br>
[0064]	With  this   configuration, . at  the   time  when  the<br>
iron core is transported, the first leg iron core tank 2a<br>
and the second leg iron core tank 2b can be hermetically<br>
sealed by means of dry air or dry nitrogen encapsulation.<br>
This prevents water and foreign matters from entering<br>
the transporting tank even in the case where delay<br>
occurs in the transporting process. In addition, it is<br>
possible to prevent oxidization of the iron core and<br>
adherence of foreign matters to the iron core.<br>
[0065]	Thus, according to the present embodiment, the<br>
first leg iron core  la and the second leg iron core  lb can<br>
be   transported   to   the   installation   site   with   the   high<br>
quality thereof maintained.<br>
[0066]	[Sixth Embodiment]<br>
 <br>
A sixth embodiment of the U-shaped iron core<br>
transporting/ assembling method according to the present<br>
invention will be described with reference to FIG. 17.<br>
FIG. 17 shows the erection tank 10 used in the present<br>
embodiment, which is a schematic plan view showing an<br>
example in which a connection portion gasket 111 is<br>
provided at the connection portion between the first<br>
longitudinal opening portion 3a and the second<br>
longitudinal opening portion 3b. The same reference<br>
numerals are given to the same or corresponding parts,<br>
and the description will not be repeated.<br>
[0067]	In     the     present     embodiment,     a     connection<br>
portion gasket 111 is provided at the flange portions of the longitudinal opening portions 3a and 3b. That is, with the connection portion gasket 111 interposed between the flanges of the longitudinal opening portions 3a and 3b, bolts, etc. are used to fasten the flanges. Similarly, the connection portion gasket 111 is also provided at the erection tank flange 10a and end surface opposite to the erection tank flange 10a. The connection portion gasket 111 provided at the erection tank flange 10a is effective in both the cases where the erection tank bottom plate 10c is connected to the erection tank 10 and where the lower-yoke iron core assembling tank 20 is connected to the erection tank 10. [0068]        With this configuration,  at any stage of during the assembly of the U-shaped iron core 51, after the assembly thereof, and after the erection thereof, the erection tank 10 can be hermetically sealed by means of dry air or dry nitrogen encapsulation. This prevents water and foreign matters from entering the transporting tank even in the case where the U-shaped iron core 51 needs to be kept for long period of time and thereby prevents oxidization of the iron core and adherence of foreign matters to the iron core.<br>
[0069]	Thus, according to the present embodiment, the<br>
first leg iron core  la and the second leg iron core  lb can<br>
be   transported   to   the   installation   site   with   the   high<br>
quality thereof maintained.<br>
[0070]	[Seventh Embodiment]<br>
A seventh embodiment of the U-shaped iron core transporting/ assembling method according to the present invention will be described with reference to FIG. 18. FIG. 18 shows the erection tank 10 used in the present embodiment, which is a schematic plan view showing an example in which spacer plates 115 are provided at the flange portion such as the tank connection portion. The same reference numerals are given to the same or corresponding parts, and the description will not be repeated.<br>
[0071]        As   shown  in  the   fifth  and   sixth  embodiments, in   the   case   where   the   connection  portion   gasket   111   is<br>
 provided at the connection portion and the like, the fastening using bolts, etc. changes the thickness of the gasket. This may lead to a change in the positions of the leg iron cores la and lb that have been fixed to the leg iron tanks 2a and 2b in a factory. In this case, in order to restore the positions of the tanks to those before disassembly, it is necessary to previously measure the gasket thickness before assembly and connect the tanks while adjusting the fastening force of the bolts, etc. so that the gasket thickness is equal to the gasket thickness before disassembly.<br>
[0072]	In   the    present    embodiment,    to    simplify   the<br>
above connecting process, spacer plates 115 are provided at the flange portion of at least one of the first longitudinal opening portion 3a and the second longitudinal opening portion 3b. The spacer plates 115 may be optionally provided at the erection tank flange 10a and end surface opposite to the erection tank flange 10a.<br>
[0073]	With this configuration, it is possible to easily<br>
assemble   the   U-shaped  iron  core   51   without   performing<br>
adjustment of the dimension or level between the two leg<br>
iron   cores   la   and   lb,   thereby   reducing   assembly   man<br>
hours and installation period.<br>
[0074]	[Eighth Embodiment]<br>
An   eighth   embodiment   of   the   U-shaped   iron   core  transporting/ assembling method according to the present invention will be described with reference to FIG. 19. FIG. 19 shows the erection tank 10 used in the present embodiment, which is an enlarged plan view showing an example in which the first leg iron core tank 2a and the second leg iron core tank 2b are fixed together by means of position fixing pins 130 inserted through pin insertion holes 135 formed in the first leg iron core tank 2a and the second leg iron core tank 2b. The same reference numerals are given to the same or corresponding parts, and the description will not be repeated.<br>
[0075]	The  diameter of bolt holes into which bolts for<br>
connecting the leg iron core tanks 2a and 2b needs to be<br>
made larger than the outer diameter of the bolts by about<br>
4 to 5 mm. In this case, it is likely that the positions of<br>
the tanks may be shifted by a difference between the bolt<br>
hole diameter and bolt outer diameter. Thus, in order to<br>
restore the positions of the tanks to those at the<br>
assembly time in a factory, i.e., those before disassembly,<br>
it is necessary to draw guide lines, before disassembly,<br>
on the surface of the connection portion between the leg<br>
iron core tanks 2a and 2b, for example, the surfaces of<br>
the flange portions of the longitudinal opening portions<br>
3a and 3b and connects the tanks while adjusting the<br>
positions of the tanks with reference to the guide lines.<br>
[0076]	In the present embodiment, in order to simplify<br>
 <br>
the above connecting process, pin insertion holes 135 are formed so as to penetrate the flange portion connecting the leg iron core tanks 2a and 2b, for example, the erection tank flange 10a. In the example of FIG. 19, the pin insertion holes 135 are formed in the erection tank flange 10a. Position fixing pins 130 are inserted through the pin insertion holes 135, and leg iron core tanks 2a and 2b are transported to the installation site with the assembly state in the factory maintained. The pin insertion holes 135 may be formed in the longitudinal opening portions 3a and 3b, side surface opposite to the erection tank flange 10a, or the like.<br>
[0077]	With this configuration, it is possible to easily<br>
restore the positional relationship between tanks to the state before disassembly simply by inserting the position fixing pins 130 through the pin insertion holes 135 at the time of connection of the tanks.<br>
[0078]	This     eliminates     the     need     to     employ     an<br>
assembling table which has been generally used in<br>
assembly of the U-shaped iron core 51 and need to<br>
perform adjustment of the dimension or level between the<br>
two leg iron cores la and lb, thereby reducing assembly<br>
man hours and installation period of the U-shaped iron<br>
core 51.<br>
[0079]	[Ninth Embodiment]<br>
A    ninth    embodiment    of   the    U-shaped    iron    core<br>
 <br>
transporting/ assembling method according to the present<br>
invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 20<br>
and 21. FIG. 20 shows the erection tank 10 used in the<br>
present embodiment, which is a schematic plan view<br>
showing an example in which the erection tank 10 is<br>
formed using a connection wire 146. FIG. 21 is a<br>
schematic side view of FIG. 20. The same reference<br>
numerals are given to the same or corresponding parts,<br>
and the description will not be repeated.<br>
[0080]	In the  present  embodiment,  a wire  winder  148<br>
is provided in the first leg iron core tank 2a, and a wire<br>
mounting seat 149 is provided in the second leg iron core<br>
tank 2b. Further, a sliding jig 140 is attached to the<br>
second leg iron core tank 2b. The leg iron core tanks 2a<br>
and 2b are disposed on an assembling stand 150.<br>
[0081]	The second leg iron core tank 2b can be slid on<br>
the assembling stand 150 by the sliding jig 140.<br>
[0082]        The sliding jig 140 may be attached to the first<br>
leg iron core tank 2a so as to allow the first leg iron core<br>
tank   2a   to   be   slid.     Alternatively,   the   sliding  jig   140<br>
may be attached to both the two leg iron cores 2a and 2b.<br>
[0083]	In  the  present  embodiment,   a  connection  wire<br>
146 is installed to the wire winder 148 and wire mounting seat 149, and the wire 148 is used to slide the second leg iron core tank 2b for connection to the first leg   iron   core   tank   2a,   whereby   the   erection   tank   10   is<br>
 <br>
formed.<br>
[0084]	This   eliminates   the   need   to   perform   delicate<br>
position adjustment at the time when the tanks are<br>
connected, thereby further simplifying the connecting<br>
process. Further, there is no need to hoist up the leg<br>
iron core tanks 2a and 2b, so that it is possible to<br>
complete the assembling process of the erection tank 10<br>
only with a crane truck with small hoisting capacity.<br>
Thus, it is possible to reduce cost involved in the<br>
assembly work at the installation site, assembly man<br>
hours, and installation period.<br>

The same reference numerals are given to the same or corresponding parts, and the description will not be repeated.<br>
[0086]	In   the   present   embodiment,   an   upper   surface<br>
opening portion 20c is formed in one surface of the lower-yoke iron core assembling tank 20 which is perpendicular<br>
 <br>
to  the  third  opening portion  20a   and  which  becomes  the<br>
upper   surface  when  the   lower-yoke  iron  core   assembling<br>
tank 20 is connected to the erection tank 10.<br>
[0087]	By   forming   the   upper   surface   opening  portion<br>
20c, it is possible to carry the lower-yoke iron core 6 in the lower-yoke iron core assembling tank 20 irrespective of before or after connection between the lower-yoke iron core assembling tank 20 and erection tank 10 has been completed as long as the lower-yoke iron core assembling tank 20 and erection tank have been arranged such that the erection tank opening portion 10b and third opening portion 20a are opposed to each other. Further, in this example, materials and the like required for the assembly of the U-shaped iron core can be carried in the lower-yoke iron core assembling tank 20 even after the lower-yoke iron core assembling tank 20 has been connected to the erection tank 10, thereby improving workability.<br>
[0088]	An upper surface lid 20d such as an iron plate<br>
is fitted to the upper surface opening portion 20c of the present embodiment. That is, the upper surface opening portion 20c is in a closed state when the iron core and the like are being housed or during transportation. At the closed state, the upper surface opening portion 20c and upper surface lid 20d are sealed by a packing so as to prevent ambient air from entering the lower-yoke iron<br>
 <br>
core assembling tank 20.<br>
