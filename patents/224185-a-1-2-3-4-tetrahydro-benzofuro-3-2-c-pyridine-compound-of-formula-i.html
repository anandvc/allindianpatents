A number of intermediates and starting materials are commercially available or are known compounds which may be prepared according to art-known methodologies.<br><br>
For example, some of the intermediates of formula (III) and their preparations are described in EP-A-0,037,265, EP-A-0,070,053 , EP-A-0,196,132 and in EP-A-0,378,255.<br>
Intermediates of formula (II) can be prepared following the procedures described in Cattanach C. etal. (J. Chem. Soc (C), 1971, p53-60); KartashovaT. (Khim. Geterotsikl. Soedin., 1979 (9), p 1178-1180) and Zakusov. V. Et al. (Izobreteniya, 1992 (15), p 247).<br>
A particular synthesis route for the preparation of intermediates of formula (II) is depicted in scheme 1.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Step a can be performed analogous to the procedure described in tetrahedron (1981), 37, p 979-982. Benzofurans resulting from step c have been used as intermediates in US 4,210,655. The further reaction steps are analogous to the reaction procedures described in US 3,752,820.<br>
Alternatively, intermediates of formula (II) can be prepared using the reaction steps depicted in scheme 2.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Step a can be performed analogous to the procedure described in Heterocycles (1994), 39(1), p. 371-380. Step b can be performed analogous to the procedure described in J. Med. Chem. (1986), 29(9), p. 1643-1650. Further reaction steps can be performed analogous to the ones described in J. Hetercycl. Chem. (1979), 16, p. 1321.<br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I) and some of the intermediates in the present in¬vention contain at least one asymmetric carbon atom. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of said compounds and said intermediates can be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For example, diastereoisomers can be separated by physical methods such as selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. counter current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like methods. Enantiomers can be obtained from racemic mixtures by first converting said racemic mixtures with suitable resolving agents such as, for example, chiral acids, to mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds; then physically separating said mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds by, for example, selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. liquid chromatography and the like methods; and finally converting said separated diastereomeric salts or compounds into the corresponding enantiomers.<br>
Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) may also be obtained from the pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate intermediates and starting materials, provided that the intervening reactions occur stereospecifically. The pure and mixed stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) are intended to be embraced within the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
The compounds of formula (I), the N-oxides, the pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts and stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, block the presynaptic α2-receptors<br>
on central noradrenergic neurons thus increasing the noradrenaline release. Blocking said receptors will suppress or relieve a variety of symptoms associated with a deficiency of noradrenaline in the central or peripheral nervous system. Therapeutic indications for using the present compounds are depression, cognitive disturbances, Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus, sexual dysfunction and impotence and elevated intraocular pressure.<br>
Blocking α2 receptors in the central nervous system has also been shown to enhance<br>
the release of serotonine which may add to the therapeutic action in depression (Maura et al., 1992, Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol., 345 : 410-416).<br>
It has also been shown that blocking α2receptors with the present compounds induces<br>
an increase of extracellular DOPAC (3,4-dihydro-phenylacetic acid) which is a metabolite of dopamine and noradrenaline.<br>
In view of the usefulness of the subject compounds in the treatment of diseases as¬sociated with a deficiency of noradrenaline in the central nervous system, in particular depression and Parkinson's disease, the present invention provides a method of treating warm-blooded animals suffering from such diseases, in particular depression and Parkinson's disease, said method comprising the systemic administration of an therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt thereof.<br>
The present compounds are also potentially useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and dementia as it is known that α2antagonists promote the release of<br>
acetylcholine (Tellezetal. 1997, J. Neurochem. 68:778-785).<br>
In general it is contemplated that an effective therapeutic daily amount would be from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 4 mg/kg body weight.<br>
The present invention thus also relates to compounds of formula (I) as defined hereinabove for use as a medicine. Further, the present invention also relates to the use of a compound of formula (I) for the manufacture of a medicament for treating depression or Parkinson's disease.<br><br>
Ex vivo as well as in vitro receptor signal-transduction and receptor binding studies,<br>
and the ability to reverse a clonidine-induced reduction of electrically-stimulated noradrenaline release from rabbit cerebral cortex can be used to evaluate the α2<br>
adrenoceptor antagonism of the present compounds. As indices of central α2-adrenoceptor blockade in vivo, the reversal of the loss of righting reflex observed in<br>
rats after intravenous injection of xylazine and inhibition of the tremors induced by reserpine in rats can be used.<br>
In the social dominance test in which rats have to compete for drinking a sucrose solution, the compounds of the present invention were able to increase the competitive behavior of the submissive rats.<br>
The present compounds also show effects on the intestine; they reverse the antidiarrheal effect of clonidine and stimulate fecal excretion in non-fasted rats. In dogs, they are able to accelerate the onset of MgSO4-induced diarrhea and in a gastric emptying test in dogs, they have the ability of reversing the delay of gastric emptying induced by the α2 agonist lidamidine. The present compounds are therefore also useful for the treatment of diseases related to disturbed enterokinesia.<br>
The compounds of the present invention also have the ability to rapidly penetrate into the central nervous system.<br>
For administration purposes, the subject compounds may be formulated into various pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, as active ingredient, a therapeutic ally effective amount of a compound of formula (I). To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, in addition salt or in free acid or base form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for administration orally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders,<br><br>
pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable solutions containing compounds of formula (I) may be formulated in an oil for prolonged action. Appropriate oils for this purpose are, for example, peanut oil, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, soy bean oil, synthetic glycerol esters of long chain fatty acids and mixtures of these and other oils. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wettable agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not cause any significant deleterious effects on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on or as an ointment. Addition salts of (I) due to their increased water solubility over the corresponding free base or free acid form, are obviously more suitable in the preparation of aqueous compositions.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical composi¬tions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
The following examples are intended to illustrate the present invention.<br>

Example C.I : In vitro binding affinity for α2 receptors<br>
The interaction of the compounds of formula (I) with α2 receptors was assessed in in<br>
vitro radioligand binding experiments.<br>
In general, a low concentration of a radioligand with a high binding affinity for a particular receptor is incubated with a sample of a tissue preparation enriched in a particular receptor or with a preparation of cells expressing cloned human receptors in a buffered medium. During the incubation, the radioligand binds to the receptor. When equilibrium of binding is reached, the receptor bound radioactivity is separated from the non-bound radioactivity, and the receptor bound activity is counted. The interaction of the test compounds with the receptor is assessed in competition binding experiments. Various concentrations of the test compound are added to the incubation mixture containing the receptor preparation and the radioligand. Binding of the<br><br>
radioligand will be inhibited by the test compound in proportion to its binding affinity<br>
and its concentration.<br>

Example C.2 : Xylazine-induced loss of righting reflex in rats<br>
This test is based upon the fact that centrally actingα2-adrenoceptor antagonists reverse<br>
the loss of righting reflex induced by an intravenous injection of the α2 agonist xylazine.<br>
One hour before injection of xylazine (15 mg/kg, i.v.), male rats (200-250 g) were pretreated with a test compound (per os (p.o.) or subcutaneously (s.c.)) or solvent. In the solvent-treated rats, xylazine-induced loss of the righting reflex was recorded up to 120 minutes after injection. The criterion used for an active test compound was the absence of loss of righting reflex. The lowest active dose (LAD) of the test compounds for xylazine antagonism is defined as the lowest tested dose at which at least 66 % of<br><br>
the tested animals showed no loss of righting reflex. Table 6 lists the test results for the present compounds.<br>
