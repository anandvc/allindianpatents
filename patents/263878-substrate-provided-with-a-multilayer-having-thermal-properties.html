				<td>SUBSTRATE PROVIDED WITH A MULTILAYER HAVING THERMAL PROPERTIES<br>
The invention relates to transparent substrates, especially those made of<br>
rigid mineral material such as glass, said substrates being coated with a<br>
thin-film multilayer comprising a functional layer of metallic type which can<br>
act on solar radiation and/or infrared radiation of long wavelength.<br>
The invention relates more particularly to the use of such substrates for<br>
manufacturing thermal insulation and/or solar protection glazing. This glazing<br>
may be intended for equipping both buildings and vehicles, especially with a<br>
view to reducing air-conditioning load and/or preventing excessive<br>
overheating (glazing called "solar control" glazing) and/or reducing the<br>
amount of energy dissipated to the outside (glazing called "low-e" or<br>
"low-emissivity" glazing) brought about by the ever growing use of glazed<br>
surfaces in buildings and vehicle passenger compartments.<br>
This glazing may furthermore be integrated into glazing units having<br>
particular functionalities, such as, for example, heated windows or<br>
electrochromic glazing.<br>
One type of multilayer known for giving substrates such properties is<br>
composed of a metallic functional layer having reflection properties in the<br>
infrared and/or in solar radiation, especially a metallic functional layer based<br>
on silver or on a metal alloy containing silver.<br>
This metallic functional layer is deposited in a crystalline form on a<br>
wetting layer that is also crystalline and that promotes the suitable crystalline<br>
orientation of the metallic layer deposited on it.<br>
This functional layer is placed between two coatings made of dielectric<br>
material of the metal oxide or nitride type. The multilayer is generally<br>
obtained by a succession of deposition operation; carried out using a vacuum<br>
technique, such as sputtering, optionally magnetically enhanced or magnetron<br>
sputtering. One, or even two, very thin film(s), known as "blocking coatings",<br><br>
may also be provided, this or these being placed directly under, over or on<br>
each side of each silver-based metallic functional layer - the subjacent<br>
coating as a tie, nucleation and/or protection coating, for protection during a<br>
possible heat treatment subsequent to the deposition, and the superjacent<br>
coating as a "sacrificial" or protection coating so as to prevent the silver from<br>
being impaired if a layer that surmounts is deposited by sputtering in the<br>
presence of oxygen or nitrogen and/or if the multilayer undergoes a heat<br>
treatment subsequent to the deposition.<br>
Thus, the use of an amorphous layer based on a mixed zinc and tin oxide,<br>
which is directly in contact with the substrate, under a wetting layer based on<br>
zinc oxide is known from European patent application No. EP 803 481.<br>
It turns out that when such an amorphous layer is not deposited directly<br>
onto the substrate but is inserted between at least one subjacent dielectric<br>
layer and a wetting layer, it makes it possible to modify the interface<br>
between the dielectric layer and the wetting layer located above and thus to<br>
significantly improve the crystallization of the wetting layer and also the<br>
crystallization of the metallic functional layer.<br>
It has been found, surprisingly, that the integration of such an<br>
amorphous layer in the coating that is subjacent to the functional layer and<br>
provided with at least one nitride-based dielectric layer under this amorphous<br>
layer makes it possible to achieve a desired improvement in the crystallization<br>
of the functional layers and thus a desired improvement in the resistivity of<br>
the entire multilayer.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore tc remedy the drawbacks of the<br>
prior art, by developing a novel type of multilayer having layers of the type of<br>
those described above, which multilayer has an improved resistivity, lower<br>
than in a similar multilayer having equivalent unctional layer thickness and<br>
coatings. Said multilayer may or may not undergo one (or more)<br>
high-temperature heat treatment(s) of the bending, toughening or annealing<br><br>
type, but if it does undergo one (or more) such treatment(s), its optical<br>
quality and mechanical integrity will be preserved.<br>
Thus, the subject of the invention, in its broadest acceptance, is a<br>
substrate, especially a transparent glass substrate, provided with a thin-film<br>
multilayer comprising a functional layer having reflection properties in the<br>
infrared and/or in solar radiation, especially a metallic functional layer based<br>
on silver or on a metal alloy containing silver, and two coatings, said coatings<br>
being composed of a plurality of dielectric layers, so that the functional layer<br>
is placed between two coatings, the functional layer being deposited on a<br>
wetting layer itself deposited directly onto a subjacent coating, characterized<br>
in that the subjacent coating comprises at least one dielectric layer based on<br>
nitride, especially on silicon nitride and/or aluminum nitride, and at least one<br>
noncrystalline smoothing layer made from a mixed oxide, said smoothing layer<br>
being in contact with said superjacent wetting layer.<br>
Thus, the invention consists in providing a noncrystalline smoothing layer<br>
under the wetting layer which is crystalline in order to allow suitable growth<br>
of the functional layer located on top of this wetting layer, which smoothing<br>
layer is in contact with the wetting layer directly or via an underblocking<br>
coating.<br>
It has appeared that in the case where the subjacent coating comprises<br>
at least one dielectric layer based on nitride, especially on silicon nitride<br>
and/or aluminum nitride, choosing a noncrystalline smoothing layer made<br>
from a mixed oxide made it possible to obtain good resistivity of the<br>
multilayer and optical properties suitable for the expectations whether or not<br>
the substrate undergoes a heat treatment after deposition.<br>
The invention thus applies to substrates known as "toughened or<br>
untoughened" substrates insofar as it is possible, on the same building facade<br>
for example, to place near each other glazing that integrate toughened<br>
substrates  and  untoughened  substrates,  without  it  being  possible  to<br><br>
distinguish them from one another by simple visual observation of the color in<br>
reflection and of the light reflection.<br>
Within the meaning of the present invention, when it is stated that a<br>
deposition of a layer or a coating (comprising one or more layers) is carried<br>
out directly under or directly on another deposit, it means that no other layer<br>
can be interposed between these two deposits.<br>
The smoothing layer is said to be "noncrystalline" in the sense that it can<br>
be completely amorphous or partially an orphous, and thus partially<br>
crystalline, but that it cannot be completely crystalline over its entire<br>
thickness. It may be of metallic nature as it is based on a mixed oxide (a<br>
mixed oxide is an oxide of at least two elements).<br>
The crystallographic appearance of the smoothing layer is inevitably<br>
different from that of the wetting layer since the smoothing layer is<br>
noncrystalline whereas the wetting layer is, for the most part, crystalline;<br>
they can therefore not be confused from this point of view.<br>
The advantage of such a smoothing layer is to make it possible to obtain<br>
an interface with the directly superjacent wetting layer that is not very<br>
rough. This low roughness can furthermore be seen with a transmission<br>
electron microscope.<br>
Furthermore, the wetting layer has a better texture and, in addition, has<br>
a preferential crystallographic orientation that is more pronounced.<br>
Each smoothing layer is thus made of a different material, differing both<br>
from a crystallographic and stoichiometric point of view, from that of the<br>
wetting layer under which it is directly placed.<br>
The nitride-based layer of the subjacent coating, which in addition<br>
comprises the smoothing layer, is in contact with the substrate, directly or<br>
indirectly via a contact layer, for example based on titanium oxide (TiOz).<br>
The index of this nitride-based layer is, preferably, less than 2.2.<br>
Preferably, the smoothing layer is a mixed oxide layer based on an oxide<br>
of one or more of the following metals: Sn, Si, Ti, Zr, Hf, Zn, Ga, In and more<br><br>
precisely a layer of a mixed oxide based on zinc and tin or a layer of a mixed<br>
indium tin oxide (ITO) deposited at low temperature.<br>
The index of the smoothing layer is, preferably, less than 2.2.<br>
Preferably, in addition, the smoothing layer is a mixed oxide layer having<br>
a nonstoichiometric amount of oxygen and even more particularly a<br>
substoichiometric mixed oxide layer based on zinc and tin, doped with<br>
antimony (SnZnOx:Sb, x being a number).<br>
Furthermore, the smoothing layer preferably has a geometric thickness<br>
between 0.1 and 30 nm and more preferably between 0.2 and 10 nm.<br>
In a preferred variant, at least one blocking coating is based on Ni or on<br>
Ti or is based on an Ni-based alloy, and especially is based on an NiCr alloy.<br>
In addition, the wetting layer subjacent to the functional layer is,<br>
preferably, based on zinc oxide; this wetting layer may be, in particular,<br>
based on aluminum-doped zinc oxide.<br>
The geometric thickness of the wetting layer is preferably between 2 and<br>
30 nm and more preferably between 3 and 20 nm.<br>
The glazing according to the invention incorporates at least the substrate<br>
carrying the multilayer according to the invention, optionally combined with<br>
at least one other substrate. Each substrate may be clear or tinted. At least<br>
one of the substrates may especially be made of bulk-tinted glass. The choice<br>
of coloration type will depend on the level of light transmission and/or on the<br>
colorimetric appearance that is desired for the glazing once its manufacture<br>
has been completed.<br>
Thus, for glazing intended to equip vehicles, some standards dictate that<br>
windshields should have a light transmission TL of about 75%, while other<br>
standards impose a light transmission TL of about 65%; such a level of<br>
transmission is not required for the side windows or the sunroof for example.<br>
The tinted glass that can be used is for example that which, for a thickness of<br>
4 mm, has a TL of 65% to 95%, an energy transmission TE of 40% to 80%, a<br>
dominant wavelength in transmission of 470 nm tc 525 nm, associated with a<br><br>
transmission purity of 0.4% to 6% under illuminant D65, which may "result" in<br>
the (L, a*, b*) colorimetry system, in a* and b* values in transmission of<br>
between -9 and 0 and between -8 and +2 respectively.<br>
For glazing intended to equip buildings, the glazing preferably has a light<br>
transmission TL of at least 75% or higher in the case of "low-emissivity"<br>
applications, and a light transmission TL of at least 40% or higher for "solar<br>
control" applications.<br>
The glazing according to the invention may have a laminated structure,<br>
especially one combining at least two rigid substrate of the glass type with at<br>
least one sheet of thermoplastic polymer, so as to have a structure of the<br>
type: glass/thin-film multilayer/sheet(s)/glass. The polymer may especially<br>
be based on polyvinyl butyral (PVB), ethylene/vinyl acetate (EVA),<br>
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC).<br>
The glazing may also have what is called an asymmetric laminated<br>
glazing structure, which combines a rigid substrate of the glass type with at<br>
least one sheet of polymer of the polyurethane :ype having energy-absorbing<br>
properties, optionally combined with another layer of polymers having<br>
"self-healing" properties. For further details about this type of glazing, the<br>
reader may refer especially to patents EP-0 132 198, EP-0 131 523, EP-0 389<br>
354.<br>
The glazing may therefore have a structure of the type: glass/thin-film<br>
multilayer/polymer sheet(s).<br>
The glazing according to the invention is capable of undergoing a heat<br>
treatment without damaging the thin-film multilayer. The glazing is therefore<br>
possibly curved and/or toughened.<br>
The glazing may be curved and/or toughened when consisting of a single<br>
substrate, that provided with the multilayer. It is then referred to as<br>
"monolithic" glazing. When the glazing is curved, especially for the purpose of<br>
making windows for vehicles, the thin-film multilayer is preferably on an at<br>
least partly nonplanar face.<br><br>
The glazing may also be a multiple glazing unit, especially a<br>
double-glazing unit, at least the substrate carrying the multilayer being<br>
curved and/or toughened. It is preferable in a multiple glazing configuration<br>
for the multilayer to be placed so as to face the intermediate gas-filled space.<br>
In a laminated structure, the substrate carrying the multilayer is preferably in<br>
contact with the sheet of polymer.<br>
When the glazing is monolithic or is in the form of multiple glazing of the<br>
double-glazing or laminated glazing type, at least the substrate carrying the<br>
multilayer may be made of curved or toughened glass, it being possible for<br>
this substrate to be curved or toughened before or after the multilayer has<br>
been deposited.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for manufacturing substrates<br>
according to the invention, which consists in depositing the thin-film<br>
multilayer on its substrate by a vacuum technique of the sputtering,<br>
optionally magnetically enhanced sputtering, type and then in carrying out a<br>
heat treatment of the bending, toughening or annealing type on the coated<br>
substrate without degrading its optical and/or mechanical quality.<br>
However, it is not excluded for the first layer or first layers of the<br>
multilayer to be able to be deposited by another technique, for example by a<br>
thermal decomposition technique of the pyrolysis type.<br>
The details and advantageous features of the invention will become<br>
apparent from the following nonlimiting examples, illustrated by means of the<br>
attached figures:<br>
-	Figure 1 illustrates the change, before heat treatment, in the sheet<br>
resistance of a multilayer having a single functional layer provided<br>
with a coating having a single overblocking layer, with and without a<br>
smoothing layer, as a function of the thickness of the dielectric layer<br>
placed underneath;<br>
-	Figure 2 illustrates the change, after heat treatment, in the sheet<br>
resistance of the same multilayer having a single functional layer as<br><br>
in Figure 1, with and without a smoothing layer, as a function of the<br>
thickness of the dielectric layer placed underneath;<br>
-	Figure 3 illustrates the change, before heat treatment, in the sheet<br>
resistance of a multilayer having a single functional layer provided<br>
with a coating having a single overblocking layer as a function of the<br>
thickness of the smoothing layer;<br>
-	Figure 4 illustrates the change, after heat treatment, in the sheet<br>
resistance of the same multilayer having a single functional layer as<br>
in Figure 3, as a function of the thickness of the smoothing layer;<br>
-	Figure 5 illustrates a multilayer having a single functional layer<br>
according to the invention, the functional layer being provided with<br>
an overblocking coating but not an underblocking coating;<br>
-	Figure 6 illustrates a multilayer having a single functional layer<br>
according to the invention, the functional layer being provided with<br>
an underblocking coating but not with an overblocking coating; and<br>
-	Figure 7 illustrates a multilayer having a single functional layer<br>
according to the invention, the functional layer being provided with<br>
an underblocking coating and with an overblocking coating.<br>
In the figures illustrating the multilayers, the thicknesses of the various<br>
materials have not been drawn strictly to scale in order to make them easier<br>
to understand.<br>
Furthermore, in all the examples below the thin-film multilayer is<br>
deposited on a substrate 10 made of soda-lime glass having a thickness of<br>
2 mm.<br>
In each case where a heat treatment was applied to the substrate, this<br>
was an annealing treatment for around 5 minutes at a temperature of around<br>
660' C followed by cooling in ambient air (around 20 oC).<br><br>
The objective of Figures 1 to 4 is to illustrate the importance of the<br>
presence of a smoothing layer in a multilayer of the type of that illustrated in<br>
Figure 5, which shows a multilayer according to the invention.<br>
An example, numbered 1, of a multilayer laving a single functional layer<br>
according to the invention is of the type:<br>
Substrate / Si3N4 / SnZnOx:Sb / ZnO / Ag / Ti / ZnO / Si3N4<br>
Variable / Variable / 8 nm / 10 nm / 2 nm / 8 nm / 20 nm<br>
In Figures 1 and 2, the curves C1 and C11 illustrate the change in the<br>
sheet resistance (in ohms) of the multilayer as a function of the thickness of<br>
the dielectric layer based on silicon nitride (e Si3N4) in contact with the<br>
substrate, before (BHT) and after (AHT) heat treatment respectively, when<br>
the multilayer is not provided with a smoothing layer.<br>
The curves C2 and C12 illustrate the change in the sheet resistance (in<br>
ohms) of the multilayer as a function of the thickness of the dielectric layer<br>
based on silicon nitride (e Si3N4) in contact with the substrate, before and<br>
after heat treatment respectively, when the multilayer is provided with a<br>
smoothing layer made from SnZnOx:Sb having a thickness of 6 nm (x denotes a<br>
non-zero number).<br>
The curves C3 and C13 illustrate the change in the sheet resistance (in<br>
ohms) of the multilayer as a function of the thickness of the dielectric layer<br>
based on silicon nitride (e Si3N4) in contact with the substrate, before and<br>
after heat treatment respectively, when the multilayer is provided with a<br>
smoothing layer based on SnZnOx:Sb having a thickness of 20 nm.<br>
As can be seen in these Figures 1 and 2, for the same thickness of<br>
dielectric layer in contact with the substrate (for example 20 nm), the sheet<br>
resistance of the multilayer is always lower - therefore better - for curves C2,<br>
C3, C12 and C13 when the multilayer comprises a smoothing layer based on<br>
SnZnOx:Sb between the dielectric layer based on silcon nitride in contact with<br>
the substrate and the wetting layer based on zinc oxide ZnO subjacent to the<br><br>
functional layer based on silver Ag and the sheet resistance of the multilayer<br>
is always lower for a smoothing layer thickness of 20 nm (curves C3 and C13).<br>
It was verified that the smoothing layer made from a mixed oxide is<br>
amorphous throughout its thickness, whereas the wetting layer and the<br>
metallic functional layer are both crystalline, throughout their thickness.<br>
Consequently, the presence of the smoothing layer significantly improves<br>
the sheet resistance of the multilayer for comparable thickness of the<br>
subjacent dielectric layer, and this improvement is even greater when the<br>
thickness of the smoothing layer is large.<br>
In Figures 3 and 4, the curves illustrate the change in the sheet<br>
resistance (in ohms) of the multilayer as a function of the thickness of the<br>
smoothing layer based on zinc and tin oxide doped with antimony (e<br>
SnZnOx:Sb), before (BHT) and after (AHT) heat treatment respectively, when<br>
the multilayer is provided with a 20 nm layer based on silicon nitride Si3N4<br>
between the substrate and the layer based on 5nZnOx:Sb.<br>
It was also verified that the smoothing layer made from a mixed oxide is<br>
amorphous throughout its thickness, whereas the wetting layer and the<br>
metallic functional layer are both crystalline, throughout their thickness.<br>
As can be seen in these Figures 3 and 4 also, the presence of the<br>
smoothing layer significantly improves the sheet resistance of the multilayer<br>
for a smoothing layer with a thickness between &gt; 0 and 4 nm, and this<br>
improvement is even greater when the thickness of the smoothing layer is<br>
large.<br>
Similar observations may be made with a multilayer having a single<br>
functional layer provided with an underblocking coating and without an<br>
overblocking coating or provided with an underblocking coating and with an<br>
overblocking coating.<br>
Another series of tests was carried out.<br><br>
Three examples, numbered 2, 3 and 4, were produced based on the<br>
multilayer structure having a single functional layer illustrated in Figure 5, in<br>
which the functional layer 40 is provided with an overblocking coating 45.<br>
Table 1 below illustrates the thicknesses in nanometers of each of the<br>
layers:<br><br>
The resistivity, optical and energy characteristics of these examples are<br>
given in Table 2 below:<br><br>
Thus, the resistivity of the multilayer both before and after heat<br>
treatment of example 4 according to the invention is still lower than the<br>
counterexamples 3 and 2 respectively.<br><br>
Furthermore, the light reflection RL, the light transmission TL measured<br>
under illuminant D65 and the colors in reflection a* and b* in the LAB system<br>
measured under illuminant D65 on the side of the layers do not vary very<br>
significantly between the example according to the invention and the<br>
counterexamples 3 and 2.<br>
By comparing the optical and energy characteristics before heat<br>
treatment with these same characteristics after heat treatment, no major<br>
degradation was observed.<br>
Other tests were carried out based on the multilayer structure having a<br>
single functional layer illustrated in Figure 6, in which the functional layer 40<br>
is provided with an overblocking coating 45 but not with an underblocking<br>
coating 35.<br>
Other tests were carried out based on the multilayer structure having a<br>
single functional layer illustrated in Figure 7, in which the functional layer 40<br>
is provided with an underblocking coating 35 ana with an overblocking coating<br>
45.<br>
All these tests led to similar observations.<br>
In addition, tests were conducted in order to measure the roughness of<br>
the layers.<br>
Table 3 below illustrates the roughness measured by X-ray reflectometry<br>
and expressed in nm (the roughness of the substrate being around 0.4):<br><br><br><br>
As can be seen in this table, the roughness of the layer based on silicon<br>
nitride Si3N4 deposited alone on the glass is hign, but the final roughness of a<br>
multilayer comprising a layer based on indium tin oxide SnlnOx (ITO) or a layer<br>
based on a mixed zinc tin oxide SnZnOx:Sb deposited on the layer based on<br>
silicon nitride is lower. The wetting layer based on a mixed oxide thus makes<br>
it possible to improve the roughness of the interface in contact with the<br>
wetting layer, by reducing this roughness.<br>
The present invention has been described above by way of example. It<br>
will be understood that a person skilled in the art is capable of producing<br>
various alternative forms of the invention without thereby departing from the<br>
scope of the patent as defined by the claims.<br><br>
