				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of natural pigment based paracetamol syrup formulation.<br>
The present invention particularly relates to an improved formulation with natural pigment -anthocyanin, for paracetamol syrup. This formulation has use as an antipyretic analgesic, particularly for children. Commercial syrup samples are pale-pink in color imparted due to synthetic dyes (carmine). The market for paracetamol in India is estimated to be Rs. 2.7 billion, and is growing at 7-8% each year. Around 44% of the market has been for oral preparations, wherein sales have been increasing 2-3% per annum.<br>
In recent years the use of natural colorants is preferred in food and pharmaceutical products because of the consumer preference towards more natural products, which are known to exhibit specific functional attributes. Certain natural colorants, particularly anthocyanins, are known to possess functional properties such as anti-oxidants, hence having health promoting effects (Igarashi et al (1989) Nippon Shokuhin Kogyo Gakkaishi 36: 852-856 and Kamei et al (1993) J. Clinical Expt. Med. 164:829-832).<br>
Reference may be made to Psczozola, (1998, Food Technology 52:70-82) where in among the natural red colourants from plant sources, red pigments such as anthocyanin from fruits and vegetables have been suggested for food applications. Reference may be made to Harborne JB et al, (1975, The Flavonoids, Chapman &amp; Hall, London) where in anthocyanin is chemically grouped as "flavonoid", which is synthesized in a vast number of higher plants. Reference may be made to Shrikhande AJ (1986, Anthocyanins in foods, CRC Crit. Rev. Food Sci &amp; Nutrition,<br>
7: 193-213) where in several edible fruits are good sources of anthocyanin. Apart from imparting attractive red color, reference may be made to Stahl W &amp; Sies H (1993, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 691: 10-19) and Narayan et al.(1999, Prostagland. Leuk. Essent. Fatty Acid 60:1-4) wherein it has high anti-oxidant activity and thus impart health-promoting effect to higher animals and human beings.<br>
Reference may be made to Timberlake CF &amp; Henry BS (1986, Plant pigments as natural food colours, Endeavor NS 10: 31 - 36 ) where in the red grapes serve as an excellent source of anthocyanin and thus imparting attractive red color to red wines.<br>
Reference may be made to Diplock AT et al (1998, British Jour. Nutrition, Suppl. 1, S77-S112) where in anthocyanin extracts prepared from vegetables and edible fruits are used as edible colours throughout the world. Reference may be made to von-Elbe JH (1986, Chemical changes in plant and animal pigments during food processing. In. Role of Chemistry in the Quality of Processed Food. Ed. Owen R. Fennema et al, Food and Nutrition Press 41-64, Westport, Connecticut) where in anthocyanins are known to undergo chemical changes when incorporated in food products. The stability of natural red pigments, anthocyanins, from plant sources is strongly affected by light, pH, temperature, oxygen and water activity. In the present invention, the anthocyanins obtained from red edible grapes have been used to develop a syrup formulation with paracetamol as the active ingredient, and the formulation can be scaled up to commercial level.<br>
In the present invention, the synthetic dye is replaced with several levels of anthocyanin extracted from red grapes to match the hue of synthetic dye in syrup. The levels of components such as propylene glycol and glycerol in the syrup were varied to obtain good stability of anthocyanin for shelf life of over 100 days under varied light and temperature conditions.<br>
Reference may be made to Ames and Hoffmann (2001, Chemistry and Physiology of Selected Food Colorants, American Chemical Society Series 775, Washington, DC), wherein it has been quoted as FDA permits anthocyanin from grape skin as a food additive. The World Health Organization (1982), recommended an average daily intake of 2.5 mg anthocyanin/Kg body weight/day from grape skin extract. Production of anthocyanin concentrates from various plant parts and their use in food products has been studied for many years and there are many research articles and patents concerning it. The advantages of incorporating natural anthocyanin in food formulations are many.<br>
Reference may be made to Gorcia-Viguera et al (1999, J. Food Sci.64: 243-247, and Food Science and Technology International 1999, 4: 99-105) where in influence of different factors on anthocyanin concentration and color in several food products such as jams, pomegranate juice during storage were studied. The use of anthocyanins in pharmaceutical products such as syrup formulated with paracetamol is not known. Certain commercial formulation of syrups containing the active ingredient, paracetamol, has pale pink hue caused due to the addition of synthetic dye (carmine). Such synthetic dyes are known to cause harmful effects in human beings. While tablet formulations without any added color<br>
are available for adults and for children below 8 years, syrups are proposed which invariably contain synthetic dye. Since there is a worldwide preference for natural colourants in food and Pharmaceuticals, the replacement of synthetic colours with natural ones such as anthocyanin will be advantageous due to health considerations.<br>
The improvement in syrup formulation by incorporation of natural colourant, anthocyanin, is two-fold. Firstly it will replace the undesirable synthetic dye while imparting a similar color effect to the formulation. Secondly, the levels of incorporation act as nutraceutical owing to their anti-oxidant effect in human systems.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of natural pigment based paracetamol syrup formulation Another objective of the present invention is to explore the possibility of developing paracetamol syrup formulation with natural red color with a hue value comparable to the commercial formulation.<br>
Still yet another objective of the present invention is to experiment and find out the level of pigment that may be needed to obtain a stable hue of the natural colour under expected fluctuations in light and temperature conditions during a known time period.<br>
Still yet another objective of the present invention is to explore the stability of the natural color, in the final formulation, under various light and temperature conditions.<br>
Still yet another objective of the present invention is to explore the effect of the natural color on the active ingredient i.e., paracetamol.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of natural pigment based paracetamol syrup formulation which comprises<br>
a)	mixing 50-60 weight% Propylene glycol, 40-43 weight% Glycerol, and<br>
