				<td>TWIN-SHEET THERMOFORMING OF PLASTIC FUEL TANKS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention refers to the thermoforming of plastic fuel tanks having high<br>
structural features and gas barrier, starting from layered sheets of plastic<br>
material, such as high-density polyolefin with EVOH barrier for containment of<br>
fuel vapors; in particular the invention relates to a method for manufacturing fuel<br>
tanks by "twin-sheet" thermoforming technology, and relative plant.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Metal fuel tanks are widely used in several fields, for example for supply<br>
fuel to internal combustion engines, both in terrestrial and nautical vehicles and<br>
in aircrafts, as well as for other uses; however, the metal fuel tanks currently in<br>
use are heavy, difficult to shape and subjected to corrosion.<br>
The current tendency is to replace the metal fuel tanks with fuel tanks in<br>
layered plastic material, due to their greater lightness and ability to withstand to<br>
corrosion, and the possibility to be manufactured by deep drawing in complex<br>
shapes.<br>
The rules presently in force, however, tend more and more to reduce the<br>
quantity of gaseous emissions and fuel vapors from the tanks, in order to reduce<br>
environmental pollution. For such purpose, the possible gas and vapor emission<br>
paths through apertures in the walls of the fuel tanks, necessary for connection<br>
to fittings and component parts, must be reduced to a minimum. In addition, the<br>
current approach is to install a large part of the components and accessories<br>
necessary for feeding the fuel to an engine or user, inside the same fuel tank.<br>
In the manufacture of fuel tanks in plastic material, use generally is made<br>
of blow molding technology, according to which a parison or a tubular element of<br>
plastic material is extruded between two half molds, which are subsequently<br>
clamped for peripherally pinching the parison disposed between them; a<br>
pressurised fluid is then injected into the parison to cause the expansion and<br>
adhering the internal surfaces of the mold.<br>
In fuel tanks manufacturing by blow molding technology, after the shaping<br>
step it is necessary to make some apertures in the walls of the tank to install the<br>
various components, both inside and outside the tank. All this involves extremely<br><br>
complex solutions, long and somewhat expensive manufacturing procedures, as<br>
well as a high risk of emission of hydrocarbons through apertures in the fuel<br>
tanks, in the event not being accurately sealed. Moreover, whenever it is<br>
necessary to manufacture fuel tanks by multi-layered material, any control of the<br>
wall thickness, proves to be extremely difficult to achieve.<br>
In order to partially obviate these drawbacks, and to achieve a<br>
quantitatively high output, US 6,372,176 and WO 02/14050 propose the use of<br>
the known twin-sheet thermoforming technology.<br>
According to this technology, sheets of thermoplastic material are heated<br>
and processed in respective molding station in which each individual sheet of<br>
material is thermoformed in a shell, inside a corresponding mold; two shells are<br>
subsequently joined and sealed around their peripheral edges to form a fuel tank.<br>
According to said documents, first and second sheets of plastic material<br>
are heated and processed along independent processing lines where each<br>
plastic sheet is moved from a loading station, to a thermoforming station in which<br>
each preheated sheet is thermoformed in a respective female mold; a first one of<br>
the molds is mounted in a facing-up disposition on a lower platen, while the<br>
second mold is mounted in a facing down disposition on an upper platen of a<br>
press.<br>
After the two sheets has been thermoformed, the upper mold must be<br>
firstly aligned to the lower mold and then lowered to apply a force to fuse and<br>
sealing the thermoformed shells along their peripheral edges.<br>
WO 03/097330 also relates to an apparatus for thermoforming twin-sheet<br>
hollow plastic articles in which again use is made of upwardly and downwardly<br>
facing thermoforming molds.<br>
Operators can introduce various inserts and/or components in pre-<br>
established positions, before the two shells are joined and sealed to form a tank.<br>
Although the solutions proposed in the prior art documents enable the<br>
twin-sheet thermoforming technology to be used for obtaining high production<br>
volumes, it is susceptible to further improvements tending to improve both the<br>
manufacturing process, and the thermoformed fuel tanks.<br>
In fact, according to prior-art documents, the thermoforming of the lower<br><br>
shell takes place by maintaining a facing-up disposition of the cavity of the lower<br>
mold, while the thermoforming of the upper shell is carried out by maintaining a<br>
facing down disposition of the cavity of the upper mold.<br>
All this entails considerable difficulties in thermoforming the upper shell,<br>
as well as structural unevenness in the fuel tank, due to a different sagging and<br>
stretching of the plastic sheets, in particular of the upper sheet in that the facing<br>
down cavity of the upper mold is opposite to the sag caused during the heating of<br>
the plastic sheet.<br>
The different disposition and the different orientation of the two molds, as<br>
well as the different stretching conditions of the two plastic sheets caused by the<br>
sag, consequently entail structural unevenness and thickness differences in the<br>
two shells, which are difficult to eliminate.<br>
Moreover, the different disposition of the molds in the two processing lines<br>
complicates the insertion of components into the fuel tank, making the installation<br>
extremely cumbersome and difficult for an operator to gain access in order to<br>
carry out the necessary checks and inspections. Replacement of the molds and<br>
the fixtures or jigs is also made difficult to carry out.<br>
In the manufacture of storage tanks in plastic material, in order to provide<br>
the necessary structural resistance and the required hydrocarbon gas-tightness<br>
or barrier, in general use is made of layered plastic material by overlapping a<br>
number of plastic sheets having different chemical and/or physical properties.<br>
Since, in the manufacture of plastic fuel tanks, according to the current<br>
technologies, large quantities of scraps are produced, and since certain costly<br>
plastic materials are difficult to recovery, there is the big problem of finding new<br>
molding systems whereby, in addition to improving the output, the scraps and,<br>
consequently, the molding costs of the tanks can be reduced to a minimum.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, the main object of this invention is to provide a method and a<br>
plant for thermoforming hollow bodies, in particular fuel tanks by means of the<br>
twin-sheet thermoforming technology, capable of providing greater simplification<br>
of the manufacturing cycle, and of processing in a substantially identical way the<br>
plastic sheets designed to form the two shells of a fuel tank.<br><br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a method and a plant as<br>
mentioned above, whereby it is possible to manufacture fuel tanks characterised<br>
by a high degree of structural homogeneity.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide a method and a plant for<br>
manufacturing fuel tanks by means of the twin-sheet thermoforming technology<br>
which, in addition to operating simultaneously on both processing lines, also<br>
make it possible to operate with extremely short production cycles, in a<br>
substantially continuous way, without downtimes, considerably simplifying the<br>
insertion of the components into the molds.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a method for thermoforming<br>
fuel tanks in plastic material, whereby it is possible to substantially reduce the<br>
problems related to recovery of the scraps, in that it allows a smaller loss of<br>
valuable material.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide easy accessibility to the<br>
forming area, as well as facilitating the maintenance operations for the entire<br>
plant.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the invention, all the above is achievable by means of a<br>
method for twin-sheet thermoforming of fuel tanks and with a plant described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
More precisely the present invention provides a method for thermoforming<br>
plastic fuel tanks, according to which first and second sheets of thermoformable<br>
plastic material are heated and independently moved and processed, along a<br>
first, and, respectively, along a second processing line, from a loading station to a<br>
respective thermoforming station, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
-	subjecting each plastic sheet to a heating ;<br>
-	pneumatically clamping the heated plastic sheets along their peripheral<br>
edges by air suction, and vacuum supporting the said sheets in a substantially flat<br>
condition by controlling the vacuum degree, while they are moved along their<br>
respective processing lines ;<br>
-	positioning each heated plastic sheet above a respective shaping mold<br>
having a facing-up shaping cavity, while continuing to pneumatically hold the<br>
sheet in the aforesaid substantially flat condition ;<br><br>
-	lowering the heated plastic sheet into a respective mold; and<br>
-	thermoforming each heated plastic sheet into a respective shell, making<br>
the same sheet to adhere to the upwardly open cavity of the shaping mold;<br>
the method also comprising the supplementary steps of:<br>
-	up-side down turning one of the shaping molds and the thermoformed<br>
shell;<br>
-	superimposing said up-side down turned mold to the other one facing up<br>
mold, to overlap peripheral sealing areas of the two superimposed thermoformed<br>
shells; and<br>
-	fusing and hermetically welding the overlapped sealing areas of the<br>
shells by pressing said overlapped sealing areas between clamping surfaces of<br>
the shaping molds.<br>
According to another feature, the invention relates to a twin-sheet<br>
thermoforming plant for the manufacture of plastic fuel tanks comprising first and<br>
second twin-sheet thermoformed shells, according to which first and second<br>
thermoformable plastic sheets are independently heated and moved along<br>
respective first and second processing lines, from a loading station through at<br>
least one heating station, towards a respective thermoforming station where the<br>
individual plastic sheets are thermoformed in a first and a second shell into a<br>
respective first and second shaping mold, wherein:<br>
said first and second shaping molds are side by side arranged with the<br>
open cavities of both molds facing upwards;<br>
wherein each processing line comprises pneumatically actuable gripping<br>
means for gripping the plastic sheets around their peripheral edges, and a<br>
vacuum sheet holding device for the heated plastic sheets, said pneumatic<br>
gripping means and said vacuum holding device being movable along the<br>
processing lines; and vacuum control means for the vacuum holding device for<br>
supporting the heated plastic sheets in a substantially flat condition; and<br>
drive means conformed and arranges to turn one mold upside down to<br>
superimpose to the other one and to cause welding of overlapped sealing areas<br>
of the thermoformed shells, by compression of the same molds.<br>
Before heating at the thermoforming temperature, each plastic sheet can<br><br>
be subjected to a preheating, followed by a centering in a successive centering<br>
station, to allow a correct pneumatic gripping of the peripheral edges of the<br>
sheet; if required, the centering may precede the preheating step. In addition, by<br>
using special pneumatic frames, it is possible to substantially reduce the gripping<br>
surfaces of the sheets and consequently the scraps of material.<br>
According to a further feature of the invention, the substantial flatness of<br>
the plastic sheets, both during the heating and the movement of the heated<br>
sheet towards the thermoforming station, can be suitably controlled by changing<br>
the softening temperature of the plastic material, and/or adjusting the vacuum<br>
inside the supporting device.<br>
For the purposes of this specification, the term "substantially flat" is<br>
understood to mean a condition in which the heated sheet is pneumatically held<br>
on the peripheral edges, and is vacuum supported on the upper side, without<br>
sagging downwards to any great degree, due to the gravity.<br>
According to another feature of the invention, the heating, centering and<br>
thermoforming steps of the plastic sheets along the two processing lines, can be<br>
carried out cyclically, by feeding the individual sheets along the two processing<br>
lines while several operations are carried out simultaneously, or in succession.<br>
According to the invention, after the thermoforming and sealing of the two<br>
shells into a tank, it is possible to carry out a cooling step of the fuel tank in a<br>
separate cooling station, disposed at a side of the processing lines. Since the<br>
cooling of the molds and the thermoformed tank takes a considerable length of<br>
time, in this way it is possible to cool the tanks after the thermoforming, without<br>
stopping or affecting the manufacturing process. This can be achieved by<br>
disposing, on one side of one of the two processing lines, in correspondence with<br>
the thermoforming station, a cooling station comprising a rotary table or a<br>
reciprocable shuttle having two or more mold supporting zones, which can from<br>
time to time be aligned with the thermoforming stations of the processing lines, to<br>
support the closed molds and the thermoformed tank.<br>
The two closed molds with the tank can be simply transferred onto the<br>
rotary table or onto the supporting shuttle. Consequently, whenever the sealing<br>
of the two shells and the cooling of the storage tank take place by feeding a<br><br>
pressurised fluid into the same tank, in correspondence with the cooling station it<br>
is necessary to make use of a suitable clamping press to maintain the tank<br>
closed into the two molds. Optionally, it is possible to make use of a special cage<br>
for containing the closed molds, as an alternative to the press in the cooling<br>
station.<br>
According to a further feature of the invention, a method and a plant for<br>
twin-sheet thermoforming of storage tanks have been provided, whereby the two<br>
processing lines can be disposed and parallely arranged with both facing up<br>
molds at a same level; this greatly facilitates the access of one or more operators<br>
to the entire plant, for the necessary controls, such as for introduction of<br>
components into the two shells, as well as for all the necessary maintenance<br>
operations. Replacement of the molds is also greatly facilitated and can be<br>
carried out outside of the two processing lines, in correspondence with the<br>
cooling station.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As shown in figure 1, the twin-sheet thermoforming of fuel tanks takes<br>
place by processing individual sheets of thermoformable plastic material along<br>
two separate processing lines 10A and 10B, which parallely extend from a<br>
loading station for the plastic sheets, to a thermoforming station through<br>
intermediate work stations; along the two lines 10A, 10B, the individual plastic<br>
sheets are heated and shaped in respective thermoformed shells, by subjecting<br>
the plastic sheets to a same processing steps, while they are moving in pairs '<br>
through the various work stations of a plant.<br>
For the purposes of this description, "thermoformable plastic sheet" is<br>
understood to mean any plastic material in sheet form, suitable for being shaped<br>
by a thermoforming process; plug assist may also be provided. The plastic<br>
sheets can either be of a single layer of suitable thickness, or layered, that is to<br>
say composed of several layers of plastic material of identical and/or of different<br>
thickness, having chemical and/or physical properties differing from one another.<br>
As shown in figure 1, each processing line 10A, 10B comprises a number<br>
of work stations in which the various processing steps are carried out; in<br>
particular, in a first station 11 A, 11B, a first loading step takes place, by picking<br>
up the individual sheets SA, SB from a pallet.<br>
The individual plastic sheets SA, SB are picked up automatically and fed<br>
into the loading stations 11 A, 11B by means of mechanical and/or pneumatic<br>
gripping devices; then are transferred to a preheating station 12A, 12B where the<br>
plastic sheets remain in a heater for the time necessary to bring them at a first<br>
preheating temperature lower than the thermoforming temperature of the same<br>
sheets. Even though it is preferable to preheat the plastic sheets SA, SB in order<br>
to reduce the working cycle times, the preheating phase may also be omitted.<br>
The preheating temperature for the plastic sheets SA, SB is suitably<br>
controlled, for example, by making the sheets move along a heating path inside<br>
an air convection heater, in which the sheets remain for a heating period<br>
equivalent to several processing cycles, during which the individual sheets are<br>
heated gradually to a desired temperature.<br><br>
Upon completion of the preheating step, each individual sheet SA, SB is<br>
transferred to a subsequent centering station 13A, 13B, where the sheet is<br>
positioned and oriented to be pneumatically picked up, as explained further on.<br>
In the case of figure 1, the centering step 13A, 13B is carried out<br>
downstream, immediately after the preheating; in certain cases, this would imply<br>
having to maintain a comparatively low preheating temperature with respect to<br>
the thermoforming temperature, thereby increasing the final heating time. In<br>
order to obtain better centering conditions for the sheets, the latter may be<br>
preliminarily centred, prior to their introduction into the preheating oven; this<br>
embodiment offers the possibility of increasing the preheating temperature and<br>
consequently reducing the final heating time.<br>
According to the exemplificative diagram of figure 1, after the pre-heated<br>
sheets have been centred in the stations 13A, 13B, the individual sheets are<br>
transferred to a subsequent final heating station 14A, 14B where they are heated<br>
to a temperature close or equivalent to a thermoforming temperature, depending<br>
upon the properties of the plastic material or materials of which each individual<br>
sheet SA, SB is composed.<br>
In this connection, as schematically indicated in figure 1, the individual<br>
sheets SA, SB in the centering stations 13A, 13B are picked up by means of a<br>
suitable pneumatic gripping device 15A and 15B, movable above each<br>
processing line, for example of the type shown in figures 5 and 6.<br>
Figure 5 shows, by way of example, a longitudinal cross-sectional view of<br>
the pneumatically actuate gripping and vacuum holding device 15A; the<br>
pneumatic gripping device 15B is wholly similar to the device 15A.<br>
As shown, the pneumatic gripping and vacuum holding device 15A is<br>
provided by of a bell-shaped device having peripheral walls 21 forming a facing<br>
down vacuum chamber 22; the vacuum chamber 22 is provided with a cone-<br>
shaped upper portion ending with a fitting 23 for connection to an air suction<br>
source 23', necessary for creating a sufficient vacuum degree in the vacuum<br>
chamber 22 for supporting or holding the plastic sheet material SA in a<br>
substantially flat condition; by controlling the suction source 23', it is possible to<br>
control the vacuum degree in the vacuum chamber 22 of the bell-shaped device<br><br>
15A and consequently the flatness of the plastic sheet SA.<br>
The shape and size of the device 15A substantially correspond to those of<br>
the plastic sheets SA, SB to be thermoformed. Consequently, the bell-shaped<br>
device 15A in figures 5 and 6, is provided at the lower edge, with pneumatically<br>
actuable gripping means for gripping the sheet SA around its peripheral edge,<br>
forming an adequate airtight seal.<br>
As shown in figure 5 and in the enlarged detail of figure 6, the pneumatic<br>
gripping means for gripping the sheet SA may comprise a flat peripheral frame<br>
24	secured inside and spaced apart from the lateral walls 21 so as to form a slot<br>
25	connectable in a controlled way to an air suction source 25'.<br>
The pneumatic gripping means for gripping the plastic sheets can<br>
obviously be differently shaped or conformed, compared to those shown.<br>
Lastly, also in figure 5, it can be seen that the bell-shaped device 15A for<br>
gripping and vacuum supporting the sheets SA, SB, is provided with a bank 28 of<br>
heating elements for heating the sheets SA, SB, within the same vacuum<br>
chamber 22.<br>
Picking up and moving each individual preheated sheet SA, SB,<br>
constitutes one of the most delicate steps of the entire process, in that, if the<br>
heated sheets were not properly gripped and supported, due to the gravity they<br>
would tend to sag downwards, and undergo uncontrolled deformation which<br>
would have a negative effect on the subsequent thermoforming of the shells in<br>
the stations 16A, 16B.<br>
Therefore, according to a preferential embodiment of the invention, the<br>
individual sheets SA, SB in the respective centering stations 13A, 13B are picked<br>
up pneumatically in a controlled way at their peripheral edges, and vacuum<br>
supported by means of the bell-shaped devices 15A, 15B of figure 5, maintaining<br>
them in a substantially flat condition while they are being transferred to the<br>
heating stations 14A, 14B. In these stations, the individual sheets SA, SB are<br>
further heated to bring them up to a temperature equivalent or close to the<br>
thermoforming temperature. The heating of the sheets SA and SB in the two<br>
heating stations 14A and 14B may takes place on both sides from below by<br>
means of a bank of heating elements 47 which each station 14A, 14B is provided<br><br>
with, and from above by means of the bank of heating elements 28 inside the<br>
bell-shaped device 15A and 15B.<br>
After the heating step at the thermoforming temperature has been<br>
performed in the stations 16A, 16B, the heated plastic sheets SA, SB are<br>
transferred by means of the devices 15A, 15B to the subsequent stations 16A,<br>
16B to be subjected to the thermoforming into the molds 17A, 17B for shaping<br>
them into corresponding thermoformed shells GA, GB according to the procedure<br>
illustrated further on in figures 2A-2H of the accompanying drawings.<br>
As mentioned previously, the transfer of the heated sheets SA, SB takes<br>
place while supporting them by vacuum in a flat or substantially flat condition, that<br>
is to say, devoid of deep sagging, by means of the bell-shaped devices 15A, 15B<br>
which can therefore be moved rapidly between the various in-line work stations.<br>
In order to maintain a substantial flattened condition of the heated sheets,<br>
preventing the latter from sagging excessively as the heating temperature<br>
gradually increases, the sagging of the sheets is detected and the vacuum<br>
degree created above the heated sheets by the devices 15A, 15B, is constantly<br>
controlled and adjusted so as to prevent an excessive sagging with the risk of the<br>
plastic sheets striking against fixed parts of the plant, preventing or hindering their<br>
correct positioning above the molds 17A, 17B.<br>
As shown in greater detail further on, the essential feature of this invention<br>
resides in thermoforming the plastic sheets SA, SB while maintaining<br>
substantially identical thermoforming conditions for both of them, so as to obtain<br>
two structurally homogeneous thermoformed shells GA, GB.<br>
This can be obtained, according to the invention, by disposing both the<br>
molds 17A, 17B side by side at a same level, with the respective shaping cavities<br>
facing upward.<br>
The side-by-side and upwardly oriented disposition of the two<br>
thermoforming molds, enables the sheets to be also pre-stretched and deposited<br>
on the molds, simply by gravity. This not only simplifies the thermoforming<br>
enormously, making it possible to obtain the desired structural homogeneity of<br>
the two shells GA, GB, but also facilitates the operations of introducing inserts<br><br>
and components into one or both the shaped shells before sealing the tank. In<br>
fact, thanks to the upward oriented disposition of the cavities for both the molds<br>
17A, 17B, it is possible to carry out the introduction of the inserts and/or the<br>
various components, both prior and subsequent to the thermoforming, directly in<br>
each mold or into the thermoformed shells, while the latter still remain in the<br>
respective mold, picking up by an operator the various components from a side<br>
station 18A and 18B, as shown in greater detail in figures 7 and 8.<br>
Upon completion of the thermoforming of the two shells and the<br>
introduction of the various components, as mentioned previously, still in one of<br>
the thermoforming stations a subsequent step may be carried out consisting in<br>
superimposing the two molds 17A, 17B, fusing and sealing the two<br>
thermoformed shells at overlapped sealing areas, as schematically shown by the<br>
block diagram 19 in figure 1.<br>
This can be achieved in any suitably way; for example, by upside down<br>
turning one of the molds onto the other one, by simple rotation around an<br>
horizontal axis, or in any other way capable of allowing the superimposition of the<br>
two molds with the respective thermoforming shells, one turned upside down on<br>
top of the other and with their peripheral sealing area matching.<br>
In this connection, as schematically shown in figures 3 and 4, use can be<br>
made of a book-like press.<br>
The thermoforming press comprises a stationary frame 30 and a movable<br>
frame 31 which can be overturned by 180° around a rotational axis 32 connected<br>
to a drive motor 33, or in any other suitable way.<br>
The stationary frame 30 of the press is in turn provided with a platen 34<br>
for supporting the mold 17B; the platen 34 is vertically movable by means of<br>
hydraulic cylinders 35 for providing the necessary clamping force for closing the<br>
molds 17A, 17B and sealing the overlapped areas of the two shells, in the closed<br>
condition of the molds shown by the block diagram 19 in figure 1.<br>
From figures 3 and 4 it can also be seen that, according to another feature<br>
of the invention, pneumatically actuable sheet gripping means are provided for<br>
each mold 17A, 17B; the gripping means comprises a pneumatic frame 36A, 36B<br>
for gripping the sheets SA, SB from below, around their peripheral edges, on the<br><br>
side opposite to that of the gripping device 24 of the bell-shaped device 14A, 15B<br>
as explained further on. In this connection the pneumatic frames 36A, 36B are<br>
shaped and sized identically to the pneumatic frames 24 of the two bell shaped<br>
devices 15A and 15B. This proves to be extremely advantageous in that it<br>
enables the individual sheets SA, SB to be supported along the two processing<br>
lines 10A, 10B and transferred by the bell shaped devices 15A, 15B above the<br>
shaping molds 17A, 17B, by gripping the sheets themselves along a narrow<br>
peripheral strip. This makes it possible to considerably reduce scraps, and losses<br>
of valuable material, compared to the conveying systems previously used in the<br>
usual thermoforming plants which make use of belts or other similar conveying<br>
systems for the plastic sheets.<br>
Each pneumatic frame 36A, 36B, can be vertically moved upwards, with<br>
respect to the mold 17A, 17B, by means of suitable control cylinders 37A, 37B.<br>
The pneumatic gripping frames 36A and 36B can be shaped with a flat or<br>
variable profile, by providing articulated frame sections, to adapt to molds with<br>
flat or three-dimensional shaped edges; moreover, each frame can be provided<br>
also with mechanical gripping means for securing the edges of the individual<br>
sheets.<br>
Once the two molds 17A, 17B with the corresponding thermoformed shells<br>
have been placed one on top of the other, the peripheral sealing areas of the two<br>
shells are pressed and fused one against the another by sealing edge zones of<br>
the thermoforming molds themselves, thereby fusing and hermetically sealing a<br>
fuel tank.<br>
Upon completion of the thermoforming and sealing of the two shells, it is<br>
necessary to perform a cooling step for cooling the tank, before removing the<br>
same from the molds.<br>
The cooling can be carried out in any suitable way, for example by<br>
circulation of water or a cooling fluid within the mold walls, or by circulation of air<br>
while maintaining the tank under pressurised condition to urge against the<br>
thermoforming molds.<br>
Although the cooling can be carried out directly along the processing line,<br>
in one of the two thermoforming stations 16A, 16B, since the cooling of the<br><br>
molds and the fuel tanks takes a considerable length of time, according to<br>
another feature of this invention it is preferable to carry out the cooling separately<br>
from the processing line; in this connection, the closed molds with the<br>
thermoformed tank are transferred to a cooling station 20, on a side of the<br>
processing lines 10A, 10B. By removing the closed molds and carrying out the<br>
cooling in a side station, separate from the processing lines, it is possible to<br>
operate in a continuous cycle, without causing delays or dead times in the<br>
manufacturing process, which can continue as explained further on. In addition,<br>
by removing the molds from the processing lines and transferring them to a<br>
separate cooling station, it is possible to easily work on the same molds for<br>
maintenance operations and/or for their replacement.<br>
After the fusing and sealing of the two shells, depending on whether the<br>
cooling is to be carried out with the fuel tank under pressurised conditions or not,<br>
the closed molds must be transferred from one of the thermoforming stations to<br>
the cooling station.<br>
In the event the cooling being carried out with the tank under pressurised<br>
conditions, in order to counteract the pressure inside the molds, it is advisable to<br>
close the latter in a special retaining cage, shown in figures 9 and 10 of the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
For example, as shown in figures 9 and 10, the cage may comprises a<br>
lower platen 40 and an upper platen 41 at which are secured the two molds 17A,<br>
17B. The upper platen 41 is articulated to two lateral posts 42 to rotate around<br>
an articulation axes 43 capable to vertically slide along an elongated hole 42'.<br>
The rotational movement of the upper platen 41 is controlled by two hydraulic<br>
cylinders 44, while wedges 45 actuated by hydraulic cylinders 46 enable the<br>
upper platen 41 to be locked to the two lateral posts 42, in the closed condition of<br>
figure 9.<br>
With reference to the diagram of figures 2A-2H, a more detailed<br>
description is given hereunder of the operating method of the twin-sheet<br>
thermoforming plant according to this invention.<br>
The figures from 2A to 2H schematically show the individual operative<br>
steps which are carried out in parallel and in succession in the various work<br><br>
stations along the two processing lines, for example between the centering<br>
station 13A of the line 10A, and the thermoforming station 16A, it being clearly<br>
understood that the same processing steps will be simultaneously carried out in<br>
parallel on the other processing line 10B.<br>
As mentioned initially, the individual plastic sheets SA in the loading<br>
station 11 A, are picked up and introduced into the oven 12A where they are held<br>
for a pre-established period of time, in the region of a few dozen minutes,<br>
depending upon the nature and the properties of the plastic material, making<br>
them undergo a gradual preheating to a first temperature lower than the<br>
thermoforming one.<br>
After completition of the preheating phase, at the outlet of the oven 12A<br>
the preheated sheet SA is transferred to the centering station 13A, for example<br>
by means of a roller table 45 or other conveying system, where an appropriate<br>
centering device 46 (figure 2A) is raised for accurately positioning and orientate<br>
each sheet SA1, to be perfectly aligned with the pneumatic gripping device 15A<br>
which in the meantime has been moved above the centering station 13A.<br>
Upon completion of the centering of the sheet SA1, the latter is<br>
pneumatically gripped around its peripheral edge and raised by means of the<br>
pneumatic gripping device 15A which is supported to move vertically and/or<br>
horizontally in the directions of the double arrows F2 and F3, above the<br>
processing line 10A.<br>
The device 15A for gripping the sheets is conformed and operates for<br>
pneumatically picking up the sheet SA1 and for forming a seal around the<br>
peripheral edge so that above the sheet itself inside the bell 15A it is possible to<br>
create, in a controlled way, a certain vacuum degree capable of holding the<br>
sheet SA1 in a substantially flat condition, as shown.<br>
The pneumatic gripping device 15A with the sheet SA1 can consequently<br>
move from the centering station 13A, to the heating station 14A and the<br>
thermoforming station 15A, as schematically shown in figures 2A, 2B, 2C and 2D<br>
of the accompanying drawings.<br>
In correspondence with the centering station 13A, the pneumatic gripping<br>
device 15A picks up the already centred sheet SA1, holding it pneumatically<br><br>
around the peripheral edge.<br>
Immediately after, the heater 28 is switched on, the bell 15A is connected<br>
to a vacuum source and then, from the centering station 13A the pneumatic<br>
gripping device 15A with the preheated sheet SA1 is moved towards the final<br>
heating station 14A, as shown in figure 2C.<br>
During this step, the plastic sheet material SA1, likewise to the sheet SA2,<br>
is further heated to the required thermoforming temperature, both by the upper<br>
heater 28 of the gripping device 15A, and by a lower heat 47 positioned below in<br>
the same heating station 14A. Since during this heating step the plastic material<br>
of the sheet is brought up to a temperature close to melting point, and would<br>
consequently tend to sag downwards by gravity, the vacuum in the bell of<br>
gripping device 15A is maintained and suitably controlled so as to keep the sheet<br>
SA1 in a substantially flat condition, throughout the entire heating period until it<br>
has been positioned above the thermoforming mold 17A.<br>
In the meantime, several operators have taken care to introduce inserts<br>
into the mold 17A, as schematically shown in figure 2C.<br>
The plastic sheet SA1 is then heated on both sides in a wholly controlled<br>
way. Upon completion of the heating, the gripping device 15A is quickly moved<br>
above the thermoforming mold 17A, as shown in figure 2D.<br>
The gripping and vacuum holding device 15A with the sheet SA1 heated<br>
to the thermoforming temperature, is transferred while maintaining the heating by<br>
means of the heater 28, and the vacuum, for the reasons explained previously.<br>
At this point, by reducing the vacuum, or controlling the pressure within<br>
the gripping and holding device 15A, it is possible to form a sag by gravity, by<br>
making the sheet sag downwards, as shown in figure 2E; simultaneously, the<br>
second gripping device 36A associated with the mold 17A, is raised to grip the<br>
sheet SA1 from below, around the peripheral edge, on the side opposite to that<br>
of the upper gripping frame 24 of the gripping and holding device 15A, as again<br>
shown in figure 2E.<br>
In the meantime, a new preheated sheet SA2 can be transferred to the<br>
centering station 13A.<br>
At this point, the device 15A releases the sheet SA1 which is immediately<br><br>
gripped from below by the second gripping device 36A of the thermoforming<br>
mold 17A; the first gripping and sheet holding device 15A now can be made to<br>
return towards the centering station 13A where it can pick up a second sheet<br>
SA2, as shown in figure 2F.<br>
The same figure 2F shows that the second gripping device 36A which<br>
holds the first sheet SA1 in a sagging condition, is lowered, and stopped at a<br>
distance from the mold 17A, while a shaping plug 49 is made to adhere from the<br>
above to the sag of the sheet SA1.<br>
Both the shaping plug 49 and the gripping device 36A are now lowered<br>
simultaneously bringing the sheet SA1 to rest against the internal surface of the<br>
mold 17A. By activating vacuum in the mold 17A, in a per se known way, the<br>
sheet SA1 is shaped into a corresponding thermoformed shell by the combined<br>
action of the vacuum inside the mold 17A and the pressure of the shaping plug<br>
49.<br>
During the thermoforming of the shell, the peripheral edge of the plastic<br>
sheet SA1 is retained against the peripheral edge of the mold 17B, for example<br>
by means of a presser 48, or in any other suitable way, as shown in figure 2G.<br>
Upon completion of the thermoforming of the shell, when the plastic<br>
material is still at a high temperature, the plug 49 is raised to allow the<br>
introduction of any further inserts or components into the thermoformed shell. All<br>
this can be carried out quickly and easily through the upward facing of the molds,<br>
thereby greatly simplifying all the operations on both processing lines.<br>
As mentioned previously, all the operations described with reference to<br>
the figures from 2A to 2H, are carried out simultaneously and cyclically on two<br>
plastic sheets SA1, SB1 along the two processing lines 10A and 10B.<br>
Consequently, in both cases, the thermoforming of the two shells takes place in a<br>
substantially identical way, with both the molds facing upwards; moreover, in<br>
both cases, vacuum and gravity are appropriately used for controlling the<br>
formation of the sag in each of the two sheets SA1, SB1.<br>
It is now necessary to seal the two shells to form a fuel tank; in this<br>
connection, the hermetical sealing of the two thermoformed sheets SA1 and SB1<br>
is carried out by tightly pressing and fusing their sealing areas one against the<br><br>
other around the peripheral edges of the two shells.<br>
This can be achieved, for example, by overturning one of the two molds<br>
by 180°, for example by making the mold 17B rotate in the direction of the arrow<br>
F1 in figure 4, around the rotational axis 32, upside down the other mold 16A, as<br>
shown by the block diagram 19 in figure 1.<br>
At this point, the two molds are tightly pressed one against the other,<br>
exerting an adequate clamping force, and pinching the two sealing areas of the<br>
two shells thereby fusing them hermetically together.<br>
After having completed a fuel tank, the latter can be cooled while<br>
maintaining it closed in the two molds. Upon completion of the cooling, the two<br>
molds, still closed, can be moved back to one of the two thermoforming stations<br>
17A, 17B and opened to carry out the demolding and discharge of the finished<br>
fuel tank, directly in the same thermoforming station.<br>
All this can be carried out within an extremely short period of time, during<br>
the execution of a subsequent operative cycle, so as to use the same molds<br>
again for manufacturing a next fuel tank.<br>
Therefore, by operating in a continuous cycle with the two processing<br>
lines 10A and 10B, according to the previously described procedures, it is<br>
possible to produce plastic fuel tanks, complete with the respective accessories<br>
and components, in an extremely limited time, reducing the scraps of material<br>
due to the combined use of the two pneumatic gripping and conveying devices<br>
along the two processing lines, makes it possible to form sealing having<br>
extremely limited surfaces; according to the invention it is also possible to<br>
produce plastic fuel tanks complete with their respective accessories having<br>
improved structural characteristics.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 show, by way of example, two possible solutions with<br>
regard to the cooling station, in addition to other details of the thermoforming<br>
stations and the stations for introducing the inserts and/or components into the<br>
molds and/or into the two thermoformed shells; in said figures, the same<br>
reference numbers used as per the previous figures, to indicate similar or<br>
equivalent parts.<br>
As shown in figure 7, the cooling station 20 comprises a rotary table 50<br><br>
having two or more molds supporting surfaces 51, 52, onto which the closed<br>
molds 17A, 17B are transferred for the cooling phase.<br>
The rotary table 50 is made to rotate and indexed by a motor 53 in order<br>
to align from time to time one of the mold supporting surfaces 51, 52, with the<br>
thermoforming station, to allow the transfer of the closed molds, for example,<br>
between the thermoforming station 16B and the surface 51, while another closed<br>
molds undergoing cooling is already disposed on the surface 52 or on the other<br>
surfaces of the rotary table. Figure 7 schematically indicates various robots or<br>
operators for the movement of the shaping plug 49, or for picking up and<br>
automatically introduce the inserts into the molds, or for discharging the finished<br>
fuel tanks.<br>
The example of figure 8 differs from the previous figure in that the cooling<br>
station 20 now comprises a shuttle 54 reciprocable along a guide 55, which<br>
extends on a side parallel to the processing line 16B. The shuttle 54 is provided<br>
with two mold supporting surfaces 56, 57 which can be aligned with the<br>
thermoforming station 16B, by appropriately moving the shuttle along the guide<br>
55.<br>
In both cases, the mold supporting surfaces 51, 52 of the rotary table 50,<br>
or the mold supporting surfaces 56, 57 of the shuttle 55, can be used for carrying<br>
out the replacement of the molds, at each change of production, or for other<br>
requirements.<br>
It is understood that what has been described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, has been given purely by way of example in order to<br>
illustrate the general features of the method and the plant according to this<br>
invention; therefore, other modifications or variations may be made, without<br>
thereby deviating from the scopes of the claims.<br><br>

15B), for supporting the heated sheets (SA, SB) in a substantially flat condition while they<br>
are moved towards a respective thermoforming station (16A, 16B). Both the molds (17A,<br>
17B) are disposed side by side with their open cavity facing upwards. After<br>
thermoforming of the plastic sheets (SA, SB), one of the molds (17B) is turned upside<br>
down onto the other mold (17A), to overlap and weld superimposed sealing areas of the<br>
two thermoformed shells (GA, GB). Cooling of the molds and thermoformed tank may be<br>
performed on a side of the processing lines (10A, 10B).</td>
