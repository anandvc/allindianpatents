				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>A microprocessor system having an interrupt controller is provided for use in a mobile communications device. Peripheral processing units generate interrupt requests for sending to the microprocessor. The microprocessor has components for responding to interrupt requests by interrupting current processing and performing an interrupt service routine associated with the interrupt request. The interrupt controller receives interrupt requests directed to the microprocessor from the peripheral processing units and for prioritizes the interrupt requests on behalf of the microprocessor. By providing an interrupt controller for prioritizing interrupt request on behalf of the microprocessor, the microprocessor therefore need not devote significant internal resources to prioritizing the interrupt request signals.</td>

MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICE HAVING A PRIORITIZED INTERRUPT CONTROLLER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br><br><br><br>
and debugging the hardware or software may add to the overall cost of the wireless<br><br><br>
Hence, either overall system efficiency or overall power consumption of the wireless eleph one suffers.<br><br><br>
significant   inxmal   resources   to   prioritizing   the   interrupt   request   signals.<br><br><br>
not, retrieves an interrupt request, if any, stored at the top of the interrupt stack and<br><br><br>
reques to the microprocessor in such a manner to minimize the number of jump<br><br><br>
requests within a microprocessor connected to the interrput controller of FIG, 4,<br><br><br>
configured as a smart phone to provide PDA functions as well as wireless telephone<br><br><br>
via system bus 106.<br><br><br>
need 1:0 power up in response to every interrupt request, regardless of the priority of<br><br><br>
prioritizing interrupt  requests  on  behalf of the   microprocessor  and  pertinent<br><br><br>
up operation of the microprocessor, then the selected interrupt request, and all other<br><br><br>
internal memory, or vice versa. As another example, the interrupt request may require<br><br><br>
forwards an IRQ to the microprocessor.   In response, the microprocessor saves the<br><br><br>
one new interrupt request is received, the interrupt requests of lesser priority are<br><br><br>
interrupt request associated with the new IRQ signal before processing the interrupt<br><br><br>
has a higher priority than the interrupt request already being processed.  If so, then<br><br><br>
request. If no interrupt requests arc remaining in the interrupt stack at step 234, then<br><br><br>
request is to be forwarded to the microprocessor, the selected interrupt request is<br><br><br>
independent synchroncus reset when a ISR is fully serviced by the controller or an<br><br><br>
pencing interrupt.    For example, the pointer points to subsystem No. 0 after<br><br><br>
When there is an ISR which has a higher priority level that the highest level in the<br><br>
IN-SERVICE stack register, a irq-int signal is asserted. In FIG. 6, the irq-int signal<br><br><br><br><br><br>
and jumps to the next lowest pending ISR, a level 3 ISR, and services it. During the<br><br><br>
priority level 4 ISR is fully serviced thereby nesting the 1ST in the microprocessor.<br><br><br>
