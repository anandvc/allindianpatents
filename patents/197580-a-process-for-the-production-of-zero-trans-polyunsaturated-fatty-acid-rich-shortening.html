				<td>This invention relates to a  process for the production of zero-trans shortening using palm stearin as a base.<br>
Shortenings are plastic fats consisting of a.mixture of solid fat crystals and liquid oil . The solid fat components form a three-dimensional crystal matrix that holds the liquid portion of fat and imparts plasticity and rigidity to the system. Satisfactory performance of shortening depends mainly on consistency and crystal structure. The consistency depends on the solid to liquid ratio present at different temperatures. Shortenings are commonly used in the baking industry to impart desirable texture and mouthfeel to the products. Shortenings manufactured for the bakery industry vary dramatically with respect to consistency and melting characteristics,depending upon the application for which they are designed. Currently, hydrogenated fats consisting of large amount (as high as 20-40%) of trans- fatty acids are being used in the baking industry. Although the nutritional significance of trans-fatty acids is controversial,they may cause heart disease according to recent findings. In a comprehensive review it has been concluded that trans-fatty acids consumed at 4% or more of total calories may raise plasma lipid levels. It has been reported that trans-fatty acids have a negative impact on plasma lipo - protein profile by lowering the content of high-density lipo- protein cholesterol. This has raised the need to replace hydrogenated fats with natural fats in food product formulations. Interest has grown, therefore.on production of fat products that will simulate hydrogenated fat products but will not contain trans-fatty acids. There are two distinct methodologies for making zero-trans shortenings, namely interesterification and simple physical blending of oils and fats, followed b -ontrolled crystallization.<br>
A reported US patent [US 6033703(2000)US 082177(19930624)] describes a method for producing plastic shortening with reduced levels of saturates and trans fatty acids useful for confectionary, frying and bakery applications. They used an inert gas and fat made from a base oil. The shortening also contained added antioxidants, emulsifier and additional ingredients. This product contained  1 monoglyceride and/or diglyceride, or can be a fraction which is normally solid at room temperature and or which is enriched with diglyceride. In this process glycerolysis of a saturated fat or oil; and stearin fraction is enriched with diglyceride or monoglyceride which requires additional unit steps. In the present process these steps are avoided by blending of palm stearin with an unsaturated oil in the proper proportion, to result in a zero-trans shortening with quality attributes matching with specifications. Reports on shortening and margarine production based on chemical interesterification and enzyme catalysed interesterification or partial hydrogenation are available. These methods make use of interesterification or partial hydrogenation which<br>
generates either trans-fatty acids formation or alters natural distribution of fatty acids through randomisation which again has nutritional consequences besides being costly process . The present process is cost effective as it avoids hydrogenation and interesterification. At present, palm stearin is used mostly for the production of soap whereas in this process value addition is achieved.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the production of nutritionally superior zero-trans shortening.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a method for the production of polyunsaturated rich zero-trans shortening.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a method for the production of granular,crystalline zero-trans shortening with maximum ß1 polymorphic form which favours good textural properties.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a method for the production of zero-trans shortening conforming to specificational requirements such as melting point, FFA,moisture,Iodine value etc.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the production of zero-trans polyunsaturated fatty acid rich shortening which comprises heating a mixture of palm stearin and rice bran oil in a ratio of 65:35 to 35:65 at a temperature ranging between 50-80° C to make a homogeneous blend, cooling the resultant blend by passing through the margarine crystallizer at a feed rate of 8- 15 Kg/hr, filling of the product at a temperature ranging between 20- 35° C and followed by tempering of the product at a temperature ranging between 25-3 5°C for 3-10 days to attain requisite textural properties in the final product. In an embodiment of the invention the required homogenity may be attained by heating the palm stearin to 40-60°C , then adding rice bran oil in the proper proportion to the melted palm stearin, and heating the blend to a temperature of 50-80°C.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the resultant blend may be fed into the margarine<br>
crystallizer with a feed rate of 10-12 Kg/hr.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention wherein the blend fed into the margarine<br>
crystallizer is cooled to a temperature of 20-3 5°C<br>
In still another embodiment of the invention the refrigerant temperature may be adjusted to<br>
15-25°C.<br>
In further embodiment of the invention   the back pressure in the scraped surface heat<br>
exchanger(mutator) is adjusted to 5-10 bar.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention    the blended mass may be crystallized in the<br>
mutator at a mutator speed of 150-250 rpm<br>
In still another embodiment of the invention the product coming out of the mutator may be<br>
subjected to beating in the pin worker at a speed of 50-150 rpm.<br>
In yet still another embodiment of the invention   wherein the product collected from the<br>
margarine crystallizer under specified temperature of 20-3 5° C and tubbed.<br>
In one of the embodiment of the invention wherein the filled product may be tempered at 25-<br>
35° C for 3-10 days to get a plastic shortening with a requisite granular structure which fall<br>
within the limits of specificational requirements.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention wherein the polyunsaturated fatty acid rich<br>
zero-  trans   shortening  meets  the  specificational  requirements  such  as  slip  melting<br>
point, free fatty acids(FFA), moisture, unsaponifiable matter and iodine value.<br>
The   process for   the production of zero-trans shortening   which involves utilisation of<br>
crystalline palm stearin with maximum ß1 polymorphic form,obtained as a by product in the<br>
production of Red palm olein, blending of this palm stearin with an unsaturated liquid oil viz<br>
refined rice bran oil in a ratio of 65:35 to 35:65, cooling of the resultant blend through a<br>
margraine crystallizer ( Armfield, FT25B, margraine crystalliser) under controlled conditions.<br>
The following procedure has been developed for the production of palm stearin based zero-trans shortening.<br>
The process for the production of palm stearin which is a byproduct of red palm olein production is as follows. Crude palm oil is fed into a Neutraliser/Washer [Armfield FT66 Neutralised Washer/Bleacher] by means of vacuum and heated to 70-80°c under vacuum. Calculated amount of alkali sufficient to neutralise the FFA [80-100gms] is dissolved in water to give a 15° Be solution which is heated to 70-80° C. The hot alkali is fed into the reactor and the reaction is carried out with slow stirring for 15 mints. The soap formed is allowed to settle by cooling the contents of the vessel to 48-65° C under vacuum. The soap is separated after 5 hrs and the remaining oil is washed with hot water till free of alkali. The neutralised palm oil is admitted to the winterization unit and heated to 60-70° C by means of steam through the jacket, the rate of which can be controlled by PID controller, cooled to 18-28° C at the rate of 10-20° C per hour by means of chilled water through the jacket with a pre-programmed PID controller under controlled stirring. The crystallized mass is taken out and filtered by means of a rotary drum vaccum filter. By this method palm stearin in the most desirable p' polymorphic form is obtained. The yield of palm stearin is 30%.The palm stearin thus obtained is melted to 40-60° C and blended with rice bran oil in a ratio of 65:35 to 35:65 and the whole mixture is brought to 50 - 80° C and made into a homogeneous blend. The resultant homogeneous blend at 50-80°C is cooled by passing through the margarine crystallizer (scraped surface heat exchanger) to a temperature of 20-30°C under controlled conditions of refrigerant temperature, feed rate, back pressure, mutator speed, pin worker speed and filling temperature.The crystalline semi-solid zero-trans shortening is tubbed and tempered for 3-10 days at 25-35°C.<br>
An important criterion in the manufacture of shortening is to obtain a granular crystalline structure and a minimum free oil phase at room temperature.The crystalline form of the fat /oil blend is very important.The primary forms are ,ß ' and ß.The p' is the most desirable form<br>
because it provides a fine arrangement  and large surface area of solid crystals. (3' crystalline formation can be monitored by X-ray diffraction technique,standardization of this was carried out by following Bragg's equation which states that   : n=2dsin where<br>
n= an integer indicating order of the spectra. = wave length<br>
d= short spacing (crystal lattice spacing of one set of planes) = The angle of incidence upon this set of planes<br>
The primary purpose of tempering is to condition the solidified shortening so that it will withstand wide temperature variations in subsequent storage and to have a uniform consistency. The physico-chemical characteristics of zero-trans shortening and commercial samples available in the market are given in Table . 1.<br>

(Table Removed)The following examples are given by way of illustration  but should not be constructed to limit the scope of the present invention. Example 1<br>
10 kgs of palm stearin,rice bran oil mixture (1:1) blend is heated to 70°C and stirred well for 10 minutes to destroy presence of any crystal inorder to induce crystallization in a controlled manner during subsequent cooling. Refrigerant temperature of the margarine crystallizer is adjusted to 25°C,so that the equilibrium temperature of the product attained at the inlet barrel of the mutator is 50°C. 9.6 kgs of the homogeneous melted blend at 70°C is fed into the margarine crystallizer with a feed rate of 10 kg/hr and enters the scraped surface heat exchanger (mutator). The pressure inside the mutator is adjusted to 8 bar where the material crystallizes to the required level at 29°C . The speed of the mutator is adjusted to 200rpm. The output of the heat exchanger at a temperature of 29°C is allowed to enter into the pinworker to get a uniform distribution of the crystals formed. The pinworker movement is fixed to 50 rpm. The material coming out of the pinworker at a temperature of 29.8°C is passed through a resting tube and 8.9kgs of the product is collected and tubbed at this temperature and kept for tempering at 30°C for 5 days. Example 2<br>
8kgs of palm stearin,rice bran oil (1:1) blend is heated to 70°C and stirred well for 10 mints. Refrigerant temperature of the margarine crystallizer is adjusted to 20°C. 7.8kgs of the homogeneous melted blend at 70°C is fed into the margarine crystallizer with a feed rate of<br>
l0kg/hr and enters the scraped surface heat exchanger (mutator). The pressure inside the mutator is adjusted to 8 bar where the material crystallizes to the required level at 27.7°C. The speed of the mutator is adjusted to 200rpm. The output of the heat exchanger at a temperature of 27.7°C is allowed to enter into the pinworker to get a uniform distribution of the crystals formed. The pinworker movement is kept at 100 rpm. The material coming out of the pinworker at a temperature of 28.2°C is passed through a resting tube and 7.5kgs of the product is collected and tubbed at this temperature and kept for tempering at 31°C for 7 days. Example 3 9kgs of palm stearin.rice bran oil blend (1:1) is heated to 65°C and stirred well for<br>
10 minutes.Refrigerant temperature of the margarine crystallizer is adjusted to 25°C. 8kgs of the homogeneous melted blend at 65°C is fed into the margarine crystallizer with a feed rate of 10 kg/hr and enters the scraped surface heat exchanger (mutator). The pressure inside the mutator is adjusted to7 bar where the material crystallizes to the required level at 27.4°C. The speed of the mutator is adjusted to 250 rpm. The output of the heat exchanger at a temperature of 27.4°C is allowed to enter into the pinworker to get a uniform distribution of the crystals formed. The pinworker movement is fixed at 150 rpm. The material coming out of the pinworker at a temperature of 29.8°C is passed through a resting tube and 7.7kgs of the product is collected and tubbed at this temperature and kept for tempering at 31°C for 6 days.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention;<br>
1)	The novel process is cost effective for producing polyunsaturated fatty acid rich<br>
zero-trans shortening.<br>
2)	Required homogeneous blend is obtained by melting the palm stearin to 40-60°C and then<br>
mixing of the rice bran oil with this melted palm stearin and heating to 50-80°C. The palm<br><br>
stearin: rice bran oil composition is so adjusted in the blend so that specificational requirement of slip melting point(31-41°C)can be attained. By this method formation of trans fatty acids can be prevented. The blending process does not require any of the accepted processes such as interesterification and partial hydrogenation which may induce undesirable product. Blending of palm stearin with rice bran oil is highly beneficial in this process since rice bran oil contributes high ployunsaturated content in the final product which is highly beneficial for the nutritional point of view.<br>
3)	By cooling through the margarine crystallizer   the important criteria of maximum ß1<br>
crystalline formation is monitored under controlled conditions of refrigerant temperature,<br>
feed rate, back pressure, mutator speed and pinworker speed. Under these controlled<br>
conditions the product output, achieved the required granular crystalline structure.<br>
4)	In the present process the requisite qualities of shortening such as smoothness, good<br>
plasticity, granular (ß1 polymorphic form) structure, uniform consistency and conditioning of<br>
the solidified shortening are attained by filling the product at 20-35°C from the margarine<br>
crystallizer under controlled conditions and then tempering of the product at 25-3 5°C for<br>
3-10 days.<br>
