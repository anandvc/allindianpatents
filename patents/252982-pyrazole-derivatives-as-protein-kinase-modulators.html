				<td>This invention relates to pyrazole-containing aryl- and heteroaryl-alkylamine compounds that inhibit or modulate the activity of protein kinase B (PKB) and protein kinase A (PKA), to the use of the compounds in the treatment or prophylaxis of disease states or conditions mediated by PKB and PKA, and to novel compounds having PKB and PKA inhibitory or modulating activity. Also provided are pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds and novel chemical intermediates.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Protein kinases constitute a large family of structurally related enzymes that are responsible for the control of a wide variety of signal transduction processes within the cell (Hardie, G. and Hanks, S. (1995) The Protein Kinase Facts Book. I and II, Academic Press, San Diego, CA). The kinases may be categorized into families by the substrates they phosphorylate (e.g., protein- tyrosine, protein-serine/threonine, lipids, etc.). Sequence motifs have been identified that generally correspond to each of these kinase families (e.g., Hanks, S.K., Hur.ter, T., FASEBJ., 9:576-596 (1995); Knighton, et al, Science, 253:407-414 (1991); Hiles, et al, Cell, 70:419-429 (1992); Kunz, et al., Cell, 73:585-596 (1993); Garcia-Bustos, et al, EMBOJ., 13:2352-2361 (1994)).<br>
Protein kinases may be characterized by their regulation mechanisms. These mechanisms include, for example, autophosphorylation, transphosphorylation by other kinases, protein-protein interactions, protein-lipid interactions, and protein-polynucleotide interactions. An individual protein kinase may be regulated by more than one mechanism.<br>
Kinases regulate many different cell processes including, but not limited to, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, motility, transcription, translation and other signalling processes, by adding phosphate groups to target proteins. These phosphorylation events act as molecular on/off switches that can modulate or<br>
regulate the target protein biological function. Phosphorylation of target proteins<br>
occurs in response to a variety of extracellular signals (hormones,<br>
neurotransmitters, growth and differentiation factors, etc.), cell cycle events,<br>
environmental or nutritional stresses, etc. The appropriate protein kinase functions<br>
in signalling pathways to activate or inactivate (either directly or indirectly), for<br>
example, a metabolic enzyme, regulatory protein, receptor, cytoskeletal protein, ion<br>
channel or pump, or transcription factor. Uncontrolled signalling due to defective<br>
control of protein phosphorylation has been implicated in a number of diseases,<br>
including, for example, inflammation, cancer, allergy/asthma, diseases and<br>
conditions of the immune system, diseases and conditions of the central nervous<br>
system, and angiogenesis.<br>
Apoptosis or programmed cell death is an important physiological process which<br>
removes cells no longer required by an organism. The process is important in early<br>
embryonic growth and development allowing the non-necrotic controlled<br>
breakdown, removal and recovery of cellular components. The removal of cells by<br>
apoptosis is also important in the maintenance of chromosomal and genomic<br>
integrity of growing cell populations. There are several known checkpoints in the<br>
cell growth cycle at which DNA damage and genomic integrity are carefully<br>
monitored. The response to the detection of anomalies at such checkpoints is to<br>
arrest the growth of such cells and initiate repair processes. If the damage or<br>
anomalies cannot be repaired then apoptosis is initiated by the damaged cell in<br>
order to prevent the propagation of faults and errors. Cancerous cells consistently<br>
contain numerous mutations, errors or rearrangements in their chromosomal DNA.<br>
It is widely believed that this occurs in part because the majority of tumours have a<br>
defect in one or more of the processes responsible for initiation of the apoptotic<br>
process. Normal control mechanisms cannot kill the cancerous cells and the<br>
chromosomal or DNA coding errors continue to be propagated. As a consequence<br>
restoring these pro-apoptotic signals or suppressing unregulated survival signals is<br>
an attractive means of treating cancer.<br>
The signal transduction pathway containing the enzymes phosphatidylinositol 3-<br>
kinase (PI3K), PDK1 and PKB amongst others, has long been known to mediate<br>
increased resistance to apoptosis or survival responses in many cells. There is a<br>
substantial amount of data to indicate that this pathway is an important survival<br>
pathway used by many growth factors to suppress apoptosis. The enzyme PI3K is<br>
activated by a range of growth and survival factors e.g. EGF, PDGF and through<br>
the generation of polyphosphatidylinositols, initiates the activation of the<br>
downstream signalling events including the activity of the kinases PDK1 and<br>
protein kinase B (PKB) also known as Akt. This is also true in host tissues, e.g.<br>
vascular endothelial cells as well as neoplasias. PKB is a protein ser/thr kinase<br>
consisting of a kinase domain together with an N-terminal PH domain and Cterminal<br>
regulatory domain. The enzyme PKB itself is phosphorylated on Thr 308<br>
by PDK1 and on Ser 473 by an as yet unidentified kinase. Full activation requires<br>
phosphorylation at both sites whilst association between PIPS and the PH domain is<br>
required for anchoring of the enzyme to the cytoplasmic face of the lipid membrane<br>
providing optimal access to substrates.<br>
Activated PKB in turn phosphorylates a range of substrates contributing to the<br>
overall survival response. Whilst we cannot be certain that we understand all of the<br>
factors responsible for mediating the PKB dependent survival response, some<br>
important actions are believed to be phosphorylation and inactivation of the proapoptotic<br>
factor BAD and caspase 9, phosphorylation of Forkhead transcription<br>
factors e.g. FKHR leading to their exclusion from the nucleus, and activation of the<br>
NfkappaB pathway by phosphorylation of upstream kinases in the cascade.<br>
In addition to the anti-apoptotic and pro-survival actions of the PKB pathway, the<br>
enzyme also plays an important role in promoting cell proliferation. This action is<br>
again likely to be mediated via several actions, some of which are thought to be<br>
phosphorylation and inactivation of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor of<br>
p21Cipl/WAF1, and phosphorylation and activation of mTOR, a kinase controlling<br>
several aspects of cell growth.<br>
The phosphatase PTEN which dephosphorylates and inactivates polyphosphatidylinositols<br>
is a key tumour suppressor protein which normally acts to regulate the<br>
PI3K/PKB survival pathway. The significance of the PI3K/PKB pathway in<br>
tumourigenesis can be judged from the observation that PTEN is one of the most<br>
common targets of mutation in human tumours, with mutations in this phosphatase<br>
having been found in ~50% or more of melanomas (Guldberg et al 1997, Cancer<br>
Research 57,3660-3663) and advanced prostate cancers (Cairns et al 1997 Cancer<br>
Research 57, 4997). These observations and others suggest that a wide range of<br>
tumour types are dependent on the enhanced PKB activity for growth and survival<br>
and would respond therapeutically to appropriate inhibitors of PKB.<br>
There are 3 closely related isoforms of PKB called alpha, beta and gamma, which<br>
genetic studies suggest have distinct but overlapping functions. Evidence suggests<br>
that they can all independently play a role in cancer. For example PKB beta has<br>
been found to be over-expressed or activated in 10 - 40% of ovarian and pancreatic<br>
cancers (Bellacosa et al 1995, Int. J. Cancer 64,280 - 285; Cheng et al 1996, PNAS<br>
93,3636-3641; Yuan et al 2000, Oncogene 19,2324 - 2330), PKB alpha is<br>
amplified in human gastric, prostate and breast cancer (Staal 1987, PNAS 84,5034<br>
- 5037; Sun et al 2001, Am. J. Pathol. 159, 431 -437) and increased PKB gamma<br>
activity has been observed in steroid independent breast and prostate cell lines<br>
(Nakatani et al 1999, J. Biol. Chem. 274,21528 - 21532).<br>
The PKB pathway also functions in the growth and survival of normal tissues and<br>
may be regulated during normal physiology to control cell and tissue function.<br>
Thus disorders associated with undesirable proliferation and survival of normal<br>
cells and tissues may also benefit therapeutically from treatment with a PKB<br>
inhibitor. Examples of such disorders are disorders of immune cells associated with<br>
prolonged expansion and survival of cell population leading to a prolonged or up<br>
regulated immune response. For example, T and B lymphocyte response to cognate<br>
antigens or growth factors such as interleukin-2 activates the PI3K/PKB pathway<br>
and is responsible for maintaining the survival of the antigen specific lymphocyte<br>
clones during the immune response. Under conditions in which lymphocytes and<br>
other immune cells are responding to inappropriate self or foreign antigens, or in<br>
which other abnormalities lead to prolonged activation, the PKB pathway<br>
contributes an important survival signal preventing the normal mechanisms by<br>
which the immune response is terminated via apoptosis of the activated cell<br>
population. There is a considerable amount of evidence demonstrating the<br>
expansion of lymphocyte populations responding to self antigens in autoimmune<br>
conditions such as multiple sclerosis and arthritis. Expansion of lymphocyte<br>
populations responding inappropriately to foreign antigens is a feature of another<br>
set of conditions such as allergic responses and asthma. In summary inhibition of<br>
PKB could provide a beneficial treatment for immune disorders.<br>
Other examples of inappropriate expansion, growth, proliferation, hyperplasia and<br>
survival of normal cells in which PKB may play a role include but are not limited to<br>
atherosclerosis, cardiac myopathy and glomerulonephritis.<br>
In addition to the role in cell growth and survival, the PKB pathway functions in the<br>
control of glucose metabolism by insulin. Available evidence from mice deficient<br>
hi the alpha and beta isoforms of PKB suggests that this action is mediated by the<br>
beta isoform. As a consequence, modulators of PKB activity may also find utility in<br>
diseases in which there is a dysfunction of glucose metabolism and energy storage<br>
such as diabetes, metabolic disease and obesity.<br>
Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is a serine/threonine protein kinase<br>
that phosphorylates a wide range of substrates and is involved in the regulation of<br>
many cellular processes including cell growth, cell differentiation, ion-channel<br>
conductivity, gene transcription and synaptic release of neurotransmitters. In its<br>
inactive form, the PKA holoenzyme is a tetramer comprising two regulatory<br>
subunits and two catalytic subunits.<br>
PKA acts as a link between G-protein mediated signal transduction events and the<br>
cellular processes that they regulate. Binding of a hormone ligand such as glucagon<br>
to a transmembrane receptor activates a receptor-coupled G-protein (GTP-binding<br>
and hydrolyzing protein). Upon activation, the alpha subunit of the G protein<br>
dissociates and binds to and activates adenylate cyclase, which in turn converts<br>
ATP to cyclic-AMP (cAMP). The cAMP thus produced then binds to the regulatory<br>
subunits of PKA leading to dissociation of the associated catalytic subunits. The<br>
catalytic subunits of PKA, which are inactive when associated with the regulatory<br>
sub-units, become active upon dissociation and take part in the phosphorylation of<br>
other regulatory proteins.<br>
For example, the catalytic sub-unit of PKA phosphorylates the kinase<br>
Phosphorylase Kinase which is involved in the phosphorylation of Phosphorylase,<br>
the enzyme responsible for breaking down glycogen to release glucose. PKA is<br>
also involved hi the regulation of glucose levels by phosphorylating and<br>
deactivating glycogen synthase. Thus, modulators of PKA activity (which<br>
modulators may increase or decrease PKA activity) may be useful in the treatment<br>
or management of diseases in which there is a dysfunction of glucose metabolism<br>
and energy storage such as diabetes, metabolic disease and obesity.<br>
PKA has also been established as an acute inhibitor of T cell activation. Anndahl et<br>
al, have investigated the possible role of PKA type I in HIV-induced T cell<br>
dysfunction on the basis that T cells from HIV-infected patients have increased<br>
levels of cAMP and are more sensitive to inhibition by cAMP analogues than are<br>
normal T cells. From their studies, they concluded that increased activation of PKA<br>
type I may contribute to progressive T cell dysfunction in HIV infection and that<br>
PKA type I may therefore be a potential target for immunomodulating therapy. -<br>

V., Tasken, K. Protein kinase A type I antagonist restores immune responses ofT<br>
cells from HIV-infected patients. FASEBJ. 12, 855-862 (1998).<br>
It has also been recognised that mutations in the regulatory sub-unit of PKA can<br>
lead to hyperactivation in endocrine tissue.<br>
Because of the diversity and importance of PKA as a messenger hi cell regulation,<br>
abnormal responses of cAMP can lead to a variety of human diseases such as<br>
irregular cell growth and proliferation (Stratakis, C.A.; Cho-Chung, Y.S.; Protein<br>
Kinase A and human diseases. Trends Endrocri. Metab. 2002,13,50-52). Overexpression<br>
of PKA has been observed in a variety of human cancer cells including<br>
those from ovarian, breast and colon patients. Inhibition of PKA would therefore<br>
be an approach to treatment of cancer (Li, Q.; Zhu, G-D.; Current Topics in<br>
Medicinal Chemistry, 2002,2,939-971).<br>

A and Human Disease, Edited by Constantine A. Stratakis, Annals of the New York<br>
Academy of Sciences, Volume 968,2002, ISBN 1-57331-412-9.<br>
Several classes of compounds have been disclosed as having PKA and PKB<br>
inhibitory activity.<br>

inhibitory activity is disclosed in WO 01/91754 (Yissum).<br>

General Preferences and Definitions<br>
The following general preferences and definitions shall apply to each of the<br>
moieties A, E and R1 to R5 and R9 and any sub-definition, sub-group or embodiment<br>
thereof, unless the context indicates otherwise.<br>
Any references to Formula (I) herein shall be taken also to refer to formulae (la),<br>
(Ib), (H), (III), (IV), (V) and any other sub-group of compounds within formula (I)<br>
unless the context requires otherwise.<br>
References to "carbocyclic" and "heterocyclic" groups as used herein shall, unless<br>
the context indicates otherwise, include both aromatic and non-aromatic ring<br>
systems, hi general, such groups may be monocyclic or bicyclic and may contain,<br>
for example, 3 to 12 ring members, more usually 5 to 10 ring members. Examples<br>
of monocyclic groups are groups containing 3,4,5,6,7, and 8 ring members, more<br>
usually 3 to 7, and preferably 5 or 6 ring members. Examples of bicyclic groups are<br>
those containing 8,9,10,11 and 12 ring members, and more usually 9 or 10 ring<br>
members.<br>
The carbocyclic or heterocyclic groups can be aryl or heteroaryl groups having<br>
from 5 to 12 ring members, more usually from 5 to 10 ring members. The term<br>
"aryl" as used herein refers to a carbocyclic group having aromatic character and<br>
the term "heteroaryl" is used herein to denote a heterocyclic group having aromatic<br>
character. The terms "aryl" and "heteroaryl" embrace polycyclic (e.g. bicyclic) ring<br>
systems wherein one or more rings are non-aromatic, provided that at least one ring<br>
is aromatic. In such polycyclic systems, the group may be attached by the aromatic<br>
ring, or by a non-aromatic ring. The aryl or heteroaryl groups can be monocyclic or<br>
bicyclic groups and can be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more<br>
substituents, for example one or more groups R10 as defined herein.<br>
The term non-aromatic group embraces unsaturated ring systems without aromatic<br>
character, partially saturated and fully saturated carbocyclic and heterocyclic ring<br>
systems. The terms "unsaturated" and "partially saturated" refer to rings wherein<br>
the ring structure(s) contains atoms sharing more than one valence bond i.e. the ring<br>
contains at least one multiple bond e.g. a C=C, CsC or N=C bond. The term "fully<br>
saturated" refers to rings where there are no multiple bonds between ring atoms.<br>
Saturated carbocyclic groups include cycloalkyl groups as defined below. Partially<br>
saturated carbocyclic groups include cycloalkenyl groups as defined below, for<br>
example cyclopentenyl, cycloheptenyl and cyclooctenyl.<br>
Examples of heteroaryl groups are monocyclic and bicyclic groups containing from<br>
five to twelve ring members, and more usually from five to ten ring members. The<br>
heteroaryl group can be, for example, a five membered or six membered<br>
monocyclic ring or a bicyclic structure formed from fused five and six membered<br>
rings or two fused six membered rings. Each ring may contain up to about four<br>
heteroatoms typically selected from nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen. Typically the<br>
heteroaryl ring will contain up to 3 heteroatoms, more usually up to 2, for example<br>
a single heteroatom. In one embodiment, the heteroaryl ring contains at least one<br>
ring nitrogen atom. The nitrogen atoms in the heteroaryl rings can be basic, as in<br>
the case of an imidazole or pyridine, or essentially non-basic as in the case of an<br>
indole or pyrrole nitrogen. In general the number of basic nitrogen atoms present in<br>
the heteroaryl group, including any amino group substituents of the ring, will be<br>
less than five.<br>

Where reference is made herein to carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups, the<br>
carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring can, unless the context indicates otherwise, be<br>
unsubstituted or substituted by one or more substituent groups R10 selected from<br>
halogen, hydroxy, trifluoromethyl, cyano, nitro, carboxy, amino, mono- or di-Cm<br>
hydrocarbylamino, carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups having from 3 to 12 ring<br>
members; a group R"-Rb wherein R8 is a bond, O, CO, X'cpt2), CCX^X1,<br>
X'CCX^X1, S, SO, S02, NR°, S02NRC or NRCS02; and Rb is selected from<br>

Where the substituent group R10 comprises or includes a carbocyclic or heterocyclic<br>
group, the said caibocyclic or heterocyclic group may be unsubstituted or may itself<br>
be substituted with one or more further substituent groups R10. In one sub-group of<br>
compounds of the formula (I), such further substituent groups R10may include<br>
carbocyclic or heterocyclic groups, which are typically not themselves further<br>
substituted. In another sub-group of compounds of the formula (I), the said further<br>

carbocyclic aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkylalkyl, cycloalkenylalkyl, and<br>
carbocyclic aralkyl, aralkenyl and aralkynyl groups. Such groups can be<br>
unsubstituted or, where stated, can be substituted by one or more substituents as<br>
defined herein. The examples and preferences expressed below apply to each of the<br>

carbon atom of the hydrocarbyl group remains. For example, 1,2, 3 or 4 carbon<br>
atoms of the hydrocarbyl group may be replaced by one of the atoms or groups<br>
listed, and the replacing atoms or groups may be the same or different. In general,<br>
the number of linear or backbone carbon atoms replaced will correspond to the<br>
number of linear or backbone atoms in the group replacing them. Examples of<br>
groups in which one or more carbon atom of the hydrocarbyl group have been<br>
replaced by a replacement atom or group as defined above include ethers and<br>
tiuoethers (C replaced by O or S), amides, esters, thioamides and thioesters (C-C<br>

Where an amino group has two hydrocarbyl substituents, they may, together with<br>
the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, and optionally with another<br>
heteroatom such as nitrogen, sulphur, or oxygen, link to form a ring structure of 4 to<br>
7 ring members.<br>

Specific Embodiments of and Preferences for A. E. R1 to Rs and R9<br>
The Group "A"<br>
hi formula (I), A is a saturated hydrocarbon linker group containing from 1 to 7<br>
carbon atoms, the linker group having a maximum chain length of 5 atoms<br>
extending between R1 and NR2R3 and a maximum chain length of 4 atoms<br>
extending between E and NR2R3. Within these constraints, the moieties E and R1<br>
can each be attached at any location on the group A.<br>
The term "maximum chain length" as used herein refers to the number of atoms<br>
lying directly between the two moieties in question, and does not take into account<br>
any branching in the chain or any hydrogen atoms that may be present. For<br>
example, in the structure A shown below:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
the chain length between Rl and NR2R3 is 3 atoms whereas the chain length<br>
between E and NR2R3 is 2 atoms.<br>
In general it is presently preferred that the linker group has a maximum chain length<br>
of 3 atoms (for example 1 or 2 atoms).<br>
In one embodiment, the linker group has a chain length of I atom extending<br>
between R1 and NR2R3.<br>
In another embodiment, the linker group has a chain length of 2 atoms extending<br>
between R1 and NR2R3.<br>
In a further embodiment, the linker group has a chain length of 3 atoms extending<br>
between R1 and NR2R3.<br>
It is preferred that the linker group has a maximum chain length of 3 atoms<br>
extending between E and NR2R3.<br>
In one particularly preferred group of compounds, the linker group has a chain<br>
length of 2 or 3 atoms extending between R1 and NR2R3 and a chain length of 2 or 3<br>
atoms extending between E and NR2R3.<br>
One of the carbon atoms in the linker group may optionally be replaced by an<br>
oxygen or nitrogen atom.<br>
When present, the nitrogen atom may be linked directly to the group E.<br>
In one embodiment, the carbon atom to which the group R1 is attached is replaced<br>
by an oxygen atom.<br>
In another embodiment, R and E are attached to the same carbon atom of the linker<br>
group, and a carbon atom in the chain extending between E and NR2R3 is replaced<br>
by an. oxygen atom.<br>
When a nitrogen atom or oxygen atom are present, it is preferred that the nitrogen<br>
or oxygen atom and the NR2R3 group are spaced apart by at least two intervening<br>
carbon atoms.<br>
In one particular group of compounds within formula (I), the linker atom linked<br>
directly to the group E is a carbon atom and the linker group A has an all-carbon<br>
skeleton.<br>
The carbon atoms of the linker group A may optionally bear one or more<br>
substituents selected from oxo, fluorine and hydroxy, provided that the hydroxy<br>
group is not located at a carbon atom a with respect to the NR2R3 group, and<br>
provided also that the oxo group is located at a carbon atom a with respect to the<br>
NR2R3 group. Typically, the hydroxy group, if present, is located at a position p<br>
with respect to the NR2R3 group. In general, no more than one hydroxy group will<br>
be present. Where fluorine is present, it may be present as a single fluorine<br>
substituent or may be present in a difluoromethylene or trifluoromethyl group, for<br>
example. In one embodiment, a fluorine atom is located at a position p with respect<br>
to the NR2R3 group.<br>
It will be appreciated that that when an oxo group is present at the carbon atom<br>
adjacent the NR2R3 group, the compound of the formula (I) will be an amide.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, no fluorine atoms are present in the linker<br>
group A.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, no hydroxy groups are present hi the linker<br>
group A.<br>
In a further embodiment, no oxo group is present in the linker group A.<br>
In one group of compounds of the formula (I) neither hydroxy groups nor fluorine<br>
atoms are present in the linker group A, e.g. the linker group A is unsubstituted.<br>
Preferably, when a carbon atom in the linker group A is replaced by a nitrogen<br>
atom, the group A bears no more than one hydroxy substituent and more preferably<br>
bears no hydroxy substituents.<br>
When there is a chain length of four atoms between E and NR2R3, it is preferred<br>
that the linker group A contains no nitrogen atoms and more preferably has an all<br>
carbon skeleton.<br>
In order to modify the susceptibility of the compounds to metabolic degradation in<br>
vivo, the linker group A can have a branched configuration at the carbon atom<br>
attached to the NR2R3 group. For example, the carbon atom attached to the NR2R3<br>
group can be attached to a pair of gem-dimethyl groups.<br>

R2andR3<br>
In one group of compounds of the formula (I), R2 and R3 are independently selected<br>
from hydrogen, CM hydrocarbyl and CM acyl wherein the hydrocarbyl and acyl<br>
moieties are optionally substituted by one or more substituents selected from<br>
fluorine, hydroxy, amino, methylamino, dimethylamino and methoxy.<br>
When the hydrocarbyl moiety is substituted by a hydroxy, amino, methylamino,<br>
dimethylamino or methoxy group, typically there are at least two carbon atoms<br>
between the substituent and the nitrogen atom of the group NR2R3. Particular<br>
examples of substituted hydrocarbyl groups are hydroxyethyl and hydroxypropyl.<br>
In another group of compovinds of the invention, R2 and R3 are independently<br>
selected from hydrogen, CM hydrocarbyl and CM acyl.<br>
Typically the hydrocarbyl group, whether substituted or unsubstituted, is an alkyl<br>
group, more usually a Ci, C2 or Cj alkyl group, and preferably a methyl group. In<br>
one particular sub-group of compounds, R2 and R3 are independently selected from<br>
hydrogen and methyl and hence NR2R3 can be an amino, methylamino or<br>
dimethylamino group. In one particular embodiment, NR2R3 can be an amino<br>
group. In another particular embodiment, NR2R3 can be a methylamino group.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the CM hydrocarbyl group can be a cyclopropyl,<br>
cyclopropylmethyl or cyclobutyl group.<br>
In another group of compounds, R2 and R3 together with the nitrogen atom to which<br>
they are attached form a cyclic group selected from an imidazole group and a<br>
saturated monocyclic heterocyclic group having 4-7 ring members and optionally<br>
containing a second heteroatom ring member selected from 0 and N.<br>
In a further group of compounds, R2 and R3 together with the nitrogen atom to<br>
which they are attached form a saturated monocyclic heterocyclic group having 4-7<br>
ring members and optionally containing a second heteroatom ring member selected<br>
from O and N.<br>
The saturated monocyclic heterocyclic group can be unsubstituted or substituted by<br>
one or more substituents R10 as defined above in the General Preferences and<br>
Definitions section of this application. Typically, however, any substituents on the<br>
heterocyclic group will be relatively small substituents such as CM hydrocarbyl<br>
(e.g. methyl, ethyl, fl-propyl, /-propyl, cyclopropyl, w-butyl, sec-butyl and tertburyl),<br>
fluorine, chlorine, hydroxy, amino, methylamino, ethylamino and<br>
dimethylamino. Particular substituents are methyl groups.<br>
The saturated monocyclic ring can be an azacycloalkyl group such as an azetidine,<br>
pyrrolidine, piperidine or azepane ring, and such rings are typically unsubstituted.<br>
Alternatively, the saturated monocyclic ring can contain an additional heteroatom<br>
selected from O and N, and examples of such groups include morpholine and<br>
piperazina. Where an additional N atom is present in the ring, this can form part of<br>
an NH group or an N-C^alkyl group such as an N-methyl, N-ethyl, N-propyl or Nisopropyl<br>
group.<br>
Where NR2R3 forms an imidazole group, the imidazole group can be unsubstituted<br>
or substituted, for example by one or more relatively small substituents such as CH<br>
hydrocarbyl (e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, cyclopropyl and butyl), fluorine, chlorine,<br>
hydroxy, amino, methylamino, ethylamino and dimethylamino. Particular<br>
substituents are methyl groups.<br>
In a further group of compounds, one of R2 and R3 together with the nitrogen atom<br>
to which they are attached and one or more atoms from the linker group A form a<br>
saturated monocyclic heterocyclic group having 4-7 ring members and optionally<br>
containing a second heteroatom ring member selected from 0 and N.<br>
Examples of such compounds include compounds wherein NR2R3 and A form a<br>
unit of the formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where t and u are each 0,1, 2 or 3 provided that the sum oft and u falls within the<br>
range of 2 to 4.<br>
Further examples of such compounds include compounds wherein NR2R3 and A<br>
form a cyclic group of the formula:<br>
(CH'2'w<br>
where v and w are each 0,1,2 or 3 provided that the sum of v and w falls within the<br>
range of 2 to 5. Particular examples of cyclic compounds are those in which v and<br>
w are both 2.<br>
Further examples of such compounds include compounds wherein NR2R3 and A<br>
form a cyclic group of the formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where x and w are each 0,1,2 or 3 provided that the sum of x and w falls within the<br>
range of 2 to 4. Particular examples of cyclic compounds are those in which x is 2<br>
and w is 1.<br>

August 2002. For example, acid addition salts may be prepared by dissolving the<br>
free base in an organic solvent in which a given salt form is insoluble or poorly<br>
soluble and then adding the required acid in an appropriate solvent so that the salt<br>
precipitates out of solution.<br>
Acid addition salts may be formed with a wide variety of acids, both inorganic and<br>
organic. Examples of acid addition salts include salts formed with an acid selected<br>
from the group consisting of acetic, 2,2-dichloroacetic, adipic, alginic, ascorbic<br>
(e.g. L-ascorbic), L-aspartic, benzenesulphonic, benzoic, 4-acetamidobenzoic,<br>
butanoic, (+) camphoric, camphor-sulphonic, (+)-(liS)-camphor-10-sulphonic,<br>
capric, caproic, caprylic, cinnamic, citric, cyclamic, dodecylsulphuric, ethane-1,2-<br>
disulphonic, ethanesulphonic, 2-hydroxyethanesulphonic, formic, fumaric,<br>
galactaric, gentisic, glucoheptonic, D-gluconic, glucuronic (e.g. D-glucuronic),<br>
glutamic (e.g. L-glutamic), a-oxoglutaric, glycolic, hippuric, hydrobromic,<br>
hydrochloric, hydriodic, isethionic, lactic (e.g. (+)-L-lactic and (±&gt;DL-lactic),<br>
lactobionic, maleic, malic, (-)-L-malic, malonic, (±)-DL-mandelic,<br>
methanesulphonic, naphthalenesulphonic (e.g. naphthalene-2-sulphonic),<br>
naphthalene-l,5-disulphonic, l-hydroxy-2-naphthoic, nicotinic, nitric, oleic, orotic,<br>
oxalic, palmitic, pamoic, phosphoric, propionic, L-pyroglutamic, salicylic, 4-aminosalicylic,<br>
sebacic, stearic, succinic, sulphuric, tannic, (+)-L-tartaric, thiocyanic,<br>
toluenesulphonic (e.g./7-toluenesulphonic), undecylenic and valeric acids, as well<br>
as acylated amino acids and cation exchange resins.<br>
One particular group of acid addition salts includes salts formed with hydrochloric,<br>
hydriodic, phosphoric, nitric, sulphuric, citric, lactic, succinic, maleic, malic,<br>
isethionic, fumaric, benzenesulphonic, toluenesulphonic, methanesulphonic,<br>
ethanesulphonic, naphthalenesulphonic, valeric, acetic, propanoic, butanoic,<br>
malonic, glucuronic and lactobionic acids.<br>
Another group of acid addition salts includes salts formed from acetic, adipic,<br>
ascorbic, aspartic, citric, DL-Lactic, rumaric, glucom'c, glucuronic, hippuric,<br>
hydrochloric, glutamic, DL-malic, methanesulphonic, sebacic, stearic, succinic and<br>
tartaric acids.<br>
The compounds of the invention may exist as mono- or di-salts depending upon the<br>
pKa of the acid from which the salt is formed. In stronger acids, the basic pyrazole<br>
nitrogen, as well as the nitrogen atom in the group NR2R3, may take part in salt<br>
formation. For example, where the acid has a pKa of less than about 3 (e.g. an acid<br>
such as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid or trifluoroacetic acid), the compounds of<br>
the invention will typically form salts with 2 molar equivalents of the acid.<br>
If the compound is anionic, or has a functional group which may be anionic (e.g.,<br>
-COOH may be -COO"), then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation.<br>
Examples of suitable inorganic cations include, but are not limited to, alkali metal<br>
ions such as Na+ and K"1", alkaline earth cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2*, and other<br>
cations such as A13+. Examples of suitable organic cations include, but are not<br>
limited to, ammonium ion (i.e., NH/) and substituted ammonium ions (e.g.,<br>
*, NH2R2*, NHR3+, NR4<br>
+). Examples of some suitable substituted ammonium<br>
ions are those derived from: ethylamine, diethylamine, dicyclohexylamine,<br>
triethylamine, butylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine,<br>
piperazine, benzylamine, phenylbenzylamine, choline, meglurnine, and<br>
trometliamine, as well as amino acids, such as lysine and arginine. An example of a<br>
common quaternary ammonium ion is<br>
Where the compounds of the formula (I) contain an amine function, these may form<br>
quaternary ammonium salts, for example by reaction with an alkylating agent<br>
according to methods well known to the skilled person. Such quaternary<br>
ammonium compounds are within the scope of formula (I).<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) containing an amine function may also form Noxides.<br>
A reference herein to a compound of the formula (I) that contains an amine<br>
function also includes the N-oxide.<br>
Where a compound contains several amine functions, one or more than one<br>
'nitrogen atom may be oxidised to form an N-oxide. Particular examples of Noxides<br>
are the N-oxides of a tertiary amine or a nitrogen atom of a nitrogencontaining<br>
heterocycle.<br>
N-Oxides can be formed by treatment of the corresponding amine with an oxidizing<br>
agent such as hydrogen peroxide or a per-acid (e.g. a peroxycarboxylic acid), see<br>
for example Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, 4th Edition, Wiley<br>
Interscience, pages. More particularly, N-oxides can be made by the procedure of<br>
L. W. Deady (Syn. Comm. 1 977, 7, 509-514) in which the amine compound is<br>
reacted with w-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA), for example, in an inert<br>
solvent such as dichloromethane.<br>
Compounds of the formula (1) may exist in a number of different geometric<br>
isomeric, and tautomeric forms and references to compounds of the formula (I)<br>
include all such forms. For the avoidance of doubt, where a compound can exist in<br>
one of several geometric isomeric or tautomeric forms and only one is specifically<br>
described or shown, all others are nevertheless embraced by formula (I).<br>
For example, in compounds of the formula (I) the pyrazole group may take either of<br>
the following two tautomeric forms A and B.<br>
A B<br>
For simplicity, the general formula (I) illustrates form A but the formula is to be<br>
taken as embracing both form A and form B.<br>
Where compounds of the formula (I) contain one or more chiral centres, and can<br>
exist in the form of two or more optical isomers, references to compounds of the<br>
formula (I) include all optical isomeric forms thereof (e.g. enantiomers and<br>
diasterebisomers), either as individual optical isomers, or mixtures or two or more<br>
optical isomers, unless the context requires otherwise.<br>
For example, the group A can include one or more chiral centres. Thus, when E<br>
and R1 are both attached to the same carbon atom on the linker group A, the said<br>
carbon atom is typically chiral and hence the compound of the formula (I) will exist<br>
as a pair of enantiomers (or more than one pair of enantiomers where more than one<br>
chiral centre is present in the compound).<br>
The optical isomers may be characterised and identified by their optical activity (i.e.<br>
as + and - isomers) or they may be characterised in terms of their absolute<br>
stereochemistry using the "R and S" nomenclature developed by Cahn, Ingold and<br>
Prelog, see Advanced Organic Chemistry by Jerry March, 4th Edition, John Wiley &amp;<br>
Sons, New York, 1992, pages 109-114, and see also Cahn, Ingold &amp; Prelog, Angew.<br>
Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 1966,5,385-415.<br>
Optical isomers can be separated by a number of techniques including chiral<br>
chromatography (chromatograpby on a chiral support) and such techniques are well<br>
known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
As an alternative to chiral chromatography, optical isomers can be separated by<br>
forming diastereoisomeric salts with chiral acids such as (-t-)-tartaric acid, (-)-<br>
pyroglutamic acid, (-)-di-toluloyl-L-tartaric acid, (+)-mandelic acid, (-)-malic acid,<br>
and (-)-camphorsulphonic, separating the diastereoisomers by preferential<br>
crystallisation, and then dissociating the salts to give the individual enantiomer of<br>
the tree base.<br>
Where compounds of the formula (I) exist as two or more optical isomeric forms,<br>
one enantiomer in a pair of enantiomers may exhibit advantages over the other<br>
enantiomer, for example, in terms of biological activity. Thus, in certain<br>
circumstances, it may be desirable to use as a therapeutic agent only one of a pair of<br>
enantiomers, or only one of a plurality of diastereoisomers. Accordingly, the<br>
invention provides compositions containing a compound of the formula (I) having<br>
one or more chiral centres, wherein at least 55% (e.g. at least 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%,<br>
80%, 85%, 90% or 95%) of the compound of the formula (I) is present as a single<br>
optical isomer (e.g. enantiomer or diastereoisomer). In one general embodiment,<br>
99% or more (e.g. substantially all) of the total amount of the compound of the<br>
formula (I) may be present as a single optical isomer (e.g. enantiomer or<br>
diastereoisomer).<br>
Esters such as carboxylic acid esters and acyloxy esters of the compounds of<br>
formula (I) bearing a carboxylic acid group or a hydroxyl group are also embraced<br>
by Formula (I). In one embodiment of the invention, formula (I) includes within its<br>
scope esters of compounds of the formula (I) bearing a carboxylic acid group or a<br>
hydroxyl group. In another embodiment of the invention, formula (I) does not<br>
include within its scope esters of compounds of the formula (I) bearing a carboxylic<br>
acid group or a hydroxyl group. Examples of esters are compounds containing the<br>
group -C(=O)OR, wherein R is an ester substituent, for example, a Ci^alkyl group,<br>
a C3-20 heterocyclyl group, or a €5-29 aryl group, preferably a C1-7 alkyl group.<br>
Particular examples of ester groups include, but are not limited to, -C(=O)OCH3,<br>
-C(=0)OCH2CH3, -C(=O)OC(CH3)3, and -C(=O)OPh. Examples of acyloxy<br>
(reverse ester) groups are represented by -OC(=0)R, wherein R is an acyloxy<br>
substituent, for example, a Cj.7 alkyl group, a Cj-ao heterocyclyl group, or a 05.30<br>
aryl group, preferably a d-7 alkyl group. Particular examples of acyioxy groups<br>
include, but are not limited to, -OC(=O)CH3 (acetoxy), -Oe(O)CH2CH3,<br>
-OC(=0)C(CH3)3, -OC{=0)Ph, and -OC(=0)CH2Ph.<br>
Also encompassed by formula (I) are any polymorphic forms of the compounds,<br>
solvates (e.g. hydrates), complexes (e.g. inclusion complexes or clathrates with<br>
compounds such as cyclodextrins, or complexes with metals) of the compounds,<br>
and pro-drugs of the compounds. By "prodrugs" is meant for example any<br>
compound that is converted in vivo into a biologically active compound of the<br>
formula (1).<br>
For example, some prodrugs are esters of the active compound (e.g., a<br>
physiologically acceptable metabolically labile ester). During metabolism, the ester<br>
group (-C(*=0)OR) is cleaved to yield the active drug. Such esters may be formed<br>
by esterification, for example, of any of the carboxylic acid groups (-C(=0)OH) in<br>
Has parent compound, with, where appropriate, prior protection of any other reactive<br>
groups present in the parent compound, followed by deprotection if required.<br>
Examples of such metabolically labile esters include those of the formula -<br>
C(=0)OR wherein R is:<br>
Ci-7alkyl (e.g., -Me, -Et, -nPr, -iPr, -nBu, -sBu, -iBu, -tBu);<br>
Ci-raminoalkyl (e.g., aminoethyl; 2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethyl;<br>
2-(4-morpholino)ethyl); and<br>
acyloxy-Ci-ialkyl (e.g.s acyloxymethyl; acyloxyethyl; pivaloyloxymethyl;<br>
acetoxymethyl; l-acetoxyethyl; l-(l-methoxy-l-methyl)ethyl-carbonyloxyethyl; 1-<br>
(benzoyloxy)ethyl; isopropoxy-carbonyloxymethyl; 1-isopropoxycarbonyloxyethyl;<br>
cyclohexyl-carbonyloxyraethyl; 1 -cyclohexyl-carbonyloxyethyl;<br>
cyclohexyloxy-carbonyloxymethyl; 1-cydobexyloxy-carbonyloxyethyl; (4-<br>
tetrahydropyranyloxy) carbonyloxymethyl; l-(4-tetrahydropyranyloxy)-<br>
carbonyloxyethyl; (4-tetrahydropyranyl)carbonyloxymethyl; and<br>
l-(4-tetrahydropyranyl)-carbon.yloxyethyl).<br>
Also, some prodrugs are activated enzymatically to yield the active compound, or a<br>
compound which, upon further chemical reaction, yields the active compound (for<br>
example, as in antigen-directed enzyme pro-drug therapy (ADEPT), gene-directed<br>
enzyme pro-drug therapy (GDEPT) and ligand-directed enzyme pro-drug therapy<br>
(LIDEPT). For example, the prodrag may be a sugar derivative or other glycoside<br>
conjugate, or may be an amino acid ester derivative.<br>
Methods for the preparation of compounds of the formula (I)<br>
In this section, as hi all other sections of this application, unless the context<br>
indicates otherwise, references to formula (I) included references to formulae (la),<br>
(Ib), (II), (III), (IV) and (V) and all other sub-groups, preferences and examples<br>
thereof as defined herein,<br>
Compounds of the formula (T) can be prepared by reaction of a compound of the<br>
formula (X) with a compound of the formula (XI) or an N-protected derivative<br>
thereof:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein A, E, and R1 to R5 are as hereinbefore defined, one of the groups X and Y<br>
is chlorine, bromine or iodine or a trifluoromethanesulphonate (triflate) group, and<br>
the other one of the groups X and Y is a boronate residue, for example a boronate<br>
ester or boronic acid residue.<br>
The reaction can be carried out under typical Suzuki Coupling conditions in the<br>
presence of a palladium catalyst such as bis(tri-/-butylphosphine)palladium and a<br>
base (e.g. a carbonate such as potassium carbonate). The reaction may be carried<br>
out in an aqueous solvent system, for example aqueous ethanol, and the reaction<br>
mixture is typically subjected to heating, for example to a temperature in excess of<br>
100°C.<br>
An illustrative synthetic route involving a Suzuki coupling step is shown in Scheme<br>
1. The starting material for the synthetic route shown in scheme 1 is the halosubstituted<br>
aryl- or heteroarylmethyl nitrile (XII) in which X is a chlorine, bromine<br>
or iodine atom or a triflate group, The nitrile (XII) is condensed with the aldehyde<br>
R^CHO in the presence of an alkali such as sodium 01 potassium hydroxide in an<br>
aqueous solvent system such as aqueous ethanol. The reaction can be carried out at<br>
room temperature.<br>
The resulting substituted acrylonitrile derivative (XIII) is then treated with a<br>
reducing agent that will selectively reduce the alkene double bond without reducing<br>
the nitrile group. A borohydride such as sodium borohydride may be used for this<br>
purpose to give the substituted acetonitrile derivative (XIV). The reduction reaction<br>
is typically carried out in a solvent such as ethanol and usually with heating, for<br>
example to a temperature up to about 65°C.<br>
The reduced nitrile (XIV) is then coupled with the pyrazole boronate ester (XV)<br>
under the Suzuki coupling conditions described above to give a compound of the<br>
formula (I) in which A-NR2R3 is a substituted acetonitrile group.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The substituted acetonitrile compound (XVI) may then be reduced to the<br>
corresponding amine (XVII) by treatment with a suitable reducing agent such as<br>
Raney nickel and ammonia in ethanol.<br>
5 The synthetic route shown in Scheme 1 gives rise to amino compounds of the<br>
formula (I) in which the aryl or heteroaryl group E is attached to the p-position of<br>
the group A relative to the amino group. In order to give amino compounds of the<br>
formula (I) in which R1 is attached to the p-position relative to the amino group, the<br>
functional groups on the two starting materials in the condensation step can be<br>
reversed so that a compound of the formula X-E-CHO wherein X is bromine,<br>
chlorine, iodine or a triflate group is condensed with a compound of the formula Rl-<br>
CHj-CN to give a substituted acrylonitrile derivative which is then reduced to the<br>
corresponding acetonitrile derivative before coupling with the pyrazole boronate<br>
(XV) and reducing the cyano group to an amino group.<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) in which R1 is attached to the a-position relative to<br>
the amino group can be prepared by the sequence of reactions shown in Scheme 2.<br>
In Scheme 2, the starting material is a halo-substituted aryl- or heteroarylmethyl<br>
Grignaid reagent (XVKI, X = bromine or chlorine) which is reacted with the nitrile<br>
R'-CN in a dry ether such as diethyl ether to give an intermediate imine (not<br>
shown) which is reduced to give the amine (XIX) using a reducing agent such as<br>
lithium aluminium hydride. The amine (XIX) can be reacted with the boronate<br>
ester (XV) under the Suzuki coupling conditions described above to yield the amine<br>
(XX).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
Scheme 2<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) can also be prepared ftom the substituted nitrile<br>
compound (XXI):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein PG is a protecting group such as a tetrahydropyranyl group. The nitrile<br>
(XXI) can be condensed with an aldehyde of the formula R1-(CH2)r-CHO, wherein<br>
r is 0 or 1, and the resulting substituted acrylonitrile subsequently reduced to the<br>
corresponding substituted nitrile under conditions analogous to those set out in<br>
Scheme 1 above. The protecting group PG can then be removed by an appropriate<br>
method. The nitrile compound may subsequently be reduced to the corresponding<br>
amine by the use of a suitable reducing agent as described above.<br>
The nitrile compound (XXI) may also be reacted with a Grignard reagent of the<br>
formula Rl-(CHa)rMgBr under standard Grignard reaction conditions followed by<br>
deprotection to give an amino compound of the invention which has the structure<br>
shown in formula (XX11).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In the preparative procedures outlined above, the coupling of the aryl or heteroaryl<br>
group E to the pyrazole is accomplished by reacting a halo-pyrazole or halo-aryl or<br>
heteroaryl compound with a boronate ester or boronic acid in the presence of a<br>
palladium catalyst and base. Many boronates suitable for use in preparing<br>
compounds of the invention are commercially available, for example from Boron<br>
Molecular Limited of Noble Park, Australia, or from Combi-Blocks Inc. of San<br>
Diego, USA. Where the boronates are not commercially available, they can be<br>
prepared by methods known in the art, for example as described in the review<br>
article by N. Miyaura and A. Suzuki, Chem. Rev. 1995,95,2457. Thus, boroflates<br>
can be prepared by reacting the corresponding bromo-compound with an alkyl<br>
lithium such as butyl lithium and then reacting with a borate ester. The resulting<br>
boronate ester derivative can, if desired, be hydrolysed to give the corresponding<br>
boronic acid.<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) in which the group A contains a nitrogen atom<br>
attached to the group E can be prepared by well known synthetic procedures from<br>
compounds of the formula (XXIII) or a protected form thereof, Compounds of the<br>
formula (XXIII) can be obtained by a Suzuki coupling reaction of a compound of<br>
the formula (XV) (see Scheme 1) with a compound of the formula Br-E-NHj such<br>
as 4-bromoaniline.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) in which R1 and E are connected to the same carbon<br>
atom can be prepared as shown in Scheme 3.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Scheme 3<br>
In Scheme 3, an aldehyde compound (XXIV) where X is bromine, chlorine, iodine<br>
or a triflate group is condensed with ethyl cyanoacetate in the presence of a base to<br>
give a cyanoacrylate ester intermediate (XXV). The condensation is typically<br>
carried out in the presence of a base, preferably a non-hydroxide such as piperidine,<br>
by heating under Dean Stark conditions.<br>
The cyanoacrylate intermediate (XXV) is then reacted with a Grignard reagent<br>
R^MgBr suitable for introducing the group Rl by Michael addition to the carboncarbon<br>
double bond of the acrylate moiety. The Grignaid reaction may be carried<br>
out in a polar non-protic solvent such as tetrahydrofurau at a low temperature, for<br>
example at around 0 °C, The product of the Grignard reaction is the cyano<br>
propionic acid ester (XXVI) and this is subjected to hydrolysis and decarboxylation<br>
to give the propionic acid derivative (XXVII). The hydrolysis and decarboxylation<br>
steps can be effected by heating in an acidic medium, for example a mixture of<br>
sulphuric acid and acetic acid.<br>
The propionic acid derivative (XXVII) is converted to the amide (XXVIII) by<br>
reaction with an amine HNR2R3 under conditions suitable for forming an amide<br>
bond. The coupling reaction between the propionic acid derivative (XXVII) and the<br>
amine HNR2R3 is preferably carried out in the presence of a reagent of the type<br>
commonly used in the formation of peptide linkages. Examples of such reagents<br>
include 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) (Sheehan et al, J. Amer. Ckem Soc.<br>
1955,77,1067), l-ethyl-3-(3'-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (referred to<br>
herein either as EDC or EDAC) (Sheehan et al, J. Org. Chem., 1961, 26, 2525),<br>
uronium-based coupling agents such as O-(J-&amp;zsibenzatnazo\-\-y\')-N,N,N'&gt;N'~<br>
tetramethyluroiiium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) and phosphonium-based<br>
coupling agents such as l-benzo-triazolyloxytris-(pyrrolidino)pnosphonium<br>
hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) (Castro et al, Tetrahedron Letters, 1990,31,205).<br>
Carbodiimide-based coupling agents aie advantageously used in combination with<br>
l-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazoIe (HOAt) (L. A, Carptoo, J, Amer. Chem, Soc., 1993,<br>
115. 4397) or 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) (Kordgetal, Chem. Ber., 103,708,<br>
2024-2034). Preferred coupling reagents include EDC (EDAC) and DCC in<br>
combination with HOAt or HOBt.<br>
The coupling reaction is typically carried out in a non-aqueous, non-protic solvent<br>
such as acetonitrile, dioxan, dimethylsulphoxide, dichloromethane,<br>
dimethylformamide or N-methylpyrrolidine, or in an aqueous solvent optionally<br>
together with one or more miscible co-solvents. The reaction can be carried out at<br>
room temperature or, where the reactants are less reactive (for example in the case<br>
of electron-poor anilines bearing electron withdrawing groups such as<br>
sulphonamide groups) at an appropriately elevated temperature. The reaction may<br>
be carried out in the presence of a non-interfering base, for example a tertiary amine<br>
such as triethylamine or 7V,A/-oiisopropylethylamine.<br>
Where the amine HNR2R3 is ammonia, the amide coupling reaction can be carried<br>
out using l,r-carbonyldiimidazole (GDI) to activate the carboxylic acid before<br>
addition of the ammonia.<br>
As an alternative, a reactive derivative of the carboxylic acid, e.g. an anhydride or<br>
acid chloride, may be used. Reaction with a reactive derivative such an anhydride<br>
is typically accomplished by stirring the amine and anhydride at room temperature<br>
in the presence of a base such as pyridine.<br>
The amide (XXVIII) can be converted to a compound of the formula (XXX) (which<br>
corresponds to a compound of the formula (I) wherein A has an oxo substituent<br>
next to the NR2R3 group) by reaction with a boronate (XV) under Suzuki coupling<br>
conditions as described above. The amide (XXX) can subsequently be reduced<br>
using a hydride reducing agent such as lithium aluminium hydride in the presence<br>
of aluminium chloride to give an amine of the formula (XXXI) (which corresponds<br>
to a compound of the formula (I) wherein A is CH-CHz-CHa-)- The reduction<br>
reaction is typically carried out in an ether solvent, for example diethyl ether, with<br>
heating to the reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>
Rather than reacting the amide (XXVIII) with the boronate (XV), the amide may<br>
instead be reduced with lithium aluminium hydride/aluminium chloride, for<br>
example in an ether solvent at ambient temperature, to give the amine (XXK)<br>
which is then reacted with the boronate (XV) under the Suzuki coupling conditions<br>
described above to give the amine (XXX).<br>
In order to obtain the homologue of the amine (XXIX) containing one fewer<br>
methylene group, the carboxylic acid (XXVII) can be converted to the azide by<br>
standard methods and subjected to a Curtius rearrangement in the presence of an<br>
alcohol such as benzyl alcohol to give a carbamate (see Advanced Organic<br>
Chemistry, 4* edition, by Jerry March, John Wiley &amp; sons, 1992, pages 1091-<br>
1092). The benzylcarbamate can function as a protecting group for the amine<br>
during the subsequent Suzuki coupling step, and the benzyloxycarbonyl moiety in<br>
the carbamate group can then be removed by standard methods after the coupling<br>
step. Alternatively, the benzylcarbamate group can be treated with a hydride<br>
reducing agent such as lithium aluminium hydride to give a compound in which<br>
NR2R3 is a methylamino group instead of an ammo group.<br>
Intermediate compounds of the formula (X) where the moiety X is a chlorine,<br>
bromine or iodine atom and A is a group CH-CH:- can be prepared by the reductive<br>
amination of an aldehyde compound of the formula (XXXII):<br>
X (XXXII)<br>
with an amine of the formula HNR2R3 under standard reductive amination<br>
conditions, for example in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride in an alcohol<br>
solvent such as methanol or ethanol.<br>
The aldehyde compound (XXXII) can be obtained by oxidation of the<br>
corresponding alcohol (XXXin) using, for example, the Dess-Martin periodinane<br>
(see Dess, D.B.; Martin, J.C. J. Org, Soc., 1983, 48,4155 and Organic Syntheses,<br>
Vol. 77,141).<br>
X (XXXIII)<br>
Compounds of the formula (1) where A, N and R2 together form a cyclic group can<br>
be formed by the Suzuki coupling of a boronate compound of the formula (XV)<br>
with a cyclic intermediate of the formula (XXXIV) or anN-protected derivative<br>
thereof.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Cyclic intermediates of the formula (XXXIV), where R1 is an aryl group such as an<br>
optionally substituted phenyl group, can be formed by Friedel Crafts alkylation of<br>
an aryl compound R'-H with a compound of the formula (XXXV):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The alkylation is typically carried out in the presence of a Lewis acid such as<br>
aluminium chloride at a reduced temperature, for example less than 5 °C.<br>
The Friedel Crafts reaction has been found to be of general applicability to the<br>
preparation of a range of intermediates of the formula (X). Accordingly, in a<br>
general method of making compounds of the formula (X), a compound of the<br>
formula (LXX):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
is reacted with a compound of the formula R'-H under Friedel Crafts alkylation<br>
conditions, for example in the presence of an aluminium, halide (e.g. Aids).<br>
In a further method for the preparation of a compound of the formula (I) wherein<br>
the moiety NR2R3 is attached to a CHj group of the moiety A, an aldehyde of the<br>
fonnula (XXXVI) can be coupled with an amine of the formula HNR2R3 under<br>
reductive amination conditions as described above. In the formulae (XXXVI) and<br>
(XXXVII), A' is the residue of the group A - i.e. the moieties A' and CH2 together<br>
form the group A. The aldehyde (XXXVII) can be formed by oxidation of the<br>
corresponding alcohol using, for example, Dess-Martin periodinane.<br>
(XXXVI) H (xxxvn)<br>
A Friedel Crafts alkylation procedure of the type described above for the synthesis<br>
of intermediates of the formula (XXXIV) can also be used to prepare intermediates<br>
of the formula (X) wherein X is bromine. An example of such a procedure is shown<br>
in Scheme 4.<br>
Scheme 4<br>
The istarting material for the synthetic route shown in Scheme 4 is the epoxide<br>
(XXXVIII) which can either be obtained commercially or can be made by methods<br>
well known to the skilled person, for example by reaction of the aldehyde<br>
Br-E-CHO with trimethylsulphonium iodide. The epoxide (XXXVm) is reacted<br>
with an amine HNR2R3 under conditions suitable for a ring-opening reaction with<br>
the epoxide to give a compound of the formula (XXXIX). The ring opening<br>
reaction can be carried out in a polar solvent such as ethanol at room temperature or<br>
optionally with mild heating, and typically with a large excess of the amine.<br>
The amine (XXXIX) is then reacted with an aryl compound R'H, typically a phenyl<br>
compound, capable of taking part in a Friedel Crafts alkylation (see for example<br>
Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, pages 534-542). Thus, the amine of<br>
formula (XXXIX) is typically reacted with the aryl compound R]H in the presence<br>
of an aluminium chloride catalyst at or around room temperature. Where the aryl<br>
compound R*H is a liquid, e.g. as in the case of a methoxybenzene (e.g. anisole) or<br>
a halobenzene such as chlorobenzene, the aryl compound may serve as the solvent.<br>
Otherwise, a less reactive solvent such as nitrobenzene may be used. The Friedel<br>
Crafts alkylation of the compound R'H with the amine (XXXIX) gives a compound<br>
of the formula (XL) which corresponds to a compound of the formula (X) wherein<br>
X is bromine and A is CHCHi.<br>
The hydroxy intermediate (XXXIX) in Scheme 4 can also be used to prepare<br>
compounds of the formula (X) in which the carbon atom of the hydrocarbon linker<br>
group A adjacent the group R1 is replaced by an oxygen atom. Thus the compound<br>
of formula (XXXIX), or an N-protected derivative thereof (where R2 or R3 are<br>
hydrogen) can be reacted with a phenolic compound of the formula R!-OH under<br>
Mitsunobu alkylation conditions, e.g. in the presence of diethyl azodicarboxylate<br>
and triphenylphosphine. The reaction is typically carried out in a polar non-protic<br>
solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at a moderate temperature such as ambient<br>
temperature.<br>
A further use of the hydroxy-intermediate (XXXIX) is for the preparation of the<br>
corresponding fluoro-compound. Thus, the hydroxy group can be replaced by<br>
fluorine by reaction with pyridine:hydrogen fluoride complex (Olah's reagent).<br>
The fluorinated intermediate can then be subjected to a Suzuki coupling reaction to<br>
give a compound of the formula (I) with a fluorinated hydrocarbon group A. A<br>
fluorinated compound of the formula (I) could alternatively be prepared by first<br>
coupling the hydroxy intermediate (XXXIX), or a protected form thereof, with a<br>
pyrazole boronic acid or boronate under Suzuki conditions and then replacing the<br>
hydroxy group in the resulting compound of formula (I) with fluorine using<br>
pyridine: hydrogen fluoride complex.<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) in which the moiety:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where A' is the hydrocarbon residue of the group A, can be prepared by the<br>
sequence of reactions shown in Scheme 5.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Scheme 5<br>
As shown in Scheme 5, the aldehyde (XXIV) is reacted with a Grignard reagent<br>
R'MgBr under standard Grignard conditions to give the secondary alcohol (XLI).<br>
The secondary alcohol can then be reacted with a compound of the formula (XLII)<br>
in which R2 and R3&gt; represent the groups R2 and R3 or an amine-protectiag group,<br>
A" is the residue of the group A, and X' represents a hydroxy group or a leaving<br>
group.<br>
The amine protecting group can be, for example, a phthalolyl group in which case<br>
NR2 R3' is aphthalimido group.<br>
When X' is a hydroxy group, the reaction between compound (XLI) and (XLII) can<br>
take the form of an toluene sulphonic acid catalysed condensation reaction.<br>
Alternatively, when X' is a leaving group such as halogen, the alcohol (XLI) can<br>
first be treated with a strong base such as sodium hydride to form the alcoholate<br>
which then reacts with the compound (XLII).<br>
The resulting compound of the formula (XLIII) is then subjected to a Suzuki<br>
coupling reaction with the pyrazole boronate reagent (XV) under typical Suzuki<br>
coupling conditions of the type described above to give a compound of the formula<br>
(XLIV). The protecting group can then be removed from the protected amine group<br>
NR2'R3' to give a compound of the formula (I).<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) in which the moiety:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where A" is the hydrocarbon residue of the group A, can be prepared by the<br>
sequence of reactions shown in Scheme 6.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Scheme 6<br>
The starting material in Scheme 6 is the chloroacyl compound (XLV) which can be<br>
prepared by literature methods (e.g. the method described in J. Med. Chew., 2004,<br>
47,3924-3926) or methods analogous thereto. Compound (XLV) is converted into<br>
the secondary alcohol (XLVI) by reduction with a hydride reducing agent such as<br>
sodium borohydride in a polar solvent such as water/tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The secondary alcohol (XLVI) can then be reacted with a phenolic compound of<br>
the formula R'-OH under Mitsunobu alkylation conditions, e.g. in the presence of<br>
diethyl azodicarboxylate and triphenylphosphine, as described above, to give the<br>
aryl ether compound (XLVII).<br>
The chorine atom in the aryl ether compound (XLVII) is then displaced by reaction<br>
with an amine HNR2R3 to give a compound of the formula (XLVIII). The<br>
nucleophilic displacement reaction may be carried out by heating the amine with<br>
the aryl ether in a polar solvent such as an alcohol at an elevated temperature, for<br>
example approximately 100 °C. The heating may advantageously be achieved<br>
using a microwave heater. The resulting amine (XLVIII) can then be subjected to a<br>
Suzuki coupling procedure with a boronate of the formula (XV) as described above<br>
to give the compound (XLIX).<br>
In a variation on the reaction sequence shown in Scheme 6, the secondary alcohol<br>
(XLVI) can be subjected to a nucleophilic displacement reaction with an amine<br>
HNR2R3 before introducing the group R1 by means of the Mitsunobu ether-forming<br>
reaction.<br>
Another route to compounds of the formula (I) in which E and R1 are attached to<br>
the same carbon atom in the group A is illustrated in Scheme 7.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Scheme 7<br>
In Scheme 7, an N-protected pyrazolyl boronic acid (L) is reacted under Suzuki<br>
coupling conditions with the cyano compound X-E-CN in which X is typically a<br>
halogen such as bromine or chlorine. The protecting group PG at the 1 -position of<br>
the pyrazole ring may be, for example, a triphenylmethyl (trityl) group. The<br>
boronic acid (L) can be prepared using the method described in EP 1382603 or<br>
methods analogous thereto.<br>
The resulting nitrile (LI) may then be reacted with a Grignard reagent R!-MgBr to<br>
introduce the group R1 and form the ketone (LII). The ketone (LII) is converted to<br>
the enamine (LIV) by reaction with the diphenylphosphinoyhnethylamine (LIII) in<br>
the presence of a strong base such as an alkyl lithium, particularly butyl lithium.<br>
The enamine (LIV) is then subjected to hydrogenation over a palladium on charcoal<br>
catalyst to reduce the double bond of the enamine and remove the 1-phenethyl<br>
group. Where the protecting group PG is a trityl group, hydrogenation also<br>
removes the trityl group, thereby yielding a compound of the formula (LV).<br>
Alternatively, the enamine (LIV) can be reduced with a hydride reducing agent<br>
under the conditions described in Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 14 (2003) 1309-1316<br>
and subjected to a chiral separation. Removal of the protecting 2-phenethyl group<br>
and the protecting group PG then gives an optically active form of the compound of<br>
formula (LV).<br>
Intermediates of the formula (X) wherein A and R2 link to form a ring containing an<br>
oxygen atom can be prepared by the general method illustrated in Scheme 8.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Scheme 8<br>
In Scheme 8, a ketone (LVI) is reacted with trimethylsulphonium iodide to form the<br>
epoxide (LVII). The reaction is typically carried out in the presence of a hydride<br>
base such as sodium hydride in a polar solvent such as dimethylsulphoxide.<br>
The epoxide (LVII) is subjected to a ring opening reaction with ethanolamine in the<br>
presence of a non-interfering base such as triethylamine in a polar solvent such as<br>
an alcohol (e.g. isopropanol), usually with mild heating (e.g. up to approximately<br>
50 °C. The resulting secondary alcohol is then cyclised to form the morpholine ring<br>
by treatment with concentrated sulphuric acid in a solvent such as ethanolic<br>
dichloromethane.<br>
The morpholine intermediate (LIX) can then reacted with the boronate (XV) under<br>
Suzuki coupling conditions to give the compound of formula (LX), which<br>
corresponds to a compound of the formula (I) in which A-NR2R3 forms a<br>
morpholine group.<br>
Instead of reacting the epoxide (LVII) with ethanolamine, it may instead be reacted<br>
with mono- or dialkylamines thereby providing a route to compounds containing<br>
the moiety:<br>
Compounds wherein R2 and R3 are both hydrogen can be prepared by reacting the<br>
epoxide (LVII) with potassium phthah'mide in a polar solvent such as DMSO.<br>
During the Suzuki coupling step, the phthalimide group may undergo partial<br>
hydrolysis to give the corresponding phthalamic acid which can be cleaved using<br>
hydrazine to give the ammo group NH2- Alternatively, the phthalamic acid can be<br>
recyclised to the phthalimide using a standard amide-forming reagent and the<br>
phthaloyl group then removed using hydrazine to give the amine.<br>
A further synthetic route to compounds of the formula (I) wherein A and NR2R3<br>
combine to form a cyclic group is illustrated in Scheme 9.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Scheme 9<br>
In Scheme 9, the starting material (LXI) is typically a di-aryl/heteroaryl methane in<br>
which one or both of the aryl/heteroaryl groups is capable of stabilising or<br>
facilitating formation of an anion formed on the mcthylene group between E and<br>
R1. For example, R1 may advantageously be a pyridine group. The starting<br>
material (LXI) is reacted with the N-protected bis-2-chloroethylamine (LXII) in the<br>
presence of a non-interfering strong base such as sodium hexaraethyldisilazide in a<br>
polar solvent such as tetrahydiofuran at a reduced temperature (e.g. around 0 °C) to<br>
give the N-protected cyclic intermediate (LXIII). The protecting group can be any<br>
standard amine-protecting group such as a Boo group. Following cyclisation, the<br>
intermediate (LXIII) is coupled to a boronate of the formula (XV) under Suzuki<br>
coupling conditions and then deprotected to give the compound of the formula (I).<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) in which the moiety:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein "Alk" is a small alkyl group such as methyl or ethyl can be formed by the<br>
synthetic route illustrated in Scheme 10.<br>
MeOH/H+<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Scheme 10<br>
In Scheme 10, a carboxylic acid of the formula (LXFV) is esterified by treatment<br>
with methanol in the presence of an acid catalyst such as hydrochloric acid. The<br>
ester (LXV) is then reacted with a strong base such as lithium diisopropylamide<br>
(LDA) and an alkyl iodide such as methyl iodide at reduced temperature (e.g.<br>
between 0 °C and -78 °C). The branched ester (LXVI) is then hydrolysed to the<br>
acid (LXVTI) and coupled with an amine HNR2R3 under standard amide forming<br>
conditions of the type described above. The amide (LXVIH) can then be reduced to<br>
the amine (LXIX) using lithium aluminium hydride, and the amine (LXIX) is then<br>
reacted with a pyrazole boronate or boronic acid under Suzuki coupling conditions<br>
to give a compound of the formula (I).<br>
Once formed, many compounds of the formula (I) can be converted into other<br>
compounds of the formula (I) using standard functional group interconversions.<br>
For example, compounds of the formula (I) in which the NR2R3 forms part of a<br>
nitrile group can be reduced to the corresponding amine. Compounds in which<br>
NR2R3 is an NHa group can be converted to the corresponding alkylamine by<br>
reductive alkylation, or to a cyclic group. Compounds wherein R1 contains a<br>
halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine can be used to introduce an aryl or<br>
heteroaryl group substituent into the R1 group by means of a Suzuki coupling<br>
reaction. Further examples of interconversions of one compound of the formula (I)<br>
to another compound of the formula (I) can be found in the examples below.<br>
Additional examples of functional group interconversions and reagents and<br>
conditions for carrying out such conversions can be found in, for example,<br>
Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, 4th edition, 119, Wiley Interscience,<br>
New York, Fiesers' Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes 1-17, John Wiley,<br>
edited by Mary Fieser (ISBN: 0-471-58283-2), and Organic Syntheses, Volumes 1-<br>
8, John Wiley, edited by Jeremiah P. Freeman (ISBN: 0-471-31192-8).<br>
In many of the reactions described above, it may be necessary to protect one or<br>
more groups to prevent reaction from taking place at an undesirable location on the<br>
molecule. Examples of protecting groups, and methods of protecting and<br>
deprotecting functional groups, can be found in Protective Groups in Organic<br>
Synthesis (T. Green and P. Wuts; 3rd Edition; John Wiley and Sons, 1999).<br>
A hydroxy group may be protected, for example, as an ether (-OR) or an ester (-<br>
OC(=0)R), for example, as: a t-butyl ether; a benzyl, benzhydryl (diphenylmethyl),<br>
or trityl (triphenylmethyl) ether; a trimethylsilyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl ether; or an<br>
acetyl ester (-OC(=0)CH3, -OAc). An aldehyde or ketone group may be protected,<br>
for example, as an acetal (R-CH(OR)2) or ketal (R2C(OR)2), respectively, in which<br>
the carbonyl group (&gt;C=0) is converted to a diether (&gt;C(OR)2), by reaction with,<br>
for example, a primary alcohol. The aldehyde or ketone group is readily<br>
regenerated by hydrolysis using a large excess of water in the presence of acid. An<br>
amine group may be protected, for example, as an amide (-NRCO-R.) or a urethane<br>
(-NRCO-OR), for example, as: a methyl amide (-NHCO-CHs); a benzyloxy amide<br>
(-NHCO-OCH2C6Hs, -NH-Cbz); as at-butoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CH3)3j<br>
-NH-Boc); a2-biphenyl-2-propoxy amide (-NHCO-OCCCBb^CeHAHs, -NHBpoc),<br>
as a 9-fluorenylmethoxy amide (-NH-Fmoc), as a 6-nitroveratryloxy amide<br>
(-NH-Nvoc), as a 2-trimethylsilylethyloxy amide (-NH-Teoc), as a 2,2,2-<br>
trichloroethyloxy amide (-NH-Troc), as an allyloxy amide (-NH-Alloc), or as a<br>
2-(phenylsulphonyl)ethyloxy amide (-NH-Psec). Other protecting groups for<br>
amines, such as cyclic amines and heterocyclic N-H groups, include<br>
toluenesulphonyl (tosyl) and methanesulphonyl (mesyl) groups and benzyl groups<br>
such as a/wra-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group. A carboxylic acid group may be<br>
protected as an ester for example, as: an C1.7 alkyl ester (e.g., a methyl ester; a tbutyl<br>
ester); a C1-7haloalkyl ester (e.g., a C1-7trihaloalkyl ester); a triC1-7 alkylsilyl-<br>
C1-7alkyl ester; or a C5-2oaryl-C1-7 alkyl ester (e.g., a benzyl ester; a nitrobenzyl<br>
ester); or as an amide, for example, as a methyl amide. A thiol group may be<br>
protected, for example, as a thioether (-SR), for example, as: a benzyl thioether; an<br>
acetamidomethyl ether (-S-CH2NHC(=O)CH3).<br>
The 1(H) position of the pyrazole group in the compounds of the formula (I) or its<br>
precursors can be protected by a variety of groups, the protecting group being<br>
selected according to the nature of the reaction conditions to which the group is<br>
exposed. Examples of protecting groups for the pyrazole N-H include<br>
tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl and 4-methoxybenzyl groups.<br>
Many of the chemical Intermediates described above are novel and such novel<br>
intermediates form a further aspect of the invention.<br>
Pharmaceutical Formulations<br>
While it is possible for the active compound to be administered alone, it is<br>
preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical composition (e.g. formulation)<br>
comprising at least one active compound of the invention together with one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, excipients, diluents, fillers, buffers,<br>
stabilisers, preservatives, lubricants, or other materials well known to those skilled<br>
in the art and optionally other therapeutic or prophylactic agents.<br>
Thus, the present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions, as<br>
defined above, and methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising<br>
admixing at least one active compound, as defined above, together with one or<br>
more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, buffers, adjuvants,<br>
stabilizers, or other materials, as described herein.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" as used herein pertains to compounds,<br>
materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound<br>
medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of a subject (e.g.<br>
human) without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or<br>
complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Each carrier,<br>
excipient, etc. must also be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the<br>
other ingredients of the formulation.<br>
Accordingly, in a further aspect, the invention provides compounds of the formula<br>
(I) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein hi the form of pharmaceutical<br>
compositions.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions can be in any form suitable for oral, parenteral,<br>
topical, intranasal, ophthalmic, otic, rectal, intra-vaginal, or transdermal<br>
administration. Where the compositions are intended for parenteral administration,<br>
they can be formulated for intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal,<br>
subcutaneous administration or for direct delivery into a target organ or tissue by<br>
injection, infusion or other means of delivery.<br>
Pharmaceutical fonnulations adapted for parenteral administration include aqueous<br>
and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants,<br>
buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the<br>
blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions<br>
which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may<br>
be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules<br>
and vials, and may be stored in a rreeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only<br>
the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections,<br>
immediately prior to use.<br>
Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile<br>
powders, granules and tablets.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition is in<br>
a form suitable for i.v. administration, for example by injection or infusion.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is in a form<br>
suitable for sub-cutaneous (s.c.) administration.<br>
Pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for oral administration include tablets,<br>
capsules, caplets, pills, lozenges, syrups, solutions, powders, granules, elixirs and<br>
suspensions, sublingual tablets, wafers or patches and buccal patches.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of the formula (I) can be<br>
formulated in accordance with known techniques, see for example, Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA, USA.<br>
Thus, tablet compositions can contain a unit dosage of active compound together<br>
with an inert diluent or carrier such as a sugar or sugar alcohol, e.g. lactose, sucrose,<br>
sorbitol or mannitol; and/or a non-sugar derived diluent such as sodium carbonate,<br>
calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, or a cellulose or derivative thereof such as<br>
methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, and starches such<br>
as corn starch. Tablets may also contain such standard ingredients as binding and<br>
granulating agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, disintegrants (e.g. swellable<br>
crosslinked polymers such as crosslinked carboxymethylcellulose), lubricating<br>
agents (e.g. stearates), preservatives (e.g. parabens), antioxidants (e.g. BHT),<br>
buffering agents (for example phosphate or citrate buffers), and effervescent agents<br>
such as citrate/bicarbonate mixtures. Such excipients are well'known and do not<br>
need to be discussed in detail here.<br>
Capsule formulations may be of the hard gelatin or soft gelatin variety and can<br>
contain the active component in solid, semi-solid, or liquid form. Gelatin capsules<br>
can be formed from animal gelatin or synthetic or plant derived equivalents thereof.<br>
The solid dosage forms (e.g. tablets, capsules etc.) can be coated or un-coated, but<br>
typically have a coating, for example a protective film coating (e.g. a wax or<br>
varnish) or a release controlling coating, The coating (e.g. a Eudragit ™ type<br>
polymer) can be designed to release the active component at a desired location<br>
within the gastro-intestinal tract. Thus, the coating can be selected so as to degrade<br>
under certain pH conditions within the gastrointestinal tract, thereby selectively<br>
release the compound in the stomach or in the ileum or duodenum.<br>
Instead of, or in addition to, a coating, the drug can be presented hi a solid matrix<br>
comprising a release controlling agent, for example a release delaying agent which<br>
may be adapted to selectively release the compound under conditions of varying<br>
acidity or alkalinity in the gastrointestinal tract. Alternatively, the matrix material<br>
or release retarding coating can take the form of an erodible polymer (e.g. a maleic<br>
anhydride polymer) which is substantially continuously eroded as the dosage form<br>
passes through the gastrointestinal tract. As a further alternative, the active<br>
compound can be formulated in a delivery system that provides osmotic control of<br>
the release of the compound. Osmotic release and other delayed release or<br>
sustained release formulations may be prepared in accordance with methods well<br>
known, to those skilled in the art.<br>
Compositions for topical use include ointments, creams, sprays, patches, gels,<br>
liquid drops and inserts (for example intraocular inserts). Such compositions can be<br>
formulated in accordance with known methods.<br>
Compositions for parenteral administration are typically presented as sterile<br>
aqueous or oily solutions or fine suspensions, or may be provided in finely divided<br>
sterile powder form for making up extemporaneously with sterile water for<br>
injection.<br>
Examples of formulations for rectal or irrtra-vaginal administration include<br>
pessaries and suppositories which may be, for example, formed from a shaped<br>
moldable or waxy material containing the active compound.<br>
Compositions for administration by inhalation may take the form of inhalable<br>
powder compositions or liquid or powder sprays, and can be administrated in<br>
standard form using powder inhaler devices or aerosol dispensing devices. Such<br>
devices are well known. For administration by inhalation, the powdered<br>
formulations typically comprise the active compound together with an inert solid<br>
powdered diluent such as lactose.<br>
The compounds of the inventions will generally be presented in unit dosage form<br>
and, as such, will typically contain sufficient compound to provide a desired level<br>
of biological activity. For example, a formulation intended for oral administration<br>
may contain from 1 nanogram to 2 milligrams, for example 0.1 milligrams to 2<br>
grams of active ingredient, more usually from 10 milligrams to 1 gram, e.g. 50<br>
milligrams to 500 milligrams, or 0.1 milligrams to 2 milligrams.<br>
The active compound will be administered to a patient in need thereof (for example<br>
a human or animal patient) in an amount sufficient to achieve the desired<br>
therapeutic effect.<br>
Protein Kinase Inhibitory Activity<br>
The activity of the compounds of the invention as inhibitors of protein kinase A and<br>
protein kinase B can be measured using the assays set forth in the examples below<br>
and the level of activity exhibited by a given compound can be defined in terms of<br>
the IC50 value. Preferred compounds of the present invention are compounds<br>
having an ICso value of less than 1 uM, more preferably less than 0.1 uM, against<br>
protein kinase B.<br>
Therapeutic Uses<br>
Prevention or Treatment of Proliferative Disorders<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) are inhibitors of protein kinase A and protein<br>
kinase B. As such, they are expected to be useful in providing a means of<br>
preventing the growth of or inducing apoptosis of neoplasias. It is therefore<br>
anticipated that the compounds will prove useful in treating or preventing<br>
proliferative disorders such as cancers. In particular tumours with deletions or<br>
inactivating mutations in PTEN or loss of PTEN expression or rearrangements in<br>
the (T-cell lytmphocyte) TCL-1 gene may be particularly sensitive to PKB<br>
inhibitors. Tumours which have other abnormalities leading to an upregulated PKB<br>
pathway signal may also be particularly sensitive to inhibitors of PKB. Examples<br>
of such abnormalities include but are not limited to overexpression of one or more<br>
PI3K subunits, over-expression of one or more PKB isoforms, or mutations in<br>
PI3K, PDK1, or PKB which lead to an increase in the basal activity of the enzyme<br>
in question, or upregulation or overexpression or mutational activation of a growth<br>
factor receptor such as a growth factor selected from the epidermal growth factor<br>
receptor (EGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), platelet derived growth<br>
factor receptor (PDGFR), insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and<br>
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) families.<br>
It is also envisaged that the compounds of the invention will be useful in treating<br>
other conditions which result from disorders in proliferation or survival such as<br>
viral infections, and neurodegenerative diseases for example. PKB plays an<br>
important role in maintaining the survival of immune cells during an immune<br>
response and therefore PKB inhibitors could be particularly beneficial in immune<br>
disorders including autoimmune conditions.<br>
Therefore, PKB inhibitors could be useful in the treatment of diseases in which<br>
there is a disorder of proliferation, apoptosis or differentiation.<br>
PKB inhibitors may also be useful in diseases resulting from insulin resistance and<br>
inscnsitivity, and the disruption of glucose, energy and fat storage such as metabolic<br>
disease and obesity.<br>
Examples of cancers which may be inhibited include, but are not limited to, a<br>
carcinoma, for example a carcinoma of the bladder, breast, colon (e.g. colorectal<br>
carcinomas such as colon adenocarcinoma and colon adenoma), kidney, epidermal,<br>
liver, lung, for example adenocarcinoma, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell<br>
lung carcinomas, oesophagus, gall bladder, ovary, pancreas e.g. exocrine pancreatic<br>
carcinoma, stomach, cervix, endometrium, thyroid, prostate, or skin, for example<br>
squamous cell carcinoma; a hematopoietic tumour of lymphoid lineage, for<br>
example leukaemia, acute lymphocytic leukaemia, B-cell lymphoma, T-cell<br>
lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgldn's lymphoma, hairy cell lymphoma,<br>
or Burkett's lymphoma; a hematopoietic tumour of myeloid lineage, for example<br>
acute and chronic myelogenous leukaemias, myelodysplastic syndrome, or<br>
promyelocytic leukaemia; thyroid follicular cancer; a tumour of mesenchymal<br>
origin, for example fibrosarcoma or habdomyosarcoma; a tumour of the central or<br>
peripheral nervous system, for example astrocytoma, neuroblastoma, glioma or<br>
schwannoma; melanoma; seminoma; teratocarcinoma; osteosarcoma; xenoderoma<br>
pigmentosum; keratoctanthoma; thyroid follicular cancer; or Kaposi's sarcoma.<br>
Thus, in the pharmaceutical compositions, uses or methods of this invention for<br>
treating a disease or condition comprising abnormal cell growth, the disease or<br>
condition comprising abnormal cell growth in one embodiment is a cancer.<br>
Particular subsets of cancers include breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer,<br>
prostate cancer, oesophageal cancer, squamous cancer and non-small cell lung<br>
carcinomas.<br>
A fiirther subset of cancers includes breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer,<br>
endometrial cancer and glioma.<br>
It is also possible that some protein kinase B inhibitors can be used in combination<br>
with other anticancer agents. For example, it may be beneficial to combine of an<br>
inhibitor that induces apoptosis with another agent which acts via a different<br>
mechanism to regulate cell growth thus treating two of the characteristic features of<br>
cancer development. Examples of such combinations are set out below.<br>
Immune Disorders<br>
Immune disorders for which PKA and PKB inhibitors may be beneficial include but<br>
are not limited to autoimmune conditions and chronic inflammatory diseases, for<br>
example systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune mediated glomerulonephritis,<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and autoimmune<br>
diabetes mellitus, Eczema hypersensitivity reactions, asthma, COPD, rhinitis, and<br>
upper respiratory tract disease.<br>
Other Therapeutic Uses<br>
PKB plays a role in apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation and therefore PKB<br>
inhibitors could also be useful in the treatment of the following diseases other than<br>
cancer and those associated with immune dysfunction; viral infections, for example<br>
herpes virus, pox virus, Epstein-Barr virus, Sindbts virus, adenovirus, HIV, HPV,<br>
HCV and HCMV; prevention of ADDS development in HTV-infected individuals;<br>
cardiovascular diseases for example cardiac hypertrophy, restenosis,<br>
atherosclerosis; neurodegenerative disorders, for example Alzheimer's disease,<br>
AIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease, amyotropic lateral sclerosis, retinitis<br>
pigmentosa, spinal muscular attopy and cerebellar degeneration;<br>
glomerulonephritis; myelodysplastic syndromes, ischemic injury associated<br>
myocardial infarctions, stroke and reperfusion injury, degenerative diseases of the<br>
musculoskeletal system, for example, osteoporosis and arthritis, aspirin-sensitive<br>
rhinosinusitis, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, kidney diseases.<br>
Methods of Treatment<br>
It is envisaged that the compounds of the formula (I) will useful in the prophylaxis<br>
or treatment of a range of disease states or conditions mediated by protein kinase A<br>
and/or protein kinase B. Examples of such disease states and conditions are set out<br>
above.<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) are generally administered to a subject in need of<br>
such administration, for example a human or animal patient, preferably a human.<br>
The compounds will typically be administered in amounts that are therapeutically<br>
or prophylactically useful and which generally are non-toxic. However, in certain<br>
situations (for example in the case of life threatening diseases), the benefits of<br>
administering a compound of the formula (1) may outweigh the disadvantages of<br>
any toxic effects or side effects, in which case it may be considered desirable to<br>
administer compounds in amounts that are associated with a degree of toxicity.<br>
The compounds may be administered over a prolonged term to maintain beneficial<br>
therapeutic effects or may be administered for a short period only. Alternatively<br>
they may be administered hi a pulsatile manner.<br>
A typical daily dose of the compound can be in the range from 100 picograms to<br>
100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, typically 10 nanograms to 10<br>
milligrams per kilogram of body weight, more typically 1 microgramto 10<br>
milligrams although higher or lower doses may be administered where required.<br>
Ultimately, the quantity of compound administered will be commensurate with the<br>
nature of the disease or physiologica] condition being treated and will be at the<br>
discretion of the physician.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) can be administered as the sole therapeutic agent<br>
or they can be administered in combination therapy with one of more other<br>
compounds for treatment of a particular disease state, for example a neoplastic<br>
disease such as a cancer as hereinbefore defined. Examples of other therapeutic<br>
agents or treatments that may be administered together (whether concurrently or at<br>
different time intervals) with the compounds of the formula (I) include but are not<br>
limited to:<br>
• Topoisomerase I inhibitors<br>
• AntimetaboJites<br>
• Tubulin targeting agents<br>
• DNA binder and topoisomerase II inhibitors<br>
• Alkylating Agents<br>
• Monoclonal Antibodies.<br>
• Anti-Hormones<br>
• Signal Transduction Inhibitors<br>
• Proteasome Inhibitors<br>
• DNA methyl transferases<br>
• Cytokines and retinoids<br>
• Radiotherapy.<br>
For the case of protein kinase A inhibitors or protein kinase B inhibitors combined<br>
with other therapies the two or more treatments may be given in individually<br>
varying dose schedules and via different routes.<br>
Where the compound of the formula (I) is administered in combination therapy with<br>
one or more other therapeutic agents, the compounds can be administered<br>
simultaneously or sequentially. When administered sequentially, they can be<br>
administered at closely spaced intervals (for example over a period of 5-10 minutes)<br>
or at longer intervals (for example 1,2,3,4 or more hours apart, or even longer<br>
periods apart where required), the precise dosage regimen being commensurate<br>
with the properties of the therapeutic agent(s).<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be administered in conjunction with nonchemotherapeutic<br>
treatments such as radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy, gene<br>
therapy; surgery and controlled diets.<br>
For use in combination therapy with another chemotherapeutic agent, the<br>
compound of the formula (I) and one, two, three, four or more other therapeutic<br>
agents can be, for example, formulated together in a dosage form containing two,<br>
three, four or more therapeutic agents. In an alternative, the individual therapeutic<br>
agents may be formulated separately and presented together in the form of a kit,<br>
optionally with instructions for their use.<br>
A person skilled in the art would know through their common general knowledge<br>
the dosing regimes and combination therapies to use.<br>
Methods of Diagnosis<br>
Prior to administration of a compound of the formula (I), a patient may be screened<br>
to determine whether a disease or condition from which the patient is or may be<br>
suffering is one which would be susceptible to treatment with a compound having<br>
activity against protein kinase A and/or protein kinase B.<br>
For example, a biological sample taken from a patient may be analysed to<br>
determine whether a condition or disease, such as cancer, that the patient is or may<br>
be suffering from is one which is characterised by a genetic abnormality or<br>
abnormal protein expression which leads to up-regulation of PKA and/or PKB or to<br>
sensitisation of a pathway to normal PKA and/orPKB activity, or to upregulation of<br>
a signal transduction component upstream of PKA and/or PKB such as, hi the case<br>
of PKB, P13K, OF receptor and PDK1 &amp; 2.<br>
Alternatively, a biological sample taken from a patient may be analysed for loss of<br>
a negative regulator or suppressor of the PKB pathway such as PTEN. In the<br>
present context, the term "loss" embraces the deletion of a gene encoding the<br>
regulator or suppressor, the truncation of the gene (for example by mutation), the<br>
truncation of the transcribed product of the gene, or the inactivation of the<br>
transcribed product (e.g. by point mutation) or sequestration by another gene<br>
product.<br>
The term up-reguiation includes elevated expression or over-expression, including<br>
gene amplification (i.e. multiple gene copies) and increased expression by a<br>
transcriptional effect, and hyperactivity and activation, including activation by<br>
mutations. Thus, the patient may be subjected to a diagnostic test to detect a<br>
marker characteristic of up-regulation of PKA and/or PKB. The term diagnosis<br>
includes screening. By marker we include genetic markers including, for example,<br>
the measurement of DNA composition to identify mutations of PKA and/or PKB.<br>
The term marker also includes markers which are characteristic of up regulation of<br>
PKA and/or PKB, including enzyme activity, enzyme levels, enzyme state (e.g.<br>
phmphorylated or not) and mRNA levels of the aforementioned proteins.<br>
The above diagnostic tests and screens are typically conducted on a biological<br>
sample selected from tumour biopsy samples, blood samples (isolation and<br>
enrichment of shed tumour cells), stool biopsies, sputum, chromosome analysis,<br>
pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, or urine.<br>
Identification of an individual carrying a mutation in PKA and/or PKB or a<br>
rearrangement of TCL-lor loss of PTEN expression may mean that the patient<br>
would be particularly suitable for treatment with a PKA and/or PKB inhibitor.<br>
Tumours may preferentially be screened for presence of a PKA and/or PKB variant<br>
prior to treatment The screening process will typically involve direct sequencing,<br>
oligonucleotide microarray analysis, or a mutant specific antibody.<br>
Methods of identification and analysis of mutations and up-regulation of proteins<br>
are known to a person skilled in the art. Screening methods could include, but are<br>
not limited to, standard methods such as reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain<br>
reaction (RT-PCR) or in-situ hybridisation.<br>
In screening by RT-PCR, the level of mRNA in the tumour is assessed by creating a<br>
cDNA copy of the mRNA followed by amplification of the cDNA by PCR.<br>
Methods of PCR amplification, the selection of primers, and conditions for<br>
amplification, are known to a person skilled in the art. Nucleic acid manipulations<br>
and PCR are carried out by standard methods, as described for example in Ausubel,<br>
F.M. et al.} eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 2004, John Wiley &amp; Sons<br>
Inc., or Innis, M.A. et-ai, eds. PCR Protocols: a guide to methods and applications,<br>
] 990, Academic Press, San Diego. Reactions and manipulations involving nucleic<br>
acid techniques are also described in Sambrook et al., 2001,3rd Ed, Molecular<br>
Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.<br>
Alternatively a commercially available kit for RT-PCR (for example Roche.<br>
Molecular Biochemicals) may be used, or methodology as set forth in United States<br>
patents 4,666,828; 4,683,202; 4,801,531; 5,192,659,5,272,057, 5,882,864, and<br>
6,218,529 and incorporated herein by reference.<br>
An example of an iu-situ hybridisation, technique for assessing mRNA expression<br>
would be fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) (see Angerer, 1987 Meth.<br>
Enzymol., 152:649).<br>
Generally, in situ hybridization comprises the following major steps: (1) fixation of<br>
tissue to be analyzed; (2) prehybridization treatment of the sample to increase<br>
accessibility of target nucleic acid, and to reduce nonspecific binding; (3)<br>
hybridization of the mixture of nucleic acids to the nucleic acid in the biological<br>
structure or tissue; (4) post-hybridization washes to remove nucleic acid fragments<br>
not bound in the hybridization, and (5) detection of the hybridized nucleic acid<br>
fragments. The probes used in such applications are typically labeled, for example,<br>
with radioisotopes or fluorescent reporters. Preferred probes are sufficiently long,<br>
for example, from about 50,100, or 200 nucleotides to about 1000 or more<br>
nucleotides, to enable specific hybridization with the target nucleic acid(s) under<br>
stringent conditions. Standard methods for carrying out FISH are described in<br>
Ausubel, FM. et al., eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 2004, John<br>

Alternatively, the protein products expressed from the mRNAs may be assayed by<br>
immunohistochemistry of tumour samples, solid phase immunoassay with<br>
microtitre plates, Western blotting, 2-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel<br>
electrophoresis, ELIS A, flow cytometry and other methods known in tiie art for<br>
detection of specific proteins. Detection methods would include the use of site<br>
specific antibodies. The skilled person wiU recognize that all such well-known<br>
techniques for detection of upregulation of PKB, or detection of PKB variants could<br>
be applicable in the present case.<br>
Therefore all of these techniques could also be used to identify tumours particularly<br>
suitable for treatment with PKA and/or PKB inhibitors.<br>
For example, as stated above, PKB beta has been found to be upregulated in 10 -<br>
40% of ovarian and pancreatic cancers (Bellacosa et al 1995, Int. J. Cancer 64,280<br>
- 285; Cheag et al 1996, PNAS 93,3636-3641; Yuan et al 2000, Oncogens 19,<br>
2324 - 2330). Therefore it is envisaged that PKB inhibitors, and in particular<br>
inhibitors of PKB beta, may be used to treat ovarian and pancreatic cancers.<br>
PKB alpha is amplified in human gastric, prostate and breast cancer (Staal 1987,<br>
PNAS 84,5034 - 5037; Sun et al 2001, Am. J, Pathol. 159,431 -437). Therefore it<br>
is envisaged that PKB inhibitors, and in particular inhibitors of PKB alpha, may be<br>
used to treat human gastric, prostate and breast cancer.<br>
Increased PKB gamma activity has been observed in steroid independent breast and<br>
prostate cell lines (Nakatani etal 1999, J. Biol. Chem. 274,21528-21532).<br>
Therefore it is envisaged that PKB inhibitors, and in particular inhibitors of PKB<br>
gamma, may be used to treat steroid independent breast and prostate cancers.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL<br>
The invention will now be illustrated, but not limited, by reference to the specific<br>
embodiments described in the following procedures aad examples.<br>
The starting materials for each of the procedures described below are commercially<br>
available unless otherwise specified.<br>
In the examples, the compounds prepared were characterised by liquid<br>
chromatography, mass spectroscopy and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance<br>
spectroscopy using the systems and operating conditions set out below.<br>
Proton magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV400<br>
instrument operating at 400.l3MHzs in Me-cfj-OD at 27C, unless otherwise stated<br>
and are reported as follows: chemical shift S/ppm (number of protons, multiplicity<br>
where s=singlet, d=doublet, t=triplet, q=quartet, nT=multiplet, br=broad). The<br>
residual protic solvent MeOH (8n = 3.31 ppm) was used as the internal reference.<br>
For the mass spectra, where chlorine is present, the mass quoted for the compound<br>
isfor35Cl.<br>
In each of the examples,, where the compounds are isolated or formed as the free<br>
base, they can be converted into a salt form such as an acetic acid or hydrochloric<br>
acid salt. Conversely, where the compounds are isolated or formed as a salt, the salt<br>
can be converted into the corresponding free base by methods well known to the<br>
skilled person, and then optionally converted to another salt.<br>

To a suspension of 2-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-phenylethyIamme hydrochloride (134 mg,<br>
0.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) (Array PPA-Q02-1) in toluene (0.8 ml) was added bis(tri-tbutylphosphine)<br>
palladium (0) (3 mg, 1 mol%) (Strem) and the mixture was purged<br>
with nitrogen. A suspension of 4-(4,4,5,5-tetamethyl-l)3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-lHpyrazole<br>
(107 mg, 0.55 mmol, 1.1 equiv,) (Aldrich 52,505-7) in ethanol (0.8 ml)<br>
was added followed by potassium carbonate (415 mg, 3.0 mmol, 6 equiv.) in water<br>
(2.5 ml). The mixture was purged with nitrogen and sealed. The reaction mixture<br>
was heated in a CEM Explorer™ microwave to 135 °C for 15 minutes using 50<br>
watts power. The solvents were removed and the residue was partitioned between<br>
ethyl acetate and 2N NaOH. The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate<br>
and the combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried (MgSC&gt;4) and<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude reaction mixture was purified by<br>
column chromatography (SiOj), eluting with a mixture of dichloromethane (90ml):<br>
methanol (18ml): acetic acid (3ml): H20 (2ml) to afford the title compound 14 mg<br>

washed with cold ethanol (6.68 g, 92 %). The crude product (3.45g, 12.14 mmol)<br>
was then dissolved in ethanol (35 ml) and heated to 65 °C. Sodium borohydride<br>
(459 mg, 12.14 mmol) was added in portions and the reaction mixture was<br>
maintained at this temperature for a further 2 hours. Upon cooling, water (10 ml)<br>
was added and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was<br>
partitioned between water (100 ml) and ethyl acetate (100 ml). The organic layer<br>
was separated, dried (MgSC&gt;4), filtered and concentrated to afford the desired<br>

5061-5072 (1999)) but using a fusion protein described as PKB-PIF and described<br>
in full by Yang et al (Nature Structural Biology 9,940 - 944 (2002)). The protein<br>
is purified and activated with PDK1 as described by Yang et al. The peptide<br>
AKTide-2T (H-A-R-K-R-E-R-T-Y-S-F-G-H-H-A-OH) obtained from Calbiochem<br>
(#123900) is used as a substrate. A final concentration of 0.6 nM enzyme is used in<br>
a buffer that includes 20 mM MOPS pH 7.2,30 uM ATP/y33P-ATP and 25 uM<br>
substrate. Compounds are added in DMSO solution to a final DMSO concentration<br>
of 2.5%. The reaction is allowed to proceed for 20 minutes before addition of<br>
excess orthophosphoric acid to quench activity. The reaction mixture is transferred<br>
to a phosphocellulose filter plate where the peptide binds and the unused ATP is<br>
washed away. After washing, scintillant is added and the incorporated activity<br>
measured by scintillation counting.<br>
The % inhibition of the PKB activity is calculated and plotted in order to determine<br>
the concentration of test compound required to inhibit 50% of the PKB activity<br>
(ICso).<br>
Following the protocol described above, the ICso values of the compounds of<br>
Examples 1,4,8-10,12-17,20-23,25-31,33-35,43,44,46,47,49-52,54,56,57,<br>
59,61,63,65,66,69,71-73,76-79,81-87,90,91,94 and 104 have been found to<br>
be less than 1 uM whilst the compounds of Examples 2,3,5, 6,7,11,18,19,24,<br>
32,36,45,48, 53,55,58,60,64,67,68,75,80 and 89 each have IC50 values of less<br>
than 5 uM, and the compounds of Examples 40,41,62 and 70 each have IC50<br>
values of less than 50 uM<br>
