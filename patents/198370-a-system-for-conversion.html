Description of Drawings.<br>
Further objects of the invention will be clear from the following description .The nature of the invention and manner in which it is to be performed will be described in detail in this specification. This description will be with reference to drawings accompanying the specification.<br>
Fig  1  of the drawings shows block diagram various components of the system  for<br>
j conversion of LPG /CNG to automobile fuel.<br>
Fig2. of the drawings shows phase I and II of the pressure reducer according to invention.<br>
Fig3. of the drawings shows Electronic type pressure reducer according to the inventions.<br>
Fig.4 of the drawing shows portions of the pressure reducer.<br><br>
Fig 5.of the drawings shows line diagram of CNG pressure reducer.<br>
The entire system of conversion of LPG /CNG for use as automobile fuel has following components fitted , to form a system. This is shown in Fig. 1 of the drawings. Brief Description of the essential parts of the system and appropriate numeral indicating the parts are shown fig . 1 and referred in the following description.<br>
1.	Vaporizer or pressure reducer:<br>
The vaporizer or pressure reducer reduces the high pressure LPG/CNG (5.5kg/cm2/ . 220kg/cm2) to atmospheric pressure .The pressure reducer converts the liquid phase of LPG to vapor phase by means of bypassing radiator coolant via two hose connections through it.<br>
2.	Electronic relay<br>
A Electronic relay is a device connected to the Electronic switch conveys or sends the message about the running mode of the vehicle (petrol or gas) to the Electronic control module (electronic controlling unit fitted in the car).<br>
3.	Electronics switch<br>
This switch is used for change over purpose. This is also called controller. Because whenever the vehicle is running in gas, one can switch off the petrol button and vice versa for drivers convenience. This electronic switch is positioned near the steering.<br>
4.Tank multi valve<br>
This valve is used for refueling purpose. That JS whenever the gas (LPG) comes to reserve in the LPG tank, this valve enables the refueling process, this valve has got many other features such as Service valve. Excess flow valve. Safety valve. Fusible plug .Due to these multi-operating functions, it is called as Multivalve.<br>
5.Refueling point pipe<br>
This is just like petrol cap - used in petrol tanks.<br>
6.Gas solenoid<br>
Gas solenoid is a device which enables or disables the flow of LPG/CNG through it .The enabling and disabling process is controlled by Electronic switch.<br><br>
7.Mixer<br>
Mixer is used for the mixing of air - fuel ratio in proportionate ratio and passing the same to the carburetor (carburetor vehicle) / injection venturi (injector vehicle) .This equipment also increases the mileage of the vehicle.<br>
The gas inlet generally shown by (fig 2, Numeral 9) .A lever pin (fig 2, Numeral.28) will hold lever for actuation .A lever (fig 2, Numeral.24) is in turn connected to diaphragm called as lst stage diaphragm (fig 2, Numeral.34) which is riveted with a cup washer (fig 2, Numeral.37), above this washer a spring is placed (fig 2, Numeral.26), above the spring a bottom plate (fig 2, Numeral.32) is fixed by means of screws (fig 2, Numeral.33) .The whole assembly is called 1st stage assembly. Whenever the high-pressure gas enters the 1st stage, the lever opens and spring expands. Hence when the pressure is built up inside the 1st stage assembly the spring is compressed and the lever gets locked .At this position the gas rotates inside stage shown as (fig 2, Numeral ,10) in liquid state. A pressure at this state is reduced from 5.5 kg/cm2 to 1kg/ cm2. Hence the liquid state of LPG is converted into vapor state by means of hot radiator line (fig 2, Numeral. 11) .The conversion of LPG from liquid state to gaseous state is enhanced by means of two process. 1. Vacuum creation method. 2.Electronic method.<br>
By Vacuum Creation Method.<br>
In the 2nd stage a special assembly is set for this process (fig .2) .At the center part of the 2nd stage a spring is placed (fig 2, Numeral.27) above which a vacuum diaphragrr (fig 2, Numeral.31) with washer is tightened by means of screws. Above vacuum diaphragm a magnet with a magnet cup set is placed. A lever called as 2nd stage lever (fig 2, Numeral,29) does entire job. One end of the lever is placed at the 2nd stage opening and the other end is connected to a rivet with washer. The riveted to a 2nd stage diaphragm (fig 2, Numeral.30) rests over the magnet cup set. The 2nd stage lever is held by means of lever pin (fig 2, Numeral.28). A vacuum adapter is screwed to the body (fig 2, fig 4 , Numeral. 12), which is in turn connected to the inlet manifold by means of vacuum hose.<br><br>
Whenever the vehicle is cranked the inlet manifold creates suction. This suction enables the vacuum diaphragm to move downwards along with the shrinkage of the front diaphragm. This simulates the movement of both the diaphragm, which enables the lever to move down by means of magnet. At this position the lever opens and the vaporized gas enters the 2nd stage at atmospheric pressure. From there the gas reaches the carburetor/ injection venturi through the passage shown by (fig 2, Numeral. 14). The magnet holds the lever for a momentary period and releases back. The lever reaches its original position. But at this state the engine does not stop, instead runs in idling state. This is a permanent adjustment brought by idling screw (fig 2, Numeral. 13) with a spring inside it and resting above the end of the lever. The spring acts just like a counter weight for the lever to lock to its original position. For the engine to stop, the vacuum diaphragm shall fully close i.e. fully come up, so that the flow of gas is stopped.<br>
By Electronic method.<br>
In this method there is no vacuum diaphragm and instead there is solenoid (fig 3, Numeral 35) fitted with pressure reducer operated electronically. The same operational process is carried out as per 1st stage of vacuum type is concerned .As soon as the ignition key is on, the piston (fig 3, Numeral,36) inside the solenoid opens and gas from the 1st stage enters the 2nd stage immediately, and the vehicle runs in gas (LPG) mode. When the lever is in open condition the 2" stage diaphragm shrinks The lever retains its original position (but not closed) by the help of spring placed inside the idling screw as in the case vacuum creating method. The engine fully stops when the piston inside the solenoid closes.<br>
Compressed Natural Gas:<br>
In this conversion there are three distinct stages namely: (Fig No,5)<br>
1 .1st stage (entering pressure 220kg /cm2 converted to 5.5 kg /cm2)(Fig No.5, Numeral, 16)<br>
2.2nd stage (entering pressure 5.5 kg / cm2 converted to 1 kg /cm2) (Fig No.5, Numeral, 17)<br>
3.3rd   stage (entering pressure 1  kg /cm2 converted to atmospheric pressure) (Fig No.5,<br>
Numeral 18)<br><br>
1st and 2nd stage are lever operated and the 3rd stage is solenoid cum lever-operated .As the<br>
CNG is in vapor state there is no need of radiator line.<br>
Before entering into the 1st stage the gas passes through the following components<br>
1.Brass connector<br>
2. Piston<br><br>
venturi. Electric switch near the steering help in change over from use of petrol to CNG fuel and vice versa.<br>
The gas is being brought by means of piping tubes from solenoid to vaporizer. Drain plug (Fig No.5, Numeral 22) provided to drain waste oil.<br>
This invention includes the following important com}3onents. The manufacturing and testing process are as follows.<br>
1.Pressure reducer<br>
2. Solenoid valve (cut off valve)<br>
3.Choke for gas system.<br><br>
Pressure reducer<br>
Manufacturing process<br>
The raw material used for the production of this equipment is Aluminum Alloy. The<br>
component contained undergoes series of operation for its quality and job perfection. The<br>
operations are stated below.<br>
(i)        Hole clearing (Drilling)<br>
(ii)      Impregnation (for the arrestments of pin holes)<br>
(iii)     Shot blasting (for dust free)<br>
(iv)      Tabbing and facing<br>
(v)       Final operation is washing with kerosene.<br>
Assembling and testing process<br>
After under going the previously stated process the aluminum block is ready for assembling process. The block basically has two stages namely first stage and second stage .The first stage is chamber to which the gas LPG enters with a pressure of 5.5Kg/cm2. After passing the 1st stage the LPG gets reduced to atmospheric pressure, and enters the 2nd stage and then to the carburetor/injection venturi .The gas to the lst stage comes in liquid state and changes to vapor state, this process is enabled by radiator coolant.<br>
Testing process<br>
(i) Water leak test: The pressure reducer block shall posses two passage for the bypassing of radiator coolant .One end of this passage is plugged and held lightly, the pressurized water from the other end is let in and held for a couple of minutes .If there is no leakage traced, it is passed to the next section .If leakage found the bottom cover is tightened accordingly and rechecked.<br>
(ii) Gas locking test: This method is enhanced by introducing a pressurerised air (using air compressor) into the first stage. Diaphragms are used for leak proof<br>
(iii) Vehicle test: The fully assembled and tested kit is once again tested by means fitting it into the vehicle and running it up to 5 to 6 kilometers.<br><br>
Cut off valve (solenoid valve)<br>
Solenoid valve basically is a cut off valve. Here we use two types of solenoids namely petrol<br>
and gas solenoids. When the vehicle is running in petrol the gas solenoid remains closed and<br>
vice versa for the vehicle to run on gas.<br>
Manufacturing process.<br>
The raw materials used for the assembling process are<br>
(i)       MS clamp<br>
(ii)     Mild steel adapter (MS)<br>
(iii)     Brass adaptor<br>
(iv)      Piston<br>
(v)       Coil<br>
(vi)      Spring etc..Hence these materials are machined to their respective dimensions.<br>
Assembling process<br>
The coil is inserted in between a clamp. Then a brass adaptor from one end is inserted into the hole provided in the clamp and coil assembly. From the other side of the hole machined, MS adaptor is coupled with the brass by means of threading one another ,ln between the brass adaptor and MS adaptor, a MS piston is placed with respective springs for opening and closing. Hence the assembled components are known as solenoid valve. Testing process<br>
For checking purpose the solenoid undergoes the release process. To enable this method we use a negative and positive pole extended from step down meter, since the solenoid valve can only withstand 12V capacity (car battery). The valve consists of two terminal one positive and the other negative. These terminals are made to touch their respective poles. Before testing this method the solenoid with its MS adaptor is connected to the compressed air by means of hose. Hence whenever terminals are touched to the respective poles the release occurs with the compressed air coming out and when disconnected air stops. This process occurs due to opening and closing of the piston. Assembling and testing process for gas and petrol solenoids remains the same; only change is the pressure release.<br>
(i)        The pressure release of gas solenoid 8 Kg/cm2.<br>
(ii)      The pressure release for petrol solenoid is 4 Kg/cm2.<br><br>
Choke<br>
In petrol cars the choke is used to avoid starting problem, which is manually operated .In LPG mode, during starting problem the gas choke comes into picture .Gas choke is electrically operated by means of Electronic switch.<br><br>
Manufacturing process<br>
The choke consists of the following materials<br>
(i)	MS rivet<br>
(ii)	Brass piston<br>
(iii)	Coil<br>
(iv)	Spring<br>
(V)	MS cup<br>
The above stated raw materials are machined to their required dimensions. Choke normally is component, which enhances the fuel flow to the carburetor whenever the engine starves to start.<br>
Assembling<br>
Firstly the coil is inserted in the MS cup and then the piston with spring. After this<br>
arrangement the assembly is riveted with MS round rivet. Now the job is ready for checking.<br>
Testing<br>
The choke coil consists of brass pin, which is made positive, and the body is earthed (that is negative). Hence whenever the respective poles are connected and disconnected, the piston happens to reciprocate from its original position. This movement of piston helps the gas to gush quickly into the carburetor whenever the engine starves to start in gas mode.<br><br><br><br>
