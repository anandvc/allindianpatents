It is also an object of the invention to provide distillation assembly with the coolant and fan to chill water circulating in the condenser.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION;<br>
In one of the aspect of the invention the modified distillation assembly is provided in which condenser's inlet and outlet units #re attached with the cooling chamber, which is further provided means for cooling the circulated liquid to chill down to ambient temperature and circulate in condenser. Thus, by circulation of the coolant liquid mostly water is saved from wastage.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION;<br>
Distillation is a method of separating mixture based on differences in their volatilities in a boiling liquid mixture<br>
The device used in distillation, sometimes referred to distillation assembly as consists at a minimum of a reboiler or pot in which the source material is heated, a condenser in which the heated vapour is cooled back to the liquid state and a receiver in which the concentrated or purified liquid, called the distillate, is collected. Several laboratory scale techniques for distillation Simple distillation<br>
In simple distillation, all the hot vapors produced are immediately channeled into a condenser that cools and condenses the vapors. Therefore, the distillate will not be pure - its composition will be identical to the composition of the vapors at the given temperature and pressure,<br><br>
As a result, simple distillation is usually used only to separate liquids whose boiling points differ greatly (rule of thumb is 25 °C),1 or to separate liquids from involatile solids or oils. For these cases, the vapor pressures of the components are usually sufficiently different that Raoult's law may be neglected due to the insignificant contribution of the less volatile component. In this case, the distillate may be sufficiently pure for its intended purpose.<br>
Fractional distillation<br>
For many cases, the boiling points of the components in the mixture will be sufficiently close that Raoult's law must be taken into consideration. Therefore, fractional distillation must be used in order to separate the components well by repeated vaporization-condensation cycles within a packed fractionating column. This separation, by successive distillations, is also referred to as rectification.<br>
As the solution to be purified is heated, its vapors rise to the fractionating column as it rises, it cools, condensing on the condenser walls and the surfaces of the packing material. Here, the condensate continues to be heated by the rising hot vapors; it vaporizes once more. However, the composition of the fresh vapors is determined once again by Raoult's law. Each vaporization-condensation cycle (called a theoretical plate) will yield a purer solution of the more volatile component. In reality, each cycle at a given temperature does not occur at exactly the same position in the fractionating column; theoretical plate is thus a concept rather than an accurate description. Steam distillation<br>
steam distillation is a method for distilling compounds which are heat-sensitive. This process involves using bubbling steam through a heated mixture of the raw material. By Raoult's law, some of the target compound will vaporize (in accordance with its partial pressure). The vapor mixture is cooled and condensed, usually yielding a layer of oil and a layer of water.<br>
Vacuum distillation;<br>
Some compounds have very high boiling points. To boil such compounds, it is often better to lower the pressure at which such compounds are boiled instead of increasing the temperature. Once the pressure is lowered to the<br><br>
vapor pressure of the compound (at the given temperature), boiling and the rest of the distillation process can commence.<br>
From the above discussion it is dear that the distillation process need to maintain the vaporization and condensation temperature in and around the condenser in order to condense the vapour of liquid in to pure form.<br>
The distillation units available at present do not provide means for cooling the condenser liquid mostly water, as a results of this it need to be replaced with the fresh water, so it is necessary to carry the distillation process under the running water,<br>
General set up for the distillation of solvents is as shown in figure 1, which comprises<br>
1: Heat source<br>
2: Still pot<br>
3: Still head<br>
4: Thermometer/Boiling point temperature<br>
5: Condenser<br>
6: Cooling water in<br>
7; Cooling water out<br>
8: Distillate/receiving flask<br>
9: Vacuum/gas inlet<br>
10: Still receiver<br>
11: Heat control<br>
12: Stirrer speed control<br>
13: Stirrer/heat plate<br>
14: Heating (Oil/sand) bath<br>
15: Stirrer bar/anti-bumping granules<br>
16: Cooling bath<br><br>
Almost all the distillation process are time consuming and slow process which requires lot of water, as a results of the conventional methods water is thrown away resulting in wastage of water.<br>
In one of the most important aspect of the invention an improved distillation assembly is provided, the improvement on the condenser column, in which the inlet and out let of the condenser column is attached with the cooling chamber which is provided with the means to cool down the condenser liquid to normal temperature.<br>
In an another aspect of the invention cooling chamber is provided with the motorized fan or radiator which can exchange the heat generated as shown in figure 2. The cooling chamber which stores the circulated coolant till it attend the ambient temperature which then further circulated in the condenser column through inlet and again passed through outlet to the coolant chamber which can be cooled by radiator or motorized fan to ambient temperature.<br>
In one of the aspect of the invention the coolant is the coolant is a fluid which flows through a device to prevent its overheating, transferring the heat produced by the device to other devices that use or dissipate it which includes chemical substance which absorbs heat during the course of distillation to condense the distillate material, the same coolant latter gain reused after cooling down to ambient temperature. The coolant used for are including organic chemicals mainly alkylene glycol alone or with water as the solvent or in combination with water,<br>
Alkylene glycol such as ethylene glycol, di- ethylene glycol, propylene glycol alone or in combination used for the purpose.<br><br>
