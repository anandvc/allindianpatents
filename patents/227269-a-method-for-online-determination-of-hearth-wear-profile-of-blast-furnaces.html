				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for online determination of hearth<br>
wear profile of blast furnaces. The purpose is to determine the state of the<br>
refractory lining, using temperatures measured from the thermocouples<br>
embedded in the hearth refractory lining. The method is applicable to any blast<br>
furnace, as a tool to determine the campaign life as well as a basis for taking<br>
corrective action in the case of detection of large wears.<br>
Temperature sensing probes like thermocouples (US Patent 4,412,090), are<br>
inserted into the body of the refractory lining at the time relining. These probes<br>
are placed circumferentially all around the blast furnace. They are concentrated<br>
in the regions, subject to the maximum wear, guided by experience from<br>
previous relining. Layers of such thermocouples are mounted at various levels of<br>
the hearth.<br>
In this method, the hearth is broken up into a number of angular sectors,<br>
typically 6. The temperature readings of the thermocouples in each sector are<br>
used to carry out a two dimensional axis symmetric finite element analysis. The<br>
temperature readings of thermocouples at the same elevation in a sector are<br>
averaged. The geometry of the finite element mesh is so constructed that the<br>
location of the thermocouples maps to a nodal coordinate of the mesh. In<br>
addition the mesh is so configured, as to follow the geometry of the Blast<br>
Furnace. Boundaries between different refractory materials are accurately<br>
mapped on the mesh edges.<br><br>
A number of mesh elements are identified around a node representing a<br>
temperature sensor. These are so selected as to have the greatest bearing on<br>
the heat flow into the node. The conductivity of these mesh elements is<br>
manipulated. The initial value corresponds to the material property of the<br>
refractory. During operation of the blast furnace, the refractory properties<br>
degrade due to the generation of cracks and chemical processes. In situ<br>
measurement of the conductivity is not feasible. Instead, the conductivity values<br>
are altered in steps, till the calculated temperature matches the average<br>
measured temperature. A 3-months long average is taken, as the refractory<br>
properties are assumed to change slowly. Since the conductivity of one element<br>
affects the heat flow in the entire body, an exact match for all the thermocouples<br>
is not attained. Instead, the process minimizes the root mean square of the<br>
deviation between the calculated and the measured values.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Iron is mostly made through the blast furnace route. The blast furnace<br>
comprises of a steel shell, which is internally lined with refractory bricks. A hot<br>
blast of air flows from an annual pipe known as the bustle main and is directed<br>
through tuyeres into the blast furnace. The iron ore mixed with coke is charged<br>
into the furnace from the top, and is gradually reduced to iron. The temperature<br>
of the liquid iron in blast furnaces approaches 1450Â° C. The refractory lining<br>
serves to hold the hot metal and prevent direct contact with the steel shell. This<br>
is essential, failing which the hot metal is liable to melt the steel shell, and gush<br>
out fatal consequences.<br><br>
During service, the refractory lining gradually wears out. The wear occurs<br>
mostly in the hearth region. This is because the temperatures are highest in<br>
there. The wear occurs due to thermo-mechanical and thermo-chemical stresses<br>
on the refractory lining and due to viscous flow of the hot-metal or dirty hearth.<br>
In addition, if water seeps into the refractory from the cooling staves, then the<br>
refractory bricks become friable and wear out. Maximum wear accours near the<br>
taphole from where the hot metal is tapped.<br>
There are other mechanisms for the hearth wear. Due to unequal thermal<br>
expansion, openings are formed between the refractory bricks and the shell.<br>
These opening might become filled with air and serve to decrease the heat<br>
transfer. The refractory bricks on the hot side adjacent to such gaps serve under<br>
a double disadvantage, namely higher temperatures and lack of mechanical<br>
support that is broken by the gap. The openings in the refractories might also<br>
become filled with hot metal that gradually seeps in through the interstitial<br>
cracks. This would lead to the formation of a local hot spot on the steel shell.<br>
The wear of the refractory brick lining must be closely monitored during the life<br>
of the blast furnace. Localized wear at a few places can generally be patched<br>
with special techniques. In order to do this, the location and extent of the<br>
damage has to be quantified. When the refractories have become generally<br>
debilitated, a decision must be taken to shut down the blast furnace, and<br>
schedule the installation of a new lining.<br>
In case of localized wear, corrective action is undertaken, by mixing additives<br>
such as titanium-carbon-nitride (ileminite) with the blast furnace charge. These<br>
form a coating of titanium precipitate on the refractory material and prevent<br>
further refractory wear. Alternatively, the damaged regions may be repaired by<br><br>
injecting a paste of high conductivity material between the refractory brick and<br>
the metal shell to close the openings, which form between the refractory bricks.<br>
The prime requisite for such repair jobs is that the location of such damaged<br>
regions has to be reliably determined.<br>
The decision as to whether a blast furnace is fit to be kept in operation, is critical<br>
for a steel mill. Cost and safely are two conflicting goals that have to be<br>
judiciously balanced. Relining a blast furnace is an expensive proposition,<br>
because apart from the expensive refractory bricks, the loss of production for the<br>
duration affects the economics of the steel mill. A longer campaign life spreads<br>
the relining cost over a greater period, and increases the productivity achieved<br>
from the furnace. The state of the hearth determines the life of the blast<br>
furnace, as most of the refractory wear occurs in this region. The blast furnace<br>
may be kept in operation only if the remaining hearth refractory lining is of<br>
sufficient width. Otherwise accidents, known as Breakout can occur, where the<br>
hot metal in the belly of the furnace spouts through an opening the refractories,<br>
punctures the steel shell and causes fatalities among the workers.<br>
Direct measurement of the refractory erosion is generally carried out by<br>
positioning detection devices in the refractory lining of metallurgical vessels, such<br>
as ladles. The device comprises metal or ceramic rods positioned in the upper or<br>
outer portions of the refractory bodies with their inner ends spaced from the<br>
opposite surfaces of the refractory body. The molten metal introduced into the<br>
metallurgical vessels erodes the refractory bodies and the rod simultaneously.<br>
The complete erosion and absence of the metal rods indicates a predetermined<br>
safety level thickness of the remaining refractory bodies and signals the need of<br>
replacement of the lining.<br><br>
A refractory erosion indicator gauge for use in blast furnaces and other<br>
equipment is also available. The erosion indicator comprises a structural plate<br>
member having a preferably triangular configuration. The member is welded<br>
within the refractory lining of the equipment in which it is employed.<br>
These gauges must be introduced at the time of relining itself. The plate<br>
members are welded to the blast furnace shell before the refractory lining is<br>
installed or alternatively, it may be integrated within the refractory lining per se<br>
and secured to the shell with the refractory. As the new refractory surface wears<br>
or erosion takes place, the exposed portion of the triangle is determinative of the<br>
remaining actual thickness of the refractory lining or the amount of lining eroded<br>
away, depending on the orientation of the plate.<br>
This permits determination of the remaining refractory life. Thus, the time for<br>
replacement of the refractory can be determined by visible observation of the<br>
indicators in the internal lining of the equipment. The problem is that all such<br>
direct measurement devices, require a clear view into the belly of the furnace<br>
through specially designed peepholes. Alternatively, the wear of the bar and the<br>
lining may be detected ultrasonically by generating ultrasonic pulses in the bar<br>
and detecting the reflection of the pulses from the worn inner end of the bar (US<br>
Patent No. 4,510,793). All these methods comprise time consuming and<br>
laborious tasks and are rarely practical.<br>
To obtain the state of wear, indirect measurement are used as there is no<br>
convenient method to directly monitor the left out thickness of the refractories,<br>
on a continuing basis. An indirect measure of the state of the worn profile, can<br>
be obtained from temperature measurements. A high value of the temperature<br>
at a location, indicates proximity to the hot metal and corresponds to larger<br><br>
refractory wear. This provides a qualitative understanding of the state of the<br>
refractory profile. Also, a high temperature difference from the cooling plates is<br>
representative of hearth wear. But the state of the furnace can only be guessed<br>
on the basis of above information.<br>
Quantitative estimates of the refractory wear can be made from "dual<br>
thermocouples", as practiced in Japanese steel companies [Nippon Steel].<br>
However these require a multiplicity of thermocouples, where 2 or 3<br>
thermocouples are placed "in line". In such installations, several thermocouples<br>
are placed at the same radial and elevation locations, but a different insertion<br>
depths. Typically one in the refractory lining, another following in the same bore<br>
but at a smaller insertion depth and a third also placed inline but located in the<br>
outer steel shell (JP 1290709).<br>
A group of such thermocouples are placed in the vicinity of the tap hole. A<br>
second group of thermocouples in placed vertically above the first group, at an<br>
elevation above the top surface of the hearth pad. A third group of<br>
thermocouples is placed in the same common vertical section as the first two<br>
groups, but at the corner junction of hearth sidewall and the hearth pad. Heat<br>
transfer calculations are used to calculate the refractory temperature<br>
distributions and then later compared with the measured temperatures to<br>
estimate the remaining refractory and skull thickness. It will be appreciated that<br>
such extensive instrumentation is a costly affair.<br>
US Patent No. 5,975,754 documents the use of one and two dimensional finite<br>
element models, based on the thermocouple readings on a vertical plane to<br>
determine, solidified metal skull lining thickness as well as the brick thickness.<br>
But in all such previous descriptions, they have made use of inline [dual]<br>
thermocouples installed at definite locations (JP 1290709). The present method<br><br>
also uses thermocouple temperatures to determine skull thickness as well as<br>
worn refractory lining but the locations for thermocouples are not so stringent.<br>
It is preferable to have more thermocouples installed in a region of larger wear,<br>
but there is no constraint that a set thermocouples must be placed inline.<br>
In the prior art, the temperature differences between a set of inline<br>
thermocouples, is used in a one dimensional finite element model to derive the<br>
location of the solidification line [1050Â° C] and the boundary condition on the hot<br>
metal side is accordingly modified. This modified boundary condition is then<br>
used in a two dimensional finite element model.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The proposed method circumvents the difficulty of requiring numerous<br>
thermocouples. Instead, it works with the data from the thermocouples already<br>
installed. Naturally, providing additional inputs from more probes will enhance<br>
the accuracy of predictions, but it can still provide meaningful results from the<br>
currently installed thermocouples.<br>
The present invention also relates to a two-stage process. But it uses a two<br>
dimensional finite element analysis in both stages. In the first stage, the<br>
conductivities of selected elements are modified and in the following stage the<br>
boundary temperatures on the hot metal side are modified, to obtain the best<br>
RMS fit with the measured temperatures. Because of this process, the maximum<br>
difference between the calculated and measured temperatures can be<br>
constrained within 10Â° C and provide reliable estimates of the worn refractory<br>
lining profile.<br><br>
A further advantage is that, since a one-dimensional finite element analysis is not<br>
resorted to, there is no requirement of inline thermocouples. The systems in the<br>
prior art were constrained by the necessity of inline thermocouples, which<br>
formed the starting point of the analysis. Retro fitting of inline thermocouples in<br>
an operating blast furnace is troublesome and expensive. And even in new<br>
relinings, installation of multiple thermocouples in the same borehole, adds<br>
substantially to the expenses. There is the additional problem, that if either<br>
thermocouple of the pair burns out, the data from the other cannot be used.<br>
The proposed method makes use of all the data from the available sensors, even<br>
from the one functioning sensor of a pair of inline thermocouples where the<br>
other of the pair has been damaged. It works with the data from already<br>
installed sensors, and does not call for the installation of new sets of<br>
thermocouples at particular locations, which might be inaccessible because of<br>
problems of fouling with other equipment.<br>
A further advantage is that, the readings form thermocouples tend to fluctuate<br>
because of instrument errors. Since the proposed method uses a two-<br>
dimensional finite element analysis consistently, the measured temperatures in<br>
the vicinity guide the calculated heat flow pattern at any point. In this way,<br>
random instrument errors are automatically compensated, since all the measured<br>
values are simultaneously considered while arriving at the predicted heat flow at<br>
all the nodes of the mesh.<br>
This invention provides a method of estimating the remaining refractory lining of<br>
a blast furnace hearth by analyzing the temperatures of embedded<br>
thermocouples. The temperature probes do not need to be in any particular<br>
alignment (as in in-line thermocouples). The temperature probes may be<br><br>
embedded at convenient locations circumferentially around the blast furnace<br>
hearth, at suitable elevations and insertion depths. Although this method can<br>
work with a few thermocouples, the larger the number of sensors the greater is<br>
the fidelity of the estimate of refractory wear. The measured temperatures are<br>
used to determine the average temperature readings [3-month average]. In the<br>
first stage the conductivity's of elements in the vicinity of the temperature<br>
recorders are modified, and a finite element analysis using a 2-Dimensional<br>
model is carried out to calculate the temperature filed. The calculated<br>
temperatures at the locations of the recorders are compared with the measured<br>
average values. This is an iterative procedure, and terminates with a close<br>
match between the calculated and the measured average values. The<br>
conductivity adjustments are performed with a gradient search method. The<br>
termination criteria are respect to the maximum number of iterations as well as a<br>
specified maximum limit on the RMS deviation between calculated and measured<br>
values.<br>
In the second stage, proceeding from the modified conductivities, the<br>
temperatures at the hot metal interface are progressively altered. This again is<br>
an iterative procedure similar to the one outlined above, except that it is the<br>
boundary temperatures, which are now being adjusted. The objective is to<br>
match the calculated values of the temperature field at the sensor locations with<br>
the current measured temperatures. The process terminates when the RMS<br>
deviation with the measured current temperatures decreases below a preset<br>
threshold, or after a specified maximum number of iterations.<br><br>
This 2 stage iterative procedure ensures a good match between the calculated<br>
and measured values [typically a maximum deviation of 6Â°C]. Finally, the<br>
modified conductivities and the modified boundary temperature at the hot metal<br>
interface, are used to locate the solidification isotherm [1150Â° C]. This is<br>
considered to represent the hearth wear profile.<br>
Thus the application provides a method for estimating wear profile of refractory<br>
lining of a blast furnace hearth, comprising the steps of providing a plurality of<br>
probes at various locations circumferentially around the blast furnace hearth,<br>
adjusting the conductivity of the elements in specified regions for matching the<br>
calculated temperature with the average temperature measured over a period of<br>
time, adjusting the boundary temperatures of nodes at hot metal interface for<br>
matching the calculated temperature with the instantaneous measured<br>
temperature; and analyzing the measured temperatures from said plurality of<br>
probes to estimate the solidification isotherm utilizing numerical methods for<br>
obtaining solidus contour periodically thereby wear contour in the hearth region.<br>
The method operates in two stages. First, the conductivity of the elements in<br>
specified regions is adjusted, so that he calculated temperatures match the<br>
average measured temperatures, averaged over 3 months. The modified<br>
conductivity values provide an indication of the formation of openings in the<br><br>
refractories as well as documenting the degradation of the refractory qualities in<br>
particular regions. Repair work can then be undertaken in those regions. In the<br>
following stage, the boundary temperatures of nodes at the hot metal interface<br>
are adjusted so that the calculated temperatures match the instantaneous<br>
measured temperatures. The1150Â° C temperature contour, with these adjusted<br>
conductivity's and boundary temperatures, is taken to represent the wear profile<br>
inclusive of the skull. By substituting the instantaneous temperatures with the<br>
maximum temperatures than have been recorded during the operation of the<br>
blast furnace, the refractory wear profile can be estimated. The radial difference<br>
between these two wear lines indicates the depth of skull formation.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The standard finite element technique, uses a known geometry, element<br>
properties and specified boundary conditions (nodes with known temperature /<br>
heat flux), and solves for the unknown temperatures and heat fluxes. This is<br>
done through standard numerical techniques. In the case of this problem, the<br>
predicted temperatures from finite element analysis will differ from the measured<br><br>
thermocouples temperature readings. This is because, the boundary conditions<br>
are altered by the lining wear. By using the steepest descent method, the<br>
conductivities of selected elements and the temperature of selected boundary<br>
nodes are adjusted. The finite element analysis is repeated iteratively. This<br>
continues till convergence with all the measured temperatures and the current<br>
wear profile is estimated.<br>
The objective of this invention is to determine the solidification isotherm, at<br>
1150Â° C, on a continuing basis using temperatures from the hearth<br>
thermocouples [Fig.1.]. This can be done by solving a heat transfer problem.<br>
The finite element technique, which can be used for such a solution, is a<br>
standard method, and commercial programs are available for the purpose.<br>
However the solution methodology for this problem, requires an iterative search<br>
with modification of the boundary conditions at each iteration. No commercial<br>
program exists for this purpose. This necessitated the development of an<br>
independent finite element analysis software, which incorporates the requisite<br>
additional features.<br>
A finite element model for the hearth is constructed and the mesh is drawn such<br>
that the nodes coincide with the thermocouples [Fig.2]. The temperature data is<br>
taken from the thermocouples embedded in the refractory at various locations in<br>
radial directions and across the thickness of the refractory lining of the hearth.<br>
These probes need not be in a fixed plane or at stipulated locations. Hence this<br>
method can be applied using existent hearth thermocouples, without the need<br>
for enhancing the instrumentation. The hearth geometry is modeled as a set of<br>
independent vertical sections. For this purpose, the hearth zone is divided into a<br>
number of sectors, as per the need of sensitivity.<br><br>
Typically 6 sectors have been found to be sufficient, but additional sectors may<br>
be configured (Fig.3.). A zero line on the periphery is selected to identify these<br>
sections distinctly as per their angular distance from the zero-line on the<br>
periphery. Typically this zero-line is taken as the centerline between tapholes of<br>
the furnace.<br>
The data from thermocouples in a particular section is considered to determine<br>
the wear for that section. The data is captured through a TDC and fed into the<br>
analysis package through a pre-processor software. Although the heat flow is<br>
really a 3 Dimensional solid body problem, it is assumed that temperature values<br>
in one sector are predicated on the wear in that sector, and have no influence on<br>
an adjacent sector.<br>
The existing thermocouples are grouped into a number of sectors [say 6], and all<br>
thermocouples in a specific sector [say between 330 and 30 deg], are assumed<br>
to provide temperatures of the central vertical section in the sector [in this case<br>
at 0 deg]. In case there are more than one thermocouple at the same elevation<br>
and insertion depth in a sector, the arithmetic average of these thermocouple<br>
readings, is taken as representative of a point in the sector, at elevation and<br>
insertion depth [Fig.3.].<br>
The output comprises of an estimate of the thickness of the left out lining<br>
[including the skull]. During actual furnace operation, the estimate of the<br>
distance between the wear line and the inner surface of the blast furnace metal<br>
shell, provides a key input regarding the condition of the blast furnace. The life<br>
of the refractory lining of the furnace hearth may be extended by maintaing a<br>
sufficient thickness of the protective layer of solidified metal skull during<br>
operation of the furnace.<br><br>
The input data that is required for such analysis is captured in two phases. First<br>
the average temperatures recorded by each temperature probe over the past 3<br>
months period are considered. The history of temperature readings of ail the<br>
thermocouples is stored in a computer database. This is accessed and the<br>
average temperature values are extracted. These values are required in order to<br>
adjust the conductivities and tune the model and is performed in a process called<br>
Conductivity Adjust. In the second phase, the current temperature data is taken<br>
for adjusting the boundary nodal temperatures. This process is called<br>
Temperature Adjust. Finally the soildication isotherm is estimated and this gives<br>
the wear profile for the time period under consideration.<br>
CONDUCTIVITY ADJUST<br>
The hearth of the method comprises the estimation of the conductivities of<br>
selected elements [Fig.4]. Starting from the known thermal conductivity<br>
properties of the several refractories comprising the lining, the conductivities of<br>
selected elements close to the outer steel shell of the blast furnace are iteratively<br>
adjust. This results in calculated temperatures at the thermocouples locations,<br>
which is close to the measured averages.<br>
The logic of this operation is that the heat flow from the interior of the blast<br>
furnace outwards to the steel shell and thence to the cooling water can become<br>
impeded because of flaws developing in the refractories. These flaws can take<br>
of gaps forming at the interface between the outer surface of the refractories<br>
and the inner surface of the blast furnace steel shell. Or there might be<br>
impediments in the flow of the cooling water contacting the outer surface of the<br>
blast furnace steel shell. In both these cases, as the heat flow is impeded, the<br>
measured thermocouple temperatures will tend to rise. Alternatively, the gaps<br><br>
might become filled with solidified hot metal, seeping into these spaces from the<br>
interior of the furnace, and subsequently solidifying. In such cases, the<br>
measured temperatures will tend to be higher, as the solidified metal will<br>
conduct heat more quickly, out to the steel shell. These effects are simulated in<br>
the s/w by adjusting [decreasing or increasing] the thermal conductivity<br>
coefficients of the mesh blocks in the vicinity of the thermocouples which have a<br>
different temperature as compared to the steady state temperatures predicted<br>
from the known thermal conductivities of the refractories. Internal cracks in the<br>
refractories, present another problem. Such cracks would become filled with hot<br>
metal from the interior of the blast furnace and would result in substantially<br>
raising the temperatures of the thermocouples tailing such fissures.<br>
The mapping of the finite element mesh blocks with the appropriate<br>
thermocouples has to be specified in a separate data file. The entries into this<br>
data file have to be manually specified, based on an understanding of the<br>
process of heat flow [Fig. 4]. When the mapping has been done satisfactorily,<br>
the software-adjusted conductivities will result in a temperature filed that<br>
matches the measured average values. Since such flaws in the refractories have<br>
long lasting consequences, they are derived from average measured<br>
temperatures, averaged over a reasonably long time span [3-months].<br>
The following notations are defined:<br>
VALUE= Measured value from the thermocouple at that node<br>
VALJNL= Calculated temperature of a node with thermocouples<br>
ELMTEM= Calculated temperature of an element, by averaging the nodal<br>
temperatures<br>
VAL12=Specified conductivity of the element<br>
VALRSL= Modified conductivity of the element<br>
FACTOR= Ratio of VALRSL/VAL12<br><br>
Two situations can arise.<br>
If the element is not contiguous with the thermocouple node, then the element<br>
conductivity is modified by the factor<br>
FACTOR==VALUE/VALJNL; when ELMTEM.GT.VALJNL<br>
And<br>
FACTOR=VALJNL/VALUE; when ELMTEM.LE.VALJNL<br>
If the element is contiguous with the thermocouple node, then the element<br>
conductivity is modified by a factor that considers the influence of all the nodes<br>
of element. The following terms are defined:<br>
TMS[3,3]= Influence matrix of the nodes of the element. In case of<br>
quadrilateral elements, the element is broken into the constituent triangles and<br>
the operation is executed for the individual triangles in sequential passes.<br>
SUMHTF= Heat transfer factor for the node in question<br>
SUMRQD= Required heat transfer factor to match the measured temperature.<br><br><br>
Certain minimum (MNCNAD) and maximum [MXCNAD] conductivity check values<br>
are also defined. If the calculated value is outside these limits, the modified<br>
value is constrained to the limit.<br>
IF (VALRSL.GT.MXCNAD)VALRSL=MXCNAD<br>
IF (VALRSL.LT.MNCNAD)VALRSL=MNCNAD<br>
After calculating the adjusted conductivity's at each location, they may be used<br>
for further decision-making, such as to indicate the presence of a gap between<br>
the shell and the hearth brickwork [Fig 8).<br>
Corrective action may then be taken to fill the gap e.g. with a high conductivity<br>
grout material to re-establish contact with the cooled shell. Since the s/w<br>
modifies the conductivities of the mapped blocks iteratively, the conductivity<br>
values lie in a continuous spectrum. These values would result in the best match<br>
of the measured average temperatures. The adjusted conductivities are written<br>
to a file, and may also be graphically displayed as contours of the conductivities.<br>
Sharp changes in the adjusted conductivities are displayed as a band of dense<br>
closed contours and indicate locations where repair work should be targeted<br>
[e.g. carbon paste injection].<br>
Maintaing a protective layer implies an adequate heat transfer form the<br>
refractory hearth walls to the metal shell of the furnace hearth and from the<br>
metal shell to the cooling water applied to the metal shell. Maintaining adequate<br>
heat transfer would imply the thermal conductivity's lying in a suitable band from<br>
the initial refractory conductivities. Conductivities lower than a specified<br>
minimum value can be used to determine if a gap has formed between the<br>
refectory and the metal shell. The preset limit typically may be selected from<br>
within a range of [-50% to -100%]. Conductivities higher than a specified<br>
maximum [+50%+100%] may be compared to determine if a build-up on the<br>
shell has occurred.<br><br>
The presence of a build-up on the furnace shell would result in turbulent water<br>
cooling on the shell, and would be indicated by low average temperatures of the<br>
thermocouples, which would be manipulated by the s/w to indicate higher<br>
conductivities in the associated mapped blocks. Once the problem areas are<br>
identified, corrective action may be concentrated in such regions. This might<br>
comprise sand blasting the surface of the shell in the specified location to<br>
remove incipient build up. Alternatively problems in the water flow system may<br>
be pinpointed such as increase temperature of the feed water or choking of the<br>
flow, once the region has been identified.<br>
Next the boundary temperatures in the interior of the blast furnace are<br>
considered. These are initially considered to be at 1500Â° C. The temperatures at<br>
the nodes of this internal boundary are then altered in successive iterations<br>
[Figs.5]. The temperature field is evaluated after every iteration by using a 2<br>
dimensional finite element model, and the RMS of the divergence with the<br>
measured values is calculated. The moving boundary calculation is terminated<br>
when the RMS of the divergence after having reduced in stages, commences to<br>
increase.<br>
The following notations are defined:<br>
VALI2= Measured value from the thermocouples at that node<br>
VALJNL= Calculated temperature of a node with thermocouples<br>
VALUE= Temperature at the boundary node as modified in the previous iteration<br>
VALRSL= Modified temperature at the boundary node in the current iteration<br>
VALRSL=VALI2/VALJNL*VALUE<br><br>
Certain minimum [MNTMAD] and maximum [MXTNAD] temperature check values<br>
are also defined. If the calculated value is outside these limits, the modified<br>
value modified value is constrained to the limit.<br>
IF (VALRSL.GT.MXTMAD) VALRSL=MXTMAD<br>
IF (VALRSL.LT.MNTMAD) VALRSL=MNTMAD<br>
After having computed the modified element conductivities and the boundary<br>
temperatures, the contour representing the 1500Â° C solidification isotherm is<br>
derived. This is taken to represent the lining profile in the operating blast<br>
furnace [Fig 6+7].<br>
The contour of the specification line provides valuable information. If the<br>
estimated left out refractory thickness decreases below a safe limit, remedial<br>
actions are required. This generally takes the form of increasing the formation<br>
of a protective skull over the worn refractory lining. The charging of ileminite<br>
together with the blast furnace charge encourages skull formation. If all else<br>
fails, the last option is to choke the hot blast flow in the tuyeres lying in that<br>
vertical section. This constrains the production, but the temperatures have to be<br>
reduced to avoid the chance of break out accidents.<br>
The procedure that has been outlined above is carried out with the current<br>
temperatures as measured by the embedded thermocouples. The solidification<br>
isotherm is interpreted as the wear profile including the skull formation at the<br>
hot metal interface.<br>
The temperature Adjust procedure is repeated with the maximum of the<br>
recorded temperatures. The temperature data from all the thermocouples is<br>
archived in a computer database. This archive is accessed to ascertain the<br>
maximum-recorded temperatures during the history of operation. When these<br>
maximum temperatures are used, the solidification isotherm is interpreted as the<br>
wear profile of the refractory lining [no skull formation].<br><br>
Thus two distinct solidification lines are found, one of which is closer to the<br>
centerline representing the current skull and the other representing a hotter<br>
condition and being pushed further outwards, which represents the wear on the<br>
refractory lining. The distance between the two represents the thickness of the<br>
solidified skull. Skull formation is intrinsic to blast furnaces. They cause<br>
problems in the smooth decent of the burden and decrease the workings<br>
volume. But they have a beneficial aspect as well in that they protect the<br>
refractory lining and extend its life. During operation of blast furnaces, the skull<br>
formation cannot be directly viewed. The method outlined here provides a<br>
means of estimating the skull formation and provides an insight into the blast<br>
furnace.<br><br>
