The prior art processes have following drawbacks:<br>
1. The processes use chemicals such as butyl lithium, lithium aluminum hydride, methoxy-diethylborane which are costly and difficult to handle and therefore make the process difficult.<br>
All known process are however involves large number of synthetic steps resulting in low over all yields.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a novel 3-tetrahydro-2H-2-pyranyloxy-5-(tert.butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(1S,3R,5R)-cyclohexan-1-ol useful as an intermediate for 6-hydroxymethyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(4R,6S)-tetrahydro-2H-2-pyranone.<br>

preparation of 6-hydroxymethyl-4-(tert.butyldimethyl silyloxy)-(4R,  6S)-tetrahydro-<br>
 2H-2-pyranone(1) which obviates the drawbacks of the prior art proceses and use<br>
cheaper and easily accessible chemicals.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a<br>
novel   3-hydroxy-5-(tert.butyldimethyl   silyloxy)-(3S,5R)-cyclohexan-1-one   having<br>
formula 9<br>

Preparation     of    3-tetrahydro-2H-2-pyranyloxy-5-(tert.butyldimethylsilyloxy)-<br>
(3.R,5R)-cyclohexan-l-one<br>
3-tetrahydro-2H-2-pyranyloxy-5-(tert.butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(l.S',3R,5R)cyclohexan-l-ol ( 2.85 parts, 8.38 mmol) was dissolved in dry dichloromethane (25 parts) under argon atmosphere. To it, anhydrous sodium acetate (0.2 part, 2.6 mmol) and pyridinium chlorochromate (13 part, 2.6 mmol) were added in one portion and the mixture was stirred under argon atmosphere for 8 hr. Then reaction mixture was diluted with diethyl ether (30 parts) and stirred well. The solution was decanted and the remaining black tar was extracted with diethyl ether (13 x 15 parts). Organic layers were combined and were filtered through small ceilite bed. Then, the organic layer was washed with water (3 x 20 parts) followed by brine wash. Then it was dried on anhydrous sodium sulfate and solvent was removed under vacuum. Residue was purified by flash column chromatography. Yield of 3-tetrahydro-2H-2-pyranyloxy-5-(tert.butyldimethylsilyl oxy)-(3R,5R)-cyclohexan-l-one (8, 2.24 parts, 80%).<br>

Preparation   of  3-hydroxy-5-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(3S,5R)-cyclohexan-l-<br>
one ( 9)<br>
3-tetrahydro-2H-2-pyranyloxy-5-(tert.butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(3R,5R)-cyclohexan-l-one (8- 1 part, 2.959 mmol) was placed in 50 parts two necked round bottom flask equipped with two-way stopcock and rubber septum. Flask was evacuated and flushed with argon. To it, dry ether (10 parts) was added and the resulting solution was stirred vigorously. To the stirred solution magnesium bromide etherate (2.3 parts, 8.9 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred for 10 hr. The reaction mixture was cooled in ice-bath and reaction was quenched by adding saturated ammonium chloride solution. Both the layers were separated. Aqueous layer was extracted with ether (2x10 parts). Organic layers were combined and washed with brine. Then it was dried on anhydrous sodium sulfate and solvent was removed under vacuum. Residue was purified to yield 3-hydroxy-5-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(35,5R)-cyclohexan-1 -one (9, 0.67 parts, 89%).<br>
