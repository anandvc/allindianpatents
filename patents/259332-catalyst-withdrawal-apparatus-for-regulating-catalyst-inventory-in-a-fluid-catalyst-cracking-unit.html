CATALYST WITHDRAWAL APPARATUS AND METHOD<br>
FOR REGULATING CATALYST INVENTORY IN A FLUID<br>
CATALYST CRACKING UNIT<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] Embodiments of the invention generally relate to a catalyst<br>
withdrawal apparatus and method for regulating catalyst inventory in a fluid<br>
catalytic cracking catalyst unit.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002] Figure 1 is a simplified schematic of a conventional fluid catalytic<br>
cracking system 130. The fluid catalytic cracking system 130 generally includes<br>
a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit 110 coupled to a catalyst injection system<br>
100, a petroleum feed stock source 104, an exhaust system 114 and a<br>
distillation system 116. One or more catalysts from the catalyst injection<br>
system 100 and petroleum from the petroleum feed stock source 104 are<br>
delivered to the FCC unit 110. The petroleum and catalysts are reacted in the<br>
FCC unit 110 to produce a vapor that is collected and separated into various<br>
petrochemical products in the distillation system 116. The exhaust system 114<br>
is coupled to the FCC unit 110 and is adapted to control and/or monitor the<br>
exhausted byproducts of the fluid cracking process.<br>
[0003] The FCC unit 110 includes a regenerator 150 and a reactor 152.<br>
The reactor 152 primarily houses the catalytic cracking reaction of the<br>
petroleum feed stock and delivers the cracked product in vapor form to the<br>
distillation system 116. Spend catalyst from the cracking reaction is transfer<br>
from the reactor 152 to the regenerator 150 where the catalyst is rejuvenated<br>
by removing coke and other materials. The rejuvenated catalyst is reintroduced<br>
into the reactor 152 to continue the petroleum cracking process. By-products<br>
from the catalyst rejuvenation are exhausted from the regenerator 150 through<br>
an effluent stack of the exhaust system 114.<br>
1<br><br>
Date of Deposit: 14 July 2006	Attorney Docket No. CAT/013PCT<br>
Express Mail Label: EV840619730US<br>
[0004] The FCC unit 110 includes a catalyst injection system 100 that<br>
maintains a continuous or semi continuous addition of fresh catalyst to the<br>
inventory circulating between the regenerator 150 and the reactor 152. The<br>
catalyst injection system 100 includes a main catalyst source 102 and one or<br>
more additive sources 106. The main catalyst source 102 and the additive<br>
source 106 are coupled to the FCC unit 110 by a process line 122. A fluid<br>
source, such as a blower or air compressor 108, is coupled to the process line<br>
122 and provides pressurized fluid, such as air, that is utilized to carry the<br>
various powdered catalysts from the sources 102, 106 through the process line<br>
122 and into the FCC unit 110.<br>
[0005] One or more controllers 120 is/are utilized to control the amounts of<br>
catalysts and additives utilized in the FCC unit 110. Typically, different<br>
additives are provided to the FCC unit 110 to control the ratio of product types<br>
recovered in the distillation system 116 (i.e., for example, more LPG than<br>
gasoline) and to control the composition of emissions passing through the<br>
exhaust system 114, among other process control attributes. As the controller<br>
120 is generally positioned proximate the catalyst sources 106, 102 and the<br>
FCC unit 110, the controller 120 is typically housed in an explosion-proof<br>
enclosure to prevent spark ignition of gases which may potentially exist on the<br>
exterior of the enclosure in a petroleum processing environment.<br>
[0006] During processing, there is a dynamic balance of the total catalyst<br>
within the FCC unit. As discussed above, catalyst is periodically added utilizing<br>
a catalyst injection system. During the cracking process, some catalyst is lost<br>
through the distillation system 116, while some catalyst is lost through the<br>
effluent exiting the regenerator 150. The addition rate required to maintain a<br>
desired level of catalytic activity sometimes matches the loss rate through<br>
attrition, and in this case, there is no need for corrective measures.<br>
[0007] If the amount of catalyst within the FCC unit diminishes over time,<br>
the performance and desired output of the FCC unit will diminish, and the FCC<br>
unit will become inoperable. Conversely, if the catalyst inventory in the FCC<br>
unit increases over time, the catalyst bed level within the regenerator reaches<br>
an upper operating limit, necessitating a small catalyst withdrawal to prevent<br>
2<br><br>
Date of Deposit: 14 July 2006	Attorney Docket No. CAT/013PCT<br>
Express Mail Label: EV840619730US<br>
unacceptably high catalyst emissions into the flue gas stream, or other process<br>
upsets.<br>
[0008] Catalyst withdrawal systems are normally sized for the most<br>
demanding operating case, which is when the entire catalyst inventory is<br>
removed during a short period of time when the FCC unit is shut down. The<br>
periodic operational-type catalyst withdrawals for level control addressed by this<br>
invention can take place once a day, once a week, or once a month, depending<br>
on how quickly the catalyst inventory level is building. Because these sudden<br>
changes in regenerator bed level cause changes in the pressure balance of the<br>
FCC unit, they may result in changes in catalyst circulation rate, reactor<br>
temperature and/or regenerator temperature, and these upset the stability of<br>
the FCC unit operation. As these changes in the dynamic equilibrium force the<br>
FCC unit away from its operating limits, the desired product mix and/or effluent<br>
composition may not be obtained. As the FCC unit is a major profit center in<br>
most refineries, a great deal of time and investment made by refineries to<br>
ensure the FCC unit is always operating against its operating limits, thereby<br>
maximizing profitability. Anything that forces the operation of the FCC unit<br>
away from these limits reduces profitability and is a major detriment to the<br>
refiner. Thus, it would be highly desirable to stabilize the FCC operation by<br>
eliminating sudden catalyst withdrawals, thus maintaining the dynamic balance<br>
of catalyst in a FCC unit.<br>
[0009] Therefore, there is a need for a catalyst withdrawal apparatus<br>
suitable for use with a fluid catalytic cracking catalyst unit.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010] A catalyst withdrawal apparatus and method for regulating catalyst<br>
inventory in a fluid catalytic cracking catalyst (FCC) unit is provided. In one<br>
embodiment, a catalyst withdrawal apparatus for removing catalyst from a FCC<br>
unit includes a pressure vessel having a metering device coupled to a fill port.<br>
A heat dissipater is located adjacent the metering device and is adapted to cool<br>
catalyst entering the pressure vessel. A sensor is coupled to the pressure<br>
vessel arranged to provide a metric indicative of catalyst entering the pressure<br>
vessel through the metering device.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0019] The invention generally provides catalyst withdrawal apparatus<br>
suitable for use on a fluid catalyst cracking (FCC) unit and a method for<br>
regulating catalyst inventory in a FCC unit. Advantageously, the invention<br>
facilitates the removal of excess catalysts from the FCC unit with minimal<br>
process disruption.<br>
[0020] Figure 2 is a simplified schematic of a fluid catalytic cracking<br>
system 230 having a metered catalyst withdrawal system 240. The fluid<br>
catalytic cracking system 230 generally includes a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)<br>
unit 210 coupled to a catalyst injection system 200 and the metered catalyst<br>
withdrawal system 240, a controller 220, a petroleum feed stock source 204, an<br>
exhaust system 214 and a distillation system 216. One or more catalysts from<br>
the catalyst injection system 200 and petroleum from the petroleum feed stock<br>
source 204 are delivered to the FCC unit 210. The petroleum and catalysts are<br>
reacted in the FCC unit 210 to produce a vapor that is collected and separated<br>
into various petrochemical products in the distillation system 216.<br>
[0021] The heaviest products recovered in the distillation system 216 are<br>
generally tested to determine the amount of entrained catalyst. In one<br>
embodiment, the testing may be carried out daily or once a shift in a refinery<br>
laboratory 218. It is contemplated the amount of entrained catalyst may be<br>
determined by other methods, such as, but not limited to some form of online<br>
analysis. The metric of entrained catalyst is provided from the laboratory 218 to<br>
the controller 220 for using in regulating the catalyst within the FCC unit as<br>
further described below.<br>
[0022] The exhaust system 214 is interface with an exhaust 212 of the<br>
regenerator 250 and is adapted to monitor the composition of materials<br>
exhausted from the regenerator 250. In one embodiment, the exhaust system<br>
214 is configured to detect a metric of catalyst exiting the regenerator 250<br>
through the exhaust. This metric may be obtained by determining the amount<br>
of catalyst particles and/or catalyst fines entrained in the regenerator exhaust.<br>
As such, the exhaust system 214 may include a third or fourth stage separator,<br>
for example, a cyclone separator 232 and a scrubber 234. The metric of<br>
catalyst exiting the regenerator 250 can be provided to the controller 220 and<br>

utilized to balance the amount of catalyst within the FCC unit 210 as further<br>
described below.<br>
[0023] The FCC unit 210 includes a regenerator 250 and a reactor 252 as<br>
known in the art. The reactor 252 primarily houses the catalytic cracking<br>
reaction of the petroleum feed stock and delivers the cracked product in vapor<br>
form to the distillation system 216. Spend catalyst from the cracking reaction is<br>
transferred from the reactor 252 to the regenerator 250, where the catalyst is<br>
rejuvenated by removing coke and other materials. The rejuvenated catalyst is<br>
reintroduced into the reactor 252 to continue the petroleum cracking process.<br>
By-products from the catalyst rejuvenation process are exhausted from the<br>
regenerator 250 through an effluent stack.<br>
[0024] The FCC unit 210 includes a catalyst injection system 200 that<br>
maintains a semi continuous addition of fresh catalyst to the catalyst inventory<br>
circulating between the regenerator 250 and the reactor 252. The catalyst<br>
injection system 200 includes a main catalyst source 202 and one or more<br>
additive sources 206. The main catalyst source 202 and the additive source<br>
206 are coupled to the FCC unit 210 by a process line 222. A fluid source,<br>
such as a blower or air compressor 208, is coupled to the process line 222 and<br>
provides pressurized fluid, such as air, that is utilized to carry the various<br>
powdered catalysts from the sources 202, 206 through the process line 222 and<br>
into the FCC unit 210.<br>
[0025] Typically, different additives are provided from the addition source<br>
206 to the FCC unit 210 to control the ratio of product types recovered in the<br>
distillation system 216 (i.e., for example, more LPG than gasoline) and to<br>
control the composition of emissions passing through the exhaust system 214,<br>
among other process control attributes. The main catalyst source 202 generally<br>
delivers a Y-zeolite containing catalyst, which drives the main cracking process.<br>
Examples of catalyst injection systems that may be adapted to benefit the<br>
invention are described in United States Patent No. 5,389,236, issued February<br>
14, 1995; United States Patent No. 6,358,401, issued March 19, 2002; United<br>
States Patent Application No. 10/304,670 filed November 2, 2002; United<br>
States Patent No. 6,859,759 issued February 22, 2005; United States Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 10/445,543, filed May 27, 2003; and United States Patent<br>

Application Serial No. 10/717,250, filed November 19, 2003, all of which are<br>
hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. Other suitable catalyst<br>
injection systems that may be adapted to benefit the invention are available<br>
from Intercat Equipment Corporation, located in Sea Girt, New Jersey.<br>
[0026] The controller 220 is utilized to regulate the addition of catalysts<br>
and/or additives made by the injection system 200 and withdrawals made by<br>
the metered catalyst withdrawal system 240 so that the dynamic equilibrium of<br>
catalyst within the FCC unit 210 may be maintained. As the controller 220 is<br>
generally positioned proximate the catalyst sources 206, 202 and the FCC unit<br>
210, the controller 220 is typically housed in an explosion-proof enclosure to<br>
prevent spark ignition of gases which may potentially exist on the exterior of the<br>
enclosure in a petroleum processing environment. The controller 220 may be<br>
equipped with remote access capability so that activity may be monitored from<br>
other locations, such as operations center or by catalyst suppliers. A controller<br>
having such capability is described in United States Patent No. 6,859,759,<br>
issued February 22, 2005 and United States Patent Application Serial No.<br>
10/304,670, filed November 26, 2002, both of which are hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in their entireties.<br>
[0027] The regenerator 250 may be equipped with one or more sensors<br>
that provide a metric indicative of a catalyst level within the regenerator 250. In<br>
the embodiment depicted in Figure 2, the regenerator 250 includes a first<br>
sensor 242 and a second sensor 244 configured to detect when the level of<br>
catalyst within the regenerator 250 exceeds an upper or lower threshold. The<br>
sensor 242, 244 may be an differential pressure measurement device, optical<br>
transducer, a capacitance device, a sonic transducer or other device suitable<br>
for providing information from which the level or volume of catalyst disposed in<br>
the regenerator 250 may be resolved. For example, if the first sensor 242<br>
provides an indication to the controller 220 that the catalyst level is low, the<br>
controller 220 may initiate a catalyst injection by the catalyst injection system<br>
200. If the second sensor 244 provides an indication to the controller 220 that<br>
the catalyst level is high, the controller 220 may initiate a catalyst withdrawal<br>
from the FCC unit by the catalyst withdrawal system 240, or speed up these<br>
otherwise semi-continuous withdrawal processes.<br>

[0028] The metered catalyst withdrawal system 240 is coupled to the<br>
regenerator 250 by a conduit 254. A metering device 256 is disposed in the<br>
conduit 254 to control the flow of catalyst between the regenerator 250 and the<br>
metered withdrawal system 240. An outlet valve 260 is coupled to the catalyst<br>
withdrawal system 240 and is configured to control the flow of catalyst between<br>
the withdrawal system 240 and the spent catalyst storage/disposal 262. The<br>
metering device 256 and outlet valve 260 may be similarly constructed.<br>
[0029] Figure 3 depicts a larger view of one embodiment of the metered<br>
withdrawal system 240 of Figure 2. The withdrawal system 240 includes a<br>
storage vessel 310 having the metering device 256 and the outlet valve 260<br>
coupled thereto. The storage vessel 310 is typically a metal container suitable<br>
for use at high temperatures having a fill port 314 and a discharge port 316.<br>
Typically, the discharge port 316 is positioned at or near a bottom of the<br>
storage vessel 310. The storage vessel 310 is coupled to a pressure control<br>
apparatus 318 that controls the pressure within the storage vessel 310. The<br>
pressure control apparatus 318 generally pressurizes the storage vessel 310 to<br>
about 5 to about 60 pounds per square inch (about 0.35 to about 4.2 kg/cm2)<br>
during withdrawal operations. The apparatus 318 may intermittently vent the<br>
storage vessel 310 to about atmospheric pressure to accommodate filling the<br>
vessel 310 with catalyst from the regenerator 250.<br>
[0030] The storage vessel 310 is vented through a vent port 312 that is<br>
coupled to the regenerator's exhaust 212 or other suitable effluent stack. A<br>
control valve 308 is provided to regulate (or prevent) flow through the vent port<br>
314 from the storage vessel 310. A cyclone 380 or similar device may also be<br>
inserted in the vent line to minimize catalyst carryover from the storage vessel<br>
310. Recovered fines from the cyclone 380 may be transferred through a<br>
return conduit 382 to the storage vessel 310.<br>
[0031] In one embodiment, the pressure control apparatus 318 is<br>
configured to provide air or other gas into the vessel 310. The air or other gas<br>
may be utilized to fluidize, aerate and/or otherwise cool the withdrawn catalyst<br>
disposed in the vessel 310. The pressure control apparatus 318 may<br>
additionally be configured to control the flow of the air or other gas provided to<br>
8<br><br>

Express Mail Label: EV840619730US<br>
the vessel 310, thereby providing the ability to optimize cooling of the withdrawn<br>
catalyst and control environmental conditions within the storage vessel 310.<br>
[0032] The metering device 256 is coupled to the fill port 314 to monitor to<br>
control the amount of catalyst received from the regenerator 250. The outlet<br>
valve 260 is coupled to the discharged port 316 to control the amount of<br>
withdrawn catalyst removed from the storage vessel 310 to the spent catalyst<br>
storage/disposal 262 through an outlet line 304. The metering device 256 may<br>
be an on/off valve such as an everlasting valve, a rotary valve or other device<br>
suitable for removing and/or regulating the amount of catalyst withdrawn from<br>
the FCC unit 210 into the storage vessel 310. The metering device 256 may<br>
determine the amount of catalyst by weight, volume, timed dispense or by other<br>
manners. Depending on the catalyst requirements of the system 230, the<br>
metering device 256 is typically configured to remove about 0.1 to about 30<br>
tons per day of catalyst from the regenerator 250 without interruption of<br>
processing in the FCC unit 210. The metering device 256 typically removes<br>
catalysts from the FCC unit 210 periodically over the course of a planned<br>
production cycle, typically 24 hours, in multiple shots of predetermined amounts<br>
spaced over the production cycle. However, catalysts may also be removed<br>
from the FCC unit 210 in an "as needed" basis as discussed above.<br>
[0033] In the embodiment depicted in Figure 3, the metering device 256 is<br>
a control valve 332 that regulates the amount of catalyst delivered from the<br>
regenerator 250 into the storage vessel 310 by timed actuation. The control<br>
valve 332 may include shear disk (not shown) for opening and closing a valve<br>
orifice. In one embodiment, the shear disk rotates eccentricity while additionally<br>
rotating clear of the orifice to provide a self-lapping, seat cleaning action that<br>
prevents the withdrawn catalyst from grooving the sealing surfaces of the shear<br>
disk and valve seat that could cause the valve leakage. One valve that may be<br>
adapted to benefit from the invention is available from the Everlasting Valve<br>
Company, located in South Plainfield, New Jersey. Other control valves may<br>
alternatively be utilized.<br>
[0034] Generally, the control valve 332 and the outlet valve 260 are<br>
interlocked to prevent simultaneous opening. This allows data to be obtained<br>
between valve 332, 260 openings such that the amount of catalyst entering and<br>
9<br><br>

Express Mail Label: EV840619730US<br>
leaving the storage vessel 310 may be accurately resolved. In one<br>
embodiment, the outlet valve 260 is opened while the pressure regulating<br>
system 240 provides air at about 60 psi (about 4.2 kg/cm2) into the interior of<br>
the storage vessel 310 to cause catalyst to flow from the storage vessel 310<br>
through the valve 260 and into the spent catalyst storage/disposal 262 via the<br>
outlet line 304.<br>
[0035] Referring back to Figure 2, the metered withdrawal system 240<br>
includes one or more sensors 264 for providing a metric suitable for resolving<br>
the amount of catalyst passing through the metering device 256 during each<br>
withdrawal of catalyst from the regenerator 250. The sensors 264 may be<br>
configured to detect the level (i.e., volume) of catalyst in the storage vessel 310,<br>
the weight of catalyst in the storage vessel 310 and/or the rate of catalyst<br>
movement through at least one of the storage vessel 310, the fill port 314, the<br>
discharge port 316, the metering device 256, the outlet valve 260, the conduit<br>
254 or outlet line 304.<br>
[0036] In the embodiment depicted in Figure 3, the sensor 264 is a plurality<br>
of load cells 306 adapted to provide a metric indicative of the weight of catalyst<br>
in the storage vessel 310. The load cells 306 are respectively coupled to a<br>
plurality of legs 336 that supports the storage vessel 310 above a surface 320,<br>
such as a concrete pad. Each of the legs 336 has one load cell 326 coupled<br>
thereto. The controller 220 receives the outputs of the load cells 326 and<br>
utilizes sequential data samples obtained therefrom to resolve the net amount<br>
of withdrawn catalyst after each actuation of the metering device 256. Data<br>
samples are also taken after actuation of the outlet valve 260 such that the true<br>
amount of catalyst withdrawn from the FCC unit 210 through the system 240<br>
may be accurately determined. Additionally, the net amount of catalyst<br>
withdrawn over the course of the production cycle may be monitored so that<br>
variations in the amount of catalyst dispensed in each individual shot may be<br>
compensated for by adjusting the delivery attributes of the metering device 256,<br>
for example, changing the open time of the control valve 332 to allow more (or<br>
less) catalyst to pass therethrough and be removed from the FCC unit 210.<br>
[0037] Alternatively, the sensor 264 may be a level sensor 328 coupled to<br>
the storage vessel 310 and adapted to detect a metric indicative of the level of<br>
10<br><br>
Date of Deposit: 14 July 2006	Attorney Docket No. CAT/013PCT<br>
Express Mail Label: EV840619730US<br>
catalyst within the storage vessel 310. The level sensor 328 may be a<br>
differential pressure measuring device, an optical transducer, a capacitance<br>
device, a sonic transducer or other device suitable for providing information<br>
from which the level or volume of catalyst disposed in the storage vessel 310<br>
may be resolved. By utilizing the sensed difference in the level of catalyst<br>
disposed in the storage vessel 310 after dispenses, the amount of catalyst<br>
removed from the regenerator 250 may be resolved for a known storage vessel<br>
geometry.<br>
[0038] Alternatively, the sensor 264 may be a flow sensor 330 adapted to<br>
detect the flow of catalyst through one of the components of the catalyst<br>
withdrawal system 240. The flow sensor 330 maybe a contact or non-contact<br>
device and may be mounted to the storage vessel 310, the metering device 256<br>
or the conduit 254 coupling the storage vessel 310 to the waste container. In<br>
the embodiment depicted in Figure 3, the flow sensor 330 may be a sonic flow<br>
meter or capacitance device adapted to detect the rate of entrained particles<br>
(i.e., catalyst) moving through the delivery line 308.<br>
[0039] Returning to Figure 2, a heat dissipater 258 is coupled to or<br>
positioned approximate to the conduit 254. The heat dissipater 258 is<br>
configured to extract heat from the catalyst within conduit 254, thereby reducing<br>
the temperature of the catalyst flowing from the regenerator 250 to the metered<br>
withdrawal system 240.<br>
[0040] Referring additionally to Figure 3, the heat dissipater 258 may be<br>
positioned proximate the conduit 254 between the regenerator 250 and the<br>
metering device 256, or positioned proximate the conduit 254 between the<br>
metering device 256 and the storage vessel 310. In another embodiment, the<br>
conduit 254 may be coiled or define a torturous path such that the heat<br>
dissipater 258 may be interfaced with a greater length of conduit than if the<br>
conduit was routed in a straight line path as shown in Figure 2, thereby<br>
improving the amount of heat transferred therebetween.<br>
[0041] The heat dissipater 258 may include at least one or more<br>
temperature regulating features. For example, the heat dissipater 258 may<br>
include heat transfer fins 342. In another embodiment, the heat dissipater 258<br>
may include one or more conduits 344 coupled to a fluid source 346 through<br>
11<br><br>
Date of Deposit: 14 July 2006	Attorney Docket No. CAT/013PCT<br>
Express Mail Label: EV840619730US<br>
which a heat transfer fluid is flowed. By reducing the temperature of catalyst<br>
being withdrawn from the regenerator 250, the design constraint of the<br>
withdrawal system 240 may be relaxed accordingly with the reduction in catalyst<br>
temperature entering the vessel 310.<br>
[0042] Similarly, the storage vessel 310 may also be equipped with a<br>
thermal regulating device 358 to reduce the temperature of the storage vessel<br>
310. The thermal regulating device 358 may be configured similar to the heat<br>
dissipater 258 described above. For example, the thermal regulating device<br>
358 may include heat transfer fins 360. In another embodiment, the thermal<br>
regulating device 358 may include one or more conduits 362 coupled to a fluid<br>
source 364 through which a heat transfer fluid is flowed.<br>
[0043] The storage vessel 310 may alternatively and/or additionally be<br>
cooled as described above by providing fluid from the pressure control<br>
apparatus 318 into the vessel 310. The control valve 308 may also be<br>
periodically opened to allow heated gases disposed on the interior volume of<br>
the vessel 310 to be removed and replace by cooler gas provided from the<br>
pressure control apparatus 318.<br>
[0044] The temperature of the gas and/or catalyst entering vessel 310 may<br>
be monitored using a sensor 384. If the controller 220 determines, in response<br>
to a metric of temperature provided by the sensor 384, that the temperature of<br>
the gas and/or catalyst entering the vessel exceed a predefined limit, then a<br>
remedial action may be initiated. For example, remedial actions may include at<br>
least one of shutting off the flow through into the vessel 310 to allow the system<br>
to cool before restarting, reducing the flowrate of catalyst into vessel 310 using<br>
the regulating device 256, increasing the heat extraction rate of the heat<br>
dissipater 258 or adding an extra flow of cold air to the catalyst leaving the<br>
regenerator to cool it down through jets 386 formed in the conduit 254.<br>
[0045] Returning to Figure 2, the controller 220 is provided to control the<br>
function of at least the withdrawal system 240. The controller 220 may be any<br>
suitable logic device for controlling the operation of the catalyst withdrawal<br>
system 240. In one embodiment, the controller 220 is a programmable logic<br>
controller (PLC), such as those available from GE Fanuc. However, from the<br>
disclosure herein, those skilled in the art will realize that other controllers such<br>
12<br><br>
Date of Deposit: 14 July 2006	Attorney Docket No CAT/013PCT<br>
Express Mail Label: EV840619730US<br>
as microcontrollers, microprocessors, programmable gate arrays, and<br>
application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) may be used to perform the<br>
controlling functions of the controller 220. It is contemplated that the injection<br>
system 200 and the withdrawal system 240 may have separate controllers,<br>
which may, or may not, be linked.<br>
[0046] The controller 220 is coupled to various support circuits that provide<br>
various signals to the controller 220. These support circuits include, power<br>
supplies, clocks, input and output interface circuits and the like. Other support<br>
circuits couple to the temperature sensor 384, the sensors 264, the metering<br>
device 256, the outlet valve 260, the pressure control apparatus 318 and the<br>
like, to the controller 220.<br>
[0047] Figure 4 is flow diagram of one embodiment of a method 400 for<br>
regulating catalyst within a FCC unit. The method 400 begins at step 402 by<br>
obtaining a metric of catalyst lost and/or removed from the FCC unit. The<br>
metric of catalyst lost may be a predefined value. For example, based on<br>
empirical data, or calculated data, or maybe a provided real time and/or as an<br>
updated metric. Examples of updated and/or provided metrics include a metric<br>
of catalyst entrained in the product stream at the distiller, catalyst exiting the<br>
regenerator through the exhaust system, catalyst removed from the metered<br>
withdrawal system, among others.<br>
[0048] At step 404, a metric of catalyst additions are obtained. The metric<br>
of catalyst addition are typically attained from the catalyst addition system, in<br>
the form of catalyst and/or additives added to the FCC unit.<br>
[0049] At step 406, an amount of catalyst within the FCC unit is<br>
determined. In one embodiment, the amount of catalyst is determined by<br>
summing the catalyst additions obtained at step 404 minus the catalyst<br>
removed from the system obtained at step 402. The determination of catalyst<br>
within the FCC unit may be made from data obtained over a predetermined<br>
period of time. The predetermined period of time may be in fractions of an<br>
hour, hourly, daily or over other time periods. The determination of catalyst<br>
within the FCC unit may be made from data obtained real time, for example, by<br>
monitoring a data stream such as regenerator bed level. As the process<br>
described above is iterative, the total catalyst determined may, alternatively, be<br>
13<br><br>
Date of Deposit: 14 July 2006	Attorney Docket No. CAT/013PCT<br>
Express Mail Label: EV840619730US<br>
calculated by subtracting the catalyst removed over the period from the last<br>
determination and adding the catalyst added over the same period.<br>
[0050] At step 408, the catalyst amount is compared against a threshold<br>
value or process window. If the determined catalyst is outside of a predefined<br>
process window (or exceeds the threshold), appropriate catalyst additions or<br>
withdrawals are made at step 410. This cycle of monitoring the amount of<br>
catalyst is repeated in order to maintain the dynamic catalyst equilibrium in the<br>
FCC unit. Advantageously, this allows the FCC unit to continue operating at or<br>
near processing limits with minimal fluctuation, thereby providing the desired<br>
product mix and emissions composition with minimal dis-optimisation, thereby<br>
maximizing the profitability of the FCC system refiner.<br>
[0051] In another embodiment of a method for regulating catalyst within a<br>
FCC unit, the withdrawal system 240 may be set to remove a predefined<br>
amount of catalyst over a predefined period of time. For example, the<br>
withdrawal system 240 may be set to remove a target withdrawal of about 4<br>
tons of catalyst per day. The withdrawal may be made in predetermined<br>
increments, such that a total withdrawal amount will be made over the<br>
predefined period. In one embodiment the operator may manually initiate<br>
withdrawals from the regenerator 250 using the system 240. For example, the<br>
operator may initiate a withdrawal in response to the catalyst bed level within<br>
the regenerator 250, such as provided by information obtained by the sensor<br>
244, The manual withdrawal may be made in addition to the target withdrawal,<br>
or count against the target withdrawal for that time period.<br>
[0052] Although the teachings of the present invention have been shown<br>
and described in detail herein, those skilled in the art can readily devise other<br>
varied embodiments that still incorporate the teachings and do not depart from<br>
the scope and spirit of the invention.<br>
