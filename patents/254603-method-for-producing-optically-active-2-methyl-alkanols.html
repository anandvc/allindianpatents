Method for producing optically active 2-methyl-alkanols Description<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing optically active 2-methylalkan-1-ol starting from 2-alkylpent-2-enal.<br>
Prior art<br>
The preparation of optically active 2-methylpentan-1-ol ("methylpentanol") by various processes has previously been described in the literature. Thus, for example, M. A. Jermyn et al. (Aust J. Chem. 1967, 20, 2283-2284) obtain R-methylpentanol by hydrolyzing the p-toluenesulfonate of L-valine (R)-2-methylpentyl ester. Oppolzer et al. (Helv. Chim. Acta 1985, 68, 212-215) obtain R-methylpentanol by diastereoselective ester enolate alkylation of a chiral sultam. Danishefsky et al. (J. Org. Chem. 1986, 51, 5032-5036) obtain R-2-methylpentanol by diastereoselective imide enolate alkylation of a chiral oxazolidinone. Effenberger et al. {Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 1993, 4, 823-833) obtain R-methylpentanol from racemic methylpentanol by lipase-catalyzed enantioselective acylation. The processes described above produce optically active methylpentanol in an economically unsatisfactory way because of costly starting materials, multistage synthesis, insufficient yields or very elaborate purification.<br>
Statement of object<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing optically active 2-methylalkan-1-ol that avoids, completely or at least partly, the disadvantages described above.<br>
Description of the invention<br><br>
We have found that this object is achieved by a process for preparing optically active 2-methyialkan-1-ol of the general formula (III) comprising the following steps;<br>
(i)        carbonyl-selective reduction of 2-methylalk-2-en-1 -ai of the general formula (I) to 2-methylaik-2-en-1-oi of the general formula (II), (ii)       enantioselective hydrogenation of 2-methyIalk-2-en-1-ol to the<br>
general formula (iii), (iii)      increasing the optical yield of the optically active 2-<br>
methylalkan-1-ol (III) obtained in step (ii) by a lipase-catalyzed acylation reaction,<br><br>
Only one enantiomer (III) is drawn in the formula scheme shown above. However, it is pointed out that the process of the invention also includes the preparation of the respective other enantiomer (III) - which is not drawn herein. The enantiomer (III) which is desired in each case can be obtained through selecting the appropriate catalyst system in step (ii).<br>
In the formula images (I) to (III) shown above, the radical R means CrCi0-alkyl, where the alkyl radical may be straight-chain or branched, in particular methyl, ethyl, n-propyl and isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl and decyl. This definition also comprises in addition substituted alkyls in which one or more, preferably one to three, hydrogen atoms are replaced by radicals such as F, CI, Br, I, N02, NH2, NH(alkyl), N(alkyl)2, OH, SH, CN.<br>
The individual steps of the process are described below:<br><br>
Step (i): carbonyl-selective reduction<br>
The carbonyl-selective reduction of 2-methylalk-2-en-1-al to 2-methylalk-2-en-1~ ol can be carried out by various processes known to the skilled worker. Examples of such processes comprise hydride-transferring reagents or catalysts such as, for example, main group element hydrides or transition metal complexes which can act as catalysts, transfer hydrogenations, reductions with metals or low valency metal salts, diimine reductions or hydrogenations. A compilation of such processes is described for example in R. L. Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, Wiley-VCH, New York, 1999.<br>
Depending on the selectivity of the catalyst system used in step (i) and on the chosen conditions, small amounts of the over-hydrogenated product (III) may be produced as racemate in step (i). Since this racemate (III) could impair the optical yield of the enantioselective double-bond hydrogenation provided in step (ii), it is advisable, following step (i), if appropriate to carry out a purification of the 2-methylalk-2-en-1-ol (II) produced, in order to remove any unreacted starting material (I) or over-hydrogenated racemic (III).<br>
Such a purification can preferably take place by distillation, and it may be appropriate in particular for increasing the yield to add a higher-boiling component to the reaction mixture to be separated.<br>
Step (ii): enantioselective hydrogenation<br>
The enantioselective hydrogenation of 2-methylalk-2-en-1-ol to optically active 2-methylalkan-1-ol can be carried out using transition metal complex catalysts, in particular those with transition metals of groups 8-11.<br>
Transition metal complex catalysts can be formed from a metal-containing precatalyst and a ligand.<br><br>
Complexes comprising Ru, Rh, Ir, Pd, Pt are preferred as precaiaiyst, and complexes comprising Ru and Rh are particularly preferred as precatalyst.<br>
Such preferred precatalysts are metal complexes for example RhCI3, Rh(OAc)3, [Rh(cod)CI]2l Rh(CO)2acac, [Rh(cod)OH]2, [Rh(cod)OMe]2, Rh4(CO)12, Rh6(CO)16and RuCI3, Ru(acac)3, [Ru(benzene)CI]2, [Ru(cymene)l2], Ru(methallyl)2(cod).<br>
The transition metal compounds and complexes mentioned, and further suitable ones, are known and described in the literature or can be prepared by the skilled worker in analogy to the compounds already known.<br>
Ligands are P, As, Sb-containing compounds as well as compounds which are linked via a carbon atom to the transition metal catalyst complex fragment.<br>
Chiral P-containing ligands are particularly preferred.<br>
Particularly preferred ligands are phosphorus-containing compounds with the ability to develop atropisomerism in relation to two aryl or hetaryl systems as depicted below:<br><br>
R1, R2 (identical or different):    subst. or unsubst. aryl, heteroaryl, alkyl, cycloalkyl,<br>
where the subst. may be H, halogen, alkyi, alkoxy<br>
R3, R4 (identical or different):    subst. or unsubst. aryl, heteroaryl, alkyl, cycloalkyl,<br>
where the subst. may be H, halogen, alkyl, alkoxy<br>
R5, R5\ R6, R6' (identical or different):	with R = H, halogen, alkyl, aryl, alkoxy, amino, thio<br>
R7, R7' (identical or different):   with R = H, halogen, alkyl, aryl, alkoxy, amino, thio<br><br><br><br><br>
Preparation of the abovementioned transition metal complex catalysts from precatalyst and ligand is known and described in the literature, e.g. H.U. Blaser, B. Pugin, F. Spindler in "Applied homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis with organometallic compounds", Ed. B. Cornils, W.A. Herrmann, p. 992 ff. VCH Weinehim , 1996, ISBN, 3-527-29286-1.<br>
The reaction temperature for the enantioselective hydrogenation can be between -10°C and 150°C, preferably between 0-120°C, particularly preferably between 10-100°C.<br><br>
The reaction pressure for the enantioselective hydrogenation can be between 0.1 to 600 bar, preferably between 50 and 250 bar.<br>
The catalyst used for step (ii) is normally employed in a catsubstrate ratio of 
The reaction time normally depends on the reaction temperature and on the pressure conditions prevailing during the reaction and the amounts of catalyst used; it is normally between 1 and 50 hours, preferably 5 to 25 hours.<br>
The following solvents can preferably be used: methanol, ethanol, i-propanol, propanol, butanol, sec-butanol, tert-butanol, CH2CI2, CHCI3, dichloroethane, EtOAc, THF, TBME, Et20, Bu20, toluene, xylene, benzene, alkanes of the general formula CnH2n+2 with n = 5-15 and mixtures thereof.<br>
Methanol, ethanol, propanol, i-propanol are particularly preferred.<br>
Step (iii): Increasing the optical yield of the optically active 2-methylalkan-1-ol (III) obtained in step (ii) by a lipase-catalyzed acylation reaction.<br>
Step (iii) serves to improve even further the ratio obtained in step (ii) of the optical isomers of the 2-methyIalkan-1-ol (III). For this purpose, the mixture obtained in step (ii) is reacted (acylated) with an acylating agent under the catalytic action of a lipase, with the lipase selectively acylating one enantiomer (III) and leaving the other enantiomer (III) unchanged.<br>
The lipase preferably acylates the enantiomer (III) which was not formed in enantiomeric excess in step (ii) and thus leaves the product (III) formed in enantiomeric excess in step (ii) unchanged by lipase. The fact that the enantiomer not formed in excess in step (ii) is completely reacted by acylation leads to an increase in the optical purity - defined as enantiomeric excess - of the enantiomer (III) formed in enantiomeric excess in step (ii).<br><br>
The acylation product of (III) can be removed from the nonacylated enantiomer (III) by conventional processes such as chromatography, distillation or extraction.<br>
The lipases employed in step (iii) may be derived from a large number of organisms, for example mammals (pig), but especially from microorganisms. Preferred lipases are those derived from the species Pseudomonas or Burkholderia or have been modified, starting therefrom, by genetic manipulation processes, particularly preferably from Burkholderia plantarii or Pseudomonas fluorescens.<br>
The following lipases are particularly preferably used in step (iii): PFL Fluka (from Pseudomonal fluorescens), Novo 435 (Novozymes), Amano PS-C1, Amano PS-C2 and Amano PS-D1 (from Burkholderia cepacia, CAS No. 9001-62-1).<br>
The lipases can be employed in dissolved form or else in carrier-bound form. A carrier-bound lipase is preferably used.<br>
Acylating agents which can be employed for step (iii) are a large number of carboxyl derivatives which selectively acrylate the substrate (III) under lipase catalysis. Preferred acylating agents are acid anhydrides and alkenyl esters.<br>
Cyclic acid anhydrides such as succinic anhydride or vinyl esters are particularly preferred.<br>
Step (iii) can be carried out with or without additional solvent.<br>
If a solvent is to be employed, the following solvents are preferred: CH3CN, DMSO, NMP, CH2CI2, CHCI3, dichloroethane, EtOAc, THF, TBME, Et20, Bu20, 1,4-dioxane, acetone, 2-butanone, toluene, xylene, benzene, alkanes of the general formula CnH2n+2 with n = 5-15 and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
The preferred temperature for this step is between 0-60cC, particularly preferably between 5-35°C.<br>
The reaction time may be, depending on the chosen conditions, between one hour and several days. Normally, the progress of the reaction in step (iii) is followed, and the reaction is stopped when the desired enantiomeric excess is reached.<br>
The acylation product formed from one enantiomer (III) is then separated from the other, unreacted enantiomer (III). If an acid anhydride has been employed as acylating agent, the removal of the acylated product can preferably take place by extraction with aqueous base solution.<br>
The process of the invention can be carried out either discontinuously or continuously in all steps; however, it is also possible to carry out individual steps such as, for example, step (ii) continuously, and the other steps discontinuously.<br><br>
