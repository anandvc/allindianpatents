LIPASE VARIANT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to lipase variants suited for use in detergent compositions. More particularly, the invention relates to variants of the wild-type lipase from Humicola lanuginosa strain DSM 4109 showing a first-wash effect.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
For a number of years, lipases have been used as detergent enzymes to remove lipid or fatty stains from clothes and other textiles, particularly a lipase derived from Humicola lanuginosa (EP 258 068 and EP 305 216) sold under the tradename Lipolase  (product of Novo Nordisk A/S).<br>
WO 92/05249, WO 94/25577, WO 95/22615, WO 97/04079 and WO 97/07202 disclose variants of the H. lanuginosa lipase having improved properties for detergent purposes. Thus, WO 97/04079 discloses variants having a peptide addition (extension) at the N-terminal and/or the C-terminal. WO 97/07202 discloses lipase variants with "first wash performance" which are capable of removing substantial amounts of lard from a lard stained swatch in a one-cycle wash.<br>
There is an ever existing need for providing novel lipases with improved washing properties in a variety of commercial detergents. The present invention relates to such novel lipases.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inventors have found that certain variants of Lipolase (wild-type Humicola lanuginosa lipase) have a particularly good first-wash performance in a detergent solution. The lipases may further provide additional benefits, such as whiteness maintenance and dingy cleanup.<br>
The inventors found that the variants should comprise one or more substitutions with positive amino acids near the N-terminal in the three-dimensional structure. The variants should further comprise a peptide addition at the C-terminal and/or should meet certain limitations on electrically charged amino acids at positions 90-101 and 210.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a lipase which is a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence which:<br><br>
a)	has at least 90 % identity with the wild-type lipase derived from Humicola<br>
lanuginosa strain DSM 4109;<br>
b)	compared to said wild-type lipase, comprises a substitution of an<br>
electrically neutral or negatively charged amino acid at the surface of the three-<br>
dimensional structure within 15 A of E1 or Q249 with a positively charged amino<br>
acid; and<br>
c)	comprises a peptide addition at the C-terminal; and/or<br>
d)	meets the following limitations:<br>
i) comprises a negative amino acid in position E210 of said wild-type lipase;<br>
ii) comprises a negatively charged amino acid in the region corresponding to positions 90-101 of said wild-type lipase; and<br>
iii) comprises a neutral or negative amino acid at a position corresponding to N94 of said wild-type lipase and/or has a negative or neutral net electric charge in the region corresponding to positions 90-101 of said wild-type lipase.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Humicola lanuginosa lipase<br>
The reference lipase used in this invention is the wild-type lipase derived from Humicola lanuginosa strain DSM 4109. It is described in EP 258 068 and EP 305 216 and has the amino acid sequence shown in positions 1-269 of SEQ ID NO: 2 of US 5,869,438. In this specification, the reference lipase is also referred to as Lipolase.<br>
Substitution with positive amino acid<br>
The lipase of the invention comprises one or more (e.g. 2-4, particularly two) substitutions of an electrically neutral or negatively charged amino acid near E1 or i Q249 with a positively charged amino acid, preferably R.<br>
The substitution is at the surface of the three-dimensional structure within 15 A of E1 or Q249, e.g. at any of positions 1-11, 90, 95, 169, 171-175, 192-211, 213-226, 228-258t 260-262.<br>
The substitution may be within 10 A of E1 or Q249, e.g. at any of positions 1-7, 10, 175, 195, 197-202, 204-206, 209, 215, 219-224, 230-239, 242-254.<br>
The substitution may be within 15 A of E1, e.g. at any of positions 1-11,169, 171, 192-199, 217-225, 228-240, 243-247, 249, 261-262.<br>
The substitution is most preferably within 10 A of E1, e.g. at any of positions 1-7, 10, 219-224 and 230-239.<br><br>
Thus, some preferred substitutions are S3R, S224R, P229R, T231R, N233R, D234R and T244R.<br>
Peptide addition at C-terminal<br>
The lipase may comprise a peptide addition attached to C-terminal L269. The peptide addition improves the first-wash performance in a variety of detergents.<br>
The peptide addition preferably consists of 1-5 amino acids, e.g. 2t 3 or 4 amino acids. The amino acids of the peptide addition will be numbered 270,271, etc.<br>
The peptide addition may consist of electrically neutral (e.g. hydrophobic) amino acids, e.g. PGL or PG. In an alternative embodiment, the lipase peptide addition consists of neutral (e.g. hydrophobic) amino acids and the amino acid C, and the lipase comprises substitution of an amino acid with C at a suitable location so as to form a disulfide bridge with the C of the peptide addition. Examples are:<br>
270C linked to G23C or T37C<br>
271C linked to K24C, T37C, N26C or R81C<br>
272C linked to D27C, T35C, E56C, T64C or R81C.<br>
Amino acids at positions 90-101 and 210<br>
The lipase of the invention preferably meets certain limitations on electrically charged amino acids at positions 90-101 and 210. Lipases meeting the charge limitations are particularly effective in a detergent with high content of anionic.<br>
Thus, amino acid 210 may be negative. E210 may be unchanged or it may have the substitution E210D/C/Y, particularly E210D.<br>
The lipase may comprise a negatively charged amino acid at any of positions 90-101 (particularly 94-101), e.g. at position D96 and/or E99.<br>
Further, the lipase may comprise a neutral or negative amino acid at position N94, i.e. N94(neutral or negative), e.g. N94N/D/E.<br>
Also, the lipase may have a negative or neutral net electric charge in the region 90-101 (particularly 94-101), i.e. the number of negative amino acids is equal to or greater than the number of positive amino acids. Thus, the region may be unchanged from Lipolase, having two negative amino acids (D96 and E99) and one positive (K98), and having a neutral amino acid at position 94 (N94), or the region may be modified by one or more substitutions.<br>
Alternatively, two of the three amino acids N94, N96 and E99 may have a negative or unchanged electric charge. Thus, all three amino acids may be unchanged or may be changed by a conservative or negative substitution, i.e. N94(neutral or negative), D(negative) and E99(negative). Examples are N94D/E and<br><br>
D96E. Also, one of the three may be substituted so as to increase the electric charge, i.e. N94(positive), D96(neutral or positive) or E99 (neutral or positive). Examples are N94K/R, D96I/U/N/S/W or E99N/Q/K/R/H.<br>
The substitution of a neutral with a negative amino acid (N94D/E), may improve the performance in an anionic detergent. The substitution of a neutral amino acid with a positive amino acid (N94K/R) may provide a variant lipase with good performance both in an anionic detergent and in an anionic/non-ionic detergent (a detergent with e.g. 40-70 % anionic out of total surfactant).<br>
Amino acids at other positions<br>
The inventors have found that a substitution Q249R/K/H may improve the performance both in anionic and in anionic/non-ionic detergent, and that a substitution of R209 wiih a neutral or negative amino acid (e.g. R209P/S) may improve the performance in anionic detergent. The lipase may optionally comprise the substitution G91A.<br>
The lipase may optionally comprise substitutions of one or more additional amino acids. Such substitutions may, e.g., be made according to principles known in the art, e.g. substitutions described in WO 92/05249, WO 94/25577, WO 95/22615, WO 97/04079 and WO 97/07202.<br>
Combinations of substitutions<br>
A lipase variant with good first-wash performance may be obtained by modifying Lipolase as follows. Substitutions in parentheses are optional.<br><br><br><br>
Nomenclature for amino acid modifications<br>
The nomenclature used herein for defining mutations  is essentially as described in WO 92/05249. Thus, T231R indicates a substitution of T in position 231<br><br>
with R. PGL or 270P+ 271G+ 272L indicates the peptide addition PGL attached to the C-terminal (L269).<br>
Amino acid grouping<br>
In this specification, amino acids are classified as negatively charged, positively charged or electrically neutral according to their electric charge at pH 10, which is typical of the detergent of the invention. Thus, negative amino acids are E, D, C (cysteine) and Y, particularly E and D. Positive amino acids are R, K and H, particularly R and K. Neutral amino acids are G, A, V, L, I, P, Ft W, S, T, M, N, Q and C when forming part of a disulfide bridge. A substitution with another amino acid in the same group (negative, positive or neutral) is termed a conservative substitution.<br>
The neutral amino acids may be divided into hydrophobic (G, A, V, L, I, P, F, W and C as part of a disulfide bridge) and hydrophilic (S, T, M, N, Q).<br>
Amino acid identity<br>
The lipase variant of the of the invention has an amino acid identity of at least 90 % (preferably more than 95 % or more than 98 %) with Lipolase.<br>
The degree of identity may be suitably determined by means of computer programs known in the art, such as GAP provided in the GCG program package (Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Version 8, August 1994, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wisconsin, USA 53711) (Needleman, S.B. and Wunsch, CD., (1970), Journal of Molecular Biology, 48, 443-45), using GAP with the following settings for polypeptide sequence comparison: GAP creation penalty of 3.0 and GAP extension penalty of 0.1.<br>
DNA sequence, Expression vector, Host cell, Production of lipase<br>
The invention provides a DNA sequence encoding the lipase of the invention, an expression vector harboring the DNA sequence, and a transformed host cell containing the DNA sequence or the expression vector. These may be obtained by methods known in the art.<br>
The invention also provides a method of producing the lipase by culturing the transformed host cell under conditions conducive for the production of the lipase and recovering the lipase from the resulting broth. The method may be practiced according to principles known in the art.<br><br>
Detergent additive<br>
According to the invention, the lipase may typically be used as an additive in a detergent composition. This additive is conveniently formulated as a non-dusting granulate, a stabilized liquid, a slurry or a protected enzyme. The additive may be prepared by methods known in the art.<br>
DETERGENT COMPOSITION<br>
The detergent compositions of the invention may for example, be formulated as hand and machine laundry detergent compositions including laundry additive compositions and compositions suitable for use in the pretreatment of stained fabrics, rinse added fabric softener compositions, and compositions for use in general household hard surface cleaning operations and dishwashing operations.<br>
The detergent composition of the invention comprises the lipase of the nvention and a surfactant. Additionally, it may optionally comprise a builder, another snzyme, a suds suppresses a softening agent, a dye-transfer inhibiting agent and other components conventionally used in detergents such as soil-suspending agents, soil-releasing agents, optical brighteners, abrasives, bactericides, tarnish inhibitors, coloring agents, and/or encapsulated or non-encapsulated perfumes.<br>
The detergent composition according to the invention can be in liquid, paste, gels, bars or granular forms. The pH (measured in aqueous solution at use concentration) will usually be neutral or alkaline, e.g. in the range of 7-11, particularly 9-11. Granular compositions according to the present invention can also be in "compact form", i.e. they may have a relatively higher density than conventional granular detergents, i.e. form 550 to 950 g/l.<br>
The lipase of the invention, or optionally another enzyme incorporated in the detergent composition, is normally incorporated in the detergent composition at a level from 0.00001% to 2% of enzyme protein by weight of the composition, preferably at a level from 0.0001% to 1% of enzyme protein by weight of the composition, more preferably at a level from 0.001% to 0.5% of enzyme protein by weight of the composition, even more preferably at a level from 0.01% to 0.2% of enzyme protein by weight of the composition.<br>
The detergent composition of the invention may comprise the lipase in an amount corresponding to 10-50,000 LU per gram of detergent, preferably 20-5,000 LU/g, e.g. 100-1000 LU/g. The detergent may be dissolved in water to produce a wash liquor containing lipolytic enzyme in an amount corresponding to 25-15,000 LU per liter of wash liquor, particularly 100 - 5000 LU/I, e.g. 300-2000 LU/l. The amount<br><br>
of lipase protein may be 0.001-10 mg per gram of detergent or 0.001-100 mg per liter of wash liquor.<br>
More specifically, the lipase of the invention may be incorporated in the detergent compositions described in WO 97/04079, WO 97/07202, WO 97/41212, PCT/DK WO 98/08939 and WO 97/43375.<br>

EXAMPLE<br>
First-wash performance at various dosages in anionic detergent<br>
The following 5 variants according to the invention were prepared and tested with 3 types of soiled swatches, and the parent lipase was included for comparison:<br><br><br>
A commercial US detergent with a high content of anionic surfactant was heated to inactivate the enzymes already present, and was used at 1.4 g/l in a Tergot-o-meter ™ laboratory washing machine. The water hardness was 6°dH (Ca:Mg 2:1), and the washing conditions were 1 cycle at 30°C for 12 minutes, followed by over-night drying on filter paper. The lipase variant was added at dosages of 6400 and 12800 LU/I. Double determinations were made in two separate washes (same TOM).<br>
The following three types of textile swatches tested were: Lard/Sudan Red on cotton Style 400, freshly prepared; wfk 20-LS Lipstick on polyester/cotton; and wfk 10-LS lipstick on cotton. The soil removal was evaluated by measuring the remission at 460 nm after the first washing cycle, and the results were expressed as AR by subtracting the remission of a blank without enzyme.<br>
The results were that each variant at each dosage showed an improved first-wash performance on each type of soiled swatch (AR of 5 to 13), whereas the parent enzyme had essentially no effect (AR = 0 ± 2) under the same conditions.<br><br>
