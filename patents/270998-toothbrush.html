FIELD OF THE INVENTION [02]     The present invention pertains to a toothbrush with an enhanced cleaning head.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [03]     A toothbrush is used to clean the teeth by removing plaque and debris from the tooth surfaces. Conventional toothbrushes provided with a flat bristle trim are limited in their ability to conform to the curvature of the teeth, to penetrate into the interproximal areas between the teeth, to sweep away the plaque and debris, and to clean along the gum line.   Additionally, such toothbrushes have a limited ability to retain dentifrice for cleaning the teeth.   During the brushing process, the dentifrice typically slips through the tufts of bristles and away from the contact between the bristles and the teeth. As a result, the dentifrice often is spread around the mouth, rather than being concentrated on the contact of the bristles with the teeth. Therefore, the efficiency of the cleaning process is reduced.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [04]     The invention pertains to a toothbrush with a novel arrangement of cleaning elements to provide superior cleaning of the teeth.<br>
[05]     In one aspect of the invention, a toothbrush includes a head having a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending from a base surface. The tooth cleaning elements generally define a loop arrangement to better retain the dentifrice proximate to the contact between the bristles and the teeth for more effective cleaning. In one preferred construction, each loop is formed by a<br>
 plurality of independently flexible cleaning elements so as to maintain user comfort and provide improved cleaning of the teeth.<br>
[06]     In another aspect of the invention, other cleaning elements are disposed within the cleaning elements forming the loop. In this construction, these central cleaning elements are strategically located to maximize the cleaning effect of the retained dentifrice. [07]     In another aspect of the invention, tooth cleaning elements are positioned along the periphery of the head. In one preferred construction, these peripheral cleaning elements are stepped and tapered to clean along the gum line and reach the interproximal areas between the teeth.<br>
[08]     The present invention also pertains to combinations of different kinds of cleaning elements on a single head that cooperate to provide a pattern for overall improved cleaning of the teeth, including effective cleaning of the rear teeth, the interproximal areas between the teeth, along the gum line, and the lingual and facial side surfaces of the teeth.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [09]     A more complete understanding of the present invention and the advantages thereof may be acquired by referring to the following description in consideration of the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numbers indicate like features, and wherein: [10]     Figure 1 is a perspective view of a toothbrush according to one or more aspects of an illustrative embodiment;<br>
[11]     Figure 2 is an enlarged plan view of a head section of the toothbrush of FIG. 1; [12]     Figure 3 is an enlarged side view of a head section of the toothbrush of FIG. 1; [13]     Figure 4 is a section view of the head section taken along line 4-4 in FIG. 2; [14]     Figure 5 is a partial section view of the head section similar to FIG. 4 showing a tooth cleaning element arrangement in isolation for clarity;<br>
[15]     Figure 6 is a partial section view of the head section similar to FIG. 4 showing another tooth cleaning element arrangement in isolation for clarity; and [16]     Figure 7 is a distal end view of the head section of the toothbrush of FIG. 1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [17]     Figures 1-7 illustrate a toothbrush 100 having a support 101 including a handle 103 and a head 105, and tooth cleaning elements 200 for cleaning the user's teeth. Handle 103 is provided for the user to readily grip and manipulate the toothbrush 100, and may be formed of many different shapes and with a variety of constructions.   Head 105 is the end portion of the support<br>
provided with tooth cleaning elements 200. The tooth cleaning elements can be attached to a base surface 109 of head 105 by any known means.<br>
[18]     In a preferred construction, base surface 109 is provided with at least one group of cleaning elements 209 that collectively define a loop configuration 214 to better retain dentifrice among the tooth cleaning elements 200 and specifically between the contact of the cleaning elements and the teeth. While the loop configuration is preferably a circle, it could be in the form of a myriad of different closed loops including without limitation ovals, squares and irregular shapes. It is believed that the use of interior concave wall surfaces within the loop will best retain and move the dentifrice on the teeth especially when the toothbrush is generally moved in the desired small circular motions to brush the teeth. Nevertheless, other shapes can be used. The loop should simply define a substantially closed configuration to retain the dentifrice. [19]     To better retain the dentifrice, each loop configuration is preferably defined by cleaning elements composed of elastomeric wall members. Although the loop configurations could be formed by tightly packed, elongate bristle tufts, such arrangements will permit a greater escape of the dentifrice than the elastomeric wall members. Further, although the loop configurations could be completely closed structures, they are preferably only substantially closed and each formed by a plurality of independently flexible cleaning elements 209a-d. In this way, the cleaning elements are able to provide a limited and controlled flow of the dentifrice to the outer cleaning elements and maintain sufficient flexibility to provide greater user comfort and improved cleaning by elements 209. In the preferred construction, as seen in Figure 2, each loop construction is defined by four elastomeric wall members 209a-d each defining an arc segment that is approximately a quarter of a circle. As noted above, adjacent arc segments are spaced apart to define gaps 212 that permit a limited outward flow of dentifrice and independent flexing of each wall member. The gaps also aid the cleaning of cleaning elements 209 by permitting water to flush through the loops. The gaps, however, are preferably kept small to limit the escape of the dentifrice. While four segments have been illustrated to define each loop, other numbers of segments could be used. The wall members can be formed of any elastomeric material known for use as tooth cleaning elements. Finally, although the arc segments are preferably independent cleaning members, the loop could also be formed as a single member provided with slits to define gaps 212 and independently flexible cleaning elements 209a-d. [20]     As best seen in Figure 2, the preferred embodiment includes three loops 214a-c that are each positioned front to back along longitudinal axis a-a. In this way, a large portion of the<br>
 dentifrice applied to the tooth cleaning elements can be retained to clean the user's teeth. Nevertheless, one, two or more than three loops could be used. Moreover, the loops could be arranged in other patterns including non-aligned arrangements or positioned off of axis a-a. [21]     In a preferred construction, a central cleaning element 207 is disposed within each loop 214; although more than one central cleaning element 207 could be provided within each loop when larger loops are used. With this arrangement, dentifrice stays near the tips of cleaning elements 207 during a brushing operation for efficient cleaning. In the preferred construction, the concave nature of the inside surfaces of cleaning elements 209a-d directs the dentifrice to cleaning elements 207a-c during the sweeping or oscillating motion of head 105. [22]     Central cleaning elements 207 are each preferably formed as bristle tufts for effectively cleaning the teeth. Nevertheless, one or more elastomer members may be used to form the dista cleaning elements in lieu of or in addition to the use of bristles.<br>
[23]     The bristles of cleaning elements 203 as well as the bristles of other tufts discussed belov are preferably composed of a nylon made from a material such as, for example, a nylon material marketed by Dupont under the name BRILLIANCE. Nevertheless, other materials could be used. The bristles in toothbrush 100 also preferably have a circular cross-sectional shape, but could have other cross-sections as well. The round bristles in toothbrush may be composed on a nylon marketed by Dupont under the name of TYNEX. The diameter of the round bristles are preferably 0.007 inches - 0.008 inches thick or have other thicknesses depending on the desired cleaning action of the bristles.   The tooth cleaning elements are connected to the toothbrush using known manufacturing methods for oral care products.<br>
[24]     With reference to Figures 1 and 2, an additional outer ring of cleaning elements 211a, 21 lb is disposed in a central region of head 105 in a generally arcuate arrangement about cleaning elements 209a-d of central loop 214b. These outer arcuate cleaning elements 21 la-b are preferably defined by two opposing arcuate cleaning elements which are arranged generally symmetrical on each side of the longitudinal axis a-a of head 105.   As shown in Figure 2, the outer cleaning elements 21 la-b surround the loop cleaning elements 209a-d in the central region of head 105 to effectively use this space on the head.   In a preferred arrangement, the loop cleaning elements 209a-d in the central region may be disposed generally concentrically within outer cleaning elements 21 la-b. The dentifrice flowing through gaps 212 in the sides of loop 214b will be used by outer cleaning elements 211. While the outer arcuate cleaning elements<br>
|21 la, b are preferably defined by elongate bristle tufts for effective brushing of the teeth, they could be formed of one or more elastomeric members in lieu of or in addition to the bristles. [25]     Figures 4-6 are sectional views of head 105 that reveal the preferred height characteristics of cleaning elements 207, 209 and 211. In the preferred construction, central cleaning elements 207a and 207c are shorter than cleaning elements 209 forming loops 214a, 214c to facilitate enhanced brushing of the lingual and facial tooth surfaces with the dentifrice retained by loops 214a, c. The difference between the first height H1 of cleaning elements 207a, c and the second height H2 of cleaning elements 209 is preferably about 0.20-2.0 mm, but there could be other variations. Central cleaning element 207b is taller than cleaning elements 209 forming central loop 214b to facilitate better interproximal cleaning as well as cleaning of the crowns of the molars. The difference between the third height H3 of cleaning element 207b and the second height H2 of cleaning elements 209 is preferably about 0.20-2.0 mm, but other variations could be used. While this construction is preferred to maximize the cleaning of various surfaces in the mouth, other variations in the heights of the cleaning elements could be used as desired. For example, central cleaning elements 207 could all have the same heights with each other and as loop cleaning elements 209, or have heights that are higher or lower than the loop cleaning elements in different ways. In another example, the central cleaning elements 209 may have heights that are higher than the loop cleaning elements 209 in a staple configuration of toothbrush 100.<br>
[26]     Head 105 also includes distal cleaning elements 203a-b at the free end 107. In the preferred construction, a pair of adjacent distal cleaning elements 203a, 203b straddle longitudinal axis a-a, although they could be formed by one or more than two cleaning elements. Distal cleaning elements 203a-b protrude higher from base surface 109 than the tips of the other tooth cleaning elements. The tips of each bristle tuft 203 a-b collectively define an outermost cleaning surface 204 that is angled with respect to base surface 109 of head 105. By way of example, cleaning surface 204 is preferably at an angle 0 of about 30 degrees to base surface 109, but may also range between 10-50 degrees. It should be recognized that other angular values are possible. The extension and angular orientation of cleaning surface 204 of distal cleaning elements 203a-b better enable the user to reach and better clean the teeth in the back of the mouth. Cleaning elements 203a-b also can be used to dig into the crevices between the teeth and into the crown portions of the molars. Finally, as can been seen in Figure 7, the outermost<br>
 cleaning surface 204 also preferably is sloped laterally downward (to form a crowned surface) to assist in the removal of debris from the teeth.<br>
[271     Peripheral cleaning elements 205a-c are positioned near free end 107 and along each side 108 of head 105. These peripheral cleaning elements 205a-c are preferably formed by a plurality of bristle tufts that are arranged generally symmetrical with respect to the longitudinal axis a-a. Cleaning elements 205a-c are positioned rearward and laterally of distal cleaning elements 203a-b. Similarly, peripheral cleaning elements 215a-c are also positioned symmetrically about axis a-a along each side 108 near proximal end 111 of head 105. These two groups of cleaning elements 205a-c, 215a-c are generally mirror images of each other, but could have other constructions. Both the distal and proximal peripheral cleaning elements 205a-c, 215a-c are generally configured to enable the user to clean along the gum line and in the crevices between the teeth. In the illustrative embodiment, three bristle tufts form each group of peripheral cleaning elements 205a-c, 215a-c. Nevertheless, more or fewer bristle tufts in these groups may be used. Further, one or more elastomeric elements may be used to define the peripheral cleaning elements in place of or with the bristles.<br>
[2i]     As shown in Figure 3, the tips of the peripheral cleaning elements 205a-c and 215a-c protrude higher from base surface 109 than the tips of the interior cleaning elements 207, 209, 211. In a preferred embodiment, two groups of peripheral cleaning elements 205, 215 are arranged along each side 108 of head 105. Each group of peripheral cleaning elements includes three generally aligned tufts of bristles, although other numbers of tufts could be used. The center tuft of cleaning elements 205b, 215b in each group of peripheral cleaning elements protrudes outward farther from base surface 109 than the others tufts 205a, 205c, 215a, 215c. This arrangement allows deeper engagement of the tooth surfaces along the gum line with cleaning elements 205b or 215b, while stimulating the gums with cleaning elements 205a, 205c and 215a, 215c. Moreover, each of the tufts has tapered ends 206, 216 to improve the cleaning of the interproximal areas and along the gum line.<br>
[29]     Proximal cleaning elements 213a-b are positioned near the proximal end 111 of head 105. Preferably a pair of bristle tufts straddle longitudinal axis a-a, but one or more than two cleaning elements could be formed at the proximal end of the head. These proximal cleaning elements 213a,b are preferably defined by bristle tufts, but could also include or be defined by one or more elastomeric members.<br>
[3ft]     While the bristles are discussed above as being preferably 0.007 inches - 0.008 inches thick, it may be desirable to have thinner bristles to provide for a more comfortable feel. For example, some of the cleaning elements discussed above could be formed with bristles that are approximately .004 inches to .005 inches thick, which are generally recognized in the trade as "extra soft" bristles used in toothbrushes for consumers with sensitive teeth, while other bristles included in tufts such as 203 and 213 might be slightly thicker (e.g., approximately .006 inches thick) to minimize premature wear on such tufts of bristles. Alternatively, the majority of the bristles could be .006 inches thick, which is still considered "soft" as compared with traditional bristles that are .007 - .008 inches thick. Benefits of the use of thinner bristles include better cleaning through a thinner bristle tip with increased penetration capabilities, increased comfort through bristles that are easy on the gums and sensitive teeth, and improved bristle wear from the use of very soft bristles.<br>
[31]     Additional benefits are obtained by using thin bristles in combination with elastomeric cleaning elements 209. Whereas isolated regions of thin bristles (205, 211, 215 for example) might tend to collapse or "mash down" in response to normal brushing, the use of elastomeric cleaning elements would act to prevent excess wear of the bristles by restricting the penetration of those bristles. In other words, the bristles are allowed to stand mostly straight throughout brushing which is not typical with very soft bristle brushes. Thus, the elastomeric cleaning elements function as a stop or barrier to the overextension of the brush downward toward the user's teeth, as well as toward the back of the user's mouth. Since extra soft bristles provide minimal resistance to movement across the teeth, there is a danger that the user might overextend the brushing stroke and force the free end 107 of the brush into contact with the back of the user's mouth or gums. Thus, the use of elastomeric cleaning elements in combination with extra soft bristles would provide the added resistance necessary to prevent overextension of the brushing stroke.<br>
[32]     To further promote or visually communicate the soft feeling of the bristles, such bristles could be semi-transparent or translucent. The interaction of translucent bristles with elastomeric cleaning elements 209 ereates several interesting phenomena. First, in the present embodiment, the elastomeric cleaning elements surround, and are surrounded by, bristles, such that the toothbrush head exhibits a colored glow based on the color of the elastomeric elements and the mariner in which light is retained, reflected and refracted in and around the elastomeric elements and translucent bristles. Thus, colored elastomer (or the like) embedded within a translucent<br>
I bristle field emits a glow that is further reflective and demonstrative of the sensitive nature of the soft bristles and tends to appear softer than simply a solid color standing alone. This tends to be particularly evident when view in perspective (such as Fig. 1).<br>
[33]     However, when the brush is viewed from the side as in Figs. 3 and 4, addWonal visual highlights become pronounced. First, because the translucent bristles surround the colored elastomeric members, the presence of the elastomeric members becomes apparent through the bristles. Thus, the bristles from the side of the brush assume a two-toned appearance that is darker along most of the bristle length and lighter at the bristle tips (i.e., H3-H4 in Fig. 6), which appearance is obtained through the spatial interaction between the colored elastomeric members in the background that partially show their color and existence through the translucent bristles in the foreground. Second, because the colored elastomeric members are shorter (Fig. 4) than the translucent bristles, the bristle tips become highlighted when the brush is viewed from the side as there are no colored members in the background to "dull" the appearance of the tips. Thus, the "highlighted" bristle tips, which tend to be the focus of attention, also tend to be the first location to exhibit and show wear. Therefore, the interaction between the colored members and the translucent bristles as discussed above creates a pseudo-wear indicator in that the eye is drawn to the highlighted tip and the one location of the bristle that is first likely to exhibit wear. Such a wear indicator would avoid the need to get up close and personal with the bristles to determine if there is excessive wear on the bristles.<br>
[34]     A similar two-toned bristle appearance can be created by end-rounding the translucent bristle tips to create a French Manicure-type of tip that appears "opaque" as compared with the remainder of the translucent bristle that appears "shiny." By varying the penetration of the end rounding units on the bristles, the depth of the opaque or shiny appearance can be similarly varied.   However, the end-rounding and subsequent removal of the "shine" also makes the end-rounded surface slightly more abrasive, which could provide greater cleaning efficacy. [35]     In addition, the tips of a plurality, majority, or most of the soft bristles could be tapered to create an even finer bristle tip, which feature is consistent with the use of tapered bristles on traditional "sensitive" brushes. Such tapered bristles would preferably extend around the periphery of the brush head where contact is first made between the bristles and the gingival tissue. Bristles 207 could also be tapered as desired.<br>
[36]     The inventive aspects may be practiced for a manual toothbrush or a powered toothbrush. In operation, the previously described features, individually and/or in any combination, improves<br>
, cleaning performance of toothbrushes. These advantages are also achieved by the cleaning elements and the synergistic effects. While the various features of the toothbrush 100 work together to achieve the advantages previously described, it is recognized that individual features and sub-combinations of these features can be used to obtain some of the aforementioned advantages without the necessity to adopt all of these features. This unique combination of elements gives exceptional cleaning power in a compact head space. [37]     While the invention has been described with respect to specific examples including presently preferred modes of carrying out the invention, those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are numerous variations and permutations of the above described systems and techniques. Thus, the spirit and scope of the invention should be construed broadly as set forth in the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
