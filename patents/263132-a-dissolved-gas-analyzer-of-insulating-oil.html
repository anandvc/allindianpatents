TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
DISSOLVED GAS ANALYZER OF INSULATING OIL AND METHOD FOR<br>
ANALYZING DISSOLVED GAS ANALYZER OF INSULATING OIL<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a dissolved gas<br>
analyzer of insulating oil such as an insulating oil-filled<br>
transformer and a method for analyzing dissolved gas<br>
analyzer of insulating oil.<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
One of the prior art of the dissolved gas analyzer of<br>
insulating oil relating to insulating oil in the<br>
transformer which is oil-filled or oil-sealed equipment is<br>
disclosed in the Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open<br>
Publication No. Sho 59 (1984)-160745. In this prior art, a<br>
gas permeable material is used to separate the gas in the<br>
insulating oil, and the separated gas is detected by a<br>
plurality of semiconductor sensors which react with various<br>
types of gases. A plurality of calculation formulas which<br>
show the relationship between gas concentration and<br>
reactivity as a simultaneous algebraic equation is used to<br>
solv the gas concentration, thereby the concentration of<br>
hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ethane,<br>
ethylene, and acetylene are obtained.<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
Another prior art relating to a dissolved gas analyzer<br>
is disclosed in the Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open<br>
Publication No. Hei 5 (1990)-52787. In this prior art,<br>
gases dissolved in the oil are extracted by various<br>
extraction methods and hydrogen or acetylene in the gases<br>
is detected respectively by using a semiconductor sensor<br>
such a sensor which reacts only with hydrogen or acetylene<br>
without the step of separation into single gas.<br>
Similarly, an other prior art relating to a dissolved<br>
gas analyzer is disclosed in the Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 6 (1991)-160329.<br>
In this prior art, gases dissolved in the oil are extracted<br>
by various extraction methods and hydrogen, carbon monoxide<br>
or combustible gases is detected respectively by using<br>
semiconductor sensors such as sensors which reacts only<br>
with hydrogen, carbon monoxide, or total combustible gases<br>
such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, ethane,<br>
ethylene or acetylene without the step of separation into<br>
single gas.<br>
In addition, if abnormalities such discharging or<br>
overheating occurs inside the oil-immersed transformer,<br>
insulating oil is resolved and gas is generated in the oil.<br>
The amount of gas generated in the oil and the pattern of<br>
gas generation varies depending on the type of abnormality<br>
occurring inside the transformer. As a result, by referring<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
to past examples and adjusting the amount of gas generated<br>
and the pattern of gas generation, it is possible to<br>
determine abnormal types or levels. Thus, in the past, one<br>
method of deterioration or abnormality detection in the<br>
oil-immersed transformer has been analysis of the gases<br>
dissolved in the insulating oil (simply called dissolved<br>
gas analysis hereinafter).<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A semiconductor sensor formed from metallic oxides such<br>
as tin oxide, tungsten oxide, and zirconium oxide which is<br>
a general use semiconductor which detects gas using a<br>
dissolved gas analyzer based on various gas detection<br>
methods reacts with various gases, but on the other hand,<br>
there is a problem in that the concentration of a<br>
particular gas cannot be accurately detected. Furthermore,<br>
another property of the semiconductor sensor is that the<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
sensor output is not fixed even for a fixed concentration<br>
of a particular gas and this is problematic in that the<br>
sensor output changes. This is caused by the effect of<br>
water particles or contaminants which adhere to the surface<br>
of the semiconductor sensor.<br>
In the method for detecting gas described in Patent<br>
Document 1 and Patent Document 4, only the gas in the<br>
insulating oil is measured using the semiconductor sensor,<br>
but even in that case, the output is not fixed and there is<br>
a problem in that measurement repeatability cannot be<br>
obtained.<br>
In the gas detection method of Patent Document 2 and<br>
Patent Document 3 also, gas concentration is obtained using<br>
a semiconductor which has gas sensitivity, but the sensor<br>
output is not fixed and measurement repeatability is not<br>
obtained.<br>
In addition, in the gas detection method of Patent<br>
Document 2 and Patent Document 3, gas concentration is<br>
obtained by using a semiconductor sensor which has gas<br>
selectivity, but the semiconductor sensors that have gas<br>
sensitivity can only detect hydrogen, carbon monoxide and<br>
acetylene and cannot detect the gas component<br>
concentrations for methane, ethane and ethylene.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
dissolved gas analyzer of insulating oil and a method for<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
analyzing dissolved gas analyzer of insulating oil to<br>

present invention comprising: a gas extractor to draw<br>
insulating oil from an oil-filled equipment, a gas detector<br>
having a plurality of semiconductor sensors for detecting<br>
concentration of a component gas from a plurality of<br>

the gas extractor; a sample gas supply system for sampling<br>
the plurality of component gases in the insulating oil<br>
drawn into the gas extractor and supplying to the gas<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Next, a dissolved gas analyzer of insulating oil which<br>
is an embodiment of the present invention is explained by<br>
referring drawings.<br>
[Embodiment 1 of the invention]<br>
Fig. 1 shows the structure of the dissolved gas<br>
analyzer 20 of insulating oil installed in the insulating<br>
oil immersed transformer as the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention and this is the type of dissolved gas<br>
analyzer of insulating oil that is attached to the<br>
transformer, inside of which is filled or sealed with<br>
insulating oil. The dissolved gas analyzer of insulating<br>
oil is installed in the oil immersed transformer of this<br>
embodiment of the present invention performs dissolved gas<br>
analysis in the insulating oil for hydrogen, carbon<br>
monoxide, acetylene, ethylene, methane and ethane.<br>
In Fig. 1, the inside of the oil immersed transformer 1<br>
is filled with insulating oil 2. The dissolved gas analyzer<br>
20 is provided with the gas extractor 3 which causes<br>
insulating oil to flow into and out of the oil immersed<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
transformer 1 connected to the oil immersed transformer 1<br>
via the pipe 25A and the pipe 25B, and the gas generated in<br>
the insulating oil 2 filled or sealed in the oil immersed<br>
transformer 1 is extracted by using the bubbling method in<br>
the gas extractor 3.<br>
The main body of the gas extractor 3 has an open and<br>
close valve 4. The pipe 25A and 25B have an oil feed pump<br>
5A and 5B respectively and the oil feed pump 5A supplies a<br>
prescribed amount of the insulating oil from the oil<br>
immersed transformer 1 to the gas extractor 3. In addition,<br>
the oil feed pump 5B returns the insulating oil 2 from the<br>
gas extractor 3 to the oil immersed transformer 1 after the<br>
gas has been extracted.<br>
There is a nitrogen pump 6 which supplies nitrogen and<br>
the nitrogen is led from the nitrogen pump 6 to the four-<br>
way switching valve 10 which is described hereinafter via<br>
the nitrogen supply pipe 18A. There is also an oxygen pump<br>
7 which supplies oxygen and the oxygen is led from the<br>
oxygen pump 7 to the gas regulator 13 which is described<br>
hereinafter, via the oxygen supply pipe 18B.<br>
The oxygen supply pipe 18A and the nitrogen supply pipe<br>
18B have the regulators 8A and 8B respectively, and the<br>
pressure of the nitrogen and oxygen supplied from the<br>
oxygen pump 6 and the nitrogen pump 7 to the four-way<br>
switching valve 10 and the gas regulator 13 can be<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
regulated.<br>
Similarly, the oxygen supply pipe 18A and the nitrogen<br>
supply pipe 18B have flow meters 9A and 9B respectively and<br>
the flow rate of nitrogen and oxygen supplied from the<br>
nitrogen pump 6 and the oxygen pump 7 to the four-way<br>
switching valve 10 and the gas regulator 13 respectively<br>
can be measured.<br>
The four-way switching valve 10 is connected to the<br>
nitrogen supply pipe 18A for supplying nitrogen from the<br>
nitrogen pump 6 and the gas extraction pipe 18C1 which<br>
leads the nitrogen supplied via the nitrogen supply pipe<br>
18A to the gas extractor 3.<br>
By switching the four-way switching valve 10, the<br>
nitrogen gas forms a path for supplying nitrogen gas from<br>
the nitrogen pump 6 to the gas extractor 3 via the air<br>
supply pipe 18A and the gas extraction pipe 18C1.<br>
The four-way switching valve 10 connects the gas<br>
extraction valve 18C2 which leads the gas mixture of<br>
dissolved gas generated in the insulating oil 2 which is<br>
included inside the oil immersed transformer 1 and<br>
dissolved gas mixture supply pipe 18D which leads the gas<br>
mixture of dissolved gases led via the gas extraction pipe<br>
18C2 to the gas regulator 13.<br>
By switching the four-way switching valve 10, a flow<br>
path is formed which supplies gas mixture of dissolved<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
gases from the gas extractor 3 to the gas detector 15<br>
described hereinafter via the gas extraction pipe 18C2 and<br>
the dissolved gas mixture supply pipe 18D.<br>
The gas extraction pipe 18C1 has an air pump 11, and<br>
when this air pump 11 is operated, bubbling occurs. In<br>
addition, the gas extractor 3 has a filter 12 and when the<br>
gas mixture of dissolved gases generated in the insulating<br>
oil included inside the oil immersed transformer 1 that is<br>
led to the gas extractor 3 is led out to the four-way<br>
switching valve 10 from the gas extractor 3 via the gas<br>
extraction pipe 18C2, the insulating oil that is mixed into<br>
the gas mixture of dissolved gases in an atomized state is<br>
removed.<br>
The gas mixture of dissolved gases generated in the<br>
insulating oil included inside the oil immersed transformer<br>
1 that is led to the gas extractor 3 is supplied to the gas<br>
detector 15 via the gas extraction pipe 18C2, the dissolved<br>
gas mixture supply pipe 18D and the sample gas supply pipe<br>
18E.<br>
The connection portion of the dissolved gas mixture<br>
supply pipe 18D and the sample gas supply pipe 18E has a<br>
gas regulator 13 and the oxygen supply pipe 18B which<br>
supplies oxygen from the oxygen pump 7 is connected to the<br>
gas regulator 13.<br>
In addition, oxygen is mixed with the gas mixture of<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
dissolved gases supplied to the gas detector 15 in a<br>
prescribed proportion using the gas regulator 13. The<br>
sample gas generated at the gas regulator 13 is supplied to<br>
the thermostat 14 via the sample gas supply pipe 18E, and<br>
the temperature of the sample gas which is a gas mixture in<br>
which nitrogen, oxygen and dissolved gas are mixed in the<br>
gas regulator 13 is regulated to a prescribed temperature<br>
by the thermostat 14.<br>
The gas detector 15 has semiconductor sensors formed<br>
from metal oxides such as tin oxide, tungsten oxide,<br>
zirconium oxide and the gas mixture of nitrogen and oxygen<br>
and the gas mixture of nitrogen, oxygen and gas dissolved<br>
in the insulating oil respectively which are the reference<br>
gases, are measured using the semiconductor sensor and<br>
these measured values are output to the computer 16 as<br>
output signals.<br>
At the computer 16, the concentration of the gas<br>
component of the gas dissolved in the insulating oil is<br>
calculated by computations based on the output signal from<br>
the semiconductor sensor in the gas detection section 15<br>
and the calculated concentration of the gas composition of<br>
the gas in the dissolved in the insulating oil is displayed<br>
on a monitor or the like.<br>
In addition the computer 16 sends commands to the<br>
elements comprising the dissolved gas analyzer disposed in<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
the insulating oil immersed transformer in the embodiment<br>
of this invention which include the ON and OFF for the<br>
pumps and the switching operations and open and close<br>
operations for the switch valve and the exhaust valves.<br>
The gas composition of the sample gas in which nitrogen,<br>
oxygen and gas dissolved in the insulating oil that was<br>
detected by the semiconductor sensor disposed in the gas<br>
detector 15 are sent to the outside via the exhaust pipe<br>
18G after the concentration of each of the gas components<br>
is detected, but the exhaust pipe 18G has a check valve 17<br>
which prevents the air from outside from flowing into the<br>
gas detector 15.<br>
Of the aforementioned pipes, the gas extraction pipe<br>
18C1 is a pipe which runs from the four-way switching valve<br>
10 via the air pump 11 that is installed in the gas<br>
extraction pipe 18C1, the gas extractor 3, the filter 12<br>
installed in the gas extractor 3 and the gas extraction<br>
pipe 18C2 and returns once again to the four-way switching<br>
valve 10.<br>
Also, the dissolved gas mixture supply pipe 18D is a<br>
pipe which leads the gas mixture of nitrogen and gas<br>
dissolved in the insulating oil to the thermostat 14 and<br>
the gas detector 15. The sample gas supply pipe 18E is a<br>
pipe which leads the gas mixture of gas dissolved in the<br>
insulating oil, nitrogen and oxygen that is generated at<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
the gas regulator 13 to the thermostat 14 and the gas<br>
detector 15.<br>
Next, the steps of the dissolved gas analyzer for the<br>
dissolved gas analyzer of insulating oil installed in the<br>
oil immersed transformer which is shown in Fig. 1 as the<br>
embodiment of the present invention are shown in Fig. 2. In<br>
Fig. 2, in the measuring operation, first the measurement<br>
preparation step 101 is performed.<br>
Next, dissolved gas extraction step 102 is performed.<br>
Dissolved gas extraction step 102 is performed in parallel<br>
with the nitrogen and oxygen gas mixture measurement step<br>
103. Finally, sample gas measurement step 104 is performed.<br>
The gas concentration calculation step 105 in which the<br>
concentration of each component gas is measured based on<br>
the measurement results from the step 103 of measuring the<br>
nitrogen and oxygen gas mixture and the step 104 of<br>
measuring the sample gas is performed. Each of the steps in<br>
the measurement operation is repeated.<br>
To explain more specifically, in the step 101 of<br>
measurement preparation, the four-way switching valve 10 is<br>
operated as shown in Fig. 1 and nitrogen from the nitrogen<br>
pump 6 is supplied to the four-way switching valve 10 via<br>
the nitrogen supply pipe 18A. The supplied nitrogen flows<br>
from the nitrogen supply pipe 18A via the four-way<br>
switching valve 10 and into the gas extractor 3 from the<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
gas extraction pipe 18C.<br>
Subsequently, nitrogen passes through the gas extractor<br>
3 and flows downstream to the gas extraction pipe 18C2 and<br>
the dissolved gas mixture supply pipe 18D, and the inside<br>
of the devices and the flow paths which reach the dissolved<br>
gas mixture supply pipe 18D from the nitrogen supply pipe<br>
18A are displaced with nitrogen.<br>
In addition, oxygen is supplied to the gas regulator 13<br>
from the oxygen pump 7 via the oxygen supply pipe 18B, and<br>
the supplied oxygen is mixed with nitrogen gas in the gas<br>
regulator 13 and forms the gas mixture of nitrogen and<br>
oxygen which will become the reference gas.<br>
Subsequently, the gas mixture of nitrogen and oxygen<br>
which is the reference gas generated at the gas regulator<br>
13 flows down to the thermostat 14 and the gas detector 15<br>
via the sample gas supply pipe 18E and the inside of the<br>
devices and the flow paths are replaced with the gas<br>
mixture of nitrogen and oxygen which is the reference gas.<br>
Next, in step 102 of dissolved gas extraction, as shown<br>
in Fig. 3, the four-way switching valve 10 is operated and<br>
switching is done. In addition, by switching the four-way<br>
switching valve 10, the flow path A which forms a closed<br>
system of the gas extraction pipe 18C1, the gas extraction<br>
pipe 18C2, and the gas extractor 3, as well as the flow<br>
path B which supplies nitrogen from the nitrogen pump 6 to<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
the gas regulator 13 via the nitrogen supply pipe 18A and<br>
the four-way switching valve 10.<br>
In addition, by supplying oxygen from the oxygen pump 7<br>
to the gas regulator 13 via the oxygen supply pipe 18B, the<br>
gas mixture of nitrogen and oxygen which is the reference<br>
gas in which oxygen, is mixed with the nitrogen that flows<br>
down the flow path B in the gas regulator 13. This gas<br>
mixture of nitrogen and oxygen which is the reference gas<br>
is supplied to the thermostat 14 and the gas detector 15<br>
via the sample gas supply pipe 18E.<br>
The gas extraction operation is performed in the flow<br>
path A. That is to say, the gas extraction operation in the<br>
flow path A is one in which first, the release valve 4<br>
provided in the gas extractor 3 is put in the release state<br>
and the oil feed pump 5A in the pipe 25A is actuated and<br>
the insulating oil 2 included inside the oil immersed<br>
transformer 1 is supplied to the gas extractor 3.<br>
Next, after the pouring of the insulating oil 2 into<br>
the gas extractor 3 is complete, the release valve closes<br>
simultaneously and the air pump 11 which is in the gas<br>
extraction pipe 18C1 which forms the flow path A is<br>
activated and the nitrogen inside the flow path A is<br>
circulated and sampling of the dissolved gas that is<br>
dissolved in the insulating oil 2 that is poured into the<br>
gas extractor 3 due to bubbling is performed.<br><br>
- 19 -<br>
Bubbling refers to a sampling method for sample gas in<br>
which, in a sealed system, an inert gas such as nitrogen<br>
and the like is blown into a liquid in which a gas for<br>
sampling is dissolved and after the gas dissolved in the<br>
liquid and the gas above the liquid surface are brought to<br>
equilibrium, the gas above the liquid surface is sampled.<br>
Nitrogen is used as the inert gas for performing<br>
bubbling because it prevents oxygen from mixing in the<br>
insulating oil. The insulating oil after dissolved gas is<br>
sampled from the insulating oil 2 that is included in the<br>
transformer 1 is returned to the transformer 1 from the gas<br>
extractor 3 and then re-used, but in the case where oxygen<br>
is mixed in the insulating oil 2, there is the concern that<br>
the insulating oil 2 and the insulating paper will<br>
deteriorate due to oxygen. For this reason, oxygen or inert<br>
gases such as helium, argon and the like are used for<br>
bubbling.<br>
At the time of bubbling, the relationship between the<br>
bubbling time and the gas concentration in nitrogen of the<br>
inert gas which circulates inside the sealed system is<br>
examined before hand so that an appropriate time is<br>
selected.<br>
The relationship between the concentration of the<br>
dissolved gas in insulating oil and the concentration of<br>
gas extracted as the sample gas by bubbling is different<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
depending on the gas composition. As a result, the<br>
correlation between the amount of dissolved gas in the<br>
insulating oil and the amount of gas extracted by bubbling<br>
can be obtained in advance.<br>
Next, step 103 of measuring the gas mixture of nitrogen<br>
and oxygen which is the reference gas, measurement of the<br>
gas mixture of nitrogen and oxygen which is the reference<br>
gas is performed in the gas detector 15 via the flow path B<br>
which is formed by the switching operation of the four-way<br>
switching valve 10.<br>
That is to say, nitrogen from the nitrogen pump 6 is<br>
supplied to the gas regulator 13 via the nitrogen supply<br>
pipe 18A and the four-way switching valve 10, and oxygen<br>
from the oxygen pump 7 is supplied to the gas regulator 13<br>
via the nitrogen supply pipe 18B and the gas mixture of<br>
nitrogen and oxygen (oxygen 20%, nitrogen 80%) which is the<br>
reference gas in which the composition proportions of both<br>
are adjusted at the gas regulator 13 is supplied to the gas<br>
detector 15 via the sample gas supply pipe 18E and the<br>
thermostat 14.<br>
When the detected output of the reference gas that is<br>
detected at the semiconductor sensors SI- S7 disposed in<br>
the gas detector section 15 becomes stable, the detected<br>
output is input into the computer 16 as the sensor output<br>
for the gas mixture of nitrogen and oxygen which is the<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
reference gas.<br>
Next, in step 104 of measuring sample gas, as shown in<br>
Fig. 4, the four-way switching valve 10 is switched and<br>
nitrogen from the nitrogen pump 6 is supplied to the gas<br>
extractor 3 via the nitrogen supply pipe 18A, the four-way<br>
switching valve 10 and the gas extraction pipe 18C1, and<br>
the supplied nitrogen flows down to the gas regulator 13<br>
from the gas extractor 3 via the gas extraction pipe 18C2<br>
and the dissolved gas mixture supply pipe 18D.<br>
According to this operation, the gas mixture of<br>
nitrogen and oxygen which was sampled from the flow path A<br>
is pushed out by the nitrogen supplied from the nitrogen<br>
pump 6 and led to the gas regulator 13. The oxygen supplied<br>
from the oxygen pump 7 via the oxygen supply pipe 18B is<br>
added to the gas mixture of dissolved gas led to the gas<br>
regulator 13 at the gas regulator 13 and the sample gas is<br>
generated.<br>
In addition, the sample gas generated at the gas<br>
regulator 13 is supplied to the gas detector 15 and the<br>
concentration of the components of the sample gas is<br>
detected. Here, the sample gas is formed by adding oxygen<br>
to the gas mixture of dissolved gases in the regulator 13<br>
because oxygen is necessary for measurement of the sample<br>
gas using the semiponductor sensors S1 - S7 provided in the<br>
gas detector 15.<br><br>
- 22 -<br>
By switching the gas supplied to the semiconductor<br>
sensors S1 - S7 provided in the gas detector 15 from the<br>
gas mixture of nitrogen and oxygen which is the reference<br>
gas to the sample gas, there is a great change in the<br>
sensor output of the sample gas detected at the<br>
semiconductor sensor S1 - S7 around the time of switching<br>
of the supplied gas. When the sensor output is<br>
substantially fixed to be stable after the change in the<br>
sensor output, the sensor outputs are input into the<br>
computer 16 as the sensor outputs of the semiconductor<br>
sensors S1 - S7 for the sample gas.<br>
After the sample gas is measured by the semiconductor<br>
sensors S1 - S7 of the gas detector 15, nitrogen from the<br>
nitrogen pump 6 is supplied to the gas extractor 3 while<br>
actuating the oil feed pump 5B provided in the pipe 25B and<br>
the insulating oil 2 supplied to the gas extractor 3 is<br>
returned to the oil immersed transformer 1. The series of<br>
operations is performed automatically upon receiving<br>
commands from the computer 16.<br>
Fig. 5 is a pattern diagram showing the sensor output<br>
of the gas detected at the semiconductor sensors S1 - S7 of<br>
the gas detector 15 and the horizontal axis shows time t<br>
while the vertical axis shows the electrical resistance R<br>
of the sensor output detected at the semiconductor sensors<br>
S1 - S7, and the sensor output is shown by the curve in the<br><br>
- 23 -<br>
drawing.<br>
In Fig. 5, the measurement time from time t = to to t =<br>
tl shows the sensor output when the gas mixture of oxygen<br>
and nitrogen (oxygen 20%, nitrogen 80%) which is the<br>
reference gas.<br>
In addition, the measurement time from time t = tl to t<br>
= t2 shows the sensor output when the sample gas is<br>
measured and the measurement time from time t = t2 to t =<br>
t3 shows the sensor output when the gas mixture of oxygen<br>
and nitrogen which is the reference gas is measured a<br>
second time.<br>
First, at the measurement time t = to to t = tl, the<br>
electrical resistance R which is the sensor output of the<br>
reference gas at the time t = tl shows R0. The sensor<br>
output from time t = 0 to t = tl changes mildly because the<br>
sensor output is drifting.<br>
The measurement time from time t = tl to t = t2 shows<br>
the sensor output when the sample gas supplied by switching<br>
from the reference gas by the operation of the four-way<br>
switching valve 10 is measured. By starting supply of the<br>
sample gas at time t = tl and doing measurement, the sensor<br>
output is suddenly reduced and then immediately, the<br>
changes in the sensor output become mild and the sensor<br>
output becomes stable at time t = t2.<br>
The electrical resistance R which is the sensor output<br><br>
- 24 -<br>
of the sample gas at the time t = t2 shows Rl.<br>
The measurement time from time t = t2 to t = t3 shows<br>
the sensor output when there is a switch once again from<br>
supply of the sample gas to the reference gas by the<br>
switching operation of the four-way switching valve 10 and<br>
the gas mixture of nitrogen and oxygen which is the<br>
reference gas is measured. By starting supply of the gas<br>
mixture of nitrogen and oxygen which is the reference gas<br>
at time t = t2 and doing measurement, the sensor output is<br>
suddenly increased and then the changes in the sensor<br>
output become mild and the sensor output becomes stable at<br>
time t = t3.<br>
The electrical resistance R which is the sensor output<br>
of the reference gas at the time t = t3 shows R2. The<br>
sensor output from the time t = 3 to the t = 4 does not<br>
change much and is in a stable state.<br>
In this case, the electrical resistance R0 of the<br>
sensor output is detected in advance for the gas mixture of<br>
nitrogen and oxygen which is the reference gas using the<br>
semiconductor sensors and registered at the computer 16. In<br>
addition, the sample gas will be the gas component for<br>
analysis, and the electric resistance Rl which is RCO1 of<br>
the sensor output using the semiconductor sensors in the<br>
case of a specific concentration such a gas concentration<br>
of 10 ppm for carbon monoxide gas is detected in advance<br><br>
- 25 -<br>
and registered at the computer 16. Similarly, the value for<br>
the electric resistance R of the sensor output using the<br>
semiconductor sensors in the case of a specific<br>
concentration can be detected in advance and registered at<br>
the computer 16 for hydrogen, acetylene, ethylene, methane<br>
and ethane respectively which are other gases for detection.<br>
In addition, as described above, by measuring the<br>
reference gas and the sample gas using the semiconductor<br>
sensors SI - S7 provided in the gas detector 15, the<br>
electrical resistance RO of the sensor output for the<br>
reference gas and the electrical resistance Rl of the<br>
sensor output for a gas in the sample gas that is to be<br>
measured, such as carbon monoxide for example, are measured<br>
and the sensor output proportion R0/R1 for the carbon<br>
monoxide gas is calculated.<br>
The sensor output ratio R0/RCO1 is calculated based on<br>
the electrical resistance RCO1 of the carbon monoxide gas<br>
of a gas concentration of 10 ppm which is detected in<br>
advance at the computer 16, and if the ratio R0/R1 of the<br>
sensor outputs are compared, the gas concentration of the<br>
carbon monoxide in the sample gas can be accurately<br>
calculated.<br>
By measuring the reference gas and the sample gas using<br>
the semiconductor sensors SI - S7 provided in the gas<br>
detector 16, if the ratio R0/R1 for the sensor output for<br><br>
- 26 -<br>
hydrogen, acetylene, ethylene, methane and ethane which are<br>
other gases for detection are calculated and compared, the<br>
gas concentration of specific components in the sample gas<br>
can be correctly calculated.<br>
In order to prevent measurement error due to drifting,<br>
the measurement value for the gas mixture of nitrogen and<br>
oxygen which is the reference gas uses RO which is the<br>
sensor output for the reference gas at time t = tl<br>
immediately before switching to the sample gas and R2 which<br>
is the sensor output for the reference gas at time t = t3<br>
at which the output is stable after switching to the gas<br>
mixture of nitrogen and oxygen which is the reference gas<br>
once again.<br>
If the measurement value for the sample gas uses Rl<br>
which is the sensor output of sample gas at the time t = t2<br>
immediately before switching to the gas mixture of nitrogen<br>
and oxygen, measurement error due to drifting is prevented.<br>
In this case, the ratio R2/R1 rather than the ratio R0/R1<br>
for the sensor output is to be calculated.<br>
In addition, assuming that after the time t = tl,<br>
measurement of the gas mixture of nitrogen and oxygen which<br>
is the reference gas, the sensor output RO' for the gas<br>
mixture of nitrogen and oxygen at time t = t2 is estimated<br>
and the output corresponding to the concentration of the<br>
gas for detection in the sample gas may be calculated as<br><br>
- 27 -<br>
the sensor output RO'/Rl.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a block diagram for calculating the gas<br>
concentration of the various dissolved gases dissolved in<br>
the sample gas detected by the semiconductor sensors S1 -<br>
S7 disposed in the gas detector 15 in the dissolved gas<br>
analyzer of insulating oil in the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention shown in Fig. 1 to Fig. 5 and the sensor<br>
output for the sample gas are input into the computer 16<br>
and the gas concentration of each gas in the sample gas to<br>
be detected are calculated.<br>
As described above, the electrical resistance R which<br>
is the sensor output from the semiconductor sensors S1 - S7<br>
for each gas to be detected at a specific concentration is<br>
obtained in advance to correspond with the reference gas<br>
and each gas to be detected.<br>
In Fig. 6, the concentration of the gas components to<br>
be measured that are included in the sample gas are<br>
calculated by the calculators 201 to 205 that are installed<br>
in the computer 16 based on the output detected by the<br>
plurality of semiconductor sensors SI - S7 which have<br>
different properties for the gas mixture of nitrogen and<br>
oxygen which is the reference gas and the sample gas. The<br>
semiconductor sensor used is preferably which reacts with<br>
few types of gases.<br>
In the step for calculating the gas concentration of<br><br>
- 28 -<br>
each type of gas included in the sample gas to be measured,<br>
first the gas concentration of gas components for which the<br>
concentration can be obtained using the output detected at<br>
a small number of semiconductor sensors from among the<br>
semiconductor sensors S1 - S7.<br>
Next, by substituting the concentration of the gas<br>
components that were obtained first into a calculation<br>
formula that shows the relationship between the reaction<br>
properties and gas concentration, an unknown gas<br>
concentration is calculated using the output detected using<br>
the remaining semiconductor sensors. This calculation is<br>
repeated to obtain the other unknown gas concentrations and<br>
the number of unknown gas concentrations is gradually<br>
decreased until the concentration of all the gas components<br>
are finally obtained.<br>
In this embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
concentrations are calculated in the order of hydrogen,<br>
carbon monoxide, acetylene, ethylene, methane and then<br>
ethane.<br>
Of the semiconductor sensors S1 - S7, by first<br>
obtaining the gas concentration of gas components for which<br>
the concentration can be obtained using a small number of<br>
semiconductor sensors from among the semiconductor sensors<br>
S1 - S7, the amount of calculations for the gas<br>
concentration computations can be reduced and the detection<br><br>
- 29 -<br>
accuracy for the gas to be detected is increased..<br>
In addition, in the block diagram for calculating the<br>
gas concentration of the various dissolved gases shown in<br>
Fig. 6, the calculation values for the gas concentrations<br>
of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, acetylene, ethylene, methane<br>
and ethane for detection that are included in the sample<br>
gas and calculated using the calculators 201 to 205 are<br>
input in the monitoring device 210 and can be monitored at<br>
all times.<br>
In this case, if the permissible values for gas<br>
concentrations to be detected are input from the setting<br>
device 220 to the monitoring device 210, it becomes<br>
possible for a warning to be given at the monitoring device<br>
210 for gas concentrations to be detected which exceed the<br>
permissible values. In addition, the gas concentrations to<br>
be detected and the warning displays from the monitoring<br>
device 210 can be displayed at the display device 230.<br>
Next, in this embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
gas concentration calculation method is described for the<br>
case where there is linearity between the concentrations of<br>
the gas for detection and the detection properties of the<br>
semiconductor sensors.<br>
In Fig. 6, the gas concentration calculations are<br>
described for the case where detection is done for the gas<br>
mixture of nitrogen and oxygen which is the reference gas<br><br>
- 30 -<br>
and for the sample gas. First, in the case where the<br>
hydrogen concentration NH2 is obtained from the sample gas,<br>
the calibration curve (ratio of electrical resistance for<br>
detection concentration and sensor output) for the output<br>
Gl detected by the sensor SI and the concentration NH2 of<br>
the hydrogen which is the gas to be detected, is shown by<br>
the functional equation (equation 1) which is registered at<br>
the calculator 201.<br>
Gl = 1 + A11-(NH2)B11 .................................. (Equation 1)<br>
Here All and Bll are constants obtained by measuring a<br>
gas mixture of hydrogen and air using the sensor S1.<br>
The hydrogen concentration NH2 is obtained by<br>
calculations by substituting output detected by the sensor<br>
S1 for Gl in Equation 1 of calculator 201.<br>
Next, in the case where the concentration of carbon<br>
monoxide NCO is obtained from the sample gas, the<br>

S2, the hydrogen concentration NH2, and the carbon monoxide<br>
concentration NCO is shown by Equation 2 which is the<br>
functional Equation registered in the calculator 202.<br>

Here A21, A22, B21 and B22 are constants obtained by<br>
measuring a gas mixture of hydrogen and air and a gas<br>
mixture of carbon monoxide and air using the sensor S2.<br><br>
- 31 -<br>
The carbon monoxide concentration NCO is obtained by<br>
calculations by substituting output detected by the sensor<br>
S2 for the hydrogen concentration NH2 first obtained in G2<br>
in Equation 2 of calculator 202.<br>
Next, in the case where the acetylene concentration<br>
NC2H2 is obtained from the sample gas, the calibration<br>
curve for the output G3 detected by the sensor S3, the<br>

concentration NC2H2 is shown by Equation 3 which is the<br>
functional equation registered in the calculator 203.<br>

Here A31, A32, B31 and B32 are constants obtained by<br>
measuring a gas mixture of carbon monoxide and air and a<br>
gas mixture of acetylene and air using the sensor S3. The<br>
acetylene concentration NC2H2 is obtained by calculations<br>
by substituting output detected by the sensor S3 for the<br>
carbon monoxide concentration first obtained in G3 in<br>
Equation 3 of calculator 203.<br>
Next, in the case where the ethylene concentration<br>
NC2H4 is obtained from the sample gas, the calibration<br>
curve for the output G4 detected by the sensor S4, the<br>
acetylene concentration NC2H2, and the ethylene<br>
concentration NC2H4 is shown by Equation 4 which is the<br>
functional equation registered in the calculator 204.<br><br>
- 32 -<br>
G4 = 1+NC2H2/(NC2H2+NC2H4)-A41-(NC2H2)B41+NC2H4/<br>
(NC2H2+NC2H4) A42-(NC2H4 )B42................................ (Equation 4)<br>
Here A41, A42, B41 and B42 are constants obtained by<br>
measuring a gas mixture of acetylene and air and a gas<br>
mixture of ethylene and air using the sensor S4.<br>
The ethylene concentration NC2H2 is obtained by<br>
calculations by substituting the output of the sensor S4<br>
for the acetylene concentration first obtained in G4 in<br>
equation 4 of the calculator 204.<br>
Next, in the case where the methane concentration NCH4<br>
and the ethane concentration NC2H6 are obtained from the<br>
sample gas, the calibration curve for the output G5 of the<br>
sensor S5, the hydrogen concentration NH2, the carbon<br>
monoxide concentration NCO, the acetylene concentration<br>
NC2H2, the ethylene concentration NC2H4 and the ethane<br>
concentration NC2H6 is shown by Equation 5 which is the<br>
functional equation recorded in the calculator 205.<br>

monoxide and air, a gas mixture of acetylene and air, a gas<br>
mixture of ethylene and air, a gas mixture of methane and<br>
air, and a gas mixture of ethane and air using the sensor<br>
S5.<br>
In addition, in the case where the methane<br>
concentration NCH4 and the ethane concentration NC2H6 are<br>
obtained from the sample gas, the calibration curve for the<br>
output G6 of the sensor S6, the hydrogen concentration NH2,<br>

of Equation 6 of calculator 205 respectively to give<br>
simultaneous equations. By solving for NCH4 and NC2H6, the<br>
concentrations of methane and ethane can be obtained by<br>
calculation.<br>
The concentrations of hydrogen, carbon monoxide,<br>
methane, ethane, ethylene and acetylene are obtained by<br>
calculations as shown above.<br>
According to the embodiment of the present invention, a<br>
dissolved gas analyzer of insulating oil and a method for<br>

[Embodiment 2 of the invention]<br>
Fig. 7 shows the structure of the dissolved gas<br>
analyzer of insulating oil of second embodiment of the<br>
present invention and this is a portable type of dissolved<br><br>

gas analyzer of insulating oil which is used in a device<br>
that has insulating oil sealed inside. The dissolved gas<br>
analyzer of this embodiment performs dissolved gas analysis<br>
for hydrogen and acetylene.<br>
The dissolved gas analyzer 30 of insulating oil in this<br>
embodiment which is shown in Fig. 7 shares the same basic<br>
structure as the first embodiment shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 3<br>
and Fig. 4, and thus descriptions of the component parts<br>
that are the same will be omitted and only the parts that<br>
are different will be described.<br>
In Fig. 7, the inside of the device (not shown) that is<br>
required for dissolved gas analysis in the portable<br>
dissolved gas analyzer is filled with insulating oil 2. The<br>
dissolved gas analyzer 30 has an insulating oil injector<br>
501, and by installing a gas extractor 3 which is connected<br>
to the insulating oil injector 501 via pipe 25C which has a<br>
valve 503, the gas generated in the insulating oil 2 that<br>
is sampled with the insulating oil injector 501 is<br>
extracted by using the bubbling method in the gas extractor<br>
3.<br>
The insulating oil injector 501 has a cylinder shape<br>
and the insulating oil that is sealed in the device for<br>
analysis of dissolved gas is sampled and only a prescribed<br>
amount of the sampled insulating oil is supplied to the gas<br>
extractor 3. The bottom portion of the gas extractor 3 has<br><br>
- 36 -<br>
an oil discharge port 504 which includes a valve 502 and<br>
the insulating oil 2 from which the dissolved gas for<br>
analysis is extracted is discharged to the outside.<br>
There is an air purifier 31 which removes organic gases<br>
from the air that is taken from the atmosphere and pure air<br>
which is the sample gas and which has been purified and the<br>
humidity has been adjusted is led to the four-way switching<br>
valve 10 via the air supply pipe 18F.<br>
By switching the four-way switching valve 10, a flow<br>
path is formed which supplies pure air to the gas extractor<br>
3 as inert gas from the air purifier 31 via the air supply<br>
pipe 18F and the gas extraction pipe 18C1. It is to be<br>
noted that an air pump which stores purified air may be<br>
used in place of the air purifier 31.<br>
Also, the four-way switching valve 10 is formed so as<br>
to connect the gas extraction pipe 18C2 which leads the gas<br>
mixture of dissolved gas generated in the insulating oil 2<br>
from the gas extractor 3 with the dissolved gas mixture<br>
supply pipe 18D which leads dissolved gas mixture led via<br>
the gas extraction pipe 18C2 to the gas regulator 13.<br>
In addition, by switching the four-way switching valve<br>
10, a flow path is formed in which a gas mixture of<br>
dissolved gases is caused to flow from the gas extractor 3<br>
down to the thermostat 14 described hereinafter via the gas<br>
extraction pipe 18C2 and the dissolved gas mixture supply<br><br>
- 37 -<br>
pipe 18D and regulated at a prescribed temperature and then<br>
supplied to the gas detector 15.<br>
The gas extraction pipe 18C1 has an air pump 11 and by<br>
actuating the air pump 11, bubbling which is the same as<br>
that of the foregoing first embodiment of the present<br>
invention is performed.<br>
In addition, the gas extractor 3 has a filter 12 and<br>
when the gas mixture of dissolved gases generated in the<br>
insulating oil 2 is led from the gas extractor 3 to the<br>
four-way switching valve 10, the gas mixture of dissolved<br>
gases that has become atomized and mixed in the insulating<br>
oil is removed by the filter 12.<br>
The gas detector 15 has semiconductor sensors formed<br>
from metal oxides such as tin oxide, tungsten oxide,<br>
zirconium oxide and the gas mixture of nitrogen and oxygen<br>
which is the sample gas and the gas mixture of nitrogen,<br>
oxygen and the dissolved gases respectively are measured<br>
using the semiconductor sensors, and the measured values<br>
are output to the computer 16 as output signals.<br>
At the computer 116, the concentration of the gas<br>
components of the dissolved gas is calculated by<br>
computations based on the output signals from the<br>
semiconductor sensors disposed in the gas detector 15 and<br>
the calculated concentration of the gas components of the<br>
dissolved gas are displayed on a monitor and the like. The<br><br>
- 38 -<br>
computer 16 sends commands to the elements comprising the<br>
dissolved gas analyzer disposed in the insulating oil<br>
immersed transformer in the embodiment of this invention<br>
which include the ON and OFF for the pumps and the<br>
switching operations and open and close operations for the<br>
switch valve and the exhaust valves.<br>
Next, each of the steps in dissolved gas analysis of<br>
the portable dissolved gas analyzer of insulating oil which<br>
is the second embodiment of this invention shown in Fig. 7<br>
is shown in Fig. 8. In the measuring operation in Fig. 8,<br>
first the measurement preparation step 111 is performed.<br>
Next, step 112 of dissolved gas extraction is performed.<br>
Step 112 of dissolved gas extraction is performed in<br>
parallel with the step 113 of measuring air gas which is<br>
the reference gas. Finally, step 114 of measuring the<br>
sample gas is performed. Step 115 of gas concentration<br>
calculation in which the concentration of each component<br>
gas is measured based on the measurement results from the<br>
step 113 of measuring air gas and the step 104 of measuring<br>
the sample gas is performed. Each of the steps in the<br>
measurement operation is repeated.<br>
To explain more specifically, in the step 111 of<br>
measurement preparation, the four-way switching valve 10 is<br>
operated as shown in Fig. 7 and purified air from the air<br>
purifier 31 is supplied to the four-way switching valve 10<br><br>
- 39 -<br>
via the air supply pipe 18F.<br>
The purified air that is supplied flows from the air<br>
supply pipe 18F into the gas extractor 3 from the gas<br>
extraction pipe 18C1 via the four-way switching valve 10.<br>
Subsequently, purified air passes through the gas extractor<br>
3 and flows down to the gas extraction pipe 18C2 and the<br>
dissolved gas mixture supply pipe 18D, and the inside of<br>
the devices and the flow paths which reach the dissolved<br>
gas mixture supply pipe 18D from the air supply pipe 18F<br>
are displaced with pure air.<br>
Next, in step 112 of dissolved gas extraction, as shown<br>
in Fig. 9, the four-way switching valve 10 is operated and<br>
switching is done. In addition, by switching the four-way<br>
switching valve 10, the flow path A forms a closed system<br>
with the gas extraction pipe 18C1, the gas extraction pipe<br>
18C2, and the gas extractor 3.<br>
Also, by switching the four-way switching valve 10, a<br>
flow path B is formed which supplies purified air from the<br>
air purifier 31 to the thermostat 14 via the air supply<br>
pipe 18F and the four-way switching valve 10. In addition,<br>
the purified air which flows down the flow path B in the<br>
thermostat 14 is adjusted to a set temperature and forms<br>
the purified air which will become the reference gas and<br>
the purified air which becomes the reference gas is<br>
supplied to the gas detector 15.<br><br>
- 40 -<br>
The gas extraction operation is performed in the flow<br>
path A. In the gas extraction in the flow path A, first the<br>
release valve 4 in the gas extractor 3 is put in the<br>
release state and the insulating oil 2 is injected by the<br>
insulating oil injector 201.<br>
Next, when injection of the insulating oil 2 into the<br>
gas extractor 3 is complete, the release valve 4 closes<br>
simultaneously and the air pump 11 in the gas extraction<br>
pipe 18C1 which forms the flow path A is actuated and the<br>
purified air in the flow path A is circulated and the<br>
dissolved gas that is dissolved in the insulating oil 2<br>
that is injected in the extractor 3 by bubbling is<br>
extracted to the purified air and sampled to form the<br>
sample gas.<br>
Next, in the step 113 of measuring the air gas which is<br>
the reference gas, the purified air which is the reference<br>
gas is supplied from the air purifier 31 to the thermostat<br>
14 via the flow path B formed by switching the four-way<br>
switching valve 10 and the temperature is adjusted and<br>
measurement is done at the gas detector 15.<br>
That is to say, purified air is supplied to the<br>
thermostat 14 from the air purifier 31 via the air supply<br>
pipe 18F and the four-way switching valve 10 and purified<br>
air which is the reference gas, and whose set temperature<br>
has been adjusted at the thermostat 14 is formed and<br><br>
- 41 -<br>
supplied to the gas detector 15. When the detected output<br>
becomes stable for the purified air which is the reference<br>
gas detected by the semiconductor sensors SI - S7 in the<br>
gas detector 15, the detected output is input to the<br>
computer 16 as sensor output for the purified air which is<br>
the reference gas.<br>
Next, in the sample gas measurement step 114, as shown<br>
in Fig. 10, the four-way switching valve 10 is switched and<br>
purified air from the air purifier 31 is supplied to the<br>
gas extractor 3 via the air supply pipe 18F, the four-way<br>
switching valve 10 and the gas extraction pipe 18C1 and the<br>
supplied purified air flows down to the thermostat 14 from<br>
the gas extractor 3 via the gas extraction pipe 18C2 and<br>
the dissolved gas mixture supply pipe 18D.<br>
According to this operation, the gas mixture of<br>
dissolved gases which was sampled from the flow path A is<br>
pushed out by the purified air supplied from the purifier<br>
31 and led to the thermostat 14 via the four-way switching<br>
valve 10.<br>
The gas mixture of the dissolved gases that is led to<br>
the thermostat 14 forms the sample gas whose set<br>
temperature is adjusted at the thermostat 14. In addition,<br>
the generated sample gas is supplied to the gas detector 15<br>
and the concentration of the sample gas is detected.<br>
By switching from the gas that is supplied to the<br><br>
- 42 -<br>
semiconductor sensor S1, S3 and S4 in the gas detector 15<br>
from air which is the reference gas to the sample gas, the<br>
sensor output of the sample gas detected by the<br>
semiconductor sensors S1, S3 and S4 changes significantly<br>
around the time the supplied gas is switched.<br>
When the sensor output is substantially stable after<br>
the changes in sensor output, the output of these sensors<br>
is input to the computer 16 as the sensor outputs for the<br>
semiconductor sensors S1, S3 and S4 for the sample gas.<br>
The sensor output for the reference gas and sample gas<br>
detected by the semiconductor sensor S1, S3 and S4 provided<br>
in the gas detector 15 is not shown in the drawing, but it<br>
is the same as that in Fig. 5.<br>
In addition, if the electrical resistance RO of the<br>
sensor output for the reference gas and the electrical<br>
resistance Rl of the sensor output for the gas for<br>
measurement in the sample gas and if the proportion R0/R1<br>
of both sensor outputs at computer 16 are compared, the gas<br>
concentration of the gases to be measured in the sample gas<br>
can be accurately calculated.<br>
Fig. 11 shows a block diagram for calculating the gas<br>
concentration of the various dissolved gases dissolved in<br>
the sample gas detected by the semiconductor sensors S1, S3<br>
and S4 disposed in the gas detector 15 in the dissolved gas<br>
analyzer of insulating oil in the second embodiment of the<br><br>
- 43 -<br>
present invention shown in Fig. 7 to Fig. 10 and the sensor<br>
output for the sample gas are input into the computer 16<br>
and the gas concentration of each gas in the sample gas to<br>
be detected are calculated.<br>
As is the case in the first embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the electrical resistance R which is the sensor<br>
output from the semiconductor sensors S1, S3 and S4 for the<br>
reference gas and each gas to be detected at a specific<br>
concentration is obtained in advance to correspond with the<br>
reference gas and each of the gases to be detected.<br>
In Fig. 11, the concentration of the gas components to<br>
be measured that are included in the sample gas are<br>
calculated by the calculator 301, calculator 303 and<br>
calculator 304 that are installed in the computer 16 based<br>
on the output detected by the plurality of semiconductor<br>
sensors SI, S3 and S4 which have different properties for<br>
the purified air which is the reference gas and the sample<br>
gas. The semiconductor sensor used is preferably which<br>
reacts with few types of gases.<br>
In the step for calculating the gas concentration of<br>
each type of gas included in the sample gas to be measured,<br>
first the gas concentration of gas components for which the<br>
concentration can be obtained using the output detected<br>
with a small number of semiconductor sensors from among the<br>
semiconductor sensors S1, S3 and S4.<br><br>
- 44 -<br>
Next, by substituting the concentration of the gas<br>
components that were obtained first into a calculation<br>
formula that shows the relationship between the reaction<br>
properties and gas concentration, an unknown gas<br>
concentration is calculated from the output detected using<br>
the remaining semiconductor sensors. This calculation is<br>
repeated to obtain the other unknown gas concentrations and<br>
the number of unknown gas concentrations is gradually<br>
decreased until the concentration of all the gas components<br>
are finally obtained. In this embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the concentration are calculated in the order of<br>
hydrogen, acetylene, and ethylene are calculated in that<br>
order.<br>
Of the semiconductor sensors S1, S3 and S4, by first<br>
obtaining the gas concentration of gas components for which<br>
the concentration can be obtained using a small number of<br>
semiconductor sensors from among the semiconductor sensors<br>
S1, S3 and S4, the amount of calculations for the gas<br>
concentration computations can be reduced and the detection<br>
accuracy for the gas to be detected is increased.<br>
In addition, in the block diagram for calculating the<br>
gas concentration of the various dissolved gases shown in<br>
Fig. 11, the calculation values for the gas concentrations<br>
of hydrogen, acetylene and ethylene, that are included in<br>
the sample gas and calculated using the calculator 301,<br><br>
- 45 -<br>
calculator 303 and calculator 304 are input in the<br>
monitoring device 310 and can be monitored at all times.<br>
In this case, if the permissible values for gas<br>
concentrations to be detected are input from the setting<br>
device 320 to the monitoring device 310, it becomes<br>
possible for a warning to be given at the monitoring device<br>
310 for gas concentrations to be detected which exceed the<br>
permissible values. In addition, the gas concentrations to<br>
be detected and the warning displays from the monitoring<br>
device 310 can be displayed at the display device 330.<br>
Next, in this embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
gas concentration calculation method is described for the<br>
case where there is linearity between the concentrations of<br>
the gas for detection and the detection properties of the<br>
semiconductor sensors.<br>
In Fig. 11, the gas concentration calculations are<br>
described for the case where detection is done for purified<br>
air which is the reference gas and for the sample gas.<br>
First, in the case where the hydrogen concentration NH2 is<br>
obtained from the sample gas, the calibration curve (ratio<br>
of electrical resistance for detection concentration and<br>
sensor output) for the output Gl detected by the sensor SI<br>
and the concentration NH2 of the hydrogen which is the gas<br>
to be detected, is shown by the functional equation<br>
(Equation 7) which is registered at the calculator 301.<br><br>
- 46 -<br>
G1=1+A11-(NH2)B11 ........................................ (Equation 7)<br>
Here All and Bll are constants obtained by measuring a<br>
gas mixture of hydrogen and air using the sensor SI.<br>
The hydrogen concentration NH2 is obtained by<br>
substituting output detected by the sensor SI for Gl in<br>
Equation 7 of calculator 301.<br>
Next, in the case where the acetylene concentration<br>
NC2H2 is obtained from the sample gas, the calibration<br>
curve for the output G3 detected by the sensor S3, the<br>
acetylene concentration NC2H2, and the ethylene<br>
concentration NC2H4 is shown by Equation 8 which is the<br>
functional equation registered in the calculator 303.<br>
G3=1+NC2H2/ (NC2H2+NC2H4 )-A31-(NC2H2 )B31+NC2H4/ (NC2H2+NC2H<br>
4)A32-(NC2H4)B32................................(Equation 8)<br>
Here A31, A32, B31 and B32 are constants obtained by<br>
measuring a gas mixture of acetylene and air and a gas<br>
mixture of ethylene and air using the sensor S3.<br>
Also, the calibration curve for the output G4 of the<br>
sensor S4, the acetylene concentration NC2H2, the ethylene<br>
concentration NC2H4 is shown by Equation 9 which is the<br>
functional equation registered in the calculator 304.<br>
G4 = 1+NC2H2/ (NC2H2+NC2H4) -A41-(NC2H2 )B41+NC2H4/ (NC2H2+NC2H<br>
4)A42-(NC2H4)B42................................................ (Equation 9)<br>
Here A41, A42, B41 and B42 are constants obtained by<br>
measuring a gas mixture of acetylene and air and a gas<br><br>
- 47 -<br>
mixture of ethylene and air using the sensor S4.<br>
The output from each of sensor S3 and sensor S4 is<br>
substituted for G3 in Equation 8 which is the functional<br>
equation for the calculator 303 and for G4 in Equation 9<br>
which is the functional equation for the calculator 304. By<br>
solving for NCH4 and NC2H6, the concentration of the<br>
ethylene and acetylene are obtained by calculation. The<br>
concentration of hydrogen and acetylene respectively can be<br>
obtained by calculations as shown above.<br>
[Embodiment 3 of the invention]<br>
The third embodiment of the present invention is a<br>
dissolved gas monitoring system which monitors analysis of<br>
the dissolved gas sealed in an insulating oil-immersed<br>
transformer by monitoring multiple oil immersed<br>
transformers all at once.<br>
Fig. 12 shows the dissolved gas monitoring system in<br>
this embodiment of the present invention where a plurality<br>
of insulating oil immersed transformers is monitored at<br>
once. The dissolved gas analyzer of insulating oil with<br>
communication means 401, 402 and 403 and the central<br>
monitoring device 420 can communicate via the telephone<br>
circuit 430, the cellular phone circuit 450 and/or the<br>
wireless 440.<br>
The dissolved gas analyzers of insulating oil with<br>
communication means 401, 402 and 403 each comprises an<br><br>
- 48 -<br>
insulating oil immersed transformer 1; dissolved gas<br>
analyzers of insulating oil 20 and 30 for sampling each<br>
kind of gas included in the insulating oil 2 sealed in the<br>
oil immersed transformer 1 and monitoring devices 210 and<br>
310 for monitoring each type of gas detected at the<br>
dissolved gas analyzer of insulating oil 20 and 30.<br>
In addition, the dissolved gas analyzers of insulating<br>
oil with communication means 401, 402 and 403 are connected<br>
by a LAN to a HUB and the concentration of each of the<br>
gases sampled and analyzed at the dissolved gas analyzers<br>
of insulating oil 20 and 30 as well as the monitoring<br>
results data are transmitted to the central monitoring<br>
device 420.<br>
It is not usually necessary to send and receive the<br>
transmitted data since the data should be sent and received<br>
periodically. In the case where the reproducibillty of the<br>
data that is sent is to be checked, or the case where<br>
diagnostic results by monitoring is received and monitoring<br>
is to be strengthened, the central monitoring device 420<br>
instructs dissolved gas analysis by re-measuring or<br>
reducing the measuring interval.<br>
In addition, if there is any abnormality in the<br>
diagnostic results, a more precise gas analysis may be<br>
performed or the insulating oil immersed transformer may be<br>
stopped. In addition, operation of the dissolved gas<br><br>
- 49 -<br>
analyzers of insulating oil with communication means 401,<br>
402 and 403 or residual air amount in the air pump can be<br>
checked at the central monitoring device 420.<br>
This dissolved gas monitoring system is effective for a<br>
remotely set insulating oil immersed transformer or for<br>
monitoring insulating oil immersed transformers that are<br>
scattered over an area all at once. In addition, this<br>
system may be one in which the dissolved gas analyzers of<br>
insulating oil with communication means 401, 402 and 403<br>
and the central monitoring device 420 are directly<br>
connected using LAN or a system in which each of the<br>
dissolved gas analyzers of insulating oil with<br>
communication means 401, 402 and 403 communicate directly<br>
with the central monitoring device 420 via a telephone<br>
circuit or cellular telephone circuit.<br>
In addition, the detection outputs of the<br>
semiconductors which detect gas concentration for each type<br>
of gas are received at the central monitoring device 420<br>
and the gas concentration of each type of gas is calculated<br>
at the central monitoring device 420.<br>
According to this embodiment of the present invention,<br>
a dissolved gas analyzer of insulating oil and a method for<br>
analyzing dissolved gas analyzer of insulating oil enable<br>
to detect the concentration of various gases with high<br>
detection repeatability using a general-use semiconductor<br><br>
- 50 -<br>
is realized.<br>
[Embodiment 4 of the invention]<br>
The dissolved gas analyzer of insulating oil based on<br>
the membrane permeation method as the fourth embodiment of<br>
the present invention is provided with the insulating oil<br>
immersed transformer.<br>
In this embodiment, the dissolved gas analyzer with the<br>
membrane permeation method is applied to the insulating oil<br>
immersed transformer in stead of the gas extractor 3 of the<br>
dissolved gas analyzer which is shown in the first<br>
embodiment of invention. The connection method of this<br>
embodiment is as followings. That is, the gas extraction<br>
pipe 18C1 is connected to the carrier gas supply port<br>
described hereinafter and the gas extraction pipe 18C2 is<br>
connected to the carrier gas discharge port described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
The dissolved gas analyzer of insulating oil with the<br>
membrane permeation method of the fourth embodiment is<br>
explained referring the drawings as followings.<br>
In the dissolved gas analyzer of insulating oil with<br>
the membrane permeation method in this embodiment, time t<br>
until the concentration of decomposition gases in a gas<br>
reservoir in the dissolved gas analyzer reaches an<br>
equilibrium can be represented as in equation 10 below in<br>
which V, d and A are taken as the volume of the gas<br><br>
- 51 -<br>
reservoir, the thickness of the permeable membrane, and the<br>
area of the permeable membrane, respectively. P is a<br>
transmission coefficient and C is a constant.<br><br>
According to equation 10, when the thickness d of the<br>
gas permeable membrane and the volume V of the gas<br>
reservoir are made small and the area A of the gas<br>
permeable membrane is made large, the time t until an<br>
equilibrium is reached can be shortened.<br>
To shorten the time t until the equilibrium is reached,<br>
the thickness d of the permeable membrane is preferably<br>
made small. However, the gas permeable membrane is often<br>
attached to the oil discharge port of the oil immersed<br>
transformer, and the insulating oil applies a pressure<br>
about 0.2 MPa to the position at which the gas permeable<br>
membrane is attached. If the gas permeable membrane is too<br>
thin, it is broken.<br>
Suppose that a gas permeable membrane with a thickness<br>
of dl is used for a discoidal hollow gas reservoir in a<br>
groove shape with an outer radius of R1 + r and an inner<br>
radius of R1 - r. A pressure p applied to the gas permeable<br>
membrane and a shear stress tl applied to the circumference<br>
of the gas permeable membrane can be represented as in<br>
equation 11 below.<br><br>
- 52 -<br><br>
When the pressure p applied to the gas permeable<br>
membrane is 0.2 MPa and an allowable shear stress is x, the<br>
relation between the width 2r of the groove and the<br>
thickness d of the gas permeable membrane is determined by<br>
equation 12 below.<br>
r
Accordingly, it is preferable in tis embodiment of the<br>
invention that the thickness of the gas permeable membrane<br>
is thinned by determining the width of the groove-shaped<br>
gas reservoir so that the relation among the allowable<br>
maximum shear stress x (MPa) of the material of the gas<br>
permeable membrane, the width 2r of the groove, and the<br>
thickness d of the gas permeable membrane satisfies<br>
equation 12.<br>
To increase precision in gas measurement, it is<br>
preferable that the sample gas, which is held in the gas<br>
reservoir and used for analysis, can be supplied to a gas<br>
detector without being diluted by nitrogen gas or a carrier<br>
gas as inert gas. Accordingly, this embodiment of the<br>
invention proposes that the cross sectional area of the<br>
groove of the gas reservoir is equal to or smaller than the<br><br>
- 53 -<br>
cross sectional area of the carrier gas inlet port, thereby<br>
preventing the gas in the gas reservoir from being diluted<br>
by the carrier gas.<br>
When the volume of the groove, which is the gas<br>
reservoir, is equal to the amount of sample gas needed for<br>
the gas measurement by the gas detector, it is possible to<br>
measure a fixed amount of gas in the gas reservoir,<br>
enabling a predetermined amount of sample gas to be always<br>
supplied without having to provide a fixed-volume<br>
measurement pipe. In this case, the carrier gas supply port<br>
and carrier gas discharge port are preferably disposed at<br>
ends of the groove-shaped gas reservoir to supply the<br>
predetermined amount of sample gas.<br>
The dissolved gas analyzer in this embodiment of the<br>
invention preferably has an oil flow means for having oil<br>
flow by agitating or vibrating the insulating oil. When the<br>
decomposition gases included in the insulating oil are<br>
transmitted to the gas reservoir, the concentration of the<br>
decomposition gases included in the insulating oil becomes<br>
locally low near the gas permeable membrane, lowering the<br>
efficiency of the gas permeation. When the insulating oil<br>
is agitated or vibrated so that it flows, the concentration<br>
of the decomposition gases in the insulating oil can be<br>
made uniform, increasing the efficiency of the gas<br>
permeation. The time t until an equilibrium is reached can<br><br>
- 54 -<br>
be thus shortened.<br>
A high-molecular organic compound membrane or high-<br>
molecular organic compound porous membrane can be used as<br>
the material of the gas permeable membrane. A porous plate,<br>
perforated plate, or wire mesh can be integrated with the<br>
high-molecular organic compound membrane or high-molecular<br>
organic compound porous membrane as a reinforcing member.<br>
In this embodiment of the invention, a dissolved gas<br>
analyzer for an oil immersed transformer will be described.<br>
FIG. 13 shows the structure of a gas extracting unit 3 in<br>
the dissolved gas analyzer of insulating oil. The gas<br>
extracting unit 3 comprises a grooved flange 1101, a gas<br>
permeable membrane 1102, a groove-shaped gas reservoir 1103,<br>
a carrier gas supply port 1104, a carrier gas discharge<br>
port 1105, a valve 1106a, and another valve 1106b.<br>
An oil discharge port 1201 and an oil discharge valve<br>
1202 are both disposed on the oil immersed transformer side.<br>
Although the oil discharge port 1201 and oil discharge<br>
valve 1202 are originally used as a port for discharging<br>
unnecessary insulating oil, they are used to attach the gas<br>
extracting unit 3 in this embodiment. When a gas is<br>
extracted, the oil discharge valve 1202 is left open and<br>
the gas permeable membrane 1102 is in close contact with an<br>
insulating oil 1203.<br>
When the grooved flange 1101 is fastened to the oil<br><br>
- 55 -<br>
discharge port 1201, the gas extracting unit 3 is attached<br>
to an oil immersed transformer 1 and the gas permeable<br>
membrane 1102 is fixed by being supported from the<br>
circumference thereof.<br>
The gas permeable membrane 1102 seals the insulating<br>
oil 1203 into the insulating oil immersed transformer or an<br>
external container of the insulating oil immersed<br>
transformer, and allows decomposition gases to transmit to<br>
the groove-shaped gas reservoir 1103. The material of the<br>
gas permeable membrane 1102 is a copolymer of<br>
tetrafluoroethylene and perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether, with a<br>
thickness of 0.1 mm. Preferable materials of the gas<br>
permeable membrane 1102 include tetrafluoro copolymer<br>
membranes, high-molecular organic compound membranes made<br>
of polyethylene and fluorine rubber, high-molecular organic<br>
compound porous membranes, porous plates coated with high-<br>
molecular organic compounds, and high-molecular organic<br>
compound membranes reinforced by perforated plates or wire<br>
meshes.<br>
The groove-shaped gas reservoir 1103 is a grooved-<br>
shaped recession formed in the grooved flange 1101. The<br>
groove-shaped gas reservoir 1103 is a space defined by the<br>
gas permeable membrane 1102 and is used to extract and<br>
store a sample gas. When the sample gas is supplied, the<br>
groove-shaped gas reservoir 1103 serves as a path through<br><br>
- 56 -<br>
which the carrier gas flows.<br>
The carrier gas supply port 1104 communicates with an<br>
end of the groove-shaped gas reservoir 1103 and serves as<br>
an inlet port through which the carrier gas enters in the<br>
groove-shaped gas reservoir 1103.<br>
The area of the cross section of the groove-shaped gas<br>
reservoir 1103 perpendicular to the streamline of the<br>
carrier gas is smaller than the area of the cross section<br>
of the carrier gas supply port 1104 perpendicular to the<br>
streamline of the carrier gas.<br>
The carrier gas discharge port 1105 communicates with<br>
the other end of the groove-shaped gas reservoir 1103 and<br>
serves as an outlet port through which the extracted and<br>
stored sample gas and the carrier gas supplied through the<br>
carrier gas supply port 1104 are discharged.<br>
The valve 1106a and valve 1106b are closed when the<br>
sample gas is extracted and stored; they are opened when<br>
the sample gas in the gas reservoir is replaced with the<br>
carrier gas.<br>
A packing 1107 is inserted into a joint between the<br>
grooved flange 1101 and the gas permeable membrane 1102 and<br>
another packing 1107 is inserted into a joint between the<br>
oil discharge port 1201 and the gas permeable membrane 1102.<br>
The packings 1107 contribute to the sealing of the<br>
insulating oil into the insulating oil immersed transformer<br><br>
- 57 -<br>
or its external vessel.<br>
FIG. 14 shows the structure of the grooved flange of<br>
the dissolved gas analyzer of insulating oil. The groove-<br>
shaped gas reservoir 1103 in the drawing is linearly<br>
structured. The area of the cross section of the groove-<br>
shaped gas reservoir 1103 perpendicular to the streamline<br>
of the carrier gas is preferably equal to or smaller than<br>
the area of the cross section of the carrier gas supply<br>
port so that the carrier gas is supplied without turbulence<br>
or the sample gas is not mixed with the carrier gas.<br>
FIG. 16 shows a procedure for analyzing gases dissolved<br>
in the insulating oil. Steps for dissolved gas analysis<br>
include preparation for extracting a sample gas, the<br>
extraction and storage of the sample gas, preparation for<br>
measurement, supply of the sample gas, and sample gas<br>
measurement.<br>
In the step of preparing for extracting a sample gas, a<br>
carrier gas is substituted in the groove-shaped gas<br>
reservoir 1103. Specifically, the carrier gas is supplied<br>
from the carrier gas supply unit with the valve 1106a and<br>
valve 1106b open.<br>
The sample gas is then extracted and stored. When the<br>
carrier gas has been substituted in the groove-shaped gas<br>
reservoir 1103, the valve 1106a and valve 1106b are closed.<br>
Discomposed gases dissolved in the insulating oil transmit<br><br>
- 58 -<br>
through the gas permeable membrane 1102 and diffuse in the<br>
groove-shaped gas reservoir 1103. It is awaited until an<br>
equilibrium between the concentration of the gas in the<br>
groove-shaped gas reservoir 1103 and the concentration of<br>
the decomposition gases in the insulating oil is reached.<br>
A time for the gas concentration to reach the<br>
equilibrium is obtained in advance by performing<br>
measurement test. When the constant C in equation 10 is<br>
known, the time to reach the equilibrium may be estimated<br>
from equation 10.<br>
Preparation for measurement is then made.<br>
A carrier gas is supplied from the carrier gas supply<br>
unit to the gas detector unit.<br>
The next step is to supply a sample gas. The valve<br>
1106a and valve 1106b are opened and a carrier gas is then<br>
supplied from the carrier gas supply unit through the gas<br>
extracting unit to the gas detector unit.<br>
The carrier gas is substituted in the groove-shaped gas<br>
reservoir 1103, supplying the sample gas that has been in<br>
the groove-shaped gas reservoir 1103 to the gas detector<br>
unit, where the types and concentrations of gases are<br>
measured.<br>
[Embodiment 5 of the invention]<br>
In this embodiment of the present invention, a case in<br>
which the sample gas is extracted, stored, measured, and<br><br>
- 59 -<br>
supplied in the groove-shaped gas reservoir 103 will be<br>
described with reference to FIGs. 14 to 16. Since a fixed<br>
volume of sample gas is measured in the groove-shaped gas<br>
reservoir 1103, a fixed-volume measurement pipe does not<br>
need to be prepared separately, saving the volume of the<br>
fixed-volume measurement pipe itself and the pipe to the<br>
fixed-volume measurement pipe. Accordingly, in equation 10,<br>
the volume V of the gas reservoir can be made small and the<br>
time t to reach the equilibrium can be shortened.<br>
The carrier gas supply port 1104 in FIG. 14 is<br>
cylindrical, the radius being r. The groove-shaped gas<br>
reservoir 1103 is a rectangular parallelepiped with a<br>
length of L, a width of 2r, and a groove depth of h. Both<br>
end of the groove-shaped gas reservoir 1103 are semi-<br>
cylindrical column with a radius of r and a depth of h. The<br>
volume of the groove-shaped gas reservoir 1103 is thereby<br>
2rLh + πr2h.<br>
The volume of the groove-shaped gas reservoir 1103 is<br>
equal to the volume of the supplied sample gas. Accordingly,<br>
the volume of the groove-shaped gas reservoir 1103 was made<br>
equal to the volume of a sample gas required for<br>
measurement.<br>
The area 2rh of the cross section of the groove-shaped<br>
gas reservoir 1103 perpendicular to the streamline of the<br>
carrier gas is 10 mm2, which is smaller than the cross<br><br>
- 60 -<br>
sectional area jtr2 of the carrier gas supply port 1104 which<br>
measures 19.6 mm2.<br>
According to the dissolved gas analysis procedure, a<br>
carrier gas was first substituted in the groove-shaped gas<br>
reservoir 1103, as preparation for gas extraction.<br>
Specifically, the carrier gas was supplied from the carrier<br>
gas supply unit with the valve 1106a and valve 1106b open.<br>
The sample gas was then extracted and stored. After the<br>
carrier gas has been substituted in the groove-shaped gas<br>
reservoir 1103, the valve 1106a and valve 1106b are closed<br>
and left in that state. Discomposed gases dissolved in the<br>
insulating oil transmit through the gas permeable membrane<br>
1102 and diffuse in the groove-shaped gas reservoir 1103.<br>
It was awaited until the concentration of the gas in the<br>
groove-shaped gas reservoir 1103 reached an equilibrium.<br>
A time for the gas concentration to reach the<br>
equilibrium was obtained in advance by performing<br>
measurement test, which was preset to 70 hours.<br>
When a fixed-volume measurement pipe was provided<br>
separately, not according to the present embodiment of the<br>
invention, the time for the gas concentration to reach the<br>
equilibrium was 138 hours.<br>
Accordingly, the time taken for gas extraction could be<br>
halved.<br>
After the gas concentration reached the equilibrium.<br><br>
- 61 -<br>
preparation for measurement was then made.<br>
A carrier gas was supplied from the carrier gas supply<br>
unit to the gas detector unit.<br>
The next step was to supply a sample gas. The 1106a and<br>
valve 1106b were opened and a carrier gas was supplied from<br>
the carrier gas supply unit through the gas extracting unit<br>
to the gas detector unit.<br>
The carrier gas was substituted in the groove-shaped<br>
gas reservoir 1103, supplying the sample gas that had been<br>
in the groove-shaped gas reservoir 1103 to the gas detector<br>
unit.<br>
[Embodiment 6 of the invention]<br>
In the Fifth embodiment of the present invention, a<br>
case in which the width of the groove-shaped gas reservoir<br>
1103 is adjusted so as to reduce the thickness of the gas<br>
permeable membrane will be described. FIG. 15 shows the<br>
structure of a grooved flange having an arc-shaped gas<br>
reservoir. This embodiment of the present invention is<br>
compared with the conventional structure based on the<br>
conventional method; in the embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the groove-shaped gas reservoir 1103 is a<br>
cylindrical reservoir with an external radius of R1 + r, an<br>
internal radius of R1 - r, and a height of h, and the width<br>
of the gas permeable membrane 1102 is dl; in the<br>
conventional structure, the gas reservoir is a columnar<br><br>
- 62 -<br>
reservoir with a radius of R2 and a height of h, and the<br>
width of the gas permeable membrane 1102 is d2.<br>
In this embodiment of the present invention, it is<br>
assumed that a shear stress is uniformly applied to the<br>
circumference of the gas permeable membrane 1102. The shear<br>
stress t1 applied to the circumference of the gas permeable<br>
membrane 1102 is obtained from equation 11, as described<br>
above.<br>
Let t be an allowed shear stress. The thickness dl of<br>
the gas permeable membrane 1102 is then determined by<br>
equation 14.<br><br>
By comparison, in the conventional structure, the shear<br>
stress %2 applied to the circumference of the gas permeable<br>
membrane 1102 is determined by equation 15.<br><br>
Let t be an allowed shear stress. The thickness d2 of<br>
the gas permeable membrane 1102 is then determined by<br>
equation 16.<br><br>
A ratio dl/d2 between the membrane thicknesses is<br><br>
- 63 -<br>
represented as in equation 17; the ratio is determined by r<br>
and R2, independently of R1.<br><br>
Since V = A x h, equation 10 can be rewritten as<br>
equation 18.<br><br>
In the present embodiment of the invention, time tl to<br>
reach the equilibrium is represented as in equation 19.<br><br>
In the conventional structure, time t2 to reach the<br>
equilibrium is represented as in equation 20.<br><br>
A ratio tl/t2 between the times to reach the<br>
equilibrium is represented as in equation 21 from equations<br>
17, 19, and 20; the ratio is determined by r and R2.<br><br>
When the area of the gas permeable membrane 1102 in the<br>
present embodiment of the invention is equal to the area of<br><br>
- 64 -<br>
the gas permeable membrane 1102 in the conventional<br>
structure, for example, R1, r, and R2 are respectively 50 mm,<br>
2 mm, and 20 mm, the time tl to reach the equilibrium in<br>
the present embodiment of the invention can be reduced to<br>
one-fifth the time t2 to reach the equilibrium in the<br>
conventional structure.<br>
FIG. 16 shows the structure of a grooved flange having<br>
a gas reservoir in a zigzag shape as one of other<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
FIG. 17 shows the structure of a grooved flange having<br>
a gas reservoir in a spiral shape as one of other<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
The flange having a gas reservoir in a zigzag or spiral<br>
shape may be used instead of the grooved flange having an<br>
arc-shaped gas reservoir shown in FIG. 15.<br>
Since the gas reservoir is formed in a groove shape in<br>
the dissolved gas analyzer of insulating oil based on the<br>
membrane permeation method in this embodiment of the<br>
invention, the volume of the gas reservoir can be lessened<br>
and the thickness of the gas permeable membrane can be<br>
reduced. Accordingly, time until the concentration of the<br>
decomposition gases in the gas reservoir reaches an<br>
equilibrium state can be shortened and thus time taken to<br>
extract the decomposition gases in the gas reservoir can be<br>
shortened. According to the present embodiment of the<br><br>
- 65 -<br>
invention, a time interval can be shortened for the<br>
dissolved gas analyzer, enabling the transformer to undergo<br>
a real-time check for abnormality.<br>
This invention can be used in a dissolved gas analyzer<br>
of insulating oil for equipment such as an oil-filled<br>
transformer and a method for analyzing dissolved gas of<br>
insulating oil in equipment such as an oil-filled<br>
transformer<br><br>
