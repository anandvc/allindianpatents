TIRE VULCANIZING APPARATUS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a tire vulcanizing apparatus<br>
capable of continuously and efficiently conducting carrying-in of green<br>
tires, vulcanization and pressure cooling, thereby enhancing the quality<br>
and uniformity of vulcanized tires.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As an apparatus for continuously vulcanizing and forming green<br>
tires in a tire vulcanization step is known one disclosed in Patent<br>
Literature 1: JP-A-2004-122407.<br>
This apparatus is provided with a vulcanization mold composed<br>
of an upper mold and a lower mold, and a traveling carriage for<br>
reciprocating the lower mold between a position of carrying-in a green<br>
tire and a position of vulcanizing the tire. A carrying-out device for<br>
carrying out a vulcanized tire is connected to the lower mold. When<br>
mounting a green tire on the lower mold at the green tire carrying-in<br>
position, a vulcanized tire is made to fall on the carrying-out device<br>
from the upper mold located at the tire vulcanizing position and is<br>
carried out.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
Problem to be Solved by the Invention<br>
In recent years, however, it is desired to conduct, in the tire<br>
vulcanization step, a pressure cooling (so-called post-cure inflation)<br>
wherein a high temperature tire taken out from the vulcanization mold<br>
just after the vulcanization is charged with an inner pressure to expand<br>
the tire and is spontaneously cooled with stabilizing its shape by the<br>
expansion of the tire, thereby enhancing the uniformity of tire.<br>
Therefore, it is required that the vulcanized tire taken out of the<br>
vulcanization mold is conveyed to a pressure cooling device and<br>
mounted again. However, when the vulcanized tire which has been<br>
once detached from the vulcanization mold is mounted on the pressure<br>
cooling device, misalignment of the centers of the vulcanized tire and<br>
the pressure cooling device is easy to occur, so sufficient enhancement<br>
of the tire uniformity is not achieved. There also arises a problem that<br>
installation space increases since a device for conveying the tire to the<br>
pressure cooling device is needed.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
tire vulcanizing apparatus which is capable of continuously and<br>
efficiently performing the carrying-in of green tires, the vulcanization<br>
and the pressure cooling, while suppressing the off-center arrangement<br>
of the tires to thereby achieve formation of vulcanized tires with high<br>
accuracy and high efficiency, and which is also capable of achieving<br>
reduction of the installation space.<br>
Means to Solve the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a tire vulcanizing apparatus<br><br>
wherein a green tire carried-in is vulcanized using a vulcanization mold<br>
composed of upper and lower molds and the vulcanized tire is taken out<br>
after pressure cooling, and which is characterized in that:<br>
the apparatus has a carrying-in position into which a green tire<br>
is conveyed from an original position, a vulcanizing position at which<br>
the green tire is vulcanized, and a pressure cooling position at which<br>
the vulcanized tire is pressure-cooled, and<br>
the apparatus includes a frame having rails;<br>
a traveling carriage capable of reciprocating on the rails from the<br>
carrying-in position side toward the pressure cooling position side;<br>
a vulcanization mold having an upper mold capable of moving<br>
up and down at the vulcanizing position, and a lower mold which is<br>
mounted on the traveling carriage and moves between the vulcanizing<br>
position and the carrying-in position;<br>
a pressure cooling device disposed at the pressure cooling<br>
position and performing pressure cooling of the vulcanized tire with<br>
holding it;<br>
a tire receiving and mounting device which is attached to the<br>
traveling carriage, and which receives at the vulcanizing position the<br>
vulcanized tire held by the upper mold, conveys it to the pressure<br>
cooling position and mounts it on the pressure cooling device; and<br>
a green tire transfer device having a grip assembly capable of<br>
gripping a green tire which has been conveyed to the original position<br>
and capable of moving up and down, the transfer device transferring the<br>
green tire to the lower mold by movement of the grip assembly to the<br><br>
carrying-in position followed by downward movement of the grip<br>
assembly,<br>
wherein the traveling carriage, the vulcanization mold, the<br>
pressure cooling device, the tire receiving and mounting device and the<br>
green tire transfer device are mounted on the frame.<br>
Effects of the Invention<br>
Since the present invention is constituted as mentioned above, it<br>
is possible to continuously conduct the carrying-in and vulcanization of<br>
green tires and the pressure cooling with suppressing possible<br>
off-center arrangement of the green tires and, therefore, vulcanized tires<br>
can be formed with high accuracy and high efficiency. The present<br>
invention also can make great contribution to reduction of installation<br>
space.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will be explained with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, tire vulcanizing apparatus 1 in this<br>
embodiment is an apparatus for vulcanizing a carried-in green tire TA<br>
by using a vulcanization mold 4 composed of an upper mold 2 and a<br>
lower mold 3, followed by pressure cooling of the vulcanized tire TB.<br>
The tire vulcanizing apparatus 1 is provided with a carrying-in position<br>
P1 into which the green tire TA is carried in from an original position PO,<br>
a vulcanizing position P2 at which the green tire TA is vulcanized, and a<br>
pressure cooling position P3 at which the vulcanized tire TB is<br>
pressure-cooled. The carrying-in position PI, the vulcanizing position<br>
P2 and the pressure cooling position P3 are arranged on a line at even<br>
intervals.<br><br>
The tire vulcanizing apparatus 1 is equipped with a traveling<br>
carriage 6, the vulcanization mold 4 mentioned above, a pressure<br>
cooling device 7, a tire receiving and mounting device 8 and a green tire<br>
transfer device 9, and they are attached to a frame 5.<br>
The frame 5 is composed of a table-like base portion 5A provided<br>
with rails 10 extending backward and forward, and an upper frame<br>
portion 5B rising up from the base portion 5A. The traveling carriage 6<br>
straddles the rails 10, 10, and can make a reciprocating movement on<br>
the rails 10 from the carrying-in position P1 side on the rear side of the<br>
apparatus toward the pressure cooling position P3 side on the front side<br>
of the apparatus. In this embodiment, the traveling carriage 6 is<br>
connected to a ball screw mechanism 11 having screw shafts 11A<br>
parallel to the rails, and can move back and forth by motor drive<br>
applied to the screw shafts 11A.<br>
The vulcanization mold 4 is a mold of so-called split mold type,<br>
and it has an upper mold 2 which is supported by the upper frame<br>
portion 5B and can move up and down at the vulcanizing position P2,<br>
and a lower mold 3 which is disposed on the traveling carriage 6 and<br>
can move back and forth between the vulcanizing position P2 and the<br>
carrying-in position P1.<br>
As briefly shown in Fig. 3, the upper mold 2 has a known<br>
structure including an upper mold body 2A and an annular actuator 2B,<br>
wherein the upper mold body 2A comprises an upper side-mold<br>
corresponding to an upper side sidewall of a tire, an upper bead ring<br>
corresponding to an upper side bead, and a plurality of tread segments<br><br>
corresponding to a tread which are separable in the circumferential<br>
direction of tire and are expansible/contractible in diameter in the<br>
radial direction of tire, and the actuator 2B actuates the tread segments<br>
to expand and contract the diameter. The actuator 2B is attached to<br>
an upper base board portion 17 supported by the upper frame portion<br>
5B through first cylinders 12 so as to be movable up and down. The<br>
upper mold body 2A is supported by the upper base board portion 17<br>
through second cylinders 13 so as to be movable up and down. The<br>
upper mold 2 is in the closed state when it is at a descent position J1L,<br>
and is in the open state when it is at an elevated position J1U.<br>
The lower mold 3 includes, as briefly shown in Fig. 7, a lower<br>
side-mold 3a corresponding to a lower side sidewall, and a lower bead<br>
ring 3b corresponding to a lower side bead. The lower side-mold 3a is<br>
fixed to a lower base board portion 14 fixed to the traveling carriage 6.<br>
The lower bead ring 3b is attached to an upper end portion of a<br>
cylindrical center mechanism 16 which is supported by the traveling<br>
carriage 6 (or the lower base board portion 14) through third cylinders<br>
15 so as to be movable up and down. The center mechanism 16 can<br>
absorb and discharge a heating medium for vulcanization into or from a<br>
tire through, for example, a bladder.<br>
The lower mold 3 can move between the vulcanizing position P2<br>
and the carrying-in position P1 by backward and forward reciprocating<br>
movement of the traveling carriage 6.<br>
The green tire transfer device 9 is equipped with a grip assembly<br>
18 capable of gripping a green tire TA conveyed to the original position<br><br>
P0 and capable of moving up and down. The grip assembly 18 moves<br>
from the original position P0 to the carrying-in position P1 and<br>
descends at the carrying-in position P1 and, as shown in Fig. 4, it<br>
transfers the gripped green tire TA to the lower mold 3.<br>
In this embodiment, the green tire transfer device 9 has an arm<br>
19 which is pivotally attached at its one end portion to the upper frame<br>
portion 5B, as shown in Figs. 2 and 5, and which is pivotable about a<br>
pivot point Q1 in a horizontal plane, and the grip assembly 18 is<br>
attached to the other end portion of the arm 19. In this embodiment is<br>
shown a case where an elevating block 20 supported through a linear<br>
bearing or the like so as to be freely movable up and down is attached<br>
to the upper frame portion 5B, and the arm 19 is pivotally attached to<br>
the elevating block 20. The arm 19 may be directly pivotally attached<br>
to the upper frame portion 5B without using the elevating block 20.<br>
The grip assembly 18 is equipped with an annular frame 21 fixed<br>
to the above-mentioned other end of the arm 19, a plurality of cylinders<br>
23 (in this embodiment, four cylinders) attached to the annular frame<br>
21 and arranged at intervals on a circumferential line concentric with<br>
the annular frame 21, and gripping pieces 24 which are attached to<br>
lower ends of rods of the cylinders 23 and hold an upper side bead of<br>
the green tire TA in cooperation with each other. The cylinders 23<br>
used in this embodiment are guide shaft-equipped cylinders, and are<br>
attached to the annular frame 21 through fittings 22 fixed to the<br>
annular frame 21 so as to be tiltable about a shaft center "i" from a<br>
standard state that the rods are perpendicular to the annular frame to<br><br>
an inwardly tilting state that the cylinders tilt in the direction that the<br>
lower ends of the rods move toward the center of the above-mentioned<br>
circumferential line. Thus, as shown in Fig. 6, the gripping pieces 24<br>
can hold the upper side bead when the diameter expands in the<br>
standard state, and can release the upper side bead when the diameter<br>
contracts in the inwardly tilting state.<br>
Therefore, the green tire transfer device 9 can transfer a green<br>
tire TA gripped at the original position PO up to the carrying-in position<br>
P1 by horizontal rotation of the arm 19. Further, by extension of the<br>
cylinders 23 at the carrying-in position P1, the gripped green tire TA<br>
descends up to a descent position hL, and it is then transferred to the<br>
lower mold 3. In case of this embodiment, at this time, in the lower<br>
mold 3 the lower bead ring 3b moves upward together with the center<br>
mechanism 16 to receive once the green tire TA located in the descent<br>
position hL, as shown in Fig. 7. Therefore, in this embodiment, the<br>
lower bead ring 3b constitutes a receiver 25 for receiving the green tire<br>
TA. After the receipt, the green tire TA descends together with the<br>
lower bead ring 3b and is placed on the lower mold 3 with position<br>
adjustment. By once seating the green tire TA on the bead ring 3b in<br>
this manner, the load of the green tire TA concentrically acts on the<br>
bead ring 3b, so off-center arrangement or bad fit between the green tire<br>
TA and the bead ring 3b can be suppressed.<br>
A pressure cooling device 7 is disposed at the pressure cooling<br>
position P3, as shown in Fig. 1. It is a device for performing pressure<br>
cooling of a vulcanized tire TB with holding it. In this embodiment, the<br><br>
pressure cooling device 7 is rotatably attached to the upper frame 5B so<br>
that it can intermittently rotate about a horizontal axis 27 between the<br>
top and bottom positions, in other words, it can be turned upside down.<br>
Specifically, a pair of spindles 28, 28 extending vertically through a<br>
rotor 29 which is intermittently rotatable 180° are mounted on the<br>
horizontal axis 27 provided on the upper frame 5B in a protruding<br>
condition. Each spindle 28 is provided with an upper rim 30 for fixing<br>
the upper side bead of the vulcanized tire TB, and a lower rim 31 for<br>
fixing the lower side bead. Pressure cooling can be made by filling<br>
high-pressure air into the vulcanized tire TB held by the upper and<br>
lower rims between them. Further, the lower rim 31 to be disposed on<br>
the tip side of the spindle 28 is detachably mounted on the spindle 28,<br>
whereby it is possible to perform attachment and detachment of the<br>
vulcanized tire TB.<br>
The tire receiving and mounting device 8 is attached to the<br>
traveling carriage 6, as shown in Fig. 4. The device 8 receives a<br>
vulcanized tire TB held by the upper mold 2 at the vulcanizing position<br>
P2, and it further conveys it to the pressure cooling position P3 and fits<br>
in the pressure cooling device 7.<br>
Specifically, as shown in Fig. 8, the tire receiving and mounting<br>
device 8 comprises an elevating base 32 which is attached to the<br>
traveling carriage 6 and can move up and down, and a lower rim 31<br>
supported detachably by the elevating base 32. The elevating base 32<br>
includes an elevating base body 32A which is guided to move up and<br>
down on a guide board 33 fixed to the traveling carriage 6 through a<br><br>
linear bearing 33a, and a supporting arm 32B extending forward from<br>
the elevating base body 32A. The elevating base body 32A is connected<br>
to the top end of a rod of a cylinder 34 supported by the guide board 33<br>
and moves up and down by extension of the rod. The lower rim 31 is<br>
detachably supported at the tip of the supporting arm 32B through a<br>
rim support 35.<br>
The rim support 35 has a cylindrical trunk portion 35a fixed<br>
integrally and concentrically to the lower rim 31. The trunk portion<br>
35a is provided, on its inner surface, with for example a projecting<br>
locking part 35b by which the spindle 28 of the pressure cooling device<br>
7 can be detachably locked. Since such a rim support 35 forms an<br>
integrated body with the lower rim 31, it is advantageous for accurately<br>
and stably holding a thin lower rim 31, and handling of the lower rim<br>
31 such as attachment and detachment of the lower rim 31 to the<br>
pressure cooling device 7 can also be easily conducted.<br>
When the lower mold 3 is located at the carrying-in position P1<br>
and a green tire TA is transferred from the green tire transfer device 9 to<br>
the lower mold 3 as shown in Fig. 4, the lower rim 31 of the tire<br>
receiving and mounting device 8 is located at the vulcanizing position<br>
P2. At the vulcanizing position P2, the lower rim 31 receives a<br>
vulcanized tire TB from the upper mold 2.<br>
The receipt of the vulcanized tire TB is made by downward<br>
movement of a center shaft 39 (shown in Fig. 9) installed in the upper<br>
mold 2. Specifically, when vulcanization by the vulcanization mold 4 is<br>
completed, the upper mold 2 moves upward to the elevated position<br><br>
J1U to put the vulcanization mold 4 into an open state. At that time,<br>
the vulcanized tire TB has been lifted together with the upper mold 2.<br>
Thereafter, the traveling carriage 6 operates so that, as shown in Fig. 4,<br>
the lower rim 31 of the tire receiving and mounting device 8 moves to<br>
the vulcanizing position P2. In that state, the cylinder 34 of the tire<br>
receiving and mounting device 8 operates so as to elevate the lower rim<br>
31 from a descent position J2L to an ascent position J2U (shown in Fig.<br>
9). Thereafter, as shown in Fig. 9, the center shaft 39 descends to<br>
separate the vulcanized tire TB from the upper mold 2. The separated<br>
tire is received by the lower rim 31 located at the ascent position J2U<br>
and waiting below the upper mold 2. The center shaft 39 has, at its<br>
lower end, a paddle 39A the diameter of which is extensible and<br>
contractible, and it can pass through an upper bead hole of the<br>
vulcanized tire TB when the paddle has contracted. Also, at the time of<br>
extension, the paddle 39A can push a lower side bead down to separate<br>
the vulcanized tire TB and can press the lower side bead to the lower<br>
rim 31, whereby the vulcanized tire TB can be accurately seated on the<br>
lower rim 31 without causing off-center arrangement or poor fit.<br>
The green tire transfer device 9 lifts the received vulcanized tire<br>
TB up to the ascent position J2U at the pressure cooling position P3,<br>
whereby the vulcanized tire TB can be mounted on the spindle 28 of the<br>
pressure cooling device 7 together with the lower rim 31 and the rim<br>
support 35.<br>
In this embodiment, a carrying-out device 39 for receiving and<br>
carrying out the vulcanized tire TB which has been pressure-cooled, is<br><br>
installed below the pressure cooling device 7, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2.<br>
The carrying-out device 39 in this embodiment comprises a roller<br>
conveyer which is pivotally supported at a pivot point Q2 on the<br>
anterior end side and is tiltable from a horizontal waiting state Y1 to a<br>
forward tilting state Y2 (shown in Fig. 12(B)) that the posterior end side<br>
moves upward. The roller conveyer is provided at its center portion<br>
with a cut-away portion 39A (shown in Fig. 2) through which the lower<br>
rim 31 can pass upward and downward.<br>
In this carrying-out device 39, when it is in the waiting state Y1,<br>
the conveying surface is positioned on a lower level than the lower rim<br>
31 lying the descent position J2L of the tire receiving and mounting<br>
device 8, and when it is in the forward tilting state Y2, the conveying<br>
surface is positioned on a higher level than the lower rim 31. Therefore,<br>
the tire receiving and mounting device 8 can lift down the<br>
pressure-cooled vulcanized tire TB to the descent position J2L after<br>
receiving it from the pressure cooling device 7 together with the lower<br>
rim 31 and the rim support 35. Thereafter, when the carrying-out<br>
device 39 is tilted to the forward tilting state Y2, the vulcanized tire TB<br>
on the lower rim 31 held by the tire receiving and mounting device 8 is<br>
lifted up by the tilting conveying surface. Thus, only the vulcanized<br>
tire TB can be carried out along inclination of the conveying surface.<br>
That is to say, after the completion of the pressure cooling, only the<br>
vulcanized tire TB can be taken out, while recovering the lower rim 31<br>
and the rim support 35 to the tire receiving and mounting device 8.<br>
The operation of the tire vulcanizing apparatus 1 will be<br><br>
explained with reference to Figs. 10 and 11. Fig. 10(A) shows a state<br>
that the upper mold 2 has ascended up to the ascent position J1U after<br>
the completion of the vulcanization by the vulcanization mold 4. At<br>
that time, the tire receiving and mounting device 8 is located at the<br>
pressure cooling position P3, and the pressure-cooled vulcanized tire<br>
TB1 is removed thereby from the pressure cooling device 7 and carried<br>
out by the carrying-out device 39. Also, in the green tire transfer<br>
device 9, a green tire TA is carried in from the original position PO to the<br>
carrying-in position P1.<br>
Thereafter, as shown in Fig. 10(B), the traveling carriage 6 is<br>
moved backward, so the lower mold 3 and the tire receiving and<br>
mounting device 8 stop at the carrying-in position P1 and the<br>
vulcanizing position P2, respectively. Then, at the carrying-in position<br>
P1, the grip assembly 18 descends and transfers the gripped green tire<br>
TA to the underlying lower mold 3. Also, at the vulcanizing position P2,<br>
the lower rim 31 of the tire receiving and mounting device 8 ascends up<br>
to the ascent position J2U and receives a vulcanized tire TB held by the<br>
upper mold 2.<br>
Fig. 11 (A) shows a state that after the completion of the transfer<br>
of the green tire TA and the vulcanized tire TB, the grip assembly 18<br>
ascends to the waiting position, and the lower rim 31 of the tire<br>
receiving and mounting device 8 descends to the descent position J2L.<br>
Thereafter, as shown in Fig. 11(B), the traveling carriage is moved<br>
forward, so the lower mold 3 and the tire receiving and mounting device<br>
8 stop at the vulcanizing position P2 and the pressure cooling position<br><br>
P3, respectively.<br>
Then, at the vulcanizing position P2, the upper mold 2 descends<br>
and the green tire TA is vulcanized between the upper mold 2 and the<br>
lower mold 3, as shown in Fig. 12(A). Also, at the pressure cooling<br>
position P3, the lower rim 31 of the tire receiving and mounting device 8<br>
ascends up to the ascent position J2U, and the vulcanized tire TB<br>
received from the upper mold 2 is mounted on the pressure cooling<br>
device 7 together with the lower rim 31. After the completion of<br>
mounting, the pressure cooling device 7 is turned over in the state that<br>
the tire receiving and mounting device 8 has descended, whereby the<br>
positions of the pressure-cooled vulcanized tire TB1 and the non-cooled<br>
vulcanized tire TB are counterchanged up and down. Thereafter, as<br>
shown in Fig. 12(B), the tire receiving and mounting device 8 ascends<br>
and descends again to receive the pressure-cooled vulcanized tire TB1<br>
together with the lower rim 31, and only the pressure-cooled vulcanized<br>
tire TB1 is carried out by tilting the carrying-out device 39.<br>
Like this, since in the tire vulcanizing apparatus 1 of the present<br>
invention, a lower mold 3 and a tire receiving and mounting device 8 are<br>
mounted on a traveling carriage 6, movement of the lower mold 3<br>
between the carrying-in position P1 and the vulcanizing position P2 and<br>
movement of the device 8 between the vulcanizing position P2 and the<br>
pressure cooling position P3 can be achieved with high accuracy,<br>
respectively, by only reciprocating movement of the traveling carriage 6<br>
between two positions. Furthermore, an upper mold 2, a pressure<br>
cooling device 7 and a green tire transfer device 9 are mounted on a<br><br>
frame 5 supporting the traveling carriage 6. Further, while a green tire<br>
is directly received on the lower mold 3 at the carrying-in position P1, in<br>
the tire receiving and mounting device 8 a vulcanized tire TB is directly<br>
received on a lower rim 31 at the vulcanizing position P2, and the<br>
vulcanized tire TB is mounted on the pressure cooling device 7 together<br>
with the lower rim 31 at the pressure cooling position P3.<br>
Therefore, off-center arrangement, poor fit or the like which may<br>
occur at the time of transferring a tire at each of the positions P1 to P3,<br>
can be considerably suppressed, so carrying-in of green tires,<br>
vulcanization and pressure cooling can be continuously and efficiently<br>
performed and the quality and uniformity of vulcanized tires can be<br>
improved. Further, since the transfer pathway of tire can be simplified<br>
and shortened, apparatus and equipment can be downsized to achieve<br>
reduction of the installation space.<br>
Although a particularly preferable embodiment of the present<br>
invention has been described, the present invention can be practiced<br>
with modifications into various embodiments without being limited to<br>
the embodiment shown in the drawings.<br><br>
