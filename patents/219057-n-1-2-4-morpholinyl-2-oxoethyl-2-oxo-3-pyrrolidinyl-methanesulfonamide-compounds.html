				<td>PYRROLIDINE. DERIVATIVES AS FACTOR XA INHIBITORS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
1 The present invention relates to a novel class of chemical compounds, to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in medicine, particularly use in the amelioration of a clinical condition for which a Factor Xa inhibitor is indicated.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Factor Xa is a member of the trypsin-like serine protease class of enzymes. It is a key enzyme in the coagulation cascade. A one-to-one binding of Factors Xa and Va with calcium ions and phospholipid converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin plays a central role in the mechanism of blood coagulation by converting the soluble plasma protein, fibrinogen, into insoluble fibrin. The insoluble fibrin matrix is required for the stabilisation of the primary hemostatic plug. Many significant disease states are related to abnormal hemostasis. With respect to the coronary arterial vasculature, abnormal thrombus formation due to the rupture of an established atherosclerotic plaque is the major cause of acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina. Both treatment of an occlusive coronary thrombus by thrombolytic therapy and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) are often accompanied by an acute thrombotic reclosure of the affected vessel which requires immediate resolution. With respect to the venous vasculature, a high percentage of patients undergoing major surgery in the lower extremities or the abdominal area suffer from thrombus formation in the venous vasculature which can result in reduced blood flow to the affected extremity and a pre-disposition to pulmonary embolism. Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy commonly occurs within both vascular systems during septic shock, certain viral infections and cancer and is characterised by the rapid consumption of coagulation factors and systemic coagulation which results in the formation of life-threatening thrombi occurring throughout the vasculature leading to widespread organ failure.<br>
Beyond its direct role in the formation of fibrin rich blood clots, thrombin has been reported to have profound bioregulatory effects on a number of cellular components within the vasculature and blood, (Shuman, M.A., Ann. NY Acad. Sci., 405: 349 (1986)).<br>
A Factor Xa inhibitor may be useful in the treatment of acute vascular diseases such as coronary thrombosis (for example myocardial infarction and unstable angina), thromboembolism, acute vessel closure associated with thrombolytic therapy and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, transient ischemic attacks, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, peripheral arterial occlusion, prevention of vessel luminal<br>
narrowing (restenosis), and the prevention of thromboembolic events associated with atrial fibrillation, e.g. stroke. They may also have utility as anti-coagulant agents both in-vivo and ex-vivo, and in oedema and inflammation. Thrombin has been reported to contribute to lung fibroblast proliferation, thus, Factor Xa inhibitors could be useful for the treatment of some pulmonary fibrotic diseases. Factor Xa inhibitors could also be useful in the treatment of tumour metastasis, preventing the fibrin deposition and metastasis caused by the inappropriate activation of Factor Xa by cysteine proteinases produced by certain tumour cells. Thrombin can induce neurite retraction and thus Factor Xa inhibitors may have potential in neurogenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. They have also been reported for use in conjunction with thrombolytic agents, thus permitting the use of a lower dose of thrombolytic agent.<br>
The present invention provides novel Factor Xa inhibitors. Compounds of the present invention have oral bioavailability and PK profiles suitable for acute and chronic therapies.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) or (la) are Factor Xa inhibitors and as such are useful in the treatment of clinical conditions susceptible to amelioration by administration of a Factor Xa inhibitor. Such conditions include acute vascular diseases such as coronary thrombosis (for example myocardial infarction and unstable angina), thromboembolism, acute vessel closure associated with thrombolytic therapy and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), transient ischemic attacks, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, peripheral arterial occlusion, prevention of vessel luminal narrowing (restenosis), and the prevention of thromboembolic events associated with atrial fibrillation, e.g. stroke; in oedema and PAF mediated inflammatory diseases such as adult respiratory shock syndrome, septic shock and reperfusion damage; the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis; the treatment of tumour metastasis; neurogenerative disease such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases; viral infection; Kasabach Merritt Syndrome; Haemolytic uremic syndrome; arthritis; osteoporosis; as anti-coagulants for extracorporeal blood in for example, dialysis, blood filtration, bypass, and blood product storage; and in the coating of invasive devices such as prostheses, artificial valves and catheters in reducing the risk of thrombus formation.<br>
Accordingly, one aspect of present invention provides a compound of formula (I) or (la) or a physiologically acceptable salt or solvate thereof for use in medical therapy, particularly for use in the amelioration of a clinical condition in a mammal, including a human, for which a Factor Xa inhibitor is indicated.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a method for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of a mammal, including a human, suffering from a condition susceptible to amelioration by a Factor Xa inhibitor which method comprises administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or (la) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides the use of a compound of formula (I) or (la) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of a condition susceptible to amelioration by a Factor Xa inhibitor.<br>
Preferably, the condition susceptible to amelioration by a Factor Xa inhibitor is selected from coronary thrombosis (for example myocardial infarction and unstable angina), pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis and the prevention of thromboembolic events associated with atrial fibrillation, e.g. stroke;<br>
It will be appreciated that reference to treatment includes acute treatment or prophylaxis as well as the alleviation of established symptoms.<br>
While it is possible that, for use in therapy, a compound of the present invention may be administered as the raw chemical, it is preferable to present the active ingredient as a pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one compound of formula (I) or (la) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipient. The carrier and/or excipient must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deletrious to the receipient thereof.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising at least one compound of formula (I) or (la) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, thereof in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipient. The carrier and/or excipient must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deletrious to the receipient thereof.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising, as active ingredient, at least one compound of formula (I) or (la) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipient for use in therapy, and in particular in the treatment of human or animal subjects suffering from a condition susceptible to amelioration by a Factor Xa inhibitor.<br>
There is further provided by the present invention a process of preparing a pharmaceutical composition, which process comprises mixing at least one compound of formula (I) or (la) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipient.<br>
The compounds for use according to the present invention may be formulated for oral, buccal, parenteral, topical, rectal or transdermat administration or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation (either through the mouth or the nose).<br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g. pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g. lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g. potato starch or sodium starch glycollate); or wetting agents (e.g. sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicles before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g. sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g. lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g: almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol or fractionated vegetable oils); and preservatives (e.g. methyl or propyl-p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The preparations may also contain buffer salts, flavouring, colouring and sweetening agents as appropriate.<br>
Preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the active compound.<br>
For buccal administration the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in a conventional manner.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g. by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g. in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilising and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention may be formulated for topical administration by insufflation and inhalation. Examples of types of preparation for topical administration include sprays and aerosols for use in an inhaler or insufflator.<br>
Powders for external application may be formed with the aid of any suitable powder base, for example, lactose, talc or starch. Spray compositions may be formulated as aqueous solutions or suspensions or as aerosols delivered from pressurised packs, such as metered dose inhalers, with the use of a suitable propellant.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g. containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
In addition to the formulations described previously, the compounds may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously, transcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds according to the present invention may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
A proposed dose of the compounds according to the present invention for administration to a human (of approximately 70kg body weight) is 0.1 mg to 1g, preferably to 1mg to 500mg of the active ingredient per unit dose, expressed as the weight of free base. The unit dose may be administered, for example, 1 to 4 times per day. The dose will depend on the route of administration. It will be appreciated that it may be necessary to make routine variations to the dosage depending on the age and weight of the patient as well as the severity of the condition to be treated. The dosage will also depend on the route of administration. The precise dose and route of administration will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) or (la) may also be used in combination with other therapeutic agents. The invention thus provides, in a further aspect, a combination comprising a compound of formula (I) or (la) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof together with a further therapeutic agent.<br>
When a compound of formula (I) or (la) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof is used in combination with a second therapeutic agent active against the same disease state the dose of each compound may differ from that when the compound is used alone. The compounds of the present invention may be used in combination with other antithrombotic drugs such as thrombin inhibitors, thromboxane receptor antagonists, prostacyclin mimetics, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, fibrinogen antagonists, thrombolytic drugs such as tissue plaminogen activator and streptokinase, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, and the like.<br>
The combinations referred to above may conveniently be presented for use in the form of a pharmaceutical formulation and thus pharmaceutical formulations comprising a combination as defined above together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient comprise a further aspect of the invention. The individual components of such combinations may be administered either sequentially or simultaneously in separate or combined pharmaceutical formulations by any convenient route.<br>
When administration is sequential, either the Factor Xa inhibitor or the second therapeutic agent may be administered first. When administration is simultaneous, the combination may be administered either in the same or different pharmaceutical composition.<br>
When combined in the same formulation it will be appreciated that the two compounds must be stable and compatible with each other and the other components of the formulation. When formulated separately they may be provided in any convenient formulation, conveniently in such manner as are known for such compounds in the art.<br>
When a compound of formula (I) or (la) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof is used in combination with a second therapeutic agent active against the same disease state the dose of each compound may differ from that when the compound is used alone. Appropriate doses will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art. It will be appreciated that the amount of a compound of the invention required for use in treatment will vary with the nature of the condition being treated and the age and the condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) or (la) and physiologically acceptable salts or solvates thereof may be prepared by the processes described hereinafter, said processes constituting a further aspect of the invention. In the following description, the groups are as defined above for compounds of formula (I) or (la) unless otherwise stated.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process (A) for preparing a compound of formula (I) or (la), which process comprises reacting a compound of formula (II) with a compound of formula (III).<br>

Suitably, the reaction may be carried out in the presence of a coupling agent, for example 1-<br>
[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethyl carbodiimide hydrochloride,	HOBt (1-<br>
hydroxybenzotriazole), a base, e.g. Et3N (triethylamine), and an organic solvent, e.g. DCM (dichloromethane), suitably at room temperature.<br>
It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that compounds of formula (I) or (la) may be prepared by interconversion, utilising other compounds of formula (I) or (la) which are optionally protected by standard protecting groups, as precursors. For instance, compounds of formula (I) or (la) where B represents -C1.3alkylNH2, may be converted into compounds of formula (I) or (la) possessing alternative substituents on the heterocyclic ring, e.g. -C^ 3alkylNRbRc, by methods well known in the art (see for example March, J., Advanced Organic Chemistry, John Wiley &amp; Sons).<br>
Compounds of formula (II) may be prepared from compounds of formula (IV):<br>
wherein P1 is a suitable carboxylic acid protecting group, e.g. t-Butyl, by removal of the protecting group under standard conditions. For example, when P1 represents t-Butyl, removal of the protecting group may be effected under acidic conditions, using for example TFA (trifluoroacetic acid) in a solvent such as DCM.<br>
A compound of formula (IV) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (V) with a compound of formula (VI) where P1 is as described above:<br>

Preferably, the reaction is effected in a suitable organic solvent, e.g. THF, DMF, at a temperature from -78°C to +50°C, preferably -78°C to +20°C.<br>
Alternatively, where X is hydroxy, the coupling reaction is carried out using standard reagents such as DIAD (diisopropyl azodicarboxylate) and n-Bu3P (tri n-Butyl phosphine) in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, suitably at room temperature.<br>
A compound of formula (V) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (VII) with a compound of formula (VIII):<br><br><br>

A compound of formula (VII) may be prepared from a compound of formula (IX)<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
where P1 is as described above and P2 represents a suitable amine protecting group, e.g. Cbz (benzyloxycarbonyl), by removal of the protecting group under standard conditions. For example, the protecting group may be removed by reaction with hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst, e.g. palladium/charcoal at atmospheric pressure. Suitably, the reaction is carried out in an alcoholic solvent, e.g. ethanol, suitably at room temperature.<br>
A compound of formula (IX) may be prepared from a compound of formula (X)<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
by cyclisation, wherein P1 and P2 are as described above and L represents a leaving group, e.g. SMeRX. The ring closure may be performed by treatment with Dowex 2x8 400 mesh OH" resin in a suitable solvent, e.g. MeCN (acetonitrile). Alternatively, the ring closure may be performed by treatment with potassium carbonate in a suitable solvent, e.g. MeCN. Generally R will represent alkyl or aralkyl and X will represent halide, especially iodide or sulphate.<br>
Alternatively, a compound of formula (IX) may be prepared from a compound of formula (Xb):<br><br>
where P1 and P3 are protecting groups, by reaction with LiOH in a suitable solvent e.g. THF followed by reaction with DPPA (diphenylphosphoryl azide), a base e.g. Et3N (triethylamine) in a suitable solvent e.g. DMF, suitably at room temperature to 70°C.<br>
A compound of formula (Xb) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (Xb-1) with a compound of formula (Xb-2)<br>

of formula (XI)<br>
SMe<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
by treatment with RX, where P1 and P2 are as described above and RX is a compound (e.g. Mel, benzyl iodide or Me2SO4) capable of converting sulphur in the SMe moiety to a sulphonium salt, in a suitable solvent, e.g. propanone or acetonitrile.<br>
A compound of formula (XI) may be prepared by reacting B compound of formula (XII) with a compound of formula (XIII):<br>
Suitably, the reaction may be carried out in the presence of a coupling agent, for example 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethyl carbodiimide hydrochloride, HOBt, a base, e.g. Et3N, and an organic solvent, e.g. DCM, suitably at room temperature.<br>
There is provided a further process (B) for preparing compounds of formula (IV) from compounds of formula (VII). According to process (B), a compound of formula (IV) may be prepared by reductive amination of a compound of formula (VII) with R1aCHO (where R1a is R1 without a CH2 linker directly attached to the N) using a suitable selective reducing agent to produce a compound of formula (XIV), followed by reaction with a compound of formula (VIII) in the presence of a base, e.g. pyridine, and in a solvent, e.g. DCM, suitably at room temperature.<br>
The reductive amination is conveniently carried out by treatment with sodium triacetoxyborohydride in the presence of an acid such as acetic acid, in a solvent such as DCM, suitably at room temperature.<br>
Compounds of formulae (III), (VI), (VIII), (Xb-1), (Xb-2), (X), (XI), (XII) and (XIII) are known compounds and/or can be prepared by processes well known in the art.<br>
The various general methods described above may be useful for the introduction of the desired groups at any stage in the stepwise formation of the required compound, and it will be appreciated that these general methods can be combined in different ways in such multistage processes. The sequence of the reactions in multi-stage processes should of course be chosen so that the reaction conditions used do not affect groups in the molecule which are desired in the final product. For example, those skilled in the art will appreciate that, with the use of appropriate protecting groups, the coupling to any of groups -R1, -SO2A or formula (III) can be the final step in the preparation of a compound of formula (I) or (la). Hence, in another aspect of the invention, the final step in the preparation of a compound of formula (I) or (la) may comprise the coupling to group -R1 by reacting a compound of formula (XV) with a compound of formula (VI):<br>

Preferably, the reaction is effected in a suitable organic solvent, e.g. THF, DMF, at a temperature from -78°C to +50°C, preferably -78°C to +20°C.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention, the final step in the preparation of a compound of formula (I) or (la) may comprise the coupling to group -SO2A by reacting a compound of formula (XVI) with a compound of formula (VIII):<br><br>
The reaction is conveniently carried out in the presence of a base, e.g. pyridine, and in a suitable solvent, e.g. DCM, suitably at room temperature.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention, a compound of formula (I) where R1 is an aryl or heteroaryl group may be prepared from a compound of formula (XV) by reaction with a compound of formula (XVII):<br>
R1-C1      (XVII)<br>
where C1 is a suitable coupling group e.g. boronate [B(OH)2] under metal catalysis, for example, with a copper salt such as copper(ll) acetate, in the presence of an organic solvent e.g. DCM and a base, e.g. pyridine and optionally in the presence of molecular sieves.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention, a compound of formula (I) where A is -SO2-CH=CH-aryf, SO2-CH=CH-heteroaryl, SO2-C(CH3)=CH-aryl or SO2-C(CH3)=CH-heteroaryl may be prepared from a compound of formula (XVI) where R1 is hydrogen, by reaction with a compound of formula (XVIII), or alternatively with a compound of formula (XIX):<br>
T1-SO2-C(R)=CH2     (XVIII)<br>

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that in the preparation of the compound of formula (I) or (la) or a solvate thereof it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect one or more sensitive groups in the molecule to prevent undesirable side reactions. Suitable protecting groups for use according to the present invention are well known to those skilled in the art and may be used in a conventional manner. See, for example, "Protective groups in organic<br>
synthesis" by T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts (John Wiley &amp; sons 1991) or "Protecting Groups" by P.J. Kocienski (Georg Thieme Verlag 1994). Examples of suitable amino protecting groups include acyl type protecting groups (e.g. formyl, trifluoroacetyl, acetyl), aromatic urethane type protecting groups (e.g. benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) and substituted Cbz), aliphatic urethane protecting groups (e.g. 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), isopropyloxycarbonyl, cyclohexyloxycarbonyl) and alkyl type protecting groups (e.g. benzyl, trityl, chlorotrityl). Examples of suitable oxygen protecting groups may include for example alky silyl groups, such as trimethylsilyl or tert-butyldimethylsilyl; alkyl"ethers such as tetrahydropyranyl or tert-butyl; or esters such as acetate.<br>
Various intermediate compounds used in the above-mentioned process, including but not limited to certain compounds of formulae formulae (II), (IV), (V), (VII), (IX), (XIV), (XV) and (XVI) are novel and accordingly constitute a further aspect of the present invention.<br>

In vitro assay for inhibition of Factor Xa<br>
Compounds of the present invention were tested for their Factor Xa inhibitory activity as determined in vitro by their ability to inhibit human Factor Xa in a chromogenic assay, using N-a-benzyloxycarbonyl-D-Arg-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide as the chromogenic substrate. Compounds were diluted from a 10mM stock solution in dimethylsulfoxide at appropriate concentrations. Assay was performed at room temperature using buffer consisting of: 50mM Tris-HCI, 150mM NaCI, 5mM CaCI2, pH 7.4. containing human Factor Xa (final cone. Of 0.0015 U.ml-1). Compound and enzyme were preincubated for 15min prior to addition of the substrate (final cone, of 200uM). The reaction was stopped after 30min with the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor or H-D-PHE-PRO-ARG-Chloromethylketone. BioTek EL340 or Tecan SpectraFluor Plus plate readers were used to monitor the absorbance at 405nM. To obtain IC50 values the data were analysed using ActivityBase® and XLfit®.<br>
All of the synthetic Example compounds tested (Examples 1-52, 54-89) exhibited ICso values of less than 60fiM. Preferably compounds have an IC50 value of less than 2fiM, more preferably compounds have an IC50 value of less than 0.1 \iM.<br>
Measurement of prothrombin time (PT) - Test 1<br>
Blood was collected into a sodium citrate solution (ratio 9:1) to give a final concentration of 0.38% citrate. Plasma was generated by centrifugation of citrated blood samples at 1200 xg for 20min at 4°C .<br>
The PT test was performed at 37°C in plastic cuvettes containing a magnetic ball bearing. 50uL of citrated plasma and either 25uL of 2.8% DMSO for control or 25uL of test compound (dissolved in DMSO and diluted in water and 2.8% DMSO to give 0.4% DMSO final in assay) at a concentration of 7-times the final desired concentration was pippetted into each cuvette. This mixture was incubated for 1min at 37°C before adding 100|jL of thromboplastin mixture (comprising lyophilised rabbit thromboplastin and calcium chloride which was reconstituted in distilled water as per manufacturer's [Sigma] instructions). On addition of the thromboplastin mixture, the timer was automatically started and continued until the plasma clotted. The time to clotting was recorded (normal range for human plasma is 10-13 seconds).<br>
Method for measurement of prothrombin time (PT) - Test 2<br>
Blood is collected into a sodium citrate solution (ratio 9:1) to give a final concentration of 0.38% citrate. Plasma is generated by centrifugation of citrated blood samples at 1200 xg for 20min at 4°C.<br>
The PT test is performed at 37°C in plastic cassettes and using a MCA210 Microsample Coagulation Analyzer (Bio/Data Corporation). For assay, 25 ul of plasma containing test compound at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 uM (made from a 1 mM stock solution in 10% DMSO and plasma) and 25 ul of Thromboplastin C Plus (Dade Berhing) are automatically injected into the cassette. Upon addition of the Thromboplastin C Plus, the instrument determines and records the time to clot (normal range for human plasma is 10-13 seconds).<br>
