We claim<br>
1.	A novel feature of the present invention relates to the synthesis of a new quinazolinones, which contains proline amino acid instead of amino compounds.<br>
2.	A process for the preparation of formula II compounds in which the anthranilic acid and its halogenated derivatives were refluxed on sand bath to get the formula II compounds.<br>
3.	All the title compounds (A, B, C, D and E) are superior to the standard isoniazid drug.<br>
4.	Compounds derived from dibromo and mono iodo anthranilic acids (C and E) are<br>
generally superior to the other title compounds (A, B and D).<br>
5.	A process for the synthesis of quinazolinones as antimycobacterial agents substantially<br>
as herein described and illustrated. All the five title compounds synthesised were screened<br>
for in vitro anti tubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis by using Alamar<br>
Blue assay method. The standard drug, Isoniazid and the title compounds are compared for<br>
antimycobacterial activity. The activity of the title compounds against mycobacterium<br>
tuberculosis was checked at the concentrations of 100, 10, 1, 0.1 and 0.05 |Jg / ml and for<br>
the standard drug, Isoniazid respectively. All the title compounds are sensitive to organism<br>
in the concentrations of 100, 10, 1 and 0.1 µg / ml and two compounds derived from<br>
dibromo and mono iodo anthranilic acids (C and E) are sensitive at 0.05 |µg / ml. Standard<br>
drug Isoniazid is sensitive to organism only in the concentrations of 100, 10, 1 (Jg / ml.<br><br><br><br></td>
