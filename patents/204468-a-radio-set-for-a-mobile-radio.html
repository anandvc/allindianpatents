ROBERT BOSCH GMBH, 7 044 2--Stuttgart<br>
i<br>
Radio 3et<br>
P-j^-ior a-r-t-<br>
The invention is based on a radio set of the generic type of the main claim.<br>
Radio sets which are provided with a receiving<br>
section for signal reception from radio stations are<br>
i<br>
already known.	i<br>
Advantages-—of—4-he	in-ven-tion<br>
The radio set according to the .invention and having the features of the main claim in contrast has the advantage that the quality of the actual signal reception can be matched to a signal reception quality level which can be preset, for example by the user... This fallows the reception quality of the radio set to be adjusted individually, as required.<br>
The measures described in1 the dependent claims permit advantageous developments and improvements of the radio set specified in the main claim.<br>
It is particularly advantageous if, in the event of faulty signal reception, the evaluation unit raises the sensitivity and/or.the signal-to-noise ratio of the receiving section, particularly in the event of adj acent channel interference or intermodulation and; if signal reception is fault-free for a given time, reduces the sensitivity and/or the signal-to-noise ■* *ratio: of the receiving section. Particularly when reception conditions are good, this allows energy to be saved, so that the operating life of a rechargeable battery in the radio set is increased.<br><br>
The use of at least .one receiving amplifier which can be connected is also advantageous, which the evaluation unit connects if signal reception is faulty, and bridges if signal reception is fault-free. This provides a particularly simple capability for influencing the sensitivity of the receiving section, and this leads to a considerable saving of power, particularly when signal reception is fault-free.<br>
It is furthermore advantageous if the receiving section has at least one mixer and if the evaluation unit raises the power supply of the at least one mixer to a first given level if signal reception is faulty, and reduces it to a second given level if signal reception is fault-free. This provides a particularly simple capability for influencing the signal-to-noise ratio, particularly the intermodulation response of the receiving section, which allows the power consumption to be' reduced considerably, particularly for fault-free signal reception.<br>
It is furthermore advantageous if the receiving section includes at least one first filter configuration and one second filter configuration, and if the evaluation unit switches to the first filter configuration if signal reception is faulty, and switches to the second filter configuration if signal reception is fault-free. In this way, depending on whether adjacent channel filtering is particularly important or there is a need to mask interference in the wanted channel, it is possible to choose that filter configuration which is the more suitable for the-respective case, so that in this way it is possible to optimize the quality of signal reception in a simple manner.<br>
It is furthermore advantageous if an operating mode is provided in which the evaluation unit raises the sensitivity and/or the signal-to-noise ratio of the receiving section to a maximum level. In this way, it is possible to switch the receiving section to maximum sensitivity and/or signal-to-noise ratio at any time<br><br>
if, for example for test purposes, there is no concern about power consumption.<br>
It is also advantageous if an input chute for a smart card and a card reader are provided, and if the operating mode is adj ustable as a function of a smart card which is detected by the card reader in the input chute. In this way, the performance of the receiving section of the radio set can be tested with the aid of the smart card, for an equipment test. The smart card may in this case at the same time carry out the function of access authorization for test purposes.<br>
A further advantage is for the operating mode preferably to be adjustable by means of a push button on the radio set. This jrepresents a particularly simple measure for adjusting the maximum performance of the receiving section of the radio set.<br>
A further advantage is for the operating mode-<br>
to be adjustable as a function of a request from a* base<br>
i.<br>
station to the radio set, preferably to return a signal which,has previously been transmitted to the radio set. In this way, the receiving section of the radio set is automatically set to the best-possible reception quality, for example for test purposes initiated by the<br>
base station.<br>
i<br>
' It is also advantageous if the or'— ■--' is adjustable on detection ol an external power supply, in particular via a power supply adapter, and/or an external antenna being connected. In this case, it is possible to dispense with electricity saving measures in the radio set in favour of improved signal reception, since an external rove:! supply is available or, particularly on detection of an external antenna being connected, it is; possible to deduce that the radio set is being used in a motor vehicle so that faster replacement of the radio cells may be assumed than :if the setting had to be made with the radio set being operated on foot, and the radio set thus having to be set to the best-possible reception quality. On the basis of detection, the setting 
 <br>
mode may be carried out automatically, that is to say without any action by the user.<br>
It is furthermore advantageous if a sensor is<br>
| provided and if the operating mode is adjustable as a function of a measured value determined by the sensor. This provides a further simple capability for setting the receiving section of the radio set to the best possible signal reception, automatically. In this case, virtually any desired measurement variables may be used as the basis for adjustment of this operating mode, depending on the nature of the sensor chosen.<br>
A further advantage is for the sensor to detect the charge of a rechargeable battery which is connected<br>
; to the radio set, and for the operating mode to be variable as a function of the charge of the rechargeable battery which is detected by the sensor. This ensures that the changeover to high power consumption in the receiving section of the radio set is made 'only if the voltage available from the rechargeable battery does not collapse unacceptably severely.<br>
A further advantage is also for an interface to be provided for the connection of a data processing unit, and for the operating mode to be variable as a function of data which are transmift-^H +■• l . ... ^ 0et via the interface. This allows the reception quality of the receiving section of the radio set to be monitored and programmed externally by the user.<br>
Drawing<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is illustrated in the drawing and is explained in more detail in the following description. Figure 1 shows a blocfc diagram of a radio set according to the invention, and Figure 2 shows a flowchart of an evaluation unit for the radio set.<br><br>
Description of the exemplary embodiment<br>
i<br>
In Figure 1, 35 denotes a first receiving antenna of a radio set 95 intended for mobile radio. The receiving antenna 35 can be connected via a first switch 135. in a first switch position 14 0 to a second switch 40, which is controllable. In a second switch position 145, a second receiving antenna 115 can be connected to the second switch 40, via the first switch 135. In a first switch position 85, the input of h receiving amplifier 10 in a receiving section 1 of the radio set 95 can be connected via the second switch 40 to the receiving antenna 35, 115, which is connected via the first switch 135. The receiving section 1 also includes a demodulator 45 which is connected on the input side to the output of the receiving amplifier 10 and, in addition to other assemblies that are not illustrated, also includes a mixer 15. The output of the demodulator 4 5 can be connected via a third switch 165, - in a first switch position 170, to the input of a first filter configuration 100 and, in a second switch position 175, to the input of a second filter configuration 105. The output of the first filter configuration 100 and the output of the second filter configuration 105 are connected to one another and are connected to the input of a decoder 50 which, like the two filter configurations 100, 105, is likewise arranged in the receiving section 1 and can be connected at its output to further receiving modules in the radio set, in a manner known to the person skilled in the art, as is indicated by the dashed arrow at the output of the decoder 5 0 in Figure 1. The output of the decoder 50 is also connected to a first input 60 of an evaluation unit 5. A second input 65 of the evaluation unit 5 can be connected via a push-button switch 30 to a reference-earth potential. A third input 70 of the evaluation unit 5 is connected to a card reader 25, which is arranged in an input chute 2 0 in the radio set 95. In order to detect its switch position, the first<br><br>
switch 135 is connected to the evaluation unit 5 via a fourth input 71 of said evaluation unit 5. The second switch 40; the receiving amplifier 10, the demodulator 45 with the mixer 15, the third switch 165, the decoder 50, the evaluation unit 5 and the card reader 25 can be supplied with electricity via a rechargeable battery 55. In this case, the power supply to the receiving amplifier 10 can be supplied via a fourth switch 150 in a first switch position 155, while, in contrast, when the fourth switch 150 is in a second switch position 160, the receiving amplifier 10 can be decoupled from the ; power supply. The fourth switch 150 can also be supplied with electricity from the rechargeable battery 55. In order to supply power, the rechargeable battery 55 dan be connected t[o the relevant components via a fifth switch 180 in a first switch position 185. However, power may also be supplied externally, for example via the car radio in a motor vehicle or, in general, via a power supply adapter 110 f or * mains operation,1 the connection to the mains being illustrated in Figure 1 by a dashed arrow at one input of the power supply ..adapter 110. In order to connect the external power supply, the power supply adapter 110 is connected to the components to be supplied, with the fifth switch 180 in a second switch position 190. A sensor 120 for detecting the charge level 6f the rechargeable battery 55 is connected to the rechargeable battery 55, and is likewise supplied with electricity via the fifth; switch 18 0 from the rechargeable battery 55 or from the power supply adapter 110, depending on the switch position. Since the sensor 120 is used only for detection of the charge level of the rechargeable battery 55, it is aljso sufficient for the power supply for the sensor 120 to be provided only via the rechargeable battery 55. The fifth switch 18 0 is connected to the evaluation unit 5 via ; a fifth input 7 2, and the sensor 120 is connected to the evaluation unit 5 via a sixth input 73. An external data processing unit 130 is connected to the<br><br>
evaluation unit 5 via an interface 125 and a seventh input 74 . The rechargeable battery 5 5 or the power supply adapter 110 also supply power to other receiving modules which are not  illustrated in  Figure  1.  The<br>
•r<br>
Evaluation unit 5 has a first output 75 for controlling the power supply of the mixer 15, a second output 8 0 for controlling the switch positions of the second and of the fourth switch 40, 150, which are both controllable, and a third output 81 for controlling the switch positions of the third switch 165, which is likewise controllable. In a second switch position 90, the second switch 40 connects the receiving antenna 35, 115 (which is connected in a corresponding manner via the first switch 135) directly to the output of the receiving amplifier 10 and thus to the input of the demodulator 45, so that the receiving amplifier 10 is in this way bridged.<br>
The method of operation of the evaluation unit 5 is explained in more detail in Figure 2 with reference to a flowchart. The flowchart sequence in this case takes place after each reception of a pulse sequence, which is also called a burst- At the same time,, a global variable is introduced, which contains the number of successive uninterrupted bursts received Without any faults. This global variable is initialized to zero on the first pass through the flowchart according to Figure 2 and, at the same time, the second switch 4 0 and the fourth switch 150 are both in their second switch position 90, 160, the power supply of the * mixer 15 is reduced to a second given level, and the third switch 165 is in its second switch position 175. Furthermore, a constant is provided which indicates the number of bursts received successively without any faults and without interruption after which the receiving section 1 can be operated in a power saving mode. This constant therefore defines a time after which the sensitivity and/or the signal-to-noise ratio of the receiving section 1 can be reduced if signal reception is fault-free.<br><br>
At a proa ram point 200, the evaluation unit 5 checks whether the card reader 25 in the input chute 20 is d&gt; f ing a smart card which, on the one hand, provi des access authorization for the radio set and, on ' lie other hand, provides the changeover to an operating mode for test purposes. Furthermore, a check is carried out at this program point 200 to determine whether the second  input  65  ol  the  evaluation  unit  5  has  been<br>
connected  via  the  push-button  switch  30  to  the<br>
i<br>
reference-earth potential. In addition, . the switch position of the first switch 135 and the switch position of the fifth switch 180 are tested. A check is in this case carried 'out to determine whether the second receiving antenna 115 has been connected to the radio set 95 and whether the radio set 95 is being supplied with external power via the power supply adapter 110. A check is also carried out1' to determine whether the setting of the operating mode for test purposes has been arranged by the data processing unit 130. The evaluation of the signal decoded by the decoder 50 is also used in the evaluation unit 5 to check -whether the radio set 95 has been requested by a base station to change to the1 operating mode for . test purposes, a signal which has previously been transmitted from the base station to the radio set 95 being returned by the radio set 95 to the base station again, for test purposes, in a so-called echo mode. In addition, the measurement signal from the sensor 120 is used in the evaluation unit 5 to check whether, with the fifth switch 180 set to the first switch position 185, , there is still sufficient charge in the rechargeable battery 55 to switch to high power consumption without the supply voltage collapsing unacceptably severely. If 'at least one of the abovementioned conditions is satisfied with sufficient charge in the rechargeable battery 55 and/or the power supply adapter 110 connected, then a branch is made to program point 205, otherwise a branch is made to program point 220.  At program point 205,  the second<br><br>
switch 40 and the fourth switch 150 are switched over from the evaluation unit 5 to their respective first ^switch position 85, 155 and, in consequence, the receiving .amplifier 10 in the receiving section 1 is connected, if it was not already connected. In this way, the evaluation unit 5 raises the sensitivity of the receiving sect ion 1 to a maximum level . At program point 210, the power supply of the mixer 15 is raised by Hie evaluation unit 5 to a first predetermined level, if this power supply has not already been set to this level. In this way, the intermodulation resistance of the receiving section 1 is raised to a maximum level, and interference in the wanted channel is minimized. At program point 215, the third switch 165 is switched over from the evaluation unit 5 to its first switch position 170 and, in consequence, the first filter configuration 100 is connected in the reception signal path, if the first filter configuration 100 has not already been connected in the signal reception path. In this way, the signal-to-noise ratio of the receiving section 1 is raised further as a result of the fact that adjacent channel interference and interference in the wanted channel are largely masked out in the first filter configuration 100 chosen. Depending on the test situation, this task can also be carried out better by the second filter configuration 105 or by other filter configurations which are not illustrated in Figure 1 and can be connected via the. third switch 165. The evaluation unit 5 has to initiate th,e switch position to be set on the third switch 165 as a function of the existing test situation, which may be reported to it, for example, by the data processing unit 130 or the base station. Depending on the configuration of the program step 215, the radio set 95 may thus be tested with its receiving section 1 at the maximum performance level. The program is then left. At program point 220, a check is carried out to determine whether there were any faults in the last burst received. I if this is the case, thon a branch<br><br>
.idde to program point 22 5, otherwise a branch is made to program point 2 60 . At program point 225, the global variable is reset to zero. A check is carried out at program point 230 to determine whether a fcontrol signal is present at the second output 8 0 of the evaluation unit 5 holding the second switch 40 and the fourth switch 150 in their respective first switch positions 85, 155. If this is the case, then a branch is. made to program point 235, otherwise a branch is made to program point 2 55. ,A check is carried out at program point 235 to determine whether the power supply of the mixer 15 has been raised by the evaluation unit 5 to the first preset level. If this is the case, a branch is made to program point 240, otherwise a branch is made to program point 250. At program point 240, a check is carried out to determine whether a control signal is present at the third output 81 of the evaluation unit 5 holding the third switch 165 in i'ts first switch position 170. If this is the case, then the program is left, otherwise a branch is made to program point 245. At program point 245, the evaluation unit 5 causes the third switch 165 to change its first switch position 170 for switching. Depending on the test situation, a filter configuration other than the first filter configuration 100 may be more suitable for raising the reception quality, so that a changeover is made to the correspondingly most suitable filter configuration, as described above. For the present exemplary embodiment,  it will in this case always be<br>
assumed that this is the case for the first filter<br>
i<br>
configuration 100. The program is left after program point 24 5. At program point 250, the power supply of the mixer 15 is raised by the evaluation unit 5 to the first preset level. The program is then left. At program point 2 55,  the evaluation unit 5 causes the<br>
second switch 40 and the fourth switch 150 to switch<br>
i<br>
over to their respective  first switch positions  85, 155. The program is then left.<br><br>
At program point 2 60, ;the global variable is incremented. A check is . carried out at program point 2 65 to determine whether the value of the global variable corresponds to the value of the constant. I f this is the case, then a branch is made to program point' 270, otherwise the program is left. At program point 270, the evaluation unit 5 causes the second switch 40 and the switch 150 to switch to their respective second switch positions 90, 160, if this second switch position 90 has not already been selected. At program point 275, the power supply of the mixer 15 is reduced by the evaluation unit 5 to the second preset level, if the power supply of the mixer 15 has not already been set to this level. At program point 28 0, the second filter configuration 105 is connected into the transmission path by the third switch 165 being in its second switch position 175 or, if active filters arte used, that filter configuration 100, 105 which consumes less power. The program is then left.<br>
In contrast to the second switch 40, tfce third switch 165 and the fourth switch 150, the first switch 135 and the fifth switch 180 are not designed to be contrbllable. The changeover of the first switch 135 and of the fifth switch 180 is also not initiated by the evaluation unit 5, but takes place when the radio set 95 is connected to the second receiving antenna 115 or to the external power supply or the power supply adapter 110 of, for example, the car radio, for which purpose the two switches 135, 180 are designed in an' advantageous manner as a pressure contact. When the radio set 95 is removed from the car radio, the two switches 135, 180 then both spring back to their first switch positions 140, 185 for connection of the first receiving antenna 35 and of the rechargeable battery. 55. The setting of the operating mode for test purposes, which leads to optimized reception conditions and is set, for example, by operating the push-button switch 30, can also be used for normal operation,  in<br><br>
order  to  avoid  generally  poor  comprehensibility resulting from faulty bursts.<br>
A	An operating menu can also be provided on the<br>
radio set 95, which the user may use to select whether he considers good reception quality or long life of the rechargeable battery 55 to be more important. This choice may be stored in a memory in the radio set 95, which memory is not illustrated in Figure 1 but is connected to the evaluation unit 5, and is likewise tested as a condition for setting the operating mode for test purposes.<br>
Furthermore, a smart card which can be entered in the input chute 20 can also be programmed such that the evaluation unit 5 J is caused to operate the radio set 95 with the lowest possible current in all cases, even at the expense of reception quality. Finally, it is also conceivable for each user to be given his request relating to the reception quality of the receiving 'section 1 and the supply life of a rechargeable battery charge on the basis of an appropriately programmed smart card for insertion into the input chute 20, so that the reception quality of the receiving section 1 of the radio set 95 can be set to be user-specific. By use of appropriate programming for the smart cards, a service provider may also raise charges at different levels for different reception qualities.<br>
If the power supply of the mixer 15, that is to say its operating point, is raised, then a mixer characteristic is produced in which intermodulation products in the wanted frequency band are reduced and, in consequence, any corresponding noise influence on the received wanted signals is reduced.<br>
In the described exemplary embodiment, the evaluation unit 5 has a number of possible ways of matching the sensitivity and/or the signal-to-noise ratio of the receiving section 1 to the reception or test conditions. In this case, the power consumption is irrelevant  if,  for  example,  a  smart  card  has  been<br><br>
inserted into the inplat chute 20 for test purposes. This situation does not relate to normal telephone operation, but to a test operating mode. The sensitivity and/or the signal-to-noise ratio of the receiving section 1 are/is thus raised to the maximum level.<br>
A differential procedure is used in normal' operation. If a burst has already been received poorly, the sensitivity of the receiving section 1 is first of;. all raised by connecting the power-consuming receiving amplifier 10. If this measure is unsuccessful since a burst is once again received with faults within the given, time, then the intermodulation resistance is improved by raising the operating point or the power supply of the mixer 15. If this measure does not lead to the desired success either, the person skilled in the art may take further measures known to him for raising the sensitivity and/or the signal-to-noise ratio of the receiving section 1, for example the connection of the filter configuration 100, 105 that is more suited to the respective reception situation, or further measures which are not, however, described in this exemplary embodiment. The said power-consuming measures are not cancelled, to save power, until fault-free reception has continued for a time predetermined by the constant. If the reception conditions have not improved by this point, a maximum of three bursts are once again lost as a result of the faulty reception before the change to maximum sensitivity and/or signal-to-noise ratio in the receiving section 1 is made once<br>
again .■<br>
i<br>
The invention is in this case not limited to radio sets for mobile radio, but may be used for all radio traffic applications, that is to say, for example, for cordless telephony as well.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
