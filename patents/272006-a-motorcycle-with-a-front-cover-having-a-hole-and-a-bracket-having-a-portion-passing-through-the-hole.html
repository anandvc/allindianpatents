BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a motorcycle and<br>
particularly to a motorcycle having a front cover disposed above<br>
10 a headlight.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
There is a widespread motorcycle provided with a front<br>
cover for covering a headlight in front of a vehicle body in<br>
order to protect a rider from flowing air, reduce traveling<br>
15 resistance, and improve appearance (e.g., JP-A-S58-56977).<br>
Although the prior-art front cover has the functions of<br>
protecting the rider from flowing air, reducing traveling<br>
resistance, and improving appearance, to add a yet another<br>
function to them has never be thought of. The inventor of the<br>
20 present application tried to increase a degree of freedom in<br>
design of the motorcycle by adding a new function to the front<br>
cover.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made with this point in<br>
25 view and it is a main object of the invention to provide a<br>
1<br>
 <br>
motorcycle in which a plate member can be mounted to the front<br>
cover.<br>
A motorcycle of the present invention includes a front<br>
cover disposed above a headlight. The front cover includes a<br>
5 front cover main body portion and a hole formed in the front<br>
cover main body portion. The front cover main body portion is<br>
provided at a back side thereof with a mount portion for a bracket<br>
having a portion passing through the hole.<br>
According to the motorcycle of the invention, the front<br>
10 cover main body portion forming the front cover is provided at<br>
the back side thereof with the mount portion for the bracket<br>
having the portion passing through the hole formed in the front<br>
cover main body portion. Therefore, if the portion passing<br>
through the hole has a retaining portion for retaining a plate<br>
15 member in front of the front cover main body portion, it is<br>
possible to mount the plate member in front of the front cover<br>
main body portion.<br>

5 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
An embodiment according to the present invention will be<br>
descried below with reference to the drawings . In the following<br>
drawings, components having substantially the same functions<br>
will be shown with the same reference numerals to simplify the<br>
10 description. The invention is not limited to the following<br>
embodiment.<br>
With reference to FIGS. 1 to 4, a motorcycle 1000<br>
according to the embodiment of the invention will be described.<br>
FIG. 1 is a general side view of the motorcycle 1000<br>
15 according to the embodiment. As shown in FIG. 1, the motorcycle<br>
1000 of the embodiment is formed of a front wheel 110, a rear<br>
wheel 120, and a drive source (engine) 130 provided between the<br>
front wheel 110 and the rear wheel 120.<br>
The front wheel 110 is rotatably supported by front forks<br>
20 140. The front wheel 110 is covered with a front fender 180<br>
while the rear wheel 120 is covered with a rear fender 190.<br>
The front forks 140 are connected to handlebars 150 with<br>
head pipes 142 interposed therebetween. Behind the handlebars<br>
150, a fuel tank 160 and a seat 170 on which a rider is seated<br>
25 are provided. Below (or diagonally behind and below) the seat<br>
3<br>
 <br>
170, the rear wheel (driving wheel) 120 is positioned.<br>
In front of the handlebars 150, a headlight 50 is<br>
positioned. Above the headlight 50, a front cover 100 is<br>
provided. In the embodiment, the headlight 50 is covered with<br>
5 the front cover 100.<br>
FIG. 2 is a front view showing a structure of the front<br>
cover 100 of the embodiment. FIG. 3 is a sectional view taken<br>
along a line III-III in FIG. 2. FIG. 4 is a drawing showing<br>
a back of the front cover 100, i.e., a view from the handlebars<br>
10 150.<br>
The front cover 100 includes a front cover main body<br>
portion 11 and a hole 20 formed in the front cover main body<br>
portion 11. The front cover main body portion 11 is made of<br>
resin, for example, and thickness of the front cover main body<br>
15 portion 11 is 2 to 3 mm, for example.<br>
The hole 20 passes through the front cover main body<br>
portion 11 from a surface 11 to a back face 11b. This hole<br>
20 extends along a front-back direction of the vehicle of the<br>
motorcycle 1000 as shown in FIG. 3. Moreover, the hole 20<br>
20 extends in the direction along the surface 11 of the front cover<br>
main body portion 11.<br>
Provided behind the front cover main body portion 11 is<br>
a mount portion 14 for a bracket 10 having a portion 12 passing<br>
through the hole 20. The portion 12 passing through the hole<br>
25 20 includes a retaining portion 16 for retaining a plate member<br>
4<br>
 <br>
30 in front of the front cover main body portion 11. The<br>
retaining portion 16 has such a structure as to be able to retain<br>
the plate member 30. In one example in the embodiment, the plate<br>
member 30 is fixed to the retaining portion 16 by fastening<br>
5 members (screws, pins, etc.).<br>
The mount portion 14 of the bracket 10 is disposed near<br>
the back of the front cover main body portion 11 and on a side<br>
of the back face 11b of the front cover main body portion 11<br>
in this example. The mount portion 14 in the embodiment is made<br>
10 of the same material as the front cover main body portion 11.<br>
The mount portion 14 and the bracket 10 are fixed to each other<br>
by using fastening members (e.g., screws) 15.<br>
In the embodiment, the plate member 30 is a license plate.<br>
The bracket 10 is a support member for the license plate and<br>
15 is formed of a steel sheet, for example. The portion 12 of the<br>
bracket 10 passing through the hole 20 is formed of a member<br>
formed by bending one steel sheet or a stick-shaped member.<br>
Behind the front cover main body portion 11, a meter 60<br>
for the motorcycle is disposed as shown in FIG. 3. Between the<br>
20 front cover main body portion 11 and the meter 60, the mount<br>
portion 14 for the bracket 10 is provided.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the surface 11a of the front cover<br>
main body portion 11 is formed with a recessed portion 19<br>
sandwiched between ridge lines 17. In the embodiment, the hole<br>
25 20 is formed at part of the recessed portion 19. The ridge lines<br>
5<br>
 <br>
17 are a pair of left and right ridge lines 17. The hole 20<br>
is formed across the surface 11a of the front cover main body<br>
portion 11 between the left ridge line 17 and the right ridge<br>
line 17. The hole 20 is in a rectangular or elliptic shape,<br>
5 for example.<br>
In the motorcycle 1000 of the embodiment, the hole 20 is<br>
formed in the front cover main body portion 11 forming the front<br>
cover 100 and the front cover main body portion 11 is formed<br>
at the back side thereof with the mount portion 14 for the bracket<br>
10 having the portion 12 passing through the hole 20. Because the<br>
portion 12 passing through the hole has the retaining portion<br>
16 for retaining the plate member (here, the license plate) 30<br>
in front of the front cover main body portion 11, it is possible<br>
to mount the plate member (license plate) 30 in front of the<br>
15 front cover main body portion 11.<br>
With the structure of the embodiment, because the license<br>
plate can be mounted in front of the front cover main body portion<br>
11, it is possible to increase a degree of freedom in design<br>
of the motorcycle 1000.<br>
20 As a concrete example, if a license plate is required at<br>
a front portion of the motorcycle, the license plate 30 need<br>
to be mounted around the front forks 140 positioned between the<br>
headlight 50 and the front fender 180 in FIG. 1. In this case,<br>
because the license plate 30 is mounted between the headlight<br>
25 50 and the front fender 180, a large space is required between<br>
6<br>
 <br>
the headlight 50 and the front fender 180, which restricts<br>
design of the vehicle. With the structure of the embodiment,<br>
the license plate can be mounted in front of the front cover<br>
100 and therefore it is possible to increase a degree of freedom<br>
5 of design of the portion between the front cover 100 and the<br>
front fender 180 including the headlight 50.<br>
Moreover, because the front cover 100 is formed with the<br>
hole 20 passing through the front cover main body portion 11<br>
from the surface 11a to the back face 11b, it is possible to<br>
10 provide a straightening function of the flowing air that blows<br>
against the cover 100. Especially because the recessed portion<br>
19 sandwiched between the ridge lines 17 is formed on the surface<br>
11a of the front cover main body portion 11 and the hole 20 is<br>
formed in part of the recessed portion 19, the flow of the flowing<br>
15 air is facilitated along the recessed portion 19 sandwiched<br>
between the ridge lines 17, which increases the effect of the<br>
straightening function. Furthermore, in the embodiment, the<br>
hole 20 is formed to be wide between the left and right ridge<br>
lines 17, it is possible to reliably obtain the effect of the<br>
20 straightening function.<br>
Although the license plate is mounted as the plate member<br>
30 in the structure of the embodiment, not only the license plate<br>
but also other plate members (e.g., an emblem plate) can be<br>
mounted. Moreover, not only the plate member 30 but also other<br>
25 members (e.g., an emblem) can be mounted.<br>
7<br>
 <br>
Although the invention has been described by way of the<br>
preferred embodiment, such descriptions are not restrictive and<br>
it is needless to say that various changes can be made.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to provide a<br>
5 front fork mount structure including a small number of parts<br>
and a saddle-type vehicle having the structure.<br>
