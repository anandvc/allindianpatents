CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Patent<br>
Application Serial Number 60/952,780, filed July 30, 2007 (the entire content of which is<br>
incorporated by reference herein); and claims the benefit of United States Provisional<br>
Patent Application Serial Number 60/952,765, filed July 30, 2007 (the entire content of<br>
which is incorporated by reference herein).<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001A] The present invention generally relates to automotive power<br>
converters, and more particularly relates to an improved layout for automotive<br>
power converter power modules.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] In recent years, advances in technology, as well as ever-evolving<br>
tastes in style, have led to substantial changes in the design of automobiles.<br>
One of the changes involves the complexity of the electrical systems within<br>
automobiles, particularly alternative fuel vehicles, such as hybrid, electric, and<br>
fuel cell vehicles. Such alternative fuel vehicles typically use one or more<br>
electric motors, perhaps in combination with another actuator, to drive the<br>
wheels. Additionally, such automobiles may also include other motors, as<br>
well as other high voltage components, to operate the other various systems<br>
within the automobile, such as the air conditioner.<br>
[0003] Due to the fact that alternative fuel automobiles typically include<br>
only direct current (DC) power supplies, direct current-to-alternating current<br>
(DC/AC) inverters (or power inverters) are provided to convert the DC power<br>
to alternating current (AC) power, which is generally required by the motors.<br>
Such vehicles, particularly fuel cell vehicles, also often use two separate<br>
voltage sources, such as a battery and a fuel cell, to power the electric motors<br>
that drive the wheels. Thus, power converters, such as direct current-to-direct<br>
current (DC/DC) converters, are typically also provided to manage and<br>
transfer the power from the two voltage sources.<br>
[0004] As the power demands on the electrical systems in alternative fuel<br>
vehicles continue to increase, there is an ever increasing need to maximize the<br>
efficiency and reliability of such systems. Additionally, there is a constant<br>
desire to reduce the space required by the components within the electrical<br>
systems in order to minimize the overall cost and weight of the vehicles.<br><br>
[0005] Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an improved layout for<br>
power inverters and converters. Furthermore, other desirable features and<br>
characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the<br>
subsequent detailed description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction<br>
with the accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and<br>
background.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] An automotive power converter is provided. The automotive<br>
power converter includes a substrate, first and second electronic devices on the<br>
substrate, at least one conductive member coupled to the substrate and having<br>
a first device portion electrically coupled to the first electronic device and a<br>
second device portion electrically coupled to the second electronic device, and<br>
first and second terminals electrically coupled to the at least one conductive<br>
member. When a power supply is coupled to the first and second terminals,<br>
current flows from the first terminal to the first device portion substantially in<br>
a first direction and from the second terminal to the second device portion<br>
substantially in a second direction. The first direction has a first component<br>
and the second direction has a second component opposing the first<br>
component.<br>
[0007] An automotive power inverter is provided. The automotive power<br>
inverter includes a substrate, first and second electronic devices on the<br>
substrate, a bus bar coupled to the substrate and having a first device portion<br>
electrically coupled to the first electronic device and a second device portion<br>
electrically coupled to the second electronic device, and first and second<br>
terminals electrically coupled to the bus bar on opposing sides of the first and<br>
second electronic devices. When a power supply is coupled to the first and<br>
second terminals, current flows from the first terminal to the first device<br>
portion substantially in a first direction and from the second terminal to the<br>
second device portion substantially in a second direction. An angle between<br>
the first and second directions is at least 90 degrees.<br><br>
[0008] An automotive drive system is provided. The automotive drive<br>
system includes an electric motor, a direct current (DC) power supply coupled<br>
to the electric motor, a power inverter coupled to the electric motor and the<br>
DC power supply to receive DC power from the DC power supply and<br>
provided alternating current (AC) power to the electric motor, and a processor<br>
in operable communication with and configured to control the electric motor,<br>
the DC power supply, and the power inverter. The power inverter includes a<br>
substrate, first and second electronic devices on the substrate, at least one<br>
conductive member coupled to the substrate and having a first device portion<br>
electrically coupled to the first electronic device and a second device portion<br>
electrically coupled to the second electronic device, and first and second<br>
terminals electrically coupled to the at least one conductive member. When a<br>
power supply is coupled to the first and second terminals, current flows from<br>
the first terminal to the first device portion substantially in a first direction and<br>
from the second terminal to the second device portion substantially in a second<br>
direction. An angle between the first and second directions is at least 90<br>
degrees.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0016] The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or<br>
implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, and<br>
brief summary, or the following detailed description.<br>
[0017] The following description refers to elements or features being<br>
"connected" or "coupled" together. As used herein, "connected" may refer to<br>
one element/feature being mechanically joined to (or directly communicating<br>
with) another element/feature, and not necessarily directly. Likewise,<br>
"coupled" may refer to one element/feature being directly or indirectly joined<br>
to (or directly or indirectly communicating with) another element/feature, and<br>
not necessarily mechanically. However, it should be understood that although<br>
two elements may be described below, in one embodiment, as being<br>
"connected," in alternative embodiments similar elements may be "coupled,"<br>
and vice versa. Thus, although the schematic diagrams shown herein depict<br>
example arrangements of elements, additional intervening elements, devices,<br>
features, or components may be present in an actual embodiment. It should<br>
also be understood that FIGS. 1-8 are merely illustrative and may not be<br>
drawn to scale.<br>
[0018] FIG. 1 to FIG. 8 illustrate an automotive power converter (or<br>
inverter). The automotive power converter includes a substrate, first and<br>
second electronic devices on the substrate, and at least one conductive member<br>
coupled to the substrate. The conductive member, or bus bar, has a first<br>
device portion electrically coupled to the first electronic device and a second<br>
device portion electrically coupled to the second electronic device. First and<br><br>
second terminals are electrically coupled to the at least one conductive<br>
member. When a power supply is coupled to the first and second terminals,<br>
current flows from the first terminal to the first device portion substantially in<br>
a first direction and from the second terminal to the second device portion<br>
substantially in a second direction. The first direction has a first component<br>
and the second direction has a second component opposing the first<br>
component.<br>
[0019] In one embodiment, the first and second terminals are on opposing<br>
sides of the electronic devices, and the first and second direction have an angle<br>
between them of 180 degrees (i.e., the directions are opposite).<br>
[0020] The layout of the power converter provides a more even<br>
distribution of current flow. As such, the reliability and overall performance<br>
of the power converter is improved.<br>
[0021] FIG. 1 illustrates a vehicle 10, or "automobile," according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The automobile 10 includes a chassis<br>
12, a body 14, four wheels 16, and an electronic control system 18. The body<br>
14 is arranged on the chassis 12 and substantially encloses the other<br>
components of the automobile 10. The body 14 and the chassis 12 may jointly<br>
form a frame. The wheels 16 are each rotationally coupled to the chassis 12<br>
near a respective corner of the body 14.<br>
[0022] The automobile 10 may be any one of a number of different types<br>
of automobiles, such as, for example, a sedan, a wagon, a truck, or a sport<br>
utility vehicle (SUV), and may be two-wheel drive (2WD) (i.e., rear-wheel<br>
drive or front-wheel drive), four-wheel drive (4WD) or all-wheel drive<br>
(AWD). The vehicle 10 may also incorporate any one of, or combination of, a<br>
number of different types of engines, such as, for example, a gasoline or diesel<br>
fueled combustion engine, a "flex fuel vehicle" (FFY) engine (i.e., using a<br>
mixture of gasoline and alcohol), a gaseous compound (e.g., hydrogen and/or<br>
natural gas) fueled engine, a combustion/electric motor hybrid engine, and an<br>
electric motor.<br><br>
[0023] In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the automobile<br>
10 is a hybrid vehicle, and further includes an actuator assembly 20, a battery<br>
22, a power inverter assembly (or inverter) 24, and a radiator 26. The actuator<br>
assembly 20 includes a combustion engine 28 and an electric motor/generator<br>
(or motor) 30. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the electric<br>
motor 30 includes a transmission therein, and although not illustrated also<br>
includes a stator assembly (including conductive coils), a rotor assembly<br>
(including a ferromagnetic core), and a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant). The stator<br>
assembly and/or the rotor assembly within the electric motor 30 may include<br>
multiple electromagnetic poles (e.g., sixteen poles), as is commonly<br>
understood.<br>
[0024] Still referring to FIG. 1, in one embodiment, the combustion engine<br>
28 and the electric motor 30 are integrated such that both are mechanically<br>
coupled to at least some of the wheels 16 through one or more drive shafts 32.<br>
The radiator 26 is connected to the frame at an outer portion thereof and<br>
although not illustrated in detail, includes multiple cooling channels therein<br>
that contain a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant) such as water and/or ethylene glycol<br>
(i.e., "antifreeze) and is coupled to the engine 28 and the inverter 24.<br>
[0025] Referring to FIG. 2, a voltage source inverter system (or electric<br>
drive system) 34 is shown in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The voltage source inverter system 34 includes a<br>
controller 36 coupled to an output of a modulator 38, which in turn has an<br>
input coupled to a first output of the inverter 24. The controller 36 has an<br>
output coupled to an input of the inverter 24, which has a second output<br>
coupled to the motor 30. The controller 36 and the modulator 38 may be<br>
integral with the electronic control system 18 shown in FIG. 1.<br>
[0026] FIG. 3 illustrates the inverter 24 of FIGS. 1 and 2 in greater detail.<br>
The inverter 24 includes a three-phase circuit coupled to the motor 30. More<br>
specifically, the inverter 24 includes a switch network having a first input<br>
coupled to a voltage source Vdc (e.g., the battery 22) and an output coupled to<br><br>
the motor 30. Although a single voltage source is shown, a distributed direct<br>
current (DC) link with two series sources may be used.<br>
[0027] The switch network comprises three pairs (a, b, and c) of series<br>
switches with antiparallel diodes (i.e., antiparallel to each switch)<br>
corresponding to each of the phases of the motor 30. Each of the pairs of<br>
series switches comprises a first switch, or transistor, (i.e., a "high" switch) 40,<br>
42, and 44 having a first terminal coupled to a positive electrode of the voltage<br>
source 22 and a second switch (i.e., a "low" switch) 46, 48, and 50 having a<br>
second terminal coupled to a negative electrode of the voltage source 22 and<br>
having a first terminal coupled to a second terminal of the respective first<br>
switch 40, 42, and 44.<br>
[0028] FIG. 4 and 5 illustrate a power module 52 of the inverter 24<br>
according to one embodiment of the invention. The power module 52<br>
includes a substrate 54 and multiple electronic devices 56 on the substrate 54.<br>
The substrate 54 is substantially rectangular with, for example, a length 58<br>
between 100 and 120 millimeters (mm), a width 60 between 20 and 30 mm,<br>
and a thickness (not shown) of between 1 and 5 mm. The substrate 54 has an<br>
upper surface 62 and a lower surface 64 and, in one embodiment, is a direct<br>
bonded copper (DBC) substrate, as is commonly understood, with a ceramic<br>
core 66 (e.g., alumina or aluminum nitride) and copper layers 68 formed on, or<br>
bonded to, opposing sides (i.e., the upper and lower surfaces 62 and 64) of the<br>
core 66.<br>
[0029] Referring specifically to FIG. 4, the copper layer 68 on the upper<br>
surface 62 is etched to form various conductive members (e.g., bus bars) 70,<br>
72, 74, and 76 substantially extending between opposing ends 78 of the<br>
substrate 54. As shown, DC terminals 80 are connected to bus bars 72 and 76<br>
at the opposing ends 78 of the power module 52, and an alternating current<br>
(AC) terminal 82 is connected to bus bar 70 along one of two opposing sides<br>
84 of the power module 52.<br>
[0030] The electronic devices 56 include two rows of transistor die 86 and<br>
diode die 88 mounted to bus bars 72 and 74, respectively. The transistor die<br><br>
86 each include a semiconductor substrate (e.g., silicon substrate) with an<br>
integrated circuit formed thereon that includes one or more of the switches in<br>
the form of individual semiconductor devices, such as insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors (IGBTs), as is commonly understood.<br>
[0031] Still referring to FIG. 4, the power module also includes a plurality<br>
of wire bonds 90 that interconnect the electronic devices 56 and the bus bars<br>
70, 72, 74, and 76. For illustrative clarity, only some of the wire bonds 90 are<br>
shown in FIG. 4. It should be noted that the electrical connections between<br>
the die 86 and 88 on bus bar 72 and the DC terminals 80 connected to bus bar<br>
72 are made where the die 86 and 88 are connected to bus bar 72 (i.e., device<br>
portions of bus bar 72). However, the electrical connections between the die<br>
86 and 88 on bus bar 74 and the DC terminals connected to bus bar 76 are<br>
made via the wire bonds 90 that connect the die 86 and 88 on bus bar 74 to<br>
device portions 92 of bus bar 76. Thus, the device portions (i.e., the portions<br>
of bus bars 72 and 76) into which DC current flows) are located between the<br>
DC terminals 80 of the respective bus bars 72 and 76.<br>
[0032] In other words, if the bus bars 72 and 76 are considered to be<br>
conductive wires or traces, the DC terminals 80 are connected to the opposing<br>
ends of the traces, and the device portions of the bus bars are connected to the<br>
traces between the opposing ends. As suggested in FIG. 3, the DC terminals<br>
80 are electrically connected to the battery 22 (FIG. 1), while the AC terminal<br>
82 is electrically connected to the motor 30. It should be noted that each of<br>
the electronic devices 56 (e.g., first, second, third, fourth, etc.) may be<br>
considered to have a respective device portion 92 on bus bar 72 or 76.<br>
[0033] FIG. 5 illustrates the lower surface 64 of the power module 52. As<br>
shown, the copper layer 68 on the lower surface 64 is etched only around a<br>
periphery thereof such to form a heat sink or cooling plate that is electrically<br>
disconnected from bus bars 70, 72, 74 and 76 and die 86 and 88. Although not<br>
specifically shown, the lower surface 64 of the power module 52 may be<br>
placed into contact with a cooling device, such as a heat sink, or a cold plate<br><br>
through which a wicking fluid is flown, to remove heat produced during<br>
operation, as is commonly understood in the art.<br>
[0034] Referring again to FIG. 1, in the depicted embodiment, the inverter<br>
24 receives and shares coolant with the electric motor 30. The radiator 26<br>
may be similarly connected to the inverter 24 and/or the electric motor 30.<br>
The electronic control system 18 is in operable communication with the<br>
actuator assembly 20, the battery 22, and the inverter 24. Although not shown<br>
in detail, the electronic control system 18 includes various sensors and<br>
automotive control modules, or electronic control units (ECUs), such as an<br>
inverter control module and a vehicle controller, and at least one processor<br>
and/or a memory which includes instructions stored thereon (or in another<br>
computer-readable medium) for carrying out the processes and methods as<br>
described below. It should also be understood that the electronic control<br>
system 18 may include, or be integral with, portions of the inverter system 24<br>
shown in FIG. 2, such as the controller 36 and the modulator 38.<br>
[0035] During operation, referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the vehicle 10 is<br>
operated by providing power to the wheels 16 with the combustion engine 28<br>
and the electric motor 30 in an alternating manner and/or with the combustion<br>
engine 28 and the electric motor 30 simultaneously. In order to power the<br>
electric motor 30, DC power is provided from the battery 22 (and, in the case<br>
of a fuel cell automobile, a fuel cell) to the inverter 24, which converts the DC<br>
power into AC power, before the power is sent to the electric motor 30. As<br>
will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the conversion of DC power to<br>
AC power is substantially performed by operating (i.e., repeatedly switching)<br>
the transistors 33 within the inverter 24 at a "switching frequency" (Fsw), such<br>
as, for example, 12 kilohertz (kHz). Generally, the controller 36 produces a<br>
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal for controlling the switching action of<br>
the inverter 24. In a preferred embodiment, the controller 36 preferably<br>
produces a discontinuous PWM (DPWM) signal having a single zero vector<br>
associated with each switching cycle of the inverter 24. The inverter 24 then<br><br>
converts the PWM signal to a modulated voltage waveform for operating the<br>
motor 30.<br>
[0036] Referring now to FIGS. 3 and 4, the DC current that is provided to<br>
the inverter 24 flows into the power module 52 at the DC terminals 80 at the<br>
opposing ends 78. The current then flows toward the center of the power<br>
module 52 where it is delivered to the various electronic devices 56. Thus,<br>
DC current is provided to the electronic devices 56, or more specifically, the<br>
device portions 92 of bus bars 72 and 76, from first and second opposing<br>
directions 94 and 96 (as indicated by arrows 94 and 96). That is, directions 94<br>
and 96 have respective first and second components that substantially oppose<br>
each other (e.g., are 180 degrees apart), while the directions 94 and 96<br>
themselves have an angle between them of at least 90 degrees. Although the<br>
arrows 94 and 96 are shown only on bus bar 76, it should be understood that<br>
the current flows from the DC terminals 80 connected to bus bar 72 to the<br>
device portions of bus bar 72 in a similar manner (e.g., in third and fourth<br>
directions that are parallel to the first and second directions, respectively). As<br>
will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the current density within bus bars<br>
72 and 76 is progressively greater near the ends 78 of the power module 52.<br>
[0037] After passing through the various electronic devices 56 and being<br>
converted into AC current, the current flows into bus bar 70 and from the<br>
power module 52 through the AC terminal 82 in a fifth direction 98 (as<br>
indicated by arrows 98) that is substantially perpendicular to the first, second,<br>
third, and fourth directions. The AC current is then provided to the motor 30,<br>
as described above.<br>
[0038] One advantage of the power module described above is that the<br>
current flows through the bus bars into the electronic devices in opposing<br>
directions. Therefore, the current, and thus heat generated by the current, is<br>
more evenly distributed throughout the bus bars. As a result, the performance<br>
and the reliability of the power module are improved.<br>
[0039] Another advantage of the power module is that it allows for greater<br>
flexibility in how multiple power modules are arranged. FIGS. 6, 7, and 8<br><br>
illustrate arrangements of three of the power modules 52 (i.e., one for each<br>
phase) according to various embodiments of the present invention. In the<br>
embodiment shown in FIG. 6, the power modules 52 are in a linear<br>
arrangements with the bus bars 70-76 of aligned in a substantially parallel<br>
fashion. FIGS. 7 and 8 show the power modules 52 arranged in "loop"<br>
configurations around an opening 100. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 7,<br>
the power modules 52 are arranged with the AC terminals 82 on opposing, or<br>
outer, sides of the opening 100, while in FIG. 8, the AC terminals are located<br>
adjacent the opening 100. Although not shown, for packing efficiency, some<br>
of the components of the automobile, such as the electric motor, may be<br>
placed within the opening 100, or at least such that the shaft of the motor<br>
extends through the opening 100.<br>
[0040] Other embodiments may utilize different numbers of power<br>
modules, such as six or eight, arranged in various polygons, such as hexagons<br>
or octagons. Each of the power modules may correspond to an individual<br>
phase of the operation of the motor, or several of the power modules may be<br>
connected in parallel to jointly correspond to a single phase of the operation of<br>
the motor.<br>
