"A MACHINE FOR STERILIZING PLASTIC AND/OR METAL STOPPERING<br>
PARTS FOR BOTTLES"<br>
We, PERRIER VITTEL MANAGEMENT ET TECHNOLOGIE, of 20 rue Rouget de Lisle, F-92130 Issy les Moulineaux, France,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a device for sterilizing plastic and/or metal parts intended for stoppering bottles.<br>
The applicant has set itself the objective of producing a device which is less expensive than those currently used while at the same time considerably extending the sterilization time duration. Another objective is to produce a plant that can be modified at will.<br>
According to the invention, these objectives are achieved by virtue of a machine for sterilizing plastic and/ or metal stoppering parts for bottles, the machine being installed on a bottling line, upstream of the screwing machine and operating at the same rate thereas, the stoppering parts being introduced unsterilized into an inlet at one end of the machine and emerging sterilized through an outlet at the other end of the machine, characterized in that the path followed by the parts between the inlet and the outlet of the machine and within it is a spiral path.<br>

standard sterilizing-rinsing module.<br>
Reference is made first of all to figures 1 to 5 which correspond to a first embodiment of the invention.<br>
A sterilizing device (1) according to the invention is installed on the bottling line, upstream of the screwing machine, and operates at the same rate thereas.<br>
Such a device essentially comprises three successive sections along the same axis: a sterilizing section (2), a rinsing section (3) and a drying zone (4).<br><br><br><br>
In figures 1 to 5 which depict a first non-limiting embodiment of the invention operating horizontally, the invention is made up mainly of a conveying assembly (5) formed of a hollow cylindrical sleeve (6) which can move in rotation around a spiral slideway (7) secured to a stationary drum (8) and wound around the exterior wall thereof. The slideway (7) has a profile in the shape of a U open toward the sleeve.<br>
The sleeve or rotary drum (6) and the stationary drum (8) are coaxial.<br>
The spiral slideway (7) is extended at one end of the stationary drum (8) by an inclined straight part forming an inlet slideway (9) in which all the unsterilized stoppering parts (11) are oriented in the same direction and drop down toward the bottom to enter the conveying assembly.<br>
The spiral slideway is extended at its other end by a straight part, also inclined, forming an outlet slideway (10) so as to direct downward the stoppering parts (11) all oriented in the same direction as in the inlet slideway (9).<br>
The slideway (7) is appreciably shorter in height (see figures 9, 11) than the stoppering parts so as to let them protrude. The friction between the rotary drum (6) and the stoppering parts ('11) causes the latter to move in the spiral slideway (7), driving them toward the exit slideway (10).<br>
The interior surface of the rotary drum (6) may, for example, be smooth or striated with grooves parallel to the axis of rotation, or striated with grooves in a spiral parallel to the axis (12) of the stationary spiral slideway (7) (see figure 12).<br><br><br><br>
Thanks to this internal conveying assembly (5), the path of a stoppering part (11) is considerably lengthened by comparison with the length of the stationary drum.<br>
By way of example, a stoppering part (11) covers 35 m for a sleeve length of 1 m.<br>
In the sterilizing section (see figures 2 and 4), the bottom (13) of the spiral screw (1) comprises a great many holes (14) through which a great many nozzles (15), situated inside the stationary drum (8) and preferably in its upper part, inject a liquid and/or gaseous ar.d/or hot sterilizing solution.<br>
As a preference, the holes (14) are not directed radially but are directed in a direction which is inclined, for example by an angle a = from 10 to 20°, with respect tc a radius of the drum. The jets (16) of sterilizing solution thus play a part in moving the stoppering parts (11).<br>
As a preference, as in figure 5, the sterilizing liquid is collected at the lower part of the stationary drum (8), in a suction cavity (17) which is offset with respect tc the vertical plane of symmetry of the drum, the liquid being offset by the rotating of the rotary drum (6).<br>
To prevent the liquid from running over the	ends of the<br>
rotary drum, arrangements are made, a few	alternative<br>
forms of which are described hereinbelow by	way of non-<br>
limiting examples:<br>
the rotary drum (6) (figures 13, 14a and 14b) may have rigid circular returns (18) at each end, the height of which exceeds the level (12) of liquid to be held back. In this case, the inlet slideway<br><br><br><br>
-X-<br>
(19) will need to be elbowed at  (19)  to pass<br>
around the return (18);<br>
if the returns (18) are made of elastomer or some<br>
other flexible material, a separating finger (21)<br>
may be provided in line with the arrival of the<br>
inlet slideway (9) (see figure 17);<br>
the entire rotary drum (6) assembly (figure 15)<br>
may be immersed in a tank (20);<br>
the entire drum assembly may be inclined and one<br>
of its ends may be immersed in a tank (20) (figure<br>
16) ;<br>
the radius of gyration of the spiral slideway (7)<br>
may also be varied in line with the inlet and the<br>
outlet of the rotary drum (figure 18).<br>
Having been sucked up by a pipe (18a) (see figure 1), the sterilizing liquid is filtered in filtration means (22)  then  reheated  by  heating  means  (23),  then<br>
recycled.<br>
The rinsing (3) and drying (4) sections each have a conveying means constructed on the same principle as the one in the sterilizing section.<br>
The transitions between sections may be accomplished by arrangements of the spiral slideway:<br>
by varying the pitch diameter of the spiral slideway (7) which in this case is a one-piece construction (see sketch at figure 19a); by varying the pitch diameter and increasing the pitch (in order not to reduce the radius of gyration) , in this case the slideway is visible (see sketch at figure 19b).<br>
The supporting structure and the mechanical drive means (motor (30), rollers (31), etc.) are within the competence of the person skilled in the art.<br><br><br>
-\o-<br><br><br>
-X-<br>
A second embodiment is given by way of non-limiting example in figures 6 to 11.<br>
This one differs from the first embodiment essentially in the form of the support structure (24) and the transition between two sections by increasing the pitch of the spiral slideway.<br>
It also comprises inspection hatches (25) which may of course also be provided on the first embodiment.<br>
The sterilizing solution is injected by a nozzle (15) into a pressure-equalizing chamber  (26)  formed by a wall (27) parallel to that of the stationary drum (8) (figure 9).<br>
Figure 11 shows, viewed in section on BB of figure 9, stoppering parts in two successive loops of the slideway.<br>
These embodiments may be modified for sterilizing "sports" stoppers which have a central cap (29) projecting from the lid.<br>
In this case, (figures 20a and 20b), straight grooves or channels parallel to the axis of rotation (28) and in which the central cap of the parts slides are provided on the interior face of the rotary drum (6).<br>
Reference is now made to figures 21 to 23 of a third embodiment of the invention. This is depicted operating vertically, from top to bottom, but the direction of operation could be reversed and provision could also be made for it to be made to operate horizontally in one direction or the other.<br>
In this embodiment, the parts are set in motion by a driving fluid injected into the machine, their path between the inlet E and the outlet S of the machine<br><br>
— V\-<br><br><br>
remaining a spiral path. The driving fluid is, for example, filtered air injected under pressure or blown in by a fan.<br>
The stoppering parts travel in a conveying system (5) formed of a hollow and stationary cylindrical sleeve<br>
(101)	coaxial with a stationary drum (102) forming a<br>
support for a conveying spiral slideway (107) arranged<br>
in the space between the sleeve  (101)  and the drum<br>
(102)	.<br>
The hollow cylindrical sleeve (101) surrounds a spiral slideway secured to a stationary drum and wound on the exterior wall thereof, the sole (103) of the slideway having openings for injecting the driving fluid.<br>
Ey way of a non-limiting example, the figures depict a spiral slideway produced using a profiled separation<br>
■101 a) positioned and welded into a spiral groove made cr. the exterior surface of the stationary drum (102)<br>
(figure 22a).<br>
The bottom of the slideway, known as the sliding sole !I03), is made in the form of a flexible metal strip wound in a spiral between the separations (107a) and held by tension at its two ends, its two edges resting or. two shoulders (107b) provided on each side of the separation (107a) (figure 22a).<br>
As a preference, the plant is modular as in figures 21 and 22, that is to say that the sterilizing (108), rinsing (109) and drying (110) sections are modules of identical design assembled in series by fastening means (104) and closed at both ends by an inlet wall and by an outlet wall (111, 112).<br>
Use is preferably made of a single sliding sole for all of the modules.<br><br><br><br>
These modules differ according to their function in terms of the fluid conveyed therein.<br>
Depending on whether a module is used as a sterilizing section, a washing section or a drying section, tubes<br>
(106 or 106') internal to the drum (102) and parallel to its longitudinal axis bring in sterilizing fluid or driving fluid  (for example liquid through the tube<br>
(106) and sterile air through the tube (106')).<br>
The fluid is, for example, injected into the pressure chamber (105) by nozzles (114) the delivery of which can be adjusted by virtue of adjusting means (114b) and which pass through the drum (102) via rectangular slits (114a). From one to four nozzles per turn may be provided (figures 21, 22, 22a and 22b).<br>
The fluid then passes through the sliding sole through openings (113) (the geometry of which is, for example, triangular (113a; or trapezoidal (113b) and known from the prior art; which direct the jet of fluid in the direction of travel of the stopping parts (figure 22a).<br>
One (or more) suction slits (116) (figure 22a), preferably inclined (for example at 45°), is or are provided at the outlet end of each module and on its stationary sleeve (101) to encourage the driving fluid to be sucked up into an annular manifold (115a) (figures 22a and 21) by virtue of a suction means (117) . This fluid will then go off to be recycled in a fluid/air separator (119) (figure 21).<br>
A hopper (120, 120') for collecting parasitic rejections of fluids inside the drums is provided at the outlet of each module (figure 21). These rejections are carried by concentric tubes (121, 121') as far as a filter (122) which also collects the fluid leaving a tube (123) of the separator (119) (figure 21).<br><br><br><br>
V*5--<br>
The  fluid  from  the	filter  (122)  is  pumped  by  a<br>
recycling pump (124),	taken to a reservoir (125) then<br>
recycled by an inlet	pump (126) into the inlet tube<br>
(106) .<br>
A modular plant has many advantages.<br>
In particular, it allows an existing plant to be modified (for example by adding modules if the sterilizing is insufficient), or makes it possible, using standard elements, to produce plant tailored to -.oca! means, or allows a process to be modified.<br>

Reference is now made to figures 24 to 3C of a fourth embodiment of the invention.<br>
Figure 26 diagrammatically shows the installation of a sterilizing-rinsing device (201) according to the invention in a sterilizing plant (202) situated upstream of a bottling line (203).<br>
In the plant (202), the stoppering parts (213) from a magazine (204) which orients them and distributes them, are  conveyed  by  an  inlet  slideway  (214)  to  a<br><br><br><br>
sterilizing-rinsing device (201) in which they travel in a spiral path (215) under the effect of a driving fluid, then leave via an outlet slideway (216) fitted with a regulator (205) determining the outlet speed of the stoppering parts (213) according to the rate needed for the bottling line (203) , the casing of a charging machine (203a) and of a screwing machine (203b) of which can be glimpsed.<br>
Figures 26 and 27 depict only the main components of the sterilizing liquid circuit: reservoir (206), pump (207), filters (208), the inlet (209) of liquid into the device (201) splitting into a number of injection pipes (210), for example three, each supplying a liquid-injection nozzle (211a, 211b, 211c).<br>
Of the compressea air circuit, only the locations of the air injection nozzles (212a, 212b) have been depicted.<br>
A sterilizing-rinsing device (201) according to this fourth embodiment is manufactured in the form of a standard module that meets predetermined standard sterilization criteria, said standard module being depicted schematically in figures 24 and 26.<br>
The spiral path comprises, for example, although this is not limiting, six contiguous turns, the upper part of the last turn (or rear turn) of which carries out the function of rinsing with air, the previous turns (or front turns) performing the sterilizing function using a sterilizing liquid injected through a number of liquid-injection nozzles, of which there are for example three (211a, 211b, 211c) per turn.<br>
The U-shaped slideway which forms the spiral path (215) may be produced according to the techniques already described for the third embodiment.<br><br><br><br>
As in the previous embodiment, the stoppering parts are conveyed through the standard module (201) between a stationary cylindrical sleeve (217) forming the outer envelope, a stationary sole (or bottom) (218) of the slideway, and two separating walls (219).<br>
Within this path, the stoppering parts are set in motion by the sterilizing liquid under pressure which also acts as a driving fluid.<br>
For this, the nozzles are distributed uniformly over each turn and oriented at a driving angle (p) as shown by figure 29 which corresponds to a detail view of one cf the front turns.<br>
The driving angle ((3) is preferably measured tangentially to the sole of the turns.<br>
Crifices (220a, 220b, 220c) are provided in the sole of the turns for the passage of the nozzles (211a, 211b, 211c) .<br>
As a preference, one of the orifices (220c) is provided in the bottom part of each turn, on the vertical and longitudinal plane (221) of the module.<br>
A cylinder (222a) coaxial with the cylindrical stationary sleeve (217) delimits, with the collection of the bottoms of the turns (218), a cylindrical discharge space (222) .<br>
Excess sterilizing liquid is discharged through the two upper orifices (220a, 220b) of each turn, flows into the cylindrical space (222), passes through the bottom orifices (220c) of the front turns, then the discharge holes (223) provided in the bottom of the outer cylindrical sleeve (217) to then be collected in a discharge tank (225) .<br><br><br><br><br>
The discharge holes (223) (see figure 30) are preferably oblong in shape, their longitudinal axis being placed at right angles to the vertical longitudinal plane (221) of the module and on the axes of the separations (219) so that the liquid is discharged through the more or less triangular gaps (224) which lie on each side of the separations (219) of the slideway between the stoppering parts (213) .<br>
Reference is now made to figure 31 which shows the rinsing with air performed more or less in half or one third of the upper part of the last turn.<br>
An inlet of pressurized air (223), situated inside the module (201), distributes air under pressure to a first<br>
(or several) air-injection nozzle(s) (212a) directing the air in the direction in which the stoppering parts<br>
(213) move so as to take over, by way of driving fluid, from the sterilizing liquid which performs this function in the bottom part of the turn and which has been discharged.<br>
The air inlet (223) also distributes air to a second (or several) air-injection nozzle (s) (212b) situated toward the top of the last turn and directing air toward the inside cf the stoppering parts which travel past it so as tc rinse their insides, one after the other.<br>
The outsides of the stoppering parts (213) are rinsed by one or more nozzles (212c) situated externally to the cylindrical sleeve (217) .<br>
In the upper part of the last turn performing rinsing, the stoppering parts are driven by the air, then rinsed on the inside and on the outside (or vice versa) to arrive already partly dried in the outlet slideway which directs them toward a dryer (not depicted) which will complete the drying thereof.<br><br><br>
-V\-<br><br><br>
In order to regulate the exit speed of the stoppering parts (213) , the regulator (205) may, for example, be made up of a star-shaped rotary component (226) driven by a geared motor (227) .<br><br>
