				<td>Method of moving the rotating means of a wind turbine during<br>
transportation or stand still; nacelle, auxiliary device,<br>
Control and monitoring system<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The invention relates to methods of moving the rotating means of a wind turbine<br>
during transportation or stand still, a method of controlling the moving of the rotating<br>
means, a nacelle, an auxiliary device, a control and monitoring system.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
In recent years the size of wind turbines has increased significantly which has<br>
resulted in still larger, heavier and more complex wind turbine components.<br>
Especially, components of the nacelle together with the wind turbine rotor have<br>
increased both in size, weight and in complexity. In order to meet the increased size<br>
and weight of the nacelle components as well as the increased size of the rotor, the<br>
nacelle has also increased in size and weight.<br>
The increased size and complexity of different components in the wind turbines, such<br>
as the nacelle and the wind turbine rotor, have resulted in production at large and<br>
specialized production plants. The plants are often positioned in a rather few central<br>
locations around the world and thus relaying on transporting many of the different<br>
components in wind turbines over long distances to the places of erection. The<br>
transportation of wind turbine components may primarily involve trains or ships.<br>
Further, the transportation may include large trucks and combinations of trains, ships<br>
and trucks.<br>
The transportation of the nacelle of a wind turbine over long distances involves<br>
problems as the nacelle includes a number of components with rotating means. The<br>
components are especially the gear but also the one or more generators which all<br>
have shafts, rotating during normal use of the wind turbine in a number of bearings<br>
and engaging with toothed wheels of the gear. During the long transportation the<br>
protective oil films that separates the rotating means from the bearing and toothed<br>
wheels from each other may be ruptured or vanish due to vibrations and the weight<br>
of the shafts, resulting in damage to the shafts, the bearings or the toothed wheels.<br>
Especially continuous low frequency vibrations such as vibrations from a ship engine<br>
are harmful to the components in question.<br>
The damage is often quite small in size e.g. less than 1/1000 millimeter and thus not<br>
visible to the human eye but may result in a reduced lifespan for the components.<br>
In order to avoid the problem, the rotating means may be equipped with<br>
transportation furnishings at the shaft ends. The furnishings allow the shafts to be<br>
held in a position in which the weight is not transferred to the bearings. The<br>
furnishings are however less useful in connection with the gear and especially the<br>
toothed wheels due to the structural nature of the gear.<br>
Further, furnishings are difficult and time consuming to position correctly in a<br>
nacelle before the transportation starts.<br>
An object of the invention is to establish methods and system for wind turbines<br>
without the above-mentioned disadvantage and especially without the rupturing or<br>
vanishing of the oil film in rotating means of a wind turbine such as gears and<br>
generators.<br>
A further object of the invention is to establish control systems for monitoring and<br>
optimising the established methods and system for wind turbines.<br>
The invention<br>
The invention relates to a method of moving the rotating means of a wind turbine<br>
during transportation, said method comprising the steps of:<br>
securing at least one auxiliary device to a fixed position in relation to said rotating<br>
means,<br>
connecting said at least one auxiliary device to the rotating means at the<br>
transportation, said least one auxiliary device being able to store, generate and/or<br>
convert energy during transportation,<br>
transferring energy from said at least one auxiliary device to said one or more shafts<br>
of the rotating means during transportation, and<br>
moving said one or more shafts of the rotating means continuously or<br>
discontinuously from a position to another.<br>
Hereby it is possible to protect the rotating means during longer periods of stand still<br>
before the erection of the wind turbine e.g. during transportation. It is possible to<br>
eliminate stand still marks on the rotating means of a wind turbine as the rupturing or<br>
vanishing of the oil film is avoided. In particular, microscopic stand still marks can<br>
be avoided on the toothed wheel of the gear and the generator bearings, and the<br>
potential lifetime of the rotating means are thus significantly improved.<br>
The term "rotating means" is to be understood as means of a wind turbine which<br>
under normal use is part of the components in the nacelle such as the gear and the<br>
generator. The rotating means may, among the nacelle components, be gear and<br>
generator which comprise rotating shafts, bearings and toothed wheels.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said rotating means is included in a nacelle of a wind<br>
turbine or in a transportation frame construction.<br>
It shall be emphasised that the transportation may be of the nacelle including the<br>
rotating means and the auxiliary device or the rotating means and the auxiliary<br>
device alone e.g. the transportation of a gear or a generator of a wind turbine and the<br>
auxiliary device in transportation frame construction. The construction may in a<br>
simple version be the necessary means for securing the gear or a generator to the<br>
platform of the transportation means and protecting the gear or a generator against<br>
the weather conditions e.g. a tarpaulin covering the gear and the generator. The<br>
version may further include means for ensuring that the auxiliary device and the<br>
rotating means are not entangled in the tarpaulin or the like in which the means may<br>
e.g. be brackets or rods. In more advanced versions the tarpaulin may be replaced<br>
with more solid wall structures.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, said auxiliary device is connected to one or more<br>
shafts such as the high-speed shaft at the gear and/or the generator. Hereby it is<br>
possible to change the position e.g. of the toothed wheels or bearings of gears or<br>
generators, and thus avoid the rupture or vanish of an oil film.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, the moving of said one or more shafts are turned<br>
at a very low turning speed such as less than one full turn per week e.g. between 1<br>
and 20 degrees per day. The low turning speed ensures that the needed power for the<br>
turning is reduced significantly compared to the normal "high speed". The turning<br>
speed will be significantly enough to ensure that metal surfaces will not penetrate the<br>
oil film and touch each other.<br>
In an even further aspect of the invention, the moving of said rotating means is<br>
discontinuous e.g. between 30 seconds and 20 minutes of movement every period<br>
such as 1 minute movement every 3 hours. Hereby it is possible to reduce the needed<br>
power for the turning to a minimum and thus ensure that the energy storage may be<br>
kept compact or last longer.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the moving of said one or more shafts of the<br>
rotating means is combined with oil lubrication at said rotating means. The use of oil<br>
lubrication during the turning or moving process further reduces the necessary<br>
turning speed as the oil film continuously is strengthened. Hereby a certain rupture or<br>
vanish of the oil film in rotating means can be accepted without the metal surfaces<br>
touching each other and thus stand still marks occur.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, said transportation is performed with<br>
transportation means such as trucks, trains or ships. The invention is especially<br>
relevant to transportations over a longer time period that normally introduces the<br>
possibility of dangerously long stand stills.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, said auxiliary device is connected to one or more<br>
energy generating systems of said transportation means such as the electric<br>
generators, pneumatic or hydraulic pumps. By using the energy generating systems<br>
of the transportation means, it is possible to ensure a reliable power supply to the<br>
auxiliary device. The energy generating systems may be prepared for the connection<br>
e.g. by establishing power outlets at the transportation platform for the rotating<br>
means.<br>
Further, the invention relates to a method of moving the rotating means of a wind<br>
turbine during stand still, said method comprising the steps of:<br>
at least one auxiliary device being secured to a fixed position in relation to said<br>
rotating means and connected to the rotating means, said at least one auxiliary device<br>
being able to store, generate and/or convert energy during stand still,<br>
transferring energy from said at least one auxiliary device to said one or more shafts<br>
of the rotating means during stand still, and<br>
moving said one or more shafts of the rotating means continuously or<br>
discontinuously from a position to another.<br>
Hereby it is further possible to protect the rotating means during periods of stand still<br>
e.g. longer periods in storage facilities.<br>
The invention also relates to a method of controlling the moving of the rotating<br>
means of a wind turbine during transportation or stand still, said method includes<br>
control and monitoring system including an algorithm, said system comprising inputs<br>
signal from one or more of sensors,<br>
controlling at least one auxiliary device with output signals of said control and<br>
monitoring system in order to move the rotating means of the wind turbine during<br>
transportation or stand still,<br>
wherein said output signal is derived from said input signals and/or time signals.<br>
Hereby it is possible to protect the rotating means of the wind turbine from potential<br>
damage during transportation or stand still. The potential lifetime of the rotating<br>
means may thus be significantly improved, especially as the algorithm may use the<br>
input and/or time signals in order to create an output signal controlling said at least<br>
one auxiliary device in a preferred and advanced manner.<br>
Even further, the invention relates to a nacelle for a wind turbine defining an<br>
enclosed space, said nacelle comprising<br>
rotating means such as gear and/or generators including one or more shafts, and<br>
at least one auxiliary device being secured to a fixed position in the nacelle with<br>
securing means and connected to said rotation means with connection means,<br>
wherein said auxiliary device moves the rotating means of the wind turbine nacelle<br>
during transportation or stand still of said wind turbine nacelle.<br>
Hereby it is possible to protect the rotating means of the nacelle from potential<br>
damage during transportation or stand still. The potential lifetime of the rotating<br>
means may thus be significantly improved.<br>
In an embodiment, said connection means is a belt arrangement including a belt, belt<br>
pulleys at said one or more shafts, at least one bracket secured to a position in the<br>
nacelle and a belt pulley of said at least one auxiliary device. Hereby a reliable and<br>
simple movement transfer from the auxiliary device to the one or more shafts is<br>
established. The auxiliary device with the bracket is preferably positioned just above<br>
the one or more shafts, e.g. at the frame of the rotating means, allowing the length of<br>
the belt to be as small as possible.<br>
In another embodiment, the gear and/or the generator belt pulleys have different sizes<br>
in relation to belt pulley of said at least one auxiliary device e.g. being significantly<br>
larger in diameter. By the difference in pulley size a gearing between the auxiliary<br>
device and the shaft is achieved, ensuring that an advantageous relation in turning<br>
speeds of the two may be chosen.<br>
In another embodiment, said connection means is a cardan coupling system flexibly<br>
connecting the high-speed shaft ends of the gear and/or the generator with said at<br>
least one auxiliary device. With the use of a cardan coupling, a multifaceted<br>
movement transfer is possible e.g. with the movement of the gear and generator with<br>
one auxiliary device. Further, the positioning of the auxiliary device is less restricted<br>
with a cardan coupling compared to a belt arrangement.<br>
In a further embodiment, said cardan shaft system includes gearing means in the<br>
connection between the shafts and said at least one auxiliary device. With the gearing<br>
an advantageous relation in turning speeds of the auxiliary device and the shaft may<br>
be chosen.<br>
In a further embodiment, the rotation means is mounted on the nacelle with flexible<br>
rubber bushings. The rubber bushings may preferably be introduced between the<br>
rotating means, such as the gear or generator, and the nacelle floor and thus reduce<br>
the transfer of vibrations to the gear or generator. With the reduction of vibrations the<br>
necessary movement of the rotating means may also be reduced, allowing the size of<br>
the auxiliary device including power supply to be diminished e.g. allowing a smaller<br>
model or type of an auxiliary device to be chosen.<br>
The invention also relates to an auxiliary device for moving the rotating means of a<br>
wind turbine during transportation or stand still of said wind turbine, said device<br>
comprising<br>
securing means for securing the auxiliary device to a fixed position in relation to said<br>
rotating means,<br>
connection means for connecting the auxiliary device to the rotating means<br>
converting means for converting an internal or external energy source to mechanical<br>
force, and<br>
means for continuously or discontinuously transferring the mechanical force to the<br>
rotating means through said connection to the rotating means.<br>
Hereby it is possible to protect the rotating means from potential damage during<br>
transportation or stand still. The potential lifetime of the rotating means may thus be<br>
significantly improved.<br>
The invention also relates to a control and monitoring system for controlling the<br>
moving of the rotating means of a wind turbine with at least one auxiliary device<br>
during transportation or stand still, said system comprising<br>
input signals from one or more sensors,<br>
at least one time signal generator, and<br>
one or more algorithms<br>
where said at least one auxiliary device is controlled with output signals from said<br>
one or more algorithms in order to move the rotating means of the wind turbine<br>
during transportation or stand still, said output signal being derived from said input<br>
signals.<br>
Hereby it is possible to monitor, improve and optimise the functionality of the<br>
auxiliary device and the moving of the rotating means of a wind turbine e.g. in<br>
relation to the power supply.<br>
Lastly the invention relates to the use of an auxiliary device and/or control and<br>
monitoring system as a unit for supplementary connection to one or more shafts of<br>
rotating means in a wind turbine at transportation or other types of stand still.<br>
With the supplementary connection it is possible to use the auxiliary device as a<br>
device connected with the rotating means when needed and remove it when not<br>
needed. The auxiliary device is thus an extra unit supplementary connected to the<br>
existing means of a wind turbine such as the rotating means of a wind turbine<br>
nacelle.<br>

fig. 9                              illustrates a further preferred embodiment of a nacelle<br>
including an auxiliary device.<br>
Detailed description<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a modern wind turbine 1 with a tower 2 and a wind turbine nacelle 3<br>
positioned on top of the tower. The wind turbine rotor 5, comprising three wind<br>
turbine blades, is connected to the nacelle through the low speed shaft which extends<br>
out of the nacelle front.<br>
As illustrated in the figure, wind beyond a certain level will activate the rotor due to<br>
the lift induced on the blades and allow it to rotate in a perpendicular direction to the<br>
wind. The rotation movement is converted to electric power, which is usually<br>
supplied to the transmission grid as known by skilled persons within the area.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a common used method of transporting a wind turbine nacelle 3<br>
from a production plant to a place of erection for a wind turbine.<br>
The truck 6 is loaded with the nacelle at the production plant and at the erection<br>
place a crane lifts the nacelle and positions it on top of the previously erected tower.<br>
The truck transportation can be the end of a long nacelle transportation that also may<br>
involve train and/or ship voyages as well as one or more intermediate positions of<br>
storage.<br>
The transportation of the nacelle may also end with a ship voyage to an offshore<br>
erection place in which the nacelle is lifted to the tower top from the ship storage<br>
facilities.<br>
Other transportation means for the nacelle is also possible such as air transportation<br>
but less practical e.g. due to transportation costs.<br>
Beside transportation of nacelles to the erection places for the wind turbine,<br>
transportation may also be of components in the nacelle e.g. to the production plant<br>
of wind turbines. Examples of components may be the gear and generators being<br>
transported to the production plant with transportation means.<br>
During transportation every component is integrated in a transportation frame<br>
construction ensuring a secure connection to the transportation means and protecting<br>
the component e.g. against rough weather conditions and the like.<br>
During transportation of the components, in the nacelle or alone, the different<br>
components face vibrations and a continuous down force.<br>
Fig. 3a illustrates a section of a toothed wheel in a gear in which the consequences of<br>
vibrations and a continuous down force at the same position is illustrated.<br>
The first toothed wheel 7 is forced against the second toothed wheel 8 at few<br>
positions during the stand still. At the positions are generated stand still marks 9 in<br>
the toothed wheels. Further, it is illustrated how the oil film 10 is collected at the<br>
lower positions<br>
Fig. 3b illustrates a section of a bearing e.g. in a gear in which the consequences of<br>
vibrations and a continuous down force at the same position is illustrated.<br>
The inner ring of the bearing 12 is forced against the bearing roller 11 which again is<br>
forced against the outer ring 13 making stand still marks 9a, 9b in the rings and the<br>
roller as the oil film 10 is forced away.<br>
Further, the stand still marks 9b may occur solely due to vibrations of the bearing<br>
roller 11 which little by little deteriorating the oil film.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates schematically a first embodiment of a nacelle according to the<br>
invention and during transportation.<br>
The nacelle comprises a number of components including the gear 17 connected to<br>
the low speed shaft 19 at one end and the high-speed shaft 16 at another. Further, it is<br>
illustrated that the high-speed shaft is ready for the normal use connection to the<br>
electric generators 21.<br>
The gear 17 also comprises a connection to an oil lubrication system 20, supplying<br>
oil lubrication in the gear. The lubrication system may be a splashed or forced<br>
lubrication system. Further, the system may be a combination of the two types of<br>
lubrication systems. The oil lubrication system also comprises necessary components<br>
such as lubrication reservoirs, oil heater and cooler, one or more pumps and oil<br>
filters.<br>
The supplied oil creates an oil film at the contact surfaces of the gear during normal<br>
rotating use and protects and separates the metal surfaces from each other.<br>
The oil lubrication system preferably comprises an electric pump capable of pumping<br>
the oil into the gear. The electric pump may be powered from the auxiliary device<br>
during transportation or from its own electric power supply such as electric<br>
accumulators.<br>
Further, the pump may in another embodiment be driven by a mechanical force<br>
instead of an electric power supply.<br>
During normal use the electric pump may be a part of the oil lubrication system<br>
facilitating the oil pumping alone or together with one or more other pumps.<br>
Further, the electric pump may be solely for transportation use, allowing the pump to<br>
be adapted to the special conditions of transportation including the possibility of a<br>
limited power supply.<br>
The frame of the auxiliary device 14 is directly or indirectly fixed to the nacelle, e.g.<br>
with securing means 18, and the drive shaft of the device is connected to the high-<br>
speed shaft 16 at the gear 17 through a connection 15.<br>
The connection 15 may be any type of connection allowing transmission of force<br>
from the auxiliary device 14 to the shaft e.g. a belt or chain connection.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates schematically a second embodiment of a nacelle according to the<br>
invention and during transportation.<br>
The embodiment includes an auxiliary device 14 mounted directly to or on the high-<br>
speed shaft of the gear.<br>
The auxiliary device 14 further comprises a direct or indirect connection to the<br>
interior of the nacelle 3 in order to fixate the auxiliary device to the nacelle at the<br>
rotation of the shaft. The connection may be achieved e.g. by a furnishing fixating<br>
the frame of the auxiliary device to the frame of the gear or the inner surface of the<br>
nacelle.<br>
In general the auxiliary device is to be seen as a separate and compact unit that is<br>
positioned in the nacelle and connected to the high-speed shaft and oil pump at the<br>
voyage start. After the arrival at erection place the auxiliary device is removed from<br>
the nacelle in order to be used again at other nacelle transportations.<br>
However, the auxiliary device or parts of the device may also be an integrated part of<br>
the nacelle used only during transportation or situations in which the gear of the<br>
nacelle is not moved for a considerable period of time.<br>
The actuation may be a continuous actuation of the high-speed shaft or an actuation<br>
in which the force is released discontinuously.<br>
The high-speed shaft is actuated due to the higher gearing compared with the low<br>
speed shaft making it easier to move the high-speed shaft.<br>
The auxiliary device may be chosen among a number of system solutions such as:<br>
a)  a motor that is supplied with electric power from an internal or external electric<br>
power source in relation to the nacelle.<br>
The electric power may preferably also supply the electric pump capable of pumping<br>
oil into the gear.<br>
b)  an engine that uses a variety of non electrical fuels such as thesel, gasoline or<br>
other fossil fuels. Further, the motor may be fuelled by a chemical conversion<br>
involving hydrogen, oxygen or similar highly active fluids. The different fuels may<br>
be supplied from internal or external storages in compressed or not compressed form.<br>
The fumes from the combustion of fossil fuels are guided in tubes to an exterior<br>
opening in the nacelle or further away if necessary.<br>
 The motor may also drive an electric generator in order to supply both mechanical<br>
and electric power. In an embodiment the motor and generator combination can be a<br>
standard thesel or gasoline generator which will be familiar to the skilled person.<br>
Further, the motor and generator combination may in a preferred embodiment be<br>
used solely to supply electric power e.g. to an electric motor as described in a). In<br>
this embodiment the motor and generator combination may be positioned outside the<br>
nacelle with a cable connection to the electric motor positioned in proximity of the<br>
high-speed shaft.<br>
c) a mechanical energy generator. The generator may involve a number of different<br>
solutions such as helical or leaf springs or torsion bars. The springs or torsion bars<br>
are compressed or in other ways tensioned at the voyage start in order to establish<br>
enough force to perform a controlled mechanical actuation of the high-speed shaft.<br>
The mechanical energy generators may be combined with electric power supplied<br>
from electric accumulators, solar cells or the like e.g. in order to drive the electric<br>
pump. The pump may however also be driven by mechanical force supplied from the<br>
mechanical energy generators instead of using electric power.<br>
d) other examples of mechanical energy generators. The generators may involve<br>
pneumatic or hydraulic systems supplied with compressed air or hydraulic oil,<br>
respectively.<br>
The mechanical energy generators may be combined with a separate electric power<br>
supply as described above or drive their own electric generator in order to generate<br>
electric power.<br>
The above mentioned energy sources are examples of internal (positioned inside the<br>
nacelle or a transportation frame) or external (positioned outside the nacelle or a<br>
transportation frame and supplied to the nacelle or a transportation frame) energy<br>
sources. The energy of the energy sources are converted by converting means to<br>
mechanical force in which the force is transferred e.g. to the rotating means. The<br>
converting means may e.g. be seen as motors, engines etc. as described above and<br>
below.<br>
Combinations of the abovementioned system solutions are also possible e.g. in order<br>
to establish a redundant energy system in case of failure, low power or power loss of<br>
the primary energy system. The redundant energy system may comprise electric<br>
accumulators, pneumatic or hydraulic storages, and solar cells such as movable<br>
carpets of solar cells.<br>
The auxiliary device of a) may preferably be supplied with electric power via a<br>
connection to the energy systems of the transportation means e.g. the electric<br>
generator of a truck,  train  or  ship.  The transportation  means  may  comprise<br>
specialized facilities at the nacelle proximity such as electricity distribution boxes in<br>
order to facilitate an easy connection between the energy systems and the nacelle.<br>
The hydraulic system of d) may preferably be supplied from the hydraulic pump<br>
system of the transporting truck, train or ship. The necessary compressed air may be<br>
supplied from the truck, train or ship or from one or more container tanks in or<br>
outside the nacelle e.g. next to the electric accumulators if accumulators are being<br>
used by the systems.<br>
The solar cells may preferably be positioned on one or more of the upper surfaces of<br>
the nacelle or as separate, movable carpets.<br>
The auxiliary device preferably comprises a control and monitoring system which<br>
manages the auxiliary device during the transportation.<br>
The control and monitoring system may control the auxiliary device to move the<br>
high-speed shaft and the oil pump continuously or discontinuously by using an<br>
algorithm comprising different input parameters such as shaft turning speed,<br>
vibrations, oil film condition and energy levels. Further, different temperature and<br>
pressure inputs such as outside air temperature, temperature in the nacelle, the gear<br>
and generator bearing temperature, oil temperature and oil pressure may be obtained<br>
and used in controlling the auxiliary device optimally.<br>
The oil pump may be synchronized with the normal working periods of the auxiliary<br>
device and thus create a lubrication supply when the gear and/or generator is moved<br>
but the pump may also work partly independently of the movement e.g. periodically<br>
forcing oil in between the toothed wheels of the gear while they are not moving.<br>
The turning speed of the gear and generator is preferably very low such as a few<br>
degrees every day e.g. between 1 and 20 degrees resulting in less than a full rotation<br>
every week which is sufficient enough to avoid oil film rupture and stand still marks<br>
in the toothed wheels, bearings and the like. If the power supply to the auxiliary<br>
device is relatively unlimited a higher rotation speed may be chosen e.g. if the<br>
transport road is rugged as will be explained below.<br>
Especially if the turning of the gear and/or generator is performed as a discontinuous<br>
and stepped function it is important that the control and monitoring system knows the<br>
position of the high-speed shaft in order to avoid long time vibration and weight<br>
exposure at the given position. Further, by knowing the exposure position and the<br>
period of exposure time it is possible to reduce the future exposure at the position as<br>
well as decide the next time to supply oil into the gear and generator.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the control and monitoring system<br>
controls the auxiliary device and the gear and generator discontinuously with a full<br>
turn of the gear and generator during one month. The auxiliary device moves the<br>
high-speed shaft of the gear and generator during one minute every three hours. The<br>
resulting movement every day is thus 12 degrees at a 30 day month and 1.5 degree<br>
during the one minute movement.<br>
The nacelle will naturally endure vibrations during the transportation in which some<br>
will be more severe than others. The control system and the algorithm may thus<br>
comprise thresholds defining the size of vibration shocks that should trigger an<br>
unscheduled acceleration or activation of the auxiliary device and the movement<br>
process.<br>
The oil film condition may also be controlled by the control and monitoring system<br>
e.g. by calculating the time period since the last oil supply with reservations for<br>
unscheduled acceleration or activation or the like.<br>
Further, the pressure in the oil lubrication system may be monitored in order to detect<br>
any pressure loss e.g. loss due to cracks or holes in the oil pipes. The pressure may<br>
be monitored between one or more preset threshold pressure values by pressure<br>
sensors.<br>
The energy levels of the energy storage or storages may be monitored in relation to<br>
preset information regarding the transportation time in order to secure a continuous<br>
or discontinuous turning of the gear throughout the whole transportation.<br>
If the energy level falls to a level indicating that there will not be sufficient energy to<br>
the whole transportation, the turning speed may be lowered or converted from a<br>
continuous to a discontinuous drive in order to preserve the remaining energy.<br>
Further, any redundant energy storage may be utilised e.g. electric accumulators as<br>
explained above.<br>
The control system may comprise data storage means that stores monitored<br>
information regarding the transportation.<br>
If the control system detects one or more fail situations that may be harmful for the<br>
different rotation means of the nacelle, the control system may transmit alarm signals<br>
to the person responsible for transportation e.g. the driver of the truck or the captain<br>
of the ship. Further, the signal may be transmitted to a remote control center e.g. the<br>
production plant.<br>
The signals may preferably be a wireless signal that identifies the nacelle, the<br>
problem and preferably the position of the nacelle e.g. with the use of mobile<br>
telephone systems together with GPS systems or satellite based maritime<br>
communication systems.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates a block diagram of a preferred embodiment of the auxiliary device<br>
and the connected means.<br>
The block diagram shows the components of a preferred embodiment of the auxiliary<br>
device 14 together with the direct connected means such as the high-speed shaft 16<br>
and the electric oil pump 20.<br>
The auxiliary device includes a thesel machine with a thesel motor connected with<br>
and driving an electric generator as well as the high-speed shaft of the gear through<br>
its thesel motor shaft.<br>
The thesel machine is supplied with thesel from a thesel storage tank and may<br>
discharge exhaust gas through an opening in the nacelle to the exterior.<br>
The electric generator supplies the electric oil pump with the necessary electric<br>
power. Further, the generator may supply an electric storage such as a number of<br>
electric accumulators. The accumulators may comprise a connection to the electric<br>
oil pump allowing the pump to be supplied with electric power without the thesel<br>
machine needs to be started.<br>
Some or all the components in the auxiliary device 14 are controlled and monitored<br>
from the control and monitoring system including clock means.<br>
As described above the control and monitoring system comprises a number of<br>
internal and external sensors monitoring the status of the different components of the<br>
auxiliary device and the external components connected to the auxiliary device.<br>
Further, the control and monitoring system may comprise a number of external<br>
sensors monitoring conditions<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates a nacelle including an auxiliary device according to a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
The figure shows the auxiliary device 14 in the form of an electric motor connected<br>
to a thesel generator system as described in connection with the block diagram of the<br>
previous figure.<br>
The electric motor is steadily positioned at the top of the framework of the gear 17.<br>
Further, the shaft of the electric motor is connected with a connection 15 to the high-<br>
speed shaft of the gear. The connection is a belt connecting a belt pulley of the motor<br>
shaft to a belt pulley of the gear.<br>
The figure also illustrates other nacelle components such as the hydraulic system 33<br>
for pitching the wind turbine blades, the low speed shaft 19 and the electric generator<br>
21.<br>
The high speed shaft is usually separated in two shaft ends before normal use of the<br>
wind turbine, said ends extending from the gear and the generator, respectively. At<br>
the erection of the wind turbine the shaft ends are flanged together.<br>
The present embodiment may temporarily connect the shaft ends in order to move<br>
both shaft ends, separately connect the auxiliary device(s) to each high-speed shaft<br>
end or just move one of the shaft ends e.g. the shaft end of the gear.<br>
In order to reduce the transfer of vibration to the different components of the nacelle,<br>
the components such as the gear and generator may be mounted on the nacelle with<br>
flexible rubber bushings.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates the connection 15 of figure 7 in more details, including the<br>
transmission of movement to the high-speed shaft at the gear.<br>
The connection 15 between the auxiliary device 14 and the high-speed shaft at the<br>
gear is achieved with a belt. The moment of force applied to the high-speed shaft is<br>
enhanced with a transmission between the small belt pulley 24a at the auxiliary<br>
device and a large belt pulley 24b at the shaft.<br>
It shall be emphasized that the belt system may easily be modified to move both the<br>
gear and the generator.<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates a further embodiment of connection means between an auxiliary<br>
device and the rotating means of a nacelle.<br>
The rotating means being the high-speed shaft ends 32 of the gear and generator and<br>
the connection means including a cardan coupling system 25, temporarily connecting<br>
the gear and generator during the transportation in a flexible manner.<br>
The cardan shaft system includes a gear and generator flange bushing 29, 30<br>
ensuring the connection of the cardan coupling system to the high-speed shafts. From<br>
the gear flange bushing 29 a cardan shaft 26 extends that ends in gearing means 27.<br>
The gearing means is also connected with a shaft to the generator flange bushing 30<br>
and through transmission means 31 to the auxiliary device 14. In order to fixate the<br>
gearing means in relation to the nacelle the gearing means further comprises securing<br>
means 28, said securing means preferably being a metal tube or bar engaging with a<br>
plate secured to the nacelle.<br>
The auxiliary device may preferably in the embodiment be an electric motor<br>
transferring force through the transmission and gearing means to the shafts of the<br>
nacelle gear and generator.<br>
It shall be emphasized that the cardan shaft system may easily be modified to move<br>
just the gear or just the generator.<br>
As mentioned above the auxiliary device may also be used in connection with long<br>
periods of stand still for the rotation means of a wind turbine beside the period of<br>
transportation. Examples of stand still periods may be longer periods of storage in<br>
storage facilities. The auxiliary device may receive its power from a separate power<br>
supply such as the public electricity grid.<br>
The invention has been exemplified above with reference to specific examples.<br>
However, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the particular<br>
examples described above but may be used in connection with a wide variety of<br>
applications. Further, it should be understood that especially the auxiliary device<br>
according to the invention may be designed in a multitude of varieties within the<br>
