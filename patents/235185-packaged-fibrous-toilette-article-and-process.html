HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>

PACKAGED FIBROUS TOILETTE ARTICLE AND PROCESS<br>
The invention concerns a personal care cleansing article in packaged form and a process for manufacture, the article <br>
5  particularly being a toilette bar integrated with a non-     woven fibrous web.<br>
Toilette bars are amongst the oldest forms of personal cleansing articles.  Research continues to provide improved<br>
10   bar technology.  Many problems exist requiring further<br>
solutions.  Bars are slippery when wet.  Better grabability is needed.  Some bars require a long time to generate sufficiently luxurious lather.  Quicker foaming bars are necessary.  Other types of bars form mush from placement in<br>
15  a wet dish awaiting further use.  Mush is aesthetically displeasing, both visually and by handling.<br>
Some of the aforementioned problems have sought to be overcome through the use of water-insoluble structural<br>
20  composites combined with soap.  A first variety encompasses surrounding a soap bar with a textile or fibrous sheath. For instance, US Patent 4,190,550 (Campbell) describes a seamless envelope of crimped, resilient, stretchy synthetic organic fibers surrounding a core of solid soap or other<br>
25  suitable surfactant material.  The envelope is held in integral form solely by the entanglement of the fibers.<br>
    US Patent 4,969,225 (Schubert) discloses a scrub brush. This article is formed from an elastic, resilient, synthetic <br>
30  fibrous bat or open-cell chemical foam (preferably<br><br>

polyurethane) having an internal cavity or tunnel containing a bar of soap.<br>
    EP 1 266 599 Al (Duden et al.) reports a solid cleanser <br>
5   holder.  The holder is formed of a textured film having texture variations with at least one aperture, the film surrounding a solid cleanser.<br>
    US patent application 2004/0033915 Al (Aleles et al.)   reports <br>
10  a cleansing bar which includes a cleansing composition and  a plurality of discrete elements, particularly fibers.  These discrete elements appear not to be formed into any extended bonded web.<br>
15  Another body of technical art focuses upon structuring cores surrounded by soap.  Apparently in this grouping, the core serves as a scaffold to support the cleansing composition. For instance, US Patent 5,221,506 (Dulin) discloses bar soaps for personal use having a structural center.<br>
20  Illustrative centers include open-celled sponges and woven or non-woven organic filamentary materials.  In a Fig. 2 embodiment, a small portion of the structural core protrudes through the surface for reasons of providing a hanger support (e.g. a hole).<br>
25<br>
US patent application 2003/0220212 Al (DeVitis) describes a reinforced bar soap.  The reinforcement member is provided to prolong usage of a conventional soap composition, and to serve as structural reinforcement eliminating soap breakage<br>
30  problems.<br><br>

US Patent 6/190,079 Bl (Ruff) discloses a scrubbing soap bar composed of vegetable oil/glycerine imbedded with a length of a thin, fine mesh netting. A portion of the netting extends exteriorly of the soap to form a pocket intended for <br>
5-   insertion of a human user's fingers to facilitate grasp of the bar.<br>
  Although there have been significant advances through the combination of soap compositions with reinforcement and/or <br>
10   textile webs, more discoveries are necessary to improve rate of lather volume generation/ minimization of mush and/or degradation of the web structure itself.<br>
  Besides necessity for improving functionality, there has <br>
15  been scant disclosure with respect to production methods for composite toilette bars.  Invariably, any disclosure regarding production involves necessarily the use of a 'production involvas which the resultant composite bar must  be ejected prior to-packaging. Production improvements are;<br>
20  necessary before these composite toilette bars can become available at affordable prices.<br>
In a first embodiment, there is provided a cleansing article which includes: <br>
25   (i)  a sealed plastic receptacle formed with a<br>
receiving cavity;	bonded fiber<br>
(ii) a fibrous web having a continuous/network Js3|<br>
(iii) a solid or semi-solid foamable composition<br>

Fig. 1 illustrates a personal care cleansing article viewed outside of the plastic single use packaging, according to the present invention.  A toilette bar is shown formed from a foamable composition 2.  All but an upper surface 3 of the <br>
5  illustrated bar is formed of the solid or semi-solid<br>
foamable composition.  Most of upper surface 3 is covered with an anchored layer of fibrous assembly 4 formed from a web of water-insoluble non-woven polyester or rayon/polypropylene hydroentangled web.  The web is<br>
10  structured as shown in Fig. 2 as a series of accordion<br>
vertically lapped folds 5.  These folds exhibit elongated peaks 6 and valleys 8.  Total number of folds may range from about 3 to about 20, preferably from 4 to 15, optimally from 6 to 9 per article.<br>
15<br>
Folds 5 along a length thereof are characterized by a<br>
longitudinal axis P2.  The toilette bar as shown in the<br>
embodiment of Fig. 1 is an elongate structure defined by a<br>
longitudinal axis Pi.  Advantageously the web 4 is<br>
20  positioned to orient the longitudinal fold axis P2<br>
transverse to the longitudinal article axis Pi.  Although<br>
orientation of P2 parallel to Pi may also be useful, this<br>
configuration tends to shrink on manufacture, and is easily disrupted through the lathering process.  The preferred<br>
25  orientation of P2 to Pi is the transverse orientation with<br>
ridges of the corrugated top web face being stable in manufacture and during lathering.  Corrugation also assists in achieving faster and higher foam volume than a non-corrugated web system.<br><br>

Fig. 3 illustrates the packaged toilette bar drawn in Fig. 1. The toilette bar 1 is formed and delivered to consumers in a plastic receptacle 10.  The receptacle is formed from a first section 12 and a second section 14.  These sections snap-fit 5  together along a circumferential male/female groove 16 which defines a receiving cavity 18.<br>
Manufacture of the toilette bar occurs in the following manner for the first embodiment.  Fibrous assembly 4 is<br>
10  placed into second section 14 of the plastic receptacle. First section 12 of the plastic receptacle is then snap-fitted onto the second section 14 by tight engagement of the male/female groove 16 on respective receptacle sections.  A normally solid or semi-solid (at 20°C) foamable composition<br>
15  is fluidized by applying heat between about 30° and about 100°C, preferably between 40 and 60°C.  Molten foamable composition is poured through aperture 20 into the receiving cavity 18.  Thereafter, aperture 20 is sealed either by heat sealing of the plastic surrounding the aperture or placement<br>
20  of a foil or cellulosic card to cover the aperture.<br>
Alternatively the above process can begin first by filling the second section of the receiving cavity with fluidized foamable composition 2.  Thereafter the fibrous assembly 4<br>
25  can be pressed into the foamable composition fill.  The<br>
first section 12 of the plastic receptacle is then oriented over the second section with downward pressure to cause the male/female groove 16 to snap-fit together along plate 22. The aperture 20 can then be sealed (or in a preferred<br>
30  embodiment for this particular process be absent from the structure of first section 12).<br><br>

An indicia 24 may be associated with the cleansing article. Ordinarily the indicia may include a brand name, an ingredients list, a contents weight, bar code, use instructions, advertising describing functional attributes <br>
5   of the toilette bar and usually combinations of all the<br>
aforementioned indicia.  Illustrative brand indicia include Dove®, Suave®, LifeBuoy®, Lux®, 01ay®, Neutrogena®, Ivory®, Fa®, Clear &amp; Clean® and Dial®.  One or more of these indicia may be heat stamped into or printed onto the plastic <br>
10  receptacle either prior to or post filling with the foamable composition/fibrous assembly.<br>
Indicia may alternatively be applied on further packaging such as a box into which the cleansing article is placed.<br>
15<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates a second embodiment of a curvilinear plastic receptacle forming the cleansing article of this invention.  Fig. 5 best illustrates the plastic receptacle in unfilled state.  The receptacle 110 is formed of a first<br>
20  section 112 and a second section 114 joined by a hinge 113. A male groove 116a is receivable in a female groove 116b forming a tight seal upon snap-fit of the grooves one into another.  The process for the second embodiment begins with placement of fibrous assembly 104 into the first section<br>
25  112.  Thereafter section 112 and 114 are snap-fit tightly together.  Foamable composition in a fluidized state is poured through aperture 120 into the receiving cavity 101 holding the fibrous assembly.  Once the fill has been completed, the aperture 120 is either heat-sealed, closed by<br>
30  addition of a stopper or provided with an adhesive film covering the mouth of the aperture.<br><br>
WO 2005/121298<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005852<br><br>
-   9   -<br>
An even more preferred process for use with the second embodiment per Fig. 4 involves use of receptacle 110 in sealed form, except that foamable composition in a fluidized state is the first substance to enter receiving cavity 101. <br>
5  Only thereafter is the fibrous assembly 104 inserted compressed through aperture 120 into the fluid filled receiving cavity.  The fibrous assembly causes the flexible plastic receptacle to expand slightly.  The composition (e.g. liquefied soap) through absorption into the fibrous <br>
10  assembly then partially withdraws.  Withdrawal requires a top-off with a further amount of foamable composition to completely fill the receptacle.<br>
Indicia 124 can be printed or stamped onto the plastic <br>
15  receptacle.  Advantageously the receptacles are formed of transparent if not translucent plastic.  This allows •viewability by the consumer of the toilette bar packaged as part of the cleansing article.<br>
20 A third embodiment is shown in Fig. 6.  The plastic<br>
receptacle 210 has a first section 212 which includes a hollow tub 215 having an aperture 220 surrounded by a landing 217.  A cavity 218 is formed within the tub.  A second section of the plastic receptacle is a flexible sheet 214.<br>
25<br>
The third embodiment as shown in Fig. 6 is manufactured in the following process.  Fluidized foamable composition 202 is filled into the cavity 218 via the aperture or open mouth 220 of the first section 212.  Fibrous assembly 4 is then<br>
30  placed with pressure into the fluidized foamable<br>
composition.  Section 214 of the plastic receptacle is then<br><br>
WO 2005/121298<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005852<br><br>
-   10   -<br>
laid over aperture 220 and adhesively sealed against landing 217 all along a perimeter of the aperture.  In this embodiment, pressure is necessary to be applied against second section 214 to insure that the fibrous web 204 is<br>
5  held firmly into the fluidized foamable composition until the latter has cooled into a semi-solid or solid state. Indicia can be pre-printed/embossed or subsequently printed/embossed after fill onto the relatively flat surface of the second section 214.  Alternatively, indicia can be<br>
10  printed/embossed on the first section 214, on paperboard or other cellulosic or plastic surrounding receptacle 210 or on any band wrapping around the cleansing article.<br>
Receptacles for use in the present invention can be made<br>
15  from a variety of plastics.  These include polyolefins of various densities such as polyethylene and polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate, polystyrene, polyester and any combinations thereof.  The receptacle may be formed of single or multi-layer plastics.  For instance,<br>
20  sections or any parts may be formed as laminates, an example of which is a polyethylene/polypropylene/polyethylene laminate, optionally with an adhesive layer.  Thickness of the plastic receptacle can vary over a large range. Advantageously the receptacle will have a thickness for the<br>
25  cavity area ranging from about 0.001 mil to about 1000 mil, preferably from about 0.1 mil to about 100 mil, optimally from about 1 to about 20 mil (1 mil is 0.0254 mm) .  Clear or at least translucent plastic is preferred.  A preferred source of the plastic is a receptacle that has been<br>
30  thermoformed (injection molded).  However, blister packaging can also be employed.<br><br>
WO 2005/121298<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005852<br><br>
-   11   -<br>
A variety of fibrous webs can be employed for the present invention.  Particularly preferred are fibrous batting webs with a continuous network of bonded fibers.  In a preferred embodiment, the batting web may have a Loft-Soft Ratio of <br>
5    greater than about 1.1.  In other words, the fibrous web of this invention preferably is lofty and fluid-permeable.<br>
As used herein, "lofty" means that the layer has density of from about 0.01 g/cm to about 0.00005 g/cm and a thickness <br>
10  of from about 0.1 to about 7 cm.<br>
Loftiness of substrates and softness of substrates are related.  Softness has several independent, contributing components.  One component is a kind of "pillow" softness.<br>
15  That is, when a force is applied by hand or finger pressure, the substrate easily compresses in much the same way a pillow compresses under pressure to support a body member resting thereon.  The web of the present invention is preferably characterized by having a Loft-Soft Ratio of<br>
20  greater than about 1.1, more preferably greater than about 1.3, and most preferably greater than about 1.5.<br>
The methodology for assessing Loft-Soft Ratio is as follows. Substrate samples are cut using a 4.76 cm (1.875 inch)<br>
25  diameter punch and hammer.  In instances where the punching process inelastically compresses edges of discs, the edges are carefully fluffed to restore original dimension.  With the top plate in position, the Instron load cell is calibrated and is then run in compression mode at 1.27<br>
30  cm/minute (0.50 inches/minute) rate of descent.  The Instron may be controlled manually or by computer as long as the<br><br>
WO 2005/121298<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005852<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
2<br>
final compression is greater than 30 grams/in pressure, and<br>
data is collected quickly enough (computer assisted recommended) to determine the height at various compression values during descent.  The top plate is then moved down <br>
5  until it contacts the base plate, at which point the height is set at zero.  It is important that the top plate and base plate are parallel, making contact at all points simultaneously.<br>
10  Once the apparatus is zeroed, the top plate is retracted to a position above the base plate allowing sufficient space to interpose a substrate sample disc.  A substrate disc is then placed in the center of the base plate.  The Instron is then set to compress each substrate sample once fully.  Next, the<br>
15  Instron is turned on and the height and force of the top plate is continuously recorded.  Once the compression of the sample is complete, the compression with new samples of the same substrate is repeated as many times as are needed to establish<br>
a reliable average.  The average height about the base plate<br>
20  at compression values of 5 gms/in2 and 30 gms/in2 equals the<br>
thickness at 5 gms/in2 and 30 gms/in2 , respectively.  The<br>
Loft-Soft Ratio is then calculated as the ratio of the<br>
thickness at 5 gms/in2 divided by the thickness at 30 gms/in2 .<br>
5  The webs of the present invention are continuous bonded fiber networks known also herein as a fibrous assembly.  The assembly is formed of a large number of fiber contact points such that a continuous structure is achieved.  The fibers may be synthetic, natural or combinations of these fibers<br>
10  converted via conventional well-known non-woven, woven or knit<br><br>
WO 2005/121298<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005852<br><br>
-   13   -<br>
processing methods.  Generally the non-wovens are preferred. Suitable synthetic fibers include but are not limited to polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, low-melt polyester, viscose rayon, polylactic acid, nylon and any<br>
5  blends/combinations thereof.  Additionally, synthetic fibers used herein can be described as staple and continuous filaments.  These fibers may be multi-component and have preferably denier ranging from about 1 to about 20 denier. Methods used to arrange and manipulate fibers into a non-woven<br>
10  fibrous assembly include but are not limited to<br>
carding/garnetting, airlay, wetlaid, spunbond, meltblown, vertical lapping or combinations thereof.  Cohesion, strength and stability are imparted into the fibrous assembly via bonding mechanisms such as that of needle punching, stitch<br>
15  bonding, hydroentangling, chemical bonding and thermal bonding and combinations thereof.<br>
Advantageously, fibrous assemblies of the present invention<br><br>
can range in basis weight from about 25 g/m to about 1,000<br><br>
20  g/m .  Lather generating can be improved by proper fibrous assembly density and porosity.  The term porosity (P) can be defined as the volume fraction of air to fibers within a given fibrous assembly.  Porosity can be expressed using the following equation:<br>
5	P= Pf—Pw<br>
Pf<br>
wherein Pf is fiber density (g/cm ), Pw  is non-woven density (g/cm ).  Note that the non-woven density is based on the <br>
30  apparent  thickness of the non-woven structure.  Preferably,<br><br>
WO 2005/121298	PCT/EP2005/005852<br>
-   14<br>
the fibrous assembly of the present invention should display porosity ranging from 0.95 to 0.9999.<br>
Another advantageous material property is resiliency. <br>
5  Specifically. Percent Energy Loss is a useful parameter since it describes the resilience of substrates to an applied loss. The Percent Energy Loss is calculated as follows:<br><br>
% Energy Loss =<br><br>
JT-JR<br><br>

wherein Jy, is the Total Energy required to compress non-woven<br>
to a 100 gram load and JR is the Recovered Energy during one<br>
compression cycle.  Lower energy loss corresponds to a more resilient non-woven.  Preferably, fibrous assemblies of the current invention have percent energy loss values ranging from about 5 % to about 50 %, preferably from about 5 % to about 35 %.<br>
The test method for Energy Loss involves use of an Instron Tensile/Compression Testing Machine fitted with a 3.81 cm (1.5 inch) circular die (sample cutting).  The compression cycle strain rate is set at 38 mm/min, the recovery cycle strain rate is also set at 38 mm/min.  The maximum load is 100 grams load (approximately 0.98 N), the load cell is 5 N, and the platen separation is 31.75 mm.  Total energy is measured which is required to compress a sample to 100 grams. Also measured is the recovered energy from one compression cycle. With these two values, the percent Energy Loss can be <br>
30    calculated based on the above equation.<br><br>

20  with a 400 g weight against the arm.  The wire cutter was allowed to lean against the toilette bar for 1 minute.  The bar was then pushed through the wire horizontally to cut a wedge out of the sample.  Length of the sample cut and temperature were recorded.  Yield stress (ss0) in kPa units<br>
25  is measured as follows:<br>
So = 0.375/ng -s- ID<br><br>
WO 2005/121298<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005852<br><br>
-   32   -<br>
wherein:<br>
m = mass of driving wire (mass placed on device plus 56 grams)<br>
g = gravitational constant (9.8m/s )<br>
5  1= length of wire penetrating soap bar after 1 minute (mm) D  = diameter of wire (mm)<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
10  Lather improvement was measured for the toilette bars of Example 1-3, and also for the same foamable composition toilette bars without non-woven fibrous network.  Results are recorded in Table V.<br>
15  TABLE V<br><br>
Example 1	Without Non-woven (ml)	With Non-woven (ml)	LIF<br>
1	90	188.33	2.09<br>
2	115	201.67	1.75<br>
3	160	236.67	1.47<br>
Based on the results in Table V, it is evident that the non-woven increased lather generation by a factor of 1.47 to <br>
20  2.1.  Significant differences were observed at the 95 % confidence level (p less than 0.05).<br>
Lather volume improvement as reported above was calculated via the following equation:<br><br>
WO 2005/121298<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005852<br><br>
-   33    -<br>
wherein Vw is the volume of lather produced with a non-woven present and VN is the volume of lather produced without a<br>
non-woven present. The protocol of the method involved pouring 200 ml of 38°C water at a rate of 5.26 mm/sec down a<br>
5  sheet of bubble wrap (23 x 38 cm) inclined at 45° into a 4,000 ml funnel (25.4 cm diameter).  Simultaneously with pouring of the water, the sample toilette bar is caused to oscillate in motion parallel to a longitudinal axis of the bubble wrap.  About 60-70 strokes of oscillation should<br>
10  occur before waterfall is terminated.  Lather generated by the water passing over the toilette bar is collected from the 4,000 ml funnel and trapped in a closed separatory funnel.  Thereafter, the stopcock of the separatory funnel is slowly rotated to release water.  Upon release of all the<br>
15  water, the stopcock is closed and lather volume in the calibrated separatory funnel is measured.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
20  Three different non-woven fibrous assemblies were evaluated for the relationship of porosity and lather volume improvement.  Results are recorded in Table "VI.<br><br>
WO 2005/121298<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005852<br><br>

TABLE  VI<br><br>
Sample	Porosity of Non-woven	Lather Volume (ml) With Non-woven	Lather Volume (ml)Without Non-woven	LIF	% Energy Loss<br>
A	0.983	195	150	1.300	39.8<br>
B	0.985	205	150	1.366	13.1<br>
C	0.995	225	150	1.500	15.8<br>
A 30 ml increase in lather volume was observed when porosity 5  increased from 0.983 to 0.995.  The toilette bars of<br>
    Examples 1-3 all utilized the fibrous assembly having the 0.995 porosity.  The results of Table VI also show that the high porosity samples reflect low percent energy loss values.  The latter indicates improved resilience of the <br>
10   fibrous network leading to improved dimensional stability of   the structures over time.<br><br>
