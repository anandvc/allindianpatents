The following Specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br>
1<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in general, relates to the field of telecommunication and particularly mobile communication. It describes a method of achieving fast handoff in PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access) by performing proactive context transfer. Since it is network-initiated handoff, this is more advantageous over MN initiated predictive handoff. More particularly, this invention relates to a method and system for fast handoff in PANA network initiated context transfer.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
A MN triggered predictive context transfer method is available. The step-by-step method of operation of the related art of a Mobile Node when it detects the movement is as follows:<br>
1.	pAR receives a CTAR message from the MN whose feature contexts are to<br>
be transferred.  This message provides the IP address of the nAR and an<br>
authorization token.<br>
2.	The pAR predictively transmits to the nAR, a Context Transfer Data (CTD)<br>
that contains feature contexts. This message also contains parameters for<br>
the nAR to compute an authorization token in order to verify the MN's<br>
token.<br>
3.	Regardless the MN sent from the CTAR to the pAR, it sends another CTAR<br>
message to the nAR in order to ascertain that the context transfer reliably<br>
took place.<br>
4.	Furthermore in this CTAR the MN includes the authorization token so that<br>
the nAR verifies it.<br>
5.	The nPAA receives PSA message from MN and it deduces that it has got<br>
CTD of this MN already and then the PANA session continues with a<br>
PANA-Bind exchange.<br><br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
1.	Existing predictive context transfer method requires PaC to be Fast MIPv6<br>
capable.<br>
2.	Existing predictive context transfer methods do not deal with avoiding<br>
PaC's data packets drop at new EP, till PaC gets authenticated with new<br>
PAA.<br>
3.	MN   triggered   context  transfer  methods   involve   consumption   of  air<br>
bandwidth (for L3 connectivity) which is expensive, since there will be<br>
interaction between MN and AP or AR.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
When PANA client moves from one PAA to another, PAA detects PaC's movement through L2 hint of link broken message from EP. Then PAA distributes the PANA context details of PaC to the nearby PAAs. When PaC gets attached to the new PAA, the new PAA will already have context of this PaC, and thus can finish the binding exchange and resume data packet transmission immediately. This is a network-triggered method rather than MN triggered method.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method for fast handoff in PANA using network initiated context transfer wherein when PANA client / Mobile node moves from one PANA Authentication Agent to another, PANA Authentication Agents detect PANA client's movement through L2 hint of link broken message from the Enforcement Point (EP) where the PANA Authentication Agent distributes the PANA context details of PANA client to the nearby PANA Authentication Agents and when PANA client gets attached to new PANA Authentication Agent, new PANA Authentication Agent gets the context of the said PANA client, thus finishing binding exchange and resuming data packet transmission.<br>
As soon as Mobile Node moves out from the Enforcement Point, Enforcement Point triggers L2 hint to PANA Authentication Agents, to indicate that the Mobile<br>
3<br><br>
Node is making a move. Being triggered by L2 hint, PANA Authentication Agents distributes Mobile Node's PANA context to the neighboring PANA Authentication Agents.<br>
After receiving context of Mobile Node, New PAA gives Mobile Node's ID to Enforcement Point, and asks the said Enforcement Point to allow the said Mobile Node. Mobile Node gets attached with new Enforcement Point, Enforcement Point sends out a message to new PANA Authentication Agent to trigger traffic driven discovery. New PANA Authentication Agent sends PANA Start Request message to Mobile Node. PANA Client responds with PANA Start Answer to New PANA Authentication Agent. After knowing the session id of Mobile Node, new PANA Authentication Agent relates the stored context and it sends out PANA Bind Request message to Mobile Node, which in response gets PANA Bind Answer. New PANA Authentication Agent informs New Enforcement Point that Mobile Node MN has authenticated successfully. New PANA Authentication Agent sends out HANDOVER ACK message to Previous PAA, along with Mobile Node's new address, enabling Previous Enforcement Point to transmit buffered data packets to MN's new address. PANA Authentication Agents sends out a HANDOVER release message to other neighboring PANA Authentication Agents, to release any PANA resource allocated for the Mobile Node. On receiving Handover Release message, other neighboring PANA Authentication Agents send out a message to their Enforcement Points to free PANA resources of Mobile Node, if it has allocated any. PANA Authentication Agent distributes the context of the Mobile Node, which is dissociated, to all neighboring PANA Authentication Agents and the said content includes session ID, which is used by Mobile Node when the said Mobile Node connects to new PANA Authentication Agent. After distributing, current PANA Authentication Agent sends a trigger to Enforcement Point to buffer packets that are received for the dissociated MN. As soon as it attaches to new Enforcement Point, the Mobile Node sends PANA Discovery message to the new PANA Authentication Agent followed by PANA start request. New PANA Authentication Agent identifies the Mobile Node using the session id got in the context and sends start answer. Mobile Node sends PANA Bind request and new<br>
4<br><br>
PANA Authentication Agent accepts the association and sends out PANA binding Answer thereby Mobile Node authenticates with new PANA Authentication Agent. Once Mobile Node is authenticated, new PANA Authentication Agent sends out a message to its Enforcement Point to allow the Mobile Node to communicate and new PANA Authentication Agent sends handover ACK to Mobile Node's previous PANA Authentication Agent along with Mobile Node's new address. Previous PANA Authentication Agent triggers its Enforcement Point to send all buffered packets of that Mobile Node to its new address and sends out handover release message to other neighboring PANA Authentication Agents, which release any resources in case they have reserved any for Mobile Node.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuring detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and / or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The invention described here requires the PAA to have information about neighboring PAAs for context communication.<br>
This invention proposes a method by which MN gets associated with new EP so fast and can avoid packet drop at new EP because of time delay in doing EAP authentication again. The following is the step-by-step operation of the invention, as depicted in Figure 2:<br>
1.	As soon as MN moves out from EP, EP triggers L2 hint to PAA, to indicate<br>
MN is making a move.<br>
2.	Being triggered by L2 hint, PAA distributes MN's PANA context to the<br>
neighboring PAAs.<br>
3.	After receiving context of MN, nPAA gives MN's ID to EP, and asking it to<br>
allow this MN.<br>
4.	When MN gets attached with new EP, EP sends out a message to new<br>
PAA to trigger traffic driven discovery.<br>
5.	nPAA sends PANA Start Request message to MN.<br>
6.	PaC responds with PANA Start Answer to nPAA.<br>
7.	After knowing the session id of MN, new PAA relates the stored context<br>
and it sends out PANA Bind Request message to MN, which in response<br>
gets PANA Bind Answer.<br>
6<br><br>
8.	nPAA informs nEP that MN has authenticated successfully.<br>
9.	nPAA sends out HANDOVER ACK message to pPAA, along with MN's<br>
new address, so that pPAA can inform pEP to transmit buffered data<br>
packets to MN's new address.<br>
10.	PAA sends out a HANDOVER release message to other neighboring<br>
PAAs, to release any PANA resource allocated for the MN.<br>
11 On receiving Handover Release message, other neighboring PAAs send out a message to their EPs to free PANA resources of MN, if it has allocated any.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
1.	It decreases the latency and minimizes the data loss during handoff.<br>
2.	MN need not be Fast MIPv6 capable to achieve fast handoff.<br>
3.	It saves Air bandwidth.<br>
4.	New PAA having PaC's prior context details avoids doing full EAP authentication<br>
again.<br>
The Figure 3 illustrates Message flow sequence from the time MN disconnects from pPAA till it resumes data communication being attached to nPAA. The Figure depicts the path of communication between different nodes covered in this invention.<br>
As soon as MN moves out of current EP, EP gets the dissociation trigger. EP sends out Link broken message to current PAA.<br>
PAA distributes the context of the MN which got dissociated, to all neighboring PAAs. It includes session ID with it, which will be used by the MN when it connects to new PAA. After distributing, the current PAA sends a trigger to EP to buffer packets that are received for dissociated MN.<br>
MN as soon as it attaches to new EP, sends a PANA Discovery message to new<br>
7<br><br>
PAA followed by PANA start request from PAA. New PAA identifies the MN using the session id it got in the context sent in start answer from MN. MN sends PANA Bind answer for the Bind request and new PAA accepts the association. Thus MN authenticates with new PAA.<br>
Once MN is authenticated, new PAA sends out a message to its EP to allow this MN to communicate with outside world.<br>
And also new PAA sends handover ACK to MN's previous PAA along with MN's new address.<br>
Previous PAA triggers its EP to send all buffered packets of that MN to its new address. In addition it sends out handover release message to other neighboring PAAs, which may release any resources in case they have reserved any for this MN.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Therefore, description of such combinations and variations is omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br>
