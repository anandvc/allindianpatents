Title:   Polyethylene blow molding composition for producing large containers<br>
The present invention relates to a polyethylene blow molding composition with multimodal molecular mass distribution, which is particularly suitable for blow molding of large blow moldings with a capacity in the range from 10 to 150 dm3 (I), and to a process for preparing this blow molding composition in the presence of a catalytic system composed of a Ziegler catalyst and a co-catalyst like triethylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, alkylaluminumchlorides and alkylaluminumhydrides, by way of a multistage reaction process composed of successive slurry polymerizations. The invention further relates to large containers produced from the,blow molding composition by injection blow molding.<br>
Polyethylene is widely used for producing blow moldings of all types requiring a material with particularly high mechanical strength, high corrosion resistance, and absolutely reliable long-term stability. Another particular advantage of polyethylene is that it also has good chemical resistance and is intrinsically a light-weight material.<br>
EP-A-603935 has previously described a blow molding composition based on<br>
polyethylene and having a t&gt;imodal molecular mass distribution, and suitable for<br>
the production of moldings with good mechanical properties.	^f ^^Jx-<br>
M IK<br>
US-A 5,338,589 describes a material with even broader molecular mass	[       (<br>
distribution, prepared using a high-mileage catalyst known from WO 91/18934,<br>
Pcden<br>
in which the magnesium alcoholate is used in the form of a gel-like suspension.	- s<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that the use of this material in moldings permits	W<br>
simultaneous improvement in properties which are usually contrary correlated<br>
in semicrystalline thermoplastics, these being stiffness on the one hand and ~4--^r^ ^rs^iv ropip+^nrQ onH tminhna
 <br>
r<br>
However, the known bimodal products, in particular, have relatively low melt strength during processing. This means that the extruded parisons frequently break in the molten state, making the extrusion process unacceptably sensitive to processing. In addition, especially when thick-walled containers are being produced, the wall thickness is found to be non-uniform, due to flow of the melt from upper regions into lower regions of the mold.<br>
It is an objective of the present invention, therefore, to develop a polyethylene composition for blow molding which shows a further improvement over all of the known materials in processing by blow molding to produce large blow moldings. In particular, the high melt strength of the composition should permit to run an extrusion process without parison disruption over a long period, and the precisely adjusted swell ratio index of the composition should permit an optimization of wall-thickness control.<br>
We have surprisingly found that this objective is achieved by way of a composition as mentioned at the outset, the characterizing features of which are that it comprises from 38 to 45 % by weight of a low-molecular-mass ethylene homopolymer A, from 30 to 40 % by weight of a high-molecular-mass copolymer B made from ethylene and from another 1-olefin having from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, and from 18 to 26 % by weight of an ultrahigh-molecular-mass ethylene copolymer C, wherein all of the percentage data are based on the total weight of the molding composition.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for preparing this composition in a cascaded slurry polymerization and to a process for producing, from this composition, large containers with a capacity (volume) in the range from 10 to 150 dm3 (I) and with quite excellent mechanical properties.<br>
The polyethylene composition of the invention has a density in the range of from 0.949 to 0.955 g/cm3 at 23 °C, and a broad trimodal molecular mass distribution. The high-molecular-mass copolymer B contains only small<br><br>
amounts of other 1-olefins having from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, namely from 0.1 to 0.2 % by weight. Examples of these co-monomers are 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, or4-methyl-1-pentene. The ultrahigh-molecular-mass ethylene homo- or copolymer C also contains an amount in the range from 2 to 3 % by weight of one or more of the above mentioned co-monomers.<br>
The polymer composition of the invention has a melt flow index ISO 1133 in the range of from 0.1 to 0.3 dg/min, expressed in terms of MFIi9o/5, and in the range of from 4 to 6 dg/min, expressed in terms of MFR190/21.6, and a viscosity number VNtot in the range of from 460 to 500 cnfVg measured to ISQ/R 1191 in decalin at135°C.<br>
The trimodality is a measure of the position of the centers of gravity of the three individual molecular mass distributions, and can be described with the aid of the viscosity number VN to ISO/R 1191 of the polymers formed in the successive polymerization stages. The relevant band widths for the polymers formed in each of the stages of the reaction are therefore as follows:<br>
The viscosity number VN1 measured on the polymer after the first polymerization stage is identical with the viscosity number VNA^of the low-molecular-mass polyethylene A and according to the invention is in the range of from 160to220cm3/g.<br>
The viscosity number VN2 measured on the polymer after the second polymerization stage is not equal to VNB of the high-molecular-mass polyethylene B formed in the second polymerization stage, which can only be determined by calculation, but rather represents the viscosity number of the mixture of polymer A and polymer B. According to the invention, VN2 is in the range of from 250 to 300 cm3/g.<br>
The viscosity number VN3 measured on the polymer after the third polymerization stage is not equal to VNC of the ultra-high-molecular-mass<br><br>
copolymer C formed in the third polymerization stage, which can only be determined by calculation, but rather represents the viscosity number of the mixture of polymer A, polymer B, and polymer C. According to the invention, VN3 is in the range from 460 to 500 cm3/g.<br>
The polyethylene is obtained by polymerizing the monomers in slurry in a temperature range of from 60 to 90 °C, at a pressure in the range of from 0.15 to 1 MPa, and in the presence of a high-mileage Ziegler catalyst composed of a transition metal compound and of an organoaluminum compound. The polymerization is conducted in three stages, i.e. in three stages arranged in series, each molecular mass being regulated with the aid of a hydrogen feed.<br>
The polyethylene composition of the invention may comprise other additives alongside the polyethylene. Examples of these additives are heat stabilizers, antioxidants, UV absorbers, light stabilizers, metal deactivators, compounds which destroy peroxide, and basic co-stabilizers in amounts of from 0 to 10 % by weight, preferably from 0 to 5 % by weight, and also fillers, reinforcing agents, plasticizers, lubricants, emulsifiers, pigments, optical brighteners, flame retardants, antistatics, blowing agents, or a combination of these, in total amounts of from 0 to 50 % by weight, based on the total weight of the mixture.<br>
The composition of the invention is particularly suitable for the blow molding process to produce large containers, by first plastifying the polyethylene composition in an extruder in the temperature range of from 200 to 250 °C and then extruding it through a die into a mold, where it is blown up and cooled and, thus, solidified.<br>
The composition of the invention gives particularly good processing behavior in the blow molding process to produce large blow moldings, such as large containers, because it has a swell ratio index in the range of from 175 to 205 %, and the large blow moldings produced therewith have particularly high mechanical strength because the molding composition of the invention has a<br><br>
notched impact strength (ISO) in the range of from 30 to 60 kJ/m2. The stress-crack resistance (FNCT) is in the range of from 60 to 110 h.<br>
The notched impact strength^ is measured according to ISO 179-1/1eA / DIN 53453 at 23 °C. The size of the specimen is 10 x 4 x 80 mm, and a V notch is inserted using an angle of 45°, with a depth of 2 mm and with a notch base radius of 0.25 mm.<br>
The stress-crack resistance of the molding composition of the invention is determined by an internal test method and is given in h. This laboratory method is described by M. Fleiliner in Kunststoffe 77 (1987), pp. 45 et seq., and corresponds to ISO/CD 16770, which has since come into force. The publication shows that there is a relationship between determination of slow crack growth in the creep test on specimens with a circumferential notch and the brittle section of the long-term internal- and hydrostatic-pressure test to ISO 1167. In ethylene glycol as stress-crack-promoting medium at 80 °C with a tensile stress of 3.5 MPa, the time to failure is shortened due to the shortening of the stress-initiation time by the notch (1.6 mm/razorblade). The specimens are produced by sawing out three specimens of dimensions 10x10 mm from a pressed plaque of thickness 10 mm. These specimens are provided with a central notch, using a razorblade in a notching device specifically manufactured for the purpose (see Figure 5 in the publication). The notch depth is 1.6 mm.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
Ethylene was polymerized in a continuous process in three reactors arranged in series. An amount of 1.0 mol/h of a Ziegler catalyst prepared as specified in WO 91/18934, Example 2, and having the operative number 2.2 in the WO, was fed into the first reactor together with 15 mol/h of triethylaluminum, as well as sufficient amounts of diluent (hexane), ethylene, and hydrogen. The amount of ethylene (= 5.3 t/h) and the amount of hydrogen (= 2.3 kg/h) were adjusted so that the percentage proportion of ethylene and of hydrogen measured in the gas phase of the first reactor were 33 % by volume and 56 % by volume, respectively, and the rest was a mix of nitrogen and vaporized diluent.<br>
The polymerization in the first reactor was carried out at 70 °C.<br>
The slurry from the first reactor was then transferred into a second reactor, in which the percentage proportion of hydrogen in the gas space had been reduced to 16 % by volume, and an amount of 7 kg/h of 1-butene was added to this reactor alongside 4.5 t/h of ethylene. The amount of hydrogen was reduced by way of intermediate H2 depressurization. 67 % by volume of ethylene, 16 % by volume of hydrogen, and 0.37 % by volume of 1-butene were measured in the gas phase of the second reactor, the rest being a mix of nitrogen and vaporized diluent.<br>
The polymerization in the second reactor was carried out at 85 °C.<br>
The slurry from the second reactor was transferred to the third reactor using further intermediate H2 depressurization to adjust the amount of hydrogen to 
An amount of 69 kg/h of 1-butene was added to the third reactor alongside an amount of 2.8 t/h of ethylene. A percentage proportion of 87 % by volume of ethylene, 
 <br>
was measured in the gas phase of the third reactor, the rest being a mix of nitrogen and vaporized diluent.<br>
The polymerization in the third reactor was carried out at 75 °C.<br>
The long-term polymerization catalyst activity required for the cascaded process described above was provided by a high-mileage Ziegler catalyst as described in the WO mentioned at the outset. A measure of the usefulness of this catalyst is its extremely high hydrogen sensitivity and its uniformly high activity over a long time period of from about 1 to 8 h.<br>
The diluent is removed from the polymer slurry leaving the third reactor, and the polymer is dried and then pelletized.<br>
