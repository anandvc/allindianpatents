<br>
THE PLANTING OF PLANT MATERIAL<br>
The present invention relates to a method and a sdevice for the treatment and especially planting seed and/or plantable material, such as for instance, though not exclusively, seeds, seedlings, etc.<br>
Such a method and device are known from e.g. US-2004/0.231.575, where seeds are deposited in a trench or lOfurrow, and treatment substance is deposited in<br>
correspondence with a location, where individual seeds are expected to drop in the furrow.<br>
In the technology of planting plants it is known to pretreat seeds and/or plantable material, i.e. that for I5planting the plantable material a treatment can be performed. Then a treatment agent, such as a fungicide, a pesticide, bacteria, etc. or a growth promoting substance, in the form of a coating can be applied on the seeds, seedlings, etc.<br>
Alternatively it has been proposed to deposit seeds 20or seedlings, etc. and treatment substance separately and approximately simultaneously on a planting position in order to thereby obviate the need to apply a coating on seeds, seedlings, etc.<br>
The present invention relates to an improvement to 25this last named alternative in the form of a method and a device according to respectively claim 1 and claim 8.<br>
With a method and a device according to the present invention it is possible to realize a very fast process of seeding and/or planting wherein seeds, seedlings, etc. and 30separately therefrom also treatment substances can be<br>
deposited in an arbitrary sequence or simultaneously in or on the planting positions in a substrate. With certainty under such circumstances it is achieved, that the seeds or<br>
 <br>
piantable material are put into the intended planting position and/or that the treatment substance is put into the envisaged planting position. In embodiments, wherein both of the seed and/or planting material and the treatment substance 5are to be deposited in a planting position, and wherein according to the present invention the depositing Trajectory, etc., is taken into account, it is ensured that not only a specimen of the seed and/or the plantable material is deposited into at least one of the planting positions, but<br>
10 also a predetermined amount of treatment substance -<br>
The present invention comprises several preferred embodiments, such as these are defined in the dependent claims 2-7 and 9. It is obvious, that these preferred embodiments are not limiting on the present invention. For an<br>
iSexample claim 2 relates to the feature, that the method is performed in a continuous movement, essentially without interruptions, when displacing the depositing means and the substrate relative to one another. As such it is possible to ensure, that the speed of the process can be increased<br>
.'0considerably, without diminishing the security, that upon each desired planting position a specimen of the seed and/or plantable material is deposited, together with a dosed or desired amount of treatment substance.<br>
In many possible embodiments the substrate will be<br>
25displaced relative to the depositing means. As such the device having depositing means can be arranged in a stationary manner and substrates can be fed there trough with the relative displacement speed to arrange therein seeds and/or plantable material and to simultaneously provide a<br>
30desired amount of treatment substance at each planting<br>
position in the substrate. This, however, does not exclude, that the present method can also be performed in an open<br>
 <br>
field or in the natural ground, where the substrate is interpreted as the soil.<br>
A substrate can be a layer of fibrous material comprising for instance stone wool fibres, pot ground, cocos s fibres, etc. with rows of planting positions arranged therein, where the depositing means comprise essentially corresponding rows of depositing elements. As such, at every planting position in a row, a specimen of the seed and/or the piantable material can be deposited, together with a dosed or<br>
10desired amount of treatment substance. Such a substrate can for instance be made from fibrous material, known as a tray with rows of planting positions at well defined intermediate distances, which are for instance equal to the distances between the planting positions in every row. The depositing<br>
iselements take care of depositing the seed and/or the<br>
plantable material and/or the treatment substance. In such an embodiment the rows can be arranged in a transversal orientation relative to the displacement direction, where the depositing elements are controlled by the control to<br>
20simultaneously and in correspondence with the rows deposit numbers of specimens of the seeds and/or the plantable material and/or the dosed amounts of treatment substance. As a result at all planting positions in a row a specimen of the seeds and/or the plantable material and/or the treatment<br>
2 5 substance can be deposited and optimum use can be made of holders of a substrate, that are known as trays, such as' plates of fibrous material.<br>
It is noted, that especially in case where depositing both a specimen of the seeds and/or the plantable material as<br>
3Owe11 as a desired amount of treatment substance at a planting position is desired, the control can take into account differences in the depositing trajectory, the depositing speed, etc., for different properties of the seeds and/or the<br>
 <br>
nvennicn also in itself relates to a device for performing he mechod according to the present: invention.<br>
Below a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described, referring to the accompanying drawings, wherein the same or similar components and elements are designated with the same reference numbers, and wherein:<br>
fig. 1 shows a schematic perspective view of an embodiment of the present invention;<br>
fig. 2 shows a cross sectional .view along the line II-II in fig. 1; and<br>
fig. 3 shows the progression of the invention, in the embodiment that is schematically represented in fig. 1 and fig. 2.<br>
In fig. 1 a tray 1 is shown. In the upper surface of the tray 1 planting positions 2 are defined, for instance in the shape of (small) depressions or pits. The tray 1 with the planting positions 2 is filled with for instance a substrate, or is manufactured from a fibrous material, such as stone wool, but additionally or alternatively use can be made of cocos fibres or potting soil. The planting positions 2 are arranged in the upper surface of the substrate 1 in rows 3 within the embodiment shown schematically in fig. 1 seven planting positions 2 per row 3.<br>
Further, in fig. 1, depositing elements 4 are shown for drops of treatment substance, as well as depositing elements 5 for seeds. It is evident, that additionally or alternatively for drops of treatment substance also granular or powder shaped treatment substances ca^n be employed, and in the place of seeds also seedlings, etc, can be planted in the substrate 1.<br>
The substrate 1 in the form of the tray with the planting positions is advanced in the direction of arrow A relative to the depositing elements 4, 5 with transport means (not shown), where the depositing elements 4, 5 are themselves stationary and form part of a device for<br>
 <br>
performing the method according to the present invention. It is noted, that also such a device, of which here only the depositing elements 4, 5 are shown in fig. 1, can be mobile, where for instance no substrates 1 pass under the depositing elements 4, 5, but where the depositing elements 4, 5 can even be arranged on a transportable frame in order to be pulled over a agricultural field or the full soil or any other stationary ground underneath. Such a solution can also provide in making the ground underneath flat and forming therein pits in correspondence with the planting positions 2, such as those that have been shown in fig. 1,<br>
As shown in fig. 2, the substrate 1 is displaced in the direction of arrow A. In the cause of this action regularly (rows of) planting positions are arranged underneath the depositing elements 4, shown in fig. 1, for drops of treatment substance and underneath the depositing elements 5 for depositing seeds in the planting positions. The depositing elements 4, providing drops of treatment substance, and the depositing elements 5 for seeds are at some distance from one another in the direction of movement of arrow A, relative to one another. This fact is to be taken into account when it is desired, that a drop 6 and a seed 7 subsequently or simultaneously arrive at or in one of the planting positions 2. In this process also the depositing speed and the air resistance of drops 6 and seeds 7 can be taken into account, in order to drive the depositing elements 4, 5 with a control (not shown) on the basis of these differences in position and depositing properties. In the embodiment as shown first a drop 6 is deposited in a planting position 2 formed by a depression, followed by a seed 7, while it is possible under other circumstances due to legislature, etc. that it is desirable to reverse this sequence. Then first a seed 7 is deposited, followed by the<br>
 <br>
drop 6, so  that there is no pretreatment of the substrate 1, prior to depositing the seed.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the situation in a reversed order, such as it has already been described herein above, where the depositing elements 4, 5 are moved in the direction of arrow A' over a ground underneath, for instance the soil of an agricultural field, where it should also be taken into account at which moment a drop of treatment substance and a seed is to be deposited in order to be brought into correspondence with one another, and so that at each planting position not only a seed 7, but also a drop of treatment substance 6,   is deposited.<br>
With the present invention a highly automated process is made available, which is very favourable in relation to costs, without requiring that precoated seeds 7, which are relative expansive, must be purchased. According to the present invention positional differences are taken into account of the depositing elements 4, 5, as well as differences in depositing properties and trajectories of the individual treatment substances in distinguishable shapes (drops, powder, granules, etc.) and the seeds and/or the plantable material, for instance seeds, seedlings, etc. By taking all these different factors into account it is possible to ensure with certainty, that at each planting position to a treatment substance is deposited in combination with seeds and/or a plantable material.<br>
After having been confronted with the description herein above, many alternative and additional embodiments will become apparent to the skilled person. For instance it can be possible, that the depositing elements for the treatment substance or for specimens of the seeds and/or the plantable material are not exactly downward oriented. For instance a drop 6 of treatment substance can be '"fired" onto<br>
 <br>
a falling seed to encompass the seed 1,   before the seed 7 lands in a planting position. It is also possible to combine the depositing elements 4, 5 in order to dip the seeds and/or the plantable material in treatment substance or to encompass the seed therein, just prior to depositing at least a specimen of the seeds and/or the plantable material, as long as it is ensured, that thereafter the movement in the direction of arrow A or A' is taken into account^ when it comes to letting go of the specimen of the plantable material, that is thus treated with pretreatment substance, as well as the envisaged location, where this should arrive, i.e. at one of the planting positions. It can also be preferred, under certain circumstances, to first deposit the seed, followed by the treatment substance. Further alternative and additional embodiments are all considered to lie within the scope of protection of the present invention in as far as these embodiments do not diverge in letter or spirit from the definitions of the present application in accordance with the accompanying claims.<br>
