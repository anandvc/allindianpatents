				<td>		More recently, several publications have described histamine H3 ligands<br>
	that do not contain an imidazole moiety, for example: Ganellin. C-R. et al.;<br>
5	Walczynski, K. et al., Arch. Pharm. Pharm. Med. Chem. (Weinheim, Ger.)<br>
	1999, 332:389-398, Walczynski, K. et at., farmeco 1999, 54:584-694; Linney,<br>
	I.D. et al., J. Med Chem. 2000, 43:2362-2370; Tozer, M.J, and Kafindjian,<br>
	S.B., Exp, Opin. Ther. Pafents 2000, 10:1045-1055; U.S. Patent 5,352,707;<br>
	PCT Application WO 98/42458, Aug. 26, 1999; PCT Applfcatron WO<br>
10	02/076925; and European Patent Application 0978512, Feb. 9, 2000.<br>
		The compounds of the present invention do not contain the imidazole<br>
	moiety, and its inherent liabilities, and yet maintain potency at the human H3<br>
	receptor as determined by receptor binding to the human histamine H3 receptor<br>
	(see Lovenberg, T.W. et al., Mol. Pharmacol 1999, 55:1101-1107). Screening<br>
15	using the human receptor is particularly important for the identification of new<br>
	therapies for the treatment of human disease. Conventional binding assays<br>
	are determined using rat synaptosomas (Garbarg, M. et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp.<br>
	Ther. 1992, 263 (1):304-310), rat cortical membranes (West, R.E. et al., Mol.<br>
	Pharmacol. 1990, 33:610-613), and guinea pig brain (Korte, A. et al., Biochem.<br>
20	Biophys, Res. Commun, 1990, I68(3):979-986). Only limited studies have<br>
	been performed previously using human tissue but these allude to significant<br>
	differences in the pharmacology of rodent and primate receptors (West, R.E. et<br>
	al., Eur. J. Pharmacol 1999,377:233-239).<br>
		We now descride a series of piperazinyl and diazepanyl benzamides and<br>
25	benzthioamides with the ability to modulate the activity of the histamine<br>
	receptor, specifically the H3 receptor, without the inherent problems associated<br>
	with the presence of an imidazolyl moiety.<br>

		C. Synthesis<br>
		The compounds of the invention can be prepared according to<br>
	traditional synthetic organic methods and matrix or combinatorial chemistry<br>
	methods, as shown in Scheme 1 below and in Examples 1-72. A person of<br>
5	ordinary skill will be aware of variations and adaptations of the schemes and<br>
	examples provided to achieve the compounds of the invention.<br>
		One skilled in the art will recognize that synthesis of the compounds of<br>
	the present invention may be effected by purchasing intermediate or protected<br>
	intermediate compounds described in any of the Schemes disclosed herein.<br>
10	Throughout the schemes when the reacting functionality is located at R4, one<br>
	skilled to the art will recognize that the choice of R4 is illustrative only and that<br>
	the reacting functionality could also be located at.R3 or R2 also.<br>
		One skilled in the art will further recognize that during any of the<br>
	processes for preparation of the compounds of the present invention, it may be<br>
15	necessary and/or desirabIe to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the<br>
	molecules concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional<br>
	protecting groups, such as those described in "Protective Groups in Organic<br>
	Chemistry", ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and T.W. Greene &amp;<br>
	P.G.M. Wute, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis". John Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>
20	1991. The protecting groups may be removed at a convenient subsequent<br>
	stage using methods known from the art.<br>
		Compounds of formula (XIII) may be prepared according to the<br>
	processes outlined in Scheme 1. One skilled in the art will recognize that the<br>
	location of formyl functionality at R4 is for illustrative purposes only and that the<br>
25	formyl group may also be located at R2 or R3.<br>

	such as THF, DCE, DCM, methanol, ethanol, or ether at a temperature<br>
	between 0 and 30 °C, One skilled in the art will recognize that the use of a<br>
	promoter or catalyst with acidic character such as organometallie complexes or<br>
	carboxylic acids may increase the rate of the reaction and/or reduce the<br>
10	formation of by-products, in a particularly preferred embodiment, a compound<br>
	of formula (V) is reacted with an aldehyde or ketone, acetic acid, and sodium<br>
	trracetoxyhorohyrdide in DCE at room temperature. A compound of formula<br>
	(VII) is obtained from a compound of formula (VI) by reacting a compound of<br>
	formula (VI) with a reagent capable of removing the protecting group M1 under<br>

	formula (VI), in which the protecting group M1 is tert-butyl carbamoyl, is reacted<br>
	with an acid such as anhydrous hydrogen chloride in a solvent such as dioxane<br>
	or etherat room temparature. A compound of fovmula (IX) is obtained by<br>
	reacting a compound of formula (VlI) with a compound of formula (VIll) under<br>
20	amide-formation conditions. In a preferred embodiment, a compound of<br>
	formula (VIII), either as a free base or as s mineral acid salt, is reacted with a<br>
	compound of formula (VIII) in the presence of a dehydrating agent and a base<br>
	in a solvent at a temperature between 0 °C and 60 °C. In a particularly<br>
	preferred embodiment, a compound of formula (VII) as a hydrochloride salt is<br>
25	used, the dehydrating agent is 143-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodlimide<br>
	hydrochloride and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate, and the base is N-<br>
	methylmarpholine. A compound of formula (XIII) is obtained by reacting a<br>
	compound of formula (IX) with a compound of formula (XI) in the presence of a<br>
	reducing agent under reductive amination conditions, as outfined in step A. A<br>
30	compound of formula (X) is obtained by reacting a compound of formula (V)<br>
	with a compound of formula (Vlll) under amide formation conditions as outlined<br>
	in step C. A compound of formula (XII) is obtained by reacting a campound of<br>
	formula (X) with a compound of formula (XI) under reductive amination<br>

	protected or derivatived forms of the described compounds.<br>
		Where the compounds according to this invention have at least one<br>
	chiral center, they may accordingly exist as enantiomers. Where the<br>
5	compounds possess two or more chiral centers, they may additionally exist as<br>
	diastereomers. It is to be understood that all such isomers and mixtures<br>
	thereof are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.<br>
	Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms for the compounds may exist as<br>
	potymorphs and as such are intended-to be included in the present invention,<br>
10	In addition, some of the compounds may form solvates with water (i.e.,<br>
	hydrates) or common organic; solvents, and such solvatee are also intended to<br>
	be encompassed within the scope of this invention.<br>
		The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions<br>
	comprising one or more compounds of this invention in association with a<br>
15	phannaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally additional phamaceutical<br>
	agents such as H1 antagonists or SSRls. Preferably these compositions are in<br>
	unit dosage forms such as pills, tablets, caplets, capsules (each including<br>
	immediate release, timed release and sustained release formulations),<br>
	powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions (including<br>
20	syrups and emulsions), metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules,<br>
	autoinjector devices or suppositories; for oral, parenteral, intranasal, sublingual<br>
	or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation.<br>
	Alternativesy, the composition may be presented in a form suitable for once-<br>
	weekly or once-monthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt of the<br>
25	active compound, such as the decanoats salt, may be adapted to provide a<br>
	depot pysparaticin for intramuscular injection. For preparing solid compositions<br>
	such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical<br>
	carrier, e.g, conventional tableting ingredients such as com starch, lactose,<br>
	sucrose, sorbitol, talc, steatic acid, magnesium, stearate, dicalcium phosphate<br>
30	or gums, and other pharmaceutical diluents, e,g, water, to form a solid pre-<br>
	formulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of<br>
	the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. When<br>
	referring to these pre-formulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant<br>
39<br><br>
W0 2004/037801								PCT/US2003/033343<br>
	that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so<br>
	that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective dosage<br>
	forms such as Eablets, pilis and capsules. This solid pre-formulation<br>
	composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forme of the type described<br>
5	above containing from 5 to about 1000 mg of the active ingredient of the<br>
	present invention. Examples include 5 mg, 7 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 35<br>
	mg, 50 mg, 76 mg, 100 mg, 120 mg, 160 mg, and so on. The tablets or pills of<br>
	the disclosed compositions can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide<br>
	a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the<br>
10	tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component,<br>
	the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two<br>
	components can be separated by an enteric layer, which serves to resist<br>
	disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact<br>
	into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of material can be<br>
15	used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of<br>
	polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose<br>
	acetate.<br>
		The liquid forms in which the compounds and compositions of the<br>
	present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection<br>
20	include, aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil<br>
	suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil,<br>
	sesame oil, cocanut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar<br>
	pharmaceutical vehlcles. Suitable dispersing or suspending agents for<br>
	aqueous suspensions, include synthetic and natural gums such as tragacanth,<br>
25	acacia, alginate, dextran, sodium carboxymetriylceliulose, methylcellulose,<br>
	polyvinyl-pymolidone or getelim.<br>
		Where the processes for the preparetion of the compounds according to<br>
	the invention give rise to mixture of slereoisomers, these isomers may be<br>
	separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography.<br>
30	The compounds may be prepared in racemic form, or individual enantiomers<br>
	may be prepared either by enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution. The<br>
	compounds may, for example, be resolved into their component enantiomers<br>
	by standard techniques., such as the fomation of diaestereomeric pairs by salt<br>
40<br><br>
WO2004/037801								PCT/US2003/033343<br>
	formation With an optically active acid, such as (-)-di-p-tolucyl-d-tartaric acid<br>
	and/Or (+)-di-p-toluayl-1-tartaric acid followed by fractional crystallization and<br>
	regeneration of the free base. The compounds may also be resolved by<br>
	formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic<br>
5	separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds<br>
	may be resoled using a chiral HPLC column.<br>
		Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be<br>
	administered in a single daily dose, of the total daily dosage may be<br>
	administered in divided doses of two, three or four times daily. Furthermore,<br>
10	compounds for the presant invention can be administered in infransal form via<br>
	topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via trsnsdermal skin patches well<br>
	known to those of ordinary skill in that art. To be adminstered in the form of a<br>
	transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be<br>
	continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.<br>
15	For instance, for oral adminstration to the fom of a tablet or capsule, the<br>
	active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically<br>
	acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Moreover,<br>
	when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents<br>
	and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders<br>
20	include, without limitation, starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or<br>
	beta-actnse, com sweetsners, natural and synthetic gums such as scads,<br>
	tragacanth or sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium<br>
	benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators include,<br>
	without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the<br>
25	like.<br>
		The compound of the present invention can also be administered in the<br>
	form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large<br>
	unilannellar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomea can be foimecf from<br>
	a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or<br>
30	phophatidylcholines.<br>
	Compounds of the present invention may also be delivered by the use of<br>
	monoclonal antibodies as Individual carriers to which the compound molecules<br>
	are coupled. The compounds of the present invention may also be coupled with<br>

	soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include<br>
	polyvinylpytrolidone, pyran copotymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacryamidephenot,<br>
	polyhydroxyethylaspartanmidephenol, or polyethyleneoxidepolylysine substituted<br>
	with palmitoyl residue. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention<br>
5	may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving<br>
	controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polyepsilon<br>
	caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyoesters, polyacetals,<br>
	polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates and cross-linked or amphipathic block<br>
	copolymers of hydrogels.<br>
10		Compounds of this invention may be administered in any of the foregoing<br>
	compositions and according to dosage regimens established in the art whenever<br>
	treatment is required.<br>
		The daily dosage of the products may be varied over a wide range from 1<br>
	to 1,000 mg per adult human per day. For oral administration, the compositions<br>
15	are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0, 5.0,10.0,15.0, 25.0,<br>
	50.0,100, 250 and 500 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic<br>
	adjustment of the dosage to the subject to be treated. An effective amount of<br>
	the drug is ordinarily supplied at a dosage level of from about 0.01 mg/kg to<br>
	about 20 mg/kg of body weight per day. Preferably, the range is from about 0.02<br>
20	mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg of body weight per day, and especially from about 0.05<br>
	mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg of body weight per day. The compounds may be<br>
	administered an a regjmen of 1 to 4 times per day.<br>
		Optimal dosages to be administered may be readily determined by those<br>
	skilled in the art, and will vary with the particular compound used, the mode of<br>
25	administraton, the strength of the preparatron, the mode of administratran, and<br>
	the advancement of the disease condition. In addition, factors associated with<br>
	the particular patient being treated, inducting patient age, weight, diet and time of<br>
	administration, with result in the need to adjust dosages,<br>
30		2. Combination Therapy<br>
		The disclosed compounds are useful in combinallon with other<br>
	therapeutic agents, Including H1 receptor antagonists. H2 receptor antagonists,<br>
42<br><br>
WO 2004/037801								PCT/US2003/033343<br>
	and neuretransmitter modulators such as SSRIs and non-selective serotonin<br>
	re-uptake inhibitors (NSSRIs).<br>
		Methods are known in the art for determining effective doses for<br>
	therapeutic and prophylactic purposes for the disclosed pharmaceutical<br>
5	compositions or the disclosed, drug cambinations, whether or not formulated in<br>
	the same composition. For therapeutic purposes, the term "jointly effective<br>
	amount" as used herein, means that amount of each active compound or<br>
	pharmaceutical agent, alone or in combination, that elicits the biological or<br>
	medicinal response in a tissue system, animal or human that is being sought<br>
10	by a nesearcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinicianm, which includes<br>
	alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated. For<br>
	prophylactic purposes (i.e., inhibiting the onset or progression of a disorder),<br>
	the term "jointiy effective amount" refers to that amount of each active<br>
	compound or pharmaceutical agent, alone or in combination, that inhibits in a<br>
15	subject the onset or progression of a disorder as being sought by a researcher,<br>
	veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, the delaying of which disorder is<br>
	mediated, at least in part, by the modulation of one or more histamine<br>
	receptors. Thus, the present invention provides combinations of two or more<br>
	drugs wherein, for example, (a) each drug is administered in an independently<br>
20	therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount; (b) at least one drug in the<br>
	combination is administered in an amount that is sub-therapeutic or sub-<br>
	prophylactic if administered alone, but is therapeutic or prophylactic when<br>
	administered in combination with the second or additional drugs according to<br>
	the invention; or (c) both drugs are administered in an amount that is sub-<br>
25	therapeutic or sub-prophylactic if administered alone, but are therapeutic or<br>
	prophylactic when administered together. Combinations of three or more drugs<br>
	are analogously possible. Methods of combination therapy include co-<br>
	administration of a single formulation containing all active agentsl essentially<br>
	contemporaneous administration of more than one formulation; and<br>
30	administration of two or more active agents separately formulated,<br>

BIOLOGICAL METHODS<br>
In Vitro<br>
	Transfection of cells with human histamins receptor<br>
15		A 10 cm tissue culture dish with a confluent monolsyer of SK-N-MC cells<br>
	was split two days prior to transfeclion. Using sterile technique the media was<br>
	removed and the cells were detached from the dish by the addition of trypsin.<br>
	One fifth of the cells were then placed onto a new 10 cm dish. Cells were<br>
	grown in a 37 ºC incubator with 5% CO2 in Minimal Essential Media Eagle with<br>
20	10% Fetal Boylne Serum,After two days celle were approximately 80%<br>
	confluent. These were removed from the dish with trypsirt and pelleted in a<br>
	clinical centriluge. The pellet was then re-suspended in ADD ml complete<br>
	madia and transfferred to an etectroporation cuvetle with a 0.4 cm gap between<br>
	the electrodes. One microgram of supercoilad H3 receptor cDNA was added to<br>
25	the cells and mixed. The voltage for the electroporation was set at 0.25 kV, the<br>
	capacitance was set at 960 mF. After electroporation the cells were diluted into<br>
	10 mL camp fete media and plated onto four 10 cm dishes. Because of the<br>
	variability in the efficiency of electroporation, four different concentrations of<br>
	cells were plated. The ratios used were: 1:20, 1:10, 1:5, with the remainder of<br>
76<br><br>
WO 2004/037801								PCT/US2003/033343<br>
	the cells being added to the fourth dish. The cells were allowed to recover for<br>
	24 h before adding the selection media complete media with 600 mg/mL<br>
	G418). After 10 days dishes were analyzed for surviving colonies of cells.<br>
	Dishes with well-isolated colonies were used. Cells from individual colonies<br>
5	were isolated and tested, SK-N-MC cells were used because they give<br>
	efficient coupling for inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The clones that gave the<br>
	most robust inhibition of adenylato cyclase in response to histamine were used<br>
	for further study.<br>
10	{3H}-N-methythistamine binding<br>
		Cell pellets from histemtne H3 receptor-expressing SK-N-MC celts were<br>
	homogenized in 20 mM TrisHCl/0.5 mM EDTA. Supernatsnts from an 600 g<br>
	spin were collected, recentrifuged at 30,000 g for 30 min. Pellets were re-<br>
	homogenized in 50 mM Tris/5 mM EDTA (pH 7.4). Membranes were<br>
15	incubated with 0.8 nU {3H}-N-methythistamine plus/minus test compounds for<br>
	45 min at 25 ºC and harvested by rapid filtration over GR/C glass fiber filters<br>
	(pretreated with 0.3 % polyethytenimine) followed by four washes with ice-cold<br>
	buffer. Fillers were dried, added to 4 mL scinfillation cocktail and then counted<br>
	on a liquid scintillation counter. Non-specific binding was defined with 10 mM<br>
20	histamine. The pK1 values were calculated based on a Ka of 800 pM and a<br>
	Iigand concentration ({L}) of 800 pM acoording to the formula:<br>
K1=(LC50)/(1+({L}/(Kd))<br>
