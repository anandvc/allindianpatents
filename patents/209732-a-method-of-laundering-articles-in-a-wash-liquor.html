METHOD OF LAUNDERING ARTICLES IN A<br>
	WASH LIQUOR<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai-400 020, State of Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it<br>
is to be performed	<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
67/MUMNP/2004<br><br>
GRANTED<br>
29-3-2005<br><br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to improved launglry compositions and in particular to those which comprise a peroxygen-based bleaching system.<br>
Background of the Invention;<br>
Bleaching agents are common components of laundry formulations currently available in the marketplace. Typically these include some source of hydrogen peroxide. In many commercial formulations, the hydrogen peroxide is derived from a peroxygen-source such as perborate or percarbonate.<br>
Bleaches attack stains on articles being washed and also attack other coloured materials, such as dyestuffs, which are released into the wash liquor during the wash. 'It is known that the redeposition of these labile dyestuffs and coloured materials derived from stains can reduce the background whiteness of fabrics. In some cases a significant raduction in background whiteness may occur after a single wash.  Thus, the bleaches do not only work on the primary soiling, but also have a secondary benefit in relation of so called dve transfer.<br><br>
Metal catalysis of bleaching agents in laundry processes is well known.  In general, this is perceived as deleterious and steps are taken to remove active metal ions from bleach-containing compositions.  Otherwise, metals can decompose bleaching species in the aqueous phase, thereby rendering the product less effective.  Such steps have included the addition of chelating agents for copper, iron and other metals.<br>
Attempts have been made to use the catalytic properties of metals to advantage, by using them to boost the activity of bleaches.  Many metals have been the subjects of research, with interest being particularly focused on Fe, Co and Mn.<br>
USP 3,156,654; USP 3,532,634; USP 1,192,524 and GB-A-984,459 disclose use of copper salts together with a chelating agent, to improve the efficacy of perborate, percarbonate and hydrogen peroxide bleaches.<br>
It is believed that in these systems, the copper acts as a catalyst for the bleach.  However, the. chelating agent reduces the level of  active copper in the liquid phase thereby preventing unwanted reactions in the wash liquor. The only copper which remains active is that which has been adsorbed onto the article being laundered and more particularly, onto stains.<br>
Modern washing compositions use so-called bleach precursors to improve the performance of hydrogen peroxide. 'TAED'(tetra acetyl ethylene diamine) is a well known bleach precursor which is widely used in laundry formulations.<br><br>
'SNOBS'    (sodium nonanoyl   oxy-benzene  sulphonate)   is  another well-known  and  widely used bleach precursor.<br>
In use,   the precursor  reacts  with an excess of  hydrogen peroxide  to  form a more  reactive  peracid bleach.     Typical   laundry formulations use   an excess  of peroxygen source  with a precursor:peroxygen  source mole   ratio of  at  least  1:3   for SNOBS  and  1:8   for TAED.   TAED,   in reacting with H202 forms  the peracid bleach peracetic  acid and SNOBS  forms   the  peracid   " bleach pernonanoic acid.<br>
In the case  of  TAED  and other  similar precursors,   a  further<br>
reaction between the  excess of H2O2  and the peracid formed<br>
from the precursor   (for example  the peracetic  acid)   is believed to be particularly sensitive  to  the presence  of trace metals.   If  these are present,   the peracid  is  lost  at  a rate which  far outweighs  any benefits due  to  adsorption of the metal--at  the  article  surface.   It  is  therefore commonplace, in such systems  to eliminate  trace metals  by the use of chelating agents.<br>
GB-A-2150944   discloses  a   fabric  washing  detergent composition  designed  for washing  mixed  colours  which comprises  a  peracid  or precursor  thereof,   0.002-2.5%   copper in  the  absence  or  substantial   absence  of  a  sequestrant   which complexes   strongly with  copper.   That  specification  states (see  page   7,   line  28)   that  no  positive  catalysis  of  dye  or stain bleaching,   on  the   abric,   is   observed  from  copper added to  the  wash  solution.<br>
A technical problem which the present patent addresses is concerned with how one should obtain the full benefits of metal  catalysis   in  systems which  contain bleach precursors<br><br><br>
and peroxygen sources, i.e. both reduction of dye transfer and cleaning benefits against stains.<br>
A further technical problem which occurs due to dye transfer is the quenching of fluorescers by  re-deposited dyes. Fluorescers, are typically added to detergent compositions to improve the 'whiteness' of the articles being washed. Even very small amounts of re-deposited dyes can 'quench' the fluorescence and cause a dramatic reduction in the apparent 'whiteness' of the fabric.<br>
Brief Description of the Invention;<br>
We have determined that, with compositions containing a bleach precursor, the presence of uncomplexed copper brings about enhanced bleaching performance both on soiling and on labile dyestuffs and other coloured materials.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a detergent composition which comprises a surfactant, a builder, a fluorescer, a source of hydrogen peroxide, and either:<br>
a)	a bleach precursor which reacts with hydrogen peroxide to form a peracid, or,<br>
b)	a peracid<br>
and a copper-binding species which is deactivated by calcium salts, wherein the composition is essentially free of other copper binding species.<br><br><br>
The invention further provides a method of laundering articles which comprises the step of treating said articles with a detergent composition which comprises a surfactant, a builder, a fluorescer a source of hydrogen peroxide, and either:<br>
a)	a bleach precursor which reacts with hydrogen peroxide to form a peracid, or<br>
b)	a peracid<br>
and a  copper-binding  species  which  is  deactivated by calcium salts,   wherein the  composition is  essentially free of other copper binding species.<br>
By   'essentially free of   copper binding  species'   is  meant   that  the  logk (stability constant)   of  any complex that has  the potential  to form between components  of  the composition and  copper  is   less   than  10.<br>
Preferably,   the  ratio of precursor to peroxygen  source  in the composition is  1:0.5N to  1:2N where N is  the  number of moles  of peracid derived  from a mole  of precursor.   For laundry formulations  according to  the present  invention  the precursor :peroxygen-source  mole  ratios  will   be   1:0.5   to  1:2 <br><br>
for SNOBS and 1:1 to 1:4 for TAED.	<br>
In those embodiments comprising a peracid or a salt thereof (an example of which is mono-persulphate) N is effectively 1, and it is preferred that the precursor(i.e. peracid):peroxygen-source mole ratios will be 1: 
<br><br>
It is preferable	that the level of copper in the wash liquor is at least<br>
0.00lppm.  While	it is also preferable that the level of copper in the<br>
wash liquor does	not exceed 1ppm this level may be exceeded in locations<br>
where the supply	of water contains high levels of copper.<br>
Beneficially, it is not necessary to add copper ss such to the  formulation, as sufficient copper may be present in the laundry liquor. This copper may come, for example, from piping through which the water has passed or from dyes and/or stains.<br>
  Alternatively, copper salts or complexes may be added to the<br>
 composition.  Suitable complexing agents include sodium tri-<br>
I<br>
 polyphosphate.     These materials bind  strongly to hardness<br>
 ions  and therefore cease  to be copper binding  species  once<br>
  the  composition comes   into contact  with water  containing<br>
significant  levels of  calcium and/or magnesium.<br>
   Preferred complexes"are  those where the  difference  in  log  K between calcium and copper complexes   is  less  than 5.<br>
It   is preferable  that  the wash  is  performed  at a temperature of  3 0 Celsius  or less.   Such washing  conditions  are  commonplace   in  some regions,   particularly in  the Southern.Hemisphere.<br>
The   compositions   according  to  the   invention  further  comprise one  or more  fluorescent   'whitening'   agents.<br>
It   is  believed  that   the  compositions   of  the present invention  are  sufficiently  effective   at preventing  soil/dye transfer,   that   they  significantly  reduce  quenching  of   the fluorescer by  said  soils/dyes.<br><br><br>

Peroxygen Source and Bleach Precursors:<br>
As noted above the compositions of the invention comprise a source of hydrogen peroxide in combination with either a peroxyacid/peracid bleach precursor or_a peracid per se.<br>
Hydrogen peroxide sources are well known in the art.  They include the inorganic peroxides, for example alkali metal peroxides, organic peroxides for example as urea peroxide, and inorganic persalts, such as the alkali metal perborates, percarbonates, perphosphates, persilicates and persulphates. Mixtures of two or more such compounds may also be suitable.<br>
Compositions of the invention also either comprise a bleach precursor which can react with hydrogen peroxide to form a peracid or a peracid as such.<br>
Typical levels of peroxygen sources in fully formulated composition will range from 0.05 to 55 wt.% with 0.25% to 40 wt.% being particularly preferred and 0.1% to 25 wt.% being most particularly preferred.<br>
The most preferred peroxygen sources include percarbonates and perborates.  These are both believed to form H202 in the presence of water.<br>
We particularly prefer that the composition comprises an alkali metal percarbonate, preferably sodium percarbonate, as a source of hydrogen peroxide.  Also preferred are sodium perborate tetrahydrate and, especially, sodium perborate monohydrate. Sodium perborate monohydrate is preferred<br><br><br>
because of its high active oxygen content Sodium percarbonate may also be preferred for environmental reasons.<br>
Another suitable hydrogen peroxide source is a combination<br>
of a C1-C4 alkanol oxidase and a C1-C4 alkanol, especially a<br>
combination of methanol oxidase (MOX) and ethanol. Such combinations are disclosed in WO-A-9507972, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Alkylhydroxy peroxides are another class of peroxide source. Examples of these materials include cumene hydroperoxide and t-buty1 hydroperoxide.<br>
In addition to the peroxygen source, compositions according to the invention also comprise either a peroxyacid/peracid or a precursor thereof.<br>
Suitable organic peroxyacids have the general formula:<br><br>
wherein R is an alkyl- or alkylidene- or substituted alkylene group containing from 1 to about 2 0 carbon atoms, optionally having an internal amide linkage; or a phenylene or substituted phenylene group; and Y is hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, aryl, an imido-aromatic or non-aromatic group, a -COOH or -COOOH group or a quaternary ammonium group.<br><br><br>
Typical monoperoxy acids useful herein incJLude, for example:<br>
(i)     peroxybenzoic acid and ring-substituted<br>
peroxybenzoic acids, e.g. peroxy-a-naphthoic acid;<br>
(ii)    aliphatic, substituted aliphatic and arylalkyl monoperoxyacids, e.g. peroxylauric acid, peroxystearic acid and N,N-phthaloylaminoperoxy caproic acid (PAP); and<br>
(iii)   6-octylamino-6-oxo-peroxyhexanoic acid.<br>
Typical diperoxyacids useful herein include,  for example:<br>
(i)     1,12-diperoxydodecanedioic acid (DPDA);<br>
(ii)    1,9-diperoxyazelaic acid;<br>
(iii) • diperoxybrassylic acid; diperoxysebacic acid and diperoxyisophthalic acid;<br>
(iv)    2-decyldiperoxybutane-l,4-dioic acid; and<br>
(v)     4,4'-sulphonylbisperoxybenzoic acid.<br>
Also inorganic peroxyacid compounds are suitable, such as for example potassium monopersulphate (MPS). If organic or inorganic peroxyacids are used, the amount thereof will normally be within the range of about 0.2-10 % by weight, preferably from 0.4-8 % by weight.<br><br><br>
'Bleach precursors' suitable for use in the compositions of the present invention form a peracid in the presence of H202. These compounds are well-known and amply described in literature, such as in GB-A-836988; GB-A-864,798; DB-A-907,356; GB-A-1,003,310 and GB-A-1,519,351;  DE-.A-3,337,921; EP-A-0 , 185 , 522 ; EP-A-0 , 174 , 132 ; EP-A-0,120,591; and US-A-1,246,339; US-A-3,332,882; US-A-4,128,494; US-A-4,412,934 and US-A-4,675,393.<br>
Another useful class of bleach precursors is that of the cationic i.e. quaternary ammonium-substituted precursors as disclosed in US-A-4,751,015 and US-A-4,397,757, in EP-A-0,284,292 and EP-A-331,229.  Examples of bleach precursors of this class are:<br>
2-(N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium) ethyl sodium-4-sulphophenyl carbonate chloride - (SPCC);<br>
N-octyl,N,N-dimethyl-Nio-carbophenoxy decyl ammonium<br>
chloride - (ODC);<br>
3-(N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium) propyl sodium-4-sulphophenyl carboxylate; and<br>
N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium toluyloxy benzene sulphonate.<br>
A further special class of bleach precursors is formed by the cationic nitriles as disclosed in EP-A-303,520; EP-A-458,396 and EP-A-464,880.<br>
Of bleach precursors, the preferred classes are the esters, including acyl phenol sulphonates and acyl alkyl phenol sulphonates; the acyl-amides; and the quaternary ammonium<br><br><br>
substituted peroxyacid precursors including the cationic nitriles.<br>
Examples of preferred peroxyacid bleach precursors or activators are sodium-4-benzoyloxy benzene sulphonate (SBOBS) ; N,N,N'N' -tetraacetyl ethylene diamine (TAED) ,-sodium-1-methyl-2-benzoyloxy benzene-4-sulphonate; sodium-4-methyl-3-benzoloxy benzoate; 2-(N,N,N-trimethy1 ammonium) ethyl sodium-4-sulphophenyl carbonate chloride (SPCC); trimethyl ammonium toluyloxy-benzene sulphonate; sodium nonanoyloxybenzene sulphonate (SNOBS); sodium 3,5,5-trimethyl hexanoyl-oxybenzene sulphonate (STHOBS); and the substituted cationic nitriles.<br>
Of the peracid precursors, TAED and SNOBS preferred. As noted above these react with H2O2 to form the peracids peracetic and pernonanoic respectively which materials react with further H2O2 in the presence of uncomplexed copper to form active oxygen bleaching species.<br>
The precursors are typically used in an amount of up to 12%, preferably from 0.2-10%, by weight of the composition.<br><br><br>
the copper might bring about degradation of the bleacning system.<br>
Advantageously, this binding agent should be deactivated (as regards copper) during the wash and this can be achieved by using a binding agent which binds more strongly to calcium (present in the wash liquor) than to copper.<br>
As mentioned above, phosphate is a suitable binding agent and advantageously is already present in many formulations as a builder (in the form of sodium tripolyphosphate). Nitrilotriacetic Acid (NTA)is another binding agent which can complex with copper but which would be deactivated in the presence of significant levels of calcium.<br>
Calcium is of course a commonplace water hardness ion and would be present in the wash liquor. Thus, when the compositions of the invention are being stored any copper ions present in the composition are effectively deactivated by the binding agent. On addition to water containing hardness ions, the binding agent releases the copperas it binds preferentially to the hardness ions (calcium). The copper is then free to catalyse the bleaching reaction.<br><br><br>
does not have a`1 strong affinity for copper. Generally, such dye-transfer inhibiting agents include polyvinyl pyrrolidone polymers, polyamine N-oxide polymers, copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole, N-carboxymethyl-4-vinylpyridinium polymers, manganese pthalocyanine, peroxidases, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The nitrogen-containing, dye binding, polymers are preferred.<br>

Preferred polyamine N-oxides are those wherein R is a heterocyclic group such as pyridine, pyrrole, imidazole, pyrrolidine, piperidine and derivatives thereof. The N-0 group can be represented by the following general<br>
structures: N(0) (R')o-3 , or =N(0) (R') 0-1 , wherein each R'<br>
independently represents an aliphatic, aromatic, heterocyclic or alicylic group or combination thereof. The nitrogen of the N-0 group can be attached or form part of<br><br><br>
any of the aforementioned groups.  The amine oxide unit of the polyamine N-oxides has 'a pKa
Any polymer backbone can be used provided the amine oxide polymer formed is water-soluble and has dye transfer inhibiting properties.  Examples of suitable polymeric backbones are polyvinyls, polyalkylenes, polyesters, polyethers, polyamides, polyimides, polyacrylates and mixtures thereof.  These polymers include random or block copolymers where one monomer type is an amine N-oxide and the other monomer type is an N-oxide.  The amine N-oxide polymers typically have a ratio of amine to the amine N-oxide of 10:1 to 1:1,000,000.  However, the number of amine oxide groups present in the polyamine oxide polymer can be varied by appropriate copolymerization or by an appropriate degree of N-oxidation.  The polyamine oxides can be obtained in almost any degree of polymerization. Typically, the average molecular weight is within the range of 500 to 1,000,000; more preferably 1,000 to 500,000; most preferably 5,000 to 100,000.  This preferred class of materials is referred to herein as "PVPy-NO".  A preferred polyamine N-oxide is poly(4-vinylpyridine-N-oxide) which as an average molecular weight of about 50,000 and an amine to amine N-oxide ratio of about 1:4.<br>
Block or random copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole polymers (as  a class,   referred to as "PVP/PVI") are also preferred.  Preferably the PVP/PVI has an average molecular weight range from 5,000 to 1,000,000, more preferably from 5,000 to 200,000, and most preferably .<br><br>
from 10,000 to 20,000, as determined by light scattering as described in Barth, et al., Chemical Analysis,'Vol. 113. "Modern Methods of Polymer Characterization").<br>
The preferred PVP/PVI copolymers typically have a molar-ratio.of N-vinylimidazole to N-vinylpyrrolidone from 1:1 to 0.2:1, more preferably from 0.8:1 to 0.3:1, most preferably from 0.6:1 to 0.4:1.  These copolymers can be either linear or branched. Suitable PVP/PVI polymers include Sokalan(TM) HP56, available commercially from BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany.<br>
Also preferred as dye transfer inhibition agents are polyvinylpyrrolidone polymers ("PVP") having an average molecular weight of from about 5,000 to about 400,000, preferably from about 5,000 to about 200,000, and more preferably from about 5,000 to about 50,000.  PVP's are disclosed for example in EP-A-262,897 and EP-A-256,696.<br>
Suitable PVP polymers include Sokalan(TM) HP50, available commercially from BASF.  Compositions containing PVP can also contain polyethylene glycol ("PEG") having an average molecular weight from about 500 to about 100,000, preferably from about 1,000 to about 10,000.  Preferably, the ratio of PEG to PVP on a ppm basis delivered in wash solutions is from about 2:1 to about 50:1, and more preferably from about 3:1 to about 10:1.<br>
Also suitable as dye transfer inhibiting agents are those from the class of modified polyethyleneimine polymers, as disclosed for example in<br><br><br><br><br>
Preferably the composition according to the present invention comprises a dye transfer inhibition agent selected from polyvinylpyrridine N-oxide (PVPy-NO), polyvinyl pyrrol.idone (PVP) ,  polyvinyl imidazole,<br>
N-carboxymethyl-4-vinylpyridinium, N-vinylpyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole copolymers (PVP/PVI), copolymers thereof, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The amount of dye transfer inhibition agent in the composition according to the present invention will be from 0.01 to 10 %, preferably from 0.02 to 5 %, more preferably from 0'.03 to 2 %, by weight of the composition.<br>
Surfactants and Builders:<br>
The composition may contain a surface-active material in an amount, for example, from 5 to 50% by weight.<br>
Certain surface active agents should preferably be avoided in compositions of the invention. These are the ones that can complex with copper. Soap is one such surfactant, but it is believed that its effects may be mitigated in a well-built system.<br><br>
The surface-active material may comprise a synthetic material selected from anionic, nonionic, amphoteric, zwitterionic, cationic actives and mixtures thereof.  Many suitable actives are commercially available and are fully described in the literature, for example in "Surface Active Agents and Detergents", Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry and Berch.<br>
Typical synthetic anionic surface-actives are usually water-soluble alkali metal salts of organic sulphates and sulphonates having alkyl -groups containing from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms, the term "alkyl" being used to include the alkyl portion of higher aryl groups.<br>
Examples of suitable synthetic anionic detergent compounds are sodium and ammonium alkyl sulphates, especially those<br>
obtained by sulphating higher (C8-C18) alcohols produced, for<br>
example, from tallow or coconut oil; sodium and ammonium<br>
alkyl (C9-C20) benzene sulphonates, particularly sodium<br>
linear secondary alkyl (C10-Cis) benzene sulphonates; sodium alkyl glyceryl ether sulphates, especially those ethers of the higher alcohols derived from tallow or coconut oil fatty acid monoglyceride sulphates and sulphonates; sodium and<br>
ammonium salts of sulphuric acid esters of higher (C9-C18)<br>
fatty alcohol alkylene oxide, particularly ethylene oxide, reaction products; the reaction products of fatty acids such as  coconut   fatty acids  esterified  with  isethionic acid and neutralised with sodium hydroxide; sodium and ammonium salts of fatty acid amides of methyl taurine; alkane monosulphonates such as those derived by reacting alpha-<br><br>
olefins (C8-C20) with sodium bisulphite and those derived by reacting paraffins with SO2  and C12 and then hydrolysing with a base to produce a random sulphonate; sodium and ammonium (C7-C12) dialkyl sulphosuccinates; and olefin sulphonates, which term is used to describe material made by reacting olefins, particularly (C10-C20) alpha-olefins, with SO3 and then neutralising and hydrolysing the reaction product.  The preferred anionic detergent compounds are sodium (C10-C15) alkylbenzene sulphonates (C10-C15 LAS), and<br>
sodium (C16-C18). alkyl ether sulphates (C16-C18 LES) .<br>
Examples of suitable nonionic surface-active compounds which may be used, preferably together with the anionic surface active compounds, include, in particular, the reaction products of alkylene oxides, usually ethylene oxide, with<br>
alkyl (C6-C22) phenols, generally 5-25 EO, i.e. 5-25 units of ethylene oxides per molecule; and the condensation products of aliphatic (C8-C18) primaryor secondary. linear or branched alcohols with ethylene oxide, generally 2-30 EO.  Other so-called nonionic surface-actives include alkyl polyglycosides, sugar esters, long-chain tertiary amine oxides, long-chain tertiary phosphine oxides and dialkyl sulphoxides.<br>
Amphoteric or zwitterionic surface-active compounds can also be used in the compositions of the invention but this is not normally desired owing to their relatively high cost.  If any amphoteric or zwitterionic detergent compounds are used,<br><br>
it is generally in small amounts in compositions based on the much more commonly used synthetic anionic and nonionic actives.<br>
The composition will preferably comprise from 1 to 30%wt of anionic surfactant and from 0 to 4 0 %wt of nonionic surfactant.  Preferred classes of formulations comprise 10-30%wt of anionic surfactant, particularly around 6%wt, and up to l%wt of nonionic surfactant.<br>
Another preferred embodiments of the present invention comprise a mixed active system which comprises significant amounts of both anionic and nonionic surfactants.  Where nitrogen-containing, dye binding, DTI polymers are used, the effectiveness of these polymers is reduced at high levels of anionic surfactant.<br>
It is preferable that the level of anionic surfactant (on total surfactant) ranges from 10-90%wt and that the level of nonionic ranges from 90-10%wt (on total surfactant). It is especially preferred, when DTI polymers are present, to use 3 0-60%wt/surfactant of anionic surfactant selected from: LAS, PAS, and mixtures thereof, together with 70-40%wt/surfactant of ethoxylated alcohol nonionic surfactant.<br>
The composition may also contain a detergency builder, for example in an amount of from about 5 to. 80 % by weight, preferably from about 10 +to 60 % by weight.<br><br><br>
Builder materials may be selected from 1) calcium<br>
sequestrant materials, 2) precipitating materials,<br>
3) calcium ion-exchange materials and 4) mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of calcium sequestrant builder materials include alkali metal polyphosphates, such as sodium tripolyphosphate and organic sequestrants, such as ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid.<br>
Examples of precipitating builder materials include sodium orthophosphate and sodium carbonate.<br>
Examples of calcium ion-exchange builder materials include the various types of water-insoluble crystalline or amorphous aluminosilicates, of which zeolites are the best known, representatives, e.g. zeolite A, zeolite B (also known as zeolite P), zeolite C, zeolite X, zeolite Y and also the zeolite P-type as described in EP-A-0,384,070.<br>
In particular, the composition may contain any one of the organic and inorganic builder materials, though, for environmental reasons, phosphate builders are preferably omitted or only used in very small amounts.<br>
Apart from the components already ment+ioned, the composition can contain any of the conventional additives in amounts of which such materials are normally employed in fabric washing detergent compositions.  These include, fluorescent agents; perfumes; enzymes, such as proteases, cellulases, lipases, amylases and oxidases; germicides and colourants.  However, care should again be taken not to include materials which<br><br>
have a . significant copper complexing ability.  As will be seen from the examples below, certain anti-redeposition agents such as CP5 need to be excluded from formulations.<br>
The present invention may be conveniently embodied in a solid form of product, which includes both a powder or tablet form of product. Both of these forms may be homogeneous or non-homogeneous. For example tablets may comprise a plurality of discrete regions which include some ingredients only, while powders may comprise mixed, granules of differing compositions.<br>
In order that the present invention may be further and better understood it is described below with reference to non-limiting examples.<br>
Examples:<br>
In examples 1 &amp; 2 fabrics were measured after washing on an ICS Texicon Spectraflash 500 ™ which was calibrated using the following settings:<br>
UV Excluded - 42 0nm cutoff Specular Included Large Area View<br>
Each monitor was measured through four thicknesses of cloth with the unwashed white fabric as the reference standard. Each monitor was measured twice and the average of these measurements was taken to be the value of that monitor.<br><br><br>
Reflectance values were taken and converted into delta E values using the 40ptspec analysis programme.<br>
In example 3 all fabrics were measured after washing on a Datacolour™ SF600 Plus Spectraflash™ which was calibrated using the following settings:<br>
UV Excluded - 420nm cutoff Specular Included Large (30mm) aperture<br>
Each monitor was measured through one thickness of cloth with the white tile as the reference standard. Each monitor was measured four times and the average of these four measurements was taken to be the value of that monitor.<br>
LabCH value's were taken and converted into delta E values by-calculating the difference in L, a and b between the after wash measurements and those of an identical white cloth which had not been washed and then applying the equation:<br><br>
The average delta E was calculated from series of results.<br>
Example 1: Copper in Zeolite formulations;<br>
Table 1 shows the formulations of shaker-bath dye-transfer experiments (100Hz, 40 C, 30 mins) in lOOmls of a washing solution (0.434g/L LAS, 0.35g/L Synperonic A7 Nonionic,<br><br><br>
1.48g/L Zeolite MAP, 0.5g/L sodium carbonate) with the additions shown (in g/L). 'Bleach' is sodium percarbonate. 0.2mls of a 1 g/L solution of dye was added with one 13cm x 13cm piece of ECE desized mercerised non-fluorescent cotton sheeting. This was rinsed in demineralised water and tumble dried.<br>
Copper, as required, was added as copper sulphate pentahydrate {lppm =3.93 mg/L).<br>
Table 2 shows the results of the dye transfer experiments (as delta E) using the dyes listed and compositions A-E.<br><br>
Table 1<br><br><br>
Table 2<br><br>
From Table 2 it can be seen that copper shows excellent activity against most of the dyes.  While PVP and copper all show some activity against most dyes, the combination of the two shows excellent activity against all of the dyes.<br>
Example 2: Copper in STP formulations:<br>
Table 3 shows the formulations of shaker-bath dye-transfer<br>
experiments (100Hz, 40 C, 30 mins) in 100mls of a washing<br>
solution (0.5 g/L LAS (Petrelab 550), 0.35g/L Nonionic (Synperonic A7), 0.87g/L STP, 0.522g/L sodium carbonate) with the additions shown, (in g/L).  The formulations also contained 0.154g/L TAED, 1.4g/L Na perborate tetrahydrate. 0.2mls of a 1 g/L solution of dyes as listed was added with 1 13cm x 13cm piece of ECE desized mercerised<br><br><br>
non-fluorescent cotton sheeting.  This was rinsed in denaineralised water and tumble dried.  Copper was added as copper sulphate penta-hydrate (lppm = 3.93 rng/L) .<br>
Table 4 shows the results of the dye transfer experiments (as delta E) using the dyes listed and compositions A,-B and<br>
Table  4<br><br><br>
Table  3<br><br><br>
From Table 4 it can be seen that the copper gives some benefit, but that this is less of a benefit than with the zeolite-based formulations. This is believed to be due to the presence of the STP which has some ability to complex with copper.<br>
Example 3: Copper in fully formulated products:<br>
Washing experiments were performed in Brazilian washing machines, with a 40 minute soak, and a 14 minute wash in 2 5°C water of 6  degrees French hardness.  This was followed by  1 rinse and tumble drying. Washes were done with 4 5 litre wash volume, 1.8g/L product, and 1 - 5kg of load. The fabric used was 1200g non-mercerised white cotton sheeting as ballast and one knitted white cotton t-shirt which had been stained. Two sets of stain monitors were pinned to mercerised cotton "backing pieces. Stain removal and pickup on both the ballast and the backing pieces was measured. The values quoted are relative to a white tile standard. UV was excluded in the measurements.<br>
Results are shown in Table 5. In the-case where TAED/perborate (comparative) was added, a 1:7.5 ratio of TAED:perborate was used; for TAED/perborate plus copper (embodiment), a 1:3 ratio was used together with lppm copper sulphate.<br>
From the results it can be seen that the use of copper significantly reduces the .background greying which occurs when an article is washed in the product. This reduction is not achieved with TAED/Perborate alone.  It can also be seen<br><br><br>
that  while  TAED/perborate  has  an effect   on  some   stains   it   is by no  means  effective  on  all  of   them.   In  some   cases   (marked '*')    after  addition of   TAED/perborate   the  results  are  worse than  if  no bleach had been  added.     The  addition  of  copper corrects  this  deficiency.<br>
When viewed in natural  light,   the whites  washed in  copper   look brilliantly white   in comparison to OMO MA and 0M0 MA/TAED/Perborate.   It is believed that   this  is  because  the  fluorescer  is  not  quenched by re-deposited stain.<br>
Table   5<br><br>
Example 4: Anti-redeposition in Brazilian washing machines<br>
Washing experiments were performed in Brazilian washing machines (Brastemp™ Clean machines), with a 3 0 minute soak,<br>
and a 15 minute wash in 25 C water of 2 degrees French<br>
hardness. This was followed by 1 rinse and tumble drying.<br><br><br>
Washes-• were done with 41 litres wash volume, 1. Sg/L product, and 1.5kg of load. The fabric used was 750g fluorescent non-mercerised white cotton sheeting and 750g non-fluorescent mercerised white cotton sheeting as ballast (of which six pieces were used as pick-up monitors). One or two sets of stain monitors were added in with the load. Pickup on the ballast was measured. The values quoted are relative to a white tile standard. UV was included in the measurements. Three replicate loads were washed per condition. One wash was performed per load. Stains used were 2 x annato/oil, tumeric/oil, mustard, curry paste, elefante tomato paste, blue Parker Quink permanent for high stain conditions and lx each for low stain conditions.  Ganz whiteness results were obtained (7:1 molar ratio Perborate/TAED).  Higher Ganz values are indicative of whiter cloth. Results are given in Table 6 below.<br>
Table 6<br><br>
Example 5;  Anti-redeposition in Tergometer™<br>
One wash was performed for each condition at 1 wash per load.  Washes used 20g fabric, 1 litre of water, 1.8g/L<br><br>
product (Brilhante/Ace). The Tergometer™ was operated at 90rpm, using a 30 min soak, 15 min wash, 2x2 min rinse and then the product was tumble dried.  Mercerised non-fluorescent cotton was used as pickup monitor (4 pieces per condition).  High stain conditions used 2 x annato/oil (lmL on 10x10cm cotton).  Low stain conditions used 1 x annato/oil.  Ganz whiteness results were obtained.  In this example there was a 7:1 molar ratio Perborate/TAED.  Results are given in Table 7.<br>
Table 7<br><br>
Example 6; Anti-redeposition in Linetester™<br>
One wash was performed for each condition at 1 wash per load.  Washes used 8.5g fabric, 0.212 litre of water, 1.8g/L product (Brilhante/Ace). The Tergometer™ was operated at 90rpm, using a 30 min soak, 15 min wash, 2x2 min rinse and then the product was tumble dried.  Mercerised non-fluorescent cotton was used as pickup monitor (4 pieces per condition).  Stain conditions used 1 x annato/oil (0.5mL on 10x10cm cotton).  Low stain conditions used 1 x annato/oil.  Ganz whiteness results were obtained.  Results are given in Table 8.<br><br><br>

Example 7: Anti-redeposition in Tergometer.<br>
One wash was performed for each condition at 1 wash per load.  Washes used 20g .fabric, 1 litre of water, 1. Sg/L product (Brilhante).  The Tergometer™ was operated at 90rpm, using a 30 min soak, 15 min wash, 2x2 min rinse and then the product was tumble dried.  Mercerised non-fluorescent cotton was used as pickup monitor (4 pieces per condition) .<br><br><br>
Stain conditions used 1 x annato/oil (lmju .)n 10x10cm cotton).  Results are given in Tables 9a and 9b.<br>
