TEMPERATURE SENSOR CONFIGURATION<br>
DETECTION IN PROCESS VARIABLE TRANSMITTER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to process variable transmitters used in process control and monitoring systems. More specifically, the present invention relates to the termination of the configuration or orientation of a temperature sensor coupled to a process variable transmitter.<br>
Process control transmitters are used to measure process parameters in a process control system. Microprocessor-based transmitters include a sensor, an analog-to-digital converter for converting an output from a sensor into a digital format, a microprocessor for compensating the digitized output and an output circuit for transmitting the compensated output. Typically, this transmission is over a process control loop, such as a 4-20 mA current loop. One example parameter is temperature which is sensed by measuring the resistance of an RTD (Resistive Temperature Device), also called a PRT (Platinum Resistance Thermometer) sensor, or a voltage output of a thermocouple sensor.<br>
Temperature is measured by converting the sensory output (resistance to voltage) to an output indicative of temperature of the sensor. However, in order for the process variable transmitter to obtain the desired measurement, the circuitry of the transmitter must be properly configured. For example, some RTD sensors use a four wire Kelvin connection while other sensors use a three wire connection. Similarly, although thermocouples typically use only two wires, there is a polarity between the two wires. It is known to detect whether a RTD utilizes three or four wires (see, for example, the STT 3000 Smart Temperature Transmitter, model STT 350 Operator Manual). However, the RTD must still be coupled in a known manner. This can be either in a predetermined manner or in a manner which is identified using some type of user input.<br>
SUMMARY<br><br><br>

The present invention is directed to a process variable transmitter which is configured to identify the configuration or orientation of a temperature sensor which is coupled to the device. Examples include identification of a two, three or four wire RTD, the position or location of an RTD element between the terminals of the transmitter, or the position or polarity orientation of a thermocouple.<br>
Figure lA is a block diagram of temperature transmitter 10 connected to measure temperature with an RTD sensor.<br>
Transmitter 10 couples to process control loop 11 which provides power to transmitter 10 and over which information is transmitted and received. Alternatively, process control loop 11 may employ various wireless techniques or configurations. In this embodiment, transmitter 10 preferably includes terminal block 14 having terminals 1 through 4 for coupling to, for example, an RTD temperature sensor 16 or a thermocouple temperature sensor 18 (shown in Figure IB). Figure lA shows the electrical connections to RTD 16. Sensor 16 (and sensor 18) can be either internal or external to transmitter 10. Transmitter 10 includes multiplexer 20 controlled by microprocessor 22 which is coupled to control loop 11 through input/output (I/O) circuitry 24. Muhiplexer 20 multiplexes appropriate sets of analog signals, including signals from terminals 1 through 4, to positive and negative inputs of differential amplifier 26, which connects to high accuracy A/D converter 28. Memory 30 stores instructions and information for microprocessor 22, which operates at a speed determined by clock 32. Multiplexer 20 selectively connect input pairs to the positive and<br>
4<br><br>
negative inputs of differential amplifier 26. A reference resistance RI^EF 38 couples to multiplexer 20 and is connected in series with RTD 16. .<br>
In operation, transmitter 10 measures temperature of sensor 16 and transmits a representation of temperature over control loop 11. Transmitter 10 employs the following equation to compute the major value of temperature of RTD \6:<br>
  Equation 1<br>
where:<br>
R-REFNOM the nominal resistance of the reference resistance in ohms,<br>
and/or stored in memory 30;<br>
VRINPUT voltage drop across the input; and<br>
VRREF voltage drop across RREF-Current source 50 provides current Is through sensor 16 (via terminals 1 and 4) and reference resistor 38 through MUX 20. In the configuration of Figure I A, microprocessor 22 measures the voltage drop (VRINPUT) across RTD 16 between terminals 2 and 3, and the voltage drop (VRREF) across resistor 38 with MUX 20. R-REFNOM is a calculation constant and is retrieved from memory 30. In a four-wire resistance measurement such as this, the voltage drop across the connections to terminals 2 and 3 is largely eliminated, because substantially all the current flows between terminals 1 and 4, and has little impact on the accuracy of the measurement. RINPUT is converted to temperature units with a look-up table or suitable equation stored in memory 30.<br>
In the configuration Figure IB, transmitter 10 is connected to measure temperature with thermocouple sensor 18 which creates a voltage VJCINPUT across terminals 1 and 2. Multiplexer 20 couples inputs of differential amplifier 26 to terminals 2 and 1. Figure IB shows a voltage reference (VTCREF) 36 coupled to MUX 20 and current source 50.    A heater 41  is provided for<br>
5<br><br>
determining the orientation of thermocouple sensor 18 as discussed below. Heater 41 is controlled by microprocessor 22.<br>
Transmitter 10 measures the temperature of thermocouple sensor 18 by determining the thermocouple voltage Vjc with the following equation:<br>
  Equation 2<br>
where:<br>
VTCINPUT ^the measured voltage across terminals 1 and 2 of terminal block 14 sensed by amplifier 26;<br>
VTCREF =the measured voltage generated by voltage reference 36 as sensed by amplifier 26;<br>
VjcREFNOM ^a nominal value of voltage reference 36 stored in memory<br>
30;<br>
The temperature sensors 16 and 18 illustrated in Figures lA and IB are typically connected to the transmitter 10 when the transmitter 10 is located in the field. Thus, the operator that connects the temperature sensor 16, 18 to transmitter 10 may couple the leads of the sensor 16, 18 to any one of the four terminals 1, 2, 3 and 4. However, for the microprocessor 22 to obtain accurate temperature measurements, the orientation and configuration of the leads of the sensor 16, 18 must be known. This can, for example, require that the sensor be connected to the transmitter at a particular orientation. Alternatively, information can be input to the transmitter 10 which instructs the microprocessor 22 regarding the orientation of the sensor 16, 18. With the present invention, the microprocessor 22 performs a number of tests on the sensor 16, 18 in order to determine the configuration and orientation of the sensor.<br>
Figure 2A is a flow chart 100 showing steps in accordance with the present invention and Figures 2B, 2C and 2D are show example configurations<br>

of the sensor 16 of the RTD sensor 16 coupled to transmitter 10. Further, the following table, Table 1 shows three cases regarding the resistance measured between pairs of terminals T12 is between terminals 1 and 2, T13 is between terminals 1 and 3 and T14 is between terminals 1 and 4.<br>

Assumption; SÂ»L Flow chart 100 is initiated by measuring the resistance between terminals 1 and 2. If an open circuit is determined, microprocessor 22 determines that the sensor 16 is not a four-wire sensor and that terminal 1 or terminal 2 is not used. Alternatively, the resistance between terminals 1 and 2 are stored in memory and another measurement between terminals 1 and 3 is obtained. If this measurement indicates that the connection is an open circuit, then the microprocessor 22 determines that the sensor is not a four-wire sensor and that terminal 3 is not in use. Alternatively, the resistance between terminals 1 and 3 is stored in memory. Next, the resistance between terminals 1 and 4 is measured. If this resistance indicates an open circuit, then the microprocessor 22 determines that the sensor 16 is not a four-wire sensor and that terminal 4 is not in use. Alternatively, the resistance between terminals 1 and 4 is stored in memory. Based upon the measured resistances, the location of the sensor 16 (Case 1, Case 2 or Case 3 as illustrated in Figures 2B, 2C and 2D, respectively) is determined based upon information in Table 1 above.<br><br>
Figure 3A is a flow chart 120 showing subsequent steps performed by microprocessor 22 in determining the location of sensor 16 and Figures 3B, 3C and 3D show cases 4, 5 and 6 respectively, of the orientation sensor 16 as set forth in Table 2:<br><br>
Flow chart 120 begins with microprocessor 22 measuring determining that the terminal 1 or terminal 2 is not used. Next, the resistance between terminals 1 and 3 is measured. If this is an open circuit, then terminal 1 is not used or sensor is not a three wire sensor. Alternatively, the resistance between terminals 1 and 3 is stored in memory. Next, microprocessor 22 measures the resistance between terminals 1 and 4. If this is an open circuit, microprocessor 22 determines that the sensor 16 is a two wire sensor connected between terminals 1 and 3. Alternatively, the resistance between terminals 1 and 4 is stored in memory. Finally, microprocessor 22 identifies the location of sensor 16 based upon the data collected and the information shown in Table 2 above.<br>
Figure 4A is a flow chart 140 showing subsequent steps performed by microprocessor 22 and Figures 4B, 4C and 4D show cases 7, 8 and 9 respectively, of the orientation of the sensor 16 based upon data contained in Table 3:<br><br><br>
In flow chart 140 begins with microprocessor 22 having determined that terminal 1 is not used. Next, the resistance between terminals 2 and 3 is measured. If this indicates an open circuit, then the sensor is not a three wire sensor but is a two wire sensor coupled between terminal 2 and 4 or between terminals 3 and 4. Alternatively, data related to the resistances is stored in memory. Next, microprocessor 22 measures the resistance between terminals 2 and 4. If this resistance indicates an open circuit, then the sensor is a two wire sensor connected between terminals 2 and 3. Alternatively, the resistance between terminals 2, 3, and 4 is stored in memory. Finally, the microprocessor identifies the location of the sensor 16 based upon information contained in Table 3 above.<br>
Figure 5A is a flow chart 160 showing subsequent steps performed by microprocessor 22 and Figures 5B, 5C and 5D show cases 10, 11 and 12, respectively regarding the configuration of sensor 16 as illustrated in Table 4:<br><br><br><br>
S = Sensor (ohms) Assumption: SÂ»L<br>
Flow chart 160 is initiated when it is determined that terminal 3 is not used. Next, the resistance between terminals 1 and 4 is measured. If this is an open circuit, then microprocessor 22 determines that sensor 16 is a two-wire sensor connected between terminals 1 and 2. Alternatively, the resistance is stored and microprocessor 22 calculates the sensor location based upon the data contained in Table 4 above.<br>
Figure 6A is a flow chart 180 illustrating steps in accordance with the present invention when terminal 4 is not used. Figure 6B, 6C and 6D illusti'ate possible cases 13, 14 and 15 regarding the location of sensor 16 as set forth in Tables:<br><br>
In flow chart 180, the microprocessor 22 calculates the location of sensor 16 based upon data stored in Table 5 above.<br>
Figure 7 is a flow chart 200 illustrating steps performed by microprocessor 22 if it is determined that the sensor 16 is a two wire sensor between terminals 2 and 4 or between terminals 3 and 4. Microprocessor 22 measures the resistance between terminals 2 and 4. If this is not an open circuit, then the sensor is a two wire sensor connected between terminals 2 and 4.<br><br><br>
Alernatively, microprocessor measures the resistance between terminals 3 and 4. If this is an open circuit, then microprocessor 22 determines that a sensor has not been connected. Alternatively, microprocessor 22 determines that the sensor is a two wire sensor coupled between terminals 3 and 4.<br>
Figure 8A and 8B all relate to the determination of the polarity of a thermalcouple 18 coupled to transmitter 10. Figure 8A is a flow chart showing steps executed by microprocessor 22 and Figure 8B is an example configuration of the thermocouple. In flow chart 220, microprocessor 22 measures the voltage across terminals 1 and 2. This is recorded as a baseline value, Vbase- Next, terminals 1 and 2 (or the cold junction formed by thermocouple 16) are heated using heater 41. Heater 41 can be configured to operate under the control of the microprocessor 22. The microprocessor 22 then records the heated voltage value Vheat- Next, if Vheat is greater than Vbase, microprocessor 22 determines that terminal 2 is the positive lead of the thermocouple. Alternatively, microprocessor 22 determines that terminal 1 is the positive lead.<br>
The various steps set forth in the flow charts can be arranged as desired. Typically, the steps are performed using program instructions stored in memory 30 and executed by microprocessor 22.<br>
Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Although the measurement circuitry is described as measuring resistance or voltage, any appropriate electrical parameter can be measured.
