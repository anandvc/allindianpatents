				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a multimodal polyethylene composition for<br>
pipes which comprises a polymeric base resin comprising two polyethylene<br>
fractions with different molecular weight. Furthermore, the present<br>
invention relates to a process for the production of said composition, a pipe<br>
comprising said composition and to the use of said composition for the<br>
production of a pipe.<br>
Multimodal polyethylene compositions are frequently used e.g. for the<br>
production of pipes due to their favourable physical and chemical<br>
properties as e.g. mechanical strength, corrosion resistance and long-term<br>
stability. When considering that the fluids, such as water or natural gas,<br>
transported in a pipe often are pressurized and have varying temperatures,<br>
usually within a range of 0°C to 50oC, it is obvious that the polyethylene<br>
composition used for pipes must meet demanding requirements.<br>
In particular, the polyethylene composition must have high mechanical<br>
strength on the one hand and good long-term stability, notch/creep<br>
resistance and crack propagation resistance on the other hand. However, at<br>
least some of these properties are contrary to each other so that it is<br>
difficult to provide a composition for pipes which excels in all of these<br>
properties simultaneously. For example, stiffness imparting mechanical<br>
strength to the pipe is known to improve with higher density but, in<br>
contrast, notch/creep resistance is known to improve with reduced density.<br>
Furthermore, as polymer pipes generally are manufactured by extrusion, or,<br>
to a smaller extent, by injection moulding, the polyethylene composition<br>
also must have good processability.<br><br>
It is known that in order to comply with the contrary requirements for a<br>
pipe material bimodal polyethylene compositions may be used. Such<br>
compositions are described e.g. in EP 0 739 937 and WO 02/102891. The<br>
bimodal polyethylene compositions described in these documents usually<br>
comprise a low molecular weight polyethylene fraction and a high<br>
molecular weight fraction of an ethylene copolymer comprising one or<br>
more alpha-olefm comonomers.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a polyethylene<br>
composition for pipes having an improved combination of properties, in<br>
particular having enhanced stress crack propagation resistance and,<br>
simultaneously, good long-term stability.<br>
The present invention is based on the surprising finding that the above<br>
mentioned object can be achieved by a polyethylene composition<br>
comprising at least two polymer fractions with different molecular weights<br>
wherein the high molecular weight fraction comprises a composition with a<br>
high density in relation to its comonomer content.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a polyethylene composition<br>
comprising a base resin which comprises<br>
(A)	an ethylene homo- or copolymer fraction, and<br>
(B)	an ethylene copolymer fraction comprising at least one alpha-<br>
olefin comonomer having at least 4 carbon atoms,<br>
wherein<br>
(i) fraction (A) has a lower average molecular weight than<br>
fraction (B), and<br><br>
(ii) the comonomer content and the density d of the base resin<br>
satisfy the following relation:<br>
comonomer [mol%] &gt; -0.0612 d [kg/m3] mol%/(kg/m3)<br>
+ 58.6, and<br>
(iii) the base resin comprises more than 0.5 mol% of at least one<br>
alpha-olefin comonomer having at least 4 carbon atoms.<br>
It has been found that with such polyethylene compositions pipes can be<br>
produced which have a high mechanical strength, which e.g. allows for the<br>
pipe being used for the transport of pressurized fluids, high crack<br>
propagation resistance and an excellent long-term stability. Furthermore,<br>
the polyethylene compositions also have good processability.<br>
It should be noted that the composition of the present invention is<br>
characterised not by any single one of the above defined features, but by<br>
their combination. By this unique combination of features it is possible to<br>
obtain pressure pipes of superior performance, particularly with regard to<br>
minimum required strength (MRS), processability, rapid crack propagation<br>
(RCP) resistance, impact strength, and slow crack growth resistance.<br>
The term molecular weight where used herein denotes the weight average<br>
molecular weight Mw.<br>
The term "base resin" denotes the entirety of polymeric components in the<br>
polyethylene composition according to the invention, usually making .up at<br>
least 90 wt% of the total composition. Preferably, the base resin is<br>
consisting of fractions (A) and (B), optionally further comprising a<br>
prepolymer fraction in an amount of up to 20 wt%, preferably up to 10<br>
wt%, more preferably up to 5 wt% of the total base resin.<br><br>
In addition to the base resin, usual additives for utilization with<br>
polyolefms, such as pigments (for example carbon black), stabilizers<br>
(antioxidant agents), antacids and/or anti-UVs, antistatic agents and<br>
utilization agents (such as processing aid agents) may be present in the<br>
polyethylene composition. Preferably, the amount of these additives is 10<br>
wt% or below, further preferred 8 wt% or below, of the total composition.<br>
Preferably, the composition comprises carbon black in an amount of 8 wt°/o<br>
or below, further preferred of 1 to 4 wt%, of the total composition.<br>
Further preferred, the amount of additives different from carbon black is 1<br>
wt% or less, more preferably 0.5 wt% or less.<br>
Usually, a polyethylene composition comprising at least two polyethylene<br>
fractions, which have been produced under different polymerisation<br>
conditions resulting in different (weight average) molecular weights for the<br>
fractions, is referred to as "multimodal". The prefix "multi" relates to the<br>
number of different polymer fractions the composition is consisting of.<br>
Thus, for example, a composition consisting of two fractions only is called<br>
"bimodal".<br>
The form of the molecular weight distribution curve, i.e. the appearance of<br>
the graph of the polymer weight fraction as function of its molecular<br>
weight, of such a multimodal polyethylene will show two or more maxima<br>
or at least be distinctly broadened in comparison with the curves for the<br>
individual fractions.<br>
For example, if a polymer is produced in a sequential multistage process,<br>
utilising reactors coupled in series and using different conditions in each,<br>
reactor, the polymer fractions produced in the different reactors will each<br>
have their own molecular weight distribution and weight average molecular<br><br>
weight. When the molecular weight distribution curve of such a polymer is<br>
recorded, the individual curves from these fractions are superimposed into<br>
the molecular weight distribution curve for the total resulting polymer<br>
product, usually yielding a curve with two or more distinct maxima.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the polyethylene composition has an shear<br>
thinning index SHI(2.7/210) of 50 or more, more preferably of 75 or more,<br>
still more preferably of 85 or more, and most preferred of 95 or more.<br>
The SHI is the ratio of the viscosity of the polyethylene composition at<br>
different shear stresses. In the present invention, the shear stresses at 2.7<br>
kPa and 210 kPa are used for calculating the SHI(2.7/210) which may serve as<br>
a measure of the broadness of the molecular weight distribution.<br>
Where the SHI of the composition is 50 or higher it is preferred that the<br>
comonomer content, the density d of the base resin and the shear thinning<br>
index SHI of the composition satisfy the following relation:<br>
comonomer [mol%] &gt; -0.0612 d [kg/m3] mol%/(kg/m3) + 58.5 +<br>
[(SHI/100)3]/3,<br>
if the SHI if between 50 and 100, and satisfy the following relation:<br>
comonomer [mol%] &gt; -0.0612 d [kg/m3] mol%/(kg/m3) + 58.5 +<br>
(SHI/300), preferably<br>
comonomer [mol%] &gt; -0.0612 d [kg/m3] mol%/(kg/m3) + 58.5 +<br>
[(SHI/100)2]/3,<br>
if the SHI is higher than 100.<br>

from 0.3 to 0.9 g/10min.<br>
The base resin of the polyethylene composition according to the invention<br>
preferably has a density of below 949.5 kg/m3.<br>
In the polyethylene composition according to the invention, preferably the<br>
weight ratio of fractions (A):(B) in the base resin is 35:65 or higher, i.e. is<br>
35:65 or an even higher amount of fraction (A) is present, further preferred<br>
is 40:60 or higher, and most preferred is 42:58 or higher.<br>
Furthermore, preferably the weight ratio of fractions (A):(B) in the base<br>
resin is 60 to 40 or lower, more preferably is 50:50 or lower.<br>
The base resin of the polyethylene composition preferably comprises at<br>
least 0.55 mol%, more preferably at least 0.75 mol%, and still more<br>
preferably at least 0.95 mol% of at least one alpha-olefin comonomer<br>
having at least 4 carbon atoms.<br>
Fraction (B) of the polyethylene composition preferably comprises at least<br>
1.0 mol%, more preferably at least 1.1 mol%, and still more preferably at<br>
least 1.5 mol% of at least one alpha-olefin comonomer having at least 4<br>
carbon atoms.<br>
The alpha-olefin comonomer of fraction (B) and the base resin is preferably<br>
having from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, more preferably from 6 to 8 carbon<br>
atoms, and most preferably is selected from 1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene<br>
and 1-octene.<br><br>
Further, the base resin of the polyethylene composition preferably has a<br>
density of 945 kg/rn3 or higher.<br>
The MFR5 of the base resin of the polyethylene composition preferably is<br>
1 g/10min or below.<br>
Fraction (A) of the polyethylene composition preferably is having a density<br>
of 950 kg/m3 or higher, more preferably of 960 kg/m3 or higher, and most<br>
preferably of 968 kg/m3 or higher.<br>
Fraction (A) of the polyethylene composition preferably is an ethylene<br>

of the base resin is preferably 50 or higher, more preferably is from 100 to<br>
10000.<br>
The polyethylene composition according to the invention, in particular<br>
when used for the production of a pipe, preferably has an impact strength at<br>
0°C of at least 10 kJ/m2, more preferably of at least 12 kJ/m2 and in<br>
particular of at least 15 kJ/m2. The impact strength is determined as Charpy<br>
Impact Strength according to ISO 179.<br>
Furthermore, the polyethylene composition has good rapid crack resistance.<br>
A pipe made of the multimodal polyethylene composition, according to the<br>
present invention preferably has an RCP-S4 value of -1 °C or lower, more<br>
preferably -4°C or lower, and most preferably -7 °C or lower.<br><br>
A pressure pipe made of the multimodal polymer composition according to<br>

MRS8.0, and more preferably MRS 10.0.<br>
Where herein features of fractions (A) and/or (B) of the composition of the<br>
present invention are given, these values are generally valid for the cases in<br>
which they can be directly measured on the respective fraction, e.g. when<br>
the fraction is separately produced or produced in the first stage of a<br>
multistage process.<br>
However, the base resin may also be and preferably is produced in a<br>
multistage process wherein e.g. fractions (A) and (B) are produced in<br>
subsequent stages. In such a case, the properties of the fractions produced<br>
in the second and third step (or further steps) of the multistage process can<br>
either be inferred from polymers, which are separately produced in a single<br>
stage by applying identical polymerisation conditions (e.g. identical<br>
temperature, partial pressures of the reactants/diluents, suspension medium,<br>
reaction time) with regard to the stage of the multistage process in which<br>
the fraction is produced, and by using a catalyst on which no previously<br>
produced polymer is present. Alternatively, the properties of the fractions<br>
produced in a higher stage of the multistage process may also be calculated,<br>
e.g. in accordance with B. Hagstrom, Conference on Polymer Processing<br>
(The Polymer Processing Society), Extended Abstracts and Final<br>
Programme, Gothenburg, August 19 to 21, 1997, 4:13.<br>
Thus, although not directly measurable, on the multistage process products,<br>
the properties of the fractions produced in higher stages of such a<br>
multistage process can be determined by applying either or both of the<br>
above methods. The skilled person will be able to select the appropriate<br>
method.<br><br>
The polyethylene composition according the invention preferably is<br>
produced so that at least one of fractions (A) and (B), preferably (B), is<br>
produced in a gas-phase reaction.<br>
Further preferred, one of the fractions (A) and (B) of the polyethylene<br>
composition, preferably fraction (A), is produced in a slurry reaction,<br>
preferably in a loop reactor, and one of the fractions (A) and (B),<br>
preferably fraction (B), is produced in a gas-phase reaction.<br>
Further, the polyethylene base resin preferably is produced in a multistage<br>
process. Polymer compositions produced in such a process are also<br>
designated as "in-situ"-blends.<br>
A multistage process is defined to be a polymerisation process in which a<br>
polymer comprising two or more fractions is produced by producing each<br>
or at least two polymer fraction(s) in a separate reaction stage, usually with<br>
different reaction conditions in each stage, in the presence of the reaction<br>
product of the previous stage which comprises a polymerisation catalyst.<br>
Accordingly, it is preferred that fraction (A) and (B) of the polyethylene<br>
composition are produced in different stages of a multistage process.<br>
Preferably, the multistage process comprises at least one gas phase stage in<br>
which, preferably, fraction (B) is produced.<br>
Further preferred, fraction (B) is produced in a subsequent stage in the<br>
presence of fraction (A) which has been produced in a previous stage.<br>
It is previously known to produce multimodal, in particular bimodal, olefin<br>
polymers, such as multimodal polyethylene, in a multistage process<br>
comprising two or more reactors connected in series. As instance of this<br>
prior art, mention may be made of EP 517 868, which is hereby<br><br>
incorporated by way of reference in its entirety, including all its preferred<br>
embodiments as described therein, as a preferred multistage process for the<br>
production of the polyethylene composition according to the invention.<br>
Preferably, the main polymerisation stages of the multistage process are<br>
such as described in EP 517 868, i.e. the production of fractions (A) and<br>
(B) is carried out as a combination of slurry polymerisation for fraction<br>
(A)/gas-phase polymerisation for fraction (B). The slurry polymerisation is<br>
preferably performed in a so-called loop reactor. Further preferred, the<br>
slurry polymerisation stage precedes the gas phase stage.<br>
Optionally and advantageously, the main polymerisation stages may be<br>
preceded by a prepolymerisation, in which case up to 20 % by weight,<br>
preferably 1 to 10 % by weight, more preferably 1 to 5 % by weight, of the<br>
total base resin is produced. The prepolymer is preferably an ethylene<br>
homopolymer (HDPE). At the prepolymerisation, preferably all of the<br>
catalyst is charged into a loop reactor and the prepolymerisation is<br>
performed as a slurry polymerisation. Such a prepolymerisation leads to<br>
less fine particles being produced in the following reactors and to a more<br>
homogeneous product being obtained in the end.<br>
The polymerisation catalysts include coordination catalysts of a transition<br>
metal, such as Ziegler-Natta (ZN), metallocenes, non-metallocenes, Cr-<br>
catalysts etc. The catalyst may be supported, e.g. with conventional<br>
supports including silica, Al-containing supports and magnesium dichloride<br>
based supports. Preferably the catalyst is a ZN catalyst more preferably the<br>
catalyst is non-silica supported ZN catalyst, and most preferably MgCl2-<br>
based ZN catalyst.<br><br>
The Ziegler-Natta catalyst further preferably comprises a group 4 (group<br>
numbering according to new IUPAC system) metal compound, preferably<br>
titanium, magnesium dichloride and aluminium.<br>
The catalyst may be commercially available or be produced in accordance<br>
or analogously to the literature. For the preparation of the preferable<br>
catalyst usable in the invention reference is made to WO2004055068 and<br>
WO2004055069 of Borealis and EPO 810 235. The content of these<br>
documents in its entirety is incorporated herein by reference, in particular<br>
concerning the general and all preferred embodiments of the catalysts<br>
described therein as well as the methods for the production of the catalysts.<br>
Particularly preferred Ziegler-Natta catalysts are described in EP 0 810<br>
235.<br>
The resulting end product consists of an intimate mixture of the polymers<br>
from the two reactors, the different molecular-weight-distribution curves of<br>
these polymers together forming a molecular-weight-distribution curve<br>
having a broad maximum or two maxima, i.e. the end product is a bimodal<br>
polymer mixture.<br>
It is preferred that the multimodal base resin of the polyethylene<br>
composition according to the invention is a bimodal polyethylene mixture<br>
consisting of fractions (A) and (B), optionally further comprising a small<br>
prepolymerisation fraction in the amount as described above. It is also<br>
preferred that this bimodal polymer mixture has been produced by polymerisation as described above under different polymerisation conditions in two or more polymerisation reactors connected in series.<br>
Owing to the flexibility with respect to reaction conditions thus obtained, it<br>
is most preferred that the polymerisation is carried out in a loop reactor/a<br>
gas-phase reactor combination.<br><br>
Preferably, the polymerisation conditions in the preferred two-stage method<br>
are so chosen that the comparatively low-molecular polymer having no<br>
content of comonomer is produced in one stage, preferably the First stage,<br>
owing to a high content of chain-transfer agent (hydrogen gas), whereas the<br>
high-molecular polymer having a content of comonomer is produced in<br>
another stage, preferably the second stage. The order of these stages may,<br>
however, be reversed.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the polymerisation in a loop reactor<br>
followed by a gas-phase reactor, the polymerisation temperature in the loop<br>
reactor preferably is 85 to 115 °C, more preferably is 90 to 105°C, and<br>
most preferably is 92 to 100°C, and the temperature in the gas-phase<br>
reactor preferably is 70 to 105 °C, more preferably is 75 to 100°C, and<br>
most preferably is 82 to 97°C.<br>
A chain-transfer agent, preferably hydrogen, is added as required to the<br>
reactors, and preferably 200 to 800 moles of H2/kmoles of ethylene are<br>
added to the reactor, when the LMW fraction is produced in this reactor,<br>
and 0 to 50 moles of H2/kmoles of ethylene are added to the gas phase<br>
reactor when this reactor is producing the HMW fraction.<br>
Preferably, the base resin of the polyethylene composition is produced with<br>
a rate of at least 5 tons/h, more preferably at least 10 ton/h, and most<br>
preferably at least 15 tons/h.<br>
The composition of the invention preferably if produced in a process<br>
comprising a compounding step, wherein the composition of the base resin,<br>
i.e. the blend, which is typically obtained as a base resin powder from the<br>
reactor, is extruded in an extruder and then pelletised to polymer pellets in<br>
a manner known in the art.<br><br>
Optionally, additives or other polymer comp orients can be added to the<br>
composition during the compounding step in the amount as described<br>
above. Preferably, the composition of the invention obtained from the<br>
reactor is compounded in the extruder together with additives in a manner<br>
known in the art.<br>
The extruder may be e.g. any conventionally used extruder. As an<br>
example of an extruder for the present compounding step may be those as<br>
supplied by Japan steel works, Kobe steel or Faxrel-Pomini, e.g. JSW 460P.<br>
In one embodiment, the extrusion step is carried out using production rates<br>
of at least 400, at least 500, at least 1000 kg/h may be used in said<br>
compounding step.<br>
In another embodiment the compounding step can be effected with<br>
production rate of that least 5 tons/h, preferably at least 15 tons/h, more<br>
preferably at least 20 or 25 tons/h or even at least 30 or more tons/h, such<br>
as at least 50, such 1-50, preferably 5-40, 10-50, in some embodiments 10-<br>
25 tons/h.<br>
Alternatively, production rates at least 20 tons/h, preferably at least 25<br>
tons/h, even at least 30 tons/h, e.g. 25-40 tons/h may be desired during the<br>
compounding step.<br>
The present multimodal polyethylene composition of the invention enables<br>
such production rates within the property window of the invention, i.e. with<br>
various property combinations of MFR's of the fractions and of final base<br>
resin variations together with excellent homogeneity, just to mention few.<br>
Preferably, in said extrusion step, a total SEI (specific energy input) of the<br>

Examples<br>
1. Definitions and measurement methods<br>
a) Molecular weight<br><br>
The weight average molecular weight Mw and the molecular weight<br>
distribution (MWD = Mw/Mn wherein Mn is the number average molecular<br>
weight and Mw is the weight average molecular weight) is measured by a<br>
method based on ISO 16014-4:2003. A Waters 150CV plus instrument was<br>
used with column 3 x HT&amp;E styragel from Waters (divinylbenzene) and<br>
trichlorobenzene (TCB) as solvent at 140 °C. The column set was<br>
calibrated using universal calibration with narrow MWD PS standards (the<br>
Mark Howings constant K: 9.54* 10"5 and a: 0.725 for PS, and K: 3. 92*10-4<br>
and a: 0.725 for PE). The ratio of Mw and Mn is a measure of the broadness<br>
of the distribution, since each is influenced by the opposite end. of the<br>
"population".<br>
b)	Density<br>
Density is measured according to ISO 1872, Annex A.<br>
c)	Melt Flow Rate/Flow Rate Ratio<br>
The melt flow rate (MFR) is determined according to ISO 1133 and is<br>
indicated in g/10 min. The MFR is an indication of the flowability, and<br>
hence the processability, of the polymer. The higher the melt flow rhte, the<br>
lower the viscosity of the polymer. The MFR is determined at 19 0°C and<br>
may be determined at different loadings such as 2.16 kg (MFR2) 5 kg<br>
(MFR5)or21.6kg(MFR21).<br>
The quantity FRR (flow rate ratio) is an indication of moleculax weight<br>
distribution and denotes the-ratio of flow rates at different loadings.. Thus,<br>
FRR21/5 denotes the value of MFR21/MFR5.<br>
d)	Rheological parameters<br><br>
Rheological parameters such as Shear Thinning Index SHI and Viscosity<br>
are determined by using a rheometer, preferably a Rheometrics Phisica<br>
MCR 300 Rheometer. The definition and measurement conditions are<br>
described in detail on page 8 line 29 to page 11, line 25 of WO 00/22040.<br>
e) Rapid crack propagation<br>
The rapid crack propagation (RCP) resistance of a pipe is determined<br>
according to a method called the S4 test (Small Scale Steady State), which<br>
has been developed at Imperial College, London, and which is described in<br>
ISO 13477:1997 (E).<br>
According to the RCP-S4 test a pipe is tested, which has an axial length not<br>
below 7 pipe diameters. The outer diameter of the pipe is about 110 mm or<br>
greater and its wall thickness about 10 mm or greater. When determining<br>
the RCP properties of a pipe in connection with the present invention, the<br>
outer diameter and the wall thickness have been selected to be 110 mm and<br>
10 mm, respectively. While the exterior of the pipe is at ambient pressure<br>
(atmospheric pressure), the pipe is pressurised internally, and the internal<br>
pressure in the pipe is kept constant at a pressure of 0.5 MPa positive<br>
pressure. The pipe and the equipment surrounding it are thermostatted to a<br>
predetermined temperature. A number of discs have been mounted on a<br>
shaft inside the pipe to prevent decompression during the tests. A knife<br>
projectile is shot, with well-defined forms, towards the pipe close to its one<br>
end in the so-called initiating zone in order to start a rapidly running axial<br>
crack. The initiating zone is provided with an abutment for avoiding<br>
unnecessary deformation of the pipe. The test equipment is adjusted in such<br>
a manner that crack initiation takes place in the material involved, and a<br>
number of tests are effected at varying temperatures. The axial crack length<br>
in the measuring zone, having a total length of 4.5 diameters, is measured<br><br>
for each test and is plotted against the set test temperature. If the crack<br>
length exceeds 4 diameters, the crack is assessed to propagate. If the pipe<br>
passes the test at a given temperature, the temperature is lowered<br>
successively until a temperature is reached, at which the pipe no longer<br>
passes the test, but the crack propagation exceeds 4 times the pipe<br>
diameter. The critical temperature (Tcrit), i.e. the ductile brittle transition<br>
temperature as measured according to ISO 13477:1997 (E) is the lowest<br>
temperature at which the pipe passes the test. The lower the critical<br>
temperature the better, since it results in an extension of the applicability of<br>
the pipe.<br>
f)	Slow crack propagation<br>
The slow crack propagation resistance is determined according to ISO<br>
13479:1997 in terms of the number of hours the pipe withstands a certain<br>
pressure at a certain temperature before failure. Herein, a pressure of 9.2<br>
bars has been used to obtain an aimed stress of 4.6 MPa.<br>
g)	Design stress<br>
The design stress rating is the circumferential stress a pipe is designed to<br>
withstand for 50 years without failure and is determined for different<br>
temperatures in terms of the Minimum Required Strength (MRS) according<br>
to ISO/TR 9080. Thus, MRS 8.0 means that the pipe is a pipe withstanding<br>
a hoop stress of 8.0 MPa gauge for 50 years at 20°C, and similarly MRS<br>
10.0 means that the pipe withstands a hoop stress of 10 MPa gauge for 50<br>
years at 20°C.<br><br>
2. Polyethylene compositions<br>
Production of polyethylene compositions base resins was performed in a<br>
multistage reaction comprising prepolymerisation in slurry in a 50 dm3 loop<br>
reactor, followed by transferring the slurry to a 500 dm3 loop reactor<br>
wherein polymerisation was continued in slurry to produce the low<br>
molecular weight component, and a second polymerisation in a gas phase<br>
reactor in the presence of the product from the second loop reactor to<br>
produce the comonomer containing high molecular weight component. The<br>
comonomer was 1-hexene in all compositions produced.<br>
