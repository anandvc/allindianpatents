				<td>This invention relates particularly to an improved pencil with a reusable extension attachment and more particularly this invention relates to an improved disposable pencil with a non-disposable extension attachment.<br>
A pencil is an instrument for writing and drawing that employs a solid marking substance, not a fluid as in pen, which is sharpemfon every use and finally shortens to a length of uncomfortable handling for writing or drawing purpose. As such the shortened piece of pencil rather the large nubs upto one third of the original pencil is thrown away due to its uncomfortable handling for writing or drawing purposes.<br>
To overcome these disadvantages the improvements have been made in the ordinary pencil but mainly resulting in mechanical pencils. The mechanical pencils introduced in the market mainly comrpises of a tubular casing with writing units. The writing units are made available in sharpened lead pieces also called as such cartridges supplied with tubular casing in a separate tubular holder or in a space provided for them in the main tubular casing at its rear end, or fitted in individual plastic casings which are placed one after the another in the main tubular casing. These arrangements have disadvantage that with sharpened lead cartridges used as writing units are supported only at the end where it projects out of the main tubular casing and consequently the writing unit is highly unstable and results in breakaway of cartridges finally resulting in wastage of such cartridges and hence making such arrangements highly uneconomical.<br>
The disadvantages of the type of pencil with alternate arrangements of individually packed lead cartridges in a plastic casing, which is the development to overcome the disadvantages of the above said arrangement, is that, if one<br>
of the writing units is lost or damaged, the remaining writing units conatained in the tubular casing will not be able to maintain the pencil assembly and as such the entire pencil becomes unusable.<br>
In another type of pencil the screw-stem mechanism is used which complicates the manufacturing technique and hence results in expensive pencil assembly.<br>
The main disadvantages of such available reusable pencils to over-come the drawbacks of wastage of lead component of the pencil are the increase in overall cost of the pencil due to the pencil assembly being unusable on either breakage of sharpened lead cartridges which are just thrown away or loss of anyone of the writing units, difficulty of introducing the cartridge units either from rear end or from front end of the pencil assembly and above all the increase in construction cost and maintenance cost because the spares of cartridge units are available at higher rates.<br>
The present invention relates to an improved pencil with useful and reusable extension attachment and improved pencil itself which is more particularly adopted to overcome the disadvantages of the prior art, which in turn is particularly the wastage of major portion of the writing unit due to its uncomfortable handling size.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a pencil with one end capable of holding the extension attachment for means to extend the length of used pencil.<br>
The another object of the present invention is to provide usable extension attachments to avoid the wastage of the pencil after two-third of the use.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a useful extension attachment to extend the length of the pencil and to make it comfortable for holding the same while in use for writing or drawings purpose.<br>
The present invention provides an improved disposable pencil after optimum use with useful and reusable extension attachment comprising a pencil with one end capable of receiving the extension attachment, which are easy and simplified to manufacture to reduce the cost of production and prevent the wastage of used portion of the pencil which is otherwise thrown away due to its uncomfortable size for secure handling while in use for writing or drawing purpose.<br>
The another important object of the present invention is to provide the extension attachment which can be further extended to desired length depending, on the size of a person's fingers/hand.<br>
This invention also provides a reusable extension attachment, wherein the said attachment can be unfolded to desired length while in use and folded while kept in pocket and is further provided with the device to securely hold the pencil in pocket which also avoids it to roll on to the flat surface and prevent the same from falling or being thrown out of the pocket.<br>
According to the another preferred object of the invention the extension attachment can also serve as casing for the pencil, which avoids the breaking away of the sharpened end of the pencil hence avoid the wastage of the lead component of the pencil and simultaneously serves to securely hold the pencil in the pocket when the same is not in use and gives it the attractive look of the pen.<br>
According to this invention there is provided an improved pencil with reusable extension attachment, adapted to extend the length of the said pencil, comprising of an improved<br>
pencil comprising a casing having lead along its axis characterized in that at least one end of the said pencil has a cavity or a projection, the said cavity is selected from cylindrical or conical or threaded shapes, the said projection is selected from cylindrical or conical or threaded shapes, the said cavity dimensionally matching the said projection, the said pencil having annular portion square with the axis of the said pencil; an extension attachment comprising a cylindrical body having a cavity on one end and a projection on the other end; the said cavity selected from cylindrical, threaded or conical shapes; the said projection selected from cylindrical or threaded or conical shapes, the said cavity dimensionally matching the said projection on the said extension attachment; the said cavity and the said projection of the said extension attachment dimensionally matching the said projection and the said cavity of the said improved pencil, the said extension attachment having annular portion square with the axis of the said extension attachment;<br>
Other objects and further applicability of the present invention will become more apparent when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which are not given with an intention to restrict the applicability of the present disclosures. Any modifications related to size and shape of the extension attachments or to their application or use with any such writing device are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
