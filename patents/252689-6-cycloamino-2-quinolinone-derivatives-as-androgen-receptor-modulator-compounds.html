6-CYCLOAMINO-2-QUINOLINONE DERIVATIVES AS ANDROGEN RECEPTOR MODULATOR COMPOUNDS;<br>
LIGAND PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED, A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHOSE ADDRESS IS 10275 SCIENCE CENTER DRIVE, SAN DIEGO, CA 92121, U.S.A.<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
1<br><br>
Related Applications<br>
This application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/497,125 filed August 22,2003, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to nonsteroidal compounds that are modulators {i.e., agonists, partial agonists and antagonists) of androgen receptor, and to methods for the making and use of such compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Intracellular receptors (IRs) form a class of structurally-related genetic regulators scientists has named "ligand dependent transcription factors" (R. M. Evans, Science, 240:889,1988). Steroid receptors are a recognized subset of the IRs, including androgen receptor, progesterone receptor (PR), estrogen receptor (ER), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and mineralcorticoid receptor (MR). Regulation of a gene by such factors requires both the IR itself and a corresponding ligand, which has the ability to selectively bind to the IR in a way that affects gene transcription.<br>
The natural hormones for steroid receptors have been known for a long time, such as testosterone for the androgen receptor. A synthetic compound that binds to an IR and mimics the effect of the native hormone is referred to as an "agonist", while a compound that inhibits the effect of the native hormone is called an "antagonist". The term "modulators" refers to a group of compounds that have a spectrum of activities from agonist, partial agonist to antagonist in different target tissues.<br>
Androgen receptor modulators are known to play an important role in health of both men and women. For example, androgen receptor antagonists, such as cyproterone acetate, flutamide and casodex, are useful in the treatment of prostatic hyperplasia and cancer of the prostate. Androgen receptor agonists, such as testosterone and fluoxymesterone, are used in the treatment of hypogonadism and muscle wasting<br>
1<br><br>
diseases.  Due to increased life expectancies, development of tissue selective, safer, orally active androgen receptor modulators are desirable to improve quality of life.<br>
A group of 6-cycloamino-quinolinone derivatives was recently described as androgen receptor modulators (e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,566,372). This group of androgen receptor modulators was developed by using cell-based high-throughput assays, termed cotransfection assays.<br>

Certain Synthesis Methods<br>
Certain synthetic schemes are now provided. The synthetic schemes are provided only to illustrate possible ways to make prepare compounds of the invention and do not limit the invention in any way. One of skill in the art will recognize that compounds of the present invention may be synthesized through any of a variety of<br>
schemes using a variety of different starting materials. In Scheme I the R groups (e.g., R ,<br>
R2 , etc.) correspond to the specific substitution patterns noted in the Examples. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that other functionalities disclosed herein at the indicated positions of compounds of formula I also comprise potential substituents for the analogous positions on the structures within Scheme I.<br><br><br>
Scheme I describes the syntheses of the 6-cycloamino compounds of Structures 10. The process begins with a step-wise Knorr reaction, in which 4-Bromoaniline (Structure 1) and a 3-ketoester (Structure 2) such as the trifiuoroacetoacetate are heated in reflux in toluene provides an amide (Structure 3) and heating of the amide in concentrated sulfuric acid affords 4-bromoquinolinones as Structure 4. Treatment of quinolinones of Structure 4 with 2-iodopropane, catalyzed by cesium fluoride in DMF afford alkoxyquinoline compounds of Structure 5. Palladium-catalyzed coupling reaction between bromoquinolines of Structure 5 and cycloalkylamines of Structure 6 gives<br>
32<br><br>
compounds of Structures 7. Manipulation of the substitution pattern of Structure 7 affords intermediates of Structure 9. Alternately, palladium catalyzed coupling of bromoquinolines of Structure 5 and cycloalkylamines of Structure 8 directly gives compounds of Structures 9. Hydrolysis of the quinoline compounds (Structures 9) in acidic condition provides compounds of Structures 10.<br>
In certain embodiments, the invention provides a salt corresponding to any of the compounds provided herein. In certain embodiments, the invention provides a salt corresponding to a selective androgen receptor modulator.  In certain embodiments, the invention provides a salt corresponding to a selective androgen receptor binding agent. In certain embodiments, a salt is obtained by reacting a compound with an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, and the like. In certain embodiments, a salt is obtained by reacting a compound with a base to form a salt such as an ammonium salt, an alkali metal salt, such as a sodium or a potassium salt, an alkaline earth metal salt, such as a calcium or a magnesium salt, a salt of organic bases such as dicyclohexylamine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and the like.<br>
In certain embodiments, one or more carbon atoms of a compound of the present invention is replaced with silicon. See e.g., International Patent Application No. WO 03/037905A1; Tacke &amp; Zilch, Endeavour, New Series, 10:191-197 (1986); Bains &amp; Tacke, Curr. Opin. Drug Discov Devel. 6:526-43 (2003). In certain embodiments, compounds of the present invention comprising one or more silicon atoms possess certain desired properties, including, but not limited to, greater stability and/or longer half-life in a patient, when compared to the same compound in which none of the carbon atoms have been replaced with a silicon atom.<br>
Protecting groups that may be used in the present invention include those that are commonly known to those skilled in the art. Such groups include, but are not limited to TBDMS, TBS and Benzyl.<br>
33<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention also include isotopically labeled and radio-labeled compounds, which can be prepared by those of skilled in the art. Certain Assays<br>
In certain embodiments, compounds of the present invention are capable of modulating activity of androgen receptors in a "co-transfection" assay (also called a "cis-trans" assay), which has been discussed previously. See e.g., Evans et al, Science, 240:889-95 (1988); U.S. Patent Nos. 4,981,784 and 5,071,773; Pathirana et al, Mol. Pharm. 47:630-35 (1995)). Modulating activity in a co-transfection assay has been shown to correlate with in vivo modulating activity. Thus, in certain embodiments, co-transfection assays are predictive of in vivo activity. See, e.g., Berger et al., J. Steroid Biochem. Molec. Biol. 41:773 (1992).<br>
In certain co-transfection assays, two different co-transfection plasmids are prepared. In the first co-transfection plasmid, cloned cDNA encoding an intracellular receptor {e.g., androgen receptor) is operatively linked to a constitutive promoter {e.g., an SV 40 promoter). In the second co-transfection plasmid, cDNA encoding a reporter protein, such as firefly luciferase (LUC), is operatively linked to a promoter that is activated by a receptor-dependant activation factor. Both co-transfection plasmids are co-transfected into the same cells. Expression of the first co-transfection plasmid results in production of the intracellular receptor protein. Activation of that intracellular receptor protein {e.g., by binding of an agonist) results in production of a receptor-dependant activation factor for the promoter of the second co-transfection plasmid. That receptor-dependant activation factor in turn results in expression of the reporter protein encoded on the second co-transfection plasmid. Thus, reporter protein expression is linked to activation of the receptor. Typically, that reporter activity can be conyeniently measured {e.g., as luciferase production).<br>
Certain co-transfection assays can be used to identify agonists, partial agonists, and/or antagonists of intracellular receptors. In certain embodiments, to identify agonists, co-transfected cells are exposed to a test compound. If the test compound is an agonist or partial agonist, reporter activity is expected to increase compared to co-transfected cells in the absence of the test compound. In certain embodiments, to identify<br>
34<br><br>
antagonists, the cells are exposed to a known agonist (e.g., an androgen for the androgen receptor) in the presence and absence of a test compound. If the test compound is an antagonist, reporter activity is expected to decrease relative to that of cells exposed only to the known agonist.<br>
In certain embodiments, compounds of the invention are used to detect the presence, quantity and/or state of receptors in a sample. In certain of such embodiments, samples are obtained from a patient. In certain embodiments, compounds are radio- or isotopically-labeled. For example, compounds of the present invention that selectively bind androgen receptors may be used to determine the presence of such receptors in a sample, such as cell homogenates and lysates. <br>
Certain Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
In certain embodiments, at least one selective androgen receptor modulator, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, amide, and/or prodrug thereof, either alone or combined with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, forms a pharmaceutical composition. Techniques for formulation and administration of compounds of the present invention may be found for example, in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences," Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 18th edition, 1990.<br>

In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more compounds of the present invention is a solid (e.g., a powder, tablet, and/or capsule). In certain of such embodiments, a solid pharmaceutical composition comprising one or<br>
35<br><br>
more compounds of the present invention is prepared using ingredients known in the art, including, but not limited to, starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents.<br>
In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more compounds of the present invention is formulated as a depot preparation. Certain of such depot preparations are typically longer acting than non-depot preparations. In certain embodiments, such preparations are administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. In certain embodiments, depot preparations are prepared using suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more compounds of the present invention comprises a delivery system. Examples of delivery systems include, but are not limited to, liposomes and emulsions. Certain delivery systems are useful for preparing certain pharmaceutical compositions including those comprising hydrophobic compounds. In certain embodiments, certain organic sol)ents such as dimethylsulfoxide are used.<br>
In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more compounds of the present invention comprises one or more tissue-specific delivery molecules designed to deliver the pharmaceutical agent to specific tissues or cell types. For example, in certain embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions include liposomes coated with a tissue-specific antibody.<br>
In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more compounds of the present invention comprises a co-sol)ent system. Certain of such co-sol)ent systems comprise, for example, benzyl alcohol, a nonpolar surfactant, a water-miscible organic polymer, and an aqueous phase. In certain embodiments, such co-sol)ent systems are used for hydrophobic compounds. A non-limiting example of such a co-sol)ent system is the VPD co-sol)ent system, which is a solution of absolute ethanol comprising 3% w/v benzyl alcohol, 8% w/v of the nonpolar surfactant Polysorbate 80™,<br><br>
and 65% w/v polyethylene glycol 300. The proportions of such co-sol)ent systems may be varied considerably without significantly altering their solubility and toxicity characteristics. Furthermore, the identity of co-sol)ent components may be varied: for example, other surfactants may be used instead of Polysorbate 80™; the percentage of polyethylene glycol may be varied; other biocompatible polymers may replace polyethylene glycol, e.g., polyvinyl pyrrolidone; and other sugars or polysaccharides may substitute for dextrose.<br>
In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more compounds of the present invention comprises a sustained-release system. A non-limiting example of such a sustained-release system is a semipermeable matrix of solid hydrophobic polymers. In certain embodiments, sustained-release systems may, depending on their chemical nature, release compounds over a period of hours, days, weeks or months.<br>
Certain compounds used in pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be provided as pharmaceutically acceptable salts with pharmaceutically compatible counterions. Pharmaceutically compatible salts may be formed with many acids, including but not limited to hydrochloric, sulfuric, acetic, lactic, tartaric, malic, succinic, etc.<br>
In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more compounds of the present invention comprises an active ingredient in a therapeutically effective amount. In certain embodiments, the therapeutically effective amount is sufficient to prevent, alleviate or ameliorate symptoms of a disease or to prolong the suR)ival of the subject being treated. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art.<br>
In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more compounds of the present invention is formulated as a prodrug. In certain embodiments, prodrugs are useful because they are easier to administer than the corresponding active form. For example, in certain instances, a prodrug may be more bioavailable (e.g., through oral administration) than is the corresponding active form. In<br>
37<br><br>
certain instances, a prodrug may have improved solubility compared to the corresponding active form. In certain embodiments, a prodrug is an ester. In certain embodiments, such prodrugs are less water soluble than the corresponding active form. In certain instances, such prodrugs possess superior transmittal across cell membranes, where water solubility is detrimental to mobility. In certain embodiments, the ester in such prodrugs is metabolically hydrolyzed to carboxylic acid. In certain instances the carboxylic acid containing compound is the corresponding active form. In certain embodiments, a prodrug comprises a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bound to an acid group. In certain of such embodiments, the peptide is metabolized to form the corresponding active form.<br>

In certain embodiments, pharmaceutical intrathecals are administered to achieve local rather than systemic exposures. For example, pharmaceutical compositions may be injected directly in the area of desired effect (e.g., in the renal or cardiac area).<br>
In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more compounds of the present invention is administered in the form of a dosage unit (e.g., tablet, capsule, bolus, etc.). In certain embodiments, such dosage units comprise a selective androgen receptor modulator in a dose from about 1 p.g/kg of body weight to about 50 mg/kg of body weight. In certain embodiments, such dosage units comprise a selective androgen receptor modulator in a dose from about 2 p.g/kg of body weight to about 25 mg/kg of body weight.

In certain embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions are administered as needed, once per day, twice per day, three times per day, or four or more times per day. It is recognized by those skilled in the art that the particular dose,<br>
38<br><br>
frequency, and duration of administration depends on a number of factors, including, without limitation, the biological activity desired, the condition of the patient, and tolerance for the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the present invention is prepared for oral administration. In certain of such embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition is formulated by combining one or more compounds of the present invention with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.

EXAMPLE 55 Co-transfection assay<br>
CY-1 cells (African green monkey kidney fibroblasts) were cultured in the presence of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% charcoal resin-stripped fetal bovine serum then transferred to 96-well microtiter plates one day prior to transfection.<br>
73<br><br>
To determine androgen receptor (AR) agonist and antagonist activity of the compounds of the present invention, the CY-1 cells were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation according to the procedure of Berger era/., J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol, 41:733 (1992) with the following plasmids: pShAR (5 ng/well), MTY-LUC reporter (100 ng/well), pRS-6-Gal (50 ng/well) and filler DNA (pGEM; 45 ng/well). The receptor plasmid, pRShAR, contains the human AR under constitutive control of the SV-40 promoter, as more fully described in Simental et al, J. Biol. Chem., 266:510(1991).<br>
The reporter plasmid, MTY-LUC, contains the cDNA for firefly luciferase (LUC) under control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MTY) long terminal repeat, a conditional promoter containing an androgen response element. See e.g., Berger et al. supra. In addition, pRS-6-Gal, coding for constitutive expression of E. coli b-galactosidase (B-Gal), was included as an internal control for evaluation of transfection efficiency and compound toxicity.<br>
Six hours after transfection, media was removed and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Media containing reference compounds (i.e. progesterone as a PR agonist, mifepristone ((1lbeta,17beta)-l l-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]-17-hydroxy-17-(l-propynyl)estra-4,9-dien-3-one:RU486; Roussel Uclaf) as a PR antagonist; dihydrotestosterone (DHT; Sigma Chemical) as an AR agonist and 2-OH-flutamide (the active metabolite of 2-methyl-N-[4-nitro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]pronanamide; Schering-Plough) as an AR antagonist; estradiol (Sigma) as an ER agonist and ICI 164,384 (N-butyl-3,17-dihydroxy-N-methyl-(7-alpha,17-beta)-estra-l,3,5(10)-triene-7-undecanamide; ICI Americas) as an ER antagonist; dexamethasone (Sigma) as a GR agonist and RU486 as a GR antagonist; and aldosterone (Sigma) as a MR agonist and spironolactone ((7-alpha-[acetylthio]-17-alpha-hydroxy-3-oxopregn-4-ene-21-carboxylic acid gamma-lactone; Sigma) as an MR antagonist) and/or the modulator compounds of the present invention in concentrations ranging from 10-12 to 10"5 M were added to the cells. Three to four replicates were used for each sample.<br>
74<br><br>
Transfections and subsequent procedures were performed on a Biomek 1000 automated laboratory work station.<br>
After 40 hours, the cells were washed with PBS, lysed with a Triton X-l 00-based buffer and assayed for LUC and 8-Gal activities using a luminometer or spectrophotometer, respectively. For each replicate, the normalized response (NR) was calculated as:<br>
LUC response/b-Gal rate<br>
where 13-Gal rate =b-Gal rate.1x10-5 /b-Gal incubation time.<br>
The mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) of the NR were calculated. Data was plotted as the response of the compound compared to the reference compounds over the range of the dose-response curve. For agonist experiments, the effective concentration that produced 50% of the maximum response (EC50) was quantified. Agonist efficacy was a function (%) of LUC expression relative to the maximum LUC production by the reference agonist for PR, AR, ER, GR or MR. Antagonist activity was determined by testing the amount of LUC expression in the presence of a fixed amount of DHT as an AR agonist and progesterone as a PR agonist at the EC50 concentration. The concentration of test compound that inhibited 50% of LUC expression induced by the reference agonist was quantified (IC50). In addition, the efficacy of antagonists was determined as a function (%) of maximal inhibition.<br>
ER Binding assay<br>
AR Binding: For the whole cell binding assay, COS-1 cells in 96-well microtiter plates containing DMEM-10% FBS were transfected as described above with the following plasmid DNA: pRShAR (2 ng/well), pRS-8-Gal (50 ng/well) and pGEM (48 ng/well). Six hours after transfection, media was removed, the cells were washed with PBS and fresh media was added. The next day, the media was changed to serum-free DMEM to remove any endogenous ligand that might be complexed with the receptor in the cells.<br>
After 24 hours in serum-free media, either a saturation analysis to determine the kd for tritiated dihydrotestosterone (3H-DHT) on human AR, or a<br>
75<br><br>
competitive binding assay to evaluate the ability of test compound to compete with 3pi-DHT for AR, was performed. For the saturation analysis, media (DMEM-0.2% charcoal<br>
adsorbed-FBS) containing -H-DHT (in concentrations ranging from 12 nM to 0.24 nM) in the absence (total binding) or presence (non-specific binding) of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled DHT were added to the cells. For the competitive binding assay, media containing 1 nM -H-DHT and test compounds in concentrations ranging from l0-10 to 10-6 M were added to the cells. Three replicates were used for each sample. After three hours at 37°C, an aliquot of the total binding media at each concentration of 3H-DHT was<br>
removed to estimate the amount of free 3H-DHT.  The remaining media was removed, the cells were washed three times with PBS to remove unbound ligand, and cells were lysed<br>
with a Triton X-100-based buffer. The lysates were assayed for amount of bound 3H-DHT and B-Gal activity using a scintillation counter and spectrophotometer, respectively. For the saturation analyses, the difference between the total binding and the nonspecific binding, normalized by the J3-Gal rate, was defined as specific binding. The<br>
specific binding was evaluated by Scatchard analysis to determine the kd for -H-DHT. See e.g., D. Rodbard, "Mathematics and statistics of ligand assays: an illustrated guide" In: J. Langon and J.J. Clapp, eds., Ligand Assay, Masson Publishing U.S.A., Inc., New York, pp. 45-99, (1981), the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. For the<br>
competition studies, the data was plotted as the amount of -H-DHT (% of control in the absence of test compound) remaining over the range of the dose-response curve for a given compound. The concentration of test compound that inhibited 50% of the amount of<br>
-H-DHT bound in the absence of competing ligand was quantified (IC50) after log-logit transformation. The Ki values were determined by application of the Cheng-Prusoff equation to the IC50 values, where:<br>
IC50<br>
Ki     =   (1+[3H-DHT])/Kd for 3H-DHT<br>
76<br><br>
After correcting for non-specific binding, IC50 values were determined. The IC50 value is defined as the concentration of competing ligand needed to reduce specific binding by 50%. The IC50 value was determined graphically from a log-logit plot of the data. The Ki values were determined by application of the Cheng-Prusoff equation to the IC50 values, the labeled ligand concentration and the kd of the labeled ligand.<br>
