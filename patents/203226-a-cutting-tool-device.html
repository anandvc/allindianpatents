FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to cutting tool assemblies for metal cutting machining having a replaceable cutting head, and more particularly to cutting tool assemblies having an elongated shank for rotary cutting operations.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Such cutting tool assemblies have long been known. It has been proposed in EP 0 298 937 Bl, to provide a cutting tool comprising a cutting body and a shaft that supports the cutting body. The cutting body is detachably connected to a locking screw via hook-shaped means. The hooked-shaped means transfers axial forces between the cutting body and the locking screw. Both the cutting body and the locking screw are provided with hook shaped means. Both of the hooked shaped means are provided with recesses and tongues. The recesses and tongues cooperate to permanently transfer rotational movement between the locking means and the cutting body. The locking screw is provided with an externally threaded portion that is connected to an internally threaded recess provided in the shaft. The threads are designed as right hand threads for right hand cutting tools and as left hand threads for left hand cutting tools. The locking screw is movable in the axial direction by relative rotation of the externally threaded portion with respect to the<br><br>
-2-<br>
internally threaded recess. The shaft is provided with a conical seat and the cutting body is provided with a circumferential conical portion that is received in the conical seat of the shaft The cutting body can be inserted in or removed from the conical seat by displacing the locking screw from its innermost position to an intermediate position.<br>
The prior art cutting tool described above suffers from two basic disadvantages. First, to insert or remove the cutting body the locking screw has to be displaced from its innermost position to an intermediate position. Second, the cutting body cannot be used in conjunction with any other type of tool since it is formed with hook-shaped means and therefore it requires the presence of a locking screw having a compatible hook-shaped-means.<br>
