4-(BENZYL)-PIPERAZINE-1-CARBOXYLIC ACID PHENYLAMIDE DERIVATIVES AND RELATED<br>
COMPOUNDS AS MODULATORS OF FATTY ACID AMIDE HYDROLASE FOR THE TREATMENT OF<br>
ANXIETY, PAIN AND OTHER CONDITIONS<br>
Cross-Reference to Related Application<br>
This application claims priority to United States Provisional Application No.<br>
60/640,869, filed December 30, 2004.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to certain piperazinyl and piperidinyl urea<br>
compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and methods of using<br>
them for the treatment of disease states, disorders, and conditions mediated by<br>
fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) activity.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Medicinal benefits have been attributed to the cannabis plant for centuries.<br>
The primary bioactive constituent of cannabis is A9-tetrahydro-cannabinol (THC).<br>
The discovery of THC eventually led to the identification of two endogenous<br>
cannabinoid receptors responsible for its pharmacological actions, namely CBi<br>
and CB2 (Goya, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 2000, 10, 1529). These discoveries not<br>
only established the site of action of THC, but also inspired inquiries into the<br>
endogenous agonists of these receptors, or "endocannabinoids". The first<br>
endocannabinoid identified was the fatty acid amide anandamide (AEA). AEA<br>
itself elicits many of the pharmacological effects of exogenous cannabinoids<br>
(Piomelli, Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003, 4(11), 873).<br>
The catabolism of AEA is primarily attributable to the integral membrane<br>
bound protein fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which hydrolyzes AEA to<br>
arachidonic acid. FAAH was characterized in 1996 by Cravatt and co-workers<br>
(Cravatt, Nature 1996, 384, 83). It was subsequently determined that FAAH is<br>
additionally responsible for the catabolism of a large number of important lipid<br>
signaling fatty acid amides including: another major endocannabinoid, 2-<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/074025							/US2005/047329<br>
arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) (Science 1992, 258, 1946-1949); the sleep-inducing<br>
substance, oleamide (OEA) (Science 1995, 268,1506); the appetite-suppressing<br>
agent, N-oleoylethanolamine (Rodriguez de Fonesca, Nature 2001, 414, 209); and<br>
the anti-inflammatory agent, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) (Lambert, Curr. Med.<br>
Chem. 2002, 9(6), 663).<br>
Small-molecule inhibitors of FAAH should elevate the concentrations of<br>
these endogenous signaling lipids and thereby produce their associated beneficial<br>
pharmacological effects. There have been some reports of the effects of various<br>
FAAH inhibitors in pre-clinical models.<br>
In particular, two carbamate-based inhibitors of FAAH were reported to<br>
have analgesic properties in animal models. In rats, BMS-1 (see WO 02/087569),<br>
which has the structure shown below, was reported to have an analgesic effect in<br>
the Chung spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain, and the Hargraves test<br>
of acute thermal nociception. URB-597 was reported to have efficacy in the zero<br>
plus maze model of anxiety in rats, as well as analgesic efficacy in the rat hot<br>
plate and formalin tests (Kathuria, Nat. Med. 2003, 9(1), 76). The sulfonylfluoride<br>
AM374 was also shown to significantly reduce spasticity in chronic relapsing<br>
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (CREAE) mice, an animal model of<br>
multiple sclerosis (Baker, FASEB J. 2001, 15(2), 300).<br><br>
In addition, the oxazolopyridine ketone OL-135 is reported to be a potent<br>
inhibitor of FAAH, and has been reported to have analgesic activity in both the hot<br>
plate and tail emersion tests of thermal nociception in rats (WO 04/033652).<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/074025	PCT/US2005/047329<br><br>
Results of research on the effects of certain exogenous cannabinoids has<br>
elucidated that a FAAH inhibitor may be useful for treating various conditions,<br>
diseases, disorders, or symptoms. These include pain, nausea/emesis, anorexia,<br>
spasticity, movement disorders, epilepsy and glaucoma. To date, approved<br>
therapeutic uses for cannabinoids include the relief of chemotherapy-induced<br>
nausea and emesis among patients with cancer and appetite enhancement in<br>
patients with HIV/AIDs who experience anorexia as a result of wasting syndrome.<br>
Two products are commercially available in some countries for these indications,<br>
namely, dronabinol (MarinolÂ®) and nabilone.<br>
Apart from the approved indications, a therapeutic field that has received<br>
much attention for cannabinoid use is analgesia, i.e., the treatment of pain. Five<br>
small randomized controlled trials showed that THC is superior to placebo,<br>
producing dose-related analgesia (Robson, Br. J. Psychiatry2001, 178, 107-115).<br>
Atlantic Pharmaceuticals is reported to be developing a synthetic cannabinoid,<br>
CT-3, a 1,1-dimethyl heptyl derivative of the carboxylic metabolite of<br>
tetrahydrocannabinol, as an orally active analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent.<br>
A pilot phase II trial in chronic neuropathic pain with CT-3 was reported to have<br>
been initiated in Germany in May 2002.<br>
A number of individuals with multiple sclerosis have claimed a benefit from<br>
cannabis for both disease-related pain and spasticity, with support from small<br>
controlled trials (Svendsen, Br. Med. J. 2004, 329, 253). Likewise, various victims<br>
of spinal cord injuries, such as paraplegia, have reported that their painful spasms<br>
are alleviated after smoking marijuana. A report showing that cannabinoids<br>
appear to control spasticity and tremor in the CREAE model of multiple sclerosis<br>
demonstrated that these effects are mediated by CBT and CB2 receptors (Baker,<br>
Nature 2000, 404, 84-87). Phase 3 clinical trials have been undertaken in multiple<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/074025	PCT/LS2005/047329<br>
sclerosis and spinal cord injury patients with a narrow ratio mixture of<br>
tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol (THC/CBD).<br>
Reports of small-scale controlled trials have been conducted to investigate<br>
other potential commercial uses of cannabinoids have been made. Trials in<br>
volunteers have been reported to have confirmed that oral, injected and smoked<br>
cannabinoids produced dose-related reductions in intraocular pressure (IOP) and<br>
therefore may relieve glaucoma symptoms. Ophthalmologists have prescribed<br>
cannabis for patients with glaucoma in whom other drugs have failed to<br>
adequately control intraocular pressure (Robson, 2001).<br>
Inhibition of FAAH using a small-molecule inhibitor may be advantageous<br>
compared to treatment with a direct-acting CB1 agonist. Administration of<br>
exogenous CB1 agonists may produce a range of responses, including reduced<br>
nociception, catalepsy, hypothermia, and increased feeding behavior. These four<br>
in particular are termed the "cannabinoid tetrad." Experiments with FAAH -/- mice<br>
show reduced responses in tests of nociception, but did not show catalepsy,<br>
hypothermia, or increased feeding behavior (Cravatt, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA<br>
2001, 98(16), 9371). Fasting caused levels of AEA to increase in rat limbic<br>
forebrain, but not in other brain areas, providing evidence that stimulation of AEA<br>
biosynthesis may be anatomically regionalized to targeted CNS pathways<br>
(Kirkham, Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002, 136, 550). The finding that AEA increases are<br>
localized within the brain, rather than systemic, suggests that FAAH inhibition with<br>
a small molecule could enhance the actions of AEA and other fatty acid amides in<br>
tissue regions where synthesis and release of these signaling molecules is<br>
occurring in a given pathophysiological condition (Piomelli, 2003).<br>
In addition to the effects of a FAAH inhibitor on AEA and other<br>
endocannabinoids, inhibitors of FAAH's catabolism of other lipid mediators may<br>
be used in treating other therapeutic indications. For example, PEA has<br>
demonstrated biological effects in animal models of inflammation,<br>
immunosuppression, analgesia, and neuroprotection (Ueda, J. Biol. Chem. 2001,<br>
276(38), 35552). Oleamide, another substrate of FAAH, induces sleep (Boger,<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/074025	PCT/US2005/047329<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2000, 97(10), 5044; Mendelson,<br>
Neuropsychopharmacology 2001, 25, S36).<br>
Certain piperazinyl or piperidiny! derivatives have been disclosed in the<br>
literature for different uses. For example, JP 11139969 describes certain phenol<br>
derivatives as antioxidants and ACAT inhibitors; WO 96/21648 discloses various<br>
piperazine derivatives as antitumor agents; JP 48010160 describes certain<br>
piperazine derivatives as anti-inflammatory agents; WO 04/072025 discloses<br>
certain substituted N-arylheterocycles as obesity, diabetes, and drug abuse<br>
agents; DE 2123784 and U.S. Patent No. 3,813,395 disclose various<br>
piperazinylthieno-benzothiazepines as psychotropics and anesthetics; and WO<br>
98/37077 and WO 99/42107 describe certain piperazine-based compounds as<br>
calcitonin mimetics for treatment of bone deficits. Additionally, WO 97/42230<br>
describes a solid-phase synthesis of certain piperazine ureas. WO 97/23458<br>
discloses certain piperidine derivatives as intermediates toward NMDA receptor<br>
ligands. In addition, various small-molecule FAAH modulators have been<br>
reported, e.g., in WO 04/033652, U.S. Patent No. 6,462,054, U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,096,784, WO 99/26584, WO 97/49667, and WO 96/09817. However, there is<br>
still a need for other potent FAAH modulators with desirable pharmaceutical<br>
properties.<br>

Detailed Description of Invention and Its Preferred Embodiments<br>
The invention may be more fully appreciated by reference to the following<br>
description, including the following glossary of terms and the concluding<br>

15<br><br>
WO 2006/074025	PCT/US2005/047329<br>
group is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more substituents. Where the<br>
term "substituted" is used to describe a structural system, the substitution is meant<br>
to occur at any valency-allowed position on the system.<br>
Formula (I) is intended to represent compounds having structures depicted<br>
by the structural formula as well as certain variations or forms. In particular,<br>
compounds of Formula (I) may have asymmetric centers and therefore exist in<br>
different enantiomeric forms. All optical isomers and stereoisomers of the<br>
compounds of the general formula, and mixtures thereof, are considered within<br>
the scope of the formula. Thus Formula (I) is intended to represent a racemate,<br>
one or more enantiomeric forms, one or more diastereomeric forms, and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
Furthermore, certain structures depicted by Formula (I) may exist as<br>
geometric isomers (i.e., cis and trans isomers) or as tautomers. Additionally,<br>
Formula (I) is intended to represent hydrates, solvates, and polymorphs of such<br>
compounds, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Formula (I) is also intended to represent unlabeled forms as well as<br>
isotopically labeled forms of the compounds. Isotopically labeled compounds<br>
have structures depicted by Formula (I) except that one or more atoms are<br>
replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the<br>
atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that<br>
can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of<br>
hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine,<br>
such as 2H, 3H, 11C, 13C, 14C, 15N, 180,170,31P, 32P, 35S, 18F, and 36CI,<br>
respectively. Various isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention, for<br>
example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H, 11C, and 14C are<br>
incorporated, are useful in drug or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated<br>
(i.e., 3H) and carbon-14 (i.e., 14C) isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease<br>
of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such<br>
as deuterium (i.e., 2H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from<br>
greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced<br>
dosage requirements. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/074025	PCT/US2005/047329<br>
prod rugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures<br>
disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by<br>
substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically<br>
labeled reagent.<br>
When referring to Formula (I), the selection of a particular moiety from a list<br>
of possible species for a specified variable is not intended to define the moiety for<br>
the variable appearing elsewhere. In other words, where a variable appears more<br>
than once, the choice of the species from a specified list is independent of the<br>
choice of the species for the same variable elsewhere in the formula.<br>

The invention includes also pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the<br>
compounds represented by Formula (I), such as of those described above.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the specific compounds exemplified herein<br>
are especially preferred.<br>
A "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" is intended to mean a salt of a free<br>
acid or base of a compound represented by Formula (I) that is not toxic,<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2006/074025	PCT/US2005/047329<br>
biologically intolerable, or otherwise biologically undesirable. See, generally, e.g.,<br>
S.M. Berge, etal., "Pharmaceutical Salts", J. Pharm. Sci., 1977, 66:1-19, and<br>
Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts, Propertions, Selection, and Use; Stahl, P.H.,<br>
Wermuth, C.G., Eds.; Wiley-VCH and VHCA: Zurich, 2002. Preferred<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts are those that are pharmacologically effective<br>
and suitable for contact with the tissues of patients without undue toxicity,<br>
irritation, or allergic response. A compound of Formula (I) may possess a<br>
sufficiently acidic group, a sufficiently basic group, or both types of functional<br>
groups, and accordingly react with a number of inorganic or organic bases, and<br>
inorganic and organic acids, to form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
Exemplary pharmaceutically acceptable salts include sulfates, pyrosulfates,<br>
bisulfates, sulfites, bisulfites, phosphates, monohydrogen-phosphates,<br>
dihydrogenphosphates, metaphosphates, pyrophosphates, chlorides, bromides,<br>
iodides, acetates, propionates, decanoates, caprylates, acrylates, formates,<br>
isobutyrates, caproates, heptanoates, propiolates, oxalates, malonates,<br>
succinates, suberates, sebacates, fumarates, maleates, butyne-1,4-dioates,<br>
hexyne-1,6-dioates, benzoates, chlorobenzoates, methylbenzoates,<br>
dinitrobenzoates, hydroxybenzoates, methoxybenzoates, phthalates, sulfonates,<br>
xylenesulfonates, phenylacetates, phenylpropionates, phenylbutyrates, citrates,<br>
lactates, y-hydroxybutyrat.es, glycolates, tartrates, methane-sulfonates,<br>
propanesulfonates, naphthalene-1-sulfonates, naphthalene-2-sulfonates, and<br>
mandelates.<br>
If the compound of Formula (I) contains a basic nitrogen, the desired<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method<br>
available in the art, for example, treatment of the free base with an inorganic acid,<br>
such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, sulfamic acid, nitric<br>
acid, boric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like, or with an organic acid, such as<br>
acetic acid, phenylacetic acid, propionic acid, stearic acid, lactic acid, ascorbic<br>
acid, maleic acid, hydroxymaleic acid, isethionic acid, succinic acid, valeric acid,<br>
fumaric acid, malonic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid,<br>
oleic acid, palmitic acid, lauric acid, a pyranosidyl acid, such as glucuronic acid or<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2006/074025	PCT/US2005/047329<br>
galacturonic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid, such as mandelic acid, citric acid, or<br>
tartaric acid, an amino acid, such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid, an aromatic<br>
acid, such as benzoic acid, 2-acetoxybenzoic acid, naphthoic acid, or cinnamic<br>
acid, a sulfonic acid, such as laurylsulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid,<br>
methanesulfonic acid, or ethanesulfonic acid, or the like.<br>
If the compound of Formula (I) is an acid, such as a carboxylic acid or<br>
sulfonic acid, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by<br>
any suitable method, for example, treatment of the free acid with an inorganic or<br>
organic base, such as an amine (primary, secondary or tertiary), an alkali metal<br>
hydroxide, or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, or the like. Illustrative examples of<br>
suitable salts include organic salts derived from amino acids, such as glycine and<br>
arginine, ammonia, carbonates, bicarbonates, primary, secondary, and tertiary<br>
amines, and cyclic amines, such as benzylamines, pyrrolidines, piperidine,<br>
morpholine, and piperazine, and inorganic salts derived from sodium, calcium,<br>
potassium, magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, aluminum, and lithium.<br>
The invention also relates to treatment methods employing<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of the compounds of Formula (I). The term<br>
"prodrug" means a precursor of a designated compound that, following<br>
administration to a subject, yields the compound in vivo via a chemical or<br>
physiological process such as solvolysis or physiological conditions (e.g., a<br>
prodrug on being brought to physiological pH is converted to the compound of<br>
Formula (I)). A "pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug" is a prodrug that is not<br>
toxic, biologically intolerable, or otherwise biologically unsuitable for administration<br>
to the subject. Illustrative procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable<br>
prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs", ed. H.<br>
Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.<br>
Exemplary prodrugs include compounds having an amino acid residue, or a<br>
polypeptide chain of two or more (e.g., two, three or four) amino acid residues,<br>
covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino, hydroxy or<br>
carboxylic acid group of a compound of Formula (I). Examples of amino acid<br>
residues include the twenty naturally occurring amino acids commonly designated<br>
28<br><br>
WO 2006/074025	PCT/US2005/047329<br>
by three letter symbols as well as 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, demosine,<br>
isodemosine, 3-methylhistidine, norvalin, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid,<br>
citrulline homocysteine, homoserine, ornithine and methionine sulfone.<br>
Additional types of prodrugs may be produced, for instance, by derivatizing<br>
free carboxyl groups of structures of Formula (I) as amides or alkyl esters.<br>
Exemplary amides include those derived from ammonia, primary C1-16lkyl amines<br>
and secondary di(C1-6alkyl) amines. Secondary amines include 5- or 6-membered<br>
heterocycloalkyl or heteroaryl ring moieties having from 1 to 3 heteroatoms where<br>
at least one is a nitrogen atom. Preferred amides are derived from ammonia, C1-<br>
3alkyl primary amines, and di(C1-2alkyl)amines. Exemplary esters of the invention<br>
include C1-7alkyl, C5-7carbocyclyl, phenyl, and phenyl(C1-6alkyl) esters. Preferred<br>
esters include methyl esters. Prodrugs may also be prepared by derivatizing free<br>
hydroxy groups using groups including hemisuccinates, phosphate esters,<br>
dimethylaminoacetates, and phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyls, following<br>
procedures such as those outlined in Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 1996, 19, 115.<br>
Carbamate derivatives of hydroxy and amino groups may also yield prodrugs.<br>
Carbonate derivatives, sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups may<br>
also provide prodrugs. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and<br>
(acyloxy)ethyl ethers, wherein the acyl group may be an alkyl ester, optionally<br>
substituted with one or more ether, amine or carboxylic acid functionalities, or<br>
where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above, is also useful to<br>
yield prodrugs. Prodrugs of this type may be prepared as described in J. Med.<br>
Chem. 1996, 39, 10. Free amines can also be derivatized as amides,<br>
sulfonamides or phosphonamides. All of these prodrug moieties may incorporate<br>
groups including ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities.<br>
Pharmaceutically active metabolites may also be used in the methods of<br>
the invention. A "pharmaceutically active metabolite" means a pharmacologically<br>
active product of metabolism in the body of a compound of Formula (I) or salt<br>
thereof. Prodrugs and active metabolites of a compound may be determined<br>
using routine techniques known or available in the art. See, e.g., Bertolini et al., J.<br>

The compounds of Formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, and pharmaceutically active metabolites<br>
(collectively, "agents") of the present invention are useful as FAAH inhibitors in the<br>
methods of the invention. The agents may be used in the inventive methods for<br>
the treatment or prevention of medical conditions, diseases, or disorders mediated<br>
through inhibition or modulation of FAAH, such as those described herein. Agents<br>
according to the invention may therefore be used as an analgesic,<br>
neuroprotectant, sedative, appetite stimulant, or contraceptive.<br>
Exemplary medical conditions, diseases, and disorders include anxiety,<br>
pain, sleep disorders, eating disorders, inflammation, multiple sclerosis and other<br>
movement disorders, HIV wasting syndrome, closed head injury, stroke,<br>
Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, Tourette's syndrome, epilepsy, Niemann-Pick<br>
disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, optic neuritis, autoimmune<br>
uveitis, symptoms of drug withdrawal, nausea, emesis, sexual dysfunction, post-<br>
traumatic stress disorder, or cerebral vasospasm.<br>
Thus, the pharmaceutical agents may be used to treat subjects diagnosed<br>
with or suffering from a disorder or condition mediated through FAAH activity. The<br>
term "treat" or "treating" as used herein is intended to refer to administration of an<br>
agent or composition of the invention to a subject for the purpose of effecting a<br>
therapeutic or prophylactic benefit through modulation of FAAH activity. Treating<br>
includes reversing, ameliorating, alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, lessening<br>
the severity of, or preventing a disease, disorder or condition, or one or more<br>
symptoms of such disease, disorder or condition mediated through modulation of<br>
FAAH activity. The term "subject" refers to a mammalian patient in need of such<br>
treatment, such as a human. "Modulators" include both inhibitors and activators,<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2006/074025	PCT/US2005/047329<br>
where "inhibitors" refer to compounds that decrease, prevent, inactivate,<br>
desensitize or down-regulate FAAH expression or activity, and "activators" are<br>
compounds that increase, activate, facilitate, sensitize or up-regulate FAAH<br>
expression or activity..<br>
Accordingly, the invention relates to methods of using the pharmaceutical<br>
agents described herein to treat subjects diagnosed with or suffering from a<br>
disorder or condition mediated through FAAH activity, such as: anxiety, pain,<br>
sleep disorders, eating disorders, inflammation, or movement disorders (e.g.,<br>
multiple sclerosis).<br>
Symptoms or disease states are intended to be included within the scope<br>
of "medical conditions, disorders, or diseases." For example, pain may be<br>
associated with various diseases and disorders, and may include various<br>
etiologies. Illustrative types of pain treatable with a FAAH-modulating agent<br>
according to the invention include cancer pain, postoperative pain, Gl tract pain,<br>
spinal cord injury pain, visceral hyperalgesia, thalamic pain, headache (including<br>
stress headache and migraine), low back pain, neck pain, musculoskeletal pain,<br>
peripheral neuropathic pain, central neuropathic pain, neurogenerative disorder<br>
related pain, and menstrual pain. HIV wasting syndrome includes associated<br>
symptoms such as appetite loss and nausea. Parkinson's disease includes, for<br>
example, levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Treatment of multiple sclerosis may<br>
include treatment of symptoms such as spasticity, neurogenic pain, central pain,<br>
or bladder dysfunction. Symptoms of drug withdrawal may be caused by, for<br>
example, addiction to opiates or nicotine. Nausea or emesis may be due to<br>
chemotherapy, postoperative, or opioid related causes. Treatment of sexual<br>
dysfunction may include improving libido or delaying ejaculation. Treatment of<br>
cancer may include treatment of glioma. Sleep disorders include, for example,<br>
sleep apnea, insomnia, and disorders calling for treatment with an agent having a<br>
sedative or narcotic-type effect. Eating disorders include, for example, anorexia or<br>
appetite loss associated with a disease such as cancer or HIV infection/AIDS.<br>
In a treatment method according to the invention, an effective amount of a<br>
pharmaceutical agent according to the invention is administered to a subject<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2006/074025	PCT/US2005/047329<br>
suffering from or diagnosed as having such a disease, disorder or condition. An<br>
"effective amount" means an amount or dose sufficient to generally bring about<br>
the desired therapeutic or prophylactic benefit in patients in need of such<br>
treatment.<br>
Effective amounts or doses of the agents of the present invention may be<br>
ascertained by routine methods such as modeling, dose escalation studies or<br>
clinical trials, and by taking into consideration routine factors, e.g., the mode or<br>
route of administration or drug delivery, the pharmacokinetics of the agent, the<br>
severity and course of the disorder or condition, the subject's previous or ongoing<br>
therapy, the subject's health status and response to drugs, and the judgment of<br>
the treating physician. An exemplary dose is in the range of from about 0.001 to<br>
about 200 mg of agent per kg of subject's body weight per day, preferably about<br>
0.05 to 100 mg/kg/day, or about 1 to 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided dosage<br>
units (e.g., BID, TID, QID). For a 70-kg human, an illustrative range for a suitable<br>
dosage amount is from about 0.05 to about 7 g/day, or about 0.2 to about 2.5<br>
g/day.<br>
Once improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, the dose may<br>
be adjusted for preventative or maintenance treatment. For example, the dosage<br>
or the frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced as a function of the<br>
symptoms, to a level at which the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect is<br>
maintained. Of course, if symptoms have been alleviated to an appropriate level,<br>
treatment may cease. Patients may, however, require intermittent treatment on a<br>
long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms.<br>
In addition, the agents of the invention may be used in combination with<br>
additional active compounds in the treatment of the above conditions. The<br>
additional compounds may be coadministered separately with an agent of<br>
Formula (I) or included with such an agent as an additional active ingredient in a<br>
pharmaceutical composition according to the invention. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, additional active compounds are those that are known or discovered<br>
to be effective in the treatment of conditions, disorders, or diseases mediated by<br>
FAAH activity, such as another FAAH modulator or a compound active against<br>
32<br><br>
WO 2006/074025	PCT7US2005/047329<br>
another target associated with the particular condition, disorder, or disease. The<br>
combination may serve to increase efficacy (e.g., by including in the combination a<br>
compound potentiating the potency or effectiveness of an agent according to the<br>
invention), decrease one or more side effects, or decrease the required dose of<br>
the agent according to the invention. In one illustrative embodiment, a<br>
composition according to the invention may contain one or more additional active<br>
ingredients selected from opioids, NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, cyclooxygenase-2<br>
(COX-2) inhibitors, and naproxen), gabapentin, pregabalin, tramadol,<br>
acetaminophen, and aspirin.<br>
The agents of the invention are used, alone or in combination with one or<br>
more other active ingredients, to formulate pharmaceutical compositions of the<br>
invention. A pharmaceutical composition of the invention comprises: an effective<br>
amount of a pharmaceutical agent in accordance with the invention; and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.<br>
A "pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" refers to a substance that is not<br>
toxic, biologically intolerable, or otherwise biologically unsuitable for administration<br>
to a subject, such as an inert substance, added to a pharmacological composition<br>
or otherwise used as a vehicle, carrier, or diluent to facilitate administration of a<br>
pharmaceutical agent and that is compatible therewith. Examples of excipients<br>
include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of<br>
starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils and polyethylene glycols.<br>
Delivery forms of the pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more<br>
dosage units of the pharmaceutical agents may be prepared using suitable<br>
pharmaceutical excipients and compounding techniques now or later known or<br>
available to those skilled in the art. The compositions may be administered in the<br>
inventive methods by oral, parenteral, rectal, topical, or ocular routes or by<br>
inhalation.<br>
The preparation may be in the form of tablets, capsules, sachets, dragees,<br>
powders, granules, lozenges, powders for reconstitution, liquid preparations, or<br>
suppositories. Preferably, the compositions are formulated for intravenous<br>
infusion, topical administration, or oral administration.<br>
33<br><br>
WO 2006/074025	PCT/US2005/047329<br>
For oral administration, the compounds of the invention can be provided in<br>
the form of tablets or capsules, or as a solution, emulsion, or suspension. To<br>
prepare the oral compositions, the agents may be formulated to yield a dosage of,<br>
e.g., from about 0.05 to about 50 mg/kg daily, or from about 0.05 to about 20<br>
mg/kg daily, or from about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg daily.<br>
Oral tablets may include the active ingredient mixed with pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients such as inert diluents, disintegrating agents, binding agents,<br>
lubricating agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and<br>
preservatives agents. Suitable inert fillers include sodium and calcium carbonate,<br>
sodium and calcium phosphate, lactose, starch, sugar, glucose, methyl cellulose,<br>
magnesium stearate, mannitol, sorbitol, and the like. Exemplary liquid oral<br>
excipients include ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Starch, polyvinyl-<br>
pyrrolidone (PVP), sodium starch glycolate, microcrystalline cellulose, and alginic<br>
acid are suitable disintegrating agents. Binding agents may include starch and<br>
gelatin. The lubricating agent, if present, may be magnesium stearate, stearic<br>
acid or talc. If desired, the tablets may be coated with a material such as glyceryl<br>
monostearate or glyceryl distearate to delay absorption in the gastrointestinal<br>
tract, or may be coated with an enteric coating.<br>
Capsules for oral administration include hard and soft gelatin capsules. To<br>
prepare hard gelatin capsules, active ingredient may be mixed with a solid, semi-<br>
solid, or liquid diluent. Soft gelatin capsules may be prepared by mixing the active<br>
ingredient with water, an oil such as peanut oil or olive oil, liquid paraffin, a mixture<br>
of mono and di-glycerides of short chain fatty acids, polyethylene glycol 400, or<br>
propylene glycol.<br>
Liquids for oral administration may be in the form of suspensions, solutions,<br>
emulsions or syrups or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with<br>
water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid compositions may<br>
optionally contain: pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients such as suspending<br>
agents (for example, sorbitol, methyl cellulose, sodium alginate, gelatin,<br>
hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, aluminum stearate gel and the<br>
like); non-aqueous vehicles, e.g., oil (for example, almond oil or fractionated<br>
34<br><br>
WO 2006/074025	PCT/US2005/047329<br>
coconut oil), propylene glycol, ethyl alcohol or water; preservatives (for example,<br>
methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid); wetting agents such as<br>
lecithin; and, if desired, flavoring or coloring agents.<br>
The agents of this invention may also be administered by non-oral routes.<br>
For example, the compositions may be formulated for rectal administration as a<br>
suppository. For parenteral use, including intravenous, intramuscular,<br>
intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous routes, the agents of the invention may be<br>
provided in sterile aqueous solutions or suspensions, buffered to an appropriate<br>
pH and isotonicity or in parenterally acceptable oil. Suitable aqueous vehicles<br>
include Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride. Such forms will be<br>
presented in unit-dose form such as ampules or disposable injection devices, in<br>
multi-dose forms such as vials from which the appropriate dose may be<br>
withdrawn, or in a solid form or pre-concentrate that can be used to prepare an<br>
injectable formulation. Illustrative infusion doses may range from about 1 to 1000<br>
ng/kg/minute of agent, admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier over a period<br>
ranging from several minutes to several days.<br>
For topical administration, the agents may be mixed with a pharmaceutical<br>
carrier at a concentration of about 0.1 % to about 10% of drug to vehicle. Another<br>
mode of administering the agents of the invention may utilize a patch formulation<br>
to affect transdermal delivery.<br>
Agents may alternatively be administered in methods of this invention by<br>
inhalation, via the nasal or oral routes, e.g., in a spray formulation also containing<br>
a suitable carrier.<br>
Exemplary agents useful in methods of the invention will now be described<br>
by reference to the illustrative synthetic schemes for their general preparation<br>
below and the specific examples that follow. Artisans will recognize that, to obtain<br>
the various compounds herein, starting materials may be suitably selected so that<br>
the ultimately desired substituents will be carried through the reaction scheme with<br>
or without protection as appropriate to yield the desired product. Alternatively, it<br>
may be necessary or desirable to employ, in the place of the ultimately desired<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2006/074025	PCT/US2005/04732<br>
substituent, a suitable group that may be carried through the reaction scheme and<br>

solvent such as THF, DCE, DCM, methanol, ethanol, or diethyl ether at a<br>
temperature from 0 Â°C to 80 Â°C. The use of a promoter or catalyst with acidic<br>
character such as organometallic complexes or carboxylic acids may increase the<br>

Assay Method 1<br>
T84 frozen pellets (contents of 1-4 x 15 cm culture dishes) were<br>
homogenized in 300 mL of FAAH assay buffer (125 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2%<br>
glycerol, 0.02% Triton X-100, 0.4 mM Hepes, pH 9). The assay mixture was<br>
prepared from 50 uL of the cell homogenate, 10 uL of the test compound, and 40<br>
pL of anandamide [1-3H-ethanolamine] (3H-AEA; Perkin-Elmer, 10.3 Ci/mmol),<br>
which was added last, for a final tracer concentration of 200 nM. The reaction<br>
mixture was incubated at rt for 1 hour (h). During the incubation, 96-well<br>
Multiscreen filter plates (catalog number MAFCNOB50; Millipore, Bedford,<br>
102<br><br>
WO 2006/074025	PCT/US2005/047329<br>
Massachussetts, USA) were loaded with 25 uL of activated charcoal (Multiscreen<br>
column loader, catalog number MACL09625, Millipore) and washed once with 100<br>
uL of MeOH. Also during the incubation, 96-well DYNEX MicroLite plates (catalog<br>
number NL510410) were loaded with 100 uL of MicroScint40 (catalog number<br>
6013641, Packard Bioscience, Meriden, Connecticut, USA). After the 1 h<br>
incubation, 60 uL of the reaction mixture were transferred to the charcoal plates,<br>
which were then assembled on top of the DYNEX plates using Centrifuge<br>
Alignment Frames (catalog number MACF09604, Millipore). The unbound,<br>
labeled ethanolamine was centrifuged through to the bottom plate (5 min at 2000<br>
rpm), which was preloaded with the scintillant, as described above. The plates<br>
were sealed and left at rt for 1 h before counting on a Hewlett Packard TopCount.<br>

Assay Method 2<br>
A. Transfection of Cells with Human FAAH<br>
A 10-cm tissue culture dish with a confluent monolayer of SK-N-MC cells<br>
was split 2 days (d) prior to transfection. Using sterile technique, the media was<br>
removed and the cells were detached from the dish by the addition of trypsin.<br>
One fifth of the cells were then placed onto a new 10-cm dish. Cells were grown<br>
in a 37 Â°C incubator with 5% CO2 in Minimal Essential Media Eagle with 10% Fetal<br>
Bovine Serum. After 2 d, cells were approximately 80% confluent. These cells<br>
were removed from the dish with trypsin and pelleted in a clinical centrifuge. The<br>
pellet was re-suspended in 400 ï­L complete media and transferred to an<br>
electroporation cuvette with a 0.4 cm gap between the electrodes. Supercoiled<br>
human FAAH cDNA (1 ug) was added to the cells and mixed. The voltage for the<br>
electroporation was set at 0.25 kV, and the capacitance was set at 960 ï­F. After<br>
electroporation, the cells were diluted into complete media (10 mL) and plated<br>
onto four 10-cm dishes. Because of the variability in the efficiency of<br>
electroporation, four different concentrations of cells were plated. The ratios used<br>
were 1:20, 1:10, and 1:5, with the remainder of the cells being added to the fourth<br>
dish. The cells were allowed to recover for 24 h before adding the selection<br>
media (complete media with 600 ng/mL G418). After 10 d, dishes were analyzed<br>
for surviving colonies of cells. Dishes with well-isolated colonies were used. Cells<br>
from individual colonies were isolated and tested. The clones that showed the<br>
most FAAH activity, as measured by anandamide hydrolysis, were used for further<br>
study.<br>
B. FAAH Assay<br>
T84 frozen cell pellets or transfected SK-N-MC cells (contents of 1 x 15 cm<br>
culture dishes) were homogenized in 50 mL of FAAH assay buffer (125 mM Tris,<br>
1mM EDTA, 0.2% Glycerol, 0.02% Triton X-100, 0.4 mM Hepes, pH 9). The<br>
assay mixture consisted of 50ï­L of the cell homogenate, 10 ^L of the test<br>
compound, and 40 nL of anandamide [1-3H-ethanolamine] (3H-AEA, Perkin-Elmer,<br>
10.3 C/mmol), which was added last, for a final tracer concentration of 80 nM.<br>
105<br><br>
