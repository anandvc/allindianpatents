Safety arrangement for a switchgear assembly, in<br>
particular for a medium-voltage switchgear assembly<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a fuse arrangement for a<br>
switchgear assembly, in particular for a medium-voltage<br>
switchgear assembly, in accordance with the<br>
precharacterizing clause of claim 1.<br>
Such  a  fuse  arrangement  has  been  disclosed,  for<br>
example,  in  DE 41  16  058.  This  fuse arrangement<br>
comprises   a   cylindrical   cartridge-type   holder<br>
consisting of insulating material, which is sealed at<br>
one end and has a contact-making device there for a<br>
fuse cartridge inserted into the holder. At the other,<br>
open end,  a holder cover is arranged which bears<br>
against the free end side of the holder and is screwed<br>
fixedly there. An electrically conductive connection<br>
between the fuse and a connection contact is produced<br>
by a tensioning apparatus, which has an inner ring with<br>
an outer cone and an outer ring with an inner cone,<br>
which  are  in  the  form of  spring  ring  tensioning<br>
elements. The movement of the tripping pin on the fuse<br>
is transferred to a striker pin by means of a slide and<br>
a deflecting lever, which striker pin is guided such<br>
that  it  can move  in  the holder  cover  and  runs<br>
perpendicularly to the mid-axis of the fuse.<br>
FR 2 607 330 has disclosed a fuse arrangement in which<br>
a fuse is introduced into a cylindrical container<br>
sealed at one end; a contact cylinder, with whose inner<br>
face the inner end of the fuse comes into contact, is<br>
located within the container at the sealed end. This<br>
contact container has a journal, which is passed out of<br>
the bottom side of the container, with the result that<br>
an electrical line can be connected there. The opposite<br>
open end of the container has an inner cone form, which<br><br>
WO 2006/089643	PCT/EP2006/001138<br>
   - 2 -<br>
tapers towards the container interior and which<br>
interacts with a likewise conical stopper, whose outer<br>
face is matched thereto, the outer face of the stopper<br>
being pressed by the cover against the inner face of<br>
the cone form on the container. In the region of the<br>
free end of the cylindrical container, there is a<br>
contact element on the inner side which is passed to<br>
the outside, with the result that a further electrical<br>
conductor can be connected from the outside. A similar<br>
electrode is also integrally formed on the contact<br>
cylinder, with the result that there are in total three<br>
connection possibilities: a first one at the open end,<br>
the second one at the closed end, both running<br>
perpendicularly to the mid-axis of the fuse, and the<br>
third running in the direction of the mid-axis of the<br>
fuse at the lower end.<br>
A similar embodiment is also described in<br>
EP 0 81 653 Al. The fuse container, into which the fuse<br>
is inserted, is sealed at one end and has a contact<br>
cylinder there which has a projection which protrudes<br>
in the direction of the fuse longitudinal axis from the<br>
bottom of the container. The other end, in the same way<br>
as in the arrangement according to FR 2 607 330, is<br>
sealed by means of a cone stopper consisting of elastic<br>
material, no further details being given as to how the<br>
stopper is fixed. In all known arrangements, easy<br>
removal of the fuse is not possible.<br>
EP 0 389 029 Al has disclosed a fuse arrangement which<br>
has a container consisting of an insulating material<br>
which is closed at one end, into which container the<br>
fuse can be inserted; a grip device being provided at<br>
the other end which makes it possible for the fuse to<br>
be removed. This grip device has a shaft consisting of<br>
an insulating material, which is introduced into the<br>
interior of the container. The shaft has an<br>
electrically conductive contact sleeve at the inner<br><br>
WO 2006/089643	PCT/EP2006/001138<br>
   - 3 -<br>
end, which contact sleeve comes into electrically<br>
conductive connection with the adjacent contact of the<br>
fuse. At its other end, it has a grip device, which is<br>
formed from a plate on which two walls are fitted which<br>
are arranged perpendicularly with respect thereto and<br>
are fixed thereto and between which there is a spindle<br>
which acts as a shaft for manipulating the grip device.<br>
The object of the invention is to further improve a<br>
fuse arrangement of the type mentioned at the outset<br>
such that removal and fitting of the fuse is<br>
simplified.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by<br>
the features of claim 1.<br>
Accordingly, the invention is characterized by virtue<br>
of the fact that the fuse cartridge is fixedly<br>
connected at its first end to a closure apparatus which<br>
is arranged on the front side, preferably on the frame<br>
or on the front wall of the switchgear assembly, which<br>
closure apparatus has a sealing body, whose outer face<br>
has an outer cone form tapering in the direction of the<br>
fuse and corresponding to a matched inner cone form at<br>
the first end of the insulating container, and a<br>
sealing head connected to the sealing body, and that a<br>
spring arrangement is provided between the sealing body<br>
and the sealing head, which spring arrangement exerts a<br>
force on the sealing body which presses it into the<br>
inner cone form of the insulating container in the<br>
fitted position, the sealing head being arranged<br>
outside of the insulating body.<br>
In a particularly advantageous manner, a spring<br>
arrangement is provided which has a nonlinear spring<br>
characteristic. Such a nonlinear spring characteristic<br>
preferably has a disk spring arrangement having at<br>
least one disk spring.<br><br>
WO 2006/089643	PCT/EP2006/001138<br>
   - 4 -<br>
In accordance with a particularly advantageous<br>
configuration of the invention, at least one pair of<br>
springs comprising two disk springs is provided, the<br>
disk springs of each pair of springs bearing against<br>
one another at their inner edges and bearing against<br>
the sealing body or the sealing head with their outer<br>
edges.<br>
A preferred configuration may be that the sealing body<br>
consists at least partially of a soft-elastic material,<br>
for example silicone rubber. In this case, the sealing<br>
body may either consist completely of a soft-elastic<br>
material or be provided with a soft-elastic layer on<br>
its outer cone form. It is naturally also possible for<br>
a soft-elastic layer for sealing purposes to be<br>
provided on the inner cone form in the same way as on<br>
the outer cone form.<br>
Preferably, when the sealing body consists of a soft-<br>
elastic material, a plate is fitted on the end face<br>
facing the sealing head, which plate transfers the<br>
force of the spring arrangement onto the sealing body.<br>
In accordance with an advantageous configuration, the<br>
sealing head is coupled to a lever arrangement, with<br>
which the sealing head can be brought from a position<br>
in which the spring arrangement is tensioned into a<br>
position in which the spring arrangement is relieved of<br>
tension, and back again.<br>
In accordance with a particularly advantageous<br>
configuration of the invention, a holding arrangement,<br>
which has a tulip-shaped finger arrangement located on<br>
a circular circumference, can be fitted to the fuse-<br>
side end of the sealing body, with which holding<br>
arrangement the first end of the fuse is mechanically<br>
and fixedly connected. A tensioning element, with which<br><br>
WO 2006/089643	PCT/EP2006/001138<br>
- 5 -<br>
the finger arrangement is pressed against the fuse,<br>
also belongs to the finger arrangement.<br>
Further advantageous configurations of the invention<br>
are given in the further dependent claims.<br>
The invention, further advantageous configurations and<br>
improvements and further advantages will be explained<br>
and described in more detail with reference to the<br>
drawing, in which an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
invention is illustrated and in which:<br>
figure 1 shows a front view of a switchgear assembly<br>
having a fuse arrangement,<br>
figure 2 shows a schematic sectional view through<br>
the first end of a fuse container with a<br>
fuse inserted,<br>
figure 3 shows a perspective sectional view of the<br>
other end of the insulating container,<br>
without a fuse,<br>
figure 4 shows a sectional view of a sealing body<br>
with a sealing head,<br>
figure 5 shows a perspective view of a lever<br>
arrangement, with which the sealing head<br>
and sealing body can be removed or fitted,<br>
and<br>
figure 6 shows a force/path length characteristic of<br>
a spring arrangement between the sealing<br>
head and the sealing body.<br>
A switchgear assembly, as is known, for example, from<br>
DE (Mp. No. 05/525) submitted at the same time, has a<br>
switchpanel 10, in whose upper region busbars 11 are<br><br>
WO 2006/089643	PCT/EP2006/001138<br>
 - 6 -<br>
fitted, to which switch disconnectors 12 are connected.<br>
The lower end of the switch disconnectors, i.e. of each<br>
individual switch disconnector pole 12, is electrically<br>
conductively connected with conductors 13, 14 and 15 to<br>
in each case one fuse arrangement 16, 17 and 18. The<br>
fuse arrangements 16 to 18 are located beneath the<br>
switch disconnector poles, and cable connection points<br>
19, 20 and 21 are provided beneath the fuse<br>
arrangements 16 to 18, which cable connection points<br>
are electrically conductively connected to the fuse<br>
arrangements 16 to 18 via further conductors 22, 23,<br>
24.<br>
In this case, the conductors 13, 14 and 15 are<br>
connected at the second end of the insulating<br>
container, whereas the conductors 22, 23 and 24, which<br>
lead to the cable connection points 19, 20 and 21, are<br>
connected to the fuse arrangements 16 to 18<br>
approximately in the central region, measured in the<br>
longitudinal direction of said fuse arrangements.<br>
Reference is now made to figure 2.<br>
A fuse arrangement according to the invention comprises<br>
a cylindrical insulating body 30, whose end located on<br>
the left-hand side in the drawing, i.e. the second end<br>
31, is sealed with an electrically conductive cap 32,<br>
the cap 32 with a cylindrical wall 33 surrounding the<br>
outer face of the insulating body 30. In this case, the<br>
insulating body 30 has a groove 30a on its outer face,<br>
into which groove an annular fixing element 30b is<br>
inserted, to which the cylindrical wall 33 of the cap<br>
32 is fastened. A peripheral flute 32b, which is<br>
directly opposite a flute 30c in the region of the end<br>
edge of the insulating body 30, is introduced on the<br>
inner face 32a of the cap 32 in the region of the wall<br>
33; a seal 32c, preferably an 0 ring seal, is inserted<br>
into the peripheral toroid formed thereby. Furthermore,<br><br>
WO 2006/089643	PCT/EP2006/001138<br>
- 7 -<br>
a contact arrangement 34 is also fastened to the inner<br>
face 32a, which contact arrangement has a tulip contact<br>
form.<br>
A connection 35 is provided on the outer face of the<br>
wall 32, to which connection the conductor 13 is<br>
intended to be connected radially, for example.<br>
A fuse 36 is located within the cylindrical container<br>
or the insulating container 30, a contact bolt 37<br>
protruding from one front end of said fuse, which<br>
contact bolt is brought into electrically conductive<br>
connection with the contact arrangement 34. Contact is<br>
made between the other end of the fuse 36 and a contact<br>
device, see further below, which is electrically<br>
conductively connected to a connection 39, which runs<br>
perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the fuse<br>
36, via lines 38 running internally on the insulating<br>
body 30, which connection 39 is located approximately<br>
in the center between the two ends of the insulating<br>
body 30 and is connected to in each case one conductor<br>
22, 23, 24.<br>
Reference is now made to figures 3 and 4.<br>
The insulating container 30 has, at its first end 31a,<br>
which is opposite the second end with the metal cap 32,<br>
see figure 3, a cone face 40 on its inner face, which<br>
cone face tapers or extends outwards into the interior<br>
of the insulating container. A sealing body 41, which<br>
consists of an elastic material, for example of<br>
silicone, and whose outer face 42 has a cone form,<br>
which tapers into the interior of the container 30 and<br>
is matched to the inner cone face 40, is inserted into<br>
this cone face 40. A sealing head 43 is coupled to the<br>
sealing body 41, the sealing head 43 being capable of<br>
moving to a slight extent in relation to the sealing<br>
body 41. An insulating tube 44 is guided within the<br><br>
WO 2006/089643	PCT/EP2006/001138<br>
  - 8 -<br>
sealing body 41, which insulating tube has an outer<br>
thread 4 5 at the end located on the left-hand side in<br>
the drawing in figure 4 and faces the fuse, with which<br>
outer thread the tube 44 is screwed into a connecting<br>
ring 46 with an inner thread. At the tapered end, the<br>
sealing body 41 has a bowl-like depression 47, against<br>
whose inner face 48 a bearing ring 49 consisting of an<br>
electrically  conductive  material  is  applied,  which<br>
bearing ring is matched to the contour of the inner<br>
face 48 and, when the fuse is in operation, is at a<br>
high-voltage potential. The bearing ring 4 9 also bears<br>
against the inner face 48. The bearing ring 49 has a<br>
bell form, the open side of the bell form being opened<br>
in the direction into the interior of the insulating<br>
container. The sealing body 41 surrounds the outer face<br>
48 of the bell form; this bell form is selected such<br>
that the sealing body 41 is supported on its total<br>
outer face 42 in the direction of the outer face 42<br>
when it is compressed. Webs 50, 51 of fixing elements<br>
52,  53, which webs are bent back inwards, are held<br>
fixedly between the L-shaped ring 46 and the bearing<br>
element 49, the long limbs 52a, 53a of said fixing<br>
elements running perpendicularly to the longitudinal<br>
extent of the fuse. Only two fixing elements 52, 53 are<br>
shown in figure 4; however, a plurality of them are<br>
arranged which together form a type of tulip, which is<br>
surrounded on the outside by means of a tensioning<br>
device 54, with the result that the inner diameter of<br>
the fixing elements 52, 53 is variable. The first end<br>
of the fuse 36,  which is illustrated partially by<br>
dashed lines here, is plugged with a protrusion 36a<br>
between the fixing elements 52, 53 and held fixedly<br>
between the fixing elements 52, 53 by the tensioning<br>
device 54, which surrounds the fixing elements 52, 53<br>
on the outside and may be a tube-tensioning shell,<br>
pressing these fixing elements 52, 54 against the outer<br>
face of the protrusion 36a, with the result that the<br>
fuse 36 is fixedly connected to the sealing head 41.<br><br>
WO 2006/089643	PCT/EP2006/001138<br>
   - 9 -<br>
Contact springs 131 are fitted to the fixing elements<br>
52, 53, which also act as contact fingers, which<br>
contact springs are pressed radially outwards by a<br>
resilient tensioning ring 132 in such a way that, when<br>
the sealing body 41 is inserted into the container 30<br>
together with the fuse 36, these contact elements 131<br>
are pressed against contact elements 133, which<br>
correspond to the line 38. The current therefore flows<br>
through the fuse 36 to the fixing elements 52 and 53<br>
and therefore to the contact elements 131 and, via the<br>
inner line 133, 38, to the connection point 39. The<br>
inner line 38 may be formed from a plurality of<br>
elongate conductor sections, which are fitted to the<br>
inner face of the insulating container 30.<br>
Belonging to the fuse (not illustrated) is a<br>
transmission element 55, to which a tripping rod 56 is<br>
connected, which is guided movably through the interior<br>
of the tube 44 and, in the position illustrated in<br>
figure 4, does not protrude beyond the sealing head 43.<br>
In the event of the fuse responding, the tripping rod<br>
36 is moved in the arrow direction P by means of a<br>
spring, as a result of which tripping for a<br>
superordinate circuit breaker is carried out.<br>
A guide element 57 for the tripping rod 56 is<br>
integrally formed on the inner side of the tube 44 in<br>
the region of the thread, which guide element is<br>
annular and is connected to the inner wall of the tube<br>
44 via a peripheral conical web 58. The conical web 58<br>
opens towards the thread 45. A peripheral flute 59 is<br>
provided on the side of the guide element 57 which<br>
faces away from the thread 45, into which flute a seal<br>
60 is inserted. The guide element 57 has a through-<br>
opening 134, through which the tripping rod 26 is<br>
guided.<br><br>
WO 2006/089643	PCT/EP2006/001138<br>
- 10 -<br>
The other end of the tube 44 protrudes out of the<br>
sealing body 41 and ends in an extension 61, which<br>
adjoins said sealing body in stepped fashion and whose<br>
outer diameter is greater than the outer diameter of<br>
the tube 44. A peripheral rim 63 of a bowl body 64,<br>
whose bottom 65 has a guide passage 66 for the tripping<br>
rod 56, bears against the step 62 formed by the<br>
extension 61. A flute 67, in which a seal 68 is<br>
introduced, is located on the outside of the bottom 66.<br>
Two approximately tubular spacer elements 69 and 70 are<br>
located between the carrier element 57 and the bottom<br>
65, which spacer elements are guided at opposite ends<br>
by flange rims 71 and 72 within the tube 44 and bear<br>
against one another with the adjacent ends. The outer<br>
diameter of the flange rims 71, 72 corresponds to the<br>
inner diameter of the tubes 44. These spacer elements<br>
69 and 70, with their flange rims 71 and 72, serve the<br>
purpose of absorbing any pressure forces which may<br>
occur and which also act inwards when the sealing body<br>
is compressed. The area 135, which is located between<br>
the flange rims 71 and 72 within the tube 44, is filled<br>
with insulating oil, which can also flow into the<br>
intermediate area between the spacer elements 69, 70<br>
and the tripping rod 56 via radial openings 136, which<br>
are located at least in the spacer element 39.<br>
The bowl body 64 has, in the region of its free end,<br>
i.e. in the region of the peripheral rim 63, a bead 137<br>
which protrudes radially outwards and, on the inner<br>
face of the extension 63, a peripheral inwardly<br>
protruding tab 138 is integrally formed; if the bowl<br>
body 64 is pressed into the interior of the tube 44,<br>
the bead 137 latches behind the peripheral tab 138,<br>
with the result that the bowl body 64 is fixed there.<br>
Furthermore, a peripheral flute 139, in which a seal<br>
140 is located, is located in the bottom of the bowl<br>
body on its outer face, i.e. on its face facing the<br><br>
WO 2006/089643	PCT/EP2006/001138<br>
  - 11 -<br>
area 135. The seals 60, 68 and 140 serve the purpose of<br>
sealing the interior 135, with the result that the<br>
insulating oil located there is prevented from flowing<br>
out of the area 135, and are thus used for preventing<br>
any leaks.<br>
The sealing head 43, in which the extension 61 is<br>
located, has a passage opening 73, which, in the<br>
direction towards the sealing body 41, has a step 74,<br>
which interacts with the step 62 of the tube, a<br>
distance being provided between the two in the position<br>
illustrated.<br>
The tube 44, which consists of an insulating material,<br>
has a cone form on its outer face, which cone form<br>
tapers towards the fuse.<br>
A carrier plate 80 is located on the end of the sealing<br>
body 43 away from the fuse, and two disk springs 82 and<br>
83 are located between the carrier plate 80 and the<br>
face 81 opposite it, which disk springs are under<br>
mechanical stress, i.e. are tensioned, in the position<br>
illustrated in figure 4 and press the sealing body 41<br>
into the inner cone 40 of the insulating container 30<br>
in the opposite direction to the arrow direction P.<br>
Instead of such disk springs, a helical spring<br>
arrangement may naturally also be provided. It is<br>
particularly important that the spring arrangement has<br>
a nonlinear characteristic, as illustrated in figure 6.<br>
The path length by which the spring is compressed is<br>
plotted on the horizontal axis, and the force which<br>
compresses the spring is plotted on the vertical axis.<br>
The characteristic K of the spring arrangement, as is<br>
desired, has a rise, which is reduced as the path<br>
length increases. As a result, in the event of a<br>
difference in path length us in the region in which the<br>
rise of the characteristic K is smaller, there is a<br><br>

In each case one post-like support 104, 105; 106, 107<br>
and 108 and 109 is positioned perpendicularly on both<br>
sides of each opening 101 to 103, which supports each<br>
comprise two identical support elements 104a and 104b,<br>
which are at a distance from one another. The supports<br>
105 to 109 are identical to the support 104 with the<br>
two support elements 104a and 104b.<br>
In each case one arm 110 and 111 of a handle<br>
arrangement 112, in this case only the handle<br>
arrangement 112 for the opening 101 is described,<br>
engages between the support elements of each support;<br>
the handle arrangement for the openings 102 and 103<br>
have an identical design. The two arms 110 and 111 run<br>
approximately parallel to one another and together with<br>
two bent-back portions 113 and 114 arranged at an angle<br>
thereto, form a U shape; the bent-back portions 113 and<br>
114 are provided (not visibly) on their ends pointing<br>
towards one another with further bent-back portions,<br>
which run parallel to the arms 110 and 111 and<br>
perpendicularly to the connecting line of the posts 104<br>
and 105, these two bent-back portions as extensions<br>
being surrounded by a handle 115 consisting of<br>
insulating material. The length of the handles is<br>
dimensioned such that, in each position in which the<br>
handles 115 run parallel to the plate, they remain<br>
within the region which is delimited by side walls,<br>
with the result that the movement of the handles is not<br>
impeded by wall sections.<br>
The arms 110 and 111 are connected in articulated<br>
fashion to the posts 104 and 105 via rotating journals<br>
116 and 117, with the result that the handle<br>
arrangement 112 can be pivoted from the position in<br>
which the arms run parallel to the plate 100 into a<br>
position in which the arms run perpendicularly to the<br>
plate, as is the case for the handle 115. The handles<br>
can naturally also be brought into a position in which<br><br>
WO 2006/089643	PCT/EP2006/001138<br>
 - 14 -<br>
they are pivoted through 180° with respect to the<br>
position illustrated in figure 5, with the result that<br>
the handles 115 protrude in the opposite direction to<br>
that which is illustrated in figure 5.<br>
The arms 110 and 111 each have a cutout 118 and 119/<br>
the ends of the posts 104, 105 being slit in the form<br>
of a fork with a fork opening 120 and 121.<br>
The journals 84 and 85 of the sealing head 43 engage in<br>
a cutout 118 and pass through it and likewise engage in<br>
the fork opening 120, 121.<br>
In the position shown in figure 5, the handles press<br>
the journals 84, 85 into the interior of the insulating<br>
container via the cutouts 118, 119, as a result of<br>
which the disk springs 83, 82 are prestressed by a<br>
predetermined force, with the result that the sealing<br>
body 41 is likewise pressed into the inner cone face on<br>
the insulating body with a specific force, as a result<br>
of which electrical sealing is provided between the two<br>
cone faces.<br>
If the handles 115 are brought out of one end position<br>
into their other end position, the journals 84, 85<br>
slide into the cutouts 118, 119 because they are fixed<br>
in their position by the fork opening 120 or 121 and,<br>
owing to the curved form of the cutouts 118 and 119,<br>
the journals 84, 85 and therefore the sealing head 43<br>
are removed from the plate 100 in the arrow direction P<br>
(see figure 4), as a result of which the spring<br>
arrangement is relieved of tension, with the result<br>
that the force of pressure on the sealing body is<br>
reduced or dissipated such that the fuse can be removed<br>
in a simple manner.<br><br>
WO 2006/089643	PCT/EP2006/001138<br>
  - 15 -<br>
Once the fuse has been inserted into the interior of<br>
the insulating container, the movements of the handles<br>
are reversed.<br>
It has been described above that the sealing body 41 in<br>
its entirety consists of a soft-elastic material. It is<br>
naturally also possible for the sealing body to be<br>
produced from a rigid material and for only the outer<br>
cone face to be coated with a soft-elastic material.<br>
Similarly, it is naturally also possible for the<br>
sealing body to be produced from a rigid material and<br>
for the inner cone face of the insulating container to<br>
be coated with this material.<br>
In both cases, care naturally needs to be taken to<br>
ensure that, as in the embodiment shown in figure 4,<br>
the touching faces of the inner and outer cone are<br>
sealed over the entire axial length and over the entire<br>
radial circumference, with the result that there are no<br>
areas there in which discharges may result which can<br>
damage or destroy the sealing body and therefore the<br>
entire fuse arrangement.<br><br>
