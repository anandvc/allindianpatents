"DENTAL ARTICULATORS"<br>
AURANGABADKAR ANAY VILAS<br>
An Indian National<br>
of No. 2, Murali Sheela, Opp. HirmayJogging Track,<br>
Sambhaji Nagar, Behind HPT College Road,<br>
Nasik-422005, Maharashtra, India.<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to dental articulators. In particular this invention relates to plaster free dental articulators.<br>
BACKGROUND:<br>
With particular reference to dentistry and intended only as a quick reference<br>
aid, following basic terms are defined below:<br>
Maxilla:<br>
The irregularly shaped upper jaw bone in a vertebrate that is fused to the<br>
cranium (part of the skull that encloses the brain).<br>
Mandible:<br>
The horse-shoe shaped bone forming the lower jaw.<br>
Condyle:<br>
A round bump on a bone where it forms a joint with another bone.<br>
Mandibular Condyle:<br>
The condyle of the ramus that articulates with the skull.<br>
Temporomandibular joint:<br>
The joint which connects the lower jaw to the temporal bone of the cranium.<br>
Occlusion:<br>
The spatial relationship of the teeth in the maxilla and mandible, when the<br>
jaws are closed.<br>
Mai occlusion:<br>
"Bad bite" or misalignment of the upper and lower teeth, when the jaws are<br>
closed.<br>
Mastication:<br>
The process of chewing food.<br>
2<br><br>
Denture:<br>
A dental appliance that artificially replaces missing teeth. Also called a<br>
prosthodontic appliance.<br>
Prosthesis:<br>
An artificial substitute for a missing body part, such as an arm, leg, eye or<br>
tooth; used for functional or cosmetic reasons or both.<br>
Sutura:<br>
An immovable joint (especially between the bones of the skull).<br>
Sagital:<br>
Located in a plane that is parallel to the central plane of the Sagital suture.<br>
Incisor:<br>
A tooth for cutting or gnawing; located in the front of the mouth in both<br>
jaws.<br>
Molars:<br>
Grinding tooth with a broad crown; consisting of premolars and molars.<br>
located in both jaws.<br>
Canine:<br>
One of the four pointed conical teeth (two in each jaw) located between the<br>
incisors and the premolars.<br>
Teeth are attached to the underlying bone of the jaw via the periodontal ligament. The white part of the tooth, which can be seen in the mouth, is called the enamel. Immediately below the enamel is a slightly softer, yellow tissue called dentin. Dentin is supported by the pulp, which lies in the center of the tooth. The teeth's composition is specialized to resist the harsh environment of the oral cavity and withstand the large forces imposed upon them by mastication.<br>
3<br><br>
Plaque is a soft white layer which forms on teeth, containing large amounts of bacteria of various types. Left unchecked for a few days plaque will harden, especially near the gums, forming tartar. Bacteria in the mouth live off the remains of foods, especially sugars. In the absence of oxygen they produce lactic acid, which dissolves the calcium and phosphorus in the enamel in a process known as demineralisation. Loss of enamel causes infection and leads to cavitation of the teeth and results in a disease called dental caries.<br>
Archaeological evidence shows that dental caries is an ancient disease. Skulls supposedly dating from a million years ago, through the Neolithic period, show signs of dental decay. In the initial stages of the disease the tooth can be saved by certain dental procedures like filling and root canal treatment. If left untreated, severe damage of the tooth takes place and then the tooth has to be extracted. Patients suffering from tooth decay or other damages often require replacement of either a part or the complete dentures. Impressions of maxillary and mandibular arches of the patient are taken and using it as a mould, a positive dental cast is made. Positive casts are replicas of patient's arches with or without teeth. These casts are the primary form on which the dental prosthesis is constructed.<br>
In constructing a dental prosthesis a dental technician encounters many challenging problems. Each of the tooth to be replaced is a three dimensional piece which has to match with another three dimensional tooth, existing or fitted, in the other jaw and at the same maintain interrelationship with<br>
4<br><br>
reference to adjacent teeth. Certain teeth like the molars and canine have matched mating surface that enmesh with each other to improve mastication. Other teeth like incisors are so positioned to bite and tear into food articles and have pincer like movement but fit snugly with reference to each other when the jaw is in a closed position. To complicate the matter further the temporomandibular joint permits movement in the vertical axis and also in the horizontal axis to a certain extent. All the above relative positioning and inter relation of teeth has to be perfect to obtain a proper fitment of the denture. Any mismatch results in discomfort and disfigurement of the facial muscles of the patient. To prepare a dental prosthesis technicians mount the cast in a device commonly referred to as an articulator.<br>
The articulator is a mechanical device used in dentistry to which casts of the maxillary and mandibular teeth are fixed and it reproduces the recorded positions of the mandible in relation to the maxilla. An articulator assists in the fabrication of removable prosthodontic appliances (dentures), fixed prosthodontic restorations (crowns, bridges, inlays and on lays) and orthodontic appliances.<br>
There are various types of articulators in use.<br>
A plane line articulator is the simplest type of articulator consisting of a<br>
simple hinge joint. No lateral or sliding movements are possible with a plane<br>
line articulator.<br>
An anatomical articulator attempts to reproduce normal mandibular<br>
movements during mastication.<br>
5<br><br>
A semi-adjustable articulator is an articulator that allows movement of the<br>
mandible only in a Sagital plane.<br>
An adjustable articulator can be adjusted to accommodate the many<br>
movements and positions of the mandible in relation to the maxilla as<br>
recorded in the mouth.<br>
Another classification of the articulator is based on which member of the<br>
articulator is provided with the condylar movement of the mandible.<br>
In an "arcon" type of articulator the condylar elements are on the mandibular member and the condylar paths are on the maxillary member of the articulator.<br>
In a "non arcon" type of articulator the condylar paths are on the mandibular member of the articulator and the condylar elements are placed on the maxillary member of the articulator.<br>
The term ARCON was coined by Bergstrom from AR-ticulator and CON-dyle. An arcon type of articulator is anatomically correct and makes the understanding of the mandibular movement easier as opposed to the non arcon articulator wherein the movements are the reverse of the actual movement of the temporomandibular joint.<br>
An articulator should meet the following requirements:<br>
The articulator must accurately maintain the correct horizontal and vertical relationships and reproduce the recorded positions of the mandible in relation to the maxilla.<br>
6<br><br>
The articulator should have an incisor guide pin to locate the centre of the<br>
incisor with a positive stop.<br>
The articulator should be able to open and close in a hinge-like fashion and<br>
maintaining the pre set positions of the casts.<br>
The articulator should allow protrusive and lateral movements of the<br>
mandible.<br>
The construction should be accurate, rigid and the moving parts should resist<br>
wear.<br>
There should be adequate space between the upper and lower members and<br>
the dental technician should have clear and unobstructed view of the casts.<br>
The conventional articulators consist of a upper and lower holding members<br>
and the casts are mounted on the articulator by means of plaster and the casts<br>
are adjusted manually by trial and error method.<br>
Conventional mounting procedure using plaster involves the following steps:<br>
1.	After preparing a positive dental cast of the maxillary and mandibular<br>
arches, indexing grooves are made on the upper and lower casts and jaw<br>
relation, which is recorded in the patient's mouth, is sealed to the cast<br>
with modeling wax.<br>
2.	A suitable separating medium is applied to the upper &amp; lower members<br>
of articulator<br>
3.	A thread is attached to the articulator and taken around the cast to serve as the reference occlusion plane.<br>
4.	Maxillary and mandibular casts with occlusal rims are positioned as per the jaw relation record on the articulator and further adjusted according to thread relation.<br>
7<br><br>
5.	Then the jaw relation record is adjusted as per the thread relation on the posterior portion on both sides and anterior portion with a vertical rod<br>
6.	After this the base of the cast and indexing grooves are painted with the separating medium<br>
7.	Dental plaster is placed on the base and indexing grooves of the upper cast and then the upper cast is attached to the upper member of the articulator and the dental plaster is allowed to set.<br>
8.	At this stage the articulator is placed upside down.<br>
9.	The base of the lower cast and indexing grooves are painted with the separating media.<br>
10.	Dental plaster is placed on the base and indexing grooves of the lower cast<br>
11.	Care is exercised to see that the contact is made between the vertical rod and incisal table and that the occlusal plane coincides with thread relation.<br>
The mounting procedure as above is cumbersome and the use of plaster may create procedural errors and the process is very time consuming. To solve this problem plaster-less mounting dental articulators have been envisaged. Some such articulators, suggested in the prior art are described below together with their advantages and limitations.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
US Patent 5720613 discloses a dental articulator for supporting and positioning upper and lower dental casts using a disposable mounting platform removably positioned on the brackets of hinged arms. The casts are<br>
8<br><br>
fixed to the mounting platform with adhesives. There are no provisions for fine adjustment of the casts with reference to each other. This articulator may be classified as a plane line articulator with a provision for vertical adjustment of the maxillary member. The condylar movement of the temporomandibular joint is not reproduced to verify occlusion.<br>
Another US Patent 5716209 discloses a plaster-less mounting dental articulator with trays mounted on both base and top having upstanding side-wall elements. According to this invention the hard molds are press fitted to the trays. The top tray is provided with adjustment in vertical and horizontal planes and the bottom tray is mounted on a sub plate with a dove-tail groove to permit horizontal plane adjustment. The adjustments provided on the top and bottom trays are with reference to planes which are normal to each other and no provision is available to tilt the planes with reference to each other. Also the condylar movement of the temporomandibular joint is not reproduced to verify occlusion.<br>
Another US Patent 4460338 discloses a plaster-less dental articulator for mounting casts which has locating pins to engage cast apertures and adjustable retaining screws. The top plate is provided with adjustment in vertical and horizontal planes and the bottom plate is mounted on a sub plate with a dove-tail groove to permit horizontal plane adjustment. The adjustments provided on the top and bottom plates are with reference to planes which are normal to each other and no provision is available to tilt the planes with reference to each other.<br>
9<br><br>
Yet another US patent 4358269 discloses a dental articulator for mounting and adjusting paired dental casts without the use of mounting plaster. The casts are held in place by means of contoured locating stops engaging suitable cavities formed on the side walls of the cast by cutters. The adjustments provided on the top and bottom plates are with reference to planes which are normal to each other and no provision is available to tilt the planes with reference to each other.<br>
Another US Patent 4517043 discloses a custom denture fabrication technique using an articulator with a square raised nipple, a ferromagnetic disc, magnets and a square keying device. The mounting arrangement provided does not reproduce the movement of the temporomandibular joint.<br>
It is clear that several attempts have been made in the prior art to obviate the use of plaster in the process of manufacturing dental prosthesis. The articulator as revealed in the above listed patents are far from satisfactory and there is still a need for an inexpensive dental articulator that can be used without plaster and provide all the convenience and flexibility in fabrication of dental prosthesis.<br>

cast holding plate 200 on the triangular shaped hinged upper member 80 and to permit the leveling and other adjustment of the plate within the cage.<br>
The leveling elements provided on the lower member and the upper member allows fine adjustment of the mounted casts with reference to each other in horizontal and vertical axis. The three point support arrangement of the cast assembly plate permits tilting of the plane of a cast held thereupon with reference to both horizontal and vertical planes.<br>
The procedure of mounting the dental casts on the articulator according to the present invention is as given below.<br>
1.	Mandibular cast is placed on the cast holding plate mounted on the lower member of the articulator and adjusted as per jaw relationship record of the patient.<br>
2.	Using clamping screws the mandibular cast is fixed to the cast holding plate.<br>
3.	The occlusal rim is placed on the mandibular cast.<br>
4.	Articulator is closed by turning the hinged upper member towards the lower member.<br>
5.	A thread tied on one of the occlusion plane guidance member is taken around to the other reference member passing over the incisor guide pin.<br>
19<br><br>
6.	The leveling screws provided on the lower member are adjusted to bring the occlusal rim of the mandibular cast to match with the plane indicated by the thread relation.<br>
7.	Maxillary cast is placed on the cast assembly plate mounted on the hinged maxillary support frame and adjusted as per jaw relation ship record of the patient.<br>
8.	Using clamping screws the maxillary cast is fixed to the cast holding plate.<br>
9.	The leveling screws provided on the upper member are adjusted to ensure that<br><br>
(a)	contact is made between tip of the incisor guide rod and the incisor guide table and<br>
(b)	the occlusal plane is coinciding with the plane indicted by the thread relation.<br>
10.	The lock nuts provided on the clamping screws of the articulator are<br>
tightened to ensure that the casts are firmly clamped on the articulator.<br>
11 .Now the mounting is complete and the mounted casts are ready for teeth setting.<br>
20<br><br>
Although the invention has been described with a particular type of articulator of the arcon or the non-arcon type, it will be easily <br>
understandable to any one skilled in the art that the features of this invention and particularly the cast holding plates can be fitted or retrofitted in to any other known or yet to be designed articulator by suitably adapting the plates and its related fixtures to suit the articulator cage.<br>
While considerable emphasis has been placed herein on the particular features of "Plaster free dental articulator" and the improvisation with regards to it, it will be appreciated that various modifications can be made, and that many changes can be made in the preferred embodiment without departing from the principles of the invention. These and other modifications in the nature of the invention or the preferred embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the disclosure herein, whereby it is to be distinctly understood that the foregoing descriptive matter is to be interpreted merely as illustrative of the invention and not as a limitation.<br>
