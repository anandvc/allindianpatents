TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention belongs to the field of pharmaceutical segment, particularly consisting of a phitotherapeutic pharmaceutical formula (form) for the treatment of ulcers, either those ones that obstruct or decrease blood irrigation, and more particularly pressure ulcers and varicose ulcers (both venous or arterial), besides the preparation process and its application, being said phytotherapeutic pharmaceutical forms featured for the reason of having gross extract and portions of plants of the gender Stryphnodendron.<br>
FUNDAMENTALS OF THE TECHNIC<br>
As it is of general knowledge, from thousands of years wounds have been treated aiming at enhancing the natural scar healing processo It is known that some wounds will become scar healed by themselves whilst others will resist from any efforts to do so becoming some of these wounds cases that will lead persons to diabetes, cancer, varicose ulcers and pressure ulcers originated from a long period of time lying in bed, best know as crusts.<br>
In accordance with Modolin and Bevilacqua (1985) the scar healing is a physiological process that begins through an inflammatory response featured by an increase on the blood flow, capilar permeability and migration of leococitos to the harmed region. The capilar permeability provides the extravasation of plasma and its components thus forming the inflammatory waste material.<br>
At the start a wound is filled by clots, insoluble whitish proteins and waste material that form up a crust that isolates the wound from the external side almost at once (COTRAN, 1989). The NEUTROFILOS and MACROFAGOS are the first cells to migrate into the wounded region in a response from the organism against the bacterial invasion (RUNNELS et. ai., 1976) and when the cells destroy themselves and waste away the bacteria degenerate themselves forming up the pus with the dead remaining tissue (GUYTON, 1991).<br>
When the granulation tissue contracts itself it retracts the edges of the wound in the skin towards the central part of the wound thus allowing the area to be reformed and become smaller. When granulation is excessive a delay occurs to the scar healing. Prevention can be obtained by encouraging a subcrustal scar healing when the formation of a crust wound encourages the scar healing processo The crust appearance can occur by the use of several substances as the tannins. When the wound waste material lingers in the desaggregation on the crust occurs,<br>
thus allowing the development of germs between the wound and the granulation tissue (OLIVEIRA 1992).<br>
As it is of general knowledge, pressure ulcers or crusts are excavated lesions that might reach variable depths (named "grades") reaching the skin and as well even the muscles and banes, being said crusts caused by a closure in the blood circulation as a consequence of prolonged pressure on the banes of the musculatura and on the neighboring region. The obstruction blocking on the blood circulation results from lack of normal movements of the patient in addition to the deficit of sensitivity that are the basic reasons of this condition that shows necrosis areas that further develops into the appearance of wounds.<br>
The crusts take place in several parts of the body and in most cases on the salient banes that forces up the soft tissues of the patient against hard surfaces that encourages the lesion to appear. For instance, a patient who is lying in bed for a long time exercises pressure on his/her heel through the weight of his/her leg thus forcing a small area of the skin and this pressure is sufficient to block the blood vessels between the bane of the heel and the skin of the surface so forming up a crust ulcer on the heel. In his/her turn, the patient who stays for a long, time lying on his/her back not ever moving himself/herself will exercise pressure on the sacro bane thus allowing the crust to originate from there, being this one the place where the crusts are most usually found in. Other regions as the clavicules, elbows, ribs and occipital banes are algo very subject to the appearance of crusts.<br>
Therefore, the appearance of crusts begins with the prolonged pressure on determined part of the body up to the time when the wound is originated by a lesion of sorrounding skin.<br>
In their turn, the varicose ulcers (venous or arteriais ones) are a consequence from a backlog of venous blood in the skin that determines their thickness, the reduction of subcutaneous fat lard and brown stains. In the arterial hypertension, diabetes and arterial trombose the obstrution of the skin arteries or of the profound tissues occurs, thus originating the wound. As for the infectious ulcers they are painful and show inflammatory characterists and have pus secretion.<br>
The ulcers (pressure or varicose ones) may be described in accordance with the characterist stages of tissue loss usually classified into grades in accordance with the standards of the Quick Reference Guide for Clinicians, being these grades:<br>
Grade I -skins shows hypermia (redness)<br>
Grade II -the wound penetrates the skin (epidermis and/or "dermis) causing algo<br>
damage or necrosis in the subcutaneous tissue. The lesion clinically appears as a<br>
superficial surface ulcer with or without damage to the adjacent tissue.<br>
Grade III -loss of skin and tissues that extends to the subcutaneous tissues; and<br>
Grade IV -the lesion reaches the muscle articular and bane tissues.<br>
The damaged tissue with waste material is a fibreoptic tissue mostly composed of non-organized colagen fibres. This type of tissue is of little vascularity, of little nervure and unstretchable. Owing to the absence of nervure and loss of elasticity it is in a fast way susceptible to a series of injuries. The injuried tissue is hard to scar healing due to the poor local vascularity.<br>
Numerous types of treatment are used for pressure ulcers that involve preventing measures and several types of therapies that might be of type: a) local treatment or care using special beds, water mattress, etc; b) patient treatment that includes asepsis, nutrition improvement, care and fight against local infecctions, etc; and c) use of physical therapies over the affected area with electric stimulation, ultrasound, lasertherapy and others.<br>
In a general manner the scar healing process that naturally takes piare in response to the injury includes the inflammatory response, angiogenese, synthesis and deposition of colagen and formation. Although tissue repair and regeneration occur without an intervention, scar healing as a second intention might occur due to the acceleration of the colagen synthesis. Thus, the scar healing of wounds involves a series of complex biochemical and cellular events which finally promote a retraction, closing and scar healing of the lesion.<br>
The term "revitalization" is used as a means to restare the vascularity and elasticity of the tissue that had been injured and crusted. The term "injury" is used as a method of provoking the wound caused by surgery, traumas, ulcers, burns, chemical agents and virus or bacteria infections. The term "crusted" tissue is a type of fibreoptical tissue or colagen formed during the scar healing of the wound or other pathological processes. The crusted scarred tissue is a fibreoptical tissue produced by hundreds of non-organized colagen fibres and is formed by injuries or inflammation in tissue site.<br>
The contamination of a wound may be a result from the direct contact with the infected object or by an incoming dirty, dust or exogeneous microorganisms from the patient's skin or from the gastric-intestinal causes. For instance, it has been reckognized that despite of adopted effective measures to avoid infections, practically ali burns start up a colony of bacteria within a period of 12-24 hours.<br>
In a general manner, infection bars the scar healing of the wound due to the provokation of tissue damage and as well due to the inflammation. Subsequently, the recovery of the wound is damaged by a progressive inflammation, by formation of waste materiais, by release and activation of enzymes, by generation of free radicais, consumption of oxigen and the loss of nervure. Therefore, cares to prevent inflammation might lead to the scar healing of the wound not risking the ability of the tissue to resist the infection and to inhibit the essencial function of the macrofagos.<br>
The prior art teaches that the medical protocols utilized for scar healing of wounds are very much varied, having such proceedings their benefits and limitations as<br>
well. The actives available for topic therapeutics include Ihe use of: antibiotics; bismuth salts; carbohydrates; hormones; plasma; zinc and tannic acid; treatments with electric stimulation; hyperbaric oxigenation; ultrasonic therapy and laser.<br>
Still taking into consideration Ihe traditional protocols Ihe wounds treatment has been intensified in relation to Ihe use of natural products to aid scar healing, such as copaiba oil (Coorea 1984;<br>
Eurides &amp; Mazzanti, 1995); papaina (Sanchez Neto et ai., 1993); sugar (Prata et ai., 1988); colagen (Abramo, 1990) and vitamin A (Bondi, 1989).<br>
The Barbatiman (barbatimao) (stryphnodendron po/yphy//um and S. adstringens; Martius) , particularly Ihe phytotherapic ones dealt with in this development of inovated pharmaceutical formulation, comprise a leguminous mimosoidea arboreal from Ihe brazilian flora that is found from Ihe State of Para up to Ihe State of Sao Paulo. The barks are thick and have binding effect related to Ihe presence of active principles like taninns.<br>
It may be used indistinctively extracts from Ihe barks of these species in Ihe preparation of scar healing phytotherapeutics owing Ihe similarity of chemical composition.<br>
It was mentioned by the Brazilian Pharmacology (1959) that Ihe barks from Ihe plant have tannins that hold important pharmacological activities on mice like anti-inflammatory actions (LIMA, 1998) and scar healing in dermis wound (PANIZZA, 1998 and EURIDES, 1996), in gastric ulcer (FAVARETTO et ai., 1985) and duodenal (RIZZINI &amp; MORS, 1976). Taninns also assist in Ihe treatment of eczema with Ihe advantage of not generating collateral effects usually observed in Ihe therapies by using high dosages of glycocorticoids (MROWIETS et ai., 1991).<br>
In accordance with Mello (1998) Ihe main features of Ihe extracts made from Ihe barks of Barbatiman is found in Ihe richness of taninns. In 1996 Mello et ai (apud MELLO, 1998) isolated and indentified 22 compounds on gross extract of barks from Barbatiman, being ali of them taninns of condensed type, being this an active principle involved in several biological activities and Ihe one that makes of 25-30% of Ihe plant bark (PANIZZA et ai., 1998). Proantocianidinas, prorobinetinidinas, flavan-3-01 and prodelfinidinas were the chemical portions studied. According to Lima et ai. (1998) Ihe anti-inflammatory activity of Barbatiman is attributed to Ihe presence of proantocianidinas.<br>
Other studies have investigated Ihe composition of taninns in three species of Barbatiman, that is, Ihe S. po/yphy//um, Ihe S. adstringens and Ihe Dimorphandra mo/fis (SANTOS, 2002) wherein Ihe same were already evaluated chemically. It is to be emphasized that Ihe D. Mo/fis is known as Barbatiman, nevertheless it differs chemically from Ihe two aforesaid specimens as it is shown below on Table<br>
Cromatographic Analysis of Barbatiman Extract after Hidrolise <br>
(Table Remove)<br>
In accordance with Haslam (1996) taninns combine themselves with the proteins through chemically well defined links chains which provide the binding feature. This complex tannin/protein and/or polysacharideo forms a protecting coating on the skin or on the mucosa damaged. Under this coating the natural process of recovering the wounds, the burns and the inflammations might occur.<br>
Tannins also hold inhibitting effects on bacteria and fungi (antimicrobial activity), being it based on the assumptions that the tannins Inhibit the enzymes of the bacteria and fungi acting with the substrates of these enzymes. Furthermore, tannins act on the cellular membranes of microorganisms changing their metabolism and complexion of taninns with metallic ions decreasing the availability of essential ions for the metabolism of the microorganisms (SIMOES, 2000).<br>
Neto et ai. (1996) compare the scar heating action of Calendula officinalis L and Stryphnodendron barbatiman (Vellozo) Martius (Barbatiman) in the treatment of varicose ulcers and skin lesions in humans. The results show that treatments whatever with calendula and as well with barbatiman are efficient in the recovery of burns lesions and in varicose ulcers once the association allowed a faster scar healing.<br>
Earlier studies disclose that one of physiotheraphics alternatives for accelerating the tissue process is the use of laser. The laser is a special form of electromagnetic energy that operates in the region of visible electromagnetic spectre or infrared that classifies many different types of laser, whichever whatever high or low power lasers.<br>
In accordance with Baxter et ai. (1994) the success with the use of laser is due to the responses induced in the tissues such as the reduction of edema, decrease in the inflammatory process, increase in the fagocitose process, colegen synthesis of colagen and of re-formation, being the most of registered biological effects related to the proliferation of cells involved in the scar healing, mainly those of fibreblasts (f and macrofagos (O'KANE et ai., 1994).<br>
In vitro studies are reported more frequently in the reduction of scar healing time of wounds in the cutaneous and mucosa extracts particularly on the proliferation and activation of the protein synthesis of fibreblasts, the principal cell responsable for the tissue restoration (ABERGEL, 1984; BOULTON, 1986; HALLMAN, 1988; LOEVSCALL &amp; ARENHOLT-BINDSLEV.1994).<br>
Laser is a non-invasive instrument important in the recovery of ulcers (SCHINDL et ai., 1999) and of numerous etiologies, including venous and diabete ulcers (ALGAN et ai, 2001) being the scar healing time dependent on size and cause of ulcero<br>
In 1991 Arantes disclosed that the application of low intensity laser in dermis lesions of lower limbs induced to cures without comeback. In 70% of patients and that 30% had improved diagnostic when compared to normal clinical proceedings through which a cure .of 38% was disclosed, an improvement of 48% was disclosed and a 14% of absence of any recovery was disclosed.<br>
Besides the treatment with topic products for scar healing, the physiotherapeutic appatuses as the ultrasound (US) and low intensity laser serve as alternatives to the treatment in tissue recovery.<br>
The ultrasound comprises another method widely used to accelarate tissue recovery process, being its functioning due to thermal and non-thermal effects (mechanical) generated by the ultrasonic waves on the damaged tissues (STARCKEY, 2001; DYSON, 1992). The therapeutic effects carried out by the low intensity US are usually due to the non-thermal effects produced by stable waves, accoustic currents, micro currents and cav'rtaties (DYSON, 1987).<br>
The skin, in addition to functions as a barrier, is also a target for the via of drug administration with the advantage of decreasing possible adverse effects caused by oral means of administration or other ones which are considered invasive (MA TCHED, 2002). Nowadays there is an increasing interest about this technic for it allows the transdermal transport of drugs with low molecular weight or even of proteins with a high molecular weight as the insulin which could be avoided being administered in the form of injections thus preventing the accurance of ache and possible permanent damages to the skin.<br>
Recent studies have been carried out with the purpose of altering the cutaneous permeability, including the use of chemical"facilities" (MORGANTI et alo, 2001) and the physical "facilities" like iontoforese, an electrotherapeutical technic that utilizes the galvanic current to facilitate the intercutaneous penetration of therapeuthic substances (BARRY, 2001) and, of a widespread use, the fonoforese or sonoforese (MATCHED &amp; BOUCAUD, 2002).<br>
This technic is comprised of the association of ultrasound with several drugs used as a means of coupling in the form of gel or ointments changing its difusion acrossrthe corneous extract. The US increases the coefficient of difusion of the corneous extract to hidrofobics molecules of low and high molecular weight (MITRAGOTRI, 2001; JOSHI &amp; RAJE, 2002), being able such corneous extract of being applied together with chemical facilities (TEZEL et ai., 2002) enhancing (potencializando) the absorption of several medicines. In this aspect Skanem &amp; Fentner (1984) disclosed that the ultrasound was employed in different previous works for offering localized conditions in the skin which favoured the difusion of drugs.<br>
Thus, Ihe ultrasonic heating, observed in an insignificant magnitude is responsible for a modest alteration in Ihe intensity, frequence and ways of drugs transportation. The grade of generated heat is considerably influenced by subtle factors like Ihe movement of Ihe transdutor, Ihe anatomical site of application, Ihe quantity and type of vehicle or means of coupling pressures and radiations, Ihe forces generated by Ihe micro currents and Ihe cavitaties.<br>
Even before Ihe studies carried out and described in literature up to then, it is noticed that Ihe difused and popular use of Barbatiman, with or without association of Calendula plant, is still of empirical procedure, that is, for its application in site an infusion of Barbatiman's bark is made, then proceeding on Ihe direct application on Ihe wound, this resulting in a methodology without any kind of penetration control, local moisture, teor of contamination of added agents, etc, being totally lack of any pharmaceutical forms that enable to measure dosages, control and clinical methodologies.<br>
It is concluded this way that this type of procedure could • not under no circunstance be repeated in those patients who hold rebel wounds like Ihe type of ali ulcers, varicose or pressure ones, once that care about Ihe local asepsis, Ihe prevention against inflammations and infections are Ihe most important topics (pontos) during Ihe scar healing treatment of wounds for it is necessary Ihe said wounds produce Ihe tissue recovery and regeneration with intervention, that is, Ihe scar healing is meant as second intention, occuring due to Ihe acceleration of Ihe colagen colagen synthesis.<br>
Aiming at creating means of allowing the use of Stryphnodendron barks's properties (Barbatiman) in a pharmacological way in humans and as well with veterinary application, Ihe patent applicant developed the present invention that relates to phytotherapeutical pharmaceutical form for scar healing, its process of preparation, aplication, active and derived composition, besides demonstrating the treatment with the formulated product wherein extracts and portions of a medicinal plant native from Brazil were validated, particularly the Stryphnodendron po/yphythum or Barbatiman with a high content of tannin constituents and total phenols developing in porti'ons of dye and powder with ideal physical and fhysical- chemical features to receive ingredients and vehicles able of being dosed clinically and as well as pharmaceutically.<br>
The great advantage of using formulations that contain extracts of Stryphnodendron is related to the scar healing power which is enhanced by the antimicrobial action which keep lesioned sites with a minimized levei of microorganism thus favouring the scar healing.<br>
The described process was carried out from dyes that were extracted from the Stryphnodendron's barks, concentrated on rotovaporator and dried by forced circulation of ar being such barks subject to quantitative analysis for determination of contituents' contents predominantly tannin and total phenols (AOAC, F. Bras. IV supplement 35, pages 30-2). The average amount of total phenols vary between 40-50%. Foilowing, the preparation of Pharmaceuticals forms were carried out with a quality contrai obeying specifications described in the 4th Edition of Brazilian Pharmacopy.<br>
The. pharmaceutical form was made of different concentrations of actives and through pre-clinical studies, the highest efficiency concentration was verified in the process of scar healing. 150 lesions were evaluated from which 60% had scarred completely..<br>
Literature has disclosed that the scar healing process is effected by the presence of microorganisms, most of them multiresistant.<br>
/n vitro microbiological assays using standard especimens and field species isolated from infected crusts.made evidence that the Sryphnodendron's extracts hold GIM 62,5 /I g/mL for positive grams and 250 /I g/mL for negative. The tested pharmaceutical forms contain concentrations of active substances 400 and 100 times to GIM of positive and negative gram respectively.<br>
Clinically it was observed that the infected crusts also responded to the treatment with the active and scar healed without the need of complementary use of antibiotics.<br>
During the accompanyment of clinical study of Barbatiman's physiotherapeutical pharmaceutical form use in accordance with the developed formulation and now protected, the patients- ynder treatment were subject to macroscopic and<br>
microscopical examinations of organs (stomach, kidneys, liver and spleen) besides laboratory examinations like hemograms; biochemical assays of renal and hepatic function before, during and after treatment and the results proved that the phytotherapeutical did not effect the biochemical and hematological parameters analised (see graphics) related to figures itemized in continuation.<br>
The results of therapeutical efficiency that were obtained acknowledge the patent application of the phytotherapeutical pharmaceutical form by this way applied for, that is, the form, of the phytoderived medicine constituted of 3% of Stryphnodendron's active , in the way that it will be defined further on (mais adiante), being said medicine used in the Clinical Study of Scar Healing Action's Evalu~tion of 150 crusts with different grades of tissue damage, disclosing the result as follows:<br>
-Treated lesions were predominantly of Grade I ( 61.2%) and Grade II (20.1 %),<br>
being the medicine efficient in the complete scar healing of 58.8% for the<br>
lesion of Grade I and 35.6% for the lesions of Grade 11. -The evolution in the scar healing process showed that the tested phytotherapic<br>
provided the scar healing of over 70% of treated lesions within a maximum<br>
period Df 2 months. -The time for scar healing varied in accordance to the grade and site of lesion,<br>
once the' crust of Grade I located in the hips and sacro got scar healed in a<br>
period less than 1 month. -Product was found effective in lesions of ali grades<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention refers to Phytotherapeutic Pharmaceutical Form with Scar Healing and Microbial 'Properties and Other Activities of Medical and Veterinary Interest for the Treatment of Ulcers (that either obstruct or decrease the blood irrigation) and Infections; Its Process of Preparation and its Applications and more particularly the present invention discloses a phytotherapeutical formulation applied in the treatment, accelaration of scar healing of lesions and revitalization of the damaged tissue in humans and animais through the topic administration of bioactives derived from plants known as Barbatiman of the gender Stryphnodendron and especimens po/yphy//um and adstringens, such a formulation that starts up and stimulate the normal synthesis of colagen with an effective action of tissue recovery and regeneration and antimicrobial action on multiresistent field species colonizers of obstructing lesions (pressure and/or varicose), or still lesions provoked by surgery, ulcerations due to burns and infections located in the lesions.<br>
The phytotherapeutical intermediary preparations of Barbatiman were carried out following determined steps and described next obtaining the following physical-chemical characteristics:<br>
Preparation of Stryphnodendron's dyes:<br>
Dyes are prepared with the ground barks of the plant, soaked for 15 days in a mixture of cereais alcohol in water (2: 1) with determined volume. After soaking, mixtures are filtered and the obtained volume is completed for the sufficient quantity.<br>
Preparation of concentrated Stryphnodendron's dyes:<br>
Dyes are concentrated in a rotoelevador under vacuum at a maximum temperature of 600 Celsius, being designed by the solutions' concentrations to levels of 50%, 25% and 10%, respectively as soluctions A, B and C. The final aspect of dyes comprises a liquid of dark brown red and strawberry red colour when dilluted, has<br><br>
no peculiar odour and its taste is of binding sensation. Ph is 100%:4,0 -4,5 and the contents of total phenols is of 1.70 -1.75 g/'1 OOmL.<br>
Dry extract of Stryphnodendron:<br>
The dry extracts of Stryphnodendron are obtained from the drought of dyes previously separated placed in open recipients which provide a better evaporation of solvent, left for 5 days in a proofer with air forced circulation at a temperature of 50°. Final aspect comprises 'a dark brown red colour powder and as well of strawberry red colour when dissolved in a acquous vehicle, has no peculiar odour and its taste is binding sensation. Total phenols content: 60.0 -65.0 g/100g.<br>
The formulation developed for the preparation of the phytotherapeutic product contains the dry extract from the Stryphnodendron's bark dye and the assitant substances Nipagin (conservative), glicerin (viscosity agent) monosodium phosphate (pH correction), the following formulation being defined:<br>
Stryphnodendron's dry extract	 from 2% to 5% of total<br>
phenols and 1.8% to 40% of tannins;<br>
Glicerin	1 0%;<br>
Nipagin	 0.2%<br>
Phosphate Tissue	q.s. pH 5.5 -6.0; and<br>
Purified Water	100.0 ml<br>
In an ideal concentration the formulation determines that the Stryphnodendron's<br>
quantity of dry extract should be of 4.4 to 5.0 g/100ml to generate a concentration of<br>
60.0 to 65.0 g/100g of total phenols, that is, 3% of total phenols in the formulated<br>
products.<br>
The studied chemical portions were the proantocianidinas  ,  prorobinetinidinas,<br>
flavan-3-ol e prodelfinidina,'being the anti-inflammatory activity of Stryphnodendron<br>
attributed to the presence of proantocianidinas.<br>
