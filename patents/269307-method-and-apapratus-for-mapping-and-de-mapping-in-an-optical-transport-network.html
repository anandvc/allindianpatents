				<td>FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
The present invention relates to the field of communication technologies, and<br>
particularly, to a mapping technique in an optical transport network.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
With the quick development of communication technology, the Optical Transport<br>
Network (OTN) with advantages of flexible scheduling and management of large capacity<br>
services is increasingly becoming a major technology of the backbone transport network.<br>
In the OTN, the client data is encapsulated into an Optical Channel Payload Unit (OPU),<br>
some overhead (OH) is added to the OPU to constitute an Optical Channel Data Unit<br>
(ODU), some OH and Forward Error Correction (FEC) is added into the ODU to constitute<br>
an Optical Channel Transport Unit (OTU), and is finally transmitted in the form of OTU.<br>
With the rapid development of data service, more and more clients adopt Ethernet<br>
technology as the physical interface at the client side. It is foreseeable that in the coming<br>
years, the Ethernet service will keep a continuous high-speed growth. However, the current<br>
OTN technology is designed based on speech service such as synchronous digital hierarchy<br>
(SDH), and cannot well support the development trend of data service like Ethernet, thus<br>
studies are gradually carried out on the next generation of OTN network (NG OTN). The<br>
NG OTN is required to not only meet the requirements of services newly appear, but also<br>
bear the current OTN. Thus how to map a Lower Order Optical Channel Data Unit (LO<br>
ODU) to a Higher Order Optical Channel Data Unit (HO ODU) is a focus being discussed<br>
in the industry. The LO ODU may be ODUk (k=0, 1, 2, 2e, 3, 3e) existing in the current<br>
OTN, and herein represented as LO ODUk (k=0, 1, 2, 2e, 3, 3e); the HO ODU may be<br>
regarded as a data transmission unit of higher rate, which belongs to the category of the<br>
NG OTN and is used for bearing the LO ODU, the corresponding OPU is represented as<br>
HOOPUk(k=l,2, 3, 3e, 4).<br>
The conventional technical solution maps the standard ODUj (j=l, 2) (for 20ppm<br><br>
bit tolerance) into the OPUk (k=2, 3) in an asynchronous manner. The asynchronous<br>
method maps the ODUj signal into the OPUk through an adjustment policy of -1/0/+1/+2.<br>
With the asynchronous manner, a maximum bit error tolerance between ODU1 and OPU2<br>
is -113 to +83ppm. a maximum bit error tolerance between ODUland OPU3 is -96 to<br>
HOIppm, and a maximum bit error tolerance between ODU2 and OPU3 is -95 to<br>
+ 101ppm.<br>
During the process of implementing the present invention, the inventor finds that<br>
the prior art has at least the following problems:<br>
The method is not suitable for mapping the LO ODU into the HO ODU, e.g. for<br>
ODU2e (lOOppm bit tolerance), etc. ODUflex of higher bit tolerance may occur in the<br>
future, and the adjustment policy of-1/0/+1/+2 of the prior art cannot meet the requirement<br>
for mapping the LO ODU into the HO ODU.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
The technical solutions of the embodiments of the present invention are clearly<br>
described as follows in conjunction with the drawings of the embodiments. It is apparent<br>
that the described embodiments are just a part of embodiments of the present invention,<br>
instead of all embodiments thereof. Based on the embodiments of the present invention,<br>
other embodiments, which are obtained by a person skilled in the art without paying a<br><br>
creative effort, all fall within the protection scope of the present invention.<br>
At the data transmitting side, as shown in Fig. 1, a mapping method in an OTN<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention includes:<br>
constructing an ODTU according to an amount M of time slots of an HO OPU to be<br>
occupied by an LO ODU;<br>
mapping the LO ODU to a payload area of the ODTU in an M-byte granularity;<br>
encapsulating overhead information to the payload area of the ODTU; and<br>
multiplexing the ODTU, which has been mapped the LO ODU and encapsulated<br>
with the overhead information, to the HO OPU, so as to provide an efficient and universal<br>
mode for mapping the LO ODU to the HO OPU.<br>
For the convenience of understanding the embodiments of the present invention,<br>
the implementation processes of those embodiments during specific applications are<br>
described in detail as follows.<br>
The mapping method in an OTN according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention includes:<br>
SI: constructing an ODTU according to an amount M of time slots of an HO OPU<br>
to be occupied by an LO ODU;<br>
The step includes:<br>
SI 1: determining the amount M of the time slots of the HO OPU to be occupied by<br>
the LO ODU;<br>
Specifically, the amount M of the time slots of the HO OPU to be occupied by the<br>
LO ODU may be determined according to the rate of the LO ODU and the rate of a single<br>
time slot of the HO OPU, i.e. M= upper rounding of (the rate of the LO ODU / the rate of a<br>
single time slot of the HO OPU). For example, HO OPU2 is divided into eight 1.25G time<br>
slots, and eight frames of HO OPU2 forms a large multi-frame, as shown in Fig. 2. If the .<br>
rate of a certain LO ODU is assumed as 6G, then five time slots shall be occupied, and M<br>
is 5. We can allocate five time slots to the current LO ODU according to the usage<br>
conditions of the time slots in the HO OPU, herein the five time slots allocated to the<br>
current LO ODU are assumed as time slots 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8.<br><br>
Of course, other methods may also be adopted to determine M and allocate the time<br>
slots to be occupied. Meanwhile, they are not limited by the embodiments of the present<br>
invention, and fall within the protection scope of the embodiments of the present invention.<br>
S12: constructing the ODTU;<br>
The ODTU includes M time slots, and further includes Justification Control<br>
Overhead (JC OH) corresponding to JC OH position of the HO OPU. As shown in Fig. 2,<br>
the ODTU includes the time slots 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8 in the multi-frame formed of eight HO<br>
OPUs. and further includes JC OH position of HO OPU frames to which the respective<br>
time slots correspond. The shaded portions in Fig. 2 form corresponding ODTU.<br>
S2: mapping the LO ODU to a payload area of the ODTU in an M-byte granularity;<br>
The step includes:<br>
S21: determining an amount of LO ODU(s) of M-bytes to be mapped when<br>
mapping in the M-byte granularity, according to an amount X of the LO ODU(s) to be<br>
transmitted during each multi-frame period, and herein is represented as C8M; in another<br>
embodiment of the present invention, determining clock information according to the<br>
amount X of the LO ODU(s) to be transmitted during each multi-frame period, and herein<br>
isrepresented as C8-delta. The above two information is represented as "C8M + C8-delta".<br>
In which, the method for acquiring X is existing, and hence is not described in the<br>
embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Specifically, the embodiment of the present invention may use the following<br>
method to determine "C8M + C8-delta":<br>
C8M,MAX = (LO ODU rate * LO ODU maximum frequency deviation) / (M * TS<br>
rate * TS minimum frequency deviation) * 15232<br>
C8M,M1N = (LO ODU rate * LO ODU minimum frequency deviation) / (M * TS<br>
rate * TS maximum frequency deviation) * 15232<br>
Where C8M is an integer value with a range of [C8M, MIN lower rounding, C8M,<br>
MAX upper rounding]. C8-delta is X - M*C8M, indicating the clock information, where X<br>
is C8, and C8 is an integer value with a range of [C8, MIN lower rounding, C8, MAX<br>
upper rounding].<br><br>
C8,MAX = (LO ODU rate * LO ODU maximum frequency deviation) / (TS rate *<br>
TS minimum frequency deviation) * 15232<br>
C8,MIN = (LO ODU rate * LO ODU minimum frequency deviation) / (TS rate<br>
*TS maximum frequency deviation) * 15232<br>
Assuming a certain LO ODU has its X=76111 and occupies M=5 time slots, then<br>
C8M= (X/M) lower rounding =15222, C8-delta=X-M*C8M=l. Or C8M= (X/M) lower<br>
rounding +1 = 15223, C8-delta=X-M*C8M=-4. The mapped data information and clock<br>
information can be completely reflected by transmitting the information "C8M + C8-delta",<br>
i.e. (15222, 1) or (15223, -4). The receiving side may perceive, according to (15222, 1) or<br>
(15223. -4), that the transmitting side needs to transmit client data of 76111 bytes during<br>
one multi-frame period, so as to accurately recover the client clock at the receiving side.<br>
The present invention may also use other methods to determine "C8M + C8-delta".<br>
Meanwhile, they are not limited by the embodiments of the present invention, and all fall<br>
within the protection scope of those embodiments.<br>
S22: mapping the amount of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte to the payload area of the<br>
ODTU in the M-byte granularity.<br>
Mapping in the M-byte granularity means performing one time of mapping<br>
operation of M bytes of client data as a whole; as the above example, mapping the amount<br>
of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte to the payload area of the ODTU in the M-byte granularity<br>
means mapping 15222 or 15223 LO ODUs of 5-byte to the payload area of the ODTU,<br>
performing the mapping operation every 5 bytes of LO ODU, and totally mapping for<br>
15,222 or 15,223 times.<br>
Specifically, the sigma-delta algorithm or other Generic Mapping Procedure (GMP)<br>
mapping methods may be used to map the LO ODU(s) to the payload area of the ODTU, the<br>
other GMP mapping methods meet the following characteristics:<br>
1. being capable of automatically determining a filling amount according to the<br>
mapped signals and the rate of a target container;<br>
2. being capable of automatically determining distribution positions of the filling and<br>
mapping signals in the target container according to the mapped signals and the rate<br><br>
of the target container; and<br>
3. transporting position information carrying the filling and mapping signals in the<br>
overhead of the target container.<br>
The characteristic information of the GMP mapping method in the embodiments of<br>
the present invention is further described with the following two mapping modes, but is not<br>
limited by the two mapping modes.<br>
Mapping mode 1: evenly distributing filling data and mapping signal data to the<br>
payload area through the sigma-delta algorithm. Information such as positions of the filling<br>
and mapping signals is carried and transported by the overhead of the target container; the<br>
effect after the mapping is shown in Fig. 3, where S is filling data and D is mapping signal<br>
data; the filling data and the mapping signal data are evenly distributed to the payload area.<br>
Mapping mode 2: concentratedly placing the filling data in a fixed position of the<br>
payload area, and determining which portions in the payload area are for the filling data<br>
and which portions in the payload area are for the mapping signal data according to the<br>
filling amount. Information such as positions of the filling and mapping signals is carried<br>
and transported by the overhead of the target container; the effect after the mapping is<br>
shown in Fig. 4, where S is the filling data and D is the mapping signal data.<br>
S3: encapsulating overhead information to the payload area of the ODTU;<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the overhead information includes the<br>
amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte, and encapsulating the overhead<br>
information to the payload area of the ODTU includes:<br>
encapsulating the amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte to the overhead<br>
area of the ODTU;<br>
Specifically, encapsulating the amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte to<br>
the overhead area of the ODTU includes:<br>
directly encapsulating the amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte to the<br>
overhead area of the ODTU, and a form of "C8M" may be used; or<br>
dividing the amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte into a fixed portion<br>
of the amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte and a variable portion of the<br><br>
amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte, and encapsulating the fixed portion of<br>
the amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte and the variable portion of the<br>
amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte to the overhead area of the ODTU;<br>
transporting in a form of this overhead information may also achieve the same effect.<br>
Specifically, a form of "C8M-base + C8M-delta" may be adopted, where C8M-base +<br>
C8M-delta equivalent to C8M, indicating an amount of M-bytes in the LO ODU(s)<br>
mapped to the pay load area of the ODTU; C8M-base is an amount of M-bytes in the fixed<br>
portion, and C8M-delta is an amount of M-bytes in the variable portion; or<br>
determining amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte to be filled according<br>
to the amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte, and encapsulating the amount<br>
information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte to be filled to the overhead area of the ODTU;<br>
Transmitting in a form of this overhead information may also achieve the same effect;<br>
specifically, a form of "S8M" may be adopted, where S represents the filling data, S8M<br>
indicates an amount of filled bytes in the ODTU after the LO ODU(s) are mapped to the<br>
ODTU, and S8M = 15232 - C8M.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the overhead information includes the<br>
amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte and the clock information,<br>
encapsulating the overhead information to the payload area of the ODTU includes:<br>
encapsulating the amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte and the clock .<br>
information to the overhead area of the ODTU.<br>
Specifically, encapsulating the amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte<br>
and the clock information to the overhead area of the ODTU includes:<br>
directly encapsulating the amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte and the<br>
clock information to the overhead area of the ODTU, and a form of "C8M + C8-delta"<br>
may be used; or<br>
dividing the amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte into a fixed portion<br>
of the amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte and a variable portion of the<br>
amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte, and encapsulating the fixed portion of<br>
the amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte and the variable portion of the<br><br>
amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte to the overhead area of the ODTU;<br>
transporting in a form of this overhead information may also achieve the same effect;<br>
specifically, a form of "C8M-base + C8M-delta + C8-delta" may be used, where C8M-base<br>
+ C8M-delta equivalents to C8M, indicating an amount of M-bytes in the LO ODU(s)<br>
mapped to the payload area of the ODTU; C8M-base is an amount of M-bytes in the fixed<br>
portion, and C8M-delta is an amount of M-bytes in the variable portion; or<br>
determining amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte to be filled<br>
according to the amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte, and encapsulating the<br>
amount information of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte to be filled to the overhead area of the<br>
ODTU; transporting in a form of this overhead information may also achieve the same<br>
effect: specifically, a form of'S8M + S8-delta" may be adopted, where S represents the<br>
filling data, S8M indicates an amount of filled bytes in the ODTU after the LO ODU(s) are<br>
mapped to the ODTU, S8M = 15232 - C8M, and S8-delta indicates the clock information.<br>
Encapsulating the overhead information to the overhead area of the ODTU<br>
includes:<br>
encapsulating the overhead information to an overhead corresponding to a first time<br>
slot or a last time slot in the ODTU.<br>
The overhead information indicates clock information and an amount of the LO<br>
ODU(s) of M-byte mapped to the ODTU in next n multi-frames, or indicates clock<br>
information and an amount of the LO ODU(s) of M-byte mapped to the ODTU in next n<br>
frames, where n is a natural number.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the "C8M + C8-delta" information<br>
indicates conditions of the clock information and an amount of M-bytes in the LO ODU(s)<br>
mapped to the ODTU in the next multi-frame.<br>
If the "C8M + C8-delta" information is encapsulated to the JC OH corresponding to<br>
the first time slot in the ODTU, i.e. the JC OH position of the 2nd frame of HO OPU<br>
corresponding to the time slot 2 in the current multi-frame, then the mapping process is<br>
shown in Fig. 5. If the "C8M + C8-delta" information is encapsulated to the JC OH<br>
corresponding to the last time slot in the ODTU, i.e. the JC OH position of the 8th frame of<br><br>
110 OPU corresponding to the time slot 8 in the current multi-frame, then the mapping<br>
process is shown in Fig. 6.<br>
In another one embodiment of the invention, the "C8M-base + C8M-delta +<br>
C8-delta" information indicates conditions of the clock information and an amount of<br>
