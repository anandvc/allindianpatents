				<td>The present invention relates to a N-[2-(2-pyridinyl)cycloalkyl]carboxamide derivative.<br>
The present invention relates to novel N-[2-(2-pyridinyl)cycloalkyl]carboxamide derivatives, their process of preparation, their use as fungicides, particularly in the form of fungicidal compositions, and methods for the control of phytopathogenic fungi of plants using these compounds or their compositions.<br>
International patent application WO 01/11965 discloses a broad family of fungicidal compounds. There is no specific disclosure of N-[2-(2-pyridinyl)cycloalkyl]carboxamide derivatives.<br>

We have now found a new family of compounds which show enhanced fungicidal activity over the general known family of such compounds.<br>

Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a fungicidal composition comprising, as an active ingredient, an effective amount of a compound of general formula (I) as defined above and an agriculturally acceptable support, carrier or filler.<br>
In the present specification, the term "support" denotes a natural or synthetic, organic or inorganic material with which the active material is combined to make it easier to apply, notably to the parts of the plant. This support is thus generally inert and should be agriculturally acceptable. The support may be a solid or a liquid.

Mixtures of such supports may also be used.<br>
The composition may also comprise additional components. In particular, the composition may further comprise a surfactant. The surfactant can be an emulsifier, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent of ionic or non-ionic type or a mixture of such surfactants.

Preferably, surfactant content may be comprised between 5% and 40% by weight of the composition.<br>
Optionally, additional components may also be included, e.g. protective colloids, adhesives, thickeners, thixotropic agents, penetration agents, stabilisers, sequestering agents.
