DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0026]	Methods and apparatus for personal heat control are described.<br>
Broadly stated, a personal heat control device includes a heat transfer unit, such as a<br>
thermoelectric cooling module employing a phenomenon known as the "Peltier<br>
Effect," for providing cooling and heating. According to one embodiment, a Peltier-<br>
effect unit is mounted in or on a flexible enclosure that is either wearable by a person<br>
or removably attachable or integrated into to a wearable item such as an article of<br>
clothing, athletic gear, safety or protective gear, or accessories.<br>
[0027]	According to another embodiment, a personal heat-control device may<br>
be a stand-alone device or integrated within an accessory or other conventional<br>
portable device, such as a key FOB, pendant, mobile phone, pager, personal digital<br>
assistant, camera, spectacles, hearing aids, jewelry. The portable device whether<br>
integrated or stand-alone enables heat transfer to be made from or to a person's body<br>
for comfort or refreshment purposes by directly or indirectly engaging a heating<br>
surface or a cooling surface of the device with, for example, the palm of ones hand,<br>
the inside of the wrist, the forehead, the temple, or other area of the body where blood<br>
vessels are close to the skin surface. In this manner, rapid and effective transfer of<br>
heat for cooling or warming the body can be achieved. Additionally, according to<br>
various embodiments of the present invention, the cooling or warming can be<br>
achieved with economical expenditure of electrical energy and under close control.<br>
Miniature personal heat-control devices, such as PCDs, bring a new dimension to<br>
personal cooling in the fields of leisure, fashion, healthcare and sport; and eliminate<br>
or reduce the need for fans, ice crystals, water sprays and bulky collar coolers.<br>
[0028]	A more general description of personal heat control device using a<br>
Peltier-effect unit has been given in the U.S. Patent Number 5,970,718, entitled "PERSONAL HEAT CONTROL" and issued to the present inventor. U.S. Patent Number 5,970,718 is hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>

[0033]	The phrases "in one embodiment," "according to one embodiment,"<br>
and the like generalfy mean the particular feature, structure, or characteristic<br>
following the phrase is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
and may be included in more than one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Importantly, such phases do not necessarily refer to the same embodiment.<br>
[0034]	If the specification states a component or feature "may", "can",<br>
"could", or "might" be included or have a characteristic, that particular component or<br>
feature is not required to be included or have the characteristic.<br>
[0035]	The phrase "personal heat-control device" generally refers to a<br>
portable device that may produce a heating or cooling effect. An example of a<br>
personal heat-control device is a personal cooling device (PCD).<br>
[0036]	Figure 1A shows an illustrative cross-sectional view of a personal<br>
heat-control device 100 constructed as a flexible strip according to one embodiment of the present invention. In this example, a heat transfer unit 101 (indicated by a dotted box) includes one or more thermoelectric-cooling units 104 employing the Peltier Effect (also referred to as "Peltier-effect units" or "Peltier modules") an<br><br>
optional spreader 102 that functions as a spreader to enlarge the cooling surface of<br>
one or more ceramic thermoelectric Peltier modules 104, and a heat sink block or strip<br>
103 mounted on the hot ceramic face of one or more of the Peltier modules 104.<br>
[0037]	According to one embodiment, the spreader 102 is formed of a copper<br>
foil or similar conductive alloy, metal, or material, such as aluminum, stainless steel, carbon-fiber, or carbon-carbon materials and/or composites. The dimensions of the spreader 102 may be tailored for the particular application. Empirical data suggests that strips of approximately 0.25mm thickness, 12mm width, and 75mm length is sufficient in terms of flexibility and cooling ability for the baseball cap embodiment, for example, discussed below. According to one embodiment, as depicted in Figure IB, the spreader 102 may be excluded from heat transfer unit 101' and the cold ceramic faces of the one or more ceramic thermoelectric Peltier modules 104 may form a cooling surface of an alternative configuration of a personal heat-control device 100'.<br>
[0038]	The spreader 102, which ma}' be pre-coated by powder coating, in this<br>
example, represents the cold face or cooling surface to be exposed on the cold side of the Peltier-effect unit. The back (inside) surface of the spreader 102 has mounted thereon the cold ceramic face of one or more thermoelectric Peltier modules 104 fixed with a thermally conductive adhesive, such as double sided tape, epoxy cement or the like.<br>
[0039]	On the hot ceramic face of each Peltier module will be mounted an<br>
aluminum (or similar conductive alloy, metal, or material, such as magnesium, carbon-fiber, and/or carbon-carbon materials or composites) heat sink block or strip 103, which may be partially or fully exposed on a hot face of the personal heat-control device or ventilated sufficiently via the use of a breathable material enclosure or one or more open channels or troughs in enclosure materials to enable more efficient dissipation of heat. Individual heat sink blocks 103 may be on the order of 1mm<br><br>
thick, 1 Omm wide and 100mm long. Strip metal heat sinks may be thinner, however, the length should be selected so as to maintain the flexibility of the personal heat-control device for the intended application. As above, a thermally conductive adhesive, such as double sided tape, epoxy cement or the like, may be used to mount the heat sinks onto the Peltier modules 104. According to one embodiment, the surface area of the heat sink 103 may be several times the size of the cooling surface with or without the spreader 102, e.g., two to seven times larger depending upon the materials used, to promote rapid heat dissipation. Additionally, the spreader 102 may be finned to increase the efficiency of the heat sink by increasing the surface area and allowing increased heat dissipation.<br>
[0040]	According to one embodiment, as depicted in Figure 1C, the heat sink<br>
block 103 may be excluded from a heat transfer unit 101" and the enclosure 110 may<br>
function as the heat dissipation mechanism for a personal heat-control device 100".<br>
[0041]	As is well-known, Peltier modules (also referred to as thermoelectric<br>
modules (TEMs) or thermoelectric coolers (TECs)) are highly efficient heat pumps<br>
that directly convert electricity into heating and cooling power. "When power is<br>
supplied to the Peltier modules, the current causes one side of the Peltier modules and<br>
hence one side of the personal heat-control device (the cool side) to absorb heat.<br>
Meanwhile, the other side of the Peltier modules (the hot side) release heat (the hot<br>
side). That is, the Peltier module causes heat to flow from the cool side to the hot<br>
side. Reversing the current causes the heat to be moved in the opposite direction<br>
thereby reversing the hot side and the cold side. Consequently, according to one<br>
embodiment, the heating or cooling effect produced by a particular surface of the<br>
personal heat-control device may be selectable by the end user.<br>
[0042]	In the embodiments depicted, in Figures 1A-C. the basic personal<br>
heat-control device elements described above are encapsulated within an optional soft-faced and flexible housing/enclosure 110 constructed of one or more bonded<br><br>
layers of one or more of polyester (polyether), polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon, kevlar, nomex, polyacrylonitrile, cellulose, and polyurethane, or similar foams and/or fibers. Use of flexible, soft-faced materials that are also breathable will facilitate the dispersing of heat generated by the Peltier modules 104 through the housing or enclosure.<br>
[0043]	According to one embodiment, within the flexible housing 110 are<br>
formed chambers of sufficient size and shape to house one or more DC power<br>
supplies 115 to power optional electronics, such as a display, e.g., an LCD, to indicate<br>
operational and/or battery status, and provide current to the heat transfer unit 101 or<br>
101' or 101". Also, optionally housed are one or more of a timer, a solid-state<br>
electronic timing switch 109, an IC chip, and an electro-luminescence (EL) device.<br>
[0044]	According to one embodiment, personal heat-control device 100, 100'<br>
and/or 100" is as convenient to recharge as a mobile phone. The DC power supplies<br>
115 maybe Lithium Ion (Li-ion) rechargeable batteries with solid state electrolyte or<br>
lithium thin cell primary batteries electrically connected, e.g. by wires or conductive<br>
strips, to energize the heat transfer unit 101,101' or 101" on activation of the solid<br>
state electronic timing switch 109 mounted on the outside of the flexible enclosure.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, the batteries used to power the<br>
circuitry in the personal heat-control device may be Nickel Cadmium (Ni-Cd), Nickel<br>
Metal Hydride (Ni-MH) or other type of rechargeable batteries. They can also be<br>
disposable batteries. The batteries themselves can be constructed in flexible form,<br>
such as those developed by Power Paper Ltd., based in Tel Aviv, Israel. For example,<br>
a flexible battery may be printed directly onto paper, plastic or other flexible material.<br>
[0045]	According to another embodiment, the DC power supplies 115<br>
comprise fuel cells, such as those utilizing methanol cartridges, for example, or solar cells. The DC power supplies 115 may be embedded in a sealed flexible enclosure with the rest of the personal heat-control deA'ice circuitry, enclosed in an openable<br><br>
enclosure (particularly suited for disposable batteries or fuel cell cartridges), or<br>
external to the personal heat-control device enclosure. Recharging batteries within<br>
the flexible personal heat-control device can be achieved via either a 2- or 3-pin flat<br>
connector or alternatively a circular connector, for example, any of which can be<br>
recessed into the flexible housing 110, on any face of the unit 100. 100' or 100".<br>
[0046]	On the cold face 125 of the personal heat-control device 100, the soft-<br>
faced, flexible housing 110 is cut or otherwise molded or formed to expose,<br>
preferably in a flush manner, the spreader 102. On the hot face 120 of the personal<br>
heat-control device 100, the soft housing 110 can optionally be cut or otherwise<br>
molded or formed to expose the heat sink(s) 103. The outer surface of the hot side 120<br>
may have a Velcro attachment material or similar material, mounted and adhered to it.<br>
This material may cover the entire surface of the soft and flexible housing 110 on the<br>
hot side 120 of the personal heat-control device 100 with the exception of the heat<br>
sinks 103, which may be exposed to assist the dissipation of heat.<br>
[0047]	It has been found that a pleasant cooling effect is achieved when the<br>
unit is activated and the cooling surface or spreader 102 is applied to a portion of the<br>
body where blood vessels are close to the surface of the skin for between about 1 to<br>
10 seconds. The timing switch circuitry 109, may prevent or otherwise limit<br>
successive reactivation of the unit 100 for a short period, to prevent overcooling, to<br>
allow battery recovery, and/or to allow heat generated in the unit 100 to disperse<br>
through the hot face 120 of the housing 110. According to one embodiment, the<br>
housing 110 may be formed of a thermally conductive material to support more rapid<br>
heat dissipation and increase the effective surface area of the heat sink.<br>
[0048]	Figures 2A and 2B depict front and back views of a personal heat-<br>
control device integrated within an ornamental key FOB, pendant or medallion according to one embodiment of the present invention. In the example depicted, a medallion 200 includes an activation switch 205 on the front face. The encasing 207<br><br>
is formed of aluminum or other metal, alloy, or other heat conductive material and acts as a heat sink. On the backside, one or more cool spots 210 are provided. While in this example, the cool spot 210 is comprised of the cold ceramic faces of one or more ceramic TECs, in alternative embodiments, an optional spreader ma3' increase the surface area of the cool spot 210.<br>
[0049]	Figures 3 and 4 depict alternative embodiments of a personal heat-<br>
control devices integrated within ornamental key FOBs, pendants or medallions.<br>
[0050]	Figures 5A-C depict front, back, and side views, respectively, of a<br>

In an embodiment in which the personal heat-control device is integrated with the watch, the personal heat-control device and watch may share the same DC power source.<br>
[0051]	Figures 6A and 6B depict front and back views, respectively, of a<br>
mobile phone 600 having an integrated personal heat-control device, such as a PCD, according to one embodiment of the present invention. In the example illustrated, one or more cool spots 605 are provided on the backside of the mobile phone 600. Alternatively, cool spots could be positioned on the front side of the mobile phone 600 or they could be present on more than one surface. As above, the surface area of the one or more cool spots 605 may be increased according to alternative embodiments by employing an optional spreader, such as a thin conductive foil. In an embodiment in which the personal heat-control device is integrated with the mobile phone 600, the personal heat-control device and mobile phone 600 may share the same DC power source.<br>
[0052]	Figures 7A and 7B depict a flexible personal heat-control device<br>
which may be incorporated within or removably attached to a baseball cap 700 according to one embodiment of the present invention. In the embodiment depicted, a flexible PCD 710 is removably affixed to the baseball cap 700 using a fastener such<br><br>
as a fabric hook-and-loop fastener, such as Velcro strips 705 and 706 or a similar<br>
form of attachment. In one embodiment, the device is sufficiently flexible to conform<br>
easily to the general shape of the baseball cap 700 and the wearer's forehead.<br>
[0053]	In the embodiment depicted, the surface of the PCD 710 that will be in<br>
contact with the wearer's forehead includes one or more cool spots 712 and the opposite side includes the attachment means for attaching to the baseball cap 700 and an exposed heat sink 711.<br>
[0054]	While in the embodiment depicted, the flexible PCD 710 is illustrated<br>
as being removably attachable to the baseball cap 700 and therefore repositionable, one or more flexible PCDs may also be more permanently incorporated within a wearable article in alternative embodiments. For example, in the case of a baseball cap, the flexible PCD may be inserted through a slit in the liner, placed into a preformed pocket in the liner, or even sewn into the liner.<br>
[0055]	While for sake of brevity an exemplar}' garment having incorporated<br>
therein a personal heat-control device has been described with respect to a baseball cap, according to alternative embodiments of the present invention personal heat-control devices may be incorporated in or attached to various other articles of clothing, apparel, gear, headwear, footwear and/or safety or protective gear using the teachings provided herein.<br>
[0056]	Figure 8 depicts a band 800 having a personal heat-control device<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention. In this example, the band 800 includes a PCD 810, such as that depicted in Figure 1 (with or without the flexible housing 110), and a strap 815, such as an elastic loop. The PCD 810 maybe fitted into elastic or stretchable material or toweling for comfort and the cold surface may rest directly or indirectly against the wearer's skin. The band 800 may be worn as a head band, wrist band, or the like depending upon the size and configuration of the PCD 800 and the strap 815.<br><br>
 [0057]	Figures 9 and 10 depict a cold face 910 and a heat-dissipating control<br>
face 1020, respectively, of a personal heat-control device 900 constructed as an adaptable strip according to an alternative embodiment of the present invention. In this example, the inside (cold) face 910 exposes two cold spots 911 which may represent the cool ceramic faces of two TECs mounted to an internal heat transfer unit (not shown), such as a thermoelectric-cooling unit employing the Peltier Effect (as discussed earlier). According to one embodiment, the dimensions of the cold spots 911 are approximately 1cm by 1cm. Depending upon the cooling effect desired, however, more or fewer cold spots may be employed and/or the dimensions may be adjusted accordingly.<br>
[0058]	As described earlier, TECs are highly efficient heat pumps that directly<br>
convert electricity into heating and cooling power. When power is supplied to the TECs, the current causes one side of the TECs and hence one side of the personal heat-control device, i.e., the inside (cold) face 910, to absorb heat. Meanwhile, the other side of the TECs (the hot side) releases heat via the heat dissipating control face 1020.<br>
[0059]	In the embodiment depicted, a control circuit board 1030, one or more<br>
batteries 1011, and other personal heat-control device elements are integrated within<br>
an enclosure 915. According to one embodiment, the inside (cold) face 910 of the<br>
enclosure 915 is constructed of bonded layers of one or more of polyester (polyether),<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon, kevlar, nomex, polyacrylonitrile, cellulose, and<br>
polyurethane, or similar foams and/or fibers to provide a soft and flexible face.<br>
[0060]	According to the embodiment depicted, a heat-dissipating control face<br>
1020 of the personal heat-control device 900 may have formed thereon one or more garment clips 1041 to facilitate attachment of the personal heat-control device 900 to a garment. A control button 1010 may also be included within the heat-dissipating<br><br>
control face 1020 to allow activation/deactivation of the personal heat-control device 900.<br>
[0061]	According to one embodiment, the heat-dissipating control face 1020<br>
represents or is part of a heat sink that is thermally coupled to the hot side of the<br>
TECs. The heat-dissipating control face 1020 may comprise aluminum or similar<br>
conductive alloy, metal, or material, such as magnesium or copper.<br>
[0062]	Figure 11 is a logical illustration of a distributed arrangement of<br>
components of a personal heat-control device within a garment 1100 according to one embodiment of the present invention. In this example, the components that make up the personal heat-control device include an operational switch 1110, a control circuit board (printed or otherwise) 1120, one or more TECs 1140, and one or more batteries 1130. The components may be distributed within and/or permanently or temporarily attached to the garment 1100.<br>
[0063]	Depending upon the particular application or garment, two or more of<br>
the components may be co-located or combined. Alternatively, the components may be further broken down into smaller sub-components, for example, individual ICs of the control circuit board 1120 may be separately deployed within the garment 1100, one or more TECs may be located remotely from one or more other TECs 1140 to provide a more distributed cooling effect. Similarly, batteries 1130 may be distributed within the garment 1100 rather than being clustered together or being placed in proximity to each other.<br>
[0064]	The operational switch 1110 is communicatively coupled to the control<br>
circuit board 1120. The control circuit board 1120 may optionally be communicatively coupled to the TECs 1140 to receive temperature information, for example. Such temperature information might be used tc increase or decrease the duration of the heat transfer cycle and/or allow other adjustments to be made by control circuitry residing on the control circuit board 1120 to contribute to end-user<br><br>
comfort and/or battery preservation. The batteries 1130 provide DC power to control circuitry and/or timer circuitry resident on the control circuit board 1120 and the TECsll40.<br>
[0065]	The control circuit board 1120 may include voltage sensing to allow<br>
the TECs 1140 to be shut down if the voltage being provided to the control circuit board 1120 drops below a predetermined threshold, for example below 1 volt, that would be too low to allow the correct operation of certain circuitry residing on the control circuit board 1120. Such a voltage sensing and shut off mechanism may reduce the risk of the TECs remaining energized during a period of time when the control circuitry is inoperable.<br>
[0066]	The operational switch 1110 may represent a solid-state electronic<br>
timing switch operable by an end-user to activate and deactivate heat transfer cycles modulated by optional electronics, such as a timer and/or other monitoring or control circuitry. According to one embodiment, the optional electronics provide timed cycling (pulsing) of the TECs 1140 to extend operational time per battery charge, to avoid overcooling, to increase the comfort of the user, and/or accommodate battery recovery.<br>
[0067]	According to one embodiment, the transmission of one or more of DC<br>
power, control signaling and/or status information among various of the distributed components is via wireless means. In alternative embodiments, the transmission of one or more of power, control signaling and/or status information among various of the distributed components is via one or more fine conductive wires formed as part of the material of a garment. For example, a plurality of super-fine conductive wires (individually or as twisted pairs of such threads) can be used for sewing seams of the garment or woven into the fabric (natural or artificial) of the garment. In this manner, the fabric could form transmission/communication paths among distributed components 1110. 1120, 1130, 1140 of the personal heat-control device.<br><br>
 [0068]	Figure 12 depicts a soft-faced and flexible personal heat-control<br>
device 1210, such as a personal cooling device (PCD), incorporated within or<br>
removably attached to a baseball cap 1200 according to an alternative embodiment of<br>
the present invention. In this example, two cold spots 1211 are located in a heat<br>
transfer portion 1215 of the PCD 1210 that is positioned along the brim of the<br>
baseball cap so as to contact the forehead of the wearer. The control and/or timing<br>
circuitry, one or more batteries, and switch (not shown) are coupled to the heat<br>
transfer portion 1215 but are located apart from the heat transfer portion 1215.<br>
[0069]	According to one embodiment, a soft-faced, H-shaped enclosure 1214<br>
encapsulates all of the PCD components 1211 and 1215. In other embodiments, some<br>
of the PCD components may be located within the soft-faced flexible enclosure 1214<br>
and others may be distributed and incorporated into other portions of the cap 1200.<br>
[0070]	Figure 13 depicts representative components of a personal heat-control<br>
device according to one embodiment of the present invention, including a control circuit board 1310 having mounted thereon one or more ICs, a nickel metal hydride battery 1320 and a lithium ion battery 1340, and one or more conductive wires 1330 to provide DC power to the components and/or provide for signaling among the components.<br>
[0071]	Figures 14A-B depict the inside and outside, respectively, of a cycling<br>
helmet 1400 having incorporated therein a distributed personal cooling device (PCD) according to one embodiment of the present invention. In this example, the various PCD components are distributed and incorporated into and/or affixed to the frame of the cycling helmet. Two cool spots 1411 are located proximate to a front portion 1410 of the helmet and mounted within the internal molding of the cycling helmet. The control button 1420 is located separate and apart from the cool spots 1411. The control button 1420 is affixed to a top portion of the cycling helmet 1400 within one of the vents, for example, and accessible to the wearer from the outside of the cycling<br><br>
helmet 1400.   The encapsulated control circuit board 1430 is located proximate to the<br>
control button 1420. DC power supply 1440 is located proximate to the control<br>
circuit board. In alternative embodiments, the PCD components may be distributed,<br>
incorporated, and/or affixed to the frame of the cycling helmet in other arrangements<br>
or configurations. For example, the cold spots 1411 may be positioned elsewhere<br>
within the helmet 1400, such as against the back of the neck. Additionally, the<br>
control button 1420 may be mounted in other locations that are convenient, such as to<br>
the visor, in the back 1460 of the helmet or on the right or left side of the helmet.<br>
[0072]	While exemplar}' usage models for personal cooling and embodiments<br>
of personal heat-control devices have been illustrated and described herein, they are<br>
not intended to be exhaustive. Alternative embodiments of the present invention are<br>
thought to have broad applicability in the fields of leisure, fashion, healthcare and<br>
sport. For example, one or more portable and flexible personal heat-control devices<br>
may be incorporated within and/or removably attached to athletic apparel or gear,<br>
clothing, accessories, headwear, safety or protective gear, including, but not limited to<br>
biking shorts, biking jerseys, exercise suits, sport bras, spandex pants, shorts, tops,<br>
shirts, gloves, shoes, boots, socks, heart monitors, wrist watches, wrist bands, glasses,<br>
sunglasses, headphones, medallions, pendants, jewelry (e.g., necklaces, bracelets,<br>
anklets), uniforms, baseball caps, golf caps, protective clothing (e.g., surgeon caps,<br>
gardening hat, sun hat), police or military caps/hats or headgear, visors, head bands,<br>
hats, chemical suits, bio suits, space suits, bullet-proof vests, fire protective suits,<br>
motorcycle leathers, goggles, hard hats, motor racing helmets, motor cycle helmets,<br>
bicycle helmets, football helmets, batting helmets, skiing helmets and the like.<br>
[0073]	Furthermore, personal heating devices may be incorporated into or<br>
attached to ski boots, ski poles, gloves, mittens, snow shoes, snow boots, ski jackets, snow boards, skis, toboggans, sleds, sleighs, or other winter sporting/leisure equipment accessories, or garments.<br><br>
 [0074]	In addition to sales of personal heat-control devices built into<br>
garments, it is contemplated that personal heat-control devices will be sold as kits for insertion into or attachment to various types of garments.<br>
[0075]	According to other embodiments of the present invention, a PCD may<br>
be part of a stand-alone dedicated portable cooling device or integrated into or<br>
temporarily affixed or attached to other conventional consumer products or devices,<br>
including, but not limited to water bottles (as coolers, for example), camel back liners<br>
or bladders, cameras, key chains, pulse monitors, electric shavers, hand held razor<br>
blade holders for use with either metal or ceramic blades, etc.<br>
[0076]	Optionally, the personal heat-control device may include timers or EL<br>
devices. Their operation can be modulated by one or more IC chips. For example, the PCD could employ a timing device modulated by an IC chip to periodically activate cooling for a predetermined (e.g., 10,15, 30 seconds) or user-adjustable amount of time. Additionally, the timing device may control the minimum time between operations in order to allow batteries to recover and/or allow appropriate heat dissipation. According to one embodiment, the TECs may operate in accordance with multiple modes of pulsed operation, e.g., a single cold pulse per cycle or multiple pulses per cycle.<br>
[0077]	EL technology (electro-luminescence) can be incorporated into a<br>
personal heat-control device according to one embodiment of the present invention. For example, a strobe light of white, red or blue color can be used to accompany the operation of a PCD to indicate, among other things, the "on" state of the personal heat-control device and cooling or heating operation of the personal heat-control device. Pulsating strobe lights can be modulated by an IC chip. The voltage needed for the strobe lights can be produced by, for example, high frequency power converters.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
