				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an. improved process for the preparation of ultrathin/ thin films of metallic compounds. Particularly the process relates to the preparation of film of metal in the form of oxides, halides, chalcogenides ( i.e. sulphides, selenides, Tellurides). The thickness of the films prepared by the process of the present invention is in the range of 30 to 500 A. The films formed are useful in molecular electronics. The various applications of such films could be as electric capacitors, electrochromic films, corrosion resistant coatings, antireflection coatings, surface passivation coatings etc.<br>
The conventional methods employed for the formation of thin/ultrathin films are:<br>
(1)	Sol-gelation method (sol-gel)<br>
(2)	Vapour Evaporation Technique (VE)<br>
(3)	Glow Dishcarge Technologies (Sputtering)<br>
(4)	Plasma processes<br>
(5)	Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD)<br>
(6)	Electro plating<br>
(7)	Spray Pyrolysis<br>
(8)	Spin on method<br>
(9)	Langmuir Blodgett Method (LB)<br>
(10)	Liquid liquid interface reaction technique (LLIRT)<br>
The above mentioned methods and their drawbacks are discussed below.<br>
(1) Sol-gel Method: Molecular or atomic conglomerates when stabilize in a suspended state in an aqueous liquid is called sol. These conglomerates or suspensions can be destabilized to aggregated particles or homogeneous gel by changing the conditions of solvation or suspension in sols. If the said molecular or atomic conglomerates are desired to be deposited in the form of uniform films during gelation, a substrate, glass plate or quartz plate or the like is dipped in a sol and drawn out. A thin coating of gel is formed. The substrate is then dried. The heat treatment of substrate leads to oxide coating.<br><br>
Drawbacks: The conditions of sol stabilization and gelation are very critical. Also, thickness control is difficult. During the drying of gel and post deposition heat treatment, large volume changes bring about cracks in gel material and therefore it is difficult to get homogeneous, uncracked films.<br>

(2) Vacuum Evaporative Technologies: The substance of which a thin / ultrathin film is to be deposited is generated in vapour state by boiling, sublimating or vapourizing by giving sufficient energy by heating, electron beam bombardment, lasers or any other energy source.' In the second step vapour is transported to substrate without any chemical change occuring in the substance and in the last step, the substance is allowed to condense / deposite on substrate surface such as glass/ quartz plate, silicon wafer etc.<br>
Drawbacks: High vacuum is required. Some chemical changes in substance composition is quite common such as nonstoichiometry or contamination from source container. For the uniform and adherent films to be obtained, the number of parameters are large and therefore process monitoring and control is needed. Molecular beam epitaxy which is an improved technology over vacuum evaporation is mainly used for growing single crystalline films (very ordered films) on single crystal substrates. The cost and number of parameters are increased many folds. The operation* is complex and throughput is very low.<br>

(3)	Glow discharge technologies (Sputtering):   The ejection of surface<br>
atoms from an electrode surface by momentum transfer from bombarding ion<br>
is called sputtering.  In other words during sputtering process source of<br>
electrode material in vapour state is made available, which is used for thin film<br>
formation as in vacuum evaporation.<br>
There are various ways in which basic process is modified. AC sputtering, bias sputtering, magnetron sputtering are often used modifications.<br>
Drawback : The main drawback is contamination problem. Also, the equipment is sophisticated and very costly.<br>

(4)	Plasma processes:    Some chemical reactions are accelerated in<br>
presence of bombarding reactive ions. Therefore, the electrode material<br>
(metal) in presence of gases like 02 , N2+H2, CH4 forming a glow discharge<br>
forms a film of metal oxide, carbide, nitride on the substrate surface. The<br>
plasma can be generated by means of discharge in vacuum,  electron<br>
bumbardment, cyclotron resonance etc.<br><br>
Drawback: The drawbacks of this process is again high cost equipment. Also limited number of reactions can be carried out and thin films formed by this method.<br>

(5) Chemical vapour deposition: In this method the constituents of vapour phase are made to react near or on the substrate surface where the solid product is obtained in thin film form. Since large number of reactions are avail¬able, CVD is versatile and flexible technique in producing variety of products (oxides, sulphides, selenides etc.) in thin film form including metals, semiconductors, insulators.<br>
Metal organics are very convenient for CVD application as relatively low temperatures, can transform them in vapour phase, compared to pure inorganic compounds. This, therefore has become a main modification of CVD called MOCVD.<br>
As a modification of CVD, other energy sources assistance is taken to<br>
carry out reactions by increasing the reaction rates. The lasers, photons (light)<br>
are utilized for this purpose.	&gt;<br>
Drawback : Although the chemistry part of CVD appears to be simple, the monitoring of many parameters is needed to achieve films of good quality. The process, therefore, becomes technically complicated and critical. Also, thick¬ness control of the film is difficult.<br><br>

(6)	Electroplating: When a current is passed through a conducting solution<br>
(electrolyte) and suitable reactions are taking place at either cathode i.e.<br>
negative electrode or anode i.e. positive electrode, it is possible to employ this<br>
method in depositing thin films on conducting substrates. By controlling the<br>
pH, current density (current / area of electrode ), temperature, composition of<br>
electrolyte it is possible to get uniform films of metals.some metal oxides,<br>
chalcogenides etc.<br>
Drawbacks: Films are obtained only on the conducting substrates. Also, the contamination is a common problem as many reactions can take place simultaneously.<br>

(7)	Spry pyrolysis:   The "atomised" droplets of the solution  are spread<br>
on hot substrate where pyrolysis takes place,  leading to a film on the<br><br>
substrate surface. Although versatile, this method is not useful for making ultra-thin films.<br>

(8)	Spin on method:   In "spin on" method of depositing thin films a drop<br>
of solution or sol is placed on rotating substate. By centrifugal force the<br>
solution /sol  is  spread  on the  surface  of the  substrate where  geletion<br>
reaction   takes   place   as   explained in   the   sol -gel   technique.   Further<br>
heating the substrate, converts the gel film in ,to oxide film.<br>
Drawbacks: The method can be used only for specific applications. Also, very thin film in submicron range cannot be deposited by this method with uniformity and continuity.<br>

(9)	Langmuir Blodgett method:   In this method a known quantity (1x10"5<br>
tolxlO^M) of a solution of film forming materials such as fatty acids C PH 2n+i<br>
COOH or amines C nH 2n+i NH 2 dissolved in volatile solvent such as benzene,<br>
chloroform, carbon tetrachloride etc. is delivered on a known area of clean<br><br>
water surface held in Langmuir trough (rectangular or circular) fitted with film pressure balance.<br>
These materials form monomolecular films at air- water interface, on lateral compression of the film with help of barrier or oil piston (such as oleic acid), condensed phase is obtained. If the soluble metal salts are added in aqueous subphase the cations/or(anions) get attached to the acid/(or amine) groups at the surface. The deposition of a monolayer on to a solid substrate such as glass plate quartz plate silicon wafer etc. is effected by introducing the substrate inside the aqueous subphase. For every withdrawal or dipping of the substrate one monolayer is deposited. Usually the dipping or withdrawal is effected under constant surface pressure (15 to 35 dynes/cm.).The nature and the amount of the species deposited from the aqueous subphase depends on deposition condition such as concentration, pH, rate of dipping and withdrawal, deposition pressure etc. By varying the deposition parameters the optimal condition for the deposition of metal ion is obtained. The deposited films are then thermally decomposed (500-900° C) to get stable ultrathin oxide films. The thickness of the film can be controlled by the number of monolayer deposited.<br>
Drawbacks: Only limited number of cation or anions could be brought in the film to react and to give desired product. Also, in the post deposition treatment, the long chain carbon containing part is to be removed mainly by burning. This leaves some chances of 'C'(carbon) contamination in the films. Also, the chemical reduction of the film material by carbon during heat<br>
treatment is possible.<br>

(10) Liquid liquid interface reaction technique (LLIRT): In this process two immiscible, an aqueous and organic solvent- solutions, containing spacies which react at the interface and form a solid product of desired material or a precursor to it, in a particulate film form. This film is pressurised laterally which facilitates its transfer on desired substrate when the substrate is vertically dipped and withdrawn from the solution with a conveninent rate.<br>
Drawback: One of the solutions use oraganic solvent which limits the scope of this method. The spacies which are insoluble in organic solvent and soluble in aqueous solvent only, could not be used via spreading over aqueous phase.<br>

The invention is illustrated by the examples given below which should not be construed to the limit of the scope of present invention.<br>
Example I<br>
A solution of sodium hydroxide in a concentration of 1x 10~3 M in double distilled water is prepared. The solution is contained in a teflon trough 45 times 15 times 2 cms size. The solution is marked as 'A'.<br>
A solution of potassium titanyl oxalate in a concentration of 1 x 10'3 M in a mixture of carbon tetrachloride and water is prepared. This solution is marked as 'B'. 0.5 ml. of solution 'B' is spread on solution 'A1. The film formed at the interface of aqueous phase and spreading solution is compressed laterally with the help of oleic acid piston ( pressure 30 dynes/cm.), after evaporating the spreading solvent. A quartz plate 1 times 1 cm. was vertically dipped and withdrawn from the solution with a rate 1cm./min. transfering the film on the substrate. This operation is repeated fifty times, for increasing the thickness. A film thus formed is heated to high temperature 800°C for 24 hours. The film is characterized by X-ray diffraction and was determined to be TiO2<br>
Example II<br>
A solution of potassium iodide in the concentration of 3 x 10"* M. in double distilled water was prepared. The solution is ontained in a teflon trough of 45x15x2 cm. size. This solution is marked, as 'A'. A solution of AgN03 in undried chloroform is prepared with the concentration of 1 x 10~5 M.<br>
This solution is marked as solution 'B'. 0.2 ml. of 'B' was spread on 'A' to form a film of silver iodide on the surface of aqueous solution. After evaporating chloroform the film was compressed laterally with the help of oleic acid piston ( pressure 30 dynes/cm.) and transferred on glass substrate of 1x1x0.25 cm. size, by dipping it into the solutions for 100 times to form the thin layer of film on the substrate. The film thus formed is charactrised by low angled XRD and was found to be of Silver iodide.<br>
Example III<br>
A solution of sodium hydroxide in a concentration of 1 x 10"3 M in double distilled water is prepared. The solution is contained in teflon trough of the size 45x15x2 cm. The solution is marked as 'A'. A solution of zinc chloride in a concentration of 1 x 10~3 M in water is prepared. o.2 ml of this solution is added to 5 ml of dry carbon tetrachloride. This solution is marked as 'B1. 0.5ml. of 'B1 is spread over 'A'. The film forms at interface. The spread solution<br>
/<br>
is allowed to evaporate. The film on the aqueous surface is compressed laterally with the help of oleic acid piston ( pressure 30 dynes/cm.). A quartz substrate is vertically dipped and withdrawn from the solutions with a fix rate of 0.5 cm/min. This operation is repeated 100 times.
