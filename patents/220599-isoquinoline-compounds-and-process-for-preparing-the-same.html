DESCRIPTION ISOQUINOLINE COMPOUNDS AND MEDICINAL USE THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a novel isoquinoline compound and a pharmaceutical agent containing same as an active ingredient.<br>
Background Art<br>
Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase, hereinafter sometimes to be abbreviated as ^PARP", is an intranuclear enzyme that utilizes nicotinamide nucleotide (NAD) as a substrate, cleaves the bond between nicotinamide and ribose, transfers ADP-ribose residue into a protein, and causes addition polymerization of plural ADP-ribose residues. This enzyme is attractive as an apoptosis-related enzyme, which is considered to be activated by recognizing the nick of DNA damaged by a free radical, such as nitrogen monoxide, active oxygen and the like, which is produced in the lesion during ischemia, and have a primary role to aid DNA repair.<br>
It is considered in recent years that the activation of PARP decreases intracellular NAD, a large amount of ATP is consumed to compensate for the decrease, as a result of which intracellular energy is depleted, and the cell is driven to death. In an experiment using a PARP knockout mouse, it has been clarified that a cultured neuronal cells show resistance to disorders due to excitatory amino acids, such as nitrogen monoxide, NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) and the like, and that it shows a tremendous protective effect by inhibiting cerebral infarction caused by cerebral ischemia by not less than 80% (Eliasson MJL. et al., Nature Med., 3, 1089-95 (1997)).<br>
However, none of the reported PARP inhibitors to date has subjected to a clinical trial as a therapeutic agent for cerebral infarction. As the reported PARP inhibitors to date, for example, 5-substituted-3,4-dihydro-2H-isoquinoline derivatives (JP-A-H2-124874) , 1,llb-dihydrobenzopyrano [4.3.2-de]isoquinolin-3-one derivatives (W099/11645), 3,4-dihydro-5-[4-(1-piperidinyl)-butoxy]-1(2H)-isoquinoline (each of WO99/08680 and W099/11649), pyrimidine derivatives (WO00/42025), benzimidazole derivatives (each of WO00/64878 and WO00/68206), phthalazine derivatives (each of WO00/67734<br><br>
and WOOO/44726) , quinazolinone derivatives (each of WO02/48117 and WO02/44157) and the like are known, but the PARP inhibitory activity thereof is not very strong.<br>
Moreover, JP-B-S46-12454 discloses isoquinoline derivatives having an analgesic action and a hypoglycemic action, US Patent Nos. 1174272 and 1062357 respectively disclose quinazoline derivatives having a hypotensive action, GB Patent Nos. 1174272 and 1062357 and DE Patent No. 2121031 respectively disclose quinazoline derivatives having a hypotensive action, US Patent No. 4808595 discloses furopyridine derivatives having an intraocular pressure lowering action, and JP-A-S64-42472 discloses quinazoline derivatives having a cerebral dysfunction improving action, but none of these takes note of the PARP inhibitory activity.<br>

A poly ADP-ribosilation reaction was started by adding 3H-NAD (1.85 kBq, NAD [adenine-2, 8-3H], Daiichi Chemicals Co.f Ltd.) and activated DNA (0.02 mg/mL, 4667-03X, Trevigen) and then the enzyme source to an enzyme reaction buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM iMgCl2, 28 mM KC1, 28 mM NaCl) . After incubation at 25°C for 15 min. , the reaction was stopped by adding 20% trichloroacetic acid, and the resulting acid insoluble fraction was adsorbed to a GF/B<br><br>
filter. The filter was washed several times with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the radioactivity on the filter was measured with a liquid scintillation counter.<br>
The results are shown in Table 1. The PARP activity was determined by subtracting the radioactivity of an enzyme source non-addition sample as a blank value, and a 50% enzyme inhibitory value (IC50 value) of each test compound was calculated with the radioactivity of a compound non-addition sample as 100%.<br><br>
