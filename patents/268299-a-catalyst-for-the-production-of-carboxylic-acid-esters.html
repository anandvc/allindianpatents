SPECIFICATION<br>
CATALYST FOR PRODUCING CARBOXYLIC ACID ESTERS, PROCESS FOR<br>
PRODUCING SAME AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING CARBOXYLIC ACID<br>
ESTERS<br>
Technical Field<br><br>
The present invention relates to a catalyst for use in production of carboxylic<br>
acid esters by reacting an aldehyde and an alcohol, or one or more types of alcohols,<br>
in the presence of oxygen, to a process for producing the catalyst, and to a process<br>
for producing carboxylic acid esters using the catalyst.<br>
Background Art<br><br>
A process for producing useful carboxylic acid esters industrially, in the case of<br>
methyl methacrylate, for example, may include a process in which methacrylic acid is<br>
produced by oxidizing methacrolein with oxygen followed by reacting the methacrylic<br>
acid with methanol to product methyl methacrylate. However, the heteropolyacid<br>
catalyst used in a step for obtaining methacrylic acid by oxidizing methacrolein has<br>
problems with thermal stability, and gradually decomposes under reaction<br>
temperature conditions. In addition, the yield is also still not adequate, thus leaving<br>
room for improvement as an industrial catalyst.<br><br>
On the other hand, the direct metha process for producing methyl methacrylate<br>
or methyl acrylate in a single step by reacting methacrolein or acrolein with methanol<br>
and molecular oxygen is a simple process that does not require separation of easily<br>
polymerizable methacrylic acid or acrylic acid, and is currently attracting attention<br><br>
because of its higher yield of methyl methacrylate in comparison with the above<br>
process.<br>
In such a process, a catalyst primarily containing palladium is used for the<br>
catalyst. However, during production of methyl methacrylate or methyl acrylate in a<br>
single step by reacting methacrolein or acrolein with methanol and molecular oxygen,<br>
since the methacrolein or acrolein is an unsaturated aldehyde, numerous acetals of<br>
the unsaturated aldehyde and alkoxy forms, resulting from addition of alcohol to the<br>
unsaturated bonds, are formed as by-products, while also resulting in the problem of<br>
generation of carbon dioxide gas which is the final oxidation product (see Patent<br>
document 1).<br>
Therefore, modifications have been made to the catalyst to overcome these<br>
problems. For example, the above problems regarding the formation of the<br>
by-products have been reported to be solved and carboxylic acid ester has been<br>
reported to be able to be produced at high yield by using a catalyst containing an<br>
intermetallic compound containing palladium and at least one element selected from<br>
the group consisting of lead, mercury, bismuth and thallium, or a catalyst containing<br>
an alkaline metal compound or alkaline earth metal compound (see Patent Document<br>
2).<br><br>
On the other hand, although the presence of a catalyst containing palladium<br>
was long thought to be required for catalysts used in this process, more recently,<br>
catalysts have been reported to have been used that comprise the loading of a noble<br>
metal such as ruthenium or gold on a support. Specific examples of such processes<br>
include the use of a catalyst in which gold is loaded onto a support (see Patent<br>
document 3) or the use of a catalyst comprised of ruthenium (see Patent document<br><br>
4) during production of carboxylic acid ester by reacting aldehyde and alcohol in the<br>
presence of an oxygen-containing gas.<br><br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
However, in each of the known processes described above, the selectivity of<br>
the resulting carboxylic acid esters and catalyst activity are inadequate, and since<br>
expensive noble metals such as palladium, ruthenium and gold are used by loading<br>
onto a support in high amounts, the economic burden resulting from increased<br>
catalyst production costs is large, thus making it difficult to consider these processes<br>
to be industrially advantageous processes.<br><br>
In addition, since the palladium, ruthenium and gold which are used in the<br>
above production processes are types of noble metals, they are expensive, and when<br>
as a catalyst component, they are frequently used by dispersing and loading onto a<br>
support, thus making the selection of a support extremely important in such cases.<br>
On an assumption of putting industrial process into a practical use, as a result<br>
of conducting extensive studies on catalysts loaded with composite nanoparticles<br>
containing oxidized nickel and X (wherein X represents at least one element selected<br>
from the group consisting of nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, gold, silver and<br>
copper), the inventors of the present invention clearly concluded that a satisfactory<br><br>
catalyst from the viewpoint of catalyst life was not necessarily obtained in the case of<br>
using activated carbon, calcium carbonate, alumina, silica or silica-titania as the<br>
support. Namely, in the case of reacting a catalyst in the form of a slurry in a<br>
commonly used industrial stirring tank reactor or bubble tower reactor and the like,<br>
mechanical strength was inadequate and exfloliation of nickel and component X<br>
which are the catalyst components was observed in the case of activated carbon. In<br>
addition, although alumina has high mechanical strength, the strength of the support<br>
decreases due to corrosion by acidic substances exemplified by characteristic<br>
by-products of the reaction, methacrylic acid and acrylic acid, thereby resulting in the<br>
shortcoming of greater ease of exfoliation of nickel and component X which are the<br>
catalyst components. The use of calcium carbonate for the support results in even<br>
greater susceptibility to the occurrence of corrosion by acidic substances than in the<br>
case of alumina, thereby making it unsuitable for industrial use. In the case of silica<br>
or silica-titania, a portion of the silica is gradually eroded by water introduced along<br>
with the process or by water produced as a by-product of the reaction, thereby<br>
resulting in the phenomenon of the elution of silica, while exfoliation and elution of<br>
nickel and component X which are catalyst components are also simultaneously<br>
observed. Consequently, there are problems as to whether these substances will<br>
remain stable over the course of long-term use. In addition, there are also the<br>
problems of mechanical strength being lower than the above-mentioned alumina.<br>
On the other hand, studies on processes for producing silica gel and studies on<br>
the use of high-temperature sintering to modify silica gel have been reported for the<br><br>
purpose of improving the mechanical strength and corrosion resistance of silica.<br>
However, there have been no examples reported of successfully improving<br>
mechanical strength and hydrolysis stability without impairing the inherent<br><br>
performance of the catalyst. For example, quartz, which is a type of silica-based<br>
substance, is known to be hard, have high mechanical strength and have high<br>
hydrolysis resistance. However, in the case of using quartz as a support, although<br>
mechanical strength and corrosion resistance are remarkably improved, this also<br>
leads to a decreased in specific surface area (1 m2/g or less), and since this prevents<br>
metal catalyst from being loaded in the form of fine particles in a highly dispersed<br>
state, the problem results in the extremely low reactivity of the resulting catalyst.<br>
On the basis of this background as described above, there is currently a need<br>
for a catalyst support that has high mechanical strength and is physically stable while<br>
also having a high surface area suitable for use as a catalyst support, demonstrates<br>
satisfactory corrosion resistance with respect to the characteristic liquid nature of the<br>
reaction in the form of a carboxylic acid ester synthesis reaction in the presence of<br>
oxygen, and is capable of stably loading nickel and component X which are catalyst<br>
active components over a long period of time.<br>
With the foregoing in view, an object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
catalyst for use in production of carboxylic acid ester by reacting aldehyde and<br>
alcohol, or one or more types of alcohols, in the presence of oxygen, wherein a high<br>
level of reactivity is maintained by using as main catalyst components stable metal<br>
elements having superior reactivity instead of conventional expensive noble metals,<br>
to provide a process for producing the catalyst, and to provide a process for<br>
producing carboxylic acid esters using the catalyst.<br>

problems, the inventors of the present invention found that the above problems can<br>
be solved by a catalyst for producing carboxylic acid ester in which oxidized nickel<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The following provides a detailed explanation of the best mode for carrying out<br>
the present invention (referred to as "the present embodiment"). Furthermore, the<br>
present invention is not limited to the following embodiments, but rather can be<br>
carried out by altering in various ways within the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
The catalyst for use in production of carboxylic acid ester according to the<br>
present embodiment is a catalyst for use in production of carboxylic acid ester by<br>
reacting (a) aldehyde and alcohol, or (b) one or more types of alcohols, in the<br>
presence of oxygen, wherein oxidized nickel and X (wherein X represents at least<br>
one element selected from the group consisting of nickel, palladium, platinum,<br>
ruthenium, gold, silver and copper) are loaded onto a support within a range of an<br>
atomic ratio of Ni / (Ni + X) of from 0.20 to 0.99.<br><br>
The catalyst for use in production of carboxylic acid ester according to the<br>
present embodiment preferably further comprises composite nanoparticles composed<br>
of oxidized nickel and X (wherein X represents at least one element selected from the<br>
group consisting of nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, gold, silver and copper).<br><br>
The oxidized nickel is preferably a nickel oxide formed by bonding nickel and<br>
oxygen (such as Ni2O, NiO, NiO2, Ni3O4 or Ni2O3), or a composite oxide containing<br>
nickel, such as a nickel oxide compound, solid solution or mixture thereof, formed by<br>
bonding nickel and X and/or one or more types of another metal element and oxygen.<br><br>
The term "nickel oxide" used herein refers to a compound containing nickel and<br><br>
oxygen. The nickel oxide includes Ni2O, NiO, NiO2, Ni3O4 or Ni2O3, or hydrates of<br>
the foregoing, hydroperoxides of nickel containing a OOH group or peroxides of<br>
nickel containing a O2 group, or a mixture of the foregoing, and the like.<br><br>
In addition, the term "composite oxide" used herein refers to an oxide<br>
containing two or more types of metals. The term "composite oxide", refers to an<br>
oxide in which two or more types of metal oxides form a compound, and although this<br>
includes double oxides in which ions of oxoacids are not present as structural units<br>
(such as perovskite-oxides or spinel-type oxides of nickel), it also includes all oxides<br>
in a broader sense than double oxides in which two or more types of metals are<br>
compounded. Oxides in which two or more types of metal oxides form a solid<br>
solution also fall within the scope of compound oxides.<br>
The following provides an explanation of the action by which extremely high<br>
catalyst performance is demonstrated by loading oxidized nickel and X (wherein X<br>
represents at least one element selected from the group consisting of nickel,<br>
palladium, platinum, ruthenium, gold, silver and copper) onto a support within a range<br>
of an atomic ratio of Ni / (Ni + X) of from 0.20 to 0.99.<br><br>
The inventors of the present invention found that the inherent catalyst activity of<br>
nickel oxides having oxidative esterification activity is achieved by compounding the<br>
nickel oxide and X, and that remarkably high catalyst performance is demonstrated<br>
that is not demonstrated with catalysts composed of each individual component.<br>
This is attributable to a unique effect demonstrated as a result of compounding the<br>
nickel oxide and X, and is thought to be the result of the creation of a novel catalytic<br>
action that is completely different from that of catalysts consisting of each individual<br>
component due to, for example, the formation of a binary functional catalyst or a<br><br>
novel active species between both metal components. On the basis of this novel<br>
concept, in the case of loading the oxidized nickel and X onto the support in a highly<br>
dispersed state, revolutionary catalyst performance in particular was able to be<br>
realized unlike that obtained with catalysts of the prior art.<br><br>
In recent years, nanoparticles, which have attracted considerable attention due<br>
to advances made in ultrafine particle synthesis technology, are recognized to be a<br>
basic material in the field of nanotechnology, and research thereon is progressing<br>
around the world. Nanoparticles having a particle diameter of 100 nm or less differ<br>
from bulk particles in that they have a high proportion of surface metal element<br>
among the metal elements that constitute the nanoparticles, thus resulting in the<br>
surface area of the metal element per unit mass increasing rapidly the smaller the<br>
particle size. Examples of nanoparticles known in the field of catalyst materials may<br>
include metal nanoparticles such as those of platinum, palladium, ruthenium, rhodium,<br>
gold, silver and copper, or metal oxide nanoparticles such as those of iron oxide,<br>
cobalt oxide, nickel oxide, zinc oxide, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, indium oxide,<br>
alumina and silica, and these nanoparticles are attracting attention as heterogeneous<br>
catalyst materials. Namely, one reason for the growing attention being placed on<br>
the application of nanoparticles to catalyst materials is that, since that which<br>
contributes to the catalytic action is limited to the metal element present on the<br>
surface thereof, when applied on the nano level, the surface area per unit mass of<br>
the metal element involved in a reaction (specific surface area) increases, thereby<br>
improving the catalyst activity per metal element mass. Changes in catalytic action<br>
attributable to the particle size of nanoparticles in this manner are widely known in<br>
the form of "particle size effects".<br><br><br>
On the other hand, there are also cases in which new effects are demonstrated<br>
in addition to these particle size effects. For example, the action of binary metal<br>
nanoparticles are known to be one of the factors having a significant effect on the<br>
catalytic action of nanoparticles. This action refers to an effect that is unable to be<br>
demonstrated by single metal species, and is only demonstrated as a result of<br>
compounding. Alloys as referred to in the prior art are a known example of this<br>
(binary metal nanoparticles refer not only to the case of the element species being a<br>
metal, but also includes cases in which metal compounds or metals and metal<br>
compounds are combined). Although particle size and shape are mainly the<br>
parameters to be controlled in the case of nanoparticles consisting of a single<br>
element, in the case nanoparticles are composed of two or more types of element<br>
species, additional control parameters include composition, crystal structure and<br>
phase structure (such as the alloy or solid solution structure in which crystal sites are<br>
randomly occupied by chemical species, core-shell structure in which each chemical<br>
species is separated in the form of concentric spheres, anisotropic phase structure in<br>
which phases are separated anisotropically, and heterobondphilic structure, in which<br>
both chemical species are present adjacent to each other on the surface of particles).<br>
Namely, as a result of employing a binary compound structure, changes in mass of<br>
the metal species occur resulting in the demonstration of chemical and electronic<br>
properties that are clearly different from single nanoparticles. Thus, binary metal<br>
nanoparticles were found to demonstrate novel catalytic, magnetic and optical<br>
properties not found in nanoparticles composed of single metal element species, and<br>
their applications are being developed in various fields such as electronic materials,<br>
medicine and biotechnology in addition to catalysts.<br><br>
The inventors of the present conducted a wide-ranging search for materials for<br><br>
the purpose of developing catalysts having high carboxylic acid ester selectivity and<br>
activity while also having for the main component thereof an inexpensive metal<br>
element having superior reactivity to take the place of expensive noble metals of the<br>
prior art. Attention was focused on nickel as an element having properties that<br>
resemble those of noble metals, and extensive research was conducted on the<br>
correlation between chemical state and reactivity thereof, thereby leading to<br>
completion of the present invention. Namely, as was previously described, the<br>
catalyst of the present embodiment has oxidized nickel and X as a binary<br>
metallochemical species (wherein X represents at least one element selected from<br>
the group consisting of nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, gold, silver and<br>
copper) loaded onto a support within a range of an atomic ratio of from Ni / (Ni + X) of<br>
0.20 to 0.99. The catalyst of the present embodiment preferably further comprises<br>
nanoparticles composed of the oxidized nickel and X (wherein X represents at least<br>
one element selected from the group consisting of nickel, palladium, platinum,<br>
ruthenium, gold, silver and copper). The following provides a more detailed<br>
explanation thereof.<br>
When the inventors of the present invention used nickel oxides, currently<br>
attracting attention as an alcohol oxidation catalyst, as a catalyst, it was found for the<br>
first time that despite a low level of activity, even nickel oxide (NiO) alone<br>
demonstrated carboxylic acid ester formation activity. Moreover, as a result of<br>
conducting additional research, the inventors of the present invention clearly<br>
demonstrated that highly oxidized nickel peroxide (NiO2) demonstrates higher<br>
performance than that of nickel oxide. On the other hand, activity was not observed<br>
in the case of using nickel metal (Ni) alone.<br><br><br>
On the basis of these findings, the possibility was suggested that an<br>
inexpensive metal element, nickel, can be used as the main component of a catalyst.<br>
Next, the inventors of the present invention examined the addition of various metal<br>
elements to nickel oxide by changing the oxidized state of nickel based on the<br>
approach of further increasing catalyst performance by controlling the oxidized state<br>
of nickel and loading an active component onto a support in a highly dispersed state.<br>
As a result, the inventors of the present invention found that by loading oxidized<br>
nickel and at least one metal component selected from the group consisting of nickel,<br>
palladium, platinum, ruthenium, gold, silver and copper onto a support in a highly<br>
dispersed state within a range of an atomic ratio of Ni / (Ni + X) of from 0.20 to 0.99,<br>
the nickel oxide is converted from a normal oxidized state to a highly oxidized nickel<br>
oxide, thereby dramatically improving activity and selectivity as compared with<br>
catalysts composed of each element alone or catalysts in which the atomic ratio of Ni<br>
/ (Ni + X) is outside the above range.<br><br>
For example, when gold is selected for X and nickel oxide and gold are loaded<br>
onto a support in a highly dispersed state, remarkably high catalyst activity is<br>
demonstrated. This catalyst was observed to demonstrate higher carboxylic acid<br>
ester selectivity as compared with catalysts in which nickel oxide or gold is loaded<br>
onto a support alone, and a considerable improvement in activity was observed for a<br>
specific composition ratio of Ni / (Ni + Au). With respect to the catalyst activity per<br>
metal atom, the carboxylic acid ester formation activity of (Ni + Au) demonstrates<br>
higher activity than catalysts composed of each component alone, and catalyst<br>
function attributable to compounding thereof is greatly dependent on the loaded<br>
composition of the nickel and gold. This is presumed to be due to being present at<br>
a ratio optimum for formation of a nickel oxidized state optimal for the reaction. In<br><br>
this manner, as a result of the two components of nickel oxide and gold being loaded<br>
while dispersed on a support, remarkable compounding effects were demonstrated<br>
that were unable to be predicted from simply adding the effects produced by each<br>
component alone.<br><br>
In the above catalyst, oxidized nickel and gold are loaded onto a support in a<br>
highly dispersed state, and both components are compounded at the nano level.<br>
Based on the results of observations with a transmission electron microscope /<br>
scanning transmission electron microscope (TEM / STEM), nearly spherical<br>
nanoparticles having a particle diameter distribution of from 2 to 3 nm were loaded<br>
uniformly dispersed on the support. Based on an elementary analysis of the<br>
nanoparticles by energy dispersed X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), both nickel and gold<br>
are present in all of the particles, and were observed to be in the form of nickel<br>
coated on the surface of gold nanoparticles. In addition, nickel component alone<br>
was observed to be loaded on the support in addition to the nanoparticles containing<br>
nickel and gold.<br><br>
According to the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and powder<br>
X-ray diffraction (powder XRD), although the gold is present in the form of crystalline<br>
metal, the nickel is presumed to be present in the form of an amorphous oxide having<br>
a valence of 2.<br><br>
On the basis of ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) capable of observing<br>
changes in electron excitation states, compound of the oxidized nickel oxide and gold<br>
was determined to cause disappearance of a surface plasmon absorption peak (at<br>
about 530 nm) originating from gold nanoparticles observed in gold nanoparticles<br>
composed of a single gold species. The disappearance of this surface plasmon<br><br>
absorption peak was not observed in combinations of gold and metal oxide species<br>
other than nickel oxide, for instance, chromium oxide, manganese oxide, iron oxide,<br>
cobalt oxide, copper oxide or zinc oxide, which combinations are observed to have<br>
no effect on the reaction. The disappearance of this surface plasmon absorption<br>
peak is thought to be the result of mixing electron states through the contact interface<br>
between the oxidized nickel and gold, or in other words, due to hybridization of two<br>
types of metallochemical species.<br>
Conversion to highly oxidized nickel oxide can be observed by a color change<br>
in the catalyst and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis). As a result of adding<br>
gold to nickel oxide, the nickel oxide changed from grayish-green to brown, and the<br>
UV spectrum demonstrated absorbance throughout nearly the entire visible range.<br>
The shape and color of the UV spectrum resembled that of highly oxidized nickel<br>
peroxide (NiO2) measured as a reference sample. On the basis of this finding,<br>
nickel oxide is presumed to be converted to highly oxidized nickel oxide by addition<br>
of gold.<br><br>
On the basis of these results, the structure of composite nanoparticles is<br>
thought to be such that gold nanoparticles are located at the core and the surface of<br>
the gold nanoparticles is covered with highly oxidized nickel oxide, and gold atoms<br>
are not present on the surface of the composite nanoparticles.<br><br>
[Presumed Principle of Action]<br>
Next, an explanation is provided of the presumed principle of the action of the<br>
catalysts according to the present embodiment by using the example of modification<br>
and improvement of nickel compounds on which research has been conducted for<br>
use as catalysts and electronic materials.<br><br><br>
Examples of the application of heterogeneous nickel compounds to oxidation<br>
reactions of the prior art may include (1) an alcohol oxidation process using nickel<br>
peroxide (NiO2) as a stoichiometric oxidizing agent (J. Org. Chem. 27 (1962) 1597),<br>
(2) an oxygen-based alcohol oxidation reaction using Ni-AI hydrotalcite as a catalyst<br>
(Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 40 (2001) 763), (3) an oxygen-based alcohol oxidation<br>
reaction using Mg-AI hydrotalcite containing Ni(ll) as a catalyst (J. Mol. Catal. A 236<br>
(2005) 206), (4) an oxygen-based alcohol oxidation reaction using nanoparticles of<br>
nickel peroxide (NiO2) as a catalyst (Appl. Catal. A 290 (2005) 25) and the like.<br><br>
Although highly oxidized nickel peroxide has a higher oxidation power than<br>
ordinary nickel oxide, and has long been known to be able to oxidize various alcohols<br>
stoichiometrically, as a result of the various modifications and improvements to nickel<br>
catalysts in recent years, catalytic oxidation reactions of alcohol with molecular<br>
oxygen have been realized. Nickel-hydrotalcite-based catalysts enable nickel to<br>
function as an oxygen activation sites by compounding nickel and dissimilar metal<br>
element (such as Al or Mg), and is thought to result in the formation of peroxo<br>
species serving as a reactive species on the nickel. In addition, in processes using<br>
nanoparticles of nickel peroxide, reactions have been reported to proceed<br>
catalytically as a result of forming the nickel peroxide into nanoparticles.<br><br>
Nickel oxide is used as an electrochromic material, for example, in the field of<br>
electronic materials other than catalysts. In order to enhance the photoabsorption<br>
response rate of nickel oxide films, research has been conducted on (5) a compound<br>
film of NiO-Me (wherein, Me represents Au, Ag, Cu, Ni, Pd or Pt) in which metal (Me)<br>
is doped with nickel oxide (J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 36 (2003) 2386). Metals doped<br>
with nickel oxide act as holes, and the oxidation coloring rate is thought to be<br><br>
improved when nickel oxide is converted to a highly oxidized nickel oxide.<br>
Such application examples of nickel compounds give important suggestions in<br>
terms of understanding the expression of catalyst function demonstrated by the<br>
catalyst of the present embodiment. Although the inventors of the present invention<br>
found that nickel peroxide demonstrates activity in carboxylic acid ester synthesis<br>
reactions, the level of the catalyst activity was low. Pure nickel peroxide and<br>
anhydrides thereof have yet to be obtained, there are many aspects of its structure<br>
that remain unclear, and it is also considered to be a form of nickel oxide (divalent)<br>
that has adsorbed oxygen. However, since nickel peroxide is extremely useful as a<br>
stoichiometric oxidizing agent, if it were possible to generate a catalytically active<br>
oxidizing active species by using molecular oxygen for the oxidizing agent, nickel<br>
peroxide could be applied to oxidation of organic substrates with molecular oxygen.<br>
Pioneering research in this field is described in (2) above, with this research resulting<br>
in achieving for the first time in the world oxygen oxidation by heterogeneous nickel<br>
catalyst as a result of realizing highly efficient activation of molecular oxygen by<br>
compounding nickel and a dissimilar metal element. In addition, as described in (4)<br>
above, a report indicating that nickel peroxide functions as a catalyst by converting to<br>
nanoparticles indicates the importance of control of geometrical structure in terms of<br>
expressing a catalyst active species.<br>
In addition, examples of a method for controlling the oxidized state of nickel<br>
oxide used as an electrochromic material may include the combining of a group 8<br>
metal and a group 1B metal as indicated in (5) above, thereby improving the<br>
conversion rate to highly oxidized nickel oxide. This suggests that in catalytic<br>
reactions as well, controlling the electronic state of oxidized nickel is possible by<br><br>
compounding with a specific metal, and this applies to the basic concept of the<br>
catalyst of the present embodiment as well.<br><br>
As has been previously described, the structure of the composite nanoparticles<br>
of the present embodiment is presumed to comprises X particles serving as the core<br>
with highly oxidized nickel oxide covering the surface thereof. Based on (1) to (5)<br>
above, in the composite nanoparticles of the present embodiment, since the oxidized<br>
nickel and X interact at the atomic level, the electronic state of the nickel oxide is<br>
converted to a highly oxidized state, and changes in the geometrical structure of<br>
active sites thereof as well as changes in electronic properties can be considered to<br>
be reflected in its catalytic action. In addition, it is predicted that a novel active<br>
species mediated by oxygen atoms is formed at the contact interface between the<br>
nickel oxide and X, and this is thought to result in the creation of a novel catalyst<br>
function completely different from that in the case of using either component alone.<br><br>
Namely, the catalyst for use in production of carboxylic acid ester according to<br>
the present embodiment is clearly different from conventional metal catalysts<br>
composed of a single metal species, binary metal catalysts such as alloys or<br>
intermetallic compounds, and binary catalysts composed of combinations of metal<br>
oxides other than nickel and metal elements, and the state change in active sites<br>
specifically expressed due to compounding of oxidized nickel and X are presumed to<br>
result in revolutionary catalyst performance unable to be obtained with catalysts of<br>
the prior art.<br>
[Details of Catalyst for Use in Production of Carboxylic Acid Ester]<br>
The catalyst for use in production of carboxylic acid ester according to the<br>
present embodiment is a catalyst in which oxidized nickel and X (wherein X<br><br>
represents at least one element selected from the group consisting of nickel,<br>
palladium, platinum, ruthenium, gold, silver and copper) are loaded onto a support<br>
within a range of an atomic ratio of Ni / (Ni + X) of from 0.20 to 0.99.<br><br>
The catalyst according to the present embodiment preferably further comprises<br>
composite nanoparticles composed of oxidized nickel and X (wherein X represents at<br>
least one element selected from the group consisting of nickel, palladium, platinum,<br>
ruthenium, gold, silver and copper).<br><br>
The oxidized nickel and X are preferably loaded onto the support in a highly<br>
dispersed state. The oxidized nickel and X are more preferably loaded while<br>
dispersed in the form of fine particles or a thin film, and the average particle diameter<br>
of each is preferably from 2 to 15 nm, more preferably from 2 to 10 nm, and even<br>
more preferably from 2 to 6 nm. Herein, the average particle diameter as referred to<br>
in the present embodiment refers to the number average particle diameter as<br>
measured with a transmission electron microscope (TEM).<br>
The loaded composition of the nickel and X is such that the atomic ratio of Ni /<br>
(Ni + X) is within a range of from 0.20 to 0.99, preferably within a range of from 0.30<br>
to 0.90 and more preferably within a range of from 0.50 to 0.90. The atomic ratio of<br>
Ni / (Ni + X) as referred to herein is the ratio of the number of nickel atoms loaded<br>
onto the support to the total number of nickel and X atoms. If the atomic ratio of Ni /<br>
(Ni + X) is within the above ranges, a specific active species structure composed of<br>
nickel and X and a nickel oxidized state suitable for the reaction are formed, and as a<br>
result thereof, activity and selectivity tend to be higher than catalysts in which the<br>
atomic ratio is outside these ranges.<br><br><br>
In the case composite nanoparticles composed of oxidized nickel and X are<br>
contained in a catalyst, that catalyst is not limited to that in which nanoparticles are<br>
only loaded onto a support, but rather catalysts are also included in which oxidized<br>
nickel alone is loaded onto the support in addition to the composite nanoparticles.<br><br>
The composite nanoparticle refers to a nanoparticle containing oxidized nickel<br>
and X (wherein X represents at least one element selected from the group consisting<br>
of nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, gold, silver and copper).<br><br>
Although there are no particular limitations on the form of the composite<br>
nanoparticles provided both components are contained therein, preferably both<br>
components are present in the nanoparticles, and the form preferably adopts a phase<br>
structure such as a solid solution structure in which crystal sites are randomly<br>
occupied by chemical species, a core-shell structure in which each chemical species<br>
is separated in the form of concentric spheres, an anisotropic phase structure in<br>
which phases are separated anisotropically, and a heterobondphilic structure, in<br>
which both chemical species are present adjacent to each other on the surface of<br>
particles. More preferably, X serves as a core, and oxidized nickel is coated on the<br>
surface thereof. There are no particular limitations on the shape of the composite<br>
nanoparticles provided both components are contained therein, and may have any<br>
shape such as spheres or hemispheres.<br><br>
The composition of nickel and X in the composite nanoparticles is such that the<br>
atomic ratio of Ni / X is preferably within a range of from 0.1 to 10, more preferably<br>
within a range of from 0.2 to 5.0 and even more preferably within a range of from 0.3<br>
to 3.0.<br><br>
The range of the average particle diameter of the composite nanoparticles is<br>
preferably from 2 to 15 nm, more preferably from 2 to 10 nm and even more<br>
preferably from 2 to 6 nm.<br><br>
In the case the composite nanoparticles are in the form of having X at the core<br>
and having oxidized nickel covering the surface thereof, the average particle<br>
diameter of X is preferably within a range of from 1.5 to 12 nm, more preferably<br>
within a range of from 2 to 10 nm and even more preferably within a range of from 2<br>
to 6 nm in consideration of the balance between expression of activity and stability.<br>
The thickness of the surface nickel layer consisting of one or more layers of oxidized<br>
nickel molecules, and changes according to such factors as the loaded composition<br>
of nickel and X, the atomic ratio and particle diameter of nickel and X in the<br>
composite nanoparticles, and the manner in which the catalyst is prepared. The<br>
thickness of the nickel layer in terms of oxidized nickel molecules is preferably about<br>
from 1 to 5 layers, and more preferably about from 1 to 3 layers. In addition, a<br>
composite oxide may be formed within the composite nanoparticles that have<br>
emically bonded species such as Ni-O-X at the interface where both nickel and X<br>
components are in contact.<br>
The reason for there being preferable ranges for the loaded composition of<br>
nickel and X and the atomic ratio of nickel and X in the composite nanoparticles, and<br>
the reason for allowing a margin, are that the proportion of surface atoms differs<br>
according to the particle diameter of X. For example, in citing the example of gold,<br>
at a gold particle diameter of 10 nm, the total number of atoms formed becomes<br>
about 2.1 x 104, and the proportion of the number of surface atoms becomes about<br>
15%. If the particle diameter is 2 nm, the total number of atoms formed becomes<br><br>
about 150, and the proportion of the number of surface atoms becomes 63%. Thus,<br>
in the case of considering a form in which the surface of X is covered with nickel, it<br>
can be easily surmised that the atomic ratio of nickel and X differs depending on the<br>
particle diameter of X.<br><br>
As previously described, a transmission electron microscope / scanning<br>
transmission electron microscope (TEM / STEM) is an effective analytical method for<br>
observing the morphology of the composite nanoparticles, and irradiating images of<br>
nanoparticles observed by TEM / STEM with an electron beam makes it possible to<br>
analyze elements within the nanoparticles and extract an image of the distribution of<br>
those elements. As will be indicated in the examples to be described later, the<br>
composite nanoparticles according to the present embodiment were confirmed to<br>
have a form in which nickel and X are contained in all of the particles and the surface<br>
of X is covered with nickel. In the case of adopting such a form, the atomic ratio of<br>
nickel and X differs according to the location of the composition analysis site in the<br>
nanoparticles, and larger amounts of nickel are detected on the edge of the particles<br>
than at the center of the particles. Thus, a margin is allotted for the atomic ratio of<br>
nickel and X depending on the location of the analysis site even for individual<br>
nanoparticles, and the range of that margin is included in the ranges of the atomic<br>
ratio of Ni / X as previously described.<br><br>
In the case of having selected gold, silver or copper for X, ultraviolet-visible<br>
spectroscopy (UV-Vis) is an effective means of identifying the structure thereof. In<br>
the case of nanoparticles containing gold, silver or copper only, the photoelectric field<br>
of the visible-near infrared band couples with the surface free electrons of the metal<br>
resulting in surface plasmon absorption. For example, when a catalyst loaded with<br><br>
gold nanoparticles is irradiated with visible light, an absorption spectrum is observed<br>
based on plasmon resonance originating from the gold nanoparticles at a wavelength<br>
of about 530 nm. However, in the case of a catalyst loaded with nickel oxide and<br>
gold according to the present embodiment, the surface plasmon absorption thereof<br>
disappears, thereby suggesting the absence of gold on the surface of the catalyst<br>
according to the present embodiment.<br><br>
Preferable examples of the oxidized nickel may include nickel oxides formed by<br>
bonding nickel and oxygen (such as Ni2O, NiO, NiO2, Ni3O4 or Ni2O3), and composite<br>
oxides containing nickel, such as a nickel oxide compounds, solid solutions or<br>
mixture thereof, formed by bonding nickel and X and / or one or more types of other<br>
metal elements and oxygen.<br><br>
There are no particular limitations on the solid form of nickel provided it allows<br>
the obtaining of the prescribed catalyst activity, and is preferably in an amorphous<br>
state in which diffraction peaks are not observed by X-ray diffraction. As a result of<br>
employing such a form, since interaction with oxygen is presumed to be greater and<br>
the bonding interface between the oxidized nickel and X increases, even better<br>
catalyst activity tends to be obtained.<br><br>
X represents at least one element selected from the group consisting of nickel,<br>
palladium, platinum, ruthenium, gold, silver and copper, and represents more<br>
preferably selected from the group consisting of nickel, palladium, ruthenium, gold<br>
and silver.<br><br>
Although the chemical state of X may be a metal, oxide, hydroxide, composite<br>
compound containing X and nickel or one or more types of other metal elements, or<br><br>
any mixture thereof, the preferable chemical state is a metal or oxide, and more<br>
preferably a metal. In addition, there are no particular limitations on the solid form of<br>
X provided it allows the obtaining of the prescribed catalyst activity, and may be<br>
crystalline or amorphous.<br><br>
Another metal element as referred to herein indicates a constituent element of<br>
the support to be described later, a third constituent element contained in the catalyst<br>
in addition to the oxidized nickel and X, or a metal component such as an alkaline<br>
metal, alkaline earth metal or rare earth metal.<br>
The catalyst according to the present embodiment has oxidized nickel and X<br>
loaded onto a support as previously described, and preferably demonstrates superior<br>
effects by forming composite nanoparticles composed of oxidized nickel and X.<br>
Furthermore, the composite nanoparticle as referred to in the present embodiment<br>
refers to a particle on the nano level containing different binary metal species within a<br>
single particle. Although examples of different binary metal species may include<br>
binary metal particles in which both the nickel and X components are metals, and<br>
metal particles in which an alloy or intermetallic compound of nickel and X is formed,<br>
in the case of using these as catalysts for producing carboxylic acid ester, selectivity<br>
and catalyst activity of the target product are low as compared with the catalyst<br>
according to the present invention, thereby making them undesirable.<br><br>
The catalyst according to the present embodiment preferably comprises<br>
oxidized nickel on the support independently in addition to the composite<br>
nanoparticles composed of oxidized nickel and X. The presence of oxidized nickel<br>
not compounded with X serves to further enhance the structural stability of the<br>
catalyst particles, as well as inhibit increases in pore diameter caused by long-term<br><br>
reactions and the accompanying growth of the composite nanoparticles. This effect<br>
is remarkable in the case of using an aluminum-containing silica-based composition<br>
containing silica and aluminum or a silica-alumina-magnesia composition for the<br>
support as will be described later.<br>
The following provides an explanation of the action by which structural stability<br>
of catalyst particles is enhanced and increases in pore diameter caused by long-term<br>
reactions along with accompanying growth of composite nanoparticles are inhibited<br>
due to the presence of free oxidized nickel on the support.<br><br>
As will be described later, the production of acetals and the like attributable to<br>
acidic substances, represented by by-products characteristic to reactions for<br>
producing carboxylic acid esters, methacrylic acid or acrylic acid, can be inhibited by<br>
maintaining the pH of the reaction system to 6 to 9, and more preferably to neutral<br>
conditions (such as pH 6.5 to 7.5), or in other words by maintaining at a pH as close<br>
to pH 7 as possible, by adding a compound of an alkaline metal or alkaline earth<br>
metal to the reaction system.<br><br>
According to studies conducted by the inventors of the present invention, in the<br>
case of carrying out a long-term reaction according to the procedure described above<br>
using a catalyst in which single component gold nanoparticles are loaded onto a<br>
support of the present embodiment, the catalyst particles were determined to<br>
gradually undergo structural changes. This phenomenon is thought to be the result<br>
of the catalyst particles repeatedly being locally exposed to acid and base due to the<br>
reaction procedure described above, thereby causing a portion of the Al in the<br>
support to be dissolved and precipitate resulting in rearrangement of the<br>
silica-alumina crosslinked structure, which in turn causes an increase in the pore<br><br>
diameter of the catalyst particles. In addition, simultaneous to the increase in pore<br>
diameter, particle growth is promoted by sintering of the gold particles, which was<br>
determined to lower catalyst activity.<br><br>
On the other hand, the presence of composite nanoparticles and oxidized nickel<br>
alone on the support served to enhance the structural stability of the catalyst particles<br>
due to the procedure described above, while also inhibiting increases in pore<br>
diameter and growth of the composite nanoparticles. As was previously described,<br>
the reason for this is thought to be that the reaction between oxidized nickel and<br>
constituent elements of the support results in the formation of nickel oxide<br>
compounds or composite oxides containing nickel such as solution solutions, and as<br>
a result of such nickel compounds acting to stabilize the silica-alumina crosslinked<br>
structure, structural stability of the catalyst particles is greatly improved. The<br>
performance of such catalyst structural stabilizing effects is presumed by the<br>
inventors of the present invention to be attributable to the oxidized nickel present in<br>
the support. Consequently, these effects are naturally obtained in the case oxidized<br>
nickel contained in the composite nanoparticles is in contact with the support, and<br>
maximum stabilizing effects are thought to be obtained if free oxidized nickel is<br>
present on the support.<br><br>
[Support]<br>
There are no particular limitations on the support of the catalyst for producing<br>
carboxylic acid ester according to the present embodiment provided it is capable of<br>
being loaded with oxidized nickel and X, and a catalyst support of the prior art used<br>
for carboxylic acid ester synthesis can be used.<br><br>
Examples of this support may include various types of supports such as<br><br>
activated carbon, silica, alumina, silica-alumina, titania, silica-titania, zirconia,<br>
magnesia, silica-magnesia, silica-alumina-magnesia, calcium carbonate, zinc oxide,<br>
zeolite and crystalline metallosilicate. Preferable examples thereof may include<br>
activated carbon, silica, alumina, silica-alumina, silica-magnesia,<br>
silica-alumina-magnesia, titania, silica-titania and zirconia. More preferable<br>
examples may include silica-alumina and silica-alumina-magnesia.<br><br>
In addition, a single or plurality of types of metal components selected from the<br>
group consisting of alkaline metals (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs), alkaline earth metals (Be, Mg,<br>
Ca, Sr, Ba) and rare earth metals (La, Ce, Pr) may also be contained in the support.<br>
A loaded metal component is preferably an oxide obtained by firing, for example, a<br>
nitrate or acetate.<br><br>
An aluminum-containing silica-based composition comprising silica and<br>
aluminum or a silica-alumina-magnesia composition is preferably used for the<br>
support. This type of support has higher water resistance than silica and higher acid<br>
resistance than alumina. In addition, it is also provided with superior physical<br>
properties as compared with supports typically used in the prior art, including being<br>
harder and having greater mechanical strength than activated carbon, while also<br>
allowing the stable loading of oxidized nickel and X which are catalyst active<br>
components (wherein X represents at least one element selected from the group<br>
consisting of nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, gold, silver and copper).<br>
Consequently, the catalyst is able to maintain a high level of reactivity over a long<br>
period of time.<br><br>
A catalyst for producing carboxylic acid ester, in which oxidized nickel and X<br>
have a specific atomic ratio, and an aluminum-containing silica-based composition or<br><br>
silica-alumina-magnesia composition is used for the support, demonstrates high<br>
mechanical strength and physical stability while having a high surface area suitable<br>
for use as a catalyst support, and also satisfies corrosion resistance with respect to<br>
the characteristic liquid nature of the reaction in the form of a carboxylic acid ester<br>
synthesis reaction in the presence of oxygen.<br><br>
The following provides an explanation of the properties of the support of the<br>
present embodiment that enables considerable improvement of catalyst life. The<br>
reason for having been able to significantly improve the mechanical strength and<br>
chemical stability of the support is presumed to be as follows.<br><br>
In an aluminum-containing silica-based support, Si-O-AI-O-Si bonds are newly<br>
formed by adding aluminum (Al) to non-crosslinked silica (Si-O) chains of silica gel.<br>
Since Al-crosslinked structures are formed without losing the inherent stability of Si-0<br>
chains with respect to acidic substances, Si-0 bonds are strengthened and<br>
hydrolysis stability (hereinafter simply referred to as "water resistance") is thought to<br>
be significantly improved. In addition, when Si-O-AI-O-Si crosslinked structures are<br>
formed, the number of non-crosslinked Si-0 chains decreases as compared with<br>
silica gel alone, which is thought to result in an increase in mechanical strength as<br>
well. Namely, the amount of Si-O-AI-O-Si structures formed is presumed to<br>
correlate with improvement of mechanical strength and water resistance of the<br>
resulting silica gel.<br><br>
In a silica-aluminum-magnesia support, as a result of magnesia being present<br>
in addition to silica and alumina, charge stabilization is promoted as a result of<br>
compensatory neutralization by Mg (divalent) of differences in charge resulting from<br>
differences in the valences between Si (tetravalent) and Al (trivalent) caused by the<br><br>
formation of Si-O-AI-O-Si crosslinked structures. Moreover, since charge balance is<br>
obtained through the use of a three-component system, structural stability is<br>
presumed to be further enhanced. Consequently, in contrast to a silica-alumina<br>
support alone demonstrating acidity, a support containing silica, alumina and<br>
magnesia is nearly neutral, and this is thought to lead to inhibition of prominent acetal<br>
formation under acidic conditions.<br><br>
One reason for it being possible to stably load oxidized nickel and X onto a<br>
support for a long period of time is that the mechanical strength and chemical stability<br>
of the support are significantly improved as described above, thus providing the<br>
support with superior physical properties in comparison with supports typically used<br>
in the prior art. As a result, nickel and X which are the catalyst active components<br>
are resistant to exfoliation, thus enabling them to be stably loaded over a long period<br>
of time.<br><br>
The nickel component of commonly used supports, such as silica or<br>
silica-alumina, has been observed to gradually elute over the course of long-term<br>
reactions. In contrast, in the case of using the above-mentioned support, the<br>
inventors of the present invention found that elution of nickel component is inhibited<br>
over a long period of time. On the basis of the results of X-ray photoelectron<br>
spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM/EDX) and high-<br>
resolution X-ray fluorescence (HRXRF), in the case of using a silica or silica-titania<br>
support, the eluting nickel component was confirmed to be nickel oxide present alone<br>
on the support. Since nickel oxide is a soluble compound in acid, it is presumed to<br>
be eluted by characteristic by-products of this reaction in the form of acidic<br>
substances represented by methacrylic acid and acrylic acid.<br><br><br>
On the basis of analysis of the chemical state of nickel by high-resolution X-ray<br>
fluorescence (HRXRF), the nickel of the catalyst according to the present<br>
embodiment is presumed to not only be nickel oxide which is a single compound, but<br>
also be present due to the formation of composite oxides containing nickel, such as a<br>
nickel oxide compounds, solid solutions or mixture thereof, formed by bonding<br>
between nickel and a constituent element of the support.<br><br>
High-resolution X-ray fluorescence (HRXRF) analysis makes it possible to<br>
analyze chemical state based on energy locations (chemical shifts) and the shape of<br>
the resulting spectrum due to its extremely high energy resolution. In the case of<br>
the K spectra of 3d transition metal elements in particular, changes occur in chemical<br>
shift and shape due to changes in valence and electronic state, and the chemical<br>
state can be analyzed in detail. In the catalyst according to the present embodiment,<br>
changes occurred in the Ni K spectrum, thus confirming that the chemical state of<br>
nickel differs from nickel oxide which is a single compound.<br><br>
For example, nickel aluminate, which is formed from nickel oxide and alumina,<br>
is a compound that is insoluble in acid. As a result of forming such a nickel<br>
compound on a support, elution of the nickel component is presumed to be improved<br>
considerably.<br><br>
The following provides an explanation of two preferable supports for<br>
significantly improving the life of the catalyst according to the present embodiment,<br>
namely a support containing silica and alumina and a silica-alumina-magnesia<br>
support.<br>
The elementary composition of a support containing silica and alumina is such<br><br>
that the amount of aluminum is from 1 to 30 mol%, preferably from 5 to 30 mol% and<br>
more preferably from 5 to 25 mol% based on the total molar amount of silicon and<br>
aluminum. If the amount of aluminum is within this range, acid resistance and<br>
mechanical strength tend to be favorable.<br><br>
In addition, the further containing of at least one type of basic metal component<br>
selected from the group consisting of alkaline metals, alkaline earth metals and rare<br>
earth metals in the support of the catalyst according to the present embodiment in<br>
addition to silica and alumina is preferable from the viewpoint of further improving<br>
mechanical strength and chemical stability. Examples of alkaline metals of this<br>
basic metal component may include Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs, examples of alkaline earth<br>
metals may include Be, Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba, and examples of rare earth metals may<br>
include La, Ce and Pr.<br><br>
The elementary composition of a support containing silica, alumina and at least<br>
one type of basic metal component selected from the group consisting of alkaline<br>
metals, alkaline earth metals and rare earth metals is such that the amount of<br>
aluminum is within a range of from 1 to 30 mol%, preferably from 5 to 30 mol% and<br>
more preferably from 5 to 25 mol% based on the total molar amount of silicon and<br>
aluminum. In addition, the composition ratio of the basic metal component and<br>
alumina in terms of the atomic ratio of (alkaline metal + 1/2 x alkaline earth metal +<br>
1/3 x rare earth metal) / Al is preferably within a range of from 0.5 to 10, more<br>
preferably from 0.5 to 5.0 and even more preferably from 0.5 to 2.0. If the<br>
elementary composition of silica, alumina and basic metal component is within the<br>
above range, the silicon, aluminum and basic metal element form a specific stable<br>
bonded structure, and as a result, the mechanical strength and water resistance of<br><br>
the support tend to be favorable.<br><br>
Moreover, a support containing silica, alumina and magnesia preferably<br>
comprises from 42 to 90 mol% of silicon, from 5.5 to 38 mol% of aluminum and from<br>
4 to 38 mol% of magnesium, and more preferably from 75 to 90 mol% of silicon, from<br>
5.5 to 15 mol% of alumina and from 4 to 10 mol% of magnesia based on the total<br>
molar amount of silicon, aluminum and magnesium from the viewpoint of mechanical<br>
strength and water resistance of the support. This is presumed to be because the<br>
silicon, aluminum and magnesium form a specific stable bonded structure if within<br>
these ranges.<br><br>
The following provides an explanation of a process for preparing the two<br>
preferable types of supports used in the present embodiment having the<br>
compositions described above.<br><br>
There are no particular limitations on the processed used to prepare a support<br>
containing silica and alumina, and an aluminum-containing silica-based composition<br>
obtained according to, for example, the processes of (1) to (5) below can be prepared<br>
by firing under conditions to be described later.<br>
(1)	Use of a commercially available silica-alumina composition.<br>
(2)	Reaction of a silica sol with an aluminum compound solution.<br>
(3)	Reaction of a silica sol with an aluminum composition insoluble in water.<br>
(4)	Reaction of a silica gel with an aqueous solution of a water-soluble aluminum<br>
compound.<br>
(5)	Solid-phase reaction of a silica gel and an aluminum compound.<br>
The following provides a detailed explanation of the processes for preparing a<br>
support indicated in (2) to (5) above.<br><br><br>
In the processes of (2) to (5) above, a silica sol or silica gel is used for the silica<br>
source. There are no particular limitations on the length of the Si-0 chain of the<br>
silica gel provided it has non-crosslinked Si sites that react with Al. Although<br>
preferable examples of aluminum compounds may include water-soluble compounds<br>
such as sodium aluminate, aluminum chloride hexahydrate, aluminum perchlorate<br>
hexahydrate, aluminum sulfate, aluminum nitrate nonahydrate or aluminum diacetate,<br>
insoluble compounds such as aluminum hydroxide or aluminum oxide can also be<br>
used provided they are compounds that react with non-crosslinked Si in the silica sol<br>
or silica gel.<br><br>
In the case of using the processes of (2) and (3) that use a silica sol for the<br>
starting material, the silica sol is mixed with an aluminum compound to obtain a<br>
mixed sol containing silica sol and aluminum compound, followed by carrying out a<br>
hydrothermal reaction for 1 to 48 hours at 20 to 100°C and drying to obtain a gel, and<br>
then firing under the temperature, time and atmospheric conditions to be described<br>
later. Alternatively, an alkaline aqueous solution is added to the above-mentioned<br>
mixed sol to co-precipitate silica and an aluminum compound, followed by drying and<br>
then firing under conditions to be described later. In addition, the above-mentioned<br>
mixed sol can be converted into fine particles directly using a spray dryer, or the<br>
mixed sol can be dried to form a gel and then granulated to obtain a support<br>
containing silica and aluminum having desired particle diameters.<br><br>
In the case of the process of (3) in particular, although a silica sol is reacted<br>
with an aluminum compound that is insoluble in water, at this time the aluminum<br>
compound can be crushed to a prescribed particle size in advance or preliminarily<br>
coarsely crushed. After having mixed and reacted the silica sol and the<br><br>
water-insoluble aluminum compound, the mixture is dried followed by firing under<br>
conditions to be described later. The silica-alumina compound may be crushed to a<br>
prescribed particle size after firing without crushing the aluminum compound in<br>
advance.<br><br><br>
In the case of the process of (4) in which a silica gel is used for the starting<br>
material, an aqueous solution of a water-soluble aluminum compound is reacted in<br>
silica gel, and the silica gel may either be crushed to a prescribed particle size in<br>
advance or preliminarily coarsely crushed. After mixing and reacting the silica gel<br>
and aqueous solution of a water-soluble aluminum compound for 1 to 48 hours at 20<br>
to 100°C, the mixture is dried followed by firing for 1 to 48 hours under the conditions<br>
to be described later. The silica-alumina compound may be crushed to a prescribed<br>
particle size after firing without crushing the silica gel in advance.<br><br>
Similarly, in the process of (5) that also uses a silica gel for the starting material,<br>
a mixture is prepared by reacting the silica gel with an aluminum compound in the<br>
solid phase. The Al is reacted in the solid phase with non-crosslinked Si. The<br>
silica gel and aluminum compound may be crushed to a prescribed particle size in<br>
advance, or may be preliminarily coarsely crushed. Crushing may be carried out<br>
independently for each substance or both substances may be crushed after mixing.<br>
Firing is carried out under temperature, time and atmospheric conditions to be<br>
described later. The mixture of silica gel and aluminum compound can be used by<br>
crushing to a desired particle size after the reaction without crushing in advance.<br>
With respect to a process for preparing a support containing silica, alumina and<br>
at least one type of basic metal component selected from the group consisting of<br>
alkaline metals, alkaline earth metals and rare earth metals, the support can be<br><br>
prepared by drying a slurry comprising a mixture of silica, alumina and an alkaline<br>
metal compound, alkaline earth metal compound and / or rare earth metal compound<br>
in accordance with process for preparing a support containing silica and alumina as<br>
described above, followed by firing under the conditions to be described later.<br><br>
Typical commercially available compounds similar to the aluminum raw material<br>
can be used for the raw material of the alkaline metal, alkaline earth metal and rare<br>
earth metal. The raw material is preferably a water-soluble compound, and more<br>
preferably a hydroxide, carbonate, sulfate or acetate.<br><br>
Another example of a preparation process that can be used may include<br>
adsorbing a basic metal component selected from the group consisting of alkaline<br>
metals, alkaline earth metals and rare earth metals onto a support containing silica<br>
and alumina. For example, an immersion process, in which a support is added to a<br>
solution in which a basic metal compound has been dissolved followed by heat<br>
treatment, or an impregnation process, in which an amount of a basic compound<br>
equal to pore volume is incorporated into a support followed by drying treatment, can<br>
be applied. However, a process in which an alkaline metal compound is adsorbed<br>
later requires caution in that liquid drying treatment is carried out under mild<br>
conditions in consideration of highly dispersing the basic metal component on the<br>
support.<br><br>
Next, an explanation is provided of a process for preparing a support containing<br>
silica, alumina and magnesia. A silica-alumina-magnesia support obtained<br>
according to the processes of (1) to (5) below, for example, can be prepared by firing<br>
under conditions to be described later.<br>
(1) Preliminary formation of a silica-alumina gel followed by the addition of<br><br>
magnesia.<br>
(2)	Reaction of a silica sol, aluminum compound and magnesium compound.<br>
(3)	Reaction of a silica sol, water-insoluble aluminum compound and water-<br>
insoluble magnesium compound.<br>
(4)	Reaction of a silica gel, water-soluble aluminum compound and water-<br>
soluble magnesium compound.<br>
(5)	Solid phase reaction of a silica gel, aluminum compound and magnesium<br>
compound.<br><br>
In the processes of (1) to (5) above, a silica sol, water glass or silica gel is used<br>
for the silica source. There are no particular limitations on the length of the Si-0<br>
chain of the silica gel provided it has non-crosslinked Si sites that react with Al.<br>
Although preferable examples of aluminum compounds may include water-soluble<br>
compounds such as sodium aluminate, aluminum chloride hexahydrate, aluminum<br>
perchlorate hexahydrate, aluminum sulfate, aluminum nitrate nonahydrate or<br>
aluminum diacetate, insoluble compounds such as aluminum hydroxide or aluminum<br>
oxide can also be used provided they are compounds that react with non-crosslinked<br>
Si in the silica sol or silica gel. Examples of magnesium compounds that can be<br>
used may include magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium acetate,<br>
magnesium nitrate, magnesium chloride and magnesium sulfate.<br>
In the case of the process of (1) in which silica-alumina gel is used for the raw<br>
material, sulfuric acid first added to water glass to prepare a silica hydrogel having a<br>
pH of from 8 to 10.5, followed by the addition of an AI2(SC&gt;4)3 solution thereto (pH 2 or<br>
lower) and the addition of sodium aluminate (pH 5 to 5.5) to prepare a silica-alumina<br>
hydrogel. Next, the moisture content of the gel is then adjusted to 10 to 40% by<br><br>
spray drying and the like followed by the addition of magnesia, carrying out a<br>
hydrothermal reaction for 1 to 5 hours at 50 to 90°C, drying and then firing under<br>
conditions to be described later to obtain a support.<br>
In the case of the processes of (2) and (3) that use a silica sol for the starting<br>
material, a silica sol, aluminum compound and magnesium compound are mixed to<br>
obtain a mixed sol containing the silica sol, aluminum compound and magnesium<br>
compound, and a hydrothermal reaction is carried out for 1 to 48 hours at 20 to<br>
100°C followed by drying to obtain a gel, after which the gel is fired under<br>
temperature, time and atmospheric conditions to be described later. Alternatively,<br>
an alkaline aqueous solution is added, an alkaline aqueous solution is added to the<br>
above-mentioned mixed sol to coprecipitate silica, an aluminum compound and a<br>
magnesium compound, followed by drying and then firing under conditions to be<br>
described later. In addition, the above-mentioned mixed sol can be converted into<br>
fine particles directly using a spray dryer, or the mixed sol can be dried to form a gel<br>
and then granulated to obtain a support containing silica, aluminum, magnesia having<br>
desired particle diameters.<br><br>
In the case of the process of (3) in particular, although a silica sol is reacted<br>
with an aluminum compound and magnesium compound that are insoluble in water,<br>
at this time the aluminum compound and magnesium compound can be crushed to a<br>
prescribed particle size in advance or preliminarily coarsely crushed. After having<br>
mixed and reacted the silica sol, the water-insoluble aluminum compound and the<br>
water-insoluble magnesium compound, the mixture is dried followed by firing under<br>
conditions to be described later. The silica-alumina-magnesia compound may be<br>
crushed to a prescribed particle size after firing without crushing the aluminum<br><br>
compound and magnesium compound in advance.<br>
The process of (4) using a silica gel for the starting material, an aqueous<br>
solution of a water-soluble aluminum compound and water-soluble magnesium<br>
compound is reacted in silica gel, and the silica gel may either be crushed to a<br>
prescribed particle size in advance or preliminarily coarsely crushed. After mixing<br>
and reacting the silica gel and aqueous solution of the water-soluble aluminum<br>
compound and water-soluble magnesium compound for 1 to 48 hours at 20 to 100°C,<br>
the mixture is dried followed by firing for 1 to 48 hours under the conditions to be<br>
described later. The silica-alumina-magnesia compound may be crushed to a<br>
prescribed particle size after firing without crushing the silica gel in advance.<br><br>
Similarly, in the process of (5) that also uses a silica gel for the starting material,<br>
a mixture is prepared by reacting the silica gel with an aluminum compound and a<br>
magnesium compound in the solid phase. The silica gel, aluminum compound and<br>
magnesium compound may be crushed to a prescribed particle size in advance, or<br>
may be preliminarily coarsely crushed. Crushing may be carried out independently<br>
for each substance or all three substances may be crushed after mixing. Firing is<br>
carried out under temperature, time and atmospheric conditions to be described later.<br>
The mixture of silica gel, aluminum compound and magnesium compound can be<br>
used by crushing to a desired particle size after the reaction without crushing in<br>
advance.<br><br>
In addition, inorganic and organic substances can be added to a mixed slurry of<br>
each of the above raw materials to control slurry properties or finely adjust properties<br>
such as the pore structure of the product or the properties of the resulting support.<br><br><br>
Specific examples of inorganic substances used may include inorganic acids<br>
such as nitric acid, hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, metal salts of alkaline metals<br>
such as Li, Na, K, Rb or Cs or alkaline earth metals such as Mg, Ca, Sr or Ba,<br>
water-soluble compounds such as ammonia or ammonium sulfate, and clay minerals<br>
that form suspensions by dispersing in water. In addition, specific examples of<br>
organic substances may include polymers such as polyethylene glycol, methyl<br>
cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylic acid or polyacrylamide.<br><br>
Although there are various effects of the addition or inorganic and organic<br>
substances, these effects may mainly include forming a spherical support as well as<br>
controlling pore diameter and pore volume, and more specifically, the liquid<br>
properties of the mixed slurry are an important factor in obtaining a spherical support.<br>
Liquid properties can be changed to those that facilitate the obtaining of a spherical<br>
support by adjusting the viscosity and solid concentration with an inorganic or organic<br>
substance. In addition, control of pore diameter and pore volume can be carried out<br>
by selecting the optimum organic compound that remains within the support in the<br>
formation stage and can be removed by firing and washing procedures following<br>
formation.<br><br>
A support can be prepared by spray drying a mixed slurry of each of the<br>
above-mentioned raw materials and additives. A known spraying apparatus, such<br>
as the rotating disc type, dual liquid nozzle type or pressurized nozzle type can be<br>
used to liquefy the mixed slurry.<br><br>
The sprayed liquid is required to be used in a well-mixed state. If the liquid is<br>
poorly mixed, the liquid affects the performance of the support, such as by causing a<br>
decrease in durability due to uneven distribution of the composition. When<br><br>
formulating raw materials in particular, since there are cases of the occurrence of<br>
increases in slurry viscosity or partial gelation (colloid condensation), there is concern<br>
over the formation of non-uniform particles. Consequently, there are cases in which<br>
it is preferable to control a silica sol of around pH 2 to a semi-stable range, for<br>
example, by employing a method such as adding acid or base while also taking<br>
additional considerations such as gradually mixing the raw materials while stirring.<br><br>
It is necessary for the sprayed liquid to have a certain degree of viscosity and<br>
solid concentration. If viscosity and solid concentration are excessively low, many of<br>
the porous bodies obtained by spray drying are in the form of distorted spheres rather<br>
than perfect spheres. In addition, if viscosity and solid concentration are<br>
excessively high, in addition to having a detrimental effect on the dispersibility of the<br>
porous bodies, it is not possible to form stable droplets depending on the liquid<br>
properties. Consequently, viscosity is preferably within a range of from 5 to 10000<br>
cps provided the liquid can be sprayed at that viscosity, and a higher sprayable<br>
viscosity tends to be preferable with respect to shape, and based on the balance<br>
between viscosity and ease of manipulation, viscosity is preferably selected from<br>
within a range of from 10 to 1000 cp. In addition, a solid concentration within the<br>
range of from 10 to 50 % by mass is preferable from the viewpoints of shape and<br>
particle diameter. Furthermore, a hot air temperature at the drying column inlet of<br>
the spray dryer of from 200 to 280°C and a drying column outlet temperature within a<br>
range of from 110 to 140°C are preferable as general indicators of spray drying<br>
conditions.<br><br>
The support firing temperature is typically selected from within a range of from<br>
200 to 800°C. Sintering at a temperature above 800°C causes a remarkable<br><br>
decrease in specific surface area, thereby making this undesirable. In addition,<br>
although there are no particular limitations on the firing atmosphere, firing is typically<br>
carried out in air or nitrogen. In addition, although firing time can be determined<br>
depending on the specific surface area after firing, it is typically from 1 to 48 hours.<br>
Since support physical properties such as porosity change, it is necessary to select<br>
suitable temperature and heating conditions for the firing conditions. If the firing<br>
temperature is excessively low, it becomes difficult to maintain durability as a<br>
composite oxide, while if the firing temperature is excessively high, a decrease in<br>
pore volume results. In addition, heating conditions preferably may include<br>
gradually raising the temperature by using programmed heating and the like. In the<br>
case of firing under conditions such that the temperature rises rapidly, gasification<br>
and combustion of inorganic and organic substances becomes violent, causing them<br>
to be exposed to temperatures above the set temperature or causing pulverization,<br>
thereby making this undesirable.<br><br>
The specific surface area of the support, as measured using the BET nitrogen<br>
adsorption method, is preferably 10 m2/g or more, more preferably 20 m2/g or more<br>
and even more preferably 50 m2/g or more, from the viewpoints of ease of loading<br>
composite nanoparticles, catalytic activity and resistance to exfoliation. In addition,<br>
although not particularly required from the viewpoint of catalyst activity, the specific<br>
surface area of the support is preferably 700 m2/g or less, more preferably 350 m2/g<br>
or less and even more preferably 300 m2/g or less, from the viewpoints of mechanical<br>
strength and durability.<br><br>
The pore structure of the support is an extremely important physical property<br>
with respect to loading properties of metal components other than strength, long-term<br><br>
stability including exfoliation, and reaction properties, and pore diameter is a physical<br>
value required for demonstrating these properties. If pore diameter is less than 3<br>
nm, although exfoliation properties of the loaded metal are favorable, in the case of<br>
using the catalyst in a liquid phase reaction and the like, pore diameter is preferably 3<br>
nm or more, from the viewpoint of maintaining high reactivity without making<br>
intrapore diffusion resistance excessively large so that the diffusion step of the<br>
reaction substrate is not the limiting step. On the other hand, the pore diameter is<br>
preferably 50 nm or less, from the viewpoint of resistance of the catalyst to cracking<br>
and resistance to exfoliation of loaded metal. Thus, the pore diameter is preferably<br>
from 3 to 50 nm, and more preferably from 3 to 30 nm. Pore volume is required to<br>
allow the presence of pores for loading the composite nanoparticles. However, if<br>
pore volume becomes excessively large, strength tends to decrease rapidly. Thus,<br>
a pore volume within a range of from 0.1 to 1.0 mL/g is preferable, while that within<br>
the range of from 0.1 to 0.5 mL/g is more preferable, from the viewpoint of strength.<br>
The support of the present embodiment preferably satisfies the above ranges for<br>
pore diameter and pore volume.<br><br>
The shape of the support is selected from among a hollow cylindrical shape or<br>
honeycomb shape being a structure that demonstrates low pressure loss in a fixed<br>
bed according to the type of reaction, and under liquid phase slurry suspension<br>
conditions, the slurry is typically spherical and the shape of the support is selected<br>
that allows the support to be used by selecting the optimum pore diameter based on<br>
the reactivity and separation method. For example, in the case of employing a<br>
catalyst separation process using the typically simple method of precipitation<br>
separation, a particle diameter of from 10 to 200 µm is preferably selected, that of<br>
from 20 to 150 µm is more preferably selected, and that of from 30 to 150 µm is even<br><br>
more preferably selected based on the balance with reaction properties. In the case<br>
of employing a cross filter method, small particles having a particle diameter of from<br>
0.1 to 20 µm or less are preferable due to their high reactivity. The catalyst for<br>
producing carboxylic acid ester according to the present embodiment can thus be<br>
used by changing the type and form of support according to the purpose of use.<br><br>
Although there are no particular limitations on the amount of oxidized nickel<br>
loaded onto the support, it is generally from 0.1 to 20 % by mass, preferably from 0.2<br>
to 10 % by mass, more preferably from 0.2 to 5 % by mass and even more preferably<br>
from 0.5 to 2 % by mass as nickel based on the support weight. The amount of X<br>
loaded onto the support is generally from 0.1 to 10 % by mass, preferably from 0.2 to<br>
5 % by mass, more preferably from 0.2 to 2 % by mass, even more preferably from<br>
0.3 to 1.5 % by mass and particularly preferably from 0.5 to 1.0 % by mass as metal<br>
based on the support weight.<br><br>
Moreover, in the present embodiment, a preferable range exists for the atomic<br>
ratio between nickel and the elementary composition of the support. In the case of<br>
using a support of the present embodiment containing silica and alumina, the<br>
composition ratio of nickel and alumina in the catalyst in terms of the atomic ratio of<br>
Ni / Al is preferably from 0.01 to 1.0, more preferably from 0.02 to 0.8 and even more<br>
preferably from 0.04 to 0.6. In addition, in the case of using a support containing<br>
silica, alumina and at least one type of basic metal component selected from the<br>
group consisting of alkaline metals, alkaline earth metals and rare earth metals, the<br>
composition ratio of nickel and alumina in the catalyst in terms of the atomic ratio of<br>
Ni / Al is preferably from 0.01 to 1.0, more preferably from 0.02 to 0.8 and even more<br>
preferably from 0.04 to 0.6, while the composition ratio of nickel and basic metal<br><br>
component in terms of the atomic ratio of Ni / (alkaline metal + alkaline earth metal +<br>
rare earth metal) is preferably from 0.01 to 1.2, more preferably from 0.02 to 1.0 and<br>
even more preferably from 0.04 to 0.6.<br><br>
Moreover, preferable ranges also exist for the atomic ratio between nickel and<br>
the support constituent elements of aluminum and magnesium in the case of a<br>
silica-alumina-magnesia support. The composition ratio of nickel and alumina in the<br>
catalyst in terms of the atomic ratio of Ni / Al is preferably from 0.01 to 1.0, more<br>
preferably from 0.02 to 0.8 and even more preferably from 0.04 to 0.6. In addition,<br>
the composition ratio of nickel and magnesium in terms of the atomic ratio of Ni / Mg<br>
is preferably from 0.01 to 1.2, more preferably from 0.02 to 1.0 and even more<br>
preferably from 0.04 to 0.6.<br><br>
If the atomic ratio of nickel and aluminum which is a support constituent<br>
element, basic metal element or magnesium is within the above ranges, effects<br>
resulting in improvement of elution of nickel and structural changes in the catalyst<br>
particles tend to be enhanced. This is thought to be the result of the nickel,<br>
aluminum, basic metal component and magnesium forming a specific composite<br>
oxide when being within these ranges, thereby forming a stable bonded structure.<br><br>
The catalyst for use in production of carboxylic acid ester according to the<br>
present embodiment can also comprise a third constituent element as a catalyst<br>
active component in addition to the oxidized nickel and X. Examples of elements<br>
that can be contained may include titanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron,<br>
cobalt, zinc, gallium, zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, rhodium, cadmium, indium, tin,<br>
antimony, tellurium, hafnium, tantalum, tungsten, rhenium, osmium, iridium, mercury,<br>
thallium, lead, bismuth, aluminum, boron, silicon and phosphorous. The content of<br><br>
these third constituent elements is from 0.01 to 20 % by mass and preferably from<br>
0.05 to 10 % by mass per catalyst. In addition, at least one type of metal<br>
component selected from the group consisting of alkaline metals, alkaline earth<br>
metals and rare earth metals may also be contained in the catalyst. The content of<br>
these alkaline metals, alkaline earth metals or rare earth metals is selected from<br>
within a range of 15 % by mass or less per catalyst.<br><br>
Note that these third constituent elements or alkaline metals, alkaline earth<br>
metals and rare earth metals may be contained in the catalyst during production and<br>
reaction of the catalyst, or a method may be used by which they are contained in the<br>
support in advance.<br><br>
[Catalyst Shape]<br>
The specific surface area of the catalyst according to the present embodiment,<br>
as measured using the BET nitrogen adsorption method, is preferably within a range<br>
of from 20 to 350 m2/g, more preferably from 50 to 300 m2/g and even more<br>
preferably from 100 to 250 m2/g, from the viewpoints of catalytic activity and<br>
resistance to exfoliation of active components.<br><br>
The pore structure of the catalyst is an extremely important physical property<br>
with respect to loading properties of metal components, long-term stability including<br>
exfoliation, and reaction properties, and pore diameter is a physical value required for<br>
demonstrating these properties. If pore diameter is less than 3 nm, although<br>
exfoliation properties of the loaded metal are favorable, in the case of using the<br>
catalyst in a liquid phase reaction and the like, pore diameter is preferably 3 nm or<br>
more, from the viewpoint of maintaining high reactivity without making intrapore<br>
diffusion resistance excessively large so that the diffusion step of the reaction<br><br>
substrate is not the limiting step. On the other hand, the pore diameter is preferably<br>
50 nm or less, from the viewpoint of resistance of the catalyst to cracking and<br>
resistance to exfoliation of loaded metal. Thus, the pore diameter is preferably from<br>
3 to 50 nm, more preferably from 3 to 30 nm and even more preferably from 3 to 10<br>
nm. Pore volume is preferably within a range of from 0.1 to 1.0 mL/g, more<br>
preferably from 0.1 to 0.5 mL/g and even more preferably from 0.1 to 0.3 mL/g, from<br>
the viewpoints of loading properties and reaction properties. The catalyst according<br>
to the present embodiment preferably satisfies the above ranges for pore diameter<br>
and pore volume.<br>
Catalyst pore diameter can be suitably selected depending on the type of<br>
reaction. For example, when using in a liquid phase suspended state, for example,<br>
pore diameter varies according to the method used to separate the catalyst, and in<br>
the case of separation by spontaneous settling, is preferably from 10 to 200 µm,<br>
more preferably from 20 to 150 µm and even more preferably from 20 to 100 µm.<br><br>
[Process for Producing Catalyst for Use in Production of Carboxylic Acid Ester]<br>
There are no particular limitations on the production process of the catalyst<br>
according to the present embodiment provided a catalyst as previously described is<br>
obtained, and a commonly used production process for a loading catalyst can be<br>
applied, examples of which may include impregnation processes (such as adsorption,<br>
pore filling, evaporation to dryness or spraying), precipitation processes (such as<br>
co-precipitation, precipitation deposition or kneading), ion exchange and vapor<br>
deposition. In the present embodiment, impregnation and precipitation processes<br>
are preferable, while precipitation processes are used more preferably.<br><br>
The following provides an explanation of a typical process for preparing the<br><br>
catalyst according to the present embodiment using the example of precipitation. In<br>
a first step, for example, a catalyst precursor is obtained by precipitating nickel and<br>
component X on a support by neutralizing an acidic aqueous solution of a soluble<br>
metal salt containing nickel and X. At this stage, the nickel and X components (such<br>
as a hydroxide) are precipitated and fixed on the support due to neutralization<br>
reaction between nickel and X ions in the aqueous solution. Compounding of nickel<br>
and component X is preferably made to be more adequate by simultaneously<br>
precipitating from a mixed aqueous solution of both components.<br><br>
Next, in a second step, the catalyst according to the present embodiment can<br>
be obtained by rinsing and drying the catalyst precursor obtained in the first step as<br>
necessary followed by heat treatment.<br><br>
Examples of soluble metal salts containing nickel used to prepare the catalyst<br>
may include nickel nitrate, nickel acetate and nickel chloride. In addition, examples<br>
of soluble metal salts containing X may include palladium chloride and palladium<br>
acetate in the case palladium is selected for X, ruthenium chloride and ruthenium<br>
nitrate in the case ruthenium is selected for X, chloroauric acid, sodium<br>
tetrachloroaurate , potassium dicyanoaurate, gold diethylamine trichloride and gold<br>
cyanide in the case gold is selected for X, and silver chloride and silver nitrate in the<br>
case silver is selected for X.<br><br>
Examples of bases used to prepare the catalyst may include sodium hydroxide,<br>
potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate and ammonia. In<br>
addition, one or a plurality of types of basic metal components selected from the<br>
group consisting of alkaline metals (such as Li, Na, K, Rb or Cs), alkaline earth<br>
metals (such as Be, Mg, Ca, Sr or Ba) and rare earth metals (such as La, Ce or Pr)<br><br>
may be contained in the support.<br>
In the first step, an acid aqueous solution of a soluble metal salt containing<br>
nickel and X is mixed with a support and then neutralized with base while stirring to<br>
precipitate a precipitate of nickel and component X onto a support. Conditions such<br>
as the concentration of the aqueous solution containing nickel and X, base, pH of the<br>
aqueous solution and temperature are suitably selected during precipitation of the<br>
nickel and component X.<br><br>
The each concentration of the aqueous solution containing nickel and X is<br>
generally within a range of from 0.0001 to 1.0 mol/L, preferably from 0.001 to 0.5<br>
mol/L and more preferably from 0.005 to 0.2 mol/L. The ratio of nickel and X in the<br>
aqueous solution in terms of the atomic ratio of Ni / X is preferably within a range of<br>
from 0.1 to 10, more preferably from 0.2 to 5.0 and even more preferably from 0.5 to<br>
3.0.<br><br>
In addition, the pH of the aqueous solution is adjusted with the<br>
above-mentioned base so as to generally be within a range of from 5 to 10 and<br>
preferably within a range of from 6 to 8. The temperature of the aqueous solution is<br>
generally within a range of from 0 to 100°C, preferably from 30 to 90°C and more<br>
preferably from 60 to 90°C.<br>
In addition, there are no particular limitations on the amount of time during<br>
precipitation of nickel and component X, and although this time differs depending on<br>
such factors as the loaded species, amounts of nickel and X loaded and the ratio of<br>
nickel and X, it is generally within a range of from 1 minute to 5 hours, preferably<br>
from 5 minutes to 3 hours and more preferably from 5 minutes to 1 hour.<br><br>
The temperature during heat treatment of the catalyst precursor in the second<br>
step is generally from 40 to 900°C, preferably from 80 to 800°C, more preferably from<br>
200 to 700°C and even more preferably from 300 to 600°C. Heat treatment is<br>
carried out in an atmosphere such as air (or atmospheric air), oxidizing atmosphere<br>
(such as oxygen, ozone, nitrogen oxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen peroxide,<br>
hypochlorous acid or inorganic / organic peroxide) or inert gas atmosphere (such as<br>
helium, argon or nitrogen). The duration of heat treatment is suitably selected<br>
according to the heat treatment temperature and amount of catalyst precursor.<br><br>
Following the above-mentioned second step, reducing treatment can be carried<br>
out in a reducing atmosphere as necessary (such as hydrogen, hydrazine, formalin<br>
or formic acid). In this case, reduction is carried out by selecting a treatment<br>
method in which the oxidized nickel is not completely reduced to a metal state. The<br>
temperature and duration of reducing treatment are suitably selected according to the<br>
type of reducing agent, type of X and amount of catalyst.<br><br>
Moreover, oxidizing treatment can also be carried out as necessary in air (or<br>
atmospheric air) or an oxidizing atmosphere (such as oxygen, ozone, nitrogen oxide,<br>
carbon dioxide, hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorous acid or inorganic / organic<br>
peroxide) following the heat treatment or reducing treatment as described above.<br>
A third constituent element in addition to the nickel and X can be added during<br>
catalyst preparation or under the reaction conditions. Alkaline metal, alkaline earth<br>
metal or rare earth metal may also be added during catalyst preparation or to the<br>
reaction system. In addition, raw materials of the third constituent element, alkaline<br>
metal, alkaline earth metal and rare earth metal are selected from salts of organic<br><br>
acids, salts of inorganic acids, hydroxides and the like.<br><br>
[Process for Producing Carboxylic Acid Ester]<br>
Carboxylic acid ester can be produced from (a) aldehyde and alcohol or (b) one<br>
or more types of alcohols in the presence of oxygen using the catalyst for use in<br>
production of carboxylic acid ester according to the present embodiment.<br><br>
Although there are no particular limitations on the amount of catalyst used, and<br>
can be varied over a wide range according to, for example, the types of reaction raw<br>
materials, catalyst composition and preparation method, reaction conditions or type<br>
of reaction, in the case of reacting the catalyst in the state of a slurry, the catalyst can<br>
be preferably used such that the solid concentration in the slurry is within a range of<br>
from 1 to 50 wt/vol%, preferably from 3 to 30 wt/vol% and more preferably from 10 to<br>
25 wt/vol%.<br><br>
Examples of aldehydes able to be used as raw materials may include C1 to C10<br>
aliphatic saturated aldehydes such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde,<br>
isobutyrylaldehyde or glyoxal; C3 to C10 aliphatic α . β-unsaturated aldehydes such as<br>
acrolein, methacrolein or crotonaldehyde; C6 to C20 aromatic aldehydes such as<br>
benzaldehyde, tolylaldehyde, benzylaldehyde or phthalaldehyde; and derivatives of<br>
these aldehydes. These aldehydes can be used alone or as a mixture of any two or<br>
more types thereof.<br><br>
Examples of alcohols able to be used may include C1 to C10 aliphatic saturated<br>
alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, 2-ethylhexanol or octanoyl;<br>
C5 to C10 alicyclic alcohols such as cyclopentanol or cyclohexanol; C2 to C10 diols<br>
such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or butanediol; C3 to C10 aliphatic<br><br>
unsaturated alcohols such as allyl alcohol or methallyl alcohol; C6 to C20 aromatic<br>
alcohols such as benzyl alcohol; and hydroxyoxetanes such as<br>
3-alkyl-3-hydroxymethyloxetane. These alcohols can be used alone or in the form<br>
of a mixture of any two or more types thereof.<br><br>
In the production process according to the present embodiment, (a) a<br>
corresponding carboxylic acid ester can be produced by reacting aldehyde and<br>
alcohol, or (b) a corresponding carboxylic acid ester can be produced by reacting one<br>
or more types of alcohols.<br><br>
In the case of producing carboxylic acid ester from aldehyde and alcohol, there<br>
are no particular limitations on the weight ratio of the aldehyde and alcohol, and<br>
although production can be carried out over a wide range of weight ratios, such as a<br>
molar ratio of aldehyde to alcohol of from 10 to 1/1,000, production is typically carried<br>
out at a molar ratio within a range of from 1/2 to 1/50.<br><br>
In the case of producing carboxylic acid ester from two types of alcohols as well,<br>
there are no particular limitations on the weight ratios of the types of alcohols, and<br>
production can be carried out at a molar ratio of one type of alcohol to another type of<br>
alcohol of from 10 to 1/1000 and preferably from 1/2 to 1/50.<br>
Production of carboxylic acid ester can be carried out either in batches or<br>
continuously using any arbitrary method such as a vapor phase reaction, liquid phase<br>
reaction or irrigant reaction.<br><br>
Although the reaction can be carried out in the absence of solvent, it can also<br>
be carried out using a solvent that is inert with respect to the reaction components,<br><br>
such as hexane, decane, benzene or dioxane.<br><br>
Although the reaction can be carried out using a type of reaction known in the<br>
prior art, such as a fixed bed reaction, fluid bed reaction or stirred tank reaction, when<br>
carrying out the reaction in the liquid phase, for example, the reaction can be carried<br>
out using any type of reaction vessel, such as a bubble column reactor, draft tube<br>
reactor or stirred tank reactor.<br><br>
The oxygen used in the production of carboxylic acid ester can be in the form of<br>
molecular oxygen, namely oxygen gas per se or a mixed gas in which oxygen gas is<br>
diluted with a diluent that is inert in the reaction, such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide<br>
gas, and air is preferably used for the oxygen raw material based on the ease of the<br>
procedure, economy and the like.<br><br>
Although oxygen partial pressure varies according to the type of aldehyde, type<br>
of alcohol and other reaction materials, reaction conditions or type of reaction vessel<br>
and the like, in consideration of practical use, oxygen partial pressure at the reaction<br>
vessel outlet is within a range that is below the lower limit concentration of the<br>
explosive range thereof, and is preferably controlled to, for example, from 20 to 80<br>
kPa. Although the reaction can be carried out over a wide range of arbitrary<br>
reaction pressures, from depressurization to pressurization, the reaction is generally<br>
carried out a pressure of from 0.05 to 2 MPa. It is preferable from the viewpoint of<br>
safety to set total pressure so that the oxygen concentration of the reaction vessel<br>
outflow gas does not exceed the explosion limit (oxygen concentration of, for<br>
example, 8%).<br><br>
In the case of carrying out the carboxylic acid ester production reaction in a<br><br>
liquid phase and the like, the pH of the reaction system is preferably maintained at 6<br>
to 9 by adding an alkaline metal or alkaline earth metal compound (such as an oxide,<br>
hydroxide, carbonate or carboxylate) to the reaction system. These alkaline metal<br>
or alkaline earth metal compounds can be used alone or two or more types can be<br>
used in combination.<br><br>
Although production of carboxylic acid ester can be carried out at a high<br>
temperature of 200°C and above for the reaction temperature, the reaction<br>
temperature is preferably from 30 to 200°C, more preferably from 40 to 150°C and<br>
even more preferably from 60 to 120°C. There are no particular limitations on the<br>
reaction time, and although unable to be unconditionally defined since it varies<br>
according to the set conditions, is generally from 1 to 20 hours.<br>

nitric acid and hydrochloric acid to the precipitated residue, decomposing by heating<br>
with a microwave decomposition apparatus, and using a pure, fixed volume of the<br>
resulting decomposition liquid for the sample.<br>
The quantification method was carried out by quantifying using the internal<br>
standard method by ICP-AES and subtracting the value of a simultaneously tested<br>
procedural blank to determine the contents of nickel and X in the catalyst and<br>
calculate the loaded amounts and atomic ratio.<br><br>
[Determination of Contents of Loaded Constituent Elements (Si, Al, Basic Metal, Mg)]<br>

Powder X-ray Diffraction System (XRD) manufactured by Rigaku Corp. under<br>
conditions of using a copper tube for the X-ray source (40 kV, 200 mA), measuring<br>
range of 5 to 65 degrees (0.02 deg / step), measuring speed of 0.2 deg / min and slit<br>
widths (scattering, divergence, reception) of 1 degree, 1 degree and 0.15 mm.<br>
The catalyst samples were uniformly dispersed on a non-reflecting sample plate<br>
and fixed with a neoprene film.<br>
[Analysis of Chemical State of Catalyst Metal Components]<br>
Analysis of the chemical state of catalyst metal components was carried out<br>
using the ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) system<br>
manufactured by Thermo Electron Corp. under conditions of using Al Ka (15 kV x 10<br>
mA) for the excitation source, analyzed surface area of about 1 mm (shape: oval),<br>
using a survey scan (0 to 1, 100 eV) and narrow scan (Ni2p) for the uptake regions.<br>
Measurement samples were prepared for XPS measurement by crushing<br>

respectively. Filter paper was used for the absorber in the standard samples,<br>
counting time was selected for each sample in the catalyst samples, and<br>
measurements were carried out so that the peak intensity of the Ka spectrum was<br>
3,000 cps or less and the counting time was 10,000 counts or more. Measurements<br>
were repeated five times on each sample, and a metal sample was measured before<br>
and after each repeated measurement. After performing smoothing processing<br>
(S-G method, 7 points, 5 cycles) on the measured spectra, the peak location, full<br>
width at half maximum (FWHM) and asymmetry coefficient (Al) were calculated, and<br>
the peak location was treated in the form of the displacement, or chemical shift (AE),<br>

LS230 Laser Diffraction Particle Size Analyzer manufactured by Beckman-Coulter,<br>
Inc.<br><br>
[Reference Example 1]<br>
Using 0.5 g of commercially available nickel oxide (Wako Pure Chemical<br>
Industries, Ltd.) as catalyst, 1.0 g of methacrolein and 10 mL of methanol were<br>
charged into a high-pressure autoclave-type reaction vessel (total volume: 120 mL)<br>
made of SUS316 provided with a magnetic stirrer. After closing the autoclave and<br>
replacing the inside of the system with a nitrogen gas, a nitrogen mixed gas<br>
containing 7 vol% of oxygen was introduced into a vapor phase unit and the total<br>
pressure inside the system was increased to 3.0 MPa. Next, the reaction vessel<br>
was immobilized in an oil bath and the reaction was carried out for 2 hours at a<br>
reaction temperature of 80°C while stirring. After cooling, residual pressure was<br>
released and the autoclave was opened followed by filtering out the catalyst and<br>
analyzing the filtrate by gas chromatography. As a result, the amount of methyl<br>
methacryiate formed was 1.0 nmol.<br><br>
[Reference Example 2]<br>
A reaction was carried out in the same manner as Reference Example 1 with<br>
the exception of using nickel peroxide hydrate (Aldrich Corp.) for the catalyst instead<br><br>
of nickel oxide. As a result, the amount of methyl methacrylate formed was 5.3<br>
µmol.<br><br>
[Reference Example 3]<br>
A reaction was carried out in the same manner as Reference Example 1 with<br>
the exception of using nickel metal (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) for the<br>
catalyst instead of nickel oxide. As a result, the formation of methyl methacrylate<br>
was unable to be confirmed.<br><br>
[Example 1]<br>
(1) Catalyst Preparation<br>
30 g of commercially available γ-alumina (Neobead, Mizusawa Industrial<br>
Chemicals, Ltd.) were added to a glass container containing 100 mL of distilled water<br>
followed by dropping in prescribed amounts of an aqueous nickel nitrate solution and<br>
aqueous palladium chloride solution while stirring at 60°C, adding 0.5 N aqueous<br>
sodium hydroxide solution to adjust the pH of the aqueous solutions to 8, continuing<br>
to stir for 1 hour, allowing to stand undisturbed, removing the supernatant, washing<br>
with distilled water until CI ion was no longer detected, drying for 16 hours at 105°C<br>
and firing in air for 5 hours at 600°C. Next, the resulting catalyst was subjected to<br>
reducing treatment for 1 hour at room temperature under a hydrogen atmosphere to<br>
obtain a catalyst loaded with 1.5 % by mass of nickel and 0.5 % by mass of palladium<br>
(NiOPd / γ-alumina). The atomic ratio of Ni / (Ni + Pd) of the resulting catalyst was<br>
0.84. Based on the results of X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffraction patterns attributable<br>
to nickel were not observed, thus confirming nickel to be present in an amorphous<br>
state. On the other hand, although not able to be defined as a well-defined peak, a<br>
broad peak was present corresponding to palladium crystals. Although the value of<br><br>
this peak was close to the powder X-ray diffraction detection limit (2 nm), calculation<br>
of the average crystallite size using Scherrer's formula yielded a value of about 3 nm.<br>
With respect to the chemical state of the Ni, the valence was confirmed to be 2 based<br>
on the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).<br>
In addition, observation of the form of the active species of the catalyst with a<br>
transmission electron microscope (TEM/STEM) confirmed that nanoparticles having<br>
a maximum particle diameter distribution of from 3 to 4 nm (number average particle<br>
diameter: 3.8 nm) were loaded on the support. An elementary analysis (20 points)<br>
was carried out on each observed nanoparticle by ancillary energy-dispersive X-ray<br>
spectroscopy (EDX), and nickel and palladium were confirmed in all of the particles.<br>
The atomic ratio of nickel to palladium of these composite particles (mean value) was<br>
1.24.<br><br>
(2) Synthesis of Carboxylic Acid Ester<br>
0.2 g of the catalyst obtained in (1) above, 1.0 g of methacrolein and 10 mL of<br>
methanol were charged into a high-pressure autoclave-type reaction vessel (total<br>
volume: 120 mL) made of SUS316 and provided with a magnetic stirrer. After<br>
closing the autoclave and replacing the inside of the system with nitrogen, a mixed<br>
nitrogen gas containing 7 vol% oxygen was introduced into a vapor phase unit and<br>
the pressure inside the system was increased to 3.0 MPa.<br>
Next, the reaction vessel was immobilized in an oil bath and a reaction was<br>
carried out for 1 hour at a reaction temperature of 80°C while stirring. After cooling,<br>
residual pressure was released and the autoclave was opened followed by filtering<br>
out the catalyst and analyzing the filtrate by gas chromatography. As a result, the<br>
methacrolein conversion rate was 18.2% and methyl methacrylate selectivity was<br>
74.5%.<br><br>
[Example 2]<br>
A catalyst was prepared in the same manner as in (1) of Example 1 with the<br>
exception of using an aqueous silver nitrate solution instead of an aqueous palladium<br>
chloride solution. The loaded amounts of nickel and silver of the resulting catalyst<br>
were 1.6 % by mass and 1.3 % by mass, respectively (NiOAg / γ-alumina). In<br>
addition, the atomic ratio of Ni / (Ni + Ag) was 0.69. Based on the results of powder<br>
X-ray diffraction (XRD), a broad peak was present corresponding to silver crystals.<br>
Calculation of the average crystallite size thereof according to Schemer's formula<br>
yielded a value of about 4 nm. On the other hand, a diffraction pattern attributable<br>
to nickel was not observed, thus confirming that nickel is present in an amorphous<br>
state. With respect to the chemical state of Ni, the valence was confirmed to be 2<br>
based on the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).<br>
Observation of the form of the active species of the catalyst with a transmission<br>
electron microscope (TEM/STEM) confirmed that nanoparticles having a maximum<br>
particle diameter distribution of 4 to 5 nm (number average particle diameter: 4.2 nm)<br>
were loaded on the support. An elementary analysis (20 points) was carried out on<br>
each observed nanoparticle by ancillary energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX),<br>
and nickel and silver were confirmed in all of the particles. The atomic ratio of nickel<br>
to silver of these composite particles (mean value) was 0.81.<br>
In addition, as a result of investigating changes in the electron excitation state<br>
of this catalyst by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), surface plasmon<br>
absorption peaks originating from silver nanoparticles were not observed in the<br>
vicinity of 405 nm, while broad absorbance attributable to NiO2 was observed over a<br>
wavelength range from 200 to 800 nm.<br>
A reaction was carried out in the same manner as (2) of Example 1 using this<br><br>
catalyst. As a result, the methacrolein conversion rate was 6.2% and methyl<br>
methacrylate selectivity was 55.1 %.<br><br>
[Example 3]<br>
A catalyst was prepared in the same manner as in (1) of Example 1 with the<br>
exception of using an aqueous chloroauric acid solution instead of an aqueous<br>
palladium chloride solution. The loaded amounts of nickel and gold of the resulting<br>
catalyst were 1.4 % by mass and 0.4 % by mass, respectively (NiOAu / γ-alumina).<br>
In addition, the atomic ratio of Ni / (Ni + Au) was 0.92. Based on the results of<br>
powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), a diffraction pattern attributable to nickel was not<br>
observed, thus confirming that nickel is present in an amorphous state. On the<br>
other hand, although not able to be defined as a well-defined peak, a broad peak was<br>
present corresponding to gold crystals. Although the value of this peak was close to<br>
the powder X-ray diffraction detection limit (2 nm), calculation of the average<br>
crystallite size using Scherrer's formula yielded a value of about 3 nm. With respect<br>
to the chemical state of the Ni, the valence was confirmed to be 2 based on the<br>
results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).<br>
Observation of the form of the active species of the catalyst with a transmission<br>
electron microscope (TEM/STEM) confirmed that nanoparticles having a maximum<br>
particle diameter distribution of from 2 to 3 nm (number average particle diameter:<br>
3.2 nm) were loaded on the support. An elementary analysis (20 points) was carried<br>
out on each observed nanoparticle by ancillary energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy<br>
(EDX), and nickel and gold were confirmed in all of the particles. The atomic ratio of<br>
nickel to gold of these composite particles (mean value) was 1.14.<br>
As a result of investigating changes in the electron excitation state of this<br>
catalyst by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), surface plasmon absorption<br><br>
peaks originating from gold nanoparticles were not observed in the vicinity of 530 nm,<br>
while broad absorbance attributable to NiO2 was observed over a wavelength range<br>
from 200 to 800 nm.<br>
A reaction was carried out in the same manner as (2) of Example 1 using this<br>

[Reference Example 4]<br>
A catalyst loaded with 1.5 % by mass nickel (NiO / γ-alumina) was obtained by<br>

not adding an aqueous palladium chloride solution and not carrying out hydrogen<br>
reduction.<br>

yielded a value of about 3 nm.<br>
A reaction was carried out in the same manner as in (2) of Example 1 using this<br>

[Comparative Example 2]<br>
A catalyst loaded with 1.5 % by mass of silver (Ag / γ-alumina) was obtained by<br>
preparing a catalyst in the same manner as (1) of Example 1 with the exception of<br>
using aqueous silver nitrate solution instead of aqueous palladium chloride solution<br>
and not adding nickel nitrate. Based on the results of powder X-ray diffraction<br>
(XRD), a broad peak was present corresponding to silver crystals. Calculation of<br>
the average crystallite size thereof according to Scherrer's formula yielded a value of<br>
about 5 nm. As a result of investigating changes in the electron excitation state of<br>
this catalyst by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), surface plasmon absorption<br>
peaks originating from silver nanoparticles were observed in the vicinity of 405 nm.<br>

Table 1 shows the physical properties and reaction results for the catalysts for<br>
production of carboxylic acid ester of Examples 1 to 3, Reference Example 4 and<br>
Comparative Examples 1 to 3.<br><br><br><br>
[Example 4]<br>
A magnesium compound was impregnated and loaded onto commercially<br>
available silica (CARiACT Q-15, Fuji Silysia Chemical, Ltd.) over a hot water bath<br>
using an aqueous solution containing magnesium acetate. Next, the resulting<br>
impregnated product was dried for 12 hours at 120°C followed by firing in air for 6<br>
hours at 600°C. As a result, a silica-magnesia support (Si02-MgO) was obtained<br>
that contained 5 % by mass of magnesium oxide as Mg.<br>
Next, 100 mL of an aqueous solution containing prescribed amounts of an<br>
aqueous nickel nitrate solution and an aqueous chloroauric acid solution was heated<br><br>
at 80°C. 30 g of the silica-magnesia support obtained above was added to this<br>
solution followed by stirring for one hour while holding this mixture under stirring,<br>
thereby precipitating nickel and gold components onto the support. Next, this<br>
mixture was allowed to stand undisturbed and the supernatant was removed followed<br>
by washing with distilled water until CI ions were no longer detected. After that, this<br>
mixture was filtered and dried for 16 hours at 105°C and firing for 3 hours in air at<br>
500°C to obtain a catalyst loaded with 1.0% by mass of nickel and 0.8 % by mass of<br>
gold (NiOAu / SiO2-MgO). The atomic ratio of Ni / (Ni + Au) of the resulting catalyst<br>
was 0.81.<br><br>
According to the results of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the catalyst<br>
described above, a broad diffraction peak attributable to gold was observed, and<br>
calculation of average crystallite size based on the spread of the line width of the<br>
diffraction peak attributable to the Au (111) surface yielded a value of 3 nm. On the<br>
other hand, since there were no diffraction patterns originating from nickel, the nickel<br>
was presumed to be present in an amorphous phase. With respect to the chemical<br>
state of the nickel, the valence was confirmed to be 2 based on the results of X-ray<br>
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).<br><br>
The microstructure of the above catalyst was observed using a transmission<br>
electron microscope (TEM/STEM). As shown in FIG 1, spherical particles having a<br>
particle diameter of from 2 to 3 nm are uniformly loaded on the support surface. The<br>
number average particle diameter of the nanoparticles was 3.0 nm (number of<br>
nanoparticles used for calculation: 100). The nanoparticles were observed to have<br>
a lattice pattern in further enlarged images of the nanoparticles (FIG. 2). As a result<br>
of analyzing by Fourier transformation, a lattice pattern corresponding to the lattice<br><br>
spacing of Au (200) (d = 2.039 A) intersected at 90°C, thus indicating this to be the<br>
lattice image of Au (200). Thus, the nanoparticles comprised crystalline gold.<br>
Lattice patterns corresponding to the lattice spacing of Au (200) and Au (111) were<br>
also observed in other particles.<br>
Next, analysis of composition points by STEM-EDS for each nanoparticle<br>
indicated that nickel and gold were detected in each particle. The mean value of the<br>
ratio of nickel / gold atoms of the nanoparticles (number of nanoparticles used for<br>
calculation: 50) was 0.82. Only trace amounts of nickel were detected at analysis<br>
points other than the nanoparticles. Moreover, when nanoregions of the observed<br>
particles were analyzed (FIG. 3), the atomic ratio of Ni / Au at the centers of the<br>
particles (measurement point 1) was 0.73, while that at the particle edge<br>
(measurement point 2) was 2.95. Only trace amounts of nickel were detected at<br>
other portions of the particles (measurement point 3). As a result of carrying out<br>
similar measurements 20 times, larger amounts of nickel were detected around the<br>
edges of all particles. The distribution of nickel and gold was observed to nearly<br>
completely agree with this based on the results of EDS element mapping. In<br>
addition, nickel was distributed one circumference larger than the distribution of gold<br>
in all scanning directions (1, 2) based on composition line profiles (FIG. 4). In this<br>
manner, since nickel is distributed over the gold and nickel is detected in larger<br>
amounts around the edges of the particles, the nanoparticles contained in the<br>
above-mentioned catalyst are considered to have a form in which the surfaces of<br>
gold nanoparticles are covered with nickel.<br><br>
FIG. 5 shows the absorption spectra of NiOAu / SiO2-MgO catalyst particles<br>
using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis). The Au / Si02-MgO sample has gold<br>
nanoparticles loaded on the same support (catalyst prepared in Comparative<br><br>
Example 4 to be described later), and surface plasmon absorption originating from<br>
the gold nanoparticles appears in the vicinity of 530 nm. The NiO / SiO2-MgO<br>
sample (catalyst prepared in Reference Example 5 to be described later) and NiO2/<br>
SiO2-MgO sample (synthesized by subjecting the sample prepared in Reference<br>
Example 5 to oxidizing treatment with hypochlorous acid) have fine particles of NiO<br>
and NiO2 loaded on the same support, and broad absorbance over a wavelength<br>
range of 200 to 800 nm observed with NiO2/ SiO2-MgO was no longer observed with<br>
NiO / SiO2-MgO. This result means that broad absorbance over the wavelength<br>
range of 200 to 800 nm is demonstrated in case of highly oxidized nickel oxide (NiO2).<br>
In contrast, surface plasmon absorption of gold in the vicinity of 530 nm does not<br>
appear in the case of NiOAu / SiO2-MgO, and broad absorbance attributable to NiO2<br>
is observed over the wavelength range of 200 to 800 nm.<br><br>
On the basis of these results, NiOAu / SiO2-MgO catalysts are believed to be of<br>
a form in which gold atoms are not present on the surface thereof, but rather the<br>
surfaces of gold nanoparticles are covered with highly oxidized nickel oxide.<br><br>
0.3 g of the catalyst obtained above, 1.0 g of methacrolein and 10 mL of<br>
methanol were charged into a high-pressure autoclave-type reaction vessel (total<br>
volume: 120 mL) made of SUS316 and provided with a magnetic stirrer, and after<br>
closing the autoclave and replacing the inside of the system with nitrogen gas, a<br>
nitrogen mixed gas containing 7 vol% oxygen was introduced into a vapor phase unit<br>
followed by increasing the pressure inside the system to 5.0 MPa.<br>
Next, the reaction vessel was immobilized in an oil bath and a reaction was<br>
carried out for 2 hours at a reaction temperature of 60°C while stirring. After cooling,<br>
residual pressure was released and the autoclave was opened followed by filtering<br><br>
out the catalyst and analyzing the filtrate by gas chromatography.<br>

methacrylate selectivity was 95.7%.<br><br>

[Examples 5 to 10, Reference Example 6, Comparative Example 9]<br>
2 kg of silica sol (Snowtex N-30 manufactured by Nissan Chemical Industries,<br>
Ltd. (SiO2 content: 30 % by mass)) were added to 128 g of titania sol (STS-018<br>
manufactured by Ishihara Techno Co., Ltd. (TiO2 content: 30 % by mass)) and mixed<br>
followed by holding the slurry for 24 hours at 15°C and spray drying with a spray<br>
dryer set to an outlet gas temperature of 130°C to obtain a solid.<br>
Next, a silica-titania support was obtained by firing for 2 hours in air at 300°C<br>
and then for 3 hours at 600°C. The silica / titania ratio as oxides was 93.6 / 6.0.<br>

(1) Support Preparation<br>
An aqueous solution in which 4.16 kg of aluminum nitrate nonahydrate and 540<br>
g of 60% nitric acid were dissolved in 5.0 L of pure water was gradually dropped into<br>
20.0 kg of a stirred silica sol solution having a colloidal particle diameter of from 10 to<br>
20 nm held at 15°C (Snowtex N-30 manufactured by Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd.<br>
(SiO2 content: 30 % by mass)) to obtain a mixed slurry of silica sol and aluminum<br>
nitrate. Subsequently, the mixed slurry was aged by holding at 50°C for 24 hours.<br>
After cooling to room temperature, the mixed slurry was spray-dried with a spray<br>
dryer set to an outlet temperature of 130°C to obtain a solid.<br>
Next, the resulting solid was filled to a thickness of about 1 cm into a stainless<br>
steel container with the top being open followed by heating in an electric oven from<br>
room temperature to 300°C over the course of 2 hours and then holding at that<br>
temperature for 3 hours. After further heating to 600°C over the course of 2 hours<br>
followed by holding at that temperature for 3 hours, the solid was cooled gradually to<br>
obtain a silica-alumna support. The amount of aluminum in the resulting support<br>
was 10 mol% based on the total molar amount of silicon and aluminum. Specific<br>
surface area as determined according to the nitrogen adsorption method was 145<br>
m2/g, pore volume was 0.27 mL/g, and average pore diameter was 8 nm. The<br><br>
average particle diameter of the support based on the results of measuring with a<br>
laser diffraction particle size analyzer was 62 µm. In addition, the shape of the<br>
support was found to be nearly spherical based on observations with a scanning<br>
electron microscope (SEM).<br>
(2) Catalyst Production<br>
1.0 L of a solution containing 22.30 g of nickel nitrate hexahydrate and 20 mL of<br>
a 1.3 mol/L aqueous chloroauric acid solution was heated to 80°C. 300 g of the<br>
silica-alumina support obtained above were placed in this aqueous solution followed<br>
by adjusting the pH of the aqueous solution to 7 by addition of 0.5 N aqueous sodium<br>
hydroxide solution while holding at 80°C and stirring and continuing to stir for 1 hour<br>
to deposit the nickel and gold components onto the support.<br>
Next, after allowing to stand undisturbed, removing the supernatant and<br>
washing several times with distilled water, the liquid was filtered. After drying the<br>
filtrate for 16 hours at 105°C, the product was fired for 5 hours at 450°C in air to<br>
obtain a catalyst loaded with 1.43 % by mass of nickel and 1.45 % by mass of gold<br>
(NiOAu / SiO2-Al2O3). The atomic ratio of Ni / (Ni + Au) of the resulting catalyst was<br>
0.768, and the atomic ratio of Ni / Al was 0.144. Specific surface area as<br>
determined by the nitrogen adsorption method was 150 m2/g, pore volume was 0.28<br>
mL/g, and average pore diameter was 8 nm. The average particle diameter of the<br>
catalyst based on the results of measuring with a laser diffraction particle size<br>
analyzer was 61 µm. In addition, the shape of the catalyst was found to be nearly<br>
spherical based on observations with a scanning electron microscope (SEM).<br>
Based on the results of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), a diffraction pattern<br>
originating from nickel was not observed, and the nickel was confirmed to be present<br>
in an amorphous state. On the other hand, although not able to be defined as a<br><br>
well-defined peak, a broad peak was present corresponding to gold crystals.<br>
Although the value of this peak was close to the powder X-ray diffraction detection<br>
limit (2 nm), calculation of the average crystallite size using Scherrer's formula<br>
yielded a value of about 3 nm.<br>
With respect to the chemical state of the Ni, the valence was confirmed to be 2<br>
based on the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Moreover, the<br>
chemical state of nickel was presumed to be high-spin divalent nickel based on the<br>
results of high-resolution X-ray fluorescence (HRXRF), and was determined to have<br>
a chemical state different from that of nickel oxide which is a single compound, based<br>
on differences in Ni Ka spectra. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Ni<br>
Kα spectrum of the catalyst as obtained from the measured spectrum was 3.458 and<br>
the chemical shift (AE) was 0.331. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Ni<br>
Kα spectrum of nickel oxide measured as a standard substance was 3.249 and the<br>
chemical shift (AE) was 0.344.<br>
In addition, observation of the form of the active species of the catalyst with a<br>
transmission electron microscope (TEM/STEM) confirmed that nanoparticles having<br>
a maximum particle diameter distribution of from 2 to 3 nm (number average particle<br>
diameter: 3.2 nm) were loaded on the support. Observation of enlarged images of<br>
the nanoparticles demonstrated that the nanoparticles had a lattice pattern<br>
corresponding to the lattice spacing of Au (111). Analysis of composition points by<br>
STEM-EDS for each nanoparticle confirmed that nickel and gold were contained in<br>
each particle. The mean value of the ratio of nickel / gold atoms of the composite<br>
nanoparticles (number, of nanoparticles used for calculation: 50) was 0.83.<br>
Moreover, when nanoregions of the observed particles were analyzed, nickel was<br>
distributed over the gold in all particles, and larger amounts of nickel were detected<br>
around the particle edges.<br><br>
Next, as a result of investigating changes in the electron excitation state of this<br>
catalyst by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), surface plasmon absorption<br>
peaks originating from gold nanoparticles were not observed in the vicinity of 530 nm,<br>
while broad absorbance attributable to NiO2 was observed over a wavelength range<br>
from 200 to 800 nm.<br>
On the basis of these results, nanoparticles contained in the catalyst according<br>
to the present embodiment were confirmed to have a form in which the surface of<br>
gold nanoparticles is covered with nickel, and have a different surface electron state<br>
than that of gold nanoparticles comprised of a single metal species.<br><br>
(3) Synthesis of Carboxylic Acid Ester<br>
200 g of the catalyst obtained above (NiOAu / SiO2-AI2O3) were charged into a<br>
stirring reaction vessel made of stainless steel having a liquid phase unit of 1.2 liters<br>
and provided with a catalyst separator. An oxidative carboxylic acid ester formation<br>
reaction was then carried out using aldehyde and alcohol or one or more types of<br>
alcohols while stirring the contents of the reaction vessel at a stirrer tip speed of 4<br>
m/s. A 36.7 % by mass of methacrolein / methanol solution was continuously<br>
supplied to the reaction vessel at the rate of 0.6 liters / hr, while a 1 to 4 % by mass<br>
of NaOH / methanol solution was continuously supplied at the rate of 0.06 liters / hr,<br>
air was blown in such that the reaction temperature was 80°C and the outlet oxygen<br>
concentration at a reaction pressure of 0.5 MPa was 4.0 vol% (equivalent to oxygen<br>
partial pressure of 0.02 MPa), and the concentration of NaOH supplied to the<br>
reaction vessel was controlled so that the pH of the reaction system was 7. The<br>
reaction product was continuously extracted from the reaction vessel outlet by<br>
overflow, and the reactivity was investigated by analyzing by gas chromatography.<br>
After 200 hours from the start of the reaction, the methacrolein conversion rate<br><br>
was 61.5%, methyl methacrylate selectivity was 94.6%, and methyl methacrylate<br>
formation activity per catalyst unit weight was 7.60 mol/h/kg-cat. Reactivity after 500<br>
hours had elapsed did not change significantly, yielding a methacrolein conversion<br>
rate of 61.7%, methyl methacrylate selectivity of 94.7% and methyl methacrylate<br>
formation activity of 7.628 mol/h/kg-cat.<br>
In addition, when the concentrations of Ni, Au and Si ions in the reaction<br>
solution were analyzed by ICP-MS at 200 and 500 hours after the start of the reaction,<br>
Ni and Au were 0.1 ppm or less at both times and Si was 1 ppm or less at both times,<br>
thus confirming that exfoliation and elution of Ni and Au which are catalyst active<br>
species as well as elution of Si which is the support component were inhibited.<br>
When the catalyst was extracted after reacting for 500 hours and investigated with a<br>
scanning electron microscope (SEM), there was hardly any cracking or chipping of<br>
the catalyst particles observed. In addition, catalyst pore volume as determined by<br>
the nitrogen adsorption method was 0.28 mL/g and average pore diameter was 8 nm.<br>
Next, observation of the catalyst following the reaction with a transmission<br>
electron microscope (TEM/STEM) confirmed that nanoparticles having a maximum<br>
particle diameter distribution of from 2 to 3 nm (number average particle diameter:<br>
3.0 nm) were loaded on the support. Analysis of composition points by STEM-EDS<br>
for each nanoparticle confirmed that nickel and gold were contained in each<br>
nanoparticle. The mean value of the ratio of nickel / gold atoms of the composite<br>
nanoparticles (number, of nanoparticles used for calculation: 50) was 0.85. In<br>
addition, when nanoregions of the observed particles were analyzed, nickel was<br>
distributed over the gold in all particles, and larger amounts of nickel were detected<br>
around the particle edges. In addition, as a result of investigating changes in the<br>
electron excitation state of this catalyst by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis),<br>
surface plasmon absorption peaks originating from gold nanoparticles were not<br><br>
observed in the vicinity of 530 nm.<br>
On the basis of these results, catalyst physical properties and the structure of<br>
the nanoparticles of the present embodiment were confirmed to not have changed<br>
before and after the reaction.<br><br>

X-ray detector (EDX), and nickel and gold were confirmed in all of the particles. The<br>
atomic ratio of nickel to gold of these composite particles (mean value) was 0.81.<br>

[Example 24]<br>
An ethyl acrylate formation reaction was carried out using the same procedure<br>
and under the same reaction conditions as (3) of Example 17 with the exception of<br>
using the catalyst prepared in (2) of Example 17 (NiOAu / SiO2-Al2O3) and reacting<br>
acrolein instead of methacrolein and reacting ethanol instead of methanol.<br>
As a result, the acrolein conversion rate after reacting for 200 hours was 71.2%,<br><br>
ethyl acrylate selectivity was 96.2%, and ethyl acrylate formation activity per catalyst<br>
unit weight was 8.942 mol/h/kg-cat. Reactivity after 500 hours had elapsed did not<br>

[Example 25]<br>
(1) Support Production<br>
An aqueous solution in which 3.75 kg of aluminum nitrate nonahydrate, 2.56 kg<br>
of magnesium nitrate and 540 g of 60% nitric acid were dissolved in 5.0 L of pure<br>
water was gradually dropped into 20.0 kg of a stirred silica sol solution having a<br>
colloidal particle diameter of from 10 to 20 nm held at 15°C (Snowtex N-30<br>
manufactured by Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd. (SiO2 content: 30 % by mass)) to<br>
obtain a mixed slurry of silica sol, aluminum nitrate and magnesium nitrate.<br>
Subsequently, the mixed slurry was aged by holding at 50°C for 24 hours. After<br>
cooling to room temperature, the mixed slurry was spray-dried with a spray dryer set<br>
to an outlet temperature of 130°C to obtain a solid.<br>
Next, the resulting solid was filled to a thickness of about 1 cm into a stainless<br><br>
steel container with the top being open followed by heating in an electric oven from<br>
room temperature to 300°C over the course of 2 hours and then holding at that<br>
temperature for 3 hours. After further heating to 600°C over the course of 2 hours<br>
followed by holding at that temperature for 3 hours, the solid was cooled gradually to<br>
obtain a support. The amounts of silicon, aluminum and magnesium in the resulting<br>
support were 83.3 mol%, 8.3 mol% and 8.3 mol%, respectively, based on the total<br>
molar amount of silicon, aluminum and magnesium. Specific surface area as<br>
determined according to the nitrogen adsorption method was 148 m2/g, pore volume<br>
was 0.26 mL/g, and average pore diameter was 8 nm. The average particle<br>
diameter of the support based on the results of measuring with a laser diffraction<br>
particle size analyzer was 64 µm. In addition, the shape of the support was found to<br>
be nearly spherical based on observations with a scanning electron microscope<br>
(SEM).<br><br>
(2) Catalyst Preparation<br>
1.0 L of a solution containing 23.78 g of nickel nitrate hexahydrate and 19 mL of<br>
a 1.3 mol/L aqueous chloroauric acid solution was heated to 90°C. 300 g of the<br>
silica-alumina-magnesia support obtained above were placed in this aqueous<br>
solution followed by holding at 90°C while stirring and then continuing to stir for 1<br>
hour to deposit the nickel and gold components onto the support.<br>
Next, after allowing to stand undisturbed, removing the supernatant and<br>
washing several times with distilled water, the liquid was filtered. After drying the<br>
filtrate for 16 hours at 105°C, the product was fired for 3 hours at 500°C in air to<br>
obtain a catalyst loaded with 1.52 % by mass of nickel and 1.49 % by mass of gold<br>
(NiOAu / SiO2-AI2O3-Mgo). The atomic ratio of Ni / (Ni + Au) of the resulting catalyst<br>
was 0.774, the atomic ratio of Ni / Al was 0.179, and the atomic ratio of Ni / Mg was<br><br>
0.179. Specific surface area as determined by the nitrogen adsorption method was<br>
150 m2/g, pore volume was 0.28 mL/g, and average pore diameter was 5 nm.<br>
The average particle diameter of the catalyst based on the results of measuring<br>
with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer was 65 nm. The shape of the catalyst<br>
was found to be nearly spherical based on observations with a scanning electron<br>
microscope (SEM).<br>
Based on the results of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), a diffraction pattern<br>
originating from nickel was not observed, and the nickel was confirmed to be present<br>
in an amorphous state. On the other hand, although not able to be defined as a<br>
well-defined peak, a broad peak was present corresponding to gold crystals.<br>
Although the value of this peak was close to the powder X-ray diffraction detection<br>
limit (2 nm), calculation of the average crystallite size using Scherrer's formula<br>
yielded a value of about 3 nm.<br>
With respect to the chemical state of the Ni, the valence was confirmed to be 2<br>
based on the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Moreover, the<br>
chemical state of nickel was presumed to be high-spin divalent nickel based on the<br>
results of high-resolution X-ray fluorescence (HRXRF), and was determined to have<br>
a chemical state different from that of nickel oxide which is a single compound, based<br>
on differences in Ni Ka spectra. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Ni<br>
Ka spectrum of the catalyst as obtained from the measured spectrum was 3.489 and<br>
the chemical shift (AE) was 0.340. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Ni<br>
Ka spectrum of nickel oxide measured as a standard substance was 3.249 and the<br>
chemical shift (AE) was 0.344.<br>
In addition, observation of the form of the active species of the catalyst with a<br>
transmission electron microscope (TEM/STEM) confirmed that nanoparticles having<br>
a maximum particle diameter distribution of from 2 to 3 nm (number average particle<br><br>
diameter: 3.0 nm) were loaded on the support. Observation of enlarged images of<br>
the nanoparticles demonstrated that the nanoparticles had a lattice pattern<br>
corresponding to the lattice spacing of Au (111). Analysis of composition points by<br>
STEM-EDS for each nanoparticle confirmed that gold and nickel were contained in<br>
each nanoparticle. The mean value of the ratio of nickel / gold atoms of the<br>
composite nanoparticles (number of nanoparticles used for calculation: 50) was 0.85.<br>
Moreover, when nanoregions of the observed particles were analyzed, nickel was<br>
distributed over the gold in all particles, and larger amounts of nickel were detected<br>
around the particle edges.<br>
Next, as a result of investigating changes in the electron excitation state of this<br>
catalyst by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), surface plasmon absorption<br>
peaks originating from gold nanoparticles were not observed in the vicinity of 530 nm,<br>
while broad absorbance attributable to NiO2 was observed over a wavelength range<br>
from 200 to 800 nm.<br>
On the basis of these results, nanoparticles contained in the catalyst according<br>
to the present embodiment were confirmed to have a form in which the surface of<br>
gold nanoparticles is covered with oxidized nickel, and have a different surface<br>
electron state than that of gold nanoparticles comprised of a single metal species.<br><br>
(3) Synthesis of Carboxylic Acid Ester<br>
A reaction was carried out in the same manner as (3) of Example 17 using the<br>
catalyst obtained above (NiOAu / SiO2-AI2O3-MgO). As a result, the methacrolein<br>
conversion rate after reacting for 200 hours was 65.3%, methyl methacrylate<br>
selectivity was 96.1%, and methyl methacrylate formation activity per catalyst unit<br>
weight was 8.192 mol/h/kg-cat. Reactivity after 500 hours had elapsed did not<br>
change significantly, yielding a methacrolein conversion rate of 65.1%, methyl<br><br>
methacrylate selectivity of 96.0% and methyl methacrylate formation activity of 8.159<br>
mol/h/kg-cat.<br>
In addition, when the concentrations of Ni, Au and Si ions in the reaction<br>
solution were analyzed by ICP-MS at 200 and 500 hours after the start of the reaction,<br>
Ni and Au were 0.1 ppm or less at both times and Si was 1 ppm or less at both times,<br>
thus confirming that exfoliation and elution of nickel and gold which are catalyst<br>
active species as well as elution of silica which is the support component were<br>
inhibited. When the catalyst was extracted after reacting for 500 hours and<br>
investigated with a scanning electron microscope (SEM), there was hardly any<br>
cracking or chipping of the catalyst particles observed. In addition, catalyst pore<br>
volume as determined by the nitrogen adsorption method was 0.27 mL/g and<br>
average pore diameter was 5 nm. Moreover, observation of the catalyst following<br>
the reaction with a transmission electron microscope (TEM/STEM) confirmed that<br>
nanoparticles having a maximum particle diameter distribution of from 2 to 3 nm<br>
(number average particle diameter: 3.2 nm) were loaded on the support. Analysis of<br>
composition points by STEM-EDS for each nanoparticle confirmed that nickel and<br>
gold were contained in each nanoparticle. The mean value of the ratio of nickel /<br>
gold atoms of the composite nanoparticles (number of nanoparticles used for<br>
calculation: 50) was 0.82. Moreover, when nanoregions of the observed particles<br>
were analyzed, nickel was distributed over the gold in all particles, and larger<br>
amounts of nickel were detected around the particle edges. Next, as a result of<br>
investigating changes in the electron excitation state of this catalyst by<br>
ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), surface plasmon absorption peaks<br>
originating from gold nanoparticles were not observed in the vicinity of 530 nm.<br>
On the basis of these results, catalyst physical properties and the structure of<br>
the nanoparticles of the present embodiment were confirmed to not have changed<br><br>
before and after the reaction.<br><br>

present corresponding to gold crystals, and the average crystallite size was<br>
calculated to be 3.0 nm.<br>

measured spectrum was 3.480 and the chemical shift (AE) was 0.334. The full<br><br>

standard substance was 3.249 and the chemical shift (AE) was 0.344.<br>
In addition, observation of the form of the active species of the catalyst with a<br>
transmission electron microscope (TEM/STEM) confirmed that nanoparticles having<br>
a maximum particle diameter distribution of from 2 to 3 nm (number average particle<br>

was carried out on each observed nanoparticle by an ancillary energy-dispersive<br>
X-ray detector (EDX), and nickel and gold were confirmed to be contained in all of the<br>
particles. The atomic ratio of nickel to gold of these composite particles (mean<br>
value) was 0.79.<br>

methacrylate formation activity of 8.071 mol/h/kg-cat.<br>
In addition, when the concentrations of Ni, Au and Si ions in the reaction<br>

of using the silica-alumina support prepared in (1) of Example 17 for the support and<br>
not adding nickel nitrate hexahydrate. Based on the results of powder X-ray<br>
diffraction (XRD) of this catalyst, a broad peak was present corresponding to gold<br>
crystals. The average crystallite size as calculated according to Scherrer's formula<br>
was about 3 nm. When the form of the gold particles was observed with a<br>
transmission electron microscope (TEM), gold particles having a number average<br><br>
particle diameter of 3.5 nm were confirmed to be loaded onto the support. In<br>
addition, the specific surface area of the catalyst was 148 m2/g, the pore volume of<br>
the catalyst as determined by the nitrogen adsorption method was 0.29 mL/g, and the<br>
average pore diameter was 8 nm. Moreover, as a result of investigating changes in<br>
the electron excitation state of this catalyst by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy<br>
(UV-Vis), a surface plasmon absorption peak originating from gold nanoparticles was<br>
observed (at about 530 nm).<br>
A reaction was carried out in the same manner as (3) of Example 17 using this<br>
catalyst. As a result, the methacrolein conversion rate after reacting for 200 hours<br>
was 25.3%, methyl methacrylate selectivity was 80.5%, and methyl methacrylate<br>
formation activity per catalyst unit weight was 2.659 mol/h/kg-cat. Reactivity after<br>
500 hours had elapsed demonstrated decreases in reaction activity and selectivity,<br>
yielding a methacrolein conversion rate of 17.8%, methyl methacrylate selectivity of<br>
78.3% and methyl methacrylate formation activity of 1.819 mol/h/kg-cat.<br>
In addition, when the concentrations of Au and Si ions in the reaction solution<br>
were analyzed by ICP-MS at 200 and 500 hours after the start of the reaction, the<br>
concentrations of Au were 0.1 ppm or less at both times and the concentrations of Si<br>
were 1 ppm or less at both times. When the catalyst was extracted after reacting for<br>
500 hours and investigated with a scanning electron microscope (SEM), there was<br>
hardly any cracking or chipping of the catalyst particles observed. In addition,<br>
catalyst pore volume as determined according to the nitrogen adsorption method was<br>

diameter of the gold nanoparticles as determined with a transmission electron<br>
microscope (TEM) was 5.3 nm, and increased catalyst pore diameter and gold<br>
nanoparticle sintering were observed.<br><br><br>

to Scherrer's formula was about 3 nm. When the form of the gold particles was<br>
observed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM), gold particles having an<br>
average particle diameter of 3.4 nm were confirmed to be loaded onto the support.<br>
In addition, the specific surface area of the catalyst was 152 m2/g, the pore volume of<br>
the catalyst as determined by the nitrogen adsorption method was 0.25 mL/g, and the<br>
average pore diameter was 5 nm. Moreover, as a result of investigating changes in<br>

carboxylic acid esters at high selectivity from an aldehyde and alcohol or one or more<br>
types of alcohols, and demonstrates superior mechanical strength and chemical<br>

even after a long period of time has elapsed. In addition, there is hardly any<br>
occurrence of exfoliation or elution of nickel and component X which are catalyst<br>
active components, increased catalyst pore diameter or sintering of composite<br>
nanoparticles, thereby enabling the catalyst to maintain a high level of reactivity even<br>
after a long period of time has elapsed.<br>
