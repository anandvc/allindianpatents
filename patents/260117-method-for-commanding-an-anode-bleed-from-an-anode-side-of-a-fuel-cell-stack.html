COMPREHENSIVE METHOD FOR TRIGGERING ANODE BLEED EVENTS<br>
IN A FUEL CELL SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	This invention relates generally to a method for triggering an<br>
anode bleed from a fuel cell stack and, more particularly, to a method for<br>
triggering an anode bleed from split fuel cell stacks that includes triggering the<br>
bleed if an estimated concentration of nitrogen in the anode is greater than a<br>
predetermined threshold concentration, triggering the bleed if the absolute value<br>
of the difference between the average split stack cell voltages is greater than a<br>
predetermined threshold voltage, or triggering the bleed if the voltage spread of<br>
the fuel cell voltages in either of the split fuel cell stacks is greater than a<br>
predetermined threshold voltage.<br>
2.	Discussion of the Related Art<br>
[0002]	Hydrogen is a very attractive fuel because it is clean and can<br>
be used to efficiently produce electricity in a fuel cell. A hydrogen fuel cell is an<br>
electro-chemical device that includes an anode and a cathode with an electrolyte<br>
therebetween. The anode receives hydrogen gas and the cathode receives<br>
oxygen or air. The hydrogen gas is dissociated in the anode to generate free<br>
protons and electrons. The protons pass through the electrolyte to the cathode.<br>
The protons react with the oxygen and the electrons in the cathode to generate<br>
water. The electrons from the anode cannot pass through the electrolyte, and<br>
thus are directed through a load to perform work before being sent to the<br>
cathode.<br>
[0003]	Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are a<br>
popular fuel cell for vehicles. The PEMFC generally includes a solid polymer-<br>
electrolyte proton-conducting membrane, such as a perfluorosulfonic acid<br>
membrane. The anode and cathode typically include finely divided catalytic<br>
particles, usually platinum (Pt), supported on carbon particles and mixed with an<br>
ionomer. The catalytic mixture is deposited on opposing sides of the membrane.<br><br><br>
The combination of the anode catalytic mixture, the cathode catalytic mixture and<br>
the membrane define a membrane electrode assembly (MEA).<br>
[0004]	Several fuel cells are typically combined in a fuel cell stack<br>
to generate the desired power. For the automotive fuel cell stack mentioned<br>
above, the stack may include two hundred or more fuel cells. The fuel cell stack<br>
receives a cathode reactant gas, typically a flow of air forced through the stack<br>
by a compressor. Not all of the oxygen is consumed by the stack and some of<br>
the air is output as a cathode exhaust gas that may include water as a stack by-<br>
product. The fuel cell stack also receives an anode hydrogen reactant gas that<br>
flows into the anode side of the stack.<br>
[0005]	A fuel cell stack includes a series of bipolar plates<br>
positioned between the several MEAs in the stack, where the bipolar plates and<br>
the MEAs are positioned between two end plates. The bipolar plates include an<br>
anode side and a cathode side for adjacent fuel cells in the stack. Anode gas<br>
flow channels are provided on the anode side of the bipolar plates that allow the<br>
anode reactant gas to flow to the respective MEA. Cathode gas flow channels<br>
are provided on the cathode side of the bipolar plates that allow the cathode<br>
reactant gas to flow to the respective MEA. One end plate includes anode gas<br>
flow channels, and the other end plate includes cathode gas flow channels. The<br>
bipolar plates and end plates are made of a conductive material, such as<br>
stainless steel or a conductive composite. The end plates conduct the electricity<br>
generated by the fuel cells out of the stack. The bipolar plates also include flow<br>
channels through which a cooling fluid flows.<br>
[0006]	The MEAs are permeable and thus allow nitrogen in the air<br>
from the cathode side of the stack to permeate therethrough and collect in the<br>
anode side of the stack, referred to in the industry as nitrogen cross-over. Even<br>
though the anode side pressure may be slightly higher than the cathode side<br>
pressure, the cathode side partial pressures will cause air to permeate through<br>
the membrane. Nitrogen in the anode side of the fuel cell stack dilutes the<br>
hydrogen such that if the nitrogen concentration increases above a certain<br>
percentage, such as 50%, the fuel cell stack becomes unstable and may fail. It is<br><br><br>
known in the art to provide a bleed valve at the anode exhaust gas output of the<br>
fuel cell stack to remove nitrogen from the anode side of the stack.<br>
[0007]	It has been proposed in the art to provide stack order<br>
switching or anode flow-shifting in a fuel cell system that employs split stacks.<br>
Particularly, valves and plumbing in the system are provided so that the anode<br>
exhaust gas exiting a first sub-stack is sent to the anode of a second sub-stack,<br>
and the anode exhaust gas exiting the second sub-stack is sent to the anode of<br>
the first sub-stack in a cyclical manner.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008]	In accordance with the teachings of the present invention,<br>
a method is disclosed for triggering an anode bleed from split fuel cell stacks in a<br>
fuel cell system that employs anode flow-shifting. The method commands the<br>
bleed if any of three different conditions is met. Those conditions include that the<br>
concentration of nitrogen in the anode side of the split stacks is above a<br>
predetermined percentage, the voltage spread between the maximum cell<br>
voltage and the minimum cell voltage of two fuel cells in either split stack is<br>
greater than a predetermined spread voltage and the absolute value of the<br>
difference between the average cell voltage of the split stacks is greater than a<br>
predetermined voltage. The concentration of nitrogen in the anode can be<br>
determined in any suitable manner, such as by a nitrogen cross-over model or a<br>
sensor.<br>
[0009]	Additional features of the present invention will become<br>
apparent from the following description and appended claims taken in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0010]	Figure 1 is a schematic block diagram of a fuel cell system<br>
employing anode flow-shifting; and<br>
[0011]	Figure 2 is a flow chart diagram showing a process for<br>
triggering an anode bleed from the split stacks shown in figure 1, according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br><br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0012]	The following discussion of the embodiments of the invention<br>
directed to a method for triggering an anode bleed from split stacks in a fuel cell<br>
system is merely exemplary in nature, and is in no way intended to limit the<br>
invention or its applications or uses.<br>
[0013]	Figure 1 is a schematic block diagram of a fuel cell system 10<br>
including a first split fuel cell stack 12 and a second split fuel cell stack 14. A<br>
compressor 16 provides cathode input air on cathode input line 18 to the split<br>
stacks 12 and 14 through a normally closed cathode input valve 20. Cathode<br>
exhaust gas is output from the split stack 12 on line 24 and cathode exhaust gas<br>
is output from the split stack 14 on line 26 where the cathode exhaust gas is<br>
combined into a single cathode output line 28. A normally closed cathode back<br>
pressure valve 30 controls the flow of the cathode exhaust gas through the line<br>
28. A cathode by-pass line 32 between the input line 18 and the output line 28<br>
allows the cathode input air to by-pass the stacks 12 and 14. A normally closed<br>
by-pass valve 34 controls whether the cathode air by-passes the stacks 12 and<br>
14. If the valves 20 and 30 are closed and the valve 34 is open, then air from the<br>
compressor 16 will by-pass the stacks 12 and 14. Typically, a cathode<br>
humidification unit (not shown) will be provided at a suitable location in the<br>
cathode input line 18.<br>
[0014]	In this non-limiting embodiment, the split stacks 12 and 14<br>
employ anode flow-shifting where the anode reactant gas flows back and forth<br>
through the split stacks 12 and 14 at a predetermined cycle in a manner that is<br>
well understood to those skilled in the art. An injector 38 injects hydrogen gas<br>
from a hydrogen gas source 40 through anode line 42 to the split stack 12 and an<br>
injector 44 injects hydrogen gas from a hydrogen source 46 through anode line<br>
48 to the split stack 14 in an alternating sequence.<br>
[0015] A water separator 60 is coupled to the connector line 54 and<br>
collects water in the anode gas flow between the split stacks 12 and 14. A<br>
normally closed drain valve 62 can be employed that is periodically opened to<br>
vent the water to the cathode exhaust gas line 28 on line 64. Further, an anode<br>
exhaust gas purge valve 66 can be provided.<br><br><br>
[0016]	As discussed above, it is desirable to periodically bleed the<br>
anode side of the split stacks 12 and 14 to remove nitrogen from the anode side<br>
of the stacks 12 and 14 that may otherwise dilute the hydrogen and affect cell<br>
performance. Normally closed bleed valves 50 and 52 are provided for this<br>
purpose. When an anode bleed is commanded, the bleed valve 50 or 52 is<br>
opened and the bled anode exhaust gas is sent to the cathode exhaust gas line<br>
28 depending on which direction the anode gas is currently flowing. Particularly,<br>
if the hydrogen gas is being injected into the split stack 12 from the source 40<br>
when a bleed is triggered, then the bleed valve 52 is opened. Likewise, if the<br>
hydrogen gas is being injected into the split stack 14 from the source 46 when a<br>
bleed is triggered, then the bleed valve 50 is opened. The flow-shifting will<br>
typically occur several times during a normal bleed duration so that the bleed<br>
valves 50 and 52 have to be opened and closed several times in time with the<br>
flow switching.<br>
[0017] A method for controlling the bleed valves 50 and 52 is<br>
proposed so that nitrogen is effectively removed from the anode side of the split<br>
stacks 12 and 14, and an efficient use of the hydrogen is maintained. As will be<br>
discussed below, an anode bleed is commanded when any one of three separate<br>
conditions is met.<br>
[0018]	Figure 2 is a flow chart diagram 70 showing a process for<br>
commanding an anode bleed, according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. A driver power request is provided at box 72 that is a signal indicative<br>
of the current density being generated by the split stacks 12 and 14. The<br>
concentration or percentage of nitrogen in the anode side of the split stacks 12<br>
and 14 is determined in a proactive manner at box 74. A nitrogen cross-over<br>
model may be employed to determine the concentration of nitrogen in the anode<br>
side of the split stacks 12 and 14. Any suitable nitrogen cross-over model can be<br>
used for the purposes described herein, many of which are known in the art.<br>
Alternately, a sensor can be provided within the anode input flow line to provide a<br>
measurement of the nitrogen in the anode side of the split stacks 12 and 14 as<br>
long as it is robust enough for the wet fuel cell environment. A nitrogen bleed<br>
command is determined proactively in this manner because the bleed is not<br><br><br>
commanded until the nitrogen concentration becomes too high. This method is<br>
the primary method of triggering an anode bleed as long as the stack<br>
performance is stable, i.e., the stack voltages remain stable and uniform.<br>
[0019]	The driver power request signal and the concentration of<br>
nitrogen from the nitrogen model or the sensor measurement are sent to a<br>
decision diamond 76 that determines whether the concentration of nitrogen in the<br>
anode side of the split stacks 12 and 14 is greater than a predetermined<br>
threshold. If the concentration of nitrogen is above the predetermined threshold<br>
for a particular stack current density, then the algorithm initiates a bleed request<br>
at box 78.<br>
[0020]	The other two bleed triggers, sometimes referred to as<br>
bounce and spread, are characterized as reactive because they act as a safety<br>
once the stacks 12 and 14 become unstable. These methods look directly at cell<br>
voltages to characterize stack performance and stability.<br>
[0021] At the same time as the nitrogen concentration in the anode<br>
side of the split stacks 12 and 14 is being determined, the maximum voltage of<br>
the fuel cells in one of the split stacks 12 and 14 and a minimum voltage of the<br>
fuel cells in the same split stack 12 or 14 are determined from cell voltage<br>
measurements by the algorithm at box 80. The maximum and minimum cell<br>
voltages and the driver power request signal are sent to a decision diamond 82<br>
that determines whether the maximum cell voltage minus the minimum cell<br>
voltage is greater than a predetermined spread threshold. If the maximum cell<br>
voltage minus the minimum cell voltage is greater than the predetermined spread<br>
threshold, then it is determined that the stack is unstable. The algorithm<br>
determines that a nitrogen bleed is required to at least remove water from the<br>
anode flow field and provides the bleed request at the box 78. A large voltage<br>
spread between the maximum cell voltage and the minimum cell voltage is an<br>
indication of cell instability, which may be an indication of too much water in the<br>
anode side of the split stacks 12 and 14. This method of triggering an anode<br>
bleed is referred to in the art as the bounce method, and is a reactive technique<br>
for determining when an anode bleed is needed. The average cell voltage can<br>
be used instead of the maximum cell voltage.<br><br><br>
[0022]	The algorithm determines the average voltage of the fuel cells<br>
in both of the split stack 12 and the split stack 14 at box 84. The average cell<br>
voltages of the first and second split stacks 12 and 14 and the driver power<br>
request signal are sent to a decision diamond 86 that determines whether the<br>
absolute value of the difference between the first split stack average voltage and<br>
the second split stack average voltage is greater than a predetermined threshold.<br>
If the average cell voltage of the split stack 12 minus the average cell voltage of<br>
the split stack 14 is greater than a predetermined bounce threshold, then the<br>
algorithm also concludes that there is cell instability, probably from to much water<br>
in the anode flow field, and requests a bleed at the box 78. This process is a<br>
secondary indicator of nitrogen in the anode side of the split stacks 12 and 14,<br>
and is an excellent indicator of water accumulation in the second stack of a flow<br>
shifting system. This is the case because the second stack receives the lowest<br>
anode stoichiometry in the system until the flow is reversed. As water<br>
accumulates, stacks become especially anode stoichiometry sensitive.<br>
Therefore, this criterion adds an additional dimension to the determination of the<br>
concentration of nitrogen in the anode side.<br>
[0023] Therefore, if any of the three techniques discussed above for<br>
determining that a nitrogen bleed is necessary or desired occurs, then the<br>
algorithm commands the anode exhaust gas bleed at the box 78. Thus, the<br>
anode bleed can be more reliable than if only a single one of the techniques was<br>
used. The length of the bleed is determined by many factors, including the<br>
current density output of the split stacks 12 and 14, as is well understood in the<br>
art.<br>
[0024]	It may be desirable to implement yet another bleed trigger,<br>
according to another embodiment of the invention. The algorithm calculates the<br>
standard deviation of the individual fuel cell voltages of the split stacks 12 and 14<br>
at box 88. The standard deviation and the driver power request signal are<br>
provided to decision diamond 90 that determines if the standard deviation of the<br>
individual fuel cell voltages is greater than a predetermined standard deviation<br>
threshold, then the algorithm will trigger a bleed at box 78.<br><br><br>
[0025]	The threshold values referred to above can be adapted over<br>
the life of the split stacks 12 and 14. As the stacks age, cell voltages may<br>
become more spread out at a given stack current density. If the thresholds<br>
remain the same, the bleed command may be triggered all the time. Therefore,<br>
the thresholds can be increased as a function of stack hours. As an additional<br>
feature, this combination of triggers can act as variables to quantify stack<br>
stability. In other words, a stack is considered stable as long as neither the<br>
bounce nor the spread thresholds are exceeded. This can aide in post-<br>
processing and assessing the overall stack stability.<br>

deviation.<br><br><br><br>
ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
TITLE : "METHOD FOR COMMANDING AN ANODE BLEED FROM AN<br>
ANODE SIDE OF A FUEL CELL STACK"<br>
A method for triggering an anode bleed from split fuel cell stacks in a fuel cell<br>
system that employs anode flow-shifting. The method requests the bleed if any<br>
one of three different conditions are met. Those conditions include that the<br>
concentration of nitrogen in the anode side of the split stacks is above a<br>
predetermined percentage, the voltage spread between the maximum cell<br>
voltage and the minimum cell voltage of two fuel cells in the split stacks is<br>
greater than a predetermined spread voltage and the absolute value of the<br>
difference between the overall voltage of the two split stacks is greater than a<br>
predetermined voltage. The concentration of nitrogen in the anode can be<br>
determined in any suitable manner, such as by a nitrogen cross-over model or a<br>
sensor.</td>
