CONTROL  SYSTEM  FOR A MATERIAL HANDLING FACILITY;<br>
HATCH ASSOCIATES PTY. LTD., A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF AUSTRALIA, WHOSE ADDRESS IS THE HATCH BUILDING, 144 STIRLING STREET, PERTH WESTERN AUSTRALIA 6000, AUSTRALIA<br>
THE      FOLLOWING      SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
1<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to materials handling and dispatch systems including bulk material handling facilities, and in particular a control system and method for controlling the flow of materials in materials handling facilities. This invention has application in both batch and continuous material handling facilities.<br>
Background Art<br>
Material handling facilities of the type that the invention has greatest application in are large and complicated facilities such as bulk distribution and shipping facilities (e.g. iron ore export facilities, coal terminals, bulk grain receival, storage, and shipping facilities, etc) or material handling and processing facilities (e.g. material handling yards for power generation facilities, steel production facilities). . All materials handling facilities in which the invention has application are characterised by being made up of a collection of material handling equipment, which can be identified as having at least one entry point for the materials and at least one departure point for the materials, and more than one possible route along which material may be conveyed. The equipment may move the materials in space, that is over a distance (eg on a conveyor), or in time, as in storage and later redistribution (eg a hopper).<br>
A major disadvantage of any previous materials handling system, is that they require specific instructions and alternatives to be pre-programmed into their control systems, in order to operate and to change the manner in which they operate based on system feedback signals or inputs from a controller. As such, previous materials control systems are either limited in their potential responses to any given situation based on the number of route configurations that have been pre-programmed, or the systems are kept at a relatively simple level of complexity, so as to make the amount of programming required for total control achievable.<br>
2<br><br>
As the scope of control systems grow larger and become responsible for more than a simple defined purpose such as a factory production line, say to include all materials handling required for the for supply, manufacture, assembly, packaging and dispatch of materials, the effort required to pre-program every possible route in the control system becomes onerous, such that traditionally a compromise is made where only the normal operating routes are programmed in, and perhaps an alternative route for contingencies.<br>
Previously, manual decisions were made as to the required routing of materials around a materials handling facility (which may cover many hectares), which required significant manual programming effort of the control system prior to the operation of the control system. In order to modify a materials handling system so that it can operate in a manner not expressly described in its original control system programming, it is common for the materials handling system to require significant manual reprogramming of the control system before the revised control system is implemented and tested to meet the new materials handling plan. For large and complicated facilities, such as facilities which include a variety of sub control systems, this process may take more than a few weeks or months (including shutdowns and programming) to reconfigure test and commission the entire facility. Such delays in reconfiguration restrict the flexibility of the materials handling facility, and prevent complicated or short term processes such as sorting, mixing or blending from being performed by the existing materials handling system equipment during the transport of the materials from their source to their final destination.<br>
Due to the effort described above for implementing changes in the programming of traditional control systems, it is often not possible to re-test the entire system functionalities after each modification. It is common practice that only the components deemed to have been modified are tested, to reduce the impact of the testing and commissioning processes on the overall materials handling facility. Depending on the extent of the control system and the highly coupled nature of the material handling routes operation, such reprogramming has a high risk of introducing undesirable errors into the system that may cause disruption to existing system functionality; resulting in costly delays to existing production. It is<br>
3<br><br>
normal operation for a trade off to be made between the amount of testing and the risk of introducing errors in the control system programming.<br>
The inflexibility imposed on materials handling facilities where a only a subset of the total possible routing combinations have been pre-programmed, where the limitation on the size of the subset is due usually to the economics of implementing additional routing combinations in comparison with the likelihood that such additional route combinations will be required or will provide an advantage at a later time, can provide disadvantages to the operational performance of the materials handling system when events occur which impact on the ability of the system to perform as planned, or production requirements change the performance required of the materials handling system. For example, in the case of equipment breakdown in downstream equipment, in hitherto known arrangements, it is usually necessary to stop all upstream equipment until repairs are effected and the equipment recommissioned, as the control system of the materials handling system is unlikely to have an alternate route pre-programmed which can redirect the materials to the required destination, for every such contingency.<br>
Although control systems for materials handling equipment do exist where every possible route is manually pre-programmed, they are traditionally smaller, self-contained systems or merely sub-systems of a larger overall materials handling facility.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a control system for a material handling facility having at least one source, at least one destination, and at least one transport route connecting said at least one source and said at least one destination, and more than one possible route along which material may be conveyed.<br>
Throughout the specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers but not the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers.<br>
4<br><br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the invention there is provided a control system for a material handling facility having at least one source, at least one destination, a plurality of transporters connecting said at least one source and said at least one destination, and more than one possible route along which material may be conveyed, said system including interface means interfacing with control means for controlling each said transporter,<br>
said control system including a database to store operating specifications for each said transporter, and also store equipment configuration and interconnection data for said material handling facility,<br>
said control system including a configuration module adapted to determine possible transport routes from said equipment configuration and inter-connection data,<br>
wherein said database stores equipment configuration and inter-connection data on a single source to single destination routes basis,<br>
and wherein said configuration module utilises an overlay methodology of said single source to single destination routes to determine multiple source and/or multiple destination transport route configurations and/or source, destination, transport route variations, before said control system implements determined configurations or variations via said interface means.<br>
Preferably said configuration module utilises an overlay methodology of a subset of said single source to single destination routes to determine multiple source and/or multiple destination transport route configurations and/or source, destination, transport route variations, before said control system implements determined configurations or variations via said interface means.<br>
The configuration module and database may form part of a computer or a PLC (programmable logic controller) or any other device or combination of devices capable of performing computational tasks and storing data. Similarly the control means may be any device capable of controlling a transporter device. The interface means may be any device capable of interfacing between the control means and the control system.<br>
5<br><br>
Preferably each said source and each said destination have an associated said transporter connecting with at least one further transporter. The transporters associated with specific sources may comprise without limitation, material conveyors such as belt-type conveyors, discharge gates, augers, or other dispensers, or any type of material transport where material flow or flow rate can be controlled. The transporters associated with specific destinations may comprise, without limitation, material conveyors such as belt-type conveyors, ship loaders, or stackers. The function of such associated transporters is to convey material between sources and destinations and the further transporters. The term "transporter" includes within its scope, positioning equipment to change a flowpath, such as gates and shuttles, and storage means to hold and later despatch materials along an overall route.<br>
Preferably said control system is arranged to implement live configuration changes. In this manner a new transport route can be implemented while the old transport route continues to operate.

Preferably said control system is arranged to perform real-time simulation of said material handling facility operations. In this manner, a variety of configuration changes may be simulated before implementation of the selected configuration.<br>
The invention provides, in a preferred form, a control system for material handling facilities where transport route definition is simplified to an overlay of a subset of possible single source to single destination routes. Data pertaining to possible single source to single destination routes is stored for retrieval and use by the control system. To achieve material handling from one or more sources to one or more destinations, passing through one or more connecting transporters,, the single source to single destination route definition data for each of the desired configurations, being a subset of the possible single source to single destination routes, is overlaid. This obviates the need for separate storage of transport route definition data for all possible transport route combinations, which in a complex material handling facility could be many more times the number of single source-<br>
6<br><br>
single destination routes. As a consequence, the control system programming required to provide total control and simulation of a material handling facility operation is vastly simplified.<br>
Preferably said configuration module groups the overlaid single source to single destination routes so the control system can operate them as an entity.<br>
Preferably said control system includes means to monitor at least some of said transporters, sources, or destinations to determine any event of equipment failure and raise an alarm or exert over-riding control over said material handling facility.<br>
Preferably the interface means incorporates processor means which implements configurations determined by said configuration module. The processor means may conveniently comprise one or more programmable logic controllers. The processor means may include any equivalent device capable of being programmed in order to control the control means associated with the transporters.<br>

Preferably said control system includes an operator interface having further processor means, independent from processor means of said configuration module and said interface means.<br>
Also in accordance with the invention there is provided a method of controlling a material handling facility having at least one source, at least one destination, a plurality of transporters connecting said at least one source and said at least one<br>

Best Mode(s) for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The system configuration for a complicated material handling facility is capable of handling a large number of routes and hundreds of items of equipment including, car dumpers, conveyors, shuttles, gates, splitters, trippers, processing plant, shiploaders, reclaimers, stackers, feeders and sample stations. To control such a facility it is necessary to define and store system configurations. The control system of the invention achieves this with a system configuration database which is managed using a configuration module. Once each of the equipment configurations are defined (e.g. what are the upstream equipment and downstream equipment, the equipment control attributes, etc), the configuration module has a route-generator that automatically establishes all possible single source to single destination routes between each of the sources and destinations. For brevity and convenience the single source to single destination routes will hereafter be referred to as base routes. Each base route passes along a single linear pathway, through a linear connection of transporters. These base routes can then be overlaid to form all desired route combinations, however as will be understood from the following description, it is only necessary to overlay a subset of the base routes in order to describe the entirety of feasible routes in the facility, which vastly simplifies the programming and operation of the facility, and change implementation in the facility.<br>
The equipment control attributes specify the operational parameters of equipmen included in the material handling facility. This includes, without limitation:<br>
10<br><br>
downstream equipment - which equipment can it feed to downstream, upstream equipment - which equipment can feed burden onto it,<br>
feed point from upstream equipment (distance in metres), for example<br>
where there are multiple feed points along a conveyor,<br>
whether the equipment is capable of variable speed operation,<br>
whether the equipment is capable reverse operation,<br>
full speed (m/s),<br>
drive power (kW), and<br>
stopping distance (m) - distance it takes to stop after receiving a stop command.<br>
In order to control the equipment, the control system must communicate via interface means using control means in the form of equipment controlling Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). The control means may typicaliy be from different vendors such as GE Fanuc 90/70, GE Series Six and Allen Bradley ControlLogix. The communication in a retro-fitting application could typically be over 5 different communication networks such as Allen Bradley Ethernet, GE Fanuc 90/70 Ethernet over FDDI, Allen Bradley ControlNet and GE Fanuc Genius.<br>
To better understand the invention, the following explanation will be given in relation to a simplified material handling facility, shown in figure 1. Traditionally, a route has been defined as an entity consisting of a combination of source(s) to a combination of destination(s) with each route combination counted as a separate entity. The material handling system shown in figure 1 comprises a material handling facility with three sources (a car dumper 11, a processing plant 13, and a reclaimer 15) and three destinations (a shiploader 17, a stacker 19, and a tripper 21) and associated transporters in the form of conveyors A, B, C, E, F, and G. Conveyors A, B, and C lead to a conveyor D, which discharges to conveyors E, F, and G. The number of route combinations in the material handling system shown in figure 1, based upon traditional route definition totals 49. Traditionally each route combination had a hard coded sequencing control algorithm. Consequently any plant upgrade that<br>
11<br><br>
changed the number of routes in a plant controlled by a traditional control system, would require weeks to months of control system modifications.<br>
Using the traditional definition discussed above, the number of routes is determined by a combinatorial analysis problem. The possible routes formed with<br>
m sources that can be linked to n destinations is:<br><br><br>
The possible combination of sources =<br><br><br>
The possible combination of destinations =<br><br><br>
Total Route Combinations =<br><br>
In the system of the invention with a route definition based on a Single-Source-Single-Destination definition model, the total number of base routes for m sources and n destinations with a single pathway is mC1 nC1<br>
The reduction in number of routes to be programmed using single source-single destination definition compared to a traditional definition is:<br><br>
It will be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art, that the inclusion of more than one possible route between a range of sources and a range of destinations, will further increase the advantage of the single source to single destination route definition. For L possible routes between the m sources and n destinations the advantage of using this route definition compared to a traditional definition is:<br><br>
It will be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art, that the inclusion of more than one stage of possible route equipment and routes between the said sources and said destinations will similarly further increase the advantage of the route definition applied by the invention compared to the traditional definition.<br>
12.<br><br>
Table 1 (below) compares the number of routes in the control system route definition of the invention against those defined using traditional route definition. Note that Table 1 assumes theoretical scenarios where all the sources and destinations are connected via a single piece of transporting equipment. This may not be the case in practice, hence the comparison of the number of routes in a real system may differ. Using the single source to single destination route definition, the number of routes in a complicated material handling facility can be reduced from over 400,000 in a traditional system to less than 250 overlaid single source to single destination routes.<br><br>

Table 1: Comparison of Single Source - Single Destitution (SSSD) Route Definition versus Traditional (Trad.) Definition<br>
Referring to figure 1, the single source to single destination routes are A-D-E, A-D-F, A-D-G, B-D-E, B-D-F, B-D-G, C-D-E, C-D-F, and C-D-G. More complicated routes involving more than one source and/or more than one destination are achieved by overlaying base routes. Overlaid base routes can be operated independently or be grouped by the control system so that they can be operated as an entity, for example, synchronised starting, stopping and defined auto-divert (for a diverging route overlaid combination) and blending characteristics (for converging route overlaid combination). To achieve (A+B)-D-E, routes A-D-E and B-D-E are overlaid by the control system. A complicated route such as (A+B)-D-(E+F+G) which traditionally would have required individual configuration by a control system can therefore be defined as the overlay of a subset of the base routes being three of these base routes, ie A-D-E, B-D-F, and either of A-D-G or B-D-G.<br>
13<br><br>
The control system overlaid base route operation concepts allow route equipment to be seamlessly shared by multiple routes; so that material flow-path can be changed by overlaying new base routes and removing old base routes which are no longer needed whilst common equipment is kept running. This allowance for 'hot-swapping' of routes reduces valuable production downtime. It does not impose any structural limits to the maximum number of split/combined/blending routes other than the maximum number of concurrent base routes that can operate within the system.<br>
Most route sequencing control systems use conservative interlocking concepts where upstream equipment is not permitted to run unless downstream equipment is running, irrespective of whether there is burden on the equipment. The control system of the invention tracks the burden on each item of the route equipment. This enables the use of a material interlock strategy where upstream equipment can continue to run despite stoppages to downstream equipment. Upstream equipment is stopped only if there is burden within the gross stopping distance of the feed-point of the stopped equipment. This strategy minimises the downtime of routes and improves productivity by allowing the burden to be preloaded closer to the destination even when equipment in the route has faulted.<br>
The control system of the invention also uses the burden tracking information on each individual route equipment to allow faster startup of routes, as it automatically starts-up all equipment that are free of burden simultaneously.<br>
The control system of the invention has a centralised system database that can be modified using a configuration module. This allows control behaviour to be defined and modified globally and downloaded to interface means in the form of a master Programmable Logic Controller (PLC).<br>
Configurable control functionality is achieved by having a structure with two distinct components:<br>
•	Pre-configured selection of control rules and algorithms in the master PLC<br>
•	Configurable attributes such as route recipes (configurations), strategies, schemas and equipment attributes; are set up using the configuration<br>
14<br><br>
module and downloaded to the Master PLC. These attributes are the modifiers that provide the control parameters and enable/disable the selection of pre-configured control rules and algorithms. This approach eliminates the need to change the operation of the control algorithms.<br>
Using this arrangement, the control system allows new equipment and its associated base routes to be speedily integrated into the system in a matter of minutes.<br>
The control system incorporates within its programming, a full audit trail of changes to all configurable data (e.g. route, schema, equipment attributes). This facilitates the management of system data and data integrity. Further security is provided by providing all of the configured data downloaded from the configuration module with a checksum. The master PLC has an integrity verification algorithm that detects and reports any data corruption and can be configured to take the necessary shutdown procedure to ensure safe operation of the material handling facility.<br>
The control system also monitors any product incompatibility along any route. Upon detection of any product mismatch, the operator is alerted and a pre-configured action is executed such as disabling source from feeding.<br>
The control system is designed to minimise any unnecessary tripping under fault conditions. For example, a route group can be configured to have an automatic divert capability. If equipment faults in one of the segments downstream, the system can automatically divert upstream burden to another healthy branch to maintain production. On recovery of the faulted branch, the system can automatically return the diverted equipment back to the pre-configured position. The control system monitors the dynamic loading of each transport equipment and automatically protects the equipment from any overloading by reducing the speed of upstream transport equipment so as to reduce the effective discharge rate.<br>
15<br><br>
The control system includes a unique algorithmic alarm and event messaging system, allowing messages to be constructed dynamically. This facilitates a more comprehensive and diagnostic information system for faster faultfinding and fault recovery. Furthermore, it reduces the complexity of alarm management by facilitating the filtering and classification of alarms.<br>
The control system logs all critical event, process and alarms. This allows reconstruction of scenarios and facilitates determination of root causes of problems.<br>
The following description assumes the reader is proficient in control systems and software and programming architecture, has an understanding of programmable logic controllers (PLCs), operator interfaces and database programming, and has some familiarity with material handling automation.<br>
Referring to figure 2 the control system of the embodiment of the invention is shown in block schematic. The control system comprises a configuration module 31, an operator interface system 33, and interface means in the form of PLC equipment 35. The PLC equipment 35 comprises a master PLC 37 which is an Allen Bradley ControlLogix PLC with three CPUs. The first CPU (HPTMC) is arranged to process user commands and performing route sequencing functions. The second CPU (HPTMP) is arranged to provide for burden tracking and management burden bading along the route. The third CPU (HPTMM) is provided to handle the critical interlocking between equipment to prevent spillage between equipment. The master PLC 37 interfaces with generic PLCs 39 for controlling equipment in the materials handling facility. Also included in the interface means 35 are additional PLCs 41 for interfacing with and controlling legacy PLC equipment 43.<br>
The configuration module 31 provides a centralised engineering interface for defining, maintaining and downloading route and equipment attributes to the<br>
master PLC 37 and the operator interface system 33. The configuration module 31 is designed to be a purely configuration tool with no real-time control responsibility, ensuring robustness and high availability.<br>
16<br><br>
The operator interface system 33 provides a user interface for operating the control system, providing route status and control function such as start, stop, and preload route commands, logging of the critical data in master PLC 37 so that in the event of a major fault that requires replacement of the master PLC 37, the data can be downloaded to the replacement master PLC so as to minimise the time required for system recovery. The operator interface system 33 has been designed to have no real time control responsibility, so that the system tolerates temporary loss of the operator interface system 33. This contributes to higher availability and robustness.<br>
Referring to figures 3 to 12, software architecture of the control system of the embodiment will now be described.<br>
In order to achieve the flexibility of a configurable route control system, the control system software has an architecture which can be subdivided into a pre-configured selection of control rules and generic control algorithms which are stored as software routines in the main Master PLC 37 in the configuration module 31. The behaviour of these rules can only be changed by modifying the software.<br>
These configurable attributes are created by using the configuration module 31 and then downloaded to the master PLC 37 and the operator interface system 33 as shown in figure 3. The configuration module 31 is only required for creating or updating the configuration, it is not needed during the route operations.<br>
Figure 3b shows the key software architecture of the operator interface component 33 of the control system and its data flow to the programmable controller component 37. This architecture makes this operator interface component modular and portable so that it can be easily re-deployed on other operator interface system platforms.   As stated above the master PLC 37 has<br>
three CPUs identified as HPTMC, HPTMP, and HPTMM. The first CPU (HPTMC) in addition to processing user commands from the operator interface system 33 and performing route sequencing functions, also issues alarms to the operator interface system 33, handles the configuration download interface and data validation from the<br>
17<br><br>
configuration module 31, and interfaces to other external systems such as power load management systems, product gap management systems, and dust management systems.<br>
Figure 4 (comprising figures 4a, 4b, and 4c) shows the key control system object model abstraction. The following rules apply:<br>
•	A Route can only be owned by one Control Room at any one time.<br>
•	A Route may contain up to 28 Equipment Items and a route is formed based on the linkages between each of the equipment items.<br>
•	A Route may have a number of associated Overlaid Routes, however, a Route is only allowed to associate to one Route Group.<br>
•	A Route Group may include a number of Routes (Note that although the control system allows 28 routes to be grouped, due to the limit on maximum number of converging and diverging point behaviour specifications, the permissible number of routes in a route group has been limited to 6 - note this is a configurable parameter in the configuration module).<br>
•	A Route Group may have a maximum 6 Configured Diverge and 6 Configured Converge working behaviours.<br>
•	Equipment can have a number of Overlaid Routes as its owner (up to 28 Routes).<br>
It should be noted that the above limits apply to this particular embodiment, and are determined by the requirements for a particular notional materials handling facility. In an alternative embodiment, these limits could readily be increased.<br>
Each equipment item can be "owned" by. multiple routes. As shown in figure 5, each determined route gives rise to a command to operate a relevant item of equipment. The PLC equipment 37 of the control system uses the downloaded configuration from the configuration module 31 and resolves multiple commands from the various routes to generate a single equipment command. This single equipment command is then sent out to physical equipment, provided the control system does not detect a need to trip this equipment. A decision in relation to tripping of the equipment is made based on sensing an overload condition or<br><br>
downstream equipment failure or failure in the equipment itself, in order to prevent occurrence of any spillage. The control system uses the downloaded route configuration to define the tripping requirement.<br>
Control system alarms are multiplexed and transmitted to the operator interface system 33 (identified as HPT_OIS in figure 3a and 3b) via an event/alarm message tag which is an integer variable. Each master PLC processor will send its own alarm messages to the operator interface system 33. Each master PLC processor has its own series of First-in-first-out (FIFO) buffer event/alarm message queues (one per route). In order to ensure that the operator interface system 33 10 server has sufficient time to read the message, each message is shifted out to a HPT_OIS tag via a timer.<br>
This alarm messaging system provides benefits where it facilitates production of customised operator information to provide the required level of alarm/message detail, and removes the need to hard-code route information into Citect alarm system.<br>
The operator interface system 33 event server monitors for new messages and once triggered, the HPT_OIS routine will decide which unused generic alarm (disk based PLC tag) to use - including what type of generic alarm (eg. alarm, warning or log). The routine will store extra information, such as Time Stamp, and Description on a corresponding 'Extra Information' disk based PLC tags for later reference. The routine will then switch the generic alarm tag on so that an alarm will occur. The routine will also store a control system message on a disk based PLC for later display.<br>
Once the alarm occurs, the description field for the alarm can be obtained from the alarm description routine which can be activated by performing a Point Detail (Control-P) with cursor on the alarm item. The alarm description routine will use the corresponding 'Extra Information' disk based PLC to determine the description for the alarm. This generic alarm with specific description will appear on the alarm banner or alarm page display.<br>
14<br><br>
The alarms generated via this messaging method will be removed if the message has not been reported within the pre-configured time delay.<br>
The control system incorporates a unified product code (UPC) which may be assigned to materials being transported. The UPC is specified by a 16 bit integer consisting of two components. The 12 least significant bits of the integer specifies the origin of the product (e.g. in an ore shipping facility, the mine from which the ore was sourced), and the 3 most significant bits of the integer specifies the refined product classification (e.g. in an ore shipping facility, fines, lumps and high grade)<br>
The UPC definition has been designed to facilitate determination of product compatibility. Compatibility of Product A and Product B can be determined by simply performing a logical AND operation between the Compatibility Matrix of Product A and the UPC of Product B. If these are products are compatible the result of the ANDed operation should equal the UPC of Product B.<br>
As indicated in figure 3, each object has its own configuration (e.g. configurable attributes) which are configured by configuration module 31 and then transferred to the operator interface system 33 and PLC equipment 37 for control and operation respectively. For example, a route object configuration includes route recipes (configurations) which specify the sequential order of starting and stopping the equipment within the route both during a startup, shutdown or fault situation.<br>
As indicated in figures 4 and 5, in order to enable the overlaid routes operation, each base route has its own commands for each of the equipment. These logical route commands for each equipment are then resolved to provide the physical command to the equipment. Figure 6 and 7 shows typical command resolution for operating transporter equipment. Figures 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 shows typical command resolution for operating positioning transporter equipment (equipment which can change the direction of flowpath of material). All of this is implemented in the interface means provided by the master PLC 37 in the configuration module 31.<br>
20<br><br>
The embodiment of the invention provides a highly flexible and configurable route selection and sequencing system for controlling large bulk material handling facilities. The system of the embodiment has a generic control algorithm that can be configured to suit any material handling facility. The system can also be easily reconfigured to cater to plant expansion or modifications without incurring significant costs in testing and re-commissioning, thus achieving cost savings throughout a facility's lifecycle.<br>
Using the single source-single destination route definition concept, the system of the invention lessens the complexity of the facilities control system. For example in a system having over 500 items of interconnected route equipment controlled by more than 60 dedicated equipment PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), the route definition concept embodied in the invention reduces the number of routes from over. 400,000 to less than 250 base routes. The system architecture also takes advantage of the current generation of industrial controllers with multiple-processors to ensure good performance and robustness.<br>
The system of the invention offers the following productivity improvements:<br>
•	A unique overlaid route control concept that minimises down-time during flowpath changes, allowing hot swapping of routes without stopping common equipment.<br>
•	A material-interlocking strategy that improves production availability by allowing simultaneous startup of transport equipment without burden and, under route-faulted conditions, and allows upstream transport equipment to continue to run unless spillages would occur.<br>
•	A unique overlaid route equipment control concept that minimises downtime during flowpath changes, allowing hot swapping of routes without stopping common equipment.<br>
•	Fault management strategies that minimises downtime, for example, automatically diverts on fault - redirects burden away from a faulted downstream branch to a pre-configured alternative route.<br>
•	A burden management strategy that prevents overbad of route equipment by automatically reducing the speed of transport equipment to<br>
21<br><br>
prevent the discharge overloading its downstream equipment, and clamps source feed rate to the dynamic route capacity.<br>
•	A user-interface,  alarm,   advisory and   process  log  system that<br>
minimises fault recovery time by providing diagnostic information with an audit trail.<br>
The system of the invention has the advantage of being able to simulate the entire facility off-line, with the performance and restrictions of the real equipment simulated. The system further uses a novel system to define the possible configurations and combinations of equipment in the facility, which can then be compared to provide the optimal solution of configuration for the desired production outcomes. The chosen configuration can then be downloaded to program the various PLC controllers on the site to reconfigure the system. In a complex facility, this reduces the time taken to reconfigure the material handling to a few hours. This time saving facilitates ease of plant optimisation and reduces the maintenance of cost associated to plant upgrades which involves additional/removal of equipment or flowpaths.<br>
Various modifications are contemplated to the control system of the embodiment, that would provide improvements or enhancement to the functionality and usefulness of the system. These include adding an inventory tracking system to allow tracking of accumulated batch material delivered from a source or to a destination for higher level manufacturing execution system or business information system. It is also contemplated to add a production feed control system to coordinate the feed rate setpoint from the various converging sources to control the production rate and prevent overloading the routes.<br>
In addition it is contemplated that product gap management could be added to allow automatic management of generation/termination of product gaps along the<br>
route to facilitate movement or cleaning of equipment (such as mobile machines, trippers, offline position devices) without the need of shutdown the route(s).<br>
It is also contemplated that additional functionality which includes product tracking to facilitate both quantity tracking and inventory tracking could be added.<br>
22.<br><br>
Furthermore, production scheduling and production control functionality could be added to further automate and enhance the system to provide complete control systems to incorporate enterprise resource planning integration.<br>
Additional processors may be added to master PLC 37 or the additional PLCs 41 to manage any additional functionality and achieve faster system response time. Furthermore, the master PLC 37 software could be re-deployed on other PLC platforms that support IEC1131-3 language to suit the intended user's preference on the type control system platform. In addition, the operator interface component 33 could also be re-deployed on any other operator interface that support ActiveX technology to suit the intended user's preference on the operator interface platform.<br>
Other modifications considered include allowing pre-definition of route groups and their associated configuration and downloading this information into the interface means. In the embodiment as described, route group characteristics are only defined after the route has been activated.<br>
It is also possible to have multiple control systems according to the invention working together, with interconnect routes belonging to a separate control system according to the invention.<br>
It should be appreciated that changes may be made to various features in the above described embodiment without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, and that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiment described herein.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
A material handling system and method for a material handling facility is disclosed. Illustrated as an example, is a simplified material handling facility with three sources (a car dumper (11), a processing plant (13), and a reclaimer (15)) and three destinations (a shiploader (17), a stacker (19), and a tripper (21)) and associated transporters in the form of conveyors (A, B, C, E, F), and (G). Conveyors (A, B), and (C) lead to a conveyor (D), which discharges to conveyors (E, F), and (G). The number of route combinations in the material handling system is (49). The control system and method of the invention controls the material handling facility using a database which is managed using a configuration module. Once each of the equipment configurations are defined (e.g. what are the upstream equipment and downstream equipment, the equipment control attributes, etc), the configuration module has a route-generator that automatically establishes all possible base routes between each of the sources and destinations. These base routes are then be overlaid to form all desired route combinations. The equipment in the material handling facility is then controlled in accordance with requirements, based on the determined routes, and availability and capacity of the equipment.<br>
