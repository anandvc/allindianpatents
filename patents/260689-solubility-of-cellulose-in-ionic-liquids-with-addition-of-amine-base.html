Solubility of cellulose in ionic liquids with addition of amine base<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a solution comprising cellulose and an ionic liquid as solvent, a process for preparing it and its use.<br>
Cellulose is a very versatile raw material. In the textile industry, cellulose is, for example, the most important constituent of fiber raw materials, in particular of cotton.<br>
Cellulose can be used unchanged or after physical or chemical treatment. In the latter two cases, it is advantageous for cellulose to be in preferably completely dissolved form in a solvent. However, cellulose is insoluble in most solvents.<br>
Cellulose is soluble as a copper chelate complex in some copper solutions. Regenerated cellulose can be obtained by precipitation of the cellulose. However, such copper solutions are not very suitable as solvents for cellulose in the case of physical or chemical treatment of the cellulose.<br>
For this reason, the systems known, inter alia, as ionic liquids in the literature were proposed very early on as solvents for cellulose.<br>
Thus, US-A 1,943,176 describes the dissolution of cellulose in benzylpyridinium chloride.<br>
As an example of an ionic liquid, benzylpyridinium chloride is a salt which is present in molten form and thus as a liquid at comparatively low temperatures.<br>
Ionic liquids are becoming increasingly important as solvents, e.g. for carrying out chemical reactions. Peter Wasserscheidt, Angew. Chem. 2000, 112, 3926-3945, for example, gives an overview of the use of ionic liquids in transition metal catalysis.<br><br>
Ionic liquids which are present in the liquid state even at room temperature are described, for example, by K.N. Marsh et al.. Fluid Phase Equilibria 219 (2004), 93-98, and J.G. Huddleston et al., Green Chemistry 2001, 3, 156-164.<br>
DE-A 102 02 838 describes the use of ionic liquids for separating acids from chemical mixtures.<br>
Owing to the good solvent capabilities of ionic liquids, their use for the dissolution of cellulose is also proposed in the more recent international patent application WO-A 03/029329. However, it is emphasized there that such a solution comprises cellulose and an ionic liquid as solvent must comprise essentially no nitrogen-comprising bases.<br>
Although the characteristics of the cellulose-comprising solution and its preparation described in WO-A 03/029329 have good results, there is a need to provide improved solutions.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a solution of dissolved cellulose which displays improved properties.<br>
The object is achieved by a solution comprising cellulose, an ionic liquid comprising anions and cations as solvent and from 6 to 30% by weight of a nitrogen-comprising base, based on the total weight of the solution.<br>
It has been found that when a nitrogen-comprising base is added in the concentration range indicated, an improvement in the properties of the solution, for example in respect of the dissolution rate of the cellulose, a lower viscosity and a reduction in the melting point of the ionic liquid can be achieved at least partly.<br>
The cellulose to be dissolved can originate from, for example, regenerated cellulose, fibrous cellulose, wood fibers, lint, cotton or paper.<br>
It is preferred that, in the solution of the present invention, more than 1% by weight of cellulose, based on the total weight of the solution, are completely dissolved. More preferably, more than 3% by weight, particularly preferably more than 5% by weight and in particular at least 7% by weight, based on the total weight of the solution, are completely dissolved.<br><br>
Advantageously, up to 35% by weight of cellulose, based on the total weight of the solution, can be completely dissolved. Furthermore, up to 25% by weight of cellulose, based on the total weight of the solution, can be completely dissolved. Solutions in which up to 15% by weight of cellulose are completely dissolved are especially suitable for particular applications.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, ionic liquids are preferably salts of the general formula<br><br>
where n is 1, 2, 3 or 4, [A]+is a quaternary ammonium cation, an oxonium cation, a sulfonium cation or a phosphonium cation and [Y]+ is a monovalent, divalent, trivalent or tetravalent anion;<br>
(B)	mixed salts of the general formulae (II)<br><br>
mentioned for [A]+, and [Y]+ is as defined under (A); or<br>
(C)	mixed salts of the general formulae (III)<br><br><br><br>
The ionic liquids preferably have a melting point of less than 180°C. The melting point is more preferably in the range from -50°C to 150°C, still more preferably In the range from -20°C to 120oC and most preferably below 100°C.<br>
Compounds which are suitable for forming the cations [A]+ of Ionic liquids are, for<br>
example, known from DE 102 02 838 A1. Thus, such compounds can comprise oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur or In particular nitrogen atoms, for example at least one nitrogen atom, preferably 1-10 nitrogen atoms, particularly preferably 1-5 nitrogen atoms, very particularly preferably 1-3 nitrogen atoms and in particular 1-2 nitrogen atoms. If appropriate, further heteroatoms such as oxygen, sulfur or phosphorus atoms can also be comprised. The nitrogen atom Is a suitable carrier of the positive charge In the cation of the ionic liquid, from which a proton or an alkyl radical can then be transferred in equilibrium to the anion so as to produce an electrically neutral molecule.<br>
If the nitrogen atom is the carrier of the positive charge in the cation of the Ionic liquid, a cation can firstly be produced by quaternization of the nitrogen atom of, for example, an amine or nitrogen heterocycle in the synthesis of the ionic liquids. The quaternization can be effected by alkylation of the nitrogen atom. Depending on the alkylatlon reagent used, salts having different anions are obtained. In cases in which it Is not possible to form the desired anion directly in the quaternization, this can be effected in a further step of the synthesis. For example, starting from an ammonium hallde, the halide can be reacted with a Lewis acid to form a complex anion from the halide and Lewis acid. As an alternative, it is possible to replace a halide Ion by the desired anion. This can be achieved by addition of a metal salt with precipitation of the metal halide formed, by means of an ion exchanger or by displacement of the halide ion by a strong acid (with liberation of the hydrogen halide). Suitable methods are described, for example, in Angew. Chem. 2000, 112, pp. 3926 - 3945, and the references cited therein.<br><br>
Suitable alkyl radicals by which the nitrogen atom in the amines or nitrogen heterocycles can, for example, be quaternized are C1 - C18-alkyl, preferably C1 - C10-alkyl, particularly preferably C1- C6-alkyI and very particularly preferably methyl. The alkyl group can be unsubstituted or bear one or more identical or different substituents.<br>
Preference is given to compounds which comprise at least one five- or six-membered heterocycle, in particular a five-membered heterocycle, which has at least one nitrogen atom and, if appropriate, an oxygen or sulfur atom; particular preference is given to compounds which comprise at least one five- or six-membered heterocycle which has one, two or three nitrogen atoms and a sulfur or oxygen atom, very particularly preferably those having two nitrogen atoms. Preference is also given to aromatic heterocycles.<br>
Particularly preferred compounds are ones which have a molecular weight of less than 1000 g/mol, very particularly preferably less than 500 g/mol and in particular less than 250 g/mol.<br>
Furthermore, preference is given to cations which are selected from among the compounds of the formulae (IVa) to (IVw),<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
and oligomers comprising these structures.<br>
