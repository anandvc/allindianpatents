				<td>PACKAGED MEDICAL DEVICE<br>
WITH A DEPLOYABLE DERMAL TISSUE PENETRATION MEMBER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates, in general, to medical devices and associated<br>
packages and, in particular, to packaged medical devices with a deployable dermal<br>
tissue penetration member.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
A variety of medical devices require packaging to, for example, protect the medical<br>
device from damage prior to use and to maintain sterility of the medical device. For medical<br>
devices that combine a dermal tissue penetration member (e.g., a lancet or micro-needle) with<br>
a test strip, the associated package should provide for deployment of the dermal tissue<br>
penetration member during use, while also providing for protection of a user from inadvertent<br>
contact with the dermal tissue penetration member prior and subsequent to use. Furthermore,<br>
the packaging should provide humidity resistance for the test strip during storage.<br>
A single-use medical device calls for a medical device package that is inexpensive,<br>
disposable, and has a slim profile. Although it is conceivable that rigid injection molded<br>
medical device packages could be designed to provide protection of medical devices enclosed<br>
therein, it is likely that their cost and potentially cumbersome manual deployment (i.e.,<br>
opening) procedures would be less than ideal.<br>
 Still needed in the field, therefore, is a packaged medical device with a deployable<br>
dermal tissue penetration member that does not require cumbersome manual opening<br>
procedures, yet still provides for sterile protection of a medical device enclosed therein.<br>
Furthermore, the packaged medical device should provide protection for the dermal tissue<br>
penetration member from damage, humidity or contamination during storage, as well as<br>
protection for a user from accidental contact with the dermal tissue penetration member prior<br>
and subsequent to use. In addition, it would be desirable for the packaged medical device to<br>
have a slim profile and be inexpensive.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
 Packaged medical devices with dermal tissue penetration members according to<br>
embodiments of the present invention do not require cumbersome manual opening procedures<br>
for deployment of the dermal tissue penetration member, yet still provide for protection of a<br>
medical device enclosed therein for sterility, as well as from damage, humidity and/or<br>
contamination during storage. Furthermore, the packaged medical devices protect a user from<br>
accidental contact with the dermal tissue penetration member prior and subsequent to use. In<br>
addition, the packaged medical devices can be manufactured using inexpensive lamination<br>
techniques that result in a packaged medical device with a slim profile. Furthermore, methods<br>
and kits for deploying the dermal tissue penetration member of packaged medical devices<br>
according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention are simple to employ.<br>
A packaged medical device according to an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
present invention includes upper and lower flexible sheets, a lance body and a test strip.<br>
The lance body includes lance body upper and lower surfaces, a lance body opening<br>
that extends from the lance body upper surface to the lance body lower surface, and a<br>
dermal tissue penetration member that projects into the lance body opening.<br>
 The test strip of the packaged medical device has a test strip opening<br>
therethrough that is in a general alignment with the lance body opening. The test strip<br>
of the packaged medical device is attached to the lance body lower surface such that the<br>
dermal tissue penetration member is operatively aligned with the test strip opening.<br>
 The upper flexible sheet of the packaged medical device is attached to the lance<br>
body upper surface and covers the lance body opening. The lower flexible sheet of the<br>
packaged medical device is detachably attached to the test strip and covers the test strip<br>
opening.<br>
 Furthermore, the upper flexible sheet, lance body and test strip are configured<br>
such that, when the lower flexible sheet has been at least partially detached from the<br>
test strip to uncover the test strip opening, the upper flexible sheet, lance body and test<br>
strip can be bent to deploy the dermal tissue penetration member from the lance body<br>
opening.<br>
A kit according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes<br>
the packaged medical device described above and a deployment device. The<br>
deployment device detaches the lower flexible sheet from the test strip to uncover the<br>
test strip opening and bends the upper flexible sheet, lance body and test strip to deploy<br>
the dermal tissue penetration member from the lance body opening.<br>
A method for deploying a dermal tissue penetration member of a packaged<br>
medical device according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention<br>
includes providing the packaged medical device described above, detaching the lower<br>
flexible sheet from the test strip to uncover the test strip opening and bending the upper<br>
flexible sheet, lance body and test strip to deploy the dermal tissue penetration member<br>
from the lance body opening.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIG. 1 is a simplified exploded perspective view of a packaged medical device<br>
100 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, with the broken<br>
vertical lines of FIG. 1 indicating alignment of various components of packaged<br>
medical device 100 and the dashed lines indicating certain features that are hidden from<br>
view due to the perspective nature of FIG. 1. Packaged medical device 100 includes an<br>
upper flexible sheet 110, a lance body 120, a test strip 130, and a detachable lower<br>
flexible sheet 140.<br>
One skilled in the art will appreciate that the lance body 120 and test strip 130,<br>
in combination, constitute a medical device and, in particular, an integrated medical<br>
device. Further details regarding the type of integrated medical device depicted in FIG.<br>
1 can be found in co-pending U.S. Patent Application Nos. 10/460,106 (filed June 11,<br>
2003, entitled "Method of Analyte Measurement Using Integrated Lance and Strip")<br>
and 10/460,030 (filed June 11, 2003, entitled "Integrated Lance and Strip for Analyte<br>
Measurement"), which are fully incorporated herein by reference. Moreover, once<br>
apprised of the present disclosure, one skilled in the art will recognize that a variety of<br>
other medical devices can be beneficially configured as packaged medical devices<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
 Those skilled in the art will also recognize that packaged medical devices<br>
according to the present invention can be placed in a secondary package, for example,<br>
in a vial or a cartridge configured for dispensing such packaged medical devices. The<br>
secondary package can be constructed of material containing desiccant or can contain<br>
separately packaged desiccant for keeping contents of the secondary package moisture<br>
free.<br>
Lance body 120 includes a lance body upper surface 121, a lance body lower<br>
surface (not visible in FIG. 1), and a lance body opening 123 that extends from lance<br>
body upper surface 121 to lance body lower surface. Lance body 120 also includes a<br>
dermal tissue penetration member 124 that projects into lance body opening 123.<br>
Lance body 120 of FIG. 1 is commonly referred to in the field as a monolithic lance<br>
and can be fabricated, using, for example, progressive die stamping techniques.<br>
Dermal tissue penetration member 124 of lance body 120 includes a needle tip<br>
125, and a channel 126. Dermal tissue penetration member 124 is a lancet configured<br>
to pierce a user's skin (i.e., dermal tissue), draw a sample (e.g., a whole blood sample)<br>
from the user and deliver the sample to reaction area 132 (described below) of test strip<br>
130. Dermal tissue penetration member 124 can be fabricated by, for example,<br>
progressive die stamping, as disclosed in International Application No.<br>
PCT/GB01/05634 (published as WO 02/49507 on June 27, 2002) and U.S. Patent<br>
Application No. 10/143,399, both of which are fully incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Lance body 120 further includes a cell-defining portion 127, and two vents 128.<br>
In addition, lance body opening 123 is bounded on three sides by a lance body<br>
perimeter 129, which mirrors an outline of three sides of test strip opening 134<br>
(described below) of test strip 130.<br>
In the embodiment of FIG. 1, upper flexible sheet 110 is attached to a portion<br>
the lance body upper surface 121 by an adhesive layer 150 such that upper flexible<br>
sheet 110 covers lance body opening 124. It should be noted, however, that upper<br>
flexible sheet 110 of packaged medical device 100 is not attached to dermal tissue<br>
penetration member 124.<br>
Adhesive layer 150 can be any suitable adhesive layer known to one skilled in<br>
the art including, but not limited to, pressure-sensitive adhesive layers. Such pressure-<br>
sensitive adhesive layers can be manufactured by conventional techniques including,<br>
for example, screen printing, gravure coating and slot coating. Alternatively, a suitable<br>
adhesive layer can be pre-formed by die cutting, laser scribing or punching an adhesive<br>
material before lamination onto an underside of upper flexible sheet 110. Furthermore,<br>
the adhesive layer can be formed of a double-sided pressure-sensitive adhesive, a UV-<br>
cured adhesive, a heat-activated adhesive or a thermosetting plastic. As a non-limiting<br>
example, the adhesive may be formed by screen printing a pressure-sensitive adhesive<br>
such as, for example, a water-based acrylic copolymer pressure-sensitive adhesive (e.g.,<br>
part #A6435, commercially available from Tape Specialties LTD in Tring, Herts,<br>
United Kingdom).<br>
Upper flexible sheet 110 can be formed of any suitable material, such as<br>
surgical craft paper, Tyvek or other material which is impervious to air and/or air-borne<br>
bacteria in order to provide packaged medical device 100 with a sterile protective<br>
barrier. In addition, upper flexible sheet 110 can be puncture resistant to reduce the<br>
possibility of inadvertent penetration by dermal tissue penetration member 124.<br>
Furthermore, upper flexible sheet 110 can be configured to provide humidity protection<br>
for test strip 130, by forming upper flexible sheet 110 of a heavy polymer film, metal<br>
foil, or a composite of a metal foil and thin polymer film.<br>
Test strip 130 includes electrode contacts 131, a reaction area 132, an insulated<br>
substrate 133, a test strip opening 134, an adhesive coating 135 and a three-sided test<br>
strip perimeter 136. As depicted in FIG. 1, test strip 130 is an electrochemical glucose<br>
measurement test strip fabricated using conventional screen printing techniques.<br>
However, one skilled in the art will realize that test strips for use in packaged medical<br>
devices according to the present invention can have, but are not limited to, any suitable<br>
electrochemical and photometric configuration and that for illustrative purposes only,<br>
test strip 130 of FIG. 1 is illustrated as an electrochemical glucose measurement test<br>
strip. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that suitable test strips for use in<br>
packaged medical devices according to the present invention are not limited to test<br>
strips for the measurement of glucose but can also be test strips used to measure, for<br>
example, ketones, glycated proteins (such as glycated albumin), coagulation parameters<br>
and/or cholesterol of a sample.<br>
 Test strip 130 is attached to the lance body lower surface such that dermal tissue<br>
penetration member 124 is operatively aligned with the test strip opening 134. In the<br>
embodiment of FIG. 1, lance body 120 is laminated to test strip 130 such that the cell-<br>
defining portion 127 of lance body 120 lies directly above reaction area 132, thereby<br>
serving to define a reaction cell. Vents 128 of lance body 120 serve to define side<br>
edges of the reaction cell and to minimize the total sample volume of the reaction cell.<br>
By minimizing the total sample volume, the functionality of test strip 130 is optimized.<br>
Further details regarding the exemplary reaction cell and vents construction can be<br>
found in co-pending U.S. Patent Application Nos. 60/458,242 (filed March 28, 2003,<br>
entitled "Integrated Lance and Strip for Analyte Measurement"), 60/459,465 (filed<br>
March 28, 2003, entitled "Method of Analyte Measurement using Integrated Lance and<br>
Strip") and 60/422,228 (filed October 30, 2002, entitled "Improved Method of Lancing<br>
Skin for the Extraction of Blood"), which are fully incorporated herein by reference.<br>
 In the embodiment of FIG. 1, electrode contacts 131 of test strip 130 extend<br>
beyond lance body 120 and upper flexible sheet 110. This extension of the electrode<br>
contacts simplifies the establishment of an electrical connection between the electrode<br>
contacts and external device(s) (e.g., a meter). Those skilled in the art will recognize<br>
that although three electrode contacts 131 are shown in FIG. 1 for the purpose of<br>
illustration, test strips for use in packaged medical devices according to the present<br>
invention can include those with no electrode contacts and, in general, those with at<br>
least one electrode contact.<br>
 Test strip 130 can be fabricated using conventional screen-printing techniques<br>
and can be printed on, for example, an insulated substrate (such as insulated substrate<br>
133). Reaction area 132 can, for example, include reagents, insulation layers, and<br>
carbon electrodes that are in electrochemical communication with electrode contacts<br>
131.<br>
Test strip opening 134 is adjacent to reaction area 132 and provides clearance<br>
for channel 126 of dermal tissue penetration member 124. Adhesive coating 135 can<br>
be formed, for example, of a pressure-sensitive adhesive that is printed on insulated<br>
substrate 133 by methods known to those skilled in the art. In addition, adhesive<br>
coating 135 and insulated substrate 133 can be selected and configured to provide a<br>
packaged medical device with sterility and/or humidity protection.<br>
Lower flexible sheet 140 is detachably attached (e.g., sealed) to a lower surface<br>
of insulated substrate 133 and covers test strip opening 134. Lower flexible sheet 140<br>
can be laminated to insulated substrate 133 in a detachable manner that provides for<br>
easy removal of lower flexible sheet 140 from test strip 130 by, for example, peeling of<br>
the lower flexible sheet 140 away from test strip 130. Any suitable adhesive known to<br>
one skilled in the art can be employed for this purpose including, but not limited to,<br>
cold-seal adhesives, heat-seal adhesives and releasable adhesives available from, for<br>
example, 3M, Basic Adhesives and Avery Dennison.<br>
— Lower flexible sheet 140 incorporates a flap 141, which is folded back upon<br>
lower flexible sheet 140, and a tab 142 of sufficient thickness to enable a person or<br>
device to grip and pull tab 142 away from a folded edge 143 of lower flexible sheet<br>
140. Examples of suitable materials for lower flexible sheet 140 are the same as those<br>
described above for upper flexible sheet 110. In addition, tab 142 can be formed, for<br>
example, by processes known to those skilled in the art, including successively rolling<br>
material into a flattened coil or laminating a separate strip of material (such as a plastic<br>
sheet or paper card stock).<br>
The upper flexible sheet 110, lance body 120, and test strip 130 of packaged<br>
medical device 100 are configured such that, when the lower flexible sheet 140 has<br>
been detached from test strip 130 such the test strip opening 134 is uncovered, the<br>
upper flexible sheet 110, lance body 120 and test strip 130 can be bent to deploy the<br>
dermal tissue penetration member 124 from the lance body opening 123. In the<br>
embodiment of FIGs. 1 (and as illustrated in FIGs. 5A-5D) dermal tissue penetration<br>
member 124 passes through test strip opening 134 as it is deployed from lance body<br>
opening 123. This deployment of the dermal tissue penetration member is further<br>
described and illustrated with regard to FIGs. 5A-5D below.<br>
Since packaged medical device 100 can be formed entirely of laminated<br>
structures, it is inexpensive and of a slim profile. In addition, enclosure by upper and<br>
lower flexible sheets 110 and 140 serves to provide damage, contamination and<br>
humidity protections, while three-sided lance body perimeters 129 of lance body 120<br>
and three-sided test strip perimeters 136 of test strip 130 provide damage protection for<br>
the dermal tissue penetration member prior to its deployment. Furthermore, the<br>
operative alignment of the test strip and lance body openings and the detachable nature<br>
of the lower flexible sheet enable ready manual and/or mechanical deployment of the<br>
dermal tissue penetration member from within the lance body opening.<br>
FIG. 2 is a perspective view of a kit 200 that includes packaged medical device<br>
100 of FIG. 1 and a deployment device 210. Deployment device 210 is configured to<br>
(i) detach lower flexible sheet 140 from test strip 130, thereby uncovering test strip<br>
opening 134; and (ii) bend upper flexible sheet 110, lance body 120 and test strip 130<br>
to deploy dermal tissue penetration member 124 from lance body opening 123. If<br>
desired, deployment deice 210 can also include at least one electrical connector (not<br>
shown) for establishing an electrical connection between an external device (such as a<br>
meter, also not shown) and electrode contact(s) of packaged medical device 100. Any<br>
suitable electrical connector known those of skill in the art can be employed.<br>
 In the embodiment of FIG. 2, deployment device 210 includes a stripping block<br>
220, which detaches lower flexible sheet 140 from test strip 130 of packaged medical<br>
device 100. If desired, stripping block 220 can include the aforementioned electrical<br>
connector.<br>
 Deployment device 210 also includes a folding block 230, which bends upper<br>
flexible sheet 110, lance body 120 and test strip 130 to cause the dermal tissue<br>
penetration member 124 to deploy from the lance body opening 123. The bending<br>
serves to deploy the dermal tissue penetration member from within the lance body<br>
opening by essentially moving three-sided lance body perimeter 129, three-sided test<br>
strip perimeter 136 and upper flexible sheet 110 away from the dermal tissue<br>
penetration member.<br>
The folding can, for example, place these three-sided lance body and test strip<br>
perimeters and the bent portion of the upper flexible sheet into an essentially<br>
perpendicular orientation with respect to the remainder of the test strip and lance body<br>
such that the dermal tissue penetration member 124 is exposed and readied to puncture<br>
a user's dermal tissue. A perpendicular orientation has the benefit of placing the three-<br>
sided lance body perimeter, three-sided test strip perimeter and upper flexible sheet in<br>
positions where they do not interfere with use of the deployed dermal tissue penetration<br>
member to lance a user's skin.<br>
 Stripping block 220 includes a lead-in chamber 222, a stripping edge 224 and a<br>
stripping block opening 226. Stripping block opening 226 is configured such that, with<br>
the exception of tab 142, packaged medical device 100 can easily pass through it. The<br>
configuration is such that tab 142 is prevented from passing beyond stripping edge 224<br>
of stripping block 220. Stripping block 220, therefore, serves to at least partially detach<br>
(e.g., "peel") lower flexible sheet 140 from test strip 130, thereby uncovering test strip<br>
opening 134, as packaged medical device 100 is moved through stripping block<br>
opening 226.<br>
 Folding block 230 of deployment device 210 is positioned distally from<br>
stripping block 220. Folding block 230 includes a first folding block opening 232, an<br>
axis pin 234, lips 236 and a second folding block opening 238. First folding block<br>
opening 232 is of a dimension sufficient to accept packaged medical device 100 as<br>
packaged medical device 100 emerges from stripping block 220 (for example, first<br>
folding block opening 232 can have a width of approximately 6 mm and a height of<br>
approximately 0.8 mm). Folding block 230 can, if desired, be provided with a stop<br>
member (not shown) that defines complete insertion of a packaged medical device into<br>
folding block 230 by physically preventing over insertion of the packaged medical<br>
device.<br>
Axis pin 234 is configured to provide for folding block 230 to pivot through an<br>
arc in the range of, for example, approximately 90 degrees to 100 degrees. An arc of<br>
90 degrees will produce the perpendicular orientation discussed above. Although an<br>
arc of greater than 100 degrees could be employed, as the arc angle is increased there is<br>
also an increased risk of deleterious shearing between, and separation of, the lance<br>
body and test strip.<br>
When medical device package 100 is inserted into folding block 230, folding<br>
block 230 is mechanically turned to deploy dermal tissue penetration member 124 from<br>
lance body opening 123. In this regard, folding block 230 has two lips 236 that define<br>
the second folding block opening 238 (for example, a second folding block opening<br>
with a width of 5.5 mm wide and a height of 0.7 mm). Second folding block opening<br>
238 is constructed to have a width that is greater than the width of dermal tissue<br>
penetration member 124, and preferably as wide as lance body opening 123, such that<br>
when folding block 230 bends test strip 130, lance body 120 and upper flexible sheet<br>
110, dermal tissue penetration member 124 is able to pass through second folding block<br>
opening 238.<br>
 Stripping and folding blocks of the present invention can be formed of any<br>
suitable material and can be manufactured using any suitable technique known to one<br>
skilled in the art. For example, the stripping and folding blocks can be formed of<br>
polycarbonate, acetal, stainless steel or aluminum and can be manufactured using<br>
injection molding, die casting or machining techniques.<br>
 FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of folding block 230 of deployment device 210<br>
taken along line 3A-3A in FIG. 2. FIG. 3 depicts the manner in which folding block<br>
230 includes a rounded folding edge 239 that is located distal to, and concentric with,<br>
axis pin 234. Rounded folding edge 239 is configured to facilitate the bending of test<br>
strip 130 and lance body 120 as described above with respect to FIG. 1. In particular,<br>
the rounded nature of rounded folding edge 239 provides for a controlled bending since<br>
the natural form of a bend is rounded, as well as for increased control of a packaged<br>
medical device subsequent to folding Further, a rounded folding edge facilitates the<br>
entry of the packaged medical device into the folding block.<br>
FIGs. 4 and 5A through 5D serve to illustrate a sequence of steps in a process<br>
400 for deploying dermal tissue penetration member 124 of packaged medical device<br>
100, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Process 400 includes first providing a packaged medical device 100 as<br>
described above with respect to FIG. 1, as set forth in step 410 of FIG. 4.<br>
Alternatively, both a packaged medical device and a deployment device (such as the kit<br>
of FIG. 2) can be provided, as depicted in FIG. 5A.<br>
\— Next, the lower flexible sheet of the packaged medical device is at least<br>
partially detached from the test strip of the packaged medical device to uncover the test<br>
strip opening, as set forth in step 420 of FIG. 4. This detaching step can be<br>
accomplished manually by a user or by use of the deployment device described with<br>
respect to FIG. 2 above. In this regard, FIGs. 5B and 5C depict the use of deployment<br>
deice 200 to detach the lower flexible sheet. In FIGs. 5B and 5C, an arrow indicates<br>
the insertion direction of packaged medical device 100 into deployment device 200.<br>
 Subsequently, at step 430 of FIG. 4, the upper flexible sheet, lance body and<br>
test strip of the packaged medical device are bent (e.g., bent manually or by use of the<br>
deployment device described above) to deploy the dermal tissue penetration member<br>
from the lance body opening. Such bending is illustrated in FIG. 5D for the<br>
circumstance that the deployment device of FIG. 2 is employed. In FIG. 5D, the<br>
curved arrow indicates the direction of bending.<br>
 If desired subsequent to deployment and use, the upper flexible sheet, lance<br>
body and test strip of the packaged medical device can be bent back to their essentially<br>
original positions such that the dermal issue penetration member is again projecting<br>
into the lance body opening. This can be accomplished either manually or, in the<br>
circumstance that a deployment device was employed for bending, by employing the<br>
axis pin of the deployment device to return the upper flexible sheet, lance body and test<br>
strip of the packaged medical device back to their essentially original positions. In<br>
other words, the axis pin would be employed to pivot the folding block in reverse<br>
through the arc that had bent the upper flexible sheet, lance body and test strip.<br>
Once the upper flexible sheet, lance body and test strip have been bent back to<br>
their essentially original position, the lower flexible sheet can, if desired, be reattached<br>
to the test strip to recover the test strip opening. Such reattachment is facilitated if, for<br>
example, a resealable adhesive was to detachably attach the lower flexible sheet to the<br>
test strip. Once the dermal tissue penetration member is again projecting into the lance<br>
body opening and the lower flexible sheet is reattached, a user is protected from<br>
inadvertent contact with the dermal tissue penetration member.<br>
 One skilled in the art will recognize that the processes according to the present<br>
invention can be conducted within a combined sample collection and metering system<br>
designed for in-situ testing. Examples of systems designed for in-situ testing are<br>
disclosed in International Patent Application No. PCT/US01/07169 (published as WO<br>
01/64105 Al on September 7, 2001) and International Patent Application No.<br>
PCT/GB02/03772 (published as WO 03/015627 Al on February 27, 2003), each of<br>
which is fully incorporated herein by reference. In addition, the mechanical motions<br>
required for deploying a dermal tissue penetration member can be combined with<br>
lancet cocking and/or strip loading. Alternatively, motorized components may<br>
separately perform the stripping and folding actions.<br>
While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and<br>
described herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that such embodiments are<br>
provided by way of example only. Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions<br>
will now occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the invention.<br>
It should be understood that various alternatives to the embodiments of the<br>
invention described herein may be employed in practicing the invention. It is intended<br>
that the following claims define the scope of the invention and that methods and<br>
structures within the scope of these claims and their equivalents be covered thereby.<br>
