				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a device for detecting bearing insulation failure in large electric rotating machines.<br>
Voltage between the shaft ends is induced during the operation of the rotating electric machines due to disymmetries in the materials and geometry of the magnetic and electrical parts. Therefore the bearings of the big machines such as hydro generator, turbo generator are insulated by the insulated material. However, if the bearing insulation fails the shaft voltage causes shaft current to circulate through the bearing pedestal and other parts of the machines resulting into a serious idamage.<br>
The shaft current is not similar to the currents flowing in<br>
any externally excited circuits. A correct and unambiguous method of<br>
monitoring this current is based on non-invasion method without<br>
recourse to Use of potential differences in the current flowing path.<br>
Further     as      it      is       not	possible...	<br>
to  calculate  exactly  the  total impedance  of  the current  path,     Hence,  a  non-contact  technique  ie the  only  simple  possibility  to  detect  the  bearing insulation  failure.<br>
A  protection  system  is  as  such  known  in  the art  and  is    designed  to    Intercept  faults  as  and when  they  occure.     The  protection  system  comprising a  transducer  to  generate  the  signal  of  an  impending fault  tipically  in  the  form  of  a  voltage  or  current and  is  connected  to  a  relay  which  is  provided  to switch  off  the  machine.     The  protection  system  is designed  to    intercept  faults  as  and  when  they  occure so  as  to  initiate  such  actions  to  ensure  that    the minimum  of  further  damage  occurence  and  to    obviate the  eventuality  of  a  machine  failure.<br>
The main disadvantage associated with the known protection system is that it is designed to  act  only  in  the  post-fault  periode.<br>
Therefore  the  main  object  of    the  present Invention  is  to  provide  a  device  which  can  detect the  bearing  insulation  failure  by  monitoring  rotor<br>
shaft current of the machine.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a simple and effective device for condition monitoring of the rotor shaft current to prevent the bearing insulation failure by giving alarm at present shaft current value.<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a device for detecting bearing insulation failure in large electric rotating machines, comprising: (a) an electromagnetic transducer such as a split torroidal coil placed around the rotor shaft of the said electric rotating machine and secured to the frame or casing of the said electric rotating machine; (b) an amplifier connected between the output and input terminals of the said torroidal coil having a resistance connected between the said coil and the said amplifier in parallel; the said amplifier connected with the said coil through a-shielded cable; (c) a filter connected between output and input terminals of the said amplifier; (d) a relay connected to the said filter for actuating an alarm for indicating bearing insulation failure in large electric rotating machines.<br>
In accordance with this invention the said device has a transducer for example a toroidal coil adapted to be placed around the shaft opf a machine. The current flowing in the shaft induces an e.m.f across the terminals of the transducer. The transducer  is   retro-fitted     around  the  shaft  of the  machine  under  surveillance     and    securely attached    to  the  frame  or  casing  of  the  machine. An  amplifier  is  connected    to  the  input  and  output<br>
terminals  of  the    coil  having  a  resistance  secured therewith  in  parallel     between  the  coil  and  amplifier.<br>
A  filter    is  connected  to  the  output     and  input<br>
terminals  of  the  amplifier    such  that  to  seperate<br>
50/150 Hz     components.     Further  a   relay  is  connected to  said  amplifier   for  awitchlng  on  an   alarm  in  case<br>
of  the  bearing  insulation  failure.<br>
A  shaft  current  diagnostic  device  according to  a  preferred  embodiment  is  herein  described    and<br>
illustrated  in  the  accompanying  drawings  wherein)<br>
Fig.1	shows  the  plan  view  ot   theddevlce.   and<br>
Fig.2	shows  the     flux  lines  produced<br>
during  the  operation  of  the  electric<br>
machines.<br>
Referring  to  the  drawings  particularly  Fig.l the  shaft    current  diagnostic  device  for  detecting bearing  insulation  failure  by  monitoring  the    rotor shaft  current  of  the  machine,  as  a  transducer  preferably<br>
an  electro   magnetic   transducer   such   as     a  split<br>
toroidal   coil   1   which   is   placed   around   the   rotor<br>
shaft     of     a     machine.      The  coil   lis  securely  attached<br>
to   a   frame   or   casing   of   the   machine   (not   shown)/<br>
and  is   provided   to   facilitate   the   determination   of<br>
line   integral,   H.ds     in     usual   mathematical     rotation<br>
which   gives   the   current   in   the   enclosed   loop  of   the<br>
coil   1.	An   amplifier   3   is   connected   between      the<br>
terminals output   and   input/of   the   toroidal   coil   1   having   a<br>
resistance   4   connected   between   the   coil   1   and     the<br>
amplifier   3   in  parallel   and   for   measuring   the   current<br>
producing   in   the   toroidal   coil   1.      The  amplifier   3<br>
is   connected  with   coil   1   through   a  shielded   cable   5.<br>
A     filter   6      is   connected   between   the   output   and<br>
input   terminals   of   the   amplifier   3   for   seperating<br>
the   components   of     50/150HZ.      A   relay   7   is   connected   to<br>
the   filter   6   for   actuating   an   alarm   (not   shown),<br>
in   case   the   bearing   insulation       is   failed.      The<br>
toroidal   coil   consists   of  the   wire   wound   arounded   former,<br>
the   former  is     circular   and   axis   of   the   former<br>
correspondence  in   flow   of   the  current   which   is   to<br>
be   major.      The     current   induces   flux   tubes     concentrate<br>
with   a  current,   if  the   former  is     a     flow  magnetism<br>
reluctance,   the   magnetic   flux   flowing   along  the<br>
circular  axle  of  the     former  lnturn  Induce  a electro  vire  source  in  the  coil     1  of  the transducer.     The  e.m.f  induce  is  a  major  of  the current.<br>
Reference  is  now  made  to  fig.2  the  shaft current  is  generated  along    the  generator  shaft  1 and  frame  by  magnetic  asymmetric  in  the  generator core  8 . The  rotating  magnetic  field  leaves  the rotor from  the  north  pole,   crosses  the  air  gap into  the  core &amp;  splits  into  2  flux  paths  9 &amp; 10 at  the  right  andleft  sides.     The  fluxes    9  &amp;  10  are circumferential  and    each  cover  180*  around  the  core  8, an  opposite  directons  to  rejoin    and  enter<br>
the  south    pole  of  the    rotor  2.     The    The  two counter  semi -circular    magnetic  fields  within  the machine  core  symmetrically  surround  the  shaft  of the rotor.     If  the  machine  core  are  magnetically  perfectly uniform  and   if the core  contains  no  defect  or irregularities,  the  two    magnetic   fields  would  be equal  in  magnitude  and  opposite  in  direction    as they  rotate  with     the  rotor  shaft.     No  net  magnetic (lux  would    adjust  around  a  closed  circular  path within  the  machine  core  and  surrounding  the  shaft of     the  rotor.      No  corresponding  voltage     wouldtherefore  be  induced  along  the  rotor  shaft.<br>
Whan    the     toroidal   coil   1   enclosea a structure  carrying  tha    circulating  currant  or  the<br>
shaft       2  of  a     rotating  machine,the     signal  induced<br>
in  tha  search  coil?1  ia  proportional  to  the  enclosed<br>
current.     In  such  a  coil  1,   the    changing  magnetic<br>
induction  causes  an  e.m.f  proportional   to  the  rate<br>
of  change  of  flux  threading  tha  coil.     A  measure  of<br>
the    linking  flux  can  be  obtained    by  monitoring  the<br>
coil  output  voltage  which  ia  a  direct  measure  of  tha<br>
shaft  current.     In  practice/   it    is  desirable  that<br>
this  voltage  be    large  enough    to  be  monitored<br>
easily  and  accurately,   which  is  achieved  here  by<br>
uaing  electronic  amplification.<br>
In    addition  to  ahaft  current  component**, both    current   frequency  and  magnitude  are    measured<br>
using  an FFT  (Fast     Fourier    Transform-   )  spectrum  analyzer<br>
A  filter  circuit  is  introduced  which  separates<br>
5O/150Hz  components.     If  actuates  a  microprocessor<br>
relay     to  give an alarm  when  the  ahaft  current   exeeds<br>
the  present:  value  and  enables  the  machine  to  be<br>
tripped,   if     necessary.<br>
On-line  monitoring   of  shaft   current   signal spectra,  starting  from  the  test   bed,   and  establishment of  correlation  over  a  period  of  time    during  its<br>
operation  makes  this  device an  electromagnetic<br>
diagnostic  tool  for  monitoring  the  health    of  large<br>
rotating    electrical    machines.	A  reference  spectrum<br>
of  the  shaft  current   signal   is  to  be  obtained  from<br>
the  machine  under  surveillance  when  there  is  a<br>
reasonable     degree  of  certainty  that   the  equipment  is<br>
in  a    good  condition.     Subsequent  spectra  are  then<br>
compared    with  the  reference  signal/   and  if  marked<br>
differences  e;ist,   it    implies  that  something within<br>
the  machine  has  altered.     The  nature  of  the  change  can<br>
be  diagnosed.<br>
Thus  the  condition  monitoring  provides  advance<br>
warning  to  the  operating  staff  and  thus  permits<br>
scheduling    outages  in     the  most  convenient  manner,<br>
resulting  in  lower    downtime  and  lower  capitalised losses.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
