THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a washing machine, and more particularly, to a<br>
washing machine and method for controlling the same, which are designed to save<br>
washing water and prevent damage of the laundry, which may be caused by<br>
temperature increase for the washing operation.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	Generally, a drum-type washing machine is a device performing the washing by<br>
dropping laundry loaded in a horizontally disposed drum.<br>
[3]	FIG. 1 shows a prior drum-type washing machine and FIG. 2 shows another prior<br>
drum-type washing machine.<br>
[4]	Referring to FIG. 1, a drum-type washing machine includes a main body 10, a tub<br>
20 mounted in the main body 10, a drum 30 rotatably mounted in the tub 20, and a<br>
driving unit for driving the d-um 30.<br>
[5]	Here, the main body 10 is provided at a front portion with a laundry loading<br>
opening 11, around which a door 40 for opening/closing the opening 11 is mounted.<br>
[6]	A gasket 50 is disposed on an inner circumference of the laundry loading opening<br>
11 to provide a seal between the door 40 and the laundry loading opening 11.<br>
[7]	A damper 21 is provided on an outer-lower portion of the tub 20 and supported in<br>
the main body 10.<br>
[8]	The driving unit includes a driving motor 71 driving the drum 30 and a belt 72<br>
connected to a belt pulley 73 to transmit driving force of the driving motor 71 to the<br>
drum 30.<br>
[9]	If the drum-type washing machine has a dry function, as shown in FIG. 2, a hot<br>
wind supply tube 81 is provided above the tub 20 and a dry heater 82 is disposed in the<br>
hot wind supply tube 81 to heat air flowing along the hot wind supply tube 81.<br>
[10]	Disposed on an air exhaust side of the hot wind supply tube 81 is a blower fan 83<br>
for forcedly circulating the air.<br>
[11]	However, in the prior drum-type washing machines, even when washing the<br>
laundry that is less stained and thus a little amount of water is required, a large amount<br>
of water is consumed. Furthermore, the washing operation is identically performed to a<br>
case for normal washing operation, increasing the consumption of the electricity.<br>
[12]	Furthermore, in the case of the washing machine with the dry function, the laundry<br>
may be wrinkled or static electricity may occur.<br><br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[37]	Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever<br>
possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to<br>
the same or like parts.<br>
[38]	FIGs. 3 and 4 show a drum-type washing machine according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
[39]	The inventive washing machine includes a main body 110 defining an outer<br>
appearance, a tub 120 disposed and supported in the main body 110, a drum 130<br>
rotatably installed in the tub 120, one or more steam generating unit 200 providing a<br>
predetermined amount of steam into the drum 130, and a circulation pump 400<br>
circulating washing water exhausted from the tub 120 to a side of the tub 120.<br>
[40]	An opening of the drum 130 is oriented toward a laundry loading opening 111 of<br>
the main body 110.<br>
[41]	At this point, a door 140 for opening/closing the laundry loading opening 111 is<br>
mounted around the laundry loading opening 111 of the main body 110. A gasket 150<br>
is mounted on an inner circumference of the laundry loading opening 111 to provide a<br>
seal between the laundry loading opening 111 and the door 140.<br>
[42]	In addition, the drum 130 is provided with a plurality of through holes (not shown)<br>
so that washing water and steam can be introduced into the drum 130 through the<br>
through holes.<br><br>
[43]	In the drum-type washing machine of the present invention, a dispenser 310 for<br>
supplying washing water into the tub 130 is connected to a water supply valve 118.<br>
The steam generating unit 200 is also connected to the water supply valve 118.<br>
[44]	The water supply valve 118 is connected to a tap-water tube (not shown) to control<br>
of the supply of the tap-water.<br>
[45]	The steam generating unit 200 is provided to hot washing water into the drum 130.<br>
[46]	The steam generating unit 200, as shown in FIG. 7, includes a water storing tank<br>
240 storing the water introduced through the water supply valve 118 and a heater 210<br>
installed in the water storing tank 240 to vaporize the water by heating the water.<br>
[47]	FIG. 7 shows an internal structure of the steam generating unit of the inventive<br>
drum-type washing machine.<br>
[48]	The steam generating unit 200 includes a steam supply tube 220 supplying the<br>
steam generated by the heater 210 to the tub 120 and a first spray nozzle 230 provided<br>
on an end of the steam supply tube 220.<br>
[49]	At this point, the first spray nozzle 230 is formed in a nozzle-shape so that the<br>
steam can be effectively sprayed. An extreme end of the nozzle 230 is preferably<br>
exposed into the tube 120 by penetrating the tub 120.<br>
[50]	The steam supply tube 220 is located above the tub 120 such that the laundry loaded<br>
in the drum 130 may not directly contact the hot air. In this case, the steam supply tube<br>
220 may be designed such that the steam can be directly directed into the drum 130<br>
through the gasket 150 on the front portion of the tub 120.<br>
[51]	The heater 210 of the steam generating unit 200 may be of a coil heater wound<br>
around the steam supply tube 220 or, as shown in FIG. 7, of a sheath heater mounted in<br>
the water storing tank 240 to directly heat the water stored in the tank 240.<br>
[52]	When the sheath heater is used, a water level sensor for detecting the water level of<br>
the tank 240 is further provided.<br>
[53]	That is, when the water level is not enough high, the heater 210 is excessively<br>
heated. When the water level is too high, the vaporizing time is increased.<br>
Furthermore, since liquid water may be sprayed, the water level should be maintained<br>
at a predetermined level.<br>
[54]	That is, when the water level detected by the water level sensor 250 is higher than a<br>
reference level, the water supply to the tank 240 is stopped. When the water level<br>
detected by the water level sensor 250 is lower than the reference level, the water is<br>
supplied to the tank 240.<br>
[55]	Meanwhile, the volume of the steam generating unit 200 (i.e., the volume of the<br>
tank 240) to the volume of the drum 130 may be 1:1/30-1:1/120 so that a proper<br>
amount of steam can be supplied to the drum for the effective washing.<br>
[56]	In order for the steam to be forcedly directed from the steam supply tube 220 into<br><br>
the drum 130, the first spray nozzle 230 may be connected to a pumping unit such as a<br>
pump. However, by further providing an on/off valve 221 for turning on/off the steam<br>
supply tube 220 on the tube 220, the steam can be selectively sprayed.<br>
[57]	Meanwhile, the steam supply tube 220 has a bellows 220 to be stably fixed even<br>
when the vibration is transmitted from the tub 120 during the operation of the washing<br>
machine. The bellows 220 may be formed of rubber.<br>
[58]	The steam supply tube 220 may be fastened on the tub 120 by a clamp 251.<br>
[59]	In addition, the dispenser 310 connected to the water supply valve 118 to supply the<br>
washing water into the tub 210 is provided in the main body 110. The dispenser 310 is<br>
designed to add the detergent.<br>
[60]	In addition, the dispenser 310 includes a second spray nozzle 330 spraying the<br>
stored detergent into the drum 130 and a detergent supply tube 320 guiding the<br>
detergent to the second spray nozzle 330.<br>
[61]	At this point, an extreme end of the second spray nozzle 330 may be exposed into<br>
the drum 130.<br>
[62]	The second spray nozzle 330 may be integrally formed with the first spray nozzle<br>
230 of the steam generating unit 300.<br>
[63]	An amount of water supply per minute of the water supply valve 118 to the<br>
dispenser 310 is designed to be greater than an amount of water supply per minute of<br>
the water supply valve 118 to the steam generating unit 200.<br>
[64]	The circulating pump 400 is provided on the lower portion of the drum-type<br>
washing machine to circulate the water supplied.<br>
[65]	A fluid circulating tube 410 for sucking the washing water exhausted to a lower<br>
portion of the tub 120 and directing the sucked washing water to the other side of the<br>
circulating pump 400 is disposed between the circulating pump 400 and the tub 120.<br>
[66]	That is, the circulating pump 400 pumps out the washing water introduced. The<br>
washing water pumped out by the circulating pump 400 is directed into the tub 120<br>
through a front-upper portion of the tub 120, ascending along the fluid circulating tube<br>
410.<br>
[67]	By directing the washing water accumulated on the bottom of the tub 120 into the<br>
drum 130, the laundry can be uniformly wet and washing water can be saved.<br>
[68]	In this case, a filter (not shown) for filtering foreign objects contained in the<br>
washing water may be further provided on the circulating pump 400 or the fluid<br>
circulating tube 410.<br>
[69]	A drain pump (not shown) for draining the washing water after the washing and<br>
rinsing cycles are completed is installed on a lower portion of the washing machine.<br>
[70]	FIG. 5 shows a structure for effectively separating the polluting substances from the<br>
laundry socked in the washing water by the washing machine with the steam<br><br>
generating unit according to the present invention.<br>
[71]	The structure depicted in FIG. 5 is identical to that depicted in FIGs. 3 and 4 except<br>
that a heater 500 is provided under the tub 120 to boil the laundry.<br>
[72]	In this case, the heater 500 functions to boil the laundry by heating the washing<br>
water supplied to the tub, thereby effectively separating the polluting substances from<br>
the laundry by cooperating with the steam generating unit 200.<br>
[73]	A washing machine having the above-described structure but further having a dry<br>
function will be described hereinafter.<br>
[74]	FIG. 6 shows a drum-type washing machine according to another embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
[75]	A washing machine includes a main body 110 defining an outer appearance, a tub<br>
120 disposed and supported in the main body 110, a drum 130 rotatably installed in the<br>
tub 120 and provided with a plurality of through holes, one or more steam generating<br>
unit 200 providing a predetermined amount of steam into the drum 130, a circulation<br>
pump 400 circulating washing water exhausted from the tub 120 to a side of the tub<br>
120, and a dry unit for drying the laundry after the washing/rinsing operation is<br>
finished.<br>
[76]	An opening of the drum 130 is oriented toward a laundry loading opening 111 of<br>
the main body 110.<br>
[77]	At this point, a door 140 for opening/closing the laundry loading opening 111 is<br>
mounted around the laundry loading opening 111 of the main body 110. A gasket 150<br>
is mounted on an inner circumference of the laundry loading opening 111 to provide a<br>
seal between the laundry loading opening 111 and the door 140.<br>
[78]	In addition, the drum 130 is provided with a plurality of through holes (not shown)<br>
so that washing water and steam can be introduced into the drum 130 through the<br>
through holes.<br>
[79]	In the drum-type washing machine of the present invention, a dispenser 310 for<br>
supplying washing water and steam into the tub 130 is connected to a water supply<br>
valve 118. The steam generating unit 200 is also connected to the water supply valve<br>
118.<br>
[80]	The water supply valve 118 is connected to a tap-water tube (not shown) to control<br>
of the supply of the tap-water.<br>
[81]	The water supply valve 118 is designed to simultaneously supply the water to both<br>
the steam generating unit 200 and the dispenser 310 or to selectively supply the water<br>
to one of the steam generating unit 200 and the dispenser 310.<br>
[82]	The steam generating unit 200 is provided to hot washing water into the drum 130.<br>
[83]	The steam generating unit 200, as shown in FIG. 7, includes a water storing tank<br>
240 storing the water introduced through the water supply valve 118 and a heater 210<br><br>
installed in the water storing tank 240 to vaporize the water by heating the water.<br>
[84]	FIG. 7 shows an internal structure of the steam generating unit of the inventive<br>
drum-type washing machine.<br>
[85]	The steam generating unit 200 includes a steam supply tube 220 supplying the<br>
steam generated by the heater 210 to the tub 120 and a first spray nozzle 230 provided<br>
on an end of the steam supply tube 220.<br>
[86]	At this point, the first spray nozzle 230 is formed in a nozzle-shape so that the<br>
steam can be effectively sprayed. An extreme end of the nozzle 230 is preferably<br>
exposed into the tube 120 by penetrating the tub 120.<br>
[87]	The steam supply tube 220 is located above the tub 120 such that the laundry loaded<br>
in the drum 130 may not directly contact the hot air. In this case, the steam supply tube<br>
220 may be designed such that the steam can be directly directed into the drum 130 th<br>
rough the gasket 150 on the front portion of the tub 120.<br>
[88]	In order for the steam to be forcedly directed from the steam supply tube 220 into<br>
the drum 130, the first spray nozzle 230 may be connected to a pumping unit such as a<br>
pump. However, by further providing a first on/off valve 221 for opening and closing<br>
the steam supply tube 220 on the tube 220, the steam can be selectively sprayed.<br>
[89]	At this point, a first side of the water storing tank 240 is connected to the water<br>
supply valve 118 connected to a tap-water pipe and a second side of the water storing<br>
tank 240 is connected to the steam supply tube 220.<br>
[90]	The heater 210 of the steam generating unit 200 may be of a coil heater wound<br>
around the steam supply tube 220 or a sheath heater mounted in the water storing tank<br>
240 to directly heat the water stored in the tank 240.<br>
[91]	When the sheath heater is used, a water level sensor 250 for detecting the water<br>
level of the tank 240 is further provided in the steam generating unit 200 as shown in<br>
FIG. 7.<br>
[92]	That is, when the water level is not enough high, the heater 210 is excessively<br>
heated. When the water level is too high, the vaporizing time is increased.<br>
Furthermore, since liquid water may be sprayed, the water level should be maintained<br>
at a predetermined level.<br>
[93]	That is, when the water level detected by the water level sensor 250 is higher than a<br>
reference level, the water supply to the tank 240 is stopped. When the water level<br>
detected by the water level sensor 250 is lower than the reference level, the water is<br>
supplied to the tank 240.<br>
[94]	Meanwhile, the volume of the steam generating unit 200 (i.e., the volume of the<br>
tank 240) to the volume of the drum 130 may be 1:1/30-1:1/120 so that a proper<br>
amount of steam can be supplied to the drum for the effective washing.<br>
[95]	In order for the steam to be forcedly directed from the steam supply tube 220 into<br><br>
the drum 130, the first spray nozzle 230 may be connected to a pumping unit such as a<br>
pump. However, by further providing an on/off valve 221 for turning on/off the steam<br>
supply tube 220 on the tube 220, the steam can be selectively sprayed.<br>
[96]	Meanwhile, as shown in FIG. 6, the steam supply tube 220 has a bellows 220 to be<br>
stably fixed even when the vibration is transmitted from the tub 120 during the<br>
operation of the washing machine. The bellows 220 may be formed of rubber.<br>
[97]	The steam supply tube 220 may be fastened on the tub 120 by a clamp 251.<br>
[98]	In addition, the dispenser 310 connected to the water supply valve 118 to supply the<br>
washing water into the tub 210 is provided in the main body 110. The dispenser 310 is<br>
designed to add the detergent.<br>
[99]	In addition, the dispenser 310 includes a second spray nozzle 330 spraying the<br>
stored detergent into the drum 130 and a detergent supply tube 320 guiding the<br>
detergent to the second spray nozzle 330.<br>
[100]	At this point, an extreme end of the second spray nozzle 330 may be exposed into<br>
the drum 130.<br>
[101]	More preferably, the extreme end of the second spray nozzle 330 is exposed into the<br>
drum 130, penetrating a portion (i.e., the gasket) through which the laundry is loaded<br>
in the drum.<br>
[ 102]	In order for the detergent to be forcedly directed from the dispenser 310 into the<br>
drum 130, the second spray nozzle 330 may be connected to a pumping unit such as a<br>
pump. However, by further providing an on/off valve 221 for opening/closing the<br>
detergent supply tube 320 on the tube 320, the detergent can be selectively supplied.<br>
[103]	The second spray nozzle 330 may be integrally formed with the first spray nozzle<br>
230 of the steam generating unit 300.<br>
[104]	An amount of water supply per minute of the water supply valve 118 to the<br>
dispenser 310 is designed to be greater than an amount of water supply per minute of<br>
the water supply valve 118 to the steam generating unit 200.<br>
[105] ' The circulating pump 400 is provided on the lower portion of the drum-type<br>
washing machine to circulate the water supplied.<br>
[106]	A fluid circulating tube 410 for sucking the washing water exhausted to a lower<br>
portion of the tub 120 and directing the sucked washing water to the other side of the<br>
circulating pump 400 is disposed between the circulating pump 400 and the tub 120.<br>
[ 107]	That is, the circulating pump 400 pumps out the washing water introduced. The<br>
washing water pumped out by the circulating pump 400 is directed into the tub 120 thr<br>
ough a front-upper portion of the tub 120, ascending along the fluid circulating tube<br>
410.<br>
[108]	By directing the washing water accumulated on the bottom of the tub 120 into the<br>
drum 130, the laundry can be uniformly wet and washing water can be saved.<br><br>
[109]	In this case, a filter (not shown) for filtering foreign objects contained in the<br>
washing water may be further provided on the circulating pump 400 or the fluid<br>
circulating tube 410.<br>
[110]	A drain pump (not shown) for draining the washing water after the washing and<br>
rinsing cycles are completed is installed on a lower portion of the washing machine.<br>
[Ill]	The drum-type washing machine of this embodiment further includes the dry unit.<br>
The dry unit includes a hot wind supply tube 181 supplying high temperature/dry air<br>
into the drum 130 and a dry heater 182 heating the air flowing along the hot wind<br>
supply tube 181.<br>
[112]	At this point, a flower fan 183 is provided on the hot wind supply tube 181 to<br>
forcedly direct the air out of the hot wind supply tube 181.<br>
[113]	The operation and control method of the above-described washing machine will be<br>
described hereinafter.<br>
[114]	FIG. 8 shows a graph showing a temperature variation in a drum during a washing<br>
operation of a drum-type washing machine of the present invention and FIG. 9 il-<br>
lustrates a flowchart of a method for controlling a drum-type washing machine of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[115]	When a user input a control signal to perform the washing cycle after loading the<br>
laundry into the drum, water is supplied into the tub 120 through the dispenser 310 to<br>
initiate the washing operation (S601).<br>
[116]	When the water supply is completed (S602), the steam generating unit 200 is<br>
operated to supply the high temperature/high pressure steam into the drum 130 for a<br>
predetermined time (a) to soak the laundry (S603).<br>
[117]	In this case, as shown in FIG. 8, the temperature in the drum 130 is gradually<br>
increased to T1 by the steam supplied.<br>
[118]	Here, the heating for supplying the steam is continued until a current detected<br>
temperature value T1 meets a first reference temperature value T1ref by detecting the<br>
internal temperature of the drum (S640) and comparing the first reference temperature<br>
value T1ref with the detected temperature value T1 (S604).<br>
[119]	When the current detected temperature value meets the first reference temperature<br>
value T1ref, the steam supply is stopped and the washing water is supplied again<br>
through the dispenser 310. The washing water supplied is circulated couple of times by<br>
the circulating pump 400 and then drained (S606).<br>
[120]	Since the washing water supplied is cool water for a time (a-a1) in the graph at<br>
which the water circulation/drain process is performed, the internal temperature of the<br>
drum 130 is reduced.<br>
[121]	After the above, the steam generating unit 200 is operated again to supply the steam<br>
into the drum 130 for a predetermined time (a1-b) to increase the temperature to T2<br><br>
(S607).<br>
[122]	That is, the internal temperature of the drum is detected (S608) and a second<br>
reference temperature value T2ref is compared with the detected temperature value<br>
T2(S609). The heating is continued until the detected temperature value T2 becomes<br>
identical to the second reference temperature value T2ref.<br>
[123]	When the detected temperature value T2 becomes identical to the second reference<br>
temperature value T2ref, the water circulation/drain process is performed for a pre-<br>
determined time (a1-b).<br>
[124]	The above described process is repeated by n times as shown in FIG. 8, in the<br>
course of which the internal temperature of the drum is repeatedly increased and<br>
reduced.<br>
[125]	In the final step of the washing operation, more amount of washing water than that<br>
of the foregoing steps to finally separate the stain from the laundry by being circulated<br>
by the circulation pump 400 and is then drained (S610).<br>
[126]	When only the steam is continuously supplied for a predetermined time without the<br>
water circulation and supply process, the laundry may be damaged as the internal<br>
temperature of the drum is excessively increased. Therefore, in the present invention,<br>
the steam supply process and the water circulation/drain process are alternately<br>
performed to prevent the internal temperature in the drum is increased too high.<br>
[127]	Since the temperature is designed to gradually slowly increased and a small amount<br>
of water is supplied and circulated during the washing operation, the washing water as<br>
well as the electricity can be saved.<br>
[128]	In this case, it is preferable that the drum is rotated with low speed during the steam<br>
supply from the steam generating unit 200 in order to maximize the stain separation<br>
and soaking effect.<br>
[129]	After the above-described washing processes are all finished, drain, rinsing (S611)<br>
and spinning (S612) cycles are processed.<br>
[130]	When the washing machine has the dry function as shown in FIG. 6, the dry cycle is<br>
started after the spinning cycle (S612) is finished (S613).<br>
[131]	That is, when the dry cycle is started, electric power is applied to the dry heater 182<br>
in the hot wind supply tube 181.<br>
[132]	At this point, the blower fan 183 forcedly ventilates the hot wind as the heater is<br>
operated.<br>
[133]	The hot wind is directed into the tub 120 by being guided by the hot wind supply<br>
tube 181 and is then directed to the drum 130 through the through holes (not shown).<br>
[134]	The hot wind fed to the drum 130 heats the laundry to vaporize the water contained<br>
in the laundry, in the course of which the drum 130 rotates with low speed to agitate<br>
the laundry, thereby uniformly heating the laundry and enhancing the vaporize of the<br><br>
water.<br>
[135]	The vaporized water is mixed with air and exhausted to be dried. The dried air is<br>
introduced into the hot wind supply tube 181 again. This process is repeated to dry the<br>
laundry.<br>
[136]	During the dry cycle, a predetermined amount of steam may be supplied using the<br>
steam generating unit in order to prevent the laundry from being wrinkled and to obtain<br>
the static electricity elimination effect.<br>
[137]	As described above, by alternately repeating the steam supply process and the water<br>
circulation/drain process, the internal temperature of the drum is gradually increased to<br>
prevent the laundry from being damaged and effectively separate the stain from the<br>
laundry.<br>
[138]	Therefore, it is required to set a repeating section of the steam supply process and<br>
the water circulation/drain process. In FIG. 9, a method for setting the repeating<br>
section by detecting the internal temperature of the drum and comparing the detected<br>
temperature with the reference temperature value is illustrated.<br>
[139]	Alternatively, a heating time for supplying the steam may be preset, based on which<br>
the steam supply process and the water circulation/drain process are alternately<br>
repeated to gradually increase the internal temperature of the drum.<br>
[140]	The heating times at each heating section may be preset to be identical with each<br>
other or may be preset to be gradually increased.<br>
