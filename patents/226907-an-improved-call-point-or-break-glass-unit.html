				<td>AN IMPROVED CALL POINT OR BREAK GLASS UNIT<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to call points or break glass<br>
units.<br>
In particular, it relates to call points for use in<br>
alarm systems, for example, fire alarm or intruder alarm<br>
systems, access control systems, or for other uses.<br>
Summary of the Prior Art<br>
Alarm systems generally comprise one or more<br>
sounders; which may be mechanical bells or electronic<br>
sounders, usually one or more detectors such as smoke<br>
detectors or heat detectors, and a central control panel.<br>
In addition, most alarm systems incorporate manual call<br>
points such that a person discovering a fire, which has<br>
not yet activated any sensors, can manually alert the<br>
system, and thereby the other occupants of the building.<br>
Call points are also used in access control systems, and<br>
other applications.<br>
The call points are most commonly of the break-glass<br>
type in which a piece of glass or other frangible<br>
material is positioned so that upon pressure being<br>
applied to the glass, the glass breaks, thus actuating<br><br>
the switch. The switch actuation sends an appropriate<br>
signal to the alarm system.<br>
Systems of this type work well, but clearly each<br>
time a call point is actuated, the piece of glass or<br>
other material is actually broken and must be replaced<br>
before it can be used again. This does have some<br>
advantages in that a broken frangible element is clearly<br>
seen and therefore one knows that it has been set off.<br>
As an alternative, some units include an element<br>
which is not broken but which is merely displaced upon<br>
actuation by finger pressure or similar, so that it<br>
releases the switch. The displaceable element can of<br>
course be re-used many times but must be manually<br>
repositioned after each use. Since there is no clear<br>
broken element to visually check that the unit has been<br>
actuated, it is a requirement that there be some clear<br>
indication that the unit has been actuated and awaits<br>
resetting.<br>
This is just generally done by providing a flag,<br>
generally having wording such as "alarm" on it or with<br>
some other visual indication and which is mechanically<br>
moved into a visible position when the unit is actuated.<br>
Up to now, this has been done by a complicated mechanical<br><br>
mechanism separate to the mechanism by which the plate is<br>
moved to instigate an alarm.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention arose in an attempt to provide<br>
an improved call point.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention<br>
there is provided call point comprising a movable<br>
element which is displaceable so as to cause a switch to<br>
indicate an alarm condition; and a flag for indicating<br>
that the call point has been actuated and requires<br>
resetting, wherein the flag is integral with the<br>
displaceable element so as to move, as the element moves,<br>
from a first position where it is not seen, to a second<br>
position where it is seen.<br><br>
Preferably, the element lies behind a viewing window<br>
such that in its unactuated position the flag is not<br>
viewed through the window but when actuated, the element<br>
moves to a position in which the flag is visible through<br>
the window.<br>
The displaceable element may be arranged to pivot<br>
into the alarm position, in which case the flag may<br>
preferably be provided with wording which is generally<br><br>
horizontal when the displaceable element is in the alarm<br>
position.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present<br>
an improved<br>
invention in a further aspect there is provided call<br>
A<br>
point comprising a housing, a frangible or movable<br>
element for breaking or moving under manual pressure; a<br>
switch which is actuated by movement or breakage of the<br>
element to indicate an alarm position, a spring means and<br>
a latch, wherein the latch is moulded as an integral part<br>
of the moulding.<br>
According to a third aspect of the invention there<br>
an improved<br>
is provided call point comprising a moveable element<br>
which is displaceable so as to cause the switch to<br>
indicate an alarm condition; and wherein a cam is<br>
provided having a part upon which the moveable element<br>
rests in an unactuated position, the cam being<br>
displaceable to reset the moveable element from its<br>
actuated to its unactuated position.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the invention there<br>
an improved<br>
is provided call point comprising the features of any.<br>
two or more of the preceding claims.<br>
Preferably, a pivot and a stop rib are also provided<br>
and these are also moulded as integral components of the<br>
housing. Locations for the spring and switch may also be<br><br>
moulded as integral components of the housing.<br>
The spring means may be a separate or integral<br>
component.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Referring to Figures 1 and 2, a call point comprises<br>
a housing 1 mounting a microswitch, or other switch<br>
device 2. A displaceable element 3, comprising a sheet,<br><br>
generally of a plastics material, is mounted, in the<br>
normal condition, between the<br>
microswitch and a latch 4. The latch 4 is preferably<br>
integrally moulded as part of the housing and is formed<br>
by an upwardly directed protrusion or finger. The latch<br>
holds the displaceable element in position so that it<br>
depresses the micro switch. A spring 5 is held in tension<br>
when the element is in this position. The element sits<br>
behind a viewing window 6 which is open to enable a<br>
finger to be placed through it to act upon the<br>
displaceable element to actuate the call point. The<br>
housing includes one or more recesses 20 and/or clips 21<br>
for attaching a front panel. <br>
In embodiments of the invention, an integral part of<br>
the displaceable element forms a flag 7. In the example<br>
shown, this is formed by an extended part of the<br>
displaceable element and bears the word ALARM. Of course,<br>
other suitable wording may be used, and/or colour<br>
indication (such as the colour red). As shown, normally<br>
the flag area is not within the viewing area 8 formed by<br>
window 6 and therefore cannot be seen. All that can be<br>
seen is a rectangular central portion of displaceable<br>
element 3 defined by the size of viewing area 8.<br>
Note that the flag may be a part which is connected<br><br>
to the displaceable element ( eg by a rigid link) so that<br>
it moves with the displaceable element from a position<br>
where it is not viewed, to one where it is viewed. The<br>
term 'integral' in the present specification includes<br>
such constructions.<br>
The displaceable element sits at one corner upon a<br>
pivot 9 and is spaced towards its other lower corner from<br>
a stop rib 10. Pivot 9 and stop rib 10 are also<br>
preferably integrally moulded with the housing 1, as are<br>
specific locations for the spring5 and micro switch 2.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show the call point in alarm<br>
condition. When a passer-by notices an emergency<br>
situation such as smoke or fire, he actuates the call<br>
point by depressing it inwardly as shown at A (Figure 4).<br>
This frees the lower end of the element from the latch 4<br>
and it is then pushed by spring 5 so that it pivots<br>
downwards about pivot point 9. Alternatively, the pivot<br>
point 9 could be omitted and the spring possibly<br>
positioned more centrally, or a further spring added,<br>
such that the entire plate drops. Edge II of the element<br>
drops until it abuts against stop rib 10. At this<br>
position, it does not contact microswitch 2. The<br>
microswitch is therefore released and a call point is<br>
actuated. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the spring<br><br>
may be omitted and gravity'alone used to enable the<br>
element to drop.<br>
It is seen that as the displaceable element drops so<br>
does the part 7 of the<br>
displaceable element which acts as a flag, and this is<br>
arranged to drop sufficiently so that the alarm wording<br>
can now been seen through the viewing window 6. Thus, an<br>
observer of the call point is immediately alerted that<br>
this switch is in alarm and, after the emergency<br>
situation has-passed, requires re-setting. A separate<br>
viewing window may alternatively be provided, through<br>
which the flag is visible.<br>
In a system such as that shown in which the<br>
displaceable element pivots, the flag and the associated<br>
wording are preferably printed or otherwise affixed on<br>
the displaceable element such that when the call point is<br>
in its alarm condition the wording is generally<br>
horizontal. This necessitates it being printed at a<br>
suitable angle, as shown in Figure I.<br>
One or more location lugs 12, 13 may be formed as<br>
inward projections from the housing and serve to<br>
correctly position and space the displacing element in<br>
its normal position.<br><br>
The housing is preferably of a plastics material<br>
and, as described, most preferably items such as the<br>
latch, pivot, stop rib and locations for the spring and<br>
micro switch are moulded as integral parts of the<br>
housing. This greatly eases manufacture and is a<br>
significant improvement over prior art designs in which<br>
separate latching components had to be manufactured and<br>
secured within the call point.<br>
Figures 5 to 10 show an alternative embodiments of<br>
the call point. In this, embodiment, a displaceable or<br>
breakable element 56 also includes a flag portion 57<br>
which is arranged to move into and out of a viewing<br>
window.<br>
The displaceable element 56 is held in a normal<br>
condition by a cam 58. This holds the element under<br>
tension from spring 55 so that micro switch 2 is<br>
depressed. The alarm flag is not seen. The cam is mounted<br>
on a pivot 59 but is prevented from rotation in the<br>
normal condition by a( clip 60(shown more clearly in<br>
Figure 8 in cross section). This shows that the clip 60<br>
includes an upper shoulder portion against which a<br>
surface of the cam 58 abuts when in the normal condition,<br>
preventing rotation of the cam about pivot 59. The clip<br>
60 is preferably moulded as part of the chassis of the<br><br>
call point and includes a ramp portion 61 tapering<br>
outwards from the bottom, so that as a key or other<br>
member is pushed upwards, generally along the line of the<br>
ramp, it pushes the ramp progressively back, and thereby<br>
pushes back the attached clip portion.<br>
Upon noting an alarm condition, or for testing the<br>
unit, a user pushes the<br>
displaceable member roughly out of position indicated by<br>
the arrows. This causes the displaceable member to deform<br>
so that its central portion is pushed inwardly, as is<br>
shown in Figure 9. It is thus pushed away from the top<br>
part 62 of the cam and moves underneath the cutaway—area<br>
62—on the cam under downwards pressure from the spring.<br>
It comes to rest upon a ledge portion 63 of the cam. Note<br>
that the various portions of the cam are shown more<br>
clearly in Figures 10{a)-(c). The displaceable element is<br>
still deformed.<br>
Since the displaceable element has now been pushed,<br>
downwards, the flag area 57 is now visible within the<br>
viewing window. The* micro switch 2 is now released and<br>
thus an alarm is signalled.<br>
The displaceable element pivots on the part 63 of<br><br>
the frame.<br>
In order to reset the element, a key 70 is used<br>
(Figure 7). The key is snaped to nave a portion /1<br>
complementary to a recessed part 72 of the cam.<br>
The key 70 is inserted and acts upon ramp part 61 to push<br>
clip 60 backwards (into the plane of the paper). As will<br>
be appreciated from Figure 8, pushing clip 60 backwards<br>
causes the cam to be released.<br>
As the key is further inserted, part 71 pushes<br>
against the edge of recess 72 and thus rotates the cam<br>
around (clockwise) to a position past the edge of the<br>
displaceable element 56. The displaceable element 56 then<br>
resumes its normal, flat, condition, as opposed to the<br>
deformed condition which it was held previously.<br>
Upon removal of the key, the opposite edge 73 of<br>
recess 72 is pulled back to rotate the cam back to its<br>
original position. As the displaceable element is now in<br>
its flat, configuration, it is pushed upwards by<br>
upstanding portion 62 of the cam and is therefore pushed<br>
back into its original "normal" condition. Clip 60 then<br>
locks back into place and the cam is locked back into its<br>
position by the clip area 60. Microswitch 2 is again<br>
depressed.<br><br>
Figures 10(a)-(c) show the cam in more detail and<br>
illustrate the upstand 62, ledge 63, recessed part 72 and<br>
a through hole 73 through which a pin or other means is<br>
inserted into the chassis, and about which the cam can<br>
rotate.<br>
The cam shape is only one of several different<br>
configurations and shapes of cams which may be used to<br>
have generally the same effect.<br>
Most call points are addressable devices. Thus, if a<br>
particular call point is actuated, it is possible to<br>
determine the address of that point on the system and<br>
therefore to know which call point has been actuated. It<br>
may also be possible to interrogate the call points from<br>
a central control unit for testing and to send messages<br>
to and from the call point.<br>
Addressing of a call point is generally achieved by<br>
using a DIL (dual-in-line) switch having a number of<br>
variations in settings of the switches to set a<br>
particular address. Call points generally comprise a back<br>
box, a chassis and a front cover, including the viewing<br>
window. The address DIL switch is conventionally located<br>
behind the chassis. On installation, the call point is<br>
bolted to a wall and left until commissioning. Then, to<br><br>
set the address code, the installer has to take the front<br>
cover off (usually by means of one or more screws),<br>
unbolt the chassis from the back box (usually with a<br>
plurality of bolts) and then pull the chassis out to<br>
locate the DIL switches. This can be time consuming and<br>
cumbersome.<br>
Figure 11 shows an embodiment of the present<br>
invention and shows, in exploded form, a back box 100, a<br>
chassis 101 and a front cover 102. The address DIL switch<br>
103 is located on the front surface 104 of the chassis<br>
101. The chassis is mounted to the back plate by bolts<br>
105 and the front panel is simply clipped in place, using<br>
means such as the recesses and clips shown on the housing<br>
(chassis) of Figure 1. The address DIL switch 103<br>
enables an address of the callpoint to be set by<br>
variations in its settings, as previously described. The<br>
switch 103 may be replaced by an electronic circuit which<br>
is remotely accessible from a control panel to which the<br>
callpoint is connected. The control panel sends signals<br>
to the electronic circuit which set that circuit (e.g. by<br>
setting a suitable electronic memory) to a suitable<br>
address. Thus the switch 103 represents a hardware<br>
method of setting the address and the electronic circuit<br>
(which would replace the switch 103 and be in the same<br><br>
location) represents a software method of setting the<br>
address.<br>
Commissioning can therefore be achieved, in<br>
embodiments of the invention, by just removing the front<br>
cover, which can be simply unclipped, eg by using test<br>
key 70, and then setting the address while the chassis is<br>
still mounted on the back box.<br>
The test key has a part may have is suitably shaped,<br>
or has a suitably shaped fob portion to enable the front<br>
panel to be removed. An LED or any other indicator may be<br>
mounted in a mounting part 107 , and viewed through a<br>
hole 106 in the front panel.<br>
Other electronic apparatus and devices, including<br>
the control electronics for the call point, may also be<br>
mounted on the front face of the chassis.<br><br>
