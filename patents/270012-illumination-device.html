Lighting Device<br>
The present invention relates to a lighting device comprising at least one<br>
light source and at least one diffusing element.<br>
Such lighting devices are widely used. For example, such lighting devices<br>
are used in motor vehicles, where they may assume the form of a tail light<br>
or headlight. At least the backup light and, for example, the brake light are<br>
generally located in the tail light or headlight [sic]. Recently there has<br>
been a design trend to also integrate the directional signal light, for<br>
example, into the tail light together with the tail [sic; backup] light and the<br>
brake light, and/or to integrate the directional signal light, for example, into<br>
the headlight.<br>
In one type of conventional lighting device having multiple light sources, a<br>
clear glass lens, for example, allows an unrestricted view of all<br>
components behind the lens. However, designers of vehicle lights such as<br>
headlights, directional signal lights, and/or tail lights, for example, must<br>
frequently meet the requirement for a uniform external appearance of<br>
these vehicle lights. Thus, with respect to the differently colored lights to<br>
be integrated into the headlight, for example a yellow directional signal<br>
light and a colorless low-beam light, it is undesirable for this color<br>
difference to be externally visible when neither of the lights is switched on.<br>
In order to provide lights having multiple light sources, for example lights<br>
for general illumination, headlights, directional signal lights, and/or tail<br>
lights for vehicles, or other lights for which it is not possible to see all the<br>
components behind same, for quite some time lights with headlight covers<br><br>
2<br>
have been used which have a prismatic design or the like on the exit or<br>
incident surface. As a result of the prismatic surface, directional light<br>
beams are refracted and/or reflected in various directions from each light<br>
source, depending on the particular location on the surface at which the<br>
light beam strikes the headlight cover. In this manner the directional light<br>
beam is converted to predominantly diffuse light radiation. As a result, the<br>
components located behind the headlight cover are not visible, and during<br>
operation the light sources essentially have the external appearance of a<br>
single homogeneous light source. In contrast, when prismatic headlight<br>
covers are used it is disadvantageous that their manufacture is complex,<br>
since a specific surface structure must be impressed during casting.<br>
Furthermore, in many cases a prismatic headlight cover is not desirable<br>
from a design standpoint because, for example, a uniform appearance of<br>
the headlights and body is preferred.<br>
An improved form of a generic lighting device is disclosed in<br>
DE 198 18 009 C2. The cited document describes a multilayer cover for<br>
multifunctional tail lights for onroad vehicles. The cover is composed<br>
essentially of a three-dimensionally deformed plastic film and at least one<br>
reinforcement layer made of plastic which has been extrusion molded<br>
onto the three-dimensionally deformed plastic film. One characteristic of<br>
these known covers is that the plastic film is designed as a light diffusion<br>
plate. In this manner the complex manufacture of light-diffusing optical<br>
elements integrally molded in one piece to the interior of conventional light<br>
covers is avoided. According to the disclosure, the light diffusion plate<br>
may be made of polycarbonate, for example, in which spheres or<br>
hemispheres in the form of homogeneously dispersed diffusing pigments<br>
are embedded. In<br><br>
3<br>
this respect, the cover disclosed in the cited document is an improvement<br>
over the prismatic headlight covers described in the preceding paragraph<br>
above. However, one disadvantage of the device disclosed in the cited<br>
document is that once again the manufacture of the proposed multilayer<br>
design is complicated, since it requires a method for producing<br>
multilayered structures. Since according to Claim 4 of the cited document<br>
it is proposed that the layer of the plastic film provided as a light diffusion<br>
plate has a thickness of 50 to 700 m, it is disadvantageous that a<br>
reinforcement layer must necessarily be applied for achieving the<br>
structural strength required for the headlight cover. The object of the<br>
present invention, therefore, is to provide a lighting device, comprising at<br>
least one light source and at least one diffusing element, which has a<br>
simple design and is economical to manufacture.<br>
The object is achieved by means of a lighting device comprising at least<br>
one light source and at least one diffusing element, whereby the diffusing<br>
element is composed of at least one diffusing plastic element in which<br>
transparent diffusing bodies are embedded in a transparent plastic mass,<br>
and the diffusing element extends over at least one or more light sources<br>
and is designed as an external housing part of the lighting device.<br>
The advantage of this approach is that the transparent plastic mass has<br>
the function of the reinforcement layer as well as the function of the light<br>
diffusion plate. In this manner, by using only one component which is<br>
composed of the transparent plastic mass containing embedded<br>
transparent diffusing bodies, it is advantageously possible to design, for<br>
example, a light for general illumination, a headlight, directional signal<br>
light, and/or tail light for vehicles, for example, or some other light, the<br><br>
4<br>
outer housing part of which intrinsically provides the function of light<br>
diffusion. The number of light sources may be advantageously reduced<br>
when a lighting device designed according to the invention is used. For<br>
example, the lighting device according to the invention may be used for<br>
lights for general illumination or in headlights, directional signal lights,<br>
and/or tail lights for vehicles, for industrial lights, lighted billboards, or<br>
deep-drawn lights such as square panels provided with neon lights, for<br>
example, such as those used in railway stations, for elongated lighting<br>
fixtures or other lights illuminated by a plurality of light-emitting diodes or a<br>
plurality of other light sources, which use a lower number of light-emitting<br>
diodes or other light sources than do conventional lights, since the<br>
intrinsic diffusion characteristics of the housing part convert the initial<br>
directionally emitted light from the light-emitting diodes or other light<br>
sources to essentially diffuse light radiation. From a design standpoint,<br>
this   has  the  advantage  that  the  light  for  general   illumination,   for<br>
headlights, directional signal lights, and/or tail lights for vehicles or any<br>
other   lighting   device   according   to   the   invention   appears   to   be<br>
homogeneously  illuminated  without the  multiple  light  sources  being<br>
separately visible. In applications in which differently colored light sources<br>
are present within the lighting device, for example in integrated directional<br>
signal lights and tail lights and/or headlights, use of the lighting device<br>
according to the invention  has the further advantage that the color<br>
difference   is   not   visible   in   daylight   in   the   shut-off   state.   This<br>
advantageously results in the uniform appearance of the lighting device<br>
frequently desired by designers.<br><br>
5<br>
In one particularly advantageous embodiment of the lighting device<br>
according to the invention, the transparent plastic mass is selected from<br>
the group comprising polycarbonates. Polycarbonates have the<br>
advantage that they possess particularly favorable material properties.<br>
The impact strength at low temperatures as well as resistance to high<br>
temperatures are particularly advantageous. In addition, the processing<br>
temperature of polycarbonates is particularly well suited for injection<br>
molding processes. The use of polycarbonates as a replacement for glass<br>
materials in the lighting devices according to the invention has the<br>
particular advantage of significant weight reduction. This results from the<br>
fact that the density of polycarbonate is less than half that of glass.<br>
Furthermore, in most cases polycarbonate is more economical than glass.<br>
Fireproof polycarbonates as well as high-temperature polycarbonates are<br>
also particularly suitable.<br>
When polycarbonates are used as the transparent plastic mass, it has<br>
proven to be particularly advantageous for the diffusion characteristics<br>
when the weight fraction of the embedded transparent diffusion bodies is<br>
0.0001 to 10%, preferably 1%, and the diffusion bodies preferably have a<br>
size of approximately 0.1 urn to 5 rn, preferably 2.5 urn. In addition, for<br>
achieving optimal homogenization of the light with regard to the<br>
transmission angle it is advantageous when the size of the diffusion<br>
bodies has a narrow Gaussian distribution composed of different sizes. Bi-<br>
and multimodal narrow Gaussian distributions have proven to be<br>
particularly suitable. Particularly good diffusion characteristics are also<br>
obtained when the inclusions have an essentially spherical shape. When<br>
the diffusion bodies are admixed with the polycarbonate, it has<br>
surprisingly been shown that in particular the desired mechanical<br>
properties of the polycarbonate are maintained. Thus, it is advantageous<br>
that the<br><br>
6<br>
mechanical properties of the polycarbonate are not adversely affected by<br>
admixture of the diffusion bodies. The use of polycarbonate together with<br>
the embedded diffusion bodies as described above according to the<br>
invention has the further advantage that in daylight, for example, a dark<br>
appearance considered to be particularly esthetic by designers is obtained<br>
when the light sources are not switched on. The polycarbonate may also<br>
be colored as desired, so that any given number of design color<br>
requirements may be met.<br>
According to one specialized embodiment of the lighting device according<br>
to the invention, the lighting device is designed for general illumination. In<br>
contrast to conventional lights for general illumination, which are usually<br>
made of glass, the lighting device according to the invention has the<br>
advantage of having approximately half the mass. A light designed<br>
according to the invention for general illumination also has advantages<br>
with regard to operational safety, since there is no risk of glass splinters<br>
resulting from, for example, external impacts or from breakage of the light<br>
caused by bursting of the light bulb. In addition, the light designed<br>
according to the invention for general illumination may advantageously be<br>
manufactured more economically than conventional lights, which often are<br>
made of glass. The design of the lighting device according to the invention<br>
as a light for general illumination is also very advantageous because, for<br>
example, when polycarbonate is used as the plastic element the superior<br>
deformability of this material allows manufacture of virtually any given<br>
shape of lights for general illumination. Thus, optimal use may<br>
advantageously be made of current commercial design trends for general<br>
illumination.<br><br>
7<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment of the lighting device<br>
according to the invention, the lighting device is designed as a directional<br>
signal light, in particular a directional signal light for vehicles, especially<br>
motor vehicles. In contrast to conventional prismatic or glass directional<br>
signal lights, such a directional signal light according to the invention is<br>
advantageous due to the weight savings compared to lights made of<br>
PMMA or glass. In addition, these directional signal lights may be<br>
manufactured more economically than conventional prismatic and/or<br>
PMMA or glass directional signal lights. In particular, this may<br>
advantageously be coordinated with the trend observed in the automobile<br>
industry toward increasingly smaller directional signal lights, while at the<br>
same time meeting automotive regulatory requirements for good visibility<br>
of the directional signal lights from the widest possible viewing angle.<br>
When according to one refinement of the invention the lighting device is<br>
designed as a multifunctional rear light and/or front light for vehicles, in<br>
particular motor vehicles, a directional signal light, for example, may<br>
advantageously be integrated into the headlight. It is thus possible, for<br>
example, to selectively provide only the segment of the multifunctional<br>
light with diffusive material which, for example, covers the directional<br>
signal light, in order to expand same without simultaneously expanding<br>
the light from the headlight, for example. When differently colored plastics<br>
are used in different segments of the multifunctional light according to the<br>
invention, prevailing design requirements may be easily and<br>
advantageously met.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment variant according to the<br>
present invention, the lighting device is designed as a tail light for<br>
vehicles,<br><br>
8<br>
in particular motor vehicles. In this case, integration of multiple lights, for<br>
example the directional signal light, backup light, and brake light, inside a<br>
lamp housing reduces the number of components needed for<br>
homogenization of light radiation emitted by light-emitting diodes or<br>
filament bulbs, for example, with benefits for the manufacturing costs. A<br>
further advantage of using polycarbonates is that this material is already<br>
widely used in particular in the automobile industry for fabrication of lamp<br>
covers. Therefore, a separate authorization procedure for this material for<br>
use as a headlight cover may be omitted for the most part. Therefore, in<br>
this sector the lighting device according to the invention may be rapidly<br>
employed to great advantage. The mechanical and thermal resistance of<br>
polycarbonates is particularly advantageous when the material is used for<br>
housing parts for ground vehicles, watercraft, and aircraft.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the lighting device is<br>
designed as a headlight for vehicles, in particular motor vehicles. In<br>
particular when the directional signal light is also integrated into the<br>
headlight, especially for motor vehicles, this has the advantage that the<br>
light source for producing the light for the directional signal, which is<br>
usually small relative to the headlight, is converted by diffusion into diffuse<br>
light having a large surface area. The visibility of the directional signal light<br>
is thus significantly improved, to great advantage. Producing diffuse light<br>
radiation for the directional signal light has the further advantage that the<br>
directional signal light is visible essentially from all important viewing<br>
angles. In particular, visibility from the side of the vehicle is especially<br>
advantageous for pedestrians, or for traffic on either side, is<br>
advantageous for traffic safety. In addition, as a result of the headlight<br>
cover<br><br>
9<br>
simultaneously having the characteristics of a headlight housing and of a<br>
diffusion plate it is not possible to see the internal components of the<br>
headlight, in particular the lenses inside the headlight. This has the<br>
advantage of providing less appeal for vandalism.<br>
In one refinement of the lighting device according to the invention, the<br>
lighting device is designed as a billboard. The advantage is that the<br>
uniformly homogeneous illumination desired for billboards is ensured, and<br>
at the same time the number of light sources used for illumination is<br>
reduced. Particularly for cases in which billboards are illuminated using a<br>
matrix of light-emitting diodes, the number of light pixels may be reduced<br>
with great cost savings due to the diffusive characteristics of the housing<br>
material according to the invention. Integration of the diffusive function<br>
directly into the housing part advantageously results in a very simple<br>
design of the billboard. Weight reduction is advantageously achieved<br>
when a billboard according to the invention is used to replace a<br>
conventional billboard made of PMMA or a similar material. Furthermore,<br>
in the event of breakage of the billboard, by vandalism, for example, there<br>
is a much lower safety risk since polycarbonate does not shatter.<br>
According to one refinement of the invention, the lighting device according<br>
to the invention is designed as an indoor light. In this manner the<br>
requirement to achieve diffuse illumination of a room using the fewest<br>
possible light sources, frequently imposed in particular by interior<br>
designers, may be advantageously met in a particularly economical<br>
manner. The fact that diffuse light is intrinsically produced within the<br>
housing of the indoor light eliminates the need for additional optical<br>
devices within the indoor light, thereby significantly reducing the<br><br>
10<br>
complexity of manufacture. Since the number of light sources, in particular<br>
filament bulbs or light-emitting diodes, may be reduced by the<br>
homogeneous distribution of the light radiation emitted by the light<br>
sources, this results in the additional advantage that the operating costs of<br>
an indoor light according to the invention are particularly low.<br>
In a further variant of the invention, the lighting device is designed as<br>
interior lighting for vehicles, in particular motor vehicles. By the fact that<br>
the interior lighting according to the invention produces essentially diffuse<br>
light as a result of its diffusive characteristics, an interior light is<br>
advantageously provided which largely eliminates an undesirable blinding<br>
effect for the driver, which frequently occurs for interior lights having a<br>
directional light beam. Since the light diffusion is ensured by the intrinsic<br>
optical properties of the housing of an interior light for vehicles designed<br>
according to this variant of the invention, a prismatic or similar plastic<br>
surface structuring, which is complicated from a manufacturing standpoint<br>
and often undesirable for optical design reasons, may be omitted, thus<br>
advantageously reducing the manufacturing costs. This variant of the<br>
invention is also well suited for use as ambient lighting in interior spaces<br>
or in the passenger cabin of aircraft.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the lighting device is designed as<br>
an emergency switch light. Since the plastic material may be deformed in<br>
practically any given shape, according to the invention the lighting device<br>
may advantageously be used for many different types of emergency<br>
switches, the emergency switches being lighted in such a way that such<br>
switches fulfill both a signal function and a lighting function. Thus,<br><br>
11<br>
emergency switches according to the invention may be used to great<br>
advantage, for example, for marking emergency exits in buildings, in<br>
industrial facilities, and on ships or aircraft. It is particularly advantageous<br>
that as a result of the diffuse light the illumination is visible from a wide<br>
viewing angle, thereby enhancing safety. In particular for emergency<br>
switches it is also very important that no glass be used, which due to<br>
breakage in a hazardous event, for example, could introduce an additional<br>
hazard source.<br>
The object of the invention is further achieved in a particularly effective<br>
manner by use of a plastic having an embedded light diffusing element, in<br>
which polycarbonate-acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (PC-ABS) is selected<br>
as the plastic.<br>
With regard to achieving the object of the invention, this material has the<br>
advantageous property that it may be electroplated, and also has an<br>
intense light-diffusing characteristic. Due to the capability for<br>
electroplating, assurance is provided that an adherent metal coating, such<br>
as chrome plating, may be applied on the surface of the material<br>
according to the appropriate known processes. As a result of embedding<br>
ABS, the material unexpectedly acquires enhanced transmission due to<br>
the increased light diffusion. This is all the more surprising since<br>
butadiene as such is known for its powerful light-absorbing properties.<br>
The invention is described in one preferred embodiment, with reference to<br>
a drawing by way of example.<br>
The drawing specifically shows the following:<br><br>
12<br>
Figure 1: shows a schematic illustration of a light according to the<br>
invention for general illumination;<br>
Figure 2 shows a schematic illustration of another light according to<br>
the invention for general illumination;<br>
Figure 3: shows a schematic illustration of a multifunctional tail light<br>
according to the invention;<br>
Figure 4 shows a schematic illustration of the configuration of<br>
directional signal lights according to the invention in a motor<br>
vehicle; and<br>
Figure 5 shows a schematic illustration of a tail light according to the<br>
invention, having multiple light-emitting diodes as light<br>
sources.<br>
Figure 1 schematically illustrates an oblong light for general illumination<br>
11. The light source 13 is located in the interior space 12 of the light for<br>
general illumination 11. The lamp cover 14 of the light for general<br>
illumination 11 has a parallelepiped shape, and is produced from<br>
polycarbonate mixed with spherical diffusing elements. As a result of the<br>
superior deformability of polycarbonate, the mechanical properties of<br>
which are not influenced by admixture of the diffusing elements, within the<br>
scope of the invention practically any other shape is possible besides the<br>
parallelepiped shape shown by way of example. At the upper side 15 the<br>
parallelepiped lamp cover 14 is divided into three segments 16, 17, 18.<br>
Each segment is composed of polycarbonate of a different color. The light<br>
source 13 emits essentially a concentrated light beam 5. The<br>
concentrated light beam 5 is converted to diffuse light radiation 8 in the<br>
lamp cover 14 composed of polycarbonate with embedded diffusing<br>
elements. In this manner a light which may have practically any given<br><br>
13<br>
shape is provided for general illumination 14 [sic; 11], by means of which<br>
the essentially directional light 8 from the light source 13 is converted to<br>
homogeneous, diffuse light radiation 8. In addition, the white light from the<br>
light source 13 is emitted in a color which may be different depending on<br>
the segment.<br>
Figure 2 schematically shows another light for general illumination 11,<br>
having a light source 13 located in the lamp cover 14. The light 11 is<br>
illustrated in a partial sectional view. The lamp cover 14 annularly<br>
encloses the light source 13 on the sides in the form of a lateral cylindrical<br>
surface, and also surrounds the light source on the top and bottom sides<br>
in the manner of a cap. The lamp cover 14 is also produced from<br>
polycarbonate mixed with spherical diffusing elements 3. Once again the<br>
light source 13 emits essentially a concentrated light beam 5. The<br>
concentrated light beam 5 is multiply diffused inside the lamp cover 14 by<br>
the diffusing elements 3, and in this manner is converted to diffuse light<br>
radiation 8. In addition, as a result of the light guide effect the lamp cover<br>
composed of polycarbonate mixed with diffusing elements 3 diffusely<br>
emits the light over the entire exterior surface 19 of the lamp cover 14.<br>
Figure 3 schematically illustrates the exterior of a multifunctional tail light<br>
for motor vehicles. The light cover 14 is divided into segments 16, 17, 18,<br>
and is composed of polycarbonate mixed with spherical diffusing<br>
elements. Segment 16 is produced from red-colored polycarbonate,<br>
segment 17, from yellow-colored polycarbonate, and segment 18, from<br>
transparent colorless polycarbonate. Inside the housing 4 for the<br>
multifunctional tail light are located three light-emitting diodes 1, each<br>
associated with one of segments 16, 17, 18. Each light-emitting diode 1<br><br>
14<br>
emits concentrated light beams 5. The concentrated light beams are<br>
multiply diffused by the diffusing elements which are mixed through the<br>
entire volume of the housing 4, and emerge from the light cover 14 in<br>
segments 16, 17, 18 as diffuse light radiation 8.<br>
This specialized embodiment according to the invention provides a<br>
multifunctional tail light in which the red-colored segment 16 has the<br>
function of a tail light, the yellow-colored segment 17 has the function of a<br>
directional signal light, and the colorless segment 18 has the function of a<br>
backup light during backward travel. The multiple diffusion of the light<br>
inside the light cover 14 ensures that the light is easily visible from<br>
different viewing angles, and also that the surface area of each segment<br>
16, 17, 18 is illuminated.<br>
Figure 4 schematically shows the configuration of directional signal lights<br>
20 on a motor vehicle. The directional signal lights 20, produced from<br>
polycarbonate with embedded diffusing elements, emit diffuse light<br>
radiation 8. The diffuse light radiation 8 emitted by each directional signal<br>
light 20 is easily seen by observer 21 as well as by observer 22, although<br>
observers 21, 22 observe the directional signal light 20 from very different<br>
viewing angles.<br>
Figure 5 shows a brake light containing three light-emitting diodes 1. The<br>
light-emitting diodes 1 are located inside a cover plate 2 for the brake<br>
light. The cover plate 2 is produced from polycarbonate mixed with<br>
spherical diffusing elements 3. At the same time the cover plate 2 forms<br>
the housing 4 for the tail light.<br><br>
15<br>
When the tail light is operating, each of the light-emitting diodes 1 emits<br>
essentially a concentrated light beam 5. The concentrated light beam 5<br>
from each of the light-emitting diodes 1 strikes the interior 6 of the cover<br>
plate 2. The concentrated light beam 5 does not strike the unlighted area<br>
section 9 of the interior 6 of the cover plate 2. Inside the cover plate 2 for<br>
the tail light the concentrated light beams 5 are multiply diffused by the<br>
diffusing elements 3 embedded in the polycarbonate. Diffuse light<br>
radiation emerges at the exterior 7 of the cover plate 2. Thus, diffuse light<br>
radiation 8 is emitted from the cover plate 2 over the entire surface of the<br>
exterior 7. In addition, the area sections 10 on the exterior 7 of the cover<br>
plate 2, opposite from the unlighted area sections 9 in the interior 6, emit<br>
diffuse light radiation 8. Thus, by means of a tail light composed of<br>
surprisingly few components, diffuse light radiation 8 may be emitted from<br>
the entire exterior 7 of the cover plate 2, although the concentrated light<br>
beams 5 from the light-emitting diodes 1 do not illuminate the area<br>
sections 9 on the interior 6 of the cover plate 2.<br><br>
