				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
RECIPROCATING ENGINE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a reciprocating engine for use in an automobile<br>
or the like.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As a reciprocating engine of this type, a reciprocating engine has been<br>
proposed in JP-A-5-180069 in which, in order to reduce sliding frictional resistance<br>
between a side surface of a piston and an inner surface of a cylinder which increases as<br>
a connecting rod is inclined in an explosion stroke (combustion stroke), a second piston<br>
ring (second ring) adjacent to a first piston ring (top ring) is inclined with respect to the<br>
first piston ring, and a combustion chamber and an annular gas chamber between the<br>
first and second piston rings are communicated through a gas passage. In such a<br>
reciprocating engine, the support of the piston (gas-pressure support) on the thrust side<br>
occurring on the basis of the gas pressure of the annular gas chamber is increased by<br>
tilting the second piston ring, so as to reduce the sliding frictional resistance between<br>
the inner surface of the cylinder, on the one hand, and the side surfaces of the piston<br>
rings and the side surface of the piston, on the other hand, due to the lateral pressure of<br>
the piston.<br>
In addition, as another reciprocating engine of this type, a reciprocating engine<br>
has been proposed in JP-A-5-5459 in which, in order to reduce the sliding frictional<br>
resistance between the inner surface of the cylinder and the side surface of the piston in<br>
the reciprocating motion of the piston, a second piston ring (second ring) adjacent to a<br>
first piston ring (top ring) is inclined with respect to the first piston ring. In such a<br>
reciprocating engine, the lateral pressure on the thrust side occurring on the basis of<br>
combustion gases is increased by tilting the second piston ring, so as to reduce the<br>
thrust-side sliding frictional resistance between the inner surface of the cylinder, on the<br>
one hand, and the side surfaces of the piston rings and the side surface of the piston, on<br>
the other hand, which can increase on the basis of the gas pressure and the like of the<br>
combustion gases in the combustion chamber with respect to the piston.<br>
Incidentally, in such a reciprocating engine, if the second piston ring is<br>
inclined to gas-pressure support the piston by generating gas pressure which resists the<br>
lateral pressure of the piston, the volume on the thrust side of the annular gas chamber<br>
defined by the first and second piston rings becomes greater than the volume on the<br>
counter-thrust side thereof. Therefore, a required amount of combustion gases in the<br>
combustion chamber cannot be speedily introduced into the annular gas chamber<br>
through a single gas passage. Hence, it is difficult to substantially reduce the sliding<br>
frictional resistance between the cylinder, on the one hand, and the piston rings and the<br>
side surface of the piston, on the other hand, by generating desired supporting force.<br>
In a case where the second piston ring is inclined greatly or in a case where the period<br>
of communication between the combustion chamber and the annular gas chamber per<br>
reciprocating motion becomes short due to the high-speed rotation of the reciprocating<br>
engine, it can become even more difficult to introduce a required amount of combustion<br>
gases in the combustion chamber speedily into the annular gas chamber.<br>
In addition, with the above-described other reciprocating engine, if the second<br>
piston ring is inclined greatly so as to generate large lateral pressure on the thrust side,<br>
there is a possibility that the inclined second piston ring interferes with an oil ring.<br>
Accordingly, it is difficult to substantially reduce the sliding frictional resistance between the<br>
cylinder, on the one hand, and the piston rings and the side surface of the piston by generating desired<br>
lateral pressure.<br>
The present invention has been devised in view of the above-described aspects, and its object<br>
is to provide a reciprocating engine which is capable of speedily introducing a necessary amount of<br>
gases in the combustion chamber into and causing it to act in the annular gas chamber with necessary<br>
force during a starting period of the fall of the piston in the explosion stroke and of generating a<br>
desired gas-pressure supporting force, thereby making it possible to substantially reduce the sliding<br>
frictional resistance between the cylinder, on the one hand, and the piston rings and the side surface<br>
of the piston, on the other hand.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a reciprocating engine which is capable<br>
of eliminating the interference of the piston ring with the oil ring and of generating the desired lateral<br>
pressure, thereby making it possible to substantially reduce the sliding frictional resistance between<br>
the cylinder, on the one hand, and the piston rings and the side surface of the piston, on the other<br>
hand.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
In Figs. 1 to 8, a four-cycle gasoline engine 1 serving as a reciprocating engine<br>
in accordance with this embodiment is comprised of a piston ring (top ring)5 adjacent<br>
to a top surface (head end face) 4 of a piston 3 defining a combustion chamber 2; a<br>
piston ring 7 which defines an annular gas chamber 6 in cooperation with the piston<br>
ring 5 and which is adjacent to the piston ring 5 such that the pressure-receiving area of<br>
a side surface 8 of the piston 3 in the annular gas chamber 6 becomes greater on a thrust<br>
side 10 than on a counter-thrust side 9 of the piston 3; a plurality of gas passages 15<br>
which are disposed in an inner surface 14 of a cylinder 13 in such a manner as to be<br>
juxtaposed in a circumferential direction X of the inner surface 14 of the cylinder 13<br>
and which allow the annular gas chamber 6 to communicate with the combustion<br>
chamber 2 on the thrust side 10; and an oil ring 16 disposed in such a manner as to<br>
oppose the piston ring 5 with the piston ring 7 located therebetween in a reciprocating<br>
direction Y of the piston 3.<br>
Ring grooves, which are disposed in such a manner as to respectively<br>
correspond to the piston rings 5 and 7 and the oil ring 16, are formed in the side surface<br>
8 contiguous to the top surface 4 of the piston 3. The piston rings 5 and 7 and the oil<br>
ring 16 are respectively fitted in the ring grooves. The top surface 4 is formed on the<br>
piston 3 so as to be parallel to a plane perpendicular to the reciprocating direction Y.<br>
The side surface 8 is formed on the piston 3 so as to be parallel to the reciprocating<br>
direction Y.<br>
In this embodiment, a connecting rod 22, which has a small end portion 22a<br>
rotatably coupled to the piston 3 through a piston pin 21 and a large end portion to<br>
which a crankshaft is rotatably coupled, is arranged such that its large end portion is<br>
disposed more on the counter-thrust side than its small end portion 22a when the piston<br>
is reciprocated in a direction Y1, as shown in Figs. 1 and 7.<br>
The cylinder 13 has a cylinder bore (space) 25 defined by its inner surface 14,<br>
and the piston 3 is disposed in the cylinder bore 25 such that the piston 3 is<br>
reciprocatable in the reciprocating direction Y. A cylinder head 13a is provided with<br>
an ignition plug 26, an intake valve 27, and an exhaust valve 28. The inner surface 14<br>
is formed in the cylinder 13 so as to be parallel to the reciprocating direction Y.<br>
The piston ring 5 is fitted in the ring groove of the piston 3 such that the piston<br>
ring 5 is normally parallel to the top surface 4 of the piston 3 defining the combustion<br>
chamber 2. The piston ring 5 has an annular defining surface 5a defining the<br>
combustion chamber 2, an annular defining surface 5b defining the annular gas<br>
chamber 6, and a sliding side surface 5c which is contiguous to the annular defining<br>
surfaces 5a and 5b and slides on the inner surface 14 of the cylinder 13. The annular<br>
defining surfaces 5a and 5b are disposed so as to be parallel to a plane perpendicular to<br>
the reciprocating direction Y. The sliding side surface 5c is formed on the piston ring<br>
5 so as to be parallel to the reciprocating direction Y. The piston ring 5 in this<br>
embodiment is formed with a thin wall so as to be able to define the combustion<br>
chamber 2 and the annular gas chamber 6.<br>
The piston ring 7 is fitted in the ring groove of the piston 3 by being inclined<br>
with respect to the reciprocating direction Y so as to gradually move away from the<br>
piston ring 5 as viewed in the direction from the counter-thrust side 9 toward the thrust<br>
side 10. The piston ring 7 has an annular defining surface 7a disposed on the piston<br>
ring 5 side and defining the annular gas chamber 6, an annular surface 7b disposed on<br>
the oil ring 16 side and opposing the annular defining surface 7a, and a sliding side<br>
surface 7c which slides on the inner surface 14 of the cylinder 13. The annular<br>
defining surface 7a and the annular surface 7b are inclined with respect to the<br>
reciprocating direction Y so as to be located further away from the annular defining<br>
surface 5b on their portions on the thrust side 10 than on their portions on the<br>
counter-thrust side 9. The distance in the reciprocating direction Y from the portion of<br>
the annular defining surface 5b on the thrust side 10 to the portion of the annular<br>
defining surface 7a on the thrust side 10 is longer than the distance in the reciprocating<br>
direction Y from the portion of the annular defining surface 5 b on the counter-thrust<br>
side 9 to the portion of the annular defining surface 7a on the counter-thrust side 9.<br>
The annular gas chamber 6 is defined by the side surface 8 of the piston 3, the<br>
inner surface 14 of the cylinder 13, and the piston rings 5 and 7. Here, the volume of<br>
the annular gas chamber 6 is large on the thrust side 10 but is small on the<br>
counter-thrust side 9 since the piston ring 7 is disposed in an inclined manner, as<br>
described above.<br>
The oil ring 16 in this embodiment is fitted in the ring groove of the piston 3 so<br>
as to be parallel to the piston ring (top ring) 5. The oil ring 16 has an annular surface<br>
16a on the piston ring 7 side opposing the annular surface 7b, an annular surface 16b on<br>
the piston pin 21 side opposing the annular surface 16a in the reciprocating direction Y,<br>
and a sliding side surface 16c which is contiguous to the annular surfaces 16a and 16b<br>
and slides on the inner surface 14. The annular surfaces 16a and 16b in this<br>
embodiment are disposed so as to be parallel to the plane perpendicular to the<br>
reciprocating direction Y. The sliding side surface 16c is formed on the oil ring 16 so<br>
as to be parallel to the reciprocating direction Y.<br>
In this embodiment, the inner surface 14 of the cylinder 13 is provided with<br>
three gas passage 15. The three gas passages 15 respectively have recessed portions<br>
17a, 17b, and 17c which are disposed in the inner surface 14 of the cylinder 13 at<br>
positions for allowing the annular gas chamber 6 to communicate with the combustion<br>
chamber 2 when the piston 3 is positioned in the vicinity of the top dead center. The<br>
recessed portions 17a, 17b, and 17c in this embodiment are respectively formed in the<br>
inner surface 14 opposing the side surface 8 so as to respectively allow only the annular<br>
gas chamber 6 to communicate with the combustion chamber 2 simultaneously in a case<br>
where the piston 3 is present at a position corresponding to approximately 6 degrees to<br>
approximately 37 degrees in terms of the crank angle concerning the reciprocating<br>
direction Y.<br>
The recessed portion 17b is disposed between the recessed portion 17a and 17c<br>
in the circumferential direction X, and the recessed portions 17a and 17c are opposed to<br>
each other in an axial direction A of the piston pin 21. The interval between the<br>
recessed portions 17a and 17b in the circumferential direction X and the interval<br>
between the recessed portions 17b and 17c in the circumferential direction X are<br>
substantially equal to each other. The recessed portions 17a, 17b, and 17c in this<br>
embodiment have shapes substantially similar to each other. In this embodiment, the<br>
distance in the reciprocating direction Y from the cylinder head 13a to the recessed<br>
portion 17a, the distance in the reciprocating direction Y from the cylinder head 13a to<br>
the recessed portion 17B, and the distance in the reciprocating direction Y from the<br>
cylinder head 13a to the recessed portion 17C are substantially equal to each other.<br>
A center portion C2 of a circular opening plane 31b of a space 30b defined by<br>
the recessed portion 17b, in this example, is disposed in such a manner as to oppose a<br>
center portion O of the piston 3 concerning a direction Z which is perpendicular to the<br>
axial direction A and the reciprocating direction Y, as shown in Fig. 3. The recessed<br>
portion 17b is located further away from the counter-thrust side 9 than the recessed<br>
portions 17a and 17c.<br>
An intersection angle 35 between a line 80 extending in the axial direction A<br>
and a line 32 connecting the center portion O of the piston 3 and a center portion C1 of<br>
an opening plane 31a of a space 30a defined by the recessed portion 17a, and an<br>
intersection angle 37 between the line 80 and a line 36 connecting the center portion O<br>
of the piston 3 and a center portion C3 of an opening plane 31c of a space 30c defined<br>
by the recessed portion 17c, are substantially equal to each other.<br>
The recessed portion 17a in this embodiment has a partially concave spherical<br>
surface 41a having a contiguous portion 40a contiguous to the inner surface 14 of the<br>
cylinder 13. The partially concave spherical surface 41a defines the space 30a having<br>
the circular opening plane 31a. The recessed portion 17b in this embodiment has a<br>
partially concave spherical surface 41b having a contiguous portion 40b contiguous to<br>
the inner surface 14 of the cylinder 13. The partially concave spherical surface 41b<br>
defines the space 30b having the circular opening plane 31b. The recessed portion 17c<br>
in this embodiment has a partially concave spherical surface 41c having a contiguous<br>
portion 40c contiguous to the inner surface 14 of the cylinder 13. The partially<br>
concave spherical surface 41c defines the space 30cb having the circular opening plane<br>
31c. It should be noted that the recessed portions 17a, 17b, and 17c may respectively<br>
have angular surfaces instead of the partially concave spherical surfaces 41a, 41b, and<br>
41c. Further, each of the contiguous portions 40a, 40b, and 40c may be provided with<br>
slight chamfering.<br>
The partially concave spherical surfaces 41a, 41b, and 41c in this<br>
embodiment have mutually equal curvatures and depths in the direction perpendicular<br>
to the reciprocating direction Y. The circular opening planes 31a, 31b, and 31c in this<br>
embodiment have mutually equal diameters.<br>
The recessed portion 17b in this embodiment is provided in the inner surface<br>
14 such that an intersection angle 44 between a tangential line 42 to the contiguous<br>
portion 40b and a line 43 extending in the reciprocating direction Y assumes an obtuse<br>
angle, as shown in Fig. 4. In this embodiment, the lines 42 tangential to portions 45<br>
and 46 of the contiguous portion 40b opposing each other in the reciprocating direction<br>
Y intersect each other at a point of intersection P at a position located further away<br>
from the piston 3 than the portions 45 and 46 in the direction perpendicular to the<br>
reciprocating direction Y. The distance L1 between the portions 45 and 46 in the<br>
reciprocating direction Y is longer than the distance L2 from the annular defining<br>
surface 5a to the annular defining surface 5b in the reciprocating direction Y. In other<br>
words, the interval between these portions 45 and 46 is greater than the thickness of the<br>
piston ring 5. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the distance L1 is shorter than the distance L3 in<br>
the reciprocating direction Y from the portion on the thrust side 10 of the annular<br>
defining surface 5b to the portion on the thrust side 10 of the annular defining surface<br>
7a. The diameter of the opening plane 31b of the space 30b defined by the recessed<br>
portion 17b is greater than the depth of that recessed portion 17b in the direction<br>
perpendicular to the reciprocating direction Y. It should be noted that, in this<br>
embodiment, since the contiguous portions 40a and 40c are constructed in the same<br>
way as the contiguous portion 40b, a detailed description thereof will be omitted.<br>
To describe the operation of the reciprocating engine 1 in this embodiment, in<br>
the compression stroke, when the annular defining surface 5b of the piston ring 5 is<br>
positioned closer to the cylinder head 13a side than the portion 46 on the piston pin 21<br>
side of the recessed portion 17b opposing the portion 45 on the cylinder head 13a side<br>
thereof while the piston 3 is positioned in the vicinity of the top dead center and before<br>
it reaches the top dead center, the combustion chamber 2 communicates with the<br>
annular gas chamber 6 through the recessed portion 17b, and low-pressure compressed<br>
gases start to enter the annular gas chamber 6 from the combustion chamber 2. Here,<br>
since the piston ring 5 is disposed so as to be parallel to the top surface 4, the<br>
combustion chamber 2 is communicated with the annular gas chamber 6 also through<br>
the spaces 30a and 30c defined by the recessed portions 17a and 17c juxtaposed to the<br>
recessed portion 17b in the circumferential direction X simultaneously with its<br>
communication with the annular gas chamber 6 through the space 30b. As a result, the<br>
low-pressure compressed gases enter the annular gas chamber 6 from the plurality of<br>
portions on the thrust side 10.<br>
Next, in the explosion stroke (combustion stroke) shown in Figs. 1, 6, and 8(c),<br>
during the starting period of the fall of the piston 3, i.e., when the piston 3 falls in the<br>
vicinity of the top dead center, combustion gases 51 in the combustion chamber 2 are<br>
introduced into the annular gas chamber 6 through the recessed portions 17a, 17b, and<br>
17c. The gas pressure within the annular gas chamber 6 is increased by the gas<br>
pressure of the introduced combustion gases 51, so that the piston 3 which is<br>
gas-pressure supported on the basis of that gas pressure falls toward the bottom dead<br>
center. Here, a forward moving force directed in the direction Y1 is imparted to the<br>
connecting rod 22 tilted with respect to the reciprocating direction Y from the piston 3<br>
which is being moved forward while being gas-pressure supported by the gas pressure<br>
being held in the annular gas chamber 6. Consequently, a lateral pressure Bl directed<br>
• toward the thrust side 10 is imparted to the piston 3. However, in opposition to that<br>
lateral pressure Bl, a supporting force B2 directed toward the counter-thrust side 9 is<br>
imparted to the piston 3 by the gas pressure supplied sufficiently to the interior of the<br>
annular gas chamber 6, thereby gas-pressure supporting the piston 3. It should be<br>
noted that in the case where the piston 3 is positioned at the top dead center, as shown<br>
in Fig. 6, the communication between the combustion chamber 2 and the annular gas<br>
chamber 6 through the recessed portions 17a, 17b, and 17c is stopped in this<br>
embodiment, as particularly shown in Fig. 8(b), but the communication may be<br>
allowed.<br>
In the reciprocating engine 1 constructed as described above, since the piston 3<br>
is brought to the position where the combustion chamber 2 and the annular gas chamber<br>
6 are communicated through the recessed portions 17a, 17b, and 17c during the<br>
combustion, the gas pressure which is generated through combustion in the combustion<br>
chamber 2 in the combustion stroke is speedily introduced thoroughly into the annular<br>
gas chamber 6 through the recessed portions 17a, 17b, and 17c. Upon receiving the<br>
biased pressure within the annular gas chamber 6 on the basis of this introduced gas<br>
pressure, the piston 3 is gas-pressure supported at the inner surface 14, particularly at<br>
the portion on the thrust side 10 of the inner surface 14, in its reciprocating motion.<br>
The piston 3 which is supported by the gas pressure reciprocates with an extremely low<br>
sliding frictional resistance. In addition, in such reciprocating motion, although the<br>
piston 3 tends to be swung (oscillated) within the plane perpendicular to the axial<br>
direction A about the piston pin 21, this swinging motion is prevented by the<br>
aforementioned gas pressure of the annular gas chamber 6. The piston 3 can thus be<br>
reciprocated with an extremely low sliding frictional resistance, thereby making it<br>
possible to attain an improvement and the like of the fuel consumption of the<br>
reciprocating engine 1.<br>
According to the reciprocating engine 1 of this embodiment, the reciprocating<br>
engine 1 is comprised, of the piston ring 5 adjacent to the top surface 4 of the piston 3<br>
defining the combustion chamber 2; the piston ring 7 which defines the annular gas<br>
chamber 6 in cooperation with the piston ring 5 and which is adjacent to the piston ring<br>
5 such that the pressure-receiving area of the side surface 8 of the piston 3 in the<br>
annular gas chamber 6 becomes greater on the thrust side 10 than on the counter-thrust<br>
side 9; the plurality of gas passages 15 which are disposed in the inner surface 14 of the<br>
cylinder 13 in such a manner as to be juxtaposed in the circumferential direction X of<br>
the inner surface 14 of the cylinder 13 and which allow the annular gas chamber 6 to.<br>
communicate with the combustion chamber 2 on the thrust side. Therefore, the<br>
combustion gases 51 in the combustion chamber 2 can be speedily introduced<br>
thoroughly into the annular gas chamber 6 through the plurality of gas passages 15.<br>
Hence, a desired supporting force can be generated on the basis of the combustion gases<br>
51 in the annular gas chamber 6 thus introduced and caused to act, and the piston 3 is<br>
gas-pressure supported with respect to the inner surface 14. It is thereby possible to<br>
substantially reduce the sliding frictional resistance between the inner surface 14 of the<br>
cylinder 13, on the one hand, and the sliding side surface 5c of the piston ring 5 and the<br>
side surface 8 of the piston 3, on the other hand. Since the plurality of gas passages 15<br>
respectively have the recessed portions 17a, 17b, and 17c which are disposed in the<br>
inner surface 14 at positions for allowing the annular gas chamber 6 to communicate<br>
with the combustion chamber 2 when the piston 3 is lowered in the vicinity of the top<br>
dead center, the combustion gases 51 can be forcibly introduced into and caused to act<br>
in the annular gas chamber 6 through the recessed portions 17a, 17b, and 17c in the<br>
vicinity of the top dead center. Furthermore, it is possible to increase the gas pressure<br>
within the annular gas chamber 6, and the piston 3 can be lowered (forwardly moved)<br>
while this gas pressure is being held. Particularly in the explosion stroke, the piston 3<br>
can be suitably gas-pressure supported in opposition to the lateral pressure of the piston.<br>
Since the center portion C2 of the opening plane 31b of the space 30b defined by the<br>
recessed portion 17b is disposed in such a manner as to oppose the center portion O of<br>
the piston 3 concerning the direction Z, the compressed gases can be introduced<br>
preceding with the portion on the thrust side 10 of the annular gas chamber 6 whose<br>
volume is greater than the portion on the counter-thrust side 9 of the annular gas<br>
chamber 6. Accordingly, the combustion gases 51 can be speedily introduced more<br>
thoroughly into the annular gas chamber 6 and caused to act. Since the distance from<br>
the cylinder head 13a to the recessed portion 17a in the reciprocating direction Y and<br>
the distance from the cylinder head 13a to the recessed portion 17c are mutually equal,<br>
the communication between the combustion chamber 2 and the annular gas chamber 6<br>
through the pair of recessed portions 17a and 17c can be started or terminated<br>
simultaneously and extensively. Thus, the combustion gases 51 can be more speedily<br>
and extensively introduced into and caused to act in the annular gas chamber 6. Since<br>
the recessed portions 17a, 17b, and 17c respectively have the partially concave<br>
spherical surfaces 41a, 41b, and 41c, resistance is not encountered in the influx of the<br>
combustion gases 51, and uniform and satisfactory introduction and action can be<br>
obtained. Further, the intersection angle 44 between the line 43 extending in the<br>
reciprocating direction Y and the tangential line 42 to the contiguous portion 40b of the<br>
partially concave spherical surface 41b contiguous to the inner surface 14 of the<br>
recessed portion 17b assumes an obtuse angle. Still further, the lines 42 tangential to<br>
the portions 45 and 46 of the contiguous portion 40b opposing each other in the<br>
reciprocating direction Y intersect each other at a position located further away from<br>
the piston 3 than the portions 45 and 45 in the direction perpendicular to the<br>
reciprocating direction Y. Furthermore, the recessed portions 17a and 17c are<br>
constructed in the same way as the recessed portion 17b. Therefore, the combustion<br>
gases 51 can be introduced extensively. The recessed portion 17b has a curvature<br>
which is mutually equal to the curvatures of the recessed portions 17a and 17c adjacent<br>
to that recessed portion 17b in the circumferential direction X. In addition, the<br>
recessed portion 17b has a depth equal to the depths of the recessed portions 17a and<br>
17c adjacent to that recessed portion 17b in the circumferential direction X. Therefore,<br>
since the recessed portions 17a, 17b, and 17c are respectively designed in connection<br>
with their curvatures and depths and are disposed in the inner surface 14, the<br>
combustion chamber 2 and the annular gas chamber 6 can be communicated with each<br>
other by means of the recessed portions 17a, 17b, and 17c in a similar manner,<br>
respectively. The intersection angle 35 between the line 80 extending in the axial<br>
direction A and the line 32 connecting the center portion O of the piston 3 and the<br>
center portion C1 of the opening plane 31a of the space 30a defined by the recessed<br>
portion 17a, and the intersection angle 37 between the line 80 and the line 36<br>
connecting the center portion O of the piston 3 and the center portion C3 of the opening<br>
plane 31c of the space 30c defined by the recessed portion 17c, are substantially equal<br>
to each other. Further, the recessed portions 17a and 17c have mutually identical<br>
shapes. Therefore, the combustion gases 51 can be introduced uniformly into one side<br>
and the other side of the combustion chamber 6 concerning the axial direction A.<br>
Since the opening plane 31b of the space 30b defined by the recessed portion 17b has a<br>
diameter substantially equal to the diameters of the opening planes 31a and 31c of the<br>
spaces 30a and 30c defined by the other recessed portions 17a and 17c, the combustion<br>
chamber 2 and the annular gas chamber 6 can be communicated in a similar state by the<br>
recessed portions 17a, 17b, and 17c, and the communication can be simultaneously<br>
started or terminated. Since the annular defining surface 5a is disposed so as to be<br>
parallel to the plane perpendicular to the reciprocating direction Y, and the annular<br>
defining surface 5b is disposed so as to be parallel to the plane perpendicular to the<br>
reciprocating direction Y, the communication between the combustion chamber 2 and<br>
the annular gas chamber 6 by the recessed portions 17a, 17b, and 17c, which are<br>
juxtaposed to each other in the circumferential direction, can be simultaneously started<br>
or terminated.<br>
It should be noted that, as shown in Fig. 9, the reciprocating engine 1 of this<br>
embodiment may have, instead of the recessed portion 17b, for instance, a recessed<br>
portion 52 which is located most away from the portion on the counter-thrust side 9 of<br>
the piston 3 and is disposed further away from the cylinder head 13a than the other<br>
recessed portions 17a and 17c concerning the reciprocating direction Y. By virtue of<br>
such a recessed portion 52, the gases can be introduced from the portion on the thrust<br>
side 10 of the annular gas chamber 6 whose volume is greater than the portion on the<br>
counter-thrust side 9 of the annular gas chamber 6 in advance of the recessed portions<br>
17a and 17c. Accordingly, the combustion gases 51 can be introduced more<br>
thoroughly and speedily into the annular gas chamber 6. It should be noted that the<br>
recessed portion 52 may be disposed in the inner surface 14 of the cylinder 13 by<br>
replacing at least one of the recessed portions 17a, 17b, and 17c or in addition to the<br>
recessed portions 17a, 17b, and 17c. By disposing such a recessed portion 52, the<br>
order in which the respective ones of the recessed portions 17a, 17b, 17c, and 52 allow<br>
the combustion chamber 2 and the annular gas chamber 6 to communicate with each<br>
other can be adjusted appropriately. Here, as shown in Fig. 9, the portion 45 located<br>
on the cylinder head 13a side in a contiguous portion 40d, which is contiguous to the<br>
inner surface 14 of the recessed portion 52 disposed further away from the cylinder<br>
head 13a in the reciprocating direction Y, may be disposed closer to the cylinder head<br>
13a side than the portions 46 of the contiguous portions 40a and 40c opposing in the<br>
reciprocating direction Y the portions 45 thereof located on the cylinder head 13a side.<br>
Portions of the opening planes 31a, 31c, and 31d of the spaces 30a, 30c, and 30d<br>
respectively defined by the recessed portions 17a, 17b, and 17c may be respectively<br>
positioned on a line 53 extending the circumferential direction X. In addition, for<br>
example, the center portions C1 and C3 of the opening planes 31a and 31c of the<br>
recessed portions 17a and 17c may be positioned on a line 54 passing through the<br>
portion 45 of the contiguous portion 40d and extending in the circumferential direction<br>
X. In the case where the recessed portions 17a, 17c, and 52 are thus disposed, the<br>
combustion gases can be introduced continuously into the annular gas chamber 6 from<br>
the combustion chamber 2 without interruption by means of these recessed portions 17a,<br>
17c, and 52.<br>
In addition, the reciprocating engine 1 of this embodiment may have two gas<br>
passages 15 disposed in the inner surface 14 of the cylinder 13, instead of the three gas<br>
passages 15. Further, as shown in Figs. 10 and 11, the reciprocating engine 1 of this<br>
embodiment may have more than three gas passages (four or five gas passages, etc.) 15.<br>
Thus, in correspondence with the various forms of the reciprocating engine 1, the<br>
number of the gas passages 15 can be set appropriately such that the combustion gases<br>
51 can be introduced thoroughly, extensively, and speedily into the annular gas<br>
chamber 6. Here, in the case where, for instance, four gas passages 15 are provided,<br>
as shown in Fig. 10, an intersection angle 64 between the line 80 and a line 60<br>
connecting the center portion O of the piston 3 and a center portion C4 of an opening<br>
plane 31e of a space 30e defined by a recessed portion 56, and an intersection angle 67<br>
between the line 80 and a line 63 connecting the center portion O and a center portion<br>
C7 of an opening plane 31h of a space 30h defined by a recessed portion 59 opposing<br>
the recessed portion 56 in the axial direction A, are preferably substantially equal<br>
angles. Meanwhile, an intersection angle 65 between the line 80 and a line 61<br>
connecting the center portion O and a center portion C5 of an opening plane 3 If of a<br>
space 30f defined by a recessed portion 57 adjacent to the recessed portion 56 in the<br>
circumferential direction X, and an intersection angle 66 between the line 80 and a line<br>
62 connecting the center portion O and a center portion C6 of an opening plane 31 g of a<br>
space 30g defined by a recessed portion 58 opposing the recessed portion 57 in the axial<br>
direction A and adjacent to the recessed portion 59 in the circumferential direction X,<br>
are preferably substantially equal angles. In such a case, the combustion gases 51 can<br>
be uniformly introduced into and caused to act in the one side and the other side of the<br>
annular gas chamber 6 concerning the axial direction A.<br>
Furthermore, instead of the recessed portions 17a, 17b, and 17c, the<br>
reciprocating engine 1 of this embodiment may have the recessed portions 56, 57, 58,<br>
and 59 whose depths in the direction perpendicular to the reciprocating direction Y are<br>
mutually different, as well as a recessed portion 70 opposing the center portion O of the<br>
piston 3 in the direction Z. Preferably, the recessed portion 70 located closest to the<br>
thrust side 10 is constructed so as to be deeper than the recessed portions 56, 57, 58,<br>
and 59 located on the counter-thrust side 9 relative to the recessed portion 70<br>
concerning the direction Z, and the recessed portions 57 and 58 are constructed so as to<br>
be deeper than the recessed portions 56 and 59. In addition, the reciprocating engine 1<br>
may have the recessed portions 56, 57, 58, and 59 whose curvatures are mutually<br>
different. Preferably, the recessed portion 70 located closest to the thrust side 10 has a<br>
smaller curvature than the recessed portions 56, 57, 58, and 59 located on the<br>
counter-thrust side 9 relative to that recessed portion 70 concerning the direction Z, and<br>
the recessed portions 57 and 58 have smaller curvatures than the recessed portions 56<br>
and 59. Furthermore, the radii or diameters of the opening planes 31e, 31g, 3 If, 31h,<br>
and 31i of the spaces 30e, 30f, 30g, 30h, and 30i respectively defined by the recessed<br>
portions 56, 57, 58, 59, and 70 may be mutually different. Preferably, the opening<br>
plane 31i in the recessed portion 70 located closest to the thrust side 10 has a longer<br>
radius or diameter than the opening planes 31e, 31f, 31g, and 31h, and 31i in the<br>
recessed portions 56,. 57, 58, and 59 located on the counter-thrust side 9 relative to that<br>
recessed portion 70 concerning the direction Z. Meanwhile, the opening planes 31f<br>
and 31g in the recessed portions 57 and 58 have longer radii or diameters than the<br>
opening planes 31e and 31h in the recessed portions 56 and 59. By constructing the<br>
recessed portions 56, 57, 58, 59, and 70 respectively having the above-described depths,<br>
curvatures, and diameters (including radii and diameters), the state of communication<br>
between the combustion chamber 2 and the annular gas chamber 6 as well as the order<br>
of starting or termination of the communication can be adjusted appropriately. As the<br>
recessed portions 56, 57, 58, 59, and 70 are disposed in the inner surface 14 of the<br>
cylinder 13 by being respectively designed particularly in connection with the<br>
above-described curvatures and depths, it is possible to more satisfactorily adjust the<br>
state of communication between the combustion chamber 2 and the annular gas<br>
chamber 6 through the recessed portions 56, 57, 58, 59, and 70.<br>
Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 12, instead of the oil ring 16, the reciprocating<br>
engine 1 of this embodiment may have an oil ring 75 which is disposed on the piston 3<br>
in face-to-face relation to the piston ring 5 with the piston ring 7 disposed therebetween,<br>
and which is inclined with respect to the reciprocating direction Y such that its portion<br>
71 on the thrust side 10 is located further away from the piston ring 5 than its portion 72<br>
opposing the piston pin 21 connecting the piston 3 and the connecting rod 22 and its<br>
portion 73 on the counter-thrust side 9 concerning the reciprocating direction Y. In<br>
such a case, the piston ring 7 may be inclined with respect to the reciprocating direction<br>
Y with an angle equal to the angle of inclination of the oil ring 75. According to the<br>
reciprocating engine 1 having the oil ring 75, the oil ring 75 can be disposed by being<br>
spaced away from the piston ring 5 without interfering with the piston pin 21, and the<br>
piston ring 7 can be disposed by being spaced away from the piston ring 5 particularly<br>
on the thrust side 10 without interfering with the oil ring 75. Here, with the<br>
reciprocating engine 1, even in a case where the piston ring 7 together with the oil ring<br>
75 is inclined greatly with respect to the reciprocating direction Y, the combustion<br>
gases 51 in an amount sufficient to gas-pressure support the piston 3 can be thoroughly<br>
and speedily introduced into and caused to act in the annular gas chamber 6 from the<br>
combustion chamber 2 through the above-described plurality of gas passages 15,<br>
thereby increasing the gas pressure.<br>
In addition, the reciprocating engine 1 of this embodiment may have a piston<br>
pin which is off-centered toward the counter-thrust side 9, instead of the piston pin 21.<br>
It should be noted that, in this embodiment, the plurality of gas passages 15<br>
respectively have the recessed portions 17a, 17b, and 17c which are disposed in the<br>
vicinities of the top dead center such that the communication between the combustion<br>
chamber 2 and the annular gas chamber 6 is temporarily canceled in the case where the<br>
piston 3 is positioned at the top dead center, as shown in Fig. 6. However, instead of<br>
at least one of the recessed portions 17a, 17b, and 17c or in addition thereto, the<br>
plurality of gas passages 15 may have a recessed portion or recessed portions which are<br>
disposed so as to allow the combustion chamber 2 and the annular gas chamber 6 to<br>
communicate also in the case where the piston 3 is positioned at the top dead center.<br>
Furthermore, instead of at least one of the recessed portions 17a, 17b, and 17c or in<br>
addition thereto, the plurality of gas passages 15 may have a recessed portion or<br>
recessed portions which are disposed in the inner surface of the cylinder 13 such that<br>
the line 43 extending in the reciprocating direction Y and the tangential lines 42 to the<br>
respective ones of the contiguous portions 40a, 40b, and 40c contiguous to the inner<br>
surface 14 of the cylinder 13.<br>
In Figs. 13 and 14, another four-cycle gasoline engine 1K serving as the<br>
reciprocating engine of another embodiment is comprised of the piston ring (top ring) 5<br>
adjacent to the top surface 4 of the piston 3 defining the combustion chamber 2; the<br>
piston ring (second ring) 7 which defines the annular gas chamber 6 in cooperation with<br>
the piston ring 5 and which is adjacent to the piston ring 5 such that the<br>
pressure-receiving area of the side surface 8 of the piston 3 in the annular gas chamber<br>
6 becomes greater on a swinging side surface portion 10K, which is located on the<br>
thrust side and opposes a swinging side surface portion 9K located on the counter-thrust<br>
side 9 of the piston 3, than on the swinging side surface portion 9K; the oil ring 16<br>
which is located further away from the piston ring 5 on the swinging side surface<br>
portion 10K side than, on a substantially intermediate portion side between the swinging<br>
side surface portion 9K and the swinging side surface portion 10K; and a recessed<br>
portion 15K serving as a gas passage which is disposed in the inner surface 14 of the<br>
cylinder 13 and at a position for allowing the annular gas chamber 6 to communicate<br>
with the combustion chamber 2 when the piston 3 is positioned in the vicinity of the top<br>
dead center.<br>
Ring grooves, which are disposed in such a manner as to respectively<br>
correspond to the piston rings 5 and 7 and the oil ring 16, are formed in the side surface<br>
8 of the piston 3. The piston rings 5 and 7 and the oil ring 16 are respectively fitted in<br>
the ring grooves.<br>
The connecting rod 22 is rotatably coupled at its small end portion to the piston<br>
3 through a connecting shaft (piston pin) 21. A crankshaft is rotatably coupled to a<br>
large end portion of the connecting rod.<br>
The cylinder 13 has the cylinder bore (space) 25 defined by its inner surface,<br>
and the piston 3 is disposed in the cylinder bore 25 such that the piston 3 is<br>
reciprocatable in the reciprocating direction Y. The cylinder 13 is provided with the<br>
ignition plug 26, an intake valve, and an exhaust valve 27K.<br>
The piston ring 5 is fitted in the ring groove of the piston 3 such that the piston<br>
ring 5 is substantially parallel to the top surface (head end face) 4 of the piston 3<br>
defining the combustion chamber 2.<br>
The piston ring 7 is fitted in the ring groove of the piston 3 by being inclined<br>
with respect to the reciprocating direction Y and the piston ring 5 so as to be located<br>
gradually away from the piston 3 as viewed in the direction from the swinging side<br>
surface portion 9K toward the swinging side surface portion 10K. The distance from<br>
the piston ring 5 to the piston ring 7 on the swinging side surface portion 1 OK side is<br>
longer than the distance from the piston ring 5 to the piston ring 7 on the swinging side<br>
surface portion 9K side.<br>
Abutment portions at respective both ends of the piston rings 5 and 7 are<br>
closely abutted or fitted so that the gases will not leak through the abutment portions at<br>
these both ends.<br>
The annular gas chamber 6 is defined by the side surface 8 of the piston 3, the<br>
inner surface 14 of the cylinder 13, and the piston rings 5 and 7.<br>
A portion 3IK which is substantially intermediate between the swinging side<br>
surface portions 9K and 10K of the oil ring 16 is disposed in such a manner as to be<br>
spaced away from the piston ring 5 within a range in which it does not come into<br>
contact with the coupling shaft 21 in the reciprocating direction Y. A portion 32K<br>
located on the swinging side surface portion 10K side of the oil ring 16 is disposed in<br>
such a manner as to be further away from the piston ring 5 than the portion 31K in the<br>
reciprocating direction Y.<br>
The recessed portion 15K is formed in the inner surface 14 facing the side<br>
surface 8 on the swinging side surface portion 10K side so as to allow the annular gas<br>
chamber 6 to communicate with the combustion chamber 2 in a case where the piston 3<br>
is present at the position of the top dead center and at a position corresponding to<br>
approximately 15 degrees in terms of the crank angle.<br>
A description will be given of the operation of the reciprocating engine 1K of<br>
this embodiment. In the combustion stroke of the air-fuel mixture which is started<br>
after completion of the compression stroke, ignition by the ignition plug 26 is effected<br>
while the piston 3 is positioned in the vicinity of the top dead center, and the<br>
combustion gases within the combustion chamber 2 are introduced into the annular gas<br>
chamber 6 through the recessed portion 15K. The piston 3 then receives the gas<br>
pressure of the combustion gases which heightened to a maximum while the piston 3 is<br>
being positioned in the vicinity of the top dead center after the passage of the top dead<br>
center of the piston 3, so that the piston 3 accelerates toward the bottom dead center.<br>
Here, as a forward moving force is imparted from the forwardly moving piston 3 to the<br>
connecting rod 22 which is tilted with respect to the reciprocating direction Y, a lateral<br>
pressure E1 which is directed toward the thrust side is imparted to the piston 3.<br>
However, a counter lateral pressure E2 directed toward the counter-thrust side is<br>
imparted to the piston 3 by the gas pressure within the annular gas chamber 6, thereby<br>
causing the piston 3 to gas float.<br>
In the reciprocating engine 1K constructed as described above, since the piston<br>
3 is brought to the position where the combustion chamber 2 and the annular gas<br>
chamber 6 are communicated through the recessed portion 15K during the combustion,<br>
the gas pressure which is generated through combustion in the combustion chamber 2 in<br>
the combustion stroke is speedily introduced into the annular gas chamber 6 through the<br>
recessed portion 15K. Upon receiving the biased lateral pressure within the annular<br>
gas chamber 6 on the basis of this introduced gas pressure, the piston 3 floats up (gas<br>
floats) with respect to the inner surface 14, particularly the inner surface 14 on the<br>
swinging side surface portion 10K side, in its reciprocating motion. The piston 3<br>
which is floated up by the gas pressure reciprocates with an extremely low sliding<br>
frictional resistance. In addition, in such reciprocating motion, although the piston 3<br>
tends to be swung (oscillated) about the coupling shaft 21 in D directions, this swinging<br>
motion is prevented by the aforementioned biased lateral pressure of the annular gas<br>
chamber 6. The piston 3 can thus be reciprocated with an extremely low sliding<br>
frictional resistance without causing its side surface 8 on the swinging side surface<br>
portions 9K and 10K side to abut against the inner surface 14 of the cylinder 13,<br>
thereby making it possible to attain an improvement and the like of the fuel<br>
consumption of the reciprocating engine 1K.<br>
According to the reciprocating engine 1K of this embodiment, the<br>
reciprocating engine 1 has the oil ring 16 which is located further away from the piston<br>
ring 5 on the swinging side surface portion 10K side than on a substantially<br>
intermediate portion side between the swinging side surface portion 9K and the<br>
swinging side surface portion 10K. Therefore, the oil ring 16 can be disposed such<br>
that the portion 31K of that oil ring 16 located above the coupling shaft 21 is located<br>
away from the piston ring 5 within a range in which it does not interfere with the<br>
coupling shaft 21, and such that the portion 32K of that oil ring 16 on the thrust side is<br>
located further way from the piston ring 5 than the portion 31K. Hence, the piston<br>
ring 7 can be inclined greatly with respect to the reciprocating direction Y without<br>
interfering with the oil ring 16, such that the aforementioned pressure-receiving area<br>
becomes greater on the swinging side surface portion 10K side than on the swinging<br>
side surface portion 9K side. Thus, the piston 3 can be floated up (gas floated) from<br>
the inner surface 14 of the cylinder 13 by generating desired lateral pressure, thereby<br>
making it possible to substantially reduce the sliding frictional resistance between the<br>
cylinder 13 and the piston rings 5 and 7.<br>
It should be noted that although in the above-described embodiments, the<br>
reciprocating engine is implemented as the four-cycle gasoline engines 1 and 1K, the<br>
present invention is not limited to the same, and operational effects similar to those<br>
described above can be obtained if the present invention is implemented as a diesel<br>
engine, for example.<br>
