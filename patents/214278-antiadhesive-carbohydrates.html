DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention relates to a pharmaceutical or dietetic preparation for reducing<br>
and/or blocking the adhesion of pathogenic substances and organisms to<br>
eucaryontic cells, in particular mammal cells, which contains at least one<br>
antiadhesive carbohydrate having an uronic acid on one of the ends thereof, and<br>
the use of said preparation and the therein contained carbohydrates for the<br>
mentioned purposes.<br>
The adhesion of pathogenic organisms, as well as of cell-damaging substances<br>
to the surface of mammal cells, is the first step and an indispensable prerequisite<br>
for an infection or a damage of the cell. The interaction between the pathogens<br>
and the cells is formed by a ligand-receptor relationship, which is thus an<br>
important virulence or toxicity factor of the pathogens. As pathogens, at least<br>
bacteria, viruses, fungi, monocellular or multicellular parasites, toxins and heavy-<br>
metal cations have thereby to be understood. In this ligand-receptor relationship,<br>
glycostructures play an important role.<br>
One possibility of at least reducing or completely preventing this ligand-receptor<br>
relationship consists in blocking the respective receptors on the cell surface or on<br>
the ligand.<br>
Using specific test systems, it could be shown that various carbohydrate mixtures<br>
reduce or even completely prevent the adhesion of, for example, microorganisms<br>
to the cell surface, cf.: Kunz, C; Rudloff, S. Acta Paediatr. 1993, 82,<br>
903-912. It is thereby assumed that the active carbohydrates have a<br>
considerable analogy to the receptor or ligand structures. In the described<br>
studies, numerous carbohydrates from animal as well as vegetal origin and also<br>
hydrolysis products from vegetal polysaccharides have been used.<br>
The composition and structure of the carbohydrates present in nature and, for<br>
example, of the carbohydrates of human milk, are very complex. The same<br>
applies, however, for the carbohydrates from vegetal origin and hydrolysis<br>
products from vegetal carbohydrates, respectively. Therefrom results that the<br>
antiadhesive action of carbohydrates established for pathogens on mammal cells<br>
have been effected in the most cases with carbohydrate mixtures and not with<br>
purified single structures.<br>
Thus, it is, for example, known that aqueous extracts, as well as juices from<br>
various plant products are active against diseases in the intestinal and urogenital<br>
tract caused by pathogenic germs. Hence, it is described in the document<br>
PCT/EP 94/03006 (WO 95/07084) that by a carrot soup, bladder tea, coconut<br>
milk, etc., prepared according to a determined manner, the adherence of<br>
pathogenic germs to the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tract<br>
is considerably reduced. It is supposed that the pectins present in the plant<br>
products are responsible for this action, which essentially are chains of 1,4-a-<br>
glycosidically bound galacturonides. The actually active galacturonides thereby<br>
are supposed to comply with various criteria, namely a determined degree of<br>
polymerization and methylation.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to show a way how by means of<br>
carbohydrates the adhesion of pathogens can efficiently be reduced or prevented<br>
by an interaction with ligands and/or superficial structures of eucaryontic cells,<br>
and in particular mammal cells.<br>
This task is solved by the teaching of the claims.<br>
The subject matter of the invention therewith is inter alia a pharmaceutical or<br>
dietetic preparation containing at least one antiadhesive carbohydrate having an<br>
uronic acid unit on one of the ends thereof. As is generally known, carbohydrates<br>
have at least two ends, and can even possess three or more ends when they are<br>
branched. According to the invention, straight-chain carbohydrates, and also<br>
branched-chain carbohydrates may thus be used. On one of these ends, the<br>
mentioned uronic acid is present disposing of a terminal COOH group which may<br>
be esterified. Preferred uronic acids or uronic acid units thereby are the following<br>
free or esterified acids: galacturonic acid, glucuronic acid, guluronic acid, iduronic<br>
acid, mannuronic acid, riburonic acid and altruronic acid, the galacturonic acid<br>
and glucuronic acid being particularly preferred.<br>
The inventive preparation contains at least one antiadhesive carbohydrate, and<br>
hence a determined species having an uronic acid unit on one of the ends<br>
thereof. The inventive preparation, however, may also feature several<br>
antiadhesive carbohydrates having a terminal uronic acid unit. Appropriately, the<br>
inventive preparation contains a mixture of several of such antiadhesive<br>
carbohydrates.<br>
As an antiadhesive carbohydrate, such a carbohydrate is understood within the<br>
framework of the present documents, which disposes of a terminal uronic acid<br>
unit, and namely independent of the fact whether said uronic acid unit has a<br>
double bond or not. In other words, the term antiadhesive carbohydrates<br>
designates the sum of the carbohydrates having an uronic acid unit featuring a<br>
double bond, and those carbohydrates which do dispose of an uronic acid unit,<br>
but which have no double bond. An essential idea of the invention consists in that<br>
such antiadhesive carbohydrates are used, which feature a minimum content of<br>
uronic acid units having a double bond.<br>
The antiadhesive carbohydrates may possess a determined degree of<br>
polymerization, which is in general and hence here, as well, abbreviated as DP.<br>
Usually, however, antiadhesive carbohydrates having different DPs are present,<br>
with the antiadhesive carbohydrates having a determined degree of<br>
polymerization or DP could also be composed in various manners. In other<br>
words, the inventive preparation contains at least one determined antiadhesive<br>
carbohydrate species having an uronic acid unit on one of the ends thereof. This<br>
carbohydrate species, of course, has a determined DP. Moreover, several<br>
differently composed antiadhesive carbohydrates may be present having the<br>
same DP. In addition, antiadhesive carbohydrates having a different DP may be<br>
present, whereby one or several antiadhesive carbohydrate species may be<br>
present for each degree of polymerization.<br>
With the definition of the antiadhesive carbohydrates specified above in more<br>
detail, which comprise an uronic acid unit on one end, there is not any statement<br>
made on the nature of the other saccharide units or monomer units of which<br>
these antiadhesive carbohydrates are composed, except that the antiadhesive<br>
carbohydrate only consists of one single unit (degree of polymerization = DP 1),<br>
namely, one uronic acid unit. Insofar as the antiadhesive carbohydrate has a DP<br>
1, it is exclusively composed of one uronic acid unit of this kind. If the<br>
antiadhesive carbohydrate has a DP 2 or higher, then the other saccharide units<br>
linked with the uronic acid unit may be of any desired nature.<br>
10 to 100 % of the present uronic acid units pertaining to the carbohydrates have<br>
to be provided with a double bond. The indication in % thereby indicates the<br>
number of the uronic acid units present in toto having a double bond on one of<br>
the ends of the carbohydrates with such an uronic acid unit referred to the sum of<br>
these uronic acid units having a double bond and the possibly present uronic acid<br>
unit having no such double bond on one end of the antiadhesive carbohydrate or<br>
antiadhesive carbohydrates.<br>
Incidentally, an uronic acid unit on one end of an antiadhesive carbohydrate here<br>
is also referred to as terminal uronic acid unit.<br>
The antiadhesive carbohydrates brought to use according to the invention, which<br>
feature such an uronic acid unit on one end, may feature a non-reducing<br>
saccharide unit or also a reducing saccharide unit on the other end (in the case<br>
of a non-branched chain). Preferably, 10 to 100 % of the antiadhesive<br>
carbohydrates featuring a terminal uronic acid unit, have such a reducing<br>
saccharide unit on the other end (with a straight chain) or on one of the other<br>
ends (in the case of a branched chain). In other words, 10 to 100 % of the<br>
terminal uronic acid units are situated on a non-reducing end. Thus, even all<br>
present terminal uronic acid units may be present on the non-reducing end.<br>
Preferably, 50 to 100 % of the double bonds are situated between the C4 and C5<br>
atom of the terminal uronic acid units. In this case, too, the indication in % refers<br>
to the number of double bonds, independent of the DP of the antiadhesive<br>
carbohydrates and the saccharide units forming these antiadhesive<br>
carbohydrates. The detection of the double bonds, and hence of the terminal<br>
uronic acid units having such a double bond thereby may ensue<br>
spectroscopically at 235 nm using the molar extinction coefficient of<br>
5500 l/mol cm, cf. TP Kravtchenko, I. Arnould, AGJ Voragen &amp; W. Polnik<br>
Carbohydr. Polymer 1992, 19, 237-242.<br>
The determination of the carbohydrates having a reducing end ensues by means<br>
of the iodometry according to the specifications in: Analytical Chemistry of<br>
Carbohydrates, H. Scherz, G. Bonn, Editor Thieme Organic Chemistry<br>
Monograph Series, Stuttgart, New York, Thieme Publishers 1998, page 32.<br>
Carbohydrates having exclusively non-reducing ends may be determined with the<br>
usual analytical methods such as osmometry, mass spectrometry (e.g. MALDI-<br>
MS, ESI-MS), chromatography (e.g. GPC, HPAEC, HPLC), and capillary<br>
electrophoresis, or by a combination of these methods.<br>
The antiadhesive carbohydrates brought to use according to the invention may<br>
also feature, apart from the terminal uronic acid units, a non-reducing end, in<br>
that, for example, a reducing end is subsequently transformed into a non-<br>
reducing end. This may, for example, be achieved by oxidation, reduction or also<br>
by linking the reducing end to other molecules. Among these other molecules<br>
count, for example, proteins, lipids and technical polymers, whereby (neo)glyco-<br>
conjugates are obtained. This subsequent modification of the reducing end has<br>
no effect on the antiadhesive action of the antiadhesive carbohydrates brought to<br>
use according to the invention. These antiadhesive carbohydrates thus may also<br>
be immobilized on known carriers via a "formerly" reducing end, for example, on<br>
a usual carrier.<br>
When 10 to 100 % of the present terminal uronic acid units thus have a double<br>
bond, then this, of course, means also that 0 to 90 % of the present terminal<br>
uronic acid units have no such double bond. Preferably, 10 to 50 % of the<br>
present terminal uronic acid units of the antiadhesive carbohydrate or of the<br>
antiadhesive carbohydrates have such a double bond.<br>
Namely, it has been surprisingly found that in contrast to the teaching of the<br>
initially mentioned WO 95/07084, neither the degree of polymerization nor the<br>
degree of methylation is responsible for a marked antiadhesive function, even<br>
with possibly some of the therein described carbohydrates being allowed to<br>
dispose of such a function. Carbohydrates having a terminal uronic acid unit<br>
exhibiting a double bond, on the contrary, exercise a marked antiadhesive<br>
function. Such antiadhesive carbohydrates and in particular those, the uronic acid<br>
unit of which has the double bond situated between the C4 and C5 atom,<br>
however, are not obtained according to the teaching of the mentioned WO<br>
95/07084, what will be discussed in more detail hereafter.<br>
When according to the invention, it is the question of an antiadhesive<br>
carbohydrate having a given degree of polymerization, then only one single<br>
antiadhesive carbohydrate may be concerned. But several differently structured<br>
antiadhesive carbohydrates may also be concerned, the common features of<br>
which are, for one, the given degree of polymerization and, for another, the<br>
terminal uronic acid unit.<br>
Preferably, the inventive preparation exhibits not only one or several antiadhesive<br>
carbohydrates having a given DP but several antiadhesive carbohydrates of a<br>
different degree of polymerization. The antiadhesive carbohydrates brought to<br>
use thereby preferably possess a degree of polymerization of DP 2 up to DP 40,<br>
and in particular of DP 2 up to DP 10, and of a maximum of DP 100. Preferably,<br>
mixtures of antiadhesive carbohydrates having different chain lengths are<br>
therewith used. In this case, too, only one single or several carbohydrate species<br>
or any desired plurality of antiadhesive carbohydrate species may be concerned,<br>
with an antiadhesive carbohydrate having a determined chain length or a given<br>
degree of polymerization.<br>
The antiadhesive carbohydrates having a terminal uronic acid unit situated<br>
especially on the non-reducing end and exhibiting a double bond, thus dispose of<br>
an increased antiadhesive action. These antiadhesive carbohydrates are also<br>
designated as unsaturated carbohydrates within the framework of the present<br>
documents.<br>
The inventively used antiadhesive carbohydrates, and hence the unsaturated<br>
antiadhesive carbohydrates, as well, may, for example, be obtained in that acidic<br>
carbohydrates and preferably uronic acid-containing carbohydrates are cleaved<br>
by means of enzymes or chemical cleavage, in such a manner that the indicated<br>
contents in uronic acid units having a double bond are obtained. The following<br>
may thereby be used as the preferred starter carbohydrates: pectins, pectates,<br>
alginates, chondroitins, hyaluronic acids, heparins, heparans, bacterial<br>
carbohydrates and other uronic acid-containing carbohydrates. Preferred raw<br>
materials in this case are plants and/or parts of plants (such as carrots, citrus<br>
fruits, beets and apples, cf. C. Rolin, BU Nielsen &amp; PE Glahn in Polysaccharides<br>
ed. S. Dimitriu, Marcel Dekker New York 1998. Also algae, animal tissue and<br>
bacterial products may be used.<br>
When the unsaturated antiadhesive carbohydrates are prepared by chemical<br>
cleavage, then same has to be carried out so that a double bond is introduced via<br>
a ß-elimination, in that, for example, pectins are split in neutral or weak alkaline<br>
conditions, cf. MJH Keijbets &amp; W. Pilnik Carbohydr. Res. 1974, 33, 359-362.<br>
The enzymatic cleavage is in particular carried out by means of lyases (such as<br>
pectin lyases or pectate lyases) or lyase-containing enzyme preparations.<br>
In the case of the chemical cleavage, one works in neutral to alkaline conditions,<br>
so as to thereby obtain the desired content in double bonds. By the appropriate<br>
selection of the other parameters such as temperature, pH, and buffer<br>
concentration, the degree of esterification of the carboxyl group and/or hydroxyl<br>
group may also be influenced. At higher degrees of esterification of the starter<br>
compounds used (e.g. pectins), the inventively used antiadhesive carbohydrates<br>
and hence the unsaturated antiadhesive carbohydrates, as well, may likewise be<br>
obtained with a cleavage carried out in a weak acid range.<br>
The antiadhesive action of the unsaturated antiadhesive carbohydrates is also<br>
influenced by the presence of methyl esters of the carboxyl group, as well as of<br>
acetyl esters, e.g. on the C-2 and/or C-3 atom of the uronic acids. This applies in<br>
particular with the galacturonic acids of the pectins. The degree of methylation or<br>
acetylation preferably is 20 to 75 %, and in particular 20 to 50 %.<br>
As already expounded, the double bond of the uronic acid units situated in<br>
particular on the non-reducing end is of special importance in the mixture of<br>
antiadhesive carbohydrates preferably brought to use according to the invention.<br>
The other saccharide units linked with this uronic acid unit having a double bond<br>
or even no such double bond, may be exclusively acidic carbohydrate units,<br>
exclusively neutral carbohydrate units, or a mixture of acid and neutral<br>
carbohydrate units. Thus namely, the neutral carbohydrate units, as well,<br>
influence the antiadhesive action of the unsaturated antiadhesive carbohydrates.<br>
Thereby, essentially rhamnose, arabinose, galactose, xylose, glucose, fucose<br>
and apiose are concerned, which in turn may be linked with feroyl residues and<br>
phenolic substances. This applies in particular to pectins. The portion of neutral<br>
carbohydrate units thereby preferably amounts to a maximum of 50%, and in<br>
particular to 0 up to 30 %.<br>
The antiadhesive action of the antiadhesive carbohydrate brought to use or of the<br>
mixture of antiadhesive carbohydrates is not dependent on the concentration in a<br>
final product, rather on the supplied amount. Thus, the inventive preparation may<br>
exclusively consist of an antiadhesive carbohydrate or of a mixture of<br>
antiadhesive carbohydrates. For this purpose, the preparation is, for example,<br>
formulated as a tablet or as food supplement. Of course, usual pharmacologically<br>
tolerated carriers, diluents and/or adjuvants may be present in the case of a<br>
pharmaceutical preparation. These antiadhesive carbohydrates may also be<br>
incorporated in any desired food or pharmaceutical preparation containing further<br>
ingredients. In the case of food, fats, proteins, minerals, trace elements, vitamins<br>
and other materials suited for the production of food may be concerned. In<br>
addition, it is possible to use the antiadhesive carbohydrates inventively brought<br>
to use in conjunction with other carbohydrates of any desired nature.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the other carbohydrates concerned are<br>
prebiotic carbohydrate mixtures according to the teaching of WO 00/08948 with<br>
the international file number PCT/EP99/05878, and hence a prebiotic<br>
carbohydrate mixture of two different, essentially soluble carbohydrate<br>
components A and B are concerned, which remain undigested in the<br>
gastrointestinal tract and reach the large intestine non-absorbed, with the<br>
carbohydrate component A being composed of at least one monosaccharide or<br>
of at least one oligosaccharaide (disaccharide up to hexasaccharide) or of a<br>
mixture of two or several of these saccharides, with the carbohydrate component<br>
B being composed of a polysaccharide (heptasaccharide onwards) or of a<br>
mixture of two or several polysaccharides, with the carbohydrate component A =<br>
5 up to 95 wt-%, and the carbohydrate component B = 5 up to 95 wt-% of the<br>
sum of the carbohydrate components A + B (= 100 wt-%), and with at least<br>
80 wt-% of the carbohydrates/saccharides of the carbohydrate component A and<br>
B being prebiotically active. For the purposes of the present invention, however,<br>
only such carbohydrates, which do not represent antiadhesive uronic acid-<br>
containing carbohydrates, may form the carbohydrate component A and the<br>
carbohydrate component B. Therewith, the components A and B are not ascribed<br>
any antiadhesive carbohydrates. These carbohydrates, which form the<br>
carbohydrate component A and the carbohydrate component B, are designated<br>
as prebiotic carbohydrates in the following for ease of simplification, although<br>
only a part of these carbohydrates actually is prebiotically active.<br>
At least 80 wt-% of the carbohydrates called prebiotic or of the saccharides of the<br>
sum of the carbohydrate components A and B hence are prebiotically active.<br>
Preferably, at least 80 wt-% of the carbohydrates called prebiotic pertaining to the<br>
carbohydrate component A, and also at least 80 wt-% of those pertaining to the<br>
carbohydrate component B are prebiotically active. In other terms, in each case<br>
preferably at least 80 wt-% of the carbohydrates or saccharides called prebiotic<br>
of the carbohydrate components A and B have to reach the large intestine<br>
undigested (and hence non-absorbable in the small intestine). In other words, the<br>
carbohydrates or saccharides of the carbohydrate components A and B are not<br>
absorbed and digested in the gastrointestinal tract, neither in the stomach nor in<br>
the small intestine, but reach as such the large intestine.<br>
As soluble carbohydrates of the carbohydrate component A and B, those have to<br>
be understood, which form in the physical sense a homogenous solution in water<br>
in a concentration of at least 1 g/l at room temperature (e.g. according to<br>
Roempps Chemie Lexikon).<br>
The portion of the non-prebiotically active carbohydrates or saccharides in the<br>
carbohydrate components A and B therewith amounts to a maximum of 20 wt-%.<br>
With these carbohydrates or saccharides, those are concerned which, it is true,<br>
are soluble but can be excreted undigested. These carbohydrates can cause a<br>
physical action in that they increase the volume of the faeces or also exercise a<br>
water-binding action.<br>
Preferably, the prebiotic carbohydrates/saccharides, which constitute the<br>
carbohydrate component A have another structure than the prebiotic<br>
carbohydrates/saccharides, which constitute the carbohydrate component B.<br>
Further preferred are at least 80 wt-% of the prebiotic carbohydrates/saccharides<br>
of the carbohydrate component A and B, namely those which favor lactic acid<br>
bacteria and/or are bifidogenous. The weight percentage of the carbohydrate<br>
component A is in this case preferably larger than the weight percentage of the<br>
carbohydrate component B. The carbohydrate component A preferably<br>
constitutes 95 to 60 wt-%, and in particular about 90 wt-%, while the<br>
carbohydrate component B constitutes preferably 5 to 40 wt-%, and in particular<br>
about 10 wt-%, with A + B = 100 wt-%. The prebiotic carbohydrates/saccharides<br>
of the carbohydrate components A and B in particular do not exhibit any glucose<br>
units in an a1-4 bond and/or an a1-6 bond. The prebiotic<br>
carbohydrates/saccharides of the carbohydrate component B are in this case<br>
preferably built up by a maximum of up to 100 monosaccharide units.<br>
Further preferred, at least 60 wt-%, and in particular 80 to 100 wt-% of the<br>
prebiotic carbohydrates/saccharides of the carbohydrate component A belong to<br>
the group of the galactooligosaccharides, and at least 60 wt-%, and in particular<br>
80 to 100 wt-% of the prebiotic carbohydrates/saccharides of the carbohydrate<br>
component B belong to the group of the fructopolysaccharides.<br>
If such a prebiotic carbohydrate mixture is present in the inventive preparations,<br>
then the weight ratio of the antiadhesive carbohydrate(s) to the prebiotic<br>
carbohydrate mixture is preferably 1 : 99 up to 99 : 1, and in particular 1 : 10 up<br>
to 10 : 1, and furthermore in particular about 1:1.<br>
Moreover, apart from the antiadhesive carbohydrates and apart from the possibly<br>
present prebiotic carbohydrate mixtures, further usual carbohydrates of any<br>
desired kind may also be present in the inventive preparations. Insoluble<br>
carbohydrates, soluble as well as digestible carbohydrates, usual carbohydrates<br>
primarily serving a nutritive purpose (e.g. starch, maltodextrin, lactose and<br>
saccharose) or a mixture of one or several of these carbohydrates may be<br>
concerned in this case. The antiadhesive carbohydrates constitute in these cases<br>
preferably 0.1 to 30 wt-%, and in particular 1 to 10 wt-%.<br>
It is achieved with the antiadhesive oligosaccharides that pathogenous<br>
substances do not bond to mammal cells, or already bonded pathogens are<br>
detached. Through the addition of prebiotic oligosaccharides, it is achieved that<br>
the dysfunction of the intestinal flora often arising in conjunction with pathogens,<br>
is eliminated. Moreover, pathogens in other places outside of the gastrointestinal<br>
tract, such as, for example, the urogenital tract, the respiratory tract, the blood<br>
system and the skin, are combated by the systemic action of a balanced<br>
intestinal flora.<br>
Since the adhesion of pathogens is a prerequisite for their infectivity or toxicity to<br>
all cells of the mammal organism, the inventively used antiadhesive carbohydrate<br>
may not only be used for preventing or reducing infections or damages in the<br>
gastrointestinal tract, rather may be used in all cells.<br>
The subject matter of the invention therefore is also the use of the inventive<br>
preparations and the therein contained antiadhesive carbohydrates for preventing<br>
or reducing the adhesion of pathogens to eucaryontic cells, and especially<br>
mammal cells. Preferably, these carbohydrates are used for the treatment of<br>
infections of the gastrointestinal tract, the blood system, the respiratory<br>
passages, the urogenital tract, the nasopharyngeal meatus, and for the treatment<br>
of damages by toxins or heavy-metal cations of the cells of the gastrointestinal<br>
tract, the blood system, the respiratory passages, the urogenital tract, as well as<br>
the nasopharyngeal meatus. The subject matter of the invention hence is also the<br>
use of the applied antiadhesive carbohydrates for preparing a dietetic or<br>
pharmaceutical preparation for the mentioned treatment purposes.<br>
Incidentally, the use is not restricted to enterally administrable food or<br>
pharmaceutical preparations. On the contrary, the inventively used antiadhesive<br>
carbohydrates may also be used as active agent in non-enterally administrable<br>
pharmaceutical preparations. With the inventive preparations, hence, such non-<br>
enterally administrable pharmaceutical products may be concerned.<br>
The amount supplied of the inventively used antiadhesive carbohydrates, and<br>
therewith the sum of carbohydrates exhibiting a terminal uronic acid unit without<br>
a double bond, and of carbohydrates likewise exhibiting a terminal uronic acid<br>
unit but having a double bond (unsaturated carbohydrates), with 10 to 100 % of<br>
the present terminal uronic acid units exhibiting such a double bond, is at least 8<br>
mg/kg per body weight and day, preferably 8 up to 20 mg/kg per body weight and<br>
day, and in particular about 10 mg/kg per body weight and day. This indication<br>
refers in particular to the preferred unsaturated antiadhesive carbohydrates<br>
alone.<br>
When it is the question of ranges within the framework of the present documents,<br>
be it, for example, % ranges or mg ranges, then all intermediate values and<br>
hence all values lying in between the end values, and all of the narrower ranges<br>
covered by these ranges are also disclosed and claimed with these range<br>
indications. The indication 8 to 20 mg/kg hence covers all intermediate values,<br>
and in particular integer values, e.g. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19<br>
mg/kg. The range indication 10 to 100 % hence only constitutes an abbreviated<br>
indication for all imaginable intermediate values, and in particular for the integer<br>
values 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,<br>
30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50,<br>
51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71,<br>
72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92,<br>
93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98 and 99 %. This applies, for example, for the % indications<br>
for the percentage of uronic acid units having a double bond. Also all imaginable<br>
narrower ranges are likewise covered and disclosed by this indication. The<br>
analog applies to all range indication referring to wt-%, DP or other units.<br>
In the following examples, preferred inventive preparations are described. The<br>
examples 1 through 7 concern the preparation of antiadhesive carbohydrates,<br>
with at least 10 % of the present uronic acid units exhibiting a double bond. The<br>
products obtained in this case represent preparations exclusively built up from<br>
antiadhesive carbohydrates. The examples 8 and 13 describe mixtures of<br>
antiadhesive carbohydrates and a prebiotic carbohydrate mixture in various<br>
weight ratios.<br>
Example 1 (enzymatic cleavage)<br>
10 g of GENU pectin USP/100 (Hercules Co., Copenhagen, DK) are dissolved in<br>
1 I of 50 mM NaOAc buffer (pH 5.0). 10 ml of pectin-lyase solution (Sigma,<br>
Deisenhofen) are added to this solution. The conversion ensues at 40°C for 24 h.<br>
The reaction is stopped by heating to 100°C for 10 min. The enzyme and non-<br>
converted pectin are removed through filtration with a 50 kDa membrane. The<br>
filtrate is subsequently freeze-dried.<br>
Example 2 (chemical cleavage)<br>
10 g of GENU pectin USP/100 (Hercules Co., Copenhagen, DK) are dissolved in<br>
1 I of 0.2 M of NH3 carbonate buffer (pH 6.8) and heated for 8 h at 80°C. The<br>
obtained oligogalacturonides are precipitated as metal salt (e.g. barium salt),<br>
filtered, washed, dried, converted into the free acid by means of a DOWEX-50<br>
H+-ion exchanger, and freeze-dried.<br>
Example 3 (enzymatic cleavage)<br>
10 g of Laboron pectin X-77 A (CCA. Klimmeck, Bad Zwischenahn) are<br>
dissolved in 1 I of 50 mM of sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5). The digestion<br>
process is carried out with 1 ml pectin-lyase solution (Gist-Brocades Co., Seclin,<br>
France) at 45°C for 24 h. The reaction is stopped by heating to 95°C for 5 min.<br>
The enzyme and non-converted pectin are removed through gel filtration with<br>
BioGel P2 or TosoHaas HW 40 S. The fraction of the oligosaccharides is<br>
subsequently freeze-dried.<br>
Example 4 (enzymatic cleavage)<br>
10 g of Gruenband pectin (Obipektin, Bischofszell, Switzerland) are dissolved in<br>
1 I of 50 mM sodium aceate buffer ( pH = 4.5). 2 ml Pectinex 3 XL (Novo Nordisk<br>
Co., Dittingen, Switzerland) are added. The solution is heated to 50°C for 24 h.<br>
The stopping of the reaction ensues by heating to 95°C for 5 min. The formed<br>
oligogalacturonides are precipitated with ethanol, washed and dried.<br>
Example 5 (chemical cleavage)<br>
10 g of Gruenband pectin (Obipektin, Bischofszell, Switzerland) are dissolved in<br>
1 I of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer ( pH 6.8) and heated to 90°C for 1 h. The<br>
released oligogalacturonides are precipitated with ethanol, washed and dried.<br>
Example 6 (chemical cleavage)<br>
10 g of GENU pectin USP/100 (Hercules Co., Copenhagen, DK) are dissolved in<br>
1 I of 0.1 M of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and heated to 95°C for 1 h.<br>
Long-chain polymers are precipitated with hydrochloric acid at pH 2 and<br>
withdrawn by centrifugation. The supernatant including the oligogalacturonides is<br>
lyophilized.<br>
Example 7 (enzymatic cleavage)<br>
10 g of alginate are dissolved in 1 I of 50 mM NaAc buffer (pH 4.6). 10 ml of<br>
alginate-lyase solution are added to this solution. The cleavage ensues at 40°C<br>
for 24 h. The reaction is stopped by heating to 100°C for 10 min. The enzyme<br>
and non-converted alginate are removed through filtration with a 50 kDa<br>
membrane. The filtrate subsequently is freeze-dried.<br>
Examples 8 through 13<br>
For preparing a preparation that contains, apart from antiadhesive carbohydrates,<br>
also prebiotic carbohydrates, one proceeds as follows.<br>
10 g of oligogalacturonides, which were prepared either by enzymatic cleavage<br>
according to any one of the examples 1, 3, 4 and/or 7, or which were prepared by<br>
chemical cleavage according to any one of the examples 2, 5 and/or 6, before<br>
the drying process, are admixed to and mixed with 10 g of a prebiotic<br>
carbohydrate mixture of 9 parts galacto-oligosaccharides (e.g. Elixor, Borculo<br>
Co., and Oligomate, Yakult Co.) and 1 part high-molecular inulin (e.g. Raftiline<br>
HP, Orafti Co.or Frutafit TEX or EXL, Sensus Co.or Fibruline LC HAT, Cosucra<br>
Co.) according to the quantity ratios indicated in the following table.<br>
instead of the above-mentioned prebiotic carbohydrate mixture of galacto-<br>
oligosaccharides and inulin, carbohydrate mixtures may also be used that are<br>
composed of the following components:<br>
a-galacto-oligosaccharides and inulin, ß-galactooligosaccharides and<br>
galactomannans, fructo-oligosaccharides and galactomannans, fructo-<br>
oligosaccharides and arabinogalactans, ß-galactooligosaccharides and<br>
