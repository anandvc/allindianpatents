Title:       polymerisation initiator system<br>
The invention relates to a polymerisation initiator system and to a method of preparing a polymer.<br>
Recently, a number of relatively new and very effective water soluble organic initiators for the polymerisation of monomers in a largely aqueous medium have been made available to the producers of polymers. These initiators, such as water soluble azo-initiators, are usually expensive.<br>
The initiators are usually available as crystalline water-soluble powders. Aqueous solutions of the initiators are not as stable as the dry powder and stock solutions held for any length of time have to be stored under cold conditions. As an alternative it has been proposed to add the initiator to the polymerisation system as a dry powder.<br>
The dry powders, as such, are toxic and irritant to the skin, eyes and/or the lungs. Adequate care has always to be taken to observe stringent safety precautions during all stages of handling the product, during transport to the warehouse and to the plant, such that at no stage personnel is exposed to dust that is inherently formed from such crystalline initiators. Besides the health hazards, there is of course a cumulative loss of expensive material due to the handling of the powder at different stages of transfer of the initiator.<br>
As an alternative, it has been proposed to apply the initiator in the form of grauuj.es. However, according to EP-A-0 668 098 there is a large risk and a fear of deterioration of quality during granulation by means of a normal granulation method, because of the deleterious decomposition properties of many initiators, such as azo-compounds. Further, normal granulation methods lead to granules wherein formation of dust cannot be sufficiently eliminated.<br>
In order to address these problems, EP-A-0 668 098 proposes a special process, requiring dedicated equipment for the production of granules of a specific average particle size of 0.01-30 mm, preferably 1.8-5 mm. This<br><br>
approach leaves a number of aspects in the production of water soluble low volume specialty initiators with inherent problems related to safety of multiple handling from the production of the initiator until its actual transfer to the reactor wherein the polymer is produced. Further this approach does not actually address the economics of production of the final form of the product, as the need for dedicated equipment and special process conditions, has a cost-increasing effect on the initiator.<br>
There remains a need for providing alternatives to known initiator delivery systems and/or methods of polymerisation comprising the addition of an initiator delivery system. It is an object of the'present invention to provide such an alternative.<br>
It is in particular an object of the invention to address one or more of the above identified problems.<br>
More in particular, the present invention aims to provide a relatively simple and safe method and/or initiator delivery system to enable the producer of the initiator to transfer the initiator from its actual unit of production to the end-user, without undue human exposure of the initiator at various stages of transport until transfer into the polymerisation reaction system.<br>
It has been found that it is possible to suitably add an initiator held in a specific container to a polymerisation system, such as a largely aqueous polymerisation system, to start a polymerisation reaction*<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a polymerisation initiator system, comprising an initiator - in particular an azo-compound - in a container, which container and initiator are both soluble in a polymerisation system, such as a liquid mixture comprising the compound or compounds to be polymerised and optionally other components used in the polymerisation such as a catalyst, an emulsifier and the like. The initiatior is usually a solid compound, preferably in the form of a powder or granulate.<br><br>
More in particular the present invention relates to a polymerisation initiator system, comprising a water-soluble container and a water-soluble azo-initiator contained in, the container.<br>
The container and the initiator are chosen such that they dissolve in the polymerisation system. It has been found that the polymerisation can suitably be carried out in the presence of the material of which the container is made.<br>
The invention provides a convenient system for delivering a water-soluble organic polymerisation initiator and/or catalyst to a variety of polymerisation processes, in which monomers of various types may be used to produce a usually water-soluble polymer, preferably by aqueous emulsion polymerisation or aqueous solution polymerisation.<br>
The invention is suitable to provide a range of polymers for use in a large number of diverse industries, including consumer industries, such as processing of paper, textile, adhesives, water treatment, food products etc,<br>
A system according to the invention has been found very suitable as a substitute for known polymerisation initiator systems for delivering an initiator in a method wherein the initiator is directly added to the polymerisation system in a measured amount, such as a polymerisation method for the production, of water soluble or emulsifyable polymers, in particular such a method wherein it is desired to have an extremely low amount of residual monomer in the final polymer product.<br>
The system is particularly suitable for use in an aqueous emulsion polymerisation. Herein, it has been found that the system dissolves sufficiently fast and the polymerisation is adequately initiated by the initiator. It has further been found of a system of the invention that the material of which the container is made mainly remains in the aqueous bulk phase. It has been found that typically only trace amounts, if noticeable at all, of the material of which the container is made, migra.te into the monomer phase (inside the micelles wherein, polymerisation takes place) and end up in the final product*<br><br>
Thus, it has been found possible to prepare a polymer without unacceptable levels of the water-soluble material of which the container is made.<br>
It has been found that a system according to the present invention can be introduced conveniently into a polymerisation system by a regular chemical plant operator without any specific training, with a low risk of exposure to the (hazardous) initiator, during application to the polymerisation<br>
system.<br>
Dust formation can be avoided essentially completely or at least to a large extent in comparison to application of the initiator without the container.<br>
The initiator can conveniently be applied very accurately without substantial loss of initiator due to dust formation or spoiling during application to the polymerisation system.<br>
The term water-soluble as defined herein is a substance (such as the azo-initiator or the container) which is soluble in the polymerisation system under reaction conditions existing in the system for which the polymerisation initiation system is intended, in particular in an aqueous polymerisation system.

No special attention is required to ensure that the particles are highly spherical to avoid dust exposure to the environment. In this respect, it is a further advantage of the<br><br>
invention that the geometric properties and resistance to break-down of the form in which the initiator is originally present in the container, are not particularly important to successfully avoid exposure to dust.<br>
For practical reasons, the initiator is preferably provided into the container in the form the initiator has after having been manufactured (and dried), typically having the form of a crystalline material, comprising micro-crystal particles and macro-crystal particles.<br>
The container comprising the initiator may be sealed in any way, a seal, a lid or by heat-sealing.

Very good results have been achieved with a water-soluble wrapping, such as tape. This has been found to be any easy and satisfactory way of sealing the container, in particular a bag. Further, the wrapping may be applied without any further treatment giving rise to physico-chemical changes in the material, such as an undesirable formation of insoluble particles in the wrapping material or the container material. Very suitable is a seal made of a water-soluble polyvinylalcohol.<br>
The container with initiator may be packed alone or together with one or more other containers in an outer container, such as a polymer bag, e.g. a polyethylene bag or the like.<br>
