HIGH TENSILE STRENGTH HOT-DIPPED STEEL SHEET<br>
AND METHOD OF PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a high tensile strength hot-dipped steel sheet<br>
usable for a vehicle body of an automobile or the like formed by subjecting a<br>
surface of a high tensile strength steel sheet to a hot dipping of zinc (including an<br>
alloy thereof, the same is applied hereinafter), aluminum, zinc-aluminum alloy,<br>
zinc-aluminum-magnesium alloy or the like, and a method of producing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Recently, the application of high tensile strength hot-dipped steel<br>
sheets formed by subjecting a surface of a steel sheet to galvanizing or the like is<br>
increasing as a steel sheet for an automobile from viewpoints of safety, weight<br>
reduction and low fuel consumption of the automobile and hence global<br>
environment protection.<br>
In order to obtain such a high tensile strength hot-dipped steel sheet,<br>
it is important to use a steel sheet having an excellent plating property and<br>
providing desired strength and workability (press formability or the like) after<br>
being passed through a hot dipping bath or further subjected to an alloying<br>
treatment as an original sheet.<br>
In general, Si, Mn and so on are added to the steel sheet for increasing<br>
the strength of the steel sheet. However, it is known that when the steel sheet<br>
added with such elements is subjected to a plating in, for example, a continuous<br>
galvanizing line (CGL), the plating property is degraded because oxides of Si,<br>
Mn and so on are formed on the surface of the steel sheet at an annealing step<br>
before the plating.<br>
This phenomenon is caused due to the fact that when the annealing is<br>
carried out in a reducing atmosphere before the plating, since such an atmosphere<br>
is reducing for Fe but is oxidat ve for Si, Mn and the like in steel, Si, Mn and the<br>
like are selectively oxidized on the surface of the steel sheet to form oxides.<br>
Since such surface oxides considerably lower a wettability of fused<br>
zinc to the steel sheet, the plating property is degraded in the galvanized steel<br>
sheet using a high tensile strength steel sheet as an original plating sheet, and<br>
particularly, when the contents of Si, Mn and the like are high, there is a problem<br>
that the plating is not locally conducted or so-called non-plated portion is formed.<br>
As means for improving the degradation of the plating property in<br>
such a high tensile strength steel sheet, for example, JP-A-55-122865 and JP-A-<br>
9-13147 propose a method of forcedly oxidizing the steel sheet under a high<br>
oxygen partial pressure and the n reducing it prior to the heating during the<br>
plating. And also, a method of conducting a preliminary plating before the hot<br>
dipping is proposed in JP-A-58-104163.<br>
However, the former method has problems that the control of the<br>
surface oxide through forcible oxidation is not sufficiently carried out and the<br>
stable plating property is not necessarily guaranteed in accordance with compo-<br>
nents in steel and plating conditions. On the other hand, the latter method has a<br>
problem that the production cost rises because an extra process should be added.<br>
Besides, JP-A-6-287684 discloses a high strength steel sheet having<br>
an improved plating property by optimizing addition amounts of P, Si and Mn.<br>
And also, JP-A-7-70723 and JP-A-8-85858 propose a method wherein a<br>
recrystallization annealing is previously carried out before the plating to form a<br>
surface oxide and then a galvanizing is carried out after such an oxide is removed<br>
by pickling.<br>
By these method could be prevented the occurrence of the non-plated<br>
portion in a substantial quantity of high-strength steels.<br>
Even in these methods, however, there is still a problem that the<br>
occurrence of the non-plated portion can not be completely prevented as to a type<br>
of steel having a higher Si content.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to advantageously solve the afore-<br>
mentioned problems and to p opose a high tensile strength hot-dipped steel sheet<br>
capable of effectively preventing the occurrence of non-plated portions even if a<br>
high tensile strength steel sheet having higher contents of Si and Mn is used as an<br>
original plating sheet as well as a production method usable therefor.<br>
The inventors have made various studies in order to solve the above<br>
problems and obtained a knowledge that<br>
a) as components, Nb and Cu or Ni, Mn are compositively added while<br>
regulating Si content to a given range,<br>
b) an internal oxide layer is formed just beneath a surface of a steel sheet<br>
through an annealing in a continuous annealing line (CAL)(hereinafter referred to<br>
as a recrystallization annealing) and a simultaneously formed surface oxide is<br>
removed by pickling after the annealing,<br>
c) in a subsequent heating before a plating in a continuous galvanizing line<br>
(CGL)(hereinafter referred to as a heating before plating), the formation of<br>
oxides of Si, Mn and the lib; is considerably decreased on the surface of the steel<br>
sheet as the above internal oxide layer acts as a diffusion barrier,<br>
and hence a big improvement of the plating property can be attained.<br>
The invention is accomplished based on the above knowledge.<br>

sheet in a range satisfying Cnnot more than 0.25 mass% and Si(mass%) &gt; 3 x<br>
Cr(mass%).<br>
The invention mainly lies in a feature that Nb and Cu or Ni, Mn are<br>
compositively added while app: opriating Si content, and an internal oxide layer<br>
is formed just beneath a surface of a steel sheet in the recrystallization annealing,<br>
and surface oxides simultaneously formed on the surface of the steel sheet are<br>
removed by pickling and then the steel sheet is subjected to the heating before<br>
plating and further to a hot dipping.<br>
The reason why the imposition range and the production conditions<br>
of the recrystallization annealing, heating before plating and the like according to<br>
the invention are limited to the above ranges will be described below.<br>
In the invention, the range of C content is divided into two regions,<br>
whereby there can be obtained a high tensile strength hot-dipped steel sheet<br>
having a tensile strength of 400-600 MPa grade and an excellent ductility and a<br>
high tensile strength hot-dipped steel sheet wherein the ductility is somewhat<br>
lowered and the tensile strength is as very high as 500-1200 MPa grade.<br>
At first, the invention is described with respect to the high tensile<br>
strength hot-dipped steel sheet having a tensile strength of 400-600 MPa grade.<br>
In this high tensile strength hot-dipped steel sheet, it is required to limit C<br>
content and each content of Si, Mn, Ti and B to the following ranges.<br>
C: not more than 0.010 mass%<br>
It is desired to decrease C content for improving elongation and r-<br>
value of the steel sheet. Particularly, when the C content exceeds 0.010 mass%,<br>
even if proper contents of Ti and Nb are added, the effect of improving properties<br>
(particularly press formability) through these elements is not obtained, so that the<br>
C content is limited to not more than 0.010 mass%. Moreover, when the content<br>
is less than 0.001 mass%, it is difficult to form an internal oxide layer during the<br>
recrystallization annealing, so that the C content is favorable to be not less than<br>
0.001 mass%.<br>
Si: not less than 0.25 mass%, not more than 1.2 mass%<br>
Si is an element effective for strengthening steel. Heretofore, it was<br>
required to decrease Si content is far as possible so as not to form Si oxide on the<br>
surface of the steel sheet in the heating before plating. In the invention,<br>
however, even if Si is added in an amount of not less than 0.25 mass%, Nb and<br>
Cu or Ni, Mo are compositively added to form an internal oxide layer of Si and<br>
Mn just beneath the surface of the steel sheet in the recrystallization annealing,<br>
which controls the formation of oxides of Si and Mn on the surface of the steel<br>
sheet in the subsequent heating before plating, so that the steels according to the<br>
invention indicate a good plating property. Moreover, this mechanism is<br>
considered due to the fact that the internal oxide layer acts as a diffusion barrier<br>
against the movement of Si and Mn in steel to the surface of the steel sheet.<br>
The above effect is never obtained unless Si should be added in an<br>
amount of not less than 0.25 mass%. On the other hand, when the Si content<br>
exceeds 1.2 mass%, SiO2 is formed on the surface of the steel sheet in the re-<br>
crystallization annealing and such a surface oxide can not be completely removed<br>
at a subsequent pickling step and a part thereof is retained to create a non-plated<br>
portion. Therefore, the Si cor tent is limited to a range of 0.25-1.2 mass%.<br>
1.5 x Si(mass%) 
When the Si content is an amount satisfying a relationship of 1.5 x<br>
Si(mass%) &gt; Mn(mass%) in view of Mn content mentioned later, SiO2 is also<br>
formed on the surface of the steel sheet in the recrystallization annealing and<br>
such a surface oxide can not be completely removed at the subsequent pickling<br>
step and hence the non-plated portion is created.<br>
Therefore, it is important that Si is added in a range of 0.25-<br>
1.2 mass% and a range satisfying a relationship of 1.5 xSi(mass%) 
respectively.<br>
Mn: not less than 0.50 mass %, not more than 3.0 mass%<br>
Mn contributes to enhance the strength but also has an effect of<br>
controlling the formation of SiO2 on the surface of the steel sheet in the<br>
recrystallization annealing to form a composite oxide of Si and Mn capable of<br>
easily removing by pickling. However, when the Mn content is less than<br>
0.50 mass%, the above effect is poor, while when it exceeds 3.0 mass%, Mn<br>
oxide is formed on the surface of the steel sheet in the heating before plating to<br>
easily create a non-plated portion and also steel is too hardened to hardly conduct<br>
cold rolling. Therefore, the Mn content is limited to a range of 0.50-3.0 mass%.<br>
Ti: not more than 0.030 mass%<br>
Ti is added, if necessary, because it forms a carbide, a nitride or the<br>
like to effectively contribute 10 the improvement of the workability of steel.<br>
However, when Ti is excessvely added, surface oxides of Si and Mn formed in<br>
the recrystallization annealing become larger and hence it is difficult to remove<br>
such oxides by pickling. Therefore, the Ti content is limited to not more than<br>
0.030 mass%. Moreover, T is not necessarily added.<br>
B: not more than 0.005 mass%<br>
B is an element effective for improving a resistance to secondary<br>
work brittleness. However, when B is added in an amount exceeding<br>
0.005 mass%, the effect is not expected over a certain level but is rather degraded<br>
in accordance with the annealing conditions. And also, when B is excessively<br>
added, hot ductility is lowered Therefore, B is added in an amount of<br>
0.005 mass% as an upper limit. Moreover, the B content is not particularly<br>
critical with respect to the lower limit, but is sufficient to be added in accordance<br>
with an improving degree of the required resistance to secondary work brittleness<br>
and is desirable to be usually added in an amount of not less than 0.0010 mass%.<br>
Next, the invention is described with respect to the high tensile<br>
strength hot-dipped steel shee: having a tensile strength of 500-1200 MPa grade.<br>
In this high tensile strength h
content and each content of Si and Mn to the following ranges.<br>
C: not less than 0.03 mass%, not more than 0.20 mass%<br>
C is an important, basic component in steel and is an element<br>
contributing not only to improve the strength through bainite phase or martensite<br>
phase produced at a low temperature but also to precipitate carbides of Nb, Ti, V<br>
and the like to increase the s'rength. When the C content is less than 0.03 mass%,<br>
not only the above precipitat is but also bainite phase and martensite phase are<br>
hardly produced, while wher it exceeds 0.20 mass%, a spot weldability is<br>
degraded, so that the addition range is rendered into 0.03-0.20 mass%.<br>
Moreover, a preferable C content is 0.05-0.15 mass%.<br>
Si: not less than 0.5 mass%, not more than 1.5 mass%<br>
Si is an element hat the C content solid-soluted in a phase is<br>
decreased to improve workabilities such as elongation and the like. Heretofore,<br>
it was required to decrease Si content as far as possible so as not to form Si oxide<br>
on the surface of the steel sheet in the heating before plating. In the invention,<br>
however, even if Si is addec in an amount of not less than 0.5 mass%, Nb and Cu<br>
or Ni, Mo are compositively added to form an internal oxide layer of Si and Mn<br>
just beneath the surface of he steel sheet in the recrystallization annealing, which<br>
controls the formation of oxides of S:L and Mn on the surface of the steel sheet in<br>
the subsequent heating before plating, so that the steels according to the invention<br>
indicate a good plating properly. Moreover, this mechanism is considered due<br>
to the fact that the internal oxdie layer acts as a diffusion barrier against the<br>
movement of Si and Mn in steel to the surface of the steel sheet.<br>
The above effect is never obtained unless Si should be added in an<br>
amount of not less than 0.5 mass%. On the other hand, when the C content is<br>
0.03-0.20 mass%, if the Si content exceeds 1.5 mass%, SiO2 is formed on the<br>
surface of the steel sheet in the recrystallization annealing and such a surface<br>
oxide can not be completely removed at a subsequent pickling step and a part<br>
thereof is retained to create a non-plated portion. Therefore, the Si content is<br>
limited to a range of 0.5-1.5 mass%.<br>
Moreover, in order to control the occurrence of the non-plated portion<br>
even in the steel sheet of 500-1200 MPa grade, the Si content is required to<br>
control to a range satisfying 1 5 x Si(mass%) 
content mentioned later likewise the aforementioned case of the steel sheet of<br>
400-600 MPa grade.<br>
Mn: not less than 1.2 mass%, not more than 3.5 mass%<br>
Mn has an effect c f enriching γ-phase to promote martensite trans-<br>
formation. And also, Mn has an effect that the formation of SiO2 on the surface<br>
of the steel sheet in the recrys tallizatior annealing is controlled to form a<br>
composite oxide of Si and Mn capable of easily removing by pickling. However,<br>
when the Mn content is less than 1.2 mass%, the effect is not obtained, while<br>
when it exceeds 3.5 mass%, the spot weldability and plating property are<br>
considerably damaged. Therefore, the Mn content is limited to a range of 1.2-<br>
3.5 mass%, preferably 1.4-3.0 mass%.<br>
Although the above is described with respect to the reasons on the<br>
limited ranges of the respecti /e components inherent to the steel sheets having a<br>
tensile strength of 400-600 MPa grade and the steel sheets having a tensile<br>
strength of 500-1200 MPa grade, the following elements are required to be added<br>
as a component common to both kinds of the steel sheets.<br>
Nb: not less than 0.005 mass%, not more than 0.2 mass%<br>
Nb contributes to improve the plating property by making small a<br>
crystal grain of the steel sheet produced in the recrystallization annealing to<br>
promote the formation of the internal oxide layer of Si and Mn just beneath the<br>
surface of the steel sheet. The effect is not obtained unless Nb should be added<br>
in an amount of not less than 0.005 mass%. On the other hand, when the Nb<br>
content exceeds 0.2 mass%, steel is hardened and hence the hot rolling or the<br>
cold rolling is difficult but also the recrystallization annealing is difficult because<br>
the recrystallizing temperature is raised and a surface defect is caused.<br>
Therefore, the Nb content is limited to a range of 0.005-0.2 mass%.<br>
Not less than 0.03 mass% but not more than 1.5 mass% of one of or more in total<br>
of Cu: less than 0.5 mass%, Ni: less than 1.0 mass% and Mo: less than<br>
1.0 mass%<br>
Cu, Ni and Mo promote the formation of the internal oxide layer of Si<br>
and Mn just beneath the surface of the steel sheet in the recrystallization<br>
annealing, which controls the formation of oxides of Si and Mn on the surface of<br>
the steel sheet in the heating before plating, so that the steels according to the<br>
invention indicate a good plating property. This effect is not obtained unless<br>
one or more of these elements should be added in an amount in total of not less<br>
than 0.03 mass%. On the other hand, when the content in total of these element<br>
exceeds 1.5 mass%, or if the Cu content is not less than 0.5 mass%, the Ni<br>
content is not less than 1.0 mass% and the Mo content is not less than 1.0 mass%,<br>
the surface properties of the hot rolled sheet are degraded. Therefore, these<br>
elements are added in amounts of Cu: less than 0.5 mass%, Ni: less than<br>
1.0mass%, Mo: less than 1.0 mass% and total amount of not less than<br>
0.03 mass% but not more than 1.5 mass%.<br>
Al: not more than 0.10 mass%<br>
Al serves as a deox idizing agent at a steel-making stage but also is<br>
useful as an element for fixation of N causing aging degradation as A1N.<br>
However, when the Al content exceeds 0.10 mass%, not only the rise of the<br>
production cost but also the degradation of the surface properties are caused, so<br>
that Al is added in an amount of not more than 0.10 mass%. Preferably, it is not<br>
more than 0.050 mass%. Moreover, when the Al content is less than 0.005 mass%,<br>
it is difficult to obtain the sufficient deoxidizing effect, so that the lower limit of<br>
Al content is favorable to be 0 005 mass%.<br>
P: not more than 0.100 mass%<br>
By adding P is increased the strength. However, when the P content<br>
exceeds 0.100 mass%, the segregation in the solidification becomes very<br>
conspicuous and hence the increase of the strength is saturated and the<br>
degradation of the workability is caused and further the resistance to secondary<br>
work brittleness is largely degraded and the steel is not substantially durable in<br>
use. Therefore, the P conten is limited to not more than 0.100 mass%. In case<br>
of an alloying galvanization, the P content is favorable to be not more than<br>
0.060 mass% because it brings about the delay of the alloying. However, when<br>
the P content is rendered into ess than 0.001 mass%, the cost becomes too much,<br>
so that it is good to be not less than 0.001 mass%.<br>
S: not more than 0.010 mass %<br>
S causes a hot tearing in the hot rolling and induces a breakage of a<br>
nugget in a spot welded portion, so that it is desirable to decrease the S content as<br>
far as possible. And also, S causes an alloying unevenness in the alloying<br>
treatment after the galvanization, so that it is also desirable to decrease as far as<br>
possible from this viewpoint. Further, the decrease of the S content contributes<br>
to the improvement of the workability through the decrease of S precipitates in<br>
steel and the increase of Ti content effective for fixing C. Therefore, the S<br>
content is limited to not more han 0.010 mass%. More preferably, it is not<br>
more than 0.005 mass%.<br>
N: not more than 0.010 mass %<br>
N is desirable to decrease as far as possible for ensuring properties<br>
such as ductility, r-value and the like. Particularly, when the N content is not<br>
more than 0.010 mass%, a satisfactory effect is obtained, so that the upper limit<br>
is 0.010 mass%. Preferably,: t is not more than 0.0050 mass%. Nevertheless,<br>
the control of the N content to less than 0.0005 mass% brings about the rise of<br>
the cost, so that the lower limit is favorable to be 0.0005 mass%.<br>
Although the inven ion is described with respect to the essential<br>
components, when the C content is not less than 0.03 mass% but not more than<br>
0.20 mass%, the following elements may be further added properly.<br>
Ti and/or V: not more than 0.5 mass% under a condition satisfying Ti(mass%) 
5 x C(mass%)<br>
Ti and V are elements forming carbides to render the steel into a<br>
higher strength. However, when these elements are added in an amount<br>
exceeding 0.5 mass%, a disadvantage is brought in view of the cost and also fine<br>
precipitates become too large to obstruct recovery-recrystallization after the cold<br>
rolling and degrade the ductility (elongation). Therefore, even when these<br>
elements are used alone or in a combination, they are added in an amount of not<br>
more than 0.5 mass%. More preferably, the content is 0.005-0.20 mass%.<br>
However, when Ti is added in a range of Ti(mass%) &gt;5x C(mass%),<br>
the Ti content not forming the c arbide increases, which is a cause of degrading<br>
the plating property, so that Ti i; required to be added in a range satisfying<br>
Ti(mass%) 
Cr: not more than 0.25 mass% under a condition satisfying Si(mass%) &gt; 3 x<br>
Cr(mass%)<br>
Cr is an element effective for obtaining a composite structure of<br>
ferrite + martensite likewise Mn, but when the Cr content exceeds 0.25 mass% or<br>
is Si(mass%) 
sheet in the heating before plating to form a non-plated portion, so that the Cr<br>
content is limited to not more than 0.25 mass% under a condition satisfying<br>
Si(mass%) &gt; 3 x Cr(mass%). More preferably, it is not more than 0.20 mass%.<br>
Moreover, the reasor why the C content according to the invention is<br>
"C: not more than 0.010 mass% ' or "C: not less than 0.03 mass% but not more<br>
than 0.20 mass" but excludes a range of "C: more than 0.010 mass% but less than<br>
0.03 mass%" is due to the fact that when the C content is within the above<br>
excluded range, there is not obtained a product having a particularly excellent<br>
property with respect to the strength or workability.<br>
Then, the invention is described with respect to reasons why the<br>
recrystallization annealing conditions and the heating conditions before plating<br>
are limited to the above ranges.<br>
Moreover, in the production method of the hot-dipped steel sheets<br>
according to the invention, steps up to the recrystallization annealing, i.e. hot<br>
rolling step and cold rolling step are not particularly restricted, and these steps<br>
may be conducted according to usual manner.<br>
Recrystallization annealing<br>
The recrystallization annealing is carried out by heating to a<br>
recrystallizing temperature (usually using CAL) for releasing strain introduced in<br>
the cold rolling to provide mechanical properties and workability required for the<br>
steel sheet and forming the internal oxide layer of Si and Mn just beneath the<br>
surface of the steel sheet.<br>
Because, when such an internal oxide layer is existent, the formation<br>
of oxides of Si and Mn is not caused on the surface of the steel sheet at the<br>
subsequent heating before plating and the occurrence of the non-plated portion is<br>
controlled.<br>
When the recrystal ization annealing is carried out below 750°C, the<br>
formation of the internal oxide layer is insufficient and the good plating property<br>
is not expected, so that it is necessary to conduct the recrystallization annealing<br>
above 750°C.<br>
And also, the recrystallization annealing is necessary to be carried out<br>
in a reducing atmosphere having a dew point of not higher than 0°C but not<br>
lower than -45°C. Because, when the dew point is higher than 0°C, the oxide is<br>
mainly Fe oxide and the internal oxide layer of Si and Mn is hardly formed,<br>
while when the dew point is lower than -45°C, oxygen quantity is lacking and the<br>
internal oxide layer of Si and Mn is hardly formed. As the reducing atmosphere,<br>
nitrogen gas, argon gas, hydrogen gas and carbon monoxide gas may be used<br>
alone or in an admixture of two or more gases.<br>
Moreover, a temperature history of the recrystallization annealing is<br>
preferable to be a pattern that the temperature is kept at 800-900°C for<br>
0-120 seconds and then coded at a rate of about l-100°C/s.<br>
Removal of surface oxide by pickling<br>
The pickling is carried out for removing the oxides of Si and Mn<br>
formed on the surface of the steel sheet in the reducing atmosphere by the<br>
recrystallization annealing. As a pickling solution, it is favorable to use<br>
3-30 mass% hydrochloric acid. And also, the pickling time is favorable to be<br>
about 3-60 seconds.<br>
Heating before plating<br>
The heating before plating is carried out after the oxides of Si and Mn<br>
are removed from the surface of the steel sheet by pickling. In the heating<br>
before plating, it is preferable to usually use CGL. And also, the heating before<br>
plating is carried out in a reducing atmosphere having a dew point of not higher<br>
than -20°C at a temperature of not lower than 650°C but not higher than 850°C.<br>
Because, when the dew point of the atmosphere is higher than -20°C,<br>
a thick Fe oxide is formed on the surface of the steel sheet to bring about the<br>
degradation of the plating adhesion. Furthermore, when the annealing<br>
temperature is lower than 650°C, the surface of the steel sheet is not activated<br>
and the reactivity between molten metal and the steel sheet is not necessarily<br>
sufficient, while when it exceed 850°C, surface oxides of Si and Mn are again<br>
formed on the surface of the steel sheet to form non-plated portions. As to the<br>
atmosphere, the reducing atmosphere is not necessarily maintained over the<br>
whole step, and there may be taken a system that a stage of heating the steel<br>
sheet to 400-650°C is rendered into an oxidizing atmosphere and only the<br>
temperature range exceeding the above is rendered into the reducing atmosphere.<br>
Further, as the reducing atmosphere, nitrogen gas, argon gas, hydrogen gas and<br>
carbon monoxide gas may be used alone or in an admixture of two or more gases.<br>
Moreover, a temperature history of the heating before plating is pre-<br>
ferable to be a pattern that the temperature is kept at 700-800°C for 0-180 seconds<br>
and then cooled at a rate of about l-100°C/s.<br>
In the heating before plating, it is not required to control mechanical<br>
properties, and it is enough to heat an original plating sheet to a required temper-<br>
ature prior to a hot dipping. However, it need hardly be said that the control of<br>
the mechanical properties may be conducted by the heating before plating.<br>
Hot dipping<br>
In the invention, a hot dipping is carried out on the way of dropping<br>
temperature from the above heating before plating. The method of this hot<br>
dipping is not particularly limited, but may be conducted according to the<br>
conventionally well-known methods.<br>
For example, in case of a galvanization, hot dipping is carried out by<br>
immersing the steel sheet heated before plating in a zinc hot dipping bath having<br>
a bath temperature of about 463-490°C. In this case, a sheet temperature<br>
inserting into the bath is favorable to be about 460-500°C.<br>
The steel sheet immersed in the zinc hot dipping bath is taken up from<br>
the bath and thereafter subjected to a gas wiping treatment to adjust a coating<br>
weight to thereby obtain a galvanized steel sheet.<br>
Further, the galvanized steel sheet may be subjected to a subsequent<br>
hot alloying treatment to obtain an alloyed galvanized steel sheet.<br>
Moreover, there are an aluminum hot dipping, a zinc-aluminum hot<br>
dipping, a zinc-aluminum-magnesium hot dipping and the like as the other hot<br>
dipping treatment, which may be carried out according to the conventionally<br>
well-known methods.<br>
And also, the coati ng weight in the hot dipping is favorable to be<br>
about 20-100 g/m per one-side surface.<br>

Dated this 7th day of May,<br>

This invention relates to a method for producing a high tensile strength<br>
hot dip plated steel sheet, which comprises providing a steel sheet having<br>
a Si content controlled within a specific range and comprising Nb and<br>
one or more Cu, Ni and Mo, subjecting a rolled sheet to a<br>
recrystallization annealing to thereby form an inner oxide layer close<br>
under the surface of the steel plate, washing the surface with an acid to<br>
remove the oxides having been formed also on the surface, heating the<br>
resultant steel sheet prior to plating, and then subjecting the sheet to a<br>
hot dip plating. The inner oxide layer formed during annealing acts as a<br>
barrier against diffusion of Si, Mn and the like during the heat treatment<br>
prior to plating, which result in marked reduction of the formation of<br>
oxides of Si, Mn and the like. Accordingly, the method can be used for<br>
producing a high tensile strength hot dip plated steel sheet which<br>
exhibits markedly excellent plating characteristics.</td>
