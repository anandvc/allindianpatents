				<td>A PROCESS FOR THE START-UP OF AN EPOXIDATION PROCESS,<br>
A PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ETHYLENE OXIDE, A 1,2-DIOL, A 1,2-<br>
DIOL ETHER, A 1,2-CARBONATE, OR AN ALKANOLAMINE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a process for the start-up of an ethylene epoxidation<br>
process which process employs a silver-based highly selective epoxidation catalyst. The<br>
invention also relates to a process for the production of ethylene oxide, a 1,2-diol, a 1,2-<br>
diol ether, a 1,2-carbonate, or an alkanolamine, which process includes the start-up method<br>
of this invention.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The catalytic epoxidation of olefins over silver-based catalysts, yielding the<br>
corresponding olefin oxide, has been known for a long time. Conventional silver-based<br>
catalysts have provided the olefin oxides with notoriously low selectivity. For example,<br>
when using conventional catalysts in the epoxidation of ethylene, the selectivity towards<br>
ethylene oxide, expressed as a fraction of the ethylene converted, does not reach values<br>
above the 6/7 or 85.7 mole-% limit. Therefore, this limit has long been considered to be<br>
the theoretically maximal selectivity of this reaction, based on the stoichiometry of the<br>
reaction equation<br>
7 C2H4 + 6 0 2 =&gt; 6 C2H4O + 2 C02 + 2 H20,<br>
cf. Kirk-Othmer's Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd ed., Vol. 9, 1980, p. 445.<br>
The selectivity determines to a large extent the economical attractiveness of an<br>
epoxidation process. For example, an improvement in the selectivity of the epoxidation<br>
process can reduce the operating costs of a large-scale ethylene oxide plant by using less<br>
olefin to produce the same amount of olefin oxide or increase revenue by producing more<br>
olefin oxide from the same amount of olefin.<br>
The olefin oxide produced by the epoxidation process may be reacted with water to<br>
form a 1,2-diol, with carbon dioxide to form a 1,2-carbonate, with an alcohol to form a 1,2-<br>
diol ether, or with an amine to form an alkanolamine. Thus, 1,2-diols, 1,2-carbonates, 1,2-<br>
diol ethers, and alkanolamines may be produced in a multi-step process initially<br>
comprising olefin epoxidation and then the conversion of the formed olefin oxide with<br>
water, carbon dioxide, an alcohol, or an amine. Any improvement in the epoxidation<br>
process can also lead to an improved process for the production of a 1,2-diol, a 1,2-diol<br>
ether or an alkanolamine.<br>
Modern silver-based epoxidation catalysts are highly selective towards olefin oxide<br>
production. When using the modern catalysts in the epoxidation of ethylene the selectivity<br>
towards ethylene oxide can reach values above the 6/7 or 85.7 mole-% limit referred to.<br>
An example of such highly selective catalysts is a catalyst comprising silver and a rhenium<br>
promoter, cf. for example US-A-4761394 and US-A-4766105.<br>
A reaction modifier, for example an organic halide, may be added to the feed in an<br>
epoxidation process for increasing the selectivity of a highly selective catalyst (cf. for<br>
example EP-A-352850, US-A-4761394 and US-A-4766105, which are herein incorporated<br>
by reference). The reaction modifier suppresses the undesirable oxidation of olefin or<br>
olefin oxide to carbon dioxide and water, relative to the desired formation of olefin oxide,<br>
by a so-far unexplained mechanism. EP-A-352850 teaches that there is an optimum in the<br>
selectivity as a function of the quantity of organic halide in the feed, at a constant oxygen<br>
conversion level and given set of reaction conditions.<br>
US-B2-7102022 relates to the start-up of an epoxidation process wherein a highly<br>
selective catalyst is employed. In this document, there is disclosed an improved start-up<br>
procedure wherein the highly selective catalyst is subjected to a heat treatment wherein the<br>
catalyst is contacted with a feed comprising oxygen at a temperature above the normal<br>
operating temperature of the highly selective catalyst (i.e., above 260 °C).<br>
US-A1-2004/0049061 relates to a method of improving the selectivity of a highly<br>
selective catalyst having a low silver density. In this document, there is disclosed a method<br>
wherein the highly selective catalyst is subjected to a heat treatment which comprises<br>
contacting the catalyst with a feed comprising oxygen at a temperature above the normal<br>
operating temperature of the highly selective catalyst (i.e., above 250 °C).<br>
US-A-4874879 relates to the start-up of an epoxidation process employing a highly<br>
selective catalyst. In this document, there is disclosed an improved start-up procedure<br>
wherein the highly selective catalyst is first contacted with a feed containing an organic<br>
chloride moderator and ethylene, and optionally a ballast gas, at a temperature below the<br>
normal operating temperature of the catalyst.<br>
EP-B1-1532125 relates to the start-up of an epoxidation process wherein a highly<br>
selective catalyst is employed. In this document, there is disclosed an improved start-up<br>
procedure wherein the highly selective catalyst is first subjected to a pre-soak phase in the<br>
presence of a feed containing an organic halide and is then subjected to a stripping phase in<br>
the presence of a feed which is free of the organic halide or may comprise the organic<br>
2<br>
halide in a low quantity. The stripping phase is taught to continue for a period of more<br>
than 16 hours up to 200 hours.<br>
It goes without saying that there is an economical incentive to shorten the start-up<br>
period and make the catalyst operate at a high selectivity with a minimum delay.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In accordance with this invention, the start-up of an epoxidation process using a<br>
highly selective catalyst can be improved by utilizing the start-up process according to the<br>
present invention. The start-up process according to the present invention can reduce the<br>
duration of time of the start-up process. Further, within a few hours, the catalyst is able to<br>
produce ethylene oxide at or near the selectivity experienced after the catalyst has "linedout"<br>
under normal operating conditions after the start-up process. Because the selectivity<br>
of the catalyst quickly increases, there is additional production of ethylene oxide. Further,<br>
during the start-up process, there is no longer a need to operate at a catalyst temperature<br>
above the catalyst temperature used during normal ethylene oxide production, which may<br>
result in an improvement in the lifetime of the catalyst.<br>
Although the present epoxidation process may be carried out in many ways, it is<br>
preferred to carry it out as a gas phase process, i.e. a process in which the feed is contacted<br>
in the gas phase with the catalyst which is present as a solid material, typically in a packed<br>
bed. Generally the process is carried out as a continuous process. The reactor is typically<br>
equipped with heat exchange facilities to heat or cool the catalyst. As used herein, the feed<br>
is considered to be the composition which is contacted with the catalyst. As used herein,<br>
the catalyst temperature or the temperature of the catalyst bed is deemed to be the weight<br>
average temperature of the catalyst particles.<br>
When new catalysts as well as aged catalysts which, due to a plant shut-down, have<br>
been subjected to a prolonged shut-in period are utilized in the epoxidation process, it may<br>
be useful in some instances to pre-treat these catalysts prior to carrying out the start-up<br>
process by passing a sweeping gas over the catalyst at an elevated temperature. The<br>
sweeping gas is typically an inert gas, for example nitrogen or argon, or mixtures<br>
comprising nitrogen and/or argon. The elevated temperature converts a significant portion<br>
of organic nitrogen compounds which may have been used in the manufacture of the<br>
catalyst to nitrogen containing gases which are swept up in the gas stream and removed<br>
from the catalyst. In addition, any moisture may be removed from the catalyst. Typically,<br>
when the catalyst is loaded into the reactor, by utilizing the coolant heater, the temperature<br>
3<br>
of the catalyst is brought up to 200 to 250 °C, preferably from 210 to 230 °C, and the gas<br>
flow is passed over the catalyst. Further details on this pre-treatment may be found in USA-<br>
4874879, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The catalyst is subjected to a start-up process which involves an initial step of<br>
contacting the catalyst with a feed comprising ethylene, oxygen, and an organic chloride.<br>
For the sake of clarity only, this step of the process will be indicated hereinafter by the<br>
term "initial start-up phase". During the initial start-up phase, the catalyst is able to<br>
produce ethylene oxide at or near the selectivity experienced after the catalyst has "linedout"<br>
under normal initial operating conditions after the start-up process. In particular,<br>
during the initial start-up phase, the selectivity may be within 3 mole-%, more in particular<br>
within 2 mole-%, most in particular within 1 mole-% of the optimum selectivity<br>
performance under normal initial operating conditions. Suitably, the selectivity may reach<br>
and be maintained at more than 86.5 mole-%, in particular at least 87 mole-%, more in<br>
particular at least 87.5 mole-% during the initial start-up phase. Since the selectivity of the<br>
catalyst quickly increases, there is advantageously additional production of ethylene oxide.<br>
In the initial start-up phase, the catalyst is contacted with organic chloride for a<br>
period of time until an increase of at least 1 x 10"5 mole-% of vinyl chloride (calculated as<br>
the moles of vinyl chloride relative to the total gas mixture) is detected in the reactor outlet<br>
or the recycle gas loop. Without wishing to be bound by theory, when using organic<br>
chlorides other than vinyl chloride, it is believed that the vinyl chloride detected in the<br>
outlet or recycle loop is generated by the reaction of surface absorbed chloride on the silver<br>
present in the catalyst with a hydrocarbon present in the feed. Preferably, the catalyst is<br>
contacted with organic chloride for a period of time until an increase of at least 2 x 10"5<br>
mole-% of vinyl chloride, in particular at most 1x10^ mole-%, more in particular at most<br>
7.5 x 10"5 mole-%, most in particular at most 5 x 10"5 mole-% (calculated as the moles of<br>
vinyl chloride relative to the total gas mixture) is detected in the reactor outlet or the<br>
recycle gas loop. The quantity of organic chloride contacted with the catalyst may be in<br>
the range of from 1 to 12 millimolar (mmolar) equivalent of chloride per kilogram of<br>
catalyst. The mmolar equivalent of chloride is determined by multiplying the mmoles of<br>
the organic chloride by the number of chloride atoms present in the organic chloride<br>
molecule, for example 1 mmole of ethylene dichloride provides 2 mmolar equivalent of<br>
chloride. The organic chloride may be fed to the catalyst bed for a period of time ranging<br>
from 1 to 15 hours, preferably 2 to 10 hours, more preferably from 2.5 to 8 hours.<br>
4<br>
Suitably, the quantity of the organic chloride contacted with the catalyst may be at most 6<br>
mmolar equivalent/kg catalyst, in particular at most 5.5 mmolar equivalent/kg catalyst,<br>
more in particular at most 5 mmolar equivalent/kg catalyst. The quantity of the organic<br>
chloride in the feed during the initial start-up phase may be at least 1.5 x 10^* mole-%, in<br>
particular at least 2 x 10"4 mole-%, calculated as moles of chloride, relative to the total<br>
feed. The quantity of the organic chloride during the initial start-up phase may be at most<br>
0.1 mole-%, preferably at most 0.01 mole-%, more preferably at most 0.001 mole-%,<br>
calculated as moles of chloride, relative to the total feed. Preferably, the initial start-up<br>
feed may comprise the organic chloride in a quantity above the optimum quantity used<br>
during the initial period of normal ethylene oxide production<br>
The feed during the initial start-up phase may also contain additional reaction<br>
modifiers which are not organic halides such as nitrate- or nitrite-forming compounds, as<br>
described herein.<br>
The feed during the initial start-up phase also contains ethylene. Ethylene may be<br>
present in the initial start-up feed in a quantity of at least 10 mole-%, preferably at least 15<br>
mole-%, more preferably at least 20 mole-%, relative to the total feed. Ethylene may be<br>
present in the initial start-up feed in a quantity of at most 50 mole-%, preferably at most 45<br>
mole-%, more preferably at most 40 mole-%, relative to the total feed. Preferably,<br>
ethylene may be present in the initial start-up feed in the same or substantially the same<br>
quantity as utilized during normal ethylene oxide production. This provides an additional<br>
advantage in that ethylene concentration does not have to be adjusted between the initial<br>
start-up phase and normal ethylene oxide production post start-up making the process more<br>
efficient.<br>
The feed during the initial start-up phase also contains oxygen. The oxygen may be<br>
present in the initial start-up feed in a quantity of at least 1 mole-%, preferably at least 2<br>
mole-%, more preferably at least 2.5 mole-%, relative to the total feed. The oxygen may<br>
be present in the initial start-up feed in a quantity of at most 15 mole-%, preferably at most<br>
10 mole-%, more preferably at most 5 mole-%, relative to the total feed. It may be<br>
advantageous to apply a lower oxygen quantity in the initial start-up feed, compared with<br>
the feed composition in later stages of the process during normal ethylene oxide production<br>
since a lower oxygen quantity in the feed will reduce the oxygen conversion level so that,<br>
advantageously, hot spots in the catalyst are better avoided and the process will be more<br>
easily controllable.<br>
5<br>
The feed during the initial start-up phase may also contain carbon dioxide. The<br>
carbon dioxide may be present in the initial start-up feed in a quantity of at most 5 mole-%,<br>
preferably at most 4 mole-%, relative to the total feed.<br>
In an embodiment, the initial start-up phase also contains less than 2 mole-%,<br>
preferably less than 1.5 mole percent, more preferably less than 1.2 mole percent, most<br>
preferably less than 1 mole percent, in particular at most 0.75 mole percent carbon dioxide,<br>
relative to the total feed. In the normal practice of the present invention, the quantity of<br>
carbon dioxide present in the reactor feed is at least 0.1 mole percent, or at least 0.2 mole<br>
percent, or at least 0.3 mole percent, relative to the total feed. Suitably, the carbon dioxide<br>
may be present in the initial start-up feed in the same or substantially the same quantity as<br>
utilized during normal ethylene oxide production.<br>
The balance of the feed during the initial start-up phase may also contain an inert<br>
and/or saturated hydrocarbon. The inert and saturated hydrocarbons are described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
During the initial start-up phase, the catalyst temperature preferably may be at<br>
substantially the same temperature as the normal initial catalyst operating temperature after<br>
the epoxidation process has "lined-out" under normal operating conditions after the startup<br>
process. The term "substantially the same temperature" as used herein is meant to<br>
include catalyst temperatures within +/-5 °C of the normal initial catalyst operating<br>
temperature after the epoxidation process has "lined-out" under normal operating<br>
conditions after the start-up process. Preferably, the catalyst temperature is less than 250<br>
°C, preferably at most 245 °C. The catalyst temperature may be at least 200 °C, preferably<br>
at least 220 °C, more preferably at least 230 °C. The reactor inlet pressure may be at most<br>
4000 kPa absolute, preferably at most 3500 kPa absolute, more preferably at most 2500<br>
kPa absolute. The reactor inlet pressure is at least 500 kPa absolute. The Gas Hourly<br>
Space Velocity or "GHSV", defined hereinafter, may be in the range of from 500 to 10000<br>
Nl/(l.h).<br>
During the initial start-up phase, the catalyst may first be contacted with a feed<br>
comprising ethylene and optionally a saturated hydrocarbon, in particular ethylene and<br>
optionally methane. The organic chloride may then be added to the feed. The oxygen may<br>
be added to the feed simultaneously with or shortly after the first addition of the organic<br>
chloride to the feed. Within a few minutes of the addition of oxygen, the epoxidation<br>
reaction can initiate. Carbon dioxide and additional feed components may be added at any<br>
6<br>
time, preferably simultaneously with or shortly after the first addition of oxygen to the<br>
initial start-up feed. As discussed above, during the initial start-up phase, the catalyst is<br>
able to produce ethylene oxide at or near the selectivity experienced after the catalyst has<br>
"lined-out" under normal initial operating conditions after the start-up process. During the<br>
initial start-up phase, the catalyst is operated under conditions such that ethylene oxide is<br>
produced at a level that is from 45 to 75 % of the targeted production level during normal<br>
ethylene oxide production, in particular from 50 to 70 %, same basis.<br>
Optionally, after the initial start-up phase, the catalyst may be contacted with a feed<br>
comprising a reduced quantity of the organic chloride relative to the initial start-up feed.<br>
For the sake of clarity only, this step of the process will be indicated hereinafter by the<br>
term "intermediate start-up phase". Preferably, the intermediate start-up feed may<br>
comprise the organic chloride in a quantity below the optimized quantity used during the<br>
initial period of normal ethylene oxide production. For a discussion relating to the<br>
optimum quantity of organic chloride see EP-A-352850, US-A-4761394 and US-A-<br>
4766105, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The quantity of organic chloride in the intermediate start-up feed during the<br>
intermediate start-up phase may be at most 80 % of the quantity in the initial start-up feed,<br>
preferably at most 75 %, more preferably at most 70 % of the quantity of organic chloride<br>
in the initial start-up feed. The quantity of organic chloride in the intermediate start-up<br>
feed during the intermediate start-up phase may be at least 45 % of the quantity in the<br>
initial start-up feed, preferably at least 50 %, more preferably at least 55 % of the quantity<br>
of organic chloride in the initial start-up feed. The quantity of the organic chloride in the<br>
intermediate start-up feed during the intermediate start-up phase may be more than 1x10^<br>
mole-%, in particular at least 1.2 x 10"4 mole-%, more in particular at least 1.4 x 10^ mole-<br>
%, calculated as moles of chloride, relative to the total feed.<br>
The additional feed components during the intermediate start-up phase may include<br>
the components described herein for use in the feed during the initial start-up phase.<br>
Preferably, only the quantity of the organic chloride may be decreased and the other<br>
components in the feed remain substantially the same as in the initial start-up feed.<br>
During the intermediate start-up phase, the catalyst temperature preferably may be<br>
at substantially the same temperature as the normal initial catalyst operating temperature<br>
after the epoxidation process has "lined-out" under normal operating conditions after the<br>
start-up process. Preferably, the catalyst temperature may be less than 250 °C, preferably<br>
7<br>
at most 245 °C. The catalyst temperature may be at least 200 °C, preferably at least 220<br>
°C, more preferably at least 230 °C. The reactor inlet pressure may be at most 4000 kPa<br>
absolute, preferably at most 3500 kPa absolute, more preferably at most 2500 kPa absolute.<br>
The reactor inlet pressure is at least 500 kPa absolute. The Gas Hourly Space Velocity or<br>
"GHSV", defined hereinafter, may be in the range of from 500 to 10000 Nl/(l.h) when a<br>
gas phase process involving a packed catalyst bed is utilized. The duration of the<br>
intermediate start-up phase may be up to 72 hours, in particular from 1 to 36 hours, more in<br>
particular from 2 to 24 hours, for example from 3 to 10 hours. During the intermediate<br>
start-up phase, the catalyst may be operated under conditions such that ethylene oxide is<br>
produced at a level that is from 90 to 100 % of the targeted production level during normal<br>
ethylene oxide production, in particular from 95 to 100 %, same basis.<br>
After the initial start-up phase or optionally after the intermediate start-up phase,<br>
the quantity of organic chloride in the feed is adjusted to a value which is practical for the<br>
production of ethylene oxide at substantially optimum selectivity, in particular adjusted to<br>
a quantity that is within 25 % of the optimum quantity of organic chloride that produces the<br>
optimum selectivity under normal initial ethylene oxide production conditions, more in<br>
particular within 10 % of the optimum quantity, and most in particular adjusted to the<br>
optimum quantity of organic chloride that produces the optimum selectivity under normal<br>
initial ethylene oxide production conditions. For the sake of clarity only, this phase of the<br>
epoxidation process, i.e., the phase of the start-up process in which the organic chloride is<br>
adjusted to obtain an optimal level of selectivity for normal initial ethylene oxide<br>
production, will be indicated herein by the term "start-up adjustment phase".<br>
If the start-up process does not include an intermediate start-up phase, the<br>
conditions may be changed during the adjustment phase such that the catalyst is operated<br>
under conditions such that ethylene oxide is produced at a level that is from 90 to 100 % of<br>
the targeted production level during normal ethylene oxide production, in particular from<br>
95 to 100 %, same basis.<br>
If the start-up process includes an intermediate start-up phase, the quantity of<br>
organic chloride is increased. The increase in the quantity of organic chloride in the feed<br>
may be at least 2 x 10"5 mole-%, suitably at least 3 x 10"5 mole-%, in particular at least 5 x<br>
10"5 mole-%, calculated as moles of chloride, relative to the total feed.<br>
The present epoxidation process may be air-based or oxygen-based, see "Kirk-<br>

In the air-based process, air or air enriched with oxygen is employed as the source of the<br>
oxidizing agent while in the oxygen-based processes, high-purity (at least 95 mole-%) or<br>
very high purity (at least 99.5 mole-%) oxygen is employed as the source of the oxidizing<br>
agent. Reference may be made to US-6040467, incorporated by reference, for further<br>
description of oxygen-based processes. Presently most epoxidation plants are oxygenbased<br>
and this is a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The organic chloride for use in the present process may be chlorohydrocarbons.<br>
Preferably, the organic chloride is selected from the group of methyl chloride, ethyl<br>
chloride, ethylene dichloride, vinyl chloride or a mixture thereof. Most preferred reaction<br>
modifiers are ethyl chloride, vinyl chloride and ethylene dichloride.<br>
In addition to ethylene, oxygen and the organic chloride, the production feed during<br>
the normal epoxidation process may contain one or more optional components, such as<br>
nitrogen-containing reaction modifiers, carbon dioxide, inert gases and saturated<br>
hydrocarbons.<br>
Nitrogen oxides, organic nitro compounds such as nitromethane, nitroethane, and<br>
nitropropane, hydrazine, hydroxylamine or ammonia may be employed as reaction<br>
modifiers in the epoxidation process. It is frequently considered that under the operating<br>
conditions of ethylene epoxidation the nitrogen containing reaction modifiers are<br>
precursors of nitrates or nitrites, i.e. they are so-called nitrate- or nitrite-forming<br>
compounds. Reference may be made to EP-A-3642 and US-A-4822900, which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference, for further description of nitrogen-containing reaction<br>
modifiers.<br>
Suitable nitrogen oxides are of the general formula NOx wherein x is in the range of<br>
from 1 to 2.5, and include for example NO, N2O3, N2O4, and N2O5. Suitable organic<br>
nitrogen compounds are nitro compounds, nitroso compounds, amines, nitrates and nitrites,<br>
for example nitromethane, 1 -nitropropane or 2-nitropropane.<br>
Carbon dioxide is a by-product in the epoxidation process. However, carbon<br>
dioxide generally has an adverse effect on the catalyst activity, and high concentrations of<br>
carbon dioxide are therefore typically avoided. A typical epoxidation reactor feed during the<br>
normal epoxidation process may contain a quantity of carbon dioxide in the feed of at most<br>
10 mole-%, relative to the total feed, preferably at most 5 mole-%, relative to the total feed.<br>
A quantity of carbon dioxide of less than 3 mole-%, preferably less than 2 mole-%, more<br>
preferably less than 1 mole-%, relative to the total feed, may be employed. Under<br>
9<br>
commercial operations, a quantity of carbon dioxide of at least 0.1 mole-%, in particular at<br>
least 0.2 mole-%, relative to the total feed, may be present in the feed.<br>
The inert gas may be, for example, nitrogen or argon, or a mixture thereof. Suitable<br>
saturated hydrocarbons are propane and cyclopropane, and in particular methane and<br>
ethane. Saturated hydrocarbons may be added to the feed in order to increase the oxygen<br>
flammability limit.<br>
In the normal ethylene oxide production phase, the invention may be practiced by<br>
using methods known in the art of epoxidation processes. For further details of such<br>
epoxidation methods reference may be made, for example, to US-A-4761394, US-A-<br>
4766105, US-B1-6372925, US-A-4874879, and US-A-5155242, which are incorporated<br>
herein by reference<br>
In normal ethylene oxide production phase, the process may be carried out using<br>
reaction temperatures selected from a wide range. Preferably the reaction temperature is in<br>
the range of from 150 to 325 °C, more preferably in the range of from 180 to 300 °C.<br>
In the normal ethylene oxide production phase, the concentration of the components<br>
in the feed may be selected within wide ranges, as described hereinafter.<br>
The quantity of ethylene present in the production feed may be selected within a<br>
wide range. The quantity of ethylene present in the feed will be at most 80 mole-%,<br>
relative to the total feed. Preferably, it will be in the range of from 0.5 to 70 mole-%, in<br>
particular from 1 to 60 mole-%, on the same basis. Preferably, the quantity of ethylene in<br>
the production feed is substantially the same as used in the start-up process. If desired, the<br>
ethylene concentration may be increased during the lifetime of the catalyst, by which the<br>
selectivity may be improved in an operating phase wherein the catalyst has aged, see USB1-<br>
6372925 which methods are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The quantity of oxygen present in the production feed may be selected within a<br>
wide range. However, in practice, oxygen is generally applied in a quantity which avoids<br>
the flammable regime. The quantity of oxygen applied will be within the range of from 4<br>
to 15 mole-%, more typically from 5 to 12 mole-% of the total feed.<br>
In order to remain outside the flammable regime, the quantity of oxygen present in<br>
the feed may be lowered as the quantity of ethylene is increased. The actual safe operating<br>
ranges depend, along with the feed composition, also on the reaction conditions such as the<br>
reaction temperature and the pressure.<br>
10<br>
The organic chlorides are generally effective as a reaction modifier when used in<br>
small quantities in the production feed, for example up to 0.1 mole-%, calculated as moles<br>
of chloride, relative to the total production feed, for example from 0.01x10^ to 0.01 mole-<br>
%, calculated as moles of chloride, relative to the total production feed. In particular, it is<br>
preferred that the organic chloride may be present in the feed in a quantity of from lxlO"4<br>
to 50x10"* mole-%, in particular from 1.5x10"* to 25x10"* mole-%, more in particular from<br>
1.75X10"4 to 20x10^* mole-%, calculated as moles of chloride, relative to the total<br>
production feed. When nitrogen containing reaction modifiers are applied, they may be<br>
present in low quantities in the feed, for example up to 0.1 mole-%, calculated as moles of<br>
nitrogen, relative to the total production feed, for example from 0.01 xlO^ to 0.01 mole-%,<br>
calculated as moles of nitrogen, relative to the total production feed. In particular, it is<br>
preferred that the nitrogen containing reaction modifier may be present in the feed in a<br>
quantity of from 0.05x10^ to 50x10^ mole-%, in particular from 0.2x10^ to 30x10"* mole-<br>
%, more in particular from 0.5xl04 to 10x10^* mole-%, calculated as moles of nitrogen,<br>
relative to the total production feed.<br>
Any time during the normal ethylene oxide production phase, the quantity of the<br>
organic chloride in the production feed may be adjusted so as to achieve an optimal<br>
selectivity towards ethylene oxide formation.<br>
Inert gases, for example nitrogen or argon, may be present in the production feed in<br>
a quantity of 0.5 to 90 mole-%, relative to the total feed. In an air based process, inert gas<br>
may be present in the production feed in a quantity of from 30 to 90 mole-%, typically<br>
from 40 to 80 mole-%. In an oxygen-based process, inert gas may be present in the<br>
production feed in a quantity of from 0.5 to 30 mole-%, typically from 1 to 15 mole-%. If<br>
saturated hydrocarbons are present, they may be present in a quantity of up to 80 mole-%,<br>
relative to the total production feed, in particular up to 75 mole-%, same basis. Frequently<br>
they are present in a quantity of at least 30 mole-%, more frequently at least 40 mole-%,<br>
same basis.<br>
In the normal ethylene oxide production phase, the epoxidation process is<br>
preferably carried out at a reactor inlet pressure in the range of from 1000 to 3500 kPa.<br>
"GHSV" or Gas Hourly Space Velocity is the unit volume of gas at normal temperature<br>
and pressure (0 °C, 1 atm, i.e. 101.3 kPa) passing over one unit volume of packed catalyst<br>
per hour. Preferably, when the epoxidation process is a gas phase process involving a<br>
11<br>
packed catalyst bed, the GHSV is in the range of from 1500 to 10000 Nl/(l.h). Preferably,<br>
the process is carried out at a work rate in the range of from 0.5 to 10 kmole ethylene oxide<br>
produced per m3 of catalyst per hour, in particular 0.7 to 8 kmole ethylene oxide produced<br>
per m3 of catalyst per hour, for example 5 kmole ethylene oxide produced per m3 of<br>
catalyst per hour. As used herein, the work rate is the amount of ethylene oxide produced<br>
per unit volume of catalyst per hour and the selectivity is the molar quantity of ethylene<br>
oxide formed relative to the molar quantity of ethylene converted. Suitably, the process<br>
is conducted under conditions where ethylene oxide partial pressure in the product mix is<br>
in the range of from 5 to 200 kPa, for example 11 kPa, 27 kPa, 56 kPa, 77 kPa, 136 kPa,<br>
and 160 kPa. The term "product mix" as used herein is understood to refer to the product<br>
recovered from the outlet of an epoxidation reactor.<br>
Generally, the epoxidation catalyst is a supported catalyst. The carrier may be<br>
selected from a wide range of materials. Such carrier materials may be natural or artificial<br>
inorganic materials and they include silicon carbide, clays, pumice, zeolites, charcoal, and<br>
alkaline earth metal carbonates, such as calcium carbonate. Preferred are refractory carrier<br>
materials, such as alumina, magnesia, zirconia, silica, and mixtures thereof. The most<br>
preferred carrier material is a-alumina.<br>
The surface area of the carrier may suitably be at least 0.1 m2/g, preferably at least<br>
0.3 m2/g, more preferably at least 0.5 m2/g, and in particular at least 0.6 m2/g, relative to<br>
the weight of the carrier; and the surface area may suitably be at most 20 m2/g, preferably<br>
at most 10 m2/g, more preferably at most 6 m2/g, and in particular at most 4 m2/g, relative<br>
to the weight of the carrier. "Surface area" as used herein is understood to relate to the<br>
surface area as determined by the B.E.T. (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller) method as<br>
described in Journal of the American Chemical Society 60 (1938) pp. 309-316. High<br>
surface area carriers, in particular when they are alpha alumina carriers optionally<br>
comprising in addition silica, alkali metal and/or alkaline earth metal components, provide<br>
improved performance and stability of operation.<br>
The water absorption of the carrier may suitably be at least 0.2 g/g, preferably at<br>
least 0.25 g/g, more preferably at least 0.3 g/g, most preferably at least 0.35 g/g; and the<br>
water absorption may suitably be at most 0.85 g/g, preferably at most 0.7 g/g, more<br>
preferably at most 0.65 g/g, most preferably at most 0.6 g/g. The water absorption of the<br>
carrier may be in the range of from 0.2 to 0.85 g/g, preferably in the range of from 0.25 to<br>
0.7 g/g, more preferably from 0.3 to 0.65 g/g, most preferably from 0.42 to 0.52 g/g. A<br>
12<br>
higher water absorption may be in favor in view of a more efficient deposition of the metal<br>
and promoters on the carrier by impregnation. However, at a higher water absorption, the<br>
carrier, or the catalyst made therefrom, may have lower crush strength. As used herein,<br>
water absorption is deemed to have been measured in accordance with ASTM C20, and<br>
water absorption is expressed as the weight of the water that can be absorbed into the pores<br>
of the carrier, relative to the weight of the carrier.<br>
A carrier may be washed, to remove soluble residues, before deposition of the<br>
catalyst ingredients on the carrier. Additionally, the materials used to form the carrier,<br>
including the burnout materials, may be washed to remove soluble residues. Such carriers<br>
are described in US-B-6368998 and WO-A2-2007/095453, which are incorporated herein<br>
by reference. On the other hand, unwashed carriers may also be used successfully.<br>
Washing of the carrier generally occurs under conditions effective to remove most of the<br>
soluble and/or ionizable materials from the carrier.<br>
The washing liquid may be, for example water, aqueous solutions comprising one<br>
or more salts, or aqueous organic diluents. Suitable salts for inclusion in an aqueous<br>
solution may include, for example ammonium salts. Suitable ammonium salts may<br>
include, for example ammonium nitrate, ammonium oxalate, ammonium fluoride, and<br>
ammonium carboxylates, such as ammonium acetate, ammonium citrate, ammonium<br>
hydrogencitrate, ammonium formate, ammonium lactate, and ammonium tartrate. Suitable<br>
salts may also include other types of nitrates such as alkali metal nitrates, for example<br>
lithium nitrate, potassium nitrate and cesium nitrate. Suitable quantities of total salt<br>
present in the aqueous solution may be at least 0.001 %w, in particular at least 0.005 %w,<br>
more in particular at least 0.01 %w and at most 10 %w, in particular at most 1 %w, for<br>
example 0.03 %w. Suitable organic diluents which may or may not be included are, for<br>
example, one or more of methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran,<br>
ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether,<br>
dimethylformamide, acetone, or methyl ethyl ketone.<br>
The preparation of the silver catalyst is known in the art and the known methods are<br>
applicable to the preparation of the catalyst which may be used in the practice of the<br>
present invention. Methods of depositing silver on the carrier include impregnating the<br>
carrier or carrier bodies with a silver compound containing cationic silver and/or<br>
complexed silver and performing a reduction to form metallic silver particles. For further<br>
13<br>
description of such methods, reference may be made to US-A-5380697, US-A-5739075,<br>
US-A-4766105, and US-B-6368998, which are incorporated herein by reference. Suitably,<br>
silver dispersions, for example silver sols, may be used to deposit silver on the carrier.<br>
The reduction of cationic silver to metallic silver may be accomplished during a<br>
step in which the catalyst is dried, so that the reduction as such does not require a separate<br>
process step. This may be the case if the silver containing impregnation solution comprises<br>
a reducing agent, for example, an oxalate, a lactate or formaldehyde.<br>

As used herein, unless otherwise specified, the quantity of alkali metal present in<br>
the catalyst and the quantity of water leachable components present in the carrier are<br>
deemed to be the quantity insofar as it can be extracted from the catalyst or carrier with deionized<br>
water at 100 °C. The extraction method involves extracting a 10-gram sample of<br>
the catalyst or carrier three times by heating it in 20 ml portions of de-ionized water for 5<br>
minutes at 100 °C and determining in the combined extracts the relevant metals by using a<br>
known method, for example atomic absorption spectroscopy.<br>
As used herein, unless otherwise specified, the quantity of alkaline earth metal<br>
present in the catalyst and the quantity of acid leachable components present in the carrier<br>
are deemed to be the quantity insofar as it can be extracted from the catalyst or carrier with<br>
10 %w nitric acid in de-ionized water at 100 °C. The extraction method involves<br>
extracting a 10-gram sample of the catalyst or carrier by boiling it with a 100 ml portion of<br>
10 %w nitric acid for 30 minutes (1 atm., i.e. 101.3 kPa) and determining in the combined<br>
extracts the relevant metals by using a known method, for example atomic absorption<br>
spectroscopy. Reference is made to US-A-5801259, which is incorporated herein by<br>

Ethylene oxide produced may be recovered from the product mix by using methods<br>
known in the art, for example by absorbing ethylene oxide from a reactor outlet stream in<br>
water and optionally recovering ethylene oxide from the aqueous solution by distillation.<br>
At least a portion of the aqueous solution containing ethylene oxide may be applied in a<br>
subsequent process for converting ethylene oxide into a 1,2-diol, a 1,2-diol ether, a 1,2-<br>
carbonate, or an alkanolamine, in particular ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol ethers,<br>
ethylene carbonate, or alkanol amines.<br>
Ethylene oxide produced in the epoxidation process may be converted into a 1,2-diol, a<br>
1,2-diol ether, a 1,2-carbonate, or an alkanolamine. As this invention leads to a more attractive<br>
process for the production of ethylene oxide, it concurrently leads to a more attractive process<br>
which comprises producing ethylene oxide in accordance with the invention and the<br>
subsequent use of the obtained ethylene oxide in the manufacture of the 1,2-diol, 1,2-diol ether,<br>
1,2-carbonate, and/or alkanolamine.<br>
The conversion into the 1,2-diol (i.e., ethylene glycol) or the 1,2-diol ether (i.e.,<br>
ethylene glycol ethers) may comprise, for example, reacting ethylene oxide with water,<br>
suitably using an acidic or a basic catalyst. For example, for making predominantly the<br>
1,2-diol and less 1,2-diol ether, ethylene oxide may be reacted with a ten fold molar excess<br>

of water, in a liquid phase reaction in presence of an acid catalyst, e.g. 0.5-1.0 %w sulfuric<br>
acid, based on the total reaction mixture, at 50-70 °C at 1 bar absolute, or in a gas phase<br>
reaction at 130-240 °C and 20-40 bar absolute, preferably in the absence of a catalyst. The<br>
presence of such a large quantity of water may favor the selective formation of 1,2-diol and<br>
may function as a sink for the reaction exotherm, helping control the reaction temperature.<br>
If the proportion of water is lowered, the proportion of 1,2-diol ethers in the reaction<br>
mixture is increased. Alternative 1,2-diol ethers may be prepared by converting ethylene<br>
oxide with an alcohol, in particular a primary alcohol, such as methanol or ethanol, by<br>
replacing at least a portion of the water by the alcohol.<br>
Ethylene oxide may be converted into the corresponding 1,2-carbonate by reacting<br>
ethylene oxide with carbon dioxide. If desired, ethylene glycol may be prepared by<br>
subsequently reacting the 1,2-carbonate with water or an alcohol to form the glycol. For<br>
applicable methods, reference is made to US-6080897, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
The conversion into the alkanolamine may comprise, for example, reacting ethylene<br>
oxide with ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is typically used to favor the production of<br>
monoalkanolamine. For methods applicable in the conversion of ethylene oxide into the<br>
alkanolamine, reference may be made to, for example US-A-4845296, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The 1,2-diol and the 1,2-diol ether may be used in a large variety of industrial<br>
applications, for example in the fields of food, beverages, tobacco, cosmetics,<br>
thermoplastic polymers, curable resin systems, detergents, heat transfer systems, etc. The<br>
1,2-carbonates may be used as a diluent, in particular as a solvent. The alkanolamine may<br>
be used, for example, in the treating ("sweetening") of natural gas.<br>
