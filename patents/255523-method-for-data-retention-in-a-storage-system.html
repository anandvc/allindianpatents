BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to data storage and, more particularly, to a<br>
method and apparatus for data retention in a data storage system.<br>
2.	Discussion of Related Art<br>
Businesses and other institutions, such as hospitals, schools, and government<br>
agencies, often use data storage systems to maintain records in electronic form. Such<br>
records may include, for example, company financial records, electronic mail (e-mail),<br>
patient medical records, student transcripts, and other types of data. It may be important<br>
to the business or institution to maintain these records in their original form for a certain<br>
period of time after their creation. That is, the business or institution may desire to<br>
prevent the records from being deleted or modified until a certain period of time has<br>
elapsed. For example, a hospital may wish to prevent modification or deletion of patient<br>
x-rays for a certain number of years after the x-rays are taken. Further, such retention of<br>
data may be mandated by law. For example, Securities and Exchange Commission<br>
(SEC) Rule 17a-4 requires that companies preserve certain financial records for a period<br>
of six years.<br>
With conventional storage systems, users may accidentally delete or modify such<br>
records. Alternatively, malicious users may intentionally delete or modify such records,<br>
for example to conceal unscrupulous business practices or to dishonestly alter school<br>
transcripts. Whether accidental or intentional, such acts may cause an irreparable loss of<br>
data or even a violation of law. While some computer systems include a file system<br>
front end (often on a host computer rather than on a storage system) that allows files to<br>
be designated "read-only," an administrator of the system typically has the ability to<br>
change the "read-only" status of files such that the files may be modified or deleted.<br>
Further, conventional file systems do not allow the user to specify a period of time for<br>
which data cannot be deleted or modified. That is, designating a file "read-only" means<br>
that the file cannot be deleted or modified so long as the file's read-only status is not<br>
altered.<br><br>
Some storage systems store data on recording media, e.g., optical discs (such as,<br>
CD-ROM discs) which cannot be overwritten or modified. However, such systems do<br>
not allow the user to specify a retention period, as once data is written to the media it can<br>
never be deleted from the media, although the media may be physically destroyed to<br>
prevent access to the data. Such media is not reusable if it is ever desired to replace the<br>
data on the media with new data.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
One illustrative embodiment is directed to a method of processing data in a<br>
computer system comprising at least one host and at least one storage system. The<br>
method comprises acts of: (A) receiving a request, from the host, to delete a unit of data<br>
stored on the storage system; (B) determining whether a previously-defined retention<br>
period for the unit of data has expired; and (C) when it is determined in the act (B) that<br>
the retention period for the unit of data has not expired, denying the request to delete the<br>
unit of data. Another illustrative embodiment is directed to at least one computer<br>
readable medium encoded with instructions that, when executed on a computer system,<br>
performs the above-described method.<br>
A further illustrative embodiment is directed to a storage system for use in a<br>
computer system comprising at least one host and the storage system. The storage<br>
system comprises: at least one storage device to store data received from the at least one<br>
host; and at least one controller. The at least one controller receives a request, from the<br>
host, to delete a unit of data stored on the storage system; determines whether a<br>
previously-defined retention period for the unit of data has expired; and when it is<br>
determined that the retention period for the unit of data has not expired, denies the<br>
request to delete the unit of data.<br>
Another illustrative embodiment is directed to a storage system for use in a<br>
computer system comprising at least one host and the storage system. The storage<br>
system comprises at least one storage device to store data received from the at least one<br>
host; and at least one controller. The at least one controller receives at least one request,<br>
from the host, to store a unit of data in the storage system until at least the expiration of a<br>
retention period specified in the at least one request; stores the unit of data in the at least<br>
one storage device; and stores the information specifying the retention period in the at<br>
least one storage device.<br><br>
A further illustrative embodiment is directed to a method of processing data in a<br>
computer system comprising at least one host and at least one storage system. The<br>
method comprises an act of: (A) transmitting at least one request, from the host to the<br>
storage system, requesting that the storage system store a data unit until at least the<br>
expiration of a retention period specified in the at least one request.<br>
Another illustrative embodiment is directed to a method for use in a computer<br>
system comprising at least one host and at least one content addressable storage system<br>
that stores at least two different types of data units including blobs of data and content<br>
descriptor files (CDF) that correspond to the blobs, each CDF including metadata<br>
relating to the corresponding blob, each one of the blobs and CDFs being accessible to<br>
the at least one host computer using an identifier that is generated based on a content of<br>
the one of the blobs and CDFs. The method comprises an act of: (A) providing at least<br>
one piece of information in the identifier for each data unit to identify whether the<br>
identified data unit is a blob or a CDF.<br>
A further illustrative embodiment is directed to a method of processing data in a<br>
computer system comprising at least one host and at least one content addressable<br>
storage system that stores at least two different types of data units including a blob of<br>
data and a content descriptor file (CDF) that corresponds to the blob and forms a<br>
blob/CDF set with the blob, the CDF including metadata relating to the corresponding<br>
blob, each one of the blobs and CDFs being accessible to the at least one host computer<br>
using an identifier that is generated based on a content of the one of the blobs and CDFs,<br>
wherein the storage system executes a garbage collection utility that deletes blobs but<br>
only after the corresponding CDF has been deleted so that the blob does not have a<br>
corresponding CDF. The method comprises an act of: providing the host with at least<br>
two options for deleting at least one of a blob and CDF in a blob/CDF set, the at least<br>
two options differing in terms of how much processing of the deletion is performed<br>
upfront in response to a deletion request and how much processing of the deletion is left<br>
for the garbage collection utility.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Various embodiments of the present invention are directed to methods and<br>
apparatus for use in a computer system that includes a storage system and a host<br>
computer that communicate to perform operations on data. For example, the storage<br>
system may store data (write) in response to a request from the host computer to store the<br>
data, return stored data (read) in response to a request from the host computer for the<br>
stored data, and delete stored data in response to a request from the host computer to<br>
delete the data.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, when sending a request to the storage<br>
system to store data, a host computer (defined herein as any computer capable of writing<br>
data to a storage system) may provide the storage system with the data to be stored and a<br>
retention period associated with the data to be stored. The retention period may, for<br>
example, define a period of time for which the data cannot be deleted or modified. The<br>
storage system may store the data and its associated retention period. If the storage<br>
system later receives a request from a host computer to delete or modify the data, the<br>
storage system may first evaluate the stored retention period associated with the data to<br>
determine if the retention period has expired. If the retention period has not expired, the<br>
storage system will not delete or modify the data. In this manner, once the retention<br>
period has been established for a unit of data, the storage system ensures that the unit of<br>
data is retained in an unmodified state for the full retention period.<br>
An exemplary system on which various embodiments of the invention may be<br>
implemented is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 shows a storage system 101 that<br>
communicates with a plurality of hosts 105a, 105b,..., 105n through a network 103. As<br><br>
used herein, a "network" (e.g., network 103) is a group of two or more devices<br>
interconnected by one or more segments of transmission media on which<br>
communications may be exchanged between the devices. Each segment may be any of a<br>
plurality of types of transmission media, including one or more electrical or optical wires<br>
or cables made of metal and/or optical fiber, air (e.g., using wireless transmission over<br>
carrier waves) or any combination of these transmission media.<br>
Storage system 101 may include one or more storage devices (e.g., disks drives)<br>
to store applications, application data, user data, and the like in the computer system.<br>
Storage system 101 may be accessed by hosts 105 for the purposes of storing, retrieving,<br>
or performing operations on data stored on storage system 101. It should be appreciated<br>
that storage system 101 may be a device used primarily for data storage, or may be a<br>
device that performs a variety of other functions, such as executing user applications.<br>
That is, storage system 101 may be any device that is capable of storing and retrieving<br>
data.<br>
Hosts 105 may be, for example, servers that provide resources (e.g., data storage,<br>
email, and other services), clients (e.g., general-purpose computer systems operated by<br>
users), network components (e.g., switches) or any other type of computer. Hosts 105<br>
are coupled by network 103 to storage system 101 so that the hosts 105 can use the<br>
storage system 101 to store and retrieve data.<br>
It should be appreciated that the storage configuration shown in Figure 1 is only<br>
an example of the types of systems on which aspects of the present invention can be<br>
implemented, as the invention is not limited to use with any particular type of system<br>
configuration. For example, there need not be multiple hosts connected to a single<br>
storage system, and any of numerous other types of connection, (e.g., direct connections)<br>
can be used in addition to, or instead of, a network.<br>
The Host 105 can access data on the storage system 101 in any of numerous<br>
ways, as the aspects of the present invention described herein are not limited to any<br>
particular type of system configuration. For example, in some computer systems,<br>
application programs executing on host 105 store information on files managed by a file<br>
system (e.g., executing on host 105). The file system maps the name of each particular<br>
file to one or more logical volumes and blocks of storage therein for storing the data<br>
within the file. The logical volumes may correspond directly to physical storage devices<br>
provided on the storage system 101, or when the storage system 101 is an intelligent<br><br>
storage system, the storage system may perform another layer of mapping between the<br>
logical volumes presented to hosts 105 and the actual physical storage devices within the<br>
storage system 101.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention discussed below is adapted for use in a<br>
computer system of the type described in commonly assigned co-pending applications<br>
serials nos. 09/236,366, entitled "Content Addressable Information Encapsulation,<br>
Representation, and Transfer", filed January 21,1999, 09/235,146 entitled "Access to<br>
Content Addressable Data Over A Network", filed January 21 1999 and 09/391,360,<br>
entitled System and Method for Secure Storage, Transfer and Retrieval of Content<br>
Addressable Information, filed September 7, 1999, each of which is incorporated herein<br>
by reference. These applications relate to content addressable storage (CAS) and are<br>
referred to collectively as "the CAS applications".<br>
In a content addressable system, data is stored using a content address generated<br>
based upon the content of the data itself. The content address may be generated by<br>
applying a hash function to the data to be stored. The output of the hash function is the<br>
content address that may be used in communication between the host and storage system<br>
to refer to the data. The content address can be mapped (e.g., within the storage system<br>
101) to one or more physical storage locations within the storage system. The use of<br>
content addressing is particularly well adapted to applications wherein the information<br>
stored does not change (i.e., fixed content data), such as numerous types of records such<br>
as those discussed above.<br>
One example of a hash function that may be used to generate the content address<br>
is message digest 5 (MD5). The content address can correspond directly to the result of<br>
the hash of the content, or additional information can be added to the hash result to<br>
generate the address. In one embodiment, information describing whether the content<br>
being stored is host data or metadata associated with host data is added to the hash of the<br>
content to generate the content address. This additional information is useful in ways<br>
described below. It should be understood that any type of hash function may be used, as<br>
the aspects of the invention described herein are not limited to the use of any type of<br>
hash function, or even to use in a content addressable system.<br>
When a host sends data to the storage system to be stored therein, both the host<br>
and the storage system may independently compute the content address of the data. The<br>
host may retain the content address for use in the future to retrieve the data from the<br><br>
storage system. Alternatively, when the host sends data to the storage system, only the<br>
storage system may compute the content address and return the computed content<br>
address to the host for later use in accessing the data. As yet another alternative, both the<br>
storage system and the host may compute the content address, and the storage system can<br>
return its generated the content address to the host. The host can compare its<br>
independently computed content address to the one received from the storage system to<br>
verify that they match.<br>
As discussed above, for some types of fixed content data, such as patient x-rays<br>
or company financial records, it may be desired to retain the data in its original form,<br>
which means that modification of the data should not be allowed once the data has been<br>
stored on the storage system. In one embodiment of the invention for use with the<br>
above-referenced CAS applications, a characteristic of the content addressing system<br>
described in those applications is used to prevent modifications to previously written<br>
data. This characteristic is illustrated conceptually in Figure 2, which illustrates that<br>
when a host stores original data 201 on a storage system, a content address 205 for the<br>
original data is generated by hashing function 203. The host may later retrieve a copy of<br>
the data from the storage system using content address 205. If the host seeks to modify<br>
the data and re-write it to the storage system as modified data 207, a new content address<br>
209 is generated by hashing function 203 for the modified data. Because original data<br>
201 and modified data 207 are different, hashing function 203 will generate different<br>
content addresses for data 201 and data 207. As a result, content addresses 205 and 209<br>
will map to different physical locations on the storage device(s) of the storage system.<br>
Thus, when the host stores modified data 207 in the storage system, it is stored at a<br>
different location from original data 201 and does not overwrite the original data. Thus,<br>
original data 201 remains unmodified on the storage system.<br>
It should be appreciated that the embodiment of the present invention that<br>
prevents modification of data once written is not limited to use with a content<br>
addressable system, as alternative techniques can be employed in systems using other<br>
types of addressing schemes to prevent modification of data previously written. For<br>
example, a host and/or file system may preclude writing to data previously written, and<br>
may require any modified data to be mapped to a different storage location.<br>
As mentioned above, in addition to preventing modification of data, it may also<br>
be desirable to prevent deletion of data before the expiration of a previously defined<br><br>
retention period. One embodiment of the invention is directed to techniques for ensuring<br>
that data cannot be deleted during a previously specified retention period. As discussed<br>
above, one embodiment of the present invention can be used in connection with the<br>
architecture described in the CAS applications. Figure 3 illustrates the manner in which<br>
data is stored in accordance with the that architecture.<br>
A unit of data in the architecture defined in the CAS applications is referred to as<br>
a blob (e.g., blob 303). Blob 303 may be, for example, the binary data to be stored by a<br>
host (e.g., host 105 in Figure 1) on a storage system (e.g., storage system 105), such as,<br>
for example, a patient x-ray, company financial records, or any other type of data. When<br>
the blob 303 is stored to the content addressable storage system, a unique address is<br>
generated for the blob 303 based upon its content in the manner discussed above.<br>
Each blob 303 has at least one content descriptor file (CDF) associated with it.<br>
CDF 301 may include metadata 305 and a plurality of references 307a, 307b,... ,307n .<br>
A CDF may reference one or more blobs or CDFs. Thus, the references 307 may be, for<br>
example, references to the blobs and/or CDFs referenced by CDF 301. Metadata 305<br>
may, for example, include the creation date of CDF 301 (e.g., the date that CDF 301 was<br>
stored on the storage system) and a description of the content of blob 303. In accordance<br>
with one embodiment of the invention, the metadata further includes information<br>
specifying a retention period related to the associated blob 303. The retention period<br>
may be, for example, specified as a period of time from the creation date of blob 303<br>
and/or CDF 301 during which blob 303 and CDF 301 may not be deleted. Thus, for<br>
example, if the retention period included in CDF 301 is two years, the storage system<br>
will not permit deletion of CDF 301 and blob 303 for two years from the creation date<br>
included in metadata 305 of CDF 301.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the retention period<br>
defined in the metadata 305 relates directly to the CDF 301, and only indirectly to the<br>
blob 303. This aspect of the present invention is adapted for use in a system architecture<br>
wherein a host cannot seek to directly delete a blob 303 (i.e., any such request is denied),<br>
but can only seek to delete a CDF 301, and wherein a garbage collection utility<br>
(described in more detail below) is employed on the storage system to clean up blobs that<br>
have been identified for deletion. A blob may be identified for deletion if there are no<br>
CDFs that reference it. In this respect, one aspect of that architecture is that a blob<br><br>
cannot be deleted so long as it is referenced by at least one CDF 301, but any blob that is<br>
not referenced by a CDF can be deleted.<br>
It should be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to use in a<br>
system having the architecture described above, as many of the architectural features<br>
described above are merely implementation details. None is necessary to practicing the<br>
present invention. For example, rather than defining a retention period solely for a CDF,<br>
retention periods could alternatively be defined directly for a blob. If the blob itself<br>
carried a retention period, it would then be possible to allow host computers to directly<br>
delete blobs whose retention periods had expired.<br>
The description of the blob 303 included in metadata 305 may include<br>
information describing the content of blob 303. For example, if blob 303 is an x-ray,<br>
metadata 305 may include information such as the patient's name, the data the x-ray was<br>
taken, additional doctor's notes regarding the x-ray or patient, or other information. It<br>
should be appreciated that the types of metadata given above are only examples of the<br>
types of metadata that may be included in metadata 305 of CDF 301. Indeed, any data<br>
related to blob 303 may be included in metadata 305, as the present invention is not<br>
limited in this respect.<br>
CDF 301 may also include one or more references 307. These references may be,<br>
for example, references to blobs or other CDFs. For example, reference 307a may<br>
include the content address or file system location of blob 303, so that CDF 301 "points<br>
to" blob 303 through reference 307a. Hence, blob 303 may be accessed by a host using<br>
the content address or file system location of CDF 301, because reading the contents of<br>
CDF 301 provides the content addresses or file system location for blob 303. In the<br>
embodiment shown, CDF 301 also includes a reference 307b that "points to" itself, i.e.,<br>
reference 307b includes the content address or file system location of CDF 301. This<br>
circular reference is provided to facilitate one embodiment of the garbage collection<br>
process described below in greater detail. However, the present invention is not limited<br>
to the use of that garbage collection process, or to the use of a circular reference in each<br>
CDF, as other implementations are possible. CDF 301 may include a plurality of other<br>
references that point to other CDFs or blobs, so that those CDFs or blobs may also be<br>
accessible using the content address of CDF 301.<br>
In the example of Figure 3, only one CDF (i.e., CDF 301) is shown "pointing to"<br>
blob 303. However, it should be appreciated that multiple CDFs may include references<br><br>
to the same blob. That is, two or more CDFs may "point to" the same blob. When<br>
multiple CDFs include references to the same blob, these multiple CDFs may include<br>
different metadata, including different creation dates and/or different retention periods.<br>
For example, one CDF that "points to" the blob may specify a retention period of two<br>
years from its creation date of July 15,2003, and a second may specify a retention period<br>
of three years from the same creation date. In accordance with one embodiment of the<br>
invention, the storage system may enforce the longest of the retention periods. Thus, on<br>
July 15,2005, the storage system will permit deletion of the first CDF, but will not<br>
permit deletion of the second CDF or the blob referenced thereby. However, on July 15,<br>
2006, the storage system will permit deletion of the first CDF (if not already deleted) and<br>
the second CDF, thereby allowing for garbage collection of the blob.<br>
The embodiment of the present invention that employs the longest retention<br>
period specified for a blob does so to ensure that a user cannot circumvent an earlier-<br>
specified retention period by simply creating a new CDF for a blob that specifies a<br>
shorter retention period. The longest retention period for a blob is enforced in one<br>
embodiment of the invention by the above-described implementation wherein a blob<br>
cannot be deleted so long as it is referenced by any CDF. However, it should be<br>
appreciated that the aspect of the present invention that relates to enforcing the longest<br>
defined retention period is not limited to this implementation, as other techniques are<br>
possible.<br>
When a host stores a blob on the storage system, it may provide the storage<br>
system with the blob and a CDF that is associated with the blob in a manner described in<br>
more detail below. The host may use the content address of the CDF to access the CDF,<br>
and thereby access the blob metadata and references included therein. The host may then<br>
use a blob reference (i.e., the content address or file system location of the blob) obtained<br>
from the CDF to access the blob (data) itself. Alternatively, after writing a blob, the host<br>
may retain the content address of the blob and use this content address to access the blob<br>
directly.<br>
After a blob is created, one or more additional CDFs may be created that<br>
reference it. This may be done, for example, if it is desired to associate additional<br>
metadata with the blob, such as metadata to increase the retention period of the blob or<br>
add additional description information that is associated with the blob. Such additional<br>
CDFs may reference either the first CDF, the blob itself, or both.<br><br>
In the example described above, the retention period was specified as a period of<br>
time in years from the creation date of the CDF. However, it should be understood that<br>
the retention period may be specified at a finer granularity. For example, the retention<br>
period may be specified in years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, or any<br>
combination of these (or any other) lengths of time. Further, the retention period need<br>
not be specified as a period of time from the creation date of the CDF. For example, the<br>
retention period may be specified as a date and/or time when the CDF and referenced<br>
blobs may be deleted. In one embodiment discussed in detail below, the retention period<br>
may be specified as a period of time from the occurrence of a specified event.<br>
As discussed above, when a host creates a CDF for storage on the storage system,<br>
the host may specify a retention period which is included in the content of the CDF. The<br>
retention period may be specified as a period of time from the creation date of the CDF.<br>
In one embodiment, the storage system seeks to retain control over the retention period,<br>
to ensure that a host cannot delete data prior to expiration of the specified retention<br>
period. Thus, when a retention period is based upon a creation date for the CDF, it is<br>
desirable to base the creation data from a clock of the trusted storage system, to prevent a<br>
host from spoofing an incorrect creation date to bypass a retention period imposed on the<br>
data. For example, suppose on September 15,2003 a CDF is stored with a retention<br>
period of two years. Thus, the intended date of expiration of the CDF is September 15,<br>
2005. However, if the host spoofed a creation date timestamp of September 15,2002<br>
into the CDF, the CDF would expire on September 15, 2004, one year before the<br>
intended expiration date of the CDF. Therefore, in accordance with one embodiment of<br>
the invention, techniques are employed that allow the storage system to ensure that the<br>
creation date timestamp in the CDF is an accurate reflection of the actual creation date of<br>
the CDF. This can be done in any of numerous ways, as the aspects of the present<br>
invention directed to having the storage system verify the creation date for stored data is<br>
not limited to the particular implementations described below.<br>
To ensure the accuracy of the creation date timestamp provided by the host, in<br>
one embodiment, the host is provided with an application programming interface (API)<br>
that interacts with the storage system to assist in ensuring the accuracy of the creation<br>
date for any data written to the storage system. In one embodiment, the host API<br>
communicates with the storage system to get the current time from the storage system<br>
(e.g., from the storage system's clock or any source trusted by the storage system), and<br><br>
compares the current time from the storage system's clock to the current time at the host<br>
(e.g., from the host's clock). From this comparison, the host determines a delta value<br>
indicating the difference in time between the storage system's clock and the host's clock.<br>
The information relating to the storage system's clock may be communicated to the host<br>
in any of numerous ways. In one embodiment, whenever the storage system sends a<br>
communication to the host, the current time from the storage system's clock is added<br>
onto the communication. Thus, each time the host receives a communication from the<br>
storage system, the host may compare the current time received from the storage system<br>
and the current time according to the host's clock, and update the delta value<br>
accordingly. When the host creates a CDF and sends it to the storage system for storage,<br>
the creation date timestamp may be written into the CDF by adding the delta value to the<br>
current time specified by the host's clock, so that the creation date can be verified by the<br>
storage system based upon its own clock.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, before the creation date timestamp is written<br>
into the CDF, the host checks to make sure that the delta value has been checked within a<br>
reasonable period of time. For example, if the host has not received the storage system's<br>
clock within the last ten seconds, the host may directly query the storage system for its<br>
current time for use in creating the date timestamp in the CDF.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the storage system may optionally verify the<br>
creation date of the CDF upon receipt of the CDF from the host, as further protection<br>
against the host attempting to spoof a false creation time for data being written. That is,<br>
the storage system may compare the creation date timestamp in the CDF to the time<br>
when the write request is received at the storage system. If the two do not match within<br>
some reasonable tolerance (e.g., ten seconds), then the storage system may deny the<br>
request to store the CDF. The tolerance can be defined in any suitable way, as this<br>
aspect of the present invention is not limited in any respect. For example, the tolerance<br>
may specify a threshold value that may not be exceeded by the difference between the<br>
CDF's creation date timestamp and the time according to the storage system clock. The<br>
tolerance may be, for example, a fixed period of time, such as ten seconds, or any other<br>
reasonable period of time. Alternatively, the tolerance may be proportional to the<br>
retention period of the CDF, so that if the retention period is small, the tolerance is also<br>
small, whereas if the retention period of the CDF is large, the tolerance can also be<br>
relatively large. Any suitable function may be used to define the relationship between<br><br>
the length of the retention period and the tolerance, as the invention is not limited to this<br>
respect.<br>
As discussed above, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
a blob cannot be directly deleted by a host. In accordance with this embodiment, any<br>
request from a host to directly delete a blob will be rejected by the storage system. In<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a technique is employed to<br>
identify whether a data unit stored on the storage system is a blob or a CDF, to<br>
distinguish whether a delete request is to a blob and is to be denied, or is to a CDF and<br>
may be granted subject to certain conditions discussed below. This aspect of the present<br>
invention can be implemented in any of numerous ways.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the content address<br>
for any data unit stored on the storage system includes at least one bit that is in addition<br>
to the hash generated from the content of the data unit in the manner discussed above,<br>
and the additional bit is used to identify whether the data associated with the content<br>
address is a blob or a CDF. In this manner, when the host seeks to access a unit of data,<br>
the content address provided identifies to the storage system whether the data unit is a<br>
blob or a CDF, and the storage system can use this information to process such deletion<br>
requests differently. In this respect, deletion requests directed to a blob will be denied,<br>
and deletion requests directed to a CDF will be handled in the manner discussed below in<br>
connection with Figure 4.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the content address<br>
is generated by the storage system itself, and is returned to the host. In this respect, the<br>
storage system employs the above-described technique for generating the content<br>
address, and is a trusted source for generating such addresses authentically. By having<br>
the content address generated by the storage system, it is ensured that a host cannot spoof<br>
the storage system by, for example, falsely identifying content data (i.e., a blob) as a<br>
CDF to enable it to later be deleted directly. In this respect, one embodiment of the<br>
present invention is directed to providing a storage system that can meet with rigorous<br>
requirements for ensuring that retention policies are met, irrespective of the behavior of<br>
hosts connected thereto. An example of such an environment is to provide a storage<br>
system that complies with SEC Rule 17a-4 requirements for preserving financial records<br>
for a stated period of time.<br><br>
Figure 4 is a flow chart that illustrates the process for handling a request to delete<br>
a CDF from a storage system in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. This<br>
process can be executed by the storage system itself, or by a separate computer that<br>
provides an interface between the host(s) and the storage system. The process begins in<br>
act 403 with the receipt of a request at the storage system to delete a CDF. As discussed<br>
above, the request may, for example, identify the CDF by its content address. In one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, techniques are employed to ensure that the subject<br>
of the deletion request is in fact a CDF. Those steps can be performed before initiating<br>
the process shown in Figure 4, or alternatively, can be integrated into the process, by<br>
performing an additional verification step, and by denying the request if it is not directed<br>
to a CDF. After the request is received, the process proceeds to act 405, where the CDF<br>
is read from the storage system. The process then proceeds to act 407, where the process<br>
examines the metadata of the CDF and evaluates the retention period to determine if the<br>
retention period has expired. When the retention period has expired, the storage system<br>
deletes the CDF in act 409, and then terminates in act 413. Deletion of the CDF may be<br>
performed in several different ways, as will be discussed below in more detail. As<br>
mentioned above, deletion of the CDF may lead (indirectly) to deletion of any blobs<br>
referenced by the CDF in a manner discussed below in greater detail. When it is<br>
determined in act 407 that the retention period has not yet expired, the process denies the<br>
request to delete the CDF. The storage system may optionally return an error message to<br>
the requestor (e.g., a host). The process then terminates at act 413.<br>
Information relating to the CDFs and blobs can be stored in any suitable manner,<br>
as the present invention is not limited to any particular implementation technique. In<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, such information is stored<br>
within tables in a database suitable for use with unstructured variable length records.<br>
Each blob and CDF may have an associated table that stores, for example, the content<br>
address of the blob or CDF, the content address of any CDFs that reference (or point to)<br>
the blob or CDF, and other information, such as which physical storage location(s) (e.g.,<br>
disks) store the blob or CDF, a creation timestamp, the physical location(s) for any<br>
mirrors of the blob or CDF, etc. The reference tables for a CDF need not include entries<br>
identifying which blobs the CDF points to, because the content of the CDF itself contains<br>
such information. The reference tables may include a reference count to be used in the<br>
garbage collection process. The reference count may indicate how many CDFs reference<br><br>
a particular blob or CDF. For example, the garbage collector may examine the reference<br>
count associated with a particular blob or CDF to determine if any CDFs reference the<br>
particular blob or CDF. If the blob or CDF is unreferenced, the garbage collector may<br>
delete it. Many other types of information may be stored in the table, as the invention is<br>
not limited in this respect. It should be appreciated that the entire table need not be<br>
stored in a single location on a single storage system, and that parts of the table may be<br>
distributed throughout different locations of one or more storage systems. Additionally,<br>
it should be understood that a single database need not be employed to store the tables<br>
for all blobs and CDFs, as any suitable configuration can be used, including one that<br>
does not employ database tables at all.<br>
As should be appreciated from the foregoing, embodiments of the present<br>
invention can be used in systems where a CDF may point not only to blobs of data, but<br>
also to other CDFs. This architecture is useful in creating hierarchies of stored<br>
information. For example, a blob could contain an x-ray for an individual, such that a<br>
first level CDF may refer to the x-ray and identify it as belonging to a particular<br>
individual. In addition, that x-ray may also be grouped with a number of x-rays for that<br>
individual, or his family, with a higher level CDF pointing to a number of the lower level<br>
CDFs to create a logical hierarchy.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, when a higher level<br>
CDF is created that points to one or more lower level CDFs, the references to the lower<br>
level CDFs are included in the content of the higher level CDF, so that the higher level<br>
CDF logically points to the lower level CDFs. In one embodiment, references to lower-<br>
level CDFs may simply be included as metadata or descriptors in the content of the<br>
higher level CDF, as the architecture does not contemplate one CDF pointing to another<br>
in the manner in which a CDF points to a blob as discussed herein (i.e., the address of the<br>
higher level CDF is not provided in the reference table for the lower level CDF).<br>
However, in an alternate embodiment of the present invention, such references can be<br>
provided so that a higher level CDF may point to a lower level CDF and have its address<br>
provided in the reference table for the lower level CDF. In accordance with this<br>
implementation, the lower level CDF cannot be deleted while it is pointed to by the<br>
higher level CDF, such that deletion of the lower level CDF will require a prior deletion<br>
of the higher level CDF.<br><br>
As discussed above, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
a garbage collection technique is employed that deletes any blob that is not referenced by<br>
a CDF. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, when a blob is<br>
written to the storage system, it is written before its corresponding CDF. Thus, when the<br>
blob is written, the content address for its CDF may not yet have been generated, such<br>
that it may not be available to include as a reference in the table associated with the blob.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a technique is employed to<br>
ensure that a blob written before its CDF does not appear to the garbage collection utility<br>
as an unreferenced blob, thereby leading the garbage collection utility to delete the newly<br>
written blob.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the writing of a<br>
blob and CDF is considered to constitute a transaction, and an identifier is assigned to the<br>
transaction. When the blob is written, the transaction identifier is used as a placeholder<br>
in the blob's reference table in place of the not-yet-generated content address of the CDF<br>
that will reference the blob. The garbage collection utility recognizes the placeholder<br>
and will not delete the blob. When the CDF is later written and its content address is<br>
computed, the transaction number in the blob reference table is replaced with the content<br>
address of the CDF.<br>
It should be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to employing the<br>
above-referenced technique of providing a temporary transaction number when a blob is<br>
initially written, as other suitable techniques can be employed to ensure that the blob will<br>
not be deleted by the garbage collection utility. Furthermore, such a technique need not<br>
be employed in connection with embodiments of the present invention used in systems<br>
that do not employ a garbage collection utility, that employ a garbage collection utility<br>
that employs a different technique for determining which blobs should be deleted (rather<br>
than looking for blobs that are not referenced by any CDF), or systems that do not write<br>
blobs to the storage system before their associated CDFs.<br>
As discussed above, one embodiment of the present invention is adapted for use<br>
with a garbage collector utility. The garbage collector may be, for example, a<br>
background process that executes on the storage system to reclaim disk space that has<br>
previously been allocated for storage, but is no longer needed (e.g., because the CDF or<br>
blob stored in that space has been marked for deletion). In one embodiment of the<br>
invention, the garbage collector searches the reference table(s) for blobs and CDFs<br><br>
looking for blobs or CDFs that are not referenced by any CDF. When the garbage<br>
collector finds such blobs or CDFs, the garbage collector deletes them and removes their<br>
corresponding entries from the reference table(s). It should be appreciated that when the<br>
garbage collector "deletes" a particular CDF or blob, the file that includes the CDF or<br>
blob may simply be removed from the file system of the storage system. Alternatively,<br>
in one embodiment of the invention adapted for use with applications desiring more<br>
secure deletion, the physical location(s) that stored the blob or CDF data may be<br>
overwritten with data (e.g., random bits or a specified sequence of bits) such that the<br>
actual binary data of the blob or CDF is erased or electronically "shredded" using any<br>
suitable technique.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the reference tables associated with<br>
every CDF that has not been marked for deletion has a circular reference to the CDF<br>
itself, to ensure that if the CDF is not referenced by another, the garbage collection<br>
routine will not delete it as an unreferenced CDF in the manner discussed above. It<br>
should be appreciated that the present invention is not limited in this respect, as other<br>
garbage collection techniques can be employed that do not rely on the lack of a reference<br>
from another CDF as a basis for deleting a CDF. For example, when used in accordance<br>
with the embodiment of the present invention that employs a unique identifier to<br>
differentiate between CDFs and blobs, the garbage collection utility could look to that<br>
unique identifier and recognize that unreferenced CDFs should not be deleted, whereas<br>
only unreferenced blobs should be.<br>
As discussed above, in one embodiment of the invention, a host is not permitted<br>
to delete blobs directly. That is, any attempt to delete a blob directly (e.g., by sending a<br>
delete command to the storage system with the content address of the blob) will be<br>
denied by the storage system. This restriction is independent of the application program<br>
or utility of the host that issues the request, or the access privileges of the requestor (e.g.,<br>
even requests from a system administrator of the host will be denied). Thus, the host<br>
may delete blobs only by deleting all CDFs that reference the blob, and once the blob is<br>
no longer referenced by any CDFs, it will be deleted by the garbage collector.<br>
As discussed above, in one embodiment of the invention the storage system may<br>
be able to distinguish a delete request for a blob from a delete request for a CDF. In one<br>
embodiment, when a host sends a delete request to the storage system, the host may<br>
include the content address of the data to be deleted, along with information (e.g., a<br><br>
boolean) that indicates whether the content address corresponds to a blob or a CDF. If<br>
the host indicates that the content address corresponds to a blob, the storage system will<br>
deny the deletion request, as direct deletion of blobs is forbidden in one embodiment of<br>
the invention. However, if the boolean indicates that the content address corresponds to<br>
a CDF, the storage system will process the request to delete the data corresponding to the<br>
content address provided by the host. Before the storage system deletes any data, the<br>
storage system checks the metadata associated with the data requested for deletion to<br>
determine if the retention period for the data has expired. In one embodiment, the<br>
storage system may find the retention period associated with a CDF in the content of the<br>
CDF itself. If the retention period has expired, the storage system may delete the CDF.<br>
If the content address provided by the host corresponds to a blob (such that the indication<br>
in the boolean that it corresponds to a CDF is erroneous), the storage system will be<br>
unable to find a retention period in the content of the blob. When no retention period is<br>
found in the content of the data to be deleted, the storage system will deny the deletion<br>
request. Thus, any request to delete a blob will fail, as the storage system will be unable<br>
to locate a retention period in the content of the blob. This prevents a host from<br>
bypassing the retention period established in a CDF by directly deleting the blob itself.<br>
In another embodiment, the storage system may distinguish a delete request for a<br>
blob from a delete request for a CDF based on additional information added to the<br>
content address. As mentioned above, the content address may be derived from a hash of<br>
the data of the blob or CDF. The content address may include an additional identifier to<br>
indicate whether the content address is the address of a blob or a CDF. The identifier<br>
may be located anywhere within the content address. For example, when using a 26<br>
character hash value as the content address, the identifier may be an additional character<br>
arranged such that thirteen characters of the hash value precede the identifier and thirteen<br>
characters of the hash value follow the identifier.<br>
Deletion of a CDF and associated blob(s) may be performed in any of numerous<br>
ways. The techniques described below can be considered as alternative techniques for<br>
adoption within a given system configuration, as only one technique for deleting a CDF<br>
and its associated blob(s) may be provided. However, in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, two or more of the below-described deletion<br>
techniques are provided on a single system (e.g., implemented by the storage system),<br>
such that the user is provided with a choice of options for performing a deletion. As is<br><br>
discussed in greater detail below, some methods may require a relatively small amount of<br>
initial processing and leave a relatively large amount of processing for the garbage<br>
collector, whereas others may require a relatively greater amount of initial processing but<br>
leave less work for the garbage collector (if a garbage collector is used at all). It should<br>
be appreciated that the deletion techniques described below are only performed once it is<br>
determined (e.g., in act 407 in Figure 4) that the retention period has expired. Thus, the<br>
techniques below can be performed to implement the act of deleting the CDF at act 409<br>
in the process of Figure 4.<br>
A first method is referred to as fire and forget. As mentioned above, in one<br>
embodiment, a CDF includes a circular reference to itself (e.g., stored in that CDF's<br>
entry in the reference table). In response to a request to delete the CDF, after verifying<br>
that the retention period has expired, the fire and forget method simply removes the<br>
circular reference to the CDF. So long as the CDF is not referenced by any other CDFs<br>
(in which case deletion would not be authorized), the garbage collector will eventually<br>
delete the CDF in the manner discussed above when it discovers that the CDF is now<br>
unreferenced. When the garbage collector deletes the CDF, it also searches the reference<br>
table(s) to locate any other blobs or CDFs that were referenced by the deleted CDF, and<br>
removes any of the reference table entries which identify those blobs and CDFs as being<br>
reference by the deleted CDF. This removal may result in a blob that was referenced by<br>
the CDF no longer being referenced by any CDFs, which will result in the garbage<br>
collector eventually deleting any such blob once it is discovered that the blob is<br>
unreferenced.<br>
The fire and forget technique is initially very fast, in that the storage system does<br>
relatively little processing before responding to the host that the CDF is deleted, and<br>
leaves much of the processing for the garbage collector. A characteristic of the fire and<br>
forget technique is that when the host seeks to delete a blob by deleting its corresponding<br>
CDF, an indication returned from the storage system that the CDF has been deleted is not<br>
an indication that the corresponding blob (even if it is now unreferenced) has been<br>
deleted, as there may be some lag time for the garbage collector to search through all of<br>
the blob and CDF reference tables and delete all table entries identifying the newly<br>
deleted CDF, and to thereafter discover that a blob is now unreferenced and to delete it.<br>
As a result of this lag time, data may be read even after the deletion has been<br>
acknowledged.<br><br>
A second method of deletion is referred to as asynchronous deletion. As in fire<br>
and forget, asynchronous deletion also removes the circular reference from the CDF.<br>
However, in asynchronous deletion, the CDF is then moved to a different location that<br>
indicates that the CDF has been deleted and makes the CDF no longer available to be<br>
read by the host. The new location for the CDF may be a special file system location<br>
such as a "deleted folder." It should be appreciated that the deleted CDF can be<br>
"moved" in any suitable manner, including an actual physical movement of the data<br>
associated with the CDF, by altering the file system location of the CDF or by marking<br>
the CDF with a designator indicating that it is now in the deleted folder. The garbage<br>
collector may access CDFs in the deleted folder and read the contents of those deleted<br>
CDFs to determine which CDFs and/or blobs are referenced thereby. The garbage<br>
collector may then remove any references to the deleted CDF from the reference table,<br>
and may also delete any blobs that are unreferenced as a result of those deletions.<br>
In contrast to the fire and forget technique, the asynchronous deletion technique<br>
requires more upfront processing by the storage system (i.e., moving the CDF to the<br>
deleted folder) before the storage system returns an indication to the host that the CDF<br>
has been deleted. However, this additional upfront processing reduces the amount of<br>
processing that must be performed by the garbage collector, as the garbage collector need<br>
not search all of the CDF and blob reference tables to determine which blobs and/or<br>
CDFs were referenced by the deleted CDF, as it can gain that information directly by<br>
examining the contents of the deleted CDF in the deleted folder. As with the fire and<br>
forget technique, there may be a lag time between the host being informed that the CDF<br>
has been deleted and the resulting deletions of a blob referenced thereby, although the<br>
lag time may be less when using the asynchronous technique in view of the fact that less<br>
processing is required of the garbage collector.<br>
A third deletion technique is referred to as synchronous deletion. In synchronous<br>
deletion, in response to a request to delete a CDF, the storage system performs the<br>
following upfront processing functions: (1) removes the CDF's circular reference; (2)<br>
deletes the CDF; (3) removes from the reference table(s) any entries that identified other<br>
blobs or CDFs as referenced by the deleted CDF; and (4) deletes any blobs that are<br>
currently unreferenced by any CDF. It should be appreciated that in accordance this<br>
embodiment of the present invention, a garbage collection routine is unnecessary, as the<br><br>
above-described implementation of the asynchronous deletion technique takes all actions<br>
necessary to achieve deletion, leaving no work for a garbage collection utility.<br>
As compared to the other deletion techniques discussed above, the synchronous<br>
deletion involves relatively more upfront processing by the storage system prior to<br>
instructing the host that the deletion has been accomplished, but does not suffer from the<br>
above-referenced lag in deletion of a blob referenced by the CDF and eliminates the need<br>
for a garbage collection utility. Thus, it should be appreciated that the embodiments of<br>
the present invention described herein are not limited to the use with a garbage collection<br>
utility, as other deletion techniques are possible.<br>
A variant on the synchronous deletion technique is that the first three of the<br>
above-referenced functions can be performed initially, prior to instructing the host that<br>
the CDF has been deleted, and the fourth step (i.e., the removal of any unreferenced<br>
blobs) can be left for a garbage collection utility.<br>
It should be appreciated that the above-described methods of deletion are given<br>
only as examples. Many other methods of deletion may be used, as aspects of the<br>
invention are not limited to the use of any particular deletion techniques.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the storage system provides the host with the<br>
ability to directly delete a blob using a purge command. The purge command allows a<br>
host to delete a blob directly, but only if the blob is not referenced by any CDFs. The<br>
restriction against deleting a blob referenced by a CDF ensures that the retention scheme<br>
of the storage system cannot be bypassed by using the purge command. Unlike the<br>
above methods of deletion in which the content address of a CDF was provided to the<br>
storage system for deletion, the purge command allows the content address of a blob to<br>
be provided directly to the storage system for deletion. By using the purge command, it<br>
is not necessary to wait for a garbage collector to delete the blob, as the blob may be<br>
deleted directly.<br>
As discussed above, one embodiment of the present invention is directed to<br>
storage systems that meet a globally defined standard for retention, an example of which<br>
is SEC Rule 17a-4 mentioned above. Such embodiments can be referred to as defining<br>
compliant systems that comply with externally established retention policies. In one<br>
embodiment of the invention, such compliant storage systems prevent a host, system<br>
administrator or other to modify or act inconsistently with the retention policies<br><br>
administered by the storage system to comply with the globally-defined retention<br>
policies.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to systems that need not<br>
comply with any globally-defined retention policies. Such an embodiment is referred to<br>
as defining non-compliant systems. In one embodiment of the invention, non-compliant<br>
storage systems can provide an interface, in any suitable manner, that allows an<br>
administrator to define whatever user permissions and retention policies are desired. For<br>
example, a set of retention policies may be established, but a user with system<br>
administrative privileges on the host or storage system may be granted authorization to<br>
directly delete units of data in violation of the defined retention policies.<br>
Applicants have appreciated that some populated storage systems may exist with<br>
blobs and associated CDFs that were created without the use of the retention techniques<br>
described therein, such that none of the CDFs will have retention information associated<br>
with them, and that some system users may find it desirable to upgrade such populated<br>
systems to employ the retention techniques described herein. Such an upgrade can be<br>
accomplished in any of numerous ways. For example, any pre-existing CDF without a<br>
retention period can be selected to be expired, to have an infinite retention period, or to<br>
have a retention period defined in any suitable way.<br>
In the above examples, the retention period for a blob was stored in a CDF<br>
associated with the blob. However, it should be appreciated that the retention period<br>
may be stored within the blob itself. Further, the aspects of the present invention<br>
described herein are not limited to use in a system that employs a CDF to store metadata<br>
associated with a blob or blobs, as other techniques (e.g., storing such information within<br>
the blob itself) are possible.<br>
It should be appreciated that the aspects of the present invention discussed above<br>
can be implemented in any of numerous ways. For example, several of the retention<br>
policies described herein are discussed as being implemented by a storage system. These<br>
aspects can be implemented on one or more storage boxes themselves that include<br>
storage devices (e.g., tape drives), or alternatively, can be implemented on a different<br>
box disposed as an interface between one or more hosts and one or more storage systems<br>
on which the data is stored. In this respect, aspects of the present invention can be<br>
implemented on any computer in the system. As used herein, the term computer is<br><br>
intended to cover any device that includes a processor for processing data, and can<br>
include a storage system, a network component, or any other computing device.<br>
The above-described embodiments of the present invention can be implemented<br>
in any of numerous ways. For example, the embodiments may be implemented using<br>
hardware, software or a combination thereof. When implemented in software, the<br>
software code can be executed on any suitable processor or collection of processors,<br>
whether provided in a single computer or distributed among multiple computers. It<br>
should be appreciated that any component or collection of components that perform the<br>
functions described above can be generically considered as one or more controllers that<br>
control the above-discussed functions. The one or more controllers can be implemented<br>
in numerous ways, such as with dedicated hardware, or with general purpose hardware<br>
(e.g., one or more processors) that is programmed using microcode or software to<br>
perform the functions recited above.<br>
In this respect, it should be appreciated that one implementation of the<br>
embodiments of the present invention comprises at least one computer-readable medium<br>
(e.g., a computer memory, a floppy disk, a compact disk, a tape, etc.) encoded with a<br>
computer program (i.e., a plurality of instructions), which, when executed on a processor,<br>
performs the above-discussed functions of the embodiments of the present invention.<br>
The computer-readable medium can be transportable such that the program stored<br>
thereon can be loaded onto any computer system resource to implement the aspects of<br>
the present invention discussed herein. In addition, it should be appreciated that the<br>
reference to a computer program which, when executed, performs the above-discussed<br>
functions, is not limited to an application program running on a host computer. Rather,<br>
the term computer program is used herein in a generic sense to reference any type of<br>
computer code (e.g., software or microcode) that can be employed to program a<br>
processor to implement the above-discussed aspects of the present invention.<br>
It should be appreciated that in accordance with several embodiments of the<br>
present invention wherein processes are implemented in a computer readable medium,<br>
the computer implemented processes may, during the course of their execution, receive<br>
input manually (e.g., from a user).<br>
The phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description<br>
and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of "including," "comprising," or<br><br>
"having," "containing", "involving", and variations thereof herein, is meant to<br>
encompass the items listed thereafter and additional items.<br>
Having described several embodiments of the invention in detail, various<br>
modifications and improvements will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Such<br>
modifications and improvements are intended to be within the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention. Accordingly, the foregoing description is by way of example only, and is not<br>
intended as limiting. The invention is limited only as defined by the following claims<br>
and the equivalents thereto.<br><br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1.	A method of processing data in a computer system comprising at least one<br>
host and at least one storage system, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
(A)	receiving a request, from the host, to delete a unit of content stored<br>
on the storage system, wherein a previously-defined retention period for the unit of<br>
content is stored in the unit of content, wherein the request identifies the unit of<br>
content using a content address generated, at least in part, from at least a portion of<br>
the content of the unit of content, and wherein the at least the portion of the content<br>
of the unit content comprises the previously defined retention period;<br>
(B)	determining whether a previously-defined retention period for the unit<br>
of content has expired;<br>
(C)	when it is determined in the act (B) that the retention period for the<br>
unit of content has not expired, denying the request to delete the unit of content; and<br>
(D)	when it is determined in the act (B) that the retention period for the<br>
unit of content has expired, directly deleting the unit of content in response to the<br>
request.<br><br>
2.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the acts (A), (B) and (C) are<br>
performed by the storage system.<br>
3.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the unit of content comprises<br>
timestamp information identifying when the unit of content was stored to the storage<br>
system, wherein the act (B) comprises examining the timestamp information and<br>
wherein the method comprises an act of sending to the at least one host time<br>
information from a trusted source so that the at least one can use the time<br>
information in creating the timestamp.<br><br><br><br>
ABSTRACT<br><br>
