Finally, it has been found that the novel biphenylcarboxamides of the formula (I) have very good microbicidal properties and can be used for controlling unwanted microorganisms both in crop protection and in the protection of materials.<br>

The active compounds according to the invention also show a strong invigorating action in plants. Accordingly, they are suitable for mobilizing the internal defences of the plant against attack by unwanted microorganisms.<br>
15<br>
In the present context, plant-invigorating (resistance-inducing) compounds are to be understood as meaning substances which are capable of stimulating the defence system of plants such that, when the treated plants are subsequently inoculated with unwanted    microorganisms,    they    display    substantial    resistance    to    these<br>
20	microorganisms.<br>
In the present case, unwanted microorganisms are to be understood as meaning<br>
phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses. The compounds according to the<br>
invention can thus be used to protect plants "within a certain period of time after<br>
25	treatment against attack by the pathogens mentioned. The period of time for which<br>
this protection is achieved generally extends for 1 to 10 days, preferably 1 to 7 days, from the treatment of the plants with the active compounds.<br>
The fact that the active compounds are well tolerated by plants at the concentrations<br>
30	required for controlling plant diseases permits the treatment of above-ground parts of<br>
plants, of propagation stock and seeds, and of the soil.<br><br>
Le A 35 963-Foreign Countries<br><br>
The active compounds according to the invention are also suitable for increasing the yield of crops. In addition, they show reduced toxicity and are well tolerated by plants.<br>
If appropriate, the active compounds according to the invention can, at certain<br>
5	concentrations and application rates, also be employed as herbicides, for regulating<br>
plant growth and for controlling animal pests. If appropriate, they can also be used as intermediates or precursors in the synthesis of other active compounds.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to treat all plants and parts of plants. Plants<br>
10	are to be understood here as meaning all plants and plant populations, such as desired<br>
and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants).<br>
Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and<br>
optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or<br>
combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including plant<br>
15	cultivars which can or cannot be protected by plant breeders' certificates. Parts of<br>
plants are to be understood as meaning all above-ground and below-ground parts and<br>
organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be<br>
mentioned being leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, fruit-bodies, fruits and seeds<br>
and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. Parts of plants also include harvested material<br>
20	and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example seedlings, tubers,<br>
rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.<br>
The treatment of the plants and parts of plants according to the invention with the<br>
active compounds is carried out directly or by action on their environment, habitat or<br>
25	storage area according to customary treatment methods, for example by dipping,<br>
spraying, evaporating, atomizing, broadcasting, brushing-on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, furthermore by one- or multilayer coating.<br>
30	In the protection of materials, the compounds according to the invention can be<br>
employed for protecting industrial materials against infection with, and destruction by, unwanted microorganisms.<br><br>
Le A 35 963-Foreign Countries<br><br>
Industrial materials in the present context are understood as meaning non-living<br>
materials which have been prepared for use in industry. For example, industrial<br>
materials which are intended to be protected by active compounds according to the<br>
invention from microbial change or destruction can be tackifiers, sizes, paper and<br>
5	board, textiles, leather, wood, paints and plastic articles, cooling lubricants and other<br>
materials which can be infected with, or destroyed by, microorganisms. Parts of<br>
production plants, for example cooling-water circuits, which may be impaired by the<br>
proliferation of microorganisms may also be mentioned within the scope of the<br>
materials to be protected. Industrial materials which may be mentioned within the<br>
10	scope of the present invention are preferably tackifiers, sizes, paper and board,<br>
leather, wood, paints, cooling lubricants and heat-transfer liquids, particularly preferably wood.<br>
Microorganisms capable of degrading or changing the industrial materials which may<br>

Depending on their particular physical and/or chemical properties, the active<br>
compounds can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions,<br>
5	emulsions,    suspensions,    powders,    foams,    pastes,    granules,    aerosols    and<br>
microencapsulations in polymeric substances and in coating compositions for seeds, and ULV cool and warm fogging formulations.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the<br>
10	active compounds with extenders, that is liquid solvents, liquefied gases under<br>
pressure, and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam formers. If the extender used is water, it is also possible to employ, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Essentially, suitable liquid solvents are: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or<br>
15	alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such<br>
as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as<br>
20	dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulphoxide, or else water.  Liquefied gaseous<br>
extenders or carriers are to be understood as meaning liquids which are gaseous at standard temperature and under atmospheric pressure, for example aerosol propellants such as halogenated hydrocarbons, or else butane, propane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Suitable solid carriers are: for example ground natural minerals such<br>
25	as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous<br>
earth, and ground synthetic minerals such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates. Suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, or else synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic<br>
30	material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks. Suitable<br>
emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for<br><br>
,   Le A 35 963-Foreign Countries<br><br>
example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, aryl-sulphonates, or else protein hydrolysates. Suitable dispersants are: for example lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
5	Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose, natural and synthetic polymers in the<br>
form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, or else natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Other possible additives are mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
10<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
15<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95 per cent by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compounds  according to  the invention can,  as  such or in their<br>
20	formulations, also be used in a mixture with known fungicides, bactericides,<br>
acaricides, nematicides or insecticides, to broaden, for example, the activity spectrum<br>
or to prevent development of resistance. In many cases, synergistic effects are<br>
obtained, i.e. the activity of the mixture is greater than the activity of the individual<br>
components. 25<br>

and preparations which comprise insecticidally active plant extracts, nematodes, fungi or viruses. 15<br>
A mixture with other known active compounds, such as herbicides, or with fertilizers and growth regulators, safeners and/or semiochemicals is also possible.<br>
In addition, the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention also have<br>
20	very good antimycotic activity. They have a very broad antimycotic activity spectrum<br>
in particular against dermatophytes and yeasts, moulds and diphasic fungi (for<br>
example against Candida species such as Candida albicans, Candida glabrata) and<br>
Epidermophyton floccosum, Aspergillus species such as Aspergillus niger and<br>
Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichophyton species such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes,<br>
25	Microsporon species such as Microsporon canis and audouinii. The list of these fungi<br>
does by no means limit the mycotic spectrum which can be covered, but is only for illustration.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or the<br>
30	use forms prepared therefrom, such as ready-to-use solutions, suspensions, wettable<br>
powders, pastes, soluble powders, dusts and granules. Application is carried out in a<br>
customary manner, for example by watering, spraying, atomizing, broadcasting,<br><br>
,   Le A 35 963-Foreign Countries<br><br>
dusting, foaming, spreading, etc. It is furthermore possible to apply the active compounds by the ultra-low volume method, or to inject the active compound preparation or the active compound itself into the soil. It is also possible to treat the seeds of the plants 5<br>
When using the active compounds according to the invention as fungicides, the<br>
application rates can be varied within a relatively wide range, depending on the kind<br>
of application. For the treatment of parts of plants, the active compound application<br>
rates are generally between 0.1 and 10,000g/ha, preferably between 10 and<br>
10	1000 g/ha. For seed dressing, the active compound application rates are generally<br>
between 0.001 and 50 g per kilogram of seed, preferably between 0.01 and 10 g per kilogram of seed. For the treatment of the soil, the active compound application rates are generally between 0.1 and 10,000 g/ha, preferably between 1 and 5,000 g/ha.<br>
15	As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according<br>
to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants  and plant cultivars obtained by genetic  engineering,  if appropriate in<br>
20	combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts<br>
thereof, are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars which are in each case<br>
25	commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. Plant<br>
cultivars are to be understood as meaning plants having new properties ("traits") and which have been obtained by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They can be cultivars, varieties, bio- or genotypes.<br>
30	Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth<br>
conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example,<br><br>
Le A 35 963-Foreign Countries<br><br>
reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an<br>
increase in the activity of the substances and compositions which can be used<br>
according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low<br>
temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased<br>
5	flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest<br>
yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
10	The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering)<br>
which are preferably to be treated according to the invention include all plants which, in the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased<br>
15	tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance,<br>
easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and<br>
20	microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or<br>
viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus<br>
25	fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes,<br>
cotton, tobacco and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CryIA(a), CryIA(b), CryIA(c), CryIIA,<br>
30	CryIIIA, CryIHB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CryIF and also combinations<br>
thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are also particularly emphasized are the increased defence of the plants against fungi, bacteria and viruses<br><br>
Le A 35 963-Foreign Countries<br><br>
by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and<br>
resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are<br>
furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to<br>
certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas,<br>
5	glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart<br>
the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans),<br>
10	KnockOut® (for example maize),  StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard®<br>
(cotton), Nucoton® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to<br>
15	phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and<br>
STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned also include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars which have these<br>
20	genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, and which will be developed<br>
and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly<br>
advantageous manner with the compounds of the general formula (I) or the active<br>
25	compound mixtures according to the invention. The preferred ranges stated above for<br>
the active compounds or mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the compounds or mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text,<br>
30	The preparation and the use of the active compounds according to the invention is<br>
illustrated by the examples below.<br><br><br>

Preparation examples<br>
Example 1<br><br>
10<br><br><br>
9.77 g of cesium carbonate and 2 ml of water are added to a solution of 3.12 g of N-(2-bromophenyl)-5-fluoro-1,3-dimethyl-lH-pyrazoIe-4-carboxamide and 3.28 g of 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoro-2,3-dihydro-l,4-benzodioxin-6-ylboronic acid (V-l) in 10 ml of n-butanol. With stirring and under an atmosphere of argon, 60 mg of tetrakis-(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) are added. The reaction mixture is stirred at 80°C for 8 h. For work-up, the mixture is poured into water and extracted with ethyl acetate and the extract is dried and concentrated. The residue is chromatographed on silica gel (cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 2:1).<br><br>
This gives 4.00 g (83% of theory) of 5-fluoro-l,3-dimethyl-N-[2-(2,2,3,3-tetrafluoro-<br>
15	2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-6-yl)phenyl]-1 H-pyrazole-4-carboxamide in the form of<br>

After 2 h at 80°C, the mixture is cooled to room temperature, and 0.51 g (1.3 mmol) of N-(2-iodophenyl)-l-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-lH-pyrazol-4-carbox-amide (IV-1), 3.25 ml of a 2 M solution of sodium carbonate and a further 0.05 g (0.07 mmol) of l,r-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocenepalladium(H) chloride are added. After 45 min at 70°C, the mixture is diluted with 5 ml of water and extracted 3 times with in each case 50 ml of ethyl acetate. The extracts are dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product is taken up in diethyl ether and chromatographed on silica gel (cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 3:1).<br><br>
15	This gives 0.23 g (41% of theory) of N-[2-(2,2-difluoro-l,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-<br>

Preparation of starting materials of the formula (V)<br>
Example (V-l)<br><br>
A few grains of iodine are added to a suspension of 4.86 g of magnesium turnings in 20 ml of tetrahydrofuran (anhydrous), and 57.4 g of 6-bromo-2,2,3,3-tetrafluoro-2,3-dihydro-l,4-benzodioxine in 60 ml of tetrahydrofuran are then added dropwise under an atmosphere of argon. By adjusting the rate of the dropwise addition, the<br>
10	exothermic reaction is maintained close to the boiling point. After the dropwise<br>
addition has ended, the mixture is stirred under reflux for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature. The solution of the Grignard reagent is, together with a solution of 29.2 g of triethyl borate in 60 ml of tetrahydrofuran, added dropwise, at -10°C and over a period of 30 min, to 100 ml of tetrahydrofuran. The mixture is then stirred at<br>
15	-10°C for another 1 h and then warmed to room temperature and stirred for another<br>
30 min. For work-up, the reaction solution is, at -10°C, hydrolysed with 14 ml of water and adjusted to pH 4 using 80 ml of 10% strength sulphuric acid. The mixture is extracted with diethyl ether and the aqueous phase is saturated with sodium chloride and extracted with diethyl ether. The combined ether phases are, together<br>
20	with 200 ml of water, concentrated. The solid residue is triturated with a little<br>
methylene chloride, filtered off with suction and dried.<br>
This gives 47.3 g (75% of theory) of 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoro-2,3-dihydro-l,4-benzo-dioxin-6-yl-boronic acid [logP (pH 2.3) = 2.49].<br><br><br>

The logP values given in the Preparation Examples were determined in accordance with EEC Directive 79/831 Annex V.A8 by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) using a reversed-phase column (C 18). Temperature: 43°C.<br>
Mobile phases for the determination in the acidic range: 0.1% aqueous phosphoric acid, acetonitrile; linear gradient from 10% acetonitrile to 90% acetonitrile.<br>
Calibration was carried out using unbranched alkan-2-ones (having 3 to 16 carbon atoms) with known logP values (determination of the logP values by the retention times using linear interpolation between two successive alkanones).<br>
