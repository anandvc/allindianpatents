				<td>Field of invention<br>
The invention relates to a device for providing broadband internet connectivity to the customer, more particularly a 5-port network device that carries customer or user traffic from its access ports towards the network and providing power in network communication links used to couple multiple nodes in a data processing, LAN, MAN etc systems together in a daisy chain arrangement. Prior Art:<br>
Computer and communication technologies continues to advance at a remarkable pace, with numerous improvements being made to the performance of both processors of a computer and the memory which stores the information processed by a computer. These technologies have a significant impact on system performance is the communication between various components in a computer or other data processing system. The communications between components such as processors, memory devices, sets of interconnected processors and memory devices, peripheral devices, and even separate computers, can have a significant effect on the overall performance of a computer system. Moreover, even from the perspective of individual components, and the various sub-components that may be disposed on the same or separate integrated circuit chips, the manner in which data is communicated within a computer system is often a significant contributor to the speed and computing power of the system. The use of point-to-point interconnects, in many applications, provides comparatively greater performance, as well as reduced connection counts and greater flexibility in terms of interconnecting components or nodes coupled to the architecture. Moreover, through the use of redundant connections, greater reliability may be provided, whereby the failure of a<br><br>
connection or a particular node may be overcome by routing data communications around a failed node.<br>
As described above, while some point-to-point architectures rely on complex switching or redundant connections, other point-to-point architectures desirably omit comparable data routing functionality to reduce complexity and cost, and to increase overall performance in some applications. This architecture is referred to as daisy chain architecture, where a sequence of nodes or components are interconnected by means of point-to-point interconnects coupled between adjacent nodes in the system. Often, the point-to-point interconnects comprise pairs of unidirectional interconnects, with one unidirectional interconnect used for communication in one direction between the adjacent nodes, and the other interconnect used to forward data in the opposite direction between the nodes. In such a configuration, the unidirectional interconnects form two unidirectional communication links, ensuring the data can be communicated between any two nodes in the architecture.<br>
Daisy chain architecture is a capability within each node for forwarding data destined for a subsequent node in the architecture to the next adjacent node. In this regard, many daisy chain architectures provide driver circuits that essentially relay or repeat receive signals and forward such signals as necessary to the next node in the architecture.<br>
Additionally, as a practical limitation, the equipment, tools aid techniques required to fabricate and install the types of power supply and communications connectors used in traditional IT networks differ significantly from common practice and skills found in, for example, the construction industry. This mismatch makes the physical installation and maintenance of the network more difficult.<br><br>
Some of the existing 5 port switches in the industry are known to be working with either an external DC Input voltage or with an external AC Input power in which case the unit will have an in built power supply. Some of the existing switches or similar network devices in the industry are known to deliver power in the Ethernet port are capable of delivering much lesser than 30 watts of power on a CAT-5 cable.<br>
The 10/100 Base- T Ethernet traffic can be transmitted on CAT-5 cable only up to a maximum of 100 meters distance. Hence when there is a need for the data to travel more than 100 meters either through a Hub or Layer 2 switch is used. Since the hub or a switch needs external power, it cannot be used in a remote location where there is no power source, if needed separate power cables have to be drawn along with data connectivity links. This is cumbersome and not possible at all locations.<br>
In case of a device, which is capable of providing power on Ethernet cable, those units have very limited power sourcing capability, which can't be used to power more than one user. Also the design is meant for point-to-point application where there will be one master (Power source) and other connected device is a slave (Powered device). With this concept, the Ethernet driving distance again will get limited to radius of 100 meters. Daisy series of devices namely Daisy 105M, Daisy 105MP are used for providing Broadband Ethernet connectivity to the Customer. It is a 5 Port network device that carries customer or user traffic from its Access Ports towards the network. The Customer traffic is propagated towards the network core and Daisy 105 devices are connected in4 daisy-chain' architecture. Such daisy-chained Daisy- 105M series of PoE devices do not need an external Local Power Source. It extracts the power needed for its operation from the CAT5/CAT5e grade Ethernet data cable fed through DC<br><br>
power feeds from the central site. However to extend the number of nodes in the daisy-chain, local power feed option is also provided. The objective of the invention is to develop a managed power over Ethernet switch which<br>
a)	Can function without the need of an external Power source.<br>
b)	Has 5 numbers of 1G/100-Base TX Ethernet port complying IEEE802.3 specifications.<br>
c)	Has one input Ethernet port from which power is derived, one output port on which power is fed to next device and three user ports for data connectivity.<br>
d)	Has one DC Input Terminal block on which power can be fed externally if there is no power available from the predecessor.<br>
e)	Can extend the LAN by more than 100 meters by connecting multiple devices in series (Daisy Chain fashion where output of one device is connected to input of next device).<br>
f)	Allows the user ports to communicate only to the network via input port, thereby denying the user ports from accessing each other.<br>
g)	Can sense a short on the power line and shut OFF the power for safety reason.<br>
h) Can indicate whether it is feeding the power to the next device<br>
i)  Can source 4.0 watts of power on each user ports<br>
j)  Can be managed via central Network management station<br>
k) Can enable or disable user ports, change configuration without<br>
having a local management port on devices 1)  Can enable power to be fed to user ports or not, in addition to<br>
continuous monitoring power<br><br>
m)Can acquire logical address (IP addresses) automatically without the need for manual assigned on individual units Completely   designed   for   compliance   with   DP64   recommendation   for environmental weather proof<br>
Therefore the object of the present invention is to provide Broadband Ethernet connectivity to the Customer using the device Daisy-105. It is a 5 Port network device that transports Traffic from the Access Ports and transmits it out to various users. The Customer traffic is propagated via point to point, linear Topology using Daisy Chain architecture. It is found that Daisy-105 device doesn't need local external Power Source at all locations, as it extracts the power, needed for its operation from the CAT5/CAT5e communication cable.<br>
Some of the existing 5 port switches in the industry are known to be working with either an external DC Input voltage at each location or with a AC Input power in which case the unit will have an in built power supply. Some of the existing switches or similar network devices in the industry are known to deliver power in the Ethernet port are capable of delivering lesser than 12 watts of power on a CAT-5 cable.<br>
The 10/100 B - T Ethernet traffic can be transmitted on CAT-5 cable only up to 100 meters distance. Hence when there is a need for the data to travel more than 100 meters either a Hub or Layer 2 switch has to be used to extend the data further after 100 meters. Since the hub or a switch needs external power, it cannot be used in a remote location where there is no power source. So, it is a need to find out a device  which can derive power from central site and feed it to neighboring daisy-chained devices, without using local external power.<br>
It is found that a device is capable of providing power on Ethernet cable, has a very limited power sourcing or carrying capability, which can only be used<br><br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
A device for providing Broadband Internet connectivity to the Customer is<br>
capable of providing power on Ethernet cable, having a limited power<br><br>
sourcing capability, used to provide power suitable for customer premise equipment and function without the need of an external Power source and extend the LAN by more than 100 meters by connecting multiple devices in series having means to sense the connectivity of the device to ensure the output port is linked to another device in the daisy chain or a standard Ethernet port, shut OFF the power when a short on the power line and indicate whether it is feeding the power to the next device and indicate whether it is receiving power from its previous device. It is a 5 Port network device that transports Traffic from the Access Ports and transmits it out to the network side. The Customer traffic is propagated via point to point linear Topology using 'daisy-chain' architecture.<br>
According to the present invention the device Daisy- 105M is a 5-port Ethernet access Device compliant to IEEE 802.3 standards. Each port supports 10/100Mbps data connectivity over a CAT-5 cable , 3 are for users, one is the input port and the other one is the output port, used to connect the next device. The power and Ethernet data are multiplexed onto the CAT-5 cable by a device called Daisy power Feeder. The first box connected to the feeder is the source of power for the next box. The block diagram of the module is shown in Fig-1.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method to transport data and power on the same cable. According to present invention DC voltage in the range 48 to 60 volt is fed in the unused pairs of CAT-5 cable as shown in<br>
Fig-2.<br>
According to the present invention, the "Power-block" section monitors the current drawn by the devices connected to its output The power filter block is designed to shut off the power if the current drawn from the source exceeds the prescribed limit i.e. not more less than 2 amps.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to separate the power and data from a single cable, send the data to the user and use the remaining power to the next box in the chain Fig - 3.<br>
According to the present invention, the Ethernet data (Transmit and Receive) is transported in 2 pairs of cable whereas the power is transmitted in the remaining pairs. In order to reduce the path resistance, one pair of cable is used for each Positive and Negative terminal of Power supply. According to the present invention, the power extracted from the "IN Port "is used for 2 purposes.<br>
a)	To power the digital section of the board this operates on a very low voltage - 3.3V DC.<br>
b)	To power rest of the devices connected in tile chain, which is achieved by simply bypassing the IN power to OUT port with short-circuit and overload protection.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to ensure that power is shutdown for the next device in the daisy chain if there is a short circuit in the cable. According to the present invention, the sensing circuitry of the power sense and control module will momentarily power the next device and verify if the power drawn exceeds the preset limit. If it senses a healthy condition, it triggers the control module enables the MOSFET and the IN power will be transmitted to the OUT power. The condition of the power is indicated through the LEDs. Fig -4 depicts the Power Sense and control Module block.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to ensure that the devices in the Daisy Chain are sequentially powered. This methodology prevents heavy in rush current on the power source. According to present invention as shown in Fig-5, the first device powers up only if a valid link is present at the input port. Subsequently all other devices checks whether a valid link is present on<br><br>
the out port. Since it takes a finite time for the Ethernet link to come up, the devices will power one after the other.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to ensure that the user port can also be enabled as a powered port. According to the present invention a preset DC voltage that has a preset current driving capacity is coupled to pin no. 7 and pin no. 8 of the user RJ-45 connector. However if the user tries to sink excessive current from this port, the power will be shutdown on the dedicated pins of RJ-45 connector.<br>
The Powered Ethernet switch Daisy- 105M as per the invention does not require a separate local external power source like AC Input or DC Adapter and it can be used to extend 10/100-Base T networks more than 300 meters with user ports powered, or up to 500 meters if user ports are not powered thereby eliminating the need for using expensive Fiber cables and media conversion technology. The proposed switch extracts power from the data cable and provides power to the next switch in the daisy chain. Hie Powered Ethernet device Daisy- 105M can be used to power the devices on the user ports which has a wattage requirement of up to 3.5 to 4 Watts, according to the present invention.<br>
The Powered Ethernet device Daisy-105M is provided with DC input jack who assists in creating more segments of Daisy chain where the power from main source is completely consumed. . Ethernet traffic can be spread out in a wide area by having multiple segments.<br>
Though the present invention was shown and described with references to the preferred embodiments, such are merely illustrative of the present invention and are not to be construed as a limitation thereof and various modifications of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. It is therefore not intended that the present invention be limited to the disclosed embodiments or details thereof, and the present invention includes<br><br>
all variations and/or alternative embodiments within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims. The device is a Power over Ethemet product extending Ethemet connectivity up to 300 meters or up to 500meter$ without power only for user ports.

Managed power over Ethernet Switch unit in a housing wherein Five LED indications are mounted on Top side of the housing to indicate the Link &amp; Activity status of the respective Ethernet ports.<br>
A managed power over Ethernet Switch Daisy-105M in housing is as explained substantially herein before described in Specification and illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Apart from offering data and power on user ports, the entire product is manageable without on-site manual configuration and specific console port or management port, lowering the cost &amp; complexity. Per port-based activation of data and power services, recording of various alarms rose on each port based on network events and storing event log on the NMS lowers down maintenance costs.<br>
Accordingly a device which extracts power from the Ethernet data cable and providing power in network communication links used to couple multiple nodes (linear fashion) for data processing in LAN, MAN and systems connected. The device comprises a housing with rubber gaskets with secured fasteners for preventing unauthorized access to PoE and/or Ethernet ports, a feeder to feed power and data through IN Port to power the digital section of the board and to power the rest of the devices connected in the chain; a<br><br>
power filter to control the power fed into the system; DC Input jack to provide power when required; a selector switch to choose power from adapter or from the DaisyPoE port ; power sense and control Module block; LED indications on the front panel indicate the status of power at the Input and output ports; OUT Port is to connect similar device in a Daisy chain Daisy Management.<br>
The daisy management is accomplished with "Liteview for Daisy 105"application software running on Linux platform. Liteview offers device management features like provisioning, configuration, monitoring &amp; alarm management, it extends support for managing power on all ports of Daisy 105. Device management supports enable/disable auto-negotiation, monitor and manage link, speed &amp; mode of each Ethernet port. Device events and State change(s) of ports, power status are reported to the NMS via a management packet generated from all Daisy 105 devices. Periodic packet generation helps NMS to pop-up alarm status of all ports, and administrative management of devices. The management traffic is isolated from the data flow as they are carried on a specific vLAN. The management packet is a TJDP/IP packet generated at a configurable frequency ranging from 120secs to 300secs (default 120secs). A maximum of 128 bytes sized monitoring packet with UDP source/destination application port of 30000/30001, carry information of various statuses of Daisy device ports including power. On Booting the device, the Daisy 105M units acquire IP address from the DHCP server module bundled with the NMS software package. Remote configuration of these Daisy 105 series devices, are possible through NMS by sending a maximum packet of 128 byte management UDP packets towards the specific Daisy unit with UDP application sourpe/destination ports of 40000/40001. The known ports are to be opened on all network devices in between if firewall security is enabled.<br><br>
Advantages of the Invention<br>
Since the switch does not need any local external power source, it can be<br>
placed anywhere (places where power supply outlets are not available) at<br>
the reach of data cable. So the present invention is highly economical.<br>
If there is a need to extend the reach of Ethernet traffic beyond 100 meters<br>
devices can be simply daisy chained without looking at the availability of a<br>
power point.<br>
Each box consumes certain amount of power for its digital circuitry and<br>
there  is  drop  in voltage  because  of cable resistance  &amp;  in the RJ-45<br>
connectors.<br>
One power source can drive only up to 2 boxes with PoE delivered on all<br>
user ports or upto 5 boxes without power on user ports. A DC Input jack is<br>
provided to every box, so that at the desired location where the power from<br>
main source is completely consumed, an auxiliary power source can be used.<br>
With this feature, number of boxes connected in the chain can go even more<br>
than 25, depending on the Ethernet bandwidth availability.<br>
The ports in the 5 port Ethernet switch are grouped in such a way that the<br>
users can not communicate with each other, but can communicate only with<br>
the Uplink port (i.e IN Port). This ensures Security of user ports in the entire<br>
daisy-chain.<br>
If the cable carrying the power gets shorted accidentally, then the power is<br>
shutdown in Daisy switch, thereby protecting the source which delivers<br>
power.<br>
The LED indications on the front panel/top cover indicate the status of<br>
power at the Input and output ports, to identify link or activity status of ports<br>
to isolate cable problems, if arise.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

e.	a selector switch to choose power from adapter or from the<br>
Input Ethernet port;<br>
f   a power sense and control Module block;<br>
g. 2 LED indicators on the Top to indicate the Input and Output<br>
power condition; h. 5 LED indicators to indicate the Link and activity status of the<br>
Ethernet ports i.   An OUT Port is to connect similar device in a Daisy chain.<br>
2.	A device as claimed in claim 1, having five ports wherein out of<br>
five ports one is the input port which carries data &amp; power from<br>
the preceding Ethernet Powered switch, one is the output port<br>
which transmits power &amp; data to the succeeding Ethemet powered<br>
switch and other 3 ports are user ports which carries Ethernet<br>
traffic to the user port.<br><br>
3.	A device as claimed in claim 1, the power and Ethernet data are multiplexed onto the CAT-5 cable using the power feeder and the first box in the daisy chain is connected to the power feeder is the source of power for the next device in the Daisy chain.<br>
4.	A device as claimed in claim 1, the power filter monitor the current drawn by the devices connected to its output and shut off the power if the current drawn from the source not more than 2 amps.<br>
5.	A device as claimed in claim 1, Ethernet data (Transmit and Receive) is transported in 2 pairs of cable whereas the power is transmitted in the remaining pairs.<br>
6.	A device as claimed in claim 1, the power extracted from the IN Port is used to power the digital section of the board, which operates on a very low voltage - 3.3V DC.<br>
7.	A device as claimed in claim 1, the power extracted from the IN Port is used to power rest of the devices connected in the chain, which is achieved by simply bypassing with adequate protection in the IN power to OUT port.<br>
8.	A device as claimed in claim 1, the power sensing circuit of the power sense and control module will momentarily power the next device and verify whether the power drawn exceeds the preset limit and the OUT Port shuts OFF the power if the port is connected to a standard user port (Non - Daisy) which ensures the safety of a third party device, even it is accidentally connected.<br>
9.	A device as claimed in claim 1, the OUT port that transmits power and data to the succeeding similar device in the Daisy chain.<br>
10.	A device as claimed in claim 1, selector switch is mounted inside the enclosure is used to select DC power source either from the DC Jack or from the 'IN' Ethernet port.<br><br>
11.	A device as claimed in claim 1, DC input jack is housed inside the<br>
enclosure and has a cable entry provision at the bottom of the<br>
housing and assists in creating more segments of Daisy chain<br>
where the power from main source is completely consumed.<br>
12.	A device as claimed in claim 1, Ethernet traffic can be spread out in a wide area by having multiple segments of the device claimed in the daisy chain.<br>
13.	A device as claimed in claim 1, the daisy chain topology of this system is meant for point-to-point application where there will be one master (Power source) and other connected devices as slaves (Powered device).<br>
14.	A device as claimed in claim 1, the first device powers up only if a<br>
valid link is present at the input port wherein all other devices<br>
checks whether a valid link is present on the out port and takes a<br>
finite time for the Ethernet link to come up, the devices will power<br>
One after the other and are sequentially powered which prevents<br>
heavy in rush current on the power source.</td>
