Dye reduction mediator system based on mixed metal complexes<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to mediator systems obtainable by mixing a salt<br>
of an electrochemically active complexing metal (M1) capable of forming a<br>
plurality of valence states with a hydroxyl-containing complexing agent, which<br>
may likewise be present as salt, and with a salt of an electrochemically inactive<br>
complexing metal (M2) in an alkaline aqueous medium, wherefor the molar<br>
ratio of metal ion M2 to metal ion M1 is from 0.8:1 to 2:1.<br>
The invention also provides a process for reducing dyes, a process for dyeing<br>
cellulosic textile material using these mediator systems and cellulosic textile<br>
materials dyed by these processes.<br>
Vat dyes and sulfur dyes are important classes of textile dyes.<br>
Vat dyes are of major significance for dyeing cellulose fibers on account of the<br>
high fastnesses of the dyeings in particular. To use these dyes, the insoluble<br>
oxidized dye has to be converted into its alkali-soluble leuco form by a reducing<br>
step. This reduced form has high affinity for cellulose fiber, goes onto the fiber<br>
and once on the fiber is converted back into its insoluble form by an oxidizing<br>
step.<br>
The class of sulfur dyes is particularly important for the production of<br>
inexpensive dyeings having average fastness requirements. The use of sulfur<br>
dyes likewise involves the need to carry out a reducing step and an oxidizing<br>
step in order that the dye may be fixed on the material.<br>
The literature describes a wide range of reducing agents for use on an<br>
industrial scale, eg. sodium dithionite, organic sulfinic acids, organic hydroxy<br>
compounds such as glucose or hydroxyacetone. In some countries sulfur dyes<br>
are still being reduced using sulfides and polysulfides.<br>
A feature common to these reducing agents is the absence of a suitable way<br>
for regenerating their reducing effect, so that these chemicals are discharged<br>
after use into the wastewater together with the dyebath. As well as the costs for<br>
fresh chemicals to be used, this also creates the additional expense of having<br>
to treat the wastewaters produced.<br>
Further important disadvantages of these reducing agents are the very limited<br>
means to influence their reducing effect or their redox potential under<br>
application conditions in the dyebath and the absence of simple control<br>
technology for regulating the dyebath potential.<br>
A further group of reducing agents was discovered in the class of iron(ll)<br>
complexes. Iron(ll) complexes are known with triethanolamine (WO-A-<br>
90/15182, WO-A-94/23114), with bicine (N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine) (WO-<br>
A-95/07374), with triisopropanolamine (WO-A-96/32445) and also with aliphatic<br>
hydroxy compounds which may contain a plurality of hydroxyt groups and may<br>
additionally be functionalized with aldehyde, keto or carboxyl, such as di- and<br>
polyalcohols, di- and polyhydroxyaldehydes, di- and polyhydroxyketones, di-<br>
and polysaccharides, di- and polyhydroxymono- and -dicarboxylic acids and<br>
also hydroxytricarboxylic acids, preference being given to sugar-based<br>
compounds, especially the acids and salts thereof, eg. gluconic and<br>
heptagluconic acid, and citric acid (DE-A-42 06 929, DE-A-43 20 866, DE-A-<br>
43 20 867, prior German patent application DE-A-199 19 746, unpublished at<br>
the priority date of the present invention, and also WO-A-92/09740).<br>
These iron(ll) complexes have a reducing effect which is sufficient for dye<br>
reduction and which is described by the (negative) redox potential which is<br>
measurable in alkaline solution at a certain molar ratio of iron(ll) : iron(lll).<br>
Numerous of these iron(ll) complexes, eg. the complexes with triethanolamine,<br>
bicine, gluconic acid and heptagluconic acid, also have the advantage of being<br>
electrochemically regenerate and hence of usefulness as mediators in an<br>
\ electrochemical reduction of dyes and also in electrochemical dyeing<br>
processes.<br>
It is further known to use mixtures of these iron complexes as reducing agents.<br>
For instance, textil praxis intemational 40,pages 44-49 (1932) and Journal of<br>
the Society of Dyers and Colourists, 113, pages 135=144 (1997) describe<br>
mixtures of iron salts, triethanolamine and respectively citric acid or gluconic<br>
acid. The latter paper also utilizes as mediators mixtures of iron salts, calcium<br>
salts and gluconic acid and/or heptagluconic acid where the molar ratio of<br>
calcium to iron is in the range from 0.5 to 0.75.<br>
However, the known mediator systems have certain weaknesses. True, the<br>
iron complexes based on triethanolamine or bicine have a sufficiently negative<br>
redox potential for dye reduction, but they are not sufficiently stable in the more<br>
weakly alkaline region at pH 11.5, which greatly limits their electrochemical<br>
regenerability in indigo dyebaths for denim manufacture. True, the mediator<br>
systems based on gluconate or heptagluconate have very good complex<br>
stability in the pH range of 10-12, but the known systems have to have a<br>
relatively large fraction of iron(ll) complex to achieve a redox potential of<br>
 -700 mV (Ag/AgCI, 3 M KCI reference electrode), as is required, for example,<br>
to maintain the requisite bath stability for dyeing with indigo. But the large<br>
fraction of iron(ll) complex required is disadvantageous especialy with regard to<br>
dyeing with indigo in denim manufacture, since the textile material is here dyed<br>
layer by layer by repeated immersion in the dyebath and subsequent air<br>
oxidation of the dye, so that the mediator in the dyebath is completely oxidized<br>
with every air passage and first has to be reduced again for the next dyeing<br>
cycle, and this entails high electricity consumption, which in turn requires high<br>
mediator concentrations or correspondingly large electrolytic cells by way of<br>
compensation.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to remedy the disadvantages mentioned<br>
and to make it possible to reduce dyes in an advantageous, economical<br>
manner. More particularly, stable"mediator systems having a powerful reducing<br>
action shall be provided.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the mediator systems defined at<br>
the beginning.<br>
j<br>
The invention also provides a process for electrochemical reduction of dyes in<br>
an alkaline aqueous medium and also a process for dyeing cellulosic textile<br>
material with vat dyes or sulfur dyes by electrochemical dye reduction in the<br>
presence of metal complexes as mediators, which each comprise using the<br>
mediator systems defined at the beginning.<br>
The invention lastly provides cellulosic textile materials which have been dyed<br>
by this process.<br>
An essential feature of the mediator systems according to the invention is a<br>
combination of the electrochemically active metal ion M1 with an<br>
electrochemically inactive, but likewise complexation-capable metal ion M2 and<br>
with a hydroxyl-containing but amino-devoid complexing agent in a molar ratio<br>
of metal ion M1 to metal ion M2 of from 0.8:1 to 2:1, preferably from 0.9:1 to<br>
1.1:1, particularly preferably about 1:1.<br>
The mediator systems according to the invention are obtainable by mixing the<br>
individual components, which may be used in the form of their water-soluble<br>
salts, in an alkaline aqueous medium, which generally has a pH of about 10-<br>
14. In the course of the mixing, the metal ions M1 and M2 are at least partially<br>
complexed, preferably forming an approximately equimolar complex.<br>
The amount of complexing agent is not critical and has only minor importance<br>
given a predetermined ratio of reduced to oxidized form of the metal ion M1.<br>
The minimum amount of complexing agent normally used will be the amount<br>
theoretically required for completely complexing M1, ie. at least 0.5 mol,<br>
preferably 1 mol per mole of M1. In principle there is no upper limit to this molar<br>
ratio, but cost reasons will generally rule out the use of an amount of more than<br>
5 mol, especially 3 mol, in particular 1.5 mol, of complexing agent per mole of<br>
M1.<br>
The metal ion M1 can be used not only in low-valent form but also in higher-<br>
valent form. For example, in the case of the particularly preferred metal iron,<br>
not only iron(ll) salts may be used but also iron(lll) salts, which are initially<br>
readily reduced to iron(ll) electrochemically.<br>
Useful hydroxyl-containing complexing agents for the purposes of the invention<br>
include in particular aliphatic hydroxy compounds that have at least two<br>
coordination-capable groups and that are likewise soluble in water or aqueous<br>
organic media or miscible with water or aqueous organic media and that may<br>
contain a plurality of hydroxyl groups and/or aldehyde, keto and/or carboxyl<br>
groups. Specific examples of preferred complexing agents are:<br>
di- and polyalcohols such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol,<br>
pentaerythritol, 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-dioxane, especially sugar alcohols<br>
such as glycerol, tetritols such as erythritol, pentitols such as xylitol and<br>
arabitol, hexitols such as mannitol, dulcitol, sorbitol and galactitol;<br>
di- and polyhydroxyaldehydes such as glyceraldehyde, triose reductone,<br>
especially sugars (aldoses) such as mannose, galactose and glucose;<br>
di- and polyhydroxyketones such as, in particular, sugars (ketoses) such<br>
as fructose;<br>
dj- and polysaccharides such as sucrose, maltose, lactose, cellubiose<br>
and molasses;<br>
di- and polyhydroxymonocarboxylic acids such as glyceric acid,<br>
particularly acids derived from sugars, such as gluconic acid,<br>
heptagluconic acid, galactonic acid and ascorbic acid;<br>
 - di- and polyhydroxydicarboxylic acids such as malic acid, particularly<br>
sugar acids such as glucaric acids, mannaric acids and galactaric acid;<br>
hydroxytricarboxylic acids such as citric acid.<br>
Particularly preferred complexing agents are the monocarboxylic acids derived<br>
from sugars (especially gluconic acid and heptagluconic acid) and their salts,<br>
esters and lactones.<br>
It will be appreciated that it is also possible to use mixtures of complexing<br>
agents. A particularly useful example thereof is a mixture of gluconic acid and<br>
heptagluconic acid, preferably in a molar ratio of from 0.1:1 to 10:1, which<br>
provides iron complexes that are particularly stable at high temperatures.<br>
The metal ion M2 is preferably a metal ion which likewise will form stable<br>
complexes with the complexing agent of the invention. Particular preference is<br>
given to divalent metal ions, and calcium ions are very particularly preferred.<br>
In particularly preferred mediator systems according to the invention the metal<br>
ion M1 comprises iron(ll/lll) ions, the metal ion M2 comprises calcium ions and<br>
i the complexing agent is gluconic acid and/or heptagluconic acid.<br>
The particular advantages of the mediator systems according to the invention<br>
are that they have a redox potential 
customary for dye reduction (about 12.5-13.5), but also at a lower<br>
i concentration of low-valent metal ion M1 and hence at a lower concentration of<br>
active complex, but will form a stable complex system even at lower pH values,<br>
ie. at about 11-12, and so are altogether very useful as mediators for<br>
electrochemical dyeing with indigo in particular.<br>
That the redox potential of the electrochemically active complex would so<br>
distinctly shift to what are more negative values in the presence of the<br>
electrochemically inactive metal ion was unexpected. To illustrate this effect,<br>
the redox potentials determined by means of electrochemical conversion trials<br>
for a mediator system of iron, calcium and gluconate ions are reported in what<br>
follows. The respective iron(ll)/iron(lll) ratio was determined photometrically<br>
using 1,10-phenanthroline.<br>
The mediator systems of the invention are very useful for the electrochemical<br>
reduction of dyes.<br>
The process of the invention is particularly important for reducing vat dyes and<br>
sulfur dyes, particularly the class of indigoid dyes, the class of anthraquinonoid<br>
dyes, the class of dyes based on highly fused aromatic ring systems and the<br>
class of sulfur cooking and baking dyes. Examples of vat dyes are indigo and<br>
its bromine derivatives, 5.5-dibromoindigo and 5.5.7.7-tetrabromoindigo, and<br>
thioindigo, acylaminoanthraquinones, anthraquinoneazoles, anthrimides,<br>
anthrimidecarbazoles, phthaloylacridones, benzanthrones and indanthrones<br>
and also pyrenequinones, anthanthrones, pyranthrones, acedianthrones and<br>
perytene derivatives. Examples of particularly important sulfur dyes are C.I.<br>
Sulfur Black 1 and C.I. Leuco Sulfur Black 1 and sulfur vat dyes such as C.I.<br>
Vat Blue 43.<br>
The inventive process for reducing the dye customarily employs the mediator in<br>
an amount not more than approximately that required by the dye reduction<br>
stoichiometry. So one mote of an oxidized dye which takes up two electrons<br>
per molecule to convert into the leuco form generally requires, 2 mol of a<br>
mediator system according to the invention, based on the redox-active metal<br>
ion supplying one electron. It will be appreciated that electrochemical<br>
regeneration of the mediator can reduce this mediator quantity (in the case of<br>
dyeing with vat dyes generally to about 0.1-1 mol of reduced mediator per<br>
mole of dye, based on one liter of dyebath). The greater the deficiency of<br>
mediator system, the higher the requirements the electrolytic cell has to meet.<br>
The reduction process of the invention can advantageously be part of the<br>
similarly inventive process for dyeing cellulosic textile material with vat and<br>
sulfur dyes. Preferably, in this case, the dye is added to the dyebath in<br>
prereduced form, for example in the form of an alkaline solution of catalytically<br>
reduced indigo, and the dye fraction reoxidized by air contact during dyeing is<br>
electrochemically reduced by means of the mediator systems according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The dyeing itself may be carried out as described in the references cited at the<br>
beginning. Any known continuous and batch dyeing methods, for example the<br>
exhaust method and the padding method, may be employed.<br>
Because different dyeing processes and dyeing machines differ in the degree<br>
of air access they allow, there will be some instances where appreciable<br>
quantities of mediator system have to be used to cope with the oxygen from the<br>
air. For instance, exhaust dyeing with vat dyes to medium depths of shade will<br>
impose an additional requirement of about 1-10 mol of reduced mediator per<br>
mole of dye, while continuous dyeing with indigo additionally requires about 2 -<br>
10 mol of reduced mediator per mole of indigo.<br>
The rest of the process conditions, such as type of textile assistants, use<br>
levels, dyeing conditions, type of electrolytic cell and finishing of the dyeings,<br>
can be chosen as customary and as described in the references cited at the<br>
beginning.<br>
The dyeing process of the invention provides advantageous dyeing on all<br>
cellulosic textile materials. Examples are fibers composed of cotton,<br>
regenerated cellulose such as viscose and modal and bast fibers such as flax,<br>
hemp and jute. Useful processing forms include for example staple, tow, yarn,<br>
thread, wovens, loop-drawn knits, loop-formed knits and made-up pieces.<br>
Machine forms can be pack systems, hank, package, warp beam, fabric beam<br>
and piece goods in rope form or open width.<br>
Example<br>
Dyeing with indigo in denim manufacture<br>
250 ends of cotton yam (Nm 11.4, Ne 6.75/1) were dyed with indigo on a<br>
laboratory dyeing range (from Looptex, Lugano, Switzerland) which was<br>
coupled to an electrolytic ceil and is suitable for dyeing cotton yarn by the sheet<br>
dyeing and the rope dyeing process.<br>
The electrolytic cell was a multicathode cell (10 electrodes, 400 cm2 planar<br>
surface area, total surface area 1.9 m2). The anolyte used was 5% by weight<br>
sulfuric acid. Catholyte (dyebath) and anolyte were kept apart by a cation<br>
exchange membrane. The cathode used was a stainless steel mesh, while the<br>
anode used was a titanium electrode coated with platinum mixed oxide.<br>
The dyeing was carried out as follows:<br>
The cotton yam was initially prewetted in a cold wetting agent liquor (3 g/l of a<br>
commercially available wetting agent) and, after squeezing off to 75% wet<br>
pickup, dipped into the hereinbelow-described dyebath (11.251, room<br>
temperature). After a dip time of about 25 sec and squeezing off to 75% wet<br>
pickup, the yam was air oxidized at room temperature for 120 sec. This cycle of<br>
dipping in the dyebath, squeezing off and air oxidization was repeated a<br>
number of times. Thereafter, the dyed yam was rinsed with deionized water<br>
and dried.<br>
The dyebath, which had been adjusted to pH 11.3, had the following<br>
composition:<br>
0.24 mol/l of iron(lll) chloride (40% by weight aqueous solution; 68.5 ml/I)<br>
0.30 mol/l of sodium gluconate (99%; 65.4 g/l)<br>
0.12 mol/l of sodium heptagluconate (22.5% by weight aqueous solution,<br>
115 mi/I)<br>
0.24 mol/l of calcium chloride (78.5% by weight aqueous solution; 29.6 g/l)<br>
1.15 mol/l of aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (50% by weight; about<br>
63 ml/l).<br>
The dyebath was reduced prior to the start of dyeing. After 5 minutes of<br>
electrolysis at 5 A a potential of -700 mV was reached, the cell voltage being<br>
6.6 V. A 20% by weight alkaline aqueous leuco indigo solution (BASF) was<br>
then introduced into the reduced dyebath, which was then used for dyeing.<br>
The following 3 series were dyed with respectively 4, 6 and 8 cycles (3 dyeings<br>
in each case):<br>
1st series:<br>
45 ml of leuco indigo solution (corresponding to 1 g of indigo/I of dyebath), pH<br>
in dyebath 11.35.<br>
2nd series:<br>
90 ml of leuco indigo solution (corresponding to 2 g of indigo/I of dyebath), pH<br>
in dyebath 11.4.<br>
3rd series:<br>
180 ml of leuco indigo solution (corresponding to 4 g of indigo/I of dyebath), pH<br>
in dyebath 12.5.<br>
The dyeings obtained were of outstanding quality, being equivalent in depth of<br>
shade and penetration to standard dyeings with hydrosulfite as reducing agent.<br>
