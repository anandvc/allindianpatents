HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai-400 020, State of Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification describes the nature of this invention (and the manner in which it is to be performed)<br>

FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a class of ligand or complex thereof useful as catalysts for catalytically bleaching substrates with atmospheric oxygen.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The use of bleaching catalysts for stain removal has been developed over recent years.  The recent discovery that some catalysts are capable of bleaching effectively in the absence of an added peroxyl source has recently become the focus of some interest, for example: WO9965905; WO0012667; WO0012808; and, WO0029537.<br>
The search for new classes of compounds that are suitable as air bleaching catalyst is ongoing.<br>
Various [3.3.1] bicyclo compounds and complexes thereof are discussed in the literature, see for example: Comba P. et al., J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans, 1998, (23) 3997-4001; Borzel et al. Chem. Eur. J. 1999, 5, No. 6, 1716 to 1721 and review by P. Comba in Coordination Chemistry Reviews 2000, 200-202, 217 to 245, entitled "Coordination compounds in the Entactic State".  These compounds are discussed in terms of their physical properties.<br>
W00060045 discloses a bleaching" system comprisiring a) from<br>
about Ippb, by weight of a trsnsition metal catalyst comprising: i) a transition metal; ii) a ligand having formula (I) :<br><br><br>
wherein each R is independently hydrogen, hydroxyl, C1-C4 alkyl, and mixtures thereof; Rl is C1-C4 alkyl, C6-C10 aryl, and mixtures thereof; R2 is C1-C4 alkyl, C6-C10 aryl, and mixtures thereof; R3 and R4 are each independently hydrogen, C1-C8 alkyl,. C1-C8 hydroxyalkyl, -(CH2)XC02R5 wherein R5 is C1-C4 alkyl, x is from 0 to 4, and mixtures thereof; X is carbonyl, -C(R6)2- wherein each R6 is independently hydrogen,<br>
hydroxyl, C1-C4 alkyl, and mixtures thereof; b) optionally a source of hydrogen peroxide; and c) the balance carriers and adjunct ingredients.  However, the teaching.of WO0060045 limits substituents at the nitrogens (3 and 7 positions) of bicycioartructure to homoaromatic carbon groups, namely alkyl and aryl.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
We have found that the presence of a group bearing a heteroatom on one or more of the nitrogens of the bicyclostructure provides an enhanced activity.  The compounds provided are surprisingly active as air bleaching catalysts.  In addition, we also found that similar compounds are surprisingly active and provide novel ligands<br><br>
and transition metal complexes thereof for use in air bleaching.<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention provides a bleaching composition comprising:<br>

selected heterocycloalkyl,<br>
a -Cl-C6-alkyl-heterocycloalkyl, wherein the<br>
heterocycloalkyl of the -C1-C6-heterocycloalkyl is selected<br>
from the group consisting of: piperidinyl; piperidine; 1,4-<br>
piperazine,tetrahydrothiophene; tetrahydrofuran;<br>
pyrrolidine? and tetrahydrapyran, wherein the. .<br>
heterocycloalkyl may be connected to the -C1-C6-alkyl via<br>
any atom in the ring of the selected heterocycloalkyl,<br>
a -Cl-C6-alkyl-heteroaryl, wherein the heteroaryl of the -<br>
Cl-C6-alkylheterparyl is selected from the group consisting<br>
Ii<br>

a -C0-C6-alkyl-phenol or thiophenol,<br>
a -C2-C4-alkyl-thiol,.thioether or alcohol,<br>
a -C2-C4-alkyl-amine, and<br>
a -C2-C4-alkyl-carboxylate.<br>
In a second aspect, the present invention provides a bleaching composition comprising, in an aqueous medium, atmospheric oxygen and a bicyclo ligand of the general Formula (I) which forms a complex with a transition metal, the complex catalysing bleaching of a substrate by the atmospheric oxygen, wherein the aqueous medium is substantially devoid of peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or -generating bleach system.  It is preferred that the medium has a pH value in the range from pH 6 to 11 and most preferably from pH 8 to 10.<br>
The present invention also provides novel compounds of the general Formula (I) with the proviso that the following compounds are excluded:<br>
dimethyl 2,4-di-(2-pyridyl) -3,7-bis-(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)-3 , 7-diaza-bicyclo[3 .3 .l]non.an-9-one-l, 5-dicarboxylate,-1,5-bis-(hydroxymethylene) -2,4-di-(2-pyridyl)-3,7-bis-(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-ol; dimethyl 2,4-di-(2-pyridyl)-3,7-bis-(pyridin-2-ylethyl)-3,7-diaza-bicyclo[3.3.1] nonan-9-one-l,5-dicarboxylate; dimethyl 2,4-di-(2-pyridyl) -3-(5-carboxypehtyl)-7-methyl-3,7-diaza-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-one-l, 5-dicarboxylate; dimethyl 2,4-di-(2-pyridyl)-3-(2-methoxyethyl)-7-methyl-3,7-diaza-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-one-l,5-dicarboxylate; diethyl-<br><br><br>

An advantage of the class of ligand and complex according to the present invention is that the complex can catalyse bleaching of a substrate by atmospheric oxygen, thus permitting its use in a medium such as an aqueous medium that is substantially devoid of peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or -generating bleach system.  We have also found that complexes of this class are surprisingly effective in catalysing bleaching of the substrate by atmospheric oxygen after treatment of the substrate. The composition of the present invention bleaches a substrate with at least 10 %, preferably at least 50 % and optimally at least 90 % of any bleaching of the substrate being effected by oxygen sourced from the air.<br>
One skilled in the art will appreciate that not all peroxyl activating catalysts are capable of functioning as an oxygen activation catalyst.  However, the converse is not true. There is no evidence to indicate that any oxygen activation catalyst will not function as peroxyl activating catalyst. In this regard, all oxygen activation catalysts disclosed herein may be used as a peroxyl activating catalyst. Catalysts of the present invention may be incorporated into a composition together with a peroxyl species or source thereof.  For a discussion of acceptable ranges of a peroxyl<br><br><br>
species or source thereof and other adjuvants that may be present the reader is directed to United States Patent 6,022,490, the contents of which are incorporated by reference.<br>
The present invention extends to a method of bleaching a substrate comprising applying to the substrate, in an aqueous medium, the bleaching composition 'according to the present invention.<br>
The present invention extends to a commercial package comprising the bleaching composition according to the present invention together with instructions for its use.<br>
The present invention further provides a dry textile having an organic substance as defined above applied or deposited thereon, whereby bleaching by atmospheric oxygen is catalysed on the textile.<br>
Advantageously, by enabling a bleaching effect even after the textile has been treated, the benefits of bleaching can be prolonged on the textile.  Furthermore, since a bleaching effect is conferred to the textile after the treatment, the treatment itself, such as a laundry wash cycle, may for example be shortened.  Moreover, since a bleaching effect is achieved by atmospheric oxygen after treatment of the textile, hydrogen peroxide or peroxy-based bleach systems can be omitted from the treatment substance.<br>
The organic substance may be contacted to the textile fabric in any suitable manner.  For example, it may be applied in<br><br><br>
dry form, such as in powder form, or in a liquor that is then dried, for example as an aqueous spray-on fabric treatment fluid or a wash liquor for laundry cleaning, or a non-aqueous dry cleaning fluid or spray-on aerosol fluid. Other suitable means of contacting the organic substance to the textile may be used, as further explained below.<br>
Any suitable textile that is susceptible to bleaching or one that one might wish to subject to bleaching may be used. Preferably the textile is a laundry fabric or garment.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the method according to the present invention is carried out on a laundry fabric using an aqueous treatment liquor.  In particular, the treatment may be effected in a wash cycle for cleaning laundry.  More preferably, the treatment is carried out in an aqueous detergent bleach wash liquid.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the treated textile is dried, by allowing it to dry under ambient temperature or at elevated temperatures. The elevated.temperatures, axe commonly, provided by a heated agitated environment, as for example found in a tumble dryer, which has been found to accelerate and enhance the air bleaching effect.<br>
The bleaching method may be carried out by simply leaving the substrate in contact with the organic substance for a sufficient period of time .  Preferably, however, the organic substance is in an aqueous medium, and the aqueous medium on or containing the substrate is agitated.<br><br><br>
The organic substance can be contacted with the textile fabric in any conventional manner. For example it may be applied in dry form, such as in powder form, or in a liquor that is then dried, for example in an aqueous spray-on fabric treatment fluid or a wash liquor for laundry cleaning, or a non-aqueous dry cleaning fluid or spray-on aerosol fluid.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the treated textile is dried, by allowing it to dry under ambient temperature or at elevated temperatures.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment the method according to the present invention is carried out on a laundry fabric using aqueous treatment liquor. In particular the treatment may be effected in, or as an adjunct to, an essentially conventional wash cycle for cleaning laundry. More preferably, the treatment is carried out in an aqueous detergent wash liquor. The organic substance can be delivered into the wash liquor from a powder, granule, pellet, tablet, block, bar or other such solid form. The solid form can comprise a carrier, which can be particulate, sheet-like or comprise a three-dimensional object. The carrier can be dispersible or soluble in the wash liquor or may remain substantially intact. In other embodiments, the organic substance can be delivered into the wash liquor from a paste, gel or liquid concentrate.<br>
It is particularly advantageous that the organic substance used in the method of the present invention makes use of atmospheric oxygen in its bleaching activity. This avoids<br><br><br>
the requirement that peroxygen bleaches and/or other relatively large quantities of reactive substances need be used in the treatment process. Consequently, only a relatively small quantity of bleach active substance need be employed and this allows dosage routes to be exploited that could previously not be used. Thus, while it is preferable to include the organic substance in a composition that is normally used in a washing process, such as a pre-treatment, main-wash, conditioning composition or ironing aid, other means for ensuring that the organic substance is present in the wash liquor may be envisaged.<br>
For example, it is envisaged that the organic substance can be presented in the form of a body from which it is slowly released during the whole or part of the laundry process. Such release can occur over the course of a single wash or over the course of a plurality of washes. In the latter case it is envisaged that the organic substance can be released from a carrier substrate used in association with the wash process, e.g. from a body placed in the dispenser drawer of a washing machine, elsewhere in the delivery. system or in. the drum of the washing machine. When used in the drum of the washing machine the carrier can be freely moving or fixed relative to the drum. Such fixing can be achieved by mechanical means, for example by barbs that interact with the drum wall, or employ other forces, for example a magnetic force.. The modification of a washing machine to â€¢provide for means to hold and retain such a carrier is envisaged similar means being known from the analogous art of- toilet block mapufacture. Freely moving carriers such as shuttles for dosage of surfactant materials and/or other<br><br>
detergent ingredients into the wash can comprise means for the release of the organic substance into the wash.<br>
In the alternative, the organic substance can be presented in the form of a wash additive that preferably is soluble. The additive can take any of the physical forms used for wash additives, including powder, granule, pellet, sheet, tablet, block, bar or other such solid form or take the form of a paste, gel or liquid. Dosage of the additive can be unitary or in a quantity determined by the user. While it is envisaged that such additives can be used in the main washing cycle, the use of them in the conditioning or drying cycle is not hereby excluded.<br>
The present invention is not limited to those circumstances in which a washing machine is employed, but can be applied where washing is performed in some alternative vessel. In these circumstances it is envisaged that the organic substance can be delivered by means of slow release from the bowl, bucket or other vessel which is being employed, or from any implement which is being employed, such as a brush, bat or dolly, or from any suitable applicator.<br>
Suitable pre-treatment means for application of the organic substance to the textile material prior to the main wash include sprays, pens, roller-ball devices, bars, soft solid applicator sticks and impregnated cloths or cloths containing microcapsules. Such means are well known in the analogous art of deodorant application and/or in spot treatment of textiles. Similar means for application are 'employed in those embodiments where the organic substance is<br><br><br>
applied after the main washing and/or conditioning steps have been performed, e.g. prior to or after ironing or drying of the cloth.  For example, the organic substance may be applied using tapes, sheets or sticking plasters coated or impregnated with the substance, or containing microcapsules of the substance.  The organic substance may for example be incorporated into a drier sheet so as to be activated or released during a tumble-drier cycle, or the substance can be provided in an impregnated or microcapsule-containing sheet so as to be delivered to the textile when ironed.<br>
Many transition metal complexes have high extinction coefficients in the visible.  In this regard, use over time may result in some colour deposition on a substrate after repeated washing.  The addition of a limited amount of a peroxyl source serves to reduce colour deposition in those instances in which it occurs whilst still permitting air bleaching.  Nevertheless, we have found that in certain instances the free ligand may be used in the bleaching composition of the. present invention  By using a free ligand, a bleaching formulation may prepared that is consistent with consumer formulation colour expectation. In such a formulation the metal ion may be provided by the composition or by trace metals found in the stain.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The 1igand as described hereih is capable of dynamic<br>
inversion.  The ability.of the ligand to chelate to a TM<br><br>
depends upon the stereochemistry of the substituents.  It is<br>
preferred that subsituents are endo-endo, but it is likely<br><br>
that stereochemical conversion takes place by retro-Mannich conversion.  Retro-Mannich may be prevented by changing the groups present such that retro-Mannich reactions are unfavoured.  Nevertheless, it is likely that endo-exo and exo-exo ligands as described herein coordinate to transition metal ions in many instances and are capable of functioning as air bleaching catalysts.<br>
Referring to ligands and complexes thereof and bleaching compositions derived therefrom with respect to Formula (I), it is preferred that each R is the same; and R3 = R4, and more preferred that R3 and R4 are the same and are -(CH2)nC(0)0-Cl-C4-alkyl.  It is even more preferred that R3 and R4 are selected from the group consisting of -CH20H, -C(0)0-Cl-C6-alkyl, and phenyl.<br>
Referring to X, it is preferred that Y = 1, and most preferred wherein X is C=0.<br>
It is preferred that at least one of Rl and R2 is a 3-C0-C6-alkyl-pyridin-2-yl-C0-C6-alkyl.. It., is most, pxeferred. that at least one of Rl and R2 is selected from the group consisting of: 3-ethyl-pyridin-2-ylmethyl, pyridin-2-ylmethyl, 3-methyl-pyridin-2-ylmethyl, and 6-amide-pyridin-2-ylmethyl, of which pyridin-2-ylmethyl is preferred from this group. It is even more preferred that both Rl and R2 are selected from this group.<br>
The catalyst may be used as a preformed complex of the ligand and a transition metal.  Alternatively, the catalyst may be formed from the free ligand that complexes with a<br><br><br><br><br>
transition metal already present in the water or that complexes with a transition metal present in the substrate. The composition may also be formulated as a composition of the free ligand or a transition metal-substitutable metal-ligand complex, and a source of transition metal, whereby the complex is formed in situ in the medium.<br>
The ligand forms a complex with one or more transition metals, in the latter case for example as a dinuclear complex.  Suitable transition metals include for example: manganese in oxidation states II-V, iron II-V, copper I-III, cobalt I-III, titanium II-IV, tungsten IV-VI, vanadium II-V and molybdenum II-VI.<br>
The ligand forms a complex of the general formula (Al):<br>
[MaLkXn]Ym	(Al)<br>
in which:<br>
M represents a metal selected from Mn(II)-(III)- (IV)-(V)v Cu(I),r(II)-(III), F&amp;(II&gt;--MM-)-(IV)â€”(V&gt;, Co{I&gt;-(II&gt;-(III), Ti(II)-(III)-(IV), V(II)-(III)-(IV)-(V), Mo(II)-(III)-(IV) -(V)-(VI) and W(IV)-(V)-(VI), preferably selected from Pe.(II)-(III)-{lV)-(V) ;<br>
L represents a ligand as herein defined, or its protonated or deprotonated analogue;<br>
X represents a coordinating species selected from any mono, bi or tri charged anions and any neutral molecules able to coordinate the metal in: a mono, bi or tridentate manner, preferably-selected from O2", RB022", RCOO", RCONR", OH", N03", NO, S2", RS", P043\ POJ3OR3", H20, C032", HC03", ROH,<br><br><br><br>
arylalkyl, or alkyl optionally substituted by -F, -Cl, -Br, -I, -NH3\ -SO3H, -S03"(Na+, K+) , -COOH, -COO" (Na+, K*) , -P(0)(OH)2, or -P(O) (0"(Na\ K+))2, and preferably each R independently represents hydrogen, optionally substituted alkyl or optionally substituted aryl, more preferably hydrogen or optionally substituted phenyl, naphthyl or C1-4-alkyl.<br>
The counter ions Y in formula (A1) balance the charge z on the complex formed by the ligand L, metal M and coordinating species X.  Thus, if the charge z is positive, Y may be an anion such as RCOO", BPh4", C10Â«", BF4", PF6", RS03', RS04", S042", N03", F", Cl", Br", or I", with R being hydrogen, optionally substituted alkyl or optionally substituted aryl. If z is negative, Y may be a common cation such as an alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or (alkyl)ammonium cation.<br>
Suitable counter ions Y include those which give rise to the formation of storage-stable solids.  Preferred counter ions for the preferred metal complexes are selected from R7COO", CIO4:, BFV, PF6", RS03: (in- particular CF3SO3-) &gt; RSO", SO62', N03", F", Cl", Br", and I", wherein R represents hydrogen or optionally substituted phenyl, naphthyl or C1-C4 alkyl.<br>
The novel compounds of Formula (I) as provided by the present invention also extend to their various transition metal complexes; the transition metal complexes are as discussed above with reference to (Al) .<br>
It will be appreciated that the complex (Al) can be formed by any appropriate means, including in  situ  formation<br><br><br>
whereby precursors of the complex are transformed into the active complex of general formula (Al) under conditions of storage or use.  Preferably, the complex is formed as a well-defined complex or in a solvent mixture comprising a salt of the metal M and the ligand L or ligand L-generating species.  Alternatively, the catalyst may be formed in  situ from suitable precursors for the complex, for example in a solution or dispersion containing the precursor materials. In one such example, the active catalyst may be formed in situ  in a mixture comprising a salt of the metal M and the ligand L, or a ligand L-generating species, in a suitable solvent.  Thus, for example, if M is iron, an iron salt such as FeSO4 can be mixed in solution with the ligand L, or a ligand L-generating species, to form the active complex. Thus, for example, the composition may formed from a mixture of the ligand L and a metal salt MXn in which preferably n=l-5, more preferably 1-3.  In another such example, the ligand L, or a ligand L-generating species, can be mixed with metal M ions present in the substrate or wash liquor to form the active catalyst in situ.     Suitable ligand L-generating species include metal.-free, casopourvda- 01 rae-tval-Gcoffdina-feion complexes that comprise the ligand L and can be substituted by metal M ions to form the active complex according the formula (Al) .<br>
The catalysts according to the present invention may be used for laundry cleaning, hard surface cleaning (including cleaning of lavatories, kitchen work surfaces, floors, mechanical ware washing etc.). As is generally known in the art, bleaching compositions are also employed in waste-water treatment, pulp bleaching during the manufacture of paper,<br><br><br>
leather manufacture, dye transfer inhibition, food processing, starch bleaching, sterilisation, whitening in oral hygiene preparations and/or contact lens disinfection.<br>
In typical washing compositions the level of the organic substance is such that the in-use level is from 1 to 50mM, with preferred in-use levels for domestic laundry operations falling in the range 10 to 100    Higher levels may be desired and applied in industrial bleaching processes, such as textile and paper pulp bleaching.  These levels reflect the amount of catalyst that may be present in a wash dose of a detergent composition.  The bleaching composition comprises at least 1 ppb of the ligand or complex thereof.<br>
In the context of the present invention, bleaching should be understood as relating generally to the decolourisation of stains or of other materials attached to or associated with a substrate.  However, it is envisaged that the present invention can be applied where a requirement is the removal and/or neutralisation by an oxidative bleaching reaction of malodours or other undesiTable. components  attached. to or otherwise associated with a substrate.  Furthermore, in the context of the present invention bleaching is to be understood as being restricted to any bleaching mechanism or process that does not require the presence of light or activation by light.<br>
Synthesis<br>
In addition to the utility of the ligands and complexes	of<br>
the present invention as catalysts another advantage is	that<br>
 the ligands are generally relatively easy to synthesise	in<br><br>
comparison to other ligands.  The following is one example of a strategic synthetic approach; it will be evident to one skilled in the art of synthetic organic chemistry that many approaches may be taken to obtain ligands and complexes for use in the present invention.  The ease of synthesis of the ligand of Formula (I) is dependent upon the nature of substituents about the structure. The ligands of Formula (I) are most preferably symmetric.  Synthesis of these types of molecules are found in articles by U. Holzgrabe et al. in Arch. Pharm. (Weinheim, Ger.) 1992, 325, 657 and A. Samhammer et al. Arch. Pharm. (Weinheim, Ger.) 1984, 322, 557.  Below is given a schematic example illustrating the ease of synthesis.  The synthesis is shown in a two step synthesis, Scheme 1 and Scheme 2, but in some cases may be conducted as a "one-pot" synthesis depending upon the nature of the substituents.  Nevertheless, where substituents R7 = R8 are different from R3 = R4 a two step synthesis is preferred. The product of reaction as found in Scheme 1 is referred to as dimethyl 2,6-di-(2-pyridyl)-1-methyl-piperid-4-one-3,5-dicarboxylate (NPy2), which can easily tautomerize to the enol. The synthesis, is exempli tied. in.. R.- Ballex, K.W. Merz, Pharm.  Acta Helv.,   1963, 442.<br>

Scheme 2<br><br>
Another important intermediate that may be produced according to the general teachings of Scheme 1 wherein methylamine (CH3NH2) is replaced by 2-aminomethyl-pyridine such that a product referred to as dimethyl 2,6-di-(2-pyridyl)-1-(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)-piperid-4-one-3,5-dicarboxylate  (NPy3) is produced, the structure of which is given below.<br><br>
One skilled in the art will appreciate that whilst Ac [-<br>
CO(0)Me] is an electron withdrawing group and electron<br>
withdrawing groups.are generally preferred to facilitate<br>
synthesis other groups will also allow the reaction to<br>
proceed.  Examples of suitable electron withdrawing groups<br>
are given above and will be evident to one skilled in the<br>
art.  The reaction is also driven by precipitation of the<br>
product from solution.	<br><br><br>
In.instances, depending upon the nature of the substituents, for example a phenolic group, it will be necessary to protect certain functional groups. The choice of protecting groups during synthesis to prevent undesirable reactions will be evident to one skilled in the art. For a discussion of protecting groups in organic synthesis the reader is directed to T. W. Green and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups In Organic Synthesis 3nd Ed.; J. Wiley and Sons, 1999.<br>
It will be evident that if a diamine is substituted for methylamine in the reaction illustrated in Scheme 2 two structures may be linked together via the 7 positions as found in the structure below.<br><br>
In addition, if a diamine is substituted for methylamine in the reaction illustrated in Scheme l a NPy2 structure is formed that is linked at the 3 positions.  Obviously, this dimer would serve as a precursor to other dimer and polymer type structures. The present invention is confined to "monomer" ligands and not the dimer and polymer units linked by a covalent bond as described above.  The term "monomer" as used herein is used to exclude these products in which covalently linked polyligand type structures are formed.<br><br><br>

The Detergent Composition.<br>
The air bleach catalyst and may be used in a detergent composition specifically suited for stain bleaching purposes, and this constitutes a second aspect of the invention. To that extent, the composition comprises a surfactant and optionally other conventional detergent ingredients. The invention in its second aspect provides an enzymatic detergent composition which comprises from 0.1 -50 % by weight, based on the total detergent composition, of one or more surfactants. This surfactant system may in turn comprise 0 - 95 % by weight of one or more anionic surfactants and 5 to 100 % by weight of one or more nonionic surfactants. The surfactant system may additionally contain amphoteric or zwitter ionic detergent compounds, but this in not normally desired owing to their relatively high cost. The enzymatic detergent composition according to the invention will generally be used as a dilution in water of about 0.05 to 2%.<br>
In general, the nonionic and anionic surfactants of the surfactant, system may be chosen from the surfactants' described "Surface Active Agents" Vol. 1, by Schwartz &amp; Perry, Interscience 1949, Vol. 2 by Schwartz, Perry &amp; Berch, Interscience 1958, ih the current edition of "McCutcheon's Emulsifiers and Detergents" published by Manufacturing Confectioners Compandor in "Teryside-Taschenbuch", H.

example, aliphatic alcohols, acids, amides or alkyl phenols with alkylene oxides, especially ethylene oxide either alone or with propylene oxide.. Specific nonionic detergent compounds are C6-C22 alkyl phenol-ethylene oxide condensates, generally 5 to 25 EO, i.e. 5 to 25 units of ethylene oxide per molecule, and the condensation products of aliphatic C8-C18 primary or secondary linear or branched alcohols with ethylene oxide, generally 5 to 40 EO.<br>
Suitable anionic detergent compounds which may be used are usually water-soluble alkali metal salts of organic sulphates and sulphonates having alkyl radicals containing from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms, the term alkyl being used to include the alkyl portion of higher acyl radicals. Examples of suitable synthetic anionic detergent compounds are sodium and potassium alkyl sulphates, especially those obtained by sulphating higher C8-C18 alcohols, produced for example from tallow or coconut oil, sodium and potassium alkyl C9-C20 benzene sulphonates, particularly sodium linear secondary alkyl C10-C15 benzene sulphonates; and sodium alkyl glyceryl ether sulpb.at.es. espaciaLLY. those. ethers, oik the higher alcohols derived from tallow or coconut oil and synthetic alcohols derived from petroleum. The preferred anionic detergent compounds are sodium C11-C15 alkyl benzene sulphonates and sodium C12-C16 alkyl sulphates. Also applicable are surfactants such as those described in EP-A-328 177 (Unilever), which show resistance to salting-out, the alkyl polyglycoside surfactants described in EP-A-070 074, and alkyl monoglycosides.<br><br>
Preferred surfactant systems are mixtures of anionic with nonionic detergent active materials, in particular the groups and examples of anionic and nonionic surfactants pointed out in EP-A-346 995 (Unilever). Especially preferred is surfactant system that is a mixture of an alkali metal salt of a C16-C18 primary alcohol sulphate together with a C12-C15 primary alcohol 3-7 EO ethoxylate.<br>
The nonionic detergent is preferably present in amounts greater than 10%, e.g. 25-90% by weight of the surfactant system. Anionic surfactants can be present for example in amounts in the range from about 5% to about 4 0% by weight of the surfactant system.<br>
The detergent composition may take any suitable physical form, such as a powder, granular composition, tablets, a paste or an anhydrous gel.<br>

Bleaching Experiments<br>
Bleaching results obtained on tomato stains for the different complexes (10 ) or preformed ligand/iron species (by premixing 2 mM ligand/1mM iron perchlorate in ethanol/water (l/l) . The tomato stains were washed with the LAS/buffer system (0.6 g/L NaLAS in 10 mM carbonate buffer)<br><br><br>
for 30 min at 30 Â°C in a bottle containing 25 ml cf the wash solution. After the wash, cloths were washed with water and dried in a tumble drier till dryness.<br>
The reflectance measurements were obtained using: a Minoltaâ„¢ 3700d spectrophotometer at 460 nm. The difference in reflectance before and after the wash is defined as a AR460 value. The bleaching results obtained immediately after drying (t=0) are shown. All values expressed in AAR 460 values (blank, LAS only substracted); typical errors are in the order of 2 points. A higher value means a better bleaching performance.<br>
Table 2: Bleaching results (AAR 460) on tomato oil of the preformed complexes and ligand/iron salt mixtures (active).<br><br>
The results in Table 2 show the. following:<br>
A good bleaching activity is obtained on tomato oil stains with especially the iron complexes containing N2Py3 ligands (u and o) and to a lesser extent the N2py4 ligand/iron<br><br><br><br>
mixture in air bleaching. In all cases the bleaching results are significantly better than the N2py2-containing systems (either Fe complex or ligand/iron salt mixture). It is noteworthy that the ligand in combination with iron salt is effective in air bleaching.<br><br>
