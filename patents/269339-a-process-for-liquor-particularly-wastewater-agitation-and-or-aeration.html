Method for stirring and/or aerating fluids, particularly wastewater,<br>
particularly with a floodable aerator<br>
The present invention relates to a process for liquor, particularly wastewater, agita-<br>
tion, particularly with a floodable immersed aerator and with at least one diffuser dis-<br>
posed on a carrier.<br>
Modern wastewater/sewage plants need to denitrify the wastewater to attain the<br>
specified capped nitrate values. Denitrification - in other words dissociating the oxy-<br>
gen bound to the nitrate to thus liberate the molecular nitrogen - requires several bio-<br>
logical phases by bacteria suitable for the purpose in the anoxic milieu, i.e. in the<br>
absence of dissolved oxygen in the reactor.<br>
Optimizing denitrification requires, for one thing, intensive agitation of the biomass<br>
(bacteria) with the wastewater to increase the interface and accelerate discharge of<br>
the denitrified medium, for another, the existence of degradable carbon compounds.<br>
For, it is the aerobic C degradation that firstly ,,forces" - to put it simply - denitrifica-<br>
tion to fetch the oxygen from the nitrate.<br>
Doing this is currently performed by a variety of phases in processing, all of which,<br>
however, are characterized by the creation of an anoxic milieu. Depending on how<br>
high the concentration is in the nitrogen supply, anoxic volumes as high as 50% of<br>
the total reactor volume are needed and usual.<br>
But wastewater/sewage treatment in general (oxidation of carbon products, oxidation<br>
of the ammonia) always necessitates an oxic milieu in which treatment (degradation<br>
of C and ammonia) is mainly aerobic, whereas in any reactor having a predominantly<br>
oxic milieu denitrification is impossible.<br><br>
This has resulted in a variety of ways of getting round this problem, including, for ex-<br>
ample, simultaneous denitrification, and upstream and downstream denitrification.<br>
In upstream denitrification the return sludge (a mixture of biomass and richly nitrated<br>
wastewater) is separately basined where it is mixed with a highly carbonated flow of<br>
water.<br>
In simultaneous denitrification the phases in the process are performed all at the<br>
same time in a reactor involving separation of oxic/anoxic volumina either spatially<br>
(by zoning the basin by throttling aeration definedly) or in time (cyclic ON/OFF of<br>
aeration), combinations of these phases also being possible.<br>
In downstream denitrification, as the name suggests, denitrification occurs after ac-<br>
tual aeration. All three of these processes have their specific advantages and disad-<br>
vantages, especially downstream denitrification having since become outdated.<br>
In summary it can be said that simultaneous denitrification offers the most benefits,<br>
this prompting the following considerations:<br>
When a basin is aerated, C and ammonia degradation (oxidation) is normal. But<br>
when denitrification is needed at the same time, either the aeration needs to be throt-<br>
tled locally or shut off completely. However, to circulate a certain reactor volume a<br>
critical minimum air feed is needed to keep the balance of the biomass to make deni-<br>
trification possible in the first place and in preventing the plant from become fouled<br>
up.<br>
In other words, when shutting off aeration completely, agitators are needed to agitate<br>
the basin contents to ensure the necessary interfacial mass transfer as is usual in<br>
practice. But if aeration is simply throttled it may happen that the oxygen introduced<br>
is still too high, resulting in no anoxic zones materializing, thus ruining the chances of<br>
effective denitrification being achieved. This is especially the case when the waste-<br>
water feed has a low C concentration, resulting in the air flow needed for circulation<br>
still exceeding the air flow (or oxygen requirement) needed for oxidation by the bac-<br>
teria.<br>
Known from European patent EP 0 249 172 B1 (von Nordenskjold) is a process for<br>
aerating and circulating wastewater and activated sludge for the purpose of nitrifica-<br><br>
tion and denitrification by means of a plurality of diffusers moved over the bottom of<br>
the basin in a cyclic sweeping action. For this purpose certain bottom diffusers are<br>
supplied with a reduced air feed to form slightly aerated zones in the wastewater or<br>
activated sludge to achieve the anoxic conditions in making zoned denitrification<br>
possible.<br>
The drawback of this system is its many components such as squeeze valves sus-<br>
ceptible to failure.<br>
For aerating and agitating wastewater a wealth of different means and processes are<br>
known from prior art.<br>
Known from DE 196 21 116 C2 (Invent) e.g. is a bottom distributor for gas to which<br>
at least one flexible perforated tube can be connected for gas charging, including,<br>
communicatingly connected to a diffuser, a hollow base body provided as a bottom<br>
distributor for the diffuser supply. To maintain such a device operative near to the<br>
bottom, when used in water treatment plants, suitable weights have to be provided to<br>
compensate the flotation tendency caused by the cavities in the bottom distributor.<br>
Known from DE 40 01 201 C1 (von Nordenskjold) is a floating aerator for introducing<br>
air to aerate a body of water in supplying air thereto via connecting lines via bottom<br>
diffusers employed as a so-called immersed aerator. The problem here is that bot-<br>
tom diffusers have a limited lifetime with the nuisance of requiring regular cleaning<br>
maintenance and inspection. This requires, as a rule, the bottom diffusers to be lifted<br>
out of the basin during operation of water or wastewater treatment plant. And, here<br>
again, these regularly require weights to weigh the system to compensate a float<br>
tendency of the bottom diffusers in operation. Lifting a bottom diffuser out of the ba-<br>
sin is not simple, it needing to be lifted to the water surface of an activated sludge<br>
basin of a wastewater treatment plant (for cleaning, inspection, and possibly repair)<br>
and then to be returned in place. All this is highly complicated and costly and even a<br>
hazard for personnel doing the work. Apart from this the corresponding parts of the<br>
floating or bottom diffusers or also immersed aerators are stressed to the extreme.<br>
Especially when the aerators include membranes, damage to these sensitive items<br>
can hardly be avoided.<br>
Known from US 5,906,774 (Parkson) is a surface aerator connected by a rod to a<br>
submerged (immersed) aerator in the region of which additional inflatable buoyant<br><br>
members are arranged to help get round the aforementioned problem of lifting an<br>
immersed aerator to the surface of the water which is a great help in servicing it.<br>
However, this system has the serious drawback that the inflatable buoyant members<br>
add to the components in the vicinity of the immersed aerator which are a nuisance<br>
to handle, both non-inflated and inflated, whilst being prone to damage by becoming<br>
punctured and thus useless.<br>
Surface aerators are employed in the operation of wastewater treatment plants, i.e.<br>
floats to which the surface aerators are attached submerged in the water body. It is<br>
especially in wastewater treatment plants that such devices are used to aerate the<br>
activated sludge basin. Another use serves to oxygenate water bodies. The way<br>
these work, known in principle, involves a pressurized aeration system in which air is<br>
sucked in from the atmosphere by compressors and distributed by a feeding system<br>
to the so-called immersed aerators engineered, as a rule, to discharge the drawn-in<br>
air in fine bubbles which rise to the surface of the water from the immersed aerator,<br>
giving off oxygen to the water on their way. In anaerobic systems these devices are<br>
likewise employed as gas injectors on the same principle, especially for circulation.<br>
As compared to diffuser members secured to the bottom of the basin as in classic<br>
wastewater treatment plants surface aeration has special advantages, this being the<br>
reason why surface aerators have since become very popular.<br>
The increase in the size of individual systems also adds to the number of diffuser<br>
members per system, these very quickly amounting to several thousand such mem-<br>
bers within a system. Known are devices in which so-called diffuser tubes are<br>
grouped together into aerators attached to floating air distribution tubing for sub-<br>
mersed operation at the bottom of the basin. Known diffuser tubes are made of poly-<br>
ester or ceramics and perforated membrane materials which, as a rule, are lifted to<br>
the surface on supporting members. Particularly perforated membrane diffusers<br>
have become popular in recent years since their oxygen exploitation is greatly supe-<br>
rior to that of other diffuser materials. In addition to these, plate aerators find applica-<br>
tion.<br>
The increase in size of such plants has called for ever-larger individual basins and<br>
water depths, nowadays often six meters deep, necessitating grouping together more<br>
and more diffuser tubes to form an aerator assembly. One salient feature of a func-<br>
tionable ,,floating" immersed aerator is that its submersed components have a stable<br>
working depth wo excessive buoyancy which would otherwise render the immersed<br><br>
aerator useless, i.e. becoming unstable, resulting in the diffuser members becoming<br>
partly floated, entangled, and endangering effective aeration, or even bringing the<br>
system to a standstill. In addition to this, it will readily be appreciated that such ran-<br>
dom movements of the diffuser members can be damaging. This is why any opti-<br>
mally designed immersed aerator has just enough dead weight to, on the one hand,<br>
maintain the aerator in stable operation, whilst, on the other, keeping the weight<br>
down sufficiently to assist handling by assembly and operating personnel.<br>
The diffuser assemblies described hitherto are exposed to high wear and tear in op-<br>
eration, they needing to be cleaned regularly and the membranes replaced new after<br>
a certain lifetime. This necessitates lifting the diffuser assembly or immersed aera-<br>
tors to the water surface, done, as a rule, without halting plant operation. Lifting aera-<br>
tors out of the water is a difficult operation prone to damage, usually involving an ex-<br>
perienced crew of workers. A particular nuisance to safe handling is the ..biological"<br>
slime fouling of the many normally submersed surfaces rendering them slippy to<br>
handle. In addition to this, the aerators and their ancillary facilities are often stressed<br>
when lifted out of the water, risking damage such as tube kinking, tube connector<br>
breakage and diffuser membrane rupture. Lengthy handling of individual surface or<br>
immersed aerators poses the particular drawback of the activated sludge in the water<br>
zone worked by a particular immersed aerator becoming imbalanced to negatively<br>
affecting the biological process as a whole.<br>
It is thus an object of the invention to propose a process with which the cited draw-<br>
backs of prior art are avoided or at least greatly reduced, and to propose an im-<br>
mersed aerator which can now be employed to advantage in the proposed process.<br>
This object is achieved by a process for liquor - particularly wastewater - agitation<br>
and/or aeration having the following cyclically repeated steps a) and b):<br>
a)	aerating the liquor by means of an immersed aerator for a predetermined first pe-<br>
riod of time (t1) using a diffuser disposed on a carrier designed as a floodable hollow<br>
body, the hollow body being flooded and air being brought into the liquor by the dif-<br>
fuser, making it possible to create nitrification in the liquor;<br>
b)	agitating the liquor by means of the immersed aerator for a predetermined second<br>
period of time (t2), the air feed by the diffuser being throttled or turned off, and the<br>
previously flooded hollow body being evacuated in order to fill the hollow body with<br><br>
gas or air, the immersed aerator assuming the function of an agitator in which liquor<br>
rises upward, thus agitating the liquor, making denitrification possible in the liquor.<br>
The advantages of the process in accordance with the invention consist inter alia of<br>
aeration, after a certain period of time, now being followed by a period of non-<br>
aeration in which an anoxic zone is created in the corresponding zone of the liquor,<br>
since aeration is totally ceased therein. Instead, an agitation phase is set by the hol-<br>
low body being cyclically flooded and evacuated. It is this cyclic flooding and evacua-<br>
tion of the hollow body which causes the aerator to continually bob up and down,<br>
agitating the liquor.<br>
Any air escaping during this highly agitated agitating of the liquor is immaterial to the<br>
oxygen content of the liquor since, on the one hand, the volume of air involved is<br>
much less than that in normal aeration and, on the other, the escaping air has such<br>
large bubbles that there is hardly any transfer of oxygen, i.e. with no risk of endan-<br>
gering the anoxic phase. As detained above, the person skilled in the art is aware<br>
that anoxic phases need to be present for denitrification, which, however, have to be<br>
replaced by oxic phases to achieve nitrification.<br>
In one advantageous further embodiment of the process the first and second periods<br>
of time (t1, t2) are timed by a controller with the advantage of this now making it pos-<br>
sible to precisely define denitrification to the corresponding load on the liquor.<br>
The object is achieved furthermore by an immersed aerator comprising at least one<br>
diffuser disposed on a carrier, the immersed aerator being characterized by it com-<br>
prising at least one floodable hollow body formed by the carrier. The device in accor-<br>
dance with the invention has numerous benefits. The carrier configured as a flood-<br>
able hollow body to carry the diffuser is of decisive assistance in reducing the buoy-<br>
ancy tendency of the immersed aerator when filled with water in operation, thus do-<br>
ing away with, or at least minimizing, the need for ballast weights to compensate<br>
buoyancy so that the aerator is stationed stabilized, in thus avoiding an excessive<br>
dead weight of the immersed aerator.<br>
In one advantageous aspect of the invention the floodable hollow body is configured<br>
as an elongated tube with the advantage that low-cost standard parts can now be<br>
used in producing the immersed aerator in accordance with the invention.<br><br>
In another advantageous aspect of the invention the immersed aerator carrier con-<br>
figured as a floodable hollow body is configured as a tube of rectangular, round or<br>
elliptic cross-section. Thus now makes it possible to individualize the immersed aera-<br>
tor to preferred diffusers.<br>
In yet another advantageous aspect of the invention the floodable hollow body is<br>
equipped with a compressed air feeder for filling the hollow body with gas or air, this<br>
device making it easy to surface the device in accordance with the invention in the<br>
water simply by feeding the compressed air to remove the water in the floodable hol-<br>
low body, prompting the immersed aerator to surface since the hollow body is no<br>
longer flooded. As an alternative, the compressed air feed can be made by a source<br>
of compressed air on a maintenance boat, by a feeder specifically included for this<br>
purpose in the plant or by making corresponding use of the air for aerating the water.<br>
In still another advantageous aspect of the invention the carrier of the immersed<br>
aerator in accordance with the invention is equipped at least partly with a perforated<br>
membrane enveloping the latter and a means for feeding gas between the carrier<br>
and the membrane. This now makes it possible to advantage to achieve the diffusers<br>
as known substantially from prior art, particularly in combination with the invention by<br>
much simpler means. The carrier configured as an elongated tube forms by its outer<br>
wall a wall of the air feeder of the diffuser, the other wall of which is formed by a per-<br>
forated membrane which except for the pores is sealed off gas-tight from the carrier.<br>
In another advantageous aspect of the invention the hollow body of the immersed<br>
aerator comprises at least one first end part disposed in a first end portion of the hol-<br>
low body with a first passageway for feeding compressed air to the diffuser and a<br>
second passageway for feeding compressed air to fill the hollow body with gas or air.<br>
There is a whole series of methods known from prior art for maintaining air injectors<br>
at a constant level below the water surface. As compared to these, however, the<br>
configuration of the device in accordance with the invention now makes for a design<br>
requiring fewer parts and more friendly installation, all of which makes for enormous<br>
cost savings and saving time both in installing and servicing the immersed aerator.<br>
In another particularly advantageous aspect of the invention the immersed aerator is<br>
characterized by it comprising a second end part with a passageway for feeding the<br>
diffuser with gas or air and an outlet passageway disposed in a second end portion<br>
opposite the first end portion of the hollow body. This now makes it possible to<br><br>
added advantage to increase, e.g. double the air feed in the same time with the<br>
same speed.<br>
In yet another advantageous aspect of the invention the immersed aerator is charac-<br>
terized by it being suspended by at least two suspension devices which now makes it<br>
possible to set it precisely level in harmonizing bubble formation in aeration.<br>
In still a further advantageous aspect of the invention the immersed aerator is char-<br>
acterized by at least one of the suspension devices being configured as a feeder for<br>
the diffuser with the advantage of making for a simplified arrangement whilst reduc-<br>
ing the risk of suspension devices and feeders becoming entangled.<br>
In yet another advantageous aspect of the invention the immersed aerator is charac-<br>
terized by the outlet passageway being disposed near to the bottom of the hollow<br>
body operationally. This facilitates evacuating fluid still therein when evacuating the<br>
immersed aerator to advantage in preventing a short-circuit flow of the evacuating<br>
gas above the bottom of the hollow body.<br>
In a further advantageous aspect of the invention the first passageway of the end<br>
part is provided with non-return valves preventing a liquor flow, for instance of the<br>
wastewater through the first passageway from the hollow body, advantageously mak-<br>
ing sure that no unwanted materials have access to the air feed of the diffuser.<br>
In still another advantageous aspect of the invention the immersed aerator is charac-<br>
terized by a ballast weight enabling the device in accordance with the invention to be<br>
individualized to the necessary conditions or marginal circumstances as dictated by<br>
the wastewater and also by the situation in operating the immersed aerator in each<br>
case.<br>
In another advantageous aspect of the invention the immersed aerator is character-<br>
ized by a hollow body configured as a shallow cylinder whose circumferential wall<br>
forms a hub mounting the spoked arrangement of the diffusers, for example, in the<br>
form of of diffuser tubes and the like. Configuring the immersed aerator in accor-<br>
dance with the invention in this way permits making use of the operating principle in<br>
accordance with the invention also with immersed aerators figured otherwise, espe-<br>
cially including such immersed aerators employed decentralized as single aerators.<br><br>
In yet a further advantageous aspect of the immersed aerator in accordance with the<br>
invention it is again characterized by a hollow body configured as a shallow cylinder<br>
but here with the diffusers topping the cylinder. Here too, the same as in the example<br>
aspect as described before, the device in accordance with the invention can be indi-<br>
vidualized to comply with given, possible already existing systems, now with the spe-<br>
cial advantage afforded by the device in accordance with the invention of, namely, in<br>
surfacing an immersed aerator with no problem.<br>
In still a further advantageous aspect of the invention an immersed aerator is charac-<br>
terized by the floodable hollow body being configured as an elongated tube, from the<br>
outer wall of which diffusers extend substantially perpendicular thereto, here again<br>
with the advantages of the aspects as just described, namely adapting and integrat-<br>
ing the device in accordance with the invention to/in already existing systems or<br>
combining the device in accordance with the invention with the other possible advan-<br>
tages of the variants, hollow bodies and diffusers as already described.<br>
Further features and advantages of the invention read from the sub-claims.<br>
For a better appreciation of the invention it will now be detained by way of a few ex-<br>
amples with reference to the drawing in which:<br>
FIG. 1 is a very simplified diagrammatic view of one example aspect of an immersed<br>
aerator in accordance with the invention shown partially sectioned.<br>
FIG. 2 is a view in perspective of the immersed aerator as shownin FIG. 1.<br>
FIG. 3 is again a very simplified diagrammatic view of another example aspect of the<br>
immersed aerator in accordance with the invention shown in perspective.<br>
FIG. 4 is again a very simplified diagrammatic view of yet another example aspect of<br>
the an immersed aerator in accordance with the invention shown in perspective.<br>
FIG. 5 is a diagrammatic view of the immersed aerator as shown in FIG. 4 shown<br>
sectioned.<br>
FIG. 6 is a view of still another example aspect of an immersed aerator in accor-<br>
dance with the invention.<br><br>
FIG. 7 is a view of a further example aspect of an immersed aerator in accordance<br>
with the invention.<br>
FIG. 8 is a view in perspective of the salient features of the immersed aerator as<br>
shown in FIG. 7.<br>
FIG. 9 is a view of still a further example aspect of an immersed aerator in accor-<br>
dance with the invention.<br>
FIG. 10 is a view of another example aspect of an immersed aerator in accor-<br>
dance with the invention.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1 there is illustrated in a very simplified diagrammatic view an<br>
immersed aerator 4 including a carrier 3 mounting a diffuser 1. The carrier 3 is con-<br>
figured as a floodable hollow body 2 in which the cavity 10 of the floodable hollow<br>
body 2 here and otherwise is depicted cross-hatched for a better appreciation. Via a<br>
gas feeder 6, for example, air is fed in the direction of the arrow L into the immersed<br>
aerator ported via the carrier 3 of the diffuser 1. The path of the air bubbles ascend-<br>
ing from the diffuser 1 to the surface of the water is in the direction of the arrows B.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 2 in additon to FIG. 1 there is illustrated how the carrier 3 con-<br>
figured as a floodable hollow body 2 has the shape of an elongated cube. The sur-<br>
face area depicted cross-hatched in the hollow body 2 can be filled or flooded with<br>
liquor in operation of the immersed aerator, reducing the buoyancy of the immersed<br>
aerator in accordance with the invention to the extent in which the hollow body 2 is<br>
flooded with the intention of maintaining it at a stable level preferably near to the bot-<br>
tom 7 as depicted diagrammatically.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 3 there is illustrated a further example aspect of the invention,<br>
depicting in this case a carrier 13 configured integrated with a shallow cylindrical hol-<br>
low body as a floodable hollow body 12. Mounted on a cross-beam 18, which as<br>
shown in FIG. 3 is carried by the carrier 13 as an air feeder, are diffusers 11 with<br>
conventional diffuser tubes 15 as depicted diagrammatically. The special advantage<br>
afforded by this arrangement is that a single floodable hollow body 12 serves for a<br>
whole battery of diffuser tubes 15. In principle the air feed into the diffusers 11 is the<br>
same as the gas feed as shown in the example aspects of FIG. 1 and FIG. 2. Thus,<br>
each of the diffusers 11 has an air feed in the direction of the arrows L again via a<br><br>
gas feeder 16, here again the direction of the air bubbles ascending from the diffus-<br>
es 11 to the water surface being symbolized in the direction of the arrows B.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 4 there is illustrated another example aspect of an immersed<br>
aerator 24 comprising a central carrier 23 or central hollow body 22 mounting a<br>
spoked arrangement of the diffusers 21 receiving a spoked gas feed via a gas feeder<br>
26. Referring now to FIG. 5 there is illustrated for a better appreciation of the aspect<br>
as shown in perspective in FIG. 4 the diffuser in a diagrammatically sectioned view.<br>
Via the gas feeder 26 air is fed via an air passageway 29 into the diffusers 21 which<br>
ascends to the surface of the water in the direction of the arrows B.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 6 there is illustrated yet another example aspect of the inven-<br>
tion in the form of a spoked arrangement of the immersed aerator 36 in which the<br>
functioning of the various components is in principle the same as already described<br>
with reference to FIGs. 3 and 4. Here too, there is depicted the advantage of the<br>
configuration as shown in FIG. 3 involving a plurality of diffusers in combination with<br>
a single floodable hollow body 32.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 7 there is illustrated still a further example aspect of an im-<br>
mersed aerator 44 in accordance with the invention including a carrier 43 doubling in<br>
function as a hollow body 42. The passageway 46 ports via a coupling (not shown)<br>
into an end part 401 sealing off the left-hand side of the immersed aerator 41 as<br>
shown in FIG. 7 in the interior portion of the carrier 43 also forming the hollow body<br>
42. The end part 401 has a gas feeder passageway 49 via which air is directed<br>
through drillings 402 in the carrier 43 between the outer wall 413 of the carrier 43<br>
and a membrane 403 surrounding the outer wall 413 through which air can escape<br>
via pores 404 to ascend to the surface of the water in the direction of the arrows B.<br>
Clamps 405 clamp the membrane 403 to the outer shell of the carrier 43 respectively<br>
hollow body 42 configured, for example, cylindrical. In the cavity 410 of the hollow<br>
body 42 the floodable portion is depicted cross-hatched. A feeder 406 ports likewise<br>
in the end part 401 into the gas feeder passageway 409 via which the cavity 410 of<br>
the hollow body 42 can be filled with compressed air. The liquor in the cavity 410 is<br>
evacuated via an outlet passageway 411 disposed on the right-hand side of the im-<br>
mersed aerator 41 as shown in FIG. 7 in an end part 412. When compressed air is<br>
directed in the direction of the arrows DL via the feeder 406 and the gas feeder pas-<br>
sageways 409 into the end part 401 in the cavity 410 of the immersed aerator 41, the<br>
liquor in the cavity 410 is evacuated by an outlet passageway 411 evacuating the<br><br>
cavity 410, increasing the buoyancy of the immersed aerator 41 to such an extent<br>
that it ascends to the surface of the water.<br>
By means of this design of the immersed aerator in accordance with the invention by<br>
using compressed air to „pump up" or drain the floodable hollow body it can be<br>
caused to ascend to the surface of the water for maintenance with no problem, after<br>
which the immersed aerator is returned in the water where it automatically becomes<br>
flooded to sink back down to its operating level.<br>
Indicated diagrammatically furthermore in FIG. 7 is the basin bottom 47 in the vicinity<br>
of which the immersed aerator 41 has its operating level. Depending on the thick-<br>
ness 414 and weight of the wall of the hollow body 42 or also the material of the hol-<br>
low body 42 and the volume of the cavity 410 the immersed aerator 41 can be set to<br>
ascend as desired.<br>
Greatly simplified in FIG. 7 is the position of the membrane 403' „in aeration opera-<br>
tion" at the underside of the immersed aerator 41 used to set the compressed air<br>
feed in this situation by reason of the overpressure building up between the outer<br>
wall 413 of the hollow body 42 and the membrane 403. The pores 404 of the elastic<br>
membrane 403 open to release air in the direction of the arrows B from the im-<br>
mersed aerator 41.<br>
Non-return valves 407 and/or 408 are optional on gas feeder passageways 409 and<br>
49 of the end part 401 to prevent a backflow of liquor from the cavity 410 into the gas<br>
feeder passageways 409 and 49 respectively to prevent the corresponding air feed-<br>
ers 406 and 46 from becoming fouled up.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 8 there is illustrated the salient features of the immersed aera-<br>
tor 41 as shown in in FIG. 7 in a view in perspective.<br>
It is understood, of course, that the principle in accordance with the invention can be<br>
used just as well with plate aerators achieved in accordance with the design features<br>
as detained for the example aspect as shown in FIG. 7. Making use of of the principle<br>
of the immersed aerator in accordance with the invention permits a wealth of possi-<br>
ble variants. Thus, it is understood that the invention and the scope of its claims is<br>
not restricted to the aspects shown herein by way of example.<br><br>
Referring now to FIG. 9 there is illustrated how the immersed aerator comprises on<br>
the left-hand side of the drawing a feeder 521 normally directed upwards, for exam-<br>
ple for an air feed (not shown) in the direction of the arrow L. A compressed air<br>
feeder 506 feeds air to the cavity to fill it with gas or air to cause the immersed aera-<br>
tor to ascend and to evacuate the liquor contained therein. Although it is possible to<br>
suspend the immersed aerator by a suspension device 502 shown in bold or broken<br>
lines, it is also just as possible to arrange for the immersed aerator to be carried<br>
solely by the feeder 521 and a suspension device 520 or just by two feeders 521.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 10 there is illustrated still a further immersed aerator - de-<br>
picted halved to save space - which as compared to the immersed aerator as shown<br>
in FIGs. 7 and 8 ends on both sides in a passageway 46 with an air feed L. Outlet<br>
passages for the fluid to be evacuated can be suitably provided at one end, e.g. as<br>
shown in FIGs. 7 and 8 and as described. It is, of course, just as possible to provide<br>
suspension devices (not shown) on this immersed aerator as shown in FIG. 10 as<br>
described before.<br>
Agitation and aeration are alternated as follows:<br>
When after aeration, orchestrated as known, is to be followed by a denitrification<br>
phase, introducing an anoxic phase in a zone to set aeration by the immersed aera-<br>
tor is done by shutting off the air feed via passageways 46, 49 via the feeder(s) 521,<br>
after which the cavity 410 is filled by feeding compressed air via feeders 406 and 409<br>
to evacuate the fluid therein, usually a liquid, such as water or wastewater via the<br>
outlet passageway 411, 511. This causes the immersed aerator to tilt in the direction<br>
of the air feeder on the immersed aerator, to tilt further until it is standing upright on<br>
ascending to the surface of the water. This is the same procedure as performed<br>
while inspecting an immersed aerator. On it surfacing, the compressed air feed is<br>
shut off in the hollow body, resulting in the hollow body being refilled with liquor via<br>
the outlet passageway 411, 511 in thus becoming heavier to sink with reduced buoy-<br>
ancy. Once the immersed aerator has sunk to its lowestmost position as restricted by<br>
the suspension devices, the procedure is repeated, i.e. the cavity 410 again being<br>
evacuated, causing the immersed aerator to re-ascend.<br>
The anoxic phase for denitrification is thus created in accordance with the invention<br>
by alternating flooding and evacuation of the hollow body of the immersed aerator<br><br>
causing it to continuously bob up and down in it thus being changed in function to<br>
that of an agitator.<br>
It is this bobbing up and down action of the immersed aerator, actually functioning as<br>
an agitator, that agitates the liquor, preventing the system from sludging up.<br>
To terminate denitrification this procedure is ceased, the immersed aerator flooded<br>
and recharged with air to aerate the liquor in „down" position of the aerator.<br><br>
