COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (SECTION - 10)<br>
"ACTIVE AND PASSIVE IMMUNISING SUBSTANCES AS A 'VACCINE' AGAINST SYPHILIS, HEPATITIS B AND AIDS PROCESS TO MANUFACTURE THE SAME FROM PARTS OF A COCONUT PALM (COCOS NUCIFERA)."<br>
DR. MADHAV PANDHRINATH KAMATKAR Medha Laboratories &amp; Abhijit Research Foundation 702k, 6k, 3rd lane Shahupuri, Near B.T. College, KOLHAPUR-416002, Maharashtra State, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed: -<br><br>
Present invention relates to active and passive immunizing substances as a 'Vaccine' against Syphilis, Hepatitis B and AIDS and process to manufacture the same from parts of a coconut palm (Cocos nucifera).<br>
Active immunization:<br>
In active acquired immunity the immunological competent cells of the individual have exerted actively in bringing about the state. Recovery from infection - overt or latent is followed by immunity of variable duration lasting for months some years or, as in the case of smallpox disease for the life time. Immunity acquired from natural overt of latent infection is called natural acquired active immunity. At present, artificial acquired active immunity is deliberately induced by:<br>
(a)	Injections of organisms in a living but attenuated form, a form in which the power to kill the host has been totally degraded but the power to stimulate the production of Antibodies or a cellular response has been preserved), as in the BCG vaccine;<br>
(b)	Injections of dead organisms, as exemplified by the TAB vaccine; and<br>
However, the present invention is a preparation from parts of a coconut palm particularty the fluid and solid portion obtained from the fruit, stem or shoots and the like.<br>
Passive immunization:<br>
Passive immunity is given by the transfer of ready-made Antibodies. Thus, Antibodies present in the mother's milk may appear in the blood of the fetus and protect the newborn. The present invention makes use of antibody like material prepared by certain coconut plants particularly fluid and solid portions obtained from the fruit, stem or shoots and the like by oral route.<br>
Present invention particularly relates to identifying a particular coconut tree and parts thereof by conducting several tests and thereafter ascertaining and interpreting the results of the tests such that if the results are positive that particular coconut tree is suitable for adopting and tapping its fluid contents and processing them as per present invention to make 'natural active and passive immunizing substances' (Vaccine) having natural source.<br>
Background:<br>
In the parts of the World where coconut palms grow abundantly and particularly in costal India it is a matter of observation that the population which consumes fair amount of coconut water, soft edible portion of the coconut fruit, is relatively immune to Syphilis, Hepatitis B<br><br>
and also AIDS. This particular property was observed in some coconut trees only and not hundred percent samples did exhibit these attributes. Present invention, therefore, relates to a process to identify such coconut palm trees capable of producing antigens and / or antibodies of VDRL, Hepatitis B, AIDS and other diseases.<br>
Process<br>
To isolate special plant species from ordinary ones by using following procedure:<br>
Step one:-<br>
To make watery, alcoholic glycol and acetone extracts solutions from the parts of<br>
plants having all genetic material &amp; having information of environmental effects<br>
in plants; these are seeds &amp; growing parts of plants.<br>
Step two:-<br>
To measure protein contents from above solutions.<br>
If the protein content is very less it has to be increased between 6 to 8 Gm% by<br>
lyophillasation and reconstituting with smaller quantity of fluid to avoid false<br>
positive reactions.<br>
If the protein content is very high it has to be reduced between 6 to 8 Gm% by<br>
diluting with water to avoid false negative reactions.<br>
Step three:-<br>
To measure pH of above solutions.<br>
If pH is very low it has to be increased between 6 to 8 by using buffers.<br>
If pH is very high it has to be reduced between 6 to 8 by using buffers.<br>
Step four:-<br>
To measure metal content.<br>
If the metal content is high it has to be reduced by chelating agents to avoid<br>
false negative reactions.<br>
Step five:-<br>
At present following procedures are used like latex, Elisa, polymerase chain<br>
reaction, Chemiluminisance, Western &amp; Southern blot, radioimmunoassay to<br>
identify the antigen or antibody like material.<br>
A)	Antigen antibody tests, activated charcoal test, latex test, Elisa<br>
including hybridoma tests.<br>
B)	Chemiluminisance, polymerase chain reaction, Western &amp; Southern<br>
blot test, fluorescent tests.<br>
Group (A) test should be positive and Group (B) test should be negative then that coconut becomes cross-reactive positive.<br>
If the test is positive for the antigen of the virulent organism, the microorganism should be ruled out by doing culture. If microorganism is present the virulence should to be tested and if virulence is absent it is safe to give that material. If organism is not present it is safe to give that material to animal kingdom.<br><br>
According to this invention, therefore, active and passive immunsing substances as a 'Vaccine' against Syphilis, Hepatitis B and AIDS and process to manufacture the same from parts of a coconut palms (Cocos nucifera ) comprises following steps :-<br>
1.	Collection of fluid medium from the coconut tree parts, for example, water content of the fruit, fluid content of the stem as well as from the roots;<br>
2.	Subjecting the fluid contents of immunological tests as such are carried out on human beings;<br>
3.	Ascertaining the cross-reactive antigen or antibody like activity for VDRL, Hepatitis B and AIDS if the results are positive that property is identified as a constant for that particular plants;<br>
4.	Subjecting the fluid part and/or solid part showing positive results to rule out any infestation of other than VDRL, Hepatitis B or AIDS.<br>
5.	Studying under microscopic the part of the fluid extract and solid of the selected coconut fruit to ascertain presence of micro-organism such as Spirochaetes and the like organisms.<br>
6.	The extract contents showing positive results are further isolated to confirm the identity of antigens and antibody like materials from the identified plants. The same is inoculated into experimental animals to identify antibodies from the sera of the said experimental animals.<br>
7.	Human population suffering from these diseases should be free from diseases after consuming these fruits.<br>
Making a Vaccine' from the extract contents of the specific coconut fruit which shows positive results through various steps explained here in before.<br>
According to most salient novel feature of the present invention, the 'Vaccine' is made from natural source such as fluid and solid contents of coconut tree which is selected by undertaking several tests as hereinbefore mentioned. It is a laborious process.   Fruit from each and every tree of the coconut pals is tested and it is observed that per chance a particular tree may show these properties and others not showing these properties will be discarded. There is no surety of percentage of okay trees or non-okay trees.<br><br>
I CLAIM:<br>
1. Active and passive cross reactive immunizing substances as a Vaccine' against Syphilis, Hepatitis B and AIDS and process to manufacture the same from parts of a coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) comprising the following steps :-<br>
1 Collecting of fluid medium from the coconut tree parts, for example, water content of the fruit, fluid content of the stem as well as from the roots;<br>
2.	Subjecting the fluid contents to immunological tests as such are carried out on human beings;<br>
3.	Ascertaining the cross-reactive antigen or antibody like activity for VDRL, Hepatitis B and AIDS if the results are positive that property is identified as a constant for that particular plants;<br>
4.	Subjecting the fluid part and/or solid part showing positive results to microbiological tests such as culture tests to rule out any infestation of other than VDRL, Hepatitis B or AIDS.<br>
5.	Studying under microscopic the part of the fluid extract and solid of the selected coconut fruit to ascertain presence of micro-organisms such as Spirochaetes and the like organisms.<br>
2.      Active and passive cross reactive immunizing substances as a<br>
VACCINE' against Syphilis, Hepatitis B and AIDS, prepared from the extract contents of the specific coconut fruit which shows positive results through various steps as claimed in Claim No. 1 above.<br>
