Description<br>
Device for delivering fuel out of a fuel tank<br>
The invention relates to a device for delivering fuel out of a<br>
fuel tank, comprising a fuel delivery unit, which is arranged<br>
inside a fuel tank and which consists of a swirl pot with a<br>
fuel pump arranged therein for delivering fuel out of the swirl<br>
pot via a feed line to an internal combustion engine, and a<br>
venting system, which is arranged inside the fuel tank and<br>
serves to lead off fuel vapors from the fuel tank, and which<br>
comprises venting lines and a liquid trap for precipitating<br>
fuel, wherein the venting lines are arranged with one end in<br>
the upper area of the fuel tank and with their other end open<br>
out. into the liquid trap, an activated charcoal filter being<br>
arranged downstream of the liquid trap and having a connection<br>
to the atmosphere.<br>
Such a device is disclosed by DE 103 35 62 6 Al. Arranged in a<br>
fuel tank is a swirl pot of a fuel delivery unit, in which a<br>
fuel pump for delivering fuel out of the swirl pot is connected<br>
via a feed line to an internal combustion engine. The device<br>
further comprises a venting system, which is arranged inside<br>
the fuel, tank in order to reduce fuel emissions. The venting<br>
system comprises a bubble extraction vessel acting as liquid<br>
trap, to which venting lines are connected. The bubble<br>
extraction vessel is connected to a flange,<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
so that the venting system is arranged in the upper area of the<br>
fuel tank. Connected to the bubble extraction vessel is a line<br>
18, which leads through the flange and to an activated charcoal<br>
filter situated outside the fuel tank. After treatment in the<br>
activated charcoal filter, the gases from the bubble extraction<br>
vessel are led off to the atmosphere via this line. One<br>
disadvantage of this is the high assembly cost of this device.<br>
For example, the fuel delivery unit has first to be fitted<br>
before the venting system can be fitted in the fuel tank.<br>
Connecting the fuel feed unit to the bubble extraction vessel<br>
proves particularly difficult in this case. Arranging the fuel<br>
del ivory unit and the venting system is also rendered more<br>
difficult by fuel tanks becoming ever shallower.<br>
DE 100 28 985 Al further discloses a fuel delivery and venting<br>
system, i.n which the swirl pot of a fuel delivery unit is<br>
connected to an expansion tank of a venting system. The large<br>
dimensions of the expansion tank mean that this fuel delivery<br>
and venting system has to be fitted at an intermediate stage<br>
during the manufacture of the fuel tank. Fitting the fuel<br>
delivery and venting system into the finished fuel tank is not<br>
possible, since the size and number of openings on the fuel<br>
tank are minimized, because of the fuel emissions associated<br>
with those.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to create a<br>
device of the aforesaid type, which can be fitted even in a<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
finished fuel tank of low overall height. In addition, fitting<br>
is to bo as easy as possible.<br>
The object is achieved in that the liquid trap and the<br>
activated charcoal filter are arranged laterally next to the<br>
swirl pot and on a level with the swirl pot, and that the<br>
.liquid trap, at least, is mechanically connected to the swirl<br>
pot..<br>
Arranging the liquid trap and the activated charcoal filter<br>
laterally next to the swirl pot means that the device according<br>
to the invention does not need any additional overall space<br>
above the swirl pot, so that the device has a low overall<br>
height, making it especially suitable for use in shallow fuel<br>
tanks. The arrangement of the swirl pot, the liquid trap and<br>
the activated charcoal filter permits a modular construction<br>
and hence a wide range of possible adaptations for various<br>
applications. Incorporating the activated charcoal filter into<br>
the device simplifies assembly owing to the modular<br>
construction. No additional attachments of the activated<br>
charcoal filter to the motor vehicle and outside the fuel tank<br>
arc required. In addition, the arrangement of the activated<br>
charcoal filter inside the fuel tank has the advantage that the<br>
emissions caused by the fuel system are thereby reduced, due to<br>
the absence of any connection points outside the fuel tank.<br>
The connection of the liquid trap and/or the activated charcoal<br>
f.i Iter is especially easy to configure if they are connected to<br>
the swirl pot by means of a snap-locking connection. The<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
connection to the swirl pot is easy to make, especially when<br>
fitting the liquid trap and the activated charcoal filter to<br>
the swirl pot inside the fuel tank.<br>
The provision of snap-locking elements on the swirl pot, on the<br>
liquid trap and/or on the activated charcoal filter can be<br>
dispensed with, if the liquid trap and/or the activated<br>
charcoal filter are connected to the swirl pot by a cohesive<br>
material joint, preferably by welding.<br>
Any additional connection of the liquid trap and/or the<br>
activated charcoal filter is avoided, if at least one area for<br>
the liquid trap and/or the activated charcoal filter is<br>
integral ly formed on the swirl pot. Where the swirl pot is<br>
produced by injection molding, the integral connection can<br>
readily be achieved in that at least one area is likewise<br>
produced by injection molding during the manufacture of the<br>
sw i rJ pot.<br>
In another advantageous development the activated charcoal<br>
filter is arranged on the liquid trap. Where the liquid trap<br>
and the activated charcoal filter have a low overall height, it<br>
has proved advantageous to arrange the activated charcoal<br>
filter above the liquid trap. Since the fuel vapors in the<br>
liquid trap collect in the upper area anyway, a costly<br>
connection between the cold trap and the activated charcoal<br>
f.i Iter can be dispensed with. The connection arranged in the<br>
upper area moreover affords a good safeguard against fuel from<br>
the cold trap getting into the activated charcoal filter.<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
In another development a device that can be readily inserted<br>
through an opening in the fuel tank is achieved in that the<br>
liquid trap and/or the activated charcoal filter are arranged<br>
laterally on one side of the swirl pot. In this case the<br>
activated charcoal filter is advantageously arranged on the<br>
side of the liquid trap opposite the swirl pot.<br>
In a i i kewise simple development the liquid trap and the<br>
activated charcoal filter are arranged laterally on different<br>
sides of the swirl pot. The position of the liquid trap and the<br>
activated charcoal filter can here be adjusted within wide<br>
limits to suit the space available in the fuel tank, making the<br>
device according to the invention versatile in use.<br>
In order to make it easy to insert into the fuel tank, on the<br>
one hand, and to give it an adequate filter capacity on the<br>
other, the activated charcoal filter comprises two vessels<br>
connected in series, which are fixed to the swirl pot and/or to<br>
the liquid trap. The two vessels of the activated charcoal<br>
fi I tor may be arranged either on different sides or on one side<br>
of the swirl pot.<br>
Fitting the activated charcoal filter and the liquid trap as<br>
individual sub-assemblies is facilitated if they each have an<br>
open housing sealed by a common cover.<br>
When the activated charcoal filter is arranged next to the<br>
liquid trap, a connection between the activated charcoal filter<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
and the Liquid trap is particularly easy to accomplish if the<br>
common cover has an overflow connection between the activated<br>
charcoal filter and the liquid trap.<br>
In order to prevent fuel getting into the activated charcoal<br>
f:i Iter, should the motor vehicle be in an overturned position,<br>
a roll-over valve is arranged in the connection between the<br>
liquid trap and the activated charcoal filter. The roll-over<br>
valve is easy to fit if it is arranged in the liquid trap.<br>
An especially easy insertion of the device into the fuel tank<br>
is achieved in an arrangement of the activated charcoal filter<br>
and the liquid trap on one side of the swirl pot, if the<br>
activated charcoal filter and the liquid trap have a lower<br>
height than the swirl pot, preferably less than two thirds the<br>
height of the swirl pot.<br>
For leading off fuel that has collected in the liquid trap, the<br>
liquid trap has a drain valve. A reliable draining of the fuel<br>
from the liquid trap is achieved by an active extraction,<br>
preferably by a suction-jet pump assigned to the liquid trap.<br>
The suet ion-jet pump is easy to fit if it is arranged in the<br>
i.j quid trap.<br>
In another development, a reduction in the useable volume of<br>
the liquid trap is avoided in that<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
the suction-jet pump is arranged next to the liquid trap and<br>
the intake aperture of the suction-jet pump is connected to the<br>
liquid trap.<br>
For operation of the suction-jet pump, it has a motive jet<br>
line, which is connected to the feed line of the fuel pump.<br>
The time taken to fit the suction-jet pump can be shortened if<br>
at least a part of the motive jet line is formed by the housing<br>
of. the .liquid trap and/or the activated charcoal filter. The<br>
omission of at least parts of the motive jet line permits more<br>
cost-effective manufacture of the device.<br>
According to a further advantageous development the aggregate<br>
jet of the suction-jet pump opens into the swirl pot.<br>
An especially easy insertion of the device into the fuel tank<br>
is achieved in that the swirl pot is connected by way of at<br>
least one support to a flange for closing an opening in the<br>
fuel tank, the support being pivotally connected to the swirl<br>
pot. The pivotal attachment of the support to the swirl pot<br>
allows simultaneous swiveling of the device from a pivoted<br>
position into the fitted position during the insertion process.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail with reference<br>
to several exemplary embodiments. In the drawings:<br><br>

Fig. 1,<br>
Fig. 6: shows a section C-C from Fig. 5 and<br>
Fig. 7: shows a fourth embodiment of the device in a top view.<br>
A swirl pot 2 with a fuel pump 3 fixed therein is arranged in<br>
the fuel tank 1 represented in Fig. 1. A pump pre-filter 4, via<br>
which the fuel pump 3 draws fuel and delivers it via a feed<br>
line 5 to an internal combustion engine (not shown) of a motor<br>
vehicle, is connected to the inlet side of the fuel pump 3. The<br>
swirl pot is pre-tensioned by two supports 6 against the bottom<br>
of the fuel tank 1. The supports are supported in a flange 7,<br>
which closes an opening 8 in the fuel tank 1.<br>
A Liquid trap 9 is arranged laterally next to the swirl pot 2<br>
and at the bottom of the fuel tank 1. In this schematic<br>
representation, an end 10 of just one venting line 11 opens out<br>
in the upper area of the liquid trap 9, the entire venting<br>
system comprising multiple venting lines. The other end 12 of<br>
the venting line 11 is led into the upper area of the fuel tank<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
1. An activated charcoal filter 13 is fixed to the top of the<br>
liquid trap 9. The liquid trap 9 is connected to the activated<br>
charcoal filter 13 by a connection 14. A line 15 connects the<br>
activated charcoal filter 13 to the atmosphere, the line 15<br>
being led out of the fuel tank 1 through the flange 7. Also<br>
arranged in the liquid trap 9 is a suction-jet pump, which is<br>
driven by way of a motive fluid line 17, which branches off<br>
from the feed line 5. The aggregate jet line 16 connected to<br>
the suction-jet pump 16 opens into the swirl pot 2.<br>
In operation of the device the fuel pump 3 delivers fuel 19 to<br>
the .internal combustion engine via the feed line 5. The fuel<br>
vapor collecting in the upper area of the fuel tank 1 is led<br>
via the venting line 11 into the liquid trap 9. In the liquid<br>
trap 9 fuel which collects in the lower area of the liquid trap<br>
9 is separated off from the fuel vapor. This fuel is extracted<br>
by the suction-jet pump 9 and is led via the aggregate jet line<br>
18 to the swirl pot 2 . The remaining gases flow via the<br>
connection 14 into the activated charcoal filter 13, a roll-<br>
over valve 20 being arranged on the connection 14 in the liquid<br>
trap 9. The gases treated in the activated charcoal filter 13<br>
are then given off to the atmosphere via the line 15.<br>
The section A-A represented in Fig. 2 shows a simplified<br>
representation in top view. The liquid trap 9 is arranged<br>
laterally next to the swirl pot 2. The swirl pot 2 and the<br>
liquid trap 9 are mechanically connected to one another via<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
snap-locking elements 21 formed on the swirl pot 2 and<br>
correspondingly designed snap-locking points 22 on the liquid<br>
trap 9. The liquid trap 9 and the swirl pot 2 can therefore be<br>
inserted in succession through the opening 8 into the fuel tank<br>
1, and then connected together by means of the snap-locking<br>
elemonts 21, 22.<br>
The device according to Fig. 3 substantially corresponds to the<br>
device according to Fig. 1. In contrast to Fig. 1, the<br>
activated charcoal filter 13 has a larger volume, which for<br>
ease of assembly is divided between two vessels 13a, 13b, which<br>
are connected in succession. The two vessels 13a, 13b are<br>
arranged on both sides of the swirl pot 2 and are connected to<br>
a line 23. In the representation shown, the axes of symmetry of<br>
the vessels 13a, 13b and the swirl pot 2 lie in the plane of<br>
projection. However, the vessels 13a, 13b can also be arranged<br>
at an angle of less than 180° to one another on the<br>
circumference of the swirl pot 2, depending on the space<br>
available in the fuel tank 1.<br>
The section B-B in Fig. 4 shows a top view of the device. Snap-<br>
locking elements 21 formed on opposite sides of the swirl pot 2<br>
engage in correspondingly designed snap-locking points 22 on<br>
the vessels 13a, 13b of the activated charcoal filter. Fitting<br>
is likewise relatively simple in that the vessel 13a, for<br>
example, Is first inserted into the fuel tank 1. The swirl pot<br>
2 is then inserted and connected to the vessel 13a. Once the<br>
ha 1 f-assembled device has been pushed to the side, the vessel<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
13b can easily be inserted into the fuel tank 1 through the<br>
opening 8 and connected to the swirl pot 2.<br>
The device in Fig. 5 has a swirl pot 2 of modified construction<br>
compared to the device in Fig. 1. The swirl pot 2, the liquid<br>
trap 9 and the activated charcoal filter 13 are integrally<br>
connected to one another, in that they have a common housing,<br>
which is manufactured by injection molding. The housing has a<br>
lower height in the area of the liquid trap 9 and the activated<br>
charcoal filter 13 than in the area of the swirl pot 2. With<br>
this housing configuration the device can be inserted into the<br>
fuel tank 1 through the opening 8. The liquid trap 9 and the<br>
activated charcoal filter 13 have a common cover 23, which<br>
seals the housing in this area. An overflow connection 14<br>
arranged in the cover 23 connects the liquid trap 9 to the<br>
activated charcoal filter 13. In the housing, a seat 24, into<br>
which the suction-jet pump 16 is inserted, is molded on in the<br>
area of the liquid trap 9. The motive jet line 17 for operation<br>
of the suction-jet pump 16 is likewise inserted into the<br>
housing, so that no additional motive fluid line needs to be<br>
arranged. A connecting line 25 is provided only from the feed<br>
lino 5 to the start of the motive fluid line in the housing.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a top view of the housing of the device in Fig. 5<br>
in the section C-C.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a further embodiment of the device, in which the<br>
supports 6 are pivotally fixed to the housing in the area of<br>
the swirl pot 2. In the representation shown, the supports with<br>
the flange 7 are pivoted by 90° into the plane of projection<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
ready for fitting, so as to facilitate insertion of the device<br>
into the fuel tank 1. As soon as the housing has been inserted<br>
info the fuel tank through the opening 8, the supports 6 with<br>
the flange are swiveled back, so that the device corresponds to<br>
the device shown in Fig. 5. This embodiment does not confine<br>
the provision of the pivotal supports 6 to the housing<br>
configuration shown. The pivotal arrangement of the supports 6<br>
is also possible when vessels are arranged on opposite sides of<br>
the swirl pot 2, as in Fig. 4, it also being possible to<br>
arrange the pivotal support on one of the vessels.<br><br>
