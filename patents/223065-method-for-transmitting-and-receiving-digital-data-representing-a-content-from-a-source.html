				<td>METHOD OF SECURE TRANSMISSION OF DIGITAL DATA FROM A SOURCE<br>
TO A RECEIVER<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates in a general manner to the field of copy protection<br>
of digital data. It is more particularly concerned with a method of transmitting digital data<br>
representing a content from a source to a receiver, in particular in a digital network, making<br>
it possible to prevent copying of these data, or at the very least, rendering any copy<br>
unusable.<br>
Background art<br>
It is known practice to associate with digital data representing a content, in<br>
particular a video or audio sequence, copy control information items commonly denoted<br>
CCI (standing for "Copy Control Information") or else CGMS (standing for "Copy<br>
Generation Management System").<br>
These information items, which are inserted into the data by the content<br>
provider, generally define four possible states for the data:<br>
- copying authorized ("copy free");<br>
- a single generation (or a given number of generations) of copying authorized ("copy once"<br>
or "copy N times");<br>
- no more copying authorized ("copy no more");<br>
- copying never authorized ("copy never").<br>
When the data belong to the last two categories, they may not be copied. That<br>
is to say they may only be viewed and/or listened to, when dealing with video and/or audio<br>
data, for example but they may not be recorded, or if a recording is made illicitly, it must<br>
not be possible to reuse it later.<br>
A first approach for guaranteeing this result consists in having any recording<br>
apparatus verify the aforesaid control data and, should data whose copying is unauthorized<br>
be detected, in disabling the recording.<br>
However, this type of approach has restrictions since it can only operate with<br>
compliant (non "pirated") recording apparatus.<br>
Moreover, another method has been proposed in order that, when data are<br>
broadcast in a digital network such as a domestic digital network, they can only be copied<br>
within the network. To do this, the data which are broadcast in the digital network are<br>
scrambled with control words and these control words are encrypted with the aid of keys<br>
specific to the digital network around which the data flow. Thus, if copies of these data are<br>
made, they can only be played back within the digital network in which they have been<br>
copied. Refer to the French Patent Application of THOMSON multimedia, published as No.<br>
FR-A-2 792 482, for further details with regard to this matter.<br>
However, this method does not allow the complete prevention of copying.<br>
There are in fact cases where content providers desire data to be broadcast in "live" in a<br>
digital network but do not want it to be possible to make copies in order to replay this<br>
content later in the network. A typical example relates to the broadcasting of films by digital<br>
television operators.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
An aim of the invention is therefore to propose a method making it possible to<br>
broadcast a content, in particular in a digital network, without it being possible to copy it.<br>
The invention accordingly relates, according to a first aspect, to a method of<br>
transmitting digital data representing a content from a source to a receiver through a digital<br>
communication channel, the digital data being scrambled by at least one control word. The<br>
method includes the following steps implemented by the source.<br>
The first step consists in generating an ephemeral encryption key stored<br>
temporarily by the source.<br>
The second step consists in encrypting the control word with this ephemeral<br>
encryption key.<br>
The third step consists in transmitting to the receiver:<br>
- the scrambled digital data; and<br>
- the encrypted control word, the latter being transmitted through an encrypted<br>
communication channel between the source and the receiver.<br>
The fourth step consists in responding to an operation of authentication of the<br>
source by the receiver and, when the source is authenticated by the receiver, transmitting<br>
the encryption key to the receiver.<br>
The fifth step consists in erasing the encryption key.<br>
According to a particular characteristic of the invention, a new ephemeral<br>
encryption key is generated randomly by the source for each content transmitted.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, an information item<br>
relating to the period of validity of the digital data to be transmitted is affixed to the data<br>
and the fifth step is performed after the expiry of this period of validity.<br>
According to another particular embodiment, an information item indicating the<br>
number of times the content can be transmitted to a receiver is affixed to the data. This<br>
information item is stored temporarily by the source in a counter of access to the content<br>
and, before the fifth step, the counter of access to the content is decremented; and a test is<br>
performed to verify whether the counter of access to the content is equal to zero. The fifth<br>
step is executed only in the case of a positive response to the test.<br>
According to a particular characteristic of the invention, the method<br>
furthermore includes, before or after the first step, a step consisting in generating an<br>
ephemeral authentication key, the authentication key being transmitted to the receiver, in<br>
the third step, through the encrypted communication channel.<br>
Preferably, a new ephemeral authentication key is generated randomly by the<br>
source for each content transmitted.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, in the fourth step, the<br>
authentication operation comprises the substeps consisting in receiving a random number<br>
from the receiver; performing a calculation on the basis of the random number and of the<br>
authentication key; and transmitting the result of the calculation to the receiver.<br>
According to a particular characteristic of this embodiment, the encryption key<br>
is transmitted to the receiver with the result of the calculation in the third subset above.<br>
According to another particular embodiment of the invention, the encryption<br>
key is transmitted to the receiver, in the fourth step, through the encrypted communication<br>
channel.<br>
The invention also relates, according to a second aspect, to a method of<br>
transmitting digital data representing a content from a source to a receiver through a digital<br>
communication channel, the digital data being scrambled by at least one control word. The<br>
method comprises the following steps implemented by the receiver.<br>
The first step consists in receiving the scrambled digital data.<br>
The second step consists in receiving the encrypted control word encrypted<br>
with an encryption key, the encrypted control word being transmitted through an encrypted<br>
communication channel between the source and the receiver.<br>
The third step consists in performing an operation of authentication of the<br>
source and, when the source is authenticated by the receiver: receiving and temporarily<br>
storing the encryption key; decrypting the control word with the encryption key;<br>
descrambling, with the aid of the decrypted control word, the digital data so as to transform<br>
them into a signal able to be presented to a user; and erasing the encryption key.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, an ephemeral<br>
authentication key is furthermore received in the aforesaid second step, the authentication<br>
key being transmitted through the encrypted communication channel.<br>
According to a particular characteristic of this embodiment, the authentication<br>
operation performed in the aforesaid third step comprises the subsets consisting: in<br>
generating a random number; in sending the random number to the source; in receiving<br>
from the source the result of a calculation performed on the basis of the random number<br>
and of the authentication key; and in verifying the result of the calculation, on the basis of<br>
the random number generated in the first substep and of the authentication key received in<br>
the second step.<br>
According to another particular characteristic of this embodiment, the<br>
encryption key is received by the receiver with the result of the calculation in the third<br>
subset above.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, copy control information items<br>
are fixed to the digital data to be transmitted and the steps of the methods described above<br>
are only implemented when the copy control information items indicate that the digital data<br>
are of "copying unauthorized" type.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the invention, the methods described above<br>
are implemented in a domestic digital network between a device for access to a content and<br>
a device for presentation of the content. The digital communication channel is formed of a<br>
digital bus to which the access device and the presentation device are attached.<br>
Preferably, steps 1 to 5 of the method according to the first aspect of the<br>
invention are implemented in a removable security module attached to the source. Likewise,<br>
steps 1 to 3 of the method according to the second aspect of the invention are implemented<br>
in a removable security module attached to the receiver.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
The invention will be better understood upon reading the following description<br>
of particular, nonlimiting embodiments thereof given with reference to the appended<br>
drawings, in which:<br>
- Fig. 1 diagrammatically illustrates a first embodiment of the invention;<br>
- Fig. 2 is a diagram in the form of functional blocks of a domestic digital<br>
network in which the invention is implemented according to a second embodiment of the<br>
invention;<br>
- Fig. 3 diagrammatically illustrates the form of the data representing a digital<br>
content in the second embodiment of the invention; and<br>
- Fig. 4 illustrates the exchanges involved between elements of Fig. 2 during the<br>
implementation of the second embodiment of the invention.<br>
Description of the preferred embodiments<br>
Fig. 1 diagrammatically represents a source 1 capable of sending digital data<br>
representing a content to a receiver 2. The source 1 is a device, which receives digital data<br>
from a content provider so as to transmit them, through a digital communication channel, to<br>
a receiver device 2 capable of presenting them to an end user.<br>
The method of the invention aims to prevent the illicit copying of data when the<br>
latter travel through the digital communication channel between the source and receiver. It<br>
is aimed more precisely at preventing, should the data be recorded, the possibility of their<br>
being "replayed" by the receiver device so as to be presented to a user.<br>
More specifically, the source 1 is for example a digital decoder receiving digital<br>
television programs from a broadcaster and the receiver 2 is a digital television while the<br>
communication channel is a domestic digital network.<br>
The content is transmitted from the source 1 to the receiver 2 in the form of<br>
scrambled data 3 scrambled by a control word commonly denoted CW. It will be noted that<br>
the data are scrambled either at the level of the source 1, or by the content provider.<br>
To guarantee security of transmission and prevent the data from being recorded<br>
then replayed by the receiver 2, the following measures are adopted.<br>
Firstly, the source 1 generates, for each content transmitted, an ephemeral<br>
encryption key KCW which in the subsequent description will be referred to as the content<br>
key and which is stored temporarily in a memory 7 of the source. This content key KCW is<br>
produced by a pseudo-random number generator located inside the source 1. This generator<br>
is the closest possible approximation to a truly-random number generator ("True Random<br>
Number Generator" as described in "Handbook of applied cryptography, Alfred J.<br>
Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot, Scott A. Vanstone, 1997, pages 165-173") so that the<br>
probability of generating the same content key value twice is very low.<br>
In the same manner the source 1 also generates a secret identifier I for each<br>
content and stores it in its memory 7. This identifier I will subsequently serve to<br>
authenticate the source 1 as will be seen hereinbelow.<br>
The control word CW is then encrypted with the content key KCW. Next, the<br>
encrypted control word Ekcw (CW) 4 as well as the secret identifier I 5 are transmitted<br>
from the source to the receiver through an encrypted communication channel 21.<br>
It will be noted that throughout the description, the following notation is<br>
adopted:<br>
- Ek(M) represents an operation of encrypting data M with a key K irrespective<br>
of the encryption algorithm used;<br>
- Dk(M) represents an operation of decrypting data M with a key K irrespective<br>
of the decryption algorithm used; and<br>
- [ represents a data concatenation operation.<br>
The encrypted communication channel 21 from the source 1 to the receiver 2<br>
can be created, in a manner known per se, by performing symmetric or asymmetric<br>
encryption of the information which travels through this channel.<br>
In a first variant embodiment using symmetric encryption, it is assumed that the<br>
source 1 and the receiver 2 already possess a pre-shared secret key S. The source 1 (but<br>
possibly the receiver 2) randomly generates a session key SSK. The source 1 encrypts SSK<br>
by using its key S and transmits the result Es(SSK) to the receiver 2. The receiver 2<br>
decrypts Es(SSK) by using the preshared secret key S and retrieves SSK. Then, the<br>
encrypted control word Ekcw (CW) 4 and the secret identifier I 5 are encrypted with this<br>
session key SSK at the level of the source 1 before being transmitted to the receiver 2<br>
which decrypts them with the aid of the same session key SSK.<br>
To summarize, the following operations are performed:<br>
- by the source: ESsk (EKcw(CW)|I);<br>
- by the receiver: Dssk(Essk(EKcw(EKcw(CW)|I)) = EKCw(CW)|I.<br>
In a second variant embodiment using asymmetric encryption, it is assumed that<br>
the receiver 2 possesses a private key KprI_r and public key Kpub r pair and that it has<br>
previously transmitted its public key, certified, in a manner known per se, by a certifying<br>
authority, to the source 1.<br>
The source 1 therefore performs the following operation for encrypting the<br>
information to be transmitted (which comprises the encrypted control word 4 and the secret<br>
identifier I 5) with the public key of the receiver Kpub_r:<br>
EKPUB (Ekcw (CW) II)<br>
On receiving these information items, the receiver 2 then performs the inverse<br>
operation for decrypting, with its private key KPRi R, the information items received:<br>
Dkprir(Ekpubr(EkcW(CW)|I))<br>
It will be noted that the transmission 20 of the scrambled data 3 is not<br>
necessarily synchronous with the transmission 21 of the encrypted control word 4 and of<br>
the secret identifier I.<br>
When the receiver 2 has received the scrambled data 3 corresponding to a<br>
content as well as the secret identifier I 5 and the encrypted control word 4 relating to this<br>
content, it stores the identifier I in its memory 8 and it performs an operation 22 for<br>
authenticating the source 1.<br>
This operation, known in the literature and by the person skilled in the art as the<br>
"identification" operation or "entity authentication" operation (see in particular the work<br>
"Handbook of applied cryptography, Alfred J. Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot, Scott A.<br>
Vanstone, 1997, pages 24-25"), is aimed at assuring the receiver 2 that the device which<br>
has just sent it a content is indeed the source 1 and that the latter is active at the time that<br>
the authentication operation takes place.<br>
In practice, the receiver 2 authenticates via a protocol, known to the person<br>
skilled in the art as the "challenge-response protocol", the fact that the source 1 knows the<br>
secret identity I associated with the content received. For example, the receiver 2 sends a<br>
random number n, (also called "challenge") to the source 1 so that the latter performs a<br>
calculation F(I, n;), where F is a function such that it is impossible to calculate F(I, ru),<br>
knowing F, n, and not knowing I. Stated otherwise, only an entity knowing I can calculate<br>
F(I, n). It will in particular be possible to use the function HMAC-SHA-1, described in<br>
particular in "Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication, RFC 2104, February 1997,<br>
Krawczyck et ah", available at the following Internet address: ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-<br>
notesZrfc2104.txt.<br>
The result F(I, rij) is sent to the receiver 2 which can thus verify, by calculating<br>
F(I, n,) at its end and by comparing the result with the value received, that the source 1<br>
knows I and is indeed the entity which sent it the content as well as the information<br>
EKCw(CW)(I.<br>
It will be noted that if an illicit recording of the streams which travel between<br>
the source 1 and the receiver 2 is performed, the apparatus which will perform the<br>
recording will not have access to the secret identifier I (transmitted by the encrypted<br>
communication channel 21) and will therefore be unable to respond correctly to the<br>
authentication operation 22. The receiver will in this case refuse to descramble the<br>
scrambled data 3.<br>
If the source 1 is authenticated by the receiver 2, then the content key KCW 6 is<br>
transmitted to the receiver in step 23 and it is stored temporarily by the latter in its memory<br>
8. The receiver is then able to decrypt the control word CW by performing the following<br>
operation:<br>
Dkcw (Ekcw(CW));<br>
then to descramble the data 3 so as to present them to a user.<br>
Once the content has been presented to the user, the receiver no longer needs<br>
the secret identifier I and the content key KCW and it erases them from its memory 8.<br>
At the level of the source 1, when the content key KCW 6 has been sent to the<br>
receiver 2 (step 23), it is erased from the memory 7 as is the secret identifier I. It is<br>
therefore no longer possible to transmit these items of information for possible subsequent<br>
playback of the data corresponding to the content transmitted.<br>
Thus, the aim of the invention is achieved and the data representing the content<br>
are read only once by the receiver.<br>
As a variant, in order to further increase the security of the method proposed, it<br>
is possible to transmit the content key KCW via the encrypted communication channel 21.<br>
In this case, it will be noted that when the first variant embodiment of the encrypted channel<br>
is used, the session key SSK is stored by the source 1 and by the receiver 2 in their<br>
respective memories 7 and 8 until the content key KCW is transmitted, after which the<br>
session key SSK is erased from the memories of the source and of the receiver.<br>
In the embodiment just described, the content key KCW and the secret identifier<br>
I are erased from the memory 7 as soon as the content has been transmitted from the source<br>
1 to the receiver 2.<br>
However it is also possible, in a preferred variant of this embodiment, for the<br>
content to have a period of validity during which it can be transmitted to the receiver or for<br>
it to be possibly transmitted a specified number of times from the source to the receiver.<br>
In the case where the content has a certain period of validity, the information<br>
item relating to this period of validity is affixed to the data representing the content and this<br>
information item is stored by the source 1 at the same time as the content key KCW and the<br>
identifier I. Next, when the key KCW 6 has been sent by the source 1 to the receiver 2 in<br>
step 23, a check verifies whether the period of validity of the corresponding content has or<br>
has not expired (for example by comparing this period with an internal clock of the source)<br>
and, only in the case where the period of validity has expired, the key KCW and the<br>
identifier I are erased from the memory 7 of the source. It will also be noted that when the<br>
first variant embodiment of the encrypted channel is used, the session key SSK is stored by<br>
the source 1 and by the receiver 2 in their respective memories 7 and 8 until the period of<br>
validity of the content has expired.<br>
In the case where the content can be transmitted a specified number of times to<br>
the receiver, this number is affixed to the data representing the content and is stored by the<br>
source 1 in a counter, at the time that the key KCW and the identifier I are stored in the<br>
memory 7 of the source. This counter will then be decremented each time the key KCW is<br>
sent (step 23) to the receiver 2. When the counter is at zero, the key KCW and the identifier<br>
I are erased from the memory 7 of the source. Moreover, as above, when the first variant<br>
embodiment of the encrypted channel is used, the session key SSK is stored by the source 1<br>
and by the receiver 2 in their respective memories 7 and 8 until the aforesaid counter is<br>
equal to zero.<br>
We shall now describe, in conjunction with Fig. 2 to 4, a second embodiment of<br>
the invention.<br>
Represented in Fig. 2 is a domestic digital network containing an access device<br>
10 linked by a bidirectional digital bus 40, preferably a bus according to the IEEE 1394<br>
standard, on the one hand to a presentation device 12 and on the other hand to a digital<br>
recording device 13.<br>
The access device 10 constitutes the source of the data in the network or the<br>
point of entry of any content 30 to the network. It is for example a digital decoder which<br>
receives digital data broadcast by satellite, over the airwaves (or terrestrially) or by cable. It<br>
may also be an optical disc reading apparatus broadcasting over the digital network data<br>
read from a disc, in particular a DVD (standing for "Digital Versatile Disc"). It may also be<br>
an apparatus adapted to receive data from the Internet by real-time downloading (also<br>
known as "streaming"), that is to say while viewing the content as and when loaded.<br>
Naturally, even if just one access device is represented in Fig. 2, a domestic<br>
digital network can contain several devices of this type which each constitute sources<br>
broadcasting digital contents over the bus 40.<br>
The presentation device 12 makes it possible to transform the digital data<br>
received from the bus 40 into a signal representative of the content intended to be presented<br>
to an end user. It is for example a digital television or a loudspeaker.<br>
The digital recording device 13 is, for its part, capable of recording the data<br>
streams which flow around the bus 40 so as to replay them subsequently. It is for example a<br>
digital video recorder, a hard disk type storage device or an apparatus capable of recording<br>
optical discs of the DVD type.<br>
Naturally, the domestic digital network can also contain several presentation<br>
devices as well as several recording devices.<br>
Moreover, even if the three types of devices mentioned above have been<br>
represented separately, it is entirely possible for one and the same apparatus to contain two<br>
types of devices, or even three. For example, a digital television can contain a built-in<br>
decoder able to directly receive a content from outside the network. In this case, the<br>
invention will apply in the same way except that the digital data will travel via an internal<br>
bus to the apparatus (between the part of the apparatus constituting the access device and<br>
the part constituting the presentation device) instead of travelling via the bus 40.<br>
Preferably, the access device 10 and the presentation device 12 each possess a<br>
smart card reader adapted to receive a card 14 and a card 15 respectively. Each of the smart<br>
cards 14, 15 includes a secure processor which, as is well known to the person skilled in the<br>
art, allows secure storage of data such as cryptographic keys. The usefulness of the smart<br>
cards 14 and 15 will be explained subsequently.<br>
The content 30 which is received by the access device 10 preferably consists of<br>
packets of digital data scrambled by control words denoted CW as is commonly used in the<br>
broadcasting of pay-per-view digital television programmes. The control words CW are<br>
periodically renewed and are stored in control messages denoted ECM (standing for<br>
"Entitlement Control Message"), which are affixed to the corresponding scrambled data<br>
packets.<br>
Fig. 3 diagrammatically illustrates the content of a data packet 300 representing<br>
the content 30. This data packet includes scrambled digital data 302 and a control message<br>
ECM 301 which contains the control word CW used to scramble the data. Naturally, a<br>
content, in particular a video sequence belonging to a televised programme, is formed of a<br>
succession of data packets of the type of the packet 300. It will also be noted that generally,<br>
the messages ECM containing the control words which served to scramble digital data are<br>
transmitted in advance, in the data stream, relative to the data scrambled with these control<br>
words.<br>
If the content 30 received by the access device 10 is not already in the form<br>
described above, it is converted by the access device so as to consist of data packets as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 3.<br>
It will be noted, moreover, that the digital data representing the content 30<br>
contain copy control information items defining the status of the data with regard to<br>
copying. These information items are preferably inserted into the ECM messages and<br>
define, as was seen above, four possible states:<br>
- copying authorized ("copy free");<br>
- a single generation (or a given number of generations) of copying authorized<br>
("copy once" or "copy N times");<br>
- no more copying authorized ("copy no more");<br>
- copying never authorized ("copy never").<br>
The protocol according to the invention, as described below in conjunction with<br>
Fig. 4, makes it possible to guard against data belonging to the last two categories above<br>
(data of the "copying unauthorized" type) from being copied when they are transmitted<br>
from the access device 10 to the presentation device 12.<br>
Moreover, other information items may be affixed to the data representing the<br>
content 30:<br>
- an information item relating to the period of validity of the data, that is to say<br>
the period during which they can be transmitted from the access device 10 to the<br>
presentation device 12; and/or<br>
- an information item relating to the number of times the data can be transmitted<br>
from the access device 10 to the presentation device 12.<br>
Represented in Fig. 4 by two downward vertical axes t is the time axis so as to<br>
illustrate the processing operations performed by the access device 10 and the presentation<br>
device 12 as well as the exchanges between these devices when a new content 30 is to be<br>
broadcast over the domestic digital network.<br>
During a first step 100, the access device 10 detects, as a function of the copy<br>
control information items inserted into the data, whether the content is such that copying is<br>
unauthorized.<br>
If copying of the content is authorized, then the data are transmitted in a<br>
conventional manner over the network. If, on the other hand, the content received is of the<br>
"copying unauthorized" type, then the access device generates, in step 101:<br>
- a first random number R which constitutes an ephemeral encryption key which<br>
will be referred to as the "content key" in the subsequent description, and<br>
- a second random number K which constitutes an ephemeral authentication key<br>
which will be referred to for greater convenience as the "authentication key" in the<br>
subsequent description.<br>
K and R are generated, for each content 30 received, by a pseudo-random<br>
number generator such that the probability of generating the same content key value R or<br>
authentication key value K twice is very low.<br>
The content key R and the authentication key K are stored temporarily by the<br>
access device 10 which erases them, as will be seen below, once the content has been fully<br>
transmitted to a presentation device, possibly after the expiry of a period of validity of the<br>
content or after the latter has been transmitted a specified number of times to a presentation<br>
device 12.<br>
If an information item relating to the period of validity of the content is affixed<br>
to the data, this information item is also stored by the access device 10 before or after step<br>
101.<br>
Likewise, if an information item indicating the number of times the content can<br>
be transmitted to a presentation device is affixed to the data, this information item is stored<br>
in a counter by the access device 10 before or after step 101.<br>
Then, for each message ECM included in the data stream constituting the<br>
content, the access device 10 extracts the control word CW and performs, in step 102, the<br>
following operation for encrypting this control word with the content key R:<br>
CW © R; where © represents the "exclusive OR" operation (or "XOR").<br>
The encrypted control word CW © R as well as the authentication key K are<br>
inserted into the message ECM in place of the initial control word. The message ECM thus<br>
transformed is denoted LECM. The message LECM comprises in particular the copy<br>
control information items which, in the present case, indicate that this content is of the<br>
"copying unauthorized" type.<br>
The message LECM is then encrypted, in step 103, so as to be transmitted in a<br>
secure manner to the presentation device 12.<br>
In a first preferred variant, asymmetric encryption will be used. It is assumed<br>
that as is described in the aforesaid French Patent Application FR-A-2 792 482 from the<br>
applicant, the domestic digital network possesses a private key KprI res and public key<br>
Kpub_res pair and that each access device 10 of the network contains the public key<br>
Kpub_res of the network and each presentation device 12 contains the private key Kpri res of<br>
the network. The recording device 13 contains neither the public key nor the private key of<br>
the network.<br>
According to this preferred embodiment, the message LECM is encrypted by<br>
the access device 10 with the public key of the network by performing the following<br>
operation:<br><br>
The presentation device 12 can then decrypt this message with the private key<br>
of the network by performing the operation:<br>
It is also possible, in a second variant, for each presentation device 12 of the<br>
network to possess its own private key KPRi Pd and public key Kpub.pd pair. In this case, the<br>
presentation device 12 which wishes to receive a content of the "copying unauthorized"<br>
type from an access device 10 sends its public key Kpub_pd to this device beforehand. The<br>
message LECM is then encrypted, in step 103, with this public key KPUb_pd by performing<br>
the operation:<br><br>
The presentation device 12 then decrypts this message by performing the<br>
operation:<br><br>
In a third variant, it is possible to encrypt the message LECM by using<br>
symmetric encryption. For example, each access device 10 and each presentation device 12<br>
of the network contains a secret key of the network Ks res- The message LECM is in this<br>
case encrypted by the access device with the secret key of the network by performing the<br>
operation:<br><br>
It can then be decrypted by the presentation device 12 by performing the<br>
operation:<br><br>
Finally, it is furthermore possible, in a fourth variant, to encrypt the message<br>
LECM according to a symmetric encryption algorithm by using a pre-shared secret key.<br>
In the subsequent description it will be assumed that the message LECM has<br>
been encrypted, in step 103, with the public key KPub_res of the network as this is described<br>
in the first preferred variant above.<br>
In the next step 104, the data packet 305 containing the encrypted message<br>
LECM and corresponding scrambled data is despatched on the bus 40 of the domestic<br>
network in the synchronous channel of the IEEE 1394 bus, which channel customarily<br>
transports the data compressed according to the MPEG 2 standard (ISO/IEC 13818-1).<br>
This despatch is a broadcast over the network, that is to say all the presentation<br>
devices 12 which are attached to the bus 40 are able to receive the data packet 305.<br>
When a presentation device 12 receives the packet 305, in step 105, it decrypts<br>
the message LECM with the private key of the network KPRi_res as was seen above<br>
according to the first preferred variant embodiment of the invention.<br>
This having been done, it detects whether the scrambled data belong to a<br>
content of the "copying unauthorized" type and, in this case, obtains the encrypted control<br>
word CW © R as well as the authentication key K which it stores temporarily.<br>
In the next step 106, with the aim of authentication of the access device 10<br>
which has despatched the packet 305 over the network, the presentation device 12<br>
generates a random number RI and it despatches it to the access device 10 (step 107) using<br>
the asynchronous channel of the bus 40 (the despatch via the asynchronous channel of the<br>
bus 40 is represented by a dashed arrow in Fig. 4). The communication via the<br>
asynchronous channel of the bus is a communication of the "point-to-point" type, that is to<br>
say between two aforesaid devices of the network. Moreover, the asynchronous channel of<br>
the bus 40 exhibits the particular feature of not being able to be recorded by the<br>
conventional recording devices such as the device 13.<br>
In step 108, when the access device 10 receives the number R,, it performs the<br>
following calculation:<br>
hi = MACK(R,),<br>
where "MACk(x)" represents a "Message Authentication Code" for the message<br>
x using a key K. For further details regarding "MACs" refer to the work "Handbook of<br>
applied cryptography, Alfred J. Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot, Scott A. Vanstone, 1997,<br>
page 325".<br>
The function alluded to previously HMAC-SHA-1 will preferably be used for<br>
the calculation of h,.<br>
In the next step 109, the access device 10 despatches, via the asynchronous<br>
channel of the bus 40, the content key R as well as the result of the calculation hi =<br>
MACk(Ri) to the presentation device 12.<br>
The latter then performs, in step 110, the following calculation:<br>
h'i = MACk(Ri) using the number RI generated in step 106 and the<br>
authentication key K obtained by decrypting the message LECM in step 105.<br>
If h'i is different from the number hi received from the access device 10, then the<br>
presentation device 12 does not continue any further with the process. A message is for<br>
example displayed for the attention of the user (if the presentation device comprises a<br>
display screen) so as to forewarn the latter that the content cannot be viewed (or listened<br>
to).<br>
If on the other hand h'I = h, then the access device 10 is authenticated. In this<br>
case, the presentation device 12 uses the content key R received to decrypt the control<br>
word CW by performing (step 111) the operation:<br>
CW©R©R = CW.<br>
The presentation device 12 can then descramble the data with the control word<br>
CW (step 112) and present the data to the user.<br>
Steps 102 to 112 are repeated so as to transmit each data packet 300 forming<br>
the content. Next, in the following step 113, the presentation device 12 erases from its<br>
memory the content key R and the authentication key K which it had stored temporarily so<br>
as to perform the above calculations.<br>
Once all the data packets (and the corresponding control words CW) forming<br>
the content have been transferred from the access device 10 to the presentation device 12,<br>
three variant embodiments are possible.<br>
According to a first variant embodiment, the content key R and the<br>
authentication key K are immediately erased, in step 115, from the memory of the access<br>
device 10 so that these data can no longer be transmitted to a presentation device for<br>
possible "replay" of the content.<br>
According to a second variant embodiment, it is assumed that an information<br>
item relating to the period of validity of the content was affixed to the data representing the<br>
content and has been stored by the access device 10 before or after step 101. In this case,<br>
during step 114a, a test is performed to verify whether the period of validity of the content<br>
has expired. If the response to the test 114a is positive, then the content key R and the<br>
authentication key K are erased from the memory of the access device 10 during step 115.<br>
If conversely the response to test 114a is negative, then the content key R and the<br>
authentication key K are preserved in the memory of the access device 10 until the expiry of<br>
the period of validity of the content.<br>
According to a third variant embodiment, it is assumed that an information item<br>
indicating the number of times that the content can be transmitted to a presentation device<br>
was affixed to the data. This information item has been stored (before or after step 101) by<br>
the access device 10 in a counter which will be denoted as the "counter of access to the<br>
content". In this case, during a step 114bl, the counter of access to the content is<br>
decremented. Next, during a step 114b2, a test is performed to ascertain whether the<br>
counter of access to the content is at zero. If the response to this test 114b2 is positive, then<br>
the content key R and the authentication key K are erased from the memory of the access<br>
device 10 during step 115. If conversely the response to test 114b2 is negative, then the<br>
content key R and the authentication key K are preserved in the memory of the access<br>
device 10 in such a way as to allow a presentation device to access the content<br>
subsequently.<br>
It will be noted that an advantage of the invention is that it allows several<br>
presentation devices attached to the domestic digital network to simultaneously access a<br>
content broadcast by an access device over the bus 40. In this particular case, the protocol<br>
just described in conjunction with Fig. 4 is executed in parallel between the access device<br>
and the various presentation devices (which share in particular the content key R and the<br>
authentication key K).<br>
It will also be noted that, preferably, the operations performed in steps 100 to<br>
115 just described are not implemented directly by the access device 10 or by the<br>
presentation device 12 but by the secure processors of the smart cards 14 and 15 which are<br>
inserted into respective card readers of the access device 10 and of the presentation device<br>
12.<br>
This solution offers enhanced security since it is almost impossible to access the<br>
data (such as the keys K and R in our example) contained in a smart card.<br>
