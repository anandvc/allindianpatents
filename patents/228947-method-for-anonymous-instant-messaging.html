FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
This invention relates to the field of instant messaging in mobile communication devices. Further, this invention pertains to instant messaging technology for mobile communication devices, where the communicating user may initiate an anonymous conversation with other users. More particularly, this invention relates to a system and method for anonymous instant messaging in mobile devices.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
The instant messaging services has revolutionised the communication world by enabling the exchange of messages faster without causing any inconvenience to recipient. Even then the present scenario doesn't confer enough provisions for a comprehensive solution to achieve the intended requirements for anonymous instant messaging in mobile communication devices. Presently anonymous instant messaging is effected by either a nickname or alias name. Here nickname is usually given by the recipient user, to be stored internally in a client so as to hide the User ID of contacts. Alias name is usually given by the originating user, to be published as a nickname by other users.<br>
The drawback of the present method of instant messaging is that "Nickname" does not really hide the user ID to the recipient user since it is set by the recipient user, after the user is aware of the user ID. Similarly "Alias Name" does not really hide the<br><br>
originator (user) ID to the recipient user and is subject to the availability of presence service element. Moreover both the Nickname and Alias name cannot be used for addressing purpose.<br>
With due consideration to the above, the applicants herein intend to provide a system and method for anonymous IM conversation in which the user ID of the originator is hidden from the target users.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention is therefore to provide a method for anonymous instant messaging (IM), which allows the identity of the IM (originator ID) user initiating the conversation, to be hidden from the other party/parties involved in the IM communication by way of generating temporary IDs both at server side as well as at the sending client side.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a method for instant messaging by hiding the identity of the sender to the recipient based on specific groups of recipients and for a specific time period.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide a method to create a volatile, unique and non-repeatable user ID in place of the actual originating user ID for the recipients and to employ the volatile ID for the communications through out the IM session.<br><br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide an instant messaging system which meets the privacy requirements of the originating user and which renders quality anonymous service, that has the business value, especially among the youths, traders, counselors<br>
Accordingly the invention provides a method for anonymous instant messaging between an originating client and the recipient using an Instant messaging (IM) server, the method comprising the steps of<br>
a)	receiving the request for hiding its actual user ID for anonymous message delivery from the originating client and confirming back to the message request;<br>
b)	creating or substituting a volatile ID for the actual ID of the originating client;<br>
c)	delivering the message to the recipient and obtaining the confirming from the recipient;<br>
d)	receiving a subsequent reply from the recipient which makes use of the said volatile ID for communication and confirming back to the recipient client;<br>
e)	resolving the volatile ID with the actual user ID; and<br>
f)	delivering the reply from the said recipient to the originating client with the actual user ID and obtaining the confirmation from the originating client.<br>
According to a feature of the preferred embodiment of the invention the sending IM Client specifies a specific time duration and IM Server stores the same so that the anonymity is maintained only for that specific time duration and sender's identity is<br><br>
revealed after the time expires.<br>
According to another feature, the sending IM Client specifies the identity of a Group of IM users and the IM Server stores the same Group ID so that, the anonymity is maintained only for the messages sent by the sending IM Client to that specific Group<br>
According to yet another feature of the invention the originating client initiates the anonymous message request using an additional informational element called "Anonymous*.<br>
Another important feature of the invention that the IM Server creates a volatile, unique and non-repeatable user ID in place of the actual originating user ID for the recipients and retains the conversation link with the recipients by using the said volatile ID in place of the actual user ID through out the IM session.<br>
It is another feature of the invention that the recipient user makes use of this volatile ID for the subsequent conversation link.<br>
Yet another feature of the invention is that the IM server resolves the volatile ID in the reply message request with the actual user ID, before it delivers the message to the originator.<br>
Other features, objects and advantages of the present invention will become more<br><br>
readily apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 depicts the transaction flows involved in the IM conversation,<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiment is merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
According to the invention,  an Instant Messaging (IM) user who wants to communicate anonymously, hereinafter referred as originator client, will request the IM server for hiding his actual user ID. This can be communicated to the IM server, through an additional (optional) information element in the message request: E.g. Anonymous: Yes / No. Where the default value is No.<br><br>
The originating client adds a flag, which indicates the anonymity of the message in the message header so that the server can maintain the anonymity for such messages. In the case where the IM Client generating the dynamic volatile ID, the IM Client sends the dynamic ID to the IM Server along with the initial message so that the server can store the dynamic ID for sending the reply back to the IM client.<br>
The originating client may add the time duration for which the anonymity needs to be maintained. Here IM user, who wants to communicate anonymously for a specific time period will request the IM Server, by providing the time duration, to hide his/her identity for the specified time duration. The time duration is usually mentioned in seconds.<br>
Similarly an IM user (originating client), who wants to communicate anonymously with a specific group of IM users, will request the IM Server, by providing the identity of the Group, to hide his/her identity only for the members of that specific group.<br>
The following table exemplifies the above features in an IMPS system where this is achieved by modifying the SendMessageRequest parameter by adding the Anonymity-Info element.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
volatile ID will be subsequently used in place of originator IM user ID by the IM server till the session period or originator decides to reveal his user ID and thereby achieving the anonymous conversation concealing the identity of the originator.<br>
In the scenario, where the IM Client generating the dynamic volatile ID, the IM server stores the dynamic ID of the originating IM User and use the same ID in the messages sent to the recipient IM user. The IM Server also uses the same volatile ID for sending message replies back the IM Client.<br>
Whenever the IM user (originator client) wants to communicate anonymously for a specific time, the IM Server stores the time duration for which the anonymity is expected by the IM user. Subsequently the IM Server generates dynamic, volatile ID as mentioned earlier and sends the same along with the message to the recipient IM user. After the expiry of the time duration, the IM Server sends the actual ID of the sender to the recipient along with the message.<br>
Similarly when the originator client wants to communicate anonymously with a specific group of IM users, the IM Server, stores the identity of the Group, and generates dynamic and volatile ID for the originating user and sends the message with the dynamic ID only to the members of that specific group.<br>
Once the message is delivered with the volatile ID, the recipient user may subsequently use this volatile ID for the subsequent conversation. However the actual user ID will not be known to the recipient user.<br><br>
The entire transaction flows involved in the above-described IM conversation is listed below with reference to Figure 1.<br>
1.	Originating user requests for anonymous message delivery.<br>
2.	IM Server confirms back to the anonymous message request.<br>
3.	IM Server creates / substitutes a volatile Id for the actual ID.<br>
4.	IM Server delivers the message to the recipient.<br>
5.	Recipient client confirms back to the IM server.<br>
6.	Recipient user makes use of this volatile ID for subsequent reply.<br>
7.	IM Server confirms back to the recipient client.<br>
8.	IM Server resolves the volatile ID with the actual user ID.<br>
9.	IM Server delivers the reply to the originating client with the actual user ID.<br>
10.	Originating client confirms back to the IM server.<br>
The invention described herein possesses the following definite advantages.<br>
1.	Originating user will be anonymous to the recipient.<br>
2.	Privacy of the originator is respected.<br>
3.	Conversation is possible though the recipient user is unaware of the original user ID.<br>
4.	Compatible with the existing instant messaging architecture.<br>
5.	It is possible to can be maintain Anonymity for a specific time duration<br>
6.	It is also possible to maintain Anonymity only for a specific group of IM users<br><br>
The above-presented description is of the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention. The manner and process of making and using it is in such a full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable to any person skilled in the art to which it pertains to make and use this invention. New embodiments in particular, which also lie within the scope of the invention can be created, in which different details of the different examples can in a purposeful manner be combined with one another.<br>
