				<td>A method and apparatus for determining the count of a textile material This invention is for determining the count of a textile material. The invention (Figure 1) consists of a float (2) with a stem (4) and a specimen .holder (3). The float is in a transparent vessel (1) containing a liquid. When a specific length of material is put on the holder, the float with its spherical portion (5) sinks to a depth proportional to the count of material tested and this can be read on a scale (7) marked to give the count on the outside of the vessel or marked on the stem of the float itself. Another alternative feature is to have two markings (a) and (b) apart from each other at such a distance that the number of pieces of yarn of specified length put on the holder to make the reference&#x27;mark (6) on the float to sink from (a) to (b) gives the yarn count directly,</td>

				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a method and apparatus for determining the count of a textile material.<br>
One quality parameter in the specification of a yarn, roving or sliver is its count. The count of yarn, roving or sliver is nothing but a numerical representation of its length to weight ratio or vice- versa. In simpler terms it gives us an idea whether material is coarse (thick) or fine (thin). There are several ways in which the count can be expressed. In the Tex system, the count of the material is equal to the weight in grams of one thousand meters of yarn, roving or sliver. In the denier system, the count is the weight in grams of nine thousand meters of material. In the cotton system, the count of yarn, roving or sliver is the number of 840 yards of material present in one pound of material. In the grist system used for jute yarns, the count of yarn is the weight in pounds of 14400 yards of yarn. Similarly, we have other systems also for woolen yarns, worsted yarns etc. The above invention has utility in determining this parameter. In the known art, one of the methods adopted is to take a known length of yarn, roving or sliver either from their package or from the fabric (in the case of yarns) and then weigh it on a double pan beam balance or single pan torsion balance (working on the torsion principle) or a digital balance (working with the help of electronic sensors) on and then calculate the count mentally or using a calculator. In some digital balances the processor inside automatically does this calculation and expresses the count directly. Another prior art is the use of a Quadrant balance, which<br><br>
works on the principle of levers and counter balancing weights. In this method, the yarn of specific length is placed on the platform of the quadrant balance and the pendulum of the quadrant balance moves over a quadrant depending on the count of yarn put on it (since length of yarn is fixed). From the position of rest of the pendulum end, the reading on the Quadrant is read to directly give the count of yarn.<br>
Another method used in the prior art is the Beesley"s Balance. The Beesley"s Balance consists of a beam capable of movement over a fulcrum. One end of the beam has a hook for putting pieces of yarn of specific length taken from the fabric. The other side of the beam has a small rider (weight) place at a notch. In this balance, in order to determine the count, one has to keep adding pieces of yarn on to the yarn hook till the other pointed end of the beam coincides with a reference point. When this happens, the number of pieces of yarn added is counted. The number of pieces of yarn added gives the yarn count directly, since the rider (weight) on the notch is calibrated for the specific length of the pieces of yarn put on the hook.<br>
The invention described in this document, a novel equipment for determining the count of yarn, roving or sliver is based on the floatation principle which is different from the principles of measurements<br><br>
used in the prior art for determining the count of yarn, roving or sliver.<br>
Other objects of the invention are to have an equipment which is easy to make, easy to operate and also available at affordable prices.<br>
The invention concerned can be easily understood by referring to figure 1, accompanying this specification as part of it. Figure 1 shows the equipment consisting of a transparent vessel (1) which contains a liquid say water. Inside this vessel, there is a float (2). The float consists of a specimen holder (3), a long stem (4), a spherical portion (5) inside the liquid. There is a reference mark (6) on the float. On the outer of the transparent vessel is a sliding scale (7) capable of sliding up and down on the vessel. The scale is graduated to give the count of the yarn, roving or sliver when a specified length of the material is tested.<br>
Another alternate or additional feature is to have two markings "a" and "b" one at the top and the other at the bottom of the scale. A third alternative or additional feature is to have the stem of the glass float graduated for yarn, roving or sliver count with the top of the stem having provisions for placing zero adjusting masses if required.<br><br>
WORKING OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The sliding scale reading coinciding with the reference mark on the float is noted. If it is not zero, the scale is slid up or down the transparent vessel to achieve zero reading. After this a specified length of yarn, roving or sliver is taken. It is then placed on the top specimen holder of the float. When this is done, the float will sink. Now the reading on the scale coinciding with the reference point on the float is noted. This reading (since the scale is calibrated thus for the specific length of yarn, roving or sliver and unit of count measurement) gives the count of the specimen tested.<br>
In the alternative or additional method mainly suitable for yarns, initially, the sliding scale is slid so that the reference mark on the float coincides with the marking "a" on the float. Then pieces of yarn of a specified length are put one by one on the yarn holder of the float till the float sinks to the extent that the reference point on the float coincides with mark "b" on the sliding scale. At this point, the number of pieces of yarn put on the yarn holder is counted. This number gives the yarn count directly since the distance between the markings "a" and "b", the specific length of each piece and the equipment are calibrated for this.<br>
In the third alternative or additional method count markings are made on the stem of the float itself. In this technique pieces of zero adjusting masses are put on the specimen holder so that the zero of the count<br><br>
scale coincides with a reference which may be the liquid meniscus or a marking made on the vessel itself. A single reference mark may be made on the sliding scale itself in which case, instead of the placement of the zero adjusting masses, the scale can be slid up or down so that the zero of the scale marked on the stem coincides with it. After the above is carried out, the yarn, roving or sliver of specific length is placed on the yarn holder. The float sinks. Now the reading on the stem coinciding with the reference is noted and this gives the yarn, roving or sliver count.<br>
One can expect the spherical portion of the float to come in contact with the sides of the transparent vessel. However research done with different shapes has confirmed that in this invention, the contact of the float with the sides of the vessel is a point contact which in this instance has minimum adverse effect on the accuracy of the equipment.<br>
It was found during research conducted that variations in the temperature of the liquid from time to time caused a change in the density of the liquid used and so also the float. This caused a significant difference in the initial position of the float and hence the initial reading. This has been overcome by devising the sliding scale and the zero adjusting masses. Even though the scale is calibrated at a specific reference temperature; when the zero is adjusted (according to the procedure outlined earlier),<br><br>
there is no significant influence on the count of material thus determined, if the ambient temperature differs from the reference temperature.<br><br><br><br>
I claim<br>
1)	The method of determining the count of a textile material, the method<br>
comprising the steps of<br>
a)	preparing test specimens of predetermined length<br>
b)	putting zero error adjusting masses on top of a calibrated floating body in liquid so that its initial marking coincides with the liquid meniscus<br>
c)	placing the cut test specimen on the floating body<br>
d)	Observing the extent of sinking of the floating body by noting the<br>
calibrated marking, which gives the count of the specimen directly.<br>
2)	The method as made in claim 1 comprising the step of the addition of pieces of test specimen of predetermined length so that the floating body sinks between two reference points; the number of pieces added being the count of the test specimen<br>
3)	An Apparatus for determining the count of textile yarns, roving or sliver, the said apparatus comprising<br><br>
a)	a vessel with a liquid<br>
b)	a float with a long stem<br>
c)	the said stem comprises of calibrated markings to give count of the test specimen directly, the calibration being specific to the liquid used and the dimension of the test specimen tested<br>
d)	the stem comprises a specimen holder at its top<br><br>
4)	An apparatus as claimed in claim 3) comprising a separate scale on the vessel exterior which is calibrated to give count directly by observing the position of a mark on the float coinciding with the scale.<br>
5)	An apparatus as claimed in claim 3) or claim 4) comprising scale with two markings such that the number of pieces of test specimen of specified length added to make the floating body sink from one reference point to the other will indicate the count of the test specimen.</td>
