The present invention relates to a novel crystalline form of linezolid, to processes for its preparation and to a pharmaceutical composition containing it.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Linezolid, chemically N-[[(5S)-3"[3-fluoro-4"(4-morphormyl)phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyllacetamide is an antibacterial agent. Linezolid is represented by the following structure:<br><br>
Linezolid and related compounds, processes for their preparation and their therapeutic uses were disclosed in US 5.688J92. Processes for preparation of linezolid were also described in US 5,837,870, WO 99/24393, J.Med.Chem. 39(3), 673-679,1996 and Tetrahedron Lett, 40(26), 4855,1999.<br>
Linezolid is known to exhibit polymorphism and two crystalline forms are so far known. US 6,559,305 and US 6,444,813 addressed that the product obtained by the process described by J.Med.Chem. 39(3), 673-679, 1996 is form I and is characterized by having melting point of 181.5-182.5°C and by IR spectrum having bands at 3284, 3092, 1753, 1728, 1649, 1565, 1519. 1447, 1435 cm'-1 US 6,559,305 claims crystalline form II characterized by IR spectrum having bands at 3364, 1748, 1675, 1537, 1517,1445, 1410, 1401, 1358, 1329,  1287. 1274, 1253, 1237, 1221, 1145. 1130, 1123.1116, 1078, 1066. 1049, 907. 852 and 758 cm-1 and powder X-ray diffraction spectrum having 2-theta values<br><br>

Linezolid form III is obtained by heating linezolid in a known crystalline form or in a mixture of known crystalline forms until the known form/s are converted to form 111.<br>
The known form may be heated directly to obtain linezolid form III; or linezolid form 111 may be obtained by heating linezolid suspended in a solvent like toluene, xylene, etc.<br>

The reaction mixture is optionally seeded with linezolid form III before isolating linezolid form III.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, still another process is provided for preparation of linezolid form III.<br>
Thus, linezolid is mixed with a solvent. Linezolid is preferably mixed at boiling point of the solvent used. The solvent is selected from the group consisting of toluene, xylene, chloroform methylene dichloride. acetonitrile, water, RrOH, R1-CO-Ra, R1-CO-O-R2, R1-O-R2 wherein R1 and R2 are independently C1-C6 alkyl groups.
