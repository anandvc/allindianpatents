PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
Specification<br>
The present invention relates to mixtures of sweeteners comprising isomaltulose and at least one intense sweetener, in which the duration of the taste of at least one intense sweetener is decreased by isomaltulose, and the use of isomaltulose as a taste-decreasing agent.<br>
Intense sweeteners are frequently used as ingredients in beverages and in foods, semi-luxury foods, or medicines. However, intense sweeteners frequently have an undesirably long-lingering aftertaste.<br>
One intense sweetener, approved for use in the U.S. in 1989 and in the European Union in 2004, which is frequently used to sweeten beverages and foods, semi-luxury foods and medicines, is sucralose.<br>
Sucralose, which is also known to those of ordinary skill in the art as Splenda, is the common name for l,6-dichloro-l,6-didesoxy-b-D-fructofuranosyl-4-chloro-4-desoxy-a-D-galactopyranoside. Sucralose, described in British patent No. 1543167, is not metabolized in the body, has no calories, and can be used in dental care products. Sucralose is a highly intense sweetener. In aqueous solution, sucralose is approximately 600 times sweeter than sugar and possesses a clean taste profile. Sucralose has a distinct lingering aftertaste.<br>
Consumers consider this undesirable in many products, such as cola, lemonades and sweetened waters.<br>
The reducing disaccharide ketose isomaltulose (6-O-a-D-glucopyranosyl-fructose), which occurs naturally, for example in honey, and which is also known to one of ordinary skill in the art as Palatinose, is used primarily as a source material for producing isomalt, a nearly equimolar mixture of the diastereomers 6-O-a-D-glucopyranosyl-D-sorbitol (1,6-GPS) and 1-O-a-D-glucopyranosyl-D-mannitol (1,1-<br><br><br>
GPM). Due to its low sweetening power and the resulting flavor, isomaltulose is used primarily in combination with sugar substitutes and/or sweeteners as a sweetening agent in foods. Due to the delayed degradation of the isomaltulose, which begins only when it reaches the small intestine, it is also used in special foods for athletes, to sustain their oxidative metabolism.<br>
Isomaltulose crystallizes in the form of a monohydrate. The aqueous solubility of isomaltulose is 0.49 g anhydrous isomaltulose per g water. Isomaltulose has advantageous acariogenic properties, because it is not degraded by the bacteria in the human mouth. Isomaltulose is broken down only in a delayed fashion by the glucosidases in the wall of the human small intestine, with the resulting decomposition products glucose and fructose being resorbed. This results in a slow increase in blood glucose, as compared with rapidly digestible carbohydrates. Isomaltulose requires hardly any insulin for metabolization, in contrast to rapidly digestible, high-glycemic foods. Despite its favorable acariogenic properties, isomaltulose has rarely been used as the sole sugar or sole sweetening agent in foods or beverages, unlike sugar substitutes such as mannitol, sorbitol and isomalt, or sweeteners like cyclamate. This is due especially to the taste of isomaltulose, especially due to its substantially lower sweetening power as compared with saccharose. The sweetening power of 10% aqueous isomaltulose solutions amounts to only approximately 0.4 of the sweetening power of sugar [sic -Translator].<br>
To some extent, isomaltulose is also used to mask the unpleasant taste of other foods. EP 0 809 939 Al describes a yogurt containing lactic-acid bacteria and bifido bacteria, which contains refined fish oil with a high ratio of unsaturated fatty acids, and a sweetening agent, such as isomaltulose. Isomaltulose is added to prevent the development of the typical fish taste and fish odor. JP 63152950 A2 describes the production of vegetable gelatin products using various types of vegetables and a gelling agent, in which isomaltulose and other additives such as cinnamon are used to mask the unpleasant odor of some vegetable components.<br><br><br>
DE 690 005 48 T2 describes sweetener compositions containing sucralose and isomaltulose, wherein these compositions have a synergistic effect, in other words they exhibit greater sweetening power than would be expected as the sweetening power demonstrated by the sweetening components if added alone. The mixture of sweeteners can be used, for example, in the production of beverages and confections.<br>
US patent 5,902,628 describes the decrease in the lingering, sweet aftertaste of sucralose by mixing it with tannic acids.<br>
However, tannic acids, as tannins, can have a bitter taste, which can be unpleasant in beverages and foods, semi-luxury foods or medicines.<br>
The present invention is therefore based upon the technical problem of creating beverages, foods, semi-luxury foods or medicines in which the lingering aftertaste of intense sweeteners, especially sucralose, is decreased, without this affecting the taste quality in a way that is unpleasant or strange to consumers. Furthermore, the intention is not to decrease the sweetening power or sweetness intensity of sucralose and/or the sweetening agents in the relevant product, but only to decrease the duration of the sweet aftertaste.<br>
The present invention is further based upon the technical problem of providing methods and products, especially sweetener mixtures, with which the lingering aftertaste of intense sweeteners, especially sucralose, is decreased in foods, semi-luxury foods or medicines, and beverages in the aforementioned manner.<br>
The present invention solves the technical problem upon which it is based through<br>
the use of isomaltulose as a taste-decreasing agent. Especially, the present invention<br>
solves the technical problem upon which it is based through the use of isomaltulose<br>
to decrease the taste of at least one intense sweetener, especially sucralose, in other<br>
words	l,6-dichloro-l,6-didesoxy-p-D-fructofuranosyl-4-chloro-4-desoxy-a-D-<br>
galactopyranoside.<br><br><br>
In the context of the invention, taste is understood to mean the chemical sense of humans to perceive and differentiate foods. Humans are able to differentiate essentially four taste qualities: sweet, sour, bitter and salty. The taste stimulus occurs as a result of the activation of a gustatory cell by the deposition of molecules of a taste substance on receptor molecules. A taste stimulus can be pronounced to different degrees in terms of its quality, for example whether it is sweet, sour, bitter, salty, or a mixture of these, in its intensity, in other words the strength of the taste, and in its duration. No connection between taste intensity and taste duration necessarily exists. A decrease in taste intensity, for example sweetening power, does not necessarily mean a simultaneous reduction in taste duration, and vice versa. A reduction in taste duration does not necessarily mean a change, especially a decrease, in taste intensity.<br>
One component of taste duration is the duration of the aftertaste, in other words the taste that lingers or persists after a product has been consumed, or the final taste phase. In some cases, aftertaste can linger a long time.<br>
Preferably, when isomaltulose is used as a taste-decreasing agent, the lingering, especially persistent, aftertaste of an intense sweetener is decreased, without its taste intensity, in other words its sweetening power, or its other flavor qualities being thereby altered, especially decreased or intensified. Preferably isomaltulose decreases the taste, especially the aftertaste, of an intense sweetener through an effect that is independent of the solubility of the sweetening agents, in other words isomaltulose does not alter the solubility of sucralose or other intense sweeteners. Most preferably, isomaltulose decreases only the aftertaste of an intense sweetener, especially sucralose, in other words in the final taste phase, without shortening the main phase, in other words the taste during consumption. The initial taste sensation is also preferably unaffected.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term "sweetening agent" is used to refer to substances that have sweetening power and are added, for example, to foods or<br><br><br>
beverages in order to give them a sweet taste. In the context of the present invention "sweetening agents" are subdivided into "sugars" such as isomaltulose, saccharose, glucose or fructose, which provide body and sweetening power, and "sweeteners", in other words substances that are not sugars but nevertheless have sweetening power, which are in turn subdivided into "sugar substitutes", in other words sweetening agents that have body and a physiological calorific value in addition to a sweetening power (sweeteners absorbed by the body), and "intense sweeteners", in other words substances that ordinarily have a very high sweetening power, but no body and ordinarily no, or only a low, physiological calorific value. Sucralose is an example of an intense sweetener.<br>
The invention relates to the use of isomaltulose as a taste-decreasing agent. According to the invention, the use of isomaltulose is preferred, wherein the isomaltulose decreases the taste of at least one intense sweetener, especially sucralose.<br>

The sensory evaluation of the chocolates containing sucralose was performed by 12 to 17 test subjects.<br>
The aftertaste of the sucralose was assessed after the chocolate had been completely dissolved in the mouth.<br>
Result;<br>
In milk chocolates containing sucralose, isomaltulose decreases the lingering aftertaste of this sweetener, as is shown in Figure 1. This is clearly noticeable when compared with milk chocolates containing sucralose along with other sugar substitutes, especially erythrite, for example.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Aqueous solutions containing sucralose were prepared, which contained isomaltulose, maltodextrin or saccharose as a sweetener. All the solutions also contained sucralose. The solutions were sensorially evaluated with respect to their aftertaste that is typical of sucralose, wherein the sample form the test subjects used was the same as the sample form described in reference to Example 1.<br>
Samples:<br>
•	Maltodextrin solution:    7.916 % maltodextrin; 0.004 % sucralose; 92.080 %<br>
water<br><br><br>
•	Palatinose™ solution:    7.916 % isomaltulose; 0.004 % sucralose; 92.080 % water<br>
•	Saccharose solution: 5.603 % saccharose; 0.004 % sucralose; 94.393 % water<br>
The sensory evaluation of the solutions containing sucralose was performed by 5 test subjects.<br>
The aftertaste of the sucralose was assessed immediately following consumption of the solution containing sucralose.<br>
Result:<br>
In solutions containing sucralose, isomaltulose decreases the lingering aftertaste of this sweetener as compared with solutions containing maltodextrin or saccharose (0 = no perceptible aftertaste; 2 = aftertaste clearly perceptible).<br><br><br>
