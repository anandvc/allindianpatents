				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention applies to the field of wireless telecommunication. This invention pertains to the physical layer (Layer 1) of the protocol stack of the said future wireless systems. More particularly the present invention relates to a system and method for information transfer in wireless communication system.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
The future wireless systems such as LTE may require the transfer of certain system/ cell specific layer 1 parameters, which should be attained by the UE as soon as possible. For example, the section 7.1.2.4.1 in 3GPP TR 25.814 v7.0.0 (2006-06) states that the UE must acquire at least the following cell-specific information.<br>
-	The overall transmission bandwidth of the cell<br>
-	Cell ID<br>
-	Radio frame timing information when this is not directly given by the SCH timing, i.e., if the SCH is transmitted more than once every radio frame, see Section 7.1.2.4.2 for further information.<br>
-	Information regarding the antenna configuration of the cell (number of transmitter antennas)<br>
-	Information regarding the BCH bandwidth if multiple transmission bandwidths of the BCH are defined, see also Section 7.1.2.4.3<br>
- CP length information regarding the sub-frame in which the SCH and/or BCH are transmitted<br>
Each set of information is detected by using one or several of the SCH, reference symbols, or the BCH. The method in which these (SCH, reference symbols, or the BCH) will be used is not discussed.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
Most of the system information mentioned above is of high importance and therefore need to be detected by the UE as soon as possible. In some cases even listening to the BCH may require the knowledge of this information at the UE. How this information will be sent to UE and detected by it subsequently is still open and all the possibilities are to be explored.<br>
The signaling of information using BCH will cause some delay (till the time BCH could be read). Also, the BCH reading may itself require some of this information like e.g. the knowledge of system/ BCH bandwidth.<br>
Reference signaling will be an additional overhead and needs all kinds of complication like resource usage and scheduling etc. <br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention proposes to define a set of useful system/ cell-specific information parameters, which are pre-configured and known to both, the UE and the network. There will be multiple such combinations of different parameters. All these combination set will be indexed from 1 to a maximum value. The UE should be able to obtain the one set (a particular index of information parameter set) which corresponds to the system/ cell-specific information applicable in the current system/ cell. The present invention proposes to use the Secondary SCH as an index to the particular information parameter set and thereby convey the information to the UE. Synchronization codes (Secondary Synchronization codes and Primary Synchronization) codes are normally used by a wireless system in the cell search procedure for example to attain the timing synchronization.<br>
The present invention proposes a system and method to signal a set of pre- configured and essential system/ cell-specific information to the UE using indexing method, where the SSC code sequences serve as the index for the pre- configured set. The invention further proposes to use the SSC codes as indexes for signaling the essential information to the UE.<br>
Accordingly the invention explains a method for information transfer in wireless telecommunication system like LTE system wherein the said method signals a set of pre-configured and essential system/ cell-specific information to the UE using <br>
indexing method; where the SSC code sequences serve as the index for the pre- configured set.<br>
Accordingly the invention also explains a system for information transfer in wireless telecommunication system wherein the said system involves a means to signal a set of pre-configured and essential system/ cell-specific information to the UE using indexing method; where the SSC code sequences serve as the index for the pre-configured set.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 depicts the flow diagram explains the steps involved in the said procedures.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Cell search is the procedure by which a UE acquires time and frequency synchronization with a cell and detects the Cell ID of that cell. For this purpose the SCH (both primary and the secondary) is used. The primary purpose of the SCH is to enable acquisition of the received timing, i.e., at least the SCH symbol timing and frequency of the downlink signal. The UE should also obtain the remaining cell/system-specific information, which is required preferably before reading the broadcast cell/ system information using the BCH channel.<br>
The present invention proposes an exact method to help UE acquire at least following cell-specific information, which are required once the cell search procedure is complete:<br>
-	The overall transmission bandwidth of the cell<br>
-	Cell ID<br>
-	Radio frame timing information when this is not directly given by the SCH timing, i.e., if the SCH is transmitted more than once every radio frame<br>
-	Information regarding the antenna configuration of the cell (number of transmitter antennas)<br>
-	Information regarding the BCH bandwidth if multiple transmission bandwidths of the BCH are defined<br>
-	CP length information regarding the sub-frame in which the SCH and/or BCH are transmitted<br>
It is to be noted that the cell id should already be known to the UE (once the cell search procedure is completed) and the Radio frame timing information should possibly be known to the UE.<br>
The invention hereby proposes to define a set of pre-configurations, which are known to both, the network and the UE. The present invention combines a set of useful and simultaneously valid parameters (as listed above e.g. overall transmission BW, Radio Frame timing information (sub-frame id), Antenna configuration, BCH BW and CP Length). The combinations will be default and looks something like TFCS (Transport Format Combination Set) combinations. One example of these pre-configuration is like 10 MHz overall BW; sub-frame id 11, 2 Tx Antenna (MIMO), 5 MHz BCH BW and CP length of 64. Likewise it can define multiple such pre-configurations.<br>
The intention is to send the above information (pre-configurations) using the secondary SCH (Secondary Synchronization codes, SSC). <br>
The table below shows the mapping between the SSC code and the pre- configurations containing system/ cell-specific information. The respective SSC codes will serve as the index of the above table.<br>
Table 1: Mapping Table<br>
SSC1	Overall<br>
Transmission<br>
BW1	Subframe_id1	MIMO- _config(Tx Antenna) 1	BCH_BW_option1	CP_length1<br>
SSC2	Overall Transmission BW 2	Subframe_id2	MIMO-<br>
_config(Tx<br>
Antenna)2	BCH_BW_option2	CP_length2<br>
SSC3	Overall Transmission BW 3	Subframe_id3	MIMO-<br>
jConfig(Tx<br>
Antenna)3	BCH_BW_option3	CP_length3<br><br>
SSC 16	Overall Transmission BW 16	Subframe_id16	MIMO- _config(Tx Antenna) 16	BC H_B W_opti on 16	CP_length16<br><br>
NOTE<br>
1.	The above table is for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to specify the number of pre-configurations, which will be required, or the number of SSC codes available in any particular wireless system.<br>
2.	The actual possible combinations will depend on the values of the respective parameters, which can be used simultaneously. Using more than one SSC code for indexing is also possible and should be done if required. So if there are 16 SSCs (as in WCDMA) then using 2 SSC codes will give us 256 indexes and those many possible combinations.<br>
To calculate an example set of parameter set, which should be read before reading BCH, the following example from a probable LTE system requirement is taken:<br>
Overall Transmission	5 MHz, 10MHz, 20MHz (3)<br>
Subframejd	Repetition 1,2 or 4 (3)<br>
(Tx Antenna)	1,2 or 4 (3)<br>
BCH_BW_option (transmitted only if different from overall transmission BW)	1.25 MHz, 5 MHz, 10MHz, 20MHz (4)<br>
CP Length	Short or Long (2)<br><br>
So, the total number of combinations possible would be 3*3*3*4*2 = 216.<br>
Therefore it should be possible to include every possible combination in the table for any future wireless telecommunication system.<br>
3. The configuration mentioned in any column need not all be different (Subframe_id1 could be same as Subframe_id2). It will look something like a TFCS containing only the valid combinations, which can be used together.<br>
To send this information (index) the present invention uses the Secondary Synchronization codes (SSC), which will be present in addition to the SSCs used in the initial cell search procedure. This additional SSC may be signaled in the same (or different, if the need be) frame/ sub-frame/ symbol/ slot as the one containing the mandatory SSC used for the cell search depending on the particular system requirements.<br>
Figure 1 depicts the flow diagram explains the steps involved in the said procedures.<br>
STEP1: Cell search procedure is ongoing in step 1.<br>
STEP2: Cell search procedure is completed and therefore there is a need to know the system information related to physical layer at this point of time. UE receives <br>
the Secondary Synchronization codes (SSCs). These codes are not received as part of the cell search procedure i.e. these codes will be exclusively sent for the said purpose of receiving the system information at the UE.<br>
STEP3: UE upon receiving the SSC code(s) in step2 calculates the index value. For example if 2 SSC are used for this purpose and there are total of 16 SSC codes, as in UMTS system and where the UE receives SSC x and SSC y then the index value of the table would be (x *(16A0) + y * (16A1)).<br>
STEP4: The value calculated in Step3 would serve as the index of the Table 1. The parameters would be the corresponding parameters in the same row in the said table.<br>
j<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
The main advantage in the proposed method is that it requires no additional channels for signaling of the required information and can be concluded almost as soon as the cell search procedure is completed. Thus this is advantageous even for reading the BCH. Thus minimal latency and very low overhead make it a very beneficial method for the UE to obtain the important system and cell-specific parameters.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from. <br>
