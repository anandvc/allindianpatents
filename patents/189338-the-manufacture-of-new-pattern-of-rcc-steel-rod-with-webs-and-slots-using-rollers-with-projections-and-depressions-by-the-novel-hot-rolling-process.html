DESCRIPTION OF THt ROLLERS:<br>
The Drawing No.2 shows the cut sections and the Front elevation of the Rollers* The dimensions of the Roller depends upon the dimensions of the Rod the description of the roller is as follows*<br>
The Rollers are molded with a special type of mould. The material for the Roller variesdepending upon the property, Dimensions and operating   of the Rod* The preparation of the mould is just opposite to that of the Roller for projections in Roller the mould has Depressions vice versa,  Which is a special process and it is the Design point of the mould.<br>
The Rollers that is molded out of the mould has projections equal to the dimensions of the slot and Depressions equal to the web at the end*  Inside the slot the centre surface of the Roller equal to the width of the slot in the rod has the Diamond shaped projections and Depressions in an alternative manner throughout its circumference* The Diamond shaped projections and B«Mm Depressions has the square shaped Depressions and projections* Cventhough the cut section of the Rod has the (diamond shaped projections and inside the slots in an alternative manner with respect to each slot the Rollers are 4 Identical Rollers only. 4 identical Rollers are used for the<br>
manufacturing process for this special type of steal rods. The Drawing No. 2 shows the 4 identical rollers. The Rollers R1 &amp; R4 shows the Front view of the Rollers, The Roller R1 shows the Diamond shaped Depressions with square shaped projections at the ends and the Oiamond shaped projection with square shaped depression in it at the centre*<br>
The Roller R4 shows the Oiamond shaped projections with square shaped Depressions in it at the ends and the (Diamond shaped Depressions) square shaped projections from the Diamond shaped Depressions at the centre,<br>
R3 and RA indicate the ct)t sections of the Rollers with the sleeves and the shaft* The Rollers are provided with Bevel Gears at both the sides of the Rollers for the simultaneous transmission of Power Or Drive to all the 4 Rollers*<br>
SPCCIFIC/^TIONS or THE STEEL ROD find ROLLERS:<br>
The dimensions of the various parts of the rod are mentioned with respect to 20 parts of the rod* The dimensions of the rod, roller <br><br>
Depth of the projections and Depressions depends upon the Rollers Dimensions and the requirement* of steel rod*<br>
The dimensions of the Roller stated here Is for the production of a 2Qfflm. rod* The dimensions varies depending upon the Diameter of the rod.<br><br>
WOUNTING OF THE ROLLERS FOR That PROOlCTION OF THE STEEL ROO.<br>
The Mounting of the Rollers for the production of Steel Rod is shown in Drawing No.2. The mould for the Hot Finishing (*loll consist of 4 identical Rollers each forming l/4th shape of the steel Rod, The Roller R1 is mounted to the shaft Si at the top with the sleeve or Bearings. The Roller R2 is mounted to the shaft S2 at the bottom with the sleeve or Bearings. The Rollers R1 and R2 are mounted in such a way that the Diamond shaped Depressions with square shaped projections face each other that it forms the Diamond shaped reelections with square shaped perfectible vitally Depressions in the New Steel Rod  The Rollers R3 is mounted to the shaft S3 at the left eider of the steel Rod with the sleeve of Bearings, The Rollers R4 is mounted to the shaft S4 at the Right side of the steel Rod with the sleeve of Bearings. The Rollers R3 and R4 are mounted in such a way that the Diamond shaped projection with square shaped Depressions in it that it forms the Diamond shaped Depressions with square shaped projections in the steel Rod.<br>
The shafts SI and S^ with Rollers R1 and R3 and sleeve or Bearings are supported by a L clamp LI at the top left side. The shafts Si and S4 with Rollers (R1 and R4) and sleeve or Bearings are supported by a L clamp L2 at the top Right side. The shafts S3 and S2 with rollers (R3 and R2) and sleeve are supported by a Clamp L3 at the bottom left side. The shafts S4 and S2 with rollers (R4 and R2) and sleeve are supported by a L clamp L4 at the Bottom Right side.<br>
The drive for the Rollers is transmitted by the Bevel Gears at the sides of the Rollers.  Since all the Bevel Gears of the Rollers are meshed together with each other the drive<br>
given to anyone of the rollers is transmitted to all the Rollers simultaneously thereby the speed of the 4 Rollers will be uniform. The main purpose of the Bevel Gear system is that the derive to 4 Rollers can be supplied by giving the Drive to anyone of the Rollers i.e. the drive from the main shaft ness is transmitted to the Roller through the Bevel Gears BG1 and BG2 from where it is transmitted to all the Gears.<br>
The Finishing Rollers are supported with huge intermediate Rollers for the higher loads to provide the necessary force for the plastic Deformation of the metal. Depending upon the Dimensions of the rod, rollers etc. the loads too will be varied as per the required loads by means of a Two high or by cluster arrangement of the Rollers.<br>
Manufacturing PROCESS OF THE NEU Pattern Of RCC STECL ROD with UEBS find SLOTS.<br>
The manufacturing process of this New Pattern of RCC Steel Rod is the Hot Rolling Process.<br>
The steel rod whose diameter is equal to the diameter of the New pattern of RCC steel rod at the webs (in insured) at high temperature is inserted in between the 4 Finishing Rollers which are arranged in an alternative manner with respect to each other* The Round steel rod which is at higher temperature is subjected to plastic deformation at the Rollers by the huge load applied to the Rollers by means of the Two high or cluster arrangement of Idler Rollers,  Since the rollers is mounted in such a way that when the two projections in the rollers presses the rod the other two Depressions in rollers will coincide with each other.  Because of such mounting the 2 projections in the roller forms 2 Depressions in the rod and this metal takes the projections of the rod due to the<br><br>
Depressions in the other 2 opposite Rollers. The drive given to one of the Rollers is transmitted to other 3 rollers by the Bevel Gear Drive* This drive pulls the round rod into the mould i«e» Finishing rollers and the deformed steel rod is pushed out of the Rollers by the uniform rotation of the rollers.  So the round steel rod inserted in between the A Rollers comes out as a New pattern of RCC steel Rod with 4 equal slots and 4 equal webs and out of the 4 slots* 2 opposite slots has the Diamond shaped projection with square shaped Depressions and the other 2 opposite slots has the Diamond shaped. Depressions with square shaped projections in it*  Such projections and Depressions occur in an alternative manner in each slot and also in an alternative manner with respect to each slots, (throughout its length).<br>
FEATURES OF THE NEW WTTERN OF RCC STEEL Rapt<br>
The Drawing No*1 shows the 4 sectional view and the plan view of the rod at 2 positions.  The rod has 4 equal webs and 4 equal slots and out of 4 slots the 2 opposite slots has the Diamond shaped projections with square shaped depression and the other 2 opposite slots has the Diamond shaped Depressions with square shaped projection from it in an alternative manner with respect to each slots and also in an alternative manner throughout its entire length*<br>
i) The 4 webs in the New steel rod is like the 2 I sections so this 4 webs take care of the Extra Bending moment to the rod i.e* the 2 webs are induced to compression and the other 2 webs are induced to tension (Expansion)*  So because of this feature the Bending moment of the New pattern of RCC steel Rod is increased by 30% than that of the present type of steel rods.<br>
ii) The 4 slots in the New steel rod increases the surface Area of contact of steel rod with the cement concrete*<br>
ill) The alternative Diamond shaped projection and Depressions in each slot provides Extra strength to the steel rod besides increasing the surface Area of contact of the rod with RCC,<br>
iv) The small square shaped projections and Depressions provided in the Diamond shaped Depressions and projections provides Extra Grip and surface contact uith the RCC that rod alone cannot be pulled out of the RCC even when subjected to higher loads,<br>
v)  Since the Rod has the Diamond shaped projections at 2 opposite slots and the Diamond heaped Depressions at the other 2 opposite slots arranged in an alternative manner with respects to the slots throughout its length the possibility of failure of the rod is less*<br>
ADVANTAGES OF NEU PATTERN OF RCC STEEL RODS WITH UEBS &amp; SLOTS THAN THAT OF THE PRESENT TYPE OF RCC STEEL RODS:<br>
1, The surface Area of contact of this type of RCC Steel rods with the cement concrete is 2 5  more than that of the Present type of steel rods with the ease quantity of steel,<br>
2« The strength and Upending foment of this type of RCC steel rods is 2S%  more than that of the present type of RCC Steel Rods,<br>
3« Because of the specialized Design the Grip between the steel rod and cement concrete is increased that the steel rod alone cannot be pulled out from the cement concrete even when subjected to higher loads.<br>
4,	The strength of the Building with this type of RCC Steel rod will be increased by 30J(I than that of the Building with the present type of RCC steel rods,<br>
5,	Because of the specialised Design this type of steel<br>
