				<td>The present invention relates to a music string according to the preamble of claim<br>
1,<br>
Such a string is known from inter alia US 4,333,379 comprising a steel core of<br>
bronzed gray cast iron.<br>
A music string must possess many different properties. The most important is a<br>
high mechanical strength which allows the siting to be loaded to its tuning<br>
frequency, and to resist the variations in tension in the string when played on.<br>
The level of mechanical strength required depends on the diameter of the string.<br>
Finer strings are used for the higher tones and generally, the finer the string the<br>
higher the mechanical strength required. For example, a 0,254 mm (0,010")<br>
guitar string to be used for the tone E must have a tensile strength of at least<br>
1500 Mpa to be tuned. Furthermore, in order to safely withstand the tensions<br>
created when played on by a plectrum, the 0,254 mm string should preferably<br>
have a tensile strength of approximately 2500 MPa.<br>
Another important property is the resistance to relaxation of the string material,<br>
This property basically tells how well the guitar string will maintain its tune. For<br>
example, a toss of force in the magnitude of 1 N in a string of diameter 0,33 mm,<br>
loaded to the tone 8 on a guitar (i.e. 247 Hz), corresponds to a drop of<br>
approximately 2 Hz in frequency. Since the human ear can detect the difference<br>
between, e.g., 440 Hz and 441 Hz, a force loss of 1 N will be well audible for the<br>
human ear, if a drop like this occurs, the string needs to be retuned. Frequent<br>
retuning is disturbing for the musician, and will over time deteriorate the<br>
properties of the string. Hence, eventually the tone quality of the string will be<br>
affected and thereby also the life time of the string.. Consequently, for Improved<br>
tuning stability, tone quality and string life, it is desirable that the string material<br>
has a high resistance to relaxation.<br><br>
Another essential property of the string material is its ability to be cold drawn to<br>
the required wire dimensions, without becoming too brittle. Furthermore, the<br>
string may constitute a single wire, one or more twisted wires or a wrapped wire.<br>
This in turn requires that the material be sufficiently ductile to allow the string wire<br>
to be twisted.<br>
in case of a string for electrical instruments, such as an electrical guitar, the<br>
sound generated by the string is a result of the electromagnetic properties of the<br>
string. Most electric guitars apply electromagnetic pickups which consist of a coil<br>
with a permanent magnet. The string vibrations cause changes in the magnetic<br>
flux through the coll, thus inducing electrical signals, which are transferred to an<br>
amplifier where the signal is further processed and amplified. The more magnetic<br>
the string, the higher voltage the produced in the coll and the louder the sound<br>
created.<br>
Moreover, a string of a musical instrument is exposed to different types of<br>
corrosion. The corrosion will stain the string, thereby affecting both the<br>
mechanical properties and the tuning properties over time. One type of corrosion<br>
to which a string is subjected is atmospheric corrosion, which can be substantial<br>
on carbon steel in humid and warm conditions or, when the instrument is played<br>
on outdoors. Furthermore, substances such as sweat or grease may be<br>
transferred from the musician to the string, which may constitute a risk of<br>
corrosion of the string. Human sweat contains sodium chloride which is highly<br>
corrosive. Grease on the other hand may collect other substances that corrode<br>
the string lightly and discolor the surface of it permanently.<br>
Ordinary strings are commonly made of high carbon steel drawn to different wire<br>
diameters. Carbon steel has many good qualities, such that it is easy to draw<br>
wire to high strength levels without encountering brittleness. However, a major<br>
drawback of carbon steel when used in strings is that it rusts easily, thus staining<br><br>
the surface which will affect the tone quality and playing characteristics of the<br>
string. Staining is a common reason for restringing an instrument.<br>
Many attempts to arrest corrosion on carbon steel strings have been done<br>
without success, e.g., coating strings with different materials such as natural and<br>
synthetic polymers. However, coating generally decreases the string vibrations,<br>
thus leading to reduced brightness and an inferior sound quality.<br>
Yet another drawback of carbon steel when used in strings is its tendency to be<br>
stretched when loaded. This effect caused by relaxation of the material is<br>
particularly noticeable the first period after stringing a new instrument or after<br>
restringing an old instrument, both on large, static instruments such as pianos,<br>
and on small, mobile instruments such as guitars and violins. A new string<br>
requires a "setting time" until is reaches a stable tone. Obviously, the instrument<br>
itself accounts for a large portion of the "detuning" as a result of variations in<br>
humidity and temperature, but much of the effect is attributed to the strings. For a<br>
piano producer, for instance, this means a long and costly period of tuning and<br>
retuning before delivery of a new instrument, and for an instrument player it<br>
means frequent retuning until an acceptable stability of tone has been reached.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for a string which will overcome the problems given<br>
above.<br>
Consequently, the object of the invention is to provide a music string with<br>
extended service life.<br>
Summary<br>
The stated object is achieved by a string as initially defined and having the<br>
features of the characterizing portion of claim 1.<br><br>
By utilizing a precipitation hardening stainless steel In music strings both the<br>
corrosion resistance and the resistance to relaxation are much improved<br>
compared to commonly used carbon steel strings and thereby the life time of the<br>
string is prolonged.<br>
The string is intended for use in acoustic and semi-acoustic instruments as well<br>
as in instruments where the tone is generated by the string vibrating in a<br>
magnetic field such as electric guitars. The string according to the present<br>
disclosure may be used in all kinds of stringed musical instruments, such as<br>
guitars, violins, pianos, harps etc..<br>

Detailed description<br>
The different material properties of importance for the performance of a music<br>
string are the yield and tensile strength, the resistance to relaxation, the corrosion<br>
resistance, the shape, the surface finish, and, for electrical instruments, the<br>
electromagnetic properties.<br>
The string in accordance with the present invention has a prolonged service life<br>
compared to commonly used strings. In this context, service life is considered to<br>
be the time up to breakage of the string or the time to when the musician feels<br>
the need to change the string due to deteriorated properties of the string, such as<br>
a toss of tuning stability or tone quality.<br>
Precipitation hardening stainless steels are corrosion resistant ferrous alloys that<br>
have been strengthened by precipitation hardening, The precipitation hardening<br>
produces a multiphase structure resulting in an increased resistance to<br>
dislocation motion and hence greater strength or hardness. These types of steel<br>
can generally be found in applications such as corrosion resistant structural<br>
members.<br>
Resulting from the materials selection, a string according to the present<br>
disclosure has a high mechanical strength, such as a tensile strength of at least<br>
1800 MPa when in a diameter of 0,33 mm and in cold drawn condition. Also, the<br>
tensile strength is at least 2500 when in a diameter of 0,254 mm and in heat<br>
treated condition, i.e. aged. Furthermore, it has a resistance to relaxation which<br>
does not necessitate a retiring more frequently than once every 18 hours when<br>
played on under normal conditions, More specifically, the precipitation hardening<br><br>
stainless steel has a resistance to relaxation sufficient to necessitate retuning<br>
less than once every 24 hours.<br>
Moreover, the string according to the present disclosure is resistant to corrosion<br>
caused by the environment or substances transferred to the string during its use.<br>
As a consequence, the string does not need to be coated for improved protection<br>
and maintains fts bright surface, and thus its acoustic characteristics over time.<br>
The common methods used to assess the corrosion resistance of carbon steel<br>
and stainless steel differ substantially, which makes a direct comparison difficult<br>
based on lab tests. However, carbon steel rusts strongly in sweat water, and<br>
even more so in chloride containing waters. Stainless steels on the other hand<br>
resist pure water but may be subject to pitting corrosion in chloride containing<br>
water. The corrosion process is accelerated if the chloride content and/or the<br>
higher temperature are high. For its strength level, the precipitation hardening<br>
stainless steel of the invention is quite resistant In aqueous solutions and<br>
performs better than, e.g., stainless steel of type AIS1 304. This also means that It<br>
outperforms carbon steel music strings in this respect.<br>
A uniform shape and a smooth surface finish of the string are important for<br>
achieving a harmonic sound and a good feeling of the string when played. The<br>
acoustic properties of a string are difficult to quantify but are very important for<br>
how the musician and the listener experience the sound of the string. The<br>
perception of the acoustic sound of strings according to the present invention is<br>
similar to that of commonly used carbon steel strings.<br>
Suitable precipitation hardening stainless steels, to be used in music strings in<br>
accordance with the present invention, generally contain 10-20 percent by weight<br>
of Cr and 4-10 percent by weight of Nl.<br><br>
A precipitation hardening stainless steel suitable for use as music string could, for<br>
example, have the following composition in percent per weight:<br><br>
Examples of such stainless steels are UNS S48910, UNS S17700, UNS S17400<br>
and UNS S45500. According to a preferred embodiment, the precipitation<br>
hardening stainless steel is UNS S46910.<br>
The precipitation hardening stainless steel may comprise various additions for<br>
accomplishing precipitations. According to an embodiment of the invention, the<br>
precipitation hardening stainless steel comprises 0,5-1 % by weight of Ti such as<br>
in the case of UNS S46910 and UNS $45500. According to another embodiment<br>
of the invention, the stainless steel comprises 0,2-1,5 % by weight of Al such as<br>
in the case of UNS S17700 and UNS S46910. According to yet another<br>
embodiment, the steet comprises 0,1-0,6 % by weight of Ta + Mb as in the case<br>
of UNS S45500 and UNS S17400,<br>
An important criterion when selecting a suitable precipitation hardening stainless<br>
steel for a music string is the ability to manufacture wires of the material in order<br>
to produce the string. It is a prerequisite that the selected composition can be<br><br>
cold drawn to very fine diameters such as 0,254 mm or 0,33 mm without<br>
becoming brittle.<br>
The string Is produced by means of conventional cold drawing processes for the<br>
manufacturing of wire. The cold drawing process gives rise to formation of<br>
deformation-induced martensite which leads to increased mechanical strength<br>
and 3 more magnetic material, The amount of cold deformation is important for<br>
achieving the desired strength and magnetic properties of the wire.<br>
In order lo further improve the properties of the string, the precipitation hardening<br>
stainless steel may be subjected to a heat treatment at 400-550 °C, normally for<br>
up to 4 hours. This aging heat treatment produces a precipitation hardening of<br>
the material which substantially increases its tensile strength.<br>
The manufacturing processes for producing wire of precipitation hardening<br>
stainless steel result in strings of good surface finish, i.e. strings with a uniform<br>
and harmonious sound that are comfortable to play on.<br>
According to an embodiment, the string comprises a core wrapped with metal<br>
strands. In this embodiment, either the core or the wrapping consists of<br>
precipitation hardening material in accordance with the invention. It is also<br>
possible that both the core and the wrapping comprise precipitation hardening<br>
stainless steel.<br>
The string according to the present disclosure may be used in all kinds of<br>
stringed musical instruments, such as guitars, violins, pianos, harps etc. The<br>
string may be a single wire, but it may also be in the form of a wrapped or<br>
wounded string. The string may also be twisted.<br><br>
Example 1<br><br>
This alloy is standardized under US-standard AISl UNS S46910.<br>
Wires were cold drawn to diameters of 0,254 mm, 0,33 mm and 0,43 mm,<br>
respectively. One wire of each diameter was heat treated at a temperature of 475<br>
°C for 10 minutes, resulting in an increased strength and a further improved<br>
resistance to relaxation of the material.<br>
The yield and tensile strengths were measured by a tensile test in accordance<br>
with SS-EN10002-1 and compared to 8 different comparative examples of carbon<br>
steel strings. The approximate compositions and string diameters of the<br>
comparative examples are shown in Table 1, The yield (Rp0.2) and tensile (Rm)<br>
strength values are listed in Table 2 and are illustrated in Figure 1. It appears that<br>
the mechanical properties of the precipitation hardening stainless steel, both in<br>
the as-drawn and the as-aged condition, match well the characteristics of the<br>
conventional strings. The positive effect of aging is clearly shown in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
Example 2<br>
The relaxation resistance was tested by plucking 0,254, 0,33 mm diameter and<br>
0,43 mm diameter strings approximately 200 times per minute with a pick. The<br>
compositions are those of example 1. The test was performed over a 24 hour<br>
period. The plucking point of the pick was set at 18 cm from a force sensor<br>
connected to a computer. The total length of each string was 65 cm and the<br>
strings rested on two plastic pieces at each end point. The distance between<br>
each end point and its corresponding force sensors was 5 cm. The diameter and<br>
its corresponding tone frequency are given in Table 3 along with the original<br>
tension and the engineering stress of the strings,<br><br>
The results of the relaxation tests of strings with diameters 0,254 mm, 0,33 mm<br>
and 0,43 mm are shown in Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4 respectively. In Table<br>
4, the same results are listed in the form of the linear Equation 1, wherein y is the<br>
load applied, k is a constant, x is the time and y0 the initial load. The frequency<br>
loss is calculated based on a density of 7700 kg/m3,<br><br><br><br><br>
The lower the k-value, i.e., the slope of the linear equation for a given string, the<br>
better is its relaxation resistance. The results furthermore show that the<br>
precipitation hardening stainless steel in heat treated condition, i.e, aged, has<br>
better relaxation resistance compared to traditional carbon steel used in music<br>
strings. The strong positive effect of aging on the relaxation resistance is clearly<br>
demonstrated.<br>
The human ear can detect a change in tune frequency of 1 Hz, The string of<br>
Comparetive Example 7 had lost 1,5 N (corresponding to a frequency lost of<br>
approximately 2 Hz) after 24 hours which means that such a string must be<br>
retuned once every 12 hours. On the other hand, a string according to the<br>
Invention having with a corresponding diameter and heat treated condition had<br>
tost 0,6 N corresponding to a frequency lost of approximately 0,8 Hz, which in<br>
turn results in a need for retuning once every 30 hours.<br>
For comparison, a string according to the invention having a diameter of 0,254<br>
mm and being in heal treated condition had lost 0,3 N which corresponds to a<br>
frequency lost of approximately 0,68 Hz. This results in a need for retuning once<br>
every 35 hours,<br>
Example 3<br>
The magnetic resonance of the alloy of Example 1 was tested on a guitar and<br>
compared to that of Comparative Example 7. The strings were plucked ai a<br>
distance of 10 cm from the bridge and subjected to a force corresponding to the<br>
shear-breaking point of a 0,10 mm copper wire. The copper wire was looped<br>
perpendicularly around the plucked string and then pulled until reaching the<br>
breaking point. In this way the same force was applied for every test run. The<br>
breaking point of the copper wire must also be at the point of contact with the<br><br>
plucked string, if the copper wire broke at any other point the procedure was<br>
repeated. A series of five approved tests were done on each string, and the<br>
results are represented in graphs as per Figures 5 and 6, The result shows that<br>
the ageing process does not affect the magnetic properties of the material.<br>
Example 4<br>
Furthermore the magnetic weight of the material was tested and compared to<br>
Comparative example 4. To measure the amount of magnetic phase, a magnetic<br>
balance was used. The magnetic balance contains two major components, an<br>
electromagnet and a strain gauge. The electromagnet generates a strong<br>
inhomogenic magnetic field between two wedge-shaped poles where the test<br>
sample is placed. A magnetic string will be pulled down by the magnetic force.<br>
The force, which is proportional to the amount of magnetic phase, is then<br>
measured by the strain gauge. This measurement yields the saturation<br>
magnetization of the sample and by calculating the theoretical saturation<br>
magnetization for this steel it is possible to determine the amount of magnetic<br>
phase present in the sample, I.e., the magnetic weight. The values from the<br>
magnetic weight tests are illustrated in Table 5.<br><br>
It appears that the alloy according to the present Invention has a magnetism that<br>
is comparable to that of commonly used carbon steei wires, thus making the alloy<br>
particularly suitable for applications requiring a magnetic material, i.e., strings for<br>
electromagnetic pick-up instruments such as electric guitars.<br><br>
