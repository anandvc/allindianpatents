3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to methods for determining the amount of an amount in biological fluids. More particularly, the invention includes methods for measuring the glucose content of blood or other fluids.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The quantitative determination of analytes in biological fluids such as whole blood is of great importance in the diagnosing and treating of certain medical conditions. For example, determining the glucose level in the blood of diabetic individuals, who must frequently check the glucose level in their blood to regulate their diets and medication. Measuring the glucose content of blood can be done by several methods. One method employs an electrochemical biosensor. Another method provides a visual indication of the glucose content such as by developing a color by reaction of an indicator. The present invention is of the later type, although it may have application in electrochemical methods as well.<br>
Electrochemical methods have been described in many patents. They may be divided into several categories including coulometic, amperometric, and cyclic voltammetry. One recent published U.S. patent application is 2003/0094384Al. Japanese published application 2000171428A2 describes the preparation of a glucose electrolytic sensor.<br>
There have been many patents describing methods employing indicators that develop color or other measurable responses when they are chemically oxidized as the last step of a series of reactions. In general, such methods may be broadly divided into those that employ analyte oxidases (e.g., glucose oxidase) that those that employ analyte dehydrogenases (e.g., glucose dehydrogenase). The procedures used are similar, but they employ different enzymes, mediators and indicators.<br>
2<br><br>
Methods using glucose oxidase enzymes are taught in many US patents and patent applications. Representative are U.S. 4,211,845; U.S. 4,808,529; U.S. 5,116,729; U.S. 5,264,348; U.S. 5,620,863; and U.S. 2003/0077702 Al. These patents/patent application teach a method in which glucose is oxidized to glucose acid with the release of hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide is said to oxidize an indicator in the presence of a peroxide  to produce a measurable color, indicating the glucose<br>
content of the blood sample. Some recent patents suggest a process in which the glucose is converted first to gluconic acid and then to gluconolactone with the release of hydrogen peroxide. It has also been suggested that the gluconolactone is formed first and then hydrolyzed to gluconic acid. Regardless of which process scheme is correct, glucose oxidase enzymes have been used widely in dry strips and in other techniques for measuring the glucose contact of blood.<br>
Various indicators have been employed in glucose sensors, such as benzidine-type indicators and heterocyclic azines. For example, 3,3',5,5'- tetramethylbenzidine and syringaldazine, luminol, o-tolidine, o-dianisitine, among others. One family of indicators is that of tetrazolium dye precursors. Examples of patents describing such indicators include U.S. 5,126,275, U.S. 5,322,680, U.S. 5,300,637, U.S. 5,290,536, U.S. 5,360,595 and U.S. 6,586,199. Tetrazolium indicators are used in the invention to be described below.<br>
Of particular interest with regard to the present invention is the method described in U.S. 6,200,773 and its parent U.S. 5,902,731. In these patents, a test of the glucose content of blood employs glucose dehydrogenase (GDH), with NAD or PQQ or their derivatives, as a cofactor, a tetrazolium dye precursor, a diaphorase enzyme or an analog, and a nitrite salt. Figure 5 of the '773 patent is a diagram of the process by which glucose is detected by development of color from the reduction of the tetrazolium dye precursor to a formazan.<br>
3<br><br>
PQQ (pyrroloquinoline quinone or its derivatives or isomers) as a cofactor for glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) enzymes has been of recent interest, as is evident from the disclosures in U.S. 2002/0076751 Al; EP 1 167 519 Al; U.S. 6,103,509; and JP 11243949 A2. In general, these disclosures teach the genetic modification of glucose dehydrogenase enzymes that are said to provide improved performance in glucose sensors.<br>
The present inventors unexpectedly have found that a process similar to that discussed in U.S. 6,200,773 can be carried out in the absence of a mediator, such as the diaphorase enzyme. This finding makes possible a simpler method of detecting glucose in blood samples, as will be seen in the description of the invention below.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been discovered that certain glucose dehydrogenase - co-factor combinations can be used to provide a colorimetric response from tetrazolium indicators when they are in contact with glucose solutions but, without including the mediator that is normally required. In particular, PQQ dependent glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ-GDH) has been demonstrated to provide similar response to glucose, both with and without a mediator. Other quinone-dependent dehydrogenase enzymes are expected to provide similar performance with their corresponding donor compounds.<br>
In one aspect, the invention is a reagent solution for measuring the concentration of glucose in blood. A glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) dependent on pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) (or its derivatives or isomers) as a co-factor is used with a tetrazolium dye precursor, but without including a mediator such as PMS (phenazine methosulfate) or a diaphorase.<br>
In another aspect, the invention is a dry test strip containsing a GDH, PQQ (or a derivative or isomer) as a co-factor, and a tetrazolium dye precursor, but lacking the<br>
4<br><br>
usual mediator. The strip will be contacted with glucose-containing blood and the developed color measured and correlated with the glucose content.<br>
The invention also is an improved method of measuring the glucose content of whole blood using the test strips containing GDH and PQQ (or a derivative or isomer) as a co-factor, and a tetrazolium dye precursor in the substantial absence of a mediator.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 is a graph of the results of Example 1. Fig. 2 is a graph of the results of Example 2. Fig. 3 is a graph of the results of Example 3. Fig. 4 is a graph of the results of Example 4.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Measuring Glucose in Blood<br>
In the methods which employ glucose oxidase, those enzymes are reacted with glucose, producing oxidized glucose and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide oxidizes an indicator compound in the presence of a peroxidase. The oxidized indicator produces a color that is correlated with the glucose content of the blood sample.<br>
In the present invention, a glucose dehydrogenase is used, along with a co-factor and a tetrazolium dye precursor to produce a colored response proportional to the glucose content of the sample. Such reactions are normally described by the following sequence of reactions:<br>
5<br><br>
Glucose + GDH- co-factor0xid     Gluconolactone + GDH-co-factorrcd GDH-co-factorred + Mediatoroxid     GDH-co-factor0xid + Mediator rtd Mediatory + tetrazolium indicator     Mediator0Xui + Formazan<br>
According to this sequence of reactions, glucose is converted to gluconolactone while the dehydrogenase-co-factor is reduced and then reoxidized by a mediator for further reaction with available glucose. The mediator may be any one of those familiar to those skilled in the art, such as PMS (phenazine methosulfate), PES (phenazine ethosulfate), DCIP (2,6,-dichlorophenolindophenol), and ferrocene. The mediator has been considered to be necessary to obtain a useful response by reducing the tetrazolium indicator to formazan. However, in the present invention, a mediator is not needed and a useful response is obtained in its absence, as will be shown in the examples below.<br>
The inventors have found that the mediator is not required when the glucose dehydrogenase is classified as EC 1.1.99.17 (now ECl.1.5.2) (International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology; Nomenclature and Classification of Enzyme-Catalyzed Reactions; NC-IUBMB). Such enzymes are dependent on certain co-factors, in this instance the co-factor is pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) or derivatives or isomers thereof. Other glucose dehydrogenase enzymes are dependent on other co-1 enzymes or co-factors, such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), flavin adenine dinueleotide (FAD), and their analogs. The reason for the successful use of PQQ- dependent GDH in the substantial absence of a mediator is not understood at this time. While not being bound by theory, it may be associated with the ability of the tetrazolium salt to come in more direct contact with the enzyme and/or its capacity to be less diffusion limited with respect to the co-factor.<br>
6<br><br>
Thus, in the method of the invention it appears that the tetrazolium indicator is reduced by the reduced dehydrogenase-co-factor according to the following reaction sequence:<br>
Glucose + GDH- co-factoroxid     Gluconolactone + GDH-co-factorrt.d GDH-co-factorred + tetrazolium indicator     Formazan + GDH-co-factorOXid<br>
Dehydrogenases<br>
Glucose dehydrogenase enzymes are commercially available from Toyoba, Kyowa, Amano, Genzyme, Biozyme, among others and are either native enzymes or recombinant enzymes produced by classic fermentation and/or recombinant methods. In order to be effective, dehydrogenases require a co-factor, such as NAD, FAD and PQQ and their derivatives or isomers. Since the dehydrogenases have been obtained from their suppliers in combination with a co-factor they have been characterized by their suppliers and their nature is not fully known at this time. Combinations of dehydrogenase enzymes with known co-factors have been tested, with the results shown in the examples. As will be seen, PQQ-dependent GDH enzymes did not require the presence of a mediator.<br>
The present inventors discovered that glucose dehydrogenase dependent on PQQ (or derivatives or isomers) did not require a mediator in order to measure reaction with glucose in the presence of a tetrazolium salt indicator. They believe that other dehydrogenase enzymes with quinones as acceptor (EC 1.1.5 class) may behave similarly in oxidizing alcohols, or other CH-OH donor compounds.<br>
Mediators<br>
It has been considered necessary to include in a test system a mediator to reoxidize the reduced dehydrogenase-co-factor after the reaction with glucose to form the<br>
7<br><br>
corresponding lactone. A diaphorase or PMS (phenazine methosulfate) are typical mediators. It is a feature of the present invention that a mediator is not needed. As will be shown in the examples below, the new reagent system will be seen to behave in a similar manner whether or not mediators are included.<br>
Tetrazolium Indicators<br>
Tetrazolium indicators are generally described in U.S. patents mentioned earlier. In U.S. 6,200,773 certain tetrazolium dye precursors are listed as being particularly useful in reactions with dehydrogenase-co-factor combinations. Among them is the tetrazolium compound designated WST-4, used in the examples below.<br>
Example 1 <br>
Detection of Glucose with Non-NAD-dependent Glucose Dehydrogenase<br>
and WST-4<br>
A strip of 0.8um polyethersulfone membrane was dipped in a solution containing 370 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7, 0.5% polymer (e.g. Teleostatin), surfactants (e.g., 0.1% Cremaphor EL and 0.2% Triton X305), 5.5 mg of Non-NAD(P)-dependent Glucose dehydrogenase [a quinone-dependent GDH designated EC 1.1.99.17 (now EC 1.1.5.2)] from Toyobo, 800 U/mg, and 60 mM of indicator (WST-4 from Dojindo), but containing no mediator.<br>
Glucose samples were prepared from 40% hematocrit whole blood samples and the concentration measured using the YSI glucose analyzer (Yellow Springs Instruments) as follows:<br>
8<br><br>
a)	0 mg/dL human plasma<br>
b)	48 mg/dL human plasma<br>
c)	101 mg/dL human plasma<br>
d)	201 mg/dL human plasma<br>
e)	397 mg/ dL human plasma<br>
f)	607 mg/dL human plasma<br>
When the reagent strip was contacted with glucose solutions a change in color developed that was proportional to the glucose concentration added. The color change was measured after 50-second development time by using a reflectance-measuring device. The reflectance was converted to K/S, a linearizing function developed from the Kubelka-Munk equations. K/S is equal to (1-R2)/2R, where R is the measured reflectance. The response of each of two replicate glucose samples is shown in Figure 1.<br>
The results of Example 1 show that a measurable and substantially linear response was obtained even though no mediator (e.g., PMS) as described in the classic art of<br>
dehydrogenase based glucose sensors, was included in the reaction mixture.<br>
Example 2<br>
Comparison of Glucose Determination by Direct Detection<br>
to that of Classic Mediation<br>
A strip of polyethyleneterepthalate (PET, Melenex from Dupont) was coated with a mixture of buffer (0.25M phosphate, pH 7.4), and inactive ingredients {e.g., rheology modifying agents, opacifiers, and surfactants). In this example, a mixture included 0.6 g/L polyacrylate, 0.6g/L polyvinyl alcohol, 1.5 g/L titanium dioxide, l g/L calcium carbonate, 0.001 to 0.006% of Silwet L-7600, Gerepon T-77, Surfonyl DF37, and containing 120 m M indicator (e.g., WST-4) and 6 KU/ mL Non-NAD(P)-dependent Glucose Dehydrogenase (EC1 .1.99.17, now ECl.1.5.2 from Bayer, patent<br>
9<br><br>
pending). Another strip was coated with the same mixture to which 5 mM of mediator (PMS) was added. Whole blood plasma glucose samples were applied to samples of the above coated reagent and the change in color was measured as described in Example 1. Glucose samples were prepared from 40% hematocrit whole blood samples and the concentration of each measured using the YSI glucose analyzer (Yellow Springs Instruments) as follows:<br>
a)	1 mg/dL human plasma<br>
b)	56 mg/dL human plasma<br>
c)	112 mg/dL human plasma<br>
d)	224 mg/dL human plasma<br>
e)	448 mg/dL human plasma<br>
f)	678 mg/dL human plasma<br>
The mean reflectance of two replicates for each of the glucose samples was recorded at both 7 and 33 seconds after the sample was applied to the glucose reagent.<br>
The results of Example 2 (see Fig. 2) show that a measurable and substantially linear response was obtained with the direct mediation method and that the observed response was substantially the same as that of the classic mediation method. The speed of the detection was also demonstrated to be substantially the same as the classic detection method as is evidenced by the endpoint reflectance measured at test times of 7 seconds and 33 seconds.<br>
Example 3<br>
Example 2 was repeated except that a different tetrazolium salt indicator was used.<br>
Direct mediation with another tetrazolium salt was demonstrated by substituting an analog of HTC-45 (a thiazolyl tetiazolium salt of Bayer Corporation, see U.S. Patent<br>
10<br><br>
5,126,275, column 21) for WST-4 in Example 1. After a 7 second reaction time, a substantially linear dose response to glucose was demonstrated, as can be seen in Fig. 3.<br>
Example 4 (Comparative)<br>
A strip of 0.8um polyethersulfone membrane (Osmonics) was dipped in a solution containing NAD as a co-factor with NAD-dependent GDH (EC 1.1.1.47) and a tetrazolium salt indicator, but without a mediator. The treated strip was contacted with glucose solutions having known concentrations. It was found that substantially no response was measured, as can be seen in Fig. 4.<br>
