				<td>Single-dose plastic capsule for powdered coffee and the like <br>
Description<br>
The present indention relates to a single-dose capsule made of moulded plastic<br>
and intended for coffee and other alimentary raw matarial which are used for the<br>
preparation of beverages by means of percolation.<br>
A capsule consists essentially of a casing with a frustoconical shape which is<br>
filled with coffee powder (or other powdery xaw meterial) and has a peripheral edge<br>
onto which a sealing foil is applied. Said foil, at the time of use of the capsule in' a<br>
professional and/or domestic machine, for the preparation of espresso coffee and/or<br>
other hot beverages, is directed downwards, namely on the opposite side to the point<br>
of entry of the hot water under pressure into the capsule.<br>
As a typical example of the state of the art, the Applicant cites the European<br>
patent EP-A-0 521 510 where it is envisaged forming, with the said foil, the flat<br>
bottom of the capsule and creating zones of reduced thickness so as to favour tearing<br>
of the foil at the time of preparation of the beverage, under the pressure of me water<br>
which passes through the powdery raw material in a vertical direction of flow.<br>
The resultant percolated beverage is conveyed along inaccessible pipes inside<br>
the coffee machine and then dispensed.<br>
The use of conventional capsules - owing to their particular constructional<br>
design - has the drawback that, since it is not possible to ensure the absolute<br>
cleanliness of the said internal pipes, there is the risk of fermentation or putrefaction<br>
of the fatty substances contained in the beverage (in particular in coffee). The least<br>
negative consequence is an undesirable alteration of the taste of the beverage.<br>
Moreover, it is more difficult, compared to the use of loose coffee powder, to<br>
obtain the emulsincation of the fatty substances in the coffee - namely the creamy<br>
coffee texture which makes Italian-style espresso coffee so popular world-wide -<br>
precisely owing to the presence of said pipes.<br>
Other documents representing the state of art are EP-A-469 079,<br>
EP-A-512 148 and US-A-5 287 797.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a moulded-plastic capsule<br>
high-quality beverages to be obtained.<br>
These and other objects are achieved by providing a capsule having the<br>
characteristic features described hereinafter, as will be clarified by the following<br>
description of a non-exclusive embodiment with reference to the accompanying drawing<br>
in which :<br>
- Fig. 1 is three-dimensional view, from above, of an open capsule according<br>
to the invention;<br>
- Fig. 2 is a three-dimensional view from below;<br>
- Fig. 3 is a plan view from above; and<br>
- Fig. 4 is a cross-section through the said capsule along line A-A in Fig. 3.<br>
A capsule according to the invention consists of a casing 10 with a slightly<br>
frustoconical shape which is made by thermoforming a sheet of polypropylene for<br>
alimentary use. The casing 10 has a continuous upper peripheral edge 12 projecting<br>
outwards and a bottom non-projecting edge 14. The upper edge 12 is designed to be<br>
sealed with a foil 13 of plastic material and/or aluminium. A foil of this kind, as well as<br>
its function in single-dose containers of alimentary products, is well known per se to<br>
persons skilled in the art, so that it is not considered necessary to describe it in further<br>
detail.<br>
According to a characteristic feature of the invention, the end wall 16 of the<br>
casing 10 is inset with respect to the bottom edge 14; basically, as shown in detail in<br>
Fig.4, there exist at least two steps between the edge 14 and the outer surface 18 of the<br>
end wall 16. In this way, underneath the upper chamber 25, which contains the powdery<br>
raw material, a bottom chamber 30 is formed, said chamber being able to receive and<br>
convey the percolated beverage, as explained more fully below, and being closed by a<br>
second foil 17. This second foil is preferably formed by a triple layer of film combined<br>
with aluminium so as to ensure that the capsule is impermeable and hygienic, it not being<br>
considered necessary to describe said foil in greater detail for the same reasons given<br>
above in connection with the foil 13.<br>
According to another characteristic feature of the invention, the end wall 16<br>
of the casing 10 has, around a central core having an upper portion in the shape of conical<br>
cusp 20 and a substantially cylindrical lower portion 22, consisting of several longer<br>
cylindrical segments 31 separated from one another by shorter cylindrical segments<br>
32 (see Fig. 2), a plurality of orifices 24 which are distributed in segments<br>
separated by radial ribs 26 (see Figs. 2 and 4).<br>
The present capsule is used in a machine equipped with punching or drilling<br>
means able to create in the upper foil 13 a path (not shown) for the incoming<br>
pressurized hot water and a spout (also not shown) directly in the second foil 17,<br>
immediately before the start of the percolation of the beverage through the orifices<br>
24. Owing to the combined effect of the pressurized hot water fed from above into<br>
the capsule and the shape of the end wall 16, in particular the radial ribs 26, the<br>
beverage fills the abovementioned bottom chamber 30 with a turbulent movement<br>
which favours emulsification of the fatty substances. In this way, for example an<br>
Italian-style creamy coffee of excellent quality is obtained.<br>
Moreover, the beverage is dispensed - through the spout created in the second<br>
foil 17 - directly into an underlying cup or glass, without being conveyed through the<br>
traditional pipes inside the machine and consequendy without the risks mentioned<br>
hereinabove.<br>
Although the description provided hereinabove relates to a preferred<br>
embodiment, it is understood that the invention may be developed with different<br>
forms and variants which are included within the following claims.<br>
