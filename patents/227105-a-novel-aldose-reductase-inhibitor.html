				<td>ALDOSE REDUCTASE INHIBITOR<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel aldose reductase inhibitor. More particularly,<br>
the present invention relates to a novel aldose reductase inhibitor of formula I derived from<br>
cultures of Aspergillus niger CFR 1046 and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Diabetes mellitus and its disabling complications which include blindness, renal<br>
failure, limb amputation, myocardial infarction affect millions of people (Schumacher, M.P.<br>
Diabetes 44 (1995)1355-1361). In the absence of or in cases of insufficient insulin, glucose<br>
accumulates in the blood of diabetics. Certain cells such as those in the peripheral nerves, the<br>
lens of the eye, or parts of the kidneys, however, do not need insulin to get glucose. As a<br>
result, maximum damage such as blindness, neuropathy and kidney damage occurs in such<br>
sites in diabetics. Nerve damage in diabetes is largely caused by loss of the insulating myelin<br>
sheath around nerves, which in turn causes message transmission to be erratic and painful, or<br>
non-existent. The reason this occurs is that when glucose enters these cells, it is converted<br>
into sorbitol by the enzyme aldose reductase (Alditol:NADPr 1-oxidoredutase, EC 1.1.1.21)<br>
which catalyses the NADPH-linked reduction of a broad group of aldoses to respective<br>
alduronic acids (Wilson K.W., Boren KM and Gabbay K.H., Science 257 (1992) 3). Sorbitol<br>
is then slowly converted into fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase. Neither sorbitol nor<br>
fructose can cross the membrothe and leave the cell easily, thereby causing damage as they<br>
accumulate. The resulting changes include changes in osmotic pressures, alterations in redox<br>
state of pyridine nucleotides (increased NADH/NAIT ratio) and depleted intracellular levels<br>
of myoinositol (Larson ER, Lipinski CA and Sarges RMed Res Revs 8 (1988) 159-186).<br>
Since diabetics have larger than normal amounts of glucose in the blood, the damage<br>
can lead to the above-mentioned problems. Certain substances present naturally in foods,<br>
block aldose reductase and prevent cell damage. Vitamin C, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Licorice, and<br>
various citrus or other antioxidants, e.g. quercetin, are aldose reductase inhibitors (Kim H.Y.<br>
and Oh J.H., Biosci. Biotech. Biochem 63 (1999) 184-188). Inhibitors against these enzymes<br>
thus have a potential application in both the food and medical sector.<br>
Traditionally in Japan, some kampo medicines (traditional oriental herbal<br>
prescriptions) have long been used for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy (Aida, K.,Tawata,<br>
M.,Shindo, H.,Onaya, T.,Sasaki, H.,Yamaguchi, T.,Chin, M.,Mitsuhashi. Planta Med, 56<br>
(1990) 254-258). The authors investigated the components of Glycyrrhizae radix, a<br>
constituent of some kampo medicines, and isolated six compounds (GUs 9-17). Among these,<br>
GU-17, identified as isoliquiritigenin, had the most potent aldose reductase inhibiting<br>
activity.<br>
Isoliquiritigenin inhibited rat lens aldose reductase with an ICso of 3.2 x 10(-7) M,<br>
using DL-glyceraldehyde as a substrate. It inhibited sorbitol accumulation in human red<br>
blood cells in vitro, with an ICso of 2.0 x 10(-6) M. Isoliquiritigenin, when administered via<br>
an intragastric tube to diabetic rats, suppressed sorbitol accumulation in the red blood cells,<br>
the sciatic nerve, and the lens as effectively as ONO-2235. These results suggest that<br>
isoliquiritigenin may be effective in preventing diabetic complications.<br>
Among the natural compounds, flavonoid compounds such as quercetin, quercetrin,<br>
naringinin and hesperidin are reported to be useful and potent aldose reductase inhibitors<br>
(Aida, K., Tawata, M., Shindo, H., Onaya, T., Sasaki, H., Yamaguchi, T., Chin, M.,<br>
Mitsuhashi. Planta Med, 56 (1990) 254-258).<br>
The presently known chemically synthesized aldose reductase inhibitors are Tolrestat,<br>
a chemically synthesised inhibitor with an IC5o of 3.5 X 10"8 M; and Sorbinil (Hollis HD,<br>
Johnson JL and Werbel LM. JMedChem. 27 (1984) 255-256).<br>
Some inhibitors obtained through the fermentation route are Thiazocins obtained from<br>
the fermented broth of Actinosynnema sp (Ozasa T, Yoneda T, Hirasawa M, Suzuki K,<br>
Tanaka K, Kadota S and Iwanami M. J Antibiot 44 (1991) 768-773), Thermorubrin and 2-<br>
hydroxy acetic acid from Thermoactinomyces sp UTA 8 (Hayashi K, Dombou M, Sekiya M,<br>
Nakajima H J. of Antibiot. 48 (1995) 1345 - 1346), Salfredins from Cntcibulum sps<br>
(Matsumoto K, Nagashima K, Kamigauchi T, J of Antibiot. 48 (1995) 439-446) and YUA001<br>
from Corynebacterhtm sp (Bahn Y, Park J, Bai D, Takase S, Yu J, J of Antibiot. 51 (1998)<br>
902-907) which has an ICso of 1.8 mM against pig kidney aldose reductase.<br>
The search is constantly on for new sources of aldose reductase inhibitors from<br>
natural sources that are inexpensive and show better activity.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
It is an object of the invention to locate and identify new natural sources for aldose<br>
reductase inhibitors that are more economical and show better activity.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide new aldose reductase inhibitors that<br>
show improved activity and are obtained from natural sources.<br>

TAXONOMY<br>
Morphology<br>
The fungal mycelium on Czapek's solution agar had abundant erect and crowded<br>
conidial structures, which was brownish black in color. Conidial heads were divergent, dense<br>
and colonies were wrinkled on the reverse surface. Sclerotia were not observed.<br>
Cultural and physiological characteristics<br>
The growth characteristics of CFR 1046 on malt-extract-agar were similar to that of<br>
Czapek's solution agar. But the colonies were dark and less dense. The culture grew well at<br>
ambient temperature of 26°C, 30°C. Conidial walls were smooth and thick. The length of<br>
Conidiophores was 0.67-1.13 mm. Table 1 shows the growth of CFR 1046 in the presence of<br>
various carbon and nitrogen sources.<br>
Taxonomic position<br>
The strain of Aspergillus niger CFR 1046, isolated locally, was taken from the CFTRI<br>
Culture Collection. It was further characterized. The characteristics indicated that the strain<br>
belongs to Aspergillus niger group. According to the descriptions of Raper and Fennell<br>
(Raper KB and Fennell DT (1965) The Genus Aspergillus- The Williams and Wilkins Co,<br>
Baltimore, pp 293-310), the strain CFR 1046 is related to Aspergillus niger V. Tiegh.<br>
FERMENTATION<br>
Stock Culture and Flask Fermentation<br>
Strain CFR 1406 was propagated on Potato Dextrose Agar (Hi Media Mumbai, India)<br>
slant composed of soluble starch 0.4 % and glucose 2 %. After incubation for 4 days at 30°C,<br>
a portion of the mature agar slant was inoculated into 100 ml of Potato Dextrose in a 500 ml<br>
Erlenmeyer flask and incubated at 30°C on a rotary shaker at 250 rpm. The inoculated flasks<br>
were incubated for 8 days at 30°C.<br>
Isolation and Purification<br>
Fermented broth (3 L) was treated with ethyl acetate (2 liter) for two hours followed<br>
by cheesecloth filtration to remove the biomass and the organic extract was separated from<br>
the broth by a separating runnel. This organic extract was dried over anhydrous sodium<br>
sulfate and concentrated in vacuo to afford a crude solid (0.42 gm). The residue was resuspended<br>
in chloroform and dry coated on 0.5 gms silica gel. This was loaded on a 5 gm<br>
(60-120 mesh) silica gel column (25 X 1 cm;) packed in hexane. The compound was eluted<br>
as a deep yellow band in chloroform:ethylacetate (9:1) fraction. Solvent was evaporated in<br>
vacuo to obtain 25 mgs of amorphous red powder, designated as Compound 1.<br>
Physico-chemical properties<br>
Compund 1, is an amorphous red powder and is soluble in methanol, ethyl acetate,<br>
dimethyl sulphoxide, diethyl ether, sodium bicarbonate solution, sodium carbonate solution<br>
and sodium hydroxide solution, slightly soluble in chloroform and hexane, but insoluble in<br>
water. The physico-chemical properties are given in Table 2. EI-MS spectra of the compound<br>
showed the molecular ions at m/z 205. The fragmentation analysis is also given in Table 2.<br>
HPLC (Rt) : 4.5 min (column: RP-C18, 25 X 4.6mm, Mobile phase: methanol, 0.5ml/min,<br>
265 nm)<br>
GC (Rt): 21.4 min (column: HP-5, Conditions: 50°C, 2 min, 10°C/min; 220°C, 2min,<br>
15°C/min;270°C, 20min.)<br>
The molecular formula of compound was established as CieHigOs, based on the mass<br>
spectra and 'H and 13C-NMR spectra (Table 3).<br>
Carbon-13 assignments are interchangeable.<br>
The physico-chemical data are summarized in Table 2. The LJV spectra of this<br>
substance had an absorption maxima at pH 3.8 are 232, 265, 310 and at pH 9.0 are 226, 286,<br>
355. The IR spectrum (Fig 1) of compound 1 shows typical absorption bands at 3437, 2995,<br>
2912 and 1660 cm"1. The 'H-NMR spectral data (Fig 2) of this compound and the 13C-NMR<br>
spectral data (Table 3 and Fig 2) and the Mass fragmentation Spectra (Fig 3) of the<br>
compound are given<br>
Structure determination<br>
The spectral characteristics and other properties of the compound isolated are shown<br>
in Table 2 and Table 3 above. The compound exhibits UV absorption at 232 nm, 265 nm and<br>
310 nm at pH 3.8. However at pH 9.0, while the Kmax at 232 nm showed a hypochromic shift<br>
to 226 nm both the 265 nm peak and 310 nm peak showed a bathochromic shift to 286 nm<br>
and 355 nm respectively. This indicates that there are ionizable phenolic groups on aromatic<br>
rings. The broad IR absorption at 3437 Cm"1 indicates -OH stretching frequencies. The peak<br>
at 2995 Cm"1, 2912 Cm"1 indicate aromatic C-H stretching. A broad ketonic absorption bond<br>
in IR spectrum at 1660 Cm"1 indicating probably hydrogen bonded keto group. Another<br>
conformation of stretching was obtained from two dimensional heteronuclear multiple<br>
quantum coherence transfer spectra (2DHMQCT). An aliphatic group corresponding to six<br>
carbons were observed at 0.8 ( CH3) and 0.8, 1.0, 1.2 and 1.5 (5 -CH2) ppm. The -CH2 at 1.0<br>
ppm might have come from -CH2 group of hexyl moiety being subjected to ring current<br>
effect of the aromatic group present. Three separate single signals were seen at 6.0, 6.5 and<br>
6.95 ppm, indicating aromatic protons. The corresponding 13C signals are as follows;<br>
29.9 (-CH3), 31.5 (-CH2), 39.9 to 40.9 (-CH2), 111.1 (Ar-H), 108.9 (Ar-H), 108.2<br>
(Ar-H), 190.8 (CO), 181.7 (CO), 164.4 (CAT OH), 163.6 (CAT OH), 160.9 (CAT O). EMS<br>
analysis showed a parent peak at 205 (M+) other fragment peaks like 178 (M+~CO), 150 (-<br>
CO), 108 and 81 clearly indicating aromatic group of the molecule. However, parent ion peak<br>
was distinctly missing. Based on EIMS and 2DHMQCT analysis the proposed structure is<br>
given below:<br>
