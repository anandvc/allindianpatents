				<td>"MACROLIDES WITH ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY"<br>
***********************<br>
The present invention relates to macrolides with anti-inflammatory activity and, more particularly, it relates to des-dimethylamino macrolide derivatives with anti-inflammatory -    activity, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and pharmaceutical compositions containing them as active ingredients.<br>
It is known that many antibiotics, in particular the class of macrolides with 14 atoms derived from erythromycin, are endowed with anti-inflammatory properties in addition to the antibacterial activity [Clin. Immunother., (1996), 6, 454-464].<br>
Erythromycin is a natural macrolide (The Merck Index, XII edition, n° 3720, page 625) that has had a very broad clinical use in the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, by some Gram-negative ones or by Mycoplasma.<br>
Recently the interest of the scientific community has been focused on the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory component of erythromycin and derivatives [Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, (1998), 41, Suppl.B, 37-46],<br>
Such activity is well documented by both clinical studies and in vivo and in vitro experiments.<br>
For example, macrolides have proved to be effective in the therapy of inflammatory diseases such as panbronchiolitis [Thorax, (1997), 52, 915-918], bronchial asthma [Chest, (1991), 99, 670-673] and cystic fibrosis [The Lancet, (1998), 351, 420], or in animal models of inflammation such as, for example, the zymosan-induced peritonitis in mice [Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, (1992), 30, 339-348] and the neutrophil recruitment Induced by endotoxin in rat trachea [Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, (1994), 38, 1641-1643] or in in vitro studies on immune system cells, such as neutrophils [The journal of Immunology, (1997), 159, 3395-4005] and T-lymphocytes [Life Sciences, (1992), 51, PL 231-236] or in the modulation of cytokines, such as interleukin 8 (IL-8) [Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med., (1997), 156, 266-271] or interleukin 5 (IL-5) (jjp 0 775 489 and EP 0 771 564, Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd).<br>
The peculiar therapeutic efficacy of macrolides on diseases in which the conventional anti-"     inflammatory drugs, such as for example corticosteroids, have demonstrated to be ineffective<br><br>
[Thorax, (1997), 52, 915-918, already cited] justifies the high interest towards this new<br>
potential class of anti-inflammatories.<br>
Nevertheless the strong antibacterial activity of die conventional macrolides does not allow<br>
an enlarged use in die chronic treatment of inflammatory processes not due to pathogens<br>
because of the rapid onset of resistant strains..<br>
Therefore, it would be desirable to have new substances with a macrolide structure that show<br>
anti-inflammatory activities and, in the mean time, that are devoid of antibiotic properties.<br>
For a greater clarity we show the formula of erythromycin in which the numbering adopted<br><br>
Some classes of erythromycin derivatives endowed with a high anti-inflammatory activity<br>
are described in the literature.<br>
For example, in the already cited European patent applications in the name of Taisho<br>
derivatives of erythromycin modified at 3, 9, 11 and 12 position, as strong inhibitors of the<br>
syndiesis of IL-5 are claimed.<br>
N-alkyl derivatives of azithromycin, without cladinose and desosamine, of formula<br><br>
wherein <br>
Ri is hydrogen, a lower alkyl or a lower alkanoyl; R2, Rj and R4, the same or different, are<br>
hydrogen or a lower alkanoyl; are described as anti-inflammatories in EP 0 283 055 (Sour<br>
Pliva).<br>
The use of erythromycin as anti-inflammatory that acts by reducing the release of interleukin<br>
1 through the inhibition of the mammalian mdr-P glycoprotein is claimed WO 92/16226 in<br>
the name of Smith-Kline Beecham Corporation.<br>
Among the macrolide derivatives described in the literature a few are 3-desdimethylamino-9-<br>
oxyimino derivatives. The limited interest towards this class of compounds is justified by the<br>
fact that the relevance of the dimethylamino group for the activity of ribosomal binding<br>
typical of macrofides is known [Tetrahedron Letters, (1994), 35, 3837-3840].<br>
to      US      3.928.387      (Hoffmann-La      Roche      Inc.)      3"-desdimethylamino-3",4"-<br>
dehydroerythromycin A oxime is described, as intermediate useful for the preparation of die<br>
antibiotic 1745A/X.<br>
to EP 0 254 534 (Robinson, William S.) a very broad class of macrolides with antiviral<br>
activity is claimed. Among them the compound of formula<br><br><br>
whose correct chemical name is 3"-desdimethyIamino-3",4"-dehydroerythromycin A 9-0-<br>
methyloxime notwithstanding in the text of EP 0 254 534 is erroneously reported as des-<br>
dimethylaminoerythromycin 9-0-methyloxime (page 10, line 46) is described.<br>
Now we have found that by removing the dimethylamino group from the 3" position of<br>
desosamine of 9-oxyimino macrolides, compounds endowed with anti-inflammatory activity<br>
and essentially devoid of antibiotic properties are obtained.<br>
Therefore, object of the present invention are compounds of formula<br><br><br>
R is hydrogen or methyl;<br>
R, and Rj are both hydrogen or they together form a bond;<br>
R3 is hydrogen, a linear or branched CrC5 alkyl group, a benzyl group, optionally substituted<br>
by one or more substituents selected among nitro groups, hydroxy groups, carboxylic groups,<br>
amino groups, linear or branched C1-C5 alkyl groups,  CL-C4 alkoxycarbonyl groups,<br>
aminocarbonyl groups or ciano groups, or a chain of formula<br>
wherein <br>
A is hydrogen or a phenyl group optionally substituted by one or two substituents selected<br>
among nitro groups, hydroxy groups, carboxylic groups, amino groups, linear or branched<br>
CpCs alkyl groups, C]-C4 alkoxycarbonyl groups, aminocarbonyl groups or ciano groups, or<br>
a 5 or 6 membered heterocycle, saturated or unsaturated, containing from 1 to 3 heteroatoms<br>
selected among nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur, optionally substituted by one or two<br>
substituents selected among CrCs alkyl groups, phenyl groups, hydroxy groups, oxo (=0)<br>
groups, nitro groups, C1-C4 alkoxycarbonyl groups, aminocarbonyl groups, mono or di-Ct-<br>
C4-alkylaminocarbonyl groups, Ci-C.4-alkylcarbonyl groups;<br>
X and Y, the same or different, are O, S, SO, SO2 or NR4, in which R4 is hydrogen, a linear<br>
or branched C1-C5 alkyl group, a C1-C5 alkoxycarbonyl group, a benzyloxycarbonyl group;<br>
r is an integer from 1 to 6;<br>
m is an integer from 1 to S;<br>
n is an integer from 0 to 2;<br>
and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts;<br>
the compounds SMesdimethylaminc-S"^"-dehydroerythromycin Aoxime(R, and R2=bond;<br>
R=H; R3=H) and 3"-desdimethylamino-3",4"-dehydroerythromycin A 9-O-methyloxime (Ri<br>
and Ri= bond; R=H; R3=CH3) being excluded.<br>
A further object of the present invention is the use of the compounds 3 "-desdimethylamino-<br>
3",4"-dehydroerythromycin A oxime and 3"-desdimethylamino-3",4"-dehydroerythromycin A<br>
9-0-methyloxime as anti-inflammatories.<br>
The compounds of formula I are anti-inflammatory macrolides devoid of antibiotic activity<br><br>
and therefore they are useful in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. With the term linear or branched C1-C5 alkyl groups a group selected among methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl and isopentyl is meant. With the term 5 or 6 membered heterocycle, saturated or unsaturated, containing from 1 to 3 heteroatoms selected among nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur, heterocycles such as pyrrole, thiophene, furan, imidazole, pyrazole, thiazole, isothiazole, isoxazole, oxazole, pyridine, pyrazine, pyrimidine, pyridazine, triazole, thiadiazole and their partially o totally saturated Forms are meant.<br><br>
Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (I) are the salts<br>
with organic or inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, nitric,<br>
sulphuric, phosphoric, acetic, tartaric, citric, benzoic, succinic and glutaric acid.<br>
The compounds of formula I, object of the present invention, are prepared by following a<br>
synthetic scheme which comprises (a) the removal of the dimethylamino group at 3" position<br>
and (b) the optional functionalisation of the oxime.<br>
The removal of the dimethylamino group is performed by oxidation, pyrolisis and optional<br>
reduction, according to known methods. It is evident to the man skilled in the art that, in<br>
order to avoid interferences with the functional groups optionally present at R3 substituent,<br>
the removal of the dimethylamino group will be preferably accomplished starting from<br>
intermediates of formula .<br><br><br>
in which<br>
R and R3" have the already reported meanings are obtained;<br>
that by pyrolisis, optionally followed by reduction, respectively give the compounds of<br>
formula<br><br><br>
object of the present invention (I-R3=hydrogen or C1-C5 alkyl).<br>
According to common techniques, the compounds of formula I in which R3 is different from hydrogen can be prepared from the compounds of formula I-A and I-B in which R3" is hydrogen by functionalisation of the oxime.<br>
Generally the functionalisation is carried out by reaction with a compound of formula.<br>
R3"-W	(IV)<br>
in which R3" has a)J the meanings of R} apart from hydrogen and W is a leaving group, preferably a chlorine or bromine atom or a mesyl group.<br>
An alternative synthetic route particularly suited for the preparation of the compounds of formula I in which R3 is a chain of formula<br><br><br>
in which A, W and n have the already reported meanings;<br>
to give the compounds of formula I.<br>
The compounds of formula I in which Y is NR4 can be prepared according to the above<br>
reported synthetic route also by using an aldehyde of formula<br><br>
A-CHO	(VIII)<br>
in which A has the already reported meanings;<br>
in place of the intermediate of formula VII, subject to removal of the Z protecting group from the intermediate of formula VI.<br>
Moreover, the compounds of formula I in which R[=R2=H can be prepared by reduction of the corresponding compounds of formula I in which R| and Rj form a bond. The compounds of formula I, object of the present invention, are endowed with an anti¬inflammatory activity and are devoid of antibiotic activity.<br>
The pharmacological activity of the compounds of formula I has been evaluated by in vitro and in vivo tests in comparison with known macrolides, such as erythromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin, endowed with both. anti-inflammatory activity and antibiotic activity.<br>
The anti-inflammatory activity has been evaluated in vitro as inhibition of IL-8 release and of superoxide anion release (example 11) and in vivo as inhibition of LPS-induced neutrophilia after repeated administrations (example 12).<br><br>
Therefore, object of the present invention are pharmaceutical compositions containing a therapeutically active amount of a compound of formula I or of a salt thereof in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. With the aim to better illustrate the present invention the following examples are now given.<br>
Example I Preparation of [6-(2-hydroxy-ethylamino)-hexyl]-carbamic acid benzyl ester To a solution of (6-hydroxy-hexyl)-carbamic acid benzyl ester (25 g; 99.47 rrunoles), prepared as described in WO 96/18633, in CH2CI2 (350 ml), cooled with ice at about 10°C, at first a solution of KBr (1.18 g; 9.94 mmoles) in water (20 ml) and TEMPO (0.155 g; 0.994<br><br>
mmoles) and then, dropwise in about 15-20 minutes keeping the temperature at 10-12°C, a<br>
solution prepared with NaHC03 (7.5 g; 89.28 mmoles) and NaCIO (4.5 % water solution;<br>
197 ml; 125 mmoles) were added.<br>
15 minutes after the end of the dripping, the phases were separated and the aqueous phase<br>
was extracted once with CH2CI2 {100 ml). The collected organic extracts were washed twice<br>
with brine (20% NaCl) and dried on sodium sulphate.<br>
3 A molecular sieves (30 g) and then, by fast dropwise and by cooling with water and ice, a<br>
solution of 2-aminoethanol (35.9 ml; 0.597 moles) in ethanol (600 ml) were added to the<br>
obtained solution (about 800 ml).<br>
Ended the dripping the mixture was kept under stirring at room temperature for 2 hours and<br>
then filtered.<br>
NaBH4 (4.54 g; 120 mmoles) was portionwise added to the obtained solution, cooled with<br>
water and ice, under stirring in a nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
At the end of the addition, the reaction mixture was kept under stirring at room temperature<br>
for 2 hours and men the solvent was evaporated.<br>
The residue was collected with water and ethyl acetate and the phases were separated, again<br>
extracting twice the aqueous phase with ethyl acetate.<br>
The collected organic extracts were washed with brine (20% NaCl), dried on sodium<br>
sulphate and concentrated up to obtained an oily residue that was inclined to solidify.<br>
The residue was triturated with hexane, filtered and washed with a mixture of hexane and<br>
ethyl ether, furnishing [6-(2-hydroxy-ethylamino)-hexyl]-carbamic acid benzyl ester (26.22<br>
g; yield 89%) as a white solid.<br>

ethyl acetate (85.5 ml) and IN NaOH (128 ml; 0.128 moles) were simultaneously dropwise added to a solution of [6-{2-hydroxy-ethylamino)-hexyl]-carbamic acid benzyl ester (31.5 g; 0.107 moles), prepared as described in example 1, in a mixture of water (87 ml), IN NaOH (17 ml) and ethyl acetate (180 ml), cooled at 0-5°C, controlling temperature and pH (about<br>
8).<br>
At the end of the dripping, the reaction mixture was kept under stirring for 30 minutes at 0-<br>
5°C, then the cooling was removed and further IN NaOH (15 ml) was added, in order to<br>
bring again the pH at 8, then leaving under stirring at room temperature overnight.<br>
The phases were separated and the aqueous phase was extracted once again with ethyl<br>
acetate. The collected organic extracts were washed with brine, dried on sodium sulphate and<br>
concentrated under vacuum up to obtain an oily residue.<br>

(Rockville, Md) and grown in Medium   199, mod. Earle"s salts (GIBCO, Life<br>
Technologies, Grand Island, N.Y.), supplemented with 20% Foetal Calf Serum<br>
(GIBCO), 100 U/ml of penicillin and 100 Dg/ml of streptomycin (SIGMA, St. Louis,<br>
MO) in wet atmosphere with 5% C02 at 37°C.<br>
The cells were cultivated on 96 well plates up to obtain a confluent monolayer.<br>
The compounds to be evaluated were dissolved in DMSO at 10"ZM and diluted with<br>
culture medium.<br>
The compounds were pre-incubated with the cells I hour before the challenge.<br>
The release of IL-8 was induced by adding 0.66 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharide B (E.<br>
coli 055:B5, Difco, Detroit, Mi) in a final volume of 200 Dl.<br>
After one night, the supernatant was collected for the IL-8 test.<br><br>
The specific immunoreactivity for IL-8 in the culture supernatant was measured with ELISA kit (Amersham, UK).<br>
Results were expressed as the highest obtainable inhibition (efficacy) and, whether possible, as the concentration at which 50% of such effect (ICS0) is obtained. B)      Release of superoxide anions<br>
Neutrophils were separated from venous blood of healthy volunteers by centrifugation<br>
on Ficoil-Hypaque, followed by sedimentation on 6% dextrane and osmotic lysis of<br>
erythrocytes. Neutrophils were then washed and resuspended in a medium made of<br>
RPMI-1640 supplemented with 5% foetal calf serum and 1.34 mmoles/1 of disodium<br>
dihydrate EDTA. The cells were maintained for 24 hours at 4°C and before the test the<br>
suspension was centrifugated and resuspended  in HBSS  (Hanks"   balanced salt<br>
solution). The vitality and the purity of die neutrophil preparation was verified by<br>
dyeing with Trypan blue and Turk blue.<br>
The superoxide anions were measured by using Lucigenin (bis-N-methylacridinium<br>
nitrate)-enhanced chemiluminescence technique.<br>
Neutrophils (2 x 106 cells/ml) were pre-incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C in 900 Dl of<br>
HBSS with and without the tested compound (reading system).<br>
The production of superoxide anions was measured with a Lumac/3M bio-counter<br>
after addition of 100 Dl of a solution in HBSS of Lucigenin (2 mmoles/1) and N-<br>
formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (FLMP) as stimulating agent at the<br>
concentration of 1 x 10"5 M to the reading system.<br>
FLMP was dissolved in DMSO (1 x 10"2 M) and further diluted in HBSS. The<br>
compound to be tested was dissolved in DMSO at the concentration of 10"2 M. Lower<br>
concentrations, in DMSO, were prepared from that solution, and tested. The DMSO<br>
amount present in the reading system was lower than 1%.<br>
The luminosity values obtained at the peak, for each tested concentration of the<br>
compound,   were  transformed   in   inhibition  percentage  in  comparison  with die<br>
reference.<br>
The concentration able to inhibit the production of suDeroxide anion at 50% flC™} was<br><br>
calculated from the obtained "dose-response" curve. In the following table the results obtained for some compounds of formula I representing the all class in comparison with erythromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin are reported.<br><br>
Example 12 In vivo pharmacological activity<br>
•	Animals<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 200 and 300 g were used.<br>
The rats used in the experiments were not evidently infected. The animals were maintained<br>
in standard conditions for 7 days before being sacrificed.<br>
•	Endotoxin administration<br><br>
LPS (E. coli lipopolisaccharide) (endotoxin; 055:B5 serum-type; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in saline sterile solution and was administered by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) at a dose of 6 mg/kg (1 ml/kg). Analogously the saline solution and/or the carrier (saline solution + 0.5% Tween 20) were injected into the control animals.<br>
•	Compound administration (prophylactic treatment)<br>
Each compound was administered by i.p. injection twice a day for 6 days, the 7th day 1 hour before and 5 hours after LPS administration. The compounds were suspended with 0.5% Tween 20 in the saline solution.<br>
•	Bronchoalveolar lavage<br>
After 24 hours from the LPS injection rats were sacrificed with an overdose of nembutal (100 mg/kg i.p.). The trachea was incannulated and the lung was washed by instilling two 5 ml aliquots of PBS (phosphate buffer saline) at 37°C and the fluid was immediately removed. The fluid was again injected and the procedure was altogether repeated three times for each aliquot.<br>
•	Cell counting and differentiation<br>
200 jil of BALF (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) were diluted in 1 ml of cold water and 19 ml of Isoton. The overall number of celts was counted twice by using Contraves autotyser 800. When the total number was lower than 2000, BALFs were centrifugated at 800 rpm for 10 minutes in order to separate the cells from the supernatant. The supernatants were discharged and the cells resuspended in a small amount of PBS. For the cytological evaluation, 50 u.1 of the solution with the resuspended cells were centrifugated for 1 minute at 1300 rpm by using a Shandon Cytospin centrifuge. The slides were fixed in acetone and dyed with DiffQuick. The differential counts of cells were performed on each slide by counting 200 cells at random; cellular types were classified as neutrophils, eosinophils and mononuclear cells according to morphological standard criteria.<br>
In the following table the results obtained with some compounds of formula I representative of the all class are reported.<br>
