Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula (1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as hereinbefore defined for use in therapy.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides the use of a compound of formula (1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as hereinbefore defined in the manufacture of a medicament for use in therapy.<br>
. In the context of the present specification, the term "therapy" also includes "prophylaxis" unless there are specific indications to the contrary. The terms "therapeutic" and "therapeutically" should be construed accordingly.<br>
Prophylaxis is expected to be particularly relevant to the treatment of persons who have suffered a previous episode of, or are otherwise considered to be at increased risk of, the disease or condition in question. Persons at risk of developing a particular disease or condition generally include those having a family history of the disease or conditicjn, or<br>
those who have been identified by genetic testing or screening to be particularly susceptible to developing the disease or condition.<br>
The invention further provides a method of effecting immunosuppression (e.g. in the treatment of allograft rejection) which comprises administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as hereinbefore defined.<br>
The invention still further provides a method of treating, or reducing the risk of, an airways disease (e.g. asthma or COPD) in a patient suffering from, or at risk of, said disease, which comprises administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (1) or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof as hereinbefore defined.<br>
For the above-mentioned therapeutic uses the dosage administered will, of course, vary with the compound employed, the mode of administration, the treatment desired and the disorder indicated. However, in general, for effecting immunosuppression, the daily dosage of the compound of formula (1) will be in the range from 0.1 mg/kg, preferably from 0.3 mg/kg, more preferably from 0.5 mg/kg and stillmore preferably from 1 nig/kg up to and including 30 mg/kg. For the treatment of airways diseases, the daily dosage of the compound of formula (1) will typically be in the range from 0.001 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg.<br>
The compounds of formula (1) and pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof may be used on then- own but will generally be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical . composition in which the formula (1) compound/salt/solvate (active ingredient) is in association with a pharmaceutically-acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. Depending on the mode of administration, the pharmaceutical composition will preferably comprisi from 0.05 to 99 %w (per cent by weight), more preferably less than 80 %w, e.g. from 0.10 to 70 %w, and even more preferably less than 50 %w, of active ingredient, all percentages by weight being based on total composition.<br>
Thus, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as hereinbefore defined, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or cairier.<br>
The invention further provides a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention which comprises mixing a compound of formula (1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as hereinbefore defined, with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be administered topically (e.g. to the lung and/or airways or to the skin) in the form of solutions, suspensions, heptafluoroalkane aerosols and dry powder formulations; or systemicaUy, e.g. by oral administration in the form of tablets, capsules, syrups, powders or granules, or by parenteral administration in the form of solutions or suspensions, or by subcutaneous administration or by rectal administration in the form of suppositories or transderrftally.<br>
The ability of compounds which can inhibit PMA/ionomycin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation can be assessed, for example using the procedure set out below:<br>
The invention will now be illustrated in the following Examples in which, unless otherwise stated:<br>
(i) evaporations were carried out by rotary evaporation m yacuo and work-up procedures were carried out after removal of residual solids such as drying agents by filtration;<br>
(ii) operations were carried out at ambient temperature, that is in the range 18-25QC and under an atmosphere of an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen;<br>
(iii) yields are given for illustration only and are not necessarily the maximum attainable;<br>
(iv) the structures of the end-products of the formula I were confirmed by nuclear [generally proton) magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectral techniques; proton magnetic resonance chemical shift values were measured on the delta scale and peak nultiplicities are shown as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; m, multiplet; br, jroad; q, quartet, quin, quintet;<br>
y) intermediates were not generally fully characterised and purity was assessed by thin ayer chromatography (TLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass ipectrometry (MS), infra-red (IR) or NMR analysis;<br>

Pharmacological Data<br>
Inhibition of PMA/ionomycin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation<br>
The assay for PMA/ionomycin-stimulated PBMC proliferation was performed in 96-well flat-bottomed microtitre plates. Compounds were prepared as lOmM stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide. A 50-fold dilution of this was prepared in RPMI and serial dilutions were prepared from this solution. lOjJl of the 50-fold diluted stock, or dilutions of it, were added to the well to give concentrations in the assay starting at 9.5(JM and going down. Into each well was placed 1 x 105 PBMC, prepared from human peripheral blood from a single donor, in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% human serum, 2mM glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (0.5ng/ml final concentration) and ionomycin (500ng/ml final concentration) were added to these cells in supplemented RPMI 1640 medium (as above) so that the final volume of the assay was 0.2ml. The cells were incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere at 5% carbon dioxide for 72 hours. 3H-Thymidine (0.5pCi) was added for the final 6 hours of the incubation. The level of radioactivity incorporated by the cells was then determined and this is a measure of proliferation.<br>
The compounds of the Examples were found to exhibit an lAso value of less than 1x10"* M in the above test. Examples 3,7 and 12 had a PIAso of 82; 7.6 and 8.8 respectively in the above test.<br><br><br>
