				<td>A Process for Preparing Ester Oxazolidine Compounds and Their Conversion<br>
to FlorFenicol<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present Invention relates generally to a new process for preparing oxazolidine protected aminodiol compounds. These compounds are useful intermediates in the process for making Florfenicoi.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Florfenicoi is a broad spectrum antibiotic of Formula I<br><br>
It has wide spread application in veterinary medicine for the treatment of both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria as well as rickettsial Infections. Florfenicoi is also known as [R-(R*t S*)]-2,2-DichIoro-N-[1"(fluoromethyl)-2-hydroxy-2-[4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]ethyl]acetamide.<br>
Commonly-assigned U.S. Patent No. 5,663,361, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, describes the synthesis of Florfenicoi intermediates and their use in processes for making Florfenicoi. The primary advantage discussed therein is that the process eliminated the prior art's requirement to isolate the aminodiol sulfone (ADS) from the reaction vessel before proceeding with the Florfenicoi synthesis.<br>
More recently, U, S. Patent 2005/0075506 A1 described a process for preparing a compound of Formula II that is useful as an intemriediate In the synthesis of Florfenicoi.<br><br><br>
The process called for reacting the hydrochloride salt of an optically pure aminodiol compound of Formula III with acetone followed by acetyl chloride to give a compound of Formula 11, The compound of Formula II is then reacted further to give Florfenicol of Formula L<br><br>
A major drawback of the process disclosed in 2005/0075506 A1 is the use of the aminodiol starting material of Fonnula ill. The aminodiol compound of Formula III is expensive. It is also difficult to isolate and handle due to its amphoteric nature,<br>
The present invention addresses this shortcoming and provides a still further alternative method of preparing useful intermediates included in the synthesis of Florfenicol.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention includes a process for preparing an oxazolidine protected aminodiol compound of Formula V:<br><br><br>
wherein:<br>
R1 is hydrogen, methylthio, methylsulfoxy, methylsulfonyl, fluoromethylthio, fluoromethylsulfoxy, fluoromethylsulfonyl. nitro, fluoro, bromo, chloro, acetyl, benzyl, phenyl, halo substituted phenyl, C1-6 alkyl, C1-6 haloalkyi, C3-8 cycloalkyL, C2-6 alkenyl,<br><br><br>
halogens, C1-6 alkyl or C1-6 alkoxy. Preferably. Ry is CH2CI, CHCI2. CCI3. CH2Br, CHBr2, CBr3. CH2F, CHF2, or CF3.<br>
In one embodiment, the process includes the steps of:<br>
a)	reacting a compound of Formula VI:<br>
wherein: <br>
R1 is as defined above and R5 is hydrogen, C1-6 alkyl, C3-8 cycloalkyi, benzyl, phenyl or C1-6 phenylalkyl, in a vessel with a reducing agent in an alcoholic solvent to form an aminodiol compound of Formula VII:<br><br>
wherein R1 is as defined above;<br>
b)	reacting the aminodiol compound of Formula VII in the vessel without<br>
Isolation (ie., in situ) with an oxazolidine forming reagent to form a compound of<br>
Formula Vlil:<br><br>
wherein R1 R2 and R3 are as defined above; and<br><br>
c)       reacting the compound of Formula VIII In the vessel without isolation (ie., in situ) with a first N-acylating agent to form an oxazolidine protected aminodiol compound of Formula V.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the process includes the steps of:<br>
a)	reacting a compound of Formula VI in a vessel with an oxazolidine<br>
forming reagent to form the compound of Formula XIV:<br><br>
wherein Ri, R2. R3 and R5 are as defined above;<br>
b)	reacting the compound of Formula XIV in the vessel without isolation (/.e., in situ) with a reducing agent in an alcoholic solvent to form the compound of Formula VIII;<br>
c)	reacting the compound of Formula VIII in the vessel without isolation (i.e., in situ) with a third N-acylating agent to form an oxazolidine protected aminodiol compound of Formula XII:<br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3 and R7 are as defined above;<br>
d)	fluorinating the compound of Formula XII with a fluorinating agent in<br>
the presence of an organic solvent to obtain the compound of Formula XIII:<br><br><br>
wherein R1, R2. R3 and R7 are as defined above;<br>
e)	selectively hydrolyzing the compound of Formula XIII with an acid or<br>
base catalyst to form the compound of Formula XI:<br><br>
wherein R1 and R7 are as defined above; and<br>
f)	if necessary, purifying the compound of Formula XI with a mixture of a<br>
C1-10 alkyl mono, di or tri alcohol and water to form the pure compound of Formula<br>
XI,<br>
Applicants have now surprisingly found significant processing advantages for forming the oxazolidine protected aminodiol compounds of Formula V and Formula XIL  The compounds of Formula V, or specifically Formula II, are obtained when an ester precursor to the aminodiol free base compound of Formula III are used as starting materials. Such esters generally correspond to Formula VI, and the ester of Formula IV is one particularly preferred ester:<br><br>
The use of the esters of Formulas IV and VI generates the expensive free base starting material of Formula ill in situ, thereby eliminating the need to isolate<br><br>
this difficult to Isolate compound. Yield losses for the free base starting material of Formula III due to Isolation are thus eliminated with resulting increased yield and lower cost for the oxazolidine protected aminodiol compound of Formula V, or specifically the compound of Formula II.<br>
Applicants have also surprisingly found a more efficient process for making the compound of Formula XII by generating the compound of Formula XIV. After preparation of the compound of Formula XIV the compound can then be converted without isolation (i.e.Jn sHu) and in the same reaction vessel to the compound of Formula XII by reduction and acylation. The compound of Formula XII can then be converted to a compound of Formula XI, Florfenlcol being the most preferred compound.<br>
The present Invention thus has the advantage of being an efficient and economical process for preparing Florfenicol, its analogs and oxazolidine intermediates related thereto,<br>
