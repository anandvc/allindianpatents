Advantages of Instant Invention!<br>
1.	Less time required to assembly the dial (100) with compartment (200) by using snap fit (2), so it is increasing the production rate.<br>
2.	No screws (3) are required to assemble dial with compartment or light guide (200), so the cost of the product will decrease as number of components decrease.<br>
3.	The dial (100) assembled with compartment or light guide (200) by using the snap fit, so we can use the same dial (100) and the compartment (200) once again after the disassembly.<br>
4.	Very easy to assemble and disassemble the dial without any tool.<br>
5.	The Speedo or Tacho graduation offset can be avoided while assembling the dial (100) with compartment or light guide (200) by using snap fit at two places that is at centre and at periphery or circumferentially. This may be useful to avoid the problem during the pointer pressing and calibration of instrument cluster.<br>
The dial locking System contains the following components, which holds the dial (100).<br>
1.	Light Guide (or) Compartment(Refer Figure 2)<br>
2.	Dial. ( Refer Figure 1)<br>
The assembly sequence is as follows below.<br>
1.	The light guide (or) compartment (200) is assembled with the PCB (6) by using snap fit (2) (Refer Figure No 10).<br>
2.	Assembling   of   LCD(4)   (after   diffuser   sheet   (5)   placement)   through   the compartment (or) light guide (200) by soldering with PCB (6) (refer figure 10)<br><br>
3.	Placing of dial (100) on the compartment (200) and matching the dial pinches<br>
(101,102) with slot (201,202) provided in the compartment (200), and then the dial<br>
(100) automatically will go 1mm in downwards (Refer Figure No.3 (b) and figure<br>
4).<br>
4.	Rotating the dial (100) about the center axis (7) of Tacho by 50 degrees (refer<br>
figure4(b)), so that dial (100) will get locked by over riding the profile (203,204)<br>
given in the compartment (Locking Area-1, refer figure 5(a) and 5(b)), and dial<br>
(100) is locked with compartment (200) by rubbing the circumference of the dial<br>
(100) by resting profile (205) and rests on the dial locking profile (106) of the dial<br>
(100) (Locking Area-2,refer figure 6(a) and 6(b)) at the same time.<br>
Disadvantages in Existing method<br>
1.	More time required to assemble the dial (100) with compartment (or) light guide (200) by using screw (3), so it is reducing the production rate.<br>
2.	Depending upon the dial size and its vibration range more number of screws are required to assemble the dial with the light guide, so the cost of the product will increase as number of components increases.<br>
3.	Since the dial is assembled with light guide by using the self tap screw (3), so we can't use the same screw and the compartment once again if we disassemble the assembly.<br>
The Speedo or Tacho graduation offset noticed while assembling the dial with light guide by using screw. This may produce some problem during the pointer pressing and calibration of instrument cluster.<br>
At unlocked stage of the dial (100) with the compartment (200).<br>
Figure 4 (b) shows the dial (100) is placed on the compartment (200) matching the dial pinches (101,102) of the dial (100) (refer figure 1) with the slots (201,202) (refer figure 2) of the compartment (200) (refer figure 2 (a) and 2(b)). The dial (100) is moved 1mm downwards by itself at central axis (7) as indicated by the arrow in figure 4(a). Referring to<br><br>
ftgure2 the resting profile (205) of the compartment (200) is aligned with the circumference of the dial (100).<br>
Locked stage of the dial (100) with the compartment (200)<br>
Locking areal:<br>
Referring to figure 5 the dial pinches (101,102) of the dial (100) and the slots (201,202) of the compartment (200) serves as locking area 1. As the dial (100) moved 1mm downward as shown refer figure 4(a) wherein downward direction is indicated by an arrow, it is rotated in counterclockwise direction for locking. The dial (100) is rotated about the central axis (7) at an angle of about 50 degrees (refer figure 4 (b)). During the rotation the dial pinches (101,102) of the dial (100) over rides the semicircular bulged profiles (203,204) facing downwards (refer figure 5 (a), downward direction is indicated by an arrow). The dial(100) gets locked with the compartment (200) when the dial pinches (101,102) complete the overriding of the semicircular bulged profile (203,204) using snap fit as shown in figure 5 (b).<br>
Locking area 2:<br>
Referring to Figure 6 the dial locking profile (106) of the dial (100) and resting profile (205) of the compartment (200) serves as locking area 2. When the dial (100) is rotated about central axis (7) in counterclockwise direction (refer figure 4(b)) it makes the resting profile (205) of the compartment (200) to rub the circumference of the dial (100) (refer figure 6 (a)). The resting profile (205) then rests on the dial locking profile (106) of the dial (100) (refer figure 6 (b)) forms snap fit and get locked when the rotation given to dial (100) is about 50 degrees.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
