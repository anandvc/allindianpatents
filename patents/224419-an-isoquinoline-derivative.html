The present, invention relates to a novel heterocyclic derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which have a hypoglycemic action, a blood hypolipidemic action, an insulin resistance-improving action and a PPAR {peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor)-activating action. The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the above-mentioned novel heterocyclic derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a hypoglycemic agent, a hypolipidemic agent, an insulin resistance improver, a therapeutic agent of diabetes, a therapeutic agent of diabetic complications, a glucose tolerance improver, an anti-atherosclerosis agent, an anti-obesity agent, an antiinflammatory agent, an agent for the prophylaxis or treatment of PPAR-mediated diseases and an agent for the prophylaxis or treatment of syndrome X, all of which comprising the above-mentioned novel heterocyclic derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br><br>
As a therapeutic agent of diabetes, biguanide compounds having, as a main action, an inhibitory action on glucose absorption via the intestinal tract and on glucose release from the liver, sulfonylurea compounds having an accelerating action on insulin secretion as a main action, insulin and the like have been employed. However, biguanide compounds cause lactic aC1dosis, and sulfonylurea compounds sometimes cause serious hypoglycemia due to their strong hypoglycemic action. Therefore, a due care should be given when in use of these compounds.  In recent years, there have been active researches and developments of a therapeutic agent of diabetes, which is<br><br>
free of these defects, with the consequence that various compounds having an insulin resistance-improving action have been found.<br>
The insulin resistance plays an important role as a cause Df non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), along with decrease in the insulin secretion. As an agent that improves insulin resistance, various thiazolidine compounds are known. Examples of such compound include 5-[4-[(6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-yl)methoxy]benzyl]-2,4-thiazolidinedione (general name: troglitazone) is described in USP 4572912 and EP0139421B1, 5-[[4-[2-(5-ethyl-pyridin-2-yl)ethoxy]phenyl]-methyl]-2,4-thiazolidinedione (general name: pioglitazone) is described in USP4687777 and EP0193256B1, and 5-[[4-[2-[N-methyl-N-(pyridin-2-yl)amino]ethoxy]phenyl]methyl]-2,4-thiazolidinedione (general name: rosiglitazone) is described in USP5002953 and EP0306228B1.  However, these pharmaceutical agents that improve insulin resistance may cause side effects such as hepatopathy, retention of fluid, edema, megalocardia, obesity and the like. Thus, the development of a highly safe insulin resistance improver effective for NIDDM has been desired.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a compound having a hypoglycemic action, a blood hypolipidemic action, an insulin resistance-improving action and a PPAR activating action, which has a structure completely different from that of conventional compounds and which is highly safe, thereby to increase the diversity in and to broaden the range of selection from hypoglycemic agents, hypolipidemic agents, insulin resistance improvers, therapeutic agents of diabetes, therapeutic agents of diabetic complications, glucose tolerance improvers, anti-atherosclerosis agents, anti-obesity agents, antiinflammatory<br><br>
