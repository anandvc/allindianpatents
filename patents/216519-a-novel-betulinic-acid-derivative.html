				<td>The present invention relates to a novel Betulinic acid derivative and a composition comprising the same.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to the use of betulinic acid and its derivatives for the inhibition/prevention of cancer growth, novel betulinic acid derivatives useful for the inhibition of tumor/cancer cells and a process for the preparation of the said derivatives. The invention also relates to the antileukaemic, and anti-lymphoma activity of said novel betulinic acid derivatives, useful for treatment of prostate, ovarian and lung cancer.<br>
Background and prior art references to the Invention<br>
Under the auspices of a National Cooperative Natural Product Drug Discovery Group supported by the National Cancer Institute, the potential antitumor activity of approximately  2500  extracts  derived  from globally  collected plants was evaluated in a panel of enzyme based assays and in a battery of cultured human tumor cell lines. One such extract, prepared from the stem bark of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. (Rhamnaceae), displayed selective cytotoxicity against cultured human melanoma cells (Nature Medicine, Vol. 1 (10), 1995, WO 96/29068). As a result of bioactivity guided fractionation, betulinic acid, a pentacyclic triterpene, was identified as  a melanoma-specific cytotoxic agent.  In follow-up studies conducted with athymic mice carrying human melanomas, tumor growth was completely inhibited without toxicity. As judged by a variety of cellular responses, antitumor activity was mediated by the induction of apoptosis.<br>
A number of triterpenoids, including betulinic acid, have several known medical applications,  including use as an anticancer drug. Anderson et al.,  in WO 95/04526, have discussed the derivatives of triterpenoids which have been used in cancer therapy, including their activity against polyamines which are required by cells to grow at an optimal rate. Some of these triterpenoids have been found to interfere with enzymatic synthesis of polyamines required for optimal cell growth, and thus inhibit the growth of cancer cells, particularly by inhibiting ornithine decarboxylase (Yasukawa, K. et al. Oncology 48 : 72-76,1991). The anti-cancer activity of betulinic acid and some derivatives has been demonstrated using mouse sarcoma 180 cells implanted subcutaneously hi nude mice ( JP 87,301,580). Choi et al have shown that betulinic acid 3-monoacetate, and betulinic acid methyl ester exhibit EDso values of 10.5 and 6.8 ug/ml, respectively, against p388 lymphocytic leukemia cells (Choi, Y-H et al., Planta Medica vol XLVDL, pages 511 - 513, 1988).<br>
The ED*) values of these derivatives is greater than 4.0 ug/ml and hence may not be considered to be having any significant anticancer activity. Table 1 indicates anticancer activity (EDso values) of an derivatives and the applicants claim only derivatives which show ED^ 
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising betulinic acid derivatives useful for killing or inhibiting multiplication of cancer cells, novel betulinic acid derivatives, a process for the synthesis of the said novel derivatives of betulinic acid and testing the bio-activity using cultured human leukemia (MOLT-4, Jurkat E6.1, HL60, CEM.CM3), lymphoma cells (BR1STOL-8, U937),<br>
prostate cancer cells (DU 145), lung cancer cells (A 549) and ovarian cancer cells (PA-1) as the monitor.<br>

Examples of organic bases that can be used are pyridine, piperidine.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of 3-o- mesylate derivatives<br>
Substrate is dissolved in halogenated solvent and added methane sulphonyl chloride slowly to it at 5-10°C. Stirred the mixture at an ambient temperature for 2-4 hours. Worked up the reaction mixture by washing the organic layer with water. Organic layer dried over anhydrous sulfate, filtered, evaporated to dryness to get a residue which was crystallized from acetonitrile to yield pure 3-o-mesylate derivative.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of 3-phenyI hydrazino or its phenyl substituted derivative<br>
3-phenylbydrazone or its phenyl substituted derivative of betulinic acid or dihydrobetulinic acid is dissolved in glacial acetic acid and shaken under hydrogen atmosphere (50-70- psi) in presence of platinum sponge catalyst for 3-5 hours. Reaction mixture was filtered, mother liquor evaporated under vacuum to remove glacial acetic acid and the residue crystallized from alcoholic solvent to yield pure 3-phenyl hydrazino or its phenyl substituted derivative. Alcoholic solvents used are methanol, ethanol or iso propanol.<br>
Example 4<br>
Preparation of 3-N-Hydroxyethyl derivative<br>
3-oxo-derivative is dissolved in absolute alcoholic solvent such as methanol / ethanol and to it added 15-20% alcoholic hydrochloric acid and 2-aminoethanol and stirred at room temperature for 30 - 60 minutes. To this added sodium cyanoborohydride and further stirred at room temperature for approximately 72 hours. Worked up by adding water followed by filtration of solid to yield crude product, which was crystallized from alcohol to yield pure 3-N-hydroxyethyl derivative.<br>
Example 5<br>
Preparation of 3-N-Benzylidene derivative<br>
3-Amino derivative is dissolved in alcoholic solvent, such as methanol / ethanol and to it added benzaldehyde or substituted benzaldehyde derivative in presence or absence of alkali carbonate, such as sodium or potassium carbonate. The mixture<br>
was stirred for few hours at ambient temperature to 50°C approximately. The reaction mixture was worked up by removing alcohol under vacuum and addition of water. The aqueous layer either filtered or extracted with halogenated organic solvent, followed by evaporation yielded 3-N-benzylidene derivative.<br>
Example 6<br>
Preparation of 3-amino derivatives:<br>
3-amino derivatives is dissolved in glacial active acid and shaken under hydrogen atmosphere (60-70 psi) in presence of platinum oxide catalyst for several horro-reaction mixture is filtered, molten liquor evaporate under vacuum to remove glacial acetic acid and the residue worked up in the usual manner to yield the corresponding 3-amino derivative.<br>
Example 7<br>
Preparation of 3-oxo derivatives:<br>
The substrate was dissolved in the organic solvent and the conventional oxidising agent was added under normal reaction conditions. The reaction was worked up to yield the corresponding 3-oxo derivatives in the pure form.<br>
Example 8<br>
Preparation of 3-oximino derivative<br>
The 3-oxo derivative was taken in an alcoholic solvent. To this was added hydroxylamine hydrochloride and sodium acetate and refluxed for few hours. The reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness. The reaction, worked up as descried in Method 1 yield crude-3-oximino derivative which was crystallized to yield the corresponding pine 3-oximino derivative.<br>
Example 9<br>
Preparation of phenyihydrazone of 3-oxo derivative<br>
Phenylhydrazine was added to 3-oxo derivative dissolved in alcoholic solvent and refluxed for four hours. The reaction was worked up as described in Method 1 to yield the corresponding pheynylhydrazone derivative in the pure form.<br>
Example 10<br>
In vitro cytotoxic activity of novel betulinic acid derivatives was determined by performing the MTT cytotoxicity assay (Mosmann T., J Immunological Methods, 65 : 55 ; 1983). Briefly, the cultured tumor cells were separately seeded in a 96-well culture plate and co-incubated with betulinic acid or its derivatives dissolved in methanol, dimethyl formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide or isopropyl alcohol with<br>
relevant controls at 37°C in a CO2 incubator. After 72 hours, the assay was terminated and percent cyotoxicities calculated. As shown in Table I, metabolic activity of leukemia cells (MOLT-4, Jurkat E6.1, HL60, CEM.CM3) was inhibited by active betuhnic acid derivatives, i.e., an EDso value of about 04 - 3.5µg/ml. The ED50 value of active betulinic acid derivatives for lymphoma cells (BRISTOL-8, U937) was in the range of 1 8 to 3.1 µg/ml. Further active betulinic acid denvatives showed an ED50 value of 0.4 - 4.0 µg/ml, 1.2 - 4.0 µg/ml and 0.7 - 4.0µg/ml against DU145 (human prostate), PA-1 (human ovary) and A549 (human lung) respectively.<br>

Example 12<br>
A suitable formulation of betulinic acid derivatives was prepared as follows Betulinic acid derivatives were solubilized in a minimum volume of methanol Betulinic   acid   derivatives   may   also   be   solubilized   in   isopropyl   alcohol, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide or any other suitable solvent. Substituted beta-cyclodextrin, such as 2-hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin, sulfobutyl ether beta-cyclodextrin   was   separately  dissolved  in  water  to   a   concentration   of approximately 50 to 1000 mg per ml, preferably 250 to 750 mg per ml. The solubilized betulinic acid or its derivative was added in small aliquots to the derivatized beta cyclodextrin solution and sonicated at low temperature until a clear solution developed. The organic solvent was then removed by rotary evaporation and the final solution filtered to give a sterile product. The resulting solution was lyophilized<br>
Systemic administration refers to oral, rectal, nasal, transdermal and parentral (i.e., intramuscular, mtiapentoneal. subcutaneous or intravenous). In accordance with good clinical practice, it is preferred to administer the composition at a dose that will produce antiangiogemc effects without causing undue harmful side effects The composition may be administered either alone or as a mixture with other therapeutic agents. The composition of the invention may contain betulinic acid derivatives alone or in combination.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions which provide from about 10 mg to 1000 mg of the composition per unit dose are preferred as tablets, lozenges, capsules, powders, aqueous or oily suspensions, syrups, elixirs, implants or aqueous solutions by any conventional method. The nature of pharmaceutical composition employed will, of course, depend on the desired route of administration. The human dosage of the composition is in the range of 1.0 to 200 mg/kg/day and the preferred range is 1.0 to 50 mg/kg/day.<br><br><br><br>
