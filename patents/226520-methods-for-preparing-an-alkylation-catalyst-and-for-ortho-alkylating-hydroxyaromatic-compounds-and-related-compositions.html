				<td>METHODS FOR PREPARING AN ALKYLATION CATALYST, AND FOR<br>
ORTHO-ALKYLATING HYDROXYAROMATIC COMPOUNDS; AND<br>
RELATED COMPOSITIONS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates generally to alkylation catalysts. More<br>
particularly, it is directed to improved methods for preparing such catalysts,<br>
and for using the catalysts in the ortho-alkylation of hydroxyaromatic<br>
compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Ortho-alkylated hydroxyaromatic compounds are useful for a<br>
variety of purposes. For example, ortho-cresol is a useful disinfectant and<br>
wood preservative. It is often prepared by the vapor-phase reaction of a<br>
phenol with methanol. In another alkylation reaction, ortho-cresol and<br>
phenol can both be converted into 2,6-xylenol. This xylenol monomer can be<br>
polymerized to form poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene)ether, which is the<br>
primary component in certain high-performance thermoplastic products.<br>
The alkylated hydroxyaromatic compounds are usually prepared<br>
by the alkylation of the precursor hydroxyaromatic compound with a primary<br>
or secondary alcohol. The alkylation must be carried out in the presence of a<br>
suitable catalyst, such as a magnesium-based compound. U.S. Patents<br>
4,554,267; 4,201,880; and 3,446,856 describe the use of magnesium oxide for<br>
this purpose.<br><br>
A great deal of attention has been paid to optimizing the<br>
performance of magnesium-based catalysts in an industrial setting. Usually, it<br>
is very important for the catalyst to have high activity, i.e., it must have as long<br>
an active life as possible. Moreover, the catalyst must have very good ortho-<br>
selectivity. Many of the ortho-alkylation catalysts used in the past produced a<br>
high proportion of para-alkylated products of marginal utility.<br>
As an illustration, the alkylation of phenol with methanol in the<br>
presence of a magnesium oxide catalyst yields ortho-cresol (o-cresol) and 2,6-<br>
xylenol, which are desirable products. However, the alkylation reaction may<br>
also produce substantial amounts of para-substituted compounds, such as<br>
para-cresol (p-cresol); 2,4-xylenol, and mesitol (2,4,6-trimethylphenol). In<br>
some end use applications, these para-substituted compounds are much less<br>
useful than the corresponding compounds containing unsubstituted para<br>
positions. For example, polyphenylene ethers prepared from such compounds<br>
lack the desired properties obtained when the starting material is primarily<br>
2,6-xylenol.<br>
Selectivity and activity are related to the characteristics of the<br>
ortho-alkylation catalyst, and to the manner in which it is prepared. In the<br>
above-mentioned U.S. Patent 4,554,267 (Chambers et al), a magnesium-based<br>
catalyst is prepared with a slurry process, using selected amounts of a copper<br>
salt as a promoter. In the process, the magnesium reagent and an aqueous<br>
solution of the copper salt are combined to form a magnesium-containing<br>
solid phase, which includes uniform, well-dispersed copper. The solid phase<br>
is dried, shaped, and calcined. The catalyst system is then used in the<br>
alkylation reaction of phenol and methanol. The reaction produces relatively<br>
high levels of the desirable 2,6-xylenol product. Moreover, the "selectivity" of<br>
the catalyst system, i.e., the ratio of 2,6-xylenol yield to the combined yield of<br>
2,4-xylenol and mesitol, is also quite high, as is the overall yield of 2,6-xylenol.<br><br>
It is clear that a catalyst composition like that described in the<br>
patent of Chambers et al is very useful and effective for alkylation reactions.<br>
Moreover, the slurry process used to prepare such a catalyst can be efficiently<br>
carried out in some situations. However, there are drawbacks associated with<br>
the slurry process in other situations - especially in a large-scale production<br>
setting. For example, the "liquid"-related steps, which involve pre-blending of<br>
a copper compound with a magnesium compound, usually require mixing and<br>
holding tanks, recirculation piping, and specialized drying systems. Storage of<br>
the dried magnesium oxide/copper product (sometimes referred to as a<br>
"matrix") may also be required, prior to blending and shaping steps. These<br>
operations and the related equipment represent a considerable investment in<br>
time and expense (e.g., energy costs), and may therefore lower productivity in<br>
a commercial venue. Furthermore, use of the slurry process can sometimes<br>
introduce metal and halogen-based contaminants into the catalyst, via the<br>
water supply.<br>
It should therefore be apparent that improved methods for<br>
alkylating hydroxyaromatic compounds would be welcome in the art. The<br>
improvements may advantageously depend on the catalyst systems used in the<br>
alkylation reaction. Thus, enhanced techniques for preparing the catalyst<br>
would also be very desirable. Any new process related to alkylation or catalyst<br>
preparation should provide significant advantages in one or more of the<br>
following aspects: catalyst selectivity, catalyst activity, product yield, cost<br>
savings, and overall productivity. Moreover, use of the new processes should<br>
result in products (e.g., 2,6-xylenol) which possess substantially all of the<br>
desirable characteristics of products made by prior art methods.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
In response to the needs of the prior art, an improved method<br>
for preparing a solid catalyst composition has been discovered. The method<br>
comprises dry-blending at least one filler with a magnesium reagent which<br>
yields magnesium oxide upon calcination, thereby forming a blended product.<br>
The level of chlorides in the magnesium reagent is less than about 250 ppm,<br>
and the level of calcium in the magnesium reagent is less than about 2500<br>
ppm. In some preferred embodiments, the level of chlorides in the<br>
magnesium reagent is less than about 125 ppm, and the level of calcium in the<br>
magnesium reagent is less than about 1000 ppm.<br>
The filler is usually polyphenylene ether, graphite, or a mixture<br>
thereof, and is present in an amount up to about 20% by weight. Dry-<br>
blending in this process is carried out in the absence of a promoter, e.g., a<br>
copper promoter. In preferred embodiments, the catalyst composition is<br>
vacuum-deaerated after dry-blending. Other processing steps are often<br>
undertaken, e.g., sieving, milling, compressing, and then forming the catalyst<br>
into a desired shape, such as a pellet. The shaped catalyst is usually calcined<br>
before use.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is directed to a method for<br>
selectively alkylating at least one hydroxyaromatic compound, to form a<br>
desired product, such as 2,6-xylenol. In this method, the solid catalyst is<br>
prepared as mentioned above, and calcined. A hydroxyaromatic compound<br>
such as phenol is then reacted with an alkyl alcohol such as methanol, in the<br>
presence of the catalyst, to form the alkylated product.<br>
A process for preparing a polyphenylene ether resin constitutes<br>
another embodiment of this invention. In this process, the magnesium-based<br>
alkylation catalyst is prepared and calcined as set forth below, and is used to<br>
form a 2,6-alkyl-disubstituted phenolic compound. The 2,6-alkyl-<br>
disubstituted phenolic compound is then oxidatively coupled in the presence<br><br>
of a suitable polymerization catalyst, to form the polyphenylene ether resin.<br>
Resins prepared by this process can be blended with one or more other<br>
materials, such as alkenyl aromatic resins, elastomers, polyamides, and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
Still another embodiment of this invention is directed to a<br>
catalyst composition, comprising a magnesium reagent and at least one filler,<br>
wherein the level of chlorides in the magnesium reagent is less than about 250<br>
ppm, and the level of calcium in the magnesium reagent is less than about<br>
2500 ppm.<br>
Other details regarding the various embodiments of this<br>
invention are provided below.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As mentioned above, a magnesium reagent is the primary<br>
component of the catalyst composition. Any magnesium reagent which yields<br>
magnesium oxide can be used. The preferred reagents are magnesium oxide,<br>
magnesium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, basic magnesium carbonate,<br>
and mixtures of any of the foregoing. The magnesium reagent is in the form of<br>
a powder. The average particle size for the powder is usually in the range of<br>
about 5 microns to about 50 microns.<br>
There often appears to be a difference in reagent particle shape<br>
for the present invention, as compared to reagent particles of the prior art.<br>
For example, substantially all of the particles for the present invention are<br><br>
generally spherical, and have a relatively smooth "edge" or surface, when<br>
viewed microscopically. In contrast, many of the reagent particles of the prior<br>
art do not appear to be as spherical, and have a relatively jagged edge or<br>
surface, when viewed in the same manner.<br>
Basic magnesium carbonate is especially preferred for many<br>
embodiments of this invention. As described in U.S. Patent 4,554,267, which<br>
is incorporated herein by reference, basic magnesium carbonate is sometimes<br>
referred to as "magnesium carbonate hydroxide". It is identified in The Merck<br>
Index, Ninth Edition. It is also described in The Condensed Chemical<br>
Dictionary, Tenth Edition (1981), Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, page<br>
633, which is incorporated herein by reference. Those skilled in the art<br>
understand that the exact formula for basic magnesium carbonate varies to<br>
some extent.<br>
For this invention, it is important that the level of chlorides in<br>
the magnesium reagent be less than about 250 ppm, and preferably, less than<br>
about 125 ppm. In some especially preferred embodiments, the level of<br>
chlorides in the magnesium reagent is less than about 100 ppm. (As used<br>
herein, "chlorides" refers to chloride ions, which are often present in the form<br>
of a salt). The level of calcium in the magnesium reagent should be less than<br>
about 2500 ppm, and preferably, less than about 1000 ppm. In some<br>
especially preferred embodiments, the level of calcium is less than about 750<br>
ppm. (These levels of impurities can alternatively be specified with respect to<br>
the magnesium oxide-form which results from calcination, as described below.<br>
The impurity threshold levels in the calcined oxide would be approximately<br>
twice those for a basic magnesium carbonate reagent, e.g., less than about 500<br>
ppm chlorides and less than about 5000 ppm calcium, in the broadest<br>
embodiment).<br><br>
The present inventors have discovered that this reduction in the<br>
levels of chlorides and calcium results in a catalyst with very high activity.<br>
Moreover, the catalyst also has very good selectivity, e.g., ortho-selectivity. In<br>
other words, its use minimizes the production of unwanted byproducts, as<br>
illustrated in the examples which follow.<br>
The levels of chlorides and calcium in the magnesium reagent<br>
can be determined by common analytical methods. For example, calcium<br>
levels can be determined by a titration technique or by some form of<br>
spectroscopy, e.g., inductively coupled plasma atomic emissions spectroscopy.<br>
Chloride levels are usually determined by titration or by ion chromatography.<br>
Magnesium reagents of this type can be made available by commercial sources<br>
upon request.<br>
As mentioned above, the magnesium reagent is dry-blended<br>
with at least one filler. The term "filler" is meant to encompass various<br>
lubricants, binders and fillers which are known in the art for incorporation<br>
into this type of catalyst. The total amount of filler present in the catalyst<br>
composition is usually up to about 20% by weight, based on the total weight of<br>
filler and magnesium reagent. In some preferred embodiments, the level of<br>
filler is up to about 10% by weight. Examples of fillers used in the catalyst<br>
composition are graphite and polyphenylene ether (PPE). The polyphenylene<br>
ether is usually used in an amount of up to about 10% by weight, based on<br>
total weight, while the graphite is usually employed in an amount of up to<br>
about 5% by weight.<br>
As used in this disclosure, the term "dry blending" refers to the<br>
general technique in which the individual ingredients are initially mixed<br>
together in the dry state, without resorting to any "wet" techniques, such as<br>
suspension blending or precipitation. Dry blending methods and equipment<br>
are known in the art, and described, for example, in Kirk-Othmer's<br><br>
Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 4th Edition., and in the Modern<br>
Plastics Encyclopedia, Vol. 67, No. 11,1990, McGraw-Hill, Inc. Any type of<br>
mechanical mixer or blender can be used, such as a ribbon blender. Those<br>
skilled in the art are familiar with the general parameters for dry-blending this<br>
type of material. The ingredients should be mixed until an intimate blend is<br>
obtained, with the fillers being well-dispersed. The blending time is typically<br>
in the range of about 10 minutes to about 2 hours, at a shaft speed of about 5<br>
rpm to about 60 rpm.<br>
As alluded to earlier, a key feature for some embodiments of the<br>
present invention is the elimination of a promoter. In prior art catalyst-<br>
preparation, the presence of the promoter was usually required, but often<br>
made the blending process more difficult. As an example, the presence of a<br>
copper promoter, while used at low levels (about 200-300 ppm), required<br>
careful pre-blending with the magnesium carbonate. A poor dispersion of the<br>
copper promoter would result in catalyst deficiency, e.g., poor activity and<br>
poor selectivity. The pre-blending step was typically carried out as a wet<br>
process, i.e., a slurry, which therefore required additional steps, such as<br>
drying. Thus, the elimination of a promoter obviates the slurry pre-blending<br>
step, and this is an important advantage in commercial production.<br>
After dry-blending of the magnesium reagent and filler (or<br>
multiple fillers) is complete, the blended, solid catalyst composition is in the<br>
form of a powder. The powder usually has a bulk density in the range of about<br>
0.1 g/cc to about 0.5 g/cc, and preferably, in the range of about 0.25 g/cc to<br>
about 0.5 g/cc. The powder then typically undergoes further processing, prior<br>
to being shaped into a desired form. Non-limiting examples of the additional<br>
processing steps include sieving (to obtain a more narrow particle<br>
distribution), milling, and compressing.<br><br>
In some preferred embodiments, the catalyst composition is<br>
compacted after dry-blending. Compacting equipment is known in the art,<br>
and described, for example, in the Kirk Othmer reference noted above.<br>
Commercial compacting systems are available from various sources, such as<br>
Allis-Chalmers; Gerteis Macshinen, Jona, Switzerland; and Fitzpatrick Co.,<br>
Elmhurst, 111. The compactors usually function by feeding the powdered<br>
material through rollers.<br>
One specific example of a suitable compactor unit is known as<br>
the "Chilsonator™". In such a system, the catalyst powder is first fed to<br>
compaction rolls by a rapidly-turning vertical feed screw. The feed screw<br>
forces the powder into a roll nip. The rolls compress the material into a<br>
continuous solid sheet.<br>
In most embodiments of this invention, the catalyst composition<br>
is deaerated after dry-blending, and prior to additional processing. This step<br>
is especially important in those instances in which the composition must<br>
subsequently pass through compaction rollers. Deaeration further increases<br>
the bulk density of the material by forcibly removing entrained gas (primarily<br>
air) from within the powder. Deaeration systems are known in the art and<br>
available from various sources. Vacuum deaeration is one common technique.<br>
The vacuum can be applied at various points along the passage of the powder<br>
from the blending unit to other processing operations. Usually, the vacuum is<br>
applied at a point very close to (and preceding) the location of compaction<br>
rollers. The strength of the vacuum will depend on various factors, such as the<br>
amount of powder being processed; its compressibility; the type of fillers<br>
contained therein, and the density of the powder. Usually, the vacuum<br>
strength is in the range of about 5 inches (12.7 cm) mercury to about 25 inches<br>
(63.5 cm) mercury.<br><br>
The solid sheets of catalyst material formed by compaction are<br>
then granulated by various techniques. The granulated material is typically<br>
size-separated. The desired catalyst granules can then be conveyed<br>
immediately to a shaping operation, or to a storage facility. The shape of the<br>
catalyst is not critical for this invention. It will of course depend on the<br>
manner in which the catalyst is being used for subsequent alkylation<br>
operations. Very often, the catalyst is compressed into a pellet or "tablet".<br>
Conventional pelletizing equipment can accomplish this task (e.g., a<br>
Betapress), as described in U.S. Patent 4,900,708, incorporated herein by<br>
reference. Pellets prepared according to this invention usually have a bulk<br>
density of about 0.75 g/cc to about 1.0 g/cc, and have good handling strength.<br>
The shaped catalyst composition is then calcined, as described in<br>
U.S. Patent 4,554,267. Calcination is usually carried out by heating the<br>
catalyst at a temperature sufficient to convert the magnesium reagent to<br>
magnesium oxide, which is the active species in the catalyst. (Calcination<br>
increases the surface area of the catalyst). The calcination temperature may<br>
vary somewhat, but is usually in the range of about: 350°C to about 550°C. The<br>
calcination atmosphere may be oxidizing, inert, or reducing. (Alternatively,<br>
the catalyst can be calcined at the beginning of the alkylation reaction. In<br>
other words, calcination can take place in the presence of the alkylation feed<br>
materials, i.e., the hydroxy aromatic compound and the alkyl alcohol.) The<br>
surface area of the catalyst after calcination is usually in the range of about<br>
100 m2/g to about 250 m2/g, based on grams of magnesium oxide.<br>
It should be apparent that another embodiment of this invention<br>
is directed to a process for selectively alkylating one or more hydroxyaromatic<br>
compounds, such as phenol. The key feature of this process is the use of the<br>
magnesium-based catalyst described above, i.e., one having reduced levels of<br>
chlorides and calcium. Hydroxyaromatic compounds which can be alkylated<br>
according to this invention most often have a free ortho-position. Many of<br><br>
them are described in the above-referenced U.S. Patents 4,554,267;<br>
4,201,880; and 3,446,856, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The most preferred hydroxyaromatic compounds are the<br>
monohydroxyaromatic compounds - especially those in which the para-<br>
position is unsubstituted. Phenol and o-cresol are preferred compounds of<br>
this type. (o-Cresol is often a by-product in the methylation of phenol to 2,6-<br>
xylenol). Phenol is especially preferred. Mixtures of any of these compounds<br>
may also be used.<br>
The alcohol used for alkylation may be primary or secondary,<br>
and is often primary. Non-limiting examples of suitable alcohols are<br>
described in U.S. Patent 4,554,267, and include methanol, ethanol, 1-<br>
propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol, 1-hexanol, and<br>
mixtures of any of the foregoing. (Alcohols containing up to 4 carbon atoms<br>
are often preferred). Methanol is often the most preferred alcohol.<br>
The alkylation techniques are generally known in the art, and<br>
described in the above-referenced U.S. Patents 4,554,267 and 3,446,856.<br>
Suitable processes are also described in U.S. Patents 4,933,509; 4,900,708;<br>
4,554,266; 4,547,480; 4,048,239; 4,041,085; and 3,974,229, all of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A variety of alkylated compounds may be formed by this<br>
method, such as 2,6-xylenol or 2,3,6-trimethyl phenol. In many<br>
embodiments, 2,6-xylenol is the preferred product. Usually, this material is<br>
produced by a gas phase reaction between phenol and methanol, utilizing the<br>
catalyst of this invention. Those skilled in the polymer- and chemical<br>
engineering arts are familiar with the details regarding this type of reaction.<br>
As the examples describe, use of the alkylated catalyst discovered by the<br>
present inventors results in very good product formation rates, as well as<br>
excellent selectivity toward the desired alkylated product. Those familiar with<br><br>
chemistry and chemical reactions would be able to select the proper starting<br>
materials for each of the desired alkylated compounds. For example, 2,3,6-<br>
trimethyl phenol can be prepared by reacting m-cresol with methanol, using<br>
the alkylation catalyst described herein.<br>
Another embodiment of this invention is directed to a method<br>
for preparing polyphenylene ether resin, using an alkyl-disubstituted phenolic<br>
compound prepared with the catalyst composition described above.<br>
Polyphenylene ether (sometimes referred to as "PPE" or "polyphenylene<br>
oxide") is a well-known resin product. It is usually made by polymerizing a<br>
selectively-alkylated hydroxyaromatic compound, e.g., a 2,6-alkyl-<br>
disubstituted phenolic compound such as 2,6-xylenol. The most common<br>
technique is the oxidative coupling of the substituted phenolic compound in<br>
the presence of a suitable polymerization catalyst. Methods for preparing<br>
polyphenylene ethers are described, for example, in U.S. Patents 5,017,655;<br>
4,092,294; 4,083,828; 3,962,181; 3,306,875; and 3,306,874, all of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference. Polyphenylene ether copolymers are also<br>
within the scope of this invention, e.g., those obtained by the polymerization<br>
of a mixture of 2,6-xylenol and 2,3,6-trimethyl phenol.<br>
Various catalysts can be used for preparing the polyphenylene<br>
ethers, and this invention is not restricted to any particular polymerization<br>
catalyst. Examples of suitable catalyst systems include a mixture of<br>
manganese-, cobalt- or copper salts with an alkali metal alcoholate or<br>
phenolate; a mixture of a manganese salt, an alcohol, and a tertiary amine; or<br>
a mixture of various amines with a copper compound. Copper-amine<br>
complexes which include at least two amine compounds, as described in U.S.<br>
Patent 4,092,294, are preferred for many embodiments of this invention.<br>
Various details regarding the polymerization reaction are known<br>
in the art. For example, those skilled in this type of polymerization are<br><br>
familiar with factors regarding solvent selection; gas flow rates (e.g., for<br>
oxygen); reaction time, and reaction temperature; as well as techniques for<br>
precipitation and drying of the polymer. Polyphenylene ethers prepared<br>
according to this disclosure have all of the desirable attributes exhibited by<br>
polyphenylene ethers prepared by prior art processes.<br>
The polyphenylene ethers can be blended with a variety of other<br>
materials which provide additional attributes. Examples of these blends are<br>
provided in U.S. Patents 5,017,656; 4,874,810; and 4,822,836, all of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference. For example, polyphenylene ether is<br>
frequently blended with various alkenyl aromatic polymers, such as<br>
polystyrene or rubber-modified (high impact) polystyrene. Polyphenylene<br>
ether may also be blended with various polyamide resins, to provide enhanced<br>
chemical resistance. (Polyphenylene ether/polyamide blending is carried out<br>
in the presence of a compatibilizing agent, as described in the referenced<br>
patents). Those skilled in the art are familiar with procedures for preparing<br>
these blended products.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are merely illustrative, and should not<br>
be construed to be any sort of limitation on the scope of the claimed invention.<br>
In each of samples A-D, the level of chlorides in the magnesium<br>
reagent was less than about 100 ppm. The level of calcium in the reagent was<br>
less than about 1000 ppm.<br>
Sample A was prepared according to a method outside the scope<br>
of the present invention. It involves the preparation of a magnesium<br>
carbonate-type catalyst in a "wet" process, using a copper promoter. 17 kg of<br>
basic magnesium carbonate was added, with stirring, to 25.5 gallons of<br>
deionized water which contained 17.0 grams of cupric nitrate trihydrate. The<br><br>
resulting slurry was mixed for one hour. The material was dried at 120°C for<br>
24 hours. The dried solids were then blended with 85 grams of graphite (0.5%<br>
by weight) and 340 grams (2.0% by weight) of polyphenylene ether. The<br>
blend was compacted, granulated and pelletized into cylindrical pellets, 3/16<br>
in. diameter and 1/8 inch long. The tablets were calcined in an alkylation<br>
reactor by heating at 38o°C for 22 hours, to yield the desired catalyst<br>
composition which contained 0.025% copper by weight, based on magnesium<br>
oxide.<br>
Sample B was also prepared according to a method outside the<br>
scope of the present invention. It involves the preparation of a magnesium<br>
carbonate-type catalyst in a "wet" process, without using a copper promoter.<br>
17 kg of basic magnesium carbonate was added, with stirring, to 25.5 gallons<br>
of de-ionized water. The resulting slurry was mixed for one hour. The<br>
material was dried at 120°C for 24 hours. The dried solids were then blended<br>
with 85 grams of graphite (0.5% by weight) and 340 grams (2.0% by weight)<br>
of polyphenylene ether. The blend was compacted, granulated and pelletized<br>
into cylindrical pellets, 3/16 in. diameter and 1/8 inch long. The tablets were<br>
calcined in an alkylation reactor by heating at 38o°C for 22 hours, to yield<br>
magnesium oxide.<br>
Sample C was also prepared according to a method outside the<br>
scope of the present invention. It involves the preparation of a magnesium<br>
carbonate-type catalyst in a dry-blending process, using a copper promoter.<br>
17 kg of basic magnesium carbonate was blended with 17.0 grams of cupric<br>
nitrate trihydrate, 85 grams of graphite and 340 grams of polyphenylene<br>
ether. The blend was compacted, granulated and pelletized into cylindrical<br>
pellets, 3/16 in. diameter and 1/8 inch long. The tablets were calcined in an<br>
alkylation reactor by heating at 38o°C for 22 hours, to yield the desired<br>
catalyst composition. The composition contained 0.025% copper by weight,<br>
based on magnesium oxide.<br><br>
Sample D was prepared according to the present invention. In<br>
other words, the catalyst was prepared in a dry process, without the use of a<br>
copper promoter. 17 kg of basic magnesium carbonate was blended with 85<br>
grams of graphite and 340 grams of polyphenylene ether. The blend was<br>
compacted, granulated and pelletized into cylindrical pellets, 3/16 in.<br>
diameter and 1/8 inch long. The tablets were calcined in an alkylation reactor<br>
by heating at 38o°C for 22 hours, to yield magnesium oxide.<br>
Sample E was prepared according to a prior art process, outside<br>
the scope of the present invention. In other words, the catalyst was prepared<br>
in a wet process substantially identical to that used for sample A, using a<br>
copper promoter. The basic magnesium carbonate used for this sample<br>
contained chloride levels in the range of about 100-200 ppm, and calcium<br>
levels greater than about 5000 ppm.<br>
Experimental Procedure<br>
A reactor was loaded with 100 cc of catalyst. The catalyst was calcined<br>
in situ for 22 hours at 380°C in nitrogen, at atmospheric pressure. After<br>
calcination, the temperature was increased to 450°C in two hours in a<br>
nitrogen atmosphere. After 15 minutes, a feed mixture was introduced at 4<br>
cc/min, and reactor pressure was controlled to 25 psig. The feed contained<br>
46.13 wt% methanol, 33.83 wt% phenol, and 20 wt% water (4:1 molar ratio of<br>
methanol to phenol). The alkylation was run for 165 hours at fixed conditions,<br>
during which the yields of o-cresol, 2,6-xylenol, p-cresol, 2,4-xylenol and<br>
mesitol were monitored. Conversion was measured at 165 hours, and is<br>
defined as the normalized wt% 2,6-xylenol in the effluent.<br>
Conversion (96) =<br>
(Weight of 2,6-xylenol in effluent) x 100 / (Weights of effluent<br>
phenolics)<br><br>
After 165 hours, the conditions were adjusted to achieve 65 wt%<br>
2,6-xylenol in the effluent. At 165 hr, selectivity was calculated as:<br>
Selectivity =<br>
(Effluent moles (p-cresol + 2,4-xylenol + mesitol)) / (Effluent moles<br>
(phenol + o-cresol + 2,6-xylenol))<br><br><br>
(a) Carbonate #1 contains reduced levels of chlorides and calcium, as<br>
described previously; carbonate #2 contains higher levels of chlorides and<br>
calcium.<br>
* Comparative samples<br>
** Present invention<br>
*** Prior art sample<br>
The data set forth above demonstrate that the use of the<br>
magnesium reagent having reduced levels of chlorides and calcium results in<br>
much greater activity (as measured by conversion 96), as compared to prior art<br>
sample E. Moreover, the selectivity was also greatly improved, as compared to<br>
sample E.<br>
Polyphenylene ether resins were subsequently prepared from<br>
2,6-xylenol products similar to that of sample D. These resins exhibited the<br>
same desirable attributes as those made in the prior art.<br><br>
Having described preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, alternative embodiments may become apparent to those skilled in<br>
the art without departing from the spirit of this invention. Accordingly, it is<br>
understood that the scope of this invention is to be limited only by the<br>
