				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a drawing frame and particularly to a screw gill<br>
drawing frame. This is especially useful for processing jute for standard light<br>
count yarn.<br>
A drawing line comprises of 3 drawing machines, namely, 1st Drawing<br>
Frame, 2nd Drawing Frame and 3rd Drawing Frame, also called as Finisher<br>
Drawing Frame. The purpose of these drawing frames is to make the fiber of<br>
jute sliver parallel and to draw the sliver thinner. In the 1st drawing frame, some<br>
amount of parallelisation takes place, and also the sliver drawn will have a<br>
reduced weight. 1st drawing has 2:1 doubling, i.e., two slivers are mixed for<br>
doubling up. By this, the thick part of one sliver is neutralized by a thin part of the<br>
other sliver. This resultant sliver, with a 3:1 or 4.1 doubling, is fed to the 2nd<br>
drawing frame. In the 2nd drawing frame, the sliver undergoes further<br>
parallelisation, reduction in weight and also improvement in the sliver regularities.<br>
The sliver from the 2nd drawing frame is then fed to the 3rd drawing frame or<br>
finisher drawing frame for reduction in the weight of the sliver and for further<br>
improvement in parallelisation and regularities. The present invention is<br>
concerned with improvements in the 2nd drawing frame.<br>
In the traditional system, only one 2nd drawing frame is used. In order to<br>
improve the number of doublings, parallelisation of fibres, C.V% (coefficient of<br>
variation of sliver mass) etc, another 2nd drawing frame is also used. The extra<br>
processing, i.e., 4-passage drawing (instead of traditional 3 passage drawing)<br>
has the following problems:<br><br>
(a)	Needs more 2nd drawing frames;<br>
(b)	Resultant increase in investment costs;<br>
(c)	Need for more floor space with resultant cost increase;<br>
(d)	Extra labour;<br>
(e)	Increased electric power costs;<br>
(f)	Extra store cost;<br>
(g)	Extra maintenance cost;<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a drawing frame of higher<br>
speed and bigger package, having 7 heads or carriages, instead of 5 heads or<br>
carriages, by introducing additional heads or carriages in the place of 5 heads or<br>
carriages of prior art machine with modification of other parts without changing<br>
the length of the prior art machine.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a drawing frame, particularly<br>
suitable for processing jute fiber of standard light count, said frame comprising,<br>
at least 7 heads or carriages;<br>
a back conductor under which a sliver passes between a rear and a front back<br>
rollers;<br>
a plurality of failer bars each having a top faller screw and a bottom faller screw,<br>
each said faller bar being provided with gill pins in groups, said sliver passing<br>
through said gill pins to the nip between a drawing roller and a rubber pressing<br>
roller;<br>
a gill sliver separator or divider hinged near the back or retaining roller side and<br>
resting on levers and a holding pin at the rubber pressing roller side, for dividing<br><br>
adjacent slivers to prevent flowing of fibres from one sliver to another sliver, said<br>
separator being liftable to permit cleaning, picking and repairing when needed;<br>
a short fibre extraction system comprising an impeller connected to each head<br>
through a ducting and a collecting chute, said collecting chutes being connected<br>
through a common ducting to the mouth of the impeller;<br>
an electronic stop motion system comprising an infra-red sensing device<br>
provided with an emitter and a reflector mounted on a creel and a sliver cylinder;<br>
and<br>
a sliver can packing system downstream of the drawing roller and rubber<br>
pressing roller.<br>
The drawing rollers are preferably mounted on ball bearings in housings.<br>
A jockey roller may be provided between the rear and front back rollers, the<br>
sliver from the rear back roller being passed over the jockey roller under the front<br>
back roller.<br>
A doubling plate can be provided for doubling slivers drawn by the drawing<br>
roller, said plate having six slots, all inclined in the same direction for lacing 3<br>
slivers one above the other to give 3.1 doubling or in different directions to allow<br>
4 slivers one above the other to be laced together to give 4:1 lacing.<br>
A long back shaft may be provided for driving seven short back shafts,said<br>
short back shafts being drivably connected to said faller bars through spur and<br>
bevel gear arrangements, and said long back shafts being mounted on bearings<br>
in bearing housings.<br><br>
The faller bar is preferably provided with 6 groups of gills in two staggered<br>
rows, with no appreciable gap between adjacent groups of gills.<br>
The sliver can packing system may comprise a plate or disk driven by a<br>
shaft supported by bearing brackets fitted on the bottom front rail, said plate or<br>
disk being rotatable clockwise and anticlockwise alternately, said plate<br>
supporting sliver cans at the delivery side of the frame, and a gear being<br>
mounted at the bottom side of said plate and fitted on a coiler base plate<br>
rotatable clockwise and anticlockwise alternately, said, plate supporting sliver<br>
cans at the delivery side of the frame, a gear mounted at the bottom side of said<br>
plate and fitted on a coiler base plate. In this arrangement, the plates can<br>
support fourteen numbers of 18" diameter sliver in the place of ten number of 16"<br>
diameter sliver cans of the prior art machine.<br>
A coiler motion shaft is mounted on bearing brackets to project towards<br>
back/feed side of the machine from the back of the bottom front rail and is driven<br>
by a reversing motion wheel at the main gable end of the drawing frame<br>
provided inside the drawing frame at the back of bottom front rail, said shaft<br>
being drivably connected to said coiler plates by a bevel gear fitted on the shaft.<br>
The back rollers, drawing rollers, back shaft, short back shaft, doubling<br>
late, delivery roller and faller screws are supported on carriage plates, there<br>
being 14 carriage plates and an additional carriage plate at the main gable.<br>
The present invention provides a screw gill drawing frame which is<br>
especially useful as a second drawing frame, although it can be used as a first<br>
drawing frame also.<br><br>

The existing 2nd drawings frames have 5 heads, also<br>
known as carriages. These heads/carriages are fitted on a<br>
bearer beam Bbm (Fig. 38) so that they are equally spaced<br>
apart. Each carriage plate Cpp is seated on the bearer beam<br>
Bbm almost on the head of bearer Brr (Fig. 33). The frames<br>
have 10 deliveries per frame, 2 deliveries per head, 6 or 8<br><br>
slivers per head. All the rollers and shafts are mounted in gun metal bushes.<br>
Delivery speed is about 25 to 30 yards per minute and delivery sliver weight is 4<br>
to 4.5 lbs for 100 yards. Production rate per day of 23.5 hours is 5.5 to 6 m. tons<br>
per drawing frame. The operating efficiency is 65 to 75%. It has mechanical stop<br>
motion and is suitable for 3:1 doubling or 4:1 doubling.<br>
In contrast the machine according to the present invention has 7 heads or<br>
carriages per drawing frame, with 2 deliveries per head. So, there are 14<br>
deliveries in each drawing frame. The number of slivers per head is 6 and there<br>
is a 3:1 doubling or 8 for 4:1 doubling machine. The size of sliver cans at<br>
delivery end is greater than that of sliver cans used in existing frames. Delivery<br>
roller, drawing roller, long back shaft, coiler shaft and driving pulley are fitted with<br>
ball/roller bearings. As a result, the delivery speed increases to 32 to 40 yards<br>
per minute and the operating efficiency will be 70 to 80%. The delivery sliver<br>
weight would be 4 to 4.5 lbs per 100 yards. The machine can process 9 to 10<br>
tons per day of 23 5 hours.<br>
The improved 2nd drawing frame of the present invention will now be<br>
described in detail<br>
From Figs. 1 to 1C, and 35 it can be seen that sliver S, stored in<br>
cans C is drawn over a sliver cylinder Sc of a feed creel Fc, over a missing<br>
sliver stop motion detector Sm, through back conductors Bk, then under a<br>
back roller Br, over a jockey roller J, then again under a front back roller Bf.<br><br>
The sliver then passes over gills G of faller bars F, under<br>
an auto front conductor and then under a rubber pressing<br>
roller P. The sliver is then passed through delivery roller<br>
D and a delivery pressing roller Dp. The sliver is<br>
thereafter crimped in a crimping box Cb and delivered to a<br>
receiving sliver can through a delivery chute D suitably<br>
located near the nip of the rollers D and Dp. The chute<br>
allows the sliver to fall into a can C1 which collects the<br>
emerging sliver sitting on a reciprocating turning disc Cp.<br>
A can packing device/assembly is also provided.<br>
Figs. 37 and 38 show a can packing device according to<br>
one embodiment of the invention. It comprises of a can<br>
packer can (Pcm), can packer lever (Pel), Slide rod (Sid),<br>
Ratchet Rod (Rd), Aluminium presser (Ap), Support Arm (Sa),<br>
Ratchet Pawl (P ) and Support Bracket (Sb). It makes high<br>
density packing of the crimped sliver in the cam.<br>
From Fig. 1C, it can be seen that the ratchet rod Rdx is<br>
an MS round having teeth cut on one side. A long key way Kw<br>
is provided along its length (Fig. 37). At the end of cam<br>
packer ratchet rod Rd, there is an aluminium presser Ap which<br>
presses the sliver in the sliver can DSc. The cam packer rod<br>
is fitted on a cam packer ratchet rod support bracket Sb and<br>
the support bracket fits on a slide rod Sid which is moved up<br>
and down by a cam packer lever Cpl by the action of cam<br>
packer cam Pcm.<br><br>
The ratchet rod Rd is a CI part. This arm fits on the<br>
top of slide rod S1d which moves up and down by means of a<br>
cam movement. The Can Packer Ratchet Rod Support Arm Sa<br>
holds the Ratchet Rod assembly, which is meant for packing<br>
jute sliver into the sliver can. Since the modification<br>
increases the diameter of the sliver can in order to increase<br>
the sliver content of each can, the can coiler plates are<br>
modified which shift the position of the can. So the Can<br>
Packer Ratchet Rod Support Arm requires modification and has<br>
been changed in the modified system to suit the new position<br>
of the sliver cans at Front/Delivery side of the machine.<br>
The faller bar F is moved forward by the rotation of<br>
left hand and right hand top faller screws (Sr, BSr), and hit<br>
by top cam Cm when it reaches the front end of top faller<br>
screws Sr. The faller F then drops on a bottom faller slide<br>
FS controller by front faller springs FFS and is then moved<br>
backward by the bottom faller screws BSr rotating in the<br>
opposite direction, until it reaches the rear end of the<br>
bottom faller screws and is lifted by bottom cans BCm<br>
controlled by a faller ruler FLr to top faller slides TFs.<br>
The faller F is then moved forward again by the top faller<br>
screws Sr. The top and bottom faller screws are connected by<br>
spur gears Sg. The top faller screw Sr has a bevel gear V at<br>
its end. This bevel gear V is driven by a bevel/bevel-<br>
compound gear which in turn is driven by a pinion through a<br>
shear pin arrangement on a long back shaft.<br><br>
There are 30 cans for 3:1 doubling machine or 40 cans<br>
for 4:1 doubling machine, with sliver at the feed end of the<br>
drawing frame, i.e., 1 sliver per gill of faller bars. 3 (or<br>
4) slivers from three (or four) adjacent gills are drawn<br>
through the grooves or slots in the doubling plate to<br>
delivery side, thereby effecting a 3:1 doubling or 4:1<br>
doubling. When a can is full, it is removed manually.<br>
The modification has been designed suCh that there is no<br>
change in the operation of the drawing frame. The only extra<br>
operation needed is placing and lifting of gill sliver<br>
dividers as and when required for removing short fibres from<br>
an extraction collection chamber.<br>
The improvements made in different parts of the drawing<br>
frame are hereinafter described with reference to Figs. 2 to<br>
36.<br>
The existing drawing roller A shown in Fig. 2 is made of<br>
hardened steel. It is also called as front roller. It has<br>
three sections joined together to form the roller. The<br>
roller has a long journal resting on a half white metal bush.<br>
The front/drawing roller Al according to the present<br>
invention is shown in Fig. 2A. It is also made of hardened<br>
steel. But it comprises 8 sections joined together by male<br>
and female thread connections. The drawing roller is mounted<br>
on ball bearings in a housing, so that it can work at a<br>
higher speed than drawing roller A. Further each section is<br>
of less length than the prior art drawing roller.<br><br>
The front/drawing roller draws sliver through gill pins<br>
of a faller bar (Fig. 15). The sliver passes over the<br>
drawing roller and is pressed by a rubber pressing<br>
roller (Figs. 25, 35) resting an the drawing roller Al. The<br>
pressure of the pressing roller is controlled by spring load.<br>
There are two retaining/back rollers Bl and B2 (Fig. 4)<br>
in the known machine. One of these rollers is slightly<br>
behind the other and both the front and rear retaining<br>
rollers have slightly different diameter. According to the<br>
present invention, the two retaining rollers Bf, Br (Fig. 5)<br>
have slightly different diameters and are made of steel. But<br>
each roller is made of 7 sections (B3', B4') as compared to 5<br>
sections Bl', B2' of the retaining rollers of existing<br>
machine. 7 sections are necessary for accommodating seven<br>
heads. The retaining rollers are used for holding or<br>
retaining the sliver at the feeding point in the machine<br>
while the front/drawing roller pulls the sliver against pins<br>
of the faller bar to draw a thinner sliver. The retaining<br>
rollers Bf, Br rotate at a lower speed than the drawing<br>
roller. The ratio of speed is preferably 1:5 to 1:6. This<br>
enables to reduce the weight as well as thickness of the<br>
sliver to the required level. The retaining roller holds the<br>
sliver by means of a jockey roller J (Figs. 1, 35) so that<br>
the drawing/front roller can draw the sliver properly.<br>
Figs. 6, 6A and 6B show a doubling plate LI of an<br>
existing machine. It is a cast iron +plate C having slots CI,<br>
C2 inclined from left and right directions and a central<br><br>
triangular slot; C3. The doubling plate L of the present<br>
invention (Figs. 7, 7A, 7B) has long slots Dl, D2, all<br>
inclined in the same direction, preferably at 45°. In these<br>
Figs., 6 slots (3 of Dl and 3 of D2) are provided. 3 or 4<br>
slivers drawn by the drawing roller are doubled up by these<br>
slots and led to a single delivery point. The doubling plate<br>
thus makes the three slivers to be laced one above the other,<br>
so that thick and thin places of one sliver neutralize the<br>
thin and thick places of the other two slivers. This<br>
doubling plate is much shorter in length than the prior art<br>
doubling plate of Fig. 6 and has long slots inclined in the<br>
same direction.<br>
The existing long back shaft bush system E is shown in<br>
Figs. 8 and 8A, 10 and 10A. It has a plain steel shaft<br>
supported in five gun metal bush supports. In the long back<br>
shaft bearing system El according to the present invention<br>
(Figs. 9 and 9A, 11 and 11A), the long back shaft is fitted<br>
by means of a bearing in a bearing housing to achieve a<br>
higher speed. It has seven bearing supports, and drives<br>
seven short back shafts through gear and sheer pin<br>
arrangements. The short back shafts drive the faller bars by<br>
means of spur and bevel gear arrangements.<br>
The Long Back Shaft provides drive to each head through<br>
a shear pin gear drive system, so that if one head becomes<br>
idle due to jamming of sliver or malfunctioning components,<br>
the shear pin of particular carriage will break and stop the<br>
head, whereas the other heads still run. Similarly the idle<br><br>
head can be restarted after repairing of the fault by<br>
replacing the shear pin and re-engaging the back shaft pinion<br>
with the short back shaft of the head. Long back shaft is<br>
connected with short back shaft only and it receives drive<br>
from the machine pulley through a chain of gears. Obviously<br>
at the pulley end of the machine, long back shaft has a gear<br>
fitted on it.<br>
Delivery roller Dl of existing machine shown in Figs.<br>
12, 12A and 12B has ten bosses and is fitted on half gun<br>
metal bush. Delivery roller D of the delivery roller bearing<br>
system (Figs. 13, 13A) according to the present invention is<br>
made of steel. Fourteen steel and hardened bosses are fitted<br>
on the delivery roller D by means of steel keys. The<br>
delivery roller D is fitted with seven ball bearings and<br>
housings to achieve higher delivery speed, and consequent<br>
increased production. The delivery roller boss draws the<br>
sliver from the doubling plate D (Fig. 7) by the pressure of<br>
the pressing roller boss fitted against the delivery roller<br>
boss with a device for controlling pressure on the sliver<br>
during drawing.<br>
Faller bars F (Fig. 14) comprise a flat bar Fl with two<br>
flat ends F2 joined to its two ends. The flat ends F2 are<br>
made of alloy steel and are hardened. The central section Fl<br>
is soft leaded steel bar. Gill pins F3 made of steel are<br>
provided in the central section Fl in two staggered rows.<br>
The gill pins comprise groups of pins, each group having 6 to<br>
8 pins. The groups of gill pins are arranged with a gap<br><br>
between adjacent groups. The number of faller bars depends<br>
on the number of heads. In the case of 2nd drawing, it is 28<br>
or 29. The faller bars can be linearly moved by means of<br>
faller screws Sr, BSr (Fig. 1A) which are rotated by drive<br>
from the long back shaft to short back shafts. These faller<br>
bars have to be replaced as and when the pins get blunt, bent<br>
or broken.<br>
In the faller bar of the present invention (Fig. 15),<br>
there are 6 groups of gill pins. But there is no appreciable<br>
gap between adjacent groups. Such elimination of gaps<br>
enables to reduce the length of the faller bar and to<br>
introduce two more heads, so that there are 7 heads instead<br>
of 5 heads. In order to overcome any problem of the fiber<br>
over-running to the adjacent sliver, a gill sliver divider or<br>
separator GSd (Figs. 35, 36) is provided. This will be<br>
described later.<br>
Sliver cans at the delivery side [DSc in Fig. 26] of the<br>
machine are placed on a coiler plate or disk H (Fig. 16)<br>
which is rotatable clockwise and anticlockwise alternately.<br>
By this, twisting of the sliver in the cans is avoided. The<br>
coiler plate is provided with a gear at its bottom side and<br>
is fitted on a stud fixed on a CI base plate (Figs. 18, 18A).<br>
In the existing machines, the coiler plate is suitable for<br>
sliver package size of 16" only. in the modified system<br>
since larger size cans of 18" diameter have to be<br>
accommodated in a smaller space, the coiler plate is modified<br>
as shown in Figs. 17, 17A, 19, 19A, 20, 20A, 21 and 21A.<br><br>
Coiler plate is a flat C.I. casting plate with raised<br>
C.I. rib around its periphery. There are threaded (tap)<br>
holes to fix studs which fit vertically on to a horizontally<br>
placed base plate H. Two studs around the periphery of the<br>
base plate are provided for fitting the two coiler plates H,<br>
while the other studs are for plate gears to connect drive to<br>
the coiler plates from the coiler motion shaft. H^ is an<br>
extension ring joined to existing coiler plate in order to<br>
increase the diameter for 18" can size. H3 is the gear teeth<br>
cut at the periphery at the back side of the coiler plate H;<br>
(Figs. 19, 19A).<br>
Each coiler plate is provided with two drives and the<br>
existing gears are changed by provision of additional gears.<br>
There is one base plate for each head, and each base plate<br>
has two coiler plates for carrying two sliver cans.<br>
The coiler plate is driven by mean% of a coiler motion<br>
shaft CS made of steel (Figs. 33, 34). The shaft is driven<br>
by a reversing motion wheel (MW) called mangle wheel at the<br>
main gable end GE of gable GB and drives the coiler plates by<br>
means of bevel gears fitted on the shaft CS and a plate<br>
pinion as can be seen from Figs. 33, 34 and 37. In the<br>
existing machine, the shaft is supported by bushes provided<br>
at the front side of the machine, outside the bottom front<br>
rail BFR. In the modified machine according to the present<br>
invention, the shaft CS is located inside the machine at the<br>
back of bottom front rail BFR, and is supported by bearing<br>
brackets CSB. These brackets are provided with ball bearings<br><br>
so that the coiler shaft CS can turn easily and they take any<br>
additional load of bigger sliver cans. The coiler motion<br>
shaft is driven by a mechanism to give a reciprocating motion<br>
to the shaft CS. While in the existing system, reversing<br>
wheel is directly connected to a gear fitted on the coiler<br>
shaft, in the modified system of the present invention a<br>
compound drive is used. It has a coiler shaft bearing<br>
housing hole at the gable and a chain drive.<br>
Carriage plates Cpp (Figs. 22, 22A, 23 and 23A) are CI<br>
stands for supporting various components such as retaining<br>
rollers, drawing rollers, long back shaft, short back shaft,<br>
doubling plate, delivery roller and the faller screws. In<br>
the existing machine, there are 6 carriage plates to give 5<br>
carriages. According to the present invention, two more<br>
carriage plates are provided to allow increase in the number<br>
of deliveries from 10 to 14 in the case of 2nd Drawing. To<br>
keep the overall length unchanged, there is a change in end<br>
carriage plate. Also the coiler plate which is provided near<br>
the main gable has provision for access to the driving pulley<br>
stud nut.<br>
A pressing roller P (Figs. 24, 24A, 25, 25A) is mounted<br>
on the drawing roller by means of suitable holder. This is<br>
an CI hollow roller (PR) covered with rubber R and is<br>
provided with a steel axle and bearings. The pressing roller<br>
P sits on the front/drawing roller (A/Al in Figs. 2 and 3).<br>
This roller is provided with a spring hook tensioning<br>
arrangement at each end of the axle. The sliver which passes<br><br>
over the drawing roller and under the pressing roller is<br>
pressed hard by this tensioning arrangement. The pressing<br>
roller is driven by the friction between the drawing roller<br>
and the pressing roller. The pressure of the pressing roller<br>
can be adjusted by means of the adjustable spring hook<br>
arrangement on its axle. The action of the pressing roller<br>
enables the sliver to be drawn by the front/drawing roller.<br>
In the known machines, the pressing rollers are sectional,<br>
i.e., there are six pressing rollers (two per assembly) and<br>
three adjustable spring hook tensioning arrangements. In<br>
contrast, in the machine of the present invention, there are<br>
seven pressing rollers to accommodate seven heads.<br>
The rear back roller drive Br (Fig. 1) in the existing<br>
machines is from the main gable side end through an inter-<br>
gear fitted between the carriage plate and the main gable.<br>
The gap between the carriage plate and the main gable is<br>
about 10". The rear retaining roller drive is accommodated<br>
in this gap. In the machine according to this invention,<br>
since additional heads are provided, they take up this gap.<br>
So, there is no space for fitting the drive gears and<br>
bracket. Therefore, the drive in the machine according to<br>
this invention is shifted to the other end of the machine.<br>
From Figs. 30 and 30A, it can be seen that sliver<br>
cylinder Sc (Fig. l) is connected to stud ST by means of a<br>
chain wheel CW1.. The stud ST is provided on a back-up right<br>
bracket. The stud ST is also connected to a chain wheel<br>
compound on a bracket BT mounted on main gable MG. Front and<br><br>
rear retaining rollers Bf and Br are mounted on the main<br>
gable. The front retaining roller Bf is connected to the<br>
chain wheel compound by means of a chain wheel CW2.<br>
For extracting small jute fibres from the sliver during<br>
its passage through the faller bar gills, the present<br>
invention provides a short fiber extraction system as shown<br>
in Figs. 29, 29A and 29B. This system comprises an air<br>
suction device under each head. A high power impeller I,<br>
located at the centre of the machine at its bottom, sucks the<br>
air from each head. Ducting and collecting chutes or hoppers<br>
CH are provided under each carriage or head. All the seven<br>
heads are connected by a common duct DT connected to the<br>
impeller suction mouth. A regulator is provided to ensure<br>
uniform suction at all the heads. This system reduces the<br>
clogging of fibres and dust with lubrication oil which<br>
overflows when manually applied. Also, it reduces<br>
maintenance problems and helps in achieving higher speed of<br>
the carriage or head.<br>
An electronic stop motion system is also provided as can<br>
be seen from Fig. 26. It is an infra-red sensing device Sm<br>
having an emitter and a reflector provided on the creel Fc<br>
and sliver cylinder Sc. Whenever any sliver from any can FSC<br>
at the feed side of the machine is broken or the can is<br>
empty, the sliver end will fall and cut the infra-red light<br>
line. This affects the reflector to stop the main motor. By<br>
this, the machine of the particular carriage/head will not<br>
run with a missing sliver. In the prior art, there was no<br><br>
electronic monitoring system and there was only a mechanical<br>
system which is not so sensitive and goes out of order very<br>
often. Also the electronic system of the present invention<br>
can be provided on 2 or 3 places on the creel, when the creel<br>
is bigger or longer, whereas in the prior art machines, the<br>
mechanical system can be located only at the long back shaft<br>
position.<br>
The drive in the existing system comprises a driving<br>
pulley Dpi (Fig. 27) . It has a CI socket in which the<br>
driving pulley and speed pinions are mounted to rotate around<br>
a driving pulley stud. In the machine according to this<br>
invention, the pulley (Figs. 28, 39) is provided with two<br>
ball bearings which are spaced apart by means of a spacer<br>
fitted onto the socket outer ring or bearing and on the<br>
socket driving pulley. The speed pinions are fitted on<br>
either side. The whole assembly rotates around the driving<br>
pulley stud since the inner ring of the bearing is tightly<br>
fitted on the stud. The driving pulley is a five-grooved "A"<br>
section 'V pulley getting drive from a 5 HP motor and is<br>
responsible for giving drive by means of train of gears to<br>
the various shafts, rollers, etc. This is shown in Fig. No.<br>
37.<br>
The creel consists of two or three rows of light<br>
aluminium roller sets at the back of the machine and is<br>
responsible for lifting the feed materials (jute sliver) from<br>
cans coming from preceding machine. Each set has five<br>
aluminium rollers approximately of the same width as each<br><br>
carriage. This creel, as already mentioned, lifts the feed<br>
slivers and conveys them to the Back or Retaining Roller, as<br>
shown in Fig. No. 38.<br>
There being no room to retain the existing drive to the<br>
creel from the retaining/back roller the drive to the creel<br>
is changed in the modified system. As shown in Fig. 17 this<br>
consists of new CI bracket, Steel Stud, Intermediate Wheel,<br>
Double Carrier Chain Wheel and Duplex Sprocket and Chain.<br>
Gill sliver separators GSd (Figs. 35 and 36) are<br>
provided for dividing adjacent slivers S, so that fibres from<br>
one sliver do not flow to the other. Otherwise, there will<br>
be irregularity in the slivers. The separator is made of<br>
brass sheet and has a length approximately same as the length<br>
of the faller screws. These separators are hinged near the<br>
retaining roller side and rest on levers and holding pins on<br>
the rubber pressing roller side, so that when required, a<br>
separator can be lifted to allow picking, cleaning,<br>
replacement and repair of the faller bar. These separators<br>
are adapted to go between adjacent slivers in the gill of the<br>
faller bar in each carriage. These are brass plates GSD<br>
which go in between two adjacent slivers in the gill of the<br>
faller bar in each carriage. This is provided to ensure that<br>
due to very close proximity in the modified system one sliver<br>
does not run over to the other sliver. This sliver separator<br>
also helps in improving the sliver regularity by controlling<br>
selvedge.<br><br>
Revolving Rubber Rollers are made of steel tube and are<br>
provided with flange and arbor at both ends. A flannel<br>
sleeve goes over the steel roller and is secured by end caps.<br>
These rollers are tensioned to 'press hard on the back side of<br>
the drawing/front roller, the purpose being to prevent fiber<br>
lapping on the drawing roller. The drawing roller moves<br>
anti-clockwise (looking from the front/delivery side of the<br>
machine) whereas revolving rubber roller rotates in the<br>
opposite direction. There is a drive at one end of each<br>
rubber roller and the rubber roller, the drive and the<br>
tensioning lever constitute the assembly. There are two<br>
coiled tension springs on the lever at each end of the roller<br>
to impart pressure on the drawing/front roller. In the<br>
modified system the roller has been shortened and the drive<br>
has been shifted to accommodate the assembly in a shorter<br>
space allowing rubber pressing roller spring wire to pass.<br>
These modification yield the following results:<br>
(a)	Increased production: 75-80% more production per machine<br>
per day<br>
(b)	Increased package: 25% more sliver in the cans at<br>
delivery<br>
(c)	Short fibre extraction<br>
(d)	Improved stop motions<br>
(e)	Less handling.<br>
The above will result in further advantages as under:<br>
(a) Number of 2nd Drawing machines required will be reduced<br>
by 75-80%. Suppose a mill has presently 16 nos. 2nd<br>
Drawing frames in their 3-drawing system of traditional<br><br>
Hessian &amp; sacking products and is planning to buy 5 Nos.<br>
new 2nd Drawings for a proposed 4-drawing system for<br>
their export yarn business.<br>
By incorporating the modification kits they will require<br>
only 9 machines for their ordinary product (3-drawing<br>
system) and the surplus 2nd Drawings can be used for the<br>
4-drawing system of export yarn processing.<br>
If there is still surplus 2nd Drawings the same can be<br>
used in the Skg. Weft processing line improvement and<br>
consistency in the Skg Weft performance.<br>
Obviously, the extra labour cost for operating 4-drawing<br>
system is avoided.<br>
The vexing problem of accommodating extra 2nd Drawings<br>
of 4-drawing operation is also avoided.<br>
Extra power cost is avoided.<br>
Bigger package/large diameter. Cans contain longer<br>
length of sliver which results in the following indirect<br>
but valuable advantages:<br>
Less splicing i.e. less irregularity<br>
Less stoppage of the machine i.e. less down time and<br>
more efficiency/production of the 3rd drawing<br>
Less handling<br>
Less wastage.<br><br>
