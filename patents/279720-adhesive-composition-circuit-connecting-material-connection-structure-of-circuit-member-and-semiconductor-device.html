				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
ADHESIVE COMPOSITION, CIRCUIT CONNECTING<br>
MATERIAL, CONNECTION STRUCTURE OF CIRCUIT<br>
MEMBER, AND SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE<br>
Technical Field<br>
(0001] The present invention relates to an adhesive composition, as<br>
well as to a circuit-connecting material and to a circuit connection<br>
structure and a semiconductor device that employ it.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002] Several different types of adhesive materials have been used in<br>
recent years in the fields of semiconductors and liquid crystal displays,<br>
for anchoring of electronic parts and ·for circuit ·connection. As such<br>
uses continue to require higher density and higher definition, the<br>
adhesives used must also exhibit higher adhesive force and reliability.<br>
The adherends used in bonding include printed circuit boards, organic<br>
substrates composed of heat resistant polymers such as polyimides, and<br>
metals such as copper, tin, nickel or aluminum and other inorganic<br>
materials such as ITO, SbN4 and Si02• Adhesives are also used for<br>
bonding between different types of the substrates mentioned above.<br>
The adhesives must therefore exhibit a wide range of properties in<br>
addition to superior adhesion, including high heat resistance and high<br>
reliability under high-temperature, high-humidity conditions, while<br>
also having a molecular design suitable for each adherend.<br>
[0003] In particular, anisotropic conductive adhesives having<br>
conductive particles dispersed in adhesives are employed as circuitconnecting<br>
materials· (circuit-connecting adhesives) used for<br>
connection between circuits such as between liquid crystal displays and<br>
TCPs, between FPCs and TCPs or between FPCs and printed circuit<br>
boards. Such adhesives used for semiconductors and liquid crystal<br>
displays have conventionally been thermosetting resin compositions<br>
comprising epoxy resins that exhibit high adhesion and high reliability<br>
(for example, see Patent document 1).<br>
[0004] The constituent components of thermosetting resm<br>
compositions include epoxy resins and curing agents such as phenol<br>
resins that are reactive with epoxy resins. Thermal latent catalysts<br>
that promote reaction between epoxy resins and curing agents are also<br>
sometimes included in adhesives. For example, one-pack type epoxy<br>
resin adhesives employing thermal latent catalysts are employed in<br>
film, paste or powder forms since they do not require mixture of the<br>
base compound (epoxy resin) and the curing agent and are convenient<br>
to use. The thermal latent catalysts are major factors determining<br>
curing temperature and curing speed, and various compounds are used<br>
as thermal latent catalysts from the viewpoint of room temperature<br>
storage stability and curing speed during heating.<br>
[0005] In actual adhesion steps using such adhesives, the adhesives<br>
are cured under curing conditions with a 170°C-250°C temperature for<br>
1-3 hours to obtain the desired adhesive force. However, as the<br>
increasing integration of semiconductor elements and higher precision<br>
of liquid crystal devices in recent years are leading to ever narrowing<br>
pitches between elements and wirings, the heating of curing can<br>
produce adverse effects on the surrounding materials. In addition, the<br>
electrode widths and electrode spacings are becoming even more<br>
extremely narrow while electrode heights are decreasing. Therefore,<br>
it is not always possible to achieve sufficient adhesive force with<br>
conventional circuit connection adhesives, and problems such as<br>
shifting of wirings can occur. Moreover, since another goal is to<br>
shorten the duration of adhesion steps to reduce cost, it is desirable to·<br>
accomplish curing and bonding at lower temperatures and in shorter<br>
times.<br>
[0006] Radical-type adhesives which combine radical polymerizing<br>
compounds such as acrylate derivatives or methacrylate derivatives<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "(meth)acrylate derivatives") with peroxides<br>
as radical polymerization initiators have become objects of interest in<br>
recent years as means of achieving lower temperature and shorter<br>
times. Radical curing with adhesives can be accomplished at low<br>
temperature and in a short period of time because of the high reactivity<br>
of the reactive radical species (for example, see Patent document 2).<br>
However, it has been noted that the adhesive strength is inferior to that<br>
of epoxy resins because of the high cure shrinkage during curing of the<br>
radical curing adhesives. It has been found that the adhesive strength<br>
for inorganic material or metal material substrates is particularly low.<br>
[0007] Methods of enhancing adhesive strength, such as methods of<br>
imparting pliability by including ether bonds in cured adhesives in<br>
order to increase the adhesive strength, have therefore been proposed<br>
(see Patent documents 3 and 4). Such enhancing methods employ<br>
urethane acrylate compounds as the radical polymerizing compounds.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0008] Nevertheless using the aforementioned urethane acrylate<br>
compounds can impart an excessive degree of pliability to cured<br>
adhesives, as a result of ether bonding. The physical properties of the<br>
adhesives are therefore inferior, due to reduction in the elastic modulus<br>
and glass transition temperature of the cured product, and impairment<br>
of its water resistance, heat resistance and mechanical strength. Such<br>
adhesives cannot exhibit adequate performance (adhesive strength,<br>
connection resistance, etc.) in reliability tests where they are allowed to<br>
stand under high temperature, high humidity conditions of 85°C/85%<br>
RH. The pressure-sensitive adhesive properties of such adhesives are<br>
also too strong, and therefore when a film-like adhesive is formed by<br>
laminating a layer of the adhesive onto a releasable support film, the<br>
adhesive is transferred onto the backing support film while transfer<br>
onto the adherend fails to occur satisfactorily.<br>
[0009] In order to obtain adhesives that cure and bond at lower<br>
temperatures and in shorter periods of time than the prior art, there may<br>
be employed thermal latent catalysts with low activation energy.<br>
However, using such thermal latent catalysts makes it extremely<br>
difficult to also achieve sufficient storage stability at near room<br>
temperature.<br>
[00 1 0] The present invention therefore provides an adhesive<br>
composition circuit-connecting material with an excellent balance of<br>
properties, which despite being a radical curing adhesive exhibits<br>
sufficiently high adhesive strength even for substrates composed of<br>
metals and inorganic materials, has adequately high storage stability<br>
and reliability at room temperature (20-30°C) and satisfactory transfer<br>
properties onto adherends, and can satisfactorily achieve temporary<br>
anchoring of flexible wiring boards and the like, as well as a circuit<br>
connection structure and semiconductor device that employ the above.<br>

Preferred organic peroxides have no more than 5000 ppm of chloride<br>

of circuit members can be further inhibited.<br>

bis(t-hexylperoxy)cyclohexane, 1,1-bis(t-butylperoxy)-3,3,5-<br>
trimethylcyclohexane, 1, 1-(t-butylperoxy)cyclododecane and 2,2-bis(tbutylperoxy)<br>
decane. They may also be used alone or in combinations<br>

[0042] As examples of dialkyl peroxides and their derivatives there<br>
may be mentioned a,a'-bis(t-butylperoxy)diisopropylbenzene, dicumyl<br>
peroxide, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(t-butylperoxy)hexane and t-butylcumyl<br>
peroxide. They may also be used alone or in combinations of two or<br>
more.<br>
[0043] As examples of hydroperoxides and their derivatives there<br>
may be mentioned diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide and cumene<br>
hydroperoxide. They may also be used alone or in combinations of<br>
two or more.<br>
[0044] As examples of silyl peroxides and their derivatives there may<br>
be ·mentioned t-butyltrimethylsilyl peroxide, bis(t-butyl)dimethylsilyl<br>

tris(t-butyl)vinylsilyl peroxide, t-butyltriallylsilyl peroxide, bis(tbutyl)<br>
diallylsilyl peroxide and tris(t-butyl)allylsilyl peroxide. They<br>
may also be used alone or in combinations of two or more.<br>
[0045] From the viewpoint of a satisfactory balance between stability,<br>
reactivity and compatibility, the radical generator is preferably a<br>
peroxyester or a derivative thereof having a 1 minute half-life<br>
temperature of 90-175°C and a molecular weight of 180-1000.<br>
[0046] In order to prevent corrosion of the connection terminals of the<br>
~<br>
16<br>
circuit members, the chloride ion or organic acid content of the radical<br>
generator is preferably no greater than 5000 ppm by weight. The<br>
radical generator is more preferably one with minimal production of<br>
organic acids after thermolysis. In order to improve the stability of<br>
the fabricated circuit-connecting material, the radical generator<br>
preferably has a mass retention of at least 20 wto/o after standing at<br>
room temperature and ordinary pressure for 24 hours. Here, the<br>
"mass retention" is the mass proportion of the radical generator<br>
remaining after standing based on the mass of the radical generator<br>
before standing.<br>
(0047] Such radical generators may also be used in admixture with<br>
triggers, inhibitors and the like.<br>
[0048] These radical generators are also preferably coated with a<br>
polyurethane-based or polyester-based polymer substance and made<br>
into microcapsules for an extended pot life.<br>
(0049] The mixing proportion of the radical generator in the adhesive<br>
composition is preferably 0.05-30 parts by weight and more preferably<br>
0.1-20 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the<br>
thermoplastic resin described hereunder. If the mixing proportion is<br>
below 0.05 part by weight the adhesive composition will tend to be<br>
difficult to cure, while if it exceeds 30 parts by weight the storage<br>
stability will tend to be lower.<br>
[0050] The thermoplastic resin used is not particularly restricted and<br>
may be any known one. As examples of such thermoplastic resins<br>
there may be mentioned polyimides, polyamides, phenoxy resins,<br>
poly(meth)acrylates, polyimides, polyurethanes, polyesters and<br>
.--}6-<br>
i7<br>
polyvinyl butyral, as well as their derivatives. They may also be used<br>
alone or in combinations of two or more. These thermoplastic resins<br>
may also have siloxane bonds or fluorine-substituted groups in the<br>
molecule. When such thermoplastic resins are used in admixture, the<br>
mixed thermoplastic resins are preferably either completely miscible or<br>
produce microphase separation to a state of opacity.<br>
[0051] The thermoplastic resin will exhibit more satisfactory film<br>
formability with a larger molecular weight, and the melt viscosity<br>
which affects the flow property as an adhesive may be set within a<br>
wide range. The molecular weight of the thermoplastic resin is not<br>
particularly restricted so long as it can achieve the object of the<br>
invention, but for most purposes the molecular weight is preferably<br>
5000-150,000 and more preferably 10,000-80,000 as the weightaverage<br>
molecular weight. A weight-average molecular weight of<br>
less than 5000 will tend to reduce the film formability, while greater<br>
than 150,000 will tend to lower the compatibility with the other<br>
components. Throughout the present specification, the weightaverage<br>
molecular weight is measured by GPC (gel permeation<br>
chromatography) and calculated based on standard polystyrene.<br>
[0052] The urethane (meth)acrylate having two or more radicalpolymerizing<br>
groups in the molecule and a weight-average molecular<br>
weight of 3000-30,000 is not particularly restricted so long as it is a<br>
compound with at least two urethane bonds and one or more<br>
(meth)acrylate structures in the molecule.<br>
[0053] The weight-average molecular weight of the urethane<br>
(meth)acrylate used for this embodiment is the value measured by GPC<br>
(gel permeation chromatography) and calculated based on standard<br>
polystyrene. From the viewpoint of improving the heat resistance,<br>
flow property and adhesion, the urethane (meth)acrylate for this<br>
embodiment preferably has a weight-average molecular weight of<br>
3000-30,000 and more preferably 5000-15,000. If the urethane<br>
(meth)acrylate has a weight-average molecular weight within the<br>
aforementioned numerical valu~ range, it will be possible to impart<br>
suitable adhesive force and pressure-sensitive adhesive force to the<br>
adhesive composition, to accomplish temporary anchoring with high<br>
temporary anchoring force for tape carrier packages (TCP), chip-onflexes<br>
(COF) and flexible printed circuit boards ·(FPC), and to obtain<br>
satisfactory transfer onto adherends. If the weight-average molecular<br>
weight is less than 3000, the crosslink density will be increased and<br>
cure shrinkage will tend to lower the adhesive strength of the adhesive<br>
composition. If the weight-average molecular weight of the urethane<br>
(meth)acrylate is less than 3000, the pressure-sensitive adhesive<br>
property of the adhesive composition will be increased. Therefore,<br>
when a tape product is formed by laminating a layer comprising the<br>
adhesive composition with a releasable support film and the product is<br>
wound around a winding core of several tens of meters or larger and<br>
allowed to stand for an extended period at room temperature, the layer<br>
comprising the adhesive composition is transferred onto the backing<br>
releasable support film, tending to prevent the desired tape product<br>
from being extracted from the reel. In addition, after the layer<br>
comprising the adhesive composition has been attached to a flexible<br>
wiring board, the layer cannot be easily released from the flexib.le<br>
wiring board and the repairability thus tends to be impaired. On the<br>
other hand, a weight-average molecular weight exceeding 30,000 will<br>
tend to lower the crosslink density and reduce the connection reliability<br>
of the adhesive composition. In addition, the pressure-sensitive<br>
adhesive property of the adhesive composition will become too weak,<br>
making it very difficult to achieve transfer onto circuit boards. Also,<br>
when a flexible wiring board is attached onto the layer comprising the<br>
adhesive composition, the flexible wiring board will be more prone to<br>
flaking.<br>
[0054] The weight-average molecular weights of the urethane<br>
(meth)acrylates mentioned throughout the present specification were<br>
measured under the following conditions.<br>

[0079] In general formula (I), the number of repeating units r is more<br>

compounds having OH groups at both ends.<br>
[0082] According to the invention, the 25°C viscosity of the urethane<br>
(meth)acrylate is preferably 5.0 Pa·s or greater. If the viscosity is less<br>

be reduced, thus tending to impair the workability and repairability.<br>

adhesive composition of the invention is preferably 10-250 parts by<br>
weight and more preferably 30-150 parts by weight with respect to 100<br>
parts by weight of the thermoplastic resin. If the mixing proportion is<br>
below 1 0 parts by weight the adhesive composition will tend to have<br>
lower heat resistance after curing, while if it exceeds 250 parts by<br>
weight the film formability will tend to be poor when the adhesive<br>
composition is used to form a film.<br>
[0084] The adhesive composition of the invention preferably further<br>

composition is preferably 0.1-15 parts by weight and more preferably<br>
0.5-10 parts by weight with respect to 50 parts by weight of the<br>
thermoplastic resin. If the mixing proportion is less than 0.1 part by<br>
weight, it may be difficult to obtain high adhesive strength. If the.<br>
mixing proportion exceeds 15 parts by weight, the cured adhesive<br>
composition will have inferior physical properties particularly in regard<br>
to adhesive strength, while the connection reliability will also be<br>
reduced.<br>
[0087] The adhesive composition of the invention also preferably<br>
contains conductive particles. This can impart even better connection<br>
reliability to the cured adhesive composition. The conductive<br>
particles are not particularly restricted so long as they have sufficient<br>
conductivity to permit electrical connection. As examples of<br>
conductive particles there may be mentioned metallic particles<br>

The conductive particles may also be in a multilayer form composed of<br>
particles with a core of non-conductive glass, ceramic, plastic or the<br>
like coated with a film comprising a conductive substance such as the<br>
aforementioned metals, or with particles comprising a conductive<br>
substance such as the aforementioned metals. The thickness of the<br>
coated film is preferably at least 10 nm in order to obtain more reliable<br>
conductivity.<br>
[0088] When using such multilayered conductive particles or heatfusible<br>
metallic particles as the conductive particles, the conductive<br>
particles will be deformable under heat and pressure. When using an<br>
adhesive composition containing such conductive particles for<br>
connection between circuits, therefore, the contact area between the<br>
circuit and the conductive particles will be increased, allowing<br>
variations in thickness between electrodes to be absorbed, and this is<br>
preferred from the standpoint of reliability.<br>
[0089] Also, fme particles obtained by further coating the surfaces· of<br>
conductive particles with a resin film can provide additional inhibition<br>
against shorting due to contact between the fine particles. Because<br>
insulation between electrode/circuit insulation can be improved,<br>
therefore, these may be added to the adhesive composition either alone<br>
or in admixture with conductive particles.<br>
[0090] The mean particle size of the conductive particles is preferably<br>
1-18 IJll1 from the viewpoint of obtaining excellent dispersibility and<br>
conductivity. The content of the conductive particles in the adhesive<br>
composition is preferably 0.1-30 vol%, more preferably 0.1-20 vol%<br>
and even more preferably 0.1-10 vol%. If the conductive particle<br>
..-3r<br>
33<br>
content is less than 0.1 part by volume the cured adhesive composition<br>
will tend to have inferior conductivity, while if it is greater than 30<br>
parts by volume, using the adhesive composition for connection<br>
between the circuits will render connections between the insulated<br>
circuits more prone to shorting. For the same reason, the conductive<br>
particle content is also preferably 0.5-30 parts by weight with respect to<br>
100 parts by weight of the thermoplastic resin.<br>
[0091] The conductive particle content is determined based on the<br>
volume of each component in the adhesive composition before curing<br>
at 23°C. The volume of each component may be the volume<br>
converted from mass based on the specific gravity. The volume may<br>
also be calculated as the increased volume resulting after loading the<br>
components into a vessel containing a suitable solvent (water, alcohol,<br>
etc.) that sufficiently wets the components, without dissolving or<br>
swelling the components in a graduated cylinder or the like.<br>
[0092] The adhesive composition of the invention may also be used<br>
with appropriately added adhesion aids such as coupling agents<br>
(alkoxysilane derivatives or silazane derivatives), adhesion enhancers,<br>
leveling agents and the like. Specifically, compounds represented by<br>
the following general formula (M) are preferred, and compounds<br>
represented by the following general formula (N) are more preferred.<br>

amino, methylamino, dimethylamino, benzylamino, phenylamino,<br>
cyclohexylamino, morpholino, piperazino, ureido or glycidyl, R35<br>
represents hydrogen or methyl, and g is an integer of 1-10.<br>
[0093] Preferred compounds represented by general formula (N) from<br>
the standpoint of high adhesion and electrical reliability are compounds<br>
wherein R31 is Cl-5 alkyl or aryl, R32 and R33 each independently<br>
represent a C2-3 alkoxy group and g is 2-4.<br>
[0094] These compounds may be used alone or in combinations of<br>
two or more.<br>
[0095] The adhesive composition of the invention may also contain a<br>
radical polymerizing compound other than the aforementioned urethane<br>
(meth)acrylate. Such radical polymerizing compounds are not<br>
particularly restricted so long as they are radical polymerizing, such as<br>
styrene derivatives or maleimide derivatives.<br>
[0096] As examples of radical polymerizing compounds there may be<br>
mentioned oligomers such as epoxy (meth)acrylate oligomers,<br>
polyether (meth)acrylate oligomers and polyester (meth)acrylate<br>
oligomers, and polyfunctional (meth)acrylate compounds such as<br>
trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate, polyethyleneglycol<br>

neopentylglycol di(meth)acrylate, dipentaerythritol hexa(meth)acrylate,<br>
isocyanuric acid-modified bifunctional (meth)acrylates and isocyanuric<br>
acid-modified trifunctional (meth)acrylates.<br>
[0097] These compounds may be used alone or in combinations of<br>
two or more.<br>
[0098] For improved flow properties, the adhesive composition of the<br>
invention may be combined with a monofunctional (meth)acrylate<br>
compound, in addition to the compounds mentioned above. As<br>
examples of monofunctional (meth)acrylate compounds there may be<br>
mentioned pentaerythritol (meth)acrylate, 2-cyanoethyl (meth)acrylate,<br>
cyclohexyl (meth)acrylate, dicyclopentenyl (meth)acrylate,<br>

[0099] These compounds may also be used alone or in combinations<br>
of two or more.<br>
[0100] For the purpose of improving the crosslinking rate, the<br>
adhesive composition of the invention may include appropriately added<br>
compounds with functional groups that polymerize by active radicals<br>
such as allyl, maleimide and vinyl groups, in addition to the<br>
aforementioned urethane (meth)acrylate or compound with other<br>
(meth)acryloyl groups. As specific examples of such compounds<br>
there may be mentioned N-vinylimidazole, N-vinylpyridine, Nvinylpyrrolidone,<br>
N-vinylfonnamide, N-vinylcaprolactam, 4.4'vinylidenebis(<br>
N,N-dimethylaniline ), N-vinylacetamide, N,Ndimethylacrylamide,<br>
N-isopropylacrylamide, N,N-diethylacrylamide<br>
and acrylamide.<br>
[0101] These compounds may be used alone or in combinations of<br>
two or more.<br>
[0102] The adhesive composition of the invention may further<br>
comprise a rubber component for the purpose of enhancing the stress<br>
relaxation and adhesion. As examples of rubber components there<br>
may be mentioned polyisoprene, polybutadiene, carboxyl-tenninated<br>
polybutadiene, hydroxy-terminated polybutadiene, 1 ,2-polybutadiene,<br>
carboxyl-terminated 1 ,2-polybutadiene, hydroxy-tenninated 1,2-<br>
polybutadiene, acrylic rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber, hydroxyterminated<br>
styrene-butadiene rubber, acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber,<br>
acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber having carboxyl, hydroxyl,<br>
(meth)acryloyl or morpholine groups at the polymer ends, carboxylated<br>
nitrile rubber, hydroxy-terminated poly( oxypropylene ), alkoxysilylterminated<br>
poly( oxypropylene ), poly( oxytetramethylene )glycol,<br>
polyolefin glycols, poly-e-caprolactone, and the like.<br>
[0103] Preferred among the aforementioned rubber components from<br>
the viewpoint of improving adhesion are rubber components having<br>
high polar cyano or carboxyl groups on side chams or the ends, while<br>
liquid rubber is preferred from the viewpoint of improving the flow<br>
property. As examples of such rubber components there may be<br>
mentioned liquid acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, liquid acrylonitrilebutadiene<br>
rubber having carboxyl, hydroxyl, (meth)acryloyl or<br>
morpholine groups at the polymer ends, and liquid carboxylated nitrile<br>
rubber. These rubber components preferably contain 10-60 wt% of<br>
acrylonitrile-derived polar groups.<br>
[0104] The rubber components may be used alone or in combinations<br>
of two or more.<br>
[0105] The adhesive composition of the invention can be given<br>
improved storage stability with appropriate addition of additives such<br>
as polymerization inhibitors, typified by t-butylpyrocatechol, tbutylphenol,<br>
p-methoxyphenol and the like.<br>
[0 1 06] Stabilizers may also be added to the adhesive composition of<br>
the invention for curing speed control and superior storage stability.<br>
Such stabilizers are not particularly restricted and may be any known<br>
stabilizers. Preferred among the known stabilizers are, for example,<br>
quinone derivatives such as benzoquinone and hydroquinone, phenol<br>
derivatives such as 4-methoxyphenol and 4-t-butylcatechol, aminoxyl<br>
derivatives such as 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl and 4-<br>
hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl, and hindered amine<br>
derivatives such as tetramethylpiperidyl methacrylate.<br>
[0 1 07] The amount of stabilizer added to the adhesive composition is<br>
preferably 0.01-30 parts by weight and niore preferably 0.05-10 parts<br>
by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the thermoplastic<br>
resin. If the amount of stabilizer added is less than 0.01 part by<br>
weight the effect of addition will tend to be reduced, while if it is<br>
greater than 30 parts by weight, compatibility with the other<br>
components will tend to be lower.<br>
[0 1 08] There may also be added to the adhesive composition of the<br>
invention components other than the additives mentioned above, such<br>
as fillers, softening agents, accelerators, age inhibitors, coloring agents<br>
and flame retardants.<br>
[0109] ·The adhesive composition of the invention may also be a<br>
multiphase composition comprising two or more phases having Tg<br>
(glass transition temperatures) differing by at least 5°C when cured.<br>
[0 11 0] The. adhesive composition of the invention may also be a<br>
combination of one according to the first embodiment and one<br>
according to the second embodiment described above. For example,<br>
the adhesive composition of the invention may be a combination of a<br>
urethane (meth)acrylate according to the first embodiment and a<br>
urethane (meth)acrylate according to the second embodiment.<br>
[0 111] An adhesive of the invention may be used in paste form if it is<br>
a liquid at ordinary temperature (25°C). If it is a solid at room<br>
temperature (25°C), it may be heated for use, or formed into a paste<br>
using a solvent. There are no particular restrictions on the solvent<br>
used so long as it can thoroughly dissolve the adhesive components<br>
without reacting with any of the components in the adhesive<br>
composition. Such solvents having boiling points of 50-150°C at<br>
ordinary pressure are preferred. If the boiling point is below 50°C,<br>
volatilization will tend to occur while standing at room temperature,<br>
thus limiting use in open systems. If the boiling point is higher than<br>
150°C, volatilization of the solvent will be hampered, tending to<br>
adversely affect the reliability after bonding.<br>
[0112] The adhesive composition of the invention may also be used<br>
after its shaping into a film. The method of forming a film of the<br>
adhesive composition (adhesive film) may be the following, for<br>
example. First, a solution obtained by adding a solvent as necessary<br>
to the adhesive composition is coated onto a releasable base such as a<br>
fluorine resin film, polyethylene terephthalate film or release sheet to<br>
form a coated film. Next, the solvent is removed to convert the coated<br>
film to a solid or semi-solid state and obtain an adhesive film.<br>
Alternatively, the solution may be impregnated into a base material<br>
such as a nonwoven fabric and placed over a releasable base, and the<br>
solvent removed to obtain an adhesive film. Using the adhesive<br>
composition as a film can provide further advantages from the<br>
viewpoint of manageability.<br>
(0113] The adhesive composition of the invention may also be<br>
directly coated onto an adherend or placed on an adherend as an<br>
adhesive film, and then subjected to heat and pressure for bonding onto<br>
the adherend. The heating temperature is not particularly restricted<br>
but is preferably 1 00-250°C. The pressure is not particularly<br>
restricted so long as it is in a range that does not damage the adherend,<br>
but normally a range of 0.1-10 MPa is preferred. The heat and<br>
pressure are preferably applied for 0.5-120 seconds, and bonding can<br>
be achieved even with heat and pressure at 140-200°C, 3 MPa for 10<br>
seconds. After connection, the adhesive composition may be<br>
subjected to post-curing. The connection may also be accomplished<br>
using, instead of heat and pressure, some energy other than heat, such<br>
as light, ultrasonic waves or electromagnetic waves.<br>
[0114] The adhesive of the invention rriay be used as an adhesive for<br>
adherends with different thermal expansion coefficients. Specifically,<br>
it may be used as a circuit-connecting material such as an anisotropic<br>
conductive adhesive, silver paste, silver film or the like, or as a<br>
semiconductor element adhesive material such as a CSP elastomer,<br>
CSP underfill material, LOC tape or the like.<br>
[0115] When the adhesive composition is molded into a film to<br>
produce an adhesive film and temporarily anchored onto a flexible<br>
wiring board, the temporary anchoring strength on the flexible wiring<br>
board is preferably 50 gf/cm-150 gf/cm. A temporary anchoring<br>
strength of greater than 150 gf/cm will be excessive pressure-sensitive<br>
adhesion, tending to hamper removal after attachment of flexible<br>
wiring boards onto the adhesive film (circuit connection adhesive) and<br>
lower the repairability. On the other hand, a temporary anchoring<br>
strength of less than 50 gf/cm will be insufficient pressure-sensitive<br>
adhesion, tending to result in flaking of the flexible wiring board from<br>
the adhesive film. When the molecular structure of the urethane<br>
(meth)acrylate does not include an ether structure, the pliability and<br>
adhesion of the cured adhesive will be insufficient, thus significantly<br>
. 40<br>
err<br>
lowering the connection reliability.<br>
[0 116] The temporary anchoring strength onto flexible wiring boards<br>
is measured in the following manner. First, a 15 J.ll1l adhesive film<br>
(circuit-connecting material) with a thickness of 15 J.ll1l is temporarily<br>
contacted bonded onto a PWB (printed wiring board) or a circuitformed<br>
glass substrate, under conditions of 80°C, 1 :rv.tPa, 3 seconds.<br>
The flexible wiring board is then contact bonded onto the adhesive film<br>
under conditions of 23°C, 0.5 :rv.tPa, 5 seconds. The flexible wiring<br>
board is released from the adhesive · filni under conditions with a<br>
temperature of 23±3°C, a pull direction of 90° and a pull speed of 50<br>
mm/min. The flexible wiring board and circuited-formed glass<br>
substrate had the following dimensions.<br>
Flexible wiring board: 75 J.LIIl polyimide film, 1/2 Oz (ounces), copper<br>
foil tin plating, 0.2 mm pitch, electrode width/electrode spacing= 111.<br>
Glass substrate: 15-20 n/o, total copper surface electrode by<br>
sputtering, 1.1 mm thickness.<br>
[0 117] The circuit member connection method of the invention will<br>
now be explained using a preferred mode. Fig. 1 is a simplified crosssectional<br>
view showing an embodiment of a circuit member connection<br>
structure according to the invention. As shown in Fig. 1, the circuit<br>
member connection structure of this embodiment is provided with a<br>
first circuit member 20 and second circuit member 30 which face each<br>
other, and a circuit-connecting member 10 is provided between the first<br>
circuit member 20 and second circuit member 30 and connects them.<br>
[0118] The first circuit member 20 is provided with a circuit board<br>
(first circuit board) 21 and a circuit electrode (first circuit electrode) 22<br>
...4-tl(<br>
Z--<br>
formed on the main surface 21 a of the circuit board 21. An insulating<br>
layer (not shown) may also be formed on the main surface 21a of the<br>
circuit board 21.<br>
[0119] The second circuit member 30 is provided with a circuit board<br>
(second circuit board) 31 and a circuit electrode (second circuit<br>
electrode) 32 formed on the main surface 31a of the circuit board 31.<br>
An insulating layer (not shown) may also be formed on the main<br>
surface 31 a of the circuit board 31. The circuit boards 21, 31 may be<br>
made of inorganic materials such as semiconductors, glass or ceramics,<br>
organic substances such as polyimides, polycarbonates, polyesters or<br>
polyethersulfones, or compound materials composed of such inorganic<br>
or organic substances (for example, glass/polyepoxy resin).<br>
[0120] The first and second circuit members 20, 30 are not<br>
particularly restricted so long as electrodes requiring electrical<br>
connection are formed thereon. Specifically, there may be mentioned<br>
glass substrates or plastic substrates, printed circuit boards, ceramic<br>
wiring boards, flexible wiring boards and the like on which electrodes<br>
are formed by ITO for use in liquid crystal display devices, and they<br>
may also be used in combination as necessary.<br>
[0121] The circuit-connecting member 10 comprises an insulating<br>
substance 11 and conductive particles 7. The conductive particles 7<br>
are situated not only between the facing circuit electrode 22 and circuit<br>
electrode 3 2, but also between the main surfaces 21 a, 31 a. In the<br>
circuit member connection structure, the circuit electrodes 22, 32 are<br>
electrically connected through the conductive particles 7. That is, the<br>
conductive particles 7 are in direct contact with both of the circuit<br>
electrodes 22, 32.<br>
[0 1221, The conductive particles 7 correspond to the conductive<br>
particles which may be present in the adhesive composition of the<br>
invention as described above.<br>
[0123] In this circuit member connection structure, the circuit<br>
electrode 22 and circuit electrode 32 which are facing each other are<br>
electrically connected through the conductive particles 7 as mentioned<br>
above. Connection resistance between the circuit electrodes 22, 32<br>
can therefore be sufficiently reduced. As a result it is possible to<br>
achieve a smooth flow of current between the circuit electrodes 22, 32,<br>
thereby allowing the function of the circuit to be satisfactorily<br>
exhibited. When the circuit-connecting member 10 does not contain<br>
conductive particles 7, the circuit electrode 22 and circuit electrode 32<br>
come into direct contact to form an electrical connection.<br>
[0124] As explained below, the circuit-connecting member 10 is·<br>
composed of the cured product of a circuit-connecting material<br>
containing the adhesive composition. Thus, even if the circuit boards<br>
21, 31. and the circuit electrodes 22, 32 are composed of different<br>
materials, the adhesive strength of the circuit-connecting member 1 0 on<br>
the circuit member 20 or 30 will be sufficiently high. Adequately<br>
high adhesive strength will also be maintained for prolonged periods in<br>
a circuit member connection structure. It is therefore possible to<br>
prevent changes in the distance between the circuit electrodes 22, 32<br>
with time, so that long-term reliability of the electrical characteristics<br>
between the circuit electro~es 22,32 can be increased.<br>
[0125] A process for production of a circuit member connection<br>
structure will now be explained.<br>
[0 126] First, the first circuit member · 20 and circuit-connecting<br>
material film 40 described above are prepared (see Fig. 2(a)). The<br>
circuit-connecting material film 40 is obtained by forming the circuitconnecting<br>
material into a film, and it may also be laminated with a<br>
releasable support film. The circuit-connecting material film 40 is<br>
usually pulled out from being wound on a winding core, and cut to the<br>
necessary length. Since the circuit-connecting material film 40 in this<br>
case includes an adhesive composition of the invention, lamination<br>
with a support film and pulling out from a wound state will not result in<br>
unsatisfactory back-side transfer of the circuit-connecting material film<br>
40 onto the support film. The poor adhesion and poor connection that<br>
occurs with back-side transfer onto support films are therefore<br>
prevented.<br>
[0 127] The circuit-connecting material comprises an adhesive<br>
composition 5 containing . conductive particles 7. The adhesive<br>
composition 5 used contains the structural materials described above.<br>
Even if the circuit-connecting material does not contain conductive<br>
particles 7, the circuit-connecting material can be used as an insulating<br>
adhesive for anisotropic conductive bonding, in which case it is often<br>
referred to as NCP (Non-Conductive Paste). When the circuitconnecting<br>
material contains conductive particles 7, the circuitconnecting<br>
material may be referred to as an ACP (Anisotropic<br>
Conductive Paste).<br>
(0 128] The content of the conductiv~ particles 7 in the circuitconnecting<br>
material is preferably 0.1-30 vol% and more preferably 1.0-<br>
20 vol% with respect to the total of the circuit-connecting material.<br>
With a content of less than 0.1 vol%, it may be difficult to achieve<br>
satisfactory conduction. At greater than 30 vol%, on the other hand, ·<br>
shorting may occur with adjacent circuits.<br>
(0129] The thickness of the circuit-connecting material film 40 is<br>
preferably 5-50 Jlnl· If the thickness of the circuit-connecting material<br>
film 40 is less than 5 Jlnl, the circuit-connecting material may not<br>
sufficiently fill the space between the circuit electrodes 22, 32. On<br>
the other hand, a thickness exceeding 50 J.LIIl may make it difficult to<br>
sufficiently remove the adhesive composition between the circuit<br>
electrodes 22, 32, often to an extent hampering conduction between the<br>
circuit electrodes 22, 32.<br>
[0130] The circuit-connecting material film 40 is placed over the side<br>
of the first circuit member 20 on which the circuit electrode 22 has<br>
been formed. When the circuit-connecting material film 40 is<br>
attached to a support (not shown), it is placed on the first circuit<br>
member 20 with the circuit-connecting material film 40 side facing the<br>
first circuit member 20. The circuit-connecting material film 40 is a<br>
film and is therefore easy to handle. Since it is therefore easy to<br>
situate the circuit-connecting material film 40 between the first circuit<br>
member 20 and second circuit member 3 0, connection between the first<br>
circuit member 20 and second circuit member 3 0 is facilitated.<br>
[0131] The circuit-connecting material film 40 is pressed m the<br>
directions of the arrows A and B in Fig. 2(a) to temporarily anchor<br>
(temporarily connect) the circuit-connecting material film 40 to the first<br>
circuit member 20 (see Fig. 2(b)). The pressing may be accompanied<br>
by heating. However, the heating must be at a temperature that does<br>
not cure the adhesive composition in the circuit-connecting' material<br>
film 40. Since the circuit-connecting material film 40 comprises an<br>
adhesive composition of the invention, satisfactory temporary<br>
anchoring is accomplished even when the first circuit member 20 is a<br>
flexible wiring board.<br>
[0132] When the circuit-connecting material film 40 is laminated with<br>
a support film (not shown}, the support film is released. In this case,<br>
the circuit-connecting material film 40 which comprises an adhesive<br>
composition of the invention allows the support film to be satisfactorily<br>
released.<br>
[0133] The circuit-connecting material film 40 is then irradiated with<br>
active light rays .. Next, as shown in Fig. 2(c), the second circuit<br>
member 30 is placed on the circuit-connecting material film 40 with the<br>
second circuit electrode facing the first circuit member 20. When the<br>
circuit-connecting material film 40 is attached to a support (not shown),<br>
the second circuit member 30 is placed on the circuit-connecting<br>
material film 40 after releasing the support.<br>
[0134] The circuit-connecting material film 40 is pressed, while<br>
heating, via the frrst and second circuit members 20, 3 0 in the<br>
directions of the arrows A and B in Fig. 2( c). The heating is carried<br>
out at a temperature that allows curing of the adhesive composition of<br>
the invention. The circuit-connecting material film 40 is thus cured,<br>
forming the main connection to obtain a circuit member connection<br>
structure as shown in Fig. 1. The connection conditions are<br>
appropriately selected according to the purpose of use and according to<br>
the adhesive composition and circuit member.<br>
[0135] For example, the heating temperature may be 50-250°C and<br>
preferably 50-190°C, while the pressure will generally be 0.1-10 MPa,<br>
and the time required for heating and pressing (connection time) is 1<br>
second-! 0 minutes and preferably 1-10 seconds.<br>
[0136] As mentioned above, fabrication of a circuit member<br>
connection structure allows the conductive particles 7 to contact with<br>
both of the facing circuit electrodes 22, 32 in the circuit member<br>
connection structure, thus adequately reducing connection resistance<br>
between the circuit electrodes 22, 32.<br>
[0137] Heating of the circuit-connecting material film 40 cures the<br>
adhesive composition 5 to form an insulating material 11 with a<br>
sufficiently small distance between the. circuit electrode 22 and circuit<br>
electrode 32, so that the first circuit member 20 and· second circuit<br>
member 30 are firmly bonded via the circuit-connecting member 10.<br>
That is, since the circuit-connecting member 10 in the obtained circuit<br>
member connection structure is constructed of the cured circuitconnecting<br>
material comprising the adhesive composition, the adhesive<br>
strength of the circuit-connecting member 1 0 for the circuit member 20<br>
or 30 is sufficiently high, the adhesive strength being sufficiently high<br>
particularly under high-temperature, high-humidity conditions.<br>
Adequately high adhesive strength will also be maintained for<br>
prolonged periods in the circuit member connection structure. It is<br>
therefore possible to prevent changes in the distance between the<br>
circuit electrodes 22, 32 of the obtained circuit member connection<br>
structure with time, so that long-term reliability of the electrical<br>
characteristics between the circuit electrodes 22,32 can be increased.<br>
(0138] A preferred embodiment of a semiconductor device of the<br>
invention will now be explained. Fig. 3 is a simplified cross-sectional<br>
view showing an embodiment of a semiconductor device according to<br>
the invention. As shown in Fig. 3, the semiconductor device 2 of this<br>
embodiment comprises a semiconductor element 50 and a substrate 60<br>
serving as the support member for the semiconductor, and a<br>
semiconductor element connecting member 40 is provided between the<br>
semiconductor element 50 and the substrate 60 for electrical connection<br>
between them. The semiconductor element connecting member 40 is<br>
laminated on the main suiface 60a of the semiconductor 60, while the<br>
semiconductor element 50 is further laminated on the semiconductor<br>
element connecting member 40.<br>
[0139] The substrate 60 is provided with a circuit pattern 61, and the<br>
circuit pattern 61 is electrically connected with the semiconductor<br>
element 50, either directly or via the semiconductor connecting<br>
member 40, on the main swface 60a of the substrate 60. These are<br>
sealed with a sealing material 70 to form the semiconductor device 2.<br>
(0 140] There are no particular restrictions on the material of the<br>
semiconductor element 50, and there may be used Group 4<br>
semiconductor elements such as silicon or germanium, Group III-V<br>
compound semiconductor elements such as GaAs, InP, GaP, InGaAs,<br>
InGaAsP, AlGaAs, InAs, GainP, AlinP, AlGalnP, GaNAs, GaNP,<br>
GainNAs, GalnNP, GaSh, InSb, GaN, AlN, InGaN and InNAsP,<br>
Group II-VI compound semiconductor elements such as HgTe,<br>
HgCdTe, CdMnTe, CdS, CdSe, MgSe, MgS, ZnSe and ZeTe, and<br>
CuinSe (CIS) or the like.<br>
[0 141] The semiconductor element connecting member 40 includes<br>
an insulating material 11 and conductive particles 7. The conductive<br>
particles 7 are situated not only between the semiconductor element 50<br>
and circuit pattern 61, but also between the semiconductor element 50<br>
and the main surface 60a. In the semiconductor device 2 of this<br>
embodiment, the semiconductor element 50 and circuit pattern 61 are<br>
electrically connected via the conductive particles 7. Connection<br>
resistance between the semiconductor element 50 and circuit pattern 61<br>
is therefore adequately reduced. Consequently, smooth current flow<br>
can be achieved betWeen the semiconductor element 50 and circuit<br>
pattern 61, to allow the function of the semiconductor to be adequately<br>
exhibited. In addition, adding the conductive particles 7 in the<br>
proportion mentioned above can create electrical connection<br>
anisotropy.<br>
[0142] When the semiconductor element connecting member 40 lacks<br>
the conductive particles 7, electrical connection is accomplished by<br>
direct contact or sufficient proximity between the semiconductor<br>
element 50 and circuit pattern 61 for the desired volume of current to<br>
flow.<br>
[0143] Since the semiconductor element connecting member 40 is<br>
composed of the cured adhesive composition containing the adhesive<br>
composition described above, the adhesive strength of the<br>
semiconductor element connecting member 40 for the semiconductor<br>
element 50 and substrate 60 is satisfactorily high, and the condition can<br>
be maintained for prolonged periods. Consequently, long-term<br>
reliability of electrical characteristics can be increased between the<br>
semiconductor element 50 and substrate 60. Although a circuitconnecting<br>
material film 40 was used for fabrication of the circuit<br>
member connection structure in the embodiment described above, a<br>
circuit-connecting material may ~e used instead of the circuitconnecting<br>
material film 40. In this case as well, dissolving the<br>
circuit-connecting material in a solvent and coating and drying the<br>
solution on either or both the first circuit member 20 and second circuit<br>
member 30 can form a circuit-connecting material between the first and<br>
second circuit members 20, 30.<br>
(0144] Another conductive material may also be used instead of<br>
conductive particles 7. As other conductive materials there may be<br>
mentioned particulate or staple fiber carbon, or metal wires such as Auplated<br>
Ni wire.<br>

The obtained adhesive film was used for connection between a flexible<br>
wiring board (FPC) having 500 copper circuits, with a line width of 25<br>
jllll, a pitch of 50 jll1l and a thickness of 18 J.llll, and a glass substrate<br>
(thic~ess: 1.1 mm, surface resistance: 200/o) having a 0.20 jll1l-~ck<br>
indium oxide tin {ITO) thin-layer formed thereon, in the following<br>
manner. FirSt, the adhesive film was situated on a glass substrate with<br>
an ITO thin-layer already formed on its surface (hereinafter referred to<br>
as "ITO-coated glass substrate"), so that the surface opposite the side<br>
with the support film was facing the surface of the ITO thin-layer of the<br>
ITO-coated glass substrate. Next, the adhesive film and ITO-coated<br>
glass substrate were pressed via the support film while heating at 70°C,<br>
1 MPa for 3 seconds, for temporary connection of the adhesive film on<br>
the ITO~coated glass substrate. The support film was then released<br>
from the adhesive film for transfer of the adhesive film onto the ITOcoated<br>
glass substrate. Next, a flexible wiring board (FPC) with 600<br>
tin-plated copper circuits, having a pitch of 50 J1tll and a thickness of 8<br>
J.Uil, was situated on the adhesive film. These were then pressed in the<br>
direction of lamination at 24°C, 0.5 MPa for 1 second to obtain a<br>
temporarily anchored laminate. The laminate was situated at a<br>
prescribed position in a thermocompression bonding apparatus (heated<br>
system: constant heating, product of Toray Engineering), and pressing<br>
was carried out in the direction of lamination while heating at 175°C, 3<br>
MPa for 15 seconds. The ITO-coated glass substrate and flexible<br>
wiring board were thus connected via a circuit-connecting member<br>
across a width of2 mm to fabricate a circuit connection structure.<br>

[0 160] (Evaluation of temporary anchoring force)<br>
The temporary anchoring force on the flexible wiring board was<br>
measured in the manner described above. The results are shown in<br>

[0161] (Example 5)<br>
There were prepared a semiconductor chip (3 x 10 mm, height: 0.5<br>
mm, with 100 Jllll-square gold electrodes (bumps) protruding to a<br>
height of 20 J.lii1 on the four peripheral sides of the main surface) and a<br>
semiconductor mounting substrate fabricated from a 1 mm-thick<br>
glass/epoxy substrate having connection terminals corresponding to the<br>
bump positions (18 J.LIIl-thick circuits formed of copper foil). The<br>
surface of the circuit on the semiconductor mounting substrate was<br>
nickel/gold plated. The protruding electrodes of the semiconductor<br>
chip and the semiconductor mounting substrate were connected in the<br>
following manner using the adhesive film of Example 2 described<br>
above. The circuit side of the semiconductor mounting substrate was<br>
temporarily contact bonded at 80°C, 1 MPa for 3 seconds with an<br>
adhesive film that was laminated with a support film. After then<br>
releasing the support film, the protruding electrodes of the<br>
semiconductor chip were positioned with the semiconductor mounting<br>
substrate and thermocompression bonding was carried out for 20<br>
seconds at a temperature and pressure of 180°C, 10 kgf/chip.<br>
(0 162] This accomplished electrical connection between the<br>
protruding electrodes of the semiconductor chip and the circuit of the<br>
semiconductor mounting substrate via the adhesive film. The<br>
electrodes of the semiconductor chip and the semiconductor mounting<br>
substrate were kept in this connected state by curing of the adhesive<br>
film by the thermocompression bonding. The semiconductor device<br>
obtained in this manner by connecting the semiconductor chip and<br>
semiconductor mounting substrate was subjected to a thermal cycle<br>
test, repeating a cycle of (-55°C, 30 min)/(i25°C, 30 min). The<br>
thermal cycle test was repeated for 1000 cycles, and then the<br>
connection resistance between the semiconductor chip protruding<br>
electrodes and the substrate circuit was measured. As a result,<br>
virtually no increase in connection resistance was observed,<br>
demonstrating that satisfactory connection reliability was exhibited~<br>
[0163) As mentioned above, the adhesive compositions of Examples·<br>
1-4 according to the invention used for connection between circuits or<br>
the like provided sufficiently low connection resistance, and even after<br>
120 hours of holding in a high-temperature, high-humidity tank there<br>
was virtually no change from the resistance immediately after<br>
connection. The adhesive strength was likewise satisfactory.<br>
[0164] In contrast, the adhesive compositions of. Comparative<br>
Examples 1 and 2, which employed urethane (meth)acrylates with a<br>
weight-average molecular weight of less than 3000 or greater than<br>
30,000, either already had high connection resistance immediately after<br>
connection between the circuits, or had high connection resistance after<br>
120 hours in the high-temperature, high-humidity tank. Also, because<br>
the temporary anchoring force was less than 50 gf/cm, the pressuresensitive<br>
adhesive force was weak and the flexible wiring board readily<br>
peeled from the circuit-connecting adhesive.<br>
[0 165] The adhesive composition of the invention has a superior<br>
balance of properties, exhibiting a satisfactory transfer property and<br>
providing good temporary anchoring onto flexible circuit boards, while<br>
also having excellent storage stability and connection reliability.<br>

(0176] (Fabrication ofdrcuit connection)<br>
The obtained adhesive film was used for connection between a flexible<br>
wiring board (FPC) having 500 copper circuits, with a line width of 25<br>
llffi, a pitch of 50 llffi and a thickness of 8 JUil, and a glass substrate<br>
(thickness: 1.1 mm, surface resistance: 20 a /o) having a 0.20 l!ffi-thick<br>
indium oxide tin (ITO) thin-layer formed thereon, in the following<br>
manner. First, the adhesive film was situated on a glass substrate with<br>
an ITO thin-layer already formed on its surface (hereinafter referred to<br>
as "ITO-coated glass substrate"), so that the surface opposite the side<br>
with the support film was facing the surface of the ITO thin-layer of the<br>
ITO-coated glass substrate. Next, the adhesive film and ITO-coated<br>
glass substrate were pressed via the support film while heating at 70°C,<br>
1 :MPa for 3 seconds, for temporary connection of the adhesive film on<br>
the ITO-coated glass substrate. The support film was then released<br>
from the adhesive film for transfer of the adhesive film onto the ITOcoated<br>
glass substrate. Next, a flexible wiring board (FPC} with 600<br>
tin-plated copper circuits, having a pitch of 50 J.lli1 and a thickness of 8<br>
~' was situated on the adhesive film. These were then pressed in the<br>
direction of lamination at 24°C, 0.5 .MPa for 1 second to obtain a<br>
temporarily anchored laminate. The laminate was situated at a<br>
prescribed position in a thermocompression bonding apparatus (heated<br>
system: constant heating, product of Toray E~gineering), and pressing<br>
was carried out in the direction of lamination while heating at 160°C, 3<br>
l'APa for 10 seconds. The ITO-coated glass substrate and flexible<br>
wiring board were thus connected via a circuit-connecting member<br>
across a width of 2 nun to fabricate a circuit connection structure.<br>
[0 177] (Measurement of connection resistance)<br>
The resistance value between adjacent circuits of the circuit connection<br>
structure was measured with a multimeter, immediately after bonding<br>
and after holding for 168 hours in a high-temperature, high-humidity<br>
environment of 85°C, 85% RH. The results are shown in Table 4.<br>
The resistance value was represented as the average of 37 points of<br>
resistance between adjacent circuits (x+3cr; x = mean value, cr =<br>
standard deviation).<br>

(0 179] (Measurement of adhesive strength)<br>
The adhesive strength between the flexible wiring board and the ITOcoated<br>
glass substrate in the. circuit connection structure was measured<br>
by the 90° peel method according to llS-Z0237. The measuring<br>
apparatus used for the adhesive strength was a TENSILON UTM-4 by<br>
Toyo Baldwin Co., Ltd. {peel rate: SO mm/min, 25°C). The results<br>
are shown in Table 4.<br>
[0180] When using the adhesive films of Examples 6-8, satisfactory<br>
connection resistance and adhesive strength were exhibited<br>
immediately after bonding and after holding for 168 hours in a hightemperature,<br>
high-humidity environment of 85°C, 85% RH. On the<br>
other hand, when using the adhesive film of Comparative Example 3,<br>
the connection resistance value was satisfactory immediately after<br>
bonding but the connection resistance value increased after holding for<br>
168 hours in a high-temperature, high-humidity environment of 85°C,<br>
85% RH (reliability test). The adhesive strength immediately after<br>
bonding was also lower compared to Examples 6-8, while the reduction<br>
in adhesive· strength after the reliability test was significant. In<br>
Comparative Example 4, the connection resistance was satisfactory but<br>
low adhesive strength was exhibited both immediately after bonding<br>
and after the reliability test. This demonstrated that using a urethane<br>
(meth)acrylate with the specific structure according to the invention<br>
can provide satisfactory connection resistance and adhesive strength.<br>
(0 181] (Example 9)<br>
The adhesive film obtained in Example 6 was vacuum packaged and<br>
allowed to stand at 40°C for three days. Thermocompression bonding<br>
of a flexible wiring board and ITO-coated glass substrate was. then<br>
carried out in the same manner as Example 6 to fabricate a circuit<br>
connection structure. Measurement of the adhesive strength ·and<br>
connection resistance of the obtained circuit connection structure<br>
revealed an adhesive strength of 720 N/m and a connection resistance<br>
of 1.6 n, thus demonstrating an excellent shelf life (storage stability).<br>
[0182] (Example 10)<br>
There were prepared a semiconductor chip (3 x 10 mm, height: 0.5<br>
mm, with 100 J.Ull-square gold electrodes (bumps) protruding to a<br>
height of 20 J.1Ill on the four peripheral edges of the main surface) and a<br>
semiconductor mounting substrate fabricated from a 1 mm-thick<br>
glass/epoxy substrate having connection terminals corresponding to the<br>
bump positions (18 J.Uil-thick circuits formed of copper foil). The<br>
surface of the circuit on the semiconductor mounting substrate was<br>
nickel/gold plated. The protruding electrodes of the semiconductor<br>
chip and the semiconductor mounting substrate were connected in the<br>
following manner using the adhesive film of Example 8 described<br>
above. The circuit side of the semiconductor mounting substrate was<br>
temporarily contact bonded at 80°C, 1 :MPa for 3 seconds with an<br>
adhesive film that was laminated with a support film. After then<br>
releasing the support film, the protruding electrodes of the<br>
semiconductor chip were positioned with the semiconductor mounting<br>
substrate and thermocompression bpnding was carried out for 20<br>
seconds at a temperature and pressure of 180°C, 10 kgf/chip.<br>
[0183] This accomplished electrical connection between the<br>
protruding electrodes of the semiconductor chip and the seniiconductor<br>
mounting substrate via the adhesive film. The electrodes _of the<br>
semiconductor chip and the semiconductor mounting substrate were<br>
kept in this connected state by curing of the adhesive film by the<br>
thermocompression bonding. The semiconductor device obtained in<br>
this manner by connecting the semiconductor chip and semiconductor<br>
mounting substrate was subjected to a thermal cycle test, repeating a<br>
cycle of(-55°C, 30 min)/(125°C, 30 min). The thermal cycle test was<br>
repeated for 1000 cycles, and then the connection resistance between<br>
the semiconductor chip protruding electrodes and the substrate circuit<br>
was measured. As a result, virtually no increase in connection<br>
resistance 'Vas observed, demonstrating that satisfactory connection<br>
reliability was exhibited.<br>
[Industrial Applicability]<br>
[0184] The present invention provides an adhesive composition with<br>
an excellent balance of properties, which despite being a radical curing<br>
adhesive, exhibits sufficiently high adhesive strength even for<br>
substrates composed of metals and inorganic materials, has adequately<br>
high storage stability and reliability at room temperature (20-30°C) and<br>
satisfactory transfer properties onto adherends, and can satisfactorily<br>
achieve temporary anchoring of flexible wiring boards and the like.<br>
