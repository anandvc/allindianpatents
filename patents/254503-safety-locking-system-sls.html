1. TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Safety Locking System (SLS)<br>
2. FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention Safety Locking System (SLS) relates to an electromechanical system for switching OFF the electrical power to load with pressing button of an impulse switch or limit switch of the present invention Safety Locking System by a locking arrangement or handle of a lock while locking the door of the office, shop, room, train, factory etc. The Safety Locking System consists of Electrogravitomechanical (EGM) relay, Impulse Switch, Time Delay Switch, Limit Switch, an electronic alarm system etc.<br>
The electromechanical relays or EGM relays are devices that complete or interrupt a circuit by physically moving electrical contacts with each other due to energisation or de -energisation of energising coil of an electromagnet There are moving and fixed contacts in electromechanical relays. The moving contacts and ferrous plate are part of the armature. The armature is pivoted at one end on a metal frame and moving contact is fixed on other ends. When coil of electromagnet energises it develops magnetic field which attracts ferrous plate of the armature resulting into opening of normally closed contact and closing of normally open contact<br>
Switch is a device operated to turn electric current on or off. Types of switches available are Rocker Switches, Micro Switches, Appliance Switches, Rotary Switches, LT control switches, Pushbutton switch, Selector switch for NO/ NC selection, Foot Switches, Single Limit Switches, Precision Single/ Multiple Limit Switches, Inductive Proximity Switches, Precision Single-hole fixing/ Single Limit Switches used for control and positioning work. Precision Single/ Multiple Limit Switches used for positioning &amp; control of machines &amp; industrial installation. Inductive Single Limit Switches are electronic, contact less control devices for positioning, controlling &amp; monitoring movements. Safety Switches are safety devices used for monitoring moveable guards on CNC machine tools. Enabling switches are manually operated control devices for use in hazardous areas of machine &amp; equipment.<br>
Impulse Switch is operated/pressed to get an impulse of electrical current.<br>
One speaker, a LED lamp and a battery are connected to an IC chip. The design of the IC chip is such that when its on/ off terminal is shorted a music/ sound is produced and the lamp glow for a few second.<br>
The Electrogravitomechanical (EGM) relay is a device for keeping the normally close contact in open position and normally open contact in either close position or open position even after de-energisation of the coil of the relay and also the relay is having gravity contacts in addition to a separate resetting circuit The EGM relay is a little bit different from the electromechanical relay.<br>
There are many types of mechanical locks available in the market for locking door, gate, shutter, window etc. They are simple mechanical locks and locked with key. There are door locks fitted in the door itself and the door is locked with key. In the shutter of the shops there are metal strips fitted at the two end of the bottom of the shutter and free to move. After pulling down the shutter, both end metal strips are moved and then locked with two mechanical locks. These are some of the prevalent locking system used in the world. None of these locking arrangements are fitted with a self switching off of the electrical power simultaneously with the locking of closed gate, door, shutter etc. Also none protect them from any fire due to electrical short circuits when the door, gate, shutter etc. are closed.<br><br>
The present invention Safety Locking System is designed to ensure that when ever the door/ gate/ shutter etc. are closed and then locked the electrical power to the load cut off simultaneously while ensuring safety of the man who is closing the gate and also that of the room/ shop/ office/ factory etc. It also conserves energy since in no circumstances the power to load will be on once the gate/ door/ shutter etc. are closed and locked.<br>
3. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention Safety Locking System (SLS) is invented to ensure that the electrical power supply to loads gets cut off along with closing and locking of the door simultaneously. This will not only conserve electrical power but also reduce chances of fires due to electrical short circuit. Precaution is also taken for safety of the men closing and locking the door/ gate/ shutter etc.<br>
In the present invention Safety Locking System (SLS) there are devices connected electrically to each other by cables as per circuit diagram in the figures. The devices in one of the preferred embodiments are Electrogravitomechanical (EGM) Relay, Impulse Switch, Time Delay Switch, ON/ OFF switch, push button switch and IC chip whereas in the other embodiment limit switch, electromechanical relay, ON/ OFF switch.<br>
Electrical power to loads is connected through EGM relay. The normally close contact of the EGM relay or in another embodiment that of the electromechanical relay is connected in series with load and power supply. When the button of the impulse switch pressed by any means or method it will energise die EGM relay for a moment. The NC contact of the relay will open for a moment and the power supply to load gets disconnected. Meanwhile an insulating plate falls in the gap between NC contact pair. Because of the presence of insulating plate, even after de-energisation of the EGM relay, the electrical power is not supplied to the load. Now pressing of time delay switch will energise both coils of the EGM relay and then pressing of push button will de-energise the coil of the energising circuit and then releasing the button of the time delay switch and then that of the push button will reset the Safety Locking System. In this embodiment no power is required to keep the normally close contact in open position after it's opening.<br>
In the second embodiment electromechanical relay is used in place of the EGM relay. In this embodiment low voltage power is always required for keeping the normally close contact in open position.<br>
Time Delay Switch (TDS) is also a new invention used in the present invention Safety Locking System to meet a specific requirement.<br>

6. DETAILS DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A. FIRST EMBODIMENT<br>
Figure - 1 describes the First Embodiment of the present invention Safety Locking System (SLS).<br>
The electrical power supply 6 to load 7 is supplied through normally close contact 3 &amp; 4 of the Electrogravitomechanical (EGM) relay I. Power supply to energising coil (terminals 1 &amp; 2) of the EGM relay is fed by a battery 5 through impulse switch 2. A switch 2a is connected in parallel to impulse switch 2 to bypass the impulse switch 2 when ever required. In normal operation the switch 2 is in OFF condition. Reset coil (terminals 10 &amp; 11) of EGM relay is connected to battery 5 through one terminal of the time delay switch 3. The energising coil of the EGM relay is also connected to the battery via time delay switch 3 and normally close contact of the limit switch 4. Terminals 12 and 14 of EGM relay are shorted and connected to one ON/ OFF terminal of the IC Chip 8. The terminal 13 of EGM relay 1 is connected to other terminal of ON/ OFF switch of the IC chip 8.<br>
The IC chip 8 is such that whenever it's ON/ OFF terminal is made ON the LED lamp 9 starts flickering and the speaker 10 starts sounding. The speaker 10, lamp 9 and a battery are connected to the IC chip 8.<br>
The terminals 12 &amp; 13 and 13 &amp; 14 are normally open contacts of the EGM relay 1. They become close when the power is fed to terminals 1&amp; 2 or 10 &amp; 11, this resulted into closing of normally open contacts 12 &amp; 13 or 13 &amp; 14 of EGM relay 1 respectively.<br>
The impulse switch 2 is a device which completes a circuit for a moment only. The button of the switch 2 can be pressed by pressing the U bar of a lock (Figure-3(D), Figure-8), handle of a door lock (Figure 3(A)), locking bead of a door lock (Figure-3(B)), locking bar of a shutter (Figure-3(C)) etc.<br>
The operation of the present system Safety Locking System (SLS) is as follows:<br>
When the button of the impulse switch 2 is pressed gradually by any means, method or object, see fjgure-3, its normally open contact gets close and further pressing will open its contact. When the impulse switch 2 is closed momentarily, the power supply from the battery 5 is fed to the terminals 1 &amp; 2 of the EGM relay 1 for a moment resulting into opening of normally close contact 3 &amp; 4, closing of normally open contact 13 &amp; 14. When the terminals 3 &amp; 4 open the supply from power source 6 to load 7 gets cut off The closing of normally open contact (terminals 13 &amp; 14) of the EGM relay 1 closes the ON/ OFF terminals of the IC chip 8.<br>
Once the EGM relay 1 is energised no power is required to keep it in energised condition and power to its energising coil terminals fed is OFF by the impulse switch 2 after momentary supply of battery power to the EGM relay 1.<br><br>
The reset circuit consist of EGM relay 1, time delay switch 3 , limit switch 4 and battery. The pressing of button of the time delay switch 3 first fed the power to energising coil terminals 1 &amp; 2 and the further pressing will allow the power from battery 5 source to fed to the reset coil terminals 10 &amp; 11 of the EGM relay. The NC (normally close) contact which is in open condition due to impulse switch 2 will remain in open condition due to pressing of the time delay switch. The further pressing of the button of the time delay switch 3 will energise the reset coil of the resetting circuit of the EGM relay 1. Now the limit switch 4 is pressed while keeping the time delay switch 3 in the pressed condition and then first the button of the time delay switch is released and secondly the limit switch 4. These sequential operation of the time delay switch 3 and limit switch reset the present invention Safety Locking System (SLS) and the NC contact will close allowing flow of power from the source 6 to the load 7.<br>
B. SECOND EMBODIMENT<br>
Figure - 2 describes the Second Embodiment of the present invention Safety Locking System (SLS).<br>
In this embodiment electromechanical relay 13 instead of EGM relay 1 is used for making or breaking power from a source 6 to the load 7. The power to the energising coil of the electromechanical relay 13 is fed from a battery 14 through a limit switch 12. One switch 2a is connected in parallel to the limit switch 12 in order to bypass it as and when required<br>
The NC (normally close) contact of the relay 13 is connected in series with power source 6 and load 7.<br>
The button of the limit switch 12 can be pressed by pressing the U bar of a lock (Figure - 3 (D), Figure - 8), handle of a door lock (Figure - 3(A)), locking head of a door lock ( Figure -3(B)), locking bar of a shutter (Figure - 3(C)) etc.<br>
The relay 13 and battery 14 is connected to the NO (normally open) contact of the limit switch 12. When the button of the limit switch 12 is pressed its NO contact will close and the power from battery to the energising coil through energising terminal (ET) of the relay 13 is fed resulting into opening of the normally close contact of the relay 13. The opening of the NC contact of the relay 13 will cut off power supply 6 to the load 7.<br>
Thus as long as the limit switch 12 is in pressed condition and battery 14 is capable of supplying continuous power to the relay 13 the power supply 6 to the load 7 will be cut off.<br>
In the first embodiment of the present invention the continuous supply to the EGM relay is not required where as in this second embodiment continuous power is required.<br>
Hence First embodiment is a better option because of saving and safety.<br>
7. DETAILS DESCRIPTION OF THE DEVICES IN THE PRESENT INVENTION 'SAFETY LOCKING SYSTEM’<br>
1. TIME DELAY SWITCH (TDS)<br>
A. FIRST EMBODIMENT<br>
Figure-4 is a view of the First Embodiment of the present invention Time delay switch (TDS). Figure- 4a shows a top view of the present invention Time Delay Switch when the top cover 2d is removed and Figure- 4b shows axial cross sectional view of the Time Delay Switch 3. This switch can have two or more normally open contact or normally close contact.<br><br>
The main body Id is made of insulating material and designed to meet the requirement of the present invention. There are four holes 19d in the bottom surface and two holes 10d in the projected end plate for mounting the Time Delay Switch 3. There arc four screwed groove 29d in the main body Id for fixing the top cover 2d by four screws 5d. Fixed contacts 24d, 24ad, 30d and 30ad are fixed in the main body Id. Contact terminals 6d, 6ad, 8d and 8ad of the fixed contacts 24d, 24ad, 30d and 30ad respectively are projected outside the main body Id for external connections. Terminal screws 7d, 7ad, 9d and 9ad are for tightening external connections. There are two holes concentric with the axis of the main body for inserting two small rods 4d and 27d.<br>
Figure - 6,6a and 6b show three dimensional view, axial cross section and side transverse cut section at A - A respectively of the insulating material frame 20d of the present invention. The two moving contacts 22d and 23d are placed inside the rectangular cut in the frame 20d They are free to move inside the rectangular cut in the frame 20d One spring 17d is placed between the two moving contacts 22d and 23d and separated by two insulating separator 3 Id. The spring 17d is hold in position by two insulating separators Bid. The other purpose of the insulating separator 3 Id is to keep two moving contacts 22d and 23d electrically insulated with each other. There are two grooves cut in the frame 20d for inserting two small rods 4d and 27d in the end side.<br>
Figure - 7a shows a view of the small rod 4d and 27d These are made of metal and having smooth surfaces. The rod 4d is placed inside the hole in the main body Id and is free to slide axially. There is one circumferential groove cut in the rod 4d for putting locking washer 28d to prevent coming out of the rod 4d from the main body Id after fitting the frame 20d inside it. The rod 27d is having a head in one end for giving a seating plane for the spring 26d.<br>
Figure - 7b shows view of the moving contact 22d &amp; 23d and insulating separator 3 Id of the present invention. There are three holes in the moving contact strip 22d &amp; 23d for riveting contact tip 25d and one hole 18d at the centre for placing insulating separator 3 Id in it.<br>
The stiffness of two springs 17d and 26d are different and they play a vital role in displacement of the two moving contact 22d and 23d. The spring I7d is more suffer than the spring 26d. When the button 3d of the time delay switch 3 is pressed firstly the moving contact 23d will touch the fixed contact 24d and 24ad Further pressing of the button 3d will make the moving contact 22d to make contact with fixed contact 30d and 30ad There is a time delay between closing of two normally open contact and hence the name Time Delay Switch.<br>
Hence the present invention Time Delay Switch 3 is a device which turns on the electric current in two or more separate circuits after a time delay.<br>
B. SECOND EMBODIMENT<br>
The Second Embodiment of the present invention Time Delay Switch 3 is similar to the First Embodiment with a minor difference in the mechanism of pressing the small bar 4d.<br>
Figure-5 is a view of the Second Embodiment of the present invention Time Delay Switch 3. Figure- 5a shows a top view of the present invention when the top cover 2d is removed and Figure- 5b shows axial cross sectional view of the Time Delay Switch.<br>
The Second Embodiment is exactly similar to the First Embodiment except a lever mechanism instead of a button 3d is used for pressing the rod 4d<br>
Lever mechanism consists of a lever 11d, wheel 16d and frames 13d and 15d. The lever 11d is pivoted at pivot 12d on the frame 13d The wheel 16d is free to rotate on the shaft 14d. The shaft is supported on the frame 15d which is fixed on the lever 11d.<br>
The rod 4d is pushed by moving the lever 11d by pressing the wheel 16d The frame 20d gets pressed as in the First embodiment of the present invention mere by making and breaking the current. The frame 20d is released by releasing the lever 11d.<br><br>
C. FURTHER EMBODIMENT<br>
In the further embodiment of the present invention Time Delay Switch 3 the number of terminals can be more than two.<br>
The mechanism for pressing the rod 4d can be different from that shown in the First and Second Embodiment of me present invention.<br>
2. SAFETY LOCK (SL)<br>
Figure - 3(D) and figure - 8 is a view of the present invention Safety Lock 'S’.<br>
Safety Lock (SL) is a lock with additional device impulse switch 2 or limit switch 12 fitted in it as shown in the figure - 3(D) and figure - 8. The impulse switch 2 or limit switch 12 is fitted inside the lock S under the one head of the U rod 2s. A jack pin 1s is electrically connected with the impulse switch 2 or limit switch 12. The jack pin is fitted in the lock S. The impulse switch 2 or limit switch 12 is connected in the Safety Locking System (SLS) through the jack pin Is.<br>
The button of the impulse switch 2 or limit switch 12 is pressed by pressing the U rod 2s of the safety lock S and when the lock is connected in the Safety Locking System the power supply 6 to the load 7 will cut off.<br>
The Safety Locking System is a very good innovation with the advantage mat even if a person forget to switch off the light or machine or any other electrical appliances while closing the room, shop, office etc the system will automatically switch off the power supply along with the locking resulting into no fire due to any electrical short circuits and also saving in electrical energy bill due to conservation of energy.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
ABSTRACT<br>
The present invention Safety Locking System consists of Electrogravitomechanical (EGM) Relay 1, Impulse Switch 2, Time Delay Switch 3, Limit Switch 4, IC chip 8, Battery 5 &amp; 11, Lamp 9 and Speaker 10 connected through cables as per circuit in the figure - 1.<br>
The power supply 6 to load 7 is through normally close (NC) contact of the EGM III relay 1. The energizing coil of the EGM in relay 1 is energized by pressing button of the impulse switch 2 by U rod 2s of the Safety Lock S, handle of the door lock or any other means or method. The NC contact will open, cutting off the power supply to the load. Further pressing of the button will cut off supply to the energizing coil from battery 5 although the NC will remain in open condition. The Impulse switch 2 can be placed inside lock, near hinges of door, door lock handle, locking bar or below the bottom of the shutter, door end, panel lock handle, etc. The reset circuit will reset the Safety Locking System.<br>
The present invention will not only prevent any fire due to electrical short circuits in closed and locked rooms, shops, offices etc. but also save energy due to switching off of the supply to load.<br><br></td>
