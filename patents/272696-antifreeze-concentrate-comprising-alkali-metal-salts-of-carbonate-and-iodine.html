3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
PROVISIONAL<br><br>
N/A	COMPLETE<br>
The following Specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
4. TECHNICAL FIELD<br><br>
This invention relates to ANTIFREEZE CONCENTRATE COMPRISING ALKALI METAL SALTS OF CARBONATE AND IODINE having a coolant composition that includes anti- corrosion additives for use in engines, both petrol and diesel driven and a method of inhibiting the corrosion of components in the cooling systems as a whole. The ANTIFREEZE CONCENTRATE COMPRISING ALKALI METAL SALTS OF CARBONATE AND IODINE having a coolant composition may be used with treated or untreated water, including hard water. <br><br>
The present invention relates to the manufacture and use of novel ANTIFREEZE CONCENTRATE COMPRISING ALKALI METAL SALTS OF CARBONATE AND IODINE having a coolant composition. Various aspects of the invention are novel, non- obvious, and provide various advantages.<br><br>
5. BACKGROUND<br><br>
Typically coolant compositions are specifically formulated with ethylene glycol or propylene glycol or their derivatives. They also contain specific additives that inhibit corrosion of various metals used in the making of the coolant systems. Specific coolant formulations are desirable with the advent of the high performance engines, particularly aluminum engines and heavy- duty diesel engines. Increasingly more and more components of these engines are manufactured from a wide variety of materials to facilitate reduction in weight of the engine and increase efficiency. The coolant flowing through theses engines come in contact with a variety of materials and need typical additives to impart specific benefits like providing protection for one or many of the materials selected to make the engine and its attendant coolant system. It’s not uncommon for complimentary additives to be used in combination to achieve superior results. Despite the specificity of the coolant compositions in use, the benefits of the additive combination can be thwarted due to the use of the hard water by vehicle users in the cooling system. The hard water can find its way in the cooling system during the initial filling at the engine manufacture’s end or during in service by the vehicle user/ operator/ service station to top off the cooling system.<br><br>
In many parts of the world, there is limited access to water suitable for use in cooling systems. Hard water contains a number of minerals, most notably calcium, magnesium and iron salts. These minerals contribute to loss of cooling efficiency and reduce the life span of the coolant composition. This loss is particularly harsh on heavy duty diesel trucks that on an average cover about 8000- 10000 KMS a month. An ineffective coolant composition can shorten engine life by reduction in the diameter of the heat scavenging passage due to deposition of minerals to cylinder liner pitting and water pump cavitations leading to costly engine overhauls.<br><br>
Thus, in light of the above described problems, there is a continuing need for advancements in the coolant compositions and improved methods for reducing corrosion associated with cooling compositions. The present invention is such advancement and provides a variety of benefits and advantages.<br><br>
6. SUMMARY<br><br>
These problems are overcome by the present invention, as ANTIFREEZE CONCENTRATE COMPRISING ALKALI METAL SALTS OF CARBONATE AND IODINE take steady strides towards perfection.  <br><br>
The present invention relates to the manufacture and use of novel ANTIFREEZE CONCENTRATE COMPRISING ALKALI METAL SALTS OF CARBONATE AND IODINE having a coolant composition. Various aspects of the invention are novel, non- obvious, and provide various advantages. While the actual nature of the invention covered herein can be determined with reference to the claims appended hereto, certain forms and features, which are characteristic of the preferred embodiments disclosed herein, are described briefly as follows:<br><br>
The present invention ANTIFREEZE CONCENTRATE COMPRISING ALKALI METAL SALTS OF CARBONATE AND IODINE provides an engine coolant composition that can be used in a cooling system. The engine coolant composition comprises an organic acid component or salt thereof. The organic acid component can include (C4-C12) organic acids and at least one of 2- Ethyl Hexanoic Acid (herein after referred to as 2- EHA) along with an alkali metal salt of iodine. The engine coolant also contains anticorrosion additive like alkali metal salt of molybdate, at least one of mercaptobenzothiazole-benzotriazole-tolyltriazole troika and either an alkali metal salt of iodine or nitrite or both. A buffer component comprising a sodium salt of at least one borate salt along with or alone, a combination of sodium carbonate salts. Freezing point depressants are also used. In one embodiment the organic acid component of the coolant composition includes 2-EHA along with an alkali salt of iodine and optionally benzoic acid and / or C9-C-12 aliphatic dicarboxylic acids like oxalic acid or succinic acid.<br><br>
In another form the invention ANTIFREEZE CONCENTRATE COMPRISING ALKALI METAL SALTS OF CARBONATE AND IODINE provides an engine coolant composition comprising an organic acid component or salt thereof. The organic acid component can include 2-EHA along with an alkali metal salt of iodine and at least one or none of benzoic acid and a C9-C12 aliphatic dicarboxylic acid or salts of these acids. An anticorrosion additive may include molybdate, at least one of mercaptobenzothiazole-benzotriazole-tolyltriazole troika, one or all or none of nitrate, nitrate and silicate. A buffer component comprising of either a borate salt or a carbonate salt combination or a phosphate salt and hard water may also be incorporated.<br><br>
In still yet another form the present invention ANTIFREEZE CONCENTRATE COMPRISING ALKALI METAL SALTS OF CARBONATE AND IODINE provides a means of reducing the corrosion of metal surfaces in a recirculating cooling system having liquid coolant diluted with hard water. The anticorrosion additives can include an organic acid component or salt thereof, anti-corrosion additives and a buffering agent. The acid component can comprise a mixture of a C4-C12 carboxylic acid and at least one of the 2-EHA along with an alkali salt of iodine or C9-C-12 aliphatic dicarboxylic acid. The anticorrosion additives could comprise of molybdate, and at least one or more compounds from the group consisting of mercaptobenzothiazole, benzotriazole, tolytriazole, nitrite, nitrate, and silicate. <br><br>
The advantages with the present formulation of ANTIFREEZE CONCENTRATE COMPRISING ALKALI METAL SALTS OF CARBONATE AND IODINE are that it uses the corrosion inhibitors in extremely small quantities whereby pollution due to these additives is reduced. After dilution with water the inhibitory levels reduce still further. This would enable recovery of the MEG that forms about 95% of the concentrate. The water can then be disposed off after dilution with fresh water for watering the garden.<br><br>
Secondly, ANTIFREEZE CONCENTRATE COMPRISING ALKALI METAL SALTS OF CARBONATE AND IODINE provides roughly twice the protection as compared to the regular antifreeze coolants and would not need any supplemental coolant additives thereby increasing the number of Kms that it would run. The regular coolant is expected to pass 336 hrs while this has cleared over 600 hrs of Glassware Metal Corrosion Test in the laboratory as defined in IS 5756:2006 or in JIS K 2234 . Regular coolants need replacement every approx 30000 Kms while this is expected to go on for about 50000 Kms.<br><br>
As of now no one has used an alkali metal halide (iodide) as a corrosion inhibitor. This reduces the need for more inhibitory additives as it acts as a supplementary or additional protective aid.<br><br>
Right now there is no such carbonate buffer combination in use that keeps the pH within the stipulated range. These are the immediate advantages that come to mind. As we think further, a few more may be discovered and added.<br><br>
7. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In general, this invention is directed to an engine coolant composition for internal combustion engines, both diesel and petrol driven and used heavy duty truck engines, light duty trucks and automobiles. This invention also proves advantageous in any heat- transfer applications using an aqueous- based or alcohol- based (including glycols and glycol ethers) or an otherwise compatible heat transfer medium. The coolant composition has excellent antifreeze capabilities and freezes or solidifies at a lower temperature. In preferred embodiments, this invention includes an organic acid component of a C4-C12 carboxylic acid along with an alkali metal salt of iodine and at least one or none of other organic acid in combination with other anti-corrosion additives and buffering agents to reduce corrosion of metal components and clogging of internal system passageways. It has been determined that certain preferred embodiment’s exhibit enhanced anticorrosion properties in the presence of hard or soft water. <br>
The term "hard water" when used in this present application is understood as water that includes a variety of minerals or inorganic salts, particularly cationic alkali metal salts, for example, calcium salts, magnesium salts, iron salts. Hard water can typically be evaluated in terms of its hardness level, which is often reported in parts per million (ppm). Hardness can be determined using a variety of commercially available water test kits or by the different test methods specified in BIS or ASTM. Water is considered to be hard at a hardness level of about 170 ppm or greater and very hard at a hardness level of about 300 ppm or greater. <br>
In the preferred formulations, the engine coolant composition of the present invention includes a specifically engineered combination of organic acids, anti-corrosion agents and buffering agents to reduce the corrosion associated with water, both hard and soft. This provides an added benefit of allowing a lower concentration of selected agents to yield effective anti-corrosion protection. The present invention provides an added benefit of reducing precipitation of salts associated with the use of hard water in coolant systems. <br>
The cooling composition can be provided as a liquid concentrate or as a ready-to-use formulation in a pre-diluted form. The ready-to-use formulation can be used directly "as is" in a cooling system. More preferably the liquid concentrate formulation is diluted to 20-50% with water. In other words, the dilution with water can range between 4 parts of water to 1 parts of coolant, to 1 part of water with 1 part of coolant. <br>
The engine coolant composition of the present invention includes an organic acid component along with an alkali metal salt of iodine and other anti-corrosive additives. It should be understood that the organic acids along with an alkali metal salt of iodine impart significant anti-corrosive properties as well as other beneficial properties. The organic acid component consists essentially of a C4-C12 organic acid along with an alkali metal salt of iodine and at least one or none of an aromatic carboxylic acid and a C9-C12 dicarboxylic acid or salts of these acids. The anti-corrosive additives can be a combination of inorganic and organic agents. <br>
Specific examples the C4-C12 aliphatic dicarboxylic acid for use in the present invention include maleic acid, succinic acid, 2-EHA and adipic acid. In a more preferred form, the organic acid component includes 2-EHA. The C4-C12 organic acids are included in the coolant composition in an amount sufficient to inhibit corrosion of metal surfaces in the cooling system. Preferably the coolant composition includes the C4-C12 organic acid in an amount between about 0.01% weight percent (wt %) and about 5 wt % measured as the free acid and based upon the total weight of the coolant composition. More preferably, the coolant composition includes between about 0.01 wt % and about 5.0 wt % of 2-EHA. It has been unexpectedly determined that when the coolant composition includes 2-EHA between 0.01 wt% and about 2.0 wt %, along with an alkali metal salt of iodine, preferably sodium or potassium, between 0.0 wt % to 0.1 wt %, there is a significant enhancement of the corrosion inhibitory properties, particularly when the coolant composition is used in combination with hard water. <br>
The organic acid component can also include an aromatic carboxylic acid. Preferred aromatic carboxylic acid may consist of benzoic acid or a salt thereof. The coolant composition may include the aromatic carboxylic acid in varying amounts or may not contain it at all. <br><br>
The organic acid component can also include C9-C12 organic acids. Preferably the C9-C12 organic acids may include azelaic acid, sebacic acid, undecanedioic acid and dodecanedioic acid or salts of these acids. The coolant composition includes the C9-C12 organic acid in varying amounts. When the coolant composition is provided in a ready-to-use formulation, the coolant includes between about 0.01 volume % and about 1.0 volume % C9-C12 organic acid or salt thereof, measured as the free acid and based upon the total volume of the coolant composition. More preferably, the coolant composition includes between about 0.01 volume % and about 0.5 volume % of a C9-C12 organic acid or salt thereof. In alternative embodiments of this invention, the coolant composition can include between about 0.01 volume % and about 2.0 volume % of the C9-C12 organic acid or salt thereof. In short, the volume % of the organic acid can span 0.01 volume % to 2.0 volume % of the coolant composition.<br>
The salts of these acids are preferably, but not exclusively, ammonium, tetraalkyl ammonium and alkali metal salts and would include, for example, lithium, sodium and potassium cations, though, it is understood that sodium and potassium salts are more preferred. <br><br>
The coolant composition of the present invention also includes additional anti-corrosive additives. The anti-corrosive additives can be either an organic additive or an inorganic additive. Examples of organic anti-corrosive additives include benzotriazole, tolytriazole, mercaptobenzothiazole, sulfonates and imidazolines. Preferably the coolant composition of the present invention includes tolytriazole and/or mercaptobenzothiazole. The organic anti-corrosive additives can be included in varying amounts, preferably between about 0.002 wt % and about 1.0 wt %. More preferably, the coolant composition includes between about 0.002 wt % and about 0.5 wt % of the individual organic anti-corrosive additives.<br>
The coolant composition also includes inorganic anti-corrosive additives. The inorganic additives may include borates, phosphates, silicates, nitrates, nitrites, iodides and molybdates. These inorganic anti-corrosive additives can be employed at concentrations ranging between about 0.002 wt % and about 0.9 wt % for the ready-to-use formulation. The inorganic anti-corrosive additives can be provided as salts, preferably sodium, potassium, ammonium, tetraalkyl ammonium, or alkali metal salts. In preferred forms the coolant composition includes two or more of the inorganic anti-corrosive additives. <br>
In preferred forms, the coolant composition includes alkali salt of molybdate and at least three anti-corrosive additives selected from the group consisting of mercaptobenzothiazole, benzotriazole, tolytriazole, a silicate salt, nitrite salt, and a nitrate salt. The basic coolant composition can be tailored for selective applications to provide enhanced protection for aluminum components of the coolant system, or the steel components, or cast iron components. For example nitrates and silicates are known to provide aluminum protection. Borates and nitrites can be added for ferrous metal protection and benzotriazole and tolytriazole can be added for copper and brass protection. Furthermore, for heavy-duty specifications, the coolant composition can include varying amounts of an alkali metal nitrite to provide enhanced protection against pitting of cylinder liners for heavy-duty diesel engine2. The coolant composition can include between about 0.0 wt % to about 0.9 wt % of each of the desired additives. More preferably, the coolant composition can include between about 0.002 wt % to about 0.9 wt % of the additives; still yet more preferably between about 0.001 wt % to about 0.5 wt % of the additives. <br>
The coolant composition also includes buffering agents. The buffering agents can be selected from any known or commonly used buffering agents. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that selected buffering agents, that buffers can exhibit both anti-corrosion and buffering properties. For example benzoate, borates, carbonates and phosphates can in certain formulations provide both buffering and anticorrosion advantages. Preferred examples of buffers include carbonate salts. In one preferred form, the buffering system includes a mixed carbonate buffer system. It will also be understood by those skilled in the art that certain engine manufacturers, governmental organizations and/or consumers prefer or even require selected buffering systems. While the choice of a selected buffer system is not critical for the exploitation of this invention the buffering agent(s) can be selected to comply with demands of end users. In addition, a base can be included into the coolant composition to help adjust the pH to the desired pH level. Illustrative examples of bases for use with this invention included commonly known and used bases, for example, inorganic bases including NaOH, KOH, and weaker bases such as NaHC03, K2C03 and Na2C03. Therefore, the buffering system and base can be adapted to provide a coolant composition having a pH level between 7.5 and about 11 pH units. More preferably, the buffering system and base is selected to provide a coolant composition with a pH level between about 8.0 and about 11.0 pH units.<br>
The coolant composition of the present invention is blended to provide a uniform composition. The order of addition of the individual components is not critical for the exploitation of this invention. However, it is desirable that the coolant composition be thoroughly blended and that all the components are completely dissolved to provide optimum performance. As discussed above, in one preferred form, the coolant composition is provided as a ready-to-use, i.e. in pre-diluted form. When thus provided the ready-to-use formulation can also include a freezing point depressant. The freezing point depressant can be selected from a variety of known and/or commonly used freezing point depressants. Commonly used examples include alcohols like propanol, monoethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and the like. The ready-to-use coolant composition can also include varying amounts of water. In another form, the coolant composition of the present invention can be provided as a liquid concentrate. Typically, the liquid concentrate includes an alcohol or glycol or glycol-ether and additionally can include, but is not required to include, small amounts of water to dissolve the additives. The liquid concentrate can be diluted with water and added to a cooling system to provide coolant liquid. To provide optimum performance, the liquid concentrate should be thoroughly blended with the water prior to use. It is preferable, but not required to pre-mix the coolant concentrate with water before adding to the coolant system. <br>
The coolant composition that includes 2-EHA along with an alkali metal salt of iodine provides enhanced corrosion inhibitory properties over compositions lacking either one of these components. The cooling composition provides enhanced aluminum and ferrous metal protection against corrosion by the coolant in the cooling system. It also provides good anti-corrosive properties to brass and copper constituents in the cooling passage.<br>
The cooling composition of the present invention provides unexpected results or enhanced protection in soft and hard water. It is not uncommon for cooling systems of diesel engines and petrol engines to include water as part of the coolant medium. Furthermore, during operation, the cooling systems frequently lose fluid either due to leakage or evaporation. Often, operators make-up fluids such as water to the cooling system. The make-up fluid frequently used is water, which is commonly available in all parts of the world. Water in general and hard water in particular can cause many deleterious effects on the components of the cooling systems. These effects include increased corrosion of metal surfaces, particularly iron and aluminum surfaces. Furthermore, hard water in particular can cause incompatibility problems with some of the anti-corrosion components. For example, hard water containing calcium and magnesium salts can cause additives to precipitate or gel. This can decrease engine protection and increase corrosion. In a typical cooling system, the coolant flows through the passageways at approximate flow velocities ranging between 2.5 to 4.0 metres per second. Solder and aluminum are sensitive to high flow rate and corrosive effects are acerbated by the presence of any solid or gelled additives. <br><br>
It has unexpectedly been determined that the addition of 2-EHA along with an alkali metal salt of iodine significantly enhances the protection of aluminum and iron components in contact with hard water. For example, if additives, such as silicates, precipitate from the coolant composition, the desired aluminum protection previously offered by the soluble silicate is drastically reduced. While not to be bound by any theory, it is thought that 2-EHA and its salts along with an alkali metal salt of iodine, provide significant enhanced aluminum metal protection and at least part of this effect may be attributed to reduced precipitation of the additives.<br>
While not to be considered limiting in any fashion, it is also thought that the addition of 2-EHA along with an alkali metal salt of iodine to the cooling composition, provides enhanced protection for metal surfaces by chelating or combining with the alkali metal cations, specifically calcium and magnesium that contribute to the buildup of scale on hot metal surfaces. The scale can drastically reduce and even eliminate flow through passageways in the cooling system. The scale can also inhibit efficient heat transfer from the hot metal surfaces to the coolant. Chelation of these cations can help reduce scale formation on hot surfaces and significantly reduces the detrimental effects of scale buildup. <br>
It has been observed that 2-EHA along with an alkali metal salt of iodine in hard water provides a thin surface coating a few angstroms thick, on many metal components, particularly aluminum and iron components of the cooling system. While not considered to be limiting in any fashion, it is thought that this coating protects the metal surface from corrosion but does not appreciably affect heat transfer. <br><br>
In addition to make-up water, operators may sometimes add supplemental cooling additives (SCA) to their cooling systems. Typically, the SCA’s include a variety of corrosion inhibitory agents as specified above. The present invention provides increased protection for aluminum and iron surfaces, thereby doing away with the need to doze SCA’s that in turn ameliorate the side effects of over-dosing. It has also been determined that molybdate and the organic acids along with alkali metal salt of iodine provide ferrous and cylinder lining protection. <br><br><br><br>

9. ABSTRACT OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to an engine coolant composition for internal combustion engines, both diesel and petrol driven and used heavy duty truck engines, light duty trucks and automobiles. This invention also proves advantageous in any heat transfer applications using an aqueous base or alcohol base (including glycols and glycol ethers) or an otherwise compatible heat transfer media. The coolant composition has excellent antifreeze capabilities and freezes or solidifies at low temperatures well below zero degrees Centigrade. In preferred embodiments, this invention includes an organic acid component of a C4-C12 carboxylic acid along with an alkali metal salt of iodine and at least one or none of other organic acids in combination with other corrosion inhibitory additives. Buffering agents are added to maintain pH as well as reduce corrosion of metal components and clogging of internal system passageways. It has been determined that certain preferred embodiment’s exhibit enhanced anticorrosion properties when diluted with either hard or soft water.	<br><br><br><br><br><br>
