BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND RETATED ART STATEMENT<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a structure of a pedal bracket and, more particularly, to a structure of a pedal bracket for supporting an automotive clutch pedal.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
On an automobile equipped with a manual transmission, a clutch pedal 51 as shown in FIGS. 5 to 7 is mounted to intermittently operate a clutch plate for transmitting an engine output to the transmission. This clutch pedal 51 comprises a pedal depressing portion 52 which the driver depresses when releasing a clutch and a pedal arm portion 53 which has the pedal depressing portion 52 at the lower end and extends upward. By tightening the upper end of the pedal arm portion 53 via a bush 56, a spacer 57, and a return spring 58 by using a bolt 54 and a nut 55, the clutch p%dal 51 is rotatably supported on a pedal bracket 59 substantially having a U shape in cross section such that the opening portion faces downward.<br>
The upper portion and the front portion of the pedal bracket 59 are attached to the cabin side of a dash panel 62 which partitions the vehicle inside space into an engine room 60 and a cabin 61. For this purpose, the upper portion and the front portion of the pedal bracket 59 are formed with bolt holes 62 and 63, respectively, and the dash panel 62 is provided with a support bracket 65 having a welded nut 64, and is<br><br>
projectingly provided with a pair of right and left tightening bolts 66. kci tipper attaching portion 59a of the pedal bracket 59 is fixed to the support bracket'65 by screwing a tightening bolt 67 into the welded nut 64 from the downside via the bolt hole 62, and the front attaching portion 59b is fixed by inserting the tightening bolts 66 in the right and left bolt holes 63 in the forward direction and installing nuts 68 to the tightening bolts 66, by which the pedal bracket 59 is attached to the dash panel 62. The arrow mark X in FIG. 5 indicates the direction of load -<br>
Also, the pedal bracket 59 is provided with a stay 70 to which a bracket-side full closing stopper 69 is fixed and a full opening stopper bracket 71. The stay 70 and the full opening stopper bracket 71 are installed between the right and left walls so that both end portions thereof are fixed to the walls. On the other hand, the pedal arm portion 53 of the clutch pedal 51 is fitted with a pedal-side stopper stay 73 to which a cushion 72 is fixed. Therefore, when the driver depresses the pedal depressing portion 52 of the clutch pedal 51 forward (in the direction of the arrow mark Y in FIG. 5), the upper end of the pedal arm portion 53 comes into contact with the full opening stopper bracket 71, so that the forward movement of the clutch pedal 51 is restricted. When the driver releases the pedal depressing portion 52 of the clutch pedal 51, the pedal arm portion 53 is returned to the rear by a spring force of the return spring 58, and the pedal-side stopper stay 73 fixed to the pedal arm portion 53 comes into contact with the bracket-side full closing stopper 69, so that the rearward movement of the clutch pedal 51 is<br><br>
restricted.<br>
Further, at the lower part on the front side of the pedal bracket<br>
59,	an outer bracket 76 for holding the upper end of an outer cable 75 of a clutch cable 74 consisting of a double cable is installed between the right and left walls. The proximal end of an inner cable 77 of the clutch cable 74 is fixed to the upper end of the clutch pedal 51 by a shaft 79 via a connecting member 78, and the distal end of the outer cable 75 is connected to a clutch mechanism (not shown) within the engine room<br>
60,	Therefore, when the driver depresses the clutch pedal 51, the clutch pedal 51 turns clockwise around the bolt 54 as indicated by the chain line in FIG, 5, so that the inner cable 77 is pulled. Accordingly, the not illustrated clutch mechanism is operated, so that the power on the engine side is not transmitted to the transmission side, and during this time gear change operation is performed.<br>
However, for the above-described conventional pedal bracket 59, the rear face shape on the side of the cabin 61, as viewed from the side, is formed into an inclined face substantially parallel with a straight line connecting the upper attaching portion 59a to the support portion of the clutch pedal 51. Therefore, when an external force acts from the vehicle body front so that the dash panel 62 is pressed to the side of the cabin 61, the rear face portion of the pedal bracket 59 and a not illustrated steering column and other peripheral parts interfere with each other, so that the steering column rises londesirably. Also, since the welded portion of the stay 70 for the bracket-side full closing stopper 69 is located at a position distant from the pedal-side stopper stay 73,<br><br>
as shown In Figs. 5 and 6, there is a possibility of a larger size and an increased weight. Further, the full opening stopper bracket 71 aiid the outer bracket 76 are installed to the pedal bracket 59 separately as an independent part. Therefore, the number of parts and the assembly manpower increase. In addition, when the clutch pedal 51 is depressed, the full opening stopper bracket 71 is subjected to a force for preventing the over-stroke of the pedal bracket 59 (upward force), and the outer bracket 76 is subjected to a force for pulling the clutch cable 74 (upward force), so that it is necessary to give a sufficient strength to these parts.<br>
OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the above situation, and accordingly an object thereof is to provide a structiire of a pedal bracket, in which when an external force acts from the vehicle body front, the-interference of the pedal bracket with a steering colxjimn and other peripheral parts is prevented, the pedal bracket and a bracket-side full closing stopper are made small in size and light in weight, and the number of parts and the assembly manpower can be decreased.<br>
To solve the problems with the above-described related art, the present invention provides a structixre of a pedal bracket whose upper part and front part are attached to the cabin side of a dash panel and which rotatably supports the upper end portion of a pedal arm, characterized in that a notch portion is provided so as to form a space in a region between the lower side of an upper attaching portion of the pedal bracket and the cabin side near a support portion for the pedal<br><br>
arm.<br>
As described above, in the pedal bracket structure in accordance with the present invention, whose upper part and front part are attached to the cabin side of the dash panel and which rotatably supports the upper end portion of the pedal arm, the notch portion is provided so as to form a space in the region between the lower side of the upper attaching portion of the pedal bracket and the cabin side near the support portion for the pedal arm. Therefore, when an-external force acts from the vehicle body front, the interference of the pedal bracket with a steering column and other peripheral parts can be prevented. Also, the pedal bracket can be made small in size and light in weight while maintaining the rigidity of pedal bracket at the pedal full opening time.<br>
Also, when a lower end portion on the cabin side of the pedal bracket is formed substantially into an L shape, and a stay for a bracket-side full closing stopper is installed at the L-shaped lower end portion, the bracket-side full closing stopper can be made small, Further when a cable attaching bracket integrated with a pedal arm full opening stopper is provided on the front side in the pedal bracket, the number of parts and the assembly manpower can be decreased, and the assembly accuracy can be eiihanced and the cost can be decreased, BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings,<br>
FIGS. 1 to 4 show one embodiment of a structxore of a pedal bracket in accordance with the present invention. In the figures, reference-numeral 1 denotes a pedal bracket disposed at the lower front part of a driver's seat of a four-wheeled automobile equipped with a manual transmission. This pedal bracket 1 is installed on the cabin side of a dash panel 4 which is erected in front of a clutch pedal, described later, to partition the vehicle inside space into an engine room 2 and a cabin 3.<br>
A clutch pedal 5, which is used to transmit an engine output to the transmission like the conventional one, comprises a pedal depressing portion 6 which the driver depresses when releasing a clutch and a pedal arm portion 7 which has the pedal depressing portion 6 at the lower end and extends upwad, The upper end portion of the pedal arm portion 7<br><br>
is formed so as to be bent into an L shape. By tightening the bent portion via a bush 8, a spacer (not shown), and a return spring 9 by using a bolt 10 and a nut 11, the clutch pedal 5 is rotatably supported on the pedal bracket 1.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1 to 3, the pedal bracket 1 is formed substantially into a U shape in cross section so as to rise upward slightly obliquely toward the rear of the vehicle body while being attached to the dash panel 4. A rising inclined face 12 located at the front-side upper face portion la is open so that the upper end of the pedal arm portion 7 of the clutch pedal 5 is disposed therein. The upper face portion la of the pedal bracket 1 is provided with an upper attaching portion 13 at a position closer to the cabin 3 side, which upper attaching portion 13 is bolted to a horizontal face 4a of the dash panel 4 projecting to the cabin 3 side. The upper attaching portion* 13 is formed with a bolt hole 15 into which a tightening bolt 14 is inserted. On both sides, right and left, of a front face portion lb of the pedal bracket 1, front attaching portions 16, which are bolted to a vertical face 4b of the dash panel 4, are provided so as to extend outwardly. The front attaching portions 16 each are formed with a bolt hole 18 into which a tightening bolt 17 is inserted.<br>
Right and left side portions Ic of the pedal bracket 1 each are provided with a support portion 19 for the clutch pedal 5, and the support portion 19 is formed with a mounting hole 20 into which the bolt 10 is inserted.<br>
On the other hand, the horizontal face 4a of the dash panel 4 is fitted with a support bracket 21 substantially having a U shape in cross<br><br>
section such that the opening portion faces upward, and a welded nut 22, which is threadedly engaged with the tightening bolt 14, is fixed on the upper face of the support bracket 21. Also, on the vertical face 4b of the dash panel 4, a pair of right and left tightening bolts 17 are projectingly provided at intervals in the vehicle width direction so as to correspond to the bolt holes 18 in the pedal bracket 1, and a nut 23 is threadedly engaged with the tightening bolt 17.<br>
Also, in the pedal bracket 1, a notch portion 24, which is formed by cutting off the pedal bracket 1 in a large way substantially into an inverse L shape, is provided in a region between the lower side of the upper attaching portion 13 and the cabin 3 side near the,support portion 19 for the clutch pedal 5, and a space is formed on the cabin 3 side of the pedal bracket 1 by the notch portion 24. However, the distance from the center position of the mounting hole 20 in the support portion 19 of the pedal bracket 1 to the outside edge of the side portion Ic, that is, the straight dimension M perpendicular to the axis of the pedal arm portion 7 at the time of the full opening of the clutch pedal 5 is equal to that of the conventional structure, and the breaking strength of the pedal bracket 1 at the time of full opening of the clutch pedal 5 is equal to that of the conventional structure. The arrow mark X in FIG. 1 indicates the direction of load.<br>
Moreover, the lower end portion of the right and left side portions Ic located on the cabin 3 side of the pedal bracket 1 is formed substantially into an L shape, as viewed from the side. Therefore, the entire shape of the cabin 3 side of the pedal bracket 1 is formed<br><br>
substantially into a cranlc shape, as viewed from the side.<br>
Also, at the lower end portions of the right and left side portions Ic of the pedal bracket 1, a stay 26 substantially having a U shape in cross section for fixing a bracket-side full closing stopper 25 is installed. Accordingly, the stay 26 is made up of a stay body 26a for tightening a capped bolt 25a of the bracket-side full closing stopper 25 and a mounting member 26b which is formed so as to be bent at both sides, right and left, of the.stay body 26a and is fixed by welding to the inside wall surfaces of the right and left side portions 1c of the pedal bracket 1. The vertical portion of the stay body 26a is formed into an arc shape that is curved downward.<br>
On the other hand, on the upper rear side of the pedal arm portion 7 of the clutch pedal 5, a pedal-side stopper stay 28 to which a cushion 27 is fixed is installed. This pedal-side stopper stay 28 is provided at a position where it engages with the bracket-side full closing stopper 25 when the clutch pedal 5 is moved rearward.<br>
Also, at the lower part on the front face portion lb side in the pedal bracket 1 is installed an attaching bracket 29 integrated with a full opening stopper for the clutch pedal 5 along the width direction. As shown in FIG. 1, this attaching bracket 29 is provided to install and hold the upper end of an outer cable 30 of a clutch cable 32 consisting of a double cable provided with the outer cable 30 and an inner cable 31, and to restrict the forward movement of the clutch pedal 5. The clutch cable 32 has the same construction and function as those of the conventional clutch cable. The proximal end of the inner cable 31 is<br><br>
fixed to the upper end notch of the clutch pedal 5 by a shaft 34 via a connecting member 33, and the distal end of the outer cable 30 is connected to a clutch mechanism (not shown) within the engine room 2.<br>
Specifically, as shown in FIGS, 3 and 4, the attaching bracket 29 is integrally formed substantially into a U shape in cross section such that the opening portion faces downward, and is made up of an attaching member 29a of a flat face shape for holding the upper end of the outer cable 30, a stopper member 29b.provided at the rear end of the attaching member 29a, and fixing members 29c provided on both sides, right and left, of the attaching member 29a and the stopper member 29b.<br>
The attaching member 29a is formed with a cable mounting hole 35. Alsb, the stopper member 29b is arranged so as to rise obliquely upward from the rear end of the attaching member 29a, and the lower face thereof engages with a stopper stay, described later. Further, the fixing members 29c are bent downward substantially at right angles from both sides of the attaching member 29a and the stopper member 29b, and are fixed by welding to the inside wall surfaces of the right and left side portions Ic of the pedal bracket 1.<br>
On the other hand, on the upper front side of the pedal arm portion 7 of the clutch pedal 5, a pedal-side stopper stay 37 to which a cushion 36 is fixed is installed- This pedal-side stopper stay 37 is provided at a position where it engages with the stopper member 29b of the attaching bracket 29 when the clutch pedal 5 is moved forward-<br>
Therefore, when the driver depresses the pedal depressing portion 6 of the clutch pedal 5 forward (in the direction of the arrow mark Y<br><br>
in FIG. 1), the clutch pedal 5 turns clockwise around the bolt 10 attached to the support portion 19 of the pedal bracket 1 as indicated by the chain line in FIG. 1, and the pedal-side stopper stay 37 of the pedal arm portion 7 comes into contact with the stopper member 29b of the attaching bracket 29, so that the forward movement of the clutch pedal 5 is restricted.<br>
Also, when the driver releases the pedal depressing portion 6 of the clutch pedal 5, the pedal arm portion 7 is returned to the rear by the spring force of the return spring 9, and the pedal-side stopper stay 28 fixed to the pedal arm portion 7 comes into contact with the bracket-side full opening stopper 25 of the pedal bracket 1, so that the rearward movement of the clutch pedal 5 is restricted.<br>
In the pedal bracket structure in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention, the notch portion 24, which is formed by cutting off the pedal bracket 1 in a large way substantially into an inverse L shape, is provided in a region between the lower side of the upper attaching portion 13 and the cabin 3 side near the support portion 19 for the clutch pedal 5, and a space is formed on the cabin 3 side of the pedal bracket 1 by the notch portion 24. Therefore, the pedal bracket 1 can be made light in weight. In addition, even when an external force acts from the vehicle body front and the dash panel 4 is pressed to the side of the cabin 3, the interference of the rear side of the pedal bracket 1 with a not illustrated steering column can be prevented, and no trouble annexed to this is caused. Moreover, even if the notch portion 24 is provided, the straight dimension M from the center position of the mounting hole 20 in the support portion 19 of the pedal bracket 1 to the<br><br>
outside edge of the side portion Ic is equal to the conventional one. Therefore, the breaking strength of the pedal bracket 1 at the time of full opening of the clutch pedal 5 is equal to that of the conventional structure. Therefore, the presence of the notch portion 24 is not disadvantageous in terms of strength .<br>
Also, the lower end portion of the right and left side portions Ic located on the cabin 3 side of the pedal bracket 1 is formed substantially into an L shape, as viewed from the side. Therefore, by installing the stay 26 for the bracket-side full closing stopper 25 at this portion, the bracket-side full closing stopper 25 can be arranged closer to the pedal-side stopper stay 28, so that the stay 26 can be made small in size and light in weight as compared with the conventional structTxre (see FIGS. 2 and 6).<br>
Further, at the lower part on the front face portion lb side in the pedal bracket 1 is installed an attaching bracket 29 which is integrated with a full opening stopper for the clutch pedal 5 and has both functions of holding the upper end of the outer cable 30 of the clutch cable 32 and of restricting the forward movement of the clutch pedal 5. Therefore, the number of parts and the assembly manpower decrease as compared with the case where these elements are installed separately as an independent part. Also, the assembly accuracy can be enhanced, and the cost can be decreased. In addition, the stopper member 29b of the attaching bracket 29 is used as a reinforcing member for the attaching member 29a having a function of an outer bracket, and the attaching member 29a is used as a reinforcing member for the stopper member 29b, that is.<br><br>
the portions of one part can be used effectively. Therefore, the machining of a reinforcing structure and the like can be saved as compared with the case where these portions are independent parts.<br>
The above is a description of the embodiment of the present invention. The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, and various changes and modifications can be made on the basis of the technical concept of the present invention.<br><br><br><br>
