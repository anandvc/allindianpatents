Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to pyrazole derivatives endowed with  platelet aggregation-inhibiting activity.<br>
Background Art<br>
Platelets play an important role in stopping hemorrhage caused by damage to blood vessel through coagulatiot' to form thrombi. On the other hand, it has been known that, when vascular endothelium is injured or the blood vessel is narrowed as in the case of arteriosclerosis, platelets aggregate and trigger thrombus or embolus formation, causing ischemic diseases such as myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, ischemic cerebrovascular disorder, and peripheral vascular disease. Therefore, platelet aggregation, inhibitors are administered for prevention and treatment of such ischemic diseases. Aspirin is one such platelet aggregation inhibitor that has been used for a long time, and the effects of aspirin have been demonstrated by APT (Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration) in which clinical test results obtained by administering aspirin to 100,000 patients had been subjected to metaanalysis (BMJ, vol.308, pages 31-106, 1994) . Aspirin, however, is known to cause side effects such as hemorrhage in gastrointestine or like organs, namely, the<br><br>
so-called "aspirin-induced ulcer", and the side effect is not<br>
dose-dependent and occurs at a rate of about 1 per 100<br>
patients (BMJ, vol.321, pages 1183-1187, 2000) .<br>
The inhibitory effect of aspirin on platelet<br>
aggregation is known to be based on the activity to inhibit<br>
the action of cyclooxygenase. Cyclooxygenases include<br>
cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and<br>
aspirin specifically inhibits COX-1 at a low dose, resulting<br>
in inhibition of platelet aggregation. The inhibition of<br>
COX-1 also causes the aspirin-induced ulcer (Neurology,<br>
vol.57, Suppl.2, pages S5-S7, 2001 and Drugs Today, vol.35,<br>
pages 251-265, 1999) . In addition, nonsteroidal<br>
antiinflammatory drugs are known to exhibit antiinflammatory<br>
action by selectively inhibiting COX-2.<br>
As described above, although aspirin is useful as a<br>
platelet aggregation inhibitor, it produces a side effect of<br>
gastrointestinal dysfunction attributable to the COX-1-<br>
inhibiting action, which is an action mechanism of platelet<br>
aggregation inhibition, and there is a strong demand for new<br>
platelet aggregation inhibitors exhibiting no COX-1-<br>
inhibiting activity.<br>
In the meanwhile, as pyrazole derivatives having<br>
antithrombotic activity, there have been known compound (A)<br>
(Japanese Patent No. 2586713 and Chem.Pharm.Bull., vol.45,<br>
pages 987-995, 1997) and compound (B) (BMJ, vol.321, pages<br>
1183-1187, 2000).<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Compound (A), however, exhibits an ICso value of 5.3 x<br>
1CT6 M against collagen-induced platelet aggregation, and<br>
even stronger inhibitory activity is exhibited against COX-2<br>
(IC5o, 2.4 x 10"7 M) . The situation is similar to the case of<br>
compound (B). The platelet aggregation inhibitory activity<br>
of compound (B) is not so potent compared with its inhibitory<br>
activity against COX-2. As described above, inhibition of<br>
COX-2 may lead to an antiinflammatory action, and the<br>
inhibition of COX-2 is not necessarily favorable as a<br>
platelet aggregation inhibitor. In view of the situation as<br>
described above, an object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a strong inhibitor against platelet aggregation which,<br>
however, neither inhibits COX-1 nor COX-2.<br>
The present inventors have made an extensive study in<br>
search of such a platelet aggregation inhibitor, and found<br>
that pyrazole derivatives represented by the following<br>
formulas (I) and (II) exhibit strong platelet aggregation<br>
inhibitory activity without inhibiting COX-1 or COX-2, to<br>
thereby complete the invention.<br>

All the compounds (I) and (II) of the present invention<br>
do not necessarily form salts. However, when the compound<br>
(I) or (II) has a carboxyl group, an amino group, or a like<br>
group, and/or when, Ar2, Ar3, or Ar4 is a pyridine ring or<br>
an analogous ring, the compound can form a salt, and in some<br>
cases, the salt may form a solvate. Examples of the salt<br>
include salts of inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid,<br>
hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid; salts of<br>
organic acids such as methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic<br>
acid, fumaric acid, and trifluoroacetic acid; and salts of<br>
alkali metal ions or alkaline earth metal ions, such as<br>
sodium ion, potassium ion, or calcium ion.<br>
The solvate of the present compound (I) or (II) and the<br>
solvate of a salt of the present compound (I) or (II) include<br>
those formed through addition of a solvent employed in a<br>
crystalization step and those formed through absorption of<br>
moisture in air. Examples of the solvent include lower<br>
alcohols such as methanol and ethanol; other organic solvents<br>
such as acetone and acetonitrile; and water.<br>
The compound (I) of the present invention may be<br>
produced through the following process:<br>
 (wherein Ari, Ar2, and R2 have the same meanings as described<br>
above, and RIO represents a methyl group or an ethyl group).<br>
Specifically, a compound (3) and dialkyl oxalate are<br>
dissolved or suspended in a suitable solvent such as N,Ndimethylformamide,<br>
and sodium hydride is added to the<br>
solution under argon flow at a temperature of -20 to 20°C,<br>
and the mixture is stirred, thereby producing a compound (4).<br>
Alternatively, the compound (4) may be produced by<br>
treating a compound (3) and dialkyl oxalate in the presence<br>
of sodium alkoxide (methoxide or ethoxide) in an alcohol<br>
(methanol or ethanol) solution. The reaction temperature is<br>
preferably -10 to 100°C.<br>
The compound (4) is dissolved in an alcohol (methanol<br>
or ethanol), and a hydrazine derivative (6) or a salt thereof<br>
is added to the solution at room temperature. A suitable<br>
amount of acetic acid is added to the mixture, and the<br>
mixture is refluxed under heat, thereby yielding a compound<br>
(7) and the position isomer (8) as a byproduct. The compound<br>
(7) can be readily separated and purified through silica gel<br>
column chromatography.<br>
In the pyrazole ring formation reaction, instead of<br>
acetic acid, an appropriate amount of triethylamine or<br>
concentrated hydrochloric acid may be added prior to reflux<br>
under heat. In some cases, the compound (7) can be obtained<br>
without addition of any of acetic acid, triethylamine, or<br>
concentrated hydrochloric acid.<br>
The hydrazine derivative (6) or a salt thereof employed<br>
in the above pyrazole ring formation reaction may be produced<br>
by dissolving an aromatic amine (5) in concentrated<br>
hydrochloric acid, adding sodium nitrite to the solution<br>
under ice cooling to form a diazo compound, and treating the<br>
diazo compound with tin(II) chloride. The reaction<br>
temperature is preferably -10 to 20°C.<br>
The hydrazine derivative (6) may be a commercially<br>
available hydrazine derivative product. Alternatively, the<br>
hydrazine derivative (6) may be produced by reacting a<br>
halogenated compound of Ari with hydrazine, as described in<br>
Referential Examples, or through a similar method.<br>
The aromatic amine (5) may be a commercially available<br>
product. Alternatively, the aromatic amine (5) may be<br>
produced through a method described in Referential Examples<br>
or a similar method.<br>
When the thus-produced compound (7) is treated through<br>
the following process:<br>
(Figure Removed) (wherein R2, R3, RIO, Ari, Ar2, and ring structure A have the<br>
same meanings as described above), a compound (I) of the<br>
present invention can be obtained.<br>
Specifically, the compound (7) is hydrolyzed through a<br>
common process to form a carboxylic acid (9), and the<br>
carboxylic acid (9) is fused with an amine compound (10), to<br>
thereby give the compound (I) of the present invention.<br>
The above hydrolysis reaction may be performed in the<br>
presence of a base or a Lewis acid. Examples of the base<br>
include a hydroxide of an alkali metal (such as lithium,<br>
sodium, or potassium). Examples of the Lewis acid include<br>
boron tribromide. The reaction temperature is preferably <br>
to 100°C, more preferably -5 to 50°C.<br>
When the compound (7) has, as a substituent of Ari, a<br>
halogeno group such as chloro or bromo, the substituent of<br>
Ari can be substituted by a methoxy group by dissolving the<br>
compound (7) in methanol, and adding sodium methoxide to the<br>
solution, followed by reflux under heat, or by dissolving the<br>
compound (7) in a solvent mixture of methanol and toluene,<br>
and adding sodium methoxide and a catalyst such as copper(I)<br>
bromide, followed by reflux under heat. Thus, a compound (7)<br>
having, as a substituent of Ari, a methoxy group (RIO is<br>
methyl) can be produced.<br>
The fusion process described above may be performed<br>
through a method generally used for peptide synthesis.<br>
Examples of the method for peptide synthesis include the<br>
azide method, the acid chloride method, the acid anhydride<br>
method, the DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) method, the active<br>
ester method, the carbodiimidazole method, the DCC/HOBT(1-<br>
hydroxybenzotriazole) method, a method using water-soluble<br>
carbodiimide, and a method using diethyl cyanophosphate.<br>
These methods are described in, for example, M. Bodanszky,<br>
Y.S. Klausner, and M.A. Ondetti, "Peptide Synthesis", A<br>
Wiley-interscience publication, New York, 1976; G.R. Pettit,<br>
"Synthetic Peptides", Elsevier Scientific Publication Company,<br>
New York, 1976; and Japanese Society of Chemistry ed.<br>
"Lectures on Experimental Chemistry 4th ed., vol. 22, Organic<br>
Synthesis IV", Maruzen Publishing, 1991. Examples of a<br>
solvent used in the fusion reaction include N,Ndimethylformamide,<br>
pyridine, chloroform, methylene chloride,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, acetonitrile, and a solvent mixture<br>
thereof. The reaction temperature is preferably -20 to 50°C,<br>
more preferably -10 to 30°C. The amine compound (10) may be<br>
a commercially available product or may be produced through a<br>
method described in documents or Referential Example or a<br>
'similar method.<br>
When the amine compound (10) used in the fusion<br>
reaction described above has a functional group such as a<br>
hydroxyl group, an amino group, or a carboxyl group, the<br>
functional group may have to be protected in advance by use<br>
of a suitable protective group. Examples of a typical<br>
protective group for a hydroxyl group include a tert-butyl<br>
group and a benzyl group. Examples of a typical protective<br>
group for an amino group include a trifluoroacetyl group, a<br>
tert-butoxycarbonyl group, and a benzyloxycarbonyl group.<br>
When the functional group is a carboxyl group, the amine<br>
compound (10) may be transformed to a methyl ester or a tert<br>
butyl ester prior to the fusion reaction. Such protective<br>
groups can be removed under suitable conditions, which vary<br>
depending on the type of protective group.<br>
The compound (II) of the present invention may be<br>
produced through the following process:<br>
(Figure Removed) (wherein Ar3, Ar4, R5, R6, ring structure Ar3, and ring<br>
structure B have the same meanings as described above, and<br>
64<br>
RIO represents a methyl group or an ethyl group).<br>
Specifically, a commercially available compound (11)<br>
and dialkyl oxalate are dissolved or suspended in a suitable<br>
solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide, and sodium hydride is<br>
added to the solution under argon flow at a temperature of -<br>
20 to 20°C, followed by stirring, thereby yielding a compound<br>
(12) .<br>
Alternatively, the compound (12) may be produced by<br>
treating a compound (11) and diethyl oxalate with lithium<br>
bis(trimethylsilyl)amide in an inert solvent such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran. The reaction temperature is preferably -78<br>
to 50°C.<br>
Subsequently, the compound (12) is dissolved in ethanol,<br>
and a hydrazine derivative (14) or a salt thereof is added to<br>
the solution at room temperature. A suitable amount of<br>
acetic acid is added to the mixture and then refluxed under<br>
heat, to thereby give a compound (15).<br>
In the pyrazole ring formation reaction, instead of<br>
acetic acid, an appropriate amount of triethylamine may be<br>
added prior to reflux under heat. In some cases, the<br>
compound (15) can be obtained without addition of any of<br>
acetic acid and triethylamine.<br>
The hydrazine derivative (14) or a salt thereof<br>
employed in the above pyrazole ring formation reaction may be<br>
produced by dissolving an aromatic amine (13) in concentrated<br>
hydrochloric acid, adding sodium nitrite to the solution<br>
under ice cooling to form a diazo compound, and treating the<br>
"diazo compound with tin(II) chloride. The reaction<br>
temperature is preferably -10 to 20°C.<br>
Alternatively, the hydrazine derivative (14) may be a<br>
commercially available hydrazine derivative product.<br>
Alternatively, the hydrazine derivative (14) may be produced<br>
by reacting a halogenated compound of Ari with hydrazine, as<br>
described in Referential Examples, or through a similar<br>
method.<br>
The aromatic amine (13) may be a commercially available<br>
product. Alternatively, the aromatic amine (13) may be<br>
produced through a method described in Referential Examples<br>
or a similar method.<br>
When the thus-produced compound (15) is treated through<br>
the following process:<br>
 (wherein R5, R6, R7, RIO, Ar4, ring structure Ar3, and ring<br>
structures B and C have the same meanings as described above),<br>
a compound (II) of the present invention can be obtained.<br>
Specifically, the compound (15) is hydrolyzed through a<br>
process known per se to form a carboxylic acid (16), and the<br>
carboxylic acid (16) is fused with an amine compound (17), to<br>
thereby give the compound (II) of the present invention.<br>
The above hydrolysis reaction and fusion reaction may<br>
be performed under conditions similar to those described in<br>
relation to production of the compound (I).<br>
Alternatively, the compound (I) of the present<br>
invention may be produced through the following process:<br>
(Figure Removed) (wherein R2, R3, RIO, Ari, Ar2, and ring structure A have the<br>
same meanings as described above, and Z represents a<br>
releasing group).<br>
Specifically, an ester (7) is reduced to form an<br>
alcohol (18), and the alcohol (18) is transformed to a<br>
compound (19) having a releasing group Z (such as a ptoluenesulfonyloxy<br>
group, a methanesulfonyloxy group, a<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy group, a chloro group, a bromo<br>
group, or an iodo group) . The compound (19) is reacted with<br>
an amine compound (10), thereby yielding a compound (I) of<br>
the present invention.<br>
The reduction reaction of reducing the ester (7) into<br>
alcohol (18) may be performed by, for example, treating the<br>
ester (7) with aluminum lithium hydride, lithium boron<br>
hydride, or a similar compound in an inert solvent such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran at -78 to 50°C, 'preferably at -20 to 30°C.<br>
The alcohol (18) may be produced by treating a<br>
carboxylic acid (9) in an inert solvent such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran by use of aluminum lithium hydride, a borantetrahydrofuran<br>
complex, or a similar compound, at -78 to<br>
50°C, preferably at -20 to 30°C.<br>
Subsequently, the alcohol compound (18) may be<br>
transformed to the compound (19) as follows. When the group<br>
Z is a methanesulfonyloxy group, the alcohol compound (18) is<br>
reacted with methanesulfonyl chloride in the presence of a<br>
base such as pyridine at -50 to 50°C. When the group Z is a<br>
p-toluenesulfonyloxy group, a trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy<br>
group, or a similar group, the transformation to the compound<br>
(19) may be performed under similar conditions. When the<br>
group Z is a chloro group or a bromo group, the alcohol<br>
compound (18) is transformed to a chloro derivative (19) or a<br>
bromo derivative (19) through use of thionyl chloride,<br>
thionyl bromide, or a similar compound. When the group Z is<br>
an iodo group or a similar group, the thus-obtained chloro or<br>
bromo derivative (19) is treated with sodium iodide, thereby<br>
yielding an iodo derivative (19). Conditions and reagents<br>
employed in these reactions may be determined appropriately<br>
based on a common knowledge of organic chemistry.<br>
The transformation from the compound (19) to the<br>
compound (I) of the present invention may be performed by<br>
reacting the compound (19) with the amine (10) in a suitable<br>
solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or N,N-dimethylformamide by<br>
use of a base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine<br>
or an inorganic base such as potassium carbonate and by use<br>
of a base such as sodium hydride. The reaction temperature,<br>
which differs depending on the type of the group Z, is<br>
preferably -79 to 100°C.<br>
In the above reaction, in some cases, functional groups<br>
are required to be protected. Protection groups and<br>
conditions employed for removal of the protecting groups may<br>
be determined appropriately based on a common knowledge of<br>
organic chemistry.<br>
A compound (I) of the present invention produced<br>
through any of the above three processes can be transformed<br>
to another compound (I) of the present invention through<br>
chemical modifications based on a common knowledge of organic<br>
chemistry.<br>
69<br>
The compounds (I) and (II) of the present invention,<br>
salts or solvates thereof, and solvates of the salts are<br>
endowed with potent anti-platelet aggregation activity, and<br>
they exhibited effectiveness in a high shear stress-induced<br>
thrombosis model. Therefore, the compounds (I) and (II) of<br>
the present invention, salts or solvates thereof, or solvates<br>
of the salts are useful in humans and other mammals as<br>
preventive and/or therapeutic agents for ischemic diseases<br>
caused by thrombus or embolus such as myocardial infarction,<br>
angina pectoris (chronic stable angina, unstable angina,<br>
etc.), ischemic cerebrovascular disorder (transient ischemic<br>
attack (TIA), cerebral infarction, etc.), peripheral vascular<br>
disease, embolism after replacement with an artificial vessel,<br>
thrombotic embolism after coronary artery intervention<br>
(coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous<br>
transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) , stent placement,<br>
etc.), diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy, and embolism<br>
after replacement with an artificial heart valve, and also,<br>
as a preventive and/or therapeutic agent for thrombus and<br>
embolus associated with vascular operation, blood<br>
extracorporeal circulation, and the like.<br>
When the compound (I) or (II) of the present invention,<br>
a salt of the compound, or a solvate of the compound or the<br>
salt is used as a drug, the daily dose for an adult, which<br>
varies depending on the age, sex, symptoms of the patient,<br>
etc., is preferably 0.1 mg to 1 g, more preferably 0.5 mg to<br>
500 mg. The drug may be administered once a day or several<br>
times a day in a divided manner. If necessary, the<br>
compound/salt/solvate may be administered at a dose exceeding<br>
the above daily dose.<br>
No particular limitation is imposed on the<br>
administration route and the dosage form of a drug containing<br>
a compound (I) or (II) of the present invention, a salt of<br>
the compound, or a solvate of the compound or the salt, and<br>
the drug may be administered via any route and in any dosage<br>
form as desired. The dosage form may be determined<br>
appropriately depending on the administration route. The<br>
drug preparation may be produced through a common drug<br>
preparation method by incorporating a pharmacologically<br>
acceptable carrier as desired.<br>
Examples of oral preparations include solid<br>
preparations such as tablets, powders, granules, pills, and<br>
capsules, as well as liquid preparations such as solution,<br>
syrup, elixir, suspension, and emulsion.<br>
An injection may be prepared by filling a container<br>
with a solution of a compound (I), a salt of the compound, or<br>
a solvate of the compound or the salt. A solid prepared by,<br>
for example, freeze-drying such a solution may also be used<br>
as an injection which is rehydrated before use.<br>
In the production of such drug preparation, one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable additives selected, in accordance<br>
with needs, from among a binder, a disintegrant, a<br>
dissolution promoter, a lubricant, a filler, an excipient,<br>
and similar additives may be incorporated into the drug<br>
preparation.<br>

Next will be described processes for producing typical<br>
compounds of the present invention. Also, descriptions will<br>
be given of specific tests conducted to demonstrate strong<br>
platelet aggregation inhibitory action, without inhibiting<br>
COX-1 or COX-2, of the produced compounds.<br>
[Referential Example 1] 5-Hydrazino-2-methoxypyridine<br>
hydrochloride<br>
A solution of sodium nitrite (3.795 g) in water (20 mL)<br>
was added dropwise to 5-amino-2-methoxypyridine (6.21 g) in<br>
concentrated hydrochloric acid (50 mL) over a period of 60<br>
minutes with ice cooling, and the resultant mixture was<br>
stirred at a constant temperature for 30 minutes. Tin(II)<br>
chloride dihydrate (39.5 g) in concentrated hydrochloric acid<br>
(30 mL) was added dropwise to the reaction mixture at an<br>
internal temperature of about 10°C for 30 minutes, followed<br>
by stirring for 2 hours at room temperature. Under cooling<br>
with ice, the reaction mixture was partitioned between sodium<br>
hydroxide (75 g) in water (300 mL) and diethyl ether. The<br>
aqueous layer was extracted with diethyl ether twice.<br>
Subsequently, the aqueous layer was saturated with sodium<br>
chloride, followed by extraction with diethyl ether. The<br>
organic layers were combined, and dried over sodium sulfate<br>
anhydrate, followed by filtration. 1M HC1 in ethanol (50 mL)<br>
was added to the filtrate and the mixture was stirred. The<br>
solid that precipitated was collected by filtration, washed<br>
with diethyl ether, and dried, to thereby give the title<br>
compound (5.02 g, 57%).<br>

[Test Example 1] Platelet aggregation-inhibiting action<br>
Human blood was collected in the presence of 3.13%<br>
sodium citrate as an anticoagulant in a volume 1/10 the blood<br>
volume. The collected blood was centrifuged at 180g for 10<br>
minutes so as to separate the upper layer; i.e., platelet<br>
rich plasma (PRP) from the blood. The remaining lower layer<br>
was further centrifuged at 1600g for 10 minutes, and platelet<br>
poor plasma (PPP); i.e., the thus-obtained upper layer, was<br>
collected. A solution (1 |j.L) of the inventive compound was<br>
added to PRP (200 (j,L) , and the mixture was allowed to stand<br>
at 37°C for 2 minutes. Subsequently, collagen (2 (iL) was<br>
added to the resultant mixture so as to induce platelet<br>
aggregation. Percent platelet aggregation was measured by<br>
means of PAM-12C (SSR Engineering). Optical transmittance of<br>
PPP was employed as the value reflecting the state in which<br>
100% coagulation occurred. Percent platelet aggregation<br>
values of PRP were determined at a series of concentrations<br>
of each Example compound. From the determined values, ICso<br>
with respect to each compound was calculated. Table 1 shows<br>
the results.<br>
[Test Example 2] Inhibitory effects on cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-<br>
M and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)<br>
Inhibitory activity against COX-1 and COX-2 of the<br>
compounds produced in the Examples was measured using a COX<br>
Inhibitor Screening Assay Kit (product of Cayman Chemical<br>
Company, Catalog Nos. 560101 and 560121).<br>
Before starting the measurement, reaction buffer, heme,<br>
arachidonic acid, SnCl2, EIA buffer, washing buffer,<br>
prostaglandin (PG) screening EIA standard, PG screening<br>
acetylcholine esterase (AchE), tracer (chromogenic enzyme HRP<br>
conjugate), and PG screening EIA antiserum were prepared<br>
ready for use.<br>
(1) Production of PGF2a in the presence of COX-1 or COX-2<br>
A reaction mixture containing the compound of the<br>
Examples (50 |jM) and COX-1 or COX-2 was incubated at 37°C for<br>
10 minutes. Arachidonic acid (10 (j,L) was added thereto, and<br>
the resultant mixture was further incubated at 37°C for 2<br>
minutes. IN-Hydrochloric acid (50 |iL) was added to the<br>
reaction mixture, to thereby stop the reaction. SnCl2<br>
solution (100 (iL) was added thereto, and the resultant<br>
mixture was kept at room temperature for 5 minutes.<br>
(2) Quantitative determination of PGF2a through ELISA<br>
Antiserum (rabbit anti-PGF2ct antibody, 50 jiiL) was added<br>
to the wells of 96 well plate that had been coated with mouse<br>
anti-rabbit IgG. A solution of PGF2a-containing mixture<br>
obtained above (2000-fold dilution, 50 fj.L) and AchE tracer<br>
(50 uL) were added to the well in this order, and the mixture<br>
was incubatd at room temperature for 18 hours. The wells<br>
404<br>
washed 5 times with the washing buffer to remove an<br>
excessive AchE tracer, and Ellman reagent (200 |j.L) was added.<br>
After keeping the plate in a dark room for 60 minutes,<br>
absorbance at 405 nm was measured.<br>
(3) Calculation of inhibitory activity of the compound of the<br>
Examples<br>
A calibration curve was obtained by use of the PG<br>
screening EIA standard, and the production amount of PGF2a<br>
was determined from the absorbance. Percent inhibition of<br>
COX-1 or COX-2 activity at 50 pM of the compound of the<br>
Examples was calculated. Table 1 shows the results.<br>
Notably, the amount of produced PGF2a in a reaction<br>
mixture containing no compound was regarded as 100% in<br>
calculation of percent inhibition.<br>
