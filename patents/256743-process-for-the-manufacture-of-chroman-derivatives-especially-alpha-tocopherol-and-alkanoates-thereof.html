				<td>Process for the manufacture of chroman derivatives, especially a-toco-pherol and aUca-<br>
noates thereof<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the manufacture'of chroman derivatives, especially for the manufacture of a-tocopherol (TCP) and alkanoates (TCPA) thereof such as a-tocopheryl acetate (TCP Ac), whereby at least one step of the process is carried out in the presence of a Lewis acid or a mixture of a Lewis acid with a Bronsted -acid as the catalyst under pressure. Preferably the absolute pressure of the reaction is at least 1.1 bar, more preferably it is from about 1.1 bar to about 20.0 bar, even more preferably it is from about 1.1 bar to about 6.0 bar.<br>
As starting materials for the manufacture of TCP and its alkanoates either a mixture of 2,3,5-trimethylhydroquinone (TMHQ) or 2,3,6-trimethylhydroquinone-l-allcanoate<br>
! l
(TMHQA) and a compound selected from the group consisting of phytol (PH), isophytol (IP) and (iso)phytol .derivatives, or the "open ring" compound 2-phyryl-3,5,6-trimethyl-hydroquinone (PTMHQ), a 3-phvryl-2,5,6-1rimet;hylhydroquinone-l-alkanoate (PTMHQA) and/or an isomer thereof are used.<br>
As is known, (all-rac)-a-tocopherol (or as it has mostly been denoted in the prior art, "d,l-K-tocopheroI") is a mixture of four diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers of 2,5,7,S-tetra-me&amp;y]-2-(4',S\12t-trimetliyl-tridec3''l)-6-chrornanol (a-tocopherol), which is the biologically most active and industrially most important member of the vitamin E group.<br>
Many processes for the manufacture of "d,l-o^tocopheror (referred to as such in the literature reviewed hereinafter) and its acetate by the reaction ofTMHQ/2,3,6-trimethyl-hydroquinone-1 -acetate (TMHQAc) with IP or PH in the presence of a catalyst or catalyst system and in a solvent or solvent system are described in the following selected literature.<br>
The manufacture of Oi-tocopherol hy the reaction of TMHQ with PH or phytyl bromide in the presence of anhydrous ZnCl2 is e.g. described in US 2,411,967. According to DE 196 54 038 Al TMHQ is reacted with PH or ff to Oi-tocopherol and its acetate in the presence of ZnCIa and a proton donor, whereby-in the process of US 3,708,505 a combined acid condensation agent comprising a Lewis acid such as ZnQa -and at least one strong acid such as p-toluene sulfonic acid and sodium bisulfate is used as the catalyst.<br>
In EP-A 0 100 471 the reaction of TMHQ with ff or PH in the presence of a Lewis acid, e.g. ZnCli, BF3 or Aids, a strong acid, e.g. HC1, and an amine salt as the catalyst system is described. In the processes of DE-OS 26 06 830 and US 4,191,692 the ff or PH is pre-. treated with ammonia or an amine before the reaction with TMHQ in the presence of and an acid is effected.<br>
In the processes of DE-OS 21 60 103 as well as US 3,789,086 compounds of the following formula<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
wherein X is hydrogen, alkanoyl or aroyl, and R1, R2 and R3 are individually hydrogen or methyl, are reacted with compounds of the following formulae<br>
(Figure Remove)wherein Y is ~CH2-CH(CH3)- or -CH=C(CH3)- and A is halogen, hydroxy, etherified hydroxy or esterified hydroxy in the presence of HC1 and Fe 'and/or FeC^ as the catalyst to obtain e.g. otocopherol.<br>
According to EP-A 0 694 541 TMHQ:and IP, PH or a PH derivative are reacted in the presence of a mineral acid, a Lewis acid, an acidic ion exchange resin or a triflate, nitrate or sulfate of Sc, Y or a lanthanide element as the catalyst. The use of Sc(m) triflate as catalyst for the condensation of TMHQ with IP is also described in Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1995,68,3569-3571.<br>
TCP can be converted into its acetate, succinate and further known application forms by standard methods, e. g. as described in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Vol. A27,5th edition, pages 484 to 485, VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, D-69451 Weinheim, 1996. In contrast to TCP which is labile against oxidative conditions, the esters (TCP A) are more stable and more convenient to handle.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process for the manufacture of-chroman derivatives such as tocols and tocopherols and of their alkanoates, especially of a-toco-pherol and its alkanoates, with high selectivities and yields.<br>

can also be manufactured by reacting a compound of the formula X with R1 being hydrogen and n having the same meaning as above with an appropriate acylating agent in the presence of a Lewis acid as the catalyst at reduced pressure, preferably at an absolute pressure of below 0.9 bar, or under pressure, preferably at an absolute pressure of at least 1.1 bar. To this process, which is also an object of the present invention, it will be referred to as PROCESS SB in the following.<br>
While in a preferred embodiment of PROCESS 5 A of the present invention chroman alka-noates of the formula VEIa such as (all-rflc)-TCPA (formula Vm with n = 3; see above), especially (all-rac)-TCPAc (formula V3H with n = 3 and R = acetyl) is produced, the invention is not limited to the production of that particular isomeric form and other isomeric 'forms cam Be obtained 'By e'.'g'. us'rhg'TCP (formula VDft^urn=3)'aS'tue starting material in the appropriate isomeric form. Thus, e.g. (R,R,R)-1CP A/TCP Ac will be obtained when using (R,R,R)-1CP as starting material, since no epimerization occurs at reaction temperatures below 120°C. The same applies for the other compounds of the formula \TIc used as starting materials such as e.g. tocols and tocopherols, if n = 3.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the (all-7-ac)-a-tocopherol (formula VHb with n = 3) obtained by PROCESS 2 or 3 is acetylated after removal of the solvent without further purification with acetic anhydride and with total conversion, if PROCESS 2 or 3 is carried out in the presence of a Lewis acid as the catalyst. No additional catalyst needs to be used as the catalyst (Lewis acid) is still present from the reaction before. Furthermore, it is a special advantage that the reaction mixture of the manufacture of e.g. (all-rac)-a-tocopherol can<br>
vantage that the reaction mixture of the manufacture of e.g. (all-rflc)-a-tocopherol can be acetylated at the reaction temperature the mixture already has. When indium(Er) salts are used as the catalysts, the acetylation even proceeds at room temperature in a short reaction time (up to 10 minutes). After acetylation (all-7-Qc)-a-tocopheryl acetate was isolated in excellent yield [&gt;99.5% based on (all-7'ac)-a-tocopherol].<br>
Lewis acids and mixtures of Lewis acids with Bronsted acids<br>
Concerning the Lewis acids and/or mixtures of Lewis acids with Bronsted acids used as<br>
the catalyst underpressure in all PROCESSES 1 to 5B:<br>
In principle all Lewis acids and mixtures of Lewis acids with Bronsted acids known to the person skilled in the art as catalysts for the &gt; condensation reaction of TMHQ or TMHQA with IP, PH or derivatives thereof can be used. Suitable catalysts are e.g. bortrifluoride (BF3), a mixture of boric acid (especially orthoboric acid) and oxalic acid, triflateE and het-erowolfram acids. Preferred are Lewis acids, where the radius of the metal cation varies from about 73 pm to about 90 pm, preferably from about 73 pm to about 82 pm, such as the radius of Fe2+ (0.74 A), Zn2+ (0.74 A), In3+ (0.81 A) and Sc3+ (0.73 A).<br>
Especially suitable Lewis acids are indium(DI) salts such as indium(ni) halides, indiumQII) trifluoromethanesulfonate (= triflate) pn(SO3CF3)3; In(OTf)3] and indium(IH) e,J7is(trifLu,oromethanesulfcmarnide)-[In((NSO2GE3-)3)3; In(NTf2)3]^ scandiurn(Iir) salts such as those described on page 5, line 14 to 21 in combination with page 6, line 23 to page 7, line 33 ofEP 0 658552 Al, e.g. scandium(ni) fluorosulfonate [Sc(SO3F)3], scandiumQH) triflate [Sc(OTf)3] and scandium(in) fluorobenzenesulfonate [Sc(SO3C6H4F)3]; scan-dium(EI) bis(trifluoromethanesulfonamide) [Sc(NTf2)3], scandium(in) nitrate [Sc(NO3)3], scandium(ni) sulfate [Sc2(S04)3] and zinc(IT) bis(trifluoromethanesulfonamide) [Zn(NTf2)2].<br>
More preferred are lnCi3. In(OTf}3 and Sc(OTf)3, whereby InCl3 is the most preferred one. The indium and scandium salts InCl3. In(OTf)3 and Sc(QTf)3 are known compounds which are commercially available, InCh e.g. iron: Fluka (No. 57 100), In(OTf)3 and So(OTf}3 e.g. from Aldrich (No, 442 151 and 418 218). They can be used ir. solid form, anhydrous or hydratsd (of which lnCl3-4 H^O is an example), as well as in solution or in suspension. For<br>
ROCESS 1 and 2 the catalyst is preferably dissolved or suspended in water. The concentration of such an aqueous solution is not critical; Furthermore, all the Lewis acids cited above tolerate acetic anhydride and other acylating agents as well as protic solvents such as acetic acid, methanol, ethanol and water. After the termination of the reaction the Lewis acids used as the catalysts can be recycled.<br>
Especially suitable mixtures of Lewis acids with Bronsted acids are the following systems: zinc(II) compounds/hydrochloric acid, zincQI) compounds (preferably ZnCl2)/gaseous HCI and Fe(H) chloride/gaseous HCI. The'Fe(II) chloride can be prepared in situ by the reaction of Fe with HC1, which therefore presents an equivalent system to the system Fe(II) chloride/gaseous HCI. Suitable zinc(II) compounds are zinc(IT) salts such as ZnCk, ZnBr^ as well as all zinc(II) compounds which form ZnCl? under the reaction conditions, e.g. ZnO. If the system ZnCk/hydrochloric acid or ZnClj/gaseous HCI is used, it is preferred to carry out the reaction in the presence of an arnine such as disclosed in the last paragraph onpage 4 and the first paragraph on page 5 of EP 0 100 471 Al, which is hereby incorporated by reference, or in the presence of an ammonium salt Alternatively the reaction is preferably carried out by using the compound of the formula HI or TV such as IP or PH having been pretreated with an arnine or NEb as described in DE-OS 26 06 830.<br>
^Manufacture of the starting materials<br>
The starting material TMHQAc may be obtained e.g. by selective hydrolysis of 2,3,5-trimethylhydroquinone diacetate as described in EP-A1 239 045. 2,3,5-Trimethylhydro-quinone diacetate can be prepared e.g. by the acid catalyzed rearrangement of ketoiso-phorone in the presence of acetic anhydride or another acetylation agent as described in EP-A 0 850 910, EP-A 0 916 642, EP-A 0 952 137 or EP-A 1 028 103.<br>
The (iso)phytyl compounds can be produced by conventional processes known to the person skilled in the art. Phytol and its derivatives represented by the formula IV with n = 3 can be used as E/Z-mixture as well as in pure E- or pure Z-form. Preferred is the use of phytol and its derivatives represented by the formula IV as E/Z-rnixtures. The most preferred starting material selected from the (isc)phytyi compounds is IP.<br>
Of course any other appropriate isomeric form of the (iso)phytol derivatives can also be used, (j^-phytol, (R,RJl)-isophytol, (SA^-isophytol or (AS^^-isophytol or an appropriate (iso)phytol derivative e.g. can be used to obtain (J?,£)-PTMHQ/(£,£)-PTMHQA or<br>
, if TMHQ/TMHQA is used as the other component.<br>
The other (di)(metliyl)hydroquinones and compounds of the formula TTT and IV with n being 0, 1 or 2 can be prepared by processes known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
PROCESS 1, STEP a of PROCESS 2. STEP a of PROCESS 2a<br>
As will be readily apparent, the use of the compound of the formula II with R1 = H (= TMHQ; = formula Ila with X1, X2 and X3 = methyl and R3 = hydrogen) as a reactant in this process of the present invention will result in the production of a compound of the formula I with R1 = H such as PTMHQ (n = 3) while, when using a compound of the foimula II with R1 = acetyl, propionyl, pivaloyl, HOsC—CBb—CHj—CO, nicotinoyl or benzoyl (= TMHQA), especially TMHQAc, the respective compound of the formula I with R1 = acetyl, propionyl, pivaloyl., HOjC-CHj-CHs-CO, nicotinoyl or benzoyl such as PTMHQA/PTMHQAc (n = 3) will be obtained.<br>
If TMHQ/TMHQA is reacted with a compound of the formula El and/or IV with n being 3 in both formulas, minor amounts of the isomers of PTMHQ/PTMHQA, (Z)- or(£)-2-.(3,7,1 l?l_5-tetramethyl-hexadec-3-enyl)-3,5,6-1iimethylhydroquinone (formula Va with R1 = hydrogen; see above)/(Z)- or(£)-3-(3,7,ll,15-tetramethyl-hexadec-3-enyI)-2,5,6-tri-methylhydroquinone-l-alkanoate (formulaVa with R1 = acetyl, propionyl, pivaloyl, HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO, nicotinoyl or benzoyl; see above) and/or 2-[3-(4, 8,12-trimethyl-tridecyl)-but-3-enyl]-3,5,6-trimethylhydroquinone (formula Via with R1 = hydrogen; see above)/3-[3-(4, 8,12-trimethyl-tridecyl)-but-3-enyl]-255,6-trimethylhydroquinone-l-alkanoate (formula Via with R' = acetyl, propionyl, pivaloyl, HOiC—CE^-CHa-CO, nicotinoyl or benzoyl; see above) may be formed as by-products in PROCESS 1 as well as in STEP a of PROCESS 2 ar,ci 2A. If other compounds of the formula ffl and/or IV are used where n = 0. 1 or 2, also minor amounts of compounds of the formula V and VI may be formed as byproducts.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
PTMHQ/PTMHQA and their isomers represented by the formulae Va and "Via (see above; are intermediates for the production of a-tocopherol or its alkanoates (final products).<br>
Depending on the activity of the catalyst and the reaction conditions, the reaction proceeds to the final product (steps a and b of PROCESS 2) or is slowly enough so that these intermediates can be isolated (only step a of PROCESS 2 is performed). The same applies for the steps a and b of PROCESS 2a.<br>
In.a preferred embodiment of PROCESS 1 and PROCESS" 2 TMHQ is reacted with PH and/or IP, more preferably with IP.<br>
Conveniently the reaction is carried out under an inert gas atmosphere, preferably gaseous nitrogen or argon.<br>
The reaction is preferably carried out at an absolute pressure of at least 1.1 bar, more preferably at an absolute pressure of from about 1.1 to about 20.0 bar, even more preferably at an absolute pressure of from about 1.1 bar to about 6.0 bar, even more, more preferably at an absolute pressure of from about 1.7 to about 5.1 bar, most preferably at an absolute pressure of from about 2,0 to about 3.6 bar.<br>
The reaction temperature depends on the applied pressure and solvent because the reaction is carried out under reflux. Therefore, the reaction temperature is conveniently iron: about90°C to about 170'C, preferably from about 900C'to about 160°C, more preferably from about 112°C to about 160°C and most preferably from about 125 to about 150°C.<br>
Suitable organic solvents are aprotic non-polar organic solvents such as aliphatic hydrocarbons, halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons; halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferred examples of aliphatic hydrocarbons are Linear, branched or cyclic Cs- to C\s-alkanes. Particularly preferred are linear, branched or cyclic Ce- to Cjo-alkanes, especially preferred are hexane, heptane, octane and cyclohexane or mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferred examples of halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons are mono- or polyhalogenated linear, branched or cyclic Cr to Ci5-alkanes. Especially preferred examples are mono- or polychlorinated or -brominated linear, branched or cyclic Cr to Cjs-alkanes.

The most preferred non-polar solvents differ from catalyst to catalyst: If InCl3 is used as the catalyst, toluene and heptane are the preferred solvents; especially preferred is heptane. If Sc(OTfb is used as the catalyst, the most preferred solvent is toluene. If the catalyst system Fe (FeCl2)/HCl(g) ("(g)" = gaseous) is used, the most preferred solvent is also toluene.<br>
If the system ZnCk/hydrochioric acid or ZnCl2-/HCl(E) ("g" = gaseous) is used, it is more preferred to carry out process 1 or step a) of process 2/2a in the presence of an arnine such<br>
as disclosed in the last paragraph on page 4 and the first paragraph on page 5 of EP 0 100 471 Al, which is hereby incorporated by reference. The process can also be carried out by pretreating the compound of the formula DI or TV such as -IP or PH with an anoine or NH3 as described in DE-OS 26 06 830. If an arnine is present in an amount of about 0.05 to about 5;0 weight%, preferably of about 0.1 to about 2.0 weight% - based on the weight of the compound HI or TV, whichever is employed, the most preferred solvent for carrying out the reaction with the Zn(Tf) catalyst system is hexane. If no amine is present, the most preferred solvent for carrying out the reaction with the Zn(IT) catalyst system is heptane. The molar ratio of the compound of the formula H or Ila (most preferred: TMHQ or    • TMHQA(c)) to a compound of the formula m or IV, whichever is employed, in the reaction mixture conveniently varies from about 0.95 : 1 to about 1 : 1.1, preferably from about 1 :1.01 to about 1 : 1.05.<br>
The amount of the aprotic non-polar organic solvent used is conveniently from about 0.1 ml to about 6.0 ml, preferably from about 0.15 ml to about 3.0 ml, based on 1 mmol of the compound of the formula Tfl or IV, whichever is employed.<br>
The relative amount of catalyst, based on compound HI or IV, whichever is employed, is dependent on the catalyst system used and the reactants. Conveniently the relative amount of-the catalyst based on compound HI or IV, whichever is employed, Is" at least O'.Ol mol%. Generally the relative amount of catalyst varies from about 0.01 to about 30 mol%. The optimal relative amount of the catalyst is different from catalyst to catalyst and also depends on the reactants:<br>
If InClj is used as the catalyst, it may be preferably present e.g. in a relative amount of from about 0.1 mol% to about 2.5 mol%, especially preferable in a relative amount of from about 0.1 mol% to about 2.0 mol%, more preferably in a relative amount of from about 0.1 to about 1.0 mol%, even more preferably in a relative amount of from about 0.1 to about 0.5 mol%, based on compound El or IV, whichever is employed.<br>
If Sc(OTf)3 is used as the catalyst, it may be preferably present in a relative amount of from about 0.05 mol% to about 2.0 mol%, preferably in a relative amount of from about 0.075 to about 1.5 mol%, more preferably in £ relative amount of from about 0.1 to about 1.0 mol%. based or, compound in or IV, whichever is employed.<br>
If Fe and/or FeCl; rn combination with HC1 is used as the catalyst, it may be present in an amount as described e.g. in DE - OS 21 60 103 (page 5, end of second paragraph and -claim 9) and in US 3,789,086 (column 3, lines 27 - 60).<br>
If Zn(II) and/or ZnCla is used as the catalyst^ it may be present in an amount as described e.g. in the examples 1 to 12 of US 2,411,967, in US 3,708,505 (page 1, right column, lines 26 - 44), in DE - OS 19654 038 (page 2, lines 55-63; page 3, lines 4- 6; page 3, line 60 to page 4, line 19; page 4, line 29 - 38), in EP-A 0 100 471 (page 7, lines 19 - 24), in DE -OS 26 06 830 (page 4, last two lines to page 5, first two paragraphs), in US 4,191, 692 (second column, lines 49 — 62).<br>
In this context the expression "amount of catalyst" is to be understood as referring to the weight of pure Lewis acid or pure Bronsted acid present, even though the catalyst may be impure, in the form of an adduct with a solvent and/or a solution/suspension. Ife'relative amount of the Bronsted acid depends also on the Lewis acid used and can be chosen accordingly.<br>
The reaction can be carried out batchwise or continuously, and in general operationally in a very simple manner, for example (i) by adding the compound of the formula HI or FV — as such or dissolved in the solvent, preferably as such - portionwise or continuously to a mixture of the Lewis acid, the compound of the formula Ha/H (preferred: TMHQ or TMHQA; most preferred: TMHQ or TMHQ Ac) and me solvent If_a catalyst^system cpnsisjjng,of a. . Lewis acid and a Bronsted acid is employed, the Bronsted acid is added continuously or batchwise, preferably continuously, to the mixture of the Lewis acid, the compound of the formula Ea/H (most preferred: TMHQ or TMHQA(c)) and the solvent.<br>
It is also possible (ii) to add subsequently the Lewis acid, preferably as such or as aqueous solution, and the compound of the formula HI and/or IV - as such or dissolved in the non-polar solvent, preferably as such - to the compound of the formula Ha/El (most preferred: TMHQ or TMHQA(c)) and the solvent. The Bronsted acid is then continuously or batch-wise, preferably continuous!}', added to this mixture.<br>
Convenient1.}', the compound of the formula IL or 7&gt;: i? added continuously to the corn-pound of the the formula na/II (most preferred: TMHQ or TMHQA(c)) within about 15 to<br>
about 1-80 minutes, preferably within about 30 to about 150 minutes, more preferably within about 45 to about 130 minutes. The Lewis acid is preferably added at once, i.e. in its full amount, to the mixture of the compound of the formula Ita/II (most preferred: TMHQ or TMHQA(c)) and the solvent.<br>
After completion of the addition of the compound of the formula HI or IV (in the non-polar solvent) the reaction mixture is suitably heated further at the reaction temperature for about 10 minutes to about 360 minutes, preferably for about 30 minutes to about 240 minutes. The working-up can be effected by procedures conventionally used in organic chemistry.<br>
STEP b OF PROCESS 2. STEP b of PROCESS 2a<br>
As will be readily apparent, the use of a compound of the formula n or Ha with Rl and R3, respectively, being hydrogen such as PTMHQ or an isomer thereof as a reactant in the process of this invention will result in the preparation of atocol or a tocopherol such as cc-tocopherol while, when using a compound of the formula H with R.1 being acetyl, propio-nyl, pivaloyl, H02C-CH2-CH2-CO, nicotinoyl or benzoyl and n being 3 the respective to-cyl alkanoate or tocopheryl alkanoate such as ct-tocopheryl alkanoate will be obtained.<br>
For the manufacture of a-tocopherol or a-tocopheryl alkanoate PTMHQ or PTMHQ A and optionallyone: ormoreisomersthereof, which are obtained asjninor.by-products. in -the-manufacture of PTMHQ or PTMHQA, prepared to any method known to the person skilled in the art can be used as starting material.<br>
This ring closure can be carried out using the same catalysts under substantially the same reaction conditions as described above for the reaction of compounds of the formula n (e.g. TMHQ: formula II with R1 = hydrogen; or TMHQA: formula n with R1 = acetyl, propionyl, pivaloyl, HOjC-C^-CHz-CO, nicotinoyl or benzoyl) or Ha with a compound of the formula ffi and/or a compound of the formula IV. Therefore, in cases, where e.g. PTMHQ or PTMHQA and optionally one or more isomers thereof are produced according to STEP a, i: is sufficient to simply prolong the reaction time of STEP a to realize STEP b, i.e. to prolong the reaction time for about 30 minutes to about 240 minutes, to increase the amount of catalyst and/or to increase the reaction temperature.<br><br>
PROCESSES 3 and 3a<br>
This reaction can be .carried out using the same catalysts under substantially the same reaction conditions as described above for step a) of PROCESS 2 and 2a. Depending on the land of catalyst, the amount of catalyst and the reaction temperature the reaction stops at the intermediates of the formula la/I or proceeds to the end products of the formula<br>
vn/vna.<br>
PROCESS 4<br>
This reaction can be carried out using the same catalysts under substantially the same reaction conditions as described above for step a) of PROCESS 2 and 2a. The reaction proceeds to the final product of the formula X independent from the nature of the catalyst, the amount of catalyst and the reaction temperature.<br>
PROCESS 5A<br>
According to still another aspect of this invention, a compound of the formula VHc such as e.g. a-tocopherol or y-tocopherol, or any other tocol as described in DE-OS 21 60 103 on page 5 in the third and forth paragraph may be converted into its alkanoate (a compound of the formula VUIa), e.g. its acetate, by treatment with an acylating agent in the presence of a Lewis acid as the catalyst at reduced pressure, preferably at an absolute pressure of below 0.9 bar, or under pressure, jjreferably at an absolute jpressure.of, atjeajSt. .1^1.bar.,.<br>
More preferably the absolute reaction pressure varies from about 0.02 bar to about 0.9 bar (even more preferably from about 0.1 bar to about 0.9 bar, most preferably from about 0.2 bar to about 0.9 bar) and from about 1.1 bar to about 10.0 bar (even more preferably from about 1.1 bar to about 6.0 bar, even more, more preferably from about 1.1 bar to about 5.0 bar, most preferably from about 1.1 bar to about 3.0 bar).<br>
Therefore, the invention is also directed to a process for the manufacture of tocyl allca-noates in the presence of a Lewis acid as the catalyst a* reduced pressure, preferably at an absolute pressure of below 0.9 bar. or under pressure, preferably a: an absolute pressure of at least 1.3 bar,<br><br>
The acylation in accordance with that aspect of the invention can be carried out using acy-lating agents conventionally used in the acylation of tocopherols such as anhydrides or hal-ides.<br>
Examples of these are anhydrides or halides of alkanoic acids such as acetic acid, propi-onic acid, pivalic acid, succinic acid, nicotinic acid and benzoic acid. Preferably, acetic anhydride or acid chloride, especially acetic anhydride, are/is used.<br>
The molar ratio of the compound of the formula VTIc to the acylating agent in the reaction mixture conveniently varies from about 1 :1 to about 1:5, preferably from about 1 : 1 to about 1:3, more preferably from about 1:1.1 to about 1 : 2.<br>
Suitable Lewis acids are the ones named above.<br>
The amount of the Lewis acid used as the catalyst is based on the lesser molar amount of reactant, i.e. the compound of the formula VIIc or the acylating agent, and can be in the range of from about 0.006 mol% to about 2.0 mol%, preferably from about 0.0075 mol% to about 1.5 mol%, more preferably from about 0.01 mol% to about 1.0 mol%, hi the batchwise mode of operation. For continuous operation, the amount of catalyst will be adjusted to the size of the reactor and the flow of the reactants. It will be appreciated that the determination of the appropriate figures based on the figures for.batchwise operation is *witbin.no;rmal^kill^As in .the.ojther.processes of the invention the Lewis acid is added at once, i.e. in its full amount. Preferably the catalyst is added as an aqueous, solution or suspension.<br>
The temperature of the acylation is dependent on the catalyst system used and the temperature the reactants (resulting from former process steps) already have. The acylation reaction can be generally carried out at temperatures from about 20 to about 200°C, preferably from about 60 to about 1 SO°C, more preferably from about 80 to about 160°C. When in-dium(IH) salts are used as the catalysts, the acylation reaction is preferably carried out at temperatures below 120°C. more preferably from about 15 to about 1200C, most preferably at room temperature, i.e. from about 15 to about 40°C.<br><br>
The reaction can be carried out essentially in the absence of an additiona] organic solvent, which is preferred.<br>
"Essentially in the absence of an additional-organic solvent" in the context of the present invention means that essentially-no organic solvent is present during the reaction and that no organic solvent is deliberately added. It might, however, be possible that traces of organic solvent are present in the starting materials or the catalyst as impurities. In other words, the reaction is carried out in substance; i.e. no other compound except the compound of the formula VTIc, the acylating agent and the catalyst is intendedly used for the reaction, so that at the beginning of the reaction the amount of any substance except for the starting material, the compound of the formula VHc and the acylating agent, and except for the catalyst in the reaction mixture is 
Alternatively it is also possible to carry out the reaction in the presence of an additional organic solvent, e.g. pyridine.<br>
The reaction is conveniently carried out under an inert gas atmosphere, preferably gaseous nitrogen or argon.<br>
It is a particular feature of the acylation according to the present invention that when using chiral tocols and tocopherols, e.g. (enantiomeric pure) (R,R,R)-a-tocopheroL, the acylation proceeds substantially without epimerization in tire- presence tjfindijam(i]l) S2rts"as the catalysts and at a temperature below 120°C, e.g. from about 20°C to about 120°C. Thus, if e.g. CR,.R,J?)-a-tocopherol is used as starting material for PROCESS 5A, (R,R,R)-a-tocopheryl alkanoate is obtained.<br>
In especially preferred embodiments of PROCESS 5 A a-tocopherol (formula VTIb with n = 3; see above), (S-tocopherol (formula VTJ c with X1 = X3 = CH3, X2 = H and n = 3), y-tocopheroi (formula VTI c with X2 = X3 = CHs, X1 = H and n = 3) and 5-tocoph.erol (formula Vn c with X1 = X: = H, X3 = CHs and n = 3). preferably a-tocopherol and J3-tocopherol, more preferably a-tocophsrol, are/is acylated to the appropriate tocopheryl al-kanoates (compounds of the formula \TQ/VTJIa with s = 3 and R, X1, X" and X3 having the same meanings and preferences as above). More preferred the appropriate acetates are<br><br>
manufactured, especially with indium(III) salts (preferences see above) as the catalysts and at a temperature below 120°C, preferably at room temperature, i.e. a temperature between 15and40°C.<br>

It can be carried out using the same catalysts under substantially the same reaction conditions as described above for PROCESS 5A.<br>

200 mmol of TMHQ and 203 romol of P (corresponding a molar excess of 1.38 mol% -based on the amount of TMHQ) were reacted in 100 ml of toluene at 137°C or in 100 ml of heptane at 147°C.

With InCb excellent yields were obtained in both solvents, heptane and toluene. The selectivity for the formation of the desired 6-membered ring product (all-nac)-TCP with this catalyst was very high compared to results with hi(OTfh as a difference of 28 to 30% for the selectivity was observed.<br>
It was also found that in heptane a small excess of P (+1.38 mol%) led to a much better yield (see Table 5, example 22) than carrying out the reaction with equimolar amounts of IP and TMHQ. In fact, (all-rac)-TCP could be isolated in 93.9% yield after work-up. It has to be emphasized that at atmospheric pressure a TMHQ/IP ratio of 1.5/1 had to be used whereas, under pressure, an .equimolar ratio was sufficient to produce the desired chroman ring compound (all-nzc)-TCP in excellent yield.<br>
It is noteworthy that the proportion of TMHQ used for these reactions under pressure was twenty-fold higher than at atmospheric pressure (4 mol/L instead of 0.2 mol/L)=and it did not affect the yield of the reaction.<br>
Example 25: Preparation of faU-racVTCP with InCk as the catalyst and under pressure 200 mmol of TMHQ and 203 mmol of IP were reacted in 100 ml of toluene at 137°C.

Example 27: Preparation of (all-racVTCP with InC% as the catalyst and underpressure 200 mmol of TMHQ and 203 mmol of P were reacted in 100 ml of heptane at 147°C. The P was added during 120 minutes.

When the amount of InClj was reduced to 0.25 mol% (all-rac)-TCP was still obtained in good yield (see Table 6, examples 26 and 27). However a longer reaction time (e.g. up to 566 minutes in toluene, example 26) was needed to obtain nearly total ring closure.<br>
It appeared that best results were obtained (selectivity (yield)) for (all-nzc)-TCP using a catalyst amount of 0.5 mol% to 2 % InCls, especially in heptane. In toluene and in heptane, the desired chroman product (all-rac)-TCP could be isolated in 90.2 up to 96.0% yield.<br>

15.22 g (99.2 mmol) of TMHQ (99.2%), 29 mg (0.5 rnmol) of iron powder and 70 ml of toluene were added to a 200 m] flask equipped like the Biichi reactor and the resulting beige suspension was stirred at 750 rounds per minute. The reaction mixture was heated to I11 °C at a constant heating rate of 2 K per minute. HC1 was added at a -flow rate of 33.8 ml per minute and argon was added at a flow rate of 3.5 ml per minute. After 45 minutes the reaction temperature of 111°C had been reached and 31.01 g (102,4 mmol) of 1,2-dehydroisophytoi (97.3%; from Teranol in Lalden, Switzerland) were added at a feed rate of 0.13S g per minute during 225 minutes. During the addition of the 1,2-dehydroisophytol<br><br>
toluene was slowly distilled off in order to'keep the volume of the solution constant during all the reaction. The reaction temperature also increased from 111 °C to 15T*C. After completion of the addition of 1,2-dehydro-isophytol the reaction mixture was stirred at this temperature for 45 minutes and cooled down to room temperature. When the heating was switched off, the HC1 flow was stopped and replaced by a stronger argon flow. After 1 hour the temperature of the reaction mixture was 60°C. The reaction mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure (60°C at 300 to 18 mbar). The resulting oil was further concentrated under reduced pressure (60°C at 0.3 to 0.1 mbar) during more than 2 hours to yield the crude product (45.6 g). A qualitative GC analysis of the crude product showed that it contained mainly TMHQ (25.6%) and (all-r0c)-3,4-dehydro-a-tocopherol (21.1%).
