				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a compound of formula II and more particularly to prepare semi synthetic statines and to intermediates formed during said process.<br>
It is well known that certain mevalonate derivatives are active as hypercholesterolemic agents, which function by limiting the cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. These mevalonate derivatives are the naturally occurring fungal metabolites lovastatin and compactin. But also semi-synthetic and synthetic analogs thereof are active. The naturally occurring compounds lovastatin and compactin possess a 2-methylbutyrate side chain in the 8-position of the hexahydronaphtalene ring system. Analogs with a 2,2-dimethylbutyrate moiety in this position, such as simvastatin, appeared to be more effective inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase.<br>
These compounds can be synthesized from the naturally occurring compounds. In principle there are two possible routes for the introduction of an extra a-methyl group in the 8-acyl side chain which are:<br>
1.	direct alkylation of the 2-methylbutyrate side chain,<br>
2.	removal of the 2-methylbutyrate side chain and introduction<br>
of a 2,2-dimethyl butyrate chain.<br>
The main advantage of the direct alkylation route is the relatively high yields that can be obtained. However, there are several drawbacks. Direct methylation of unprotected lovastatin (U.S. patent 4,582,915) results in a rather impure simvastatin, containing a relatively high amount of unconverted lovastatin and many byproducts. Therefore, protection of the pyranone ring is required. A reduction of the byproducts was achieved by<br><br>
protecting the pyranone ring of  lovastatin prior to the alkylation with t-butyl dimethyl silyl chloride (European patent EP299656). However this is a very expensive protecting group. A less expensive protecting group is boronic acid as disclosed in international patent application WO 95/13283. Nevertheless, this route still suffers from the fact that it is difficult to obtain a complete conversion of the 2-methyl butyrate side chain into the 2,2-dimethyl butyrate side chain. Therefore, an additional purification is necessary. For example base hydrolysis of the remaining lovastatin to triol acid with NaOH or LiOH,  in which also part of the simvastatin is hydrolysed, followed by crystallization . Alternatively selective enzymatic hydrolysis of lovastatin (U.S. patent 5,223,415) may be applied. However, these extra purification steps will reduce the yield, and make the process less efficient.<br>
The second route, wherein the 2-methyl butyrate side chain is completely removed and another side chain is added, offers intrinsically a better quality product,as the separation of the hydrolyzed product and the esterified product is much easier to achieve compared to the unreacted starting material and the methylated product.<br>
In US patent 4 , 293 , 496 the removal of the 2-methyl butyrate side chain is achieved by base hydrolysis of lovastatin with an alkali metal hydroxide, preferably LiOH. This reaction requires long processing times (50-72 hours while refluxing) or rather stringent conditions (120°C-180°C) if shorter process times are used.<br>
In US patent 4,444,784 the introduction of a new side chain to the hydrolyzed lovastatin is disclosed. It involves several separate steps: relactonization of the mevinic acid, protection of the hydroxy group in the pyranone ring by reaction with t-butyl dimethyl silyl chloride, esterification with 2,2-dimethyl butyric acid and deprotection of the hydroxy group of the pyranone ring. The main disadvantages of this process route are the low yields, and the use of an expensive protecting group, viz. t-butyl dimethyl silyl.<br><br>
A much less expensive protecting group is disclosed in US patent 5,159,104. Instead of the t-butyl dimethyl silyl protection of the OH-group in the pyranone ring, the OH-group was esterified with an acetic anhydride or an acylhalide. However, this process still suffers from a poor yield.<br>
The present invention provides a new,  rather inexpensive, crystalline intermediate which can be used in both synthesis routes. In addition a novel, quick and less expensive process for the quantitative removal of the 2-methyl butyryl side chain and addition of another side chain, is disclosed, including novel, crystalline intermediates for the preparation of semi synthetic lovastatin and compactin intermediates. Besides that, a much higher yield for the removal of the side chain of about 95% was obtained compared to the yield of about 65% obtained in a comparable process as described by Askin et al in J. Org. Chem.  1991  vol  56,  pages  4929-4932.  Furthermore,  by the application of the process of the present invention for the synthesis of semisynthetic statins, as for instance simvastatin, the use of the carcinogenic methyliodide is avoided, which is required in the direct methylation route.<br>
The process of the present invention comprises a surprisingly selective removal of the 8' (R3')-side chain, for instance the 2-methyl butyryl side chain in lovastatin, to triol acid intermediate and another alcohol, by reduction with a reducing agent such as LiAlH4 or a Grignard reagent, or to a triol acid intermediate and an amide by reaction with an amine. During this reaction the starting material is quantitatively converted into the triol acid intermediate, which offers excellent possibilities for the introduction of various side chains.<br>
