				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of polymorphic Form V of (1S-cis)-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-methyl-l-naphthaleneamine     hydrochloride<br>
i.e. sertraline hydrochlroide.  Sertraline hydrochloride is an agent for treatment for<br>
depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder (WO 00/32551).<br>
The need for the drugs, which lack the obstrusive and limiting side effects of the tricyclic antidepressants had prompted the search for agents with greatly enhanced selectivity for specific mechanisms of actions believed to be essential for antidepressant efficacy. Researches targeted for selective competitive inhibitors of synaptosomal serotonin reuptake, which led to series of 1-methylamine-4-aryltetralins, of which the most promising was the 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl) analogue. Testing of all possible steroisomers revealed that the required high selectivity for serotonin resides in the cis-1S,4S isomer i.e. (1S-cis)-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-methyl-1-naphthaleneamine hydrochloride (I) commonly known as sertraline hydrochloride.<br><br>
In  the  literature various polymorphic  forms  of sertraline  hydrochloride have  been described. In light of current interest of pharmaceutical industry, the polymorphic Form V<br>
2<br><br>
is of very much importance (WO 00/32551). Hence, a need was felt to produce the polymorphic Form V of sertraline hydrochloride in bulk by a process which is both efficient and cost-effective.<br>
The "sublimation - condensation method" for preparation of Form V is disclosed in US Patent No. 5,248,699. However, the said "sublimation - condensation method" is not practical on a commercial scale, considering the demand of sertraline hydrochloride Form - V. This is especially because "sublimation - condensation method" requires special assembly, wherein simultaneously high vacuum and temperature is required to be applied to sublime the starting material, whereas to collect the sublimation product, it invites the special apparatus and skills. Further more, the complexity of the issue is compounded as per the disclosure in WO 0032551, because the "sublimation - condensation method" is not found to be reproducible.<br>
WO 0032551 and WO 0172684 mainly uses sertraline hydrochloride (Scheme - 1) or sertraline base (Scheme - 2) for making sertraline hydrochloride Form V.<br>
Scheme-1<br>
Sertraline mandelate ? Sertraline Base ? Sertraline. HCl ? Sertraline HCl Form V<br>
Scheme - 2<br>
Sertraline mendelate ? Sertraline Base ? Sertraline HCl Form V<br>
3<br><br>
Further, WO 0132601 discloses processes for making sertraline hydrochloride Form V<br>
from using sertraline base. The preparation of sertraline hydrochloride Form V using the teachings of WO 0132601 Scheme - 3 or Scheme - 4. is as given below:<br>
Scheme - 3<br>
Sertraline mandelate ? Sertraline Base ? Sertraline. HCl (Form - CSC 2) ? Sertraline<br>
HCl-Form V.<br>
Scheme - 4<br>
Sertraline mandelate ? Sertraline Base ? Sertraline. HCl ? Sertraline HCl Alcohol Solvate ? Sertraline HCl Form V.<br>
As per procedures disclosed in US 5248699, US 4536518, WO 032551, the sertraline base is prepared using sertraline mandelate that involves a number of steps implying increase in utilities, manpower, time required to complete the production cycle. Thus, the said processes are commercially expensive,<br>
Thus a need was felt for production of the polymorphic—Form—V  of sertraline<br>
hydrochloride by a simple, efficient and cost effective process.<br>
The first object of the present invention is to provide an efficient and cost effective<br>
process for the preparation of sertraline salts.<br>
The second object of the present invention is to provide an efficient and cost effective<br>
process for the preparation of the polymorphic Form V of sertraline hydrochloride.<br>
4<br><br><br>
The third object of the present invention is to produce sertraline hydrochloride Form V having characteristic X-ray diffraction pattern data (XRPD).<br>
The fourth object of the invention is to produce for sertraline hydrochloride Form V having characteristics ICR spectrum.<br>
The fifth object of the invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition with sertraline hydrochloride Form V as the active ingredient.<br>
The present invention provides for a    process for the production of sertraline salt, comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	dissolving or suspending sertraline mandelate in a solvent;<br>
b)	reducing the pH of the solution or the suspension and<br>
c)	isolating salt of sertraline.<br>
The present invention  also provides for a process  for the production of. sertraline hydrochloride Form V comprising the steps of:<br>
a)   dissolving or suspending sertraline mandelate in a solvent;<br>
5<br><br>
b)	reducing the pH of the solution or the suspension and<br>
c)	isolating sertraline hydrochloride Form V.<br>
The present invention further provides for a process for preparation of a pharmaceutical composition of sertraline hydrochloride Form V by using sertraline hydrochloride Form V as active ingredient.<br>
Sertraline hydrochloride of formula (I) exists in different polymorphic forms, viz. Form I<br>
to XVI, T1, CSC - 1, CSC - 2 and amorphous Form. Crystallization for polymorphs is normally done by dissolving or melting the compound followed by gradual or fast cooling of the resultant solution or molten liquid. Different polymorphic forms are identical in solution as evident from their NMR, IR (solution spectra data). On the other hand, solid-state techniques like X-ray or IR (KBr spectra) revealed the difference between polymorphic Forms.<br>
The present invention provides new process for making sertraline hydrochloride Form V starting from sertraline mandelate.<br>
According to the instant process, sertraline mandeiate need not be converted into<br>
sertraline base and subsequently into sertraline hydrochloride unlike the prior art<br>
processes. The multiple steps involved in the prior art processes including an. intermediate step for conversion of sertraline mandeiate into sertraline base or sertraline<br>
hydrochloride of different Form (other 'than Form V) of sertraline hydrochloride is avoided because the present invention provides converting sertraline mandeiate to sertraline hydrochloride Form V directly. Thus, the present invention provides the manufacturing process, which reduces number of steps implying decrease in utilities,<br>
6<br><br>
manpower, time required to complete the production cycle. Thus, the instant invention provides a simple one-step process for production of sertraline hydrochloride Form V in an efficient and cost effective manner.<br>
A process according to the instant invention for the production of sertraline salt, is comprising the steps of:<br>
d)	dissolving or suspending sertraline mandelate in a solvent;<br>
e)	reducing the pH of the solution or the suspension and<br>
f)	isolating salt of sertraline.<br>
The-pelymophic Form V of sertraline hydrochloride is prepared-accordmg to the instant invention by a process comprising<br>
d)	dissolving or suspending sertraline mandelate in a solvent;<br>
e)	reducing the pH of the solution or the suspension and<br>
