Preparation of the compound of formula 2:<br>
Cyclopropyltropine 2a:<br>
35 ml (0.35 mol) of 40% aqueous potassium hydroxide solution is overlaid with 100 ml of diethyl ether and cooled in the ice bath. For this, 23.64 g (0.101 mol) of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea are added batchwise and then the mixture is stirred for about 10 minutes. The ether phase is decanted off and the solution obtained is used in the following step.<br>
25 ml of the diazomethane solution prepared above are added to a solution of 4.01 g (0.028 mol) of tropenol in 25 ml of diethyl ether and 5 ml of methanol while cooling with an ice bath. Then 53.4 mg (0.000139 mol) of bis(benzonitrile)dichloro-palladium(ll) are added. A further 28 ml of the diazomethane solution are then added batchwise. After about 1.5 hours the solvent is distilled off in vacuo, the residue remaining is extracted, this solution is filtered and the solvent is removed by distillation. Yield: 4.25 g of slightly yellowish crystals of 2a (= 96% of theoretical)<br>

204.4 g (1.44 mol) of methyl iodide the mixture is stirred for 24 hours at<br>
ambient temperature (about 20-23°C). The solution is evaporated down to the<br>
residue, the residue is taken up in diethyl ether and extracted with water. The<br>
organic phase is washed with 5% aqueous sodium carbonate solution and<br>
water, dried and the solvent is distilled off. The product is purified by<br>
recrystallisation from cyclohexane. Yield: 77.19 g of white crystals (= 81 % of<br>

It was found that the compounds according to the invention of formula 1 are antagonists of the M3 receptor (Muscarinic Receptor subtype 3). The compounds according to the invention have Ki values of less than 10nM in terms of their affinity for the M3 receptor. These values were determined by the method described below.<br>
Chemicals<br>
3H-NMS was obtained from Messrs Amersham of Braunschweig, with a specific radioactivity of 3071 GBq/mmol (83 Ci/mmol). All the other reagents were obtained from Serva of Heidelberg and Merck of Darmstadt.<br>
Cell membranes:<br>
We used cell membranes from CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells which were transfected with the corresponding genes of the human muscarinic receptor subtypes hm1 to hm5 (BONNER). The cell membranes of the desired subtype were thawed, resuspended by hand with a glass homogeniser and diluted with HEPES buffer to a final concentration of 20-30 mg of protein/ml.<br>
Receptor binding studies:<br>
The binding assay was carried out in a final volume of 1 ml and consisted of 100 µl of unlabelled substance in various concentrations, 100 µl of radioligand (3H-N-methylscopolamine 2 nmol/L (3H-NMS), 200 µl of membrane preparation and 600 µl of HEPES buffer (20 mmol/L HEPES, 10 mmol/L MgCI2, 100 mmol/L NaCI, adjusted with 1 mol/L NaOH to pH 7.4). The nonspecific binding was determined using 10 pmol/l of atropine. The preparation was incubated for 45 min. at 37°C in 96-well microtitre plates (Beckman, polystyrene, No. 267001) as a double measurement. The incubation was ended by filtering using an Inotech Cell Harvester (type IH 110) through Whatman G-7 filters. The filters were washed with 3 ml of ice-cooled HEPES buffer and dried before measuring.<br>
Determining the radioactivity:<br>
The radioactivity of the filter mats was measured simultaneously using a two-dimensional digital autoradiograph (Berthold, Wildbad, type 3052).<br>
Evaluation:<br>
The Ki values were calculated using implicit equations which were derived directly from the mass-action law, with the model for the 1 receptor 2 ligand reaction (SysFit software, SCHITTKOWSKI).<br>

Moreover, the active substances 1 according to the invention may be administered in the form of propellant-free inhalable solutions and suspensions. The solvent used may be an aqueous or alcoholic, preferably an ethanolic solution. The solvent may be water on its own or a mixture of water and ethanol. The relative proportion of ethanol compared with water is not limited but the maximum is up to 70 percent by volume, more particularly up to 60 percent by volume and most preferably up to 30 percent by volume. The remainder of the volume is made up of water. The solutions or suspensions containing 1 are adjusted to a pH of 2 to 7, preferably 2 to 5, using suitable acids. The pH may be adjusted using acids selected from inorganic or organic acids. Examples of particularly suitable inorganic acids include hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, sulphuric acid and/or phosphoric acid. Examples of particularly suitable organic acids include<br>
ascorbic acid, citric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, acetic acid, formic acid and/or propionic acid etc. Preferred inorganic acids are hydrochloric and sulphuric acids. It is also possible to use the acids which have already formed an acid addition salt with one of the active substances. Of the organic acids, ascorbic acid, fumaric acid and citric acid are preferred. If desired, mixtures of the above acids may be used, particularly in the case of acids which have other properties in addition to their acidifying qualities, e.g. as flavourings, antioxidants or complexing agents, such as citric acid or ascorbic acid, for example. According to the invention, it is particularly preferred to use hydrochloric acid to adjust the pH.<br>
According to the invention, the addition of editic acid (EDTA) or one of the known salts thereof, sodium edetate, as stabiliser or complexing agent is unnecessary in these formulations. Other embodiments may contain this compound or these compounds. In a preferred embodiment the content based on sodium edetate is less than 100 mg/100ml, preferably less than 50mg/100ml, more preferably less than 20mg/100ml. Generally, inhalable solutions in which the content of sodium edetate is from 0 to 10mg/100ml are preferred.<br>
Co-solvents and/or other excipients may be added to the propellant-free inhalable solutions according to the invention. Preferred co-solvents are those which contain hydroxyl groups or other polar groups, e.g. alcohols -particularly isopropyl alcohol, glycols - particularly propyleneglycol, polyethyleneglycol, polypropyleneglycol, glycolether, glycerol, polyoxyethylene alcohols and polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters. The terms excipients and additives in this context denote any pharmacologically acceptable substance which is not an active substance but which can be formulated with the active substance or substances in the physiologically suitable solvent in order to improve the qualitative properties of the active substance formulation. Preferably, these substances have no pharmacological effect or, in connection with the desired therapy, no appreciable or at least no undesirable pharmacological effect. The excipients and additives include, for example, surfactants such as soya lecithin, oleic acid, sorbitan esters, such as polysorbates, polyvinylpyrrolidone, other stabilisers, complexing agents, antioxidants and/or preservatives which guarantee or prolong the shelf life of the finished pharmaceutical formulation, flavourings, vitamins and/or other additives known in the art. The additives<br>
also include pharmacologically acceptable salts such as sodium chloride as isotonic agents.<br>
