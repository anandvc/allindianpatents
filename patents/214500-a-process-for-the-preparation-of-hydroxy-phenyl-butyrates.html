				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a novel, inventive process for the stereoselective prepara¬tion of 2-hydroxybutyrates, in particular of 2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutyrates also referred  as HPB ester hereinafter and of their precursors.<br>
HPB esters of formula<br><br>
wherein A is substituents, m is an integer from 0 to 5 and R is an ester group and wherein the symbol * indicates a chiral centre, are Important intermediates for the preparation of pharmacologically effective ACE inhibitors (ACE: angiotensin converting enzyme) which have the following shared structural feature:<br><br>
ACE inhibitors belong to the active ingredient group of the antihypertensives and effect after oral administration a competitive inhibition of the so-called angiotensin converting enzyme and thus a lowering of the blood pressure. A particularly preferred HPB ester has the R-con-figuration.<br>
An important active ingredient is 3-[(1-(ethoxycarbonyl)-3-phenyl-{1S)-propyl)amino]-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-2-oxo-1H-1-(3S)-benzazepine-1-acetic acid hydrochloride which is known under the INN name benazepril HCI and which is commercially available in diverse oral forms of presentation, e.g. tablets, under the registered trademark Cibacen® (trademark of Novartis AG, Basel Switzerland). HPB esters can furthermore be used as intermediates for the prepa¬ration of other known ACE inhibitors, for example enalapril, cilazapril, spirapril, quinapril, ramipril or lisinopril (INN names). HPB esters can also be used for the synthesis of different types of insecticides.<br>
Many different methods are known for preparing R-configurated HPB esters, for example re¬ductions with micro-organisms or enzymes, enantioselective hydrogenations with homogene¬ous or heterogeneous catalysts, diastereoselective hydrogenations, reduction with hydrides.<br><br>
reactions with so-called chiral building blocks, enzymatic racemate resolution or racemate resolutions on chiral substrates, or inversion of the S-HPB ester.<br>
These methods are disadvantageous for various reasons, such as<br>
•	use of costly educts, e.g. 2-oxo-4-phenylbutyric acid<br>
•	reaction at low concentrations (general problem in the case of biological or enzymatic processes)<br>
•	high process costs in the case of homogeneous catalysis<br>
•	maximum yield of only 50 % in the case of racemate resolutions.<br>
This invention has for its object to enantioselectively synthesise 2-hydroxybutyrates of the desired configuration, in particular HPB esters, starting from starting materials which are obtainable by simple synthesis. In the narrower meaning, this invention has for its object to enantioselectively synthesise HPB esters having the desired R-configuration without the losses necessitated by racemate resolution.<br>
European patent application No. 206 993 describes the preparation of HPB esters through heterogeneous catalytic reduction with platinum catalysts of a-keto esters of formula<br><br>
The hydrogenation can be carried out enantioselectively in the presence of a chiral modifier, e.g. cinchonidine, so that the desired R-form is predominantly obtained. In spite of this possi¬bility, this process is disadvantageous because the a-keto ester must be prepared before¬hand, the synthesis of which over several process steps is complicated.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that starting from the a,Y-diketo esters of formula<br><br>
(Ri e.g. phenyl) which are accessible by simple Claisen condensation, or from their tauto¬meric a-unsaturated a-hydroxy-y-keto esters:<br><br><br>
an a-hydroxy-y-keto ester is obtained by enantioselective hydrogenation in the presence of a suitable chiral modifier, wliich a-hydroxy-y-keto ester can be crystallised in enantiomerically pure form, for example in the desired R-configuration, in high optical yield and which can be converted to 2-hydroxybutyrate in a subsequent catalytic hydrogenation.<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of compounds of formulae<br><br>

which process comprises enantioselectively hydrogenating an a,Y-diketo ester of formula<br><br>
wherein R, R, and R2 have the cited meanings, or the tautomer thereof, with platinum as catalyst in the presence of a cinchona alkaloid as chiral modifie and, if desired, hydrogenat¬ing for the preparation of a compound (lA) or (IB), wherein n is v, one of the obtainable com¬pounds of formulae<br><br>

A chiral modifier contains a basic nitrogen atom which is close to one or several chiral cen¬tres, which in turn are bound to a bicyclic aromatic compound. Suitable chiral modifiers are described by A.Pfaltzand T.Heinzin Topics in Catalysis 4(1997) 229-239. Preferred modi¬fiers are cinchona alkaloids which are known under this name and which belong to the group of quinoline vegetable bases which can be isolated mainly from the bark of trees of the cin-<br><br>
chona and remijia family. This definition embraces in particular the alkaloids (-)-quinine, (+)-quinidine, (+)-cinchonine and (-)-cinchonidine. The use of (-)-quinine and (-)-cinchonidine results in compounds (III) in the R-form (III A), and the use of (+)-quinidine and (+)-cincho-nine results in compounds (III) in the S-form (III B). It is preferred to use (-)-cinchonidine and derivatives thereof.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of this invention, the chiral modifiers used for the preparation of the R-form (III A) are derivatives of the (-)-cinchonidine of formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
R      is hydrogen, methyl, acetyl, lactoyl or lactoyl etherified by benzyl, and<br>
R"     is ethyl or hydroxymethyl.<br>
Compound (IV) wherein R is hydrogen and R" is ethyl is known under the name 10,11-di-hydrocinchonidine (HCd), and compound (IV) wherein R is methyl and R" is ethyl is known under the name O-methoxy-10,11-dihydrocinchonidine (MeOHCd), and compound (IV) wherein R is hydrogen and R" is hydroxymethyl is known under the name norcinchol.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process, the chiral modifier (IV) is 10,11-dihydrocinchoni¬dine (HCd).<br>
The enantioselective reduction is carried out in a manner known per se. The platinum cata¬lysts used can be in the form of so-called polymer-stabilised colloidal metal clusters, such as those described by X. Zuo etal. in Tetrahedron Letter 39(1998) 1941-1944, or are preferably applied to suitable substrates. Examples of suitable substrates are carbon, aluminium oxide, silicium dioxide, Cr2O3, zirconium dioxide, zinc oxide, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, ba¬rium sulfate, calcium carbonate or aluminium phosphate. Aluminium oxide is preferred. The catalysts are activated in a manner known per se with hydrogen at about 200 to 400°C and are then modified with the solution of cinchona alkaloid and impregnated, and/or the cincho¬na alkaloid is added direct during reduction.<br><br>
Hydrogenation is carried out in the presence of water or of an organic solvent. It is preferred to use polar and non-polar aprotic or polar protic solvents or mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of suitable non-polar aprotic solvents are hydrocarbons, for example aliphatic hydrocarbons, e.g. hexane, heptane or petroleum ether, cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, for example cyclohexane or methylcyclohexane, aromatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene or xylene.<br>
Examples of suitable polar aprotic solvents are ethers, for example aliphatic ethers, e.g. dl-isopropyl ether, 1,2-diethoxyethane or tert-butylmethyl ether, cyclic ethers, for example tetra-hydrofuran or dioxane, amides, for example dimethylformamide or N-methylpyrrolidone. Particularly suitable are ethers, in particular tetrahydrofuran.<br>
Examples of suitable polar protic solvents are alcohols, for example ethanol or n-butanoj.<br>
The process may preferably be carried out In the liquid phase batchwise or continuously, preferably with a catalyst suspension as liquid-phase hydrogenation or in a bubble column or with a formated catalyst in a trickle bed. The reaction can also be carried out in the gas phase with a powdered catalyst in a fluidised bed or with a formulated catalyst in a fixed bed.<br>
The hydrogenation can be carried out in a wide range of temperatures. Advantageous tem¬peratures have been found to be those in the range from room temperature to about 100°C, preferably from 20° to about SOX.<br>
The hydrogen pressure can vary within a wide range during hydrogenation, for example from 1 - 200, preferably from 5-100, more preferably from 10-60 bar. Which hydrogen pressure is used depends essentially on the hydrogenation plant available.<br>
The reaction time can vary within wide limits and depends on the catalyst used, on the hyd¬rogen pressure, on the reaction temperature and on the plant used. It can be, for example, in the range from half an hour to 24 hours. Advantageous reaction times are those from about half an hour to two hours.<br>
The isolation of the reaction products is carried out by known methods and is illustrated in the Examples. After separating the catalyst and removing the solvent, the customary separa¬tion processes may follow, for example preparative thin-layer chromatography, preparative HPLC, preparative gas chromatography and the like. In a particularly preferred embodiment of this invention, the R-compound (III A) is crystallised from a suitable solvent. Diisopropyl ether has been found to be a particularly advantageous solvent. The R-compound (III A) is obtained in a special optical purity ee of up to 99 % by crystallisation from this solvent.<br><br>
The subsequent hydrogenation of the compound (III A) or (III B) with palladium as catalyst, e.g. palladium (black) or palladium chloride, is carried out in a manner known per se. The palladium catalysts used are applied to substrates. In a preferred embodiment of this inven¬tion palladium is applied to carbon.<br>
The solvents used are polar protic solvents, for example ethanol. If required, acid assistants are added, for example organic mono- or polyvalent acids containing more than two carbon atoms, for example acetic acid, propionic acid or malonic acid, mineral acids, for example hydrogen chloride or sulfuric acid, so-called Lewis acids, for example boron trifluoride, or so-called solid acids, such as zeolites or Nafion® and/or dehydrating agents, for example sodi¬um sulfate.<br>
The isolation of the reaction products is carried out by known methods and is described in the Examples. After separating the catalyst and removing the solvent, the customary separa¬tion processes may follow, for example preparative thin-layer chromatography, preparative HPLC, preparative gas chromatography and the like.<br>
Compounds of formulae<br><br>
wherein A is substituents, m is an integer from 0 to 5 and Et is ethyl, are novel and are also a subject matter of this invention.<br>
A particularly preferred embodiment of this invention is the compound (R)-2-hydroxy-4-oxo-4-phenylbutyric acid ethyl ester.<br>
Enantiomerically pure compounds of formula<br><br>
wherein R is an ester group with the exception of methyl, are novel and are also a subject matter of this invention.<br>
Enantiomerically pure compounds of formula (III A") or (III B"), wherein R is hydrogen or methyl, are known {CAS 61689-31-4 and 61689-32-5).<br><br>
A particularly preferred subject matter of this invention is the compound 5,5-dimethyl-(R)-2-hydroxy-4-oxohexanoic acid ethyl ester.<br>
This invention also relates to the use of compound I A" having an R-configuration for the pre¬paration of compounds comprising the group<br><br>
as component, and correspondingly to the use of compound I B" having an S-configuration for the preparation of compounds comprising the group<br><br>
as component.<br>
Compounds (lA"), in particular, are valuable intermediates for the preparation of ACE-inhibitors or of their further precursors. In a number of effective ACE-inhibitors, see e.g. EP-A-50 850 and EP-A-72 352, the pharmacophoric group is defined as partial structure<br><br>
having an S-configuration. This group is present in known ACE-inhibitors called benazepril, enalapril, ciiazapril, spirapril, quinapril, ramipril and lisinopril. The pharmacological effect of ACE-inhibitors is described in numerous textbooks of pharmacology and pharmaceutical chemistry, inter alia in Helwig/Otto, Arzneimittel, Vol. I, 30-127- 131, Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft mbH Stuttgart 1995.<br>
The introduction of the amino group, see the above partial structure, is carried out by known processes, for example by esterification of the HPB ester at the hydroxy! group via a sulfonyl group, for example trifluoromethanesulfonyl, so that this hydroxy! group is substituted by a leaving group. This derivative is then reacted, with inversion, with an amino compound which<br><br>
comprises the group -NH-R (R = additional substituents characterising the ACE-inhibitor), so that an S-configurated compound is obtained. Further processing to pharmacologically ac¬tive ACE-inhibitors is described in EP-A-206 993. In detail, these further processing steps have the advantage that the compounds (I) can be reacted in the respective desired configu¬ration (lA) or (IB) with amino compounds without any disadvantageous racemisation or with¬out the occurrence of elimination products.<br>
The further processing of the HPB esters to insecticides of suitable structure can be carried out by the method described in the British patent specification No. 1 014 243.<br>
Compounds (I A) and (IB), wherein R1 is hydroxy, etherified hydroxy or C1-C4alkyl, Ra is hydrogen or C1-C4alkyl and n is 0 or 1, are valuable starting materials for the synthesis, e.g. D-maleic acid having an "unnatural" configuration, or intermediates for the synthesis of correspondingly configurated amino acids, or can be used as ligand formers in complex chemistry, in particular the diketones of the compounds (I A) or (I B), wherein n is 1.<br>
The preparation of α,γ-diketo esters or of their tautomeric a-unsaturated a-hydroxy-y-keto esters (II) can be carried out in analogy to the classic method described by C.Beyer and LCIaisen in Berichte, Vol. XX (1887) 2178 - 2188.<br>
Example 1: a)<br><br>
2.0 g of 1 (MG 220.24; 9.08 mmol) are dissolved with 30 ml of toluene in a 50 ml stainless steel autoclave, equipped with double-walled jacket, magnetic stirrer and baffles. This so¬lution is charged with 50 mg of 5% Pt/Al2O3 (Engelhard 4759, pretreated for 2 h in H2 at 400°C) and 5 mg of 10,11-dihydrocinchonidine. The autoclave is closed and rinsed twice with argon and twice with hydrogen. Subsequently, 60 bar H2 are forced in and the reaction is started by stirring with the magnetic stirrer (1200 rpm). During the reaction the tempera¬ture is kept at 25°C (thermostat) and the pressure at 60 bar H2. Hydrogen uptake is com¬pleted after a reaction time of 160 min. After relaxation, the autoclave is rinsed again with argon. The reaction mixture is filtered and concentrated by evaporation, giving 1.97 g of 2 [MG 222.24; yield: 98%; purity: &gt; 97% (HPLC, NMR); ee-product = 87% (HPLC); MS: M+: 222; 1-H NMR (CDCI3, TMS): 7.95 (d, 2H), 7.60 (dd. 1H), 7.45 (dd, 2H), 4.65 (m, 1H), 4.25<br><br>

b) The hydroxy ester 2 (73.85 g; 0.332 mol; ee = 76%) is dissolved in 220 ml of diisopropyl ether. After adding some seeding crystals, the solution is cooled in a water bath to 15°C. The crystallisation starts after 5 min. The mixture is stirred for another 30 min and the crystallisa¬tion is ended by stirring for 30 min at 10°C and for 2 hours at 0°C. The product is collected by filtration, washed once with 70 ml of ice-cold diisopropyl ether and dried overnight under vacuum at room temperature. Yield: 47.14 g (63.8%, yellowish crystals); melting point (not corrected): 37.0°C; purity ee-product (HPLC.OD, hexane/ethanol/TFA 970 ml/30 ml/0.4 ml): 99%.<br>
c) <br>
A solution of hydroxy ester 3 (46.0 g, 0.20 mol; ee=99%) in 170 ml of ethanol is charged with 5% Pd/C (460 mg), HCI in ethanol (12 % w/v; 18.7 ml). The mixture is shaken at room tem¬perature and hydrogenated for 5 Va hours at 1 bar H2 in a glass shaker. The catalyst is re¬moved by filtration and the solvent is removed by evaporation. The yellowish oily residue is purified by distillation (boiling point: 98-102°C/ 0.05 bar). Yield: 38.9 g (90 %, colourless liquid); purity ee-product (HPLC, OD-H, hexane/ethanol/TFA : 970/30/0.4 ml): 99%.<br>
Example 2:<br><br>
5.0 mg of MeOHCd (O-methoxy-10,11-dihydrocinchonidine) are placed in a 50 ml stainless steel autoclave, equipped with double-walled jacket, magnetic stirrer and baffles. 50 mg of 5% Pt/AlaOa (JMC 94, pretreated for 2 h in H2 at 400°C) are added and the mixture is sus¬pended in 5 ml of EtOH and in 2.0 g of 5 (C4H4O5, fVlG 132.07) dissolved in 20 ml of EtOH. The autoclave is closed and rinsed three times each with argon and with hydrogen. The pressure is then raised to 60 bar H2 and the reaction is started by stirring with the magnetic<br><br>
stirrer. After reacting for 160 min and relaxing, the autoclave is rinsed with argon. The reaction nnixture is filtered and EtOH is removed by evaporation, giving 2.04 g of 6 [C4H6O5, MG 134.08; yield: 100%; ee-product = 62% (HPLC)].<br>
Example 3:<br><br>
0.72 g of 8 [CBHUOS, MG 190.20; yield: 89% ee-product: 70% (HPLC)] is prepared in ana¬logy to Example 2 by hydrogenating 0.8 g of 7 (CsHiaOs, MG 188.18) in 5.0 mg of HCd (10,11-dihydrocinchonidine).<br>
Example 4:<br>
The compounds 10,12,14 can be prepared in analogy to Example 2 by hydrogenating 9, 11,13 using HCd as chiral modifier in ethanol or toluene as solvent:<br><br>
02: NMR:1.16 ppm (s, 9H, CH3), 1.30 ppm (t, 3H, CH3), 3.02 ppm (d, 2H, CH2). 3.24 (d. 1H. OH), 4.25, (q, 2H, CH2), 4.46 (dd, 1H, CH)]<br><br><br>
Example 5<br>
A 50 ml micro-autoclave is charged with 126.5 mg of 5% Pt-Si02 (Heraeus B 98/15) and 14.1 mg of dihydrocinchonidine. Subsequently, 4.98 g of diketo ester (1, 5, 7, 9, H, 13 as 20% solution in toluene) are added. The autoclave is closed and rinsed three times each with 10 bar argon and 10 bar hydrogen. The hydrogen pressure in the autoclave is adjusted to 40 bar and the valve is closed. The reaction is started by switching on the stirrer. During hydrogen uptake, the temperature in the vessel rises from 22°C to 28°C. After about half an hour, the pressure in the vessel must be raised again to about 40 bar because it has sunken to about 20 bar through the hydrogen consumption. After three hours the reaction is stopped and the hydrogenation mixture is filtered off from the catalyst and analysed (HPLC on chiral column). A reaction of 100% at an ee of 74% is found.<br><br><br>
