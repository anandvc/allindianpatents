				<td>The invention relates to a wiper device, especially for the windshields of automobiles, comprising a powered wiper arm (20) mounted by one end on the automobile. The free end (21) of said arm is releasably hinged to a long wiper blade (12) that has a wiper strip (22) by means of a connecting device (18) having a hinge bolt (24) on the arm side. The hinge axis of said bolt extends substantially crosswise relative to the longitudinal direction of the wiper blade in working direction (double arrow 88) of the wiper device. On the wiper blade side, said wiper device also has coupling part (26) with a bore-like bearing support for the hinge bolt (24) in a central section of the wiper blade (12) on the side thereof opposite the windshield (16). The bearing support has open edges in the insertion channel (70) for the hinge bolt (72) that is oriented on its surface area in the direction of the axis of the bore and is provided with a narrowing (94) that can be elastically widened to match the diameter (92) of the hinge bolt, the width of said narrowing being smaller than the diameter of the bore. A particularly reliable hinge connection between the wiper arm and the wiper blade that is capable of resisting difficult working conditions is achieved by fitting the coupling part (26) with a separate locking element (42) in order to form the narrowing. Said separate coupling element can be moved from a locked position blocking the insertion channel into a opening position that releases the insertion channel by a restoring force (96).</td>

ROBERT BOSCH GMBH, 70442 Stuttgart<br>
Wiping device, in particular for wihdows of motor vehicles<br>
Prior art<br>
A wiping device according to the invention also includes, in addition to the driven wiper arm, the wiper blade which is to be fastened to one free end thereof. The connecting device required for this has, both on the arm side and on the blade side, appropriately designed coupling means which correspond with one another.<br>
The invention is based on a wiping device according to the generic type of Claim 1. In the case of a known wiping device of this type (DE 23 13 689 Al), the wiper blade belonging to the wiping device, or the coupling part thereof, has a guide channel which is open towards a main body of the wiper strip and in which a hairpin-shaped securing spring can be displaced between an installation position and a locking position. This securing spring serves for opening and for closing a recess which is arranged in the coupling part and constitutes the bearing recess for the wiper-arm hinge pin. The securing spring is prestressed towards a rubber basic body of the wiper strip, with the result that the friction between the rubber and spring has to be overcome in order to displace the spring. On the one hand, the displaceability of the spring is intended to be smooth-running for the user, for example when exchanging the wiper blade, but, on the other hand, the spring has to reliably close the bearing recess in the channel wall during the wiping mode, so that the wiper blade  cannot  be  detached  from  the  wiper  arm<br><br>
unintentionally. These two contradictory requirements cannot be implemented equally satisfactorily.<br>
In the case of another wiping device which does not have this deficiency (DE-A 10 28 896),'a coupling part on the wiper-blade side is integrally formed as a single piece on the rubber-elastic wiper strip. The coupling part has a hole-type bearing holder for a hinge pin which is on the arm side and can be placed into the bearing holder of the wiper blade transversely with respect to its longitudinal axis via an elastically expandable installation slot. The type of hinge connection will reliably function at best at low driving speeds and small quantities of precipitation in the form of rain. In the case of heavy precipitation and/or high driving speeds and in the case of precipitation in the form of snow, in particular in the form of wet snow, the forces acting from the wiper blade on the hinge connection may exceed the holding capacity of the rubber-elastic coupling part and detach the wiper blade from the wiper arm.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
The wiping device according to the invention having the characterizing features of Claim 1 is distinguished by a simple and operationally reliable hinge connection between the wiper arm and wiper blade. In order to connect the wiper blade to the wiper arm, the hinge pin thereof is placed with temporary elastic expansion of the narrow point into the bearing holder of the wiper blade, the blocking element being moved counter to the restoring force into its opening position, with the result that the hinge pin enters into its bearing holder. The restoring force then automatically brings the blocking element into its blocking position. The blocking element can be produced from material of such a stiffness that the operating forces acting on the<br><br>
hinge point between the wiper blade and wiper arm can be absorbed without disadvantageous consequences for the hinge connection,<br>
A simple construction of the wiping device is produced in that the coupling part has a housing part which is connected fixedly to the wiper blade and on which the blocking element is guided displaceably in the longitudinal direction of the wiper blade*<br>
In order to achieve a particularly robust construction of the coupling for connecting the wiper blade to the wiper arm, the housing part has two guide walls which extend in the longitudinal direction of the wiper blade, are arranged at a distance from each other and between which the blocking element is guided displaceably.<br>
If, in a further refinement of the invention, the bearing holder for the hinge pin of the wiper arm penetrates the two guide walls and the blocking element, the shaped-out portions, which are matched to the cross section of the hinge pin, in the guide walls and in the blocking element situated in the blocking position being at least approximately completed to form a circle, seen in the direction of the hinge axis, the result is an operationally reliable, play-free fixing of the hinge pin on the wiper-arm side in the coupling part of the wiper blade and therefore a :'erk-free movement of the wiper blade over the window to be wiped.<br>
In order for it to be possible for the wiper blade to be connected to the wiper arm without any problem even by people who are not experts, each of the bearing-holder sections formed in this manner is open, via a respective through-channel section, to that side of the coupling part which faces away from the side [sic], the<br><br>
width of each through-channel section being greater than the diameter of the hinge pin.<br>
The blocking element is preferably loaded towards the blocking position by spring means supported on the housing part. This can be achieved in a cost-effeetive manner by a helical compression spring forming the spring means.<br>
The installation of the coupling part can be simplified in that the spring means are formed by a leg spring connected in one piece to the housing part which consists of a flexible plastic.<br>
If the bearing section of the blocking element is provided with a run-on slope which is spaced apart opposite the shaped-out portion of the said bearing section and encloses an acute angle a with the displacement direction of the blocking element, the wiper blade can be detached from the wiper arm in a simple manner by bringing the blocking element into its opening position, the run-on slope pressing the hinge pin out of the bearing sections in the guide walls.<br>
The blocking element is guided between the two guide walls in a manner which is also stable in the long term if the two guide walls are connected to each other by a web at the one end section of the housing part.<br>
In order to avoid installation errors when fitting the blocking element in the housing part, the housing part has means for ensuring a defined operating movement for the blocking element, which is situated at a distance from the wiper strip.<br>
These means can be formed in a cost-effective manner by at least one strip-like projection on the inside of a guide  wall,  the  said  projection  extending  in  the<br><br>
direction of the operating movement of the blocking element and being assigned a longitudinal groove, which is co-ordinated with the cross section cf the projection, on that side cheek of the blocking element which faces the projection.<br>
In order to secure the blocking element in the housing part, a boundary shoulder pointing counter to the operating direction is arranged on the said housing part and interacts with a mating shoulder situated on the blocking element,<br>
A further means for obtaining play-free guidance of the wiper blade on the wiper arm can be achieved in that the wiper blade has, at least in the ■ region of the hinge pin, two cheeks which are spaced apart from each other, are arranged parallel- to each other, are arranged upright with respect to the window and on which the ends of the wiper arm are secured, the distance between the two cheeks being co-ordinated with the width of the coupling part. The two cheeks therefore engage extensively and in a manner free from play over the mutually remote outer sides of the two guide walls.<br>
A wiper blade which is of particularly low and lightweight construction is achieved if the coupling part is held against the upper constructional fsic] surface, which faces away from the window, of a spring-elastic supporting element elongated in a band-like manner, the said coupling part bearing, at least over a subsection, flat against the said surface, and if, furthermore, a rubber-elastic wiper strip which can be placed against the window is - arranged parallel to the longitudinal axis on the lower band surface of the supporting element, which surface faces the window*<br>
Further advantageous developments and refinements of<br><br>
the invention are specified in the following description of exemplary embodiments illustrated in the associated drawing.<br>

Description of the exemplary embodiment<br>
A wiping device 10 illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 has a<br><br>
wiper blade 12 having a spring-elastic supporting element 14 elongated in a band-like manner. A connecting device 18, which bears .flat against the supporting element, is arranged on the upper band surface 13 of the supporting element,, which surface faces away from the window 16 to be wiped, and with the aid of the said connecting device the wiper blade 12 can be connected detachably to a driven wiper arm 20 which is guided at one end on the bodywork of a motor vehicle and belongs to the wiping device. An elongated, rubber-elastic wiper strip 22 is arranged parallel to the longitudinal axis on the lower band surface 15 of the supporting element 14, which surface faces the window 16. A hinge pin 24, which serves as coupling means on the arm side, is held on the free end 21 of the wiper arm 20 and is mounted in a bearing holder of a coupling part 2 6 on the wiper-blade side. The free end of the wiper arm 20 is loaded in the direction of the arrow 30 towards the window 16 which is to be wiped and whose surface which is to wiped is indicated in Figure 1 by a dash-dotted line 28. Since the dash-dotted line 28 is intended to depict the sharpest curvature of the window surface, it is clearly apparent that the curvature of the wiper blade 12 bearing with its two ends against the window is sharper than the maximum curvature of the window. Under the press-on pressure (arrow 30) the wiper blade is positioned over its entire length by means of its wiper lip 32 against the window surface 28. In the process, a stress is built up in the band-like, spring-elastic supporting element 14, the said stress ensuring that the wiper strip 22, or the wiper lip 32, bears correctly over its entire length against the motor-vehicle window 16 * A wiper-blade supporting-bracket frame which has long been known (DE-PS 15 05 397) is rendered superfluous by the use of the supporting element 14.<br>
In the following,  the special design of the wiping<br><br>
device 10 according to the invention will be discussed in greater detail. The coupling part 26 of the connecting device 18, which part is on the wiper-blade side, is of two-part construction. It firstly has a housing part 34 (Figures 13 and 14) 'with two guide walls 36 and 38 which extend in the longitudinal direction of the wiper blade 12, are arranged parallel and at a distance from each other and are connected to each other at their one end section by a bridge-like web 40, which ensures the stability of the housing part. The two mutually facing inner sides of the guide walls 36, 38 form guide surfaces for a slide-like blocking element 42 (Figures 11 and 12) which likewise belongs to the coupling part 26. In order to ensure a defined operating movement for the blocking slide 42, a strip-like projection 44 extending in the longitudinal direction of the wiper blade is arranged on each of the mutually facing inner sides of the guide walls 36 and 38. In order to ensure a defined operation movement, the strip-like projections 4 4 are assigned longitudinal grooves 4 6 which are present on the blocking slide 4 2 and are coordinated with the cross section of the projections 44. The slide-like blocking element 42 can therefore be displaced between the guide walls 36 and 38 in a play-free manner in the longitudinal direction of the wiper blade. In order to secure the blocking slide 42 in the housing part 34, a boundary shoulder 4 8 pointing counter to the operating movement is arranged on each of the two projections 44. The two boundary shoulders 4 8 interact, with the effect of restricting the operating movement, with mating shoulders 50 arranged on the blocking slide, in longitudinal grooves thereof. On the end section of the housing part 34, which section is provided with the web 40, the said part is provided with an end wall 52, the inner side 54 of which faces the boundary shoulders 48 at a distance. A helical compression spring 56 is supported in a prestressed manner on the inner slide 54  (Figures 4<br><br>
and 9) and pushes the blocking slide 42, which is fitted into the housing part 34, in the direction of the arrow 58 (Figure 9) , the boundary shoulders 48 intercepting the blocking slide 42 at the mating shoulders 50 thereof when the said slide has reached its blocking position. In the process, the helical compression spring 56 is still under a slight prestress. In an operating position of the connecting device 18, which is shown in Figure 4, the boundary shoulders 48 are at a short distance from the mating shoulders 50. This means that the blocking slide 42, which is used as blocking element, is moved slightly in the direction of the arrow 60 (Figure 4) counter to the operating direction of the helical compression spring 56. In this operating position, the coupling part 26 is penetrated transversely with respect to the direction of movement of the blocking slide 42 by a hole-type bearing holder for the hinge pin 24. The bearing holder 62 therefore penetrates both guide walls 36, 38 and the blocking slide 42. For better comprehension, the hinge pin 24 has been sketched in section in Figure 4. The shaped-out portions arising in the process in the guide walls 36, 38 are completed by the shaped-out portion 66 arising in the blocking slide 42, in the blocking position thereof, approximately to form a circle which is matched to the cross section of the hinge pin. In order for it to be possible for the blocking slide to be brought from its operating position illustrated in Figure 4 in the direction of the arrow 60 into an opening position (Figure 5), it is provided with a cutout 68 on its side lying opposite the shaped-out portion 66. The cutout is selected to be large enough to form a through-channel section for the hinge pin. Similarly, the shaped-out portions 64 in the guide walls 36, 38 are opened in a funnel-like manner via through-channel sections 70 (Figure 13). The width of the through-channel sections is selected in such a manner that the hinge pin 24 can be introduced without<br><br>
any problem in the direction of the arrow 72 (Figure 13) into the shaped-out portions 64 on the wall side (Figure 13) in the direction of the arrow 7 2 [sic]. The correspondingly dimensioned cut-out 68 in the blocking slide 42 enables the hinge pin 24 likewise to pass without any problem into the bearing shaped-out portion 66 in the blocking slide 42 (Figure 11). However, this is only possible when the blocking slide 4 2 is brought counter to the stressing force of the helical compression spring 56 in the direction of the arrow 60 (Figure 5) [lacuna] its opening position illustrated in Figure 5. In this opening position, a through-channel 71 is produced for the hinge pin, the said channel extending over the entire width of the housing part together with the blocking slide 42 guided therein. The bearing-holder sections which are formed in this manner, are arranged one behind another in the direction of the axis of the hinge pin 24 and are formed by the shaped-out portions 64 and 66 in the housing part 26 and by the cutout 68, 69 in the blocking slide 42, are therefore open towards that side of the coupling part 2 6 which faces away from the window. In this case, the width of each section is greater than the diameter of the hinge pin. The shaped-out portion 66 in the blocking slide 42 is provided with a run-on slope 7 4 which is spaced apart opposite the shaped-out portion 66 and encloses an acute angle a with the displacement direction of the blocking element (Figure 8) .<br>
It can be seen from Figures 2 and 3 that the coupling part 26 of the connecting device 18, which part is on the wiper-blade side, sits on the upper band surface 13 of the supporting element 14 and is connected to the supporting element 14. The supporting element 14 has, in the region of the section line III-III, two spring rails 80 which hold the wiper strip, lie at a distance from each other and are arranged parallel to each other<br><br>
and the inner edges of which enter into longitudinal grooves of the wiper strip 22 and the outer edges of which are held by longitudinal grooves 82 present in the guide walls 36 and 38. In this case, the wiper strip 22 is arranged in such a manner that it does not bear against the blocking slide 42 and effect the latter in its operating movement. As can be seen from Figure 2, the wiper arm 20 has a U-shaped cross section at its free end 21. It therefore has two cheeks which are arranged at a distance from each other and parallel to each other and are arranged upright with respect to the window. The two ends of the hinge pin 24 are secured on the cheeks 84, The distance 83 between the mutually facing inner sides of the cheeks 8 4 is coordinated with the width 85 of the housing part 34 in such a manner that the cheeks 84 engage over the outer sides of the guide walls 36, 38 in a manner free from play. Excellent lateral guidance for the wiper blade on the wiper arm is therefore produced when the wiping device 10 is moved in the direction of the double arrow 88 (Figure 2) over the window to be wiped.<br>
An alternative to the arrangement of a helical compression spring already described is illustrated in Figures 6 and 7, Since this other embodiment differs from the embodiment described with reference to Figures 4 and 5 only through the design of the spring means, the reference numbers already used previously for the blocking slide are adopted here. The coupling part 12 6 according to Figures 6 and 7 likewise has a housing part 134 and a blocking slide 42 having the corresponding bearing holders 62, through-channels 71 and cutouts. Similarly, the blocking slide 42 has a cutout 68 with the run-on -slope 7.4. However, the housing part 134 is produced from a flexible plastic. A leg spring 156 which takes on the function of rhe helical compression spring 56 in the case of the embodiment according to Figures 4 and 5 is integrally<br><br>
formed on the web connecting the two guide walls 36 and 38. The leg spring 156 is coordinated in such a manner that it still bears with prestress against the blocking slide 4 2 in the operating position (blocking position) illustrated in Figure 6, If the blocking slide 42 is displaced in the direction of the arrow 60 and brought [lacuna] its opening position illustrated in Figure 7, the increasing stress causes the leg spring 56 to be deflected, with the result that the blocking slide 42 releases the through-channel sections.<br>
In addition to the further described features, the wiping ■ device 10 according to the invention therefore has a hole-type bearing holder 62 for the hinge pin 24, the bearing holder being open at the edge via a through-channel 71 orientated along its circumferential surface in the direction of the hole axis. The through-channel is divided into three different sections, one section 7 0 being situated in each case in the guide walls 36, 38 and a third section 68, 69 being present in the blocking slide 42. The through-channel sections in the two guide walls 36 and 38 have, in the region of the bearing holder 62, a width 90 (Figure 8) which is somewhat greater than the diameter 92 of the hinge pin 24.<br>
When the loose wiper blade 12 is to be connected to the wiper arm 20, the latter is brought into the position illustrated in Figure 2. The wiper blade is subsequently moved upwards towards the hinge pin 24, the funnel-like shaped-out portion 64 in the guide walls 36, 38 together with the cheeks 84 of the wiper-arm end 21, which cheeks slide along the outer sides of the guide walls in the direction of the arrow 72 (Figure 8), providing a very good installation aid. During this installation movement the blocking slide 42 is displaced by the hinge pin 24 in the direction of the arrow 60 - increasing the stress of spring means 56<br><br>
or 156 - until the hinge pin 24 passes into its bearing holder 62 - formed by the shaped-out portions 64 and 66 (opening position). The blocking slide then snaps under the effect of the spring means 56 or 156, which are now considerably prestressed, into its operating position illustrated in Figure 4. With the upper edge 67 of its shaped-out portion 66, the blocking slide 42 constricts the through-channel to a narrow point 94 (Figure 4) , the width of which is smaller than the diameter of the hinge pin 24, with the result that the wiper blade 12 can no longer be detached from the wiper arm 20 (blocking position) , The hinge pin is then virtually enclosed by parts of the coupling part 24,<br>
In order to detach the wiper blade 12 from the wiper arm 20, the blocking slide 42 has to be moved in the direction of the arrow 60 with elastic expansion of the narrow point 94, the run-on slope 74 of the blocking slide 42 striking it against the hinge pin 24 and lifting the latter out of its bearing holder 62, as is illustrated in Figure 8. As Figure 8 further shows, in this position the narrow point 94 has already been expanded in such a manner that its width 90 is already somewhat greater than the diameter 92 of the hinge pin 24 (opening position). The wiper blade can subsequently be readily detached from the hinge pin, and therefore from the wiper arm, counter to the direction of the arrow 72. The wiping device is, therefore distinguished in that, in order to form the narrow point 94, the coupling part 2 6 is provided with a separate blocking element 42 which can be brought counter to a restoring force (arrow 96) from its blocking position blocking the through-channel - which corresponds to the operating position - into an opening position releasing the through-channel (Figures 5 and 8),<br><br><br><br><br>
