				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SWTTCHING<br>
FLOW CIRCUITS IN A PRODUCT DISPENSER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to product dispensing equipment and, more<br>
particularly, but not by way of limitation, to methods and an apparatus for switching from a<br>
first fluid line to a second fluid line without depressurizing the complete fluid system.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Historically, the beverage dispensing industry revolved around the reconstitution of<br>
syrup concentrates with carbonated water. Consumers often were offered a multitude of<br>
soda flavors with a single non-carbonated option in a beverage dispenser. With changing<br>
philosophies in the areas of health and nutrition, product dispensing suppliers have been<br>
forced to offer a wider variety of products through basically the same interface, a beverage<br>
dispenser. Presently, it is common to see beverage dispensers delivering multiple non-<br>
carbonated beverages, such as lemonades, teas, sports drinks, and the like.<br>
This changing trend has caused some challenges, as the life expectancy of a<br>
beverage dispenser is approximately seven to ten years. Many times older dispensers are<br>
not outfitted with product and diluent lines for every possible product valve combination.<br>
While newer beverage dispenser designs do take into consideration the possibility of<br>
switching between diluents, switching across two media paths provides the possibility of a<br>
leak across the switching mechanism, and a compromised mixture upon dispensing.<br>
Similar considerations arise when switching from a chilled product to an ambient<br>
product, or the opposite. When utilizing a cold plate to chill product lines in a beverage<br>
dispenser, manufacturers are forced to commit fluid media flow paths to delivering either a<br>
chilled fluid or an unchilled fluid. Further, fluid lines must be committed to delivering<br>
either a carbonated fluid or an uncarbonated fluid. As the allocation of fluid paths is<br>
somewhat inflexible, changing of a product valve to deliver a chilled drink instead of an<br>
ambient drink, or a carbonated drink instead of an uncarbonated drink, may be difficult, or<br>
simply impossible. In most cases, the entire pressure system of the product fluids must be<br>
depressurized to manipulate product lines.<br>
Accordingly, an apparatus that provides some flexibility in allowing customers to<br>
reconfigure the product valves of a product dispenser to deliver either chilled or ambient<br>
products on location without depressurizing the entire system would be beneficial to<br><br>
dispenser manufacturers, dispenser owners, as well as the producers of the product<br>
concentrates.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a switch over device provides a product<br>
dispenser with the capability to switch from delivering fluid from a first diluent flow circuit<br>
to a second diluent flow circuit for mixing with a concentrate. The switch over device<br>
includes a manifold having a first diluent inlet and a second diluent inlet in communication<br>
with a diluent outlet, and a concentrate inlet in communication with a concentrate outlet.<br>
The switch over device further includes a first stem assembly disposed in a first bore, and a<br>
second stem assembly in a second bore, wherein the first and second stem assemblies are<br>
biased to a first position that interrupts flow from the first and second diluent inlets to the<br>
diluent outlet. In a second position, the first and second stem assemblies permit fluid to<br>
flow from the first and second diluent inlets to the diluent outlet. The switch over device is<br>
mountable to a. housing of a product dispenser, and may support a product dispensing valve.<br>
The switch over device further includes actuators that enable an operator to easily switch<br>
from the one flow circuit to the other. The actuators include a first engagement face and a<br>
second engagement face, wherein the first and second stem assemblies are in me first<br>
position when the first engagement face contacts the manifold, and further wherein, the first<br>
and second stem assemblies are in the second position when the second engagement faces<br>
are adjacent to the manifold. Accordingly, a product dispensing valve circuit may be<br>
changed from utilizing the first diluent circuit to utilizing the second diluent circuit without<br>
depressurizing the entire product dispenser.<br>
The first diluent flow circuit and the second diluent flow circuit may deliver<br>
virtually any type of diluent, and diluent temperatures, including ambient diluents, chilled<br>
diluents, and carbonated diluents. The switch over device may also be used to deliver<br>
product concentrates, and full strength products to expand a product offering of a product<br>
dispenser. In an extension of the preferred embodiment, the switch over device is remotely<br>
activated.<br>
It is therefore an object of die present invention to provide a switch over device that<br>
permits the selection between multiple flow circuits of a product dispenser.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a product dispenser utilizing<br>
the switch over device, whereby a product valve may be switched from a first diluent flow<br>
circuit to a second diluent flow circuit.<br><br>
It is still further an object of the present invention to provide a remotely activated<br>
switch over device, thereby enabling the product dispenser to be controlled from a<br>
command center.<br>
It is still yet further an object of the present invention to provide a product dispenser<br>
that is able to switch between ambient diluents, chilled diluents, and carbonated diluents.<br>
Still other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become<br>
evident to those of ordinary skill in the art in light of the following. Also, it should be<br>
understood that the scope of this invention is intended to be broad, and any combination of<br>
any subset of the features, elements, or steps described herein is part of the intended scope<br>
of the invention.<br>

embodiment the second diluent flow circuit 121 further passes through a carbonator 150 that<br>
may be disposed within the cold plate 116, thereby further carbonating the fluid disposed<br>
within the second diluent line 151. In this first embodiment, the inlet 152 of the second<br>
diluent flow circuit 121 is in fluid communication with a second pressurized diluent source,<br>
whereby the diluent moves from the inlet 152 to the outlet 153.<br>
The concentrate flow circuit 122 includes a concentrate line 140 having an inlet 141<br>
and an outlet 142. The concentrate line 140 includes coils that are disposed within the cold<br><br>
plate 116, whereby the fluid disposed within the concentrate line 140 is chilled while it<br>
passes through the cold plate 116. In this first embodiment, the concentrate line 140 is in<br>
fluid communication with a concentrate source.<br>
Assembly of the switch over device 103 commences with the assembly of the first<br>
and second stem assemblies 173 and 174. A seal 213 is permanently secured to the second<br>
end 217 of the first stem 208. Assembly continues with the installation of an o-ring 214<br>
into the o-ring groove 210. Next the spring 220 is placed over the first stem 208, and is<br>
lowered until it bottoms out on the flange 212. An o-ring 222 is then installed into the<br>
groove 224 of the bushing 221. The bushing 221 is then placed over the first stem 208, and<br>
forced downward against the spring 220 pressure. The first stem assembly 173 is then<br>
inserted through the first stem aperture 234 of the restraint bracket 219, such that the flange<br>
233 faces away from the first stem assembly 173. Assembly continues with the alignment<br>
of the stem assembly 173 such that the pivot aperture 215 is perpendicular to the flange 233.<br>
The first actuator 240 is then placed over the first end 216 of the first stem 208 such<br>
that the second engagement face 251 is nearest the planar face 232 and a midplane of the<br>
restraint bracket 219. The first end 216 is disposed between the first leg 247 and the second<br>
leg 248. The pivot aperture 215 of the first stem 208 may then be aligned with the first and<br>
second pivot apertures 253 and 254 of the first actuator 240. Once aligned, the first restraint<br>
pin 242 is inserted through the pivot apertures 253, 254, and 215. Once inserted, the first<br>
stem assembly 173 is permanently affixed to the restraint bracket 219. The first actuator<br>
240 may then be pivoted toward the first engagement face 250 about the first restraint pin<br>
242 to move the first engagement face 250 onto the planar face 232 of the restraint bracket<br>
219.<br>
The second stem assembly 174 may be assembled in a manner similar to the first<br>
stem assembly 173, however, the second actuator 241 will be positioned in a direction<br>
opposite to that of the first actuator 240. Once the stem assemblies 173 and 174 have been<br>
assembled onto the restraint bracket 219, the stem control assembly 199 may be attached to<br>
the manifold 170. Attachment commences with the insertion of the second end 217 of the<br>
first stem 208 into the first bore 191, and the insertion of the second end of the second stem<br>
223 into the second bore 192. The stem control assembly 199 is then fully inserted into the<br>
bores 191 and 192, and the fasteners 207 are inserted into the mounting holes 189 in the<br>
manifold 170. The insertion of the stem assembly 173 into the first bore 19 creates a closed<br>
chamber in the first bore 191, as the bushing o-ring 222 creates a seal between the bushing<br>
221 and an inner periphery of the first bore 191, and the o-ring 214 creates a seal between<br><br>
the first stem 208 and the inner periphery 231 of the bushing 221. Further, when the first<br>
engagement face 250 of the first actuator 240 is against the planar face 232 of the restraint<br>
bracket 219, the spring 220 forces the first stem 208 downward such that the seal 213 covers<br>
the outlet 196 leading to die outlet chamber 193. In this first position, the first diluent flow<br>
circuit 120 ends in the first bore 191.<br>
Similarly to the first bore 191, the insertion of the second stem assembly 174 into<br>
the second bore 192 creates a closed chamber in second bore 192. With the first<br>
engagement face 250 of the second actuator 241 mated to the planar face 232 of the restraint<br>
bracket 219, the second spring 226 forces the second stem 223 downward such that the<br>
second seal 229 covers the second outlet 198. In this position, the second diluent flow<br>
circuit 121 ends in the second bore 192.<br>
Assembly of the "product dispenser 100 commences with a cold plate 116 including<br>
the first diluent line 146, the second diluent line 151, and the concentrate line 140 being<br>
placed into the frame assembly 112. The liner 118 is then placed into the frame assembly<br>
118 above the cold plate 116, thereby forming the storage chamber 117. The build up<br>
continues with the application of insulation to the outer surfaces of the liner 118, thereby<br>
providing insulative properties to the liner 118 and the storage chamber 117. The switch<br>
over device 103 may then be installed onto the faucet plate 124 by inserting the diluent<br>
outlet 161 through the diluent line alignment aperture 129, and the concentrate outlet 160<br>
through the concentrate line alignment aperture 128. Once diluent outlet 161 and the<br>
concentrate outlet 160 are through the apertures 128 and 129, the switch over device 103<br>
may be moved downward to lock the diluent outlet 161 and the concentrate outlet 160 into<br>
the reduced width slots, thereby locking the switch over device 103 in place.<br>
At this point, the outlet 148 of the first diluent line 146 may be inserted into the first<br>
diluent inlet 202 of the switch over device 103, thereby extending the first diluent flow<br>
circuit 120 through to the first bore 191. The outlet 153 of the second diluent line 151 is<br>
then inserted into the second diluent inlet 203 of the switch over device 103, thereby<br>
extending the second diluent flow circuit 121 through to the second bore 192. Finally, the<br>
outlet 142 of the concentrate line 140 may be inserted into the concentrate inlet 201 of the<br>
switch over device 103, thereby extending the concentrate flow circuit 122 through to the<br>
concentrate passage 194 of the switch over device 103.<br>
The body 130 of the product valve 105 may then be installed onto the faucet plate<br>
124, such that the diluent inlet 132 of the body 130 connects with the diluent outlet 161 of<br>
the switch over device 103, and the concentrate outlet 131 of the body 130 mates with the<br><br>
concentrate outlet 160 of the switch over device 103. Once aligned and mated with the<br>
outlets 160 and 161, mounting screws 137 may be inserted through the mounting apertures<br>
144 of the body 130. The mounting screws 137 extend through the body 130, the valve<br>
mounting apertures 126 of the faucet plate 124, and partially through the mounting<br>
apertures 204 of the manifold 170. Mounting nuts 138 are then disposed in depressions 139<br>
of the manifold 170, such that the mounting screws 137 engage the mounting nuts 139 to<br>
secure the product valve 105 to the switch over device 103 and the faucet plate 124. The<br>
cover 136 may then be installed onto the product valve 105.<br>
The frame assembly 112 may further be closed out by installing the wrapper 111, the<br>
lid 135, the drip tray 107, and the splash plate 109. Assembly of the product dispenser 100<br>
continues with the installation of the marquis 101 and the cup rest 108.<br>
On final assembly, with the actuators in a lowered or closed position, the first<br>
diluent flow circuit 120 is defined by the first diluent line 146, the first diluent inlet 202, and<br>
the first bore 191, and the second diluent flow circuit 121 is defined by the second diluent<br>
line 151, the second diluent inlet 203, and the second bore 192.<br>
In operation, the first or second diluent flow circuits 120 or 121 may be extended to<br>
the product valve 105 by rotating the first actuator 240 or the second actuator 241 about the<br>
applicable restraint pin 242 or 243 to raise a respective stem assembly 173 or 174. Rotation<br>
of an actuator 240 or 241 such that the second engagement face 251 is adjacent to the planar<br>
face 232 of the restraint bracket 219 raises the respective stem assembly 173 or 174, and<br>
moves the seal 213 or 229 away from the outlet 196 or 198. Upon the seal 213 or 229 being<br>
removed from the outlet 196 or 198, the respective bore 191 or 192, is in fluid<br>
communication with outlet chamber 193. Upon the first actuator 240 being raised to an<br>
open position, the first diluent flow circuit 120 is extended, and includes the first diluent<br>
line 146, the first diluent inlet 202, the first bore 191, the outlet chamber 193, the diluent<br>
outlet 161, and the valve diluent inlet 132 for delivery through the nozzle 113. In this<br>
embodiment, the first diluent flow circuit 120 passes through the cold plate 116 for<br>
conditioning.<br>
Alternatively, the raising of the second actuator 241 to the open position extends the<br>
second diluent flow circuit 121, and includes second diluent line 151, the second diluent<br>
inlet 203, the second bore 192, the outlet chamber 193, the diluent outlet 161, and the valve<br>
diluent inlet 132 for delivery through the nozzle 113. In this embodiment, the second<br>
diluent flow circuit 121 passes through a carbonator and a cold plate 116 for conditioning.<br><br>
In this first embodiment the concentrate flow circuit 122 is coupled to a concentrate<br>
source, and includes the concentrate line 140, the concentrate inlet 201, the concentrate<br>
passage 194, the concentrate outlet 160, and the concentrate inlet 131 of the product valve<br>
105 for delivery through the nozzle 113. The concentrate flow circuit 122 passes through<br>
the switch over device 103 uninhibited, as the concentrate passage 194 does not include<br>
shutoffs.<br>
The actuators 140 and 141 are designed such, that only one actuator 140 or 141 may<br>
be in the open position at a time, thereby ensuring that a mixture of the fluids in the first<br>
diluent flow circuit 120 and the second diluent flow circuit 121 do not simultaneously<br>
deliver fluid to the outlet chamber 193, and into an operator's cup. The "or" condition is<br>
dictated by an actuator 140 or 141 in an open position extending into the path of an<br>
additional actuator attempting to rotate into the open position. Accordingly, three distinct<br>
flows may be delivered in this first embodiment. Illustratively, a combination of a chilled<br>
diluent with a concentrate may be delivered to the valve, or a combination of a carbonated<br>
and chilled diluent with a concentrate may be delivered to the product valve 105, or only a<br>
concentrate may be delivered to the valve 105 if both actuators 240 and 241 are in a closed<br>
position. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that concentrate, in this disclosure<br>
includes both single strength products, concentrated products, and the like.<br>
In use, an operator may switch the product dispenser 100 from utilizing the first<br>
diluent flow circuit 120 in conjunction with the concentrate flow circuit 122 to utilizing the<br>
second diluent flow circuit 121 with the concentrate flow circuit 122 without depressurizing<br>
the entire product dispenser 100. As shown in the method flow chart of Figure 5, the<br>
process commences with step 10, wherein the operator must access the switch over device<br>
103 by either rotating or removing the cover of the product valve 105, or rotating or<br>
removing the marquis 101. Once accessed, the operator must rotate the first actuator 240 to<br>
the first position, wherein the first engagement face 250 is adjacent to the planar face 232 of<br>
the restraint bracket 219, step 20. Upon rotation of the first actuator 240 to the first<br>
position, the first bore 191 is separated from the outlet chamber 193, thereby removing the<br>
outlet chamber 193 and all the fluid paths beyond the outlet chamber 193 from the first<br>
diluent flow circuit 120. Next, the operator must rotate the second actuator 241 from the<br>
first position to the second position, such that second engagement face 251 is adjacent to the<br>
planar face 232 of the restraint bracket 219, as shown in step 30. With the second actuator<br>
241 in the second position, the second bore 192 is connected to the outlet chamber 193, and<br>
the second diluent flow circuit 121 is extended to include the outlet chamber 193, the<br><br>
diluent outlet 161, the diluent inlet 132 to deliver fluid through the nozzle 113 when the<br>
valve actuator 106 is activated. The process continues with step 40, wherein the operator<br>
must purge the newly connected product line, thereby ensuring delivery of a homogeneous<br>
dispense.<br>
In a second embodiment, a product dispenser 300 is substantially identical to the<br>
product dispenser 100, and accordingly, like parts have been annotated with like numerals.<br>
However, the first and second diluent flow circuits 120 and 121 of the product dispenser<br>
100 have been replaced with a first diluent flow circuit 320 that delivers a carbonated and<br>
chilled fluid, and a second flow circuit 321 that delivers an unconditioned fluid to the switch<br>
over device 103 for delivery to the product valve 105.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, the product dispenser 300 includes the first diluent flow<br>
circuit 320, the second diluent flow circuit 321, and the concentrate flow circuit 122. The<br>
first diluent flow circuit 320 includes a first diluent line 346 having an inlet 347 and an<br>
outlet 348. The first diluent line 346 passes through the cold plate 116 and the carbonator<br>
150, such that fluid disposed within the first diluent line 346 is conditioned as it passes<br>
through the cold plate 116 and the carbonator 150. The outlet 348 of the first diluent line<br>
346 connects to the first diluent inlet 202 of the switch over device 103, such that any fluid<br>
disposed within the first diluent line 346 may be delivered to the first diluent inlet 202 and<br>
the first bore 191.<br>
The second diluent flow circuit 321 includes a second diluent line 351 having an<br>
inlet 352 and an outlet 353. The second diluent line 351 does not pass through the<br>
carbonator or the cold plate 116, and therefore, is not conditioned. The inlet 352 of the<br>
second diluent line 351 is coupled to a diluent source, and the outlet 353 is coupled to the<br>
second diluent inlet 203 of the switch over device 103. As such, a fluid disposed within the<br>
second diluent line 351 may be delivered from the diluent source to the second diluent inlet<br>
203 and the second bore 192.<br>
The concentrate flow circuit 122 of this second embodiment is identical to the<br>
concentrate flow circuit 122 of the first embodiment, and includes a concentrate line 140<br>
having an inlet 141 and an outlet 142. The first concentrate line 140 passes through the cold<br>
plate 116 for conditioning. The inlet 141 of the first diluent line 146 is coupled to a<br>
concentrate source, and the outlet of the concentrate line 140 is coupled to the concentrate<br>
inlet 201 of the switch over device 103. Accordingly, the concentrate flow circuit 122<br>
delivers a conditioned fluid to the concentrate passage 194 of switch over device 103.<br><br>
In use, the product dispenser 300 may utilize a diluent from the first diluent flow<br>
circuit 320 when the first actuator 240 is in the second position, or from the second diluent<br>
flow circuit 321 when the second actuator 241 is in the second position. The product<br>
dispenser 300 is therefore able to deliver a chilled and carbonated diluent in combination<br>
with a chilled concentrate, or an ambient, uncarbonated diluent in combination with the<br>
chilled concentrate.<br>
In a third embodiment, a product dispenser 350 is substantially identical to the<br>
product dispensers 100 and 300, and accordingly, like parts have been annotated with like<br>
numerals. However, the first and second diluent flow circuits of the product dispensers<br>
have been replaced with a first diluent flow circuit 420 that delivers an uncarbonated and<br>
chilled fluid, and a second flow circuit 421 that delivers an unconditioned fluid to the switch<br>
over device 103 for delivery to the product valve 105.<br>
As shown in Figure 7, the product dispenser 350 includes the first diluent flow<br>
circuit 420, the second diluent flow circuit 421, and the concentrate flow circuit 122. The<br>
first diluent flow circuit 420 includes a first diluent line 366 having an inlet 367 and an<br>
outlet 368. The first diluent line 366 passes through the cold plate 116, such that fluid<br>
disposed within the first diluent line 366 is conditioned as it passes through the cold plate<br>
116. The outlet 368 of the first diluent line 366 connects to the first diluent inlet 202 of the<br>
switch over device 103, such that any fluid disposed within the first diluent line 366 may be<br>
delivered to the first diluent inlet 202 and the first bore 191.<br>
The second diluent flow circuit 421 includes a second diluent line 371 having an<br>
inlet 372 and an outlet 373. The second diluent line 371 does not pass through the<br>
carbonator or the cold plate 116, and therefore, is not conditioned. The inlet 372 of the<br>
second diluent line 371 is coupled to a diluent source, and the outlet 373 is coupled to the<br>
second diluent inlet 203 of the switch over device 103. As such, a fluid disposed within the<br>
second diluent line 371 may be delivered from the diluent source to the second diluent inlet<br>
203 and the second bore 192.<br>
The concentrate flow circuit 122 of this third embodiment is identical to the<br>
concentrate flow circuit 122 of the first and second embodiments, and includes a<br>
concentrate line 140 having an inlet 141 and an outlet 142. The first concentrate line 140<br>
passes through the cold plate 116 for conditioning. The inlet 141 of the first diluent line<br>
146 is coupled to a concentrate source, and the outlet of the concentrate line 140 is coupled<br>
to the concentrate inlet 201 of the switch over device 103. Accordingly, the concentrate<br><br>
flow circuit 122 delivers a conditioned fluid to the concentrate passage 194 of switch over<br>
device 103.<br>
In use, the product dispenser 350 may utilize a diluent from the first diluent flow<br>
circuit 420 when the first actuator 240 is in die second position, or from the second diluent<br>
flow circuit 421 when the second actuator 241 is in the second position. The product<br>
dispenser 350 is therefore able to deliver a chilled diluent in combination with a chilled<br>
concentrate, or an ambient, uncarbonated diluent in combination with the chilled<br>
concentrate.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the first and second flow circuits<br>
from the first, second, and third embodiments may be utilized in conjunction with each<br>
other when more than one product valve 105 is utilized on a product dispenser.<br>
Accordingly, multiple product valves 105 may be utilized with multiple switch over devices<br>
103 to deliver varying types of diluents to a respective product valve 105. One of ordinary<br>
skill in the art will further recognize that the use of switch over devices 103 on a product<br>
dispenser 100 is not limited to diluent flow circuits. Concentrate flow circuits may also<br>
utilize a switch over device 103 to expand the product offerings of the product dispenser<br>
100, thereby providing the ability to switch between chilled and ambient concentrate flow<br>
circuits.<br>
In a fourth embodiment, a product dispenser 400 is substantially identical to the<br>
product dispensers 100, 300, and 350, however, the product dispenser 400 further includes a<br>
control system 410 that remotely activates a switch over device 403. As shown in Figure<br>
8a-b, the product dispenser 400 includes the first diluent circuit 120, the second diluent<br>
circuit 121, and the concentrate circuit 122. The control system 410 includes a controller<br>
419, an input device 408, an output device 411, a first solenoid 404, a second solenoid 405,<br>
a first adapter 406, and a second adapter 407.<br>
The switch over device 403 is identical to the switch over device 103, however, the<br>
first actuators 240 is replaced with the first adapter 406, and the second actuator 241 is<br>
replaced with the second adapter 407. The first adapter 406 includes a planar body 422, a<br>
first leg 423, and a second leg 424. The first leg 423 and the second leg 424 lie parallel to<br>
each other, and are perpendicular to the planar body 422, such that the legs 423 and 424 and<br>
the body 422 form a u-shape. Each leg includes an aperture 425 for receiving the restraint<br>
pin 242 or 243. The planar body 422 includes an aperture 426 for connection to the<br>
solenoids 404 or 405.<br><br>
The first solenoid 404 includes a shaft that fastens to the aperture 426 of the planar<br>
body 422 of a respective first or second adapter 406 or 407. The shaft may be secured to<br>
the adapter 406 utilizing any known method, including threads, e-clips, fasteners, and the<br>
like. The first solenoid 404 is further secured to the housing 110 of the product dispenser<br>
400, such that the first solenoid 404 pulls the shaft through first solenoid 404 when<br>
activated. The second solenoid 405 is identical to the first solenoid 405, and is similarly<br>
secured. The input device 408 may be any form of device capable of receiving a signal or<br>
selection command from an operator, including, LCD panels, pushbuttons, or the like. The<br>
output device 411 may be any form of signal output device, including readable text on an<br>
LCD screen, audio devices, and the like, wherein the controller 419 is able to output a signal<br>
to an operator.<br>
The controller 419 is a microprocessor based controller, and is in electrical<br>
communication with the first solenoid 404, the second solenoid 405, the output device 411,<br>
and the input device 408, such that signals may be received from an operator through the<br>
input device 408, and processed to effect a switch from a flow circuit in use to a different<br>
flow circuit.<br>
Assembly of the switch over device 403 is substantially identical to the switch over<br>
device 103, however, the actuators 240 and 241 are replaced with the first adapter 405 and<br>
the second adapter 406. The first and second stem assemblies 173 and 174 are still oriented<br>
in the same direction, and the restraint pins 242 and 243 are placed through the aligned<br>
apertures 406 and the pivot aperture 215. Once connected the switch over device 403 may<br>
be mounted to the product dispenser 400. Once secured to the product dispenser 400, the<br>
first and second solenoids 404 and 405 may be secured to the housing 110, and then secured<br>
to the respective adapters 406 or 407.<br>
Upon full assembly, the solenoids 404 and 405 each include two positions, a<br>
position equivalent to the first position of the product dispenser 100, and the second<br>
position of the product dispenser 100. As previously disclosed, the first position of the<br>
switch over device 103 provides for the stem assemblies 173 and 174 being forced<br>
downward by the springs 220 and 226, thereby forcing the first seal 213 to face off on and<br>
cover the first outlet 196, and the second seal 229 to face off on and cover the second outlet<br>
198, thereby ceasing the flow of fluid through the first and second outlets 196 and 198. In<br>
this fourth embodiment, the first position is coincident with the solenoids 404 and 405 not<br>
being activated.<br><br>
In the second position, coincident with a single solenoid 404 or 405 being activated,<br>
a single stem assembly 173 or 174 is raised to move the respective seal 213 or 229 off of the<br>
first or second outlet 196 or 198, thereby extending the flow circuit to the product valve<br>
105. Accordingly, activating the first solenoid 404 extends the first diluent circuit 120 to<br>
the product valve 105, and activating the second solenoid 405 extends the second diluent<br>
circuit 121 to the product valve 105. As shown in the first embodiment, only a single<br>
diluent flow circuit should be extended at a time, as the extension of both diluent flow<br>
circuits 120 and 121 will lead to a non homogenous dispense. As such, the controller 419<br>
must ensure that only one diluent flow circuit 120 or 121 is extended at a time. <br>
Figure 8c provides a method flowchart illustrating the steps of changing from a<br>
current fluid flow circuit to an alternate flow circuit according to the fourth embodiment.<br>
The process commences with step 9, wherein the controller 419 prompts an operator for a<br>
change order input. Next, step 11, an operator inputs a change flow circuit command to the<br>
input device 408. The controller 419 then moves to step 12 to determine if a flow circuit is<br>
currently extended. If a flow circuit is currently extended, the controller 419 closes the<br>
currently extended flow circuit by deactivating the activated solenoid 404 or 405, step 13.<br>
Once all activated solenoids for the product valve 105 are deactivated, the controller 419<br>
activates the respective solenoid for the desired flow circuit extension, as shown in step 14.<br>
If a flow circuit is not currently extended for the product valve 105 in step 12, then the<br>
controller 419 moves to step 14 to activate the solenoid for the desired flow circuit<br>
extension. After the flow circuit has been extended, the operator must purge the newly<br>
extended flow circuit to remove any remnant diluent, thereby ensuring a homogeneous<br>
dispense, step 15.<br>
While this fourth embodiment has been shown with a product dispenser 400<br>
including a control system 410, that controls and operates the product dispenser 400 and the<br>
switch over device 403, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the control system<br>
410 may be utilized with the switch over device 403, yet not include the product dispenser<br>
400. Operation of the switch over device 403 without the product dispenser 400 may be<br>
possible by including the control system 410. In this arrangement, the switch over device<br>
403 could be connected to product sources or diluent sources as desired. The control<br>
system 410 could then direct the movement from a first position to a second position, and<br>
the movement from the second position to the first position, thereby regulating the flow of<br>
fluids, as previously described, through the switch over device 403. Additional framework<br><br>
may be required to mount the switchover device 403, the solenoids 404 and 405, as well as<br>
other associated components.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in terms of the foregoing .<br>
preferred embodiment, such description has been for exemplary purposes only and, as will<br>
be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, many alternatives, equivalents, and<br>
variations of varying degrees will fall within the scope of the present invention. That scope,<br>
