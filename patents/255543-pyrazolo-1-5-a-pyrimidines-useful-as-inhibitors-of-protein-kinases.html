PYRAZOLO[1,5-a]PYRIMIDINES USEFUL AS INHIBITORS OF PROTEIN<br>
KINASES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0100]       The present invention relates to compounds useful as inhibitors of protein<br>
kinases, particularly Tec family kinases, Aurora ldnases and c-Met. The invention also<br>
provides pharmaceutically acceptable compositions comprising the compounds of the<br>
invention and methods of using the compositions in the treatment of various disorders.<br>
The invention also provides processes for preparing the compounds of the invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0101]       The Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases plays a central role in<br>
signalling through antigen-receptors such as the TCR, BCR and Fce receptors and are<br>
essential for T cell activation. Deletion of Itk in mice results in reduced T cell receptor<br>
(TCR)-induced proliferation and secretion of the cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, DL-10 and<br>
EFN-Î³. Itk has been implicated in allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis.<br>
[0102]       Tec family ldnases are also essential for B cell development and activation.<br>
Patients with mutations in Btk have a profound block in B cell development, resulting in<br>
the almost complete absence of B lymphocytes and plasma cells, severely reduced Ig<br>
levels and a profound inhibition of humoral response to recall antigens. Btk deletion in<br>
mice has a profound effect on B cell proliferation induced by anti-IgM, and inhibits<br>
immune responses to thymus-independent type II antigens.<br>
[0103]       Tec kinases also play a role in mast cell activation through the high-affinity<br>
IgE receptor (FCERI). Itk and Btk are expressed in mast cells and are activated by FceRI<br>
cross-linking. Btk deficient murine mast cells have reduced degranulation and decreased<br><br>
WO 2006/052913                                                                                               PCT/US2005/040344<br>
-2-<br>
production of proinflammatory cytokines following FceRI cross-linking.   Btk deficiency<br>
also results in a decrease of macrophage effector functions.<br>
[0104]       The Aurora proteins are a family of three highly related serine/threonine<br>
kinases (termed Aurora-A, -B and -C) that are essential for a cell's progression through<br>
the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. Specifically Aurora-A plays a crucial role in<br>
centrosome maturation and segregation, formation of the mitotic spindle, and faithful<br>
segregation of chromosomes. Aurora-B is a chromosomal passenger protein that plays a<br>
central role in regulating the alignment of chromosomes on the meta-phase plate, in the<br>
spindle assembly checkpoint, and also in the correct completion of cytokinesis.<br>
[0105]       Overexpression of Aurora-A (Aurora-2), Aurora-B (Aurora-1) or Aurora-C<br>
has been observed in a range of human cancers including colorectal, ovarian, gastric, and<br>
invasive duct adenocarcinomas.<br>
[0106]       A number of studies have now demonstrated that depletion or inhibition of<br>
Aurora-A or -B in human cancer cell lines by siRNA, dominant negative or neutralizing<br>
antibodies, disrupts progression through mitosis with accumulation of cells with 4N<br>
DNA. In some cases, this is followed by endoreduplication and cell death.<br>
[0107]       The c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in a significant<br>
percentage of human cancers and is amplified during the transition between primary<br>
tumors and metastasis. The various cancers in which c-Met is implicated include, but are<br>
not limited to, gastric adenocarcinoma, renal cancer, small cell lung carcinoma,<br>
colorectal cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, brain cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic<br>
cancer, and breast cancer. c-Met is also implicated in atherosclerosis, lung fibrosis,<br>
allergic disorders, autoimmune disorders, and conditions associated with organ<br>
transplantation.<br>
[0108]       Accordingly, there is a great need to develop compounds useful as inhibitors<br>
of protein kinases. In particular, it would be desirable to develop compounds that are<br>
useful as inhibitors of Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk) and Aurora<br>
family protein kinases, as well as c-Met, particularly given the inadequate treatments<br>
currently available for the majority of the disorders implicated in their activation.<br><br>

exemplified by particular classes, subclasses, and species of the invention. It will be<br>
appreciated that the phrase "optionally substituted" is used interchangeably with the<br>
phrase "substituted or unsubstituted." In general, the term "substituted", whether<br>
preceded by the term "optionally" or not, refers to the replacement of hydrogen radicals<br>
in a given structure with the radical of a specified substituent. Unless otherwise<br>
indicated, an optionally substituted group may have a substituent at each substitutable<br>
position of the group, and when more than one position in any given structure may be<br>
substituted with more than one substituent selected from a specified group, the<br>
substituent may be either the same or different at every position. Combinations of<br>
substituents envisioned by this invention are preferably those that result in the formation<br>
of stable or chemically feasible compounds. The term "stable", as used herein, refers to<br>
compounds that are not substantially altered when subjected to conditions to allow for<br>
their production, detection, and preferably their recovery, purification, and use for one or<br>

[0193]       Scheme III above shows a general synthetic route that has been used for<br>
preparing compounds 9 of this invention when Z, R and Ar are as described herein.<br>
Pyrazolo[l,5-a]pyrimidines 8 are prepared by cyclisation of diamino-pyrazoles 3 with<br>
the commercially available 2-bromo-malonaldehyde 7. Finally, the formation of the<br>
biaryl link derivatives 9 is achieved by treating bromides 8 with the desired boronic acid<br>
derivative in the presence of palladium(0) as a catalyst by using the microwave-assisted<br>
Suzuki coupling methods that are well known in the art. The reaction is amenable to a<br>
variety of substituted aryl or heteroaryl boronic acids.<br>

[0198]       Scheme IV above shows a general synthetic route that has been used for<br>
preparing compounds 12 of this invention when Z, R and R4 are as described herein. The<br>
cyclisation of diamino-pyrazoles 3 in presence of P-dimethylaminoketones 10 has been<br>
achieved by methods substantially similar to those described in the literature by Elnagdi<br>
and Erian Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn 1990, 63, 1854. The reaction is amenable to a variety of<br>
diamino-pyrazoles 3 and P-dimethylaminoketones 10. Intermediates 11 are oxidized with<br>
DDQ according to step (b) of Scheme IV.<br>

[0210]       As discussed above, the present invention provides compounds that are<br>
inhibitors of protein kinases, and thus the present compounds are useful for the treatment<br>
of diseases, disorders, and conditions including, but not limited to an autoimmune,<br>
inflammatory, proliferative, or hyperproliferative disease or an immunologically-<br>
mediated disease. Accordingly, in another aspect of the present invention,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable compositions are provided, wherein these compositions<br>
comprise any of the compounds as described herein, and optionally comprise a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant or vehicle. In certain embodiments, these<br>
compositions optionally further comprise one or more additional therapeutic agents.<br>
[0211]       It will also be appreciated that certain of the compounds of present invention<br>
can exist in free form for treatment, or where appropriate, as a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable derivative thereof. According to the present invention, a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable derivative includes, but is not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable salts,<br>
esters, salts of such esters, or any other adduct or derivative which upon administration<br>
to a patient in need is capable of providing, directly or indirectly, a compound as<br>
otherwise described herein, or a metabolite or residue thereof.<br>
[0212]       As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to those<br>
salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact<br><br>

with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic<br>
response and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. A<br>
"pharmaceutically acceptable salt" means any non-toxic salt or salt of an ester of a<br>
compound of this invention that, upon administration to a recipient, is capable of<br>
providing, either directly or indirectly, a compound of this invention or an inhibitorily<br>
active metabolite or residue thereof. As used herein, the term "inhibitorily active<br>
metabolite or residue thereof" means that a metabolite or residue thereof is also an<br>
inhibitor of a Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk) protein kinase, an<br>
Aurora family kinase or c-Met.<br>
[0213]       Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example, S.<br>
M. Berge et al., describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J. Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences, 1977, 66,1-19, incorporated herein by reference. Pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts of the compounds of this invention include those derived from suitable inorganic<br>
and organic acids and bases. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid<br>
addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as<br>
hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid<br>
or with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric<br>
acid, succinic acid or malonic acid or by using other methods used in the art such as ion<br>
exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include adipate, alginate, ascorbate,<br>
aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bisulfate, borate, butyrate, camphorate,<br>

and the like. Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal, alkaline earth<br>
metal, ammonium and N+(Ci.4alkyl)4 salts. This invention also envisions the<br>
quaternization of any basic nitrogen-containing groups of the compounds disclosed<br>
herein. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products may be obtained by such<br>
quaternization. Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium,<br><br>

acceptable salts include, when appropriate, nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium,<br>
and amine cations formed using counterfoils such as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate,<br>
sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, loweralkyl sulfonate and aryl sulfonate.<br>
[0214]       As described above, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of the<br>
present invention additionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant,<br>
or vehicle, which, as used herein, includes any and all solvents, diluents, or other liquid<br>
vehicle, dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents, thickening<br>
or emulsifying agents, preservatives, solid binders, lubricants and the like, as suited to<br>
the particular dosage form desired. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sixteenth<br>
Edition, E. W. Martin (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1980) discloses various<br>
carriers used in formulating pharmaceutically acceptable compositions and known<br>
techniques for the preparation thereof. Except insofar as any conventional canier<br>
medium is incompatible with the compounds of the invention, such as by producing any<br>
undesirable biological effect or otherwise interacting in a deleterious manner with any<br>
other component(s) of the pharmaceutically acceptable composition, its use is<br>
contemplated to be within the scope of this invention. Some examples of materials which<br>
can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, ion<br>
exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as human serum<br>
albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, or potassium<br>
sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or<br>
electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium<br>
hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate,<br>

[0215]          In yet another aspect, a method for the treatment or lessening the severity<br>
of a Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk)-mediated disease, an Aurora<br>
family-mediated disease or a c-Met-mediated disease, is provided comprising<br>
administering an effective amount of a compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
composition comprising a compound to a subject in need thereof. In certain<br>
embodiments of the present invention an "effective amount" of the compound or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable composition is that amount effective for a Tec family<br>
(e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk)-mediated disease, an Aurora family-<br>
mediated disease or a c-Met-mediated disease. The compounds and compositions,<br>
according to the method of the present invention, may be administered using any amount<br>
and any route of administration effective for treating or lessening the severity of a Tec<br>
family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk)-mediated disease, an Aurora family-<br>
mediated disease or a c-Met-mediated disease. The exact amount required will vary<br>
from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, and general condition of the<br>
subject, the severity of the infection, the particular agent, its mode of administration, and<br>
the like. The compounds of the invention are preferably formulated in dosage unit form<br>
for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. The expression "dosage unit form"<br>
as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit of agent appropriate for the patient to be<br>
treated. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and<br>
compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within<br>
the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific effective dose level for any particular<br>
patient or organism will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being<br>
treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed;<br>
the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of<br>
the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of<br>
the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in<br>
combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed, and like factors well<br><br>

preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human.<br>
[0216]       The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention can be<br>
administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally,<br>
intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally,<br>
as an oral or nasal spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being<br>
treated. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be administered<br>
orally or parenterally at dosage levels of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg and<br>
preferably from about 1 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or<br>
more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
[0217]       Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups<br>
and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain<br>
inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents,<br>
solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl<br>
carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, com, germ, olive,<br>
castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and<br>
fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral<br>
compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and<br>
suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br>
[0218]       Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous<br>
suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or<br>
wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a<br>
sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable<br>
diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable<br>
vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and<br>
isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally<br>
employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can<br>
be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as<br>
oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.<br><br>
WO 2006/052913                                                                                               PCT/US2005/040344<br>

[0219]       The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration<br>
through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of<br>
sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other<br>
sterile injectable medium prior to use.<br>
[0220]       In order to prolong the effect of a compound of the present invention, it is<br>
often desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or<br>
intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of<br>
crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of<br>
the compound then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon<br>
crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally<br>
administered compound form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the<br>
compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule<br>
matrices of the compound in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide.<br>
Depending upon the ratio of compound to polymer and the nature of the particular<br>
polymer employed, the rate of compound release can be controlled. Examples of other<br>
biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable<br>
formulations are also prepared by entrapping the compound in liposomes or<br>
microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.<br>
[0221]       Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories<br>
which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-<br>
irritating excipients or earners such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository<br>
wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore<br>
melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.<br>
[0222]       Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills,<br>
powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at<br>
least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or<br>
dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose,<br>
glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia,<br>
c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar--agar, calcium<br>
carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate,<br>
e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as<br><br>

and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i)<br>
lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols,<br>
sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the<br>
dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.<br>
[0223]       Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft<br>
and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as<br>
high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of<br>
tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells<br>
such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical<br>
formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a<br>
composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain<br>
part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding<br>
compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid<br>
compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled<br>
gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular<br>
weight polethylene glycols and the like.<br>
[0224]       The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or<br>
more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules,<br>
pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings,<br>
release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical<br>
formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at<br>
least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also<br>
comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g.,<br>
tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and<br>
microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms<br>
may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and<br>
can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or<br>
preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner.<br>
Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and<br>
waxes.<br><br>

[0225]       Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this<br>
invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays,<br>
inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be<br>
required. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops, and eye drops are also contemplated as<br>
being within the scope of this invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates<br>
the use of transdermal patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled<br>
delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or<br>
dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used<br>
to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either<br>
providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer<br>
matrix or gel.<br>
[0226]       As described generally above, the compounds of the invention are useful as<br>
inhibitors of protein kinases. In one embodiment, the compounds and compositions of<br>
the invention are inhibitors of one or more of a Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk,<br>
Bmx, Txk/Rlk) kinase, an Aurora family kinase or a c-Met family kinase, and thus,<br>
without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the compounds and compositions<br>
are particularly useful for treating or lessening the severity of a disease, condition, or<br>
disorder where activation of one or more of a Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk,<br>
Bmx, Txk/Rlk) kinase, an Aurora family kinase or c-Met is implicated in the disease,<br>
condition, or disorder. When activation of Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx,<br>
Txk/Rlk) kinase, an Aurora family kinase or c-Met is implicated in a particular disease,<br>
condition, or disorder, the disease, condition, or disorder may also be referred to as a<br>
"Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk)-mediated disease", "an Aurora<br>
family-mediated disease" or "a c-Met-mediated disease" or disease symptom.<br>
Accordingly, in another aspect, the present invention provides a method for treating or<br>
lessening the severity of a disease, condition, or disorder where activation or one or<br>
more of Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk) kinase, an Aurora family<br>
kinase or c-Met is implicated in the disease state.<br>
[0227]       The activity of a compound utilized in this invention as an inhibitor of a Tec<br>
family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk) kinase, an Aurora family kinase or c-<br>
Met may be assayed in vitro, in vivo or in a cell line. In vitro assays include assays that<br><br>

determine inhibition of either the phosphorylation activity or ATPase activity of<br>
activated Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk) kinase, an Aurora<br>
family kinase or c-Met. Alternate in vitro assays quantitate the ability of the inhibitor to<br>
bind to a Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk) kinase, an Aurora<br>
family kinase or c-Met. Inhibitor binding may be measured by radiolabelling the<br>
inhibitor prior to binding, isolating the inhibitor/kinase complex and determining the<br>
amount of radiolabel bound. Alternatively, inhibitor binding may be determined by<br>
running a competition experiment where new inhibitors are incubated with a Tec family<br>
(e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk) kinase, an Aurora family kinase or c-Met<br>
bound to known radioligands.<br>
