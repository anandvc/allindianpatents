METHOD FOR PRODUCING 2-DEOXY-L-RIBOSE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a synthetic method for the compound having formula (1) below, more specifically, to a mass-produceable and cost-effective synthetic method of compound having formula (1) from 2-Deoxy-D-ribose with easy reaction, separation, and purification.<br><br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Recently, natural or modified L-nucleoside are attracting attention as antiviral agents. Some L-nucleosides such as; L-thymidine, L-2'-thiacytidine (3TC) and L-2',3'-dideoxycytidine (L-ddC) are much less toxic and have better antiviral activity than their D-isomers. In addition, L-nucleosides have good effect in antisense oligonucleotide therapy.<br>
For the above reasons, many attempts have been made to synthesize L-nucleosides effectively which cannot be obtained as natural products. The efforts has been being<br>
1<br><br>
focused to economic and mass-produceable preparation method for the derivatives of L-sugar, particularly, 2-deoxy-D-ribose and L-ribose which can be used as key intermediates of L-nucleosides.<br>
Some synthetic methods for 2-deoxy-L-ribose are known from D-ribose, L-arabinose or L-ascorbic acid. (WO 9839347, CS 274394B1, Nucleosides Nucleotidees 1999, 18 (11 &amp; 12), 2357-2365, Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 2000, 11, 1869-176, Org. Lett 1999, 1 (10), 1517-1519)<br>
In these methods, however, expensive or highly toxic reagents are used; difficult separation and purification is required; the overall yield is low; all which are obstacles to the application in the large-scale synthesis.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the objective of the present invention is to provide a synthetic process of 2-deoxy-L-ribose, which allows the cost-effective and large-scale synthesis thanks to the short process, the easy reaction and purification.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
To achieve the above objective, the present invention provides the synthetic process of compound having formula (1) comprising 4 steps; protection, activation and inversion of 3-and 4-OH groups of 2-deoxy-D-ribose, and deprotection.<br>
2<br><br>
The present invention provides the synthetic process of compound (1) comprising the steps of; (A) protection step in which aldehyde group of 2-deoxy-D-ribose is protected in the form of acetal. 2-deoxy-l-O-alkyl-D-ribopyranoside is prepared by the reaction of 2-deoxy-D-ribose with alcohol in the presence of acid; (B) activation step in which 3-and 4-OH groups of 2-deoxy-D-ribose are activated. 2-deoxy-l-O-alkyl-3,4-di-(alkanesulfonyl)-D-ribose or 2-deoxy-l-0-alkyl-3,4-di-(arylsulfonyl)-D-ribose is prepared by reaction of the above 2-deoxy-l-O-alkyl-D-ribose with organic sulfonylhalide for activation of 3- and 4-OH; (C) inversion step in which stereochemistry of 3- and 4-OH groups is changed. Reaction of the above 2-deoxy-l-0-alkyl-3,4-di-(alkanesulfonyl)-D-ribose or 2-deoxy-l-0-alkyl-3)4-di-(arylsulfonyl)-D-ribose with a metal salt of organic acid leads to 2-deoxy-L-ribose derivatives of which stereochemistry of 3- and 4-OH is different from the corresponding 2-deoxy-D-ribose derivatives; (D) deprotection step in which 2-deoxy-L-ribose is prepared by consecutive reactions of the step (C) products with acid and base.<br>
Each step will be explained in the following. (1) Protection<br>
In this step, protecting group is introduced in the form of acetal by the reaction of compound (2), 2-deoxy-D-ribose with alcohol in the presence of acid.<br>
3<br><br><br>

The acid used in this step contains inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid or organic acid such as methanesulfonic acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid and the concentration of acid is preferably 1 ~ 10%. A lower alcohol such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, propyl alcohol and butyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol or substituted benzyl alcohol may be used.<br>
(2)  Activation  of 3-  and  4-OH  groups:  Preparation  of 2-Deoxy-l-O-alkyl-3,4-di-<br>
(alkanesulfonyl)-D-ribose or 2-deoxy-l-O-alkyl-3.,4-di-(arylsulfonyl)-D-ribose<br>
In this step, compound (4), 2-deoxy-l-O-alkyl-3,4-di-(alkanesulfonyl)-D-ribose or 2-deoxy-l-O-aIkyl-3,4-di-(arylsulfonyl)-D-ribose is obtained by converting 3- and 4-OH groups of compound having formula(3) into 3- and 4-sulfonyl groups by the action of organic sulfonyl halide and an organic base. The purpose of this reaction is the activation of 3- and 4-OH groups for further reaction.<br>
An organic sulfonyl halide used in this step may include a lower alkanesulfonyl halide such as methanesulfonyl chloride and trifluoromethylsulfonyl chloride and arylsulfonyl halide such as bezenesulfonyl chloride and p-toluenesulfonylchloride. Detailed reaction condition is accordance with basic methods of organic synthesis.<br>
4<br><br><br>
Here, Rl represents a lower alkyl having 1-8 of carbon number, a substituted or unsubstituted benzyl and R2 represents a lower alkylsulfonyl having 1-8 of carbon number, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl sulfonyl group.<br>
(3) Inversion (conversion to L-sugar from D-sugar): Preparation of the mixture of 2-deoxy-l-O-alkyl-3-acyl-L-riboseand2-deoxy-l-O-alkyl-4-acyl-L-ribose<br>
Compound (5), the mixture of 2-deoxy-l-0-alkyl-3-acyl-L-ribose and 2-deoxy-l-O-alkyl-4-benzoyl-L-robose in which the stereochemistry of 3- and 4- carbon is changed is prepared through the reaction of compound having formula (4) with a metal salt of organic acid.<br>
A metal salt of organic acid used in this step may include a metal salt of lower alkyl organic acid such as sodium acetate, potassium acetate or a metal salt of aryl organic acid such as sodium benzoate or potassium benzoate. A solvent used in this step may include water and organic solvent such as dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide (DMAC), and alohols, but DMF or the mixture of water and organic solvent is preferable in view of solubility of the reactants.<br>
5<br><br><br>
Here, Rl represents a lower alkyl having 1-8 of carbon number, a substituted or unsubstituted benzyl and R2 represents a lower alkylsulfonyl having 1-8 of carbon number, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl sulfonyl group.<br>
(4) Deprotection<br>
Compound having formula (1), 2-deoxy-L-ribose is obtained by the stepwise reactions of compound (5) with acid and base. Acid and base used in deprotection conventionally may also be used in this step. The order of the stepwise reactions may be changed according to its convenience.<br><br>
Compound having formula (1) can be used as a raw material for the further reaction without purification or can be purified by the formation of anilide derivative well known as a purification method of 2-deoxy-D-ribose to obtain as solid<br>
The above preparation method is depicted in the following scheme:<br>
6<br><br><br>
[ Rl: lower alkyl having 1 -8 of carbon number or substituted or unsubstituted benzyl R2: lower alkylsulfonyl having 1-8 of carbon number or substituted or unsubstituted arylsulfonyl<br>
R3: lower alkyl having 1-8 of carbon number or substituted or unsubstituted benzyl ]<br>
The syntheses described above provide simple preparation method of compound having formula (1) utilizing chief and commercially available reagents without toxic reagent such as heavy metal and easily attainable temperature and pressure range.<br>
In addition, separation and purification is easy without special equipment because the key intermediate and final product can be purified by recrystallization.<br>
The raw material, 2-deoxy-D-ribose is not only abundant in natural products, but also obtained by chemical synthesis. All the above reason make the procedure mass-producible effectively.<br>
