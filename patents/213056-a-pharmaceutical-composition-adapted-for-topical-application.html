IMPROVED    TOPICAL    MEDICAMENTS    AND    METHODS    FOR PHOTODYNAMIC TREATMENT OF DISEASE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/149,015 filed August 13, 1999 which is a continuation-in-part of USSN 08/989,231, filed December 11,1997, USSN 09/130,041, filed on August 6,1998, USSN 09/184,388, filed on November 2, 1998, and USSN 09/216,787, filed on December 21, 1998. which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
The present invention is related to certain photodynamic, topically-applicable medicaments and methods for treatment of human or animal tissue using photodynamic therapy (PDT).<br>
PDT was originally developed to treat cancer and other diseases with the promise of limiting the invasiveness of the therapeutic intervention and lessening potential collateral damage to normal, non-diseased tissue. In its simplest form, PDT is the combination of a photosensitive agent with special forms of illumination to produce a therapeutic response in certain tissues, such as a tumor. The agent attains an excited, active state when it absorbs one or more photons and then is or becomes efficacious. Key elements of a successful PDT regimen include either selective application or selective uptake of a photosensitive agent into the diseased tissue and site-specific application of the activating light. PDT agents are typically applied systemically (for example, via intravenous injection or oral administration) or via localized topical application directly to diseased tissues (for example, via topical creams, ointments, or sprays). Subsequent to administration of the agent (typically 30 minutes to 72 hours later), an activating light is applied to the disease site, locally activating the agent, and destroying the diseased tissue. Light is typically applied by direct illumination of the site, or by delivery of light energy to internal locations using a fiberoptic catheter or similar device.<br>
Most cunrent PDT regimens are based on systemic application of porphyrin-based agents or topical or systemic application of psoralen-based agents. Examples of porphyrin-based agents include porfimer sodium (PHOTOFRIN®), hematoporphyrin-derivative (HPD), benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD), Lutex, BOPP, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), and SnET,. PHOTOFRIN® is one of the few agents currently licensed by the U.S. FDA.   Porphyrin-based agents generally are derived from complex mixtures of<br><br>
natural or synthetically prepared materials, and may contain components that are lipophilic. As a possible result of this lipophilicity, porphyrin-based agents have shown a slight tendency to preferentially accumulate in some tumors and other diseased tissues. However, the targeting of such agents to diseased tissue is still unacceptably low when compared to uptake in normal tissue (i.e., at most 2-1 Ox greater uptake in diseased tissue relative to normal tissue). The psoralens, such as 8-MOP, 5-MOP, trioxsalen,and AMT, are nucleic acid intercalators that function by impairing cellular physiology. This intercalation appears to be relatively indiscriminate in terms of tissue type, and as a result these agents also exhibit minimal specificity for diseased tissue. Thus, current agents have failed to exhibit sufficient specificity, and may exhibit additional disadvantages, including persistent systemic or localized photosensitivity, systemic or localized toxicity, and unacceptable treatment cost (due to high agent cost or excessive dosage requirements).<br>
The inherent disadvantages of various current PDT agents and medicaments containing such agents have made acceptable PDT-bascd treatment of various human and animal conditions difficult or impossible. These disadvantages are particularly serious in the case of indications affecting external or internal surface or near surface tissues, where it would be desirable to have medicaments suitable for localized, selective treatment of the desired tissues. Such indications include a variety of conditions affecting the skin and related organs, the mouth and digestive tract and related organs, the urinary and reproductive tracts and related organs, the respiratory tract and related organs, as well as various other tissue surfaces, such as tissue surfaces exposed during surgery.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide new medicaments, medical uses for such medicaments based on targeted application of such medicaments and methods for treatment using such medicaments, thereby resulting in increased efficacy and safety and reduced cost of treatment.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to new photodynamic, topically-applicable medicaments and certain medical uses of such photodynamic medicaments or methods for treatment using such medicaments for treatment of human or animal tissue, wherein a primary active component of such medicaments is a halogenated xanthene, and more preferably Rose Bengal or its derivative. The halogenated xanthenes constitute a family of potent photosensitizers that become photoactivated upon illumination with visible<br><br>
wavelengths of light. Such medicaments can also be called pharmaceutical compositions or agents.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have found that such medicaments are useful for treatment of a variety of conditions affecting the skin and related organs, the mouth and digestive tract and related organs, the urinary and reproductive tracts and related organs, the respiratory tract and related organs, as well as various other tissue surfaces, such as tissue surfaces exposed during surgery. These medicaments are applied in various formulations including liquid, semisolid or aerosol delivery vehicles. Photoactivation of photoactive ingredients in such medicaments produces a desirable medical response, such as destruction of microbial infection, reduction or elimination of tissue irritation, reduction or elimination of hyperproliferative tissue, reduction or elimination of cancerous or precancerous tissue, reduction or elimination of surface or subsurface lipocytes or lipid deposits, and many other similar indications.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, such medicaments are used for treatment of a variety of conditions affecting the skin and related organs.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is directed to new photodynamic, topically-applicable medicaments and certain medical uses of such photodynamic medicaments or methods for treatment using such medicaments for treatment of human or animal tissue, wherein a primary active component of such medicaments is a halogenated xanthcne. Such halogenated xanthenes discussed infra are capable of exhibiting a desirable photodynamic effect when applied to or otherwise delivered to certain human or animal tissues, and undergo photodynamic activation in such tissues upon illumination with visible, and in particular green, light. These desirable effects include reduction or elimination of disease or other undesirable conditions, including eradication of cancerous or pre-cancerous tumors and infectious agents, and are applicable to a variety of conditions affecting the skin and related organs, the mouth and digestive tract and related organs, the urinary and reproductive tracts and related organs, the respiratory tract and related organs, and various other internal or external tissue surfaces, such as tissue surfaces exposed during surgery.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, such medicaments arc produced in various formulations including liquid, semisolid or aerosol delivery vehicles.<br>
1. PTOperties of the preferred photoactive components and medicament formulations. The applicants have discovered that a certain class of photoactive agents are broadly applicable for producing topically-applicable medicaments for treatment of certain human and animal tissues. These photoactive agents are referred to as halogenated xanthenes and are illustrated in Figure la. where the symbols X, Y. and Z represent various elements<br><br>
present at the designated positions, and the symbols R1 and R2 represent various functionalities present at the designated positions.<br>
Selected chemical and physical properties (such as the chemical constituents at . positions X. Y, and Z and the functionalities R1 and R2. along with molecular weight and photochemical characteristics) of representative halogenated xanthenes are summarized in attached Table 1. The general properties ofthis class ofagents are discussed in further detail in USSN 09/130,041, filed on August 6, 1998, USSN 09/184,388, filed on November 2,1998, and USSN 09/216,787, filed on December 21,1998, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. In general, the halogenated xanthenes are characterized by a low dark cytotoxicity (toxicity to cells or tissues in the absence of photoactivation), high light cytotoxicity (toxicity to cells or tissues upon photoacti vation) and chemical and photochemical properties that are substantially unaffected by the local chemical environment or the attachment of functional derivatives at positions R1 and R2 This makes such chemical agents, and in particular medicaments formulated from such agents, excellent PDT agents for the treatment of human and animal tissues.<br>
It is thus a preferred embodiment of the present invention that a topically-applicable medicament be produced that contains, as an active ingredient at a concentration of from greater than approximately 0.001% to less than approximately 20%, at least one halogenated xanthene.<br>
It is further preferred that this medicament include the halogenated xanthene Rose Bengal (4,5,6,7-tetrachloro-2\4',5',7-tetraiodofluorescein. illustrated in Figure lb).<br>
Other example halogenated xanthenes that can be used in the present invention include, but arc not limited to, one or more of; Fluorescein; 4',5'-Dichlorofluorescein; 2'J'-Dichlorofluorescein;4,5.6,7-Tetrachlorofluorcscein;2',4\5',7'-Tetrachlorofluorescein; Dibromofluorescein; Solvent Red 72; Diiodofluorescein; Eosin B; Eosin Y; Ethyl Eosin; Erythrosin B; Phloxine B; Rose Bengal; 4,5.6,7-Tetrabromoerythrosin; Mono-. Di-, or Tribromoerythrosin; Mono-, Di-, or Trichloroerythrosin; Mono-, Di-, or Tricfluoroerythrosin; 2',7'-Dichloro-4,5,6,7-Tetrafluorofluorescein; 2',4,5,6,7,7'-Hexafluorofluorescein; and 4,5,6,7-Tetrafluorofluorescein.<br>
Further, as evidenced by the data shown in Table 1 and in Figure 2, it is clear that the halogenated xanthenes share common spectroscopic properties, including a high single-photon cross-section extending from approximately 500 nm to 600 nm. These properties are substantially invariant regardless of state of derivatization (for example, at positions<br><br>
R1 and R2) or of chemical or biological environment. This feature facilitates photoactivation with commonly available visible light sources, such as cw or pulsed lasers or lamps, operating in the band from approximately 500 nm to 600 nm, and circumvents the need to substantively change sources if the specific photoactive component of the medicament is varied or modified, as disclosed herein. Furthermore, the inventors of the present invention have shown that the halogenated xanthenes are capable of being activated using non-linear, multi-photon excitation under certain conditions when using light in the near infrared band from approximately 700 nm to 1200 nm (using methods, such as for example, those taught in USSN 08/989,231, filed December 11, 1997 and USSN 09/096,832 filed June 12,1998, which are incorporated herein by reference). Such excitation methods provide additional udlity in activation of medicaments formulated from such agents, such as for example when it is desirable to increase the depth of photoactivation to positions substanually below an exposed tissue surface.<br>
As an example of these desirable chemical, biochemical, and physical properties, the inventors have found that the prototypical halogenated xanthcne. Rose Bengal, will accumulate preferentially in (i.e. target) some tumors and other diseased tissues and pathogens, has negligible dark cytotoxicity, high light cytotoxicity upon illumination with visible light, relatively low cost, and the ability to clear rapidly from the body.<br>
Moreover, the inventors have discovered that the facility with which the halogenated xanthenes target specific tissues or other sites can be further optimized by attachment of specific functional derivatives at positions R' and R", so as to change the chemical partitioning or biological activity of the agent. For example, attachment of one targeting moiety or more at positions R' or R- can be used to improve targeting to specific tissues, such as cancerous tumor tissues or sites of localized infection. An example of this is estcrification at position R' with a short aliphatic alcohol, such as n-hexanol, to produce a derivatized agent exhibiting enhanced partitioning into lipid-rich tumor tissues.<br>
It is thus a further preferred embodiment that at least one of the at least one halogenated xanthcne active ingredients includes at least one targeting moiety selected from a group that includes DNA, RNA, amino acids, proteins, antibodies, ligands, haptens, carbohydrate receptors or complexing agents, lipid receptors or complexing agents, protein receptors or complexing agents, chelators, encapsulating vehicles, short-or long-chain aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, including those containing aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, esters, amides, amines, nitriles, azides, or other hydrophilic or<br><br>
hydrophobic moieties. A further example of this embodiment is denvatization of Rose Bengal with a lipid (at position R', via esterification), so as to increase the lipophilicity of Rose Bengal, and thereby modify its targeting properties in a patient.<br>
Because the halogenated xanthenes and their derivatives are, in general, solids in their pure form, it is preferred that, for proper delivery to desired tissues, such agents be formulated in appropriate delivery vehicles. Approaches to such formulation will be generally known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Specifically, such formulations are preferred so as to facilitate agent contact with, and delivery to, desired tissues to be treated.<br>
It is thus a further preferred embodiment of the present invention that at least one halogenated xanthene or halogenated xanthene derivative be formulated as a medicament in a topically-applicable form, such as in a liquid, semisolid, solid or aerosol delivery vehicle, including aqueous, non-aqueous or nanoparticulate suspensions, solutions, creams, ointments, gels, syrups, suppositories or micro-droplet sprays. The at least one halogenated xanthene or halogenated xanthene derivative may be dissolved or suspended in such delivery vehicle, wherein this vehicle may, in addition to the at least one halogenated xanthene or halogenated xanthene derivative, include various builders, stabilizers, emulsificrs or dispcrsants, preservatives, buffers, electrolytes, and tissue peneU3ting or softening agents. Such components of the delivery vehicle may be present as the primary component (by weight or volume) of the medicament, or as a minor component that serves in an adjuvant role in agent delivery.<br>
For example, appropriate builders include cellulose and cellulose derivatives, such as starch, and alginates.<br>
