In this invention the combination of three drugs namely Hippophae salicifolia, Ocimum basilicum and Emblica officinalis is used for the preparation of a novel formulation for prevention and management of coryza (common cold). For the first time we have observed that the organic extract of Hippophae salicifolia enchances the cellular body immunity and prevents form cold stress. When the organic extract of Hippophae salicifolia is given with Ocimum basilicum alongwith Emblica officinalis, further potentiates the potency of Hipppphae salicifolia by enchancing general body immunity among the subects who are prone to develop frequent cold and cough due to low body resistance. In traditional practice only Ocimum basilicum is used as a decoction among those cases suffering from common cold and fever. By adding the above combination this prevents from the allergy phenomenon along with increase in body resistance.<br>
