Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to the design of apparatuses for the input of symbols, more<br>
particularly, to apparatuses for discoverable input of symbols with reduced keyboards.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A standard desktop computer keyboard contains 100 or more keys. The<br>
keyboard may be used to encode many more symbols than it has keys, including<br>
letters, capital letters, accented letters, digits, punctuation symbols, and functional<br>
symbols such as symbols to encode cursor movement, character deletion, or<br>
shortcut access to the internet. Therefore, many of the keys are typically called<br>
on to encode more than one symbol. As the number of different functions a<br>
computer keyboard needs to perform is increasing, the number of keys on a typical keyboard is<br>
increasing, leading to recent keyboards the size of platters for serving turkey.<br>
When we turn to reduced keyboards such as telephone keypads, the constraints governing<br>
the encoding of many symbols on few keys become much more severe. When there are many<br>
symbols on a key, some means must be provided to disambiguate the symbols, that is, to decide<br>
which symbol is intended for input. There are genetically three basic approaches to<br>
disambiguating multi-symbol keys:<br>
1) chording or shifting mechanisms, in which several keys are pressed at once, the typical<br>
example being the cap-shift key which disambiguates lower and upper case letters; 2) multi-tap<br>
mechanisms in which a key is pressed sequentially a different number of times depending on<br>
which of the symbols associated to the key is intended, telephone keypads often work this way,<br>
where the 2 key, for instance, is pressed once to input an "a", twice to input a "b", and three times<br>
to input a "c"; and 3) predictive-text methods in which software is used to predict which symbol<br>
is meant. An example here is the method of Riskin US5,031,206.<br>
Recent advances have been made to optimally combine these methods. For instance,<br>
Gutowitz US09/347,188, hereby incorporated by reference, teaches an optimal method to<br>
combined a multi-tap mechanism and a predictive method. Gutowitz PCT/US99/29,343, hereby<br>
incorporated by reference, teaches a method to optimally combine a shifting mechanism with a<br>
predictive mechanism.<br>
Extension of those teachings to the input of large symbol sets comprising digits,<br>
punctuation symbols, functional symbols, accented letters and the like, introduces a number of<br>
subtle but important problems. When the number of symbols to be encoded is very large, and the<br>
number of keys is very small, additional constraints are introduced beyond those having to do<br>
with proper disambiguation. These constraints arise due to many symbols needing to be<br>
represented on a single key. In particular, on a telephone keypad with small keys, even labelling<br>
the key with all of the symbols it needs to encode may be difficult. These problems are solved by<br>
the present invention.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an essential object of this invention to provide a method and apparatus for ergonomic<br>
entry of letters, punctuation symbols, digits, and functional symbols. Objects of this invention<br>
further comprise:<br>
Limited multi-tap depth. User studies show that one of the most annoying aspect of<br>
multi-tap is that some symbols may require many extra taps. For instance, the letter 6so requires<br>
four taps in standard multi-tap. In the present invention multi-tap depth is limited since most<br>
symbols can be obtained, depending on the embodiment, either with a) a auxiliary shift key, or b)<br>
one extra keystroke. Some rare symbols may require two or more extra keystrokes.<br>
Reduced keystrokes per symbol. As just stated, it is a desirable feature of this invention<br>
that it limits the number of keystrokes required to enter any symbol (the worst case). It is an <br>
additional object of this invention to decrease the expected number of keystrokes to enter most <br>
symbols (the average case).<br>
Unified focus. Beginning users tend to keep their attention focused on the keypad, while<br>
more advanced users tend to keep their attention focused on the display. For the sake of usability,<br>
it is of paramount importance to avoid forcing the user to shift focus from keypad to screen and<br>
back again. In the present invention, keypad labeling provides the beginner user a way to find all<br>
or most symbols without reference to the display. Advanced users, who have learned the<br>
assignment of symbols to keys, can keep their attention focused on the display.<br>
Discoverability. All or most symbols are visually coded in such a way that the key<br>
operations required to enter these symbols are evident from visual inspection, in a<br>
language-independent way. This coding helps the beginning user to discover, by simply scanning<br>
the keypad, how to operate the keypad.<br>
Graduated discoverability. Symbols are organized within ordered groups according to<br>
their probability. The most probable symbols can be obtained in an easy-to-discover way, with<br>
few keystrokes. It may be more difficult to discover how to enter rarer symbols, and rarer<br>
symbols may require more laborious multiple tapping. In order to encode a large number of<br>
symbols on a limited number of keys, some symbols must require more information to specify.<br>
The advantage of the present invention is that the additional information requirement is<br>
concentrated on rare symbols, symbols which can be easily avoided by average users, and in<br>
typical circumstances.<br>
Power. It is a given that the importance of text entry on cell phones and other handheld<br>
devices will grow, and the variety of uses to which text entry on these devices will be put will<br>
expand.The present invention provides all punctuation symbols found on a standard Qwerty<br>
keyboard. It could be used, for instance, to edit computer programs. Being both discoverable and<br>
 powerful, the present invention can satisfy the needs of the full spectrum of users.<br>
Compact presentation. By combining morphically related symbols, the present invention <br>
economizes keypad space. It allows several symbols to be presented for visual inspection<br>
in no more space than is required by a single symbol. This object is particularly important<br>
for handheld devices such as cell phones in which the keys may be very small, with very<br>
limited surface area available for labels.<br>
Seamless integration of multi-tap and predictive text methods. In the prior art,<br>
these methods are generally presented in the alternative. However, according to the<br>
teachings of this invention, both multi-tap and predictive methods can be seamlessly<br>
integrated in a single apparatus, and thus the user can take advantage of both methods,<br>
increasing usability of text input mechanisms.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The core inventive idea, some ramifications of which are developed into the<br>
preferred embodiment presented below, is that a) a single key can support a multiplicity<br>
of ordered groups, b) only a subset of each group needs to be visually represented on the<br>
face of a key, c) either multi-tap or predictive methods, or both, can be used to input<br>
members of each of the groups, and d) auxiliary keys are a convenient and effective<br>
method to select ordered groups, and to perform the multi-tap function. The objects of<br>
this invention: limited multi-tap depth, reduced keystrokes per symbol, unified focus,<br>
discoverability, graduated discoverability, power, compact presentation, and seamless<br>
integration of multi-tap and predictive text methods, can all be achieved by exploiting the<br>
core inventive idea.<br>
Accordingly, this invention teaches an apparatus for the entry of symbols<br>
comprising a multiplicity of keys wherein at least one of said keys is effective to input a<br>
multiplicity of ordered groups of symbols, wherein at least two of said ordered groups of<br>
symbols input by said at least one key comprise at least two symbols, and further<br>
comprising an iterator mechanism or predictive mechanism to select members of the<br>
ordered groups for input.<br>
DETAILED SPECIFICATION<br>
The invention is first described in reference to Fig. 1. Fig. 1 shows an<br>
apparatus 1000 for the entry of letters, including accented letters, as well as<br>
punctuation, digits, and various functional symbols. The apparatus comprises a<br>
plurality of keys. Some of the keys, such as 1001, are used for inputting<br>
only punctuation, in this case the * symbol, and the space symbol. Other<br>
keys, such as 1002 are used to input symbols and to perform functions, in this case, the #<br>
symbols, and the fix and next functions. These functions will be described below. Other<br>
keys are for the entry of peculation symbols and digits, such as 1003 which is for the<br>
entry of the digit 1 and the punctuation symbols! (exclamation point), (comma) and.<br>
(period). Still others, such as 1016, are for the entry of digits, punctuation symbols, and<br>
letters, in this case the digit 9, the symbol) (right parenthesis) and the letters w,x,y, and z.<br>
In accordance with the teachings of this invention, one of the keys 1005 is a punctuation<br>
auxiliary key, which is electronically coupled to at least some of the keys which input<br>
punctuation symbols (e.g. 1001-1004) such that when the punctuation auxiliary key is<br>
actuated in conjunction with keys which input inter alia punctuation symbols, then one of<br>
the punctuation symbols from the key is input provided that these punctuation symbols<br>
are contained in a punctuation ordered group associated with the punctuation<br>
auxiliary key. This punctuation auxiliary key, depending on the implementation,<br>
could be actuated before, after, or during the activation of the corresponding<br>
punctuation ordered - group key. In a preferred arrangement, the punctuation<br>
auxiliary key functions like a shift key. That is, while it is actuated ("held down" in<br>
the case of mechanical keys) all punctuation keys which are also actuated ("pressed" in<br>
the case of mechanical keys) will input one of the punctuation symbols to which they are<br>
associated. An apparatus built in accordance with the teachings of this invention may<br>
comprise a second auxiliary key 1006 which when actuated in conjunction with one of<br>
the keys which inputs digits inter alia (e.g. 1003 or 1004), serves to select one of the<br>
digits associated to the digit key for input. The second auxiliary key, like the first<br>
auxiliary key, can be actuated before, after, or during the activation of the corresponding<br>
digit key in order to have its effect of selecting one of the digits for input.<br>
An apparatus built in accordance with the teachings of this invention may further<br>
comprise a third auxiliary key 1007 which when operated in conjunction with one of the keys<br>
which encodes inter alia letters (such as 1004) serves to select one or more of the letters<br>
associated to the letter key. In the apparatus depicted in Fig. 1, the letters selected are the<br>
letters CEHLNSTY, this selection is according to the invention disclosed in Gutowitz<br>
PCT/US99/29,343, which has been incorporated by reference.<br>
Operation of the Punctuation Auxiliary Key<br>
The punctuation auxiliary key 1005 is used to input punctuation symbols. Its<br>
operation will be described in reference to Fig. 2. Fig 2 describes the entry of a phrase, cu<br>
ltr :-) when the punctuation auxiliary key is used in conjunction with a multi-tap mechanism<br>
for entering letters. In the present example, the punctuation auxiliary key is embodied as a<br>
shift key, which is the preferred embodiment. That is, the punctuation auxiliary key can be<br>
held down, and as long as it is held down it produces the effect of selecting a punctuation<br>
symbol to be selected from a key encoding punctuation symbols assigned to a punctuation<br>
ordered group. Alternate methods to embody the punctuation auxiliary key include a) the<br>
punctuation auxiliary key is pressed and released: it takes effect on the next multiple-ordered<br>
group key pressed, b) the punctuation auxiliary key is pressed after the punctuation multiple-<br>
ordered group key and has effect on the multiple-ordered-group key previously pressed, c)<br>
the punctuation auxiliary key is a mode-lock key: once pressed, in remains in effect for all<br>
subsequent punctuation multiple-ordered-group key presses, until the punctuation auxiliary<br>
key is pressed again, d) the punctuation auxiliary key is represented by a length of key<br>
pressing, for instance, if a multiple-ordered-group key to which both a letter ordered group<br>
and a punctuation ordered group have been assigned is pressed rapidly, then a letter is input,<br>
while if it is pressed and held down then a punctuation symbol is entered. Further means to<br>
embody a punctuation auxiliary key according to the teachings of this invention will be<br>
evident to those skilled in the art. The same is true of other auxiliary keys to be introduced<br>
below. The essential feature of this aspect of the invention is that the punctuation auxiliary<br>
key serves to select a punctuation ordered group from the plurality of symbols, potentially<br>
including letter symbols, encoded by the multiple-ordered-group keys to which both letter<br>
and punctuation ordered groups have been assigned.<br>
For the flow chart of Fig. 2, the association of symbols with keys as shown in Fig<br>
1. is assumed, that is, one key encodes the letters abc, and the punctuation symbol ?, etc.<br>
This particular association of symbols to keys will be discussed extensively below, it<br>
contains many inventive features for which patent rights will be herein claimed.<br>
Thus, in the first step 2001 of Fig. 2, key 1004 is pressed three times to enter the<br>
letter "c", then (step 2002) key 1015 is pressed twice to input the letter "u", then (step<br>
2003) key 1001 is pressed once to input the space symbol, then (step 2004) key 1012 is<br>
pressed three times to input the letter "1", then (step 2005) key 1015 is pressed once to<br>
input the letter "t", then (step 2006) key 1014 is pressed three times to input the letter<br>
"r", then (step 2007) key 1001 is pressed once to input the space symbol, then (step 2008)<br>
the punctuation auxiliary key 1005 is pressed and held down while keys 1015, 1012, and<br>
1016 are pressed in succession (in steps 2009, 2010, and 2011) to produce the<br>
emoticon :-).<br>
Operation of the Digit Auxiliary Key<br>
An apparatus built according to the teachings of this invention may further<br>
comprise a digit auxiliary key. If at least one of the plurality of multiple-ordered-group<br>
keys of the invention have been assigned both a letter ordered group and a digit ordered<br>
group, then the digit auxiliary key operates such that when the digit auxiliary key is<br>
actuated in conjunction with one of the multiple-ordered-group keys to which both a letter<br>
ordered group and a digit ordered group have been assigned then at least one of the digits<br>
in the digit ordered group is input, and when one of multiple-ordered-group keys to which<br>
both a letter ordered group and a digit ordered group have been assigned is actuated not<br>
in conjunction with the digit auxiliary key then at least one of the letters in the ordered<br>
group of letters assigned to the multiple-ordered-group key is input.<br>
In other words, the present invention also provides for a digit auxiliary key to be<br>
used for inputting digits. Its function is similar to the punctuation auxiliary key, except<br>
that while the punctuation auxiliary key selects a punctuation symbol from a multiple-<br>
ordered-group key to which a punctuation ordered group has been assigned, the digit<br>
auxiliary key selects a digit from a multiple-ordered-group key to which a digit ordered<br>
group has been assigned. Thus, for example, if the phrase to be entered were "cu 18r :-)" it<br>
could be input as shown in Fig. 3. Steps 3001-3004 of Fig. 3 are identical to steps 2001-<br>
2004 of Fig. 2, and serve to input "cu 1", in step 3005, the digit auxiliary key 1006 is<br>
actuated such that when key 1015 is actuated in step 3006, the digit 8 is input. In step<br>
3007, the digit auxiliary key 1006 is released. Then, in step 3008, key 1001 is pressed<br>
once so that a space is input. Then, in step 3009, key 1005 is pressed and held to select<br>
the punctuation ordered groups. Then, in step 3010, key 1015 is pressed once to input":".<br>
Then, in step 3011, key 1012 is pressed once to input "-", and finally in step 3012, key<br>
1016 is pressed once to input")".<br>
Operation of the Disambiguation Auxiliary Key<br>
Some embodiments of the present invention may provide a disambiguation<br>
auxiliary key whose purpose is to select certain letters for input unambiguously. The<br>
selection of the letters to be input may be done according to the invention disclosed in<br>
Gutowitz "343, but, according to the present invention, may be chosen according to any<br>
scheme. For the purposes of illustration, we will use the scheme of Gutowitz "343, in<br>
which the letters CEHLNSTY are selected from the keys 2-9 respectively. In the<br>
invention disclosed in Gutowitz "343, the other letters are selected by predictive software.<br>
Thus, returning to the example phrase "cu 18r :-)", and referring to Fig. 4, we see that the<br>
phrase can be entered with the help of the punctuation, digit, and disambiguation<br>
auxiliary keys as follows: In step 4001, the disambiguation auxiliary key 1007 is actuated,<br>
along with the key 1004. This inputs the letter "c". In step 4002, the disambiguation<br>
auxiliary key 1007 is released, and then in step 4003 key 1015 is actuated. Thanks to the<br>
predictive software, activation of key 1015 inputs the letter "u". Then, in step 4004, key<br>
1001 is actuated to input a space. Actuation of key 1007 in conjunction with key 1012<br>
inputs "1" in step 4005. Key 1007 is then released in step 4006. Actuation of the digit<br>
auxiliary key 1006 (step 4007) in conjunction with key 1015 inputs the digit 8 (step<br>
4008). Step 4008 is completed by the release of key 1006. Then, in step 4009, key 1014<br>
is actuated upon which, thanks to the predictive software, the letter "r" is entered. In step<br>
4010, key 1001 is pressed once to enter the space symbol. Then (step 4011) key 1005 is<br>
pressed and held to select the punctuation ordered groups. Then (step 4012) key 1015 is<br>
pressed once to input ":". Then (step 4013) key 1012 is pressed once to input "-". Then<br>
(step 4014) key 1016 is pressed once to input ")".<br>
Operation of the Fourth Auxiliary Key (Capitalization Key)<br>
The fourth auxiliary key 1009 is used to input capital letters. As in the case of the first,<br>
second, and third auxiliary keys, the fourth auxiliary key is operated in conjunction with other<br>
keys in order to perform an input action. As in the case of these other auxiliary keys, the fourth<br>
auxiliary key might be actuated before, after, or during the activation of said other key in order to<br>
perform the required action. In a preferred arrangement, the fourth auxiliary key is actuated after<br>
the other key in order to perform the action of capitalization. Thus, if it is desired to input the<br>
capital letter ôCö, and an embodiment comprising a third auxiliary key is used as described in<br>
Fig. 4, then the third auxiliary key 1007 would be actuated in conjunction with key 1004 to input<br>
"c", then the fourth auxiliary key 1009 would be actuated in change the lower-case "c" to an<br>
upper-case "C". The advantage of this arrangement is that it permits a novel and unobvious<br>
ergonomic extension of the capitalization action. Thus, the present invention provides for a new<br>
action, the "CapW" (Capitalize Word) action. The CapW action is obtained when some other<br>
auxiliary key is operated in conjunction with the capitalization key 1009. Preferably, said other<br>
auxiliary key is the disambiguation key 1007, if present. This preference arises from the<br>
observation that capitalization is only relevant for letters, not digits or punctuation symbols, so it<br>
is natural to associate a capitalization action with another key acting to input letters.<br>
Capitalization needs may arise in several ways, for instance, the first letter of a word may need to<br>
be capitalized if the word is a proper noun: Fred. Or, the word may need to be entirely<br>
capitalized, if it is an acronym: FRED. Other patterns of capitalization, such as every other letter<br>
capitalized, might be required in other circumstances: DoCoMo. The CapW key provides the<br>
ability to supply at least one capitalization pattern. Once the patterns are defined, repeated<br>
activation of the CapW key scrolls through the available patterns.<br>
For instance, assume that three patterns are defined, capitalize first letter,<br>
capitalize all letters, and uncapitalize all letters. Then, referring to Fig. 5, we disclose the<br>
steps to be taken to input the capitalized letter sequence FRED. In step 5001, "fred" is<br>
entered. This input could be by any means, multi-tap, predictive, or other. Then, in step<br>
5006, the CapW key 1009 is actuated, to apply the capitalization pattern of capitalizing<br>
the first letter of a word. This activation is preferably by operation of key 1007<br>
substantially simultaneously with key 1009. This first activation of the CapW key after<br>
the sequence "fred" is entered produces the sequence "Fred" (5002). A second activation<br>
of the CapW key in step 5007 applies the capitalization pattern to capitalize all letters to<br>
produce the sequence "FRED"(5003). If the user then decides to cancel all capitalization,<br>
another consecutive activation of the CapW key (5004) will return the input to the<br>
uncapitalized word "fred" (5005) by applying the capitalization pattern to uncapitalize all<br>
letters. Another capitalization pattern to capitalize every other letter is applied at step<br>
5009 to produce FrEd (5005).<br>
Operation of the Fifth Auxiliary Key(Symbol Advance Key<br>
The symbol advance key, or "next" key 1002, provides the action of selecting symbols by<br>
advancing in an order defined on a group of symbols. That is, if symbols al,a2,..., an are<br>
arranged in an ordered group, then a2 follows al, a3 follows a2, and so on. Typically, an<br>
ordered group will have a circular order, so that al follows an. An ordered group may<br>
include all of the symbols on a key, or only a subset of the symbols on a key. The<br>
collection of symbols into ordered groups is an important design decision in the<br>
construction of reduced keyboards. For instance, consider the case of key 1015. This key<br>
encodes three letters t,u, and v, a digit, 8, and a punctuation symbol colon (:). It might<br>
also encode other symbols, such as the semi-colon symbol (;), which are not displayed on<br>
the face of the key. These symbols could all be placed in a single order, for instance<br>
tuv8:;, or in ordered groups, such as all letters in one group, and all digits and<br>
punctuation in a second group. According to the teachings of this invention, the division of<br>
symbols into groups is governed by the presence and type of auxiliary keys. For instance, an<br>
apparatus which provides only a punctuation key should provide symbols divided into two<br>
groups. One group contains symbols input when the punctuation key is actuated, and the other<br>
contains symbols which are input when the punctuation key is not actuated. Thus, in this<br>
example, the symbols t,u, and v could be in one ordered group, and the symbols 8:; could be in<br>
another ordered group. Referring now to Fig. 7, we see that at step 7001, a punctuation key has<br>
been added to the apparatus, dividing the ordered group into two ordered groups as just<br>
described. If a disambiguation key is also present, and the disambiguation key serves to select the<br>
letter t, then the groups should be: (t)(uv)(8:;). The splitting effect of the addition of the<br>
disambiguation key is shown at step 7002. Finally, if a digit key is also provided, then the groups<br>
should be (t)(uv)(8)(:;). The splitting effect of the digit key is shown at step 7003. The effect of<br>
this aspect of the invention is that the addition of each auxiliary key reduces the size of the<br>
ordered groups, limiting the multi-tap depth, a desirable advantage of this invention. Fig 7 also<br>
explains the effect of the symbol advance key. Before ordered group splitting at step 7001, the<br>
symbol advance key inputs the symbols tuv8:; in order, as the symbol advance key is actuated<br>
multiple times in succession. Then, after the ordered group split due to the punctuation key, the<br>
symbol advance key inputs either the symbols tuv in order, or the symbols 8:; in order depending<br>
on whether the punctuation key has not or has been actuated, respectively.<br>
Thus, referring to Fig. 6 a method for generating typable devices according to the<br>
teachings of this invention comprises the steps of:<br>
 6001 selecting a plurality of symbolsto be input,<br>
6002 assigning a plurality of said plurality of symbols to ordered groups,<br>
6003 assigning said ordered groups to keys such that at least one key is assigned more<br>
than one ordered group, and such that each key is effective to input members of said assigned<br>
ordered groups.<br>
If the typable device has at least one auxiliary key then some of the ordered groups can be<br>
associated to the auxiliary key or keys, so that the method can further comprise step, and<br>
6004 assigning one or more of said assigned ordered groups to an auxiliary key engaged<br>
with said keys assigned ordered groups such that when said auxiliary key is actuated in<br>
conjunction with said keys assigned ordered groups then one of said assigned ordered groups is<br>
selected preferentially for input.<br>
Integration of Predictive Mechanisms<br>
It is a desirable feature of this invention to limit the number of keystrokes required to<br>
enter any symbol (the worst case), and to decrease the expected number of key strokes to enter<br>
most symbols (the average case). Each additional auxiliary key helps further reduce the<br>
worst-case number of keystrokes, whether the symbol advance is accomplished by multiple<br>
pressing of a key, or, preferably using an auxiliary symbol advance key. It is evident to one<br>
skilled in the art that the process of adding additional auxiliary keys could be carried to the<br>
extreme in which every symbol is entered unambiguously using a symbol key in conjunction<br>
with an auxiliary key. The problem with this is that in the case of reduced keyboards, the number<br>
of keys which can be incorporated is highly limited. In most cases, ordered groupings will <br>
 contain more than one symbol. If there are statistical regularities in the occurrences of symbols<br>
within an ordered group, then software can be designed to predict which symbol should<br>
preferentially occur in any given context. Examples of such software have been previously cited.<br>
In every case, the function of the software is to change the ordering within an ordered group.<br>
Thus, in the case of the key 1015, predictive software might determine that the ordered group<br>
(uv) should be ordered (vu) in certain circumstances. For example, if the letters "wea" had been<br>
previously entered, then "v" is more likely intended when the key 1015 is pressed, since "weave"<br>
is a word in English, but no word begins "weau". Similarly, for the punctuation ordered group (:;)<br>
there may be contexts in which a semi-colon is more likely than a colon, and thus, in that context,<br>
semi-colon should be first in the ordering. As an example, it could be that the emoticon;-) is<br>
more common than the emoticon :-). If so, predictive software may determine that when it<br>
encounters an activation of the key 1015 with the punctuation key actuated, and followed by<br>
activations of keys 1012 and 1016 with the punctuation key actuated, then semi-colon should be<br>
input rather than colon. This will input the emoticon;-), which, in this example, was probably<br>
intended by the user.<br>
Thus, the present invention allows for either a multi-tap method or, equivalently, a<br>
symbol advance key, or a predictive system, or all of the above to be used to select symbols<br>
within an ordered group. It is, indeed, a unique feature of this invention to allow both a multi-tap<br>
method and a predictive method to co-exist seamlessly within a single apparatus.<br>
Returning to the example phrase "cu 8r :-)", and referring now to Fig. 6, we see that the<br>
phrase can be entered with the help of the first, second, and third auxiliary keys as follows, using<br>
either using a symbol advance key or predictive software: In step 6001, the third auxiliary key<br>
1007 is actuated, and the key 1004 is actuated as well. This inputs the letter "c". In step 6002, the<br>
third auxiliary key 1007 is released, and in step 6003 key 1015 is actuated. In this example, we<br>
will assume that 1) in the present context the ordered group input by the 1015 key is (vu), and 2)<br>
predictive software is provided such that when a space is entered directly after the key 1015 is<br>
actuated, then v is changed into a u. Then, in step 6003, a v will be input, but, when space is<br>
entered in step 6004, using the 1001 key, the v will be changed into a u. If desired by the user, a u<br>
could also be obtained by substitution of an alternate step 6004(alt), in which the symbol advance<br>
key 1002 is actuated to change the v into a u before proceeding to enter a space. In either case,<br>
the phrase can be completed in the same way as disclosed in Fig. 4.<br>
This seamless integration of multi-tap and predictive methods has the advantage that the user can<br>
decide, at any given moment, to trust the predictive system to produce the desired result once<br>
sufficient context has been provided, or take direct control of the input using the symbol advance <br>
key, or its multi-tap equivalent action.<br>
Basic Punctuation Symbol Set<br>
As previously recited, it is an important aspect of the present invention to reduce the<br>
average-case number of keystrokes required to input symbols. In the case of input of punctuation, <br>
it is important, therefore, to distribute the punctuation symbols over the keys in such a way that<br>
the most-common symbols can be entered with the fewest keystrokes. By statistical analysis it<br>
has been determined that some of the most common symbols are space ( ), period(.), comma(,),<br>
apostrophe("), exclamation point(!), question mark(?), underscore (_), hyphen (-), left parenthesis<br>
((), right parenthesis ()), colon(:), at sign (@), slash (/), percent (%), star (*) and pound (#). All of<br>
these common symbols can be provided on a standard telephone key pad augmented with a<br>
punctuation key and a disambiguation key in such a way that each takes only one keystroke to<br>
enter. This symbols will be referred to as the basic symbol set. Though the basic symbol set was<br>
determined through statistical analysis, and is our preferred embodiment of this symbol set, it is <br>
evident to one skilled in the art that one or more of the symbols could be substituted for other<br>
symbols without escaping the scope of this invention. The essential feature of the basis symbol<br>
set is that they are most common punctuation symbols. The basic punctuation symbol set is<br>
sufficient to provide enough punctuation to support short messaging applications, as well as the<br>
entry of email addresses and most URLs . A secondary symbol set can be defined including the<br>
symbols tab, &amp;, $,;, {,},[,],~,",",|,\, and so on. Input of symbols in the secondary symbol set will<br>
be discussed below.<br>
Preferred association of the elements of the basic symbol set<br>
with the keys of a standard telephone keypad<br>
In the application of the present invention to improvement of the standard telephone<br>
keypad, implementation decisions must be made as to 1) which symbols to associate to which<br>
keys, and 2) in the case in which a given key has more than one ordered group, which group to<br>
include the symbol in. The present teachings allow for a wide variety of choices. In view of our<br>
presently available information, the following choices are optimal.<br>
Period, comma and space. These very common symbols occur with greater frequency<br>
than many letters do. In a preferred embodiment, space is placed on the 1001 key and period on<br>
the 1003 key. To enter this symbols, no associated activation of an auxiliary key is required.<br>
Comma is also placed on the 1003 key. In the case that no disambiguation key is present, comma<br>
is in an ordered group with period, that is, the ordered group comprising (.,). In the case that a<br>
disambiguation key is present, comma is in its own ordered group, and selected using the<br>
disamiguation key.<br>
Star and pound. The placement of these symbols is dictated by ISO convention. In the<br>
f.<br>
preferred embodiment of this invention, they are associated with the 1001 and the 1002<br>
key respectively.<br>
Apostrophe. In English, The apostrophe is a punctuation symbol with particularly<br>
strong statistical correlations with letters. This property allows predictive software to do a<br>
good job on predicting its occurrence in symbol strings. Thus, it can be included in an<br>
ordered group comprising letters. In a preferred embodiment, it is placed on the 1012 key,<br>
in the ordered grouping comprising letters on that key. In other languages, other<br>
punctuation symbols may be subject to the same treatment.<br>
The Ten Numeric-like punctuation symbols. There are 10 common punctuation<br>
symbols which can be put into a close one-to-one correspondence with the digits. This<br>
correspondence is based on morphic similarity of the symbols in common fonts. That is,<br>
exclamation point(!) is similar in form to the digit 1, question mark(?) is similar in form<br>
to the digit 2, % is similar in form to the digit 3, underscore (_) is similar in form to part<br>
of the digit 4., hyphen (-) is similar in form to part of the digit 5, left parenthesis (() is<br>
similar in form to part of the digit 6, slash (/) is similar in form to part of the digit 7,<br>
colon(:) is similar in form to part of the digit 8, right parenthesis ()) is similar in form to<br>
part of the digit 9, and the at sign (@) is similar in form to the digit 0. The standard<br>
telephone keypad assigns the digits 1, 2, 3-9 and 0 to the keys 1003, 1004, 1010-1016<br>
and 1017 respectively. Thus, according to the assignment determined by the preferred<br>
embodiment of this invention, the punctuation symbols !?%_-(/:)@ are assigned to the<br>
keys 1003, 1004, 1010-1016 and 1017 respectively.<br>
Morphic Overlap<br>
One of the surprising and highly useful features of the just described association of<br>
punctuation symbols to digits is that the morphic similarity allows punctuation symbols<br>
and digits to occupy substantially the same keypad surface real estate. By superimposing<br>
each digit with its associated punctuation symbol, very small keys can be labeled in such<br>
a way as to make both the digits and the punctuation symbols visible. The visually<br>
marked presence of all symbols which may be entered allows beginning users to scan the<br>
keys to find either their desired digit or punctuation symbol. Further, it increases ease of<br>
learning, since the morphic similarity helps the user remember which key is associated<br>
with which symbols. By proper coloring, lighting with an illumination apparatus, font<br>
design, and other visual means, both superimposed digit and superimposed punctuation<br>
symbol can be made clearly visually distinct on the keypad, even though they are<br>
superimposed on the keypad. Though this invention does not require punctuation symbols<br>
to be overlapped with associated digits, it teaches how to do so if desired. Association of<br>
the digits with the punctuation symbols increases discoverability of the keypad, as does<br>
proper use of visual cues. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the color of the<br>
digit labels is the same as the color of the digit key, the color of the punctuation symbol<br>
labels is the same as the color of the punctuation key, and the color of the labels of<br>
unambiguous letters selected by the disambiguation key is the same the color of the<br>
disambiguation key itself.<br>
Figure 9A shows an illumination apparatus 9000 representing backlighting of the<br>
keypad of Fig 1 1000, with the backlighting turned off. In this embodiment, some<br>
punctuation symbols are printed on translucent material or simply cut out of the key<br>
material, so they appear dark when the backlight is turned off. Fig. 9B shows the same<br>
illumination apparatus 9000 and the same keypad 1000 with the backlight turned on,<br>
causing the punctuation symbols printed on translucent material to appear more brightly,<br>
in lower contrast to the digit labels on the same key in substantially the same location<br>
superimposed on the keypad.<br>
The Secondary Symbol Set<br>
Thus far, we have placed 15 punctuation symbols in a preferred arrangement on<br>
the telephone keypad. However, the standard desktop keyboard may encode 32 or<br>
more punctuation symbols. Continuing the application of the morphic similarity<br>
aspect of the teachings of this invention, most of these can be conveniently<br>
associated to keys on the telephone keypad in a way which maintains<br>
discoverability, reduced worst - case keystroke number, and reduced average case<br>
keystroke number. The placement of these secondary symbols provides graduated<br>
discoverability. Once the user has discovered how the primary symbols are associated to the<br>
digits through morphic similarity, they can accurately guess where other symbols are placed,<br>
even if there is no visual marker of the association of these secondary symbols with keys. For<br>
example, once the principle of morphic similarity has been discovered, it can be guessed that the<br>
semi-colon (:) should be associated to the key 1015, which is labeled with a colon (:). If the<br>
semi-colon is placed an ordered group with colon (:;) then the user, once he or she has understood<br>
that the symbol advance key works to advance in the symbol order, will understand that to obtain<br>
a semi-colon, the punctuation keyl005 must be actuated in conjunction with the 1015 key, and<br>
then the symbol advance key 1002 must be actuated. This is the essence of discoverability:<br>
allowing the user to extend experience gained from operation of one aspect of the mechanism to<br>
operation of other aspects of the invention.<br>
In the same way, the pipe symbol (|) can be placed in an ordered group with the<br>
exclamation point (!), the back-slash (\) placed in an ordered group with slash (/), and so on to<br>
form the groups (([{"), (-=+), (") (which group may additionally contain letters), and<br>
(~^). These latter associations are not as morphically strong as the previous associations<br>
described, and they also contain less frequently used symbols. Thus, a keypad designer has some<br>
freedom to chose the location of the symbols, and may even chose to leave these symbols out<br>
entirely. On keypads which include keys beyond the 12 keys of the standard keypad, some of the<br>
keys may be used to encode more common secondary symbols. For instance, in the embodiment<br>
of Fig. 1, the &amp; symbol is associated with the back-space functional symbol on key 1008, and the<br>
$ symbol is associated with the Caps/CapW functional symbols on key 1009.<br>
Functional Morphology<br>
Some punctuation and functional symbols, such as tab or backspace, have no morphic<br>
representation, and morphic similarity is not a placement guide, Thus placement of these symbols<br>
requires an abstraction of morphic similarity. Thus space, newline, backspace, and tab bear some<br>
family resemblance in that each serves to manipulate the location of the next symbol to be input.<br>
Given this teaching of association of symbols by functional morphology, various schemes may <br>
be employed to embody associations according to these teachings. A preferred choice in the<br>
application of these methods to telephone keypads is to associate newline with multiple space<br>
symbols. Thus, when the 6space keyo 1001 is pressed once, the space symbol is entered, and<br>
when it is pressed twice in succession, a space and then a newline is entered. Each additional<br>
successive press of key 1001 produces additional newlines. An alternative embodiment might,<br>
for instance, have one press input the space symbol, two presses input a tab symbol, and each<br>
subsequent press input a tab symbol.<br>
Auxiliary keys, when present, can also be used to distinguish members of a family bound<br>
by functional morphologic similarity. For instance, a digit key actuated in conjunction with a<br>
space key could represent a tab symbol, in as much as a tab is a multiple of a space. Thus, in a<br>
preferred embodiment of this invention, the digit key 1006 actuated in conjunction with the space<br>
key 1001 produces the tab functional symbol. If another auxiliary key is present, such as the<br>
disambiguation key 1007, it could be actuated in conjunction with the space key to produce a<br>
backspace. This is not the mechanism chosen in the preferred embodiment shown in Fig. 1.<br>
There, a separate key, 1008, is used to input backspace. This illustrates an alternate mechanism to<br>
key to be devoted to this purpose, and if they do not, the key 1007-1001 combination for<br>
inputting backspace is preferred.<br>
Predictive Punctuation<br>
It has already been pointed out that punctuation symbol s may have sufficient statistical<br>
correlation with other symbols, such as letters, to allow predictive mechanisms to operate to<br>
reduce the expected number of keystrokes in a non-trivial way, The preferred embodiment of this<br>
invention disclosed herein has an aspect which lends itself to the predictive approach to the entry<br>
of punctuation symbols. In the preferred embodiment, punctuation symbols which are<br>
mophologically similar to the left parenthesis symbol: (ææ[{ and 
digit 6, and symbols morphologically similar to the right parerithesis symbol )ö]} and &gt; are<br>
associated in turn to the digit 9. Left-parenthesis-like symbols have a functional-morphological<br>
relationship with right parenthesis like symbols in that left-parenthesis-like symbols often occur<br>
in matching pairs with right-parenthesis-like symbols. This pair-matching property can be used to<br><br>
reduce the expected number of keystrokes required to enter these symbols. Consider entry of the<br>
sentence: <so then we>. If the ordered punctuation group on the 6 key is ("[{
the ordered group on the 9 key is )"]}&gt;, then using a symbol advance key to enter the<br>
parenthesis-like symbols would require: five keystrokes to enter 
keystroke to enter ), two keystrokes to enter ", two keystrokes to enter ", and five keystrokes to<br>
enter &gt;, for a total of 16 keystrokes. However, according to the teachings of this invention the<br>
order of the right parenthesis -like symbols can be set as a function of the left-parenthesis-like<br>
symbols in such a way as to reduce the number of keystrokes. A simple rule which accomplishes<br>
 this is: the first symbol in the right-parenthesis-like ordered group should match the last-entered<br>
unmatched symbol in the left-parenthesis-like group. Applying this rule we have: five keystrokes<br>
to enter 
parenthesis, the last entered unmatched left-parenthesis-like symbol. This left-parenthesis-like<br>
symbol is now matched, and the last-entered unmatched left-parenthesis-like symbol is now 
two keystrokes to enter " (which becomes the new last-entered left-parenthesis-like symbol), one<br>
keystrokes to enter "(this now matches "), and one keystrokes 1o enter &gt; (matching the remaining<br>
unmatched left-parenthesis-like symbol 
average number of keystrokes per parenthesis-like symbol has dropped from nearly 3 to less than<br>
2, even though the worst-case remains 5 keystrokes per symbol. Even though the parenthesis-like<br>
ordered groups of symbols are large compared to other ordered groups, thanks to the pairing<br>
property of these symbols, the expected number of keystrokes can be kept small on these ordered<br>
groups.<br>
Treatment of accented letters<br>
The preferred embodiment of this invention extends the property of graduated<br>
discoverability to the treatment of accented letters. Many languages contain letters with accents,<br>
and any given letter may occur with many accents, depending on the language. Further depending<br>
on the language, consonants and/or vowels may be accented. While languages based on the<br>
roman alphabet can generally be read in the absence of accents, inclusion of accents increases the<br>
comfort of the native speaker of the language with the text being entered. Provision of<br>
mechanisms to enter accented letters on a reduced keyboard is thus highly desirable, and it<br>
further desired to make entry of these accented letters as easy as possible.<br>
Predictive mechanisms can be employed to reduce the number of keystrokes required to<br>
enter accented letters, even when there are many accented letters, each accepting many accents.<br>
As in the treatment of digits, punctuation symbols and unaccented letters, the over-riding<br>
concerns for the machines built according to the teachings of this invention are reduction in<br>
keystroke number (an aspect of ease-of-use), and discoverability (an aspect of ease of learning).<br>
Discoverability is increased when familiar letter categories are used to help assign letters to keys.<br>
The method taught by the preferred embodiment of this invention for treating accented letters is<br>
to place accented consonants on the same key as their unaccented counterparts, and to place<br>
accented vowels together all on the same key, or on a few keys distinct from those keys which<br>
are used to input the unaccented vowels. Extensive numerical studies performed by the inventors<br>
show that this placement is not only easy to learn, it also is near optimal for reducing the number<br>
of keystrokes required to enter accented letters when predictive mechanisms are use to select<br>
accented letters for input priority.When applying these ideas to telephone keypads, it must be<br>
borne in mind that only a small number of symbols can be displayed on the surface of any key. In<br>
general, for most western european languages, the frequency of accented vowels is greater than<br>
the frequency of accented consonants. Therefore, in the treatment of these languages, it is<br>
preferable to represent the accented vowels on the key surface, but suppress the representation of<br>
accented consonants. In the preferred embodiment of this invention, key 1017 is used to input all<br>
accented vowels. It is to be noted that placing all accented vowels on a single key could result in<br>
quite large ordered groups. For example, for some languages, the ordered group might include<br>
e"e"e^ a"a"a^, etc. (here the accent mark is written after the letter to which it applies). In these<br><br>
cases, it may be impossible to represent all of the accented letters on the face of a small key in<br>
such a way that they are visible to the unaided human eye. To alleviate this problem, an abstract<br>
form representing the plurality of available accents is preferred to concrete and detailed markings<br>
representing the individual accented letters. In Fig 1. this abstract form is an overbar over all of<br>
the vowels, though other arrangements will be evident to one skilled in the art.<br>
It is further disclosed that both the placement of the accented letters and the abstract form<br>
representing accents can be integrated according to the teachings of this invention with the action<br>
of the disambiguation key such that the action of the disambiguation key on accented letters, if<br>
any, is easily discoverable. In Fig 1. it is revealed that the portion of the overbar which is over the<br>
letter e is visually distinct from the other portions of the overbar, and that the e itself shares a<br>
visual character (color, shading, font or other visual cue) relating it to the overbar, and to the<br>
disambiguation key. This visual relation system guides the user to understand that the<br>
disambiguation key should be actuated in conjunction with the 1017 key in order to input any<br>
accented e.<br>
Visual Display as an Aid to Discovery<br>
On phones with visual display screens it is possible to further guide the user to discover<br>
the keystroke combinations required to enter any symbol, even :hose which do not appear as<br>
explicit labels on the keypad. Recall that the symbols on a key are arranged in one or more<br>
ordered groups. The number of ordered groups is a function of the number of auxiliary keys <br>
which can operate in conjunction with the symbol key. Typically one of the ordered groups is the<br>
ordered group which is operative when the symbol key is pressed non-conjointly with some<br>
auxiliary key. In the preferred embodiment of this invention, as revealed in Fig. 1, key 1015<br>
encodes the following four ordered groups (8)(:;)(t)(uv). The groups are selected by the digit key,<br>
the punctuation key, the disambiguation key, and no auxiliary key respectively. A beginning user<br>
may not understand how to use the auxiliary keys, and if an apparatus is fully discoverable, then<br>
the user will be guided to the correct actions without the need of verbal or written<br>
instruction. Imagine now that the digit key is a given color (say blue) and the digits on the<br>
symbol keys are also blue, the punctuation key is green and the punctuation symbols on<br>
the symbol keys are also green, the disambiguation key is red, and the disambiguated<br>
letters are also red, and that letters which are not affected by the disambiguation key are<br>
also black. Then, when a beginning user presses key 1015 they will see a display in which<br>
different ordered groups are displayed in different colors. The different colors displayed<br>
for the different groups provides the user with an indication as to 1) which auxiliary key<br>
to press to obtain the desired symbol, and 2) helps the user identify the symbols which are<br>
not explicitly labeled on the keys themselves. It will be evident to one skilled in the art<br>
that other visual cues such as shading or font style could be used instead of color to mark<br>
the ordered groups and their associated auxiliary keys. Indeed, referring now to Fig. 8, we<br>
see a visual display 8000 which has one ordered group 8001, containing "t" labeled in<br>
black, a second ordered group 8002, containing "uv" labeled in gray, a third ordered<br>
group 8003, containing the digit 8, in gray italic, and a final ordered group 8004<br>
containing the punctuation symbols colon and semi-colon, labeled with an underline.<br>
The Fix Key<br>
The fix key functionality is specific to embodiments which incorporate a<br>
particular type of predictive text mechanism. Though commonly referred to in the art as<br>
"predictive" these mechanisms are also characterized as retroactive in that the display and<br>
input of symbols may be revised in light of subsequently entered symbols. When using<br>
such retroactive mechanisms, the means to block or undo these retroactive changes may<br>
be desirable. The fix key supplies these means. Whenever it is activated, the last<br>
retroactive change is undone. The fix key is designed to simplify the typing of non-words.<br>
A mode in which the predictive software can perform retroactive changes will be<br>
called automatic mode, and a mode in which retroactive changes cannot occur will be called<br>
manual mode. Beginning users may enter manual mode (by tapping next in automatic mode)<br>
whenever they encounter a word, such as a URL, not likely to be in a dictionary or reference list<br>
of words. While this is the safest approach to entering non-words, it may also throw away some<br>
of the power of automatic mode. Automatic mode may be capable of correctly entering many<br>
non-words, and require no extra taps per letter to do so, whereas manual mode may require a few<br>
extra taps on these words. The more sophisticated approach to entering non-words is to begin<br>
typing them in automatic mode, and only enter manual mode if something goes astray.<br>
Automatic mode will have gone astray if it retroactively changes letters which were correct<br>
before the retroactive change. When that happens, the user can press the fix key to 1) cancel the<br>
retroactive change, and 2) enter manual mode. An example where this might occur is when the<br>
user wishes to type a name in English of non-English origin, such as "Quader". When this word<br>
is input in automatic mode, the first 4 letters "quad" may appear correctly. However, upon<br>
pressing the "e" key, the display may changes to "pubde". At this point, the user can press the fix<br>
key to obtain "quade", and then complete the word in manual mode to obtain "quader".<br>
Integration of Symbol Advance and Predictive Text Mechanisms<br>
It has been revealed that the present invention allows for members of an ordered group to<br>
be selected either using the symbol advance key or predictive text mechanisms or both. It has<br>
also been revealed that a fix key can aid in a particular integration of predictive and multi-tap (or<br>
symbol-advance-key) mechansims. In general, a good predictive text mechanism can be relied on<br>
to correctly enter sequences of letters which are common in a language. However, some<br>
sequences, such as URLs or email addresses may be beyond the predictive power of the<br>
algorithm. If the user desires to enter such a sequence, they may be required to wrest control from<br>
the predictive mechanism to enter the sequence using the potentially more laborious, but more<br>
certain method afforded by the symbol advance key (or, equivalently, a multi-tap method).<br>
According to the teachings of this aspect of this invention, when, in the course of entering a<br>
sequence of letters bounded by punctuation, a user activates the symbol advance key then for the<br>
remainder of the sequence, until the next punctuation symbol, the predictive mechanism will be<br>
prevented from making retroactive changes to the letter sequence being entered. The non-obvious<br>
reason for this restriction is that when the user activates the symbol advance key they are<br>
manifesting a desire to more closely control the behavior of the text-entry mechanism, and to not<br>
leave decisions as to which letter to display to predictive software. The situation is similar to a<br>
driver of an automatic-shift car moving into manual-shift mode when driving on a slippery patch<br>
of road. When a punctuation symbol (typically a space symbol) is entered, this signals that the<br>
user has completed the difficult or unusual sequence, and full operation of the predictive software<br>
is restored.<br>
In conclusion, it is noted that many modifications to the embodiments discussed in this<br>
specification will be evident to one skilled in the art, the full scope of this invention can only be<br>
appreciated in reference to the attached claims.<br>
