New DhenvlDiperazines<br>
The invention relates to a group of novel phenyipiperazine derivatives of the formula (1):<br><br>
wherein<br>
Si is hydrogen or halogen,<br>
-	S2 and S3 are independently hydrogen, alkyi (1-6C), phenyl or benzyl,<br>
-	S4 represents two hydrogen atoms or an 0x0 group.<br>
-	S5 is H or alkyl (1-4C), and<br>
-	Y is C, O or S,<br><br><br>
wherein S1 has the above meaning and R is H, alkyI (1-4C), alkoxyalkyl! (2-6C), alkenyl (2-4C) or alkynyl (2 ), or 3) a group of the funnier<br><br>
wherein S1 has the above meaning and Z is C, O or N, or 4) a group of the formula<br><br>
wherein S1 has the above meaning, or 5) a group of the formula<br><br>
wherein S1 has the above meaning and A is O or N, linked to the piperazine ring with<br>
position 5 or 8,<br>
or 6) a group of the formula<br><br><br>
Vv'hereip. ST h3s the above meaning and S  and Sy represent hydrogen atoms or an oxo<br>
group,<br>
or 7) a group of the formula<br><br>
wherein one of the dotted lines can represent a double bond, S1 has the above meaning, and<br>
P=7=Q=n[train<br>
or        P=T=nitrogen and Q=C<br>
or        P=Q=nitrogen and T=C or C-CH3<br>
or        P=nitrogen. and T and Q are carbon<br>
or        P=nitrogen, T is carbon and Q is sulphur<br>
-	m has the value 2 to 6;<br>
-	n has the value 0-2;<br>
-	R5 and Re are independently H or alky! (1-3C); or Rs-1Re represent a group -(CH2)-p wherein p has the value 3-5, and<br>
-	R7 is alkyl (1-3C), alkoxy (1-3C), halogen or cyano; or R1+Ry (R7 at position 7 of the<br>
indole group) represent a group -(CH2)q wherein q has the value 2-4,<br>
and salts thereof, which show high affinity for the dopamine Do-receptor and are good serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI's).<br><br>
Preferred compounds of the invention are compounds having formula (i) wherein X<br>
represents a group of the fonn ia (1), (2) or (3), wherein the symbols have the<br>
meanings given above and the salts thereof.<br>
Especially preferred are compounds having formula (I) wherein X is the group with the<br>
formula (1) wherein Si=H, S2=CH3, S3=H. 84=0x0, S5=H and Y is oxygen, m is 3,<br>
R5=R6=hydrogen, n is 0 or 1 and R7 is 5-fiuoro,<br>
and the sails thereof.<br>
It has been found that the compounds according to the invention show high affinity for both the dopamine D2 receptor and the serotonin reuptake site. This combination is useful for the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders which enables a more complete treatment of all disease symptoms (e.g. positive symptoms and negative symptoms).<br>
However, some cf the compounds having fonn ia (!) show (partial) acnes activity/ at dopamine receptors making them particularly suitable for the tr3atment cf Parkinson's disease.<br>
The compounds show activity as antagonists at camions D1 receptors as they potentially antagonize apomcrphine-induced climbing behaviour in mice. The compounds also show activity as inhibitors cf serotonin reuptake, as they potentiate 5-HTP induced behaviour in mice.<br>
The compounds are active in therapeutic models sensitive to   relevant antipsychotics (e.g. the conditioned avoidance response; Van 6er Hoyden &amp; Bradford, Behave. Brain Res., 1988, 31:61-67) and antidepressants or anxiolytic (e.g. suppression of stress-induced vocalization; van deer Pole et a!., Psychopharmacoiogy, 1989, 97: 147-148).<br>
In contrast to clinically relevant dopamine D2 receptor antagonists the described compounds have a low propensity to induce catalepsy in rodents and as such are likely to induce less extrapyramida! side effects than existing antipsychotic agents.<br><br>
The inhibitory activity of serotonin reuptake inherent in these compounds may be responsible for the therapeutic effects observed in behavioral models sensitive to either antidepressants or anxiolytic.<br>
The compounds can be used for the treatment of affections or diseases of the central nervous system caused by disturbances in either the dopaminergic or serotonergic systems, for example: aggression, anxiety disorders, autism, vertigo, depression, disturbances of cognition or memory, Parkinson's disease, and in particular schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.<br>
Pharmacologically acceptable acids with which the compounds of the invention can form suitable acid addition salts are for example hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric add, and organic acids such as citric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, acetic acid, benzoic acid, p-toluene sulphonic acid, methanesulphonic acid and naphthalene sulphonic acid.<br>
When the compounds comprise a centre of chirality’s both the racemic mixture and the individual enantiomers belong to the invention.<br>
The compounds and their acid addition salts can be brought into forms suitable for administration by means of suitable processes using auxiliary substances such as liquid and solid carrier materials.<br>
The compounds having formula (1) can be prepared by reaction of a compound of the formula<br><br>
under basic conditions with a compound of the formula<br><br><br>
  the symbols have the meanings given above, and L is a so-coiled leaving group such as a halogen atom or a mesylate group.<br>

After adding ethanol (250 mi) and water (250 ml) the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. Then concentrated HCI (about 300 ml) and water were added and the mixture extracted with ethyl acetate. After washing the organic fraction with 5% NaHCOa (4x500 m.i), the solvent was removed in vacuo and the resulting oil was subjected to flash chromatografy (SiOj, eiuant PE/aceton=3/1).
