				<td>DISTRIBUTED ARCHITECTURE AND METHODS FOR<br>
BROADCAST/MULTICAST SERVICE<br>
FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
The present disclosure relates generally to communication networks providing<br>
multimedia broadcast multicast service, and more particularly to methods and<br>
apparatus for providing and receiving multimedia broadcast multicast services within<br>
a communication network coverage area.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The localized multicast approach reduces expended network resources by<br>
limiting transmissions to a geographic area defined by the radio coverage area of a<br>
base transceiver station or even smaller areas as defined by antenna coverage sectors<br>
of the base transceiver station. Multicast services in general are described in various<br>
standards such as the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), Universal Mobile<br>
Telephone System (UMTS) standards.<br>
Localized multicast is likewise generally described in the UMTS standards.<br>
The UMTS standards, Release 6, define in general, architectures and methods of<br>
operation such as a counting procedure for Multimedia Broadcast, Multicast Service<br>
(MBMS) whereby the network learns the status of mobile devices in each cell and<br>
configures Radio Bearers (RBs) based upon the learned status information.<br>
Two modes of operation are employed in the standards, namely, Point-to-Point<br>
(PTP) and Point-to-Multipoint (PTM). Under counting procedures, coverage areas<br>
having less than a preset number of users, employ PTP operation which requires setup<br>
of RBs individually per user. Conversely, coverage areas having at least the preset<br>
number of users will employ PTM for MBMS delivery wherein individual RBs are<br>
not required.<br>
For MBMS delivery using PTM, it is desirable for mobile stations, also<br>
referred to as "User Equipment" (UEs), to employ macro-diversity, that is, to employ<br>
selection combining or soft combining of multiple signal transmissions.<br>
In the case of selection combining, the "Protocol Data Units" (PDUs) from<br>
two, or more than two, cells should be generated in the same manner, although they<br><br>
need not be transmitted simultaneously. For soft combining, the PDUs from two cells<br>
should likewise be generated in the same manner and also should be transmitted<br>
simultaneously.<br>
However, the current Enhanced Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network<br>
(UTRAN) architecture incorporates cells ("Base Transceiver Stations" (BTS) or<br>
"Node Bs"), which provide scheduling and segmentation and reassembly (SAR)<br>
functions independently of any central point of control. Such architecture does not<br>
account for the UE's need to employ macro-diversity for MB MS PTM as discussed<br>
above.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Methods and apparatuses for providing a distributed architecture for MBMS<br>
delivery are provided herein.<br>
Turning now to the drawings wherein like numerals represent like<br>
components, FIG. 1 illustrates a communications network 100, with various base<br>
stations 103, each base station 103 having a corresponding coverage area 105. In<br>
general, base station coverage areas may overlap and, in general, form an overall<br>
network coverage area. An MBMS coverage area may comprise a number of base<br>
station coverage areas 105, which may form a contiguous radio coverage area.<br>
However, it is not required to have contiguous MBMS coverage and therefore the<br>
MBMS coverage area may alternatively be distributed throughout an overall network<br>
coverage area. Furthermore, each coverage area may have a number of mobile<br>
stations or UEs 109. A number of bases stations 103 will be connected to a base<br>
station controller 101 via backhaul connections 107. The base station controller and<br>
base stations form a Radio Access Network (RAN). The overall network may<br>
comprise any number of base station controllers, each controlling a number of base<br>
stations. Note that the base station controller 101 may alternatively be implemented<br>
as a distributed function among the base stations.<br>
The base stations 103 may communicate with the mobile stations 109 via any<br>
number of standard air interfaces and using any number of modulation and coding<br>
schemes. For example, E-UMTS or CDMA2000 may be employed. Further, E-<br>
UMTS may employ Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and<br>
CDMA2000 may employ orthogonal spreading codes such as the Walsh codes. Semi-<br>
orthogonal spreading codes may also be utilized to achieve additional channelization<br>
over the air interface.<br>
FIG. 2 represents the general architecture of an Enhanced Multimedia<br>
Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) network. Each E-node 211,213 corresponds to<br><br>
a base transceiver station, and is alternatively referred to as a cell. Also, the network<br>
200 illustrated in FIG. 2 will have a number of control points, referred to herein as<br>
anchors, such as anchor 207 and anchor 209, each of which may be connected to any<br>
number of E-nodes.<br>
Typically, an anchor will control a number of cells over a contiguous radio<br>
coverage area although such a schema is not required. Returning to FIG. 2, each E-<br>
nodc may have a number of mobile devices within its respective radio coverage area.<br>
In some embodiments, the Broadcast Multicast Service Center (BM-SC) provides<br>
functions for MBMS user service provisioning and delivery. The BM-SC may also<br>
serve as an entry point for content provider 203, 205 MBMS transmissions, may<br>
authorize and initiate MBMS Bearer Services within the Public Land Mobile Network<br>
(PLMN) and may schedule and deliver MBMS transmissions in some embodiments.<br>
If a Radio Link Control (RLC) function and Medium Access Control (MAC)<br>
function reside the E-nodes 211,213, a centralized Radio Resource Management<br>
(RRM) function is required to synchronize the scheduling and segmentation and<br>
reassembly (SAR) functions as well as to coordinate the RLC and MAC functions<br>
between the various E-Nodes.<br>
Assuming that a number of mobile stations within an E-node radio coverage<br>
area are configured to receive an MBMS service ("subscribed to MBMS"), then each<br>
mobile station will receive the MBMS data via PTM. The cells that have no mobile<br>
devices subscribed to MBMS, may not establish a PTM RB.<br>
It is to be understood that cells that do not have mobile stations subscribed to<br>
MBMS may still have mobile stations present with their respective radio coverage<br>
areas. Note that the radio coverage areas represented by FIG. 1 shows that radio<br>
coverage areas or cells 105 may overlap. Therefore, mobile stations are capable of<br>
communicating with, or receiving data from, several cells having overlapping areas.<br>
Therefore, mobile stations may receive transmissions from more than one cell and<br>
combine the transmissions. FIG. 2 also illustrates the concept of the "best server,"<br>
that is, the cell providing the mobile station with the best coverage at that particular<br>
time. The best server may be determined by any number of parameters such as<br><br>
signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR), bit error rate (BER), frame erasure rate<br>
(FER), or any other indicator, combination of indicators, or an indicator output from<br>
an algorithm using any one or more of the indicators as an input, all being understood<br>
by one of ordinary skill in the art. Therefore, a mobile station may receive a counting<br>
request from its best server cell in which case the mobile station may join the<br>
counting procedure by responding to the best server E-node.<br>
Therefore, returning to FIG. 1, a mobile station 109 may leave a cell having a<br>
PTM RB and move to a cell which previously did not have a PTM RB established. In<br>
this case, the mobile station may initiate PTM setup on the new best server cell.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating the primary components of a mobile<br>
station in accordance with some embodiments. Mobile station 300 comprises user<br>
interfaces 301, at least one processor 3 03, and at least one memory 311. Memory 311<br>
has storage sufficient for the mobile station operating system 305, applications 307<br>
and general file storage 309. Mobile station 300 user interfaces 301, may be a<br>
combination of user interfaces including but not limited to a keypad, touch screen,<br>
voice activated command input, and gyroscopic cursor controls. Mobile station 300<br>
has a graphical display 317, which may also have a dedicated processor and/or<br>
memory, drivers etc. which are not shown in FIG. 3.<br>
It is to be understood that FIG. 3 is for illustrative purposes only and is for<br>
illustrating the main components of a mobile station in accordance with the present<br>
disclosure, and is not intended to be a complete schematic diagram of the various<br>
components and connections therebetween required for a mobile station. Therefore, a<br>
mobile station may comprise various other components not shown in FIG. 3 and still<br>
be within the scope of the present disclosure.<br>
Returning to FIG. 3, the mobile station 300 may also comprise a number of<br>
transceivers such as transceivers 313 and 315. Transceivers 313 and 315 may be for<br>
communicating with various wireless networks using various standards such as, but<br>
not limited to, UMTS, CDMA2000,802.11, 802.16, etc.<br><br>
Memory 311 is for illustrative purposes only and may be configured in a<br>
variety of ways and still remain within the scope of the present disclosure. For<br>
example, memory 311 may be comprised of several elements each coupled to the<br>
processor 303. Further, separate processors and memory elements may be dedicated<br>
to specific tasks such as rendering graphical images upon a graphical display. In any<br>
case, the memory 31 lwill have at least the functions of providing storage for an<br>
operating system 305, applications 307 and general file storage 309 for mobile station<br>
300. In some embodiments, applications 307 may comprise a software stack that<br>
communicates with a stack in the E-node.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 4, mobile station, E-node, and anchor architectures in<br>
accordance with the various embodiments are illustrated. Mobile stations, or User<br>
Equipment (UE) 401 comprises a stack having a Radio Link Controller (RLC) 407, a<br>
Medium Access Controller (MAC) 409, and a Physical Layer (PHY) 411.<br>
E-Node 403 similarly has an RLC 415, MAC 417 and PHY 419. However, E-<br>
Node 403 additionally in the various embodiments has MBMS Transmission Control<br>
Function (TCF) 413. Likewise, anchor 405 has an MBMS-TCF 421.<br>
In the various embodiments, the MBMS-TCF provides resource allocation and<br>
scheduling profiles for MBMS service to each cell and also provides a segmentation<br>
and reassembly (SAR) profile. FIG. 5 is a signal flow diagram illustrating high level<br>
operation related to the MBMS-TCF in accordance with the various embodiments.<br>
In FIG. 5, BM-SC 507 may send an MBMS notification 509 to the various E-<br>
nodes such as E-Node 503. The notification 509 may comprise a service identifier<br>
corresponding to the particular provider MBMS, and also a session identifier wherein<br>
multiple sessions may be available.<br>
The E-Node 503 will then broadcast a counting request 511 to UE 501 and all<br>
UEs within the E-Node 503 radio coverage area. The counting request may comprise<br>
a service identifier corresponding to the particular provider MBMS, and also a session<br>
identifier in the case of multiple available sessions. The counting request may further<br>
include additional information such as an initial probability factor, Temporary Mobile<br><br>
Group Identity (TMGI), session identifier, and further in some embodiments a Signal-<br>
to-Noisc Ratio (SINR) range. Various counting methods and apparatuses that may be<br>
vised in conjunction with the various embodiments herein disclosed are described by<br>
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 11/286,799 "ADAPTIVE BEARER<br>
CONFIGURATION FOR BROADCAST/MULTICAST SERVICE USING<br>
RECEIVED RESPONSE INFORMATION" and further by U.S. Patent Application<br>
Serial No. 11/286801 "ADAPTIVE BEARER CONFIGURATION FOR<br>
BROADCAST/MULTICAST SERVICE," both of which are assigned to Motorola,<br>
Inc. and both of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Therefore in some embodiments, a "0-1" counting may be applied wherein the<br>
E-Node need not differentiate between users. In this case, the E-Node only needs to<br>
determine whether any mobile stations are within the cell that are subscribed to<br>
MBMS and, in some embodiments also whether the mobile stations have not<br>
previously received the offered MBMS transmission. For example, a counting<br>
request from the base station may comprise a service identifier corresponding to the<br>
particular provider MBMS, and also a session identifier wherein multiple sessions<br>
may be available. If a mobile station is subscribed to MBMS as determined by the<br>
service identifier, but has not received the current session as determined by the<br>
session identifier, the mobile station may indicate that it wants to receive the offered<br>
session. Counting requests that differentiate between various users may be used in the<br>
various embodiments alternatively, or in combination with various E-Nodes that use<br>
0-1 counting and various E-Nodes that use other counting approaches. Therefore, any<br>
counting technique may be used aad remain within the scope of the various<br>
embodiments herein disclosed.<br>
Returning to FIG. 5, the E-Nodc 503 sends its transmission request 513 to the<br>
anchor, which is handled by the anchor MBMS-TCF 505. The anchor MBMS-TCF<br>
505 generates a transmission tree structure having the E-Nodes as leaves, and thereby<br>
creates resource and scheduling profiles, and segmentation and reassembly (SAR)<br>
profiles for the E-Node 503, and other E-Nodes commonly connected to the anchor<br>
MBMS-TCF 505. The MBMS profiles 515 are then sent to the E-Node 503. The E-<br>
Node 503 may then allocate MBMS resources 517, establish a Point-to-Multipoint<br><br>
(PTM) Radio Bearer (RB), and begin MBMS data transmission 519. The MBMS<br>
resources may be, for example, one or more OFDM sub-carriers.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates the E-Node operation in accordance with, an embodiment.<br>
The E-Node receives the BM-SC service notification in block 601, and broadcasts a<br>
counting request 603 to all UEs within its radio coverage area. Any UE that wants to<br>
receive the MBMS broadcast will join the counting procedure as shown in block 605.<br>
It is to be understood that if no UE responds to the counting the procedure halts and<br>
no PTM RB may be established for MBMS from that particular E-Node.<br>
However, assuming that at least one response was received in response to the<br>
counting request, as shown in block 605, the E-Node MBMS-TCF will send the<br>
transmission request to the anchor TCF as shown in block 607.<br>
In response, the anchor TCF will send a resource scheduling profile and a<br>
SAR profile to the E-Node as shown in block 609. The E-Node will then configure<br>
its SAR function and scheduling entity based on the received profiles as shown in<br>
block 611. In block 613, the E-Node established a PTM RB and transmits.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 7, operation of an anchor is illustrated in accordance with<br>
an embodiment. In block 701 service notification is sent to all E-Nodes connected to<br>
the anchor. The anchor TCF receives the various E-Node transmission requests from<br>
E-Nodes having interested UEs. The transmission requests may included cell ID,<br>
available resource and other bearer information.<br>
In blocks 705 and 706 the anchor TCF creates resource allocation and<br>
scheduling profiles and SAR profiles for each E-Node having interested UEs. Block<br>
706 shows additional details of some embodiments, which involves creating a<br>
transmission tree structure wherein the connected E-Nodes are the leaves of the tree.<br>
This structure determines control plane (C-plane) control information transmission<br>
and may determine user plane (U-plane) data distribution in some embodiments.<br>
To accommodate soft combining by the UEs, the resource allocation will<br>
allocate identical OFDM tones (subcarriers) wherever possible based on availability.<br><br>
For scheduling, the resource may be arranged into the MBMS super-frame structure<br>
where each frame contains multiple Transmission Timing Intervals (TTIs). The<br>
MBMS-TCF may allocate the start TTI index and end TTI index per MBMS super-<br>
frame for each service. Buffering may be used as required to smooth the MBMS<br>
traffic. The SAR information may include a segmentation option, Protocol Data Unit<br>
(PDU) size, padding option, etc., and may be provided to the anchor TCF in the<br>
combing request message. The MBMS-TCF may then determine the best SAR<br>
profile for the particular service.<br>
The anchor TCF sends the profiles to the various E-Nodes as shown in block<br>
709 and performs coordination as shown in block 711. Note that if an E-Node that<br>
did not join in MBMS transmission needs to transmit later, that is, if a UE interested<br>
in the transmission enters the E-Node coverage area, the UE may request a Point-to-<br>
point (PTP) RB and receive the transmission via PTP. If MBMS PTM is already<br>
occurring and a UE subsequently enters the coverage area, a Multicast Control<br>
Channel (MCCH) will inform the UE of the ongoing service. The E-Node will send<br>
counting requests periodically for available services that may be ongoing. The E-<br>
Node may send a combing request at any subsequent time. The anchor MBMS-TCF<br>
may update the transmission tree and update the profiles in some embodiments, and<br>
subsequently transmit profiles to the newly added E-Node.<br>
When all UEs move out of a E-Node coverage area, the E-Node may turn off<br>
MBMS transmission. This case is illustrated by FIG. 8 for the various embodiments.<br>
After the interested UEs leave the E-Node coverage area, the E-Node will conduct a<br>
counting as shown in block 801. If no response is received as shown in block 803, the<br>
E-Node will send a remove request to the anchor TCF as shown in block 805. The<br>
anchor TCF will update the transmission tree structure appropriately. After receiving<br>
an acknowledgement in block 807 the E-Node may turn off MBMS transmission as<br>
shown in block 809.<br>
While the preferred embodiments have been illustrated and described, it is to<br>
be understood that the disclosure is not so limited. Numerous modifications, changes,<br>
variations, substitutions and equivalents will occur to those skilled in the art without<br><br>

A distributed architecture and method for MBMS delivery is disclosed. The various embodiments enable selection<br>
combining and soft combining by UEs for MBMS transmissions. An MBMS service notification (509) is sent to all E-Nodes (503).<br>
The E-Nodes proceed to request counting (511) from the UEs (501). A transmission request (513) is then sent to the anchor MBMS-<br>
Transmission Control Function (TCF) (505) from the E-Nodes (503). The anchor MBMS-TCF (505) generates resource allocation<br>
and scheduling profiles and segmentation and reassembly (SAR) profiles for the E-Nodes and sends the profiles (515) to the E-Nodes.<br>
The E-Nodes (503) use the profiles for resource allocation and configuration (517) and transmit MBMS data (519) in accordance<br>
with the profiles. The anchor MBMS-TCF (505) may then coordinate.</td>
