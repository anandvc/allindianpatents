Transport and storage container for liquids<br>
The invention concerns a transport and storage container for liquids with a plastic inner container, an outer jacket from a metal grate or sheet metal as well as a pallet-like base that is constructed to be handled by means of a forklift, a shelf-storage equipment or similar transport means, and has a sheet metal bottom resting on corner and central feet to support the inner container constructed with a closable filler socket and a discharge socket to connect a discharge fitting, while the inner container has a draining bottom with a central draining channel that extends with a slight fall from the rear wait of the container to the discharge socket provided on the front wall of the container to connect the discharge fitting, and the bottom of the base made to suit the bottom of the inner container is divided into two bottom sections which fall from both longitudinal edges of the bottom in the direction of the centerlines of the bottom and from the rear edge towards the front edge, and while both bottom sections have reinforcing beads the bases of said beads being situated on a common horizontal plane (EP 0 509 228 B1).<br>
The standardized transport and storage containers of this generic type available on the market have a nominal capacity of 640, 820,1000 and 1250 L.<br>
The object of the invention is to improve the construction of the generic type transport and storage container with regard to Increasing the nominal capacity without altering the external dimensions of the container as well as to reinforce the bottom of the base.<br>
This objective is achieved according to the invention by a transport and storage container for liquids having the features of patent claim 1.<br>
The sub-claims contain advantageous and useful developments of the invention.<br>
The transport and storage container for liquids according to the invention has the following advantages:<br><br><br><br>
The increase of the nominal capacity of the new container produced with various capacities while retaining the same external dimensions as those of the standardized containers available on the market, is achieved by lowering and flattening the bottom of the pallet-like base supporting the plastic inner container without impairment the ground clearance of the supporting bottom of the base for the inner container of the transport and storage container necessary for the handling of the transport and storage container by transporting means. By virtue of the new design of the supporting bottom of the base of the transport and storage container, depending on the nominal capacity an increase of capacity up to 10 L is achieved when compared with the known standardized containers. Furthermore, the stability of the supporting body Is increased by virtue of the new shape, so that the thickness of the material of the sheet metal used for the manufacture of the supporting body can be reduced and due to this the manufacturing costs can be reduced. Finally, the bottom of the base has an optimum design as far as drawing technology is concerned, so that when compared with the transport and storage containers available on the market more cost-effective materials can be used for (he bottom of he base.<br>
The transport and storage container for liquids according to the invention is explained in the following based on the figures of the drawing, showing the following:<br>
Fig.1 - a perspective illustration of the transport and storage container,<br>
Fig.2 - a perspective enlarged illustration of the bottom of the base to support the inner container of the transport container,<br>
Fig.3 - a top view on the bottom of the base according to Fig.2 in an enlarged illustration,<br>
Flgs.4-6 - simplified longitudinal sections of the bottom of the base along lines (V-IV to Vl-Vl of Fig.3, as well as<br><br>
Figs.7-12 - simplified cross-sections of the bottom of the base along lines VII-VII to XII-Xll of Fig.3.<br>
The transport and storage container 1 for liquids, that can be used as a single-use and multi-use container, has as main components a replaceable parallelepiped-shaped plastic inner container 2 with a front wall 3, a rear wall 4 and two lateral walls 5, 6, a bottom and top end 7, 8, a filler socket 9 moulded on the top end 8 that can be closed with a lid 10 and an outlet socket 12 moulded on a depression 11 in the bottom section of the front wall 3 to connect a discharge fitting 13, furthermore an outer jacket 14 constructed as a grate jacket with intersecting horizontal and vertical metal grate rods 15,16 to accommodate the inner container 2 as well as a pallet-like base 17 having longitudinal and lateral dimensions to ISO standards.<br>
The bottom end 7 of the inner container 2, constructed as a draining bottom, is symmetrically divided about the centerline 18-18 of the bottom into two bottom sections 7a, 7b, which fail from the rear wall 4 to the front wall 3 of the container 2 at a slight angle of inclination a in a range of 0-2" and from both lateral walls 5, 6 of the container to the centerline 18-18 of the bottom at a slight angle of inclination   in the range of 1-3°.<br>
The bottom 7 of the inerter container 2 has a central fiat draining channel 19 that extends with a slight fall from the rear wall 4 of the container to the outlet socket 12 provided on the front wall 3 of the container to connect the discharge fitting 13.<br>
The base 17 of the transport and storage container 1 according to Figs.2 and 3, designed to be manipulated by a forklift, shelf-storage equipment or similar transport means, has a sheet metal bottom 29 to support the inner container 2, said bottom resting on comer and central feet 20-23, 24-27 as well as on a bottom frame 28. The bottom 29 of the base 17, made to suit the bottom 7 of the inner container 2, is symmetrically divided about the centreline 30-30 of the bottom into two bottom sections 29a, 29b, which, just like the two bottom sections 7a, 7b of the inner container 2, fall gently from the rear edge 31 of the bottom to the front edge 32 of the bottom at an angle of inclination a in a range of 0-2° and<br><br>
from both lateral edges 33, 34 of the bottom 29 to the centreline 30-30 of the bottom at an angle of inclination B in the range of 1-3°.<br>
In the bottom 29 of the base 17 that is made to suit the draining bottom 7, a flat channel-like depression 35 is formed, falling from the rear edge 31 to the front edge 32 to accommodate the draining channel 19 of the bottom end 7 of the inner container 2.<br>
In the top side 36 of both bottom sections 29a, 29b of the base 17 reinforcing beads 37, 38 are embossed in both longitudinal and transverse directions, said beads protruding downward past the underside 39 of the bottom sections and the bottoms 40 of the beads are situated in a common horizontal plane 41 -41, so that the pallet-like base 17 of the transport and storage container 1 with the bottom 29 rests horizontally and consequently with a tilt-preventing stability on the forks (not illustrated) of a forklift or a shelf-storage equipment driven under the bottom.<br>
In the central region 29c of both bottom sections 29a, 29b of the bottom 29 of the base, to the underside 39 of which  a girder-like reinforcing sheet metal 42 integrally formed with the lateral central feet 26, 27 is fastened, in the underside 39 of both bottom sections 29a, 29b reinforcing beads 43 are embossed that pronged upward past the top side 36 of both bottom sections 29a, 29b and extend transversely in the bottom 29 of the base. The apex 44 of the reinforcing beads 43 serve to support both bottom sections 7a, 7b of the bottom end 7 of the inner container 2.<br>
To further reinforce the bottom, cup-shaped depressions 45 are embossed in the top side 36 of both bottom sections 29a, 29b of the bottom 29 of the base, these embossing protrude downward past the underside 39 of the bottom of the bottom sections 29a, 29b and further reinforcing beads 46 extend radially from<br>
      them.<br><br><br><br>
