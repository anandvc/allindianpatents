				<td>WIRELESS DEVICE WITH DISTRIBUTED LOAD<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to wireless devices and more<br>
specifically, to an apparatus for tuning impedance in wireless devices.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] An antenna plays an important role in providing reliable communication in a<br>
wireless device. The growing trend of incorporating antennae in the bodies of wireless<br>
devices has increased the size of the wireless devices. This trend goes against the<br>
modern norms of having smaller-sized wireless devices with increased aesthetic<br>
value. One way to increase the aesthetic value of the wireless device is to shorten the<br>
mechanical length of the wireless device. However, shortening the mechanical length<br>
of the wireless device results in shortened electrical lengths of circuit boards in the<br>
wireless devices. The shortened electrical length reduces the efficiency of the wireless<br>
device at low frequency ranges. The reduced efficiency results from the lower<br>
impedance value of the shortened electrical length, thereby leading to an ineffective<br>
resonance setting at lower frequencies.<br>
[0003] The problem of reduced efficiency is prevalent in wireless devices having<br>
multiple circuit boards, such as "clamshell" devices. This is due to the requirement for<br>
tuning the impedance of the circuit boards, and also the antenna. Additionally, one of<br>
the circuit boards incorporates the antenna, thus increasing the mechanical length of<br>
that circuit board.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0015] Before describing in detail the particular wireless device in accordance with<br>
the present invention, it should be observed that the present invention resides<br>
primarily in the components of the wireless device apparatus. Accordingly, the<br>
apparatus components have been represented where appropriate by conventional<br>
symbols in the drawings, showing only those specific details that are pertinent for an<br>
understanding the present invention so as not to obscure the disclosure with details<br>
that will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of<br>
the description herein.<br>
[0016] A wireless device with a distributed load reduces mechanical length and<br>
improves performance at low frequency bands. Exemplary wireless devices that can<br>
3<br><br>
benefit from distributed loads include devices with multiple circuit boards such as<br>
"clamshell" phones and other foldable, slider-type, or rotatable mobile<br>
communication devices. Further, multi-band wireless devices that operate at more<br>
than one frequency band can benefit from distributed loads. The introduction of a<br>
distributed load between two circuit boards of the wireless device reduces the<br>
effective electrical length needed for improved performance of the wireless device.<br>
The distributed load has an inductive coupling and a capacitive coupling. The<br>
distributed load produces adequate impedance to create parallel resonances at<br>
predetermined frequencies of interest.<br>
[0017] FIG. 1 shows an exemplary block diagram of a wireless device 100 in<br>
accordance with an embodiment. In this embodiment the wireless device is foldable,<br>
but foldability is not required. The wireless device 100 has a first circuit board 102, a<br>
second circuit board 104, and a distributed load 106. The first circuit board 102 on a<br>
first ground plane 108 inside a first printed circuit board (PCB) is placed on a cover<br>
side of the foldable wireless device 100. The second circuit board 104 on a second<br>
ground plane 110 inside a second PCB is placed on a base side of the foldable<br>
wireless device 100. In this embodiment, the cover side of the wireless device<br>
additionally includes a display module for displaying information on the wireless<br>
communications device's screen. The base side of the wireless device additionally<br>
includes a keypad module for receiving user input through a keypad of the wireless<br>
device.<br>
[0018] The distributed load 106 includes an inductive coupling 112 and a capacitive<br>
coupling 114. The inductive coupling 112 is located between the first ground plane<br>
4<br><br>
108 and the second ground plane 110, and is grounded on both the ground planes. The<br>
inductive coupling 112 and the capacitive coupling 114 produce a parallel resonance<br>
at a frequency of interest. The frequency of interest can be varied by adjusting the<br>
characteristics of the inductive coupling 112 and the capacitive coupling 114. The<br>
frequency of interest depends on the norms of the regions where the wireless device<br>
100 is being used. For multi-band wireless devices there are multiple frequencies of<br>
interest at which the resonance is established between the parallel inductive and<br>
capacitive couplings.<br>
[0019] The second circuit board 104 has an antenna 116 for receiving and<br>
transmitting radio signals. The antenna 116 can be of any shape, form and size<br>
without limiting the scope of the invention. For example, the antenna 116 is a folded J<br>
antenna. The impedance of the antenna 116 is tuned with the impedances of the first<br>
circuit board 102 and the second circuit board 104.<br>
[0020] FIG. 2 FIG. 2 shows an electrical representation 200 of the wireless device<br>
100 shown in FIG. 1. The distributed load 106 between the first ground plane 108 and<br>
the second ground plane 110 is provided using the inductive coupling 112, and the<br>
capacitive coupling 114. The inductive coupling 112 introduces an inductive load, and<br>
the capacitive coupling 114 introduces a capacitive load. The values of the inductive<br>
load and the capacitive load can be varied to produce resonance at frequencies of<br>
interest. In the electrical representation 200, element 212 represents the inductive<br>
coupling 112 and element 214 represents the capacitive coupling 114.The total<br>
impedance generated by the distributed load 106 sums to the impedance between the<br>
5<br><br>
first circuit board 102 and the second circuit board 104, hence reducing the electrical<br>
length.<br>
[0021] FIG. 3 shows a block diagram illustrating an exemplary wireless device 300<br>
with a distributed load in accordance with a first embodiment. The wireless device<br>
300 includes a first circuit board 302, a second circuit board 304, and a distributed<br>
load 306. The first circuit board 302 includes a first ground plane 308, and the second<br>
circuit board 304 includes a second ground plane 310 and an antenna 316. The<br>
distributed load 306 has an inductive coupling 312 and a capacitive coupling 314. The<br>
capacitive coupling 314 is placed between the first ground plane 308 and the second<br>
ground plane 310. The capacitive coupling 314 is physically grounded on the second<br>
ground plane 310 but is floating over the first ground plane 308. In this embodiment,<br>
a flat patch 318 is used to create a floating connection 320 to form the capacitive<br>
coupling 314. In accordance with an embodiment, the flat patch 318 is physically and<br>
electrically coupled to the second ground plane 310 and capacitively coupled to the<br>
first ground plane 308. The flat patch 318 can be made of any material having a high<br>
coefficient of electric conductivity. Examples of materials used for making the flat<br>
patch 318 include metals such as copper and aluminum. The flat patch 318 is further<br>
described in conjunction with FIG. 4.<br>
[0022] FIG. 4 shows a diagram illustrating the flat patch 318 in accordance with the<br>
first detailed embodiment as shown in FIG. 3.The flat patch 318 has been introduced<br>
beside the first circuit board 302 in a cover housing 410 of a wireless device. When<br>
the cover housing 410 is assembled, the flat patch 318 is separated from a display<br>
module at the first circuit board 302 by an air gap. The flat patch 318 has a connection<br>
6<br><br>
to the second circuit board 304 (not shown) placed at the base side of the wireless<br>
device 300. The placement of the flat patch 318 at the cover side of the wireless<br>
device reduces the electrical length of the second circuit board 304 at the base side of<br>
the wireless device 300.<br>
[0023] FIG. 5 shows a block diagram illustrating an exemplary wifeless device 500<br>
with a distributed load in accordance with a second detailed embodiment. In this<br>
embodiment, the wireless device has hinges for foldability. In the second detailed<br>
embodiment, the wireless device 500 includes a first circuit board 502 and a second<br>
circuit board 504. The first circuit board 502 includes a first ground plane 508, and<br>
the second circuit board 504 includes a second ground plane 510 and an antenna 516.<br>
A distributed load 506 includes an inductive load 512 and a capacitive load 514. The<br>
inductive load 512 directly connects to the first ground plane 508 and the second<br>
ground plane 510. The capacitive load is introduced by an air gap between a<br>
conductive protrusion of the first circuit board 502 and a conductive cylinder of the<br>
second circuit board 504. Examples of the materials used for making the conductive<br>
cylindrical coupler include metals such as copper and aluminum. In accordance with<br>
an embodiment, the inductive load 512 and the capacitive load 514 are supported<br>
using a pair of hinges of the foldable wireless device 500.<br>
[0024] FIG. 6 shows a diagram illustrating a capacitive coupling through a<br>
cylindrical capacitive coupler in accordance with the second detailed embodiment as<br>
shown in FIG. 5. In this second embodiment, the capacitive coupling 514 shown in<br>
FIG. 5 is implemented as an air gap 614 between a metal finger 615 physically and<br>
electrically coupled to the first circuit board 502 and a conductive barrel 620<br>
7<br><br>
physically and electrically coupled to the second circuit board 504. The first circuit<br>
board 502 and the second circuit board 504 are connected using a pair of hinges: a<br>
first hinge 602 and a second hinge 604. In this embodiment, the pair of hinges is<br>
placed opposite to where the antenna 516 (not shown in FIG. 6) is placed in the<br>
second circuit board 504. The first hinge 602 supports the inductive coupling 512 (not<br>
shown in FIG. 6), and the second hinge 604 supports the capacitive coupling 514.<br>
The distributed load 506, as supported by the pair of hinges, 602, 604 produces<br>
sufficient impedance required by the antenna 516 for efficiently<br>
receiving/transmitting radio waves.<br>
[0025] The capacitive coupling 514 is introduced across the first circuit board 502<br>
and the second circuit board 504, using a cylindrical barrel 620placed perpendicular<br>
to, and along, the second hinge 604. The metal finger 615 does not directly contact the<br>
conductive barrel 620, and the air gap 614 between the metal finger and the<br>
conductive barrel provides the capacitive coupling 514 (shown in FIG. 5). The<br>
distributed load 506 as introduced, reduces the electrical length of the second circuit<br>
board 504, and hence reduces the overall mechanical length of the base side of the<br>
wireless device 500. Additionally, the introduction of the distributed load 506<br>
improves the efficiency of the antenna at lower frequencies.<br>
[0026] FIG. 7 shows a block diagram illustrating an exemplary wireless device 700<br>
with a distributed load in accordance with a third detailed embodiment. This third<br>
embodiment is similar to the first embodiment and demonstrates that the capacitive<br>
coupling 114 shown in FIG. 1 can be implemented in a variety of ways. The wireless<br>
device 700 includes a first circuit board 702, a second circuit board 704, and a<br>
8<br><br>
distributed load 706. The first circuit board 702 includes a first ground plane 708, and<br>
the second circuit board 704 includes a second ground plane 710 and an antenna 716.<br>
The distributed load 706 includes an inductive coupling 712 and a capacitive coupling<br>
714. The capacitive coupling 714 is placed between the first ground plane 708 and the<br>
second ground plane 710. The capacitive coupling 714 is grounded on the second<br>
ground plane 710 but is floating over the first ground plane 708. In this embodiment,<br>
a flat patch 718 creates the floating connection. The flat patch 718 can be made of any<br>
material having high coefficient of electric conductivity. Examples of materials used<br>
for making the flat patch 718 include metals such as copper and aluminum.<br>
[0027] FIG. 8 shows an efficiency versus frequency chart 800 illustrating the<br>
efficiency of the wireless device 100 at various frequencies as compared to a wireless<br>
device without a distributed load. The tested wireless device with distributed load was<br>
implemented in accordance with the first detailed embodiment (shown in FIG. 3 and<br>
FIG. 4). The efficiency of the wireless device 100 is defined as the percentage of the<br>
input power provided to the antenna 116 that is radiated by the antenna 116. As<br>
shown in FIG. 8, efficiency (%) of the wireless device in free space (shown with a<br>
gray line 810) increases at lower frequency range (824-960 MHz), with the<br>
introduction of the distributed load 106. Additionally, there is a slight increase at the<br>
higher frequency range (1710-1990 MHz). This is an additional advantage to the fact<br>
that the mechanical length of the wireless device 100 is reduced. The efficiency<br>
improves at lower frequencies because the impedance required by the antenna 116 at<br>
lower frequencies for producing resonance is provided by the second circuit board<br>
104 with the distributed load 106. In the absence of the distributed load 106, the<br>
9<br><br>
required impedance is not provided and hence the efficiency (shown with a black line<br>
820) suffers at lower frequencies.<br>
[0028] FIG. 9 shows a comparison chart 900 illustrating the changes in decibel<br>
levels at various frequency ranges due to the introduction of the distributed load 106,<br>
in accordance with the first detailed embodiment shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4. The<br>
curve 910 in FIG. 9 represents the formation of resonance at the lower and higher<br>
frequencies in the wireless device 100 with the distributed load 106. The line 920<br>
represents the formation of resonance within a range of frequencies without the<br>
distributed load 106. As can be seen at lower frequency range (824-960 MHz),<br>
decibel levels of the wireless device 100 with the distributed load 106 show better<br>
resonance structure in comparison to the wireless device 100 without the distributed<br>
load 106.<br>
[0029] These embodiments have the advantage of allowing a shorter mechanical<br>
length of a base circuit board having a built-in antenna. The mechanical length is<br>
reduced because of the reduction in the electrical length of the base circuit board. The<br>
provision of a distributed load between the base circuit board and cover circuit board<br>
enables a reduction in the electrical length of the base circuit board. Another<br>
advantage of various embodiments of the invention is the improved performance at<br>
lower range frequencies. As shown in FIG. 8 and FIG. 9, the efficiency and the<br>
resonance have improved at the lower frequency ranges (824-960 MHz). The<br>
improvement in the efficiency has been achieved along with the reduction in the<br>
electrical length of the base circuit board.<br>
