				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to antibiotic combination products in general The invention also pertains to parenteral dosage forms of antibiotic combination products and process of producing them for delivering two or more different antibiotics for treatment of diseases in mammals including human being.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Disease like Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disease that affects a number of organs, particularly the lungs and pancreas The exocrine glands of a Cystic fibrosis patient secrete abnormally thick mucous, which blocks the patient's bronchi As a result, many Cystic fibrosis patients have chronic bronchitis, they are also susceptible to pneumonia and other pulmonary infections In particular, Cystic fibrosis patients are susceptible to Pseudomonas infections Unfortunately, the infections of many Cystic fibrosis patients do not respond to the antibiotics traditionally used to treat pulmonary infections In such a situation, treatments for this disabling disease focuses on alleviating the symptoms of the disease.<br>
Many such similar situations need a practical solution where it becomes clear that the infection is acute, chronic, most probably arising out of resistant bacterial infections, monotherapy is indicated to be ineffective and a better empirical alternative is needed to provide the most probable remedy for obtaining a relief for a patient.<br>
To combat such diseases, the pharmaceutical community has developed a number of different antibiotic agents, which have revolutionized the practice of medicine Such agents include amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin , amoxicillin, amphotericin B, ampicillin, atovaquone, azithromycin, cefazohn, cefepime, cefotaxime, cefotetan, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, cephalexin, chloramphenicol, clotrimazole, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, clindamycin, dicloxacilhn, doxycychne, erthromycin lactobionate, lmipenem, lzoniazid, metronidazole, nafcillin, nitrofurantoin, nystatin, penicillin, pentamidine, piperacillin, rifampin, ticarcilhn, trimethoprim, vancomycin, and the like While such agents are effective against most bacteria and therefore useful in the treatment of disease conditions associated with the presence of such bacteria, there is increasing evidence that certain strains of bacteria are becoming resistant to one or more of the known antibiotic agents Many believe that the emergence of drug resistant bacteria is the result of antibiotic overuse and have thus called for the controlled and limited use of antibiotic agents.<br>
Helm et al (Ophthalmology 1997 May, 104(5) 838-43) have reported that combination therapy with   intravenous  ceftazidime   and   aminoglycoside  may  be   more  effective   than  single-<br>
intravenous agents when used in addition to topical antibiotics and may obviate the need for adjunctive surgical procedures, such as cryotherapy, surgical extirpation, or conjunctival recession Kikuchi et al (Jpn J Antibiot 1992 Jul,45(7) 799-808) studied 'Clinical evaluation of combined therapy of ceftazidime and tobramycin for intractable pulmonary infection mainly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa In an open, multicentre trial, they evaluated utility of the combination therapy and found that the overall efficacy rate in cases where causal organism of pneumonia was P aeruginosa was 60 0% but the efficacy rate in moderate cases was 100% and that in severe cases was 45 5% In cases where causal organism was gram negative bacilli, the overall efficacy rate was 72 2% with 100% efficacy rate among moderate cases and 68 8% among severe cases In the cases with chronic respiratory tract infections caused by P aeruginosa, the efficacy rate was 82 6% and the eradication rate was 65 2% Above results very clearly show that combination therapy of ceftazidime and tobramycin is useful for intractable pulmonary infections caused by P aeruginosa Efficiency of curing 45 5% or more of severe cases and 72 2 to 100% of moderate cases in above clinical trials clearly indicate existence of synergistic action between these two antibiotics Jacobs et al (Infection 1993 Jul-Aug, 21(4)223-8) studied the efficacy and safety of ceftazidime versus ceftazidime plus tobramycin in the treatment of febrile children (range 8 months to 18 years) with neutropenia secondary to cancer chemotherapeutic agents Of the evaluable 89 patients, 45 received ceftazidime and 44 received ceftazidime plus tobramycin for 5 to 10 days At the end of therapy, 30 (67%) of the 45 ceftazidime-treated patients were clinically cured compared with 38 (86%) of 44 combination-treated patients The results show that in difficult cases of febrile neuropenic children, combination therapy of ceftazidime plus tobramycin is a better alternative to monotherapy of ceftazidime.<br>
Double beta-lactam regimen compared to an aminoglycoside/beta-lactam regimen as empiric antibiotic therapy for febrile granulocytopenic cancer patients was studied by Joshi et al (Support Care Cancer 1993 Jul, 1(4) 186-94) Both regimens produced excellent serum bactericidal levels (C +/- T geometric mean peak 1 170, C + P peak 1 137) against gram-negative but not gram-positive pathogens (1 4, 1 7 respectively) that had caused bacteremia Emergence of resistance and significant coagulopathy and/or bleeding did not occur during therapy The incidence of secondary infections in patients with profound (
However, patients with adequate neutrophil counts responded better to the combination than to single-agent therapy The rates of superinfection and toxicity were very low Balke et al (Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis 2006 Jan, 25(1) 25-30) reported that the determination of synergistic effects of antimicrobial drug combinations can lead to improved therapeutic options in the antibiotic treatment of Cystic fibrosis patients who are chronically infected with multiresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates The rate of synergy was higher for the antibiotic combination of ceftazidime and tobramycin (28 8% of the Cystic fibrosis strains) than for the combination of meropenem and tobramycin Canton et al (Clinical Microbiology &amp; Infection, Volume 11, Number 9, September 2005, pp 690-703(14) studied antimicrobial therapy for pulmonary pathogenic colonization and infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Cystic fibrosis patients and found patients witii acute infection should be treated for 14-21 days with high doses of two intravenous antimicrobial agents, with or without an inhaled treatment during or at the end of the intravenous treatment Maintenance treatment after development of chronic P aeruginosa infection/colonization (pathogenic colonization) in stable patients (aged &gt; 6 years) should be with inhaled tobramycin (300 mg twice-daily) in 28-day cycles (on-off) or, as an alternative, colistin (1-3 million units twice-daily Moderate and serious exacerbations can be treated with intravenous ceftazidime (50-70 mg/kg three-times-daily) or cefepime (50 mg/kg three-times-daily) plus tobramycin (5-10 mg/kg every 24 h) or amikacin (20-30 mg/kg every 24 h) for 2-3 weeks.<br>
Hollander et al (Antimicrob Agents Chemother 1997 Jan,41(l) 95-100) in "Synergism between tobramycin and ceftazidime against a resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain, tested in an in-vitro pharmacokinetic model " reported that there is synergism between tobramycin and ceftazidime at declining antibiotic concentrations below the MIC, resulting in a pronounced killing of a resistant Pseudomonas strain Infections due to resistant Pseudomonas strains could possibly be treated by a synergistic combination of these drugs.<br>
Chen &amp; Zabransky (Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis 1987 Feb,6(2) 157-64) in their study reported synergistic or additive effects in the tobramycin-ceftazidime combination against tobramycin-resistant strains of P aeruginosa and P maltophiha, and with all tobramycin combinations against tobramycin-susceptible strains of P aeruginosa using the checkerboard technique Zelenitsky et al (Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis 2004 May,49(l) 67-70) in their studies showed that antibiotic sequence had a significant and class dependent effect on antibacterial response Hollander et al (Antimicrob Agents Chemother 1998 Apr, 42(4) 744-8 ) in their studies concluded that for combination therapy with tobramycin and ceftazidime the T&gt;FICi is the parameter best predictive of efficacy and that the E-test for susceptibility testing of combination therapy gives promising results These new pharmacodynamic parameters for combination therapy promise to provide better insight into the rationale behind combination therapy. Above mentioned prior art methods of using two antibiotics in m-vivo studies in combination<br>
with the m-vitro studies show the promise of use of combination antibiotics for treatment of drug resistant infections However, administering more than one antibiotic for a combination treatment has several limitations, disadvantages as well as defects One feature of the references stated above is that each drug of the combination used therein was individually administered one after the other without specific or predetermined ratio Such administration and also the coadministration as mentioned in case of some of the above references have a number of disadvantages<br>
The individual administration of the ceftazidime and tobramycin components of drugs described in the prior art failed to solve the treatment problem satisfactorily because of following reasons:<br>
1.Drugs mentioned as the combinations used in the multiple drug treatment were administered<br>
one after the other individually in doses which were not optimal different doses than the<br>
invention.<br>
2.These    drugs    were    not    available    in    a    premixed    compositions    as    one    drug<br>
3.A further complexity is involved in administration of the drug as more number of pricks is<br>
required and the time of administration is also long.<br>
4.Treatment time is prolonged to about 14-21 days in case of individual administration of these<br>
drugs.<br>
5.Cost to the patient is higher due to increased hospitalization time.<br>
6.The failure rate is higher due to inconsistency of dose The components are administered<br>
either in equal proportions or the ratio is undefined and not fixed e g Canton et al used inhaled<br>
tobramycin (300 mg twice-daily), Blumer et al, in Chest, 2005 , used ceftazidime (5 mg/kg to 2<br>
g q8h), which was administered with IV tobramycin (at a serum peak of &gt; or = 8 microg/mL<br>
and a trough of 
treatment of such kind of infections.<br>
7.Use of other route like use of tobramycin as inhaler with parenteral route is adopted in some<br>
cases.<br>
8.Due to non availability of pharmaceutically effective fixed dose composition at fixed<br>
intervals,    chances    of    development    of    resistance    are    very    high    in    case    of<br>
prior art methods described In the absence of a predetermined dosage schedule of known<br>
efficacy, there is scope for arbitrary choice of dosage leading to a treatment variation from case<br>
to case, which could most probably be sub-optimal only 9 Co-administration has to be done<br>
very carefully as two individual components are not chemically compatible with each other and<br>
there are several precautions that have to be followed in case of prior art such as use of different<br>
syringes for individual component, control on time of administration of two drugs and the like<br>
These limitations, disadvantages and defects are removed / circumvented in this invention<br>
Advantages of combination therapy in present invention include a wider range of modes of<br>
action, improved efficacy of the composition on account of additive effect, synergy and reduction of resistant organisms / rate of super-infection.<br>
It is generally accepted that a dead bug cannot mutate and pass on resistance. The two measures of this are Maximal Bacterial Concentration (MBC) as required to kill the Bacterium and MPC which is the Mutant Prevention Concentration (cf Tulkins, Mouton ISAP Conference at ECCMID, April 2001) The MPC may be seen as an antibiotic concentration that will quickly kill all bacteria and kill bacteria with decreased susceptibility The parameters of the drug include, without limitation, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters and the derived MBC or MPC concentrations The MBC or MPC concentrations are either calculated or measured.<br>
The invention is based at least in part on the realization that pharmacokinetic data for a particular antibiotic drug can be used to derive infusion characteristics for that drug which can be programmed into a delivery system for that particular drug We anticipate that use of the system will mean less antibiotic is required per therapeutic treatment and that treatment times will be shorter.<br>
It is an embodiment of present invention wherein different antibiotics selected on the basis of their proven better combined efficacy in published clinical trials are made more efficacious and more convenient to administer by inventing the most efficacious combination based on m-vitro experimentation and by inventing fixed dose combinations with defined dosage schedule, which are compatible with each others in an injectable dosage form which can be given intramuscularly or intravenously as a parenteral route treatment In this fashion, many combinations of antibiotics are possible and all of them are included in this invention An illustration of the invention is provided by a fixed dose combination of ceftizidime and tobramycin, a combination which has already been demonstrated by clinical trials reported so far to be synergistically effective against a very wide range of pathogens.Treatment instituted before knowing the aetiology and antimicrobial sensitivities is empirical Therefore, present invention provides the desired empirical therapy for control of widest known range of all bacterial infections Such combinations of the invention have shown enhanced efficacy of the combination even in in vitro sensitivity test and clinical trials are in progress. For example, enterococci that are resistant to a vast array of antimicrobial drugs, including cell wall active agents, aminoglycosides, penicillin, ampicilhn, and vancomycin, have been observed in in vitro tests to be better controlled by the inventive synergistic combination of tobramycin combined with ceftazidime at critical concentrations of this invention The approach of this invention as applied to ceftidizime and tobramycin combination can potentially be useful for similar combinations of two or more antibiotics shown by published clinical trials to be synergistically useful when administered as separate doses. However, to<br>
make administration of multiple antibacterial agents possible as one injectable pharmaceutical composition and also as a method of treatment and prevention for infective conditions, it is necessary to ensure that they are safe and chemically compatible to each other they can be administered easily without posing any medical hazard, they provide effective treatment of the hospitalized patient for the treatment of bacterial infections to optimize antibiotic regimen , to improve clinical condition and to potentially decrease the development of resistance they provide efficacy against a wide variety of infectious organisms, they have a potential to administer a lower dose of a therapeutic agent while still providing efficacy, they have a potential to administer a higher dose of an antibacterial agent without increased side effects they ensure improvement of the therapeutic index of an active agent while decreasing its general toxicity and minimizing the risk of systemic effects They decrease the chances of super infection Meeting above requirements is not possible by a simple approach of mixing of ingredients, but it is necessary to invent a composition of the target antibacterial agents which shall satisfy all above criteria.<br>
The inventiveness about this patent lies in the following:<br>
1.The two drugs have been combined as one drug for the first time as dry powder for injection and liquid solution for injection as a fixed dose combination.<br>
2.	Although, in general, the cephalosporins and aminoglycosides are non-compatible with each other, it is a finding of this invention that they are compatible in presence of only a specific concentration of stabilizing agents and other components.<br>
3.	The dose deciding was the most innovative step involved in it as Tobramycin if given in higher doses can be nephrotoxic and prove fatal The dose which was found out to be safe was 60mg Tobramycin with 500mg Ceftazidime, 120mg Tobramycin with 1 Og Ceftazidime and 180mg Tobramycin with 2 Og Ceftazidime.<br>
4.The combination proves synergistic and is more effective than either of the drug alone.<br>
5.Both the ingredients selected have Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic compatibility m<br>
ratios identified in the invention and specified dosage schedules.<br>
6.The treatment time is reduced and cost to patient is very less<br>
7. Treatment time is reduced by 25% to 30% as compared to prior art Accordingly, the objects<br>
of the present invention are described as below:<br>
Accordingly an object of the present invention is to provide pharmaceutical compositions that are safe, that have efficacy against a wide variety of infectious organisms, and to provide a composition that is useful in providing effective treatment against non-ocular infective conditions of a multi drug resistant bacterium.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1-illustrates table 1 showing Bacterial susceptibility data on Ceftazidime and Tobramycin. FIG.2A through 2C-illustrates an Accelerated stability data of Ceftazidime and tobramycin wherein total strength of the of them is 1.120g,2.180g and 560g respectively.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an antibiotic composition utilizing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles and the uses thereof The composition delivers two antibiotics one of which is a concentration dependent killing antibiotic and the other is a concentration independent killing antibiotic or time dependent killing antibiotic More particularly, this invention relates to a composition for the parenteral delivery of two different antibiotics, their dosage schedule and the uses thereof.<br>
The terminology "concentration dependent killing antibiotic" means an agent that shows concentration dependent bactericidal activity in vitro, the higher the antibiotic concentration the greater is the extent of activity.<br>
The terminology "concentration independent killing antibiotic " means antibiotics whose bactericidal activity is dependant on time for which it is available at the site of injection for action against the bacterium and not on concentration.<br>
