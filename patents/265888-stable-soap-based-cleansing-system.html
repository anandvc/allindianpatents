				<td>STABLE SOAP BASED CLEANSING SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001]      The present invention relates to liquid skin cleansing compositions. More particularly, it relates to phase stable liquid skin cleansing compositions comprising a fatty acid soap, an acrylate based copolymer and an acidifying agent.<br>
BACKGROUND [0002]      Fatty acid liquid soap compositions are known in the art. These soaps have been widely employed for many years as effective general all purpose body cleansers. Fatty acid liquid soaps are formulated with a myriad of different ingredients to obtain the desired cleansing effect and the requisite physical property parameters so that they can be easily stored and dispensed in a convenient manner.  Fatty acid liquid soaps must have the appropriate rheology characteristics to be flowable when dispensed from the product container but of a sufficient viscosity not run off of the skin when applied to the body.  In addition, today's consumer is increasingly looking for additional benefits beyond the basic cleansing effects brought about by the traditional liquid soap product. Efforts are continually being made to make improvements in product function and aesthetics by incorporating various adjuncts into the formulation such as moisturizers, emollients, colorants, opacifiers, perfumes, antioxidants, antibacterial agents, and the like to name a few.  It has also been increasingly popular to incorporate water insoluble moieties such as microcapsules, beads, and pearlescent agents into the liquid soap composition for delivery of actives to the skin and for product aesthetics.<br>
[0003]      In order to achieve the desired rheology profiles and to disperse the multitude of different ingredients within the soap composition, synthetic rheology modifying polymers and synthetic surfactants have been employed in an attempt to obtain a composition which is stable with respect to viscosity and visual phase homogeneity over a period of time and a wide range of temperatures. These<br><br>
parameters are particularly significant for liquid compositions wherein the large quantity of water in the formulation makes the establishment of a stable composition more difficult, particularly when substantially water insoluble adjuncts are dispersed in the formulation.<br>
[0004]      Japanese Patent Publication No. 2004-204153 (publication date July 22, 2004) discloses a cleansing composition containing (A) a fatty acid salt; (B) a sulfate ester surfactant; and (C) a copolymer obtained from the polymerization of at least one monomer selected from (meth)acrylic acid, maleic acid, and an alkyl (meth)acrylate.<br>
[0005]      Japanese Patent Publication No. H11-189785 (publication date July 13, 1999) concerns a cleansing agent containing (A) a fatty acid salt; (B) a polyhydric alcohol; and (C) and alkyl acrylate copolymer.<br>
[0006]      While these compositions are typically stable at ambient temperatures, the structuring of this type of soap formulation tends to collapse when exposed to elevated temperatures of about 40 to 50Â°C. Consequently, care must be taken when transporting and storing these products in warm and tropical regions of the world.<br>
[0007]      The use of synthetic surfactants in place of fatty acid soaps has been proposed to achieve a storage stable composition that is able to suspend water insoluble adjuncts. U.S. Patent No. 6,846,785 discloses a liquid soap composition containing a cleansing base formulated from an anionic surfactant and a chelating agent, vitamin microcapsules and a crosslinked, alkali-swellable acrylic emulsion polymer for uniform suspension of the microcapsules. However, synthetic surfactants are more expensive than fatty acid soaps and synthetic surfactants can be irritating to the eyes and skin.  Moreover, when applied to the skin surfactants have a tendency to absorb moisture, swell and leave the skin feeling taunt or sticky.<br>
[0008]      Accordingly, there is a need for a fatty acid based liquid soap composition that retains good rheological profiles, structure and visual aesthetics across a wide temperature range while having the mildness and sensorial attributes that are superior to those of conventional liquid soaps.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS [0009]      In accordance with a general embodiment of the present invention, the liquid cleansing soap comprises a fatty acid salt soap base, a crosslinked alkali-swellable acrylic emulsion polymer, and an acidifying agent. The composition is stabilized with respect to viscosity and to phase integrity with the crosslinked alkali-swellable acrylic emulsion polymer and subsequently back-acid treated with the acidifying agent to obtain compositions that are storage and phase stable over a wide temperature range.<br>
[0010]      In one exemplary embodiment of the invention, the liquid soap composition comprises:<br>
(a)	from about 1 to about 50 wt. % of a fatty acid salt;<br>
(b)	from about 0.1 to about 10 wt. % of a crosslinked acrylic emulsion polymer;<br>
(c)	from about 0.1 to about 20 wt. % of an acidifying agent;<br>
(d)	an optional surfactant wherein the wt. ratio of fatty acid salt to surfactant ranges from about 1:39 to about 39:1;<br>
(e)	from about 1 to about 20 wt. % of an optional humectant;<br>
(f)	from about 1 to about 15 wt. % of an optional emollient; and<br>
(g)	the remainder water.<br>
[0011]      In addition to the foregoing ingredients, the composition can include other optional adjuncts conventionally used in liquid soaps. These include, for example, one or more preservatives, one or more viscosity adjusting agents, one or more skin conditioners, antibacterial agents, one or more antioxidants, one or more fragrances, one or more colorants, one or more chelating (sequestering) agents and one or more insoluble materials. These optional materials are described in more detail below.<br>
[0012]      The selection and the amounts of the forgoing ingredients will be dependent upon the desired liquid soap end product of the invention. For example, a hand soap, body wash, and facial cleanser can contain different ingredients as well as varying amounts of the same ingredient. The choice and<br><br>
amount of ingredients in formulated compositions of the invention will vary depending on the product and its function, as is well known to those skilled in the formulation arts. While overlapping weight ranges for the various ingredients that make up the liquid soap composition will be expressed for various embodiments of the invention, it should be readily apparent that the specific amount of each component in the composition will be selected from its disclosed range such that the desired amount of each component will be adjusted so that the sum of all components in the liquid soap composition totals 100 wt. %.<br>
Fatty Acid Soap<br>
[0013]      In one aspect of the invention the liquid soap composition contains at least one the fatty acid soap containing from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms. In another aspect of the invention the liquid soap composition contains at least one fatty acid soap containing from about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms. The fatty acids utilized in the soaps can be saturated and unsaturated and can be derived from synthetic sources, as well as from the hydrolysis of fats and natural oils.  Exemplary saturated fatty acids include but are not limited to octanoic, decanoic, lauric, myristic, pentadecanoic, palmitic, margaric, steric, isostearic, nonadecanoic, arachidic, behenic, and the like, and mixtures thereof.  Exemplary unsaturated fatty acids include but are not limited to myristoleic, palmitoleic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic, and the like, and mixtures thereof. The fatty acids can be derived from animal fat such as tallow or from vegetable oil such as coconut oil, red oil, palm kernel oil, palm oil, cottonseed oil, olive oil, soybean oil, peanut oil, corn oil, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0014]      The soap can be prepared by a variety of well known means such as by the direct neutralization of a fatty acid or mixtures thereof or by the saponification of suitable fats and natural oils or mixtures thereof with a suitable base. Exemplary bases include potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide and triethanolamine. Generally, the fat or oil is heated until liquefied and a solution of aqueous base is added thereto. The pH of the system is adjusted by appropriate means, such as the addition of fatty acid or base, to<br><br>
be within the range of about 8.5 to about 14.0, in one aspect, and from about 9.0 to about 12.0, in another aspect of the invention, and from about 9.5 to 11.0 in still another aspect of the invention. The upper limit of the pH range is established to ensure mildness toward the skin of the user and the lower limit serving to ensure neutralization or saponification of the fatty acid. [0015]      The amount of fatty acid soap that is employed in the liquid soap composition ranges from about 1 % to about 50% by wt. of the total composition in one aspect, and from about 10% to about 35% by wt. in another aspect of the invention.<br>
[0016]	In one aspect of the invention, the fatty acid soap is an alkali metal<br>
fatty acid soap.  In another aspect of the invention the fatty acid soap is the potassium salt of a fatty acid.<br>
Crosslinked Acrylic Emulsion Polymer<br>
[0017]      The acrylic emulsion polymer of the present invention is polymerized from a monomer mixture comprising three polymerizable monomeric components. The first monomeric component is selected from one or more unsaturated carboxylic acid containing monomers and salts thereof having a total of from about 3 to about 10 carbon atoms. Examples of such monomers include but are not limited to acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid, fumaric acid, crotonic acid, maleic acid, or aconitic acid. Moreover, half esters of polyacids, such as maleic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid, or aconitic acid and the like with C1 to C4 alkanols can also be used, particularly if it is used in minor amounts in combination with acrylic acid or methacrylic acid. Salts of the foregoing monomers (e.g., sodium and potassium) can be employed.<br>
[0018]      The amounts of such carboxylic acid monomers is generally from about 20% to 80% by wt. in one aspect, from about 25% to about 70% by wt. in another aspect and from about 35% to about 65% by wt. in a further aspect, based upon the total wt. of the monomers.<br>
[0019]      The second monomeric component is selected from one or more vinyl monomers represented by the formulae:<br><br>
1)	CH2=CXY,<br>
where X is H and Y is -C(0)OR, -C6H4R', -CN, -C(0)NH2, -CI,<br>
-NC4H60, -NH(CH2)3C(0)OH, -NHC(0)CH3, -C(0)NHC(CH3)3,<br>
-C(0)N(CH3)2l<br>
or X is CH3 and Y is -C(0)OR, -C6H4R', -CN or -CH=CH2;<br>
or X is CI and Y is CI, and<br>
R is C1-C18 alkyl, or hydroxy C2-C-18 alkyl,<br>
R'is HorC1-C18alkyl;<br>
2)	CH2=CHOC(0)R1, where R1 is C1-C-18 alkyl; or<br>
3)	CH2=CH2 or CH2=CHCH3.<br>
[0020]      Typical of such vinyl monomers or mixture of monomers are the various acrylate or hydroxy acrylate esters wherein the ester portion has from 1 to 10 carbon atoms such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, n-butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, or various vinyl acetates, or styrene, or vinyl chloride, orvinylidene chloride, or acrylonitrile, acrylamide, N,N,-dimethylacrylamide, t-butyl-acrylamide, and their methacrylate analogs. [0021]      The amount of such non-acid vinyl monomers is generally from about 80% to about 15% by wt. in one aspect, from about 75% to about 25% by wt. in another aspect, and from about 65% to about 35% by wt. in a further aspect based upon the total wt. of the monomers.<br>
[0022]      The third monomeric component forming the crosslinked acrylic emulsion polymer is one or more polyunsaturated crosslinking monomers. Monomeric unsaturated compounds carrying a reactive group that is capable of causing a formed copolymer to be crosslinked before, during, or after polymerization has taken place can also be used.<br>
[0023]      The polyunsaturated compound is utilized to generate either a partially or substantially-crosslinked three-dimensional polymeric network. By polyunsaturated is meant that the crosslinking monomer contains at least two polymerizable double bonds that are reactive with the foregoing unsaturated carboxylic acid containing monomers and the vinyl monomers.   Examples of such<br><br>
polyunsaturated compounds are the polyalkenyl ethers of sucrose, or polyalcohols; diallylphthalates, divinyl benzene, allyl (meth)acrylate, ethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate, methylene bisacrylamide, trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate, diallyl itaconate, diallyl fumarate, diallyl maleate, zinc (meth)acrylate, derivatives of castor oils or polyols made from ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid and the like, glycidyl methacrylate, N-methylol acylamide or N-alkoxymethylacrylamide, alkoxy being C1 to C18 alcohol; hydroxy(meth)acrylate or (meth)acrylate end-capped caprolactones-.<br>
[0024]      For those skilled in the art of making unsaturated derivatives, a reaction scheme such as an esterification reaction of polyols made from ethylene oxide or propylene oxide or combinations thereof with unsaturated acid such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, or with unsaturated anhydride such as maleic anhydride, citraconic anhydride, itaconic anhydride, or an addition reaction with unsaturated isocyanate such as 3-isopropenyl-a-a-dimethylbenzene isocyanate (TMI), is also within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0025]      As used herein, the term "(rmeth)acrylic" acid and "(meth)acrylate" are meant to include the corresponding methyl derivatives of acrylic acid and the corresponding alkyl acrylate.    For example, "(meth)acrylic)" acid refers to acrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid and "(meth)acrylate" refers to alkyl acrylate and/or alkyl methacrylate.<br>
[0026]      The third component can be used in an amount from about 0.01 to about 5% by wt. in one aspect, from about 0.03 to about 3% by wt. in another aspect, and from about 0.05 to about 1% by wt. in a further aspect, based upon the total wt. of all of the monomer components.<br>
[0027]      Furthermore, the crosslinked copolymer acrylic emulsion is generally free of any moieties derived from associative monomers (i.e. copolymerizable surfactants). Generally free is defined as containing less than about 1% by wt. in one aspect, less than about 0.5% by wt. in another aspect, and less than about 0.2% by wt. in a further aspect of the invention.<br>
[0028]      The crosslinked acrylic emulsion polymer of the present invention can generally be prepared by emulsion polymerization techniques. The emulsion<br><br>
polymerization is generally carried out at a pH of from about 2.5 to about 5.0, with the at least three essentially ethylenically unsaturated components set forth above. None of these monomers are an associative monomer which is a copolymerizable surfactant capable of nonspecific hydrophobic association similar to those of conventional surfactants.<br>
[0029]      The crosslinked acrylic emulsion polymers of the present invention can be made in any conventional manner such as set forth in U.S. Patent No. 4,138,380, or U.S. Patent No. 4,110,291 which are hereby fully incorporated by reference. Generally, one or more monomers of the above noted carboxylic acid monomers, vinyl monomers, and polyunsaturated monomers are added to a reaction vessel which contains water therein. Suitable amounts of conventional or typical emulsion polymerization surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate are added as well as emulsion type initiators, for example sodium or potassium persulfate, redox initiator, and the like. The reaction vessel can also contain a chain transfer agent. The temperature is then increased from about 60Â°C to about 100Â°C and polymerization commences. Optionally, during the reaction, additional monomers are added over a period of time. Upon completion of the addition of the monomers, polymerization is allowed to run to completion generally by adding additional initiator.   Crosslinked Alkali-swellable acrylic emulsion polymers are disclosed in copending U.S. Patent Application No. 11/083,243 filed on March 17, 2005, which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
[0030]      In one embodiment the crosslinked acrylic emulsion copolymer suitable for use in the liquid soap composition of the present invention is commercially available from Noveon, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio and is marketed under the tradename CarbopolÂ® Aqua SF-1. Carbopol Aqua SF-1 polymer is an alkali-swellable acrylic emulsion polymer composition containing approximately 30% by wt. polymer solids. The polymer is a branched to lightly crosslinked copolymer made from at least one pH sensitive first monomer selected from acrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid and at least one second monomer selected from the C1 to C5 alkyl esters of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid.<br><br>
 [0031]      At an acidic pH the carboxyl functionality on the polymer backbone is in the protonated state and the polymer does not exhibit any viscosity building properties. However, after neutralization of the polymer by adding it to the alkaline soap composition which has a pH profile ranging from about 8.5 to about 14.0, the carboxyl groups on the polymer backbone ionize causing the polymer to swell and increase in viscosity.<br>
[0032]	The amount of the crosslinked acrylic emulsion copolymer employed<br>
in the liquid soap composition generally ranges from about 0.1% to about 10% by wt. of the total composition in one aspect, from about 0.15% to about 5% by wt. in another aspect, and in a further aspect from about 0.3% to about 4% of active (neat) polymer based upon the total wt. of the composition.<br>
Acidifying Agent<br>
[0033]      Surprisingly, it has been discovered that if the pH of the liquid soap composition is lowered subsequent to the addition of the crosslinked alkali-swellable acrylic emulsion copolymer rheology modifier, the viscosity and yield value of the composition generally remain unchanged or often actually increase. This formulating technique is referred to as "back-acid" thickening. The back-acid thickening technique can be used to further increase the viscosity and stability of compositions formulated in the alkaline pH range by actually reducing the pH of the composition.<br>
[0034]      In one aspect of the invention, the final target pH (subsequent to back-acid formulating) should be at least about.0.5 to 7 pH units below that of the initial pH of the system. In another aspect the target pH is at least about 0.75 to 5 pH units below the initial pH, and in still another aspect the target pH is at least about 1 to 4 pH units below the initial pH of the soap composition.<br>
 [0035]      An acidifying agent is added to reduce the pH of the composition. The acidifying agent can be an organic acid, such as citric acid, acetic acid, alpha-hydroxy acid, beta-hydroxy acid, salicylic acid, lactic acid, glycolic acid, natural fruit acids, or combinations thereof. In addition, inorganic acids, for example hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, sulfamic acid, phosphoric acid, and<br><br>
combinations thereof can be utilized to reduce the pH value of the composition. The amount of such acid is generally from about 0.1 to about 20%, in one aspect from about 0.2% to 15% in another aspect, and from about 0.25% to about 10% by wt. in a further aspect, based upon the total wt. of the stabilized composition.<br>
 [0036]      The desired pH to stabilize compositions of the present invention is obviously dependent on the specific viscosity and mildness parameters desired. In one embodiment of the invention, the liquid soap compositions have a desired final pH range of about 7.8 to about 9.8. In another embodiment the final pH range of the liquid soap composition can range from about 8.0 to about 9.5, and in a further embodiment the pH can range from about 8.2 to about 9.2.<br>
Surfactant<br>
[0037]      The fatty acid soap compositions of the invention can include an optional surfactant selected from anionic, amphoteric, zwitterionic, nonionic, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0038]      The anionic surfactant can be any of the anionic surfactants known or previously used in the art of aqueous surfactant compositions. Suitable anionic surfactants include but are not limited to alkyl sulfates, alkyl ether sulfates, alkaryl sulfonates, alkyl succinates, alkyl sulfosuccinates, N-alkoyl sarcosinates, alkyl phosphates, alkyl ether phosphates, alkyl ether carboxylates, alkylamino acids, alkyl peptides, alkoyl taurates, carboxylic acids, acyl and alkyl glutamates, alkyl isethionates, and alpha-olefin sulfonates, especially their sodium, potassium, magnesium, ammonium and mono-, di- and triethanolamine salts. The alkyl groups generally contain from 8 to 18 carbon atoms and may be unsaturated. The alkyl ether sulfates, alkyl ether phosphates and alkyl ether carboxylates may contain from 1 to 10 ethylene oxide or propylene oxide units per molecule, and preferably contain 1 to 3 ethylene oxide units per molecule. <br>
[0039]      Examples of suitable anionic surfactants include sodium and ammonium lauryl ether sulfate (with 1, 2, and 3 moles of ethylene oxide), sodium, ammonium, and triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sodium C12-14 olefin sulfonate, sodium<br><br>
laureth-6 carboxylate, sodium C12-15 pareth sulfate, sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate, sodium cocoyl sarcosinate, and triethanolamine monolauryl phosphate.<br>
[0040]      Amphoteric and zwitterionic surfactants are those compounds which have the capacity of behaving either as an acid or a base. These surfactants can be any of the surfactants known or previously used in the art of aqueous surfactant compositions. Suitable materials include but are not limited to alkyl betaines, alkyl amidopropyl betaines, alkyl sulphobetaines, alkyl glycinates, alkyl carboxyglycinates, alkyl amphopropionates, alkyl amidopropyl hydroxysultaines, acyl taurates and acyl glutamates wherein the alkyl and acyl groups have from 8 to 18 carbon atoms. Examples include cocamidopropyl betaine, sodium cocoamphoacetate, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, and sodium cocamphopropionate.<br>
[0041]      The nonionic surfactant can be any of the nonionic surfactants known or previously used in the art of aqueous surfactant compositions. Suitable nonionic surfactants include but are not limited to aliphatic (C6 to C18) primary or secondary linear or branched chain acids, alcohols or phenols, alkyl ethoxylates, alkyl phenol alkoxylates (especially ethoxylates and mixed ethoxy/propoxy), block alkylene oxide condensate of alkyl phenols, alkylene oxide condensates of alkanols, ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block copolymers, semi-polar nonionics (e.g., amine oxides and phosphine oxides), as well as alkyl amine oxides. Other suitable nonionics include mono or di alkyl alkanolamides and alkyl polysaccharides, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitol esters, polyoxyethylene acids, and polyoxyethylene alcohols.  Examples of suitable nonionic surfactants include coco mono or diethanolamide, coco diglucoside, alkyl polyglucoside, cocamidopropyl and lauramine oxide, polysorbate 20, ethoxylated linear alcohols, cetearyl alcohol, lanolin alcohol, stearic acid, glyceryl stearate, PEG-100 stearate, and oleth 20.<br>
[0042]      Other surfactants which can be utilized in the present invention are set forth in more detail in WO 99/21530, U.S. Patent No. 3,929,678, U.S. Patent No.<br><br>
4,565,647, U.S. Patent No. 5,720,964, and U.S. Patent No. 5,858,948. Other suitable surfactants are described in McCutcheon's Emulsifiers and Detergents (North American and International Editions, by Schwartz, Perry and Berch) which is hereby fully incorporated by reference.<br>
[0043]      In one embodiment of the invention, the amounts of surfactant can vary widely if present.

Some formulations are opacified by deliberately incorporating pearlescent<br>
materials therein to achieve a cosmetically attractive pearl-like appearance,<br>
known as pearlescence. Persons skilled in the art are aware of problems faced<br>
by formulators in consistently preparing a pearlescent formulation. A detailed<br>
discussion is found in the article "Opacifiers and pearling agents in shampoos"<br>
by Hunting, Cosmetic and Toiletries, Vol. 96, pages 65 to 78 (July 1981),<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0055]      The pearlescent material includes titanium dioxide coated mica, iron<br>
oxide coated mica, ethylene glycol mono-stearate, ethylene glycol distearate,<br>
polyethylene glycol distearate, bismuth oxychloride coated mica, myristyl<br>

pearlescent materials can be found in U.S. Patent No. 4,654,207 and U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,019,376, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
[0056]      An improved or enhanced pearlescent appearance has been observed<br>
when back-acid formulating the compositions of the invention. Furthermore, the<br>
formulation technique prevents the sedimentation or precipitation of the<br>
pearlescent material thus significantly decreasing the "flattening out" of the<br>
pearlescent appearance. Additionajly, it is believed that the polymeric rheology<br>
modifier serves to hold the pearlescent particles or platelets in their optimal<br>
configuration for maximum pearlescent appearance.<br>
[0057]      The amount of the pearlescent material can generally be used in<br>
amounts of from about 0.05% to about 10% and desirably from about 0.15% to<br>
about 3% by wt. based upon the total wt. of the composition.<br>
[0058]      In addition to the above generally insoluble compounds, numerous<br>
other optional substantially insoluble compounds which require stabilization can<br>
be utilized in the composition.  Examples of such other insoluble compounds<br><br>
include titanium dioxide; pumice; calcium carbonate, talc, potato starch, tapioca starch, jojoba beads, polyethylene beads, walnut shells, loofah, apricot seeds; almond meal, corn meal, paraffin, oat bran/oat hulls, gelatin beads, alginate beads, stainless steel fibers, iron oxide pigments, air bubbles, mica coated iron oxides, kaolin clay, salicylic acid, zinc oxide, zeolite, styrofoam beads, phosphates, silica, and the like. Other generally insoluble compounds include teatree powder, microsponges, Confetti (a trademark of united guardian company), talc, beeswax, and the like. The amount of the various insoluble compounds requiring stabilization will vary depending upon its purpose, desired end result, and efficacy thereof. Hence amounts can vary widely, but frequently will be within a general range of from about 0.1 % to about 20% by wt. based upon the total wt. of the soap composition.<br>
[0059]      A diluent such as water (often deionized) can be used and typically comprises about 5 wt. % to about 95 wt. % in one aspect, from about 10 wt. % to about 75 wt. % in another aspect, and from about 15 wt. % to 50 wt. % in a further aspect of the invention of the total wt. of the fatty acid soap composition. [0060]      The following examples are presented for the purpose of illustrating the invention disclosed herein in greater detail.  However, the examples are not to be construed as limiting the invention in any manner. It is to be appreciated that the forgoing formulations are set forth in an illustrative manner and that other liquid soap compositions and the formulation thereof are within the scope of the present invention.  Unless otherwise specified all ingredient amounts are given by wt. % based on the weight of the composition.<br>
Methods Description Viscosity<br>
[0061]      The reported viscosity of each polymer containing composition was measured in milli-Pascal seconds (mPa-s), employing a Brookfield rotating spindle viscometer, (Brookfield, Model RVT) at about 20 revolutions per minute (rpm), at ambient room temperature of about 20 to 25Â°C. (hereafter referred to as Brookfield viscosity). Viscosity was measured on freshly prepared<br><br>
compositions (referred to as "initial viscosity", and re-measured after allowing the composition to age for at least about 24 hours at ambient room temperature (referred to as "24-hour viscosity"). Where only one viscosity value is shown, the viscosity value is the 24-hour viscosity, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Yield Value<br>
[0062]      Yield Value, also referred to as Yield Stress, is herein defined as the initial resistance to flow under stress. It can be measured using a number of techniques, such as via the use of a constant stress rheometer or via extrapolation using a Brookfield viscometer. These techniques and the usefulness of the Yield Value measurement are further explained in Technical Data Sheet Number 244 available from Noveon, Inc., herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Stability<br>
[0063]      The various liquid soap compositions made using the substantially crosslinked alkali-swellable acrylate copolymer rheology modifier of the present invention are stable. The stability requirements for a particular composition will vary with its end marketplace application as well as the geography in which it is to be bought and sold. An acceptable "shelf life" is subsequently determined for each composition. This refers to the amount of time that a composition should be stable across its normal storage and handling conditions, measured between the times that the composition is produced and when it is finally sold for consumption. [0064]      To eliminate the need to conduct stability studies in excess of one year, stability testing is conducted at stressed conditions in order to predict the shelf life of a composition. Typically, accelerated testing is conducted at elevated static temperatures, usually 45 to 50Â°C. A composition should be stable for at least 2 weeks, desirably 1 month, preferably 2 or 3 months, and most preferably 4 or 5 months at 45Â°C. Additionally, freeze-thaw cycling is often employed wherein the composition is cycled between a freezing temperature, usually 0Â°C, and an<br><br>
ambient temperature, usually 20 to 25Â°C. A composition should pass a minimum of 1 freeze-thaw cycle, preferably 3 cycles, and most preferably 5 cycles. <br>
[0065]      Products or compositions made according to the present invention are considered stable if they meet one or more of the following criteria:<br>
1.	There is no phase separation, settling, or creaming of any material in the composition. The composition should remain completely homogenous throughout its bulk. Separation is herein defined as the visible existence of 2 or more distinct layers or phases of any component in the formulation, including but not limited to insoluble matter, soluble matter, oily substances and the like.<br>
2.	The viscosity of the composition does not significantly increase or decrease overtime, generally less than 50%, preferably less than 35%, and most preferably less than 20%.<br>
3.	The pH of the composition does not increase or decrease more than two pH units, preferably not more than one unit, and most preferably not more than one-half unit.<br>
4.	The rheology and texture of the composition does not significantly change over time to that which is unacceptable.<br>
[0066]      Products or compositions made according to the present invention are considered unstable if they do not meet one or more of the above listed criteria.<br>

[0067]      Part A is prepared by dissolving potassium hydroxide in deionized water and heating the composition to 80Â°C. Part B is separately prepared by adding glycerin and the rheology modifier to deionized (D.I.) water while mixing. The fatty acids (ingredient Nos. 3, 4, and 5) are added to the glycerin/rheology modifier/water mixture with agitation and the temperature is raised to 80Â°C. Once the fatty acids melt and are homogeneously mixed, the other Part B ingredients are added to the composition. Part A is added to Part B while the temperature is maintained at 80Â°C. The Part AB composition is mixed for 30 to 60 minutes.  Upon attaining a homogeneous mixture, the Part AB composition is allowed to cool at ambient room temperature.  Upon cooling to 40Â°C, ingredient No. 9 is added to the Part AB. The formulation is cooled under agitation to ambient room temperature. The viscosity and yield value is measured at the initial pH of the formulation. The pH is sequentially lowered by back-acid treating with citric acid. The viscosity and yield values following the sequential reduction of the pH values of the liquid soap composition are reported in the table below.<br>
