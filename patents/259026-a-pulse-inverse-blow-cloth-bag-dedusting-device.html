				<td>Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to a cloth bag dedusting device, especially<br>
to a pulse inverse blow cloth bag dedusting device generally used for the<br>
dry type gas dedusting in blast furnace in the steel industry.<br>
Background art<br>
The cloth bag dedusting device has been widely used in the gaseous<br>
medium dedusting or separating a solid from a gas, especially in the<br>
technical field of dry type gas dedusting in blast furnace. In the prior art,<br>
the cloth bag dedusting device consists of a casing, dedusting cloth bag,<br>
separator, pulse inverse blow device, gas inlet/outlet, cinder bucket,<br>
sections of cinder unloading and transporting, etc.. As shown in Fig. 1,<br>
the dust gas moves into the casing through the gas inlet, further the<br>
dedusting cloth bag after being filtered, and then the clean gas collection<br>
pipe and clean gas collection tank unit in the casing, and finally is<br>
expelled out of the casing through the clean gas outlet. The pulse inverse<br>
blow gas moves into the inverse blow manifold to remove the dust from<br>
the cloth bag by way of the pulse inverse blow through the inverse blow<br>
branch pipe connected with the opening of the dedusting cloth bag, and<br>
the removed dust is expelled out of the casing through the cinder bucket,<br>
cinder unloading device and the cinder outlet. Normally, a conventional<br>
cloth bag dedusting device is designed to be with the diameter of the<br>
casing at 3.5 m, the length of the cloth bag at 6 m with diameter of 130<br>
mm, and 192 cloth bags to be fixed in the casing, according to features of<br>
the material used for the cloth bag and the gas as well as the temperature.<br>
However, the effective length of the cloth bag cannot be increased<br>
because of the limitation of the inverse blow effect of the pulse inverse<br>
blow cloth bag system. Moreover, a large amount of dedusting casings<br>
need to be used in the dedusting system and occupy a larger space, which<br>
result in a high consumption in economy.<br>
Contents of the Invention<br>
With respect to the shortcomings existed in the prior art, the object of the<br>
present invention is to provide a pulse inverse blow multilevel cloth bag<br>
dedusting device with high efficiency to satisfy the requirements of a<br>
long cloth bag so as to increase the dedusting areas of the cloth bag and<br>
the casing for saving space economically.<br>
The pulse inverse blow cloth bag dedusting device includes: a<br>
plurality of casings forming a whole dedusting system; a separator,<br>
disposed in the casing to divide it into two parts and the upper part is used<br>
as a gas collection unit; a gas collection tank unit, collecting the dust gas<br>
having been cleaned in the cloth bag dedusting device and the cleaned gas<br>
is expelled through the cleaned gas outlet; a dedusting cloth bag at length<br>
of at least 8 m for blowing the dust adhered thereon; a level 1 pulse<br>
inverse blow cloth bag system and a level 2 pulse inverse blow cloth bag<br>
system; an inlet of dust gas, disposed at the lower part of the casing; a<br>
clean gas outlet, disposed on the upper part of the gas collection tank in<br>
the casing.<br>
The level 1 pulse inverse blow cloth bag system includes a level 1<br>
inverse blow gas inlet, a level 1 inverse blow manifold and a level 1<br>
inverse blow branch pipe. The level 2 pulse inverse blow cloth bag<br>
system includes a level 2 inverse blow manifold and a level 2 inverse<br>
blow branch pipe.<br>
The end opening of the level 1 pulse inverse blow branch pipe<br>
extends toward the opening of the dedusting cloth bag. The level 2 pulse<br>
inverse blow branch pipe extends into the dedusting cloth bag through the<br>
level 1 inverse blow manifold and the level 1 inverse blow branch pipe,<br>
and the extension depth is 1/2 of the length of the dedusting cloth bag.<br>
Moreover, the level 2 inverse blow manifold is concentric with the level 1<br>
inverse blow branch pipe. In addition, a level three or up pulse inverse<br>
blow system can be established according to the length of the cloth bag,<br>
and the total length of the level 2 or up inverse blow branch pipe is a<br>
multiple of 6m respectively.<br>
The level 2 inverse blow branch pipe consists of a plurality of<br>
sections communicated with each other by a union swivel, and each<br>
section is 1-2 m long.<br>
Said two level inverse blow points are fixed at the inlet of the<br>
dedusting cloth bag and in the middle of the bag respectively, i.e., each<br>
level inverse blow point is located on the upper part of each level: level 1<br>
inverse blow point is at the inlet of the bag and the level 2 inverse blow<br>
point is fixed in the middle of the bag.<br>
Both level 1 and 2 systems first carry out a level 1 inverse blow and<br>
then a level 2 inverse blow, or level 2 first then level 1. The two ways can<br>
be implemented slightly overlapped.<br>
The present invention can efficiently increase the dedusting area and<br>
the length of the dedusting cloth bag, thereby enhancing the efficiency of<br>
dedusting in individual casing.<br>

Mode of carrying out the invention<br>
A detailed description of the present invention is provided along with the<br>
drawings as follows.<br>
In one embodiment of the constructional drawing of the present<br>
invention as shown in Figs. 2-4, the pulse inverse blow cloth bag<br>
dedusting device comprises: casing 9, separator 5, dedusting cloth bag 6,<br>
support framework 7, gas collection tank 10, a level 1 inverse blow<br>
system, a level 2 inverse blow system, inlet 19 of dust gas and outlet 20<br>
of clean gas, etc..<br>
The level 1 inverse blow system consists of level 1 inverse blow inlet<br>
12, level 1 inverse blow manifold 3 and level 1 inverse blow branch pipe<br>
4.<br>
The level 2 inverse blow system consists of level 2 inverse blow inlet<br>
11, level 2 inverse blow manifold 1 and level 2 inverse blow branch pipe<br>
2.<br>
Level 2 inverse blow branch pipe 2 extends into the dedusting cloth<br>
bag through level 1 inverse blow manifold 3 and level 1 inverse blow<br>
branch 4, and the extension depth is 1/2 of the length of the dedusting<br>
cloth bag. Meanwhile, level 2 inverse blow branch pipe 2 is concentric<br>
with level 1 inverse blow branch pipe 4.<br>
Level 2 inverse blow branch 2 consists of a plurality of sections<br>
communicated with each other by a union swivel, and each section is 1-2<br>
m long.<br>
Level 2 inverse blow 2 communicates with level 2 inverse blow<br>
manifold 1 via lower flange 16 which corresponds to upper flange and<br>
cover flange 13. Level 2 inverse blow branch pipe 2 can be drawn out via<br>
level 2 inverse blow manifold 1, lower stub pipe 15 and upper stub pipe<br>
14 by tearing out threaded union swivel 8 on level 2 inverse blow branch<br>
2, and opening lower flange 16, upper flange and cover flange 13 and<br>
bushing flange 17, when examining and repairing the device.<br>
The level 1 inverse blow pipe inlet is disposed in casing 9 of the cloth<br>
bag dedusting device to connect with level 1 inverse blow manifold 3 via<br>
flange, and the level 2 inverse blow pipe inlet is also disposed in casing 9<br>
of the cloth bag dedusting device to connect with level 2 inverse blow<br>
manifold 1 via flange so as to easily dismantle level 1 inverse blow<br>
manifold 3 and level 2 inverse blow manifold 1 from casing 9 of the cloth<br>
bag dedusting device.<br>
Level 2 inverse blow branch pipe 2 is installed to pass through level<br>
1 inverse blow manifold 3 as well as bushing 18 and bushing flange 17.<br>
Meanwhile, bushing 18 and bushing flange 17 are disposed on the upper<br>
part of level 1 inverse blow manifold 3. After the installation is completed,<br>
bushing flange 17 and level 2 inverse blow branch pipe 2 are well welded<br>
to be airproof.<br>
Steps of dedusting gas: the dust gas moves into casing 9 of the cloth<br>
bag dedusting device through inlet 19 of the dust gas, further gas<br>
collection tank 10 after dust is filtered in dedusting cloth bag 6, and<br>
finally the clean gas manifold through outlet 20 of the clean gas.<br>
The length of each dedusting cloth bag 6 in casing 9 of the cloth bag<br>
dedusting device is 8-12 m. Each dedusting cloth bag 6 in casing 9 of the<br>
cloth bag dedusting device is cleaned by way of two levels of pulse<br>
inverse blow, and the inverse blow points of the two levels of inverse<br>
blow system in dedusting cloth bag 6 are disposed at the entrance and in<br>
the middle of the bag respectively, i.e., each inverse blow point is located<br>
on upper part of each level: the inverse blow point of level 1 inverse blow<br>
system is at the entrance of the bag and the inverse blow point of the level<br>
2 inverse blow system is in the middle of the bag.<br>
When the pulse inverse blow cloth bag carries out the dedusting, in<br>
addition to operate simultaneously the two systems, the preferred step is<br>
to implement level 1 inverse blow first and then level 2 inverse blow, or<br>
vice versa, and the two inverse blow operations can be slightly<br>
overlapped.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the models mentioned above<br>
and various modifications on the mode are possible, e.g., properly<br>
increasing the length of the dedusting cloth bag and constructing a level 3<br>
or up of pulse inverse blow system based on the principle of two levels of<br>
pulse inverse blow.<br>
