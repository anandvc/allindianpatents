REGENERATION CONTROL SYSTEM FOR A PARTICULATE FILTER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to vehicle exhaust systems,<br>
and more particularly to particulate filters in vehicle exhaust systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] During combustion in a diesel engine, an air/fuel mixture is<br>
compressed within a cylinder. Heat generated from compression ignites the<br>
air/fuel mixture expanding gases within the cylinder to drive a piston. Exhaust<br>
gases are released from the cylinder into an exhaust system.<br>
[0003] A diesel particulate filter (DPF) disposed in the exhaust<br>
stream filters soot particulates in the exhaust gas. Over time, the soot<br>
particulates build up inside the DPF. The DPF is periodically cleaned using a<br>
regeneration technique that burns the soot particulates.<br>
[0004] One conventional regeneration method injects diesel fuel into<br>
the cylinder after combustion. Post-combustion injected fuel is expelled from<br>
the cylinders with the exhaust gas and is oxidized over catalysts. Heat<br>
released during oxidation increases the exhaust gas temperature, which<br>
burns trapped soot particulates in the DPF. However, in some circumstances<br>
regeneration may generate temperatures that are high enough to damage the<br>
DPF causing thermal stress and/or melting.<br>
[0005] Various approaches have been employed to limit peak<br>
temperatures within the DPF. In one approach, post-combustion injected fuel<br>
is limited. However, this approach is ineffective because buildup of soot<br>
particulates in the DPF may be sufficient to create an exothermic reaction that<br>
increases the temperature.<br><br>
GP-306877-PTE-CD<br>
2<br>
[0006] In another approach, regeneration is performed more<br>
frequently to limit the buildup of soot particulates. However, if a vehicle has<br>
short driving cycles, the temperature of the exhaust gases may not be high<br>
enough to burn the soot particulates. Thus, regeneration may not occur when<br>
needed and soot particulates may build up in the DPF.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] A regeneration control system for a particulate filter (PF)<br>
according to the present invention includes a condition module and an<br>
oxygen-level module. The condition module determines whether an oxygen<br>
limiting event is required for the PF during a regeneration event. The oxygen-<br>
level control module communicates with the condition module and selectively<br>
limits an oxygen level in the PF during the regeneration event.<br>
[0008] In other features, the condition module determines whether<br>
the oxygen limiting event is required based on an oxygen level signal, a<br>
temperature signal, and/or an airflow signal. The condition module<br>
determines that the oxygen limiting event is required when the oxygen level<br>
signal exceeds an oxygen level threshold. The condition module determines<br>
that the oxygen limiting event is required when the temperature signal<br>
exceeds a temperature threshold. The condition module determines that the<br>
oxygen limiting event is required when the airflow signal does not exceed an<br>
airflow threshold.<br>
[0009] In still other features, the oxygen-level control module limits<br>
the oxygen level in the PF when the condition module determines that the<br>
oxygen limiting event is required. The oxygen-level control module limits the<br>
oxygen level in the PF with an exhaust gas recirculation valve, a variable<br>
nozzle turbine turbo, and/or a throttle.<br>
[0010] In yet other features, the regeneration control system<br>
includes a timer that starts timing when the condition module determines that<br>
the oxygen limiting event is required and generates a disables signal after a<br>
predetermined period.    The condition module determines that the oxygen<br><br>
GP-306877-PTE-CD<br>
3<br>
limiting event is not required when said disable signal is generated. The<br>
oxygen-level control module does not limit the oxygen level in the PF when<br>
the disable signal is generated.<br>
[0011] Further areas of applicability of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should<br>
be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while<br>
indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for<br>
purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0012] The present invention will become more fully understood<br>
from the detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
[0013] Figure 1 is a functional block diagram of a diesel engine<br>
system using a regeneration control system according to the present<br>
invention;<br>
[0014] Figure 2 is a functional block diagram of the regeneration<br>
control system according to the present invention;<br>

the regeneration control system to limit oxygen in the diesel engine system.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0017] The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. As used herein, the term module or device refers to an<br>
application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor<br>
(shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that executes one or more<br>
software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other<br>
suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br><br>
GP-306877-PTE-CD<br>
4<br>
[0018] According to the present invention, oxygen levels in exhaust<br>
gases may be limited to reduce temperatures during regeneration in a<br>
particulate filter (PF). When oxygen levels are reduced in the exhaust gases<br>
there is less soot oxidation, which limits the temperature within the PF.<br>
[0019] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary diesel engine<br>
system 10 is illustrated. It is appreciated that the diesel engine system 10 is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and that regeneration system described herein<br>
can be implemented in various engine systems implementing a particulate<br>
filter. Such engine systems may include, but are not limited to, gasoline direct<br>
injection engine systems, compressed natural gas engine systems, and<br>
homogeneous charge compression ignition engine systems. For ease of the<br>
discussion, the disclosure will be discussed in the context of a diesel engine<br>
system.<br>
[0020] The diesel engine system 10 includes an engine 12, an<br>
intake manifold 14, a fuel injection system 16, and an exhaust system 18.<br>
The exemplary engine 12 includes six cylinders 20 configured in adjacent<br>
cylinder banks 21,22 in a V-type layout. Although Figure 1 depicts six<br>
cylinders (N = 6), it can be appreciated that the engine 12 may include<br>
additional or fewer cylinders 20. For example, engines having 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8,<br>
10, 12 and 16 cylinders are contemplated. It is also appreciated that the<br>
present invention may be used in accordance with an inline-type cylinder<br>
configuration or any other type of configuration known in the art.<br>
[0021] The diesel engine system 10 may include a variable nozzle<br>
turbine (VNT) turbo 23 that pumps additional air into the intake manifold 14 for<br>
combustion. A throttle 25 may be adjusted to control air flow through the<br>
intake manifold 14 and into the cylinders 20 from the intake manifold 14. Fuel<br>
is injected into the cylinders 20 with the fuel injection system 16. Heat<br>
generated from compressed air ignites the air/fuel mixture. The exhaust<br>
gases exit the cylinders 20 to the exhaust system 18.<br><br>
GP-306877-PTE-CD<br>
5<br>
[0022] The exhaust system 18 includes exhaust manifolds 29 and<br>
30, exhaust conduits 33 and 34, a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) 31, and a<br>
diesel particulate filter (DPF) 32. Exhaust manifolds 29,30 direct the exhaust<br>
gases from corresponding cylinder banks 21,22 into exhaust conduits 33,34.<br>
The exhaust conduits 33,34 lead to an inlet 35 of the VNT turbo 23.<br>
[0023] The flow of exhaust gases through the VNT turbo 23<br>
generates power in the VNT turbo 23 sufficient to compress additional air into<br>
the intake manifold 14. The power generated may be varied by adjusting a<br>
cross sectional area of the inlet 35 controlling the rate of exhaust flow through<br>
the VNT turbo 23 and into the DOC 31. The DOC 31 oxidizes unburned<br>
hydrocarbons in the exhaust gases over a catalyst. Heat that is released<br>
during oxidation of the hydrocarbons increases the temperature of the<br>
exhaust gases. The heated exhaust gases burn soot particulates trapped in<br>
the DPF 32.<br>
[0024] An exhaust gas recirculation system includes a recirculation<br>
conduit 36 and an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve 37. The EGR valve<br>
37 recirculates exhaust gases into the intake manifold 14. The EGR valve 37<br>
may be modulated between open and closed positions to allow a partial flow<br>
of exhaust gases.<br>
[0025] A regeneration control system 42 regulates operation of the<br>
diesel engine system 10. A mass air flow (MAF) sensor 44 is responsive to<br>
mass air flow and generates a MAF signal 46 based thereon. A temperature<br>
sensor 48 is responsive to the temperature of exhaust gases from the DOC<br>
31 and generates a temperature signal 50 based thereon. An oxygen sensor<br>
52 is responsive to a concentration of oxygen in the exhaust gases from the<br>
DOC 31 and generates an exhaust oxygen-level signal 54 based thereon.<br>
The regeneration control system 42 receives the temperature signal 50 and<br>
the exhaust oxygen-level signal 54 and generates a control signal based<br>
thereon. Alternatively, the control signal may be based on the MAF signal 46,<br>
the temperature signal 50, and the exhaust oxygen-level sensor 54.<br><br>
GP-306877-PTE-CD<br>
6<br>
[0026] Referring now to Figure 2, a functional block diagram 70<br>
illustrates the regeneration control system 42 in further detail. The<br>
regeneration control system 42 may include a condition module 74 and an<br>
oxygen-level control module 76. The condition module 74 selectively<br>
generates an air flow reduction signal 80 based on the MAF signal 46, the<br>
temperature signal 50, and the exhaust oxygen-level signal 54. More<br>
specifically, the condition module 74 determines a maximum exhaust oxygen<br>
content based on a total exhaust flow rate of the exhaust system 18 , whether<br>
the temperature signal 50 is greater than a temperature threshold, and<br>
whether the exhaust oxygen-level signal 54 is greater than the maximum<br>
determined oxygen-level threshold. In a preferred embodiment the maximum<br>
oxygen content is determined from the MAF, which varies from 2 to 21 %, and<br>
the temperature threshold is 500 °C. An exemplary table that may be used to<br>
determine the maximum exhaust oxygen content based on the total exhaust<br>
flow rate of the exhaust system 18 is depicted in Figure 3. If the exhaust<br>
oxygen content is greater than the maximum value based on the MAF signal<br>
and the temperature signal 50 is greater than the temperature threshold, the<br>
condition module 74 generates the air flow reduction signal 80. The oxygen-<br>
level control module 76 generates a control signal 82 when the airflow<br>
reduction signal 80 is received. The control signal 82 is based on the oxygen-<br>
level signal 54 and may be used to control the EGR valve 37, the VNT turbo<br>
23, and/or the throttle 25 and consequently control the oxygen level of the<br>
DPF 32.<br>
[0027] The engine system 10 may not be operating in a preferred<br>
mode when the oxygen level is limited by the regeneration control system 42.<br>
Thus, the oxygen level is only limited for a predetermined period. A timer 84<br>
is set at the beginning of a regeneration event to track an elapsed time. The<br>
timer generates a disable signal 86 that is received by the condition module<br>
74 when the elapsed time exceeds the predetermined period. It may be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art that other elements capable of<br>
comprehending a particulate oxidation status may be used in place of the<br><br>
GP-306877-PTE-CD<br>
7<br>
timer 84 to determine when to stop limiting the oxygen level. The other<br>
elements can be empirically based and/or models capable of estimating when<br>
conditions for oxygen limitation are no longer needed. When the condition<br>
module 74 receives the disable signal 86, the airflow reduction signal 80 is no<br>
longer generated and the oxygen-level control module 76 does not limit the<br>
oxygen level.<br>
[0028] Referring now to Figure 4, a flowchart illustrating exemplary<br>
steps taken by the regeneration control system 42 are generally identified at<br>
100. Control starts in step 101 when the diesel engine system 10 is started.<br>
In step 102, control determines whether regeneration is activated. If<br>
regeneration has not been activated, control ends in step 103. If regeneration<br>
has been activated, the condition module 74 determines whether the<br>
temperature signal 50 (T) is greater than the temperature threshold (TTHR) in<br>
step 104. If the temperature signal 50 is not greater than the temperature<br>
threshold, control ends in step 103.<br>
[0029] In step 105, control starts the timer 84. The condition<br>
module 74 measures the MAF in step 106 and then determines the maximum<br>
exhaust content based on the MAF in step 107. In step 108, control<br>
compares the oxygen-level signal 54 (O2) to the oxygen threshold (O2THR)<br>
determined in step 107 to determine whether the oxygen level in the exhaust<br>
gas is too high. If O2 is greater than O2THR control proceeds to step 110. In<br>
step 110, the oxygen level in the exhaust gases is reduced. More specifically,<br>
the oxygen level is reduced by increasing EGR with the EGR valve 37,<br>
adjusting the inlet 35 of the VNT turbo 23, and/or adjusting the throttle 25. If<br>
O2 is not greater than O2THR control proceeds to step 112.<br>
[0030] In step 112 control determines whether the timer 84 has<br>
expired. If the timer 84 has expired, control generates the disable signal 86 to<br>
disable the condition module 74 in step 114 and control ends in step 103. If<br>
the timer 84 has not expired, control returns to step 106.<br><br>
