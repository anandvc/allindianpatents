TRANSMITTING OVERHEAD MESSAGE IN A MOBILE WIRELESS<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method of transmitting an overhead message,<br>
and more particularly, to a method of transmitting an overhead message in a mobile<br>
wireless communication system by syncing the slots of the control channel frame with<br>
the slots of the overhead message frame.<br>
Background Art<br>
The present invention relates to determining transmission and receiving slots of<br>
an overhead message for broadcast/multicast transmission in a Code Division Multiple<br>
Access (CDMA) 2000 system and mobile stations. The broadcast/multicast<br>
transmission is a transmission scheme by which data can be sent from one source to<br>
multiple sources. In broadcast mode, the mobile stations in the service area can receive<br>
the broadcast data by being in broadcast receiving mode. In multicast mode, the mobile<br>
stations in the service area can receive data by subscribing to a specified multicast<br>
service.<br>
The broadcast/multicast service (BCMCS) of CDMA 2000 can be described<br>
according to the following three categories. The first category relates to carrying out<br>
the BCMCS by using a Forward Broadcast Supplemental Channel (F-BSCH) shared<br>
 <br>
2<br>
WO 2006/095965		PCT/KR2006/000501<br>
by the mobile stations, which are in idle mode. The F-BSCH is appropriate for the<br>
broadcast environment, and at the same time, the F-BSCH is useful in transmitting<br>
information to unspecified number of mobile stations. Since the information is<br>
transmitted to unspecified number of mobile stations, which are in idle mode, before<br>
the traffic channel allocated, portion of transmission power from a base station should<br>
be fixedly allocated so that the mobile stations near the cell borders can receive the<br>
information as well.<br>
The second category relates to carrying out the BCMCS by using a Forward<br>
Broadcast Fundamental Channel (F-BFCH) shared by the mobile stations which are in<br>
traffic receiving mode. A method of using the F-BFCH is similar to Push-To-Talk<br>
(PTT) method in that the F-BFCH is useful in transmitting the information to a<br>
specified number of mobile stations. Here, the traffic channel is first allocated before<br>
the information can be transmitted. As such, the transmission power of the F-BFCH is<br>
controlled based on the status of other mobile stations sharing the channel and<br>
therefore, power can be controlled more efficiently.<br>
The third category relates to carrying out the BCMCS by using a Forward<br>
Broadcast Supplemental Channel (F-BSCH) shared by the mobile stations, which are<br>
in traffic receiving mode. The F-BSCH is useful in transmitting information to a small<br>
number of mobile stations in broadcast receiving mode in a cell. Consequently,<br>
transmission power consumption for transmitting broadcast service is low, and less<br>
Walsh code is used.<br>
 <br>
3<br>
WO 2006/095965		PCT/KR2006/000501<br>
In order for the mobile stations to receive the BCMCS, each mobile station has<br>
to receive from, a base station information related to broadcast/multicast service,<br>
information related to channels used to transmit broadcast/multicast service (e.g.,<br>
frequency, Walsh code, data rate, size of frame, and public long-code mask), and<br>
information related to mobile station registration, to name a few. These types of<br>
information are usually transmitted periodically via overhead messages, such as a<br>
Broadcast/Multicast Service Parameters Message (BSPM), for example. The mobile<br>
station in mode to receive the BCMCS receives an overhead message, such as the<br>
BSPM.<br>
More specifically, the BSPM can be transmitted periodically via a Paging<br>
Channel (PCH) or a Primary Broadcast Control Channel (P-BCCH). Figure 1<br>
illustrates a method of transmitting the BSPM via the PCH. In Figure 1, the PSPM-<br>
PERIOD_INDEX is 2. Moreover, the transmission duration is defined by (B + 1) slots<br>
of the PCH, where B is determined by Equation 1.<br>
[Equation 1]<br>
 <br>
In Equation 1, i is transmitted via BSPM_PERIOD_INDEX included in an<br>
Extended System Parameters Message.<br>
As for determining the first slot of each BSPM slot cycle, Equation 2 has to be<br>
satisfied.<br>
[Equation 2]<br>
 <br>
4<br>
WO 2006/095965		PCT/KR2006/000501<br>
 <br>
In Equation 2, t represents system time of the PCH frame rait. Furthermore, the<br>
reason for dividing the system time into four slots is because the duration of the PCH<br>
frame is different from the duration of the PCH slot. That is, since the duration of the<br>
PCH frame is 20ms and the duration of the PCH slot is 80ms, the system time is<br>
divided into four slots in order to express the BSPM slot cycle in PCH slot units.<br>
According to Equation 2, as shown in Figure 1, the BSPM slot cycle can be synced<br>
with the PCH slot.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a method of transmitting BSPM via the P-BCCH. In Figure<br>
2, BSPM-PERIOD_INDEX is 2, and the duration of the BCCH slot is 80ms. Moreover,<br>
the duration of the BSPM slot cycle is (B +1) slots of the BCCH, and B is determined<br>
by Equation 3.<br>
[Equation 3]<br>
 <br>
In Equation 3, i is transmitted via BSPM_PER1OD_1NDEX included in a<br>
Multi-Carrier Radio Resource (MC-RR) Parameters Message.<br>
To determine the first slot of each BSPM slot cycle, Equation 4 has to be<br>
satisfied.<br>
[Equation 4]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
5<br>
WO 2006/095965		PCT/KR2006/000501<br>
In Equation 4, t represents system time of the PCH frame unit. According to<br>
Figure 2, the duration of the BCCH is 40ms and the duration of the BCCH slot is 80ms.<br>
If the first slot of the BSPM slot cycle is calculated using Equation 4, the BCCH frame<br>
slots are not in sync. This is where the problem lies. In other words, since the first slot<br>
of the BSPM slot cycle can be selected from any one of 40ms, 80ms, and 160ms based<br>
on the BCCH data rates, the first slot of the BSPM slot cycle cannot be synced with the<br>
BCCH slot In short, the slots of the overhead message transmission cycle cannot be<br>
synced with the slots of the BCCH.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings<br>
to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
In BCCH, a maximum of eight slots can be allocated, and each BCCH can be<br>
classified by a Broadcast Control Channel Number (BCN). The BCCH having BCN of<br>
1 can be considered as the P-BCCH and is used to transmit the overhead message.<br>
Moreover, the BCCH having BCN of 2 can be considered a Secondary BCCH (S-<br>
BCCH) and is used to transmit the broadcast message. The BSPM, which is an<br>
overhead message used for transmitting the BCMCS, can be transmitted via the P-<br>
BCCH.<br>
The transmission data rate of the BCCH is determined by the BCCH data rates<br>
included in the Sync Channel Message, and the transmission data rate can be any one<br>
of following data rates - 4,800bps, 9,600bps, and 19,200bps, for example.<br>
The BCCH frame is comprised of plurality slots whose duration is 40ms.<br>
Furthermore, the slot of the BCCH can be any one of the following duration, i.e., 40ms,<br>
 <br>
9<br>
WO 2006/095965		PCT/KR2006/000501<br>
80ms, or 160ms, based on the BCCH transmission data rate. That is, if the BCCH<br>
transmission data rate is 19,200bps, the duration of the BCCH slot is 40ms. Also, if the<br>
transmission data rates of the BCCH are 9,600bps and 4,800bps, the durations of the<br>
BCCH slot is 80ms and 160ms, respectively.<br>
As described above, since the duration of the BCCH slot varies based on the<br>
BCCH data rates, the first slot of the BSPM slot cycle can be modified or adjusted<br>
according to the duration of the BCCH slot.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates an example of transmitting the BSPM via the P-BCCH. In<br>
Figure 3, BSPM_PERIOD_INDEX is 2 and the duration of the P-BCCH slot is 40ms.<br>
In the present embodiment, since the duration of the P-BCCH frame<br>
corresponding to system time is 40ms and the duration of the P-BCCH slot is 40ms,<br>
the first slot of title BSPM transmission slot cycle with respect to the system time can<br>
be determined by satisfying Equation 5.<br>
[Equation 5)<br>
t mod (B+l) -0<br>
In Equation S, B is determined as in Equation 3, and / represents the system time<br>
according to the P-BCCH frame. If the first slot of the BSPM transmission slot cycle is<br>
determined using Equation 5, the BSPM slot cycle can be synced with the P-BCCH<br>
frames as depicted in Figure 3.<br>
More specifically, for example, since the duration of the P-BCCH slot is 40ms and<br>
the duration of the P-BCCH frame of the system time is also 40ms, one-to-one<br>
 <br>
10<br>
WO 2006/095965		PCT/KR2006/000501<br>
correspondence exists between the two. As such, the BSPM slot cycle can be synced<br>
with the P-BCCH frames correspondingly.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates an example of transmitting the BSPM via the P-BCCH<br>
according to a second embodiment of the present invention. In Figure 4,<br>
BSPMJPERIOD_INDEX is 2, and the duration of the P-BCCH slot is 80ms.<br>
In the present embodiment, since the duration of the P-BCCH frame corresponding<br>
to the system time is 40ms and the duration of the P-BCCH slot is 80ms, there is no<br>
one-to-one correspondence as found in Figure 3. Therefore, the first slot of the BSPM<br>
transmission slot cycle with respect to the system time can be determined by satisfying<br>
Equation 6.<br>
[Equation 6]<br>
 <br>
In Equation 6, B is determined as in Equation 3, and t represents the system time<br>
according to the P-BCCH frame. If the first slot of the BSPM transmission slot cycle is<br>
determined using Equation 6, the BSPM slot cycle can be synced with the P-BCCH<br>
frames as illustrated in Figure 4.<br>
More specifically, for example, since the duration of the P-BCCH slot is 80ms and<br>
the duration of the P-BCCH frame is 40ms, two P-BCCH frames of the system time,<br>
each frame having duration of 40ms, can be combined to correspond with the duration<br>
of the P-BCCH slot.<br>
 <br>
11<br>
WO 2006/095965		PCT/KR2006/000501<br>
Figure 5 illustrates an example of transmitting the BSPM via the P-BCCH<br>
according to a third embodiment of the present invention. In Figure 5,<br>
B SPM_PERJOD_INDEX is 2, and the duration of the P-BCCH slot is 160ms.<br>
In the present embodiment, since the duration of the P-BCCH frame corresponding<br>
to the system time is 40ms and the duration of the P-BCCH slot is 160ms, there is no<br>
one-to-one correspondence as found in Figure 3. As such, the first slot of the BSPM<br>
transmission slot cycle with respect to the system time can be determined by satisfying<br>
Equation 7.<br>
[Equation 7]<br>
 <br>
In Equation 7, B is determined as in Equation 3, and t represents the system time<br>
according to the P-BCCH frame. If the first slot of the BSPM transmission slot cycle is<br>
determined by using Equation 7, the BSPM slot cycle can be synced with the P-BCCH<br>
frames as depicted in Figure 5.<br>
For example, since the duration of the P-BCCH slot is 160ms, four P-BCCH<br>
frames of the system time, each frame having duration of 40ms, can be combined to<br>
correspond with the duration of the P-BCCH slot.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates an example of transmitting the BSPM via the P-BCCH<br>
according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention where the duration of the P-<br>
BCCH frame corresponding to the system time is 20ms. Again, as in Figure 3, in<br>
Figure 6, BSPM_PERIOD_INDEX is 2 and the duration of the P-BCCH slot is 40ms.<br>
 <br>
12<br>
WO 2006/095965		PCT/KR2006/000501<br>
In the present embodiment, the duration of the P-BCCH frame corresponding to<br>
the system time is 20ms and the duration of the P-BCCH slot is 40ms, the first slot of<br>
the BSPM transmission slot cycle with respect to the system time can be determined by<br>
satisfying Equation 8.<br>
[Equation 8]<br>
 <br>
In Equation 8, B is determined as in Equation 3, and t represents the system time in<br>
20 frames. If the first slot of the BSPM transmission slot cycle is determined using<br>
Equation 8, the BSPM slot cycle can be synced with the P-BCCH frames as depicted in<br>
Figure 6.<br>
More specifically, for example, since the duration of the P-BCCH slot is 40ms and<br>
the duration of the P-BCCH frame corresponding to the system time is 40ms, one P-<br>
BCCH frame can be used to correspond with the duration of the P-BCCH slot of 40ms.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates an example of transmitting the BSPM via the P-BCCH<br>
according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention where the duration of the P-<br>
BCCH frame corresponding to the system time is 20ms. Again, as in Figure 4, in<br>
Figure 7, BSPM_PERIOD_INDEX is 2, and the duration of the P-BCCH slot is 80ms.<br>
In the present embodiment, since the duration of the P-BCCH frame corresponding<br>
to the system time is 40ms and the duration of the P-BCCH slot is 80ms, the first slot<br>
of the BSPM transmission slot cycle with respect to the system time can be determined<br>
by satisfying Equation 9.<br>
 <br>
13<br>
WO 2006/095965		PCT/KR2006/000501<br>
[Equation 9]<br>
 <br>
In Equation 9, B is determined as in Equation 3, and t represents the system time in<br>
20 frames. If the first slot of the BSPM transmission slot cycle is determined using<br>
Equation 9, the BSPM slot cycle can be synced with the P-BCCH frames as illustrated<br>
in Figure 7.<br>
More specifically, for example, since the duration of the P-BCCH slot is 80ms and.<br>
the duration of the P-BCCH frame corresponding to the system time is 40ms, two P-<br>
BCCH frames, each frame having duration of 40ms, can be grouped to correspond<br>
with the duration of the P-BCCH slot of 80ms.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates an example of transmitting the BSPM via the P-BCCH<br>
according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention where the duration of the P-<br>
BCCH frame corresponding to the system time is 20ms. Again, as in Figure 5, in<br>
Figure 8, BSPM_PERIOD_INDEX is 2, and the duration of the P-BCCH slot is 160ms.<br>
In the present embodiment, since the duration of the P-BCCH frame corresponding<br>
to the system time is 40ms and the duration of the P-BCCH slot is 160ms, the first slot<br>
of the BSPM transmission slot cycle with respect to the system time can be determined<br>
by satisfying Equation 10.<br>
[Equation 10]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
14<br>
WO 2006/095965		PCT/KR2006/000501<br>
In Equation 10, B is determined as in Equation 3, and t represents the system time<br>
in 20 frames. If the first slot of the BSPM transmission slot cycle is determined by<br>
using Equation 10, the BSPM slot cycle can be synced with the P-BCCH frames as<br>
depicted in Figure 8.<br>
For example, since the duration of the P-BCCH slot is 160ms, four P-BCCH<br>
frames corresponding to the system time, each frame having duration of 40ms, can be<br>
combined to correspond with the duration of the P-BCCH slot of 160ms.<br>
In the descriptions of above, the BSPM is transmitted through the BCCH.<br>
However, the application of the present invention is not limited to BCCH or BSPM.<br>
The present invention can be further applied to transmission of overhead messages,<br>
which is transmitted based on a specified slot cycle, via a control channel. Here, the<br>
control channel represents the durations of the slots which change correspondingly to<br>
the data rates.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and<br>
variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or<br>
scope of the inventions. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the<br>
modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of<br>
the appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
