Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention,<br>
examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same<br>
reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. For<br>
convenience of explanation, a Blu-ray disc (BD) is taken as an example of an optical disc<br>
according to the present invention. Yet, it is apparent that the concept of the present invention,<br>
which is characterized in an optical disc having its disc control information recorded thereon, is<br>
applicable to DVD-RAM/-RW/+RW/-R/+R and the like for example in the same manner.<br>
Besides, although terms used in the present invention are possibly selected from the currently<br>
 well-known ones, some terms are arbitrarily chosen by the applicant in some cases so that their<br>
meanings are explained in detail in the following description. Hence, the present invention<br>
should be understood with the intended meanings of the corresponding terms chosen by the<br>
applicant instead of the simple names or meanings of the terms themselves.<br>
First of all, 'disc identification information' used in the description of the present invention<br>
 means the information distinguishing a specific disc from other discs. As various discs show up<br>
lately, informations enabling to identify them respectively are needed. Specifically, the present<br>
invention is characterized in identifying a disc type interoperating with a disc protecting method.<br>
Disc types applicable to the present invention are exemplarily explained in detail by referring to<br>
FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B as follows. For reference, Blu-ray discs (BD) are taken as examples of<br>
optical discs shown in FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B, which are identically applicable to a general optical<br>
disc.<br>
FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B show disc types, respectively.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B, a substrate, recording layer, and cover layer are sequentially<br>
stacked from a top surface of a disc. And, a bottom surface of the disc is optionally coated with a<br>
protective coating that can be called 'hard coating' as well.<br>
Namely, FIG. 1A shows a case that a protective coating is formed and FIG. IB shows a case that<br>
a protective coating is not formed. A disc surface protecting method as a reference of identifying<br>
a disc type according to the present invention is explained in the following.<br>
First of all, an optical disc is a storage medium enabling to record vast amount of data within a<br>
limited size and is conveniently portable. A disc surface is always exposed to an external<br>
environment to become vulnerable to damages caused by various reasons. For instance, the disc<br>
surface may be contaminated by user's fingerprints due to a careless user and the like or can be<br>
scratched.<br>
It is apparent that the damaged part of the disc surface will affect the recording/reproducing of<br>
the corresponding disc considerably. Specifically, in case of an optical beam of a high-density<br>
disc such as Blu-ray disc (BD) is much shorter than that of a previous disc, such a damaged part<br>
may become fatal to an operation of the disc.<br>
In order to prevent the data loss caused by the external factors such as fingerprint, scratch, etc,<br>
the following countermeasures are provided by optical disc standards.<br>
First of all, a protective coating, as shown in FIG. 1 A, is provided to a disc surface. The presence<br>
of the protective coating plays a role in directly protecting the disc surface against the external<br>
factors. There exist various kinds of protective coatings. For instance, there is one protective<br>
coating persistent against either scratches or fingerprints. And, there is another protective coating<br>
persistent against both of the scratches and the fingerprints. These protective coatings are called<br>
hard coatings. Respectively.<br>
Secondly, it is previously checked that a corresponding disc has strength exceeding a specific<br>
reference against the external factors via disc surface test in the course of manufacturing the<br>
corresponding disc. The checked disc is then provided to a user. Hence, a method of testing a<br>
disc surface should be previously provided as specified information. And, there may exist<br>
various kinds of disc surface tests. For instance, there may be an anti-scratch test, anti-fingerprint<br>
test, and anti-scratch/fingerprint test.<br>
Thirdly, a cartridge may be provided to protect a disc from an external environment. The<br>
cartridge holds a disc therein to encapsulate so that a disc surface is fully cut off from outside.<br>
Yet, once the cartridge is loaded in a recording/reproducing apparatus (FIG. 10), a predetermined<br>
portion of the cartridge is open to provide a passage of an optical beam emitted from a pickup<br>
('11' in FIG. 10), thereby enabling the corresponding recording/reproducing of the optical disc.<br>
Thus, the cartridge plays a role in protecting the disc. Specifically, a use of the cartridge may be<br>
occasionally mandatory for a recordable disc. Lately, a detachable cartridge is provided to load a<br>
disc therein if necessary to use.<br>
Such a disc surface protecting countermeasure as a protective coating, disc surface test, and<br>
cartridge is utilized as a direct disc surface protecting method. And, there may be a secondary<br>
protecting method of protecting data within a disc in a manner of forming error-resistant data via<br>
signal processing within a recording/reproducing unit ('10' in FIG. 10) on performing the<br>
recording/reproducing on the disc or providing a defect management area within a disc to replace<br>
a defective area by a normal area.<br>
The present invention relates to a protective coating, disc surface test, and cartridge for<br>
preventing a disc surface from being directly damaged. Namely, a disc manufacturer records disc<br>
identification information, which informs whether a corresponding disc is provided with at least<br>
one of the disc surface protecting countermeasures against the external factors or which disc<br>
surface protecting countermeasure is provided to the corresponding disc, in a management area<br>
within the disc, and an optical recording/reproducing apparatus (FIG. 10) then refers to the<br>
recorded disc identification information in recording/reproducing.<br>
Hence, the major technical background of the present invention is characterized in that disc<br>
identification information for presence or non-presence of a protective coating, a completion of<br>
disc surface test, or a necessity of cartridge use is provided as specified information within a disc,<br>
whereby a user or control unit ('20' in FIG. 10) can utilize it in recording/reproducing.<br>
FIG. 2 is a structural diagram of a single-layer disc having one recording layer according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a lead-in area is provided as a management area on an inner circumference<br>
area of an optical disc, whereas a lead-out area is provided as a management area on an outer<br>
circumference area of the optical disc. Specifically, the inner circumference area of the optical<br>
disc is divided into a prerecorded area and a rewritable or write-once area.<br>
The prerecorded area is an area where data was already written in the course of manufacturing<br>
the disc, whereby a user or system is unable to perform data writing on the prerecorded area at<br>
all. In BD-RE/WO, the prerecorded area is named PIC (permanent information and control data)<br>
area. And, disc information (hereinafter called 'DI') as information required for disc recording is<br>
recorded in the PIC area.<br>
In a data area, provided are a user data area where user's real data is recorded and spare areas<br>
ISA and OSA to replace a generated defect area. Specifically, TDMA (temporary defect<br>
management area) for recording information of defect and general managements is provided to<br>
such a write-once optical disc as BD-WO. In case of the re-writable BD (BD-RE), TDMA is<br>
unnecessary so that such an area is left as a reserved area.<br>
In the description of the present invention, 'disc information' means an area or information<br>
including various information for disc recording/reproducing. And, the disc information is a<br>
general name of the information within a prerecorded or embossed area to be provided to a disc<br>
user by a disc manufacturer. Yet, the disc information is provided not only to the prerecorded<br>
area but also to a recordable area according to a user's request. And, the disc information within<br>
the prerecorded or embossed area can be copied to the recordable area as well, for example.<br>
Moreover, the 'disc information' applicable to the BD may be called 'physical format<br>
information' in DVD-RAM/-RW/+RW/-R/+R.<br>
Hence, it is apparent that the technical background of the present invention be identically<br>
applicable to 'physical format information' in DVD-RAM/-RW/+RW/-R/+R. For convenience<br>
of explanation, 'disc information (hereinafter abbreviated DI)' corresponding to a case of Blu-<br>
ray disc (BD) is taken as an example in the following description of the present invention.<br>
The present invention intends to record various identification information identifying a disc type<br>
according to a disc surface protecting scheme in a prerecorded. Since management information<br>
recorded in the prerecorded area is always read out to be taken into consideration for recording<br>
or reproducing. Hence, the prerecorded area is optimal for providing new disc identification<br>
information as specified information.<br>
Specifically, in case of BD-RE/WO, the PIC area as the prerecorded area is recorded by biphased<br>
high-frequency modulated signals, the high-frequency modulated signals in the corresponding<br>
area are played back according to a specific playback method, and information is acquired from<br>
the corresponding playback. Yet, it is a matter of course that a recording method in the<br>
prerecorded area should be differently applied according to the corresponding disc specification,<br>
e.g., DVD specification, CD specification, etc.<br>
FIG. 3 is a structural diagram of a PIC area in the disc shown in FIG. 2. As mentioned in the<br>
foregoing description, it means that information can be rearranged like the structure of the PIC<br>
area in FIG.34 when the entire information within the high-frequency modulated PIC area is<br>
acquired.<br>
A method of configuring disc information (DI) in the PIC area is explained in detail as follows.<br>
In BD-RE/WO, 'one cluster' represents a minimum recording unit, five hundred forty-four<br>
clusters gather to construct one fragment as one upper recording unit, and total five fragments<br>
gather to form the PIC area. Disc information is recorded in a front head cluster of a first<br>
fragment IFO. The disc information is plurally recorded per recording layer and writing speed<br>
applicable by the corresponding optical disc, and one disc information includes one hundred<br>
twelve bytes. Specifically, disc information constructed with 112-bytes is called a disc<br>
information (DI) frame. Moreover, the same contents of the disc information are repeatedly<br>
recorded in each front head cluster of the rest fragments, thereby enabling to cope with loss of<br>
the disc information.<br>
Information representing the corresponding recording layer, information representing writing<br>
speed, and write strategy information coping with the writing speed are recorded within the disc<br>
information each. Moreover, disc type identification information is recorded within the disc<br>
information as well. Hence, by utilizing such information in the recording or reproducing of the<br>
corresponding optical disc, it is able to provide optimal write power per disc type and per writing<br>
speed.<br>
Various embodiments for a method of recording identification information including disc type<br>
information within the disc information according to the present invention is explained in detail<br>
by referring to FIGs. 4 to 11 as follows.<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram of recording disc identification information using disc information according<br>
to one embodiment of the present invention, in which disc identification information is recorded<br>
according to presence or non-presence of a protective coating as one of disc surface protecting<br>
schemes.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, a plurality of disc informations are recorded within a disc, a sequence<br>
number is given to each of the disc informations to decide a sequence order, and the sequence<br>
order is recorded by 1-byte. For instance, the corresponding information is recorded in 5* byte<br>
within the disc information, which is named 'DI frame sequence number in DI block' field and is<br>
briefly indicated by 'OOh, Olh, 02h, 03h ...'. Namely, if the information of the 5th byte is 'OOh', it<br>
means 1st disc information. And, if the information of the 5* byte is '03h', it means 4* disc<br>
information.<br>
And, a write strategy (WS) interoperating with the speed meant by the corresponding disc<br>
information is recorded in a specific area, which is named 'Write Strategy parameters' field by<br>
Lth~111th bytes, within the disc information. Moreover, identification information enabling to<br>
identify a disc type depending on a presence or non-presence of a protective coating on a disc<br>
surface is recorded in another specific area, which is named 'Disc layer' field by Nth byte, within<br>
the disc information.<br>
The identification information allocates a specific recognition value to each of the disc types to<br>
be defined as follows. For instance, if '0000 0001b', the specific recognition value means a non-<br>
protective coating disc. If '0000 0010b', the specific recognition value means a protective<br>
coating disc.<br>
Hence, in case of the non-protective coating disc, a user should be more cautious to use the<br>
corresponding disc. And, a recording/reproducing unit ('10' in FIG. 10) enables to inform the<br>
user of such a fact with a guide message form to enhance use efficiency of the disc. An optical<br>
disc recording/reproducing method via the recording/reproducing unit ('10' in FIG. 10) will be<br>
explained in detail later.<br>
FIG. 5 is a diagram of recording disc identification information using disc information according<br>
to another embodiment of the present invention, in which a protective coating type can be<br>
identified in case of a protective coating disc.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, it can be defined in the following manner. If 'Disc layer' field in Nth byte of<br>
disc information is '0000 0001b', it means a non-protective coating disc. If 'Disc layer' field in<br>
Nth byte of disc information is '0000 0010b', '0000 0100b', or '0000 1000b', it means a<br>
protective coating disc as well as identification information enabling to identify a protective<br>
coating type each. For instance, if '0000 0010b', it means an anti-scratch protective coating is<br>
formed. If '0000 0100b', it means an anti-fingerprint protective coating is formed. If '0000<br>
1100b', it means an anti-scratch &amp; anti-fingerprint protective coating is formed to prevent both<br>
fingerprint and scratch. Specifically, if the Nth byte is set to '0000 1000b', it can be interpreted as<br>
a protective coating enabling to protect a disc surface against all external factors.<br>
Hence, in case of forming a protective coating on a disc surface, a disc manufacturer enables to<br>
record information of a type of the corresponding protective coating, and more particularly,<br>
information informing which external factor(s) can be prevented within disc information. In case<br>
of the protective coating indicated by '0000 1000b' to be resistant against the entire external<br>
factors, the recorded information can be utilized as information informing that the corresponding<br>
disc can be used as a non-cartridge or bare disc. Besides, 5 and Lth~111th bytes correspond to<br>
those in FIG. 4, of which explanation is skipped.<br>
FIG. 6 is a diagram of recording disc identification information using disc information according<br>
to a further embodiment of the present invention, in which a disc surface is tested by a specified<br>
method as one of the disc surface protecting countermeasures to record disc type information<br>
according to a result of the test.<br>
In this embodiment of the present invention, 'disc surface test' is to record information<br>
indicating whether a final disc surface such as a cover layer and protective layer is tested by a<br>
specified test method regardless of presence or non-presence of a protective coating. Hence,<br>
completion of the test is as good as proving that the corresponding disc is resistant against a<br>
specific external factor.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, it can be defined in the following manner. If 'Disc layer' field in Nth byte of<br>
disc information is '0000 0001b', it means 'non-Disc Test' failing to perform a disc surface test.<br>
If 'Disc layer' field in Nth byte of disc information is '0000 0010b', '0000 0100b', or '0000<br>
1000b', it means a disc surface test is performed as well as identification information enabling to<br>
identify a protective coating type each. For instance, if '0000 0010b', it means an anti-scratch<br>
test is performed as a disc surface test. If '0000 0100b', it means an anti-fingerprint test is<br>
performed as a disc surface test. If '0000 1100b', it means an anti-scratch &amp; anti-fingerprint test<br>
is performed as a disc surface test against both fingerprint and scratch. Specifically, if the N*<br>
byte is set to '0000 1000b', it can be interpreted that the disc surface test against all external<br>
factors is performed.<br>
Moreover, a method of identifying a disc type according to a disc surface test like FIG. 7 can be<br>
recorded together with a case of identifying a disc type according to presence or non-presence of<br>
the protective coating in FIG. 4 or FIG. 5. For instance, by dividing 'Disc layer' field of Nth byte<br>
of disc information by 4-bits each, information for presence or non-presence of the disc surface<br>
test is provided to a first 4-bits and another information indicating presence or non-presence of<br>
the protective coating is provided to a second 4-bits. In doing so, the second 4-bits can indicate<br>
the presence or non-presence of the protective coating like FIG. 4 (e.g.l) or the type of the<br>
protective coating like FIG. 5 (e.g.2).<br>
FIG. 8 is a diagram of recording disc identification information using disc information according<br>
to another further embodiment of the present invention, in which disc type information is<br>
recorded according to presence or non-presence of necessity of using a cartridge as one of the<br>
disc surface protecting countermeasures.<br>
As mentioned in the foregoing description, cartridge use is one of the disc surface protecting<br>
countermeasures and can be individually used regardless of the protective coating. In case that<br>
the protective coating fails to exist, the cartridge use is necessary in general. Yet, the information<br>
about the presence or non-presence of the protective coating may not coincide with the<br>
information about the presence or non-presence of the necessity of the cartridge use. Hence, the<br>
information for the necessity of the cartridge use needs to be separately provided.<br>
Hence, a method of identifying a disc type according to the necessity of the cartridge use like<br>
FIG. 8 can be recorded together with a case of identifying a disc type according to presence or<br>
non-presence of the protective coating in FIG. 4 or FIG. 5. For instance, by dividing 'Disc layer'<br>
field of Nth byte of disc information by 4-bits each, information for the necessity of the cartridge<br>
use is provided to a first 4-bits and another information indicating presence or non-presence of<br>
the protective coating is provided to a second 4-bits. In doing so, if the first 4-bits is '0000b', it<br>
means the cartridge needs to be used. If the first 4-bits is '0001b', it means the cartridge need not<br>
be used. Moreover, the second 4-bits can indicate the presence or non-presence of the protective<br>
coating like FIG. 4 (e.g. 1) or the type of the protective coating like FIG. 5 (e.g.2).<br>
FIG. 9 is a diagram of recording disc identification information using disc information according<br>
to another further embodiment of the present invention, in which disc type information<br>
combining presence or non-presence of a protecting coating, presence or non-presence of a disc<br>
surface test, and presence or non-presence of necessity of using a cartridge is recorded as disc<br>
identification information within disc information.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, it is defined that presence or non-presence of necessity of using a cartridge,<br>
presence or non-presence of completion of a disc surface test, and presence or non-presence of a<br>
protecting coating are recorded in a first 2-bits, second 3-bits, and third 3-bits of 'Disc layer'<br>
field of Nth byte of disc information. And, by applying the disc type identifying method adopted<br>
in FIGs. 4 to 8, each area is recorded.<br>
Namely, if the Nth byte is '00 001 001b', it means both of the non-presence of the protective<br>
coating on the corresponding disc and the non-presence of the completion of the disc surface test<br>
to define that the corresponding disc needs to use the cartridge. If '01 101 101b' is written in the<br>
Nth byte, it means the presence of the protective coating taking all external factors (Type3) and<br>
the completion of the entire disc surface tests to define that the corresponding disc needs not to<br>
use the cartridge.<br>
As can be understood by the various methods of recording the disc type information described in<br>
FIGs. 4 to 9, the disc type information of the present invention as specified information between<br>
a disc manufacturer and a recording/reproducing apparatus (FIG. 10) is recorded within the disc<br>
information as a management area of the disc. Hence, the recording/reproducing apparatus (FIG.<br>
10) recognizes the current state of the disc correctly to provide a guide message for using the<br>
disc to a final user on reproducing the disc, thereby enabling to enhance efficiency of using the<br>
disc.<br>
Meanwhile, a recording/reproducing method and apparatus of an optical disc using the above-<br>
recorded disc identification information recorded within the disc information are explained in the<br>
following description of FIG. 10 and FIG. 11.<br>
FIG. 10 is a block diagram of an optical disc recording/reproducing apparatus applicable to the<br>
present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, a recording/reproducing apparatus according to the present invention<br>
includes a recording/reproducing unit 10 carrying out recording/reproducing on an optical disc<br>
and a control unit 20 controlling the recording/reproducing unit 10. The control unit 20 gives a<br>
recording or reproducing command for a specific area, and the recording/reproducing unit 10<br>
carries out the recording/reproducing on the specific area according to the command of the<br>
control unit 20.<br>
Specifically, the recording/reproducing unit 10 includes an interface unit 12 performing<br>
communications with an external device, a pickup unit 11 directly recording data on the optical<br>
disc or reproducing the data, a data processor 13 receiving a reproducing signal from the pickup<br>
unit 11 to restore into a necessary signal value or modulating to deliver a signal to be recorded<br>
into a signal to be recorded on the optical disc, a servo unit 14 reading out a signal from the<br>
optical disc correctly or controlling the pickup unit 11 to record a signal on the optical disc<br>
correctly, a memory 15 temporarily storing various informations including a management<br>
information and data, and a microcomputer 16 responsible for controlling the above-described<br>
elements within the recording/reproducing unit 10. Besides, in case that the apparatus fails to<br>
include the control unit 20, it is able to design the apparatus in a manner that a microcomputer 16<br>
enables to perform the functions of the control unit 20.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
A reproducing process of an optical disc according to the present invention is explained in detail<br>
by referring to FIG. 10 and FIG. 11 as follows.<br>
First of all, once an optical disc is loaded in the recording/reproducing apparatus, the entire disc<br>
management information within the disc is read out to be temporarily stored in the memory 15 of<br>
the recording/reproducing unit 10. And, various kinds of the disc management information are<br>
utilized for the recording/reproducing of the optical disc. Specifically, the management<br>
information stored in the memory includes the disc information of the present invention,<br>
whereby the disc type information recorded within the disc information is read out to be stored in<br>
the memory 15 as well. Moreover, the disc type information interoperates with the presence or<br>
non-presence of the protective coating, presence or non-presence of the disc surface test, or<br>
presence or non-presence of the necessity of the cartridge use to be decided and recorded.<br>
Once the control unit 20 delivers the recording/reproducing command for recording/reproducing<br>
a signal recorded in a specific location of the currently loaded optical disc to the<br>
recording/reproducing unit 10, the recording/reproducing unit 10 performs the<br>
recording/reproducing command of the control unit 20 in a following manner. Namely, the<br>
recording/reproducing unit 10 performs the corresponding recording/reproducing using the<br>
various management information previously read to be stored. In case that an error exceeding a<br>
predetermined reference Ts takes place in the course of the recording/reproducing, the<br>
corresponding occurrence can be provided to a user via display device 30. hi providing the<br>
corresponding occurrence, it is also able to guide a separate countermeasure according to the<br>
previously read disc type.<br>
For instance, when an error exceeding a predetermined reference Ts occurs in case that a disc<br>
type corresponds to 'non-protective coating', the control unit 20 can provide 'Guide message-3'<br>
displaying that 'cautious of high probability of error occurrence due to non-protective coating<br>
disc'.<br>
When an error exceeding a predetermined reference Ts occurs in case that a disc type<br>
corresponds to 'protective coating' and 'anti-scratch protective coating' (Typel), the control unit<br>
20 can provide 'Guide message-1' displaying that 'Cleanse a possibly-contaminated disc surface<br>
by cloth or spray softly'.<br>
When an error exceeding a predetermined reference Ts occurs in case that a disc type<br>
corresponds to 'protective coating' and 'anti-fingerprint protective coating' (Type2), the control<br>
unit 20 can provide 'Guide message-2' displaying that 'Check a possibly-scratched disc surface'.<br>
The guide message-1, -2, and -3 are just exemplary, and it is apparent that various guide<br>
message can be provided in various ways and that a guide message according to presence or non-<br>
presence of disc surface test or cartridge use necessity can be provided as well as the presence or<br>
non-presence of the protective coating.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides the various specified methods of recording disc<br>
identification information according to disc surface protecting schemes in a management area of<br>
a high-density optical disc, thereby enabling to efficiently cope with the recording/reproducing<br>
of the optical disc by utilizing the recorded identification information.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be<br>
made in the present invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the<br>
modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the<br>
appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
