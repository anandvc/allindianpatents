"SUBSTITUTED PYRIDINES AND PYRIDAZINES WITH ANGIOGENESIS INHIBITING ACTIVITY"<br>
BAYER     CORPORATION,      100     Bayer     Road,     Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15205, U.S.A,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
WO 01/23375<br><br>
PCT/IJS00/26500<br><br>
Substituted Pyridines and Pyridazines with Angiogenesis Inhibiting Activity<br>
FIELD:<br>
5	This application relates to small molecule heterocyclic pharmaceuticals, and more<br>
particularly,  to  substituted pyridines  and pyridazines having  angiogenesis  inhibiting activity.<br>
BACKGROUND:<br>
10	Vasculogenesis involves the de novo formation of blood vessels from endothelial<br>
cell precursors or angioblasts. The first vascular structures in the embryo are formed by vasculogenesis. Angiogenesis involves the development of capillaries from existing blood vessels, and is the principle mechanism by which organs, such as the brain and the kidney are vascularized. While vasculogenesis is restricted to embryonic development, 15 angiogenesis can occur in the adult, for example during pregnancy, the female cycle, or wound healing.<br>
One major regulator of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in both embryonic development and some angiogenic-dependent diseases is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; also called vascular permeability factor, VPF). VEGF represents a family 20 of mitogens isoforms resulting from alternative mRNA splicing and which exist in homodimeric forms. The VEGF KDR receptor is highly specific for vascular endothelial cells (for reviews, see: Farrara et al. Endocr. Rev. 1992, 13, 18; Neufield et al. FASEB J. 1999, 13, 9).<br>
VEGF expression is induced by hypoxia (Shweiki et al. Nature 1992, 359, 843), as 25      well as by a variety of cytokines and growth factors, such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor-a and -pTo date VEGF and the VEGF family members have been reported to bind to one or more of three transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (Mustonen et al. J. Cell Biol, 1995, 129, 895), VEGF receptor-1 (also known as fit-1 (fms-like tyrosine kinase-1)); 30 VEGFR-2 (also known as kinase insert domain containing receptor (KDR), the murine analogue of KDR being known as fetal liver kinase-1 (flk-1)); and VEGFR-3 (also known as flt-4). KDR and fit-1 have been shown to have different signal transduction properties (Waltenberger et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1994, 269, 26988); Park et al. Oncogene 1995, 10, 135).   Thus, KDR undergoes strong ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation in intact<br>
1<br><br>
WO 01/23375<br><br>
PCT/USOO/26500<br><br>
cells, whereas fit—1  displays a weaker response.    Thus, binding to KDR is a critical requirement for induction of the full-spectrum of VEGF-mediated biological responses.<br>
In vivo, VEGF plays a central role in vasculogenesis, and induces angiogenesis and permeabilization of blood vessels. Deregulated VEGF expression contributes to the development of a number of diseases that are characterized by abnormal angiogenesis and/or hyperpermeability processes. Regulation of the VEGF-mediated signal transduction cascade will therefore provide a useful mode for control of abnormal angiogenesis and/or hyperpermeability processes.<br>
Angiogenesis is regarded as an absolute prerequisite for growth of tumors beyond about 1-2 mm.  Oxygen and nutrients may be supplied to cells in tumors smaller than this limit through  diffusion.     However, -every tumor is  dependent  on  angiogenesis  for continued growth after it has reached a certain size.   Tumorigenic cells within hypoxic regions of tumors respond by stimulation of VEGF production, which triggers activation of quiescent endothelial cells to stimulate new blood vessel formation. (Shweiki et al. Proc. Nat'I. Acad. ScL, 1995, 92, 768).   In addition, VEGF production in tumor regions where there is no angiogenesis may proceed through the ras signal transduction pathway (Grugel et al. J. Biol. Chem., 1995, 270, 25915; Rak et al. Cancer Res. 1995, 55, 4575). In situ hybridization studies have demonstrated VEGF mRNA is strongly upregulated in a wide variety of human tumors, including lung (Mattern et al. Br. J. Cancer 1996, 73, 931), thyroid (Viglietto et al. Oncogene 1995, 11, 1569), breast (Brown et al. Human Pathol. 1995, 26, 86), gastrointestional tract (Brown et al. Cancer Res. 1993, 53, 4727; Suzuki et al.   Cancer Res. 1996, 56, 3004), kidney and bladder (Brown et al. Am. J. Pathol. 1993, 1431, 1255), ovary (Olson et al. Cancer Res. 1994, 54, 1255), and cervical (Guidi et al. J. Nat'I Cancer Inst. 1995, 87, 12137) carcinomas, as well as angiosacroma (Hashimoto et al. Lab. Invest. 1995, 73, 859) and several intracranial tumors (Plate et al. Nature 1992, 359, 845; Phillips et al. Int. J. Oncol. 1993, 2, 913; Berkman et al. J.- Clin. Invest., 1993, 91, 153).' Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to KDR have been shown to be efficacious in blocking tumor angiogenesis (Kim et al. Nature 1993, 362, 841; Rockwell et al. Mol. Cell. Differ. 1995, J, 315).<br>
Overexpression of VEGF, for example under conditions of extreme hypoxia, can lead to intraocular angiogenesis, resulting in hyperproliferation of blood vessels, leading eventually to blindness. Such a cascade of events has been observed for a number of retinopathies, including diabetic retinopathy, ischemic retinal-vein occlusion, retinopathy of prematurity (Aiello et al. New Engl. J. Med. 1994, 331, 1480; Peer et al. Lab. Invest.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 01/23375<br><br>
PCT/USOO/26500<br><br>
1995, 72, 638), and age-related macular degeneration (AMD; see, Lopez et al. Invest. Opththalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996,37,855).<br>
In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the in-growth of vascular pannus may be mediated by<br>
production of angiogenic factors.    Levels of immunoreactive VEGF are high in the<br>
5      synovial fluid of RA patients, while VEGF levels were low in the synovial fluid of<br>
patients with other forms of arthritis of with degenerative joint disease (Koch et al. J.<br>
Immunol. 1994, 152, 4149).   The angiogenesis inhibitor AGM-170 has been shown to<br>
prevent neovascularization of the joint in the rat collagen arthritis model (Peacock et al. J.<br>
Exper. Med. 1992, 175, 1135).<br>
10	Increased VEGF expression has also been shown in psoriatic skin, as well as<br>
bullous disorders associated with subepidermal blister formation, such as bullous pemphigoid, erythema multiforme, and dermatitis herpetiformis (Brown et al. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995, 104, 744).<br>
Because inhibition of KDR signal  transduction leads to inhibition of VEGF-15      mediated angiogenesis and permeabilization, KDR inhibitors will be useful in treatment of diseases characterized by abnormal angiogenesis and/or hyperpermeability processes., including the above listed diseases<br>
Examples of phthalazines and other fused pyridazines that are similar in structure to those of the present application  are disclosed in the following patents or patent 20      applications: WO 9835958 (Novartis), US 5,849,741, US 3,753,988, US 3,478,028 and JP 03106875.   Other literature references to phthalazines are El-Feky, S.A., Bayoumy, B.E., and Abd El-Sami, Z.K., Egypt. J. Chem. (1991), Volume Date 1990, 33(2),  189-197; Duhault, J., Gonnard, P., and Fenard, S., Bull. Soc. Chirm Biol., (1967), 49 (2), 177-190; and Holava, H.M. and Jr, Partyka, R.A., J. Med.  Chem., (1969),  12, 555-556.    The 25      compounds of the present invention arc distinct from those described in each of the above references, and only the Novartis publication describes such compounds as inhibitors of angiogenesis.<br>
As explained above, compounds which inhibit angiogenesis have applicability in treatment of a variety of medical conditions, and are therefore desirable.   Such materials 30      are the subject of the present application.<br>
SUMMARY:<br>
In its broadest aspect, the present invention relates to the sum of three sets of chemical compounds, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof, with each<br>

set overlapping the others in scope. The generalized structural formula for the compounds in each of the three sets of compounds is the same, but it should be noted that the definitions of the several groups comprising the' general structure in each set differ somewhat.

It will also be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any given patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including, but not 10      limited to the activity of the specific compound employed, the age of the patient, the body weight of the patient, the general health of the patient, the gender of the patient, the diet of the patient, time of administration,  route  of administration,  rate of excretion,  drug combinations, and the severity of the condition undergoing therapy.   It will be further appreciated by one skilled in the art that the optimal course of treatment, i.e., the mode of 15       treatment   and   the   daily   number   of  doses   of  a   compound   of  Formula   I   or   a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof given for a defined number of days, can be ascertained by those skilled in the art using conventional treatment tests.<br>
GENERAL PREPARATIVE METHODS<br>
20<br>
The compounds of the invention may be prepared by use of known chemical<br>
reactions and procedures.   Nevertheless, the following general preparative methods are<br>
presented to  aid the reader in synthesizing the KDR inhibitors,  with more detailed<br>
particular, examples being presented below in the experimental section describing the<br>
25       working examples.<br>
All variable groups of these methods are as described in the generic description if<br>
they are not specifically defined below. When a variable group or substiruent with a given<br>
symbol (i.e. R3, R4, R , G1, G2, G3, or G4) is used more than once in a given structure, it is<br>
to be understood that each of these groups or substituents may be independently varied<br>
30      within the range of definitions for that symbol.  As defined above, the compounds of the<br>
invention contain ring units each of which may independently bear between 0 and 5<br>
substituents G1, G\ or G , which are not defined as H. By contrast, it is to be noted that in<br>
the general method schemes below, the G , G3, or G4 substituents are used as if their<br>
definition includes H, to show where such G1, GJ, or G4 substituents may exist in the<br>
30<br><br>
WO 01/23375	PCT7USO0/265O0<br>
'	,       -,	.<br>
structures, and for ease in drawing.    No change in the definition of G , G , or G   is<br>
intended by this non-standard usage, however.   Thus, only for purposes of the general<br>
method schemes below, G , G , or G may be H in addition to the moieties set forth in the<br>
definitions of G1, G3, or G . The ultimate compounds contain 0 to 5 non-hydrogen groups<br>
G', G3, or G4.<br>
Within these general methods the variable M is equivalent to the moiety<br>
-(CR42)p-(7(W)q<br>
—'	in which each variable group or substituent is allowed to<br>
independently vary within the limits defined earlier for that symbol.<br>
10	Within these general methods the variable Q is equivalent to the moiety<br>
A-B<br>
q in which L is N and each other variable group or substituent is<br>
allowed to independently vary within the limits defined earlier for that symbol.<br>
Within these general methods the variable Q2 is equivalent to the moiety<br>
A-B L7/    (V-b=E&gt;G3}<br>
Q   in   which   each   variable   group   or   substituent   is   allowed   to<br>
15      independently vary within the limits defined earlier for that symbol.<br>
It is recognized that compounds of the invention with each claimed optional<br>
functional group cannot be prepared with each of the below-listed methods.   Within the<br>
scope of each method optional substituents are used which are stable to the reaction<br>
conditions, or the functional groups which may participate in the reactions are present in<br>
20      protected form where necessary, and the removal of such protective groups is completed<br>
at appropriate stages by methods well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
General Method A  - The compounds of formula I-A in which X, M, and Q~ are<br>
defined as above, Y is -CH2-0-, -CH2-S-, -CH2-NH-, -0-, -S-, or -NH-, and R1 and R2 25 together with the carbons to which they are attached form a fused 5-membered- ring aromatic heterocycle, hal is halogen (CI, Br, F, or I but preferably CI, Br or F) are conveniently prepared according to a reaction sequence as shown in Method A. Thus, a heterocycle of formula II in which R is lower alkyl can be made by one skilled in the art according to the corresponding published procedures in the reference table. In the cases 30      of thiophene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (table entry  1)  and pyrazole-3,4-dicarboxy!ic acid<br>

PCT/USO0/26500<br><br>
(table entry 10), the carboxylic acids are converted to methyl or ethyl esters by treatment with the corresponding alcohol and catalytic mineral acid (typically sulfuric acid) at reflux.  The diester of formula II is treated with hydrazine hydrate to furnish intermediate III (for specific reaction conditions see Robba, M.; Le Guen, Y. Bull. Soc. Chem. Fr.. 5      1970 12 4317).   Compound III is treated with a halogenating agent such as phosphorous oxychloride,   phosphorous   oxybromide,   phosphorous  pentabromide,   or  phosphorous pentachloride to yield dihalo intermediate IV. The dichloro or dibromo intermediates can be converted to the difluoro intermediate (when desired) by reaction with hydrogen fluoride.  By using iodo reagents such as potassium iodide or tetrabutylammonium iodide 10      in subsequent steps, the iodo intermediate is formed in the reaction mixtures without being isolated as a pure substance.   Dihalo intermediate IV is treated with a nucleophile of formula V in refluxing alcohol or other suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethoxyethane (DME), dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), or the like to furnish the intermediate of formula VI.   Such condensations can also be done in a 15      melt free of solvent and can be catalyzed by acids such as  HCl or bases such as triethylamine or l,8-diazobicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU).   The compound of formula VI is reacted with compounds of formula VII in a suitable aprotic solvent such as DMSO, DMF or solvent free often with a basic catalyst such as DBU or CsCCv, or a crown ether such as   18-crown-6 at temperatures usually between room temperature and reflux to 20      furnish invention compound of formula I-A. It is understood that the nature of the starting materials will dictate the choice of suitable solvents, catalyst (if used) and temperature by one skilled in the art.   Intermediates of formula V and VII are often commercial or are conveniently prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. For example see Martin, I., et al. Acta. Chem. Scand..  1995 49 230 for the preparation of VII in which Y is 25      -CH2-O- and Q2 is 4-pyridyl substituted by a 2-aminocarbonyl group (2-CONH2).<br>

General Method B   - The compounds of formula I-B in which M, X, and Q2 are as   defined   above  and   Y  is  -CH2-0-,  -CH2-S-,   -CH2-NH-,   -O-,   -S-,   or  -NH-. are conveniently prepared as shown in Method B.  According to a procedure described in the literature   (Tomisawa   and   Wang,   Chem.   Pharm.   Bull,   21,   1973,   2607,   2612), isocarbostyril VIII is reacted with PBrs in a melt to form 1,4-dibromoisoquinoline IX. Intermediate IX is treated with, a nucleophile of formula V in refluxing alcohol to furnish intermediate of formula X.   Such condensations can also be done in a melt free of solvent and can be catalyzed by acids such as HC1 or bases such as triethylamine or  1,8-diazobicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). The compound of formula X is reacted with compounds of formula VII in a suitable aprotic solvent such as DMSO, DMF or solvent free often with a basic catalyst such as DBU or CSCO4 at elevated temperatures to furnish invention compound of formula I-B.   This method is most useful when Y is -CH2-S- or -S-.<br>

General Method C   - The compounds of formula I-C in which M, X, R.1, R2, m and Q2 are defined as above are conveniently prepared according by a reaction sequence 5      as shown in method C.   In this method m is preferably 0 and R   and R2 together with the carbons to which they are attached form a fused benzene or fused 5-member ring aromatic heterocycle.   Starting material XI is either commercial or is prepared by one skilled in the art as shown in the reference table below.   Starting material XI is reacted with urea or ammonia, usually at elevated temperature and pressure (in the case of ammonia), to form 10      imide XII.   The imide is reacted with an aldehyde XIII in acetic acid "and piperidine at reflux to yield intermediate XIV.  Reaction of XIV with sodium borohydride in methanol or other suitable solvents according to the general procedure described by I.W. Elliott and Y. Takekoshi (J. Heterocyclic Chem. 1976 13, 597) yields intermediate XV. Treatment of XV with a suitable halogenatmg agent such as POCl3, POBr3, PCI5, PBr5 or thionyl 15      chloride yields halo intermediate XVI which is reacted with nucleophile of formula V in refluxing alcohol to furnish invention compound of formula I-C. Such condensations can also be done in a melt free of solvent and can be catalyzed by acids such as HC1 or bases such  as  triethylamine  or   l,8-diazobicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene  (DBU).     Alternatively, reagent V can be condensed with intermediate XV be heating the two components with 20      P2O5 in a melt to yield invention compound of structure I-C.    This last method is especially effective when X is an amine linker.<br>

General Method D  - The compounds of formula I-D-l in which R1, R , Rs, M, X,<br>
Y, G3 and Z are defined as above and q is 0 or 1 are conveniently prepared via a reaction sequence as shown in Method D. Thus, pyridine substituted pyridazines or pyridines (I-D-1) are functionalized into substituted 2-aminocarbonyl pyridines of formula (I-D-2) by the use of formamides (XVII) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and iron salts, according to a procedure described in the literature (Minisci et al. Tetrahedron, 1985, 41, 4157). This method works best when R and R2 together constitute a fused aromatic heterocycle or fused aromatic carbocycle. In those cases that Z is CH and R and R do not form a fused aromatic, an isomeric side product in which Z is CCONHR can be formed and, if so formed, is removed from the desired product by chromatography.

General Method E - The compounds of formula I-E-l and I-E-2 in which R1, R2, R6, M, X, Y, G3, and Z are defined as above, q is 0 or 1, and R3 is lower alkyl are conveniently prepared via a reaction sequence as shown in Method E.   Thus, pyridine substituted   pyridazines 'or  pyridines   (I-D-l)   are   functionalized   into   substituted   2-alkoxycarbonyl pyridines of formula (I-E-l) by the use of monoalkyloxalates (XVIII) in the presence of S2CV2, acid and catalytic amounts of AgNC&gt;3, according to a procedure described in the literature (Coppa, F. et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 1992, 33 (21), 3057). Compounds of formula I-E-l in which R3 is H are then formed by hydrolysis of the ester with a base such as sodium hydroxide in methanol / water.  Compounds of formula I-E-2 in which the Rs groups are independently defined as above, but especially including those compounds in which neither R6 is H, are conveniently prepared from the acid (I-E-l, R3 = H) by treatment with amine XIX in the presence of a coupling agent such as DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide). This method works best when R  and R  together constitute a fused aromatic heterocycle or fused aromatic carbocycle.   In those cases that Z is CH and R' and R2 do not form a fused aromatic, an isomeric side product in which Z is CCO2R3 can be formed in the first step and, if so formed, is removed from the desired product by chromatography.<br>

Such condensations can also be done in a melt free of solvent and can be catalyzed by acids such as HC1 or bases such as triefhylamine or 1,8-diazobicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU).   Alternatively, reagent V can be condensed with intermediate XXII be heating the two components with P2O5 in a melt to yield XXII. This last method is especially effective when X is an amine linker.

Acta Chem. Scand. 1995, 49, 230-232 or those of methods D or E above by substituting readily available pyridine-4-carboxylic ester XXX for I-D-l are used to convert XXX into XXXI. Reduction of the ester as described-by Martin, et al. above is next done with a mild reducing agent such as NaBHU such that the amide substiruent is left unchanged to yield alcohol XXXII. This alcohol is then heated with a base such as DBU or CsC04 with halopyridazine VI from method A under anhydrous conditions to yield the invention compound with formula I-H.<br>

General Method I - Invention compounds having formula I-I in which the R1, R2, M, X, R6, q, and G3 are defined as above and W is a bond or -CH2- are conveniently prepared via a reaction sequence as shown in Method I.  This method is especially useful when q is 1 and XXXIII is 4-chloropyridine.  Alternatively, other 4-halopyridines such as 4-fluoropyridine or 4-bromopyndine can be used in this process.    Thus readily available 4-halopyridines XXXIII are converted to intermediates of formula XXXIV by using the general procedures of methods D or E above by substituting the 4-halopyridine for I-D-l. Reaction of XXXIV with either potassium or sodium hydrogen sulfide yields a thiol having formula XXXV.   Alternatively, the alcohol function of intermediate XXXII from method H is converted to a leaving group by reaction with methanesulfonyl chloride and a suitable base such as triethylamine in the cold such that polymeric material formation is minimized and the resultant intermediate is reacted with either potassium or sodium hydrogen sulfide to. yield a thiol having formula XXXVI.    Either thiol have formula XXXV or formula XXXVI is reacted with intermediate VI from method A and a suitable base such as diisopropylethylamine or CSCO4 in DMF or other suitable anhydrous solvent or in the absence of solvent to yield I-D-9.<br>

5      sulfone within the structure are conveniently prepared via a reaction sequence as shown in Method J.   Reaction of compounds of this invention that contain a thioether group either as part, of a substituent G1, G3, or G4or as part of Y as shown in the representative structure I-I from Method I can be converted to the invention compounds with a sulfoxide moiety such as I-J-l by treatment with one equivalent of m-chloroperbenzoic acid in methylene 10      chloride or chloroform (MCPBA, Synth. Commun., 26,  10,   1913-1920,  1996) or by treatment with sodium periodate in methanol/water at between 0 °C and room temperature (J. Org. Chem., 58, 25, 6996-7000, 1993).    The expected side products consisting of mixtures of various N oxides and the sulfone I-J-2 can be removed by chromatography. The sulfone I-J-2 is obtained by the use of an additional equivalent of MCPBA or 15      preferably by use of potassium permanganate in acetic acid/water (Eur. J. Med. Chem. Then, 21, -1, 5-8, 1986) or by use of hydrogen peroxide in acetic acid (Chem. Heterocycl. Compd.,  15,   1085-1088,  1979).

General Method K - Invention compounds having formula I-K in which the R1, R2, M, X, and Q1 are defined as above are conveniently prepared via a reaction sequence •    as shown in Method K.    One skilled in the art prepares starting materials of structure XXXVII by methods known in the literature.   For example XXXVII wherein R.1 and R2 10      together with the carbons to which they are attached form a 2,3-substituted thiophene, furan, pyrrole, cyclopentadienyl,  oxazole or thiazole are prepared using the general chemistry given in J. Org. Chem., 1981, 46, 211 and hydrolizing the initially formed tert-butyl ester with trifluoroacetic acid.   The pyrazole starting material can be prepared by reacting   2-oxo-3-pentyn-l,5-dioic   acid   (J.    Chem.   Phys.    1974,    60,    1597)   with 15      diazomethane.    The starting material wherein R   and R   together with the carbons to which they are attached form a phenyl are prepared by the methods of Cymerman-Craig et al., Aust. J. Chem. 1956, 9, 222, 225. Compounds of formula XXXVII in which R' and R2 are lower alkyl are conveniently prepared according to procedures given in patent CH 482415  (Chem. Abstr.   12026lu,   1970).     The crude diacid  of formula XXXVII is 20      subsequently treated with hydrazine to  furnish pyridazinone XXXVIII  (for  specific reaction conditions see Vaughn, W. R.; Baird, S. L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1946 68 1314). Pyridazinone  XXXVIII  is. treated  with   a  chlorinating  agent  such   as  phosphorous oxychloride to yield an intermediate dichloro species which undergoes hydrolysis upon aqueous workup to furnish chloropyridazine XXXIX.  Chloro acid XXXIX is treated with 25   .  a nucleophile of formula V in the presence of a base such "as sodium hydride in a solvent such as DMF or in the absence of a solvent. The resultant acid XXXX is reduced with a reducing agent such as BFfj'THF according to the procedure of Till ey, J. W.; Coffen D. L. Schaer, B. H.; Lind,' J. J. Org. Chem. 1987 52 2469.

Method A-l: Equal equivalents of dichloride (1) and M-NH2 are refluxed in the appropriate amount of absolute ethanol at 95 °C for 2 hrs. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and the precipitate (2) that forms is filtered and washed sequentially with isopropyl alcohol, 4.0 N KOH, H2O, and hexane, and then dried.  The filtrate (2) is then reacted with 1.2 equivalent of Q-NH2 in an appropriate amount of n-butyl alcohol at 150 °C for 10 hrs. The reaction is cooled to room temperature before the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure.  The residue is treated with aqueous 4.0 N KOH solution and extracted with dichloromefhane.   The organic layer is dried (MgS04) and   evaporated.      The   crude   product   (3)   is   purified   by   preparative   thin   layer chromatography     (TLC)      or     flash     chromatography     on     silica     gel     using dichloromethane/methanol (95:5) as the eluent.   Final product is confirmed by LC/MS and/or NMR. The invention compounds of Examples 23 - 25, 48, and 76-80 as shown in the below table were prepared by method A-l.<br><br><br><br><br>

Method A-3: One equivalent of dichloride (1) and one equivalent of M-NH2 are<br>
suspended in DME (0.3M) and water is added until a solution was formed.  The reaction<br>
mixture is heated to 65 °C for 48 h. After cooling to it, the resulting precipitate is filtered<br>
and washed with DME to provide the intermediate product (2) which is confirmed by<br>
LC/MS and NMR..  In some instances, intermediate (2) is further purified by preparative<br>
TLC or washed with other solvents. A suspension of (2) (1 equiv), carbinol (3) (3 equiv),<br>
and 18-crown-6 (10 mol %) in toluene (0.3M) is stirred at it for 10 min. KOH (3 equiv) is<br>
then added and the reaction mixture is heated to 80 °C for 24 h.  After cooling to rt, water<br>
is added and the mixture is stirred vigorously until a suspension is formed.    The<br>
suspension  is  filtered  and washed  with water  to  provide  the  desired  product  (4).<br>
Preparative TLC and/or washing with other solvents is used to further purify final<br>
products in some examples.    The final products are assigned by LC/MS and NMR<br>
spectroscopy.     Final product is confirmed by LC/MS  and/or NMR.    The invention<br>
compounds of Examples 34 - 47, 49-74,  and 81 — 82D as shown in the below table were<br>
prepared by method A-3.<br><br>

detector, a YMC Pro CI8 2.0 mm x 23 mm column , and a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization. Gradient elution from 90% A to 95% B over 4 minutes was used on the HPLC. Buffer A was 98% water, 2% Acetonitrile and 0.02% TFA. Buffer B was 98% Acetonitrile, 2% water and 0.018% TFA. Spectra were scanned from 140-1200 amu using a variable ion time according to the number of ions in the source.<br>
Examples 106 - 114: Preparation of Salts of Example 14.<br>
The product.of Example 14 (1.50 g, 3.66 mmol) was stirred as a slurry in methanol (20 ml) as a solution of toluenesulfonic acid hydrate (0.701 g, 3.67 mmol) in methanol (5 ml plus 5 ml rinse) was added quickly dropwise.   All materials dissolved over 5 min to yield a yellow solution.   Anhydrous ether (30 ml) was added and stirring was continued for 5 minutes until solid began to precipitate.   The resultant mixture was chilled with stirring in an ice/water bath for 45 minutes and then the solid title product (Example 104) was collected by filtration, washed with ether and dried at 55 °C in a vacuum oven until NMR analysis showed a lack of solvents (1.5 hours).  Other compounds were prepared in a similar way by using a variety of acids rather than toluenesulfonic acid.   Scale up and use of less methanol in the first step generally led to quicker precipitation of salts and a variety of solvents were used rather than ether, as indicated, to help crystalize the individual salts.   In some cases the methanol was first removed by evaporation in vacuo. Final drying took between 1.5 hours and several days, depending on the quantity of material and the specific specific acid used.<br>

glycerol, 0.005% Triton X-100, 1 mM -mercaptoethanol, with or without 3.3 uM ATP), 5<br>
ul of the diluted compounds were added to a final assay volume of 100 uL    Final<br>
concentrations were between 10 uM, and 0.3 nM in 0.25% DMSO.   The assay was<br>
initiated by the addition of lOul (30 ng) of KDR kinase domain.<br>
5	The assay was incubated with test compound or vehicle alone with gentle agitation<br>
at room temperature for 60 minutes. The' wells were washed and phosphotyrosines (PY) were probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine (PY), mAb clone 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). PY/anti-PY complexes were detected with an anti-mouse IgG/HRP conjugate (Amersham International pic, Buckinghamshire, England). 10 Phosphotyrosine was quantitated by incubating with 100 |il 3, 3', 5, 5' tetramethylbenzidine solution (Kirkegaard and Perry, TMB Microwell 1 Component peroxidase substrate). Color development was arrested by the addition of 100 p.1 1% HC1-based stop solution (Kirkegaard and Perry, TMB 1 Component Stop Solution).<br>
Optical densities were determined spectrophotometrically at 450 nm in a 96-welI 15      plate reader, SpectraMax 250-(Molecular Devices).   Background (no ATP in assay) OD values were subtracted from all ODs and the percent inhibition was calculated according to the equation:<br>
% Inhibition = (OD(vehicle control) - OD(with compound)) X 100<br>
20	OD(vehicle control) - OD(no ATP added)<br>
The IC50 values were determined with a least squares analysis program using compound concentration versus percent inhibition.   Compounds that have IC50  1,000 nM include those of examples 26, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 41, 77, 80, 81, and 94.

Cell mechanistic assay-Inhibition of 3T3 KDR phosphorylation:<br>
NIH3T3 cells expressing the full length KDR receptor were grown in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, low glucose, 25 mM /L sodium pyruvate, pyridoxine hydrochloride and 0.2 mg/ ml of 5 G418 (Life Technologies Inc., Grand Island, NY). The cells were maintained in collagen I-coated T75 flasks (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA) in a humidified 5% C02' atmosphere at 37°C.<br>
Fifteen thousand cells were plated into each well of a collagen I-coated 96-well<br>
plate in the DMEM growth medium.    Six hours later, the cells were washed and the<br>
10      medium was replaced with DMEM without serum.  After overnight culture to quiesce the<br>
cells,   the   medium   was   replaced   by   Dulbecco's   phosphate-buffered   saline   (Life<br>
Technologies Inc., Grand Island, NY) with 0.1% bovine albumin (Sigma Chemical Co., St<br>
Louis, MO).   After adding various concentrations (0-300 nM) of test compounds to the<br>
cells in 1% final concentration of DMSO, the cells were incubated at room temperature<br>
15      for 30 minutes.   The cells were then treated with VEGF (30 ng / ml) for 10 minutes at<br>
room temperature.   Following VEGF stimulation, the buffer was removed and the cells<br>
were lysed by addition of 150 ul of extraction buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.8, supplemented<br>
with 10% glycerol, 50 mM BGP, 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaF, 0.5 mM NaV04, and 0.3%<br>
TX-100) at 4°C for 30 minutes.<br>
20	To assess receptor phosphorylation, 100 microliters of each cell lysate was added<br>
to the wells of an ELISA plate precoated with 300 ng of antibody C20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz , CA). Following a 60-minute incubation, the plate was washed and bound KDR was probed for phosphotyrosine using an anti-phosphotyrosine mAb clone 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). The plate was washed and 25 wells were incubated with anti-mouse IgG/HRP conjugate (Amersham International pic, Buckinghamshire, England) for 60 minutes. Wells were washed and phosphotyrosine was quantitated by addition of 100 ul per well of 3,3',5,5' tetramethylbenzidine (Kirkegaard and Perry, TMB Microwell 1 Component peroxidase substrate) solution. Color development was arrested by the addition of 100 ul 1% HCI based stop solution 30      (Kirkegaard and Perry, TMB 1 Component Stop Solution).<br>
Optical densities (OD) were determined spectrophotometrically at 450 nm in a 96-well plate reader (SpectraMax 250, Molecular Devices). Background (no VEGF added) OD values were subtracted from all ODs and percent inhibition was calculated according to the equation:<br>

Matrigel® Angiogenesis Model:<br>
Preparation of Matrigel Plugs and in vivo Phase: Matrigel® (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) is a basement membrane extract from a murine tumor 15      composed primarily of laminin, collagen IV and heparan sulfate proteoglycan.    It is provided as a sterile liquid at 4° C, but rapidly forms a solid gel at 37° C.<br>
Liquid Matrigel at 4° C was mixed with SK-MEL2 human tumor cells that were transfected with a plasmid containing the murine VEGF gene with a selectable marker. Tumor cells were grown in vitro under selection and cells were mixed with cold liquid 20 Matrigel at a ratio of 2 X 10 per 0.5 ml. One half milliliter was implanted subcutaneously near the abdominal midline using a 25 gauge needle. Test compounds were dosed as solutions in Ethanol/ Cremaphoi EL/saline (12.5%:12.5%:75%) at 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg po once daily starting on the day of implantation. Mice were euthanized 12 days post-implantation and the Matrigel pellets were harvested for analysis of hemoglobin 25      content,<br>
Hemoglobin Assay: The Matrigel pellets were placed in 4 volumes (w/v) of 4° C Lysis Buffer (20mM Tris pH 7.5, ImM EGTA, ImM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 [EM Science, Gibbstown, N.J.], and complete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail [Mannheim, Germany]), and homogenized at 4°C. Homogenates were incubated on ice 30 for 30 minutes with shaking and centrifuged at 14K x g for 30 minutes at 4° C. Supematants were transferred to chilled microfuge tubes and stored at' 4° C for hemoglobin assay.<br>
Mouse hemoglobin (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was suspended in autoclaved water (BioWhittaker, Inc, Walkersville, MD.) at 5 mg/ ml.  A standard curve<br>

WO 01/23375<br><br>
PCT/USOO/26500<br><br>
was generated from 500 micrograms/ml to 30 micrograms/ml in Lysis Buffer (see above). Standard curve and lysate' samples were added at 5 microliters /well in duplicate to a polystyrene 96-well plate. Using the Sigma Plasma Hemoglobin Kit (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), TMB substrate was reconstituted in 50 mis room temperature acetic 5 acid solution. One hundred microliters of substrate was added to each well, followed by 100 microliters /well of Hydrogen Peroxide Solution at room temperature. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes.<br>
Optical densities were determined spectrophotometrically at 600 nm in a 96-well ,  plate reader, SpectraMax 250 Microplate Spectrophotometer System (Molecular Devices, 10      Sunnyvale, CA). Background Lysis Buffer readings were subtracted from all wells.<br>
Total sample hemoglobin content was calculated according to the following equation:<br>
Total Hemoglobin = (Sample Lysate Volume) x (Hemoglobin Concentration) 15<br>
The average Total Hemoglobin of Matrigel samples without cells was subtracted from each Total Hemoglobin Matrigel sample with cells. Percent inhibition was calculated according to the following equation:<br>
20	% Inhibition = (Average Total Hemoglobin Drug-Treated Tumor Lysates) X 100<br>
(Average Total Hemoglobin Non-Treated Tumor Lysates)<br>
Example 8 showed significant activity in this assay at 100 and 300 mg/kg po sid with &gt; 60% inhibition of total hemoglobin content of the Matrigel samples from the dosed 25      animals vs. those from vehicle control animals.  The other examplary materials were not tested in this model.<br>
