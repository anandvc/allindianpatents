				<td>This invention relates to an apparatus for coating flavours on rice.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In the known art, flavoured rice is prepared in the kitchen by using flavours like garlic, tomato, masala, methi, lemon, onion, jeera etc. The drawback in this known process of preparing flavoured rice is that consistency in flavour in rice is not reproducible.<br>
The objective of this invention is to obviate the above drawback and develop an apparatus for coating rice with flavours which when cooked produce consistent flavours.<br>
To achieve the said objective, this invention provides an apparatus for coating<br>
rice with any flavour comprising:<br>
rice tank for storing rice to be coated with flavours,<br>
the said rice tank has at least two rotary valves at its bottom for<br>
metering and releasing the rice from said tank to at least two<br>
hydrators,<br>
a flavour tank for storing flavour in homogenized powder form,<br>
the said flavoured tank is connected to one of said two hydrators<br>
for mixing said flavour powder to not more than one third of the<br>
rice released from rice tank to the first hydrator,<br>
the said mixed rice from the first hydrator is transferred to the<br>
second hydrator where two-third of the rice from the rice tank is<br>
present, the entire rice is then mixed in presence of water mist, and<br>
vacuum creator means to create vacuum in both the hydrators to<br>
evaporate superficial moisture which in turn makes the effective<br>
flavour coating on the rice.<br>
The said flavour tank is equipped with vibrators, feeder vibrators and pneumatic surge line to maintain flow-ability of the flavour in homogenized powder form.<br>
The said vibratory feeder blends the said flavoured powder with rice in the ratio 0.1%-2.5% depending upon the particular flavour.<br>
The water is supplied to the hyorators through metering pump.<br>
The discharge of both the hydrators is connected to discharge controlling device to adjust the residence time for effective coating of the flavour on the rice and thereafter packing the coated rice for marketing.<br>
The suction airflow means is provided with the hydrators to maintain airflow 6 m3/min for creating vacuum.<br>
The water supply means is provided to maintain water condition in the said hydrators is volume 2. 5 to 4.2 It /min and pressure 1.5-4 Kg/cm2 to form mist in the said hydrators.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows the apparatus for coating flavours on rice according to this invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows the flavour tank equipped with feeder vibrators and pneumatic surge line according to this invention.<br>
Referring to the drawings, (1) shows the rice tank for storing rice to be coated. The said tank (1) has rotary valves (2a &amp; 2b) at its bottom for releasing and metering the rice to the hydrators (3 &amp; 4). A flavour tank (8) for storing flavours in homogenized powder form is connected to the hydrator (3). Suction air means (5, 6 &amp; 7) are connected to the hydrators (3 &amp; 4) for sucking the air. The hydrator (3) is connected to a hydrator (4). The rice from the tank (1) is metered and released to the hydrators (3 &amp; 4). The quantity of rice released by the rotary valve (2a) to the hydrator (3) is not more than one third and the remaining rice two-third is released by the rotary valve (2b) to the hydrator (4). The flavour in the homogenized powder form is released from the flavour tank (8) to the hydrator (3) and is mixed with rice. The said mixed rice is then transferred to the hydrator (4) where two-third of the rice from the rice tank is there. The entire rice is then mixed in presence of water mist. Vacuum is created in both the hydrators (3 &amp; 4) by vacuum creating means to evaporate the superficial moisture, which in turn makes the effective flavour coating on the rice.<br>
Figure2 shows the flavour tank equipped with vibrators (V) in top portion and middle portion, air surge (AS) is connected to the tank just after the middle portion and vibrator feeder is connected at the bottom portion to maintain flowability of flavour in homogenized powder form.<br>
The said rice is then discharged through the discharge controlling devices (F) connected to said hydrators and packed for commercial marketing. The discharge controlling device (F) adjusts the residence time for effective coating of flavour on the rice before packing the coated rice for marketing.<br>
The suction air-flow in the apparatus is 6 m3/min and the water condition is volume 2.5 to 4.2 It /min and pressure 1.5-4 Kg/cm2<br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	An apparatus for coating rice with any flavour comprising:<br>
rice tank for storing rice to be coated with flavours,<br>
the said rice tank has at least two rotary valves at its bottom for<br>
metering and releasing the rice from said tank to at least two<br>
hydrators,<br>
a flavour tank for storing flavour in homogenized powder form,<br>
the said flavoured tank is connected to one of said two hydrators<br>
for mixing said flavour powder to not more than one third of the<br>
rice released from rice tank to the first hydrator,<br>
the said mixed rice from the first hydrator is transferred to the<br>
second hydrator where two-third of the rice from the rice tank is<br>
present, the entire rice is then mixed in presence of water mist, and<br>
vacuum creator means to create vacuum in both the hydrators to<br>
evaporate superficial moisture which in turn makes the effective<br>
flavour coating on the rice.<br>
2.	An apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein said flavour tank is equipped<br>
with vibrators, feeder vibrators and pneumatic surge line to maintain<br>
flow-ability of the flavour in homogenized powder form.<br>
3.	An apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein said vibratory feeder blends<br>
the said flavoured powder with rice in the ratio 0.1%-2.5% depending<br>
upon the particular flavour.<br>
4.	An apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein the water is supplied to the<br>
hydrators through metering pump.<br></td>
