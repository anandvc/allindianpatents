				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a combination vaccine comprising a mixture of antigens for protection against diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio. The present invention also relates to inclusion of one or more antigens in the said combination vaccine, for protection against infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Hepatitis virus, and other pathogens, such that administration of the vaccine can simultaneously immunize a subject against more than one pathogen. The invention in particular relates to a fully liquid stable combination vaccine comprising the antigens as indicated above and the methods for manufacturing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Antigens of the vaccine<br>
Diphtheria and Tetanus antigens<br>
Diphtheria and tetanus are acute infections caused by Cornyebacterium diphtheriae and Clostridium tetani, respectively. The toxins of these bacteria are the major cause of the respective diseases. The vaccines affording protection against these bacteria contain these toxins that are toxoided to lose their infectivity. The toxins are treated using chemicals such as formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde for making toxoids [diphtheria toxoid (DT) and Tetanus toxoid (TT)]. CRM 197, a mutant diphtheria toxin, is also used in certain vaccines.<br>
Pertussis antigens<br>
The whooping cough disease or the pertussis is caused by Bordetella pertussis. This is a debilitating and serious disease that may even lead to death. The initial vaccines against the disease were based on the whole cells which were treated with chemicals such as formaldehyde to kill the cells and inactivate the toxic materials. Efforts to develop an inactivated whole-cell pertussis vaccine began soon after B. pertussis was grown in pure culture in 1906. In the 1920s Dr. Louis W. Sauer developed a vaccine for whooping cough. In 1925, the Danish physician Thorvald Madsen was the first to test a whole-cell pertussis vaccine on a wide scale. In 1942, the American scientist Pearl Kendrick combined the whole-cell pertussis vaccine with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids to generate the first DTP combination vaccine. These vaccines called as the 'whole cell<br>
<br>
 <br>
(wP) vaccines' were highly efficacious.<br>
The later vaccine called the 'component vaccine' comprised lesser number of highly purified antigens. Many virulence associated factors have been suggested for the inclusion in the 'acellular vaccine', which is less defined as compared to component vaccine. The vaccines comprising only PT were partially protective, whereas the vaccines comprising the combination of PT/FHA were more efficacious but still had lesser immunogenicity than the wP vaccines.<br>
Poliomyelitis antigens<br>
Two different kinds of vaccine are available:<br>
•	A live attenuated (weakened) oral polio vaccine (OPV) developed by Dr. Albert Sabin in 1961. OPV, comprising the Sabin strains, is given orally.<br>
•	An inactivated (killed) polio vaccine (IPV) developed in 1955 by Dr. Jonas Salk. IPV, comprising the Salk strains, is given as an injection.<br>
Both live attenuated (OPV) and inactivated (IPV) polio vaccines have been effective in controlling the polio disease worldwide. The polio vaccine may comprise the Salk or the Sabin strains. Mahoney type 1, MEF Type 2 and the Saukett type 3 are the Salk strains that have been used in the vaccine against the poliomyelitis disease. The Sabin strains include the Sabin 1 and Sabin 2 strains.<br>
Haemophilus influenzae (Hib) antigens<br>
Haemophilus influenzae is a Gram-negative coccobacillus that is a normal part of upper respiratory tract flora. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib b) is a major cause of meningitis invasive bloodborne infections in young children and major cause of meningitis in the first 2 years of life. Immunization against Haemophilus influenzae began in Canada in 1987 with a polysaccharide vaccine [polyribose ribitol phosphate (PRP)]. The polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) capsule of Hib is a major virulence factor for the organism. Antibody to PRP is the primary contributor to serum bactericidal activity, and increasing levels of antibody are associated with decreasing risk of invasive disease. PRP is a T-cell independent antigen and hence is characterized<br>
<br>
 <br>
by a) induction of a poor antibody response in less than 18-month-old infants and children, b) a variable and quantitatively smaller antibody response than that seen with T-cell dependent antigens, c) production of a higher proportion of immunoglobulin M (IgM), and d) inability to induce a booster response.<br>
The initial vaccines based only on the PRP component proved to be ineffective in the infants. Further efforts were directed towards the PRP conjugate vaccine, wherein the PRP is conjugated to proteins called the carrier proteins such as the outer membrane protein of Neisseria meningitides, diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid and CRM 197.<br>
Hepatitis (Hep) antigens<br>
There are various strains of Hepatitis virus. Hepatitis B is a disease caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) which infects the liver of hominoidae, including humans, and causes an inflammation called hepatitis. It ranges in severity from a mild illness, lasting a few weeks (acute), to a serious long-term (chronic) illness that can lead to liver disease or liver cancer. The vaccine against the disease contains one of the viral envelope proteins, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The FDA approved Hep B containing vaccines are Recombivax HB® and Comvax® by Merck, Engerix-B® and Pediarix® by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.<br>
Other antigens<br>
The other antigens that the human race is concerned include Haemophilus influenzae (a, c, d, e, f serotypes and the unencapsulated strains), Hepatitis (A, C, D, E, F and G strains), meningitis A, B or C, Influenza, Pneumococci, Streptococci, anthrax, dengue, malaria, measles, mumps, rubella, BCG, Japanese encephalitis, Rotavirus, smallpox, yellow fever, typhoid, Singles, Varicella virus, and others.<br>
Combination vaccines<br>
<br>
 <br>
In spite of the long decades of research in the field of vaccines, the infectious diseases remain a threat to the human kind. Combination vaccines that protect against various diseases are very desirable since it reduces the number of shots given reduces the administration and production costs and improves the patient compliance as well. Such combination vaccines are generally better accepted.<br>
However, the well documented phenomenon of the antigenic competition has complicated and hindered the development of the multivalent vaccines. This phenomenon refers to the observation that administering multiple antigens together often results in a diminished response to certain antigens relative to the immune response to these antigens when administered separately.<br>
The earlier research has been focused on the development of the vaccines with multiple valencies directed towards different diseases and infections. One such well know vaccine combination comprises diphtheria (D), tetanus (T) and whole cell pertussis (wP) antigens to give a DTwP vaccine.<br>
It is desirable to add other antigens to such a combination vaccine that would give protection against diseases caused by Hepatitis virus (Hep), Haemophilus influenzae (Hib) and polioviruses (IPV). It is also desirable to have antigens providing protection against other diseases added to the above said combination vaccines.<br>
Quintanrix produced by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals is a combination vaccine comprising DTwP, Hib and Hep B antigens, comprising thiomersal as a preservative. This vaccine was withdrawn before being marketed. Zilbrix ™ produced by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals contains DTwP and Hep B. Zilbrix Hib ™ produced by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals contains DTwP and Hep B and Hib, wherein the Hib is marketed in a separate vial, not containing the other antigenic components.<br>
PCT Application WO2002005846 by Green Cross Vaccine provides a quadrivalent combination vaccine including diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, whole cell pertussis and hepatitis b surface antigen. The said invention relate to a vaccine preparation that<br>
<br>
 <br>
combines Hep B with DTwP but is silent on the inclusion of other antigens such as Hib or IPV.<br>
PCT Application WO2008028957 by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals relates to a process of making a vaccine comprising low dose of IPV. However, it does not teach the preparation of a fully liquid vaccine comprising D, T, wP, IPV, Hib and Hep antigens, all together in a single vial, in fully liquid form, wherein the Hib is not substantially adsorbed on to any adjuvant.<br>
United States Patent No. 6013264 by SmithKline Beecham Biologicals relates to a multivalent vaccine comprising HBsAg. The said invention relates to a combination vaccine in which the HBsAg is adsorbed on to aluminium phosphate. However, there is no specific disclosure of a combination vaccine comprising DTwP-IPV along with other antigens as Hib and Hep, in a fully liquid form.<br>
PCT Application WO 1998000167A1 by Connaught Lab provides a multivalent immunogenic composition for conferring protection in a host against disease caused by infection by Bordetella pertussis, Clostridium tetani, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, poliovirus and/or Haemophilus influenzae. The Hib b component of the vaccine, according to the specification is a lyophilized component that has to be reconstituted before mixing with the other components of the vaccine. Thus, there is no teaching in the specification related to a fully liquid combination vaccine comprising all the said antigens.<br>
Lyophilization, also called as freeze drying, is a cost-intensive process that also causes a lot of stress to the proteins. When any component of the vaccine is lyophilized, at the time of administration of the vaccine, it is required to mix the lyophilizate with another liquid or the liquid component of the combination vaccine. This represents a supplementary constraint for the practitioner and presents a risk of it being carried out badly. It was then proposed to have a multi compartment syringe that would have the lyophilized component in one compartment and the liquid component of the vaccine in the other. However, such a syringe whose contents could be mixed at the time of<br>
 <br>
administration of the vaccine, does not perform satisfactorily at the level of reducing the production costs as well as at the level of the operations to be carried out by the practitioner.<br>
It is hence desirable to avoid this step of freeze drying and provide a combination vaccine that has all the components present together and in a fully liquid form. This would facilitate the administration of the vaccine, make it patient compliant and also reduce the production costs. It is thus desirable to have the Hib antigen added to the liquid component of the vaccine and thus have a fully liquid multivalent vaccine.<br>
PCT Application WO2004110480 by Glaxo SmithKline Biologicals relates to a vaccine comprising Hib b polysaccharide. The application states that simple mixing of the components of a combination vaccine is complicated by the fact that not all antigens can be effectively mixed together. It states that there is interference between the aluminium hydroxide of the DTP vaccine and PRP. The invention in WO'480 aims at minimizing this interference in such an extemporaneously-prepared combination vaccine wherein the PRP is pre-adsorbed onto aluminum phosphate. The invention further provides immunogenic compositions, vaccines and combination vaccines comprising PRP which is protected to some degree from immune interference. The inventors have found that the above can be achieved by incorporating a polyanionic polymer excipient with the vaccine comprising PRP.<br>
However, use of the polyanionic polymer in the vaccine formulation may not be desirable as it may increase the cost of formulating the vaccine. Also, since a vaccine is finally intended for human use, it should ideally have the least components possible. The use of additional ingredients means addition of substances to the formulation to which the body may react and produce antibodies. Such a response of the body coming in contact with such components of the immunological preparation may not be desirable.<br>
United States Patent No. 6333036 by Pasteur Merieux Serums, relates to vaccine compositions comprising capsular polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae type b or<br>
<br>
 <br>
high molecular weight polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) coupled to tetanus anatoxin, as well as an aluminium-based adjuvant. The aluminium based adjuvants used in the invention have a point of zero charge of less than approximately 7.2. The patent however, does not particularly teach the preparation of a combination vaccine comprising DTwP-IPV along with other antigens as Hib and Hep, in a fully liquid form.<br>
Though, the research is ongoing for making multivalent vaccine comprising various antigens that would afford protection against a number of diseases, they have not addressed the need for providing a stable combination vaccine comprising DTwP and IPV antigens along with other antigens such as Hib and Hep, in a fully liquid formulation. There are contrasting reports available regarding the antibody responses against particular antigens in children immunized by separate and co-administration of the combination vaccines and the Hib vaccine. There may be various reasons for such results including the vaccines being non-identical in their antigenic content, method of toxoiding, adjuvantation or the preservative used.<br>
The currently known and available combination vaccines may not contain appropriate formulations of appropriate antigens in appropriate immunogenic forms for achieving desired levels of efficacy and immunogenicity in the susceptible human population, for a number of diseases in one shot. There is a need for a multi component vaccine that provides protection against various infections and is in liquid form so as to afford ease of administration and comfort of cost-effectiveness. It would be desirable to provide for a stable and efficacious multivalent vaccine against diseases caused by the infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheria, Clostridium tetani, Bordetella pertussis, polioviruses, Hepatitis virus and Haemophilus influenzae. For such a vaccine to be effective, the criterion of seroprotection for each of the antigens of the vaccine needs to be fulfilled. For this there is a need to overcome the hurdles and the challenges posed by antigenic competition and interference. The present invention overcomes the limitations of prior arts and solves the related problems by providing a fully liquid combination vaccine formulation protecting against a plurality of diseases.<br>
<br>
 <br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a fully liquid stable combination vaccine comprising Diptheria (D), Tetanus (T), Whole cell pertussis (wP), and IPV and optionally one or more antigens selected from the group of Haemophilus influenzae (Hib) and Hepatitis (Hep), such that administration of the vaccine can simultaneously immunize a subject against more than one pathogen. The invention in particular relates to a fully liquid stable combination vaccine comprising the antigens as indicated above and the methods for manufacturing the same.<br>
The present invention is further directed towards a combination vaccine that comprises a plurality of the vaccine components that are suitable for the prevention, amelioration and treatment of multiple disease states that meet the criterion for the seroprotection for each of the said vaccine components.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed towards a fully liquid stable combination vaccine that comprises a plurality of the vaccine components that are suitable for the prevention, amelioration and treatment of multiple disease states that meet the criterion for the seroprotection for each of the said vaccine components.<br>
The advantages of the present invention include a multivalent vaccine which can confer protection against a wide range of diseases and infections in a safe and efficacious manner. The vaccine of the invention provides immunogenicity to various diseases and infections without any interference of any of the antigen that is present in the vaccine. Thus, a single shot would confer immunogenicity against various diseases and infections, making the vaccine more patients compliant. Since a single shot would afford immunity against a number of infections and diseases, the cost of vaccination would be reduced. The vaccine of the present invention would be beneficial in the sense that it will reduce the number of visits to the vaccination centre and also the number of shots to be given for a number of different diseases and infections. This aspect of the invention would make it more useful and advantageous especially with the younger population who need to be vaccinated to confer immunity to a large number of<br>
<br>
 <br>
infections and diseases. Thus, the present invention provides a vaccine that is more acceptable.<br>

<br>
 <br>
One other aspect of the invention relates to the composition of the combination vaccines of the invention such that each of the antigens is present in an amount in the vaccine so as to elicit protective immune response against the said antigen.<br>
Antigens of the vaccine of the invention<br>
Diphtheria is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a Gram-positive non-sporing aerobic bacterium. This organism expresses a prophage-encoded ADP-ribosylating exotoxin ('diphtheria toxin'), which can be treated (e.g. using formaldehyde) to give a toxoid. This toxoid is no longer toxic but still remains antigenic and is able to stimulate the production of specific anti-toxin antibodies after injection. The Diphtheria antigen preparation used in the vaccine of the invention preferably comprises Diphtheria toxoid.<br>
Tetanus is caused by Clostridium tetani, a Gram-positive, spore-forming bacillus. This organism expresses an endopeptidase ('tetanus toxin'), which can be treated to give a toxoid that is no longer toxic. However it still remains antigenic and is able to stimulate the production of specific anti-toxin antibodies after injection. The Tetanus antigen preparation used in the vaccine of the invention preferably comprises Tetanus toxoid.<br>
Pertussis or whooping cough is caused by Bordetella pertussis. The whole cell pertussis (wP) antigen of the invention may be prepared from the Bordetella pertussis strains that are likely to cause infections. The wP antigen of the invention may be inactivated by a number of ways such as use of chemical. However, inactivated B. pertussis (wP) used in the vaccine composition of the invention, preferably, is heat inactivated at 56 ±1°C, 30 minutes. The wP antigen preparation used in the vaccine of the invention is preferably made from Bordetella pertussis 134, 509 and 10536. The single Harvests of strains 10536, 509 and 134 are preferably mixed in the ratio of 1:1:1 ratio based upon their opacity.<br>
Haemophilus influenzae is a Gram-negative coccobacillus which causes invasive bloodborne infections and meningitis. According to one embodiment of the invention, the Hib antigen, which is derived from the capsular polysaccharide, may be conjugated or coupled to carrier proteins. The carrier proteins used for the conjugation of the Hib antigen may be selected from comprising of tetanus toxoid (TT), diphtheria toxoid<br>
<br>
 <br>
(DT), CRM 197 and outer membrane protein of Neisseria meningitides or any equivalents thereof. Other suitable carrier proteins include, but are not limited to, synthetic peptides, heat shock proteins, pertussis proteins, cytokines, lymphokines, hormones, growth factors, artificial proteins comprising multiple human CD4+ T cell epitopes from various pathogen-derived antigens such as N19, protein D from H.injluenzae, pneumococcal surface protein PspA, pneumolysin, iron-uptake proteins, toxin A or B from C.difficile and S.agalactiae proteins. The Hib antigen preparation used in the vaccine of the invention comprises Hib antigen preferably conjugated or coupled to tetanus toxoid.<br>
The polysaccharide conjugate may be prepared by any known coupling technique. For example the polysaccharide can be coupled via a thioether linkage. This conjugation method relies on activation of the polysaccharide with l-cyano-4-dimethylamino pyridinium tetrafluoroborate (CDAP) to form a cyanate ester. The activated polysaccharide may thus be coupled directly or via a spacer group to an amino group on the carrier protein. The conjugates can also be prepared by direct reductive animation methods. Another method involves the coupling of a cyanogen bromide (CNBr) activated polysaccharide derivatised with adipic acid hydrazide (ADH) to the protein carrier by carbodiimide condensation. Any other known method may be used to prepare the polysaccharide conjugate used in the vaccine of the invention.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the Hib antigen is not substantially adsorbed on to any adjuvant; preferably, degree of adsorption of the Hib antigen to an adjuvant is not more than 15%; more preferably, the degree of adsorption of the Hib antigen to an adjuvant is not more than 10%.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention relates to the Hib antigen not being subjected to deliberate or intentional adsorption on any adjuvant.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, the Hib antigen is derived from the capsular polysaccharide of the Hib b strain.<br>
Hepatitis is caused by various Hepatitis strains such as A, B, C, D, E, F or G. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the major agents which cause viral hepatitis. The HBV virion consists of an inner core surrounded by an outer protein coat or capsid. The major<br>
<br>
 <br>
component of the capsid is a protein known as HBV surface antigen or, more commonly, 'HBsAg'. When this antigen is administered to a vaccinee it stimulates the production of anti-HBsAg antibodies which protect against HBV infection. According to one preferred aspect of the invention, the Hepatitis (Hep) antigen preparation used in the vaccine of the invention comprises Hep antigens derived from the surface antigen of Hepatitis B strain (HBsAg).<br>
For vaccine manufacture, HBsAg can be made either by purifying the antigen in particulate form from the plasma of chronic hepatitis B carriers, as large quantities of HBsAg are synthesized in the liver and released into the blood stream during an HBV infection or by expressing the protein by recombinant DNA methods. HBsAg for use in the vaccine of the invention may be prepared in either way.<br>
Poliomyelitis is caused by the polio viruses. The vaccine of the invention may comprise Sabin (Sabin 1 and/ or Sabin 2) or Salk strains of Poliovirus. According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, the vaccine of the invention comprises Salk strains. There are 3 types of Salk strains that can cause poliomyelitis. The three types are similar and cause identical symptoms, but they are antigenically very different and infection by one type does not protect against infection by others. Salk Poliovirus includes 3 strains- Type 1 (e.g. Mahoney strain), poliovirus Type 2 (e.g. MEF-I strain), and poliovirus Type 3 (e.g. Saukett strain). According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the vaccine of the invention may comprise one or more of the said Salk strains.<br>
Polioviruses may be grown in cell culture. Vero cell line, which is a continuous cell line derived from monkey kidney, may be used to grow the polioviruses. After growth, virions may be purified using already known techniques. The inactivation of the viruses may be done. Quantities of poliovirus are typically expressed in the 'DU' unit (the "D-antigen unit"). The IPV antigen preparation used in the manufacturing of the vaccine of the invention is preferably prepared so as to comprise one or more strains that are used in the manufacturing of the vaccine. This bulk preparation is then used to formulate the vaccine of the invention.<br>
Non-antigenic components of the vaccine<br>
<br>
 <br>
Along with the antigenic components the vaccine may comprise a number of non-antigenic components that are pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. These include but are not restricted to pH modifiers, buffers, adjuvants, preservative, carrier and tonicity modifying agents.<br>
Adjuvants<br>
The antigens of the final formulation may or may not be adsorbed on to an adjuvant. An adjuvant functions to stimulate the production of immunity against the vaccine ingredients, making the vaccine more effective.<br>
Adjuvants may serve to:<br>
•	Bring the antigen in contact with the immune system and influence the type of immunity produced, as well as the quality of the immune response (magnitude or duration);<br>
•	Decrease the toxicity of certain antigens; and<br>
•	Provide solubility to some vaccines components.<br>
Studies have shown that many aluminum-containing vaccines cause higher and more prolonged antibody responses than comparable vaccines without the adjuvant. The benefit of adjuvants has usually been observed during the initial immunization series rather than with booster doses.<br>
Aluminum based adjuvants are the most commonly used adjuvants. These adjuvants have also been approved by FDA for use in vaccines. There are three general types of aluminum-containing adjuvants:<br>
•	Aluminum hydroxide<br>
•	Aluminum phosphate<br>
•	Potassium aluminum sulfate (often called "Alum")<br>
<br>
 <br>
One embodiment of the invention relates to certain antigens of the vaccine being adsorbed on to aluminum phosphate and certain antigens of the vaccine being adsorbed on to aluminum hydroxide. Certain antigens of the invention may not be adsorbed or substantially adsorbed on to any adjuvant. The preference of the adjuvant for the adsorption of the said antigens gives the vaccine of the invention its characteristics. The preference of adsorption is described in more details in the section on 'Process for manufacturing of the vaccine of the invention', below.<br>
Preservatives<br>
The vaccines are prone to contamination by bacteria. Thus, to avoid the potentially life threatening contamination with harmful microbes, that may be introduced in a vaccine incorporated during the event of accidental contamination, a preservative may be included in the composition of the vaccine while formulating it. The preservatives that have been used include Benzethonium chloride (Phemerol), thiomersal, Phenol and 2-phenoxyethanol (2-POE).<br>
Thimerosal is a mercury-containing organic compound (an organomercurial) that has been used in many vaccines as a preservative. There are reports pertaining to certain allergic reactions to thiomersal primarily in the form of delayed-type local hypersensitivity reactions, including redness and swelling at the injection site. There are also conflicting reports on linking autism to mercury.<br>
2-phenoxyethanol (2-POE) is also known as i-hydroxy-2-phenoxyethane', '2-hydroxyethyl phenyl ether', 'ethyleneglycol phenyl ether', etc. The safety profile of 2-phenoxyethanol is better than that of mercurial preservatives (e.g. thiomersal). Thus, there is a need of avoiding thiomersal and using 2- phenoxyethanol in the vaccines.<br>
Thus, another preferred embodiment of the invention relates to the use of 2-phenoxyethanol as a preservative in the vaccine composition. According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, the concentration of 2-phenoxyethanol is 5mg/ml of the vaccine.<br>
Tonicity modifying agents<br>
<br>
 <br>
To control to the tonicity of the vaccine composition, it is preferred to include a tonicity modifying agent in the formulation of the vaccine. These agents include but are not limited to salts (examples- NaCl, MgC12, KC1, CaC12), sugars (examples- dextrose, mannitol, lactose), amino acids (examples- Arginine, Glycine, Histidine) and Polyols (examples- Sucrose, Glycerol, Sorbitol). In a more preferred embodiment, a physiological salt such as sodium salt is used in the formulation of the vaccine. Sodium chloride (NaCl) is most preferably included in the vaccine composition of the invention.<br>
pH Modifiers and/or Buffers<br>
Various pH modifiers known to person skilled in the art may be used to adjust the pH of the vaccine composition as desired, such as sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. Various buffers such as sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate and citrate buffers may be used in the formulation of the vaccine.<br>
