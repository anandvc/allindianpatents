CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/620,060 filed October 19, 2004 and OB 0519957.5 field 30 September 2005, which is<br>

TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates generally to CRF receptor antagonists, and to<br>
methods of treating disorders by administration of such antagonists to a warm-blooded<br>
mammal in need thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND Or THE INVENTION<br>
The firsl conicatropin-releasing factor (CRF) was isolated from ovine<br>
hypothalami and identified as a 41-amino acid peptide (Vale et al., Science 273:1394-<br>
1397, 1981). Subsequently, sequences of human and rat CRF were isolated and<br>
determined lo be identical but different from ovine CRF in 7 of the 41 amino acid residues<br>
(Riwier ei al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA S0:4S5t, 1983; Shibahara et al.. EMBO J. 2:775,<br>
1983).<br>
CRF has been found to produce profound alterations in endocrine, nervous<br>
and immanc system function. CRF is believed to be the major physiological regulator of<br>
the basal and stress-release of adrenocorticotropic hormone ("ACTH"), 6-endorphin, and<br>
other pro-apiomelanocortin ("POMC")-derived peptides from the anterior pituitary (Vale<br>
et al., Sconce 2/^:1394-1397, 1981). Briefly, CRF is believed to initiate its biological<br>
effects by binding to a plasma membrane receptor svhich has been found to be distributed<br>
throughout the brain (DeSouza et al., Science 224:1449-1451, 1984), pituitary (DeSouza el<br>
al., Methods Eniymol. J24:56Q, 1986; Wynn et al., Biochem. Biaphys. Res. Coinm.<br>
7/0:602-608, 1983), adrenals (Udelsman et al., Nature 5/9:147-150. 1986) and spleen<br>
(Webster, E.L., and EB. DeSouza, Endocrinology 122:609-611, 1988). The CRF receptor<br>
is coupled to a GTP-binding protein (Perrin et al., Endocrinology 11&amp; I 171-1179, 1986)<br>
which mediates CRF-sbmu!a!ed increase in intracelluiar production of cAMP (Bileicikjian,<br>
L.M , and \V.\V. Vale, Endocrinology 113'651-662, 1983). The receptor for CRF has now<br>
been cloned from rat (Perrin et al., Endo ^3(6):3058-3061, 1993), and human brain (Chen<br>
et al., PNAS 90(19):8967-8971, 1993; Vita et al., FEBS 335(1): 1-5, 1993). This receptor<br>
is a 415 amino acid protein comprising seven membrane spanning domains. A<br>
comparison of identity between rat and human sequences shows a high degree of<br>
homology (97%) at the amino acid level.<br>
In addition to its role in stimulating the production of ACTH and POMC,<br>
CRF is also believed to coordinate many of the endocrine, autonomic, and behavioral<br>
responses to stress, and may be involved in the pathophysiology of affective disorders.<br>
Moreover. CRF is believed to be a key intermediary in communication between the<br>
immune, central nervous, endocrine and cardiovascular systems (Crofford ei al., J. Clin.<br>
Invest 90:2555 2564, 1992; Sapolsky et al.. Science 238:522-524, 1987; Tilders et al.,<br>
Regui Pcptides 5:77-84, 1982). Overall, CRF appears lo be one of the pivotal central<br>
nervous system neurotransmitters and plays a crucial role in integrating the body's overall<br>
response to stress.<br>
Administration of CRF directly to the brain elicits behavioral,<br>
physiological, and endocrine responses identical to those observed for a mammal exposed<br>
(o a stressful environment. For example, intracerebroventricular injection of CRF results<br>
in behavioral activation (Sutton et al., Nature 297:331, 1982), persistent activation of the<br>
electroencephalogram (Ehlers et al., Brain Res. 278:332, 1983), stimulation of the<br>
sympathoadrenomedullary pathway (Brown et al., Endocrinology 770:928, 1982), an<br>
increase of heart rate and blood pressure (Fisher et al., Endocrinology 110:2222, 1982), an<br>
increase in oxygen consumption (Brown et al.. Life Sciences 30:207, 1982), alteration of<br>
gastrointestinal activity (Williams el al., Am. J. Physiol. 253:0582, 1987), suppression of<br>
food consumption (Levine et al., Neuropbannacology 22:337, 1983), modification of<br>
sexual behavior (Sirinathsinghji et al., Nature 305:232, 1983), and immune function<br>
compromise (Irwin et al., Am. J. Physioi. 255:R744, 1988). Furthermore, clinical data<br>
suggests that CRF may be hypersecreted in the brain in depression, anxiety-related<br>
disorders, and anorexia nervosa. (DeSouza, Ann. Reports in Med. Chem. 25:215-223,<br>
1990). Accordingly, clinical data suggests (hat CRF receptor antagonists may represent<br>
novel antidepressant and/or anxiolytic drugs that may be useful in the treatment of the<br>
neuropsychiatric disorders manifesting hypersecreiion of CRF.<br>
The first CRF receptor antagonists were peptides (see, e.g., Rwier et al.,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,605,642; Rivier et ai.. Science 224:889, 1984). While (hese peptides<br>
established that CRF receptor antagonists can attenuate the pharmacological responses to<br>
CRF, peptide CRF receptor antagonists suffer from the usual drawbacks of peptide<br>
therapeutics including lack of stability and limited oral activity.<br>
CRF antagonists comprising compounds having a pyrazolo-[l,5a]-<br>
pyrimidine core are disclosed in the following patents and published applications:<br>
WO97291.09, US6313124, W09803510, WO9938868. WO9808847, JP2000038350,<br>
EPI097709 and US6664261, Further, this core is disclosed in application WO9535298<br>
for analgesics, in application JP1010I672 for adenosine reinforcement agents, in<br>
application JP10101671 for nitrogen monooxide symhase inhibitors, in application<br>
W02001023387 for neuropeptide Yl antagonists, in application W02000044754 for fat<br>
accumulation inhibitors, and in application W02003101993 for hepatitis C virus<br>
replication inhibitors.<br>
Due to the physiological significance of CRF, the development of<br>
biologically-active small molecules having significant CRF receptor binding activity and<br>
which are capable of antagonizing the CRF receptor remains a desirable goal Such CRF<br>
receptor antagonists may be useful in the treatment of endocnne, psychiatric and<br>
neurological conditions or illnesses, including stress-related disorders in general.<br>
While significant strides have been made toward achieving CRF regulation<br>
through administration of CRF receptor antagonists, there remains a need in the art for<br>
effective small molecule CRF receptor antagonists. There is also a need for<br>
pharmaceutical compositions containing such CRF receptor antagonists, as well as<br>
methods relaung to the use thereof to treat, for example, stress-related disorders. The<br>
present invention fulfills these needs, and provides other related advantages.<br>

The effectiveness of a compound as a CRF receptor antagonist may be<br>
determined by various assay methods. CRF antagonists of this invention may be capable<br>
of inhibiting the specific binding of CRF 10 its receptor and ant-agonizing activities<br>
associated with CRF. A compound of structure (I) may be assessed for activjiy as a CRF<br>
antagonist by one or more generally accepted assays for this purpose, including (but not<br>
limited to) the assays disclosed by DcSouza et al. (J. Neuroscience 7:88, 1987) and<br>
Battaglia et al (Synapse 1:512, 1987), As mentioned above, CRF antagonists of this<br>
invention include compounds which demonstrate CRF receptor affinity. CRF receptor<br>
affinity may be determined by binding studies that measure the a b i l i ty of a compound to<br>
inhibit the binding of a radiolabeled CRF (e.g., [l25I}tyrosirte-CFR) to its receptor (e.g.,<br>
receptors prepared from rat cerebral cortex membranes). The radioligand binding assay<br>
described by DeSouza et ah (supra, 1987) provides an assay for determining a compound's<br>
affinity for the CRF receptor. Such activity is typically calculated from the ICso as the<br>
concentration of a compound necessary to displace 50% of the radiolabeled ligand from<br>
the receptor, and is reported as a "Kf value calculated by the following equation:<br>
where L - radioligand and KD = affinity of radioligand for receptor (Cheng and Prusoff.<br>
Biochem. Ptiamacol. 22:3099, 1973).<br>
In addition to inhibiting CRF receptor binding, a compound's CRF receptor<br>
antagonist activity may be established by the ability of the compound to antagonize an<br>
activity associated with CRF. For example, CRF is known to stimulate various<br>
biochemical processes, including adenylate cyclase activity. Therefore, compounds may<br>
be evaluated as CRF antagonists by their ability to antagonize CRF-stimulated adenylate<br>
cycla&amp;e activity by, for example, measuring cAMP levels. The CRF-stimulated adenylate<br>
cyclase activity assay described by Battaglia etal. (supra, 1987) provides an assay for<br>
determining a compound's ability to antagonize CRF activity. Accordingly, CRF receptor<br>
antagonist activity may be determined by assay techniques which generally include an<br>
initial binding assay (such as disclosed by DeSouza (supra, 1987)) followed by a cAMP<br>
screening protocol (such as disclosed by Battaglia (supra, 1987)).<br>
With reference to CRF receptor binding affinities, CRF receptor<br>
antagonists of this invention may have a K, of less than 10 pM. In one embodiment of this<br>
invention, a CRF receptor antagonist has a EQ of less than luM, and in a another<br>
embodiment the K, is less than 0.25 pM (i.e., 250 nM). As set forth in greater detail<br>
below, the Kj values may be assayed by the methods set forth in Example 25. CRF<br>
receptor antagonists of the present invention having a K; of less than 0.10 ^M (i.e., 100<br>
nM) include Examples 11-1, 11-2, 11-3, 11-4, 11-5, 11-6. 11-9, 11-10, 11-11, 11-13, 11-<br>

2, 13-3, 13-4, 13-5, 13-6, 13-7, 13-8, 13-9, 14-1, 14-2, 14-3, 14-4, 15-1, 17-1, 17-2, 17-3,<br>

CRF receptor antagonists of ihe present invention may demonstrate activity<br>
at the CRF receptor site, and may be used as therapeutic agents for the treatment of a wide<br>
range of disorders or illnesses including endocrine, psychiatric, and "neurological disorders<br>
or illnesses. More specifically, CRF receptor antagonists of the present invention may be<br>
useful in treating physiological conditions or disorders arising from the hypersecretion of<br>
CRF. Because CRF is believed to be an important neurotransmitter that activates and<br>
coordinates the endocrine, behavioral and automatic responses to stress, CRF receptor<br>
antagonists of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of neuropsychiatric<br>
disorders. Neuropsychiatric disorders which may be treatable by the CRF receptor<br>
antagonists of this invention include affective disorders such as depression; anxiety-related<br>
disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive<br>
disorder, abnormal aggression, cardiovascular abnormalities such as unstable angina and<br>
reactive hypertension; and feeding disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and<br>
irritable bowel syndrome. CRF antagonists may also be useful in treating stress-induced<br>
immune suppression associated with various diseases states, as well as stroke. Other uses<br>
of the CRF antagonists of this invention include treatment of inflammatory conditions<br>
(such as rheumatoid arthritis, uveitis. asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and G.I.<br>
motility), pain, Cushing's disease, infantile spasms, epilepsy and other seizures in both<br>
infants and adults, and various substance abuse and withdrawal (including alcoholism).<br>

Step I A:<br>
To a mixture of 2-amino-4-pico!ine (33 g), NaBHjCN (57 g), formaldehyde<br>
(37% aq. solution, 240 mL) in acetomirile (1 L) and water (200 mL) was added drop-wise<br>
acetic acid (60 mL) at 0 °C in 2 hr. The resultant solution was stirred at RT for 7 days and<br>
then concentrated in vacua. The residue was basified with solid NaOH to pH 10 and<br>
extracted with hexanes (3x 700 mL). The combined extract was washed with IN aq.<br>
NaOH and brine, dried over Na?SO4 and evaporated in vacua to give 2-dimethylamino-4-<br>
methylpyridine as a colorle$s oil (Cmpd la, 36 g, 88%). 'H NMR (CDClj): 2.26 (s, 3H),<br>
3.07 (s, 6H), 6.33 (s, 1H), 6.40 (d, 1H). 8.02 (d, 1H); MS (CI) m/e 137 (MH*).<br>
Step IB:<br>
A mixture of Cmpd la (32 g), NaiC05 (30 g) in DCM (50 mL) and water<br>
(400 mL) was treated dropwise with a solution of bromine (13 mL) in DCM (50 mL) at<br>
0 °C in 0.5 hr. The resultant light brown suspension was stirred at 0 °C for 0.5 hr. The<br>
resultant was extracted with hexanes (2x 600 mL,) and the combined extract was washed<br>
with brine, dried over NajSC and evaporation in vacua. The crude resultant was purified<br>
by chromatography on silica gel with 1:5 ethyl acetate/hexanes to give 5-bromo-2-<br>
dimethylamino-4-methylpyridine as a tan solid (Cmpd Ib, 78% yield). 'H NMR (CDCb):<br>
2.30 (s, 3H), 3.04 (s, 6H), 6.38 (s, 1H), 8.14 (s, 1H); MS (CI) m/e 216 (MTf).<br>
Into a suspension of magnesium (11.3 g) in THF (20 mL) was added a<br>
quarter portion of a solution of Cmpd Ib (48.5 g) from Step IB in THF (100 mL). The<br>
reaction was initiated with 5 drops of 1,2-dibromoethane with slightly heating. After<br>
initiation of the reaction 10 mL of THF was added. The rest of the solution of Crnpd Ib<br>
was added dropwise to maintain a gentle reflux. After completion of addition the mixture<br>
was stirred at RT for 0.5 hr before DMF (1.5 eq.) was slowly injected at 0 °C. The<br>
resultant mixture was stirred at RT overnight and quenched with saturated aq. NRjCI. The<br>
resultant was extracted with ether (2 x 500 mL) and the combined extract was washed with<br>
brine, dried over 3vlgSO4, filtered and concentrated in vacua. The resultant was purified<br>
by chromatography on silica gel with 1:5 ethyl acetate/hexanes to afford 2-dimethylarnino-<br>
4-methy]-5-formylpyridine as a tan solid (Cmpd lc, 77% yield). The analytic sample was<br>
obtained by crystallization from eiher/hexanes. 'H NMR (CDC13): 2.57 (s, 3H). 3.11 (s,<br>

Step ID:<br>
Into a suspension of tBuOK (J 2.5 g) in DME (70 mL) at -50 °C was added<br>
dropwise a solution of TosMIC (15.6 g) in DME (70 mL). The brown solution was stirred<br>
at -50 °C for ]0 mm before a solution of Cmpd It (11 g) in DME (70 mL) was added<br>
dropwise. The resultant mixture was stirred at -50 "C for 0.5 hr and quenched with<br>
methanol (70 mL). This mixture was heated to reflux for 1 hr and the solvent was<br>
evaporated and partitioned in ethyl acetate-water. The organic layer was washed with<br>
bnne, dried over MgSO4 and filtered through a silica gel pad with ethyl acetate. This<br>
work-up gave 2-dimethylarn.ino-4-rnethyl-5-(cyanomethyl)pyridine as a yellow solid<br>
(Cmpd Id, 9.5 g, 80%) 'H NMR (CDClj): 2.3l(s, 3H), 3.08 (s, 6H), 3.54 (s, 2H), 6.36 (s,<br>

Step IE:<br>
Into a suspension of Cmpd Id (40 g, 0.23 mol) and NaH (2.5 eq.) in THF<br>
(100 mL) was added about 5 mL of ethyl acetate. The mixture was stirred at RT until an<br>
exothermic reaction started and hydrogen evolved vigorously. Ethyl acetate (50 mL) was<br>
then added dropwise to maintain a gentle reflux. The mixture was stirred at RT for 2 hr<br>
before it was quenched with water (100 mL). The organic phase was separated and the<br>
aqueous phase was washed several times with ethyl ether. The aqueous phase was then<br>
acidified with acetic acid, and the resultant was extracted with ethyl acetate (5 x 800 mL).<br>
The combined extract was washed with brine (50 mL) and dried over MgSCU.<br>
Concentration in vacua gave the keto form l-cyano-l-(6-dimethylamino-4-methylpyridin-<br>
3-yl)acetone and the 3-hydroxy-but-2-enenitrile enol form (Cmpd le) as a brown solid (40<br>

and the residue was diluted with water (50 mL). The aqueous phase was basified with<br>
solid NaiCOj and the resultant was extracted with ethyl acetate. The extract was dned<br>
over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to give 3-amino-4-(6-dimethylamino-4-<br>
methylpyndin-3 yl)-5-methylpyrazole as a brownish oil (Cmpd If, 30g, 93% yield,) which<br>
was crystallized from ether-hexanes. 'H NMR (CDCb): 2.07 (s, 3H), 2.14 (s, 3H), 3.10 (s,<br>

nitrogen. About 2 mL of ethyl acetate was added and the mixture was heated gradually to<br>
an internal temperature of 66 C. After about 10 minutes a vigorous reaction ensued, and<br>
healing was discontinued while additional ethyl acetate (75 mL) was added dropwise over<br>
about 20 minutes to maintain reflux. Vigorous hydrogen evolution was observed. By the<br>
end of the ethyl acetate addition, ihe reaction mixture began to cool, and the mixture was<br>
stirred and allowed to cool over 3 hr. 150 mL water was added followed by 300 mL ether.<br>

The combined organic layers were washed with brine (100 mL), dried over magnesium<br>
sulfate, filtered and evaporated to give crude Cmpd 4b as a pale orange oil (45 g) which<br>
was carried forward without further purification.<br>
Alternate Step 48:<br>
Compound 4a (183.8 g, 0.9 mol) was dissolved in EtOH (1.09L) and water (109 mL) and<br>
hydrazine hydrobromide (112.39 g, 0.99 mol) was added. The mixture was refluxed (90<br>
"C bath temperature) for 2.5 h, at which time LC/MS monitoring showed complete<br>
reaction. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool and concentrated in vacua to remove<br>
EtOH and partitioned between NaHCOj (950 mL, sat. aq.) and EtOAc (400 mL). The<br>
aqueous layer was separated and extracted further with EtOAc (3 x 400 mL) and the<br>
combined organic layers were washed with brine (400 mL), dried (MgSOd) and<br>
concentrated in vacua to give the crude aminopyrazole 4b as an amber colored oil (168.8.<br>
80 % pure), which was carried on without further purification.<br>
Step 4C:<br>
Ethyl acetoacetaie (EAA) (28.4 mL) was added to a solution of 4b (40.2 g,<br>
0.18 mol) in dry dioxane (180 mL). The mixture was refluxed at 115 °C for about 20 h,<br>
during which time pyrazolopyrimtdine 4c precipitated from solution as a white solid. The<br>
reaction mixture was cooled and the precipitate was filtered and washed with cold ether.<br>
The precipitate was then dried in vacua to yield 22.5 g (0.079 mol, 42.7%) of Cmpd 4c as<br>
an off-white solid.<br>
Alternative Step 4C:<br>
Ethyl acetoacetate (EAA) (200 mL) was added to a solution of the crude 4b<br>

mixture was heated to reflux for 2 h, during which time pyrazolopyrimidme 4c<br>
precipitated from solution as a while solid. The reaction mixture was cooled and the<br>
precipitate was filtered and washed with cold ether. The precipitate was then dried in<br>
vacua to yield 131 g (0.46 mol, 75%) of Cmpd 4c as an off-white solid.<br>

Phosphorous oxychloride (12 mL) was added to a suspension of 4c (12.1 g)<br>
in anhydrous acetonitrile (60 mL) at RT. The mixture was heated at 80 C for 30 h, at<br>
which point the reaction mixture was a clear, deep-red solution. The reaction mixture was<br>
poured onto 300 mL of ice/water, and the reaction flask was rinsed with 100 mL ethyl<br>
acetate. The mixture was then stirred and neutralized with sat. aq. sodium carbonate. The<br>
red mixture became yellow upon neutralization. The layers were separated and the<br>
aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (4x 100 mL). The combined organic layers<br>
were washed with brine (100 mL). dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and<br>
concentrated to give a clear brown oil. The crude product was chromatographed on silica<br>
gel using 2:1 hexanes/ethyl acetate, giving Cmpd 4d (12.1 g , 94%) as a clear yellow oil,<br>
which solidifed upon standing.<br>
Alternate Step 4D:<br>
To a suspension of pyrazolopyrirnidine 4c (235.1 g, 0.83 mol) in anhydrous<br>
acetomtnle (1.2 L) was added phosphorous oxychloride (232 mL, 2.49 mol) at rt. The<br>
mixture was heated to 80 °C and stirred for 20 h and allowed to cool and concentrated in<br>
vacua to approximately 1/4 the volume. Ice chips and water were carefully added with<br>
stirring to make the total volume up to 1 L. Ensuring the temperature was always below 5<br>
°C using an ice bath and adding more ice chips to the mixture, the pH was brought to<br>
around 6-7 using NaOH (2 M, aq.). The resulting cold suspension was extracted with<br>
EtOAc (3 x 500 mL) and the combined organic layers dried (MgS04) and concentrated in<br>
vacua to give chloropyrimidine 4d as a red waxy crystalline solid (258.3 g, 93 % purity),<br>
which was used directly for the next step.<br>

It will be recognised that spectra and diffraction data will vary slightly<br>
according to various factors such as the temperature, concentration and instrumentation<br>
used. The skilled person will recognise that XRPD peak positions are affected by<br>
differences in sample height. The peak positions quoted herein are thus subject to a<br>
variation of +/- 0.15 degrees 2-theta.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, the polymorph Form 1 exhibits a predominant<br>
endotherm peak at about 108.3 °C. It should be recognized that that the endotherm peak<br>
as measured is dependent under a number of factors including the machine employed, the<br>
rate of heating, the calibration standard, humidity and the purity of the sample used.<br>
Accordingly, the term "about 108.3 °C" is intended to encompass such instrument<br>
variations,<br>

Pharmacol vol
may be used to evaluate the binding activity of the compounds of the present invention<br>
with any CRF receptor subtype.<br>
Briefly, the binding assay involves the displacement of a radiolabeled CRP<br>
ligand from the CRF receptor. More specifically, the binding assay is performed in 96-<br>
well assay plates using 1-lOu.g cell membranes from cells stably transfected with human<br>
CRP receptors Each well receives about 0.05 mL assay buffer (e.g., Dulbccco's<br>
phosphate buffered saline, 10 mM magnesium chloride, 2 mM EGTA) containing<br>
compound of interest. Or a reference ligand (for example, sauvagine, urocortin I or CRF),<br>
0.05 mL of [USI] lyrosine - sauvagine (final concentration -150 pM or approximately the<br>
KD as determined by Scatehard analysis) and 0.1 mL of a cell membrane suspension<br>
containing the CRF receptor. The mixture is incubated for 2 hours at 22 °C followed by<br>
separation of the bound and free radioligand by rapid filtration over glass fiber filters.<br>
Following three washes, the filters are dried and radioactivity (Auger electrons from I251)<br>
is counted using a scintillation counter. All radioligand binding data may be analyzed<br>
using the non-linear least-squares curve-fitting programs Prism (GraphPad Software Inc)<br>
or XL/If (ID Business Solutions Ltd).<br>
