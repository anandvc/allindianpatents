				<td>METHOD FOR PURIFYING (METH)ACRYLIC ACID OBTAINED BY<br>
OXIDIZING A GAS SUBSTRATE<br>
The present invention fits into the context of<br>
a method for manufacturing (meth)acrylic acid according<br>
to which a gas substrate (propane and/or propylene<br>
and/or acrolein in the case of acrylic acid; isobutane<br>
and/or isobutene and/or tert-butyl alcohol and/or<br>
methacrolein in the case of methacrylic acid) is<br>
oxidized by a catalytic or redox method, and the<br>
(meth)acrylic acid is recovered from the hot reaction<br>
gas mixture, by countercurrent absorption by a solvent.<br>
The (meth)acrylic acid absorption methods<br>
described use, as an absorption solvent, either water,<br>
or an organic solvent, which is usually a hydrophobic<br>
compound or a mixture of hydrophobic compounds with a<br>
much higher boiling point than that of (meth)acrylic<br>
acid.<br>
Absorption methods using water provide an<br>
aqueous (meth)acrylic acid solution which requires<br>
numerous and costly purification steps to obtain pure<br>
(meth)acrylic acid.<br>
On the contrary, absorption methods using<br>
hydrophobic organic solvents have the advantage over<br>
aqueous methods of reducing the number of purification<br>
steps necessary for obtaining pure (meth)acrylic acid.<br>
These methods conventionally involve the successive<br>
steps of absorption, stripping, removal of light<br>
compounds, followed by final distillation of the pure<br>
acrylic acid.<br>
The present invention relates to the<br>
substantially quantitative recovery (recovery yield &gt;<br>
98.5%.), in only three steps of (meth)acrylic acid that<br>
is sufficiently stripped of its light impurities to<br>
avoid an additional topping step. A second objective<br>
of the invention is to achieve this recovery without<br>
dilution of the uncondensed waste gas by an external<br>
gas added in the stripping step, in order to reduce the<br>
size of the column and the loss of unconsumed reactants<br>
in the waste gas that must be purged. The third<br>
objective is the recovery of pure (meth) acrylic acid<br>
without any aqueous pollutant liquid release that is<br>
difficult to remove.<br>
The main method for synthesizing acrylic acid<br>
uses a reaction of catalytic oxidation of propylene<br>
with a mixture containing oxygen. This reaction is<br>
generally carried out in the vapor phase, usually in<br>
two steps, which may be carried out in two distinct<br>
reactors or a single reactor:<br>
the first step carries out the substantially<br>
quantitative oxidation of the propylene to an<br>
acrolein rich mixture, in which the acrylic acid<br>
is a minority component;<br>
the second step completes the conversion of<br>
acrolein to acrylic acid.<br>
The gas mixture issuing from the second oxidation<br>
step consists of:<br>
acrylic acid;<br>
light compounds incondensable in the temperature<br>
and pressure conditions commonly employed<br>
(unconverted nitrogen, oxygen and propylene,<br>
propane present in the reactive propylene, carbon<br>
monoxide and dioxide formed in small quantities by<br>
final oxidation);<br>
light condensable compounds, particularly water,<br>
generated by the propylene oxidation reaction,<br>
unconverted acrolein, light aldehydes, such as<br>
formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, and acetic acid,<br>
the main impurity generated in the reaction<br>
section;<br>
heavy compounds: furfuraldehyde, benzaldehyde,<br>
maleic anhydride, etc.<br>
The method for synthesizing (meth)acrylic acid by<br>
oxidation is identical in principle to that of acrylic<br>
acid, except for the reactive substrate (which may be<br>
isobutene or tert-butanol), the intermediate oxidation<br>
product (methacrolein) and the types of light<br>
condensable byproduct compounds (the reaction gas<br>
mixture contains acrylic acid in addition to the light<br>
compounds present in the reaction gas of the acrylic<br>
acid synthesis method).<br>
The second stage of manufacture consists in<br>
recovering the acrylic acid from the hot gas mixture,<br>
previously cooled to a temperature of 150-200°C, by<br>
introducing this gas at the bottom of an absorption<br>
column where it meets a countercurrent flow of solvent<br>
introduced at the top of the column, and inside which<br>
cooling, condensation, absorption and rectification<br>
processes take place simultaneously.<br>
In most of the methods described, the solvent<br>
employed in this column is water or a high boiling<br>
point hydrophobic solvent.<br>
Regardless of the solvent used, the known<br>
methods generally involve:<br>
an absorption column, supplied at the top with<br>
solvent, at the bottom of which the reaction gas<br>
mixture is introduced, comprising a lower cooling<br>
section and in which the gas upflow undergoes partial<br>
condensation by meeting a descending liquid mixture<br>
stream generally cooled through a heat exchanger, and<br>
an upper section designed to absorb the maximum of<br>
acrylic acid in the solvent;<br>
a desorption column, supplied with the bottom<br>
stream from the absorption column. The role of this<br>
column is selectively to remove most of the light<br>
compounds absorbed in the preceding step, particularly<br>
the acrolein unconverted in the reaction step.<br>
The lighter uncondensed compounds issuing from<br>
the reaction gas are removed at the top of the<br>
absorption column.<br>
In order to recover part of the unconverted<br>
reactants present in this stream, such as propylene and<br>
acrolein, in the case of the method for synthesizing<br>
acrylic acid, or isobutene and methacrolein in the case<br>
of a method for manufacturing methacrylic acid, part of<br>
the uncondensed gas stream at the top of the absorption<br>
column is generally recycled to the reaction step, the<br>
remainder being purged to prevent the holdup of<br>
byproducts in the gas loop thus formed.<br>
The maximum proportion of uncondensed gas<br>
recycled to the reaction is also limited by economic<br>
criteria: since the quantity of gas fed to the reactors<br>
is limited by catalyst performance, the (meth)acrylic<br>
acid productivity is decreased by dilution of the<br>
reactive substrate.<br>
Since (meth)acrylic acid is sensitive to<br>
polymerization promoted by high temperatures, the<br>
operating temperature in the desorption column is<br>
generally limited, either by carrying out this<br>
distillation at the temperature of the mixture under<br>
reduced pressure, or by introducing an inert gas at the<br>
bottom of a stripping column operating under<br>
atmospheric pressure or reduced pressure, the two<br>
methods serving to decrease the vapor pressure of the<br>
condensable compounds, and consequently the temperature<br>
of the liquid-gas equilibria governing the separation.<br>
In the case of absorption methods using water<br>
as an absorbent solvent, the raw (meth) acrylic acid<br>
mixture recovered at the bottom of the desorption<br>
column contains a high proportion of water, about 30-<br>
50% by weight. Certain polar compounds, which display<br>
a strong affinity for this solvent, such as carboxylic<br>
acids, are absorbed in the water. This is particularly<br>
the case of acetic acid (case of the synthesis of<br>
acrylic acid) , or of acetic acid and acrylic acid (the<br>
case of methacrylic acid synthesis) formed by a side<br>
reaction during the reaction step, which passes<br>
completely into this raw (meth)acrylic acid stream.<br>
The separation of the majority impurities, that<br>
is, water and acetic acid (case of the synthesis of<br>
acrylic acid) or water, acetic acid and acrylic acid<br>
(case of the synthesis of methacrylic acid) , in order<br>
to obtain pure acrylic acid or pure methacrylic acid<br>
respectively, is difficult. It requires a large number<br>
of separation columns. The dehydration step is<br>
generally carried out in the presence of a solvent<br>
immiscible with water, in an extraction column or<br>
heteroazeotropic distillation column, generally coupled<br>
with a column for recovery of the solvent partially<br>
solubilized in the extracted aqueous phase, in order to<br>
recycle it upstream of the method. The step of removal<br>
of the light compounds (topping) usually employs one or<br>
two columns, and the step of separation of the heavy<br>
compounds (tailing) is carried out in a final column,<br>
from which the pure (meth) acrylic acid is extracted at<br>
the top.<br>
Absorption methods using a nonaqueous solvent<br>
have the advantage of reducing the purification steps,<br>
particularly by avoiding the use of heavy and costly<br>
water separation methods, the use of hydrophobic<br>
solvents making it possible to remove the water at the<br>
top of the absorption column.<br>
A further advantage of the nonaqueous<br>
absorption methods described, over the water absorption<br>
method, is to facilitate the removal of the light<br>
compounds.<br>
The role of the desorption column located<br>
downstream of the absorption column is to reduce the<br>
contents of light condensable compounds in the bottom<br>
stream of the absorption column, particularly<br>
unconverted acrolein, residual water and acetic acid<br>
(case of the synthesis of acrylic acid) , or<br>
methacrolein, water, acrylic acid and acetic acid (case<br>
of methacrylic acid).<br>
However, this removal of the light impurities<br>
is not complete in the methods described in the prior<br>
art. Thus, the method for purifying acrylic acid with<br>
absorption by a mixture of diphenyl and diphenyl ether,<br>
described in French patent FR-B-2 146 386, yields a raw<br>
acrylic acid still containing 0.5% by weight of acetic<br>
acid and 0.5% by weight of water. American patent USA-<br>
5 426 221, describing a method with absorption of<br>
acrylic acid by a mixture of diphenyl, diphenyl ether<br>
and dimethyl phthalate, serves to improve the removal<br>
of water (representing 0.04% by weight of the raw<br>
acrylic acid distilled in the example) , but it still<br>
leaves 0.26% by weight of acetic acid in the purified<br>
acrylic acid without an additional topping step. The<br>
method of absorption by carboxylic esters described in<br>
French patent FR-B-2 196 986 serves to obtain a grade<br>
of acrylic acid still containing 0.3% by weight of<br>
acetic acid 0.2% by weight of water.<br>
The grades of acrylic acid obtained by this<br>
method are insufficient, in the absence of<br>
supplementary purification, for the use of the monomer<br>
in its conventional applications. To improve the<br>
removal of the light compounds without adding an<br>
additional column, • solutions have been proposed,<br>
consisting in carrying out the topping in an upper<br>
section added to the final acrylic acid distillation<br>
column. Thus, European patent EP-B-706 986 mentions a<br>
recovery column in which the acrylic acid is obtained<br>
by a side drawoff, the upper section of the column<br>
being used to concentrate the residual light compounds<br>
at the top, in order to remove them. The major drawback<br>
of such a method is the difficulty of separating the<br>
light compounds, particularly acetic acid, thereby<br>
requiring a significant increase in the number of trays<br>
of the column and condensed flow rate returned to the<br>
top (reflux) to ensure the separation and reduce the<br>
loss of acrylic acid. This causes a substantial<br>
increase in the size of the column, and hence in the<br>
investment cost, where, at equivalent column size, a<br>
decrease in the column distillation capacity.<br>
Furthermore, this system generates a stream still<br>
containing AA which, to avoid its loss, must be<br>
recycled to a preceding step. This makes the method<br>
even more complex and limits the capacity of the column<br>
receiving this stream.<br>
A further drawback of absorption methods using<br>
heavy hydrophobic solvents is the fact that large<br>
quantities of solvent are needed to absorb all the<br>
acrylic acid present in the reaction gases. In French<br>
patent FR-B-2 146 386, to reach a sufficient recovery<br>
rate and avoid costly losses of unabsorbed acrylic<br>
acid, the mass ratio of solvent (mixture of diphenyl<br>
and diphenyl ether) to acrylic acid is about 9/1, or a<br>
concentration of acrylic acid in the raw mixture after<br>
absorption and desorption, of about 10%. The<br>
consequences of the large size of the columns and<br>
ancillary equipment and storage units, higher energy<br>
costs associated with vaporization of high boiling<br>
point solvent in the columns.<br>
Moreover, the absorption methods using<br>
nonaqueous solvents described in the literature have<br>
the common feature of carrying out the desorption step<br>
by stripping by an inert gas introduced at the bottom<br>
of the column. This inert gas may be nitrogen, air or<br>
part or all of the uncondensed gases at the top of the<br>
absorption column. The quantity introduced generally<br>
represents between 15% and 30% of the total gas input<br>
issuing from the reaction step. The drawback of this<br>
introduction of external gas is that, being sent to the<br>
absorption column to recover the acrylic acid that it<br>
contains, is added to the reaction gas which makes up<br>
its main feed, and consequently, the maximum absorption<br>
capacity of the column is thereby limited. Finally, and<br>
for equivalent at production capacity, the size of the<br>
absorption and stripping columns increases with the<br>
flow rate of external gas introduced.<br>
A further drawback of the method of stripping<br>
by an external gas is to dilute the uncondensed gases<br>
at the top of the column and consequently cause a<br>
dilution of the part of these gases sent to the<br>
reaction step in order to recover the noble compounds<br>
that they contain (propylene, acrolein, traces of<br>
acrylic acid) . Thus, for the same quantity of noble<br>
compounds recycled in the absence of external stripping<br>
gas, the flow of gases entering the reactor is<br>
increased by the introduction of this external gas.<br>
This results either in an increase in the flow rate of<br>
gas fed to the reactors, at constant reactant flow<br>
rate, causing accelerated aging of the catalysts due to<br>
the higher operating temperature to obtain the same<br>
yield performance, or, at constant flow rate of gas<br>
entering the reactors, reduced productivity by<br>
decreasing the flow rate of the reactants.<br>
European patent EP 706 986, which describes a<br>
method of absorption by nonaqueous solvent without a<br>
desorption column, is incapable of obtaining the<br>
efficient removal of the light compounds, particularly<br>
acetic acid, claimed in the methods described with a<br>
desorption column.<br>
Finally, the patents described in the prior art<br>
mention a water condensation section at the top of the<br>
absorption column. The condensed aqueous stream is<br>
particularly rich in polar compounds having<br>
volatilities lower than or close to that of water,<br>
particularly organic acids such as formic acid, acetic<br>
acid and acrylic acid. Due to the pollutant nature of<br>
this stream, it cannot be removed without subsequent<br>
removal treatment, generally by incineration of the<br>
organic compounds. The cost of this incineration<br>
treatment is increased by the fact that the stream to<br>
be treated is a liquid stream, consisting mainly of<br>
water.<br>
European Patent Application EP-A2-1 125 912<br>
teaches a method for purifying acrylic acid comprising<br>
a step of absorption by a heavy hydrophobic solvent,<br>
followed by a distillation step in a column under<br>
reduced pressure for topping, followed by distillation<br>
to obtain the acrylic acid without the solvent.<br>
According to this method, the mass flow rate of<br>
heavy solvent is 0.2-4.5 times the mass flow rate of<br>
acrylic acid, and the stream sent to the column under<br>
reduced pressure contains acrylic acid at the rate of<br>
18 to 75% by weight.<br>
The applicant company has tried to further<br>
improve the absorption efficiency and decrease the<br>
proportion of acetic acid in the acrylic acid.<br>
This purpose has been achieved by the choice of<br>
a particular range of the solvent/(meth)acrylic acid<br>
ratio and by carrying out the desorption step using a<br>
rectification column that is distinguished from the<br>
distillation column of European Application EP-A2-1 125<br>
912 by the fact that it operates with a top feed,<br>
without reflux, and by particular operating conditions<br>
of this column, such as its distillate rate relative to<br>
the flow rate of (meth)acrylic acid introduced into the<br>
absorption column.<br>
In the method according to European Patent<br>
Application EP-A2-1 125 912, the two absorption and<br>
distillation columns are independent. Due to its<br>
operation with the high imposed reflux ratio<br>
(preferably 3/1 to 6/1) , the distillate rate of the<br>
distillation column sent to the absorption column,<br>
relative to the rate of flow of acrylic acid flowing<br>
into the latter column, is very low (
contrary, according to the present invention, the two<br>
columns of absorption and rectification without reflux,<br>
form an inseparable whole, the performance of one being<br>
dependent on that of the other, and the composition of<br>
the stream of the loop flowing between the bottom of Cl<br>
and the top of C2 serves to improve the overall<br>
separation performance.<br>
Surprisingly, the overall performance is<br>
improved in relation to the method according to EP-A2-1<br>
125 912 despite the lower column efficiencies: the<br>
absorption column has been estimated at 65-70<br>
theoretical trays in the examples of the abovementioned<br>
patent application, compared with 35-40 in the examples<br>
of the invention; and the distillation column has 28<br>
Oldershaw trays in the examples of the abovementioned<br>
European Patent Application, compared with 15<br>
perforated downcomer-type trays with equivalent<br>
theoretical efficiency in the examples of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Furthermore, the use of a rectification column<br>
without reflux, supplied at the top, has the advantage,<br>
over a rectification column with reflux, of<br>
significantly reducing the formation of polymers at the<br>
top of the column, the (meth)acrylic acid concentration<br>
in the liquid present on the upper trays being much<br>
lower than in a rectification column.<br>
The method in the present invention is<br>
suitable, with only two columns (one absorption column,<br>
one rectification column) for carrying out<br>
simultaneously:<br>
the recovery of (meth) acrylic acid with a yield<br>
higher than 98.5%, advantageously higher than 99%;<br>
the recovery of a stream of raw (meth)acrylic acid<br>
concentrated in the solvent, containing at least<br>
20% of (meth)acrylic acid;<br>
the nearly complete removal of the light<br>
compounds, particularly water and acetic acid<br>
(case of the synthesis of acrylic acid) or water,<br>
acetic acid and acrylic acid (case of the<br>
synthesis of methacrylic acid), making it<br>
possible, without an additional topping step, to<br>
obtain a (meth)acrylic acid advantageously<br>
containing less than 0.05% of water, less than<br>
0.01% of acrolein and less than 0.1% of acetic<br>
acid.<br>
The percentage of (meth)acrylic acid obtained<br>
in the bottom of the rectification column is<br>
substantially 10-33% by weight, particularly 20% to 25%<br>
by weight.<br>
Moreover, since the rectification step is<br>
carried out without the introduction of external inert<br>
gas, the method described has the additional advantage<br>
of reducing the size of the purification equipment and<br>
facilitating the recycling of the uncondensed gases at<br>
the top of the absorption column to the reaction step.<br>
Finally, according to a particularly<br>
advantageous embodiment, the uncondensed gas at the top<br>
of the absorption column undergoes no condensation, and<br>
is sent in gaseous form, partly to the reaction step<br>
and partly to a purge treatment section (incineration).<br>
This results in a substantial decrease in pollutant<br>
aqueous releases and in the cost of the treatment of<br>
the purge stream.<br>
Thus the subject of the present invention is a<br>
method for purifying (meth)acrylic acid obtained by<br>
catalytic or redox oxidation, of a gas substrate<br>
consisting of propane and/or propylene and/or acrolein<br>
in the case of the manufacture of acrylic acid, and of<br>
isobutane and/or isobutene and/or tert-butyl alcohol<br>
and/or methacrolein in the case of the manufacture of<br>
methacrylic acid, said gas mixture (1) mainly<br>
consisting of:<br>
propane and/or propylene or isobutane and/or<br>
isobutene if previously contained by the substrate;<br>
final oxidation products;<br>
the desired (meth)acrylic acid;<br>
(meth)acrolein;<br>
tertbutyl alcohol in the case of the manufacture<br>
of methacrylic acid;<br>
water vapor;<br>
acetic acid with, in the case of the manufacture<br>
of methacrylic acid, acrylic acid as a byproduct; and<br>
heavy products of side reactions,<br>
according to which the reaction gas mixture (1) is sent<br>
to the bottom of an absorption column (Cl) which is<br>
supplied at the top and in countercurrent with at least<br>
one heavy hydrophobic absorption solvent, to obtain:<br>
at the top of the column (Cl) a gas stream (7)<br>
consisting of:<br>
propane and/or propylene or isobutane and/or<br>
isobutene, according to whether acrylic acid or<br>
methacrylic acid is manufactured, and the products of<br>
the final oxidation of the mixture (1) ;<br>
major quantities of water and acetic acid in the<br>
case of the manufacture of acrylic acid, or of water,<br>
acetic acid and acrylic acid in the case of the<br>
manufacture of methacrylic acid; and<br>
(meth)acrolein;<br>
at the bottom of said column (Cl) , a stream (4)<br>
consisting of:<br>
(meth)acrylic acid;<br>
the heavy absorption solvent or solvents;<br>
the heavy products of side reactions; and<br>
minor quantities of acetic acid and water, in the<br>
case of the manufacture of acrylic acid and acetic<br>
acid, acrylic acid and water in the case of the<br>
manufacture of methacrylic acid,<br>
the stream issuing from the column (Cl) is then sent to<br>
a separation column (C2) in which a separation is<br>
carried out to obtain:<br>
at the top, a stream consisting of light<br>
impurities which are sent to the bottom part of the<br>
absorption column (Cl); and<br>
at the bottom, a stream consisting of:<br>
(meth)acrylic acid in solution in the absorption<br>
solvent or solvents;<br>
a small proportion of acetic acid in the case of<br>
the manufacture of acrylic acid and acetic acid and of<br>
acrylic acid in the case of the manufacture of<br>
methacrylic acid;<br>
the heavy products of side reactions; and<br>
the polymerization inhibitor or inhibitors,<br>
characterized in that the column (Cl) is operated with<br>
a heavy solvent flow rate that is 3 to 5.6 times the<br>
flow rate of (meth) acrylic acid in the feed gas<br>
mixture, and in that, as a separation column (C2), a<br>
rectification column is used, which is operated with a<br>
flow feed and without reflux.<br>
According to an advantageous feature of the<br>
method of the invention, the column (C2) is operated<br>
under conditions such that its distillate rate relative<br>
to the flow rate of (meth) acrylic acid introduced into<br>
the absorption column (Cl) is between 0.5/1 and 4/1,<br>
particularly between 2/1 and 3/1.<br>
An absorption column (Cl) is advantageously<br>
used comprising:<br>
in its lower part, at least one cooling section<br>
(SI) equipped with a system for recirculating, via an<br>
external heat exchanger (El), part of the stream<br>
collected in the lower part of said section or sections<br>
(SI) to send it to the flow of said sections; and<br>
in its upper part, a section (S2) for the<br>
absorption and rectification of the reaction gas<br>
mixture.<br>
A section (S2) in particular is used, in which<br>
the number of theoretical plates is 25 to 50, and<br>
preferably 30 to 45.<br>
The absorption is carried out in the column<br>
(Cl) generally at atmospheric pressure or under a<br>
pressure close to atmospheric pressure, and<br>
advantageously at a solvent introduction temperature of<br>
20 to 80°C, preferably 30 to 60°C.<br>
According to particular features of the method<br>
of the invention, the column (Cl) is operated at a<br>
bottom temperature of 50 to 120°C, particularly of 70<br>
to 100°C; at a overhead head gas temperature of 40 to<br>
70°C, particularly of 50 to 60 °C; and the reaction<br>
gases are introduced at a temperature of 100 °C to<br>
200°C, particularly of 130°C to 180°C.<br>
The patent literature provides numerous<br>
examples of heavy hydrophobic solvents. Advantageous<br>
use is made of one or more heavy hydrophobic absorption<br>
solvents having a boiling point above 200°C under<br>
atmospheric pressure, ditolylether being particularly<br>
preferred as a heavy hydrophobic solvent. The<br>
absorption column (Cl) can be fed with one or more pure<br>
solvents and/or with one or more solvents issuing from<br>
the recycling of one or more streams obtained from the<br>
subsequent purification steps.<br>
The absorption is generally carried out in the<br>
column (Cl) in the presence of at least one<br>
polymerization inhibitor, selected in particular from<br>
phenolic derivatives such as hydroquinone and its<br>
derivatives such as methyl ether of hydroquinone,<br>
phenothiazine and its derivatives, such as methylene<br>
blue, quinones, such as benzoquinone, metal<br>
thiocarbamates, such as copper dibutyldithiocarbamate,<br>
compounds with nitroso groups, such as N-nitrosophenylhydroxylamine,<br>
amines such as derivatives of<br>
paraphenylenediamine, or N-oxyl compounds, such as 4-<br>
hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethy1-piperidine-N-oxyl.<br>
According to a first embodiment of the method<br>
of the invention, the gas stream issuing from the top<br>
of the column (Cl) is removed partly to the reaction<br>
section, and partly to an incineration or purge step.<br>
According to a second embodiment of the method<br>
of the invention, the gas stream issuing from the top<br>
of the column (Cl) is sent to the bottom of a<br>
condensation section (S3) where this gas mixture is<br>
placed in intimate contact with a descending liquid<br>
stream fed at the top of said section (S3) and<br>
consisting of the recycling of part of the bottom<br>
stream of said section (S3) previously cooled by an<br>
external heat exchanger (E4).<br>
The diagrams appended hereto illustrate the<br>
invention (Figures 1 and 2).<br>
Figure I shows a first embodiment. The<br>
reaction gas mixture issuing from the oxidation of<br>
propylene arid acrolein (in the case of the manufacture<br>
of acrylic acid) or from the oxidation of isobutene and<br>
methacrolein (in the case of the manufacture of<br>
methacrylic acid), mainly consists of:<br>
on the one hand, incondensable compounds in the<br>
operating pressure conditions of the column:<br>
propylene, final oxidation products (CO, C02) ;<br>
on the other, condensable compounds: acrylic acid,<br>
acrolein, water and acetic acid in the case of the<br>
manufacture of acrylic acid, or methacrylic acid,<br>
methacrolein, water, acrylic acid and acetic acid<br>
in the case of the manufacture of methacrylic<br>
acid, heavier side reaction products in very small<br>
quantities,<br>
is sent (stream 1) to the bottom of an absorption<br>
column Cl fed at the top and in countercurrent with a<br>
solvent (stream 2: heavy hydrophobic solvent with a<br>
boiling point above 200°C under atmospheric pressure).<br>
Preferably, the column comprises:<br>
in its lower part, one or more cooling sections S1<br>
equipped with systems for recirculating, through<br>
one or more external heat exchangers El, part of<br>
the stream collected in the lower part of SI<br>
(stream 3), to send it to the top of this section;<br>
in its upper part, a section S2 in which the<br>
absorption and rectification of the mixture is<br>
carried out.<br>
The solvent feed is provided above the section<br>
S2. The solvent introduced may be a pure solvent or<br>
may issue from a recycling of a stream obtained in the<br>
subsequent purification steps. Preferably, the column<br>
Cl operates under a pressure close to atmospheric<br>
pressure.<br>
The stream 4 obtained at the bottom of the<br>
column Cl mainly consists of acrylic acid and solvent,<br>
and small quantities of acetic acid, water and<br>
acrolein. This stream 4, of which the temperature may<br>
optionally be adjusted through a heat exchanger E2, is<br>
then stripped of these light impurities (desorption<br>
step) by sending it to the top of a distillation column<br>
C2 in which they are concentrated at the top, in a<br>
mixture with acrylic acid and traces of solvent. The<br>
gas stream 5 is condensed through a heat exchanger E3<br>
and sent to the column Cl, at a place located in the<br>
lower part thereof, preferably in one of the cooling<br>
loops S1. The stream 6 obtained at the bottom of<br>
column C2 then mainly consists of acrylic acid in<br>
solution in the solvent, and heavy impurities, issuing<br>
from side reactions, present in small quantities in the<br>
reaction gas stream.<br>
Advantageously, the column C2 operates under<br>
reduced pressure and the gas used for the desorption of<br>
the light compounds is generated by boiling the column<br>
bottom mixture through a heat exchanger (boiler).<br>
The gas stream 7 issuing from the column Cl<br>
contains the compounds initially present in the<br>
reaction gas and not absorbed: incondensable products<br>
at the operating pressure of the column (propylene, CO,<br>
CO2 in the case of the manufacture of acrylic acid;<br>
isobutene, GO, C02, in the case of the manufacture of<br>
methacrylic acid), water, acrolein or methacrolein<br>
according to whether acrylic acid or methacrylic acid<br>
is manufactured, acetic acid in the case of the<br>
manufacture of acrylic acid, or acetic acid and acrylic<br>
acid in the case of the manufacture of methacrylic<br>
acid.<br>
According to the first embodiment (Figure 1) ,<br>
the gas stream 7 issuing from the top of the column Cl<br>
contains all the water, formic acid, acetic acid and<br>
acrolein, which are directly removed, partly to the<br>
reaction section (stream 8), to complete the conversion<br>
of the noble reactants that it contains, and partly<br>
(stream 9) to an incineration (purge) treatment step.<br>
According to a second embodiment (Figure 2) ,<br>
the ascending gas stream issuing from the section S2 of<br>
column Cl is sent to the bottom of a condensation<br>
section S3 where this gas mixture is placed in intimate<br>
contact with a descending liquid stream (stream 7), fed<br>
at the top of this section, and consisting of the<br>
recycling of part of the bottom stream from section S3<br>
previously cooled by a heat exchanger E4.<br>
The section S3 may also consist of a distinct<br>
column in series with the column Cl. The gas stream 9<br>
from the top of section S3 contains the compounds<br>
present in the gas stream issuing from the top of<br>
section S2, except part of the water and all the formic<br>
acid, acetic acid (case of the manufacture of acrylic<br>
acid) or acetic and acrylic acids (case of the<br>
manufacture of methacrylic acid), which are removed in<br>
the stream 8. Most of the stream 9 will be<br>
advantageously recycled to the reaction step (stream<br>
10), to convert the noble reactants which it contains,<br>
and a slight purge of this stream (stream 11) can be<br>
carried out to prevent holdup in the loop thus formed<br>
of the incondensable compounds resulting from the final<br>
oxidation of the propylene (CO, C02) and the nitrogen<br>
from the air introduced in the reaction step.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
In these Examples, the following abbreviations<br>
have been used:<br>
- AA : acrylic acid;<br>
- AcOH : acetic acid;<br>
- AGO : acrolein;<br>
- DTE : ditolylether;<br>
- EMHQ : hydroquinone methyl ether<br>
The examples described below illustrate the<br>
invention. The percentages are indicated as mass<br>
percentages.<br>
Example 1<br>
The experimental rig used is the one shown in<br>
Figure 1 in the drawing appended hereto.<br>
The gas mixture fed to the absorption column Cl<br>
is representative of a reaction medium issuing from the<br>
second stage of a reactor for oxidizing propylene to<br>
acrylic acid. It consists of condensable compounds:<br>
- AA : 14.1%;<br>
- AcOH : 0.8%;<br>
- AGO : 0.45%;<br>
- H20 : 7.81%<br>
and incondensable inert compounds:<br>
- N2 : 69.83%;<br>
- O2 : 2.5%;<br>
- propylene : 1.2%;<br>
- C02 : 3.31%.<br>
This gas mixture is sent at a rate of 709 g/h,<br>
at a temperature of 165 °C, to the bottom of a glass<br>
column Cl, having an overall efficiency of 42<br>
theoretical trays, and consisting of a lower cooling<br>
section S1 equipped with five perforated trays with<br>
downcomer, and an upper absorption-distillation section<br>
S2 equipped with 14 Sulzer type packing elements EX.<br>
The reaction gas is fed at the bottom of the lower<br>
cooling section SI.<br>
The column Cl is fed at the top of its upper<br>
section S2 with a stream consisting of DTE, at a flow<br>
rate of 400 g/h (solvent/acrylic acid ratio in the<br>
reaction gas = 4/1), in which 0.1% of EMHQ has been<br>
previously dissolved as polymerization inhibitor. The<br>
temperature of introduction of the absorption solvent<br>
is 54°C.<br>
The operating pressure in the column Cl is<br>
atmospheric pressure. The temperature measured at the<br>
bottom of the column Cl is 84 °C. The temperature is<br>
52°C at the top of this column Cl.<br>
To analyze all the organic compounds entrained<br>
in the flow gas stream, it is absorbed in a scrubbing<br>
column where it meets a large countercurrent stream of<br>
water (13 700 g/h) at a temperature of 20°C.<br>
The acetic acid recovered at the top represents<br>
98.7% of initial acetic acid, and acrylic acid, 0.3% of<br>
the initial acrylic acid (acrylic acid recovery yield:<br>
99.7%).<br>
Part of the liquid stream obtained at the<br>
bottom of section SI of the absorption column Cl is<br>
sent via a pump through a double jacket heat exchanger<br>
El, where it is cooled to 70°C, at the top of section<br>
SI.<br>
The remainder of the mixture obtained at the<br>
bottom of section S1 is cooled through a heat exchanger<br>
E2, to a temperature of 35 °C, and is then sent via a<br>
pump to the top of a glass column C2, equipped with 15<br>
perforated trays with downcomer, for a total efficiency<br>
of 11 theoretical trays. The column C2 is provided at<br>
the bottom with a thermosiphon boiler and at the top of<br>
a condenser E3.<br>
The distillation is carried out in this column<br>
C2 under reduced pressure of 187 hPa (140 mmHg) . The<br>
temperature measured at the bottom of column C2 is<br>
113°C, and the temperature at the top reaches 88°C.<br>
All the vapors condensed in the heat exchanger<br>
E3 (318 g/h, or a mass ratio of distillate rate<br>
relative to the flow rate of acrylic acid introduced<br>
into the column Cl of 3.2/1) is sent via a pump to the<br>
external cooling loop of the column Cl, upstream of the<br>
pump which recirculates the bottom mixture of section<br>
S1, through the heat exchanger El, to the top of the<br>
section.<br>
The liquid stream extracted at the bottom of<br>
this column C2 (497.6 g/h), contains 20.2% of acrylic<br>
acid. After distillation to separate the solvent, the<br>
acrylic acid obtained at the top of the column contains<br>
0.068% of acetic acid, less than 0.01% of acrolein and<br>
less than 0.01% of water.<br>
Example 2<br>
The experimental rig is identical to that of<br>
the preceding Example 1.<br>
The column Cl operates under atmospheric<br>
pressure, while the operating pressure of the column C2<br>
is 187 hPa (140 mmHg).<br>
A gas mixture with the same composition is fed<br>
with the same flow rate to column Cl in its lower part,<br>
at a temperature of 165°C.<br>
The flow rate of DTE introduced at a<br>
temperature of 53 °C at the top of column Cl is now<br>
reduced to 300 g/h (solvent/acrylic acid ratio in the<br>
reaction gas = 3/1).<br>
The column top temperature is 51 °C, and the<br>
bottom temperature is 77°C. The top and bottom<br>
temperatures for column C2 are 83 °C and 111°C<br>
respectively. Part of the bottom stream of column Cl<br>
sent to the top of section SI is cooled to 68°C through<br>
the heat exchanger El. The remainder of the liquid<br>
stream from the bottom of column Cl fed to the column<br>
C2 is previously cooled to 34°C. The mass ratio of the<br>
distillate rate of the column C2 relative to the flow<br>
rate of acrylic acid fed to the column Cl is 3.3/1.<br>
The acetic acid and acrylic acid recovered<br>
after absorption of the water stripping column<br>
(17 600 g/h) respectively represent 98.6% and 0.9% of<br>
the initial compounds (acrylic acid recovery yield:<br>
99.1%).<br>
The acrylic acid concentration in the bottom<br>
stream of column C2 reaches 24.5%. After separating<br>
the solvent by distillation, the acrylic acid obtained<br>
only contains 0.087% of acetic acid and less than 0.01%<br>
of acrolein and water.<br>
Example 3<br>
In the same conditions of experimental rig,<br>
pressure, temperature, composition and input gas flow<br>
rate as in Example 1, the acrylic acid is absorbed by a<br>
countercurrent stream on DTE fed at the top of the<br>
column at a flow rate of 560 g/h (solvent/acrylic acid<br>
ratio in the reaction gas: 5.6/1) and at a temperature<br>
of 50°C.<br>
The column flow temperature is 51.6°C, and the<br>
bottom temperature is 82°C. The flow and bottom<br>
temperatures of column C2 are 86.4°C and 120.5°C<br>
respectively. The part of the stream of column Cl sent<br>
to the top of section S1 is cooled to 69°C through the<br>
heat exchanger El. The remainder of the bottom liquid<br>
stream of column Cl is fed to column C2 at a<br>
temperature of 61°C. The mass ratio of the distillate<br>
rate of column C2 relative to the flow rate of acrylic<br>
acid fed to the column Cl is 1.1/1.<br>
The stream obtained at the bottom of column C2<br>
contains 15.1% of acrylic acid. After separating the<br>
solvent by distillation, the acetic acid concentration<br>
in the acrylic acid obtained is 0.058%, and this stream<br>
contains less than 0.01% of acrolein and water.<br>
The acetic acid and acrylic acid recovered<br>
after absorption in the water stripping column<br>
 (21 120 g/h) represent 99.55% and 0.4% of the initial<br>
compounds (acrylic acid recovery yield: 99.6%).<br>
Example 4 (Comparative)<br>
In the same conditions of experimental rig,<br>
pressure, temperature, composition and input gas flow<br>
rate as in Example 1, the acrylic acid is absorbed by a<br>
countercurrent stream DTE fed at the top of the column<br>
at a flow rate of 100 g/h (solvent/acrylic acid ratio<br>
in the reaction gas = 1/1) and a temperature of 45°C.<br>
The column flow temperature is 52.6°C, and the<br>
bottom temperature is 78.9°C. The top and bottom<br>
temperatures of column C2 are 84.9°C and 104.4°C<br>
respectively. The part of the stream of column Cl sent<br>
to the top of section SI is cooled to 70°C through the<br>
heat exchanger El. The remainder of the bottom liquid<br>
stream of column Cl is fed to column C2 at a<br>
temperature of 74°C. The mass ratio of the distillate<br>
rate of column C2 relative to the flow rate of acrylic<br>
acid fed to the column Cl is 3.9/1.<br>
The stream obtained at the bottom of column C2<br>
contains 44.6% of acrylic acid. After separating the<br>
solvent by distillation the acetic acid concentration<br>
in the acrylic acid obtained is 0.045%, and this stream<br>
contains less than 0.01% of acrolein and water.<br>
The acetic acid and acrylic acid recovered<br>
after absorption in the water stripping column<br>
(19 550 g/h) represent 99.35% and 17.2% of the initial<br>
compounds. The acrylic acid recovery yield is<br>
therefore particularly low: 82.2%.<br>
To try to improve this recovery yield, the<br>
experiment was repeated in identical conditions, apart<br>
from the fact that the column Cl contained three<br>
additional SULZER EX elements in its section S2. The<br>
total efficiency of the column was then 50 theoretical<br>
trays.<br>
On completion of the test, the performance was<br>
not significantly improved: acetic acid concentration<br>
in the distilled acrylic acid: 0.054%, and acrylic acid<br>
recovery yield: 84%.<br>
A third attempt to improve the acrylic acid<br>
recovery yield, in the same conditions as described<br>
above, but reducing the solvent feed temperature of the<br>
top of the column Cl to 20°C, also terminated in<br>
failure. In the operating conditions under atmospheric<br>
pressure of the absorption column, the removal of the<br>
light compounds of the top of the column became<br>
impossible, thereby causing the holdup of these light<br>
compounds of the column bottom, the flooding of the<br>
column C2 and the rapid formation of polymers in this<br>
latter column.<br>
Example 5 (Comparative)<br>
This example is carried out in the same<br>
conditions of pressure, temperature, composition and<br>
flow rate of input gas as in Example 1. The rig is the<br>
same as in Example 1, apart from the fact that the<br>
absorption column was equipped with 17 SULZER EX<br>
elements in section S2, equivalent to a total<br>
efficiency of the column Cl of 50 theoretical trays.<br>
The acrylic acid was absorbed by a countercurrent<br>
stream of ditolylether fed at the top of the column at<br>
a flow rate of 233 g/h (solvent/acrylic acid ratio in<br>
the reaction gas = 2.33/1) and a temperature of 45°C.<br>
The column Cl flow temperature is 51.5°C, and<br>
the bottom temperature is 76.9°C. The flow and bottom<br>
temperatures of column C2 are 83.3°C and 108.5°C<br>
respectively. The part of the stream of column Cl<br>
bottom sent to the top of section SI is cooled to 75°C<br>
through the heat exchanger El. The remainder of the<br>
bottom liquid stream of column Cl is fed to column C2<br>
at a temperature of 35 °C. The mass ratio of the<br>
distillate rate of column C2 relative to the flow rate<br>
of acrylic acid fed to the column Cl is 3/1.<br>
The stream obtained at the bottom of column Cl<br>
contains 29.5% of acrylic acid. After separating the<br>
solvent by distillation the acetic acid concentration<br>
in the acrylic acid obtained is 0.06%, and this stream<br>
contains less than 0.01% of acrolein and water.<br>
The acetic acid and acrylic acid recovered<br>
after absorption in the water stripping column<br>
(18 540 g/h) respectively represent 99.04% and 3% of<br>
the initial compounds. The acrylic acid recovery yield<br>
therefore remains low: 97%, despite the increased<br>
efficiency of the column Cl.<br>
Example 6<br>
The principle of the method employed in this<br>
third example is that of Figure 2 appended hereto. The<br>
columns Cl and C2 are identical, operating at the same<br>
pressures as in the preceding examples, and an<br>
additional partial condensation column C3 (equivalent<br>
to the section S3 in Figure 2) , operating at<br>
atmospheric pressure, is placed in a series at the top<br>
of the column Cl, in order to remove the organic<br>
compounds entrained in the top gas stream of this<br>
column, in the form of an aqueous stream.<br>
The reaction gas mixture (709 g/h) of the same<br>
composition as in the preceding examples is introduced<br>
at a temperature of 164°C into column Cl. The DTE is<br>
fed to this column Cl at the top, at a rate of 300 g/h,<br>
at a temperature of 53°C. The respective temperatures<br>
at the top and bottom of column Cl are 51°C and 77°C,<br>
those of column C2 are 83°C (flow) and 111°C (bottom) .<br>
The bottom stream of column Cl in the recirculation<br>
loop at the top of section SI is cooled to 68°C through<br>
the heat exchanger El. The remainder of this bottom<br>
stream of column Cl is fed to column C2 at a<br>
temperature of 32°C. The mass ratio of the distillate<br>
rate of the column C2 relative to the flow rate of<br>
acrylic acid fed to the column Cl is 1.9/1.<br>
The liquid stream obtained at the bottom of<br>
column C2 (raw acrylic acid) contains 24.5% of acrylic<br>
acid. After distillation to remove the solvent, the<br>
pure acrylic acid obtained contains 0.08% of acetic<br>
acid, less than 0.01% of water and less than 0.01% of<br>
acrolein.<br>
The gas stream extracted from the top of column<br>
C2 is sent to the bottom of the condensation column C3,<br>
where it encounters an aqueous countercurrent stream<br>
formed by the recirculation, to the top of column S3,<br>
and through a heat exchanger E4, of part of the stream<br>
recovered at the bottom of this column. The<br>
temperature of the uncondensed gases at the top of this<br>
section is 42°C. A purge of 22.3 g/h (or 35% of the<br>
water present in the initial reaction gas) is carried<br>
out at the recirculation loop of this column. This<br>
purged aqueous mixture contains 11.24% of acetic acid<br>
(or 49% of the initial acetic acid) and 0.08% of<br>
acrolein (or 0.56% of the initial acrolein).<br>
The gas stream leaving the top of the<br>
condensation column is sent in countercurrent with a<br>
high flow of water (18 250 g/h) in a stripping column<br>
intended to quantify the losses of organic products in<br>
the uncondensed stream at the top of S3. All the<br>
acetic acid and the acrylic acid recovered at the top<br>
of column C2 (condensation column and stripping column)<br>
respectively represents 98.5% and 0.9% of the compounds<br>
present in the initial reaction gas (acrylic acid<br>
recovery yield: 99.1%).<br><br><br><br><br>
