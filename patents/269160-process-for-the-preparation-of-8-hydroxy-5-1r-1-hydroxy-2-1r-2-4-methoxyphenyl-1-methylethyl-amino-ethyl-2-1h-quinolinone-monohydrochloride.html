				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF 8-HYDROXY-5-[(1R)-1-<br>
HYDROXY-2[[(1R)-2-(4-METHOXYPHENYL)-1-METHYLETHYL]AMINO]-<br>
ETHYL]-2(1H)-QUlNOLINONE MONOHYDROCHLORIDE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of 8-hydroxy-5-<br>
[(1R)-1-hydroxy-2[[(1R)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]amino]ethyl]-<br>
2(1H)-quinolinone monohydrochloride. Useful intermediates in the process<br>
are also disclosed.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
8-Hydroxy-5-[(1R)-1-hydroxy-2[[(1R)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-methyl-<br>
ethyl]amino]ethyl]-2(1H)-quinolinone monohydrochloride (I) is known from EP<br>
0 147 71, in the name of Tanabe, as a bronchodilator provided with a potent<br>
beta-2-adrenoceptor stimulating action.<br>
The compound, that has also been defined as 8-hydroxy-5-{(1R)-1-<br>
hydroxy-2-{N-((1R)-2-(p-methoxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl)amino]ethyl}<br>
carbostyril hydrochloride and referred to as TA 2005, is identified hereinafter<br>
for the sake of convenience also with the code CHF4226.<br><br><br>
EP 0147719 discloses a process for the preparation of TA2005,<br>
including within its scope all four optical isomers and mixture thereof.<br>
The process consists in the halogenation or oxidation of a compound<br>
of the formula (VII):<br><br>
to give respectively a compound of the formula (VIII) or (IX), where X<br>
is halogen atom and Y'O- is hydroxyl or a conventionally protected hydroxy!,<br><br>
which by reaction with N-(2-(p-methoxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl)-amine of<br>
formula (X)<br><br>
gives a compound of formula (IT) or (III'):<br><br><br>
which are reduced by reacting with a reducing agent to give the<br>
compound (IV).<br><br>
The compound (IV) is obtained in the form of a mixture of two<br>
stereoisomers, (i.e., α- or β-isomers, constituted by a mixture of (R),(R)- and<br>
(S),(S)-isomers thereof or a mixture of (R),(S)- and (S),(R)-isomers thereof)<br>
that must be separated into each of the optical isomers of the compound (IV)<br>
through a lengthy and time consuming method.<br>
Compound (I) is then obtained by the removal of the protecting group<br>
by catalytic hydrogenation of compound (IV).<br>
The process for the preparation of (I) according to EP 0147719 shows<br><br>
some problems and disadvantages.<br>
For example compound (X), is considered a psychostimulant and<br>
hallucinogen, classified among psychotropic substances in many countries,<br>
therefore its preparation and use is regulated by very restrictive rules which<br>
makes its employment difficult without particular authorisations.<br>
Moreover, its preparation, disclosed on page 16, preparation 3 of<br>
EP 0147719, requires reagents of difficult preparation such as a-methyl-a-<br>
nitro-p-methoxystyrene and (S)-1 -(2-naphthylsulfonyl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic<br>
acid.<br>
In addition, the process for its resolution, through fractional<br>
crystallization, seems quite difficult, especially for the use of many solvents<br>
or solvent mixtures, such as methanol, or ethyl acetate and isopropanol and<br>
of uncommon and expensive resolving agents, such as (S)-1-(2-<br>
naphthylsulfonyl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid. Furthermore, the reported<br>
yield, after crystallization, is very low, about 35%.<br>
Moreover the synthesis of compound (I) according to EP 0147719<br>
requires two hydrogenation steps, both carried out with catalytic Pd/C<br>
hydrogenation conditions to obtain (X) from its precursor, a-methyl- a-nitro-p-<br>
methoxystyrene and to deprotect the phenolic group during the conversion of<br>
(IV) to (I).<br>
Therefore there is a need to develop a process for the preparation of<br>
CHF4226 which does not have all the above mentioned drawbacks of the<br>
prior art and in particular there is a need to develop a process leading to the<br>
desired CHF4226 having the (R),(R) configuration.<br>
The present invention relates to a more convenient, efficient process<br>
for the preparation of optically pure isomers of (I), alternative to the one<br>
disclosed in EP 0147719.<br>
This method is particularly advantageous in comparison with known<br><br>
methods because it utilizes optically pure precursors that are readily<br>
available by simple resolution and asymmetric reduction, and immediately<br>
leads to the correct (R),(R) configuration of compound (I), resulting in a<br>
simpler procedure giving higher yields.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a more convenient process for<br>
preparing CHF4226 alternative to the one disclosed in EP 0147719 with a<br>
simpler methodology, comprising the following steps according to scheme 1:<br>
(a)	reacting a compound of formula (XII) wherein X is an halogen atom<br>
selected from the group consisting of fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine<br>
and R is a hydroxyl-protecting group, with a compound of formula (X')<br>
wherein R' is an amino-protecting group to obtain a compound of formula<br>
(XIII);<br>
(b)	reducing said compound to obtain a compound of formula (XIV)<br>
already bearing the correct (R),(R) configuration;<br>
(c)	deprotecting compound (XIV) thereby obtaining compound (I).<br>
The (R),(R) diastereoselectivity of compound (XIV) is of at least 60%,<br>
preferably of at least 80%, even more preferably of at least 90%, most<br>
preferably of at least 95%.<br>
Preferably, the (R),(R) diastereoselectivity is further increased by<br>
recrystallization of compound (I) and (XIV), more preferably by<br>
recrystallization of compound (XIV).<br>
Preferably, the hydroxyl-protecting group R is a substituted or<br>
unsubstituted phenyl lower alkyl selected from the group consisting of benzyl,<br>
p-methoxybenzyl, 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl,	p- or o-nitrobenzyl,<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl and p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl. Preferably the amino-<br>
protecting group R' is a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl lower alkyl<br>
selected from the group consisting of benzyl, p-methoxybenzyl, p-<br><br>
fluorobenzyl, p-chlorobenzyl, p-bromobenzyl, diphenylmethyl and<br>
naphthylmethyl.<br>
More preferably, R=R' and even more preferably R and R' are benzyl<br>
groups.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the R and R' protecting groups are<br>
simultaneously removed. In a more preferred embodiment the deprotection is<br>
a catalytic debenzylation.<br>
The invention is further directed to compounds (XIII) and (XIV), which<br>
have been obtained as stable intermediates of the reaction described above.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>

comprising the following steps:<br><br>
Scheme 1<br>
(a) reacting a compound of formula (XII) wherein R is a hydroxyl-<br><br>
protecting group, with a compound of formula (X') wherein X is an halogen<br>
atom selected from the group consisting of fluorine, chlorine, bromine and<br>
iodine and R' is an amino-protecting group to obtain a compound of formula<br>
(XIII);<br>
(b)	reducing said compound to obtain a compound of formula (XIV)<br>
already bearing the correct (R),(R) configuration;<br>
(c)	deprotecting compound (XIV) thereby obtaining compound (I).<br>
The (R),(R) diastereoselectivity of compound (XIV) is of at least 60%,<br>
preferably of at least 80%, even more preferably of at least 90%, most<br>
preferably of at least 95%.<br>
Preferably the (R),(R) diastereoselectivity is further increased by<br>
recrystallization of compound (I) and (XIV), more preferably by<br>
recrystallization of compound (XIV) using known methods.<br>
"Protecting group" means a group which protects one or more<br>
functional groups of a compound giving rise to a protected derivative of the<br>
specified compound. Functional groups which may be protected include, by<br>
way of example, amino groups, hydroxyl groups and the like.<br>
Protecting groups are well-known and are described, for example, in T.<br>
W. Greene and G. M. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third<br>
Edition, Wiley, New York, 1999, and references cited therein.<br>
The term "amino-protecting group" means a protecting group suitable<br>
for preventing undesired reactions at an amino group. Representative amino-<br>
protecting groups include, but are not limited to, tert-butoxycarbonyl (BOC),<br>
trityl (Tr), benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (FMOC),<br>
formyl, trimethylsilyl (TMS), tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS), benzyl,<br>
p-methoxybenzyl, p-fluorobenzyl, p-chlorobenzyl, p-bromobenzyl,<br>
diphenylmethyl, naphthylmethyl and the like.<br>
The term "hydroxyl-protecting group" means a protecting group<br><br>
suitable for preventing undesirable reactions at a hydroxyl group.<br>
Representative hydroxyl-protecting groups include, but are not limited to, silyl<br>
groups including tri(1-6C)alkylsilyl groups, such as trimethylsilyl (TMS),<br>
triethylsilyl (TES), tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) and the like; esters (acyl<br>
groups) including (1-6C)alkanoyl groups, such as formyl, acetyl and the like;<br>
arylmethyl groups, such as benzyl (Bn), p-methoxybenzyl (PMB),<br>
9-fluorenylmethyl (Fm), diphenylmethyl (benzhydryl, DPM) and the like.<br>
In the present invention R is preferably a substituted or unsubstituted<br>
phenyl lower alkyl selected from the group consisting of benzyl,<br>
p-methoxybenzyl, 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl, p- or o-nitrobenzyl,<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl and p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl and R' is a substituted<br>
or unsubstituted phenyl lower alkyl selected from the group consisting of<br>
preferably benzyl, p-methoxybenzyl, p-fluorobenzyl, p-chlorobenzyl,<br>
p-bromobenzyl, diphenylmethyl and naphthylmethyl.<br>
More preferably, R=R' and even more preferably R and R' are benzyl<br>
groups.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the R and R' protecting groups are<br>
simultaneously removed. In a more preferred embodiment the deprotection is<br>
a catalytic debenzylation.<br>
In particular, a compound of formula (XII) is reacted with an optically<br>
pure compound of formula (X') to obtain an optically pure intermediate (XIII).<br>
The compound of formula (XII) may be obtained by any known method.<br>
For example it may be obtained from compound of formula (VII) by means of<br>
various halogenation procedures, as described in example 13 of<br>
EP 0147719.<br>
The optically pure compound (X') is obtained by resolution of the<br>
racemic compound with (L)- or (D)-mandelic acid in presence of an alcoholic<br>
solvent such as methanol (MeOH), using a known suitable modification of the<br><br>
method according to Kraft, et al. Reec. Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas 85,607 (1966).<br>
The reaction of (XII) and (X') is performed in a suitable solvent or<br>
solvent mixture such as dichloromethane or its mixture with<br>
dimethylformamide and a suitable alkaline agent such as sodium hydrogen<br>
carbonate.<br>
Compound (XIII) contains both an amino protecting group and a<br>
hydroxyl-protecting group of the type described above.<br>
A stable compound (XIII) may be isolated as a salt, preferably as the<br>
hydrochloride salt.<br>
The reduction of the intermediate (XIII) may be done with a suitable<br>
reducing agent such as lithium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride,<br>
sodium monoacetoxyborohydride, borane complexes, and preferably sodium<br>
borohydride in a solvent such as methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, ether, diglyme, dichloromethane and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably methanol and dichloromethane are used to obtain the compound<br>
of formula (XIV) with the required (R),(R) absolute configuration and good<br>
diastereoselectivity.<br>
Compound of formula (XIV) may be isolated as free base or<br>
alternatively as crystalline salt formed by reaction with a suitable acid, such<br>
as tartaric acid, mandelic acid and preferably hydrochloric acid, using various<br>
solvents, such as methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, water, acetone,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane and mixtures thereof.<br>
The (R),(R) diastereomeric purity of compound (XIV) is of at least 60%,<br>
preferably of at least 80%, even more preferably of at least 90%, most<br>
preferably of at least 95%.<br>
The deprotection of (XIV) to give compound (I) is performed in<br>
presence of a catalyst with a solvent. Preferably, the solvent is methanol,<br>
ethanol, 2-propanol, water, tetrahydrofuran or mixtures thereof and<br><br>
preferably ethanol, at a temperature of 0 to 100°C and more preferably of 10<br>
to 30°C. Preferably, the catalyst is selected from the group of palladium-<br>
BaCO3, palladium black, and even more preferably palladium-charcoal.<br>
Compound (I) is obtained with a (R),(R) diastereoisomeric purity of at<br>
least 60%, preferably of at least 80%, even more preferably of at least 90%,<br>
most preferably of at least 95%.<br>
The (R),(R) diastereoisomeric purity of compound (XIV) may be further<br>
increased by recrystallization or suspension of (XIV) or preferably its salt,<br>
more preferably its hydrochloride salt, in a solvent, such as methanol,<br>
ethanol, 2-propanol, water, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
The (R),(R) diastereoisomeric purity of compound (I) may be also<br>
increased by recrystallization of compound (I), for example by the method<br>
described in WO 2005/089760.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, compound (XIII) contains R'<br>
which is a benzyl group.<br>
This process is advantageous compared to the process described in<br>
EP 0147719 in which the intermediate (V), with the undesired (S,R) absolute<br>
configuration, is early formed and needs later inversion, so lengthening the<br>
process.<br>
The deprotection of the amino group is often a quite slow reaction<br>
which requires particular catalysts or reaction conditions (i.e. unreduced<br>
palladium-charcoal, high temperatures and hydrogen pressure), according to<br>
T. W. Greene and G. M. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third<br>
Edition, Wiley, New York, 1999, and references cited therein. Drastic reaction<br>
conditions could cause overreduction of (I) giving rise to impurities.<br>
In the present invention, the presence in compound (XIV) of a vicinal<br>
hydroxyl group favours the N-deprotection reaction. The reaction is achieved<br><br>
quite sharply and under mild conditions, therefore preventing the formation of<br>
overreduced impurities.<br>
Moreover, in a preferred embodiment, since the N-benzyl moiety of<br>
4-methoxy-α-methyl-N-(benzyl)-benzeneethanamine(L)-(+)-mandelate	is<br>
maintained during the synthesis, the final catalytic hydrogenation step allows<br>
to simultaneously deprotect both the amino and hydroxyl groups, leading to<br>
compound (I).<br>
According to the most preferred embodiment, R=R'=benzyl and R and<br>
R' are removed simultaneously through a debenzylation reaction.<br>
The invention will be hereinafter illustrated in greater detail in the<br>
following examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Synthesis	of	5-[[[(1R)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]-<br>
(phenylmethyl)amino]acetyl]-8-(phenylmethoxy)-(1H)-quinolin-2-one<br>
hydrochloride (XIII), wherein R and R'= benzyl<br>
5-(alpha-Bromo)acetyl-8-benzyloxy-2(1H)-quinolinone (XII) (20 g,<br>
0.053 mol) and (R)-4-methoxy-α-methyl-N-(benzyl)-benzeneethanamine (X')<br>
(20.6g, 0.08 mol) are suspended in dichloromethane (250 ml) and<br>
dimethylformamide (50 ml). Sodium hydrogencarbonate (17 g) is added and<br>
the mixture is refluxed overnight. Inorganic salts are filtered, then the solution<br>
is concentrated, diluted with chloroform (800 ml) and washed with aqueous<br>
hydrogen chloride ca. 10% w/w (2*250 ml). The organic phase is washed<br>
with brine (300 ml), dried (Na2SO4), filtered and concentrated in a rotary<br>
evaporator. The oily residue is added with acetone (100 ml) and stirred at<br>
T=5°C: excess (R)-4-methoxy-α-methyl-N-(benzyl)-benzeneethanamine, as<br>
hydrochloride salt, crystallized from the mixture and is filtered, washing with<br>
acetone. The filtered solution is concentrated and the residue is suspended<br>
in ethyl acetate, filtered and dried, giving (XIII) (28.0 g, 91% yield) as<br><br>
hydrochloride salt.<br>
(XIII) monohydrochloride (8,8 g) is suspended in ethyl acetate (160 ml)<br>
and heated to 78-80°C; to the refluxing mixture ethanol (50 ml) is slowly<br>
added till dissolution is complete. The solution is cooled to 5°C and kept cold<br>
for 60 hrs: the crystallized product is filtered, washed with ethyl acetate<br>
(50 ml) and petroleum ether (50 ml), then it is dried under vacuum at T=50°C.<br>
Crystallized (XIII) monohydrochloride is recovered as a pale yellow powder.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Synthesis of [5-[(1R)-1-hydroxy-2-[[(1R)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-<br>
methylethyl](phenylmethyl)amino]ethyl]-8-phenylmethoxy)-2(1H)-quinolinone]<br>
(XIV), wherein R and R'= benzyl<br>
(XIII) Monohydrochloride (5.0 g, 8,6 mmol) is dissolved in a mixture of<br>
dichloromethane (100 ml) and methanol (50 ml), then the solution is cooled<br>
to T= - 60°C. Sodium borohydride (2.0g, 52 mmol) is added portionwise<br>
under nitrogen atmosphere while keeping T
for 30 min, then T is raised to -10°C and water (500 ml) is added keeping<br>
T
chloroform (100 ml), the organic phases are mixed and washed with aqueous<br>
hydrogen chloride ca. 10% w/w (500 ml), then dried (Na2SO4), filtered and<br>
concentrated in a rotary evaporator. To the residual solution (ca. 30 ml) ethyl<br>
acetate (100 ml) is added and the solution is concentrated again, then ethyl<br>
acetate (50 ml) is added causing crystallization of crude (XIV) as<br>
hydrochloride salt. The suspension is kept cold (T=5°C) overnight, then it is<br>
filtered and the solid is dried under vacuum at T=50°C (4,3 g, 86% yield). The<br>
diastereoisomeric purity (R),(R)/[(R),(R)+(S),(R)] is determined as 90%.<br>
2 g of crude (XlV)monohydrochloride are suspended in acetone<br>
(80 ml) and heated to T=58-80°C, water (16 ml) is added till dissolution was<br>
complete. The solution is cooled to 5°C and kept cold overnight; the<br><br>
crystallized (XIV) monohydrochloride is filtered and dried under vacuum at<br>
T=50°C. Crystallized (XIV) is recovered as a white solid. The<br>
diastereoisomeric purity is determined as 99%.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Synthesis of 8-hydroxy-5-[(1R)-1-hydroxy-2-{[(1R)-2(4-methoxy-<br>
phenyl)-1-methylethyl]amino}ethyl]-2(1H)-quinolinone hydrochloride (I),<br>
wherein R and R'= benzyl<br>
[5-[(1 R)-1 -Hydroxy-2-[[(1 R)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1 -methylethyl]-<br>
(phenylmethyl)-amino]ethyl]-8-phenylmethoxy)-2(1H)-quinolinone<br>
hydrochloride (XIV) (600 mg, 1.0 mmol) is suspended in ethanol (10 ml) and<br>
water (0.5 ml) in a Parr flask. Pd/C5% (100 mg, 50% wet) is added and the<br>
mixture is hydrogenated at T=20°C for 1,5 hr. The mixture is filtered through<br>
a celite pad, washing with ethanol (10 ml), the filtered solution is<br>
concentrated in a rotary evaporator, in the warm (T=40°C) residual solution<br>
(ca. 5 ml) di-isopropylether (5 ml) is slowly dropped in, causing precipitation<br>
of (I), which is filtered and dried under vacuum at T=50°C. (I) is recovered as<br>
a white powder.<br><br>
