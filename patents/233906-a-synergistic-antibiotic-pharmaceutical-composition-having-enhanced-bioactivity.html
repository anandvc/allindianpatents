				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to a synergistic antibiotic pharmaceutical composition having enhanced bioactivity. The present invention has direct implication in reducing the dosage of antibiotics while increasing the efficiency of absorption of nutritional elements. The present invention also provides a method of treatment for bacterial infections.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The consumption of antibiotics and drugs by man is increasing at an alarming rate. Out of the total drugs and chemicals, 20%-50% of that use is unnecessary depending on the class of antibiotic. In addition, indiscriminate use of antibiotics promotes antibiotic resistance leading to multiple drug resistance and makes it difficult to control the diseases. Really speaking, the infected individuals consume much more amount of antibiotics in the given dosage that is actually required to control a given population of parasite in the body. This may be due to (i) reduced absorption in the gut membrane when taken orally (ii) restrictive uptake by the target microbe or (iii) operation of efflux pump leading to indiscriminate extrusion of the antibiotics or therapeutic molecules.   So the major amount of the drugs we apply are wasted and only a minor percentage is being targeted to the infective microbes. In addition, the unutilized drug / antibiotic amount remains as a load in the body and environment acting as a selection pressure facilitating emergence of drug resistance in parasites and their predominance, ultimately leading to failure of antibiotics against resistant infections. This also is responsible for side effects, illness and reduction in life expectancy. One of the ways, which has been feasible to reduce drug dosage, has been synergism between two therapeutic agents. However, if both have the antibiotic property, still the problem of continued selection pressure on microbes is likely to continue. So, we thought of searching only those molecules, which by them are not microbicidal but when present with a drug or active molecule, enhance its activity and availability (bioenhancers). This way these molecules by their presence will not exert any selection pressure for mutants to emerge resistant against them and on the other hand could reduce the dosage of antibiotics or drugs so that their ill effects are minimized and the resistance development process will be substantially      delayed<br>
already available. The seeds of Ipomoea muricata are commonly known as 'Kaladana' in trade and are being used as purgative in Pakistan and India. The seeds are a good source of clavine alkaloids. The seeds are reported to contain 0.49% of total alkaloid, out of which lysergol constitutes 53% and chanoclavine 37%. Lysergol is used as hypotensive, psychotrophic, analgesic, immunostimulant, analeptic and uterus and intestine stimulating drug. Also, the compound is available commercially (Sigma Chemicals, USA).<br>
The compound lysergol is chemically known as 9,10-Didehydro-6-methylergoline-8-□-methanol.<br>
Ergotamine and all compounds either structurally and/or pharmacologically similar to it like lysergol are 5HT agonist vasoactive agents (United States Patent 6,077,539) that means ensure normal blood flow in blood vessels in a therapeutically effective amount. This compound also is reportedly psychoactive causing nausea, which may be experienced during first hour. This compound also has hallucination and anti-tension properties.<br>
Great emphasis now is being laid towards quality assurance of crude drugs from plants sources widely used in the Indian system of medicine. The scientific study of traditional medicines, derivation of drugs through bioprospection and systematic conservation, domestication and cultivation of the concerned medicinal plants has assumed great importance in the present day context when more and more people prefer safe and effective medicines at affordable price for curing their ailments. The present invention enlarges the scope and use of the natural plant compound lysergol in therapeutical applications. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Main  object  of the   present   invention   is   to   provide   a  synergistic   antibiotic pharmaceutical composition having enhanced bioactivity.<br>
Another object  of the present  invention  is to  provide a synergistic antibiotic pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of bacterial infections. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an antibiotic pharmaceutical composition having reduced concentration of antibiotic compounds. Further object of the present invention is to provide an antibiotic pharmaceutical composition to prevent antibiotic drug resistance.<br>

The invention is further explained in the form of following embodiments.<br>
1. Assay for bio-enhancement of anti-infective agents<br>
(a) The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotic is determined<br>
against Escherichia coli (ATCC 10536), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6051)<br>
and Mycobacterium smegmatis (ATCC 14468) in broth and disc diffusion<br>
assay.<br>
(b) The antibiotics at concentrations 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and equal to MIC are added<br>
alone and in combination with the test compound at varying<br>
concentrations on disc and in broth to evaluate the comparative inhibition.<br>
(c) These combinations showing significant advantage or higher activity than<br>
antibiotic alone in terms of enhanced inhibition of bacterial growth (large<br>
inhibition zone in disc diffusion and effectivity of lower concentration in<br>
broth assay) are picked up for future testing.<br>
(d) In broth assay the activity is quantified by counting number of viable cells<br>
in a given treatment and converted in fold enhancement by combination<br>
compared to antibiotic / drug alone in the killing percentage of cells.<br>
(e) The pretreatment assay followed to determine whether the compound is<br>
required along with antibiotic to enhance its activity or even its<br>
withdrawal after treatment or prior to antibiotic treatment would benefit.<br>
For this, the cells are treated with compound for 4 to 8 hours and then<br>
washed free of it by centrifugation and washing in sterile water. This is<br>
followed by treatment with antibiotic as in steps b to d.<br>
Process for the isolation of lysergol.<br>
The seeds of Ipomoea muricata are powdered and defatted with hexane and then<br>
extracted with methyl alcohol. The alcoholic extract is dried and extracted with 5-<br>
10% Hcl solution. The acidic extract is then converted to basified upto pH 9.0 and<br>
extracted with chloroform and butanol successively. The crude alkaloid obtained in<br>
chloroform and butanol extract is further purified by column chromatography to yield<br>
lysergol in maximum yield upto 0.2%.<br>
Bioactivity is experimented with the killing activities of different antibiotics against<br>
the bacteria singly and in combination with the test compound Lysergol following the<br>
method described above. These experiments are being described in the following<br>
examples. When the bacteria are grown in presence of the compound as such no<br>
significant killing is observed. In all the experiments the Lysergol concentration is<br>
kept at 10 ng/ml, unless it is specifically mentioned.<br>
The invention is further explained in the form of examples. However, these examples<br>
should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Lysergol mediated enhancement in the killing action of antibiotics against Gram<br>
negative bacterium Escherichia coli.<br>
Example 2.<br>
Lysergol mediated enhancement in the killing action of antibiotics against Gram<br>
positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis.<br>
It is calculated as = Survival fraction of viable cells upon treatment with antibiotic<br>
and lysergol in combination / Survival fraction of viable cells upon treatment with<br>
antibiotic alone<br>
Example 3<br>
Lysergol mediated enhancement in the killing action of antibiotics against bacterium<br>
Mycobacterium smegmatis<br>
It is calculated as = Survival fraction of viable cells upon treatment with antibiotic<br>
and lysergol in combination / Survival fraction of viable cells upon treatment with<br>
antibiotic alone<br>
From the above experiments it is deduced that the potency of the antibiotic is<br>
increased against both Gram positive and negative bacteria when applied along with<br>
the compound lysergol.<br>
Example 4<br>
Lysergol mediated enhancement in the killing action of antibiotic against bacteria in<br>
disc diffusion assays.<br>
In other observations the compound lysergol enhances the transport of antibiotics e.g.<br>
Rifampicin, Tetracycline across the gut as well as artificial membrane. We performed<br>
the experiments in U-shaped tubes with joint in between, where the freshly isolated<br>
gut membrane is fixed. In control tube only antibiotic solution (4ml @ Img/ml<br>
solution) is poured in the left arm where as in the right arm only water is poured. In<br>
the other tube in addition to the antibiotic solution lysergol (4ug @ lug/ml) is added.<br>
Then changes in absorbency in the right arm of both the tubes are noted at 340nm (for<br>
rifampicin) and 223nm (for tetracycline). The enhancement in transport is<br>
approximately 2.96 to 8.53 folds. This in-turn has immense importance for absorption<br>
of the drugs, Pharmaceuticals, nutraceutical and other related compounds and ions by<br>
the cells.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
1. The main advantage of the present invention is the reduction of antibiotic dosage<br>
by means of synergistic composition.<br>
2. Reduction in antibiotic dosage resulting in prevention of antibiotic drug<br>
resistance.<br>
3. Incorporation of bioactive enhancer in the antibiotic composition, which non-toxic<br>
to animals and humans.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
