				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a treating agent for a sheet surface and a process for preparing a paper for ink jet printing.<br><br>
2. Background Art<br>
Ink jet printing is a non-contact printing method that offers numerous advantages including high-speed printing, printing at low noise levels, ease of performing color printing, or the like, and consequently has been rapidly popularized for use in printers and plotters.  Ink jet printing allows printing on ordinary printing,paper, coated paper, paper for plain paper* copy (PPC paper), medium-quality paper and even plastic film.<br>
As a paper for use in ink jet printing, there is a coated paper for obtaining a high image quality, which has a coating layer containing synthetic silica.  In contrast, as common-use paper, one obtained by penetrate-treating paper with starch or the like by means of a size press is used.  Common-use paper' has the major problem of the occurrence of so-called feathering when it is printed with an aqueous ink, which is used in the ink jet printing.<br>
Since the ink used for the ink jet printing is both aqueous and anionic, a cationic waterproofing agent is applied to the surface of the paper.  Although it is effective to coat or penetrate-treating paper with a cationic polymer to improve water resistance, this results in the occurrence of the problem of decreased color density during printing.<br>
Various methods have been proposed to inhibit this decrease in color density, examples of which include a method wherein nonionic resin fine particles are-combined with nonionic, anionic or cationic water-soluble polymer and coated (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 9-1925), a method wherein emulsion particles are coated which are synthesized by<br>
- 1A -<br><br>
copolymerization of acrylonitrile and acrylic esters to increase printing density (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 8-50366), a method wherein cationic emulsion particles of acrylic esters are coated (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 9-99632), and a method wherein colloidal silica and a water-soluble polymer are coated for the purpose of improving dye color development and printing density (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 9-109544).<br>
However, since all of these methods use   <br>
water-insoluble fine particles, they bond weakly with the ink dye for ink jet printing, and the water-soluble cationic polymer that is used in combination with them does not demonstrate   adequate water resistance.<br>
In addition, the use of a mixture of polymer having vinyl alcohol units such as polyvinyl alcohol and a cationic polymer for ink jet printing paper is known.  Polyvinyl alcohol has a good film-forming ability, and has the effect of inhibiting decreases in color density.  On the other hand, cationic polymers have the effect of increasing water resistance.<br>
However, polyvinyl alcohol and cationic polymer have poor miscibility, and it is difficult to apply their mixture uniformly in the microscopic state.  Consequently, these substances have shortcomings that include large decreases in color density, thereby requiring further improvement.<br>
The use of a copolymer comprising a polymer moiety having vinyl alcohol units and a polymer moiety having cationic monomer units for ink jet printing paper as in the present invention has heretofore been unknown.<br>
Moreover, due to the considerable thickening that occurs when a conventional cationic polymer is mixed into a coating color, it is necessary to dilute with water at the time of application.  Thus, the polymer concentration is unable to be increased, and the coated amount of the polymer ends up being low, which had previously presented a problem.  A surface treating agent that is able to effectively solve the problems of decreased quality, namely decreased color density, feathering and inadequate water resistance as mentioned above has yet to be developed.  In addition, the light resistance of printed ink<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
images or characters is also inadequate. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a treating agent for a sheet surface that improves water resistance and light resistance without decreasing color density during printing when printing with an aqueous ink, for example, one used in ink jet printing.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a treating agent for a sheet surface that prevents the problem of feathering that occurs with common use paper for ink jet printing.    <br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a treating agent  for a sheet surface that prevents the occurrence of the considerable thickening when mixed with coating colors and can be applied in an adequate polymer concentration.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to provide a coated paper for ink jet printing that improves water resistance and light resistance without decreasing color density during printing.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to provide a common-use paper for ink jet printing that prevents feathering without decreasing color density during printing, and improves water resistance and light resistance.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for preparing a treating agent for a sheet surface comprising a step of a graft copolymerization to obtain as said treating agent for a sheet surface, a water-soluble or water-dispersible graft copolymer composed of a polymer moiety having vinyl alcohol units and polymer moiety having cationic groups as a back bone and a branch polymer moiety by graft copolymerizing a polymer having vinyl alcohol units with a monomer having a cationic group and/or a polymer having cationic groups with vinyl ester of carboxylic acid, wherein a formula weight ratio of the vinyl alcohol units of said water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer having vinyl alcohol units and the cationic groups is from 1:20 to 2:1.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is described in detail<br>
hereinafter.<br><br>
The treating agent for a sheet surface according to the present invention comprises a copolymer comprising a polymer moiety having vinyl alcohol units and a polymer moiety having cationic groups.  Examples of such a copolymer include a block copolymer, a graft copolymer or the like.<br>
Especially, a graft copolymer in which the polymer moieties are a back bone polymer and branch polymers, either the back bone polymer or branch polymer is a polymer having vinyl alcohol units, and the other is a polymer having cationic groups, may be preferably used for the treating agent for a sheet surface according to the present invention.  Particularly, a graft copolymer having vinyl alcohol units for its back bone polymer may be preferably used.  The graft copolymer of the present invention can be obtained by grafting monomers having a structure necessary on a water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer having vinyl alcohol units or by following hydrolysis.<br>
The water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer<br>
containing vinyl alcohol units that serves as the raw material of the present invention may be preferably obtained by alkaline hydrolysis of a homopolymer of vinyl ester of carboxylic acid, or a copolymer of a vinyl ester of carboxylic acid with copolymerizable monomers.  Since polyvinyl alcohol, a hydrolysis product of polyvinyl acetate, is widely used in practical terms, polyvinyl alcohol that is a hydrolysis product of polyvinyl acetate may be most preferably used in the present invention as well.<br>
- 7 -<br><br>
Examples of vinyl esters of carboxylic acids include vinyl formate, vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl butyrate and vinyl benzoate.<br>
In addition, typical examples of the above-mentioned copolymerizable monomers include nonionic, cationic or anionic monomers such as ethylene, styrene, salts or quaternary compounds of dimethylaminopropyl(meth)acrylamide, salts or quaternary compounds of diallylamine, N-vinylformamide, N-vinylacetamide, vinylsulfonate,<br>
acrylamido-2-methyl-propanesulfonate, (meth)acrylic acid, itaconic acid, dimethylacrylamide and N-isopropylacrylamide.<br>
Vinyl alcohol units are typically formed within the<br>
polymer by alkaline hydrolysis of a homopolymer or copolymer of<br>
these monomers.	<br>
In the present invention, the vinyl alcohol units in the water-soluble pr water-dispersible polymer having vinyls alcohol units are preferably 70-100 mol%, more preferably 85-100 mol%, and are considered to become the back bone polymer of the graft copolymer.  In the case the vinyl alcohol units are outside this range, the grafting rate decreases, thereby preventing the object of the present invention from being achieved.<br>
The degree of polymerization of the water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer having vinyl alcohol units such as polyvinyl alcohol is preferably 100 to 2500/ and more preferably 300 to 2000, and a polymer having an arbitrary degree, of polymerization can be used according to the objective.<br>
It is preferable that the branch polymers of the graft copolymer contain cationic repeating units represented by the above-mentioned formula (1), formula (2), formula (3), or formula (4).  These repeating units may be present in the branch polymers either alone or a plurality, of kinds thereof simultaneously.<br>
In the treating agent for a sheet surface of the present invention, a graft copolymer composed of a polymer I moiety having vinyl alcohol units and a polymer moiety having cationic groups can be realized by polymerizing cationic monomer composition generating the repeating units represented by the above-mentioned formula (1) and/or formula (2) in the presence<br>
- 8 -<br><br>
of the water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer having vinyl alcohol units that serves as the back bone polymer.<br>
In addition, a monomer composition comprising a monomer generating the repeating unit represented by the above mentioned formula (1) and monomers generating the repeating units represented by the above mentioned formulas (3) and/or (4) can be used as a monomer composition in the present invention. By forming the branch polymer of these monomers followed by alkali or acid hydrolyzing it, a graft copolymer of the present invention can be obtained, which is introduced with the repeating units represented by the above mentioned formulas (1) and (3) and/or (4).<br>
A graft copolymer having as its branch polymers<br>
cationic repeating units represented by the above-mentioned   formulas (3) or (4) can be obtained by graft copolymerizing N-vinylcarboxylic -acid amide monomer or a monomer composition of N-vinylcarboxylic acid amide monomer and acrylonitrile instead of the cationic repeating units represented by the formula (1) or formula (2) to the above-mentioned water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer having vinyl alcohol units, followed by hydrolysis thereof.<br>
In this system, however, three types of polymers present in the form of a mixture, namely cationic polymer that have not been graft polymerized, the above-mentioned ungrafted polymers having vinyl alcohol units, and the formed ,graft copolymer.  The present invention effectively demonstrates prevention of feathering and improvement of water resistance even this mixture is used as a treating agent for a sheet   surface.<br>
The graft copolymer demonstrates good effects as a treating agent for a sheet surface even if it is not isolated, but rather in the state of a mixture with the polymers.  Thus, in this case, a complex isolation process is not required thereby further enhancing the practical value of the present invention with respect to decreased production cost and so forth.<br>
The treating agent for a sheet surface of the present invention can be prepared by radical polymerizing di(meth)allylamine-based monomers generating the repeating unit<br><br>
 -9 -<br><br>
represented by the above-mentioned formula (1) and/or (meth)acrylic cationic monomers generating the repeating unit represented by the above-mentioned formula (2) after dissolving or dispersing water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer having vinyl alcohol units in an aqueous medium.<br>
Examples of di(meth)allylamine-based monomers<br>
generating the repeating unit represented by the above-mentioned<br>
formula (1) referred to here include salts of      <br>
di(meth)allylamine, salts or quaternary compounds of<br>
di(meth)allylmonoalkylamines, and salts or quaternary compounds <br>
of di(meth)allylbenzylamines.  Examples of salts referred to<br>
here include hydrochlorides, sulfates and acetates.  Examples of<br>
quaternary ammonium compounds include quaternary compounds with<br>
methylhalides or benzylhalides.	<br>
Preferred examples include hydrochlorides, sulfates, acetates and quaternary compounds from diallylamines/    diallylmonomethylamines, or diallylbenzylamines with methylhalides.<br>
Specific examples of these compounds include monomethylbenzyldiallylammonium chloride,<br>
dimethyldiallylammonium chloride, diallylamine hydrochloride, diallylamine sulfate and diallylamine acetate, while dimethyldiallylammonium chloride is particularly preferable.<br>
In addition, specific examples of (meth)acrylic<br>
cationic monomers generating the repeating unit represented by the above-mentioned formula,(2) referred to here include salts-or quaternary compounds of dialkylaminoethyl(meth)acrylate and salts or quaternary compounds of<br>
dialkylaminopropyl(meth)acrylamides.  Examples of salts referred to here include hydrochlorides, sulfates and acetates.  Examples of quaternary ammonium compounds include quaternary compounds with methylhalides and benzylhalides.<br>
Specific examples of these compounds that are<br>
particularly preferable include quaternary ammonium salts such as (meth)acryloyloxyethyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride, (meth)acryloyloxyethyltrimethylammonium chloride, (meth)acryloylaminopropyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride and (meth)acryloylaminopropyltrimethylammonium chloride, while dimethylaminoethyl(meth)acrylate salts, such as hydrochlorides,<br>
- 10 -<br><br>
sulfates and acetates, as well as<br>
dimethylaminopropyl(meth)acrylamide salts, such as hydrochlorides, sulfates and acetates, can be used preferably.<br>
Furthermore, the repeating units represented by these formulas (1) and/or (2) may be introduced fromialone or a mixture of a plurality of kinds of monomers.<br>
Together with the above-mentioned cationic monomers, nonionic (meth)acrylic monomers, anionic (meth)acrylic monomers or various types of vinyl monomers can also be copolymerized.<br>
In addition, cationic repeating units represented by the above-mentioned formula (3) can be introduced by graft copolymerizing N-vinylcarboxylic acid amide to water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer having vinyl alcohol units using a similar preparative method followed by hydrolysis thereof.  On the other hand, cationic repeating units represented by the  above-mentioned formula (4) can also be introduced by graft copolymerizing N-vinylcarboxylic acid amide and acrylonitrile to water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer having vinyl alcohol units using a similar preparative method followed by hydrolysis thereof.  N-vinylacetamide or N-vinylformamide can be used for the N-vinylcarboxylic acid amide.  Further, in the above graft copolymerization, the monomer generating the repeating unit represented by the above mentioned formula (1) can be graft copolymerized because of its hydrolysis resistance.<br>
The grafting rate of graft copolymers can be analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance or infrared spectroscopy.  In addition, the weight ratio of methanol insoluble matter to the charged amount of raw material polymer can be used as an indicator of the grafting rate of the back bone polymer by utilizing the property in which the solubility in methanol of the back bone polymer increases as a result of grafting.<br>
Namely, as grafting proceeds, the raw material polymer that has become highly cationic also becomes soluble, in methanol and is filtered out.  The weakly cationic grafted polymer becomes insoluble in methanol and is measured.  Thus, the difference between the charged amount of raw material polymer and the amount of insoluble matter is,the amount of grafted polymer that has become highly cationic, and is considered to indicate the minimum value of the grafting rate of the raw<br>
- 11 -<br><br>
material polymer.<br>
More specifically, 10 times weight of methanol is added to a polymer aqueous solution in which the concentratxon of polymer mixture after performing the polymerization procedure of the present invention (concentration calculated from the sum of the amount of polymer such as polyvinyl alcohol charged as raw material and the amount of charged monomers for graft copolymerization) is 20 wt%.  The formed precipitate is filtered with No. 5B filter paper and dried to a constant weight at 105°C to determine the amount of insoluble matter.  The weight ratio is then determined between this amount of insoluble matter and the amount of charged polymer (such as polyvinyl alcohol).<br>
In the present invention, it is preferable that the<br>
amount of insoluble matter be 60 wt% or less.	<br>
Namely, it is preferable that at least 40% of back  <br>
bone_polymer charged as raw material be grafted.	<br>
Since homopolymers of cationic monomers are also soluble in methanol, this assay method is only valid as an indicator of grafting rate of the back bone polymer.<br>
If, a method is developed for determining the grafting rate of the cationic monomers as well, it would be possible to more specifically stipulate the desirable composition of graft copolymer, the findings of the inventors of the present invention only apply to the grafting ratio of the back bone polymer.<br>
The formula weight ratio of the vinyl alcohol units of water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer having vinyl alcohol units serving as raw material in the present invention and the above-mentioned cationic groups is selected from the range of 1:20 to 2:1.  This range is preferably 1:20. to 1:1, and most preferably 1:20 to 1:2.  Graft copolymer produced within this range is particularly preferable as a treating agent for a sheet surface.<br>
If the amount of water-soluble, or water-dispersible polymer having vinyl alcohol units is less than 4.7 formula wt%, the effect on'color density is too large, making it unsuitable for use as a treating,agent for a sheet surface.  If the amount of the above-mentioned cationic groups is less than 33 formula wt%, it is not practical as a result of low water resistance.<br>
- 12 -<br><br>
Graft copolymerization is carried out in a monomer solution in the presence of water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer having vinyl alcohol units in an aqueous medium. Although water alone is preferably used as the aqueous medium, organic solvents that mix uniformly with water, such as dimethylsulfoxide, ethanol and N-methylpyrrolidone, may also be mixed with water.<br>
For the polymerization method, the entire amount of monomer is charged into a polymerization vessel in the presence of water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer having vinyl     <br><br>
alcohol units followed by initiation of polymerization, or a  <br>
portion of the monomer is charged into the polymerization     <br>
vessel, and remaining monomer is then charged according to the<br>
progress of polymerization after initiating polymerization.<br>
Either method may be suitably employed.	<br>
The water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer having vinyl alcohol units to serve as the back bone polymer is* present in the polymerization system in the dissolved or dispersed state at a concentration of 2 to 25 wt%, while monomer to be grafted is present in the polymerization system at a monomer concentration of 5 -to 60 wt%.  Cationic monomer is then graft copolymerized to the back bone polymer by solution polymerization, reverse phase emulsion polymerization, reverse phase suspension polymerization and so forth, and particularly preferably by aqueous solution polymerization.<br>
In addition, a graft copolymer can be obtained and used in a similar application having a polymer structure having cationic groups for the back bone polymer, and a polymer structure having vinyl alcohol units for the branch polymers, by graft copolymerizing a vinyl ester of carboxylic acid such as vinylacetate for composing the branch polymers with a (co)polymer containing N-vinylcarboxylic acid amide and/or hydrolysis product of the (co)polymer as back bone polymer, followed by hydrolysis thereof.<br>
The graft copolymerization of the present invention can be performed by polymerizing under the above-mentioned conditions using an ordinary radical generator.<br>
Examples of ordinary radical generators that are used <br>
preferably include azo-based initiators such as	<br>
- 13 -<br><br>
2-2'-azobis-2-amidinopropane•2 hydrochloride, sodium<br>
4,4'-azobis-4-cyanovalerate and<br>
2,2'-azobis-N,N'-dimethyleneisobutylamidine•2 hydrochloride.<br>
In addition, in place of the use of these azo-based initiators,^oxidizing initiators such as tetravalent cerium compounds or redox-type initiators in the manner of a combination of ammonium persulfate and sodium hydrogen sulfite can be either used in combination or alone.<br>
The amount of polymerization initiator used is normally about 100 to 10,000 ppm relative to the amount of monomers.<br>
If there is necessity to adjust molecular weight of polymer, it is performed by using a general chain transfer agent such as alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol,or sulfur-containing compounds such as 2-mercaptoethanol.  The   amount used thereof is 0.1 to 200 wt% relative to the amount,of monomers in the case of alcohols, and 0.01 to 10 wt% relative to the amount of monomers in the case of 2-mercaptoethanol.<br>
The polymerization reaction is typically carried out at a temperature of 10°C to l00°C, and preferably 30°C to 80°C, and within a pH range of 1.0 to 6.0, and particularly preferably pH 2.0 to 5.0 after removing oxygen gas from the system.  If the polymerization reaction is carried out at a pH outside the above range, grafting reaction does not proceed thereby preventing the object of the present invention from being achieved.<br>
The polymer mixture obtained by the graft<br>
copolymerization having an intrinsic viscosity at 25°C in 2 % ammonium sulfate aqueous solution of 0_. 1 to 2.0 dl/g is preferable as a treating agent for a sheet surface, while that having an intrinsic viscosity of 0.2 to 0.5 dl/g is particularly preferable.  If the viscosity is outside the above range, it does not fall within the suitable viscosity range during treating, thereby preventing the obtaining of good treating.<br>
Examples of sheets to be treated with the treating agent for a sheet surface of the present invention include pulp sheet such as high-quality paper, medium-quality paper, paper board, synthetic paper and plastic sheet.  It is also applicable to a composite sheet comprising paper and synthetic paper, or the like.<br>
- 14 -<br><br>
The treating agent for a sheet surface according to the present invention can be applied in other printing method using a similar aqueous ink like the ink jet printing.<br>
The amount in the case of treating a paper surface with the treating agent of the present invention should be determined by taking into consideration the required properties. In general, the applied polymer content of the treating agent is within the range of 0.02 to 5 g/m2.  In the case of coated paper, the paper for ink jet printing according to the present invention can be produced by preparing a coating color composed of fillers, binders and the treating agent of the present invention and coating a sheet surface with the coating color. In the case of common-use paper, the paper for ink jet printing according to the present invention can be produced by penetrate treating a sheet surface with the treating agent of the present invention alone or in combination with oxidized starsh, polyvinyl alcohol or surface sizing agent and so forth.<br>
The treating agent for a sheet surface according to the present invention can be used in combination with other coating agents, examples of which include ink charge neutralizing substances such as cationic surface active agents, polycondensed aluminum ions and polycondensed cationic polymers, water-soluble polymers and latex such as oxidized starch, cationic starch, modified starch and polyvinyl alcohol, and coating pigments or fillers for ink jet printing such as fine synthetic silica, alumina, talc, kaolin clay and calcium carbonate.<br>
The paper for ink jet printing according to the present invention can be obtained by treating a sheet surface with the treating agent for a sheet surface according to the present invention alone or a treating solution of the, mixture of the treating agent of 'the present inventipn with other coating agents by use of a size press, a gate roll coater or a blade coater and so forth.        <br>
The treating agent for a sheet surface of the present invention can be obtained that is pomposed of a graft copolymer comprising a back bone polymer (main chain) and branch polymers (side chains), with one having a polymer structure having vinyl alcohol units, while the other has a polymer structure having<br>
- 15 -<br><br>
cationic groups.  Polyvinyl alcohol and cationic polymer have a<br>
low level of miscibility with each other.  On the other hand,<br>
the roles of both differ when used as a treating agent for an<br>
ink jet printing paper.  The cationic polymer increases water<br>
resistance, while the polyvinyl alcohol demonstrates the effect<br>
of preventing a decrease in color density.  Although both<br>
components cannot be coated onto a paper surface as a uniform<br>
phase when in the form of a simple mixture, in the presence of<br>
the graft copolymer of the present invention, since the graft:<br>
copolymer itself is a uniform phase, it imprpves the miscibility<br>
of the polyvinyl alcohol and cationic polymer, thereby enabling<br>
various types of polymers to be applied to a paper surface in a<br>
uniform state.	<br>
Moreover, the treating agent for a sheet surface of the present invention is recognized to have an effect that prevents increases in viscosity  of a coating color during  <br><br>
miking thereby contributing to performance by allowing a large amount of polymer to be coated onto the paper.  The effect of preventing increases in viscosity of a coating color is also surmised to be the result of improved miscibility between the polyvinyl alcohol and cationic polymer components.  In this manner, as a result of having the characteristic of allowing<br>
i-	'	r	'<br>
uniform coating of a large amount of polymer, the paper for ink jet printing coated with the present graft copolymer can be giyen desirable properties.<br>
EMBODIMENTS<br>
Although the following provides a detailed explanation of the present invention according to its embodiments, the present invention is not limited to the following embodiments provided its gist is not exceeded. [Synthesis Example-1]<br>
52.2 g of a 23.2% aqueous solution of polyvinyl<br>
alcohol (abbreviated as PVA) (trade name: PVA205, saponification index: 88%, degree of polymerization: 500, manufactured by Kurare Co.), 166 g of dirnethyldiallylammonium chloride (DADMAC, concentration 65%, manufactured by Daiso Co.) (abbreviated as DDMC) and 44.6 g of deionized water were added to a 500 ml four-neck flask equipped with a thermometer, stirrer, nitrogen<br>
- 16-<br><br>
feed tube and condenser, after which the pH of the raw material mixed liquid was adjusted to 3.5 with 2.4 g of 10% aqueous sulfuric acid, and the monomer concentration was adjusted to 40.8%.<br>
Nitrogen replacement was performed for 30 minutes while stirring the raw material mixture and maintaining the temperature at 60°C.  After then, 5.4 g (0.5% per monomer) of a 10% aqueous solution of polymerization initiator V-50 (2,2'-azobis-amidinopropane dihydrochloride: manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries Co.).were added to start polymerization.<br>
After maintaining the temperature at-60°C.for 4 hours, 0.2 wt% per monomer of V-50 polymerization initiator was further added, and the reaction continued for 8 hours after its  initiation.  After cooling, 130 g of deionized water were added<br>
to being the total amount to 400 g and obtain a uniform reaction<br>
product.  The polymer concentration as determined from the total<br>
of PVA and DDMC was 30%.  This polymer mixtuxe was designated as Sample-1.<br>
The cation equivalent value of the Sample-1 (pure polymer content) was measured by colloidal titration.  At this time, the formula weight ratio of hydroxyl groups as determined from the saponification index of PVA and cation groups as determined by colloidal titration was 26:74.<br>
In addition, the intrinsic viscosity of the, Sample-1 at 25°C in 2% ammonium sulfate aqueous solution was measured.<br>
In addition, after removing 3.6 g of a 20% solution thereof, 36.0 g of methanol were added to form precipitate.  The insoluble precipitate that formed at this" time was filtered with No. 5B filter paper.  After drying it for 1 hour at 100°C, the dried precipitate was weighed to calculate the weight ratio (% insoluble matter) of methanol-insoluble matter relative to the polyvinyl alcohol charged as raw material.<br>
Polymer properties are shown in Table 1.<br>

[Synthesis Examples-3, 4]<br>
The same polymerization procedure as the Synthesis Example-1 was performed except for using PVA105 (saponification index; 98%, degree of polymerization: 500, manufactured by Kurare Co.) as PVA and using the charged amounts of PVA105 and DDMC shown in Table 1 to obtain Samples-3 and 4.<br>
The properties of these polymers are shown in Table 1. [Comparative Synthesis Example-1]<br>
Polymerization of DDMC was performed according to the<br>
same procedure as the Synthesis Example-1 without adding PVA to<br>
obtain polydimethyldiallylammonium chloride (P-DDMC), and a<br>
polymer mixture obtained by mixing an equal amount of PVA as<br>
that used in the Synthesis Example-1 with the P-DDMC was<br>
designated as Comparative Sample-1.  The Comparative Sample-1<br>
separated into 2 phases, and again separated into 2 phases     <br>
within 1 day even when mixed with a homogenizer,	<br>
The cation equivalent value, the intrinsic viscosity, and the weight ratio (% insoluble matter) of methanol-insoluble matter of the Comparative Sample-1 were measured in accordance with the same procedure as Synthesis Example-1.  Polymer properties are shown in Table 1.<br>
