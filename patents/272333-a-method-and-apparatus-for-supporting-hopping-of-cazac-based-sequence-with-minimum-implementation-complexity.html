SEQUENCE HOPPING IN SC-FDMA COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to wireless communication systems<br>
and, more particularly, to a Single-Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access<br>
(SC-FDMA) communication system that is further considered in the development<br>
of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Evolved Universal Terrestrial<br>
Radio Access (E-UTRA) long term evolution (LTE).<br>
2.	Description of the Art<br>
Methods and apparatus are considered for the functionality and<br>
implementation of hopping for sequences used in the construction of Reference<br>
Signals (RS) or control signals transmitted in SC-FDMA communication systems.<br>
The Uplink (UL) of the communication system is assumed, which<br>
corresponds to signal transmissions from mobile User Equipments (UEs) to a<br>
serving base station (Node B). A UE, also commonly referred to as terminal or<br>
mobile station, may be fixed or mobile and may be a wireless device, a cellular<br>
phone, a personal computer device, a wireless modem card, etc. A Node B is<br>
generally a fixed station and may also be called a Base Transceiver System<br>
(BTS), an access point, or some other terminology. A Node B may control<br>
multiple cells in a cellular communication system, as it is known in the art.<br>
Several types of signals need to be supported for the prope'r functionality<br>
of the communication system. In addition to data signals, which convey the<br>
information content of the communication, control signals also need to be<br>
transmitted from UEs to their serving Node B in the UL and from the serving<br>
Node B to UEs in the downlink (DL) of the communication system. The DL<br>
refers to the communication from the Node B to UEs. Additionally, a UE having<br>
data or control transmission also transmits RSs, also known as pilots. These RSs<br>
primarily serve to provide coherent demodulation for the transmitted data or<br>
control signals by a UE.<br>
 <br>
The UEs are assumed to transmit data or control signals over a<br>
Transmission Time Interval (TTI), which is assumed to correspond to a sub-<br>
frame. The sub-frame is the time unit of a frame, which may consist of ten sub-<br>
frames. FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of the sub-frame structure 110. The<br>
sub-frame 110 includes two slots. Each slot 120 further includes seven symbols<br>
used for transmission of data or control signals. Each symbol 130 further includes<br>
a Cyclic Prefix (CP) in order to mitigate interference due to channel propagation<br>
effects. The signal transmission in one slot may be in the same or at a different<br>
part of the operating bandwidth (B W) than the signal transmission in the second<br>
slot. In addition to symbols carrying data or control information, some symbols<br>
are used for Reference Signal (RS) transmission 140.<br>
The transmission BW is assumed to include frequency resource units,<br>
which will be referred to herein as resource blocks (RBs). Each RB may consist<br>
of 12 sub-carriers and UEs are allocated a multiple N of consecutive RBs 150 for<br>
Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) transmission and 1 RB for Physical<br>
Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH) transmission.<br>
As the data or control signal transmission is over a BW that can be<br>
(orthogonally) shared by multiple UEs, the corresponding physical layer channel<br>
may be respectively referred to as PUSCH or as PUCCH. FIG. 1 illustrates a<br>
structure for the PUSCH sub-frame while respective ones for the PUCCH will be<br>
subsequently described.<br>
The UEs are also assumed to transmit control signals in the absence of any<br>
data signals. The control signals include, but are not limited to, positive or<br>
negative acknowledgment signals (ACK or NAK, respectively) and Channel<br>
Quality Indication (CQI) signals. The ACK/NAK signals are in response to the<br>
correct or incorrect, respectively, data packet reception by a UE in the DL of the<br>
communication system. The CQI signals are sent by a UE to inform its serving<br>
Node B of its Signal-to-Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) conditions in order<br>
for the serving Node B to perform channel dependent scheduling in the DL of the<br>
communication system. Both ACK/NAK and CQI signals are accompanied by RS<br>
signals in order to enable their coherent demodulation at the Node B receiver. The<br>
 <br>
physical layer channel conveying ACK/NAK or CQI control signaling may be<br>
referred as the PUCCH.<br>
The ACK/NAK, CQI and associated RS signals are assumed to be<br>
transmitted by UEs in one RB using CAZAC sequences as it is known in the art<br>
and is subsequently described.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a structure for the ACK/NAK transmission during one slot<br>
210 in a SC-FDMA communication system. The ACK/NAK information bits 220<br>
modulate 230 a "Constant Amplitude Zero Auto-Correlation (CAZAC)" sequence<br>
240, for example with QPSK or 16QAM modulation, which is then transmitted<br>
by the UE after performing an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) operation<br>
as it is further subsequently described. In addition to the ACK/NAK, RS is<br>
transmitted to enable the coherent demodulation of the ACK/NAK signal at the<br>
Node B receiver. The third, fourth, and fifth SC-FDMA symbols in each slot may<br>
carry an RS 250.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a structure for the CQI transmission during one slot 310 in a<br>
SC-FDMA communication system. Similar to the ACK/NAK transmission, the<br>
CQI information bits 320 modulate 330 a CAZAC sequence 340, for example<br>
with QPSK or 16QAM modulation, which is then transmitted by the UE after<br>
performing the IFFT operation as it is further subsequently described. In addition<br>
to the CQI, RS is transmitted to enable the coherent demodulation at the Node B<br>
receiver of the CQI signal. In the embodiment, the second and sixth SC-FDMA<br>
symbols in each slot carry an RS 350.<br>
As it was previously mentioned, the ACK/NAK, CQI, and RS signals are<br>
assumed to be constructed from CAZAC sequences. An example of such<br>
sequences is the Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences whose elements are given by<br>
Equation (1) below:<br>
 <br>
L is the length of the CAZAC sequence, n is the index of an element of the<br>
sequence n = {0, 1, 2 ..., L - 1}, and k is the index of the sequence itself. For a<br>
given length L, there are L - 1 distinct sequences, if L is prime. Therefore, the<br>
 <br>
entire family of sequences is defined as k ranges in {1,2 ...,L- 1}. However, it<br>
should be noted that the CAZAC sequences used for the ACK/NAK, CQI, and RS<br>
transmission need not be generated using the exact above expression as it is<br>
further discussed below.<br>
For CAZAC sequences of prime length L, the number of sequences is L-l.<br>
As the RBs are assumed to consist of an even number of sub-carriers, with 1 RB<br>
consisting of 12 sub-carriers, the sequences used to transmit the ACK/NAK, CQI,<br>
and RS can be generated, in the frequency or time domain, by either truncating a<br>
longer prime length (such as length 13) CAZAC sequence or by extending a<br>
shorter prime length (such as length 11) CAZAC sequence by repeating its first<br>
element(s) at the end (cyclic extension), although the resulting sequences do not<br>
fulfill the definition of a CAZAC sequence. Alternatively, the CAZAC sequences<br>
can be directly generated through a computer search for sequences satisfying the<br>
CAZAC properties.<br>
A block diagram for the transmission through SC-FDMA signaling of a<br>
CAZAC-based sequence in the time domain is shown in FIG. 4. The selected<br>
CAZAC-based sequence 410 is generated through one of the previously described<br>
methods (modulated by the respective bits in case of ACK/NAK or CQI<br>
transmission), it is then cyclically shifted 420 as it is subsequently described, the<br>
Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the resulting sequence is obtained 430, the<br>
sub-carriers 440 corresponding to the assigned transmission bandwidth are<br>
selected 450, the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) is performed 460, and<br>
finally the CP 470 and filtering 480 are applied to the transmitted signal 490. Zero<br>
padding is assumed to be performed by a UE in sub-carriers used for signal<br>
transmission by another UE and in guard sub-carriers (not shown). Moreover, for<br>
brevity, additional transmitter circuitry such as digital-to-analog converter, analog<br>
filters, amplifiers, and transmitter antennas, as they are known in the art, are not<br>
shown in FIG. 4. Similarly, for the PUCCH, the modulation of a CAZAC<br>
sequence with ACK/NAK or CQI bits is well known in the art, such as for<br>
example QPSK modulation, and is omitted for brevity.<br>
At the receiver, the inverse (complementary) transmitter functions are<br>
performed. This is conceptually illustrated in FIG. 5 where the reverse operations<br>
 <br>
of those in FIG. 4 apply. As it is known in the art (not shown for brevity), an<br>
antenna receives the RF analog signal and after further processing units (such as<br>
filters, amplifiers, frequency down-converters, and analog-to-digital converters)<br>
the digital received signal 510 passes through a time windowing unit 520 and the<br>
CP is removed 530. Subsequently, the receiver unit applies an FFT 540, selects<br>
550 the sub-carriers 560 used by the transmitter, applies an Inverse DFT (IDFT)<br>
570, de-multiplexes (in time) the RS and CQI signal 580, and after obtaining a<br>
channel estimate based on the RS (not shown) it extracts the CQI bits 590. As for<br>
the transmitter, well known receiver functionalities such as channel estimation,<br>
demodulation, and decoding are not shown for brevity.<br>
An alternative generation method for the transmitted CAZAC sequence is<br>
in the frequency domain. This is depicted in FIG. 6. The generation of the<br>
transmitted CAZAC sequence in the frequency domain follows the same steps as<br>
the one in the time domain with two exceptions. The frequency domain version of<br>
the CAZAC sequence is used 610 (that is the DFT of the CAZAC sequence is<br>
pre-computed and not included in the transmission chain) and the cyclic shift 650<br>
is applied after the IFFT 640. The selection 620 of the sub-carriers 630<br>
corresponding to the assigned transmission BW, and the application of CP 660<br>
and filtering 670 to the transmitted signal 680, as well as other conventional<br>
functionalities (not shown), are as previously described for FIG. 4.<br>
The reverse functions are again performed for the reception of the<br>
CAZAC-based sequence transmitted as in FIG. 6. This is illustrated in FIG. 7.<br>
The received signal 710 passes through a time windowing unit 720 and the CP is<br>
removed 730. Subsequently, the cyclic shift is restored 740, an FFT 750 is<br>
applied, and the transmitted sub-carriers 760 are selected 765. FIG. 7 also shows<br>
the subsequent correlation 770 with the replica 780 of the CAZAC-based<br>
sequence. Finally, the output 790 is obtained which can then be passed to a<br>
channel estimation unit, such as a time-frequency interpolator, in case of a RS, or<br>
can be used for detecting the transmitted information, in case the CAZAC-based<br>
sequence is modulated by ACK/NAK or CQI information bits.<br>
 <br>
The transmitted CAZAC-based sequence in FIG. 4 or FIG. 6 may not be<br>
modulated by any information (data or control) and can then serve as the RS, as<br>
shown, for example, in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3.<br>
Different cyclic shifts of the same CAZAC sequence provide orthogonal<br>
CAZAC sequences. Therefore, different cyclic shifts of the same CAZAC<br>
sequence can be allocated to different UEs in the same RB for their RS or<br>
ACK/NAK, or CQI transmission and achieve orthogonal UE multiplexing. This<br>
principle is illustrated in FIG. 8.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, in order for the multiple CAZAC sequences 810, 830,<br>
850, 870 generated correspondingly from multiple cyclic shifts 820, 840, 860,<br>
880 of the same root CAZAC sequence to be orthogonal, the cyclic shift value A<br>
890 should exceed the channel propagation delay spread D (including a time<br>
uncertainty error and filter spillover effects). If Ts is the duration of one symbol,<br>
the number of cyclic shifts is equal to the mathematical floor of the ratio Ts/D.<br>
For a CAZAC sequence of length 12, the number of possible cyclic shifts is 12<br>
and for symbol duration of about 66 microseconds (14 symbols in a 1 millisecond<br>
sub-frame), the time separation of consecutive cyclic shifts is about 5.5<br>
microseconds. Alternatively, to provide better protection against multipath<br>
propagation, only every other (6 of the 12) cyclic shift may be used providing<br>
time separation of about 11 microseconds.<br>
CAZAC-based sequences of the same length typically have good cross-<br>
correlation properties (low cross-correlation values), which is important in order<br>
to minimize the impact of mutual interference in synchronous communication<br>
system and improve their reception performance. It is well known that ZC<br>
sequences of length L have optimal cross-correlation of However, this<br>
property does not hold when truncation or extension is applied to ZC sequences<br>
or when CAZAC-based sequences are generated through computer search.<br>
Moreover, CAZAC-based sequences of different lengths have a wide distribution<br>
of cross-correlation values and large values can frequently occur leading to<br>
increased interference.<br>
 <br>
FIG 9 illustrates the Cumulative Density Function (CDF) of cross-<br>
correlation values for length-12 CAZAC-based sequence resulting from cyclically<br>
extending a length-11 ZC sequence, truncating a length-13 ZC sequence and<br>
generating length-12 CAZAC-based sequences through a computer search<br>
method. Variations in cross-correlation values can be easily observed. These<br>
variations have even wider distribution for cross-correlations between CAZAC-<br>
based sequences with different lengths.<br>
The impact of large cross-correlations on the reception reliability of signals<br>
constructed from CAZAC-based sequences can be mitigated through sequence<br>
hopping. Pseudo-random hopping patterns are well known in the art and are used<br>
for a variety of applications. Any such generic pseudo-random hopping pattern<br>
can serve as a reference for sequence hopping. In this manner, the CAZAC-based<br>
sequence used between consecutive transmissions of ACK/NAK, CQI, or RS<br>
signals in different SC-FDMA symbols, can change in a pseudo-random pattern<br>
and this reduces the probability that CAZAC-based generated signals will be<br>
subjected to large mutual cross-correlations and correspondingly experience large<br>
interference over their transmission symbols.<br>
There is therefore a need for supporting hopping of CAZAC-based<br>
sequences with minimum implementation complexity in order to reduce the<br>
average interference among CAZAC-based sequences.<br>
There is another need for assigning CAZAC-based sequences through<br>
planning in different Node Bs and different cells of the same Node B in a<br>
communication system.<br>
Finally, there is a need for minimizing the signaling overhead for<br>
communicating sequence hopping parameters or the sequence assignment<br>
(planning) from the serving Node B to the UEs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made to address at least the above-<br>
mentioned problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages<br>
 <br>
described below. Accordingly, an aspect of the present invention provides an<br>
apparatus and method for supporting CAZAC-based sequence hopping or<br>
sequence planning.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention enables CAZAC-based sequence<br>
hopping with minimum implementation complexity at a UE transmitter and a<br>
Node B receiver by applying the same hopping pattern to the sequences used for<br>
signal transmission in all possible channels.<br>
Additionally, an aspect of the present invention enables CAZAC-based<br>
sequence hopping with minimum implementation complexity at a UE transmitter<br>
and a Node B receiver by limiting the total number of sequences in the sets of<br>
sequences for the possible resource block allocations to be equal to the smallest<br>
number of sequences obtained for one of the possible resource block allocations.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention enables CAZAC-based sequence<br>
hopping and planning with minimum signaling overhead for communicating the<br>
sequence allocation parameters from the serving Node B to UEs.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, an apparatus and a<br>
method are provided for a user equipment to transmit a signal using one sequence<br>
in all symbols of a sub-frame where the signal is transmitted if the resource block<br>
allocation is smaller than or equal to a predetermined value and to transmit a<br>
signal using, respectively, a first sequence and a second sequence in a first<br>
symbol and a second symbol of a sub-frame where the signal is transmitted if the<br>
resource block allocation is larger than a predetermined value.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, an apparatus and a<br>
method are provided for a user equipment to transmit a signal using a sequence<br>
from a full set of sequences in a symbol of a sub-frame where the signal is<br>
transmitted if the resource block allocation is smaller than or equal to a<br>
predetermined value and to transmit a signal using a sequence from a sub-set of<br>
sequences in a symbol of a sub-frame where the signal is transmitted if the<br>
resource block allocation is larger than a predetermined value.<br>
 <br>
According to an additional embodiment of the present invention, an<br>
apparatus and a method are provided for a user equipment to transmit a signal in a<br>
data channel using a sequence from a set of sequences wherein the sequence at<br>
each symbol of a sub-frame where the signal is transmitted is determined<br>
according to a pseudo-random hopping pattern and to transmit a signal in a<br>
control channel using a sequence from a set of sequences wherein the sequence at<br>
each symbol of a sub-frame where the signal is transmitted is determined<br>
according to same pseudo-random hopping pattern. The signal and the number of<br>
symbols where the signal is transmitted may be different between the data and<br>
control channels but the sequence hopping pattern remains the same by adjusting<br>
the rate of its application (slower rate applies for the channel having the larger<br>
number of symbols for the signal transmission using sequence hopping).<br>
According to a further embodiment of the present invention, an apparatus<br>
and a method are provided for a user equipment to transmit a signal in a control<br>
channel using one or more sequences from a set of sequences wherein the first<br>
sequence is signaled by the serving Node B, and to transmit a signal in a data<br>
channel using one or more sequences from a set of sequences wherein the first<br>
sequence is determined from the set of sequences by applying a shift relative to<br>
the first sequence in the respective set of sequences used for the control channel<br>
as signaled by the serving Node B. The reverse relation may apply in determining<br>
the first sequence in the control and data channels.<br>

(FDM) systems in general and to Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple<br>
Access (OFDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM),<br>
Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Discrete Fourier Transform<br>
(DFT)-spread OFDM, DFT-spread OFDMA, Single-Carrier OFDMA (SC-<br>
OFDMA), and Single-Carrier OFDM in particular.<br>
 <br>
Methods of the embodiments of the invention solve problems related to the<br>
need for enabling sequence planning or sequence hopping for CAZAC-based<br>
sequences while minimizing the respective implementation complexity at a UE<br>
transmitter and at a Node B receiver and minimizing the signaling overhead<br>
required for configuring the sequence planning or the sequence hopping patterns.<br>
As discussed in the foregoing background, the construction of CAZAC-<br>
based sequences may be through various methods. The number of sequences<br>
provided with cyclic extension or truncation of Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences<br>
depends on the sequence length. Some indicative values for corresponding RB<br>
allocations are shown in Table 1 where one RB is assumed to consist of 12 sub-<br>
carriers.<br>
 <br>
Since the number of CAZAC-based sequences depend on the<br>
corresponding sequence length, a number of sequences of larger length can be<br>
associated with each sequence of smaller length. For example, referring to Table<br>
1, for cyclic extension of ZC sequences, each of the 10 sequences of length 12<br>
can be associated (one-to-one mapping) with a set of 7 sequences of length 72<br>
(since there are 70 sequences of length 72). Moreover, the number of sequences<br>
for small RB allocations, such as 1 RB or 2 RBs, is the smallest and defines the<br>
 <br>
constraints in allocating different sequences in neighboring cells and Node Bs (a<br>
Node B may comprise of multiple cells). For these sequences, if a pseudo-random<br>
hopping pattern applies for their transmission, the same sequence may often be<br>
used in neighboring cells resulting to full interference of transmissions and<br>
associated degradation in the reception reliability of signals transmitted through<br>
the use of CAZAC-based sequences.<br>
To mitigate the sequence allocation problem resulting from the small<br>
number of available CAZAC-based sequences for the smaller RB allocations,<br>
CAZAC sequences constructed through computer searches can be used as a larger<br>
number of sequences can be obtained in this manner. However, unlike CAZAC-<br>
based sequences obtained from cyclic extension or truncation of ZC sequences, a<br>
closed form expression for computer generated CAZAC sequences does not exist<br>
and such sequences need to be stored in memory. For this reason, their use is<br>
typically confined to small RB allocations where the shortage of CAZAC-based<br>
sequences is most acute. For the larger RB allocations, CAZAC-based sequences<br>
are generated through the implementation of a formula such as the one described<br>
for the generation of ZC sequences. About 30 computer generated CAZAC<br>
sequences can be obtained for 1 RB allocations and by obtaining the same<br>
number of sequences for 2 RB allocations, sequence planning and sequence<br>
hopping is then constrained by the number of sequences for 1, 2, or 3 RB<br>
allocations. In a preferred embodiment this number is 30.<br>
The invention considers cyclic extension of ZC sequences for the<br>
generation of CAZAC-based sequences for allocations equal to or larger than 3<br>
RBs and computer generated CAZAC sequences for allocations of 1 RB or 2<br>
RBs.<br>
An embodiment of the invention assumes that PUCCH transmissions from<br>
a UE occupy one RB and allocations larger than 1 RB are used only for the<br>
PUSCH, which, in the embodiment, contains 2 RS transmission symbols per sub-<br>
frame. Therefore, only one sequence hopping opportunity exists within a PUSCH<br>
sub-frame.<br>
 <br>
For packet retransmissions based on Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest<br>
(HARQ), as it is known in the art, the interference experienced by the CAZAC-<br>
based sequence used for RS transmission will be different among retransmissions<br>
as different RB allocations (different size or different BW position leading to<br>
partial overlapping between two CAZAC sequences) are likely to be used for UEs<br>
in interfering cells during a packet retransmission. Moreover, the channel<br>
characteristics are likely to be different between retransmissions and this also<br>
leads to different cross-correlation characteristics among interfering CAZAC<br>
sequences. Therefore, extending the number of sequences for each RB allocation<br>
to more than 2 is of little or no benefit to the PUSCH reception quality.<br>
For the above reasons, the invention considers the use of only a sub-set of<br>
sequences from the total set of available ones. These sequences may be fixed and<br>
selected according to their cross-correlation and/or according to their cubic metric<br>
values where small values are desired in both cases. Limiting the number of<br>
sequences that can be used for hopping for the larger RB allocations, reduces the<br>
number of sequence groups and corresponding hopping patterns that need to be<br>
supported and therefore reduces the complexity and signaling overhead to support<br>
sequence hopping.<br>
Considering that the limitation of sequences, and therefore the limitation in<br>
hopping patterns, occurs for the smaller RB allocations and that an embodiment<br>
of the invention assumes 2 RS per PUSCH sub-frame, one sequence for small RB<br>
allocations can be associated with two sequences for the larger RB allocations. As<br>
the embodiment assumes 30 computer generated CAZAC sequences for 1 RB and<br>
2 RB allocations, the grouping of sequences for different RB allocations results in<br>
30 groups where each group includes one CAZAC-based sequence for allocations<br>
up to 5 RBs and two CAZAC sequences for allocations larger than 5 RBs (Table<br>
1). The sequences in each group are different.<br>
The grouping principle is summarized in Table 2. In an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, there are 30 sequence groups (one-to-one mapping is assumed<br>
between each sequence group and each sequence in a set of 30 sequences).<br>
Considering the number of available sequences from Table 1, it becomes<br>
apparent that only a sub-set of sequences is used for allocations of 4 RBs (30 out<br>
 <br>
of set of 46 sequences are used), 5 RBs (30 out of set of 58 sequences are used),<br>
and 6 RBs or larger (60 out of a set of 70 or more sequences are used). As<br>
previously mentioned, the sub-set of these sequences may be fixed and selected<br>
for its cross-correlation and/or cubic metric properties. Therefore, the number of<br>
sequence groups is equal to the smallest sequence set size, which in the<br>
embodiment is equal to 30, with each group containing one sequence for<br>
allocations up to 5 RBs and two sequences for allocations larger than 5 RBs, and<br>
each set containing 30 sequences for allocations smaller than or equal to 5 RBs<br>
and 60 sequences for allocations larger than 5 RBs.<br>
 <br>
The invention considers that the CAZAC sequence allocation to cells or<br>
Node Bs is either through planning or hopping. If both sequence planning and<br>
sequence hopping could supported in a communication system, the UEs are<br>
informed of the selection for planning or hopping through a respective indicator<br>
broadcasted by the Node B (one bit is needed to indicate whether sequence<br>
planning or sequence hopping is used).<br>
Sequence planning assigns each of the 30 groups of sequences, with each<br>
group containing 1 sequence for allocations up to 5 RBs and 2 sequences for<br>
allocations larger than 5 RBs, to neighboring cells and Node Bs so that the<br>
geographical separation between cells using the same group of sequences is<br>
preferably maximized. The assignment may be explicit through broadcasting of<br>
 <br>
group sequence number, which in an embodiment having 30 sequence groups can<br>
be communicated through the broadcasting of 5 bits, or it can be implicit by<br>
associating the group sequence number to the cell identity. This is equivalent to<br>
specifying one sequence from the set of sequences with the smallest size (because<br>
a one-to-one mapping between each of these sequences and each group of<br>
sequences is assumed). In the embodiment this can be either of the sets of 30<br>
sequences corresponding to 1, 2, or 3 RB allocations.<br>
This principle is illustrated in FIG. 10 for cell based and Node B based<br>
sequence group allocation (a Node B is assumed to serve 3 cells). For cell based<br>
sequence group assignment, different cells, such as, for example cells 1010 and<br>
1020, are assumed to be allocated different sequence groups. For Node B based<br>
sequence group assignment, different cells, such as, for example Node Bs 1030<br>
and 1040, are assumed to be allocated different sequence groups. Obviously, after<br>
exhausting all sequence groups, having the same sequence group in cells or Node<br>
Bs cannot be avoided but the objective is to have large geographical separation<br>
among such cells or Node Bs so that the interference caused from using the same<br>
sequences is negligible.<br>
Sequence hopping may still apply between the pair of sequences for<br>
allocations of 6 RBs or larger during the two RS transmission symbols of the<br>
PUSCH sub-frame as illustrated in FIG. 11. This provides additional<br>
randomization of the cross-correlations among sequences transmitted from UEs in<br>
different cells and thereby provides more robust reception reliability than the one<br>
achieved purely through sequence planning. No hopping applies for the sequences<br>
with length smaller than 6 RBs assuming that all sequence groups are used for<br>
planning. Therefore, if the PUSCH allocation to a UE is smaller than 6 RBs, the<br>
same CAZAC sequence is used for the RS transmission symbols 1110 and 1120<br>
while if the PUSCH allocation is 6 RBs or larger, a different CAZAC sequence,<br>
among 2 possible CAZAC sequences, is used for the RS transmission in each of<br>
the symbols 1110 and 1120.<br>
 <br>
transmission in the two symbols of the PUSCH sub-frame in FIG. 1 is based on<br>
sequences from two typically different groups of sequences. However, in order to<br>
limit the complexity and signaling required to define the sequence hopping<br>
patterns and since there is no additional benefit from having more than one<br>
sequence per group for allocations larger than 5 RBs when sequence hopping is<br>
used, only one sequence for each RB allocation exists for any of the 30 groups of<br>
sequences. In other words, only one sequence is selected to be used for each of<br>
the possible RB allocations (all entries in Table 2 contain 1 sequence) and all sets<br>
of sequences contain the same number of sequences, which is the same as the<br>
number of sequence groups. FIG. 12 and FIG. 13 further illustrate this concept.<br>
In FIG. 12, different sequence groups such as 1210 and 1230 or 1220 and 1240<br>
are used during different transmission periods in each cell.<br>
In FIG. 13, the sequence used by a UE during successive RS transmissions<br>
1310 and 1320 varies according to a sequence hopping pattern which is initialized<br>
either explicitly through broadcast signaling in each cell or implicitly through the<br>
broadcasted cell identity. The sequence hopping pattern may be the same for all<br>
cells and only its initialization may be cell dependent by specifying the initial<br>
sequence group or, equivalently, by specifying the initial sequence for an RB<br>
allocation since one-to-one mapping between each sequence in a set and each<br>
sequence group is assumed. The first transmission period may correspond to the<br>
first slot of the first sub-frame in a period of one frame (for example, a frame may<br>
comprise of 10 sub-frames) or to any other predetermined transmission instance.<br>
The same concept can be trivially extended to Node B specific sequence hopping.<br>
Sequence hopping for both PUCCH signals (ACK/NAK, CQI, and RS)<br>
and the PUSCH RS can also be supported and the respective signaling is<br>
subsequently considered.<br>
In order to maximize the PUCCH UE multiplexing capacity, all cyclic<br>
shifts (CS) of a CAZAC sequence are assumed to be used for the PUCCH<br>
transmission within a cell thereby necessitating the use of different CAZAC<br>
sequences in different cells (FIG. 10 with cell based group allocation). However,<br>
for the PUSCH, this depends on the extent of the application of Spatial Domain<br>
Multiple Access (SDMA) as it is known in the art. With SDMA, multiple UEs<br>
 <br>
share the same RBs for their PUSCH transmission (no SDMA applies for the<br>
PUCCH as all CS are assumed to be used in each cell).<br>
Without SDMA or with SDMA applied to a maximum of 4 UEs per cell,<br>
assuming that 12 CS can be used, the same CAZAC sequence may be used<br>
among the adjacent cells of the same Node B with different CS used to<br>
discriminate the PUSCH RS in each cell as shown in FIG. 14 which is combined<br>
with FIG. 10 for the case of Node B based sequence group allocation. Cells 1410,<br>
1420, and 1430 use the same sequence group, that is the same CAZAC-based<br>
sequence for any given PUSCH RB allocation, but use different CS in order to<br>
separate the sequences.<br>
With SDMA applied to more than 4 UEs per cell (with 3 cells per Node<br>
B), it may not be possible to rely on the use of different CS to separate the<br>
PUSCH RS from UEs in different cells. Then, a different CAZAC-based<br>
sequence needs to be used per cell as is the case for the PUCCH (FIG. 10 with<br>
cell based group allocation). Regardless of the separation method for the PUSCH<br>
RS from UEs in different cells of a Node B (through different CS of the same<br>
CAZAC-based sequence or through different CAZAC-based sequences), the<br>
present invention considers that the sequence hopping pattern for the PUCCH is<br>
derived from the signaled sequence hopping pattern for the PUSCH (the reverse<br>
may also apply).<br>
If different CAZAC-based sequences are used for the PUSCH RS<br>
transmission in the cells of a Node B (FIG. 10 with cell based group allocation),<br>
for example through sequence planning, the invention considers that the same<br>
CAZAC sequence can be used for 1 RB allocations of the PUSCH RS and for the<br>
PUCCH (for which the signal transmissions are assumed to be always over 1<br>
RB). Therefore, the initial sequence group assignment for the PUSCH, either<br>
through explicit signaling in a broadcast channel in the serving cell or through<br>
implicit mapping to the broadcasted cell identity, determines the sequence used<br>
for the PUCCH transmission. This concept is illustrated in FIG. 15.<br>
It should be noted that PUCCH signals (RS and/or ACK/NAK and/or CQI)<br>
may allow for more sequence hopping instances within a sub-frame (symbol-<br>
based sequence hopping), but the same hopping pattern can still apply as it only<br>
 <br>
needs to have a longer time scale for the PUSCH RS. If the sequence hopping for<br>
PUCCH signals is slot based and not symbol based, the PUSCH and PUCCH use<br>
the same sequence hopping patterns.<br>
If the same CAZAC sequence is used for the PUSCH RS transmission in<br>
different cells of the same Node B (FIG. 10 with Node B based sequence group<br>
allocation), the sequence hopping pattern for the PUCCH transmission may still<br>
be determined by the sequence hopping pattern of the PUSCH RS transmission<br>
even though different CAZAC sequences are used in each cell of the same Node<br>
B for the PUCCH transmission. This is achieved by the Node B signaling only a<br>
shift of the initial sequence applied to the PUSCH RS transmission, with this shift<br>
corresponding to initializing the sequence hopping pattern with a different<br>
CAZAC sequence in the set of CAZAC sequences over 1 RB for the PUCCH.<br>
Clearly, as it is subsequently illustrated in FIG. 16, the addition of a shift value<br>
S is cyclical over the set of sequences, meaning that the shift value 5 is<br>
applied modulo the size of the sequence set K, wherein the modulo operation is<br>
as known in the art. Therefore, in mathematical terms, if the hopping pattern for<br>
the PUSCH is initialized with sequence number N, the hopping pattern for the<br>
PUCCH is initialized, in the respective sequence set, with sequence number<br>
M = (N + S)mod(K) where (N + S)mod(K) = (N + S)-floor((N + S)/K)-K and<br>
the "floor" operation rounds a number to its lower integer as it is known in the art.<br>
The shift can be specified by a number of bits equal to the number of<br>
sequences for the RB allocation of PUCCH signals. If the PUCCH RB allocation<br>
is the smallest one corresponding to 1 RB, this number is identical to the number<br>
of sequence groups (in the embodiment, 5 bits are needed to specify one of the 30<br>
sequences in a set of sequences or, equivalently, one of the 30 sequence groups).<br>
Alternatively, such signaling overhead can be reduced by limiting the range of the<br>
shift to only the sequences with indexes adjacent to the ones used for the by the<br>
first sequence in the hopping pattern applied to the RS transmission for the data<br>
channel. In that case, only 2 bits are needed to indicate the previous, same, or next<br>
sequence.<br>
The above are illustrated in FIG. 16 where in an embodiment, a shift of 0<br>
1610, 1 1620, and -1 1630 is applied to the sequence hopping pattern of the<br>
PUCCH transmission in three different cells relative to the sequence hopping<br>
pattern for the PUSCH RS transmission 1640. The different sequence hopping<br>
 <br>
patterns simply correspond to a cyclical shift (the addition of the shift value is<br>
modulo the sequence set size) of the same sequence hopping pattern 1640, or<br>
equivalently, the different sequence hopping patterns correspond to different<br>
initialization of the same hopping pattern. The initialization of the hopping<br>
pattern for the PUSCH may be explicitly or implicitly signaled, as previously<br>
described, and the shift for the initialization pattern for the PUCCH is determined<br>
relative to the initial sequence for the PUSCH (which may be different than the<br>
first sequence in the set of sequences). The above roles of the PUSCH and<br>
PUCCH may be reversed and the shift may instead define the initialization of the<br>
PUSCH, instead of the PUCCH, hopping pattern in a cell. The start of the<br>
hopping pattern in time may be defined relative to the first slot in the first sub-<br>
frame in a frame or a super-frame (both comprising of multiple sub-frames) as<br>
these notions are typically referred to in the art.<br>
While the present invention has been shown and described with reference<br>
to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>

initial sequence, from a set of sequences, which can be different among cells. The<br>
initial sequence used in the control (or data) channel is signaled by the serving<br>
Node B. The initial sequence used in the data (or control) channel is selected to<br>
be the sequence in a set of sequences with number equal to a shift value relative<br>
to the first sequence as signaled by the serving Node B for the control (or data)<br>
channel.<br>
