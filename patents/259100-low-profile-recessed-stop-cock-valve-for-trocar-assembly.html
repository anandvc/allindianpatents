				<td>CROSS  REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br><br>
This application is based upon  U.S. Provisional Patent Application  No.60/506,785, flied September 30,2003, entitled  "LOW-PROFILE, RECESSED STOP-COCK VALVE FOR TROCAR ASEMBLY", which is currently  pending.<br><br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
1. 	Field of the Invention<br><br>
The invention relates  to trocar assemblies.  More particularly, the invention relates  to a low­<br><br>
profile stop-cock valve structure for a trocar assembly.<br><br><br><br><br>
2. 	Description of the Prior Art<br><br>
A trocar assembly is a surgicalinstrument that is used to gain access to a body cavity.  A trocar  assembly generally comprises two major components, a trocar sleeve, composed of a trocar housing and a trocar cannula, and a trocar obturator. The trocar cannula,  having  the trocar<br>
obturator inserted  therethrough, is directed  through  the skin to access a body  cavity.  Once the body cavity is accessed, laparoscopic or arthroscopic surgery and endoscopic procedures may be performed.  In order  to penetrate the skin, the distal end of the trocar cannula  is placed against the skin that has .been previously cut with a scalpel.   The trocar obturator then  used to penetrate the skin and access the body  cavity. By applying pressure against the proximal  end  of the trocar obturator, the sharp  point  of the trocar obturator is forced through the skin until it enters  the body<br>
cavity.  The  trocar cannula  is inserted through  the perforation  made by the trocar  obturator and the trocar obturator is withdrawn, leaving  the trocar cannula as an access way to the body cavity.<br><br><br>
2<br><br>
The proximal end  portion of the  trocar  cannula is typically  joined  to a trocar housing that defines a chamber having an open distal end  portion in communication with  the interior lumen deflned by the trocar  cannula.  A  trocar obturator, or other  elongated surgical instruments, axially extend into  and are withdrawn from the  trocar  cannula  through the proximal end  portion of the chamber deflned by the  trocar  housing.<br>
Trocar assemblies also often include a stop-cock valve.  Stop-cock valves are generally integrated •with the  trocar housing positioned at the proximal end  of the  trocar cannula. The  stop­ cock  valve is positioned in communication •with the trocar  cannula for  selectively controlling the passage of an insufflation fluid, e.g. carbon dioxide,  through flexible  tubing into a portion of the trocar cannula.<br>
However, current stop-cock valves are positioned in a manner that  obstructs use of the trocar assembly. Obstruction based upon the positioning of stop-cock valves on  a trocar assembly often causes  a doctor to place  his or  her hands in a compromised or undesirable position.  In addition, current valves  are prone to accidental manipulation during procedures.  Accidental manipulation is a common occurrence that  results in desufflation of the  body  cavity  and  can lead  to frustrating and  even  dangerous situations as the medical professional's field  of view  is compromised.<br>
As such,  a need  exists  for  an improved stop-cock valve structure obviating the  shortcomings of prior  art  trocar  assemblies.  The present invention provides such  a trocar assembly with  a low profile stop-cock valve.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
3<br><br>
SUM:tvlARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
It is, therefore,  an object  of the present invention  to provide a trocar  assembly including a trocar sleeve having a trocar  housing and a trocar cannula.  The trocar sleeve includes a stop-cock valve positioned for selectively controlling the passage of an insufflation fluid into  the trocar cannula and  the stop-cock valve includes  a valve lever.  The trocar housing includes  a recess shaped  and dimensioned for receiving and covering at least a portion of the valve lever therein.<br>
It is also an object  of the present  invention  to provide a trocar assembly  wherein  the trocar sleeve includes  a longitudinal axis and  the valve lever rotates about an axis substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the trocar  sleeve.<br>

lever is curved.<br><br>
It is a further  object  of the present invention  to provide a trocar assembly wherein  the valve lever includes a longitudinal axis offset  from a pivot point of the valve lever to enhance recessing of the stop-cock valve within  the housing.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention  to provide a trocar assembly wherein  the trocar housing  includes  a housing member  base and the recess is formed  therein.<br>
It is also a further  object  of the present  invention  to provide a trocar  assembly wherein  at Least a portion of the trocar  cannula  sits within  the housing member  base with a housing member cover  sitting over the trocar cannula  for securing the at least a portion of the trocar cannula  within the housing member  base, and  the stop-cock-valve is mechanical interfitted between the trocar cannula and  the trocar housing for secure coupling to the trocar sleeve.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
4<br><br>
It is yet a further  object  of the present .invention to provide a trocar assembly wherein  the valve lever is positioned above  the recess for access by an individual utilizing the trocar  assembly.<br>
It is another object  of the present  invention to provide a trocar assembly  including  a trocar sleeve having a trocar  housing  and a trocar cannula.  The trocar sleeve .includes a stop-cock valve positioned for selectively controlling the passage of an insufflation  fluid .into the trocar  cannula.  The stop-cock valve includes a stop latch shaped  and dimensioned for engaging  the trocar  sleeve to control movement of a valve lever secured  to the stop-cock  valve.<br>
It is a further  object  of the present .invention to provide a trocar assembly wherein the stop latch engages the trocar  housing.<br>
It is still another object  of the present invention to provide a trocar assembly  wherein  the trocar  housing includes  a housing member base and the stop latch engages the housing member base.<br>

DESCRIPTION  OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br><br>
The  detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein.  It should  be understood, however, that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various  forms.  Therefore, the details disclosed herein arc not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention.<br>
A trocar assembly  with a stop-cock valve secured to a trocar housing is disclosed.   The<br><br>
stopcock valve is mounted to the trocar  housing in a low profile manner which obviates  the potential for the stop-cock valve to obstruct the hand of a medical practitioner and, thereby, compromise his or her grip during insertion. The  present stopcock valve further  helps to avoid accidental  manipulation thereof  after insertion and during later parts of medical procedures.  As those skilled in the art will certainly appreciate, the low profile stop-cock valve in accordance with the present  invention is adapted for use with a variety of trocar assemblies.<br>
Referring to Figures 1 to 5, the trocar assembly 10 generally includes a trocar cannula 12, a trocar obturator 14, and a trocar housing (or handle) 16.  The trocar cannula 12 defines  an interior lumen 18 having an open  distal end portion 20 and an open  proximal end portion  22.  The  proximal end portion 22 extends  into and is mounted in the distal end portion  24 of trocar housing  16.  The trocar housing 16 has an open  proximal end portion  26 that defines an opening 28.  The  opening  28 is provided with a proximal seal assembly  30 constructed in accordance with the present invention and described in detail hereinbelow. The  opening  28 is further  provided  with a duckbill seal assembly 32 positioned beneath the proximal  seal assembly 28.  While the present  seal assembly is disclosed  as a proximal  seal assembly forming part of a dual sealing system, the present  seal assembly<br><br><br>
8<br><br>
may be utilized in a single seal system  without departing from  the spirit of the present invention.<br><br>
In general,  the trocar sleeve  44 is composed of a trocar cannula 12 and a trocar  housing 16. The  trocar housing 16 includes  a first housing member  36 and a second  housing  member  38.  The second  housing member 38 is ultimately  composed of a second  housing  member  cover 38a and a second  housing member base 38b.  Although, the housing 16 is disclosed as two components it is contemplated that a single component could  be used without departing from  the spirit of the present invention.  The  two component housing  shown, aids in removal of specimens.<br>
The  trocar  obturator 14 is slidable in and removable  from within the trocar cannula 12 and is<br><br>
inserted  into  the trocar  housing 16 and the trocar cannula 12 through  the proximal  seal assembly 30, the duckbill seal assembly 32 and  the opening 28 of the trocar housing 16.  An obturator handle 34<br>
is provided  at the proximal end of the trocar obturator 14 and a point  or blade (not shown)  is<br><br>
formed  at the distal end thereof.  As is well known in the art, the proximal seal assembly 30 cooperates with  the exterior  of the instruments (for example,  trocar obturators and other  tools adapted  for usc in conjunction with  trocar  based procedures) ex:tend.ing through  the trocar sleeve 44 to sealingly engage the exterior  surface thereof  and thereby preclude  the passage of fluids through<br>
the trocar housing 16.<br><br><br><br><br>
ROTATIONAL LATCHING  SYSTEM<br><br><br><br><br>
With regard  to the trocar  housing  16 and with reference  to Figures 1 to 5, the trocar housing<br><br>
16 is constructed of a fttst housing member  36 and a second  housing  member 38 which are selectively coupled for reasons  that  will be discussed  below in greater  detail.  The  first and second<br><br><br>
9<br><br>
housing members 36, 38 include  aligned apertures  40, 42 shaped and dimensioned for the receipt of instruments that are selectively passed  through  the trocar housing 16.<br>
As those skilled in the art will certainly appreciate, it is important that the first and second housing  members  36, 38 remain  securely attached  during  the insertion  of the trocar sleeve 44 into the abdominal  wall, as well as during  the normal course of a procedure. However, it is also desirable<br>
to remove  the first housing member 36 dut:ing the removal of a specimen,  for example, from  the abdominal cavity.  The  removal  of the first housing member 36 allows the specimen to pass through only the duckbill seal assembly 32, instead  of passing through both the duckbill seal assembly 32 and the proximal seal assembly  30.  This  provides  for easier specimen  removal and less trauma  to the specimen during  the removal process.<br>
The first housing member 36 supports the proximal sealing assembly 30 and sits atop  the second  housing member 38 in which  the duckbill seal assembly 32 is mounted. 'The first housing member 36 includes an aperture 40 extending therethrough. The proximal  seal assembly 30 is positioned within  the aperture 40 of the first housing member 36.<br>
As to the second housing member 38, the second housing member 38 includes an aperture<br><br>
42 extending  therethrough. The  duckbill seal assembly 32 is positioned within  the aperture 42 of the second  housing  member 38 adjacent  the top surface 50 of the second housing member  38.  In fact, and for reasons  which will be discussed  below in greater  detail, the peripheral rim 52 of the duckbill seal assembly 32 is positioned directly adjacent  the top surface 50 of the second housing  member  38 for engagement with  the lower  suxface 54 of the first housing member 36.<br>
Connection of the first housing member 36 to the second  housing  member 38 is facilitated by a rotary latch mechanism 56.  In particular,  the first housing member 36 includes first and second<br><br><br>
10<br><br>
downwardly extending arms 58.  Each  of the downwardly  extending arms 58 includes a downwardly facing camming  surface 60 and an outwardly  facing latching surface 62.<br>
The second  housing member  38 similarly includes a latching  ring 64 ,v).th fust and second<br><br>
latch members  66 for respectively  engaging the respective  latching surfaces 62 of the first and second downwardly extending arms 58 of the first housing member 36.  TI1e latching ring 64 is axially aligned ,vJ.th the central  axis of the trocar sleeve 44 and lies in an annular groove  68 around the perimeter  of the duckbill  seal assembly 32.  Although the latching  ring 64 in accordance with a preferred  embodiment rotates about  a central axis of the trocar housing 16, the latching ring 64 may<br>
rotate  about  other  axes without departing from  the spirit of the present  invention.  The latching ring<br><br>
64 is capable of rotating about  the central axis of the trocar sleeve 44, but is attached  to the trocar housing 16 by a spring  70.  The spring 70 holds the latching ring 64 in a locked position with a small amount of preloaded bias.  However, the spring 70 allows rotation of the latching ring 64 during the attachment of the first housing member  36.  TI1e first and second latch members 66 respectively include upwardly  facing carnming  surfaces 72 that interface \vith downwardly facing camming surfaces  60 of the first and second  downwardly extending arms 58 of the first housing member  36.<br>
The  first and second latch members 66 each include an upwardly facing camming surface 72 shaped  and dimensioned to respectively engage the camming surfaces 60 of the downwardly extending arms 58.  Similarly, the first and second  latch metnbers 66 include inwardly facing latching surfaces 74 shaped  and dimensioned for engaging  the outwardly  facing latching surfaces 62 of the flrst and second  downwardly extending arms 58.<br>
In practice, latching of the first and second housing  members 36, 38 is achieved  by passing the ftrst aod second downwardly extending arms 58 through  holes 76 formed  in the top surface 50<br><br><br>
11<br><br>
of the second  housing  member 38.  As the first and second  downwardly extending arms 58 extend through  the respective  holes 76 adjacent  the first and second  latch members 66 of the latching ring<br>
64, the cammlng surfaces  60 of the respective  first and second  downwardly extending arms 58<br><br>
engage the cammlng surfaces  72 of the first and second latch members 66.  The engagement causes the latch ring 64 to rotate  in a manner pennitting the first and second  downwardly extending  arms<br>
58 to extend past the first and second latch members 66. Tills rot.'l.tion is against the bias provided by the spring 70.<br>
Once  the first and second  downwardly extending arms 58 move  past the first and second<br><br>
latch members  66, the spring  70 biasing the latching ring 64 causes the latching  ring 64 to return  to its original position  and  the out\vardly  facing latching surfaces 62 of the first housing  member  36 engage the inwardly  facing latching surfaces  74 of the second  housing  member 38 to securely couple the first housing  member 36 to the second  housing  member  38.  The  first and second housing members  36, 38 are selectively disengaged  through the actuation  of a lever 78 attached to the<br>
latching ring 64.  Rotation of the lever 78 causes the latching 	64 to rotate,  moving  the first and second  latching members 66 out of engagement \vith the downwardly extending arms 58.<br>
The  top surface  50 of the second housing  member  38 includes  holes 76 allowing the downwardly  extending arms  58 of the first housing  member  36 to pass through with only a small amount  of clearance.   This limited  clearance allows for very little movement of the downwardly extending  arms 58 either  in the plane of the holes 76 or in bending.   TI1erefore, when  the first housing member 36 is latched  to the second housing  member  38, the only means of forceful disassembly of the first and second  housing  members 36, 38 is by shearing the first and second downwardly  extending arms 58 themselves  or by pure tension on  the legs themselves. The  first and<br><br><br>
12<br><br>
second  arms 58 cannot bend  out of the way or slip due to the size of the holes 76.  This creates a very secure attachment. The  trocar housing 16 is disassembled by pushing  the lever 78 in a horizontal rotation, causing  rotation of the latching ring 64 about  the central axis of the trocar sleeve<br>
44 in a manner  overcoming the spring force.  The lever 78 is accessible to the surgeon  through a slot in the side of the trocar  housing 16.  When the lever 78 is pressed, the first and second latching members  66 of the latching  ring 64 rotate past the first and second  downwardly extending arms 58, and  the first housing member 36 is released from the second  housing member  38.<br>
The flrst hous.ing member 36 is attached  to the second  hous.ing member  38 by a rotary latch<br><br>
mechanism  56 and a seal between  the first and second housing members 36, 38 is required  to maintain insufflation. This seal is accomplished by using a downwardly extending flange 80 on the lower surface 54 of the first housing member  36 to compress  a portion of the duckbill seal assembly<br>
32 adjacent the top surface  50 of the second  housing member  38.  The  flange 80 and the duckbill seal assembly 32 include opposed angled surfaces.  This provides an angular interface  between the flange 80 on the first housing member  36 and the duckbill seal assembly 32 interface of the second housing member  38.  This provides  easier attachment of the first housing member 36 and permits vertical travel beyond the distance  required  to seal with no effect on the duckbill seal assembly's performance capabilities. In fact, this over travel is required to provide functional reliability in the rotary latch mechanism.<br>
The downwardly extending flange 80 of the first housing member 36 includes  an angular interface  that exerts  a radial force component on the duckbill seal assembly 32.  The  angular<br>
interface also creates  a vertical force component that translates into  assembly force.  The  radial force dilates the interfacing feature,  that is, the peripheral rim 52 of the duckbill seal assembly 32.  Since<br><br><br>
13<br><br>
the vertical force is only a portion of the total normal force, the assembly force is reduced  as a function  of the angle of the interface.<br>
In addition  to the radial and vertical forces, the seal between  the :fust and second  housing members  36, 38 generates a caroming action due to the interaction  between  the downwardly extending  flange 80 and the peripheral rim 52 of the duckbill seal assembly 32.  The radial movement of the peripheral rim 52 of the duckbill seal assembly 32 allows a small amount of over travel for the flange 80 with no negative impact to the duckbill seal assembly's  ability to seal as intended  for normal operation.<br>
In addition to providing for over travel, the compression of the peripheral rim 52 of the duckbill seal assembly  32 stores  energy assisting in the disengagement of the ftrst housing  member<br>
36 from the second housing member  38.  The stored energy causes the first housing  member 36 to readily move from  the second housing member 38 upon  actuation of the lever 78.<br>
More particularly, coupling of the first and second  housing members 36, 38 is enhanced by the provision  of a downwardly extending fu.nge 80 along the lower surface 54 of the fttst housing member  36 that is shaped and dimensioned for engaging the peripheral rim 52 of the duckbill  seal assembly 32.  With  this in mind,  the downwardly extending flange 80 is provided with an inwardly facing taper and the  peripheral rim 52 is provided with an outwardly facing taper.  The  inwardly and outwardly facing tapers  interact to permit  play between the fust and second  housing  members 36, 38 in a manner  facilitating secure attachment. By providing opposed  tapered  surfaces, and in particular by providing  an inwardly  tapered surface on the peripheral rim 52 with a slight amount of give under pressure, the dimensional tolerances necessary for ensuring coupling of the latch mechanisms are enhanced.<br><br><br>
14<br><br><br>
provision  of an alignment pin 82 extending downwardly from  the lower surface 54 of the first housing member 36 and a mating  hole 84 shaped and dimensioned for receiving the alignment  pin<br>
82 formed along  the top surface  50 of the second housing member 38.  The provision  of the alignment  pin 82 and  the mating  hole 84 ensures that the first and second  housing members 36, 38 may only be assembled in the desired  configuration. Optionally,  a second  pin may be provided  to prevent  the opposite latch  from engaging.  This is an integral part of the design as it is intended for safety.  The  trocar  obturator 14 can only be attached  to the first housing member  36 in one configuration and  the first housing member 36 can only be attached to the second  housing  member<br>
38 in one configuration.<br><br>
As discussed  above, the rotary latch mechanism 56 utilized in connecting the first housing member 36 to the second housing member 38 offers a wide variety of advantages.   In particular,  the rotary latch design  allows  the first housing member 36 to be rigidly attached  to the second housing member  38 with  no chance of the latches "slipping  off', while allowing very easy detachment of the first housing  member 36.  In fact, the holes 76 through which the first and second  downwardly extending arms 58 of the first housing  member 36 pass through  disallows any chance  of the arms 58 bending out of the way.  In addition, since the force vector of the latch return spring  70 is perpendicular to any disengaging force exerted during use, the force required  to attach  the first housing  member 36 can be addressed independently of any specified  disengaging force.  This is contrary  to typical latch designs where  the arms of the latches are elastically bent  to attach  and<br>
detach  the outer  seal housing.  In these types of designs the force of assembly and the force of disassembly  are directly linked  to one another via the bending characteristics  of the latching  arms.<br><br><br>
15<br><br>
Finally, the latch  mechanism is easily manipulated with  one  hand.<br><br>
With  regard to  the  angular contact between the downwardly extending flange  80 of the first housing member 36 and  the  peripheral rim 52 of the duckbill seal assembly 32, this provides for reduced assembly force required in attaching the first housing member 36 to the second housing member 38.  One may  compress the  first housing member 36 a greater distance than  with  a flat seal and  still get  the same force of assembly. 1bis allows  tolerances of design  parts  to be greater for given compression distance requirements.  In addition, the raised  nature of the peripheral rim 52 on the duckbill seal assembly 32 allows  for radial deflection as well, thereby, additionally reducing assembly forces.<br><br><br>
REINFORCED SEAL ASSEMBLY<br><br><br><br><br>
Referring to Figures 6 to 10,  the proximal seal assembly 30 is disclosed. The seal assembly generally includes a cap  86, a crown 88, bellows  90 used  for radial  seal movement, a female  retaining ring 92, a protector 94, a plurality of reinforced seal segments 96 making up a seal body  98, a male retaining ring 100  and  a bottom body  102.   The reinforced seal segments 96 are positioned as described below in greater detail  and  mounted between the retaining rings 92, 100  for  creating a seal assembly 30 in accordance with  the present invention.<br>
More  particularly, and  with  reference to Figures  7 to 10, a reinforced seal segment 96 is shown. As is described in greater detail  below,  the proximal seal assembly 30 employs a plurality  of reinforced seal segments 96 in creating a complete seal body  98.  Each of the reinforced seal segments 96 is in the  form of a partial  cone, in particular, a cone extending about approximately 225<br><br><br>
16<br><br><br>
invention employs  partial cones  extending about approximately  225 degrees, partial cones of other shapes may be employed without departing from the sprit of the present invention. Although  cone shaped  seal segments are disclosed in accordance with a preferred embodiment, flat seal segments could be employed  without departing from  the spirit of the present  invention.<br>
Each  reinforced seal segment 96 is preferably manufactured from an elastomer  of a cross linked polymer, such  as, but not .restricted to, polyisoprene or silicone.  However,  those skilled in the art will appreciate that other  materials  may be employed without  departil]g from the spirit of the present invention.<br>
In practice,  a series of reinforced seal segments  96 are utilized in the creation  of a seal body<br><br>
98 through  which an instrument may be inserted.   In accordance with a preferred  embodiment of the present invention, four reinforced seal segments 96 are aligned and successively shifted  90 degrees relative to each other. The  seal segments 96 are arranged  in a "woven" manner. That is, each seal segment 96 includes  a first side 104 and second  side 106, and the first side 104 of each seal segment 96 is placed atop  the second side 106 of the adjacent seal segment  96 to create a "woven" assembly of seal segments 96.<br>
The reinforced seal segments 96 are then bound  together  along their peripheral edges 1OS to the male and fe!llil.le retaining rings 94, 100 to create a complete seal body 98. As a result of the parcial cone shape  of the reinforced seal segments 96 and the relative rotation  thereof,  the bound<br>
seal segments 96 create  a seal body  98 wherein  the individual seal segments  96 are pushed  outwardly upon  the insertion of an instrument to create an opening  for the passage of instruments and resilient move inwardly to close  the opening upon  the removal of instruments. The  typical deformation of<br><br><br>
17<br><br>
the reinforced  seal segment 96 is shown  with reference  to Figure 3.  The deformation is shown with the insertion of an instrument therethrough.<br>
As mentioned above, each of the reinforced  seal segments 96 is generally in the form of a cone with a. portion of the cone  cut away.  The reinforced  seal segment  96 includes a peripheral edge<br>
108 secured to a central  seal member 110.  The peripheral edge 108 is substantially flat, lying in the<br><br>
same plane, while the central seal member 110 is formed in the shape of a section of a cone.<br><br>
The central  seal member 110 is enhanced through  the inclusion  of a reinforcement pad 112 at a central position  on  the reinforced seal segment 96.  That is, the reinforcement pad 112 is positioned  between the peripheral edge and the free edge of the central  seal member 110.  More .. particularly, the reinforcement pad 112 is positioned  at the tip of the cone defined by the central seal member 110 with edges of the reinforcement pad 112 being aligned with the free edge of the central seal member 110 at the tip of the cone.<br>
The reinforcement pad 112 is integrally formed  with the remainder of the central seal member 110, but has a thickness that is approximately  2.5 times that of the nominal  thickness of the central seal member 110.   In particular, the reinforcement pad 112 of the central seal member  110 is formed with a thickness of approximately 0.017 inches, while the remainder of the central seal member 110 is formed with a thickness of approximately .007 inches.  While thicknesses  are disclosed above in accordance with a preferred  embodiment of the present invention, different thickness may be employed without departing  from the spirit of the present  invention. The<br>
transition  between the reinforcement pad 112 and the remainder  of the central seal member  110 is achieved by tapering  the central  seal member  110 between the thickness of the reinforcement pad<br>
112 and the remainder of the central  seal member 110.  It is further  contemplated, that  the transition<br><br><br><br><br>
18<br><br>
could be done •without transition :regions; that is with a sharp  transition.   However, the preferred embodiment has no stress risers and allows the seal to seal better.   It is also contemplated that the seal segments could  have been made  with the pad flat with no transition.<br>
As shown  in Figure 7, and in accordance with a preferred  embodiment of the present invention,  the reinforcement pad 112 is general formed in a triangular  configuration along the center of the arc defined  by the reinforced seal segment  96. In particular, the reinforcement pad 112 occupies an arc of approximately 90 degrees along the central seal member 110.  As those skilled in the art will certainly appreciate, the shape and size of the reinforcement pad 112 may be varied to<br>
suit specific needs without departing from the spirit of the present  invention.  However, the reinforcement pad 112 should  be shaped  and dimensioned to cover an area that is intended for contact with instruments being passed  through  the trocar assembly 10.<br>
The reinforcement pad 112 is located on a portion  of the central seal member 110 that is most likely to have direct  contact with surgical instruments as they are inserted  within the trocar cannula 12.  In accordance with a preferred  embodiment of the present invention, the reinforcement pad 112 is centrally located, as most  surgical instruments will be inserted through the center of the trocar housing 16 and  the trocar  cannula 12.<br>
It should  be noted  that in other  embodiments the angled surface  that slopes  from  the reinforcement pad 112  to the nominal thickness of the central  seal member 110 could be omitted and the reinforcement pad 112 could be smoothly  blended into  the nominal thickness  of the central seal member  110 via continuous curvature.<br>
Low drag forces  between the proximal seal assembly 30 and an insertion instrument are desirable.  The  present proximal seal assembly 30 permits  the production of low drag forces without<br><br><br>
19<br><br>
reducing seal durability.  This is accomplished by reducing  the seal thickness in conjunction with application  of a reinforcement pad 112 as described above.  As such,  the reduction in thickness (in the area that is not contacting the instrument) is not accompanied with a reduction in seal durability as is common  with prior art seal assemblies.<br>
Seal assemblies incorporating reinforcement pads 112 in accordance with the present invention greatly reduce snagging and tearing the seal through  either  the insertion or withdrawal of an instrument without requiring additional  thickness throughout the seal segments 96.  The greater thickness in the region of the reinforcement pad 112 resists tenting at the reinforcement pad 112 where  the instrument is contacting the seal assembly 98.  However, the thin sections  of the central seal member  110 surrounding the central reinforcement pad 112 allow for easy stretching of the remainder  of the central seal member 110, thereby keeping drag forces  on mov-ing instruments to a minimum.  Since the greatest  strain occurs along. the opening of the central  seal member  110 when an instrument is present, and in accordance with a preferred embodi.t:Uent, the reinforced seal segments  96 should  be kept  thin in any areas not contacting an instrument. This  minimizes drag forces.<br>
The effective  protection imparted by the present reinforcement pad 112 manifests itself in the proximal seal assembly  30 as follows.  For a given deflection of the proximal seal assembly 30 due to initial contact with  the tip of an instrument, the region defined by the reinforcement pad 112 of the proximal seal assembly  30 will have a relatively low strain when  compared to the thinner<br>
portion of the central seal member 110 surrounding the reinforcement pad 112 due to the difference in thicknesses between the reinforcement pad 112 and the central seal member 110.  This<br>
differential in strain is largest  at the opening of the proximal  seal assembly 30, where overall strains<br><br><br><br><br>
20<br><br>
are highest.  When  force is applied  to the reinforcement pad 112 due to contact with an instrument, the increased thickness  of the reinforcement pad 112 will resist tenting, while the thin cross section of the remainder of the central  seal member  110 not covered  by the reinforcement pad 112 will allow the reinforcement pad 112 to easily deflect distally permitting the tip of the instrument to roll into  the center of the proximal seal assembly 30.  Resistance  to tearing  for the reinforced  seal segment 96 is greatly increased as compared to prior art seal segments.<br>
The reinforcement pads 112 allow the reinforced  seal segments 96 to protect themselves against sharp instruments independently of other  peripheral  protection devices.   This protection is integtal to the reinforced seal segments 96 themselves.  Also the addition of reinforcement pads 112 at strategic locations  (away from  areas of high strain directly located  at the point  of likely sharp instrument  contact)  allows the reinforcement pads 112 to protect against  puncture witl1little or no impact  to seal performance. It does  not increase peak instrument insertion forces or instrument<br>
drag forces. It is contemplated that the use of reinforcement pads 112 might  be expanded  beyond positioning at a central  location, thereby  offering some impact  to peak instrument insertion forces and instrument  drag forces.   However, due to the nature of the seal segments 96 and their greatly reduced strain relative to standard lip seals, this impact would likely yield a design that would easily outperform standard seal assemblies.<br><br><br>
WOVEN SEAL PROTECTOR<br><br><br><br><br>
Although  the seal body 98 is formed  Vlith reinforcement pads 112 as described  above it is still desirable to provide the proximal seal assembly 30 with a protector 92, as best shown in Figu.te<br><br><br>
21<br><br>
13.  The protector  92 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention is positioned  directly above  the seal body 98.  With reference  to Figures  6 and 11-13, the protector 92 is composed  of multiple  overlapping protector segments  114 assembled in a woven  arrangement to provide a complete  protector 92.  By forming  the protector 92 in a woven. arrangement, additional protector material is added  (as a result of the overlapping arrangement) such  that additional surface<br>
area of the seal body 98 may be protected as the protector segments 114 separate as an instrument is inserted  into the seal.<br>
As the present  proximal seal assembly 30 has a small central  opening which expands in a<br><br>
reliable and convenient manner, the protector 92 must be formulated to dose gaps between protector segments 114 as an instrument is passed through  the protector 92 and the seal body 98. This requires the addition of material along the opening of the protector 92.<br>
In accordance with  the present invention,  additional material  is added  to the protector 92 by weaving a plurality of protector segments  114. By weaving the protector segments 114, extra<br>
material is added  to the protector 92 so as to widen each protector component while still allowing<br><br>
the protectors to fit within  the coned  seal profile.  The extra material is wrapped behind  the protector segment 114  to one side of each protector segment 114.  This extra material is not visible when the protector segments 114 are viewed from above without an inst:turnent  inserted.<br>
The protector segments 114 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention are manufactured from molded elastomer, for example,  pellethane.  However, it is not intended  that the protector segments 114 be limited to merely elastomers, but  the protector segments 114 may be made  from any type of material that contains the required properties and characteristics  for the function described  herein.<br><br><br>
22<br><br>
In particular, four  protector segments 114 are arranged to create  the protector 92.  While four protector  segments 114 are utilized in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the protector 92 may ultimately be formed \vith different numbers of protector segments<br>
114 without  departing from  the spirit of the present invention.<br><br>
Each protector segment 114 is semicircular when viewed from  above and is generally in the form of a partial cone.  Each  of these protector segments 114 include  a substantially round peripheral edge 116, a support wall 118 extending  from the peripheral edge 116 and a cone shaped protector member 120.  The  cone shaped  protector  member 120 opposite the support wall118 and the peripheral edge 116 defines  straight shaped edge 121.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the  cone shaped protector member 120 spans  an arc of approximately 180 degrees, while the support wall118 and the peripheral edge 116 span an arc of approximately 120 degrees along  the center of the cone shaped  protector member 120.  As will be discussed below in greater  detail, the limited arc spanned by the peripheral edge 116 and  the support wall 118 reduces undesirable forces as instruments are moved past the proximal seal assembly 30.<br>
The outer peripheral edge 116 is adapted  for positioning within  the first housing member 36. The outer peripheral edge 116 further includes a series of apertures 122  that function as a means of attachment for the pxotector segments 114.  As will be apparent based  upon the following<br>
disclosure, the use of multiple  protector segments 114 defining an arc of approximately 180 degrees<br><br>
results in a reduction in hoop stresses  by providing a protector 92 composed of a series of protector segments 114 which readily bend in and out radially as instruments are inserted therethrough.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
23<br><br>
Each protector segment  114 includes a ftrst section 124 and  a second section 126 defining opposite sides of the protector segment 114.  •n1e four individual protector segments 114 are combined  in a woven arrangement to create a complete protector 92 that fully protects the underlying seal body 98.  That  is, the protector 92 is assembled by placing  the fust  section 124 of a fust  protector  segment 114 upon  the second  section 126 of a second ptotector segment 114.  The fust section 124 of the second  protector segment 114 is subsequently placed  upon  the second section 126 of a third protector segment  114, the fust section 124 of the third protector segment<br>
114 is placed upon  the second  section 126 of a fourili protector segment 114 and  the fust section<br><br>
124 of ilie fourili protector segment 114 is placed upon the second  section 126 of the first protector segment  114like one folds the final flap of a box lid.<br>
The protector segments 114 are ultinlately held togeilier through the application of ilie crown 88 and female retaining ring 94.   Retaining members are well known to those skilled in the<br>
•art and a variety of retaining  members  may be employed within the spirit of the present  invention.<br><br>
As those skilled in the art will readily appreciate, movement of the cone  shaped  protector members  120 relative to the peripheral edge 116 and the support walll18 is subject  to resistance based upon the various  orientations of the connected components. As such,  the cone  shaped protector members  120 might  be susceptible to buckling as instruments are moved  through  the proximal seal assembly 30.<br>
This resistance  to movement is mininUzed due to ilie linllted  arc of the peripheral edge 116 and the support wall118 as discussed  above.  In addition, ilie resistance is further mini.mized by forming a central slot 128 with ilie peripheral  edge 116 and/ or the support wall 118.  This slot 128 functions  to reduce  buckling as the protector members 120 may move  ilie same distance  with less<br><br><br>
24<br><br>
resistance.<br><br>
By weaving the protector 92 additional material may be added  to each protector segment<br><br>
114 while still allowing the distal end of the protector 92 to fit into  the apex of the cone shaped seal body 98.  This is accomplished by having the extra material added  to the protector segments  114 wrap  behind the protector segment 114 adjacent thereto.  This extra material allows for improved coverage of the seal body 98, especially when instruments are inserted  at an angle relative to the proximal seal assembly 30.  Finally, weaving of the protector 92 has minimal, if any effects  on the instrument drag force as it is moved in and out of the proximal seal assembly  30.  This is a result of the fact that the protector segments 114 move easily relative to each other.<br>
In practice, and due to the extra material added to each protector segment 114, as an instrument is inserted  into  the protector 92, the protector segments 114 spread,  exposing  the additional  protector material positioned behind adjacent protector segments 114.  This additional material continues to cover  the seal body 98 as the protector  segments 114 bend relative to one another. The less seal body 98 material exposed  to the inserted instrument, the better  the protection offered  by the present protector 92.  While the present protector 92 offers good  seal protection, additional protector segments 114 can be added although they might cause an increase in the instrument drag forces.  This  may be balanced, however, by thinning the protector segments 114 to make them more  flexible or by adding lubricant  to the protector  segments 114 and/or the seal body<br>
98.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

DUCKBILL SEAL ASSEMBLY<br><br><br><br><br>
As mentio ed above,  a duckbill seal assembly 32 is housed  within the second  housing member  38.  Wit.reference to Figures 14 to16, the duckbill seal assembly 32 in :accordance with a preferred  embodiment of the present invention  is disclosed.  The duckbill seal assembly 32 includes f1rst and second  seal bodies 130, 132 extending  from a circumferential flange member  134 shaped and dimensioned for mounting within  the second housing member  38.<br>
Each of the first and second seal bodies 130, 132 includes an upper  surface 136, 138 and a lower surface 140, 142.  The  upper  surface 136, 138 and the lower surface 140, 142 are generally mirror images as the first and second seal bodies 130, 132 maintain a substantially  consistent thickness along its entire length  with  the exception of the reinforcing  rib along the upper  surface<br>
136, 138.<br><br>
The first and second seal bodies  130, 132 are mounted  within  the trocar  housing  16 for movement as an instrument is passed  therethrough. With this in mind,  the proxima] end of each of the fust and second  seal bodies 130, 132 is coupled to the trocar housing 16 via the citcumferential flange 134, while the distal ends  of the first and second seal bodies 130, 132 intersect to define an abutment face 144.  The  abutment face 144 is generally positioned  within  the center  of the trocar housing 16 to permit  the passage of an instrument therethrough, while in'the absence  of such an instrument the abutment face 144 is dosed via the resilience of the fust  and second  bodies 130, 132 as they are biased under  the pressure generated from the body cavity in which the trocar  assembly<br>
10 is positioned.  For example, biased under  the pressure from the abdominal insufflation gas pressure.  This pressure  causes  the duckbill seal assembly 32 to move  to a closed position  with the<br><br><br>
26<br><br>
distal ends of the first and second seal bodies 130, 132 111 contact.<br><br>
As those skilled in the art will certainly appreciate, the seal bodies 130, 132 may be formed with ribs (not shown)  on  the upper  surface 136, 138 so as to enhance  the stability of the seal bodies<br>
130, 132 when contacted with an instrument. The ribs also provide a path for instruments to ride upon  as they pass through  the duckbill  seal assembly 32.  The ribs also lower friction as the instruments pass through the duckbill  seal assembly 32 because it provides  less surface area on which an instrument may ride, and  thus greater contact pressure between the seal and the instrument may be applied.<br>
The first and second seal bodies  130, 132 will now be described  with reference  to the first<br><br>
seal body 130.  Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the first and second seal  bodies 130, 132 are identical and  the following descriptions equally relates to the second seal body 132.  The seal body 130 is formed  with a first section 148 and a second section 150 angularly oriented relative to each other and a transverse plane 146 extending through the circumferential flange 134.   In particular,  the transverse plane 146 is substantially perpendicular  to the longitudinal axis extending through  the duckbill seal assembly  32.  The  first and second sections  148, 150 extend  from  a proximal end of the seal body 130 respectively  toward a distal end of the seal body 130.  As such,<br>
the first section  148 is positioned adjacent the proximal end of the seal body 130 adjacent  the wall of the circumferential flange 134 and  the trocar  housing 16.  The first section  148 moves  only slightly<br>
as an instrument is inserted therethrough. The second section 150 is positioned adjacent the distal end of the seal body 130 and adjacent the abutment face 144.  The second section  150 freely moves as an instrument is inserted therethrough.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
27<br><br>
In general, the first and second sections lie at angles between  0 degrees and 90 degrees relative to the transverse plane.   Assuming the transverse plane 146 lies in a horizontal  plane, and in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the first section 148, which begins at the proximal  end of the seal body 130, is oriented  at approximately a 30 degree angle relative to the horizontal plane in which  the transverse plane 146 lies. The  second section 150, which extends  to the distal end of the seal body 130, is thereafter  oriented  at a 45 degree angle relative to the horizontal plane.  Those skilled in the art will appreciate  that the angles disclosed above in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention may be varied without departing from  the spirit of the present invention. 1be chosen  angles are based upon  the trade off between  the durability  of the seal bodies  (improves at greater angles as likelihood  of an instrument pointedly  engaging  the seal, i.e. tenting is less likely at greater angles) and the height of the seal<br>
(greater angles dictate greater  height).   For example, it is contemplate the second section 150 may be formed  at an angle of approximately 40 degrees to approximately  50 degrees  while providing for the many advantages contemplated in accordance \vith the present  duckbill seal assembly 32. The<br>
height or profile of the duckbill  seal assembly 32 is important as reductions in size allow for improved instrument access because the length of the trocar housing 16 may be consequently made smaller.  Smaller housings  provide surgeons with greater access within  the body cavity and thus are very desirable.<br>
While a preferred embodiment as described above employs first and second sections  148,<br><br>
150 in implementing the present invention, additional sections may be employed  without departing from  the spirit of the present invention.  Similarly, the present  duckbill seal bodies 130, 132 may be constructed with an infinite  number of angles, that is, with a continuous curving surface, without<br><br><br>
28<br><br>
departing from  the spirit of the present invention.<br><br>
Regardless of the exact wall construction employed,  the wall angle should  be maintained low<br><br>
(for example, 30 degrees) where instruments do not ordinarily contact  the seal bodies 130, 132 of the duckbill seal assembly  32 and increase  to a high value (for example,  45 degrees) where instruments customarily  contact the wall surface of the seal bodies 130, 132.<br>
By orienting flrst and second sections 148, 150 in this manner, that is, by varying the wall<br><br>
angles along the extent  of the seal bodies  130, 132, tear resistance is improved without adjusting the overall height of the duckbill seal assembly  32.  By providing  a low wall angle at the position where instruments do not customarily contact the seal bodies 130, 132 the overall height  of the duckbill seal assembly 32, and ultimately  the  trocar  assembly 10, may be minimized, while accommodating proper seal function. The application of a high wall angle at the location where instruments customarily  contact the seal bodies 130, 132 minimizes normal forces contacting the duckbill seal assembly 32 and consequently minimizes the potential  for tearing of the duckbill seal assembly 32.<br>
As discussed above,  tl1e height  of the trocar sleeve 44 is a critical issue due to its impact on ergonomics. At the same time, the duckbill  drag, durability, and sealing functions must all be balanced  with the need for minimized trocar  sleeve 44 height.<br>
In order  to provide a superior design in accordance with the present duckbill seal assembly<br><br>
32, the height of the duckbill seal assembly 32 is minimized  by using two wall angles.  The wall angle along ilie fust section  148 is shallow  to minimize  ilie height.  At a given critical diameter, ilie wall angle becomes  steeper  at the second section  150. This steeper wall provides a lower attack angle<br>
with respect  to an inserted instrument to maximize  durability.  At the same  time, ilie sealing function is improved due to the greater  closure forces  from  ilie abdominal gas pressures acting on the second<br><br><br>
29<br><br>
section  with the lower attack angle due to the steeper wall, as compared with the angle of the first section 148.<br>
Despite  the advantages offered by the multi-angle design, forces between the duckbill seal assembly 32 and the instrument must still be further  mi.nimized. This is accommodated through wall thickness, rib geometry and surface coating adjustment.  The lower drag forces are desirable to reduce the effort  required  by a surgeon when inserting or withdrawing instruments from a trocar sleeve 44.  Reducing the effort  required is desirable  for permitting one-handed insertion or withdrawal of an instrument This  also reduces  the possibility of a ttocar  sleeve 44 being pulled out of a patient into which  the trocar  assembly 10 was inserted.<br>
As discussed,  and while angles of 30 and 45 degrees are utilized in accordance with a preferred embodiment, as larger diameter instruments are required, larger diameter duckbill seal assemblies 32 will also be required. As space is usually at a premium  in valve applications, especially for duckbill seal assemblies 32 when  used in trocar assemblies, minimal height is very desirable.  Seal durability is paramount so an angle of forty-five degrees is used to minimize tearing of the seal bodies 130, 132 while inserting or withdrawing instruments.<br>
In accordance with a prefetted embodiment, the duckbill seal assembly 32 is an elastomer or a cross linked polymer such  as, but not  restricted to, polyisoprene or silicone.<br><br><br>
ENDOSCOPE LOCK ASSEMBLY<br><br><br><br><br>
As discussed  above  in the Background of the Invention, it is often  desirable  to lock an endoscope in position relative to a trocar  assembly 10, in particular,  an obturator 14.  As such an<br><br><br>
30<br><br>
endoscope lock assembly 152 is provide in accordance with the present invention and is shown in Figures 3, 4 and z'S. The  endoscope lock assembly 152 generally includes a cam mechanism  that retains an endoscope within a trocar sleeve 44 and/or obturator 14 during insertion of trocar assembly 10.  The mechanism uses a cam to compress  an elastomeric block 154 against the endoscope. The elastomeric block 154 then grips the endoscope tightly to prevent undesired motion of the endoscope as the surgeon is visualizing the tissue layers during  the trocar assembly insertion. The cam mechanism provides for  the ability to retain the endoscope while resisting both torque and axial loads, provides for acceptable endoscope retention after  repeated throws of the cam lever 156, provides low ergonomic forces  to actuate the cam lever 156, provides for compatibility with a wide range of endoscope sizes, facilitates intuitive  use and has a long term shelf<br>
life stability.<br><br>
The  cam mechanism that retains  the endoscope within a trocar  assembly  10 uses a cam surface 158 to compress the elastomeric block 154 against the endoscope. The  elastomeric block<br>
154 then grips the endoscope tightly to prevent undesired  motion  of the endoscope as the surgeon is visualizing the tissue layers during  the trocar assembly insertion.<br>
The lock assembly 152 includes a housing 160 having a tube 162 extending therefrom. The tube 162 is aligned with an aperture extending therethrough. The  tube is formed with a sharp tip and may be utilized as an obturator in accordance with the present invention. The  tube 162 and the aperture are shaped  and dimensioned for the extension  of an endoscope therethrough. In addition, the tube 162 is shaped  and dimensioned to extend  through  the trocar cannula  12 such that the lock assembly 152, including the tube 162, may be selectively secured  to the  trocar  sleeve 44 for the use<br>
of an endoscope.<br><br><br><br><br>
31<br><br>
Attachment of the lock assembly  152 to the trocar first housing member 36 is achjeved via mating latches 164, 166 formed  on both  the underside  of the lock assembly  housing 160 and the upper  surface 168 of the first housing member 36.  The latches 164, 166  permit  selective attachment and release of the lock assembly 152 to the trocar  housing 16.  While a specific  latching  structure is disclosed  in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, other  latching structures may be utilized without departing from  the spirit of the present invention.<br>
The lock assembly housing  160 includes a caroming based locking mechanism. The locking mechanism is composed of a cam lever 156 and an elastomeric block 154.  The  cam lever 156 includes a first end 170 that is pivotally secured to the housing 160 and a free second end 172 that is adapted  for user actuation.   In practice, the cam lever 156 may be freely moved between a locking position  in which the cam lever 156 is rotated inwardly and a release position in which  the cam lever<br>
156 is rotated  outwardly.<br><br>
Camming action in accordance with the present invention is provided by a camming surface<br><br>
158 adjacent  the first end 170 of the cam lever 156.  The camming surface 158 is shaped and dimensioned to engage the elastomeric block 154 for: selectively locking  an endoscope within the lock assembly 152.  With regard  to the elastomeric block 154, it is housed within  the body of the lock assembly housing 160 and includes a forward  concave wall174 shaped and dimensioned for engaging an endoscope passing through the housing aperture. The  elastomeric block 154 further includes  first and second side walls 176, 178, wherein each side wall176, 178 includes a notch  180 for engagement with a channel182 formed within the body of the housing 160.  The  channel182 and notch  180 interact  to allow lateral movement of the elastomeric block 154 in a manner that is described below in greater  detail.  The  housing 160 further includes  upper and lower  retaining<br><br><br>
32<br><br>
members 184, 186 for securely preventing upward or downward motion of the elastomeric block<br><br>
154 within the housing 160.  Finally, the elastomeric block 154 includes a rear wall188 opposite the forward concave wall174. The rear wall188 is shaped  and dimensioned for engagement with the caroming surface 158 of the cam lever 156.<br>
The  elastomeric  block 154 and the camming surface 158 are shaped to eliminate  forceful contact, and in particular eliminate  any contact, between  the elastomeric block 154 and  the caroming surface 158 until such a time that an endoscope is positioned with the aperture of the lock assembly housing 160.  As will be described below in greater detail, when an endoscope if placed within the aperture of the lock assembly housing 160, the elastomeric  block 154 is moved  toward  the cam lever<br>
156 to such a degree  that the elastomeric block 154 comes into proximity of the caroming surface<br><br>
158 for locking of the endoscope within the aperture  once the cam lever is actuated.<br><br>
In practice,  the lock assembly 152 is used in the following manner.  The elastomeric block<br><br>
154 sits within the lock assembly housing 160 underneath the cam lever 156, which  may be either open  or closed during long-term storage.  The  elastomeric  block is purposefully not in contact with the cam lever 156 at this point  to avoid any loads on the elastomeric  block 154 that could affect the lock assembly's  152 performance after long-term storage.  The surgeon  then  opens the cam lever<br>
156 if it was originally closed.  An endoscope is inserted  into the lock assembly 154.  The  endoscope hits a chamfered surface 190 on the concave  wall 174 of the elastomeric block 154.  This lifts the elastomeric block 154 upward into  the p.roximity of the cam lever 156.  The  elastomeric block 154 then rests on top of the endoscope for the rest of its use.  The cam lever 156 is then  actuated, which compresses the compressible scope  lock onto the endoscope. The compliance of the elastomeric block 154, along with its high coefficient of friction, allows the lock assembly 152  to be compatible<br><br><br>
33<br><br>
with a wide range of endoscope sizes while minimizing ergonomic force  requitements. The elastomeric block 154 is then constrained from excessive sideways or axial motion by surrounding components 182, 184, 186 that limit its motion  as axial and torsional loads are applied  to the endoscope. This constraint, along 'V.rith an over-center  cam design, prevents the cam lever from accidentally unlocking  by itself by accident.  After the trocar assembly 10 has been inserted into the patient,  the cam lever 156 is then opened and the endoscope is removed. The  elastomeric block 154 then returns  to its original position  in the lock assembly 152 if the surgeon wishes  to reinsert  the endoscope at a later time.  The compliant elastomeric  block 154 has sufficient rigidity to relurn  to its original shape after the load from  the cam lever 156 has been removed, thus providing acceptable endoscope retention force over the course of multiple lever actuations.<br><br><br>
TROCAR SLEEVE AND STOP-COCK VALVE CONSTRUCTION<br><br><br><br><br>
As mentioned above, the trocar  sleeve 44 is composed of a trocar  housing 16 and a trocar cannula 12 extending from the trocar housing 16.  The trocar assembly 10 also includes a stop-cock valve 192 for allowing and preventing the passage of an insufflation  fluid, e.g. carbon dioxide, through flexible tubing into a portion of the trocar housing 16 and the trocar  cannula 12.<br>
With .reference to the figures, the trocar cannula 12 and the trocar  housing 16 are mechanically interfitted to fonn the trocar sleeve 44.  At least a portion of the trocar  cannula  12 sits mthin a second  housing  member  base 38b of the second  housing member 38 with  a second housing member cover 38a sitting over the trocar cannula 12 for securing the at least a portion of the  trocar cannula 12 within the second  housing  member  base 38b.<br><br><br>
34<br><br>
The  trocar cannula 12 is sized so that when the trocar obturator 14 extends completely through it and  beyond, insufflation  fluid, which passes through  the stop-cock valve 192 and the trocar  housing 16, can pass through  an annular  opening  created between  the trocar cannula  12 and<br>
the trocar obturator 14 by the slighcly greater size of the internal diameter of the trocar  cannula 12 in relation  to the outer  diameter  of the hollow shaft of the trocar obturator 14.<br>
The present invention provides a mechanism  for mechanically assembling the trocar  cannula<br><br>
12, trocar housing 16 and stop-cock valve 192 without  the need for adhesive and/or  curing techniques. In particular,  the second  housing member  38 of the trocar housing 16, trocar  cannula<br>
12 and stop-cock valve 192 are formed  as separate components that may be assembled in a convenient and reliable manner.<br>
More particularly, and with reference  to Figures 17, 18, 19 and 20, a preferred embodiment of the mechanically assembled  trocar sleeve 44 is disclosed.  The trocar sleeve 44, when,  fully assembled, comprises a stop-cock valve 192, a second  housing member  38 composed of a second housing  member cover 38a and a second  housing member  base 38b, and a trocar  cannula 12.  The various components of the trocar sleeve 44 are mechanically assembled  by intetfitt:ing  the components in a manner that is described  below in greater detaiL  Briefly, the trocar  cannula  12 fits within  the second housing  member  base 38b with the stop-cock valve 192 positioned therebetween. The second  housing  member cover 38a fits over the stop-cock valve 192, second housing member base 38b and trocar cannula  12 to retain  the various components together  and provided a surface upon  which  the first housing member  36 may be selectively mounted.<br>
With regard to the specific components making up the trocar sleeve 44, and in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present  invention, the stop-cock valve 192 includes alignment<br><br><br>
35<br><br>
wings 194, a flow opening 196, and a valve lever 198.  The valve lever 198 includes a stop latch 200. The second  housing member cover 38a includes a hexagonal bore 202, a cover rim 204, and a second housing  member cover seal206. The second  housing member  base 38b includes  friction posts  208, vanes 210, a housing rim 212, a clearance 214 for the stop-cock valve 192 and alignment<br>
wings 194.  The second housing member base 38b further includes alignment ribs 216 and a latching face 218.  The trocar cannula  12 includes  an inlet nipple 220, alignment  tabs 222, and a housing seal<br>
224.<br><br>
In practice,  the stop-cock valve 192 is inserted into the clearance 214 of the second housing member base 38b.  'The trocar cannula  12 inserts  through the opening  of the second housing member base 38b.  "Ibe alignment tabs 222 abut the vanes 210 securing the trocar  cannula  12 in a desired orientation with respect  to the second  housing member  base 38b once  the trocar cannula 12 is inserted into  the second housing member base 38b.<br>
The cover rim 204 mates with the housing rim 212. The cover rim 204 also serves to hold<br><br>
the valve lever 198 on  the stop-cock valve 192 as well as hold the stop-cock valve 192 with the valve lever 198 in position.<br>
The  valve lever 198, in a maximum  flow allowance position, ie., fully open, has the stop latch 200 abut onto the latching face 218 of the second housing member  base 38b.  This  means an operator of the valve lever 198 can sense when  the valve lever 198 is in a fully open  position by abutting latch face 218 and  the valve lever 198 stays in the fully open position. The  operator does not  have to guess that  the valve lever 198 is in the fully open position,  and  the valve lever 198 stays in the fully open  position.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
36<br><br>
The construction of tl1e trocar assembly 44 eliminates the need for adhesives  to  join the stop cock  valve 192 and  the second  housing  member  cover 38a, and the second  housing member base 38b and the trocar  cannula 12.  This is an advantage over prior art.<br>
Referring  to Figures 21 and 	an alternate  trocar sleeve 44' is disclosed.   In accordance with this alternate embodiment, tl1e trocar sleeve 44' includes a stop-cock valve 192', a second housing  member cover  38a', and a  second  housing member  base 38b'.   The  trocar sleeve 44' also includes a trocar cannula 12' which is substantially sinlllar to the trocar cannula  12 disclosed  in accordance with the prior  embodiment.<br>
The stop-cock valve 192' comprises  a valve tube taper lock extension 226', a friction<br><br>
228' and a valve lever 198'.   The second  housing member  base 38b' compnses an extension clearance  230', and a friction  post  hexagonal  bore 232'.<br>
The  valve tube  taper lock extension  226' of the stop cock valve 192' locks into  the extension clearance  230' of the second housing  member base 38b'.  The friction  post 228' of the stop  cock valve 192' fits into  the friction  post  hexagonal bore 230' of the second  housing  member base 38b', securing  the vertical alignment of the stop-cock valve 192' with respect  to the second housing member  base 38b'.<br>
Referring  to Figures 23 and 24, a further  embodiment is disclosed.   In accordance with this further embodiment, the trocar sleeve 44" comprises  a second  housing member cover  38a", a second housing  member base 38b", and a stop-cock valve 192".  The  trocar sleeve 44" also includes a trocar cannula  12" which  is substantially similar to the trocar cannula 12 disclosed in accordance<br>
with the prior embodiment.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
37<br><br>
The stop-cock valve 192" comprises a locking groove boss 234", a valve  tube  extension<br><br>
236", and  a locking groove 238".   In addition, the second housing member cover 38a" includes a locking tongue 240". The second housing membex  base 38b" also compxiscs a valve  tube  extension apextuJ:e 242" and  a boss  cleaxance  244". The valve tube extension 236" of  the stop cock valve<br>
192" inserts  and  locks, by friction fit or taper-lock, into  the valve tube  extension aperture 242" of the  second housing member base 38b". The locking gmove boss  234" of  the stop-cock valve 192" locks  into  the boss clearance 244".   This  serres to assist in securing the stop-cock valve  192" in the second housing member base 38b".<br>
As mentioned above, the stop-cock valve 192 is mechanically coupled to the  trocar sleeve 44 via tapered surfaces shaped and  dimensioned fm  frictional engagement.  As such, the outlet tube<br>
250 of the stop-cock valve 192  is formed with a tapered lock surface along the exterior of its distal end. Similarly,  the  trocar cannula 12 is formed with an inlet nipple  220, adapted for  secure coupling with  the  tapered lock  surface of the  outlet tube  250 of the stop-cock valve 192.  The tapered lock<br>
mechanical feature includes a self holding 2.0 degrees + /- 1.0 degrees angle, which is fumly seated<br><br>
into the trocax  housmg inlet  nipple 220.  The result  of this mechanical connection is considemble frictional resistance to rotational and  linear  pull out  forces.<br>
The mechanical lock  discussed above may be enhanced by the provision of a dual redundancy feature. For example, the  taper  lock  feature may be provided with  a post and  hex socket interlock, tongue and  gxoove  interlock and/ or  a snap  fit interlock.<br>
In addition, and  m accordance with the embodiment described above with reference to<br><br>
Figure  18, rotation of  the stop-cock valve  192 is minimized by the inclusion of a retaining pin  204 located on  the second housing member cover  38a that extends downwardly into the aperture 256<br><br><br>
38<br><br>
formed  in the top of the valve lever 198.  The  retaining pin 204 stabilizes the stop-cock valve 192 and prevents  rotation as the valve lever 198 of the stop-cock valve 192 is actuated.<br>
As mentioned above,  the trocar  sleeve includes a stop-cock valve 192.  The stop-cock valve<br><br>
192 is mounted within  a recess formed  in the trocar sleeve 44. As such, the stop-cock valve 192 recessed within  the outer  surface  of the second  housing member  base 38b, and ultimately  the trocar housing 16.  The  valve lever 198 is further  positioned  above  the body of the stop-cock valve 192; that is, the valve lever 198 used in actuating the stop-cock valve 192 is positioned on the top surface of the stop-cock valve 192 instead  of underneath as with trocar assemblies currently  in the marketplace. By positioning the valve lever 198 above the recessed stop-cock valve 192, the present trocar assembly 10 provides for the removal  of the stop-cock valve 192 from a potentially obstructing view while simultaneously placing  the valve lever 198 in a highly accessible  posicion.<br>
Several advantages are achieved  by recessing  tl1e stop-cock valve 192 within  the body of the trocar sleeve 44.  First,  this orientation minimizes  the obstructions caused  by users gripping the<br>
stop-cock valve 192 of the trocar assembly 10 for insertion. A more comfortable grip is, therefore,<br><br>
provided, as the stop-cock valve 192 no longer protrudes from  the surface of the trocar  housing 1G.<br><br>
The present  low profile  stop-cock valve 192 structure futther  helps to prevent  compromising desired hand positions. The  present stop-cock valve 192 orientation also helps to prevent  accidental manipulation during  procedures. Accidental  manipulation by movement of the trocar  sleeve 44 into contact  willi a patient  is a common occurrence that results in desufflation of llie body  cavity and can lead to frustrating and  even dangerous situations when the medical professional's field of view 1s compromised.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
39<br><br>
The advantages are further  enhanced by forming the valve lever 198 with a cutved  surface substantially  conforming to that of the trocar  housing 16.  In addition, the longitudinal axis along the handle portion of the valve lever 198 is offset  from the pivot point about  which  the valve lever<br>
198 rotates  so as to enhance recessing of the stop-cock valve 192.  Controlled rotation of the valve lever 198 of the stop-cock valve 192 is achieved  through  the positioning  of the stop-cock valve 192 within a recess formed in the trocar sleeve 44, more specifically, the trocar housing  16.  Specifically, and with reference to Figures 17, 18, 19 and 20, the valve lever 198 of the stop-cock valve 192 includes  a stop  latch 200 located  on the valve 198 which provides  tactile feedback  as to when  the valve lever 198 is in the open  position, i.e., the through  holes located on the valve lever 198 and valve body 199 are aligned.  The  design feature resembles a cantilever beam located  on the end of the valve lever 198 opposite the user end.<br>
As the valve lever 198 is rotated  from  the closed position  to the open  position within  the trocar assembly 10, the cantilever rotational stop latch 200 contacts  the trocar  housing  16 providing tactile feedback  that  the valve lever 198 is in the fully opened  position.   In the fully opened  position, the valve lever 198 and  valve body 199 through  holes are aligned allowing for optimal COz flow.<br>
The cantilever rotational stop latch 200 feature provides  the surgeon  with tactile feedback  to ensure  that the stop-cock valve 192 is in the open  position.  Tbis \Vill provide  the optimal flow of COz flow throughout the sw.:gical case.<br>
As those  skilled in the art will appreciate, control  of the valve lever 198 via the cantilever rotational stop  latch  200 helps in alignment of the stop-cock valve 192 through  hole 196. Misalignment of through holes 196 is corrunonly  caused by lack of tactile feedback  to the surgeon that the valve lever 198 is in the fully opened  position.<br><br><br>
40<br><br>
In addition, a strengthening gusset 264 is located  on the backside of the cantilever rotational stop latch 260 to prevent over-rotation of the valve lever 198 by bending  the valve lever 198. 1bis can be seen in Figure 17 and  18.  Over-rotation would create misalignment of the through  holes.<br>
As those skilled in the art will certainly appreciate, the design described  above offers many advantages  over prior  art assemblies. The separate  trocar cannula 12 design described  above provides for interchangeable outer  housing capabilities.  As such, the industrial design outside shape can be readily changed and updated without changing  the internal structure of the trocar sleeve.  In addition,  assembly of the trocar  cannula  12 to the trocar housing 16  joint system eliminates  the need for ultrasonic  welding.  The  present assembly methoq makes the device stronger  by molding  the trocar cannula 12 in one  part.  As those skilled in the art will certainly appreciate, prior designs utilized ultrasonic  weld  joints to assemble  the trocar cannula 12 to the trocar  housing 16.  The present assembly structure eliminates the use of such joints and, therefore, provides  no opportunity for failure of the ultrasonic weld  joints.<br>
In addition, the trocar  housing  16 is provided  with crush ribs 266 along its internal  surface. These crush ribs 266 center  the trocar  cannula  12 within  the trocar housing  16.  They also take up small variations  in tolerances making  the size of the trocar cannula 12 during manufacture less important and allowing  for inherent variations  during the molding  process.<br>
The ctush  ribs 266 further prevent  rotation of the trocar cannula  12 within  the trocar<br><br>
housing 16.  This is achieved as the crush ribs 266 extend  into the sides of the trocar cannula 12 thereby preventing relative rotation between  the trocar cannula  12 and the trocar  housing 16.<br>
Since the trocar  housing 16 and trocar cannula 12 are rather simple in construction, the molding  process  is simplified by eliminating  excessive core details on  the injection  mold  tool.  In<br><br><br>
41<br><br>
addition,  assembly of the system  is easy as compared to prior designs as all of the components making up the sleeve assembly  can be assembled  in a top down  manner.<br>
As to the stop-cock valve 192, the taper lock with dual redundant locking features  helps to<br><br>
prevent  the stop-cock valve 192 from falling off the trocar sleeve 44.  In addition, the taper lock provides  an airtight assembly  without the use of adhesive  or welding.  In addition, the stop-cock valve 192 is provided with various  lock surfaces  preventing rotation  of the stop-cock valve 192, for example, post and socket,  tongue and groove,  wings on ribs, etc.  In addition  to the taper lock features, the wings are trapped behind  the trocar housing  16, eliminating  the possibility for removal of the stop-cock valve 192 from  the trocar sleeve 44.  In addition, cmsh  ribs 266 are utilized in holding the wings tight onto the trocar cannula 12.  Finally, the low profile stop-cock valve 192 structure with a valve lever 198 positioned above  the stop-cock valve 192 allows for alignment  of<br>
the stop-cock valve 192 to provide optimal air flow and offers  users a tactile feedback  for optimizing alignment.<br>
While the preferred embodiments have been shown and described, it will be understood that there is no intent  to limit the invention by such disclosure,  but rather,  is intended to cover all modifications and alternate constructions falling within  the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.<br>
