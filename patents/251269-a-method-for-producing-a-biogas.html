				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Process for Producing Biogas<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a production method of biogas which is useful as an energy<br>
gas.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002] Anaerobic fermentation using microorganisms has been known as a method of converting<br>
biomasses such as organic wastes and organic waste water into energy. The anaerobic fermentation is a<br>
fermentation scheme in which an acid generating step from an organic matter and a methane generating<br>
step of generating methane from an organic acid generated by the acid generating fermentation usually<br>
proceed as multiple parallel fermentation, whereby a fermentation gas mainly composed of methane can<br>
be obtained as an energy gas.<br>
[0003] However, the energy obtained by boiler combustion of methane is heat, so that it is not suitable<br>
for applications requiring no heat utilization, but is limited to those directly utilizing the heat of<br>
combustion, those converting the heat into steam, and the like. Methane fuel batteries convert the<br>
resulting energy into electric power, whereby their usage is broader than the heat utilization. However,<br>
a so-called reforming reaction for generating hydrogen from methane requires a reformer and heating of<br>
a material methane gas. Usually, the heat of combustion of methane is utilized as a heat source<br>
therefor, and its thermal energy is collected by a technique such as warm water manufacture from the<br>
viewpoint of effective energy utilization. As a result, the methane fuel battery utilization also needs to<br>
use thermal energy.<br>
[0004] In the acid generating step in anaerobic fermentation, on the other hand, a fermentation gas<br>
mainly composed of hydrogen has been known to occur. Hydrogen is quite useful, since it is not<br>
problematic in terms of thermal energy like methane. For example, hydrogen is advantageous in that<br>
no reforming reaction is necessary when used in a fuel battery, so that a large part of generated<br>
hydrogen can be fed to the fuel battery and converted into electric power. Hence, a technique for<br>
generating a fermentation gas mainly composed of hydrogen and a fermentation gas mainly composed<br>
of methane separately from each other at the time of anaerobic fermentation has been proposed (see, for<br>
example, Patent Documents 1,2, and 3).<br>
[Patent Document 1 ] Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. SHO 61 -8200<br>

[Patent Document 3] Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2003-135089<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problem to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0005] However, even the above-mentioned conventional methods are not easy to perform hydrogen<br>
fermentation smoothly at a practical level. Namely, it has been reported that there are cases where<br>
biomasses to become materials contain contaminant bacteria such as lactic acid bacteria other than<br>
hydrogen-generating bacteria, and these contaminant bacteria inhibit the hydrogen fermentation (Noike<br>
et al., Inhibition of hydrogen fermentation of organic wastes by lactic acid bacteria, International<br>
Journal of Hydrogen Energy, Vol. 27, pp. 1367-1371,2002).<br>
[0006] As a method overcoming this problem, the above-mentioned Patent Document 3 discloses a<br>
method of inactivating hydrogen fermentation inhibiting bacteria in a material by subjecting a biomass<br>
to be hydrogen-fermented to a heating/warming process beforehand. However, thermal energy is<br>
necessary for such a heating/warming process, whereby it does not become a fundamental solution.<br>
Patent Documents 1 and 2 do not mention the above-mentioned problem at all. Namely, the first object<br>
of the fermenting process for collecting an energy gas from a biomass employed as a material is to<br>
process wastes or waste water of the biomass. Therefore, the process must decompose the biomass so<br>
as to reduce its volume greatly and lower the load due to the waste water. In this operation, because of<br>
characteristics of waste processing and waste water processing, an excess of energy input for the<br>
operation and process greatly lowers the processing efficiency and remarkably deteriorates the industrial<br>
usefulness.<br>
[0007] In view of such circumstances, it is an object of the present invention to provide a production<br>
method of a biogas, which can sufficiently smoothly perform hydrogen fermentation or hydrogen<br>
fermentation and methane fermentation when using a hydrogen-fermenting microorganism to carry out<br>
the hydrogen fermentation from an organic matter such as a biomass as a material or when carrying out<br>
the methane fermentation after the hydrogen fermentation, without subjecting the material to a<br>
treatment of the material involving consumption of thermal energy such as heating/warming.<br>
Means for Solving the Problem<br>
[0008] The inventors conducted diligent studies in order to achieve the above-mentioned object and,<br>
as a result, have initially found that whether the hydrogen generation by a hydrogen-fermenting<br>
microorganism and growth of the hydrogen-fermenting microorganism or the growth of a<br>
microorganism group such as lactic acid bacteria which adversely affects the hydrogen fermentation and<br>
fermentation by the microorganism group become dominant depend on the concentration of a<br>
predetermined substrate contained in a liquid to be processed. Further studies based on this finding<br>
have revealed that the above-mentioned problem is overcome when the concentration of the substrate in<br>
the liquid to be processed is kept within an appropriate range in practice according to a correlation<br>
between the concentration of the substrate and the rate of consumption of the substrate by the hydrogenfermenting<br>
microorganism, whereby the present invention is achieved.<br>
[0009] Namely, the present invention provides a production method of a biogas, the method<br>
comprising a first step of determining, according to a correlation between a concentration of a<br>
predetermined substrate in a liquid to be processed containing an organic matter and a rate of<br>
consumption of the substrate by a hydrogen-fermenting microorganism, a maximum tolerable<br>
concentration of the substrate consumable by the hydrogen-fermenting microorganism; and a second<br>
step of generating a biogas mainly composed of hydrogen by causing the hydrogen-fermenting<br>
microorganism to hydrogen-ferment the liquid to be processed while keeping the substrate in the liquid<br>
to be processed at a concentration not higher than the maximum tolerable concentration.<br>
[0010] In the case where the maximum tolerable concentration of a substrate consumable by a<br>
hydrogen-fermenting microorganism is determined beforehand according to the correlation between the<br>
concentration of the substrate in a liquid to be processed containing an organic matter and the rate of<br>
consumption of the substrate by the hydrogen-fermenting microorganism, and the concentration of the<br>
substrate in the liquid is kept at a level not higher than the maximum tolerable concentration when<br>
performing hydrogen fermentation in practice as such, the organic matter, which is a material, is<br>
predominantly consumed by the hydrogen-fermenting microorganism, whereby the growth of<br>
microorganisms (contaminant microorganisms) such as lactic bacteria adversely affecting the growth or<br>
activity of the hydrogen-fermenting microorganism and their resulting fermentation are sufficiently<br>
suppressed. Therefore, the present invention can sufficiently prevent the contaminant microorganisms<br>
from inhibiting the hydrogen fermentation without a treatment of the material involving consumption of<br>
thermal energy such as heating/warming, whereby the hydrogen fermentation can be performed<br>
sufficiently smoothly.<br>
[0011] Preferably, in the present invention, the substrate to become an index of the hydrogen<br>
fermentation is a glucide. Using a glucide as an index, determining its maximum tolerable<br>
concentration, and keeping the glucide concentration at a level not higher than the maximum tolerable<br>
concentration when performing the hydrogen fermentation in practice as such can more reliably prevent<br>
contaminant microorganisms from inhibiting the hydrogen fermentation, whereby the hydrogen<br>
fermentation can be carried out more smoothly.<br>
[0012] Preferably, the production method of a biogas in accordance with the present invention further<br>
comprises a third step of generating a fermentation gas mainly composed of methane by causing a<br>
methane-fermenting microorganism to methane-ferment the fermented liquid after the hydrogen<br>
fermentation in the second step. When the fermented liquid after the hydrogen fermentation in the<br>
second step is subjected to methane fermentation, contaminant products are sufficiently restrained from<br>
inhibiting the methane fermentation. Therefore, a fermentation gas mainly composed of hydrogen and<br>
a fermentation gas mainly composed of methane can be generated separately and sufficiently smoothly.<br>
Also, providing the third step is quite useful in terms of reducing the volume of organic wastes,<br>
lowering the environmental load due to organic waste water, etc.<br>
[0013] The present invention provides a production method of a biogas, the method comprising the<br>
step of generating a biogas mainly composed of hydrogen by performing hydrogen fermentation while<br>
adding a hop or hop component to a liquid to be processed containing an organic matter so as to<br>
inactivate a contaminant microorganism inhibiting hydrogen generation without affecting a growth or<br>
activity of a hydrogen-fermenting microorganism.<br>
[0014] Hops and hop components have been known to exhibit antibacterial actions against wide<br>
ranges of microorganisms. For example, Simpson, WJ. et al. reported antibacterial activities against<br>
lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus brevis (Simpson, W.J. et al., Factors affecting antibacterial activity of<br>
hops and their derivatives, J. Appl. Bacteriol., vol. 72, pp. 327-334, 1992), whereas Plollach G. et al.<br>
reported that hop beta acid restrained microorganisms from generating lactic acid, nitrous acid, acetic<br>
acid, and butyric acid (Plollach G. et al., Einsatz von Hophenprodukten als Bacteriostaticum in der<br>
Zuckerindustrie, Zuckerindustrie, vol. 121, pp. 919-926, 1996; Hein, W. et al., Neue Erkenntnisse beim<br>
Einsatz von Hopfenprodukten in der Zuckerindustrie, Zuckerindustrie, vol. 122, pp. 940-949, 1997;<br>
Plollach, G. et al., Neue Erkenntnisse zur Losungmikrobieller Probleme in Zuckerfabriken,<br>
Zuckerindustrie, vol. 124, pp. 622-637, 1999). On the other hand, cases with resistivity were also<br>
reported, whereby effective functions have not always been established conventionally. For example,<br>
Simpson, W.J. et al. reported that genera Pediococcus and Lactobacillus exhibited hop resistivities<br>
(Simpson, W.J. et al., Cambridge Prize Lecture, Studies on the Sensitivity of Lactic Acid Bacteria to<br>
Hop Bitter Acids, J. Inst. Brew., vol. 99, pp. 405-411, 1993); Sami, M. reported that Lactobacillus<br>
brevis strain exhibited a hop resistivity (Sami, M., Lactic Acid Bacteria Deteriorating Beer, Journal of<br>
the Brewing Society of Japan, vol. 94, pp. 2-9, 1999); and so forth. The inventors studied this point<br>
and, as a result, have verified that appropriately setting conditions such as method of utilization and<br>
amount of use of a hop or hop component effectively suppresses the activity of microorganisms which<br>
adversely affect the activity of hydrogen-fermenting microorganisms and does not inhibit the growth<br>
and activity of the hydrogen-fermenting microorganisms, whereby the possibility of effectively utilizing<br>
the hop or hop component in hydrogen fermentation has been clarified. The above-mentioned<br>
production method of a biogas sufficiently prevents contaminant microorganisms from inhibiting<br>
hydrogen fermentation without performing a treatment of the material involving consumption of<br>
thermal energy such as heating/warming, thereby making it possible to carry out hydrogen fermentation<br>
sufficiently smoothly.<br>
Effect of the Invention<br>
[0015] As mentioned above, according to the present invention, when using a hydrogen-fermenting<br>
microorganism to carry out the hydrogen fermentation from an organic matter as a material, the<br>
hydrogen fermentation can be performed sufficiently smoothly without a treatment of the material<br>
involving consumption of thermal energy such as heating/warming.<br>

Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0018] In the following, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be explained in detail.<br>
[0019] Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing an example of biogas production apparatus preferably used<br>
in the present invention. The apparatus shown in Fig. 1 comprises a hydrogen fermentation tank 1 and<br>
a methane fermentation tank 2, thereby carrying out hydrogen/methane two-stage fermentation by a<br>
continuous operation.<br>
[0020] The hydrogen fermentation tank 1 is provided with a line LI, whereas a liquid to be processed<br>
containing an organic matter is fed to the hydrogen fermentation tank 1 by way of the line LI. The<br>
liquid to be processed is not limited in particular as long as it contains an organic matter which can be<br>
hydrogen-fermented by a hydrogen-fermenting microorganism. The hydrogen fermentation tank 1 is<br>
useful for processing biomasses such as organic wastes and organic waste water in order to acquire<br>
energy gasses from reusable organic resources among others, and is preferably employed for processing<br>
beer brewery waste water, bakery wastes, etc. in particular.<br>
[0021] A hydrogen-fermenting microorganism is contained in the hydrogen fermentation tank 1. The<br>
hydrogen-fermenting microorganism performs hydrogen fermentation from the organic matter in the<br>
liquid to be processed. Examples of the hydrogen-fermenting microorganism include anaerobic<br>
microorganisms such as Clostridia, Methylotrophs, Methanogens, Rumen Bacteria, and Archae bacteria;<br>
facultative anaerobic microorganisms such as Escherichia coli and Enterobacter; aerobic<br>
microorganisms such as Alcaligenes and Bacillus; photosynthetic bacteria; and Cyanobacteria. The<br>
hydrogen-fermenting microorganism may be either an isolated microorganism or a mixed<br>
microorganism group (microflora) suitable for hydrogen production. For example, the hydrogen<br>
fermentation by an anaerobic microorganism group can be performed by supplying an organic material<br>
such as a biomass to a fermentation tank containing a hydrogen-fermenting microorganism under a<br>
condition with a pH of about 6.0 to 7.5 and a temperature of about 20° to 70°C. When hydrogen<br>
fermentation is effected by such a hydrogen-fermenting microorganism, a fermentation gas (biogas)<br>
mainly composed of hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) occurs, while organic acids such as acetic<br>
acid, butyric acid, and lactic acid are generated. For example, glucose is decomposed by an action of a<br>
hydrogen-fermenting microorganism into acetic acid (CHsCOOH), hydrogen, and carbon dioxide<br>
according to the following expression (1):<br>
C6Hi2O6 + 2H2O -&gt; 2CH3COOH + 2CO2 + 4H2 (1)<br>
[0022] When causing the hydrogen-fermenting microorganism to perform hydrogen fermentation in<br>
the present invention, according to a correlation between the concentration of a predetermined substrate<br>
in the liquid to be processed and the rate of consumption of the substrate by the hydrogen-fermenting<br>
microorganism, a maximum tolerable concentration of the substrate consumable by the hydrogenfermenting<br>
microorganism is initially determined. Here, the substrate to become an index is not<br>
restricted in particular as long as it correlates with the hydrogen generation by the hydrogen-fermenting<br>
microorganism and the growth of the hydrogen-fermenting microorganism. A preferred substrate is a<br>
glucide.<br>
[0023] The "maximum tolerable concentration of the substrate" refers to the maximum value of<br>
concentration of the substrate allowing the substrate to be consumed predominantly by the hydrogenfermenting<br>
microorganism for the hydrogen fermentation. Namely, when the concentration of the<br>
substrate in the liquid to be processed in the hydrogen fermentation tank 1 is kept at a level not higher<br>
than the maximum tolerable concentration, the substrate is predominantly consumed by the hydrogenfermenting<br>
microorganism, whereby the hydrogen fermentation can be performed sufficiently smoothly.<br>
When the concentration of the substrate exceeds the maximum tolerable concentration, lactic acid<br>
bacteria and the like existing in the organic matter such as a biomass remarkably inhibit hydrogen<br>
fermentation activities, thereby suppressing the hydrogen generation or the growth of hydrogenfermenting<br>
microorganism.<br>
[0024] The maximum tolerable concentration of the substrate can be determined by the following<br>
procedure, for example. First, a plurality of liquids to be processed containing respective<br>
concentrations of a substrate different from each other are prepared, hydrogen fermentation is<br>
performed by using them, and amounts of hydrogen generation at that time are determined. The<br>
concentration of the substrate can be adjusted by changing the dilution ratio of the liquid to be<br>
processed, or adding the substrate to the liquid to be processed. When the substrate to become an index<br>
is a glucide, for example, the glucide concentration in the liquid to be processed can be enhanced if a<br>
polymer polysaccharide such as cellulose, hemicellulose, or starch; an oligosaccharide such as<br>
maltotriose, cellobiose, or cellotriose; a monosaccharide such as pentose or hexose; or the like is added<br>
thereto.<br>
[0025] Next, measured amounts of hydrogen generation are plotted against concentrations of the<br>
substrate, whereby a correlation curve of the substrate concentration vs. hydrogen generation amount is<br>
obtained. In this correlation curve, the hydrogen generation amount usually tends to increase as the<br>
substrate concentration increases, and decrease after attaining a maximum value at a certain<br>
concentration. Since the hydrogen generation amount depends on the rate of consumption of the<br>
substrate by the hydrogen-fermenting microorganism, the concentration yielding the maximum value of<br>
hydrogen generation amount in the correlation curve becomes the maximum tolerable concentration of<br>
the substrate.<br>
[0026] Adding a hop or hop component to the liquid to be processed here can effectively suppress<br>
activities of a microorganism group such as lactic acid bacteria which adversely affect the hydrogen<br>
fermentation. Antibacterial actions due to the hop or hop component do not affect activities of the<br>
hydrogen-fermenting microorganism. Therefore, the addition of the hop or hop component to the<br>
liquid to be processed can enhance the maximum tolerable concentration of the substrate, thereby<br>
further improving the efficiency at the time of performing the hydrogen fermentation in practice.<br>
While the liquid to be processed after the hydrogen fermentation (fermented liquid) is subjected to<br>
methane fermentation which will be explained later, the methane fermentation can be performed more<br>
smoothly if this fermented liquid contains a hop or hop component.<br>
[0027] Preferably employed as the hop or hop component are chemically modified hops such as hop<br>
strobiles, hop pellets, hop extracts, isomerized hop pellets, and tetrahydroisohumulones; hop a-acid; hop<br>
p-acid; and the like.<br>
[0028] According to thus determined maximum tolerable concentration, the hydrogen fermentation is<br>
performed in practice. Namely, the substrate concentration in the supplied liquid to be processed,<br>
respective rates at which the liquid to be processed flows in and out, etc. are adjusted such that the<br>
concentration of the substrate in the hydrogen fermentation tank 1 is not higher than the maximum<br>
tolerable concentration, and a hop or hop component is further added thereto if necessary, whereby the<br>
hydrogen fermentation is performed by the hydrogen-fermenting microorganism. When the organic<br>
matter as a material has the same quality, and fermentation conditions such as temperature and pH<br>
within the hydrogen fermentation tank are unchanged, the amount of growing microorganism existing<br>
in the hydrogen fermentation tank is substantially held constant. In continuous operations, the liquid to<br>
be processed is continuously fed to the hydrogen fermentation tank while being continuously discharged<br>
therefrom, whereby it is desirable that the liquid to be processed be continuously supplied while taking<br>
account of the flow-in and flow-out of the liquid to be processed, the consumption of the organic matter<br>
(or substrate) by microorganisms, etc. Using microorganism immobilization can make the<br>
microorganism keeping amount substantially constant without being influenced by fluctuations in the<br>
material concentration (i.e., substrate concentration) of the liquid to be processed within the hydrogen<br>
fermentation tank (fermented liquid) or fluctuations in the rate at which the liquid to be processed flows<br>
in or out.<br>
[0029] The material balance within the hydrogen fermentation tank 1 in a continuous operation can be<br>
represented by the following expression (2):<br>
V(dS/dt) = FS0 -FS- V(- dS/dt)c (2)<br>
[0030] In expression (2), V is the volume of the liquid to be processed in the hydrogen fermentation<br>
tank, S0 is the substrate concentration in the liquid to be processed flowing in, and dS/dt is the amount<br>
of fluctuation in substrate concentration per unit time. Subscript C indicates that (-dS/dt)c is the<br>
amount of fluctuation due to the consumption by microorganisms. F is the rate at which the liquid to<br>
be processed is supplied and the rate at which the fermented liquid flows when a fixed volume operation<br>
is assumed. Namely, the left side of expression (2) is the amount of fluctuation in substrate<br>
consumption per unit time per fermentation tank, the first term on the right side is the amount of the<br>
substrate flowing in, the second term on the right side is the amount of the substrate flowing out, and the<br>
third term on the right side is the amount of consumption of the substrate by microorganisms.<br>
[0031] In a fermentation operation of generating an energy gas from a biomass, it is important to<br>
maximize the energy gas generation rate per fermentation tank. In this regard, from the viewpoint of<br>
fermentation rate, it is desirable that the microorganism keeping amount in the fermentation tank be<br>
made as large as possible, and that the fermentation tank volume be utilized as much as possible.<br>
When the fermentation operation is regulated at a predetermined temperature and a predetermined pH,<br>
the rate at which the substrate is consumed by microorganisms depends on the microorganism keeping<br>
amount in the fermentation tank assuming that there are no disturbing elements such as mingling of<br>
toxic matters and lack of essential nutrients, whereby the third term on the right side, i.e., V(-dS/dt)c, is<br>
kept at a value as large as possible in practice. Examples of techniques for holding the microorganism<br>
keeping amount in the fermentation tank as much as possible include a process of immobilizing<br>
microorganisms in a microorganism carrier; and a process of forming flocculating microorganism<br>
masses, and filling the fermentation tank with them or floating them therein. Though there is a<br>
technique in which microorganisms are grown and kept at a high concentration in a floating state<br>
without immobilizing them, the microorganism concentration is susceptible to the flow-in of the<br>
material liquid and the rate at which the fermented liquid flows out, whereby it is desirable to employ a<br>
microorganism immobilizing technique.<br>
[0032] In a fermenting operation of producing an energy gas from a biomass or the like, it is important<br>
in terms of apparatus efficiency that that the biomass, which is a fermentation material, to be processed<br>
stably for a long period, so as to produce a fermentation gas stably. Further, from the viewpoint of<br>
waste water processing and the like, the load concentration in the effluent must be kept from fluctuating.<br>
Therefore, it is not desirable for variable terms on the left side of expression (2) to fluctuate unstably, so<br>
that zero-fluctuation operations are important.<br>
[0033] Here, keeping the biomass material concentration such that the biomass material is not used for<br>
the growth and fermentation of the microorganism group such as lactic acid bacteria is synonymous<br>
with keeping the substrate concentration S in the effluent at a level not higher than the maximum<br>
tolerable concentration.<br>
[0034] When the fluctuation on the left side is set to zero according to the view mentioned above,<br>
expression (2) can be rewritten as expression (3 a) or (3b):<br>
(S-S.)/(-dS/dt\=V/F (3a)<br>
F = rx(-ds/dt)e/(s-s.) (3b)<br>
[0035] Assuming that V and (-dS/dt)c are constant since they should be as large as possible and held<br>
constant as mentioned above, it will be sufficient if the material liquid supply and the fermented liquid<br>
flow-out rate F are calculated from the right side of expression (3b) with respect to the substrate<br>
concentration So in the flow-in material liquid in order to keep the substrate concentration S in the<br>
effluent at a predetermined level and operate the substrate consumption variable term per fermentation<br>
tank (left side of expression (2)) so as to prevent it from fluctuating.<br>
[0036] Performing the hydrogen fermentation by the hydrogen-fermenting microorganism as such<br>
generates a fermentation gas (biogas) mainly composed of hydrogen and carbon dioxide, and produces<br>
an organic acid such as acetic acid, butyric acid, or lactic acid. Thus generated biogas is taken out of<br>
the hydrogen fermentation tank 1 by way of a line L2. Though the biogas can be used in a fuel battery<br>
or the like while still in a mixed gas of hydrogen and carbon dioxide, a film separator equipped with a<br>
palladium film which passes hydrogen there through and blocks carbon dioxide may be used so as to<br>
isolate and collect hydrogen with a high purity from the mixed gas. Highly pure hydrogen can also be<br>
obtained by causing the mixed gas to pass through an alkali solution and making the alkali solution<br>
absorb carbon dioxide. On the other hand, the processed liquid (fermented liquid) containing the<br>
organic acid after the hydrogen fermentation is transferred to the methane fermentation tank 2 by way of<br>
a line L3, so as to be subjected to methane fermentation.<br>
[0037] The methane fermentation tank 2 contains a methane-fermenting microorganism. A methanefermenting<br>
microorganism group is usually an ecosystem in which a plurality of species of methanegenerating<br>
bacteria exist. When various methane-generating bacteria such as Methanobacterium,<br>
Methanobrevibacter, Methanosarcina, Methanothrix, Methanogenium, and Methanoculles are allowed<br>
to live in this ecosystem, methane generation can be performed efficiently. As a consequence, the<br>
liquid to be processed (fermented liquid) transferred to the methane fermentation tank 2 after the<br>
hydrogen fermentation is decomposed into methane and carbon dioxide. Providing a methane<br>
fermentation step after a hydrogen fermentation step as such is quite useful from the viewpoints of<br>
reducing the volume of organic wastes, lowering the environmental load due to organic waste water, etc.<br>
in addition to the fact that methane can be obtained as an energy gas.<br>
[0038] The liquid to be processed (fermented liquid) subjected to the methane fermentation preferably<br>
contains a hop or hop component. The fermented liquid containing a hop or hop component is<br>
preferable since it can effectively suppress activities of microorganisms which may inhibit the methane<br>
fermentation caused by the methane-fermenting microorganism. When a hop or hop component is<br>
added to the liquid to be processed at the time of hydrogen fermentation, the hop or hop component is<br>
brought into the methane fermentation tank 2 together with the liquid to be processed. However, a hop<br>
or hop component may newly be added to the liquid to be processed when the latter is transferred to the<br>
methane fermentation tank 2.<br>
[0039] The biogas generated by the methane fermentation is a mixed gas of methane and carbon<br>
dioxide, and is taken out of the methane fermentation tank 2 by way of a line L4. Though the biogas<br>
can be utilized as an energy gas while still in the mixed gas of methane and carbon dioxide, a film<br>
separator which passes methane there through but not carbon dioxide or an alkali solution absorbing<br>
carbon dioxide or the like can yield methane with a high purity. On the other hand, the fermentation<br>
liquid residue after the methane fermentation is discharged from the methane fermentation tank 2 by<br>
way of a line L5. The fermentation liquid residue is one having sufficiently reduced its volume or<br>
detoxified.<br>
[0040] The present invention is not restricted to the above-mentioned embodiment. For example,<br>
though the above-mentioned embodiment includes a step of determining the maximum tolerable<br>
concentration of the substrate consumable by the hydrogen-fermenting microorganism according to the<br>
correlation with the rate at which the substrate is consumed by the hydrogen-fermenting microorganism,<br>
this step is not always necessary when a hop or hop component is added to the liquid to be processed.<br>
Namely, by adding a hop or hop component into the liquid to be processed containing an organic matter<br>
and deactivating contaminant microorganisms inhibiting hydrogen generation without affecting the<br>
growth or activity of the hydrogen-fermenting microorganism, the present invention can effectively<br>
generate a biogas mainly composed of hydrogen.<br>
[0041] Though the above-mentioned embodiment relates to hydrogen/methane two-stage fermentation<br>
by a continuous operation, the fermenting/cultivating operation of the hydrogen-fermenting<br>
microorganism may be not only a continuous operation but also a batch operation, a semibatch<br>
operation, and the like. The semibatch operation is an operation in which a specific limiting substrate<br>
is supplied to a reactor whereas the aimed product is not taken out until a harvest. This operation is<br>
also known as feeding. The batch operation and semibatch operation are favorable in terms of keeping<br>
the material concentration within an appropriate range, since the substrate concentration in the<br>
fermentation material liquid is easily calculated from the added liquid amount, the substrate<br>
concentration in the added liquid, the culture liquid amount in the fermentation tank, and the substrate<br>
concentration in the liquid. In the continuous operation, the fermentation material liquid is<br>
continuously supplied, while the solution is continuously discharged from within the fermentation tank,<br>
whereby the fermentation material liquid is required to be supplied continuously while taking account<br>
of the flow-in, flow-out, and material consumption by microorganisms. In general, the purpose of<br>
fermentation for collecting an energy gas from a biomass as a material is waste processing of biomasses<br>
such as organic resource wastes and organic waste water or waste water processing, whereby the<br>
continuous operation is rational in terms of apparatus operating efficiency.<br>
Examples<br>
[0042] In the following, the present invention will be explained more specifically with reference to<br>
Examples, which do not restrict the present invention at all.<br>
[0043] [Hydrogen Fermentation Inhibiting Action by Lactic Acid Bacteria]<br>
Example 1<br>
Sludge collected from an anaerobic sludge bed was acclimated in beer brewery waste water (with a pH<br>
of 4, COD of about 15000, glucide concentration (calculated as glucose) of 4000 to 5000 mg/L, a lactic<br>
acid concentration of about 4000 mg/L, and an acetic acid concentration of about 100 mg/L) at 50°C,<br>
and methane-fermenting microorganisms were eliminated therefrom, so as to accumulate an acidgenerating<br>
fermenting microorganism group capable of performing hydrogen fermentation. Using thus<br>
accumulated microorganism group as an inoculum, continuous fermentation fed with beer brewery<br>
waste water as a fermentation material liquid was performed for about 1 month. The continuous<br>
fermentation was carried out under a condition of pH 6.0 to 6.5 at 50°C. Fig. 2 shows the correlation<br>
between the number of days of fermentation and the hydrogen and carbon dioxide concentrations in the<br>
fermentation gas. The organic acid generated at the time of hydrogen fermentation was mainly<br>
composed of about 1000 mg/L of acetic acid, about 2000 mg/L of butyric acid, and about 200 mg/L of<br>
lactic acid. The fermented liquid was collected from a continuous fermentation tank, and was<br>
cultivated at 50°C in a culture medium in which the beer brewery waste water was solidified with agar,<br>
whereby several species of microorganism colonies were detected as dominant species in the culture<br>
liquid. Eight species of microorganisms predominant in the colonies were cultivated in an agar culture<br>
medium for anaerobic fermentation, and base sequences of genes in grown colonies were analyzed,<br>
whereby five out of the eight species were microorganisms of genus Clostridium. The same eight<br>
species of microorganisms were cultivated in an agar culture medium for detecting lactic acid bacteria<br>
(modified GAM culture medium available from Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), but no lactic acid<br>
bacteria were grown.<br>
[0044] Comparative Example 1<br>
After 20 g of glucose (made by Wako Pure Chemical Industries), 3 g of yeast extract (made by DIFCO),<br>
g of peptone (made by DIFCO), 3 g of malt extract (made by DIFCO), and 5 g of NaHCO3 (made by<br>
Wako Pure Chemical Industries) were dissolved in 1 L of tap water, the resulting solution was subjected<br>
to steam sterilization at 121 °C for 15 minutes, whereby a fermentation material liquid was prepared.<br>
The fermentation material liquid was inoculated with a culture liquid which had been obtained by<br>
continuously fermenting the beer brewery waste water for 1 month under the condition of pH 6.0 to 6.5<br>
at 50°C as a fermentation material liquid in Example 1, and batch fermentation was repeated for 24<br>
hours each at 50°C. About 60% of hydrogen and about 40% of carbon dioxide were obtained in the<br>
first batch fermentation, about 50% of hydrogen and about 50% of carbon dioxide were obtained in the<br>
second batch fermentation, and about 35% of hydrogen and about 65% of carbon dioxide were obtained<br>
in the third batch fermentation, whereby the hydrogen production rapidly decreased. The amounts of<br>
generation of acetic acid, butyric acid, and lactic acid were analyzed before the fermentation and at the<br>
respective times when the first, second, and third batch fermentation sessions of the fermentation liquid<br>
material ended, whereby lactic acid was found to increase in the third batch fermentation as shown in<br>
Table 1. The microorganism group in the third batch cultivation was anaerobically cultivated at 50°C<br>
in an agar culture medium comprising glucose, yeast extract, peptone, malt extract, and NaHCOa (the<br>
fermentation liquid material having 15 g of agar added thereto), whereby several species of<br>
microorganism colonies were detected as dominant species. Nine species of microorganisms<br>
predominant in the colonies were cultivated in an agar culture medium for detecting lactic acid bacteria,<br>
and base sequences of genes of grown colonies were analyzed, whereby it was found that, of the nine<br>
species, two species were Lactococcus lactis, two species were Enterococcus faecalis, and one species<br>
was a species related to Enterococcus avium or the like. This indicated that the increase in the lactic<br>
acid bacteria group and the suppression of hydrogen generation occurred in conjunction with each other.<br>
(Table Removed)  [0046] Comparing Example 1 and Comparative Example 1 with each other showed that<br>
predominantly growing microorganism groups varied when properties of materials differed from each<br>
other even if the same inoculum was used. These two kinds of material liquids greatly differed from<br>
ASeach<br>
other in terms of glucide concentration. Namely, it was suggested that predominantly growing<br>
microorganism species influenced the glucide concentration of fermented liquids.<br>
[0047] [Hydrogen Fermentation Using Beer Brewery Waste Water]<br>
Example 3<br>
While changing the dilution ratio of a material liquid prepared by adding an easily assimilatable glucide<br>
composed of maltose and starch to beer brewery waste water, hydrogen fermentation by a continuous<br>
operation was performed with the same culture liquid as that of Example 1 as an inoculum.<br>
[0048] First, when the hydrogen fermentation was carried out with a glucide concentration of about<br>
10000 mg/L in the material liquid and a dilution ratio of 1.0/d in the continuous fermentation (days 1 to<br>
7), the glucide concentration in a hydrogen fermentation tank became stable in the vicinity of 800 mg/L,<br>
and the hydrogen fermentation underwent steadily. Thereafter, when the glucide concentration of the<br>
material liquid was set to about 22000 mg/L whereas the dilution ratio was 0.4/d (days 8 to 13), the<br>
hydrogen fermentation still underwent steadily although the glucide concentration in the hydrogen<br>
fermentation tank slightly rose to about 1000 mg/L. When the dilution ratio was set to 1.2/d in the<br>
material liquid having about the same glucide concentration (days 14 to 17), the glucide concentration<br>
in the hydrogen fermentation tank became about 3800 mg/L, and the amount of hydrogen generation<br>
decreased drastically. Namely, when the glucide in the hydrogen fermentation tank was left without<br>
being consumed completely, the amount of hydrogen generation decreased, and the lactic acid<br>
concentration increased. Fig. 3 shows the correlation between the number of days of fermentation and<br>
the hydrogen and carbon dioxide concentrations in the fermentation gas in the above-mentioned<br>
hydrogen fermentation. Table 2 shows the glucide concentration of the material liquid, dilution ratio,<br>
glucide concentration in the hydrogen fermentation tank, and concentrations of organic acids (acetic<br>
acid, butyric acid, and lactic acid) in each period. In Table 2, the glucide concentration and organic<br>
acid concentration in the hydrogen fermentation tank in each period are their central values. This result<br>
showed that the hydrogen fermentation was kept smoothly within the range where the glucide<br>
concentration in the hydrogen fermentation tank did not exceed 4000 mg/L.<br>
 [0050] [Hydrogen Fermentation Using Bread Bakery Waste]<br>
Example 4<br>
Using liquids in which bread bakery wastes were suspended in water at various concentrations as a<br>
material, continuous hydrogen fermentation was performed under the condition of pH 6.0 to 6.5 at 50°C<br>
with the same culture liquid as that of Comparative Example 1 as an inoculum.<br>
[0051] First, when the hydrogen fermentation was carried out with a glucide concentration of about<br>
11000 mg/L in the material liquid and a dilution ratio of 0.7/d in the continuous fermentation (days 1 to<br>
6), the glucide concentration in the fermentation tank was 3000 to 4000 mg/L, whereby the hydrogen<br>
fermentation was performed steadily. Next, when a material liquid with a higher bread bakery waste<br>
concentration (glucide concentration of about 35000 mg/L in the material liquid) was supplied (days 7<br>
to 12), the hydrogen generation occurred vigorously until 8 days after the higher concentration material<br>
liquid supply; on day 9 and thereafter, the amount of hydrogen generation decreased, and the lactic acid<br>
concentration rose. In the fermentation period where the hydrogen fermentation was performed<br>
smoothly without decreasing the amount of hydrogen generation (days 1 to 6), the glucide concentration<br>
in the fermented liquid was 3000 to 4000 mg/L. Fig. 4 shows the correlation between the number of<br>
days of fermentation and the hydrogen and carbon dioxide concentrations in the fermentation gas in the<br>
above-mentioned hydrogen fermentation. Table 3 shows the glucide concentration of the material<br>
liquid, dilution ratio, glucide concentration in the hydrogen fermentation tank, and concentrations of<br>
organic acids (acetic acid, butyric acid, and lactic acid) in each period. This elucidated that the<br>
hydrogen fermentation could be maintained smoothly when the material concentration in the supplied<br>
material liquid was held appropriately in the hydrogen fermentation tank.<br>
(Table Removed)  [0053] Thus, hydrogen fermentation can be maintained smoothly when a substrate concentration, a<br>
glucide concentration in particular, in a fermentation tank is used as an index, and a material liquid is<br>
supplied such that this index is adjusted so as to fall within a favorable range. Specifically, when the<br>
glucide concentration in the fermented liquid in the fermentation tank is kept at 4000 mg/L or lower in<br>
the case of hydrogen-fermenting microorganisms based on beer brewery waste water and bread bakery<br>
wastes, lactic acid bacteria groups remarkably inhibiting the hydrogen-fermenting microorganisms can<br>
be restrained from predominantly increasing, whereby the hydrogen fermentation can be maintained<br>
smoothly.<br>
[0054] Examples<br>
While controlling the material liquid supply rate in conformity to changes in the glucide concentration<br>
in the fermentation material liquid and keeping the glucide concentration at 3000 mg/L in the hydrogen<br>
fermentation tank, hydrogen fermentation was performed under a condition of pH 6.0 to 6.5 at 50°C.<br>
Specifically, continuous fermentation was initially performed for about 1 month with the same culture<br>
liquid as that of Comparative Example 1 as an inoculum in a material liquid (whose total glucide<br>
concentration was 10710 mg/L to 18390 mg/L) prepared by adding maltose and starch to beer brewery<br>
waste water in order to enhance the microorganism concentration in the fermentation tank. Thereafter,<br>
using material liquids prepared by adding maltose and starch to the beer brewery waste water or<br>
material liquids in which bread bakery wastes were suspended in water at various concentrations,<br>
continuous hydrogen fermentation in which the liquid supply rate was controlled so as to keep a<br>
glucide concentration in the fermentation tank was performed. In the fermentation of about 1<br>
month carried out before performing the continuous fermentation with controlled liquid supply rate, a<br>
value of about 7500 mg/L/day was obtained as the glucide consumption capacity (-dS/dt)c of this<br>
fermentation system. This value was used for determining a control value for material liquid supply<br>
rate in expression (3b). Since the glucide concentration in the fermentation tank was required to be<br>
about 4000 mg/L or less in order to keep hydrogen fermentation as evidenced by Examples 3 and 4, the<br>
control glucide concentration S in the fermentation tank was set to 3000 mg/L. Using these values and<br>
the supplied material liquid glucide concentration, a control index value for the rate at which the<br>
material liquid was supplied to the fermentation tank was calculated by expression (3b). Table 4 shows<br>
control index values for material liquid glucide concentrations. In the hydrogen fermentation with the<br>
controlled material liquid supply rate, continuous fermentation was performed 4 days for a material<br>
liquid, and then was continuously switched to material liquids with different concentrations. Table 4<br>
shows the values at 3 and 4 days after switching the material liquids. The actual dilution ratios in Table<br>
4 are values calculated from actual material liquid supply amounts. The glucide concentration in the<br>
fermentation tank was near an initial target of 3000 mg/L, and the amount of hydrogen generation was<br>
substantially proportional to the amount of glucide consumption. This showed that the hydrogen<br>
fermentation was maintained smoothly.<br>
Example 6<br>
After 20 g of glucose (made by Wako Pure Chemical Industries), 3 g of yeast extract (made by DIFCO),<br>
5 g of peptone (made by DIFCO), 3 g of malt extract (made by DIFCO), and 1 g of hop pellets (Hop<br>
Pellets Type 90 manufactured by Botanix) were dissolved in 1 L of tap water, thus obtained solution<br>
was subjected to steam sterilization at 121°C for 15 minutes, whereby a fermentation material liquid<br>
was prepared. Subsequently, the fermentation material liquid was inoculated with the same culture<br>
liquid as that of Comparative Example 1 as an inoculum, batch fermentation at 50°C was repeated eight<br>
times for 24 hours each. As a result, the fermentation gas composition was composed of about 53% of<br>
hydrogen and about 40% of carbon dioxide in all the batch fermentation sessions, whereby hydrogen<br>
production was maintained. When compositions of organic acids generated at that time were analyzed,<br>
no great changes were seen in eight batch fermentation sessions (Table 5). Though the glucide<br>
concentration in the fermented liquid was high, contaminant microorganism groups did not increase in<br>
the hydrogen fermentation, whereby the hydrogen fermentation was not obstructed. This elucidated<br>
that, unlike Comparative Example 1, the addition of the hop component inhibited activities of<br>
microorganism groups having adverse affects of suppressing the growth or hydrogen generation of<br>
hydrogen-fermenting microorganisms, but did not obstruct activities of the hydrogen-fermenting<br>
microorganisms.<br>
 [0058] Example<br>
The fermented liquid of Example 6 was collected, and its bitterness (defined by European Brewery<br>
Convention, Analytica-EBC 4th ed., p. El37,1987) was measured. The bitterness was about 13. This<br>
elucidated that the hop component inhibited activities of microorganism groups suppressing the growth<br>
or hydrogen generation of hydrogen-fermenting microorganisms at a bitterness near 13, but did not<br>
obstruct the activities of the hydrogen-fermenting microorganisms.<br>
[0059] Example 8<br>
A hop component was added to the culture system of Example 4 having drastically reduced the amount<br>
of hydrogen generation, so as to restore its hydrogen generation.<br>
[0060] Specifically, a material liquid having reduced the glucide concentration of the supply liquid<br>
was initially supplied to the culture system of Example 4 from day 13, and an operation was performed<br>
for 3 days (days 13 to 15). However, this operation did not restore the hydrogen fermentation, whereby<br>
the amount of hydrogen gas generation did not recover. Therefore, on day 16, hop pellets (Hop Pellets<br>
Type 90 manufactured by Botanix) were added to the fermentation tank and the supply liquid by 1 g per<br>
1 L of the fermented liquid. The hydrogen production exhibited a tendency to recover on day 17 and<br>
thereafter, and was restored to the level at the time of starting the higher concentration material liquid<br>
supply on day 20 (Fig. 6). On day 19 and thereafter, the generated organic acid composition was<br>
/<br>
restored to the level at the time of starting the higher concentration material liquid supply (Table 6).<br>
This elucidated that a hop as pellets at a concentration of 1 g per 1 L of fermented liquid inhibited<br>
activities of unfavorable microorganism groups suppressing the growth or hydrogen generation of<br>
hydrogen-fermenting microorganisms, but did not obstruct activities of the hydrogen-fermenting<br>
microorganisms.<br>
 [0062] Example 9<br>
For various hop components, effects of smoothly maintaining hydrogen fermentation were investigated.<br>
[0063] After 35 g of glucose (special grade reagent made by Wako Pure Chemical Industries), 3 g of<br>
yeast extract (made by DIFCO), 5 g of peptone (made by DIFCO), 3 g of malt extract (made by<br>
DIFCO), and at least one species of hop components shown in Table 7 were dissolved in 1 L of tap<br>
water, the resulting solution was subjected to steam sterilization at 121°C for 15 minutes, whereby<br>
fermentation material liquids A to F were prepared. On the other hand, fermentation material liquid G<br>
was made in the same manner except that no hop component was added.<br>
 [0065] Next, each of the fermentation material liquids A to G was inoculated with the same culture<br>
liquid as that of Example 1 as an inoculum, and batch fermentation was repeated four times for 24 hours<br>
each. Though the hydrogen production decreased while lactic acid increased in the sample to which no<br>
hop component was added, about 400 ml of hydrogen and about 350 ml of carbon dioxide were attained<br>
in all the batch fermentation sessions in the samples to which hop components were added without<br>
lowering the hydrogen production (Fig. 7). Lactic acid did not increase in any of the samples to which<br>
hop components were added (Table 8). This elucidated that, except for the beta acid exhibiting no<br>
bitterness, an amount of addition of hop components by a bitterness of 10 or greater inhibited activities<br>
of microorganism groups having adverse affects of suppressing the growth or hydrogen generation of<br>
hydrogen-fermenting microorganisms, but did not obstruct activities of the hydrogen-fermenting<br>
microorganisms. At an amount of addition of 10 jiL per 1 L of fermented liquid, the beta acid was<br>
found to inhibit activities of microorganism groups having adverse affects of suppressing the growth or<br>
hydrogen generation of hydrogen-fermenting microorganisms, but did not obstruct activities of the<br>
hydrogen-fermenting microorganisms<br>
 [0067] Example 10<br>
It was also found that subjecting a fermented liquid after hydrogen fermentation of a biomass material<br>
having a hop or hop component added thereto or contained therein to methane fermentation caused by a<br>
methane-fermenting microorganism smoothly maintained the methane fermentation. This will be<br>
shown.<br>
[0068] The hydrogen fermentation effluent in which the hydrogen fermentation material containing<br>
hop pellets was supplied to the fermentation system of Example 1 in which the hydrogen fermentation<br>
was contaminated with microorganisms inhibiting the hydrogen fermentation and thus lowered the<br>
hydrogen production, so as to restore the hydrogen fermentation, was subjected to methane fermentation<br>
by methane-fermenting microorganisms, and it was tested whether the methane fermentation was<br>
maintained smoothly or not.<br>
[0069] First, the fermentation effluent in which hydrogen fermentation progressed normally without<br>
no hop component added thereto in Example 4 was subjected to methane fermentation under a<br>
condition of pH 7.0 to 7.5 at 37°C. Namely, using the effluents on days 5 and 6 of hydrogen<br>
fermentation in Example 4 as a hydrogen fermentation effluent (methane fermentation material liquid),<br>
the methane fermentation was performed. When supplying the material liquid to the methane<br>
fermentation, the dilution ratio was 0.43/d. Fig. 8 shows thus obtained results (days 5' and 6' in Fig.<br>
8).<br>
[0070] Thereafter, the hydrogen fermentation effluent after performing the hydrogen fermentation<br>
using the fermentation material liquid A of Example 8 (having hop pellets added thereto) was subjected<br>
to methane fermentation. Namely, using the effluents on days 16 to 21 of hydrogen fermentation in<br>
Example 8 as a hydrogen fermentation effluent (i.e., methane fermentation material liquid), the methane<br>
fermentation was performed. When supplying the material liquid to the methane fermentation, the<br>
dilution ratio was 0.40/d. Fig. 8 shows thus obtained results (days 16' and 21' in Fig. 8).<br>
[0071] As shown in Fig. 8, the methane fermentation caused by the methane-fermenting<br>
microorganism exhibited no abnormality in the amount of methane generation even when using the<br>
effluents obtained after performing the hydrogen fermentation by the hydrogen fermentation materials<br>
containing hop pellets. This has elucidated that methane fermentation caused by methane-fermenting<br>
microorganisms is smoothly maintained also when fermented liquid obtained after performing hydrogen<br>
fermentation with a biomass material having a hop or hop component added thereto or contained therein<br>
is subjected to the methane fermentation.<br><br><br><br><br>
