				<td>This invention relates to an improved private  combined<br><br>
voice,    fax   and,   data   telecommunications   network  (PVDTN)   system which   faci1itates<br><br>
voice, fax and data communications on a single network connecting an organization's  locations spread over a city, country, and the world, through analogue, digital, or a mixture of analogue and digital terrestrial leased lines, non-exchange leased lines or private wires, directionalised full duplex VHF,UHF radio links, multiple access radio relay (MARR), and point-to-point satellite links (used in case of long distance, inaccessible sites only).<br>
For setting up a Company's/Organization's integrated information system (IIS), based on mechanized data gathering (MDG) at al1 Company/Organization action points, a 100% secure, private communications back -bone is required.<br>
For this purpose, in the current state-of-the-art,  the following options are available at present:<br>
(i) voice over data private networks (VODPN) using digital leased lines and fixed channel voice-data multiplexers, data routers, etc:<br>
(ii)      private voice data telecom network PVDTN as  described in Indian Patent No.176287. The PVDTN system is capable of  setting  up voice/fax/data networks  over  analogue<br>
-1A-<br><br>
leased lines. It also mentions that when digital leased lines become available from DOT (Department of Telecommunications) and other PTT's (postage, telephone, and telegraph authorities) appropriate interfaces will be used to provide digital end—to—end connectivity, and eliminate the leased 1ine modems.<br>
The currently available trunk interfaces for ISDN (integrated services digital networks) compatiable EPAX s (electronic private automatic exchanges) which form the VDPS s (voice-data private switches) in the PVDTN system are either 2W or 4W, E&amp;M, analogue trunk cards, or 2 MBPS (mega bytes per second) digital trunk cards to CEPT specifications of 30B+2D channels- Each B channel has a line speed or bandwidth of 64 KBPS (Kilo bytes per second), and each D channel has a line speed or bandwidth of 16 KBPS. The CEPT cards are generally used for distribution of telephone connections to housing and commercial complexes  under the group dialing franchisee scheme  of  various<br>
PTT s.<br>
LIST OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>

Fig. 5 shows the multiple access facility of the local HOST/SERVER computer. Fig. 6 shows a fixed channel ADPCM multiplexer connectivity.<br>
DOT and other PTT s in the world are now making available digital leased lines in 64 KBPS, or multiples thereof. A 64 KBPS line is abouti.5 times more costly than an analogue leased line which has an effective data speed of 9.6 KBPS. A 128 KBPS line costs 1.8 times that of a 64 KBPS line. A 2 MBPS line costs 16 times the cost of a 64 KBPS line. To make any private network cost effective, it is therefore, necessary to make the best use of available bandwidth.<br>
3<br><br>
While such digital leased lines are available between most major cities and large industrial towns, they are stil1 not available for smaller towns which continue to be served by analogue transmission systems.<br>
 A trunk system has, therefore, been incorporated in the  present invention which will enable the PVDTN system to make effective use of the presently available 64 KBPS lines cost effectively- This comprises of analogue trunk cards of the VDPS s of the PVDTN system, which will terminate on multiple vocoders situated in ADPCM fixed channel multiplexers, the aggregate output of which will be connected to the 64 KBPS leased lines-Similar circuitry is employed on either end of all 64 KBPS circuits- This type of connection splits the 64 KBPS circuits into multiple channels for simultaneous communications in any combination of voice/fax/data. A maximum of eight channels are recommended, and can increase from 2,4,6, to 8- The larger the number of channels the lower the effective data speed. The number of channels a 64 KBPS is split into is, therefore, determined by the number of simultaneous channels required between any two locations and the acceptable data speeds on the universal switched channel.<br>
-4-<br><br>
  adding  such a trunk system to the  existing  PVDTN system, the following benefits will be derived.<br>
1.	For one 64 KBPS digital line between points A &amp; B,  the<br>
system  user  will  now have anything between  2  to  8<br>
simultaneous  channels of communication. The  more  the<br>
number  of channels the higher the set—up cost and  the<br>
lower the cost per channel, and the lower the  fax/data<br>
speed.<br>
2.	The cost per channel of communication works out to  be<br>
cheaper than the cost per analogue line.<br>
3.	Also the cost per channel, is cheaper than that for the<br>
type  of digital leased lines  envisaged in  the  PVDTN<br>
system of Indian Patent 176287.<br>
4.	The   system   user   can   now   have   simultaneous<br>
voice/fax/data communications between A and B locations<br>
even  on  a  64 KBPS leased  line  which  is  currently<br>
available at reasonable cost from various PTT s.<br>
5.	The tandem switching capability as claimed in the PVDTN<br>
system will with the help of this new universal channel<br>
multiplication  technique,  of the  present  invention,<br>
-5-<br><br>
facilitate simultaneous communications between A, 8, C, D, E, F, G, H, over the single digital link between A and 8, and the analogue connections between A to C, D, E and 8 to F, G, H, as shown in Fig. 2 of the accompanying drawings. This along with the inherent conferencing capability in the VDPS (which is an EPAX) will facilitate multiple group meetings over the PVDTN WAN through voice conferencing.<br>
6.	This new arrangement will, therefore, substantially reduce the cost of<br>
network build-up, compared to the present art of VODPN and also the PVDTN<br>
system described in Indian Patent No. 176267.<br>
7.	The existing practice of building voice over data private networks (VODPN s),<br>
using digital leased lines, voice-data multiplexers, data routers, etc., are<br>
fraught with some inherent defects.   Two types of multiplexers are in use.<br>
The fixed channel type has the problem that when any one channel either<br>
voice, or fax, or data, are not in use the bandwidth allocated to it lines idle<br>
and cannot be used for any other type of communication.  However, there is<br>
no inter-channel interference, and if the above limitation is acceptable then<br>
voice/fax/data communications can be integrated ..	<br>
6<br><br>
over a single network- To overcome the problem of wasted bandwidth, an adaptable bandwidth multiplexer was developed, but it brought with it the problem of inter—channel interference. Thus if voice is given a priority, and on—going data call gets interrupted as soon as a voice call is initiated. If data is given priority an on—going voice call gets chopped off as soon as a data call is initiated- If no priority is allocated chaos prevails- This type of multiplexer has, therefore, failed to integrate voice/fax/data on a single network, and those who had tried it, have had to abandon the concept of integration and have had to settle for separate voice and data networks.<br>
			Since in the present invention fixed channel multiplexers are being used, there is no inter—channel interference. And since by combining these with the VDPS, each fixed channel is suitable for either voice or fax or data communications, they are universal in nature. There is, therefore, no wasted bandwidth, as any free channel can be used for any type of communications switched through the VDPS- Thus true and<br>
	-7-<br><br>
unhindered integration of voice/fax/data takes place through a single leased line network.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates a fixed channel ADPCM multiplexer connectivity. The 4W, E&amp;M outputs of the ports in the voice cards or vocoders are connected to the 4W, E&amp;M ports of the trunk cards of the VDPS (voice-data private switch), The output of the digital I/O (input-output) cards are connected to the WAN port of the routers at each location.<br>
9.	The new common trunk system of present invention, therefore, gives major<br>
economic benefits, and technical advantages over the system of private voice and data telecommunications network of 176287; and combined with the latter it overcomes the deficiencies of the existing voice over data private networks using digital leased lines only, voice-data multiplexers, data routers,etc. Since it also uses both analogue and digital leased lines, its reach is greater. It can connect any location in the world, irrespective of its distance and/or remoteness.<br>
10,	Since analogue trunk cards are used as standard in the VDPS, where<br>
analogue lines are availabe, these are directly terminated on these trunk<br>
cards.<br>
In the PVDTN system of of 176287, the data connectivity is through<br>
switched universal channels which are suitable for either voice, or fax, or data<br>
communications, alternately, with automatic switching between the different<br>
modes of communication	<br>
S<br><br>
through the VDPS. Where the volume or frequency of data communications is high, such as the railway reservation system, the airline ticketing system, banks for ATM networks, etc, such universal switched connections may not always be conducive to efficient functioning. For such applications, continuous non-switched data connections between LAN buses at either end of the line may be desired.<br>
In the present invention an arrangement has, therefore, been made to by-pass the VDPS at each location and terminate a 1ine directly on the WAN (wide area network) ports of data routers sitting on the LAN (local area network) buses at either end of the line- This can be done by segregating a part of the bandwidth of a digital 64 KBPS line, in the fixed channel ADPCM multiplexer through a data I/O (input/output) card, and terminating this on the data router WAN port, by—passing the VDPS at either end; or through a separate analogue leased line terminating on the WAN ports of the data routers at both ends of the line, by—passing the VDPS at either end, where digital leased lines are not available. The arrangement is shown in Fig.4.<br>
         Because of this feature the system can now provide  the<br><br>
			flexibility  of  the universal switched  data  connectivity,  for<br><br>
normal data communications volumes and frequencies, and fixed non-switched data pipe connectivity for high volumes or frequencies of data communications. The multiple universal channels which forms the switched data connectivity between locations, or the fixed data pipes, both working through the IP routed network,allows people at different locations to log-on to the same data base simultaneously, through remote-access. This combined with the voice conferencing facility in the VDPS facility, facilitates voice-data conferencing in accordance with the present invention.<br>
In the PVDTN system of 176287, digital extensions can have data connectivity with same type of extensions within the domain of the same VDPS. Also analogue and long line analogue extensions can have data connectivity with similar extensions. The present system does not provide for analogue or long line analogue extensions to have data connectivity with digital extensions in the same VDPS domain. When the system of Patent 176287 was conceived, this was not important, as the comparatively slower speeds of dial-up modems precluded the use of analogue or long line analogue extensions for LAN application. For LAN application, only digital extensions were contemplated. The higher modem speeds and the lower costs of such modems, now available, make analogue extensions usage in LANs a distinct possibility, hence interconnection between digital and both types of analogue extensions for data assumes prime importance.<br>
A trunk loop back system, has, therefore, been used, which will make the<br>
desired data connectivity between analogue and digital extensions of the same<br>
VDPS,possible. This is shown	<br>
10<br><br>
in  Fig- 3- This arrangement will give the following benefits  to the PVDTN system of 176287.<br>
(i)       It  will  facilitate use of  analogue  and  long  line analogue extensions of the VDPS s in making up the  LAN with the help of the low cost high speed dial—up modems now available.<br><ii the more costly digital extensions will be used for larger distances where cost of cabling justifies use a single shielded twisted pair cable and voice telephone simultaneous connectivity in lan.></ii><iii this new innovation will therefore reduce the cost of lan build up in system and facilitate peer to computer connectivity between analogue digital extensions same vdps.></iii>
Larger organizations/companies have many locations in the same city or town. If there is a private network, then these locations need to be included in the network, through a metropolitan area network, with voice/fax/data connectivity. For such connections currently there are two options.<br>
-11-<br><br>
1.	A  digital leased line with  voice—data  multiplexers,<br>
data routers, etc, connecting the additional  locations<br>
to  the main network of the city as is done  for  voice<br>
over data private networks (VODPN s).<br>
2.	Auxiliary VDPS s situated at  the  additional  locaions<br>
connected  to  the main VDPS in the  city/town  through<br>
analogue or digital lines, or alternatively, individual<br>
non—exchange  leased lines connecting  telephones,  fax<br>
machines,  and computers through dial—up modems to  the<br>
long—line  extensions of the central VDPS in each  city<br>
or town up—to a distance of about 15 Kms. In the latter<br>
system, there could be a breach of security as the long<br>
line  extensions  move through  the  Main  Distribution<br>
Frames   (MDF  s)  of various exchanges  and  could  be<br>
tapped with the help of unscrupulous PTT staff.<br>
Both   the  above  options  are  cost   intensive,<br>
particularly  the first, making the voice data metropolitan  area network VDMAN configurations non—viable.<br>
To   provide  a  cost   effective   voice/fax/data metropolitan  area  connectivity, a system has,  therefore,  been<br>
12<br><br>
incorporated comprising of long line analogue extensions, analogue subscriber carrier system (ASCS), and non-exchange leased lines or private wire, as shown in Fig, 4 which provides the following benefits to the patented private voice data telecommunications network system of 176287, and in combination, with the latter produces a VDMAN solution which is much lower in cost than the voice over data private network (VODPN) system referred to in option 1 above .The ASCS can only be used if a copper wire connection is available between the two locations, mainly within the same exchange domain. However, in modern day telephone systems exchange to exchange connectivity is no longer through copper cable, but through carriers like cable PCM, digital microwave links, fibre optic links. For this the two wire long line extensions have to be converted to 2W E&amp;M lines for signal enabling through the carrier system through line conversions equipment, and re-converted back at the other end through 2W, E&amp;M to 2W line conversion equipment.<br>
The new VDMAN solution will provide the following benefits.<br>
(i) A single non-exchange line hired from the PTT facilitates up-to eight long line extensions of the central WPS in each city/town to be connected to telephones, fax machines, and computers through dial-up modems, at the remote location of the Company/Organization in the same city/town, through the analogue subscriber system (ASCS). The telephones, fax machines, and computers situated in the remote location have simultaneous access to the VDPS at the central location and through it to the rest of the network.<br>
13<br><br>
(ii) Since the ASCS puts the signals of the eight long line extensions through a common carrier tapping of the non-exchange leased line through norma1 methods will not help the tapper to listen to or obtain anything other than carrier noise. This ensures and preserves the 100%. security of the network.<br>
(iii)     Since one non—exchange line takes care of  eight  long line extensions at the remote end, the cost of  setting<br>
up  the network and operating it is  considerbly  lower<br>
than  what would be incurred in the system  of  176287,<br>
and  substantially lower than the connectivity  through the voice over data private network (VODPN) system.<br>
(iv)      This new arrangement, therefore, reduces the  cost  of metropolitan  area network  build-up  for   integrated voice/fax/data networks,  and provides much greater flexibility in total network design.<br><br>
In  the  PVDTN system of 176287,  since  the  data<br>
connection is through serial ports, the maximum number of simultaneous access to a local host or server computer from any other computer  in  the network, was limited to  the number of<br>
-14-<br><br>
serial ports available in the host or server, and since these were limited to a maximum of eight (in Unix machines) or even less in the modern servers/hoste, the number of simultaneous multiple access to these machines from other computers in the network were limited,<br>
However, with INTRANET type operations, and ERP (enterprise resource planning) applications now emerging, multiple simultaneous access to local hosts/servers from any computer in the network has become essential.<br>
In view of this requirement, multiple simultaneous connectivity to local hosts/servers from computers in the network is now provided through oine terminal servers (LTS) whose serial ports will be connected to the VDP of the PVDTN network through analogue extensions and dial-up modems, or digital extensions and voice-data telephones with digital terminal interfaces (VDT s) and which will be connected to the HOST/server through the Ethernet/DEC net LAN buses. If more simultaneous accesses are required, a second or more LTS s is/are connected between the LAN buses and the VDPS of the location in the manner described above. In lieu of line terminal servers, multiple serial ports sitting on the PCI slot of the servers may also be used in a similar fashion.<br>
15<br><br>
This arrangement facilitates multiple simultaneous<br>
access to the Host/Server at each city/town from any computer in the VDLAN/VDMAN/across the voice data wide area network VDWAN.<br>
The  inventive  feature described herein  and  the<br>
Figs.l to 5 of the accompanying drawings therefore bring about substantial improvements over the present art of voice over data private networks over digital leased lines (VODPN), and private voice—data telecom network system (PVDTN) of Indian Patent 176287, and provide major economic benefits and technical advantages to the prospective network users, over the currently known systems of the integrated voice and data private networks.<br>
