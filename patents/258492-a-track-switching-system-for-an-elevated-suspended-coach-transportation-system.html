PRIOR ART<br>
Transportation is a critical element in the smooth and efficient operation of almost every aspect of today's cities and urban areas. All over the world, the population is rising and the infrastructure development is not keeping pace. Roads are unable to handle the rising number of vehicles and metro rails face inadequacies in increasing the capacity, besides there is also the concomitant risk of vandalism and derailment. Expansions or new construction need land in urban areas, which is not possible; alternative underground railways are too expensive. As a result, many types of transportation systems have been developed to move people and cargo from one place to another more efficiently. The most prominent transportation systems are overland travel by cars and bogies, both operating on roads such as public highways. Public buses utilize the same highway network, as do, to some extent, cable cars and electric buses. Conventional high capacity urban transportation systems generally employ underground trains or streetcars moving along conventional rails. Such systems take up a considerable amount of space in the urban area and do not allow the individual cars to be separately directed. Subways,<br>
2<br><br>
monorails, and trains, however, utilize a rail network that is typically less developed than the surrounding highway networks. Other forms of inter-city transportation include the bicycle, auto rickshaws, scooters and motor cycles, all of which use the same roads. Consequently the roads are unable to handle the rising number of vehicles.<br>
Public buses also utilize the highway network, but are far less popular than cars. Buses are less favored than cars because a passenger often has to wait at a bus stop for a relatively long period of time and in potentially disagreeable weather. Further, buses are generally restricted to particular routes, and consequently a bus rider must walk, or acquire other transportation, to and from bus stops along various routes proximate to his origination and destination. Frequently, transfers must be made from one bus to another due to inadequate routes, and frequent interim stops must be made to load or unload other passengers. Still further, buses are subject to many of the same drawbacks as the car, such as traffic, stop lights, and traffic risk. As a result, buses are not as popular as the car even though, when properly utilized, buses are more efficient and less environmentally harmful than the cumulative effect of so many individual cars.<br>
Rail-guided vehicles, such as trains, monorails, metro-rails and subways, are an alternative transportation system found in many cities and urban areas. When properly utilized, such systems are more energy efficient than cars and less environmentally damaging. However, many of the same drawbacks exist for rail guided vehicles as for buses. For example, rail guided vehicle users are dependent upon predetermined and often inadequate schedules, a limited number of fixed routes, and lost time due to stops at intermediate stations for<br>
3<br><br>
other passengers. Even the relatively high speeds attained by rail-guided vehicles do not fully compensate for the time lost in other ways when using such transportation systems. Surface railway is impossible to lay in an existing city. But even to lay the same in a new development is subject to negative implications. The development remains divided by the corridor and it a permanent noise polluter. Disgorging of heavy loads of commuters at stations creates needless congestion on the roads reducing the quality of life. Several thousands of persons die annually because of trespassing or failing from trains. In addition derailments, collisions and capsizing cause serious damage to life, limb and property.<br>
Underground railway is less invasive on the surface but still poses technical challenges including the management of fires and evacuation. If road vehicles are involved in inter-modal transfers, it becomes a weak link in the chain of transport between walking and the railway.<br>
Elevated railway technically cannot reach congested central busy roads where mass transport is needed. It is too invasive and may require dislocation of some  portions   of the   habitat  as  well   as  the   system   is   very  noisy.<br>
Consequently, cities and urban areas have been plagued by the problems associated with having private cars as the primary mode of civilian transportation. A person will readily spend hours in heavy traffic either because there is no alternative, or because any available alternatives require more time and inconvenience. Moreover, the pollution created by millions of private cars is having a deleterious effect on the environment and quality of civilian life, not only in urban areas but in the surrounding rural areas as well.<br>
4<br><br>
The cumulative energy wasted at traffic signals and in traffic is considerable, and causes a direct increase in fuel costs and other costs associated with vehicular transportation. The energy required to accelerate a car that weighs several thousand kilograms is frequently converted into little more than friction within the car's braking system at the next traffic light. This is a considerable amount of wasted energy since the average human occupant in a typical car represents a mere 5% of the gross vehicle weight. Still further, dependence upon extremely large amounts of gasoline or diesel to power a large automotive transportation system makes such a society somewhat vulnerable    to    the    whims    of   those    who    possess    these    reserves.<br>
Clearly, then, there is a need for a civilian transportation system that is able to compete with the car in terms of convenience to the user, but does not require the tremendous energy consumption of an automotive transportation system. Further, such an improved transportation system should provide increased safety expectations, less overall cost to the user, and profitability to those manufacturing, owning, and operating such a system. All administrations are in search of an economical viable solution to the transportation problem, which is concomitantly environment-friendly.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a more versatile urban transportation system that has hitherto been impossible using systems of the prior art.<br>
5<br><br>
The present invention relates to a novel suspended coach rail transportation system.<br>
Specifically, the present invention relates to a means of improving the running of suspended coach rail transportation systems and more specifically, methods, means and devices for enabling the safe and swift changing of tracks on line of the suspended coaches .without any derailment of the bogie by external forces acting upon the bogie and to provide improved tractive capability.<br>
Single supporting rail suspended monorail systems have been built in the past. The potential of high-speed operation requires that the attitude of the cars is securely controlled and capsizing of the coaches and derailment of the bogies carrying the cars be prevented.<br>
It is also envisaged that the coaches and therefore the train will be switched from one track to the other particularly in arcuate switch mode.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The principal objective of the present invention is to provide a suspended coach transportation system that includes a bogie, that can operate inside a continuous box type elevated closed horizontal beam having a slot in lower surface for the traverse of a suspended coach supported by suspenders extending from the beam, that will eliminate the possibility of derailment of the bogie due to forces acting upon the bogie. A very high speed, 100 KMPH to 200 KMPH, can be obtained.<br>
6<br><br>
In a supported rail track system, sllpers are connected between both rails. However in the suspended transport system there is no connection between the rails. This makes the conventional methods of switching tracks impossible, because of the presence of the suspension arrangement for the coaches, which is required to pass between both rails at all times.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a suspended transportation system comprising an extended continuous hollow box way having a slot throughout its operative under wall, said box way being elevated by columns from the ground level and generally following the lay of the ground; a pair of rails fixed on either side of the slot on the operative inner surface of the under wall within the extended box way and extending continuously throughout the box way; a plurality of bogie assemblies moving on the said rails within the box way secured to a floating beam located in the box way operative overhead of the bogie assemblies suspension means extending from the floating beams operatively downwards and through the slot in the box way; removably mounted coaches suspended from suspension means; and motor means to displace the bogie assemblies on the rails, said suspended transportation system having a switching arrangement for switching the coaches from a running track to a switched track , both tracks defined by a pair of rails, said switching means comprising two laterally displaceable track segments and means to displace the laterally displaceable track segments with respect to either the running track or the switched track to continue the running or the switched track in a predetermined arrangement.<br>
7<br><br>
The running track and the switched track may arcuately extend from each other, in which case the at least one segment of the laterally displaceable track segments are arcuate.<br>
The laterally displaceable track segments are displaced jointly. Particularly, the laterally displaceable segments may be moved in unison for high speed operations.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings in which<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of a suspended transportation system in<br>
accordance with this invention;<br>
Figure 2 is the side view of the running track and the switching track in<br>
accordance with this invention ; and<br>
Figures 3 to 7 illustrate the plan view of the track switching arrangement in<br>
accordance with this invention in different operative configurations.<br>
The transportation system generally indicated by the reference numeral 10 comprises an extended continuous hollow box way 12 having a slot 14 throughout its operative under wall. Columns 16 elevate the box way 10 from the ground level and generally following the lay of the ground. A pair of rails 18 are fixed on either side of the slot 14 on the operative inner surface of the under wall within the extended box way 12. The rails extend continuously throughout the box way. A plurality of bogie assemblies 20 move on the said rails 18 within the box way 12.<br>
8<br><br>
Removably mounted coaches 24 are suspended from suspension means 26 extending through the slot 14 in the box way 12. The bogie assemblies 20 are generally connected to the coach suspension means 26 in a manner that permits controlled longitudinal, swinging and angular displacement of the coaches 24 and their suspension means.<br>
The box way 12 is a concrete box way and an array of central columns 16 support two extending box ways on either side of the columns as seen in FIG. 2. These box ways 12 permit traverse of suspended coaches along the box ways on either side and alongside of the columns.<br>
Since the rails need to be continuous, it is not ordinarily possible to switch coaches from one track 18 to the other track 19 as seen in figure 2 . The tracks 18 and 19 are shown as adjacent tracks in figure 2 but may practically be remotely located and not joined as shown in figure 2.<br>
Figures 3 to 7 illustrate the scheme for switching a bogie from one track to another.<br>
As seen in the figures the main line is represented by reference numeral M. The main line extends at the switch to two sections SI and S2. In position seen in figure 3, a train will travel along section SI, whereas in position seen in Figure 4, the train will travel along section S2. The arrangement at the switch S permits therefore the switching of the train from the main Line M to sections SI to S2. Therefore the rail segments along sections S 1 and S2 are continuous with the rails of the main line M alternately. In figure 3 the rails of section S1 are continuous with the main line rail M, whereas in position ,<br>
9<br><br>
seen in figure 4 the rails of section S2 are continuous with the main line rail M. This not only permits trains from the main line to traverse the side lines/branched lines but also trains alternately from the side lines to enter the main line.<br>
The switch has laterally displaceable Track segments Tl and T2 as seen in figures 3 and 4. The track segments Tl and T2 are displaced laterally to be aligned with the main line rails one track segment at a time to enable a train to traverse from the main line to section S 1 as seen in figure 3 or along side line S2 as seen in figure 4. As seen in figures 3 and track segment SI is straight and track segment S2 is arcuate. Therefore at the switch shown in figures 3 and 4 SI represents a continuity of the main line M whereas S2 is in reality the side line which branches of from the main line.<br>
The reverse is shown in figure 5 where from the main line M at the switch is composed of track segments T3 and T4, where T4 is straight and T3 is arcuate leading to Side sections S3 and S4.<br>
In figures 6 and 7 side sections S5 and S6 both branch off from the main line M and therefore both track segments T5 and T6 are arcuate and match the profile of the sections to form contiguous but curved take offs from the main line M so that a train can travel on either one of the branched side lines S5 or S6 or travel from the side lines S5 and S6 on to the main line M.<br>
These displacements may be locally or remotely controlled. The lateral displacement of the elements are synchronous.<br>
10<br><br>
Additional reinforcements of the column and box ways may be provided to accommodate the switch in accordance with this invention.<br>
Aligning means including fine running means may be provided between the main line rails and the section line rails.<br>
Different means may be needed for synchronization of the movement of the switch to optimize the response time of the switching action of the device in accordance with this invention .<br>
In view of the wide variety of embodiments to which the principles of the present invention can be applied, it should be understood that the illustrated embodiments are exemplary only. The illustrated embodiments should not be taken as limiting the scope of the present invention. For example, the interactions between the components may be taken in sequences other than those described, and more or fewer elements may be used . While .various elements of the preferred embodiments have been described as being implemented , other embodiments implementations may alternatively be used, and vice-versa.<br>
