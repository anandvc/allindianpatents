				<td>The invention relates to an apparatus for continuously recycling of synthetic plastics material, preferably polyester, comprising a first receptacle for the material, in which receptacle movable tools are disposed which comminute and/or mix the material, and from which the so processed material is transported through a vacuum-tightly closable conduit into a second receptacle, to the interior of which an evacuating device is connected and in which also movable tools are provided for processing the material, wherein that material is conveyed off the second receptacle by means of a screw.<br>
An apparatus of initially described kind is known (AT 396,900 B). In this apparatus, the material is comminuted and mixed within the first receptacle-and is pressed by the circulating tools into the conduit leading to the second receptacle. The second receptacle is evacuated in order to protect the material that is sensitive against air contact when heated and in order to decrease the drying time. The pre-processed synthetic plastics material flowing within the channel towards the second receptacle indeed acts almost tightening, however, cannot completely prevent air streaming from the first receptacle into the second receptacle. A completely tight closure of the second receptacle would, indeed, be possible by a closure means disposed within the channel, but then a continuous operation of the apparatus is no more possible.<br>
The invention has as its object to improve an apparatus of the initially described kind so that a continuous operation is possible and also a sufficient vacuum-tightness of the second receptacle. Thereby, the processed material should beireated gently, in particular a degradation of the chains of the^olocuis^should be prevented as far as possible. The invention solves this task in that a screw is bearingly supported within the conduit, the volutions of this screw conveying the material from the first receptacle into the second receptacle, wherein between these screw volutions and the second receptacle at least one damming, element is provided within the conduit and disposed within the flow of the conveyed material. This damming element results in an intensive compression zone for the plastics material that is sufficiently vacuum-tight without that the continuous operation of the apparatus is impeded.<br>
It is known (ATE 128,898 T) to dispose a screw in a channel connecting two chambers disposed one behind the other, when seen in flow direction of the processed material. However, within this apparatus, the second chamber is not evacuated and the apparatus does not operate continuously because the screw is rotated only when in the first chamber predetermined conditions of the material are reached. Therefore, with such an apparatus material that is sensitive against air, in particular polyester, cannot be treated successfully.<br><br>
-2-<br>
Within the spirit of the invention, important advantages are obtained if the screw is an agglomerating screw, because in such a manner the highly sensitive agglomerated synthetic plastics material, in particular polyester, can be obtained with a good quality. When compared with apparatus plasticizing the material, with an agglomerating apparatus only so much power is introduced into the processed synthetic plastics material which mostly is introduced into the intake opening of the housing of the agglomerating screw in a pre-comminuted form, that the particles of the synthetic plastics material are only slightly caked, but are not plasticized. Therefore, as to say, the several particles of the synthetic plastics material adhere to each other or the synthetic plastics material is sintered, and, therefore, material that is at loose as possible, is supplied to the second receptacle.<br>
As it is known, within an agglomerating screw the ratio of effective screw length to the nominal diameter of the screw is less than 16. Within the spirit of the invention particular favourable values for this ratio are between 4.5 and 12. By "effective length" of the agglomerating screw that distance is to be understood which is between the downstream-side end of the screw and that margin of the intake opening to which the material is supplied into the housing of the screw, that neighbours this end. Further, within an agglomerating screw, the screw volutions in the delivery zone (that is the zone neighbouring the exit opening for the material) are cut deeper than within a plasticizing screw. Within the latter, the ratio between the depth of the screw volutions and the screw outer diameter usually amounts to about 0.05 to 0.08, whereas within an agglomerating screw this ratio, as a rule, amounts to about 0.1 to 0.12.<br>
Within the spirit of the invention, a damming element can be constructed in different manners: According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the damming element is formed by screw volutions, the direction of their threads being opposite to those of the volutions of the screw. This inversely directed volutions, therefore, have a conveyance effect that acts opposite to that of the screw, however is overcome by the latter. In such a manner, the processed material is dammed up in the zone of this reverse screw. The above mentioned effect can be secured in a simple manner by the feature that - when measured in axial direction of the conduit - the screw is longer than the oppositely directed volutions and/or that the volutions of the screw are cut deeper than the oppositley directed volutions.<br>
Another particular favourable construction for the damming element consists within the spirit of the invention in that the damming element is constituted by a member having a rib that is disposed cross-wise, in particular perpendicularly, to the flow direction of the material. Such a member acts in a similar manner damming on the material conveyed by the screw, in particular, if two or more ribs are provided. In order to obtain favourable flow conditions, it is suitable to provide at least two ribs having a rounded profile and disposed one behind the other, when seen in flow direction of the material.<br><br>
-3-<br>
The said reverse screw can be rotated by a separate drive means so that the desired conveyance direction (opposite to that of the screw) is obtained. However, if within the spirit of the invention, the damming element is connected for common rotation with the screw, such a separate drive means can be saved, if the volutions of the oppositely acting reverse screw are correspondingly directed. A damming member having ribs can be disposed stationarily within the conduit, however it is to be preferred that also such a damming element is rotated, in particular by connecting it for common rotation with the screw, because in such a manner it is not necessary to abut the damming element relative to the conduit walls.<br>
The damming element is preferably tapered at its downstream-side end in order to collect the material traces flowing along its periphery or along its volutions. If the conduit is connected excentrically, if desired tangentially, to the wall of the second receptacle, what is particularly suitable within the spirit of the invention, then a particular favourable embodiment consists within the spirit of the invention in that the profile of the taper of the damming element follows substantially the profile of the wall of the second receptacle in the zone of the connection of the conduit. This ensures conditions as smooth as can be at the inner wall of the second receptacle in which the material is circulated by the circulating tools. The so created mixing zone is not impaired by this construction.<br>
By assembling and service reasons it is suitable to dispose the damming element within a housing member forming an own section of the channel, that housing member being detachably, however tightly, connected to the housing of the screw. The tight connection is necessary in order to take up the high pressures occurring in the zone of the conduit, without any loss, which pressures can reach 300 bar and more. If the damming element is constituted by a member carrying ribs, then it is suitable within the spirit of the invention to cut the volutions of the agglomerating screws deeper than the smallest dimension of the gap occurring between the periphery of the ribs of the damming element and the inner wall of the conduit, when measured in radial direction. As it can be seen, the damming element must not be formed radially symmetric to the axis of the conduit, on the contrary, it may have also the form of a toothed wheel, most of the material passing the damming element through its tooth spaces.<br>
As already mentioned, some of the materials to be recycled, in particular polyester, are very sensitive to humidity, when heated. In order to avoid that such material is adversely affected by its processing within the first receptacle, within the spirit of the invention also the first receptacle is closed vacuum-tightly and is connected to an evacuating device. The tight connection of the filling opening of this receptacle can be obtained by a sluice operating substantially continuously, for example, a cellular wheel sluice or the like, in order to enable a continuous filling of the receptacle.<br>
As a rule, the intake opening of the housing of the screw carrying the processed material off the second receptacle, is disposed at least substantially at the level of the<br><br>
-4-<br>
tools circulating within this receptacle, in order to optimally utilise the centrifugal action acted by these tools onto the material as well as a spatula-like pressing-in of the material exerted by the tools. Within such an embodiment, however, it is suitable within the spirit of the invention to dispose the mouth of the conduit in the second receptacle higher than the orbit of the tools circulating within the bottom region of this receptacle around at least one vertical axis. This avoids that material particles, which were not fully pre-processed within the first receptacle, are immediately introduced in the housing of the output screw by the circulating tools when such particles enter the second receptacle, so that such particles do not remain sufficiently long within the second receptacle. However, it is desired that the material particles remain for a predetermined time within the second receptacle by reasons of sufficient drying of humid particles or particles containing moisture. The described higher disposition of the intake opening within the second receptacle has the effect that the material particles entering the second receptacle are taken along by the material stream exerted by the tools circulating within the receptacle. This material stream has the effect that the particles rise along the receptacle wall so that particles entering this receptacle are at first taken along and moved to above and only then - after a certain dwell time - can reach the zone of the intake opening of the delivery screw. This meets the requirement to keep particles that are as loose as possible within the second receptacle as long as possible under elevated temperature and under vacuum. The comminuting action onto the partially sintered particles entering the second receptacle is favoured within the spirit of the invention if in addition to the tools circulating in the bottom zone of the second receptacle further tools, perferably coaxially disposed tools, in particular beating elements, are provided, the orbit of which is higher disposed than that of the tools disposed within the bottom zone of the receptacle. Suitably, the orbit of these further tools is disposed at the level of the mouth of the channel in the second receptacle.<br>
Further features and advantages of the invention can be seen from the specification of embodiments of the .subject matter of the invention which are schematically shown in the drawings. Fig. 1 shows a vertical section through the apparatus along the line I - I of Fig. 2, which shows a section along the line II - II of Fig. 1. Fig. 3 shows the damming element in form of a reverse screw in a horizontal section and in an enlarged scale and Fig. 4 shows in a similar manner a variant.<br>
Within the embodiment according to Figs. 1, 2 and 3, the material to be processed, for example polyester, but, if the occasion should arise, also polyamides and other hygroscopically sensitive plastics materials or such materials which are sensitive to oxygen introduced through a filling hopper 1 into the first receptacle 2 that is rotationally symmetrical to a vertical axis and has a planar horizontal bottom 3 and vertical side walls 4. In order to be able to process the material within the receptacle 2 under vacuum, the intake opening 5 can be vacuum-tightly closed by a closure gate 55. For evacuating the receptacle 2 there is provided an evacuating device 6 that has a vacuum pump connected<br><br>
-5-<br>
via a line 7 to the receptacle 2. Tools 9 mounted on a disk 8 circulate in the bottom region of the receptacle around the vertical axis of the receptacle and are driven for rotational movement via a shaft 10 by a motoM-1. The shaft 10 intersects the-bottom 3 of the receptacle 2 and is vacuum-tightly sealed by means of a sealing 12. An opening 13 is provided in the side wall 4 of the receptacle 2, through which the material processed within the receptacle 2 reaches into the housing 14 of a screw 15. For this, the centrifugal action exerted by the circulating tools 9 onto the material within the receptacle 2 is made use of, and additionally the tools 9 may press the material into the opening 13 in a spatula-like manner. The screw 15 may be, but not neccessarily, an agglomerating screw, that means, that the depth of the screw volutions 52 within the delivery zone, therefore in the region of the mouth of the housing 14, is greater than within a usual plasticizing screw, and that the ratio between the effective length of the agglomerating screw and its nominal diameter is less than 16, preferably between 4.5 and 12. In the embodiment shown this ratio amounts to about 6.6. As Fig. 2 shows, the screw 15 has a core diameter that continuously increases in conveyance direction at Jeast over a section of its axial length, so that the depth of its screw volutions 52 decreases in that direction, in order to increase the pressure exerted onto the material conveyed by the screw in conveyance direction. The screw is driven for rotational movement around its axis by a motor 16 via a gear means 17! The housing 14 of the screw forms a conduit 18 via which the material is conveyed by the screw 15 from the first receptacle 2 into the second receptacle 19. The mouth 20 of the conduit 18 positioned in the vertical side wall 21 of the receptacle 19 constitutes an intake opening for the pre-processed material and is disposed higher than the orbit of tools 22 circulating in the second receptacle 19 around its vertical axis. These tools are mounted in a similar manner as within the first receptacle 2 on a disk 23 driven for rotational movement by a motor 26 via a shaft 25 intersecting the bottom 24 of the receptacle 19. A sealing 27 seals the shaft 25'vacuum-tightly with respect to the bottom 24. For processing the material within the receptacle 19 also under vacuum, also this receptacle 19 can be evacuated, and for this serves an evacuating device 28, the vacuum pump of which is connected via a line 29 to the receptacle 19.<br>
For discharging the readily processed material out of the second receptacle 19, a screw 30 is tangentially connected to this receptacle, and the material is pressed from the receptacle 19 through an opening 32 into the housing 31 of the screw by the centrifugal action exerted onto the material by the tools 22. As within the receptacle 2, also here this pressing-in can be assisted by a spatula-like action of the tools 22, and for this the tools 9, 22 each are provided with working edges 33'(Fig. 2) angularly bent with respect to the radial direction opposite to the direction of circulation (arrows 34). The screw 30 is driven by a motor 36 via a gear means 35. Its housing 31 is suitably provided on its outside with resistance heating means 37 so that the material conveyed by the screw 30 can be kept<br><br>
-6-<br>
at the desired temperature. The conveyance direction of the screw 30 is indicated by an arrow 38.<br>
At that end of the screw 15 that neighbours the mouth 20, a damming element 39 is disposed within the conduit 18, that dams up the material conveyed by the screw 15, so that the pressure onto the material is increased over the axial length of the damming element 39. This axial length is small, when compared with the axial length of the screw 15, in the example shown it amounts to about one ejghth of the latter. This increased pressure acting onto the material has the effect that the conduit 18 is reliably vacuum-tightly sealed, so that also in case the vacuum within the first recepiacle 2, for whatever reasons, should be cancelled, the vacuum within the second receptacle 19 remains unchanged. This is of importance in order to maintain optimal operation conditions within the receptacle 19 when particles of synthetic plastics material, for example polyester or polyamide, for example for the production of agglomerate, are processed that are sensitive to moisture or oxygen when heated.<br>
Within the embodiment shown in Figs. 1 to 3, the damming element 39 is formed by screw volutions 40 disposed at the outlet end of the member forming the screw 15, which volutions, therefore, are of one-single piece with the screw 15. however, show a direction of the thread pitch that is opposite to that of the screw 15. Therefore, when the screw 15 is rotated, these screw threads 40 try to convey the material in direction towards the opening 13 of the housing 14, therefore in a direction opposite to the direction of conveyance of the screw 15. The substantially greater axial length of the screw 15, when compared with the axial length of the damming element 39, has the effect, however, that the conveyance action of the screw volutions 40 is overcome by the conveyance action of the screw 15, however, the first-named conveyance action increases the pressure onto the material in the zone of the damming element 39.The thus further compressed material is pressed along the screw threads 40 in direction towards the mouth 20 of the conduit 18, or, respectively, the material is pressed past the screw threads 40, that means, that the screw threads 40, as to say, are "overrun", if these screw threads, as it is shown-in Fig. 3, have a smaller outer diameter than the screw threads 52 of the screw 15. Alternatively, if both kinds of screw threads have the same outer diameter, the inner diameter of the housing 14 could oe correspondingly increased in the zone of the damming element 39, however, the first-named variant is to be preferred by constructional reasons.<br>
It would be possible to constitute the member forming the damming element 39 as a member that is separated from the screw 15 and to rotate the damming element by an own drive means, for example by means of an axial rod intersecting the core of the screw 15, which core is formed as a hollow shaft. However, the constructional effort is much less if either the damming element 39 is formed in one single piece with the screw 15, or indeed as a  member being separated from the  screw  15,  however,  connected for<br><br>
-7-<br>
common rotation therewith. The latter variant has the advantage that the damming element 39 that constitutes a member subjected to extreme high stresses, can be separately exchanged, in particular for service or replacement purposes. In order to facilitate this work, also the section of the housing 14 surrounding the damming element 39 is constituted by a separate member 41 (Fig. 3) that is detachably, however tightly, connected with the remaining section of the housing 14. The tight connection is necessary with respect to the desired air-tight closure and also by the reason that the high pressures {up to 300 bar and more) occurring within the channel 18 must be taken up without that leakage occurs at the connection location.<br>
As Fig. 3 shows, that front end of the damming element 39 that neighbours the mouth 20 of the conduit 18, is tapered. This taper 51 has the effect that, on the one hand, the material traces flowing past the damming element 39 in the zone of its periphery are collected and, on the other hand, the profile is adapted to the profile of the side wall 21 of the receptacle 19. This results in the advantage that the sintered particles can be kept small in size and that the circulation movement of the plastics mass driven by the tools around the receptacle axis is obstructed as less as possible in the zone of the mouth 20.<br>
A variant for this is shown in Fig. 4. Here, the damming element 39 is formed by a member 42 connected to the front side of the screw 15, which member has two ribs 43 disposed across the flow direction of the conveyed material and having a rounded profile, the greatest diameter of these ribs being somewhat less than the inner diameter of the housing 14 or of the section 41 connected to it. Also such a damming member 39 dams up the synthetic plastic material flowing past its outer periphery and condenses thereby the material so that a vacuum-tight closure is obtained. The taper 51 of the damming element 39 has the same effect as it was described in connection with Fig. 3.<br>
A further variant consists in that at least one damming disk disposed across the axial direction of the screw 15 is used as the damming member 39.<br>
As Fig. 1 shows, the mouth 20 of the channel is disposed spaced apart above the orbit of the tools 22 within the receptacle 19. Thereby it is avoided that a material particle that-leaves the mouth 20 of the conduit 18 is immediately conveyed into the intake opening 32 of the housing 31 of the discharge screw 30 by the circulating tools 22, so that the particle does not remain sufficiently long within the receptacle. 19 in order to be sufficiently dried. To the contrary, the particle discharged from the mouth 20 is taken along by the material flow rising along the side wall 21 of the receptacle 19 and is conveyed towards the inner zone of the receptacle (see the arrows 44 in Fig. 1). Therefore, there occurs the desired turbulance of the particles within the receptacle 19. This can still be increased if further circulating tools 45, preferably in form of striking elements, are disposed spaced above the tools 22, preferably at the level of the mouth 20 of the channel 18, which further tools are driven by an upwardly extending elongation of the shaft 25 via a carrier star 46.<br><br>
-8-<br>
Also the housing 14 of the screw 15 and/or the housing member 41 accommodating the damming element 39 may be provided with heating devices 48, preferably in form of resistance heatings. However, it is advisable to cool the screw 15 and the member disposed at its front end and formed as a damming element 39, because these elements are subjected to high stresses and, therefore, to heat influence. For this, the core of the screw 15 and, if desired, also the member 42 have a central bore 49 (Fig. 3) into which a cooling line 47 extends. Cooling can be effected by means of a heat transfer oil, cooling water or air. By a thermostat control of this cooling and/or of the heating devices 48, 37, the desired temperatures of the screws 15, 30, of the damming element 3&amp; and of the material conveyed by these elements can be kept constant.<br>
The screw 30 at the outlet of the second receptacle 19 may be an extruder screw, if desired, however, also a mere conveyor screw supplying the material to a further processing location or to a location where the material is made use of. Suitably, degassing devices (not shown) are provided within the housing 31 of this screw 30.<br>
It is particularly favourable to connect the housing 31 of the screw 30 tangentially to the second receptacle 19, because in such a manner the motor 36 and the member 50 (Fig. 2) carrying the outlet openings for the material can be disposed at opposite front ends of the housing 31. This avoids discharge openings disposed laterally on the housing 31, resulting in a deviation of the material and, therefore, a power loss. Of course, however, the housing 31 may be, if desired, also connected radially or excentrically to the receptacle 19, and also it is possible to connect the housing 14 of the screw 15 to the first receptacle 2 not tangentially, as this is shown in Fig. 2, but radially or excentrically with respect to the receptacle 2.<br><br>

The invention relates to an apparatus for continuously recycling of synthetic plastics material, preferably polyester, comprises a first receptacle (2) for the material in which tools (9) are disposed which comminute and/or mix the material by their motion. The pre-processed material is conveyed from this receptacle (2) through a vacuum-tightly closable conduit (18) into a second receptacle (19), the interior of which can be evacuated. Also within this second receptacle (19) movable tools (22) for processing the material are provided . The material is conveyed off the second receptacle (19) by means of a screw (30). Another screw (15) is bearingly supported within the channel (18) and the screw volutions of this screw convey the material from the first receptacle (2) into the second receptacle (19). Between the screw volutions (52) of this further screw (15) and the second receptacle (19) there is provided at least one damming element (39) in the channel (1B), which is disposed in the flow of the conveyed material. Thereby, a complete vacuum-tightness of the second receptacle (19) and a continuous operation of the apparatus is enabled.<br></td>
