DESCRIPTION IMPACT ABSORBING MEMBER OF MOTOR VEHICLE<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an impact absorbing member of a motor vehicle equipped in at least one of front and rear portions of the motor vehicle, which is interposed between a bumper facia and a vehicle body and can absorb and cushion an energy caused by an impact value in a wide range at a time of being collided with or brought into contact with the other motor vehicle or the other body applied to the bumper facia.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A bumper serving as an impact absorbing mechanism is equipped in the front and rear portions of the motor vehicle for absorbing and cushioning the impact generated at a time of being collided with or brought into contact with the other motor vehicle or the other body. Further, a bumper formed by bending a steel plate is used as a conventional bumper. However, in recent years, in proportion as a demand level against a car styling becomes higher, and a performance improvement on a safety and a grace of an outer shape, are pursued, a bumper which is matched to a body styling in view of a shape, a color and the like is going to be demanded.<br>
The bumper mentioned above is structured such that the<br><br>
V.^;:'LOC_. is covered wi ch 3 bump or facia made of therrr.opl a st i c plastics, and an impact absorbing member is arranged in an inner portion thereof. The bumper facia is formed by injection molding or stamping a polypropylene or the other thermoplastic plastics. In recent years, there has been proposed a polymer alloy obtained by adding the polypropylene to the other composite resin, taking into consideration a recycle performance at a time of disposing a motor vehicle. Further, the impact-absorbing member employs various aspects in view of a performance and a cost, however, employs an aspect centering on a bumper beam as a general aspect.<br>
As the bumper beam, in conventional, there has been frequently employed a structure formed by bending a steel plate as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open (JP-A) No. 6-255433 and JP-A No. 6-328988, however, a synthetic resin bumper beam reinforced by a fiber group such as a glass fiber, a carbon fiber or the like starts being used as disclosed in JP-A No. 6-344837, JP-A No. 11-34140 and JP-A No. 2-299947.<br>
It is a mainstream that the bumper beam is coated with a bumper facia in a surface thereof, however, a foam body for absorbing an energy may be interposed between the bumper beam and the bumper facia as disclosed in Japanese Utility Model ApplicationLaidOpen (JP-U) No. 56-103349andJP-UNo. 57-32555.<br>
Further, in accordance with a new proposal, there is a<br>
blow molded bumper serving as a structure doubling as the bumper<br>
facia and the bumper beam by doing away with the bumper facia<br>
(JP-A No.  4-6202 9,  JP-A No.  5-116572,  Japanese Patent<br><br>
Application Publication No. 2-46418, JP-U No. 58-194942 and the like).<br>
There is a proposal that the blow molded bumper is reinforced by a bumper beam as disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Application Publication No. 4-33165.<br>
The conventional bumper systemmentioned above can absorb and cushion an energy caused by a high impact value (20 kN or higher) at a time of being collided with and brought into contact with the other motor vehicle or the other body, however, it is hard to absorb and cushion the energy caused by a low impact value (5 kN or lower).<br>
Further, there is described in JP-A No. 2002-187508 a structure having a hollowportion, integratedby forming concave ribs from a front surface wall and a back surface wall and bonding leading end portions thereof, and planning to improve an impact absorbingperf ormance. Further, there is described in Japanese Patent No. 3313999 an impact-absorbing member for a vehicle structured by a polypropylene resin having an elastic modulus in bending of 5000 kg/cm2 to 2500 kg/cm2.<br>
In this case, a duct for a vehicle forming a concave rib and a plate-like rib and having an impact absorbing performance is described in JP-A No. 2000-19305^ and JP-A No. 2001-239573, a duct for a vehicle inserting a reinforcing core material and having an impact absorbing performance is described in JP-A No. 2001-34156^ and a bumper reinforcement having a concave rib and a plate-like rib is described in Japanese Patent No. 2714567.<br><br>
As the impact absorbing member for the vehicle described in JP-A No. 2002-187508 and Japanese Patent No. 3313999, the structure integrated by forming the concave rib from the front surface wall and the back surface wall of a hollow double wall structure body made of a thermoplastic resin and bonding the leading end portions to each other can secure a desired impact absorbing amount if a thickness of the hollow body is made sufficient, however, the desired impact absorbing amount can not be obtained in the case that the thickness of the hollow body is limited such as the case a space between the bumper facia and the bumper beam is little on styling, and it is required to improve the impact absorbingperformance just after the impact is applied.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to obtain an impact absorbing member of a motor vehicle which can correspond to an energy caused by a low impact value (5 kN or lower, in particular between 3 kN and 5 kN) as well as absorbing an energy caused by a high impact value (20 kN or higher) at a time of being collided with and brought into contact with the other motor vehicle or the other body, can secure a desired impact absorbing performance even in the case that a thickness of an impact absorbing member or a hollow body is limited, is particularly excellent in an impact absorbing performance just after an impact is applied, and is excellent in a functionality and a styling characteristic which can maintain a high impact absorbing performance, by depressing a first wall of the hollow body toward an opposing second wall and depressing the second<br><br>
wall toward the opposing first wall so as to form a plurality of one concave ribs and a plurality of the other concave ribs, integrally welding leading end portions of the one concave ribs and the other concave ribs to each other, further protruding the first wall toward the opposing second wall and protruding the second wall toward the opposing first wall so as to form a pair of plate-like ribs constituted by one plate-like rib and the other plate-like rib in such a manner as to connect a plurality of concave ribs, and integrally welding leading end portions of the one plate-like rib and the other plate-like rib to each other.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
In order to describe the present invention in more detail,  description Will be given of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 to 5, in a first embodiment of the present invention, an impact absorbing member 1 of a motor vehicle is interposed between a bumper facia 2 and a vehicle body (not shown)&gt; so as to absorb an impact, and is constituted by a bumper beam 3 arranged in a side of a vehicle body, and a hollow body 4 arranged in a side of a bumper facia 2.  The<br><br><br><br>
facia 12.<br>
is plastics. Reference numeral 21 denotes a hollow portion, reference numeral 18 denotes a first waii, icicichcc numeral 19 denoLes a second wall, and reference numeral 20 denotes a peripheral wall. The first wall 18 and the second wall 19 are connected by a peripheral wall 20 leaving a space. The hollow body 14 is structured such that the first wall 18 is arranged in a side of the bumper facia 12, and the second wall 19 is arranged in a side of the bumper beam 3.<br>
The hollow body 14 has a plurality concave ribs 15 and 16 which are formed by respectively depressing both the first wall 18 and the second wall 19 toward the other sides and are formed as approximately cylindrical pairs, and leading end portions of concave ribs 15 and 16 are brought into contact with each other so as to form a weld surface 17.<br>
Further, one plate-like rib 22 is formed in the first wall 18 so as to connect between the respective concave ribs 15, the one plate-like rib 22 is formed in a groove shape having a narrow opposing width, and the opposing width f is between 2.0 and 10.0 mm including a thickness thereof. The other plate-like rib 23 is formed in the second wall 19 so as to connect between the respective concave ribs 16, the other plate-like rib 23 is also formed in a groove shape in the same manner as the one plate-l&gt;ike rib 22, and the opposing width f is between 2.0 and 10.0 mm including a thickness thereof. The one plate-like rib 22 and the other plate-like rib 23 are opposed<br><br><br>
The one plate-like rib 22 and the other plate-like rib 23 which are formed in the hollow body 14 may be formed in a solid plate shape as shown in Fig. 14. Further, a reinforcing core material 25 constituted by a metal or plastic plate may be buried in the one plate-like rib 22 and the other plate-like rib 23, as shown in Fig. 15.<br>
A height b from the first wall 8 or 18 to the weld surface 7 (17) in the one concave rib 5 or 15 formed in the hollow body 4 or 14 is between 15.0 and 35.0 mm, and a height c from the second wall 9 or 19 to the weld surface 7 or 17 in the other<br><br>
concave rib 6 or 16 is between 15.0 and 35.0 mm. Further, an average interval a from the first wall 8 or 18 to the second wall 9 or 19 is particularly preferably between 30.0 and 70.0 mm.<br>
Further, an approximately circular open hole in which a diameter d is between 15.0 and 30.0 mm is provided in a pair of approximately cylindrical concave ribs 5 or 15 and 6 or 16 formed in the ::irst wall 8 or 18 and the second wall 9 or 19, and the weld surfaces 7 or 17 formed in the leading end portions of a pair of concave ribs 5 or 15 and 6 or 16 are formed in an approximately circular shape in which a diameter e is between 5.0 and 15.0 mri, and it is preferable that the approximately cylindrical wall surfaces of a pair of concave ribs 5 or 15 and 6 or 16 are formed in a conical shape so as to connect the first wall 8 or 18 and the second wall 9 or 19 punched in an approximately circular shape with a slope to the weld surface 7 or 17 which :.s formed in an approximately circular shape.<br>
In this case, the open holes and the weld surfaces 7 or 17 of the one concave rib 5 or 15 and the other concave rib 6 or 16 are not: limited to the approximately circular shape as illustrated, but may be formed in an oval shape or a polygonal shape such as a hexagonal shape, an octagonal shape and the like.<br>
In this case, a description will be given below of one example of the oumper facia 2 or 12, and the bumper beam 3 or 13.<br>
The bumper beam 3 or 13 is made of metal or plastic.  In<br><br>
the case of being made of metal, a structure member having a box-shaped cross section or the like can be used by welding a plate member having a C-shaped cross section and made of iron or an aluminum. In particular, in the case of using the metal having a high rigidity such as a high tensile steel or the like, the plate material can be made as thin as possible, and accordingly a weight saving can be achieved. Further, in the case of beinc made of plastic, it is preferable to employ a plastic having a high rigidity having an elastic modulus in bending equal to or higher than 4000 MPa and having a carbon fiber or a glass fiber contained. The bumper beam 3 or 13 may be formed in an elongated shape extending in a width direction of the vehicle body such as a box-shaped cross section or a C-shaped cross section, and may have a mounting portion mounted to the vehicl5? body.<br>
The bumper facia 2 or 12 is formed by injection molding or stamping the polypropylene or the other thermoplastic plastic. Further, the surface of the bumper facia 2 is coated with paint in correspondence to the vehicle body of the motor vehicle, however, the paint resin can be simultaneously treated by using a polymer alio/ resin adding the other composite resin to the polypropylene, taking into consideration a recycle characteristic at a time of disposing the motor vehicle.<br>
The hollow body 4 or 14 can be formed by the resin as far as the resin can be blow molded, and is structured by a resin having a high mechanical strength such as a rigidity or the like, for example, a polyolef in resin such as a polyethylene,<br><br>
a polypropylene and the like, a styrene resin such as a polystyrene, an ABS resin and the like, a polyester resin such as a polyethylene terephthalate and the like, a polyamide and the like, particularly by thermoplastic plastics having the elastic modulus in bending bet ween 800 and 2500 MPa. However, taking the recycle characteristic into consideration, it is preferable to employ the polypropylene, the polyethylene, a polymer alloy based thereon or a polyolefin resin such as a blend material or the like.<br>
Further, :.n the first and second embodiments in accordance with the present; invention, a concave groove-like connection rib 26 rising up in a forward moving direction of the motor vehicle may be interposed between at least one pair of the adjacent concave ribs 5 and 5 or 15 and 15, and at least one pair of adjacent other concave ribs 6. and 6 or 16 and 16.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1 or 11, the connection rib 26 formed in on a virtual straight-line g having an approximate angle with respect to a horizontal line. The virtual straight-line g can be optionally selected in a range between 0 degree and 90 degree with respect to a parallel line. However, the range between 30 degree and 60 degree and 90 degree is preferable in view of the impact absorbing characteristic and the molding characteristic. In this case, the plate-like rib 22 is formed on the horizontal line in Fig. 11, and the connection rib 26 is formed on the virtual straight-line g having an angle of approximately :&gt;0 degree with respect to the horizontal line. In other words, the plate-like rib 22 and the connection rib<br><br>
26 are formed in an approximately orthogonal direction, and supports each other, and it is possible to preferably prevent the concave rib and the plate-like rib from laterally collapsing with respect tc the impact.<br>
In the first and second embodiment in accordance with the present invention, the one concave rib 5 or 15 and the other concave rib 6 or 16 are arranged on the virtual straight-line g leaving a spa.ce with each other.<br>
The connection rib 26 can be formed on the virtual straight line g, and the virtual straight ling g has an angle a between 30 and 60 degree with respect to the horizontal line, as shown in Fig. 2. Further, the added length of all the connection ribs is set to be within a range between 20% and 60% of the added length of all the virtual straight lines g including the first wall 8 or 18, the second wall 9 or 19 and the peripheral wall 10 or 20.<br>
In the case that the added length of all the connection ribs 26 is less than 20% of the added length of all the virtual straight lines g including the first wall 8 or 18, the second wall 9 or 19 and the peripheral wall 10 or 20, the rigidity of the impact absorbing member deteriorated, and the first wall 8 or 18 and the second wall 9 or 19 are contacted against the impact load from the external portion, that is, a so-called bottoming phenomenon is generated. On the contrary, in the case that the added length is more than 60%, the rigidity is increased too much and the cushioning performance deteriorated.<br>
Further, the connection rib 26 is not limited to the<br><br>

all the periphery of the peripheral wall 10 or 20 on the basis of a pinch off by the separated metal molds 27 and 27, and a blowinghole (no-:, shown) is formed as a trace obtainedby sticking the blowing nozzle. The parting line is positioned approximately o:\ the center in a height direction of the hollow body 4 or 14, and is formed approximately in all the periphery of the peripheial wall 10 or 20.<br>
Next, a de.script ion will be given of results of experiments for comparing the embodiment of the impact-absorbing member of the motor vehicle in accordance with the present invention and a comparative embodiment. (Example 1)<br>
An embodiment 1 uses an impact-absorbing member of a motor vehicle constituted by a bumper beam and a hollow body described below as in the structure shown in Figs. 1 to 5.<br>
Bumper beam: bumper beam made of high tensile steel plate and formed in a box-shaped cross sectional shape<br>
Hollow bcdy: hollow body formed by blow molding a shape shown Figs. 1 to 5.. A size thereof is 100 mm x 40 mm x 1200 mm, and an average thickness is 1.0 mm. An inner diameter of the concave rib is § 20 mm in a side of the front surface and <f> 10 mm in a sj.de of the weld portion, in both of the first wall 8 and the second wall 9. The connection rib is formed in a concave g::oove shape, and a rate_ of an added length of all the connection ribs is 25% with respect to an added length of all the virtual straight lines g including the first wall 8, the second wall 9 and the peripheral wall 10. A synthetic<br><br>
resin employs polypropylene "AD571" (elasticmodulus of bending 1050 MPa) produced by SUMITOMO MITSUI CHEMICAL CO., LTD. (Example 2)<br>
An embodiment 2 uses an impact-absorbing member of a motor vehicle employ ir.g a hoi low body having a plate-like rib described in Figs. 11 to 13 in the structure shown in-Fig. 6. The same structure is employed as the impact-absorbing member of the motor vehicle in Figs . 1 to 5 except an existence of the plate-like rib and an arrangement of the connection rib.
