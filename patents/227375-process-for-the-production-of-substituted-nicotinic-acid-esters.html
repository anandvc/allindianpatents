				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF SUBSTITUTED NICOTINIC ACID ESTERS<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of 6-haloalkyl~3-nicotinic acid esters and also to novel enarnine intermediates for use in that process.<br>
6-Haloalkyl-3-nicotinic acid esters are valuable intermediates for the preparation of herbicides such as those described, for example, in WO 01/94339.<br>
From Heterocycles, Vol. 48, No. 4,1998, pages 779-785 it is known to prepare 6-trifluoro-3-nicotinic acid ethyl esters substituted by aryl in the 4-position, corresponding to formula A, by means of dehydrogenation and subsequent oxidation of the compound of formula B in accordance with the following scheme<br><br>
As a result of the uneconomic multi-step procedure, that process is not well suited to the large-scale preparation of 6-haloalkyl-3-nicotinic 3cid ethyl esters.<br>
According to Heterocycles, Vol. 46,1997, pages 129-132, 6-trifluoro-3-nicotinic acid methyl esters substituted by phenyl or alkyl in the 2-position, corresponding to formula C,<br><br>
can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula E with a compound of formula D in benzene and in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid. In addition to unsatisfactory yields,<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br><br>
that process has the serious disadvantage for large-scale preparation that the quality of the enamin'e (E) used as starting material continuously deteriorates during storage as a result of polymerisation reactions, making it considerably more difficult to ensure a consistent product quality.<br>
The problem of the present invention is consequently to make available a novel process for the preparation of 6-haloalkyl-3-nicotinic acid esters which makes it possible to prepare those compounds at reasonable cost, in high yields and with good quality.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to a process for the preparation of compounds of formula I<br>
