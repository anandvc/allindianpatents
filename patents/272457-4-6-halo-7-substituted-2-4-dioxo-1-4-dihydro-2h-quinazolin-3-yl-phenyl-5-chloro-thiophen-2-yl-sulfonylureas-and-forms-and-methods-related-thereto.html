[0001]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Patent Application No.<br>
50/733,650, filed November 3, 2005, the content of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002 ] Thrombotic complications are a major cause of death in the industrialized world.<br>
Examples of these complications include acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina,<br>
chronic stable angina, transient ischemic attacks, strokes, peripheral vascular disease,<br>
preeclampsia/eclampsia, deep venous thrombosis, embolism, disseminated intravascular<br>
coagulation and thrombotic cytopenic purpura. Thrombotic and restenotic complications also<br>
occur following invasive procedures, e.g., angioplasty, carotid endarterectomy, post CABG<br>
(coronary artery bypass graft) surgery, vascular graft surgery, stent placements and insertion<br>
of endovascular devices and prostheses, and hypercoagulable states related to genetic<br>
predisposition or cancers. It is generally thought that platelet aggregates play a critical role in<br>
these events. Blood platelets, which normally circulate freely in the vasculature, become<br>
activated and aggregate to form a thrombus from disturbed blood flow caused by ruptured<br>
atherosclerotic lesions or by invasive treatments such as angioplasty, resulting in vascular<br>
seclusion. Platelet activation can be initiated by a variety of agents, e.g., exposed<br>
subendothelial matrix molecules such as collagen, or by thrombin which is formed in the<br>
coagulation cascade.<br>
[0003] An important mediator of platelet activation and aggregation is ADP (adenosine 5'-<br>
diphosphate) which is released from blood platelets in the vasculature upon activation by<br>
various agents, such as collagen and thrombin, and from damaged blood cells, endothelium or<br>
issues. Activation by ADP results in the recruitment of more platelets and stabilization of<br>
existing platelet aggregates. Platelet ADP receptors mediating aggregation are activated by<br>
ADP and some of its derivatives and antagonized by ATP (adenosine 5'-triphosphate) and<br><br>
 (1996) Thromb. Hemost. 76:835-856). Therefore,<br>
platelet ADP receptors are members of the family of P2 receptors activated by purine and/or<br>
pyrimidine nucleotides (King, B. F, Townsend-Nicholson, A. &amp; Burnstock, G. (1998)<br>
Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 19:506-514).<br>
[0004] Recent pharmacological data using selective antagonists suggests that ADP-<br>
dependent platelet aggregation requires activation of at least two ADP receptors (Kunapuli, S.<br>
P. (1998), Trends Pharmacol Sci. 19:391-394; Kunapuli, S. P. &amp; Daniel, J. L. (1998)<br>
Biochem. J. 336:513-523; Jantzen, H. M. et al. (1999) Thromb. Hemost. 81:111-117). One<br>
receptor appears to be identical to the cloned P2Yi receptor, mediates phospholipase C<br>
activation and intiacellular calcium mobilization and is required for platelet shape change.<br>
The second platelet ADP receptor important for aggregation mediates inhibition of adenylyl<br>
cyclase. Based on its pharmacological and signaling properties this receptor has been<br>
provisionally termed P2YADP (Fredholm, B. B. et al. (1997) TIPS 18:79-82), P2TAC<br>
(Kunapuli, S. P. (1998), Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 19:391-394) or P2Ycyc (Hechier, B. et al.<br>
(1998) Blood 92,152-159). More recently, molecular cloning of this receptor (Hollopeter,<br>
G. et al. (2001) Nature 409: 202-207) has revealed that it is a new member of the G-protein<br>
coupled family and is the target of the thienopyridine drugs ticlopidine and clopidogrel. The<br>
nomenclature given to this receptor is P2Y12-<br>
[0005] Various directly or indirectly acting synthetic inhibitors of ADP-dependent platelet<br>
aggregation with antithrombotic activity have been reported. The orally active<br>
antithrombotic thienopyridines ticlopidine and clopidogrel inhibit ADP-induced platelet<br>
aggregation, binding of radiolabeled ADP receptor agonist 2-methylthioadenosine 5'-<br>
diphosphate to platelets, and other ADP-dependent events indirectly, probably via formation<br>
of an unstable and irreversible acting metabolite (Quinn, M. J. &amp; Fitzgerald, D. J. (1999)<br>
Circulation 100:1667-1667). Some purine derivatives of the endogenous antagonist ATP,<br>
e.g.( AR-C (formerly FPL or ARL) 67085MX and AR-C69931Mx, are selective platelet ADP<br>
receptor antagonists which inhibit ADP-dependent platelet aggregation and are effective in<br>
animal thrombosis models (Humphries et al. (1995), Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 16,179; Ingall,<br>
A. H. et al. (1999) J. Med. Chem. 42,213-230). Novel triazolo [4,5-d] pyrimidine<br>
compounds have been disclosed as P2T -antagonists (WO 99/05144). Tricyclic compounds as<br>
platelet ADP receptor inhibitors have also been disclosed in WO 99/36425. The target of<br>
these antithrombotic compounds appears to be P2Y12, the platelet ADP receptor mediating<br>
inhibition of adenylyl cyclase.<br><br>
 there exists a need for more effective platelet ADP<br>
receptor inhibitors. In particular, there is a need for platelet ADP receptor inhibitors having<br>
antithrombotic activity that are useful in the prevention and/or treatment of cardiovascular<br>
diseases, particularly those related to thrombosis.<br>
[0007] In addition, while biological activity is a sine non qua for an effective drug, the<br>
compound must be capable of large scale manufacturing and the physical properties of the<br>
compound can markedly impact the effectiveness and cost of a formulated active ingredient.<br>
Salts of acidic and basic compounds can alter or improve the physical properties of a parent<br>
compound. These salt forming agents, however, must be identified empirically by the<br>
pharmaceutical chemist since there is no reliable method to predict the influence of a salt<br>
species on the behavior of a parent compound in dosage forms. Effective screening<br>
techniques, which potentially could simplify the selection process, are unfortunately absent<br>
(G. W. Radebaugh and L. J. Ravin Preformulation. In, Remington: The Science and Practice<br>
of Pharmacy; A. R. Gennaro Ed.; Mack Publishing Co. Easton, Pa., 1995; pp 1456-1457).<br>
[0008] Amorphous and different crystalline solid/polymorphic forms of salts are frequently<br>
encountered among pharmaceutically useful compounds. Polymorphism is the ability of any<br>
element or compound to crystallize as more than one distinct crystalline species. Physical<br>
properties including solubility, melting point/endotherm maximum, density, hardness,<br>
crystalline shape and stability can be quite different for different forms of the same chemical<br>
compound.<br>
[0009] Crystalline solid and amorphous forms may be characterized by scattering<br>
techniques, e.g., x-ray diffraction powder pattern, by spectroscopic methods, e.g., infra-red,<br>
solid state I3C and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and by thermal techniques,<br>
e.g, differential scanning calorimetry or differential thermal analysis. Although the intensities<br>
of peaks in the x-ray powder diffraction patterns of different batches of a compound may<br>
vary slightly, the peaks and the peak locations are characteristic for a specific crystalline solid<br>
or amorphous form. Additionally, infrared, Raman and thermal methods have been used to<br>
analyze and characterize crystalline and solid amorphous forms. Solid and amorphous forms<br>
may be characterized by data from the X-ray powder diffraction pattern determined in<br>
accordance with procedures which are known in the art (see J. Haleblian, J. Pharm. Sci. 1975<br>
64:1269-1288, and J. Haleblain and W. McCrone, J. Pharm. Sci. 1969 58:911-929).<br>
Although the intensities of peaks in the x-ray powder diffraction patterns of different batches<br><br>
of the peaks and the peak locations are characteristic for a<br>
specific crystalline solid form.<br>
[0010] The problem which must be solved is to identify a suitable salt and form which (i)<br>
possesses adequate chemical stability during the manufacturing process, (ii) is efficiently<br>
prepared, purified and recovered, (ii) provides acceptable solubility in pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable solvents, (iii) is amenable to manipulation (e.g. flowability and particle size) and<br>
formulation with negligible decomposition or change of the physical and chemical<br>
characteristics of the compound, (iv) exhibits acceptable chemical stability in the<br>
formulation. In addition, salts and forms containing a high molar percent of the active<br>
ingredient are highly desirable since they minimize the quantity of material which must be<br>
formulated and administered to produce a therapeutically effective dose. These often<br>
conflicting requirements make identification suitable salts a challenging and important<br>
problem which must be solved by the skilled pharmaceutical scientist before drug<br>
development can proceed in earnest.<br>
[0011] Therefore, there is a need for compounds and salts and amorphous and crystalline<br>
solid forms of these compounds of the invention and an efficient process for producing the<br>
compounds, salts and crystalline solid forms of the compounds of the invention. Solutions to<br>
the above difficulties and deficiencies are needed before compounds become effective for<br>
routine treatment of thrombosis.<br>
[0012] Polyaryl compounds generally are highly crystalline, poorly water soluble and<br>
hydrophobic, resulting in difficulties in the preparation of pharmaceutical formulations and<br>
problems associated with bioavailability. Accordingly, efforts were made to discover other<br>
forms of compounds of the invention and to investigate the properties thereof. There were<br>
discovered crystalline solid forms of salts of compounds of the invention. The present<br>
invention fulfills the above needs by providing polymorphs and methods for treating and<br>
preventing thrombosis, while presenting a better adverse effect profile.<br>

I.	Definitions<br>
[0038] In accordance with the present invention and as used herein, the following terms are<br>
defined with the following meanings, unless explicitly stated otherwise.<br>
[0039] The phrase "a" or "an" entity as used herein refers to one or more of that entity; for<br>
example, a compound refers to one or more compounds or at least one compound. As such,<br>
the terms "a" (or "an"), "one or more", and "at least one" can be used interchangeably herein.<br>
[0040] The phrase "about" as used herein means variation one might see in measurements<br>
taken among different instruments, samples, and sample preparations. Such variation may<br>
include, for instance, colligative properties for thermal measurements. Typical variation<br>
among different x-ray diffractometers and sample preparations for crystalline solid forms is<br>
on the order of 0.2 °26. Typical variation for Raman and IR spectrometers is on the order of<br>
twice the resolution of the spectrometer. The resolution of the spectrometer used was about 2<br>
cm"1.<br>
[0041] The term "solvate" as used herein means a compound of the invention or a salt,<br>
thereof, that further includes a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amount of a solvent<br><br>
*** force in an amount of greater than about 0.3% when<br>
prepared according to the invention.<br>
[0042] The term "hydrate" as used herein means a compound of the invention or a salt<br>
thereof, that further includes a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amount of water bound<br>
by non-covalent intermolecular forces. Hydrates are formed by the combination of one or<br>
more molecules of water with one of the substances in which the water retains its molecular<br>
state as H2O, such combination being able to form one or more hydrate.<br>
[0043] The term "anhydrous" as used herein means a compound of the invention or a salt<br>
thereof that contains less than about 3% by weight water or solvent when prepared according<br>
to the invention.<br>
[0044] The term "drying" as used herein means a method of removing solvent and/or water<br>
from a compound of the invention which, unless otherwise specified, may be done at<br>
atmospheric pressure or under reduced pressure and with or without heating until the level of<br>
solvent and/or water contained reached an acceptable level.<br>
[0045] The term "polymorphs" as used herein means crystal structures in which a<br>
compound can crystallize in different crystal packing arrangements, all of which have the<br>
same elemental composition. Different crystal forms usually have different X-ray diffraction<br>
patterns, infrared spectra, melting points/endotherm maximums, density hardness, crystal<br>
shape, optical and electrical properties, stability and solubility. Recrystallization solvent, rate<br>
of crystallization, storage temperature, and other factors may cause one crystal form to<br>

[0046] The term "solid form" as used herein means crystal structures in which compounds<br>
can crystallize in different packing arrangements. Solid forms include polymorphs, hydrates,<br>
and solvates as those terms are used in this invention. Different solid forms, including<br>
different polymorphs, of the same compound exhibit different x-ray powder diffraction<br>
patterns and different spectra including infra-red, Raman, and solid-state NMR. Their<br>
optical, electrical, stability, and solubility properties may also differ.<br>
[0047] The term "characterize" as used herein means to select data from an analytical<br>
measurement such as X-ray powder diffraction, infra-red spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy,<br>
and/or solid-state NMR to distinguish one solid form of a compound from other solid forms<br>
of a compound.<br><br>
***** without limitation, humans, domestic animals (e.g.,<br>
dogs or cats), farm animals (cows, horses, or pigs), monkeys, rabbits, mice, and laboratory<br>
animals.<br>
[0049] The term "alkyl" refers to saturated aliphatic groups including straight-chain,<br>
branched-chain and cyclic groups having the number of carbon atoms specified, or if no<br>
number is specified, having up to about 12 carbon atoms. Examples of alkyl groups include<br>
methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-<br>
heptyl, n-octyl, and the like.<br>
[0050] The terms "alkoxy," "alkylamino" and "alkylthio" (or thioalkoxy) are used in their<br>
conventional sense, and refer to those alkyl groups attached to the remainder of the molecule<br>
via an oxygen atom, an amino group, or a sulfur atom, respectively. For brevity, the term Cj_<br>
6alkylamino is meant to include straight chain, branched or cyclic alkyl groups or<br>
combinations thereof, such as methyl, ethyl, 2-methylpropyl, cyclobutyl and<br>
cyclopropylmethyl.<br>
[0051] The term "C1-C6 alkylamino" or "C1-6 alkylamino" as used herein refers to an amino<br>
moiety attached to the remainder of the molecule whereby the nitrogen is substituted with one<br>
or two C1-6 aJkyl substituents, as defined above.<br>
[0052] The terms "halo" or "halogen," by themselves or as part of another substituent,<br>
mean, unless otherwise stated, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. Additionally,<br>
terms such as "haloalkyl," are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl. For<br>
example, the term "C1-4 haloalkyl" is mean to include trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl,<br>
4-chlorobutyl, 3-bromopropyl, and the like.<br>
[0053] The term "pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives" is meant to include salts of the<br>
active compounds which are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on<br>
the particular substituents found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of<br>
the present invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be<br>
obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the<br>
desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable base addition salts include those derived from inorganic bases such as sodium,<br>
potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese,<br>
aluminum salts and the like. Particularly preferred are the potassium and sodium salts. Salts<br><br><br>
*** organic nontoxic bases include salts of primary,<br>
secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted<br>
amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as isopropylainine,<br>

ethanolamine, trimethamine, dicyclohexylamine, choline, and caffeine. When compounds of<br>
the present invention contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be<br>
obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the<br>
desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric,<br>
hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric,<br>
monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric,<br>
hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively<br>
nontoxic organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic,<br>
fumaric, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric,<br>
methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the<br>
like, and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, for<br>
example, Berge, S.M., et al, "Pharmaceutical Salts", Journal of Pharmaceutical Science,<br>
1977, 66, 1-19; Bundgaard, H., ed., Design ofProdrugs (Elsevier Science Publishers,<br>
Amsterdam 1985)). Certain specific compounds of the present invention contain both basic<br>
and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid<br>
addition salts.<br>
[0054] The neutral forms of the compounds may be regenerated by contacting the salt with<br>
a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent<br>
form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such<br>
as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to the parent form of the<br>
compound for the purposes of the present invention.<br>
[0055J In addition to salt forms, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives" is<br>
meant to include compounds which are in a prodrug form. "Prodrugs" of the compounds<br>
described herein are those compounds that readily undergo chemical changes under<br><br><br>
*** the compounds of the present invention. Additionally,<br>
prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the present invention by chemical or<br>
biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example, prodrugs can be slowly<br>
converted to the compounds of the present invention when placed in a transdermal patch<br>

Prodrugs (Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam 1985)).<br>
[0056] "Pharmaceutically acceptable ester" refers to those esters which retain, upon<br>
hydrolysis of the ester bond, the biological effectiveness and properties of the carboxylic acid<br>
or alcohol and are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. For a description of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable esters as prodrugs, see Bundgaard, H., supra. These esters are<br>
typically formed from the corresponding carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Generally, ester<br>
formation can be accomplished via conventional synthetic techniques. (See, e.g., March<br>
Advanced Organic Chemistiy, 3rd Ed., p. 1157 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York 1985) and<br>
references cited therein, and Mark et al., Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, (1980) John<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons, New York). The alcohol component of the ester will generally comprise: (i) a<br>
C2-C12 aliphatic alcohol that can or can not contain one or more double bonds and can or can<br>
not contain branched carbons; or (ii) a C7-C12 aromatic or heteroaromatic alcohols. The<br>
present invention also contemplates the use of those compositions which are both esters as<br>
described herein and at the same time are the phannaceutically acceptable acid addition salts<br>
thereof.<br>
[0057] "Pharmaceutically acceptable amide" refers to those amides which retain, upon<br>
hydrolysis of the amide bond, the biological effectiveness and properties of the carboxylic<br>
acid or amine and are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. For a description of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable amides as prodrugs, see, Bundgaard, H., ed., supra. These<br>
amides are typically formed from the corresponding carboxylic acid and an amine. Generally,<br>
amide formation can be accomplished via conventional synthetic techniques. See, e.g., March<br>
et al., Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd Ed., p. 1152 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York 1985),<br>

1980). The present invention also contemplates the use of those compositions which are both<br>
amides as described herein and at the same time are the pharmaceutically acceptable acid<br>
addition salts thereof.<br><br><br>
[0058] The term phamaceutioally accepted derivatives" is also meant to include<br>
compounds of the present invention which can exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated<br>
forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms are equivalent to unsolvated<br>
forms and are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Certain<br>
compounds of the present invention may exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms. In<br>
general, all physical forms are equivalent for the uses contemplated by the present invention<br>
and are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0059] Certain compounds of the present invention possess asymmetric carbon atoms<br>
(optical centers) or double bonds; the racemates, diastereomers, geometric isomers and<br>
individual isomers (e.g., separate enantiomers) are all intended to be encompassed within the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
[0060] The compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of<br>
atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds. For example,<br>
the compounds may be radiolabelecl with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium<br>
(3H), iodine-125 (!25I) or carbon-14 (14C). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the<br>
present invention, whether radioactive or not, are intended to be encompassed within the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
[0061] "Biological property" for the purposes herein means an in vivo effector or antigenic<br>
function or activity that is directly or indirectly performed by a compound of this invention<br>
that are often shown by in vitro assays. Effector functions include receptor or ligand binding,<br>
any enzyme activity or enzyme modulatory activity, any carrier binding activity, any<br>
hormonal activity, any activity in promoting or inhibiting adhesion of cells to an extracellular<br>
matrix or cell surface molecules, or any structural role. Antigenic functions include<br>
possession of an epitope or antigenic site that is capable of reacting with antibodies raised<br>
against it.<br>
[0062] As used herein, the term "preventing" refers to the prophylactic treatment of a<br>
patient in need thereof. The prophylactic treatment can be accomplished by providing an<br>
appropriate dose of a therapeutic agent to a subject at risk of suffering from an ailment,<br>
thereby substantially averting onset of the ailment.<br>
[0063] As used herein, the term "treating" refers to providing an appropriate dose of a<br>
therapeutic agent to a subject suffering from an ailment.<br><br><br>
[0064] As used the term therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount of a<br>
therapeutic agent that is sufficient to affect the treatment of a subject suffering from an<br>
ailment.<br>

ADP -mediated disease or condition is one in which modulation of ADP results in some<br>
effect on the underlying condition or disease (e.g., a ADP inhibitor or antagonist results in<br>
some improvement in patient well-being in at least some patients).<br>
[0067] As used herein, the term "blood sample" refers to whole blood taken from a subject,<br>
or any fractions of blood including plasma or serum.<br>
[0068] In the compounds of this invention, carbon atoms bonded to four non-identical<br>
substiruents are asymmetric. Accordingly, the compounds may exist as diastereoisomers,<br>
enantiomers or mixtures thereof. The syntheses described herein may employ racemates,<br>
enantiomers or diastereomers as starting materials or intermediates. Diastereomeric products<br>
resulting from such syntheses may be separated by chromatographic or crystallization<br>
methods, or by other methods known in the art. Likewise, enantiomeric product mixtures may<br>
be separated using the same techniques or by other methods known in the art. Each of the<br>
asymmetric carbon atoms, when present in the compounds of this invention, may be in one of<br>
two configurations (R or S) and both are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
II.	Compound Embodiments of the Invention<br>
[0069] Compounds of formula (I) below represent one embodiment of the invention:<br><br><br>
X is selected from the group consisting of F and I;<br>
R1 is selected from the group consisting of H, halogen, -OH, -C1-10-alkyl and C1-6-alkylamino.<br>
[0070] The invention also covers all pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives of the<br>
compounds of formula I. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be prepared using at least<br>
one inorganic or organic base including, but not limited to potassium hydride, potassium<br>
hydroxide, potassium alkoxides, sodium hydride, sodium hydroxide, sodium alkoxides and<br>
the like.<br>
[0071] Within the descriptions above are a number of preferred embodiments. In one<br>
group of preferred embodiments, R1 is C1-10-alkyl or C1-6-alkylamino.<br>
[0072] In another group of preferred embodiments, R1 is C1-6-alkylamino. In yet another<br>
group of preferred embodiments, X is F.<br>
[0073] A number of specific compounds are among the most preferred embodiments for<br>
the compounds of formula I, and are provided in Figure 1 and also represented below.<br>
[0074] In one preferred embodiment of the invention, compounds of formula (I) include the<br>
compound having the formula:<br><br><br><br>
III. Preparation of Compounds of the Invention<br>
[0076] Scheme 1 illustrates a method of preparing certain compounds of formula I wherein<br>
Ar is phenylene and R1 and X'are as described above.<br><br>
[0077] A compound of formula I can be prepared by reducing 2-nitro-benzoic acid methyl<br>
ester compound 1 by procedures known to one skilled in the art to yield aniline 2. (See also<br>
published patent application US 2002/077486). For example, a method of nitro group<br>
reduction can be carried out by hydrogenation. The hydrogenation is carried out with a<br>
suitable catalyst (e.g., 10% Pd/C or Pt(s)/C) under hydrogen and in an appropriate solvent,<br>
typically in an alcohol, preferably ethanol at room temperature. Treating compound 2 with<br>
appropriately substituted aryl isocyanate (Method A) provides intermediate urea 3a.<br>
Alternatively, urea 3a can be formed by treating compound 2 with triphosgene in the<br>
presence of a base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine in an inert solvent such as<br>
THF, dichloromethane and MeCN at appropriate temperature, preferably at 20 °C, followed<br>
by substitutedaniline (Method B). Urea 3a, prepared by Method A or Method B typically<br>
without further purification can be subjected to thermal or base (such as N-methyl<br><br>
**** MM (PS-NMM) induced ring closure to provide<br>
quinazolinedione 4a. The nitro group of compound 4a can be reduced by procedures known<br>
to one skilled in the art to yield free amino group. For example, a method of reduction can be<br>
carried out by hydrogenation, with a suitable catalyst (e.g., 10% palladium on carbon) in an<br>
appropriate solvent, typically an alcohol. The formation of sulfonylurea linkage can be<br>
accomplished by treating the reduced product aniline 5a with a pre-mixed solution of<br>
substituted thiophene-2-sulfonamide, N, N'-disuccinimidyl carbonate and<br>
tetramethylguanidine in dichloromethane, followed by treatment with TFA in<br>
dichloromethane at room temperature to afford the sulfonylurea of formula I. Alternatively,<br>
the sulfonylurea linkage can be formed by reacting the aniline 5a and 5~Chloro-thiophene-2-<br>
sulfonyl ethylcarbamate in suitable solvents, which include, but are not limited to, toluene,<br>
acetonitrile, 1,4-dioxane and DMSO.<br>
[0078] Scheme 2 illustrates an alternative method of preparing compounds of Formula I<br>
wherein R1 is, for example, alkylamino and LJis halogen, alkylsulfonate, haloalkylsulfonate<br>
and arylsulfonate.<br><br><br>
[0079] The urea 3b can be prepared by treating compound 2 with triphosgene or p-<br>
nitrophenyl chloroformate in the presence of a base, such as triethylamine and/or<br>
diisopropylethylamine, in an inert solvent, such as THF, dichloromethane and/or MeCN, at<br>
an appropriate temperature, typically at about 20 °C, followed by treatment with an<br>
appropriately protected aniline (Method B). Urea 3b, typically without further purification,<br>
can be subjected to base induced ring closure to provide intermediate quinazolinedione 4b.<br>
The protecting group of compound 4b can be removed using standard techniques appropriate<br>
for the protecting group used. For example a BOC protecting group can be removed by<br>
treating compound 4b with 4N HC1 in dioxane. The C-7 fluoro of compound 5b is then<br>
displaced by treatment with methylamine in DMSO at about 120 °C to afford aniline 6a. The<br>
preparation of target sulfonylurea 7a can be accomplished by treating aniline 6a with 5-<br><br>
chloro thiophen 2 sulfony carbamate in an appropriate solvent, such as dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide, dioxane and/or acetonitrile with heating.<br>
[0080] Scheme 3 illustrates an alternative method of preparing compounds of Formula I<br>
wherein R1 is, for example, alkylamino and L1is halogen, alkylsulfonate, haloalkylsulfonate<br>
and arylsulfonate and M is K.<br><br><br>
at an appropraate..temperature typically at about 20OC treatment with an<br>
appropriately protected aniline (Method B). According to the invention, compounds of<br>
formula (I) may be further treated to form pharmaceutically acceptable salts e.g. 7a.<br>
Treatment of a compound of the invention with an acid or base may form, respectively, a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt and a pharmaceutically acceptable base<br>
addition salt, each as defined above. Various inorganic and organic acids and bases known in<br>
the art including those defined herein may be used to effect the conversion to the salt.<br>
[0082] Compounds of formula (I) may be isolated using typical isolation and purification<br>
techniques known in the art, including, for example, chromatographic and recrystallization<br>
methods.<br>
[0083] In compounds of formula (I) of the invention, carbon atoms of R1 to which four<br>
non-identical substituents are bonded are asymmetric. Accordingly, a compound of formula<br>
(I) may exist as enantiomers, diastereomers or a mixture thereof. The enantiomers and<br>
diastereomers may be separated by chromatographic or crystallization methods, or by other<br>
methods known in the art. The asymmetric carbon atom when present in a compound of<br>
formula (I) of the invention, may be in one of two configurations (R or S) and both are within<br>
the scope of the invention. The presence of small amounts of the opposing enantiomer or<br>
diastereomer in the final, purified product does not affect the therapeutic or diagnostic<br>
application of such compounds.<br>
[0084] According to the invention, compounds of formula (I) may be further treated to<br>
form pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Treatment of a compound of the invention with an<br>
acid or base may form, respectively, a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt, each as defined above. Various inorganic and<br>
organic acids and bases known in the art including those defined herein may be used to effect<br>
the conversion to the salt.<br>
[0085] The invention also provides pbarmaceutically acceptable isomers, hydrates, and<br>
solvates of compounds of formula (I). Compounds of formula (I) may also exist in various<br>
isomeric and tautomeric forms including pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates and<br>
solvates of such isomers and tautomers. For example, while some compounds are provided<br>
herein as dihydrates having two molecules of water per molecule of the compound of formula<br>
(I), the present invention also provides compounds that are anhydrous, monohydrates,<br>
trihydrates, sesquihydrates, and the like.<br><br>
[0086] This invention also encompasses prodrug derivatives of the compounds of formula<br>
(I). The term "prodrug" refers to a pharmacologically inactive derivative of a parent drug<br>
molecule that requires biotransformation, either spontaneous or enzymatic, within the<br>
organism to release the active drug. Prodrugs are variations or derivatives of the compounds<br>
of formula (I) of this invention which have groups cleavable under metabolic conditions.<br>
Prodrugs become the compounds of the invention which are pharmaceutically active in vivo<br>
when they undergo solvolysis under physiological conditions or undergo enzymatic<br>
degradation. Prodrug compounds of this invention may be called single, double, triple, etc.,<br>
depending on the number of biotransformation steps required to release the active drug within<br>
the organism, and indicating the number of functionalities present in a precursor-type form.<br>
Prodrug forms often offer advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility, or delayed release in<br>
the mammalian organism (Bundgard, Design of Prodrugs, pp. 7-9, 21-24, Elsevier,<br>
Amsterdam (1985); Silverman, The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action, pp.<br>
352-401, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1992)). Prodrugs commonly known in the art<br>
include acid derivatives well known to practitioners of the art, such as, for example, esters<br>
prepared by reaction of the parent acids with a suitable alcohol, or amides prepared by<br>
reaction of the parent acid compound with an amine, or basic groups reacted to form an<br>
acylated base derivative. Moreover, the prodrug derivatives of this invention may be<br>
combined with other features herein taught to enhance bioavailability.<br>
IV. Crystalline solid and Amorphous Embodiments of the Invention and their<br>
Preparation<br>
[0087] The present invention also provides crystalline solid and/or amorphous forms of [4-<br>
(6-fluoro-7-methylamino-2,4-dioxo-l,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-phenyl]-5-chloro-<br>
thiophen-2-yl-sulfonylurea and processes for their preparation and pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising these forms. The potassium salt has the following general formula:<br><br><br><br>
[0088] In developing a process for production of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API),<br>
two factors are of great importance: the impurity profile and the crystal morphology of the<br>
compound. The results from the initial isolation and crystallization work showed a profile of<br>
[4-(6-nuoro-7-methylamino-2,4-dioxo-l,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-phenyl]-5-chloro-<br>
thiophen-2-yl-sulfonylurea of 99.6%. Preferably the API has levels of impurities below 0.2%<br>
and is in the most thermodynamically stable crystalline solid form. The isolation and<br>
crystallization work indicated that there was at least two crystalline solid forms of the<br>
potassium salt of [4-(6-fluoro-7-methylamino-2,4-dioxo-l,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-<br>
phenyl]-5-chloro-thiophen-2-yl-sulfonylurea (designated as Form A and B) and an<br>
amorphous form of the sodium salt of [4-(6-fluoro-7-methylamino-2,4-dioxo-l,4-dihydro-<br>
2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-phenyl]-5-chloro-thiophen-2-yl-sulfonylurea.<br>
[0089] The solid forms of the invention may be described by one or more of several<br>
techniques including X-ray powder diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, and<br>
thermal methods. Further, combinations of such techniques may be used to describe the<br>
invention. For example, one or more X-ray powder diffraction peaks combined with one or<br>
more Raman peaks may be used to describe one or more solid forms of the invention in a way<br>
that differentiates it from the other solid forms.<br>
[0090] Although it characterizes a form, it is not necessary to rely only upon an entire<br>
diffraction pattern or spectrum to characterize a solid form. Those of ordinary skill in the<br>
pharmaceutical arts recognize that a subset of a diffraction pattern or spectrum may be used<br>
to characterize a solid form provided that subset distinguishes the solid form from the other<br>
forms being characterized. Thus, one or more X-ray powder diffraction peaks alone may be<br>
used to characterize a solid form. Likewise, one or more IR peaks alone or Raman peaks<br>
alone may be used to characterize a solid form. Such characterizations are done by<br>
comparing the X-ray, Raman, and BR data amongst the forms to determine characteristic<br>
peaks.<br>
[0091] One may also combine data from other techniques in such a characterization. Thus,<br>
one may rely upon one or more peaks from an x-ray powder diffraction and for example,<br><br>
Raman or IR data to chanactonize a from . for example if more x ray peaks<br>
characterize a form, one could also consider Raman or IR data to characterize the form. It is<br>
sometimes helpful to consider Raman data, for example, in pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
[0092] The polymorphs were identified from by using two different crystallization<br>
conditions. (1) Crystalline form A was isolated after crystallization of the crude wet-cake<br>
from methanol and drying the crude wet-cake to effect solvent removal, and (2) crystalline<br>
solid form B was formed from crystallization from EtOH2O or by trituration with<br>
methanol.<br>
[0093] The potassium salt was suspended in methanol and then heated until a clear solution<br>
was observed. This was followed by cooling and the resulting crystalline solid was isolated<br>
and dried at room temperature under reduced pressure to give the morphologically distinct<br>
crystalline solid potassium salt /form A. Figures 14 and 2 respectively show the DSC trace<br>
and the X-ray powder pattern for the crystalline solid. Differential scanning calorimetry<br>
(DSC) of Form A of [4-(6-fluoro-7-methylamino-2,4-dioxo-l,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3~yl)-<br>
phenyl]-5-chloro-thiophen-2-yl-sulfonylurea potassium salt defined a melt of desolvate at<br>
238 °C. A large decomposition peak was recorded, onset temperature approximately 300 °C.<br>
In the DSC trace, the sharpness of the completion of melt at about 246 °C is characteristic.<br>
[0094] In the X-ray powder diffraction pattern, the peaks at about 9.5 and 25.5 are the main<br>
features of the pattern (for a discussion of the theory of X-ray powder diffraction patterns see<br>
"X-ray diffraction procedures" by H. P. Klug and L. E. Alexander, J. Wiley, New York<br>
(1974)). The peaks at about 9.5° 29 and 25.5° 26 characterize Form A with respect to Form<br>
B because Form B does not have peaks to within 0.2° 28, twice the approximate precision of<br>
X-ray powder diffraction peaks, of the two Form A peaks. Because the typical variation in<br>
any given x-ray powder diffraction peak is on the order of 0.2° 26, when selecting peaks to<br>
characterize a polymorph, one selects peaks that are at least twice that value (i.e., 0.4°6) from<br>
a peak from another polymorph. Thus, in a particular polymorph x-ray pattern, a peak that is<br>
at least 0.4°6 from a peak in another polymorph is eligible to be considered as a peak that can<br>
either alone or together with another peak be used to characterize that polymorph. Tables 1<br>
and 2 identify the main peaks of Forms A and B. From that list, one sees that the peak at<br>
about 25.5° 26 (on the table listed as 25.478 °20), when taken to one decimal point, is greater<br>
than 0.2° 28 away from any peak in Forms B. Thus, the peak at about 25.5° 29 can be used<br>
to distinguish Form A from Form B. The peak at about 9.5° 20 (9.522 °29 in Table 1) is the<br><br>
most intense peaks in the from a A X ray powder diffraction pattern of Figure 2 and is more<br>
than 0.2 °29 away from any peak in Form B. Thus, the Form A peaks at about 9.5°26 and<br>
25.5 °20 characterize Form A with respect to Form B. The solid form isolated at this stage in<br>
the process contained about 2 molecule of water to one molecule of salt.<br><br><br>
[0095] Preferred orientation can affect peak intensities, but not peak positions, in XRPD<br>
patterns. In the case of the potassium salts, preferred orientation has the most effect on the<br>
region at lower angles. Preferred orientation causes some peaks in this region to be<br>
diminished (or increased). Crystal habit does not clearly differentiate between the solid<br>
forms; a variety of habits have been observed for each form, including needles, blades, plates,<br>
and irregular-shaped particles.<br>

sulfonylurea sodium salt which provides an infra red spectrum containing absorption peaks at<br>

quinazolin-3-yl)-phenyl]-5-chloro-thiophen-2-yl-sulfonylurea potassium salt is a dihydrate<br>
which is stable to 15% relative humidity (RH) at 25 °C but which rehydrates at 20% RH at 25<br>
°C. Polymorph A of the potassium salt has been found to be equally stable as the amorphous<br>
form of the sodium salt. No change in the chemical purity of either salt form was observed<br>
after one week when in accelerated stability tests at high temperature (40 °C) and high<br>
relative humidity (75% RH). An advantage of the potassium crystalline form A is that it is<br>
less hygroscopic than the amorphous form of the sodium salt which picks up &gt; 15% w/w<br>
water at 40% RH. Both Form A and B are stable. Form B of the potassium salt is anhydrous<br>
and non-hygroscopic (difficult to form a dehydrate form) Form B of the potassium salt retains<br>
a better physical appearance and handling properties over a longer period of time. An<br>
improvement in the physical appearance of a dosage form of a drug enhances both physician<br>
and patient acceptance and increases the likelihood of success of the treatment.<br>

solid forms, and the amorphous form, of [4-(6-fluoro-7-methy]amino-2,4-dioxo-l,4-dihydro-<br>
2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-phenyl]-5-chloro-thiophen-2-yl-sulfonylurea and its salts. Such<br>
mixtures include compositions comprising at least one solid form or at least two solid forms<br>
selected from Form A, Form B and the amorphous form. Any of the analytical techniques<br><br>
described herein may be used to dates the presence of the solid forms in such compositions.<br>
Detection may be done qualitatively, quantitatively, or semi-quantitatively as those terms as<br>
used and understood by those of skill in the solid-state analytical arts.<br>
[0113] For these analyses, use of standard analytical techniques involving reference<br>
standards may be used. Further, such methods may include use of techniques such as partial-<br>
lease squares in conjunction with a diffractive or spectroscopic analytical technique. These<br>
techniques may also be used in pharmaceutical compositions of the invention.<br>

VI. Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
[0122] A compound of formula (I) according to the invention may be formulated into<br>
pharmaceutical compositions. Accordingly, the invention also provides a pharmaceutical<br>
composition for preventing or treating thrombosis in a mammal, particularly those<br>
pathological conditions involving platelet aggregation, containing a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, each as<br>
described above, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or agent. Preferably, a<br>
pharmaceutical composition of the invention contains a compound of formula (I), or a salt<br>
thereof, in an amount effective to inhibit platelet aggregation, more preferably, ADP-<br>
dependent aggregation, in a mammal, in particular, a human. Pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers or agents include those known in the art and are described below.<br>
[0123] Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be prepared by mixing the<br>
compound of formula (I) with a physiologically acceptable carrier or agent. Pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the invention may further include excipients, stabilizers, diluents and the like<br>
and may be provided in sustained release or timed release formulations. Acceptable carriers,<br>
agents, excipients, stablilizers, diluents and the like for therapeutic use are well known in the<br>
pharmaceutical field, and are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., ed. A. R. Gennaro (1985). Such materials are nontoxic to the<br>
recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as<br>
phosphate, citrate, acetate and other organic acid salts, antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, low<br>
molecular weight (less than about ten residues) peptides such as polyarginine, proteins, such<br>
as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins, hydrophilic polymers such as<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidinone, amino acids such as glycine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, or arginine,<br><br>
monosacharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including cellulose or its<br>
derivatives, glucose, mannose or dextrins, chelating agents such as EDTA, sugar alcohols<br>
such as mannitol or sorbitol, counterions such as sodium and/or nonionic surfactants such as<br>
TWEEN, orpolyethyleneglycol.<br>
[0124] Further embodiments of the invention include pharmaceutical compositions of [4-<br>
(6-fluoro-7-methylamino-2,4-dioxo-l,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-phenyl]-5-chloro-<br>
thiophen-2-yl-sulfonylurea, its salts and forms, including in therapeutically effective amounts<br>
of Form A, Form B, and the amorphous form. vSaid amounts of the at least one of said forms<br>
may or may not be in therapeutically effective amounts. Such pharmaceutical compositions<br>
may be in the form of a solid oral composition such as a tablet or a capsule or as a dry<br>
powder for inhalation.<br>
VII. Methods of Treatment/Administration<br>
A. Preventing and treating disease conditions characterized by undesired<br>
thrombosis<br>
[0125] Methods for preventing or treating thrombosis in a mammal embraced by the<br>
invention administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I)<br>
alone or as part of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention as described above to a<br>
mammal, in particular, a human. Compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the invention containing a compound of formula (I) of the invention are<br>
suitable for use alone or as part of a multi-component treatment regimen for the prevention or<br>
treatment of cardiovascular diseases, particularly those related to thrombosis. For example, a<br>
compound or pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be used as a drug or<br>
therapeutic agent for any thrombosis, particularly a platelet-dependent thrombotic indication,<br>
including, but not limited to, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, chronic stable<br>
angina, transient ischemic attacks, strokes, peripheral vascular disease,<br>
preeclampsia/eclampsia, deep venous thrombosis, embolism, disseminated intravascular<br>
coagulation and thrombotic cytopenic purpura, thrombotic and restenotic complications<br>
following invasive procedures, e.g., angioplasty, carotid endarterectomy, post CABG<br>
(coronary artery bypass graft) surgery, vascular graft surgery, stent placements and insertion<br>
of endovascular devices and protheses, and hypercoagulable states related to genetic<br>
predisposition or cancers. In other groups of embodiments, the indication is selected from the<br><br>
group consisng of nerecutaneous econary intervention (PCI) including angioplasty and/or<br>
stent, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), unstable angina (USA), coronary artery disease<br>
(CAD), transient ischemic attacks (TIA), stroke, peripheral vascular disease (PVD),<br>
Surgeries-coronary bypass, carotid endarectomy<br>
[0126] Compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be used as<br>
part of a multi-component treatment regimen in combination with other therapeutic or<br>
diagnostic agents in the prevention or treatment of thrombosis in a mammal. In certain<br>
preferred embodiments, compounds or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be<br>
coadministered along with other compounds typically prescribed for these conditions<br>
according to generally accepted medical practice such as anticoagulant agents, thrombolytic<br>
agents, or other antithrombotics, including platelet aggregation inhibitors, tissue plasminogen<br>
activators, urokinase, prourokinase, streptokinase, heparin, aspirin, or warfarin or anti-<br>
inflammatories (non-steriodaJ anti-inflammatories, cyclooxygenase II inhibitors).<br>
Coadministration may also allow for application of reduced doses of both the anti-platelet<br>
and the thrombolytic agents and therefore minimize potential hemorrhagic side-effects.<br>
Compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also act in a synergistic<br>
fashion to prevent reocclusion following a successful thrombolytic therapy and/or reduce the<br>
time to reperfusion.<br>
[0127] The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be utilized<br>
in vivo, ordinarily in mammals such as primates, (e.g., humans), sheep, horses, cattle, pigs,<br>
dogs, cats, rats and mice, or in vitro. The biological properties, as defined above, of a<br>
compound or a pharmaceutical composition of the invention can be readily characterized by<br>
methods that are well known in the art such as, for example, by in vivo studies to evaluate<br>
antithrombotic efficacy, and effects on hemostasis and hematological parameters.<br>
[0128] Compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be in the form<br>
of solutions or suspensions. In the management of thrombotic disorders the compounds or<br>
pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in such forms as, for example,<br>
tablets, capsules or elixirs for oral administration, suppositories, sterile solutions or<br>
suspensions or injectable administration, and the like, or incorporated into shaped articles.<br>
Subjects (typically mammalian) in need of treatment using the compounds or pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the invention may be administered dosages that will provide optimal<br>
efficacy. The dose and method of administration will vary from subject to subject and be<br><br>
depedent uposouhafacor as rhe of mammal being treated, its sex, weight, diet,<br>
concurrent medication, overall clinical condition, the particular compound of formula (I)<br>
employed, the specific use for which the compound or pharmaceutical composition is<br>
employed, and other factors which those skilled in the medical arts will recognize.<br>
B.	Therapeutically effective amount<br>
[0129] Dosage formulations of compounds of formula (I), or pharmaceutical compositions<br>
contain a compound of the invention, to be used for therapeutic administration must be<br>
sterile. Sterility is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile membranes such as 0.2<br>
micron membranes, or by other conventional methods. Formulations typically will be stored<br>
in a solid form, preferably in a lyophilized form. While the preferred route of administration<br>
is orally, the dosage formulations of compounds of formula (I) or pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the invention may also be administered by injection, intravenously (bolus<br>
and/or infusion), subcutaneously, intramuscularly, colonically, rectally, nasally,<br>
transdermally or intraperitoneally. A variety of dosage forms may be employed as well<br>
including, but not limited to, suppositories, implanted pellets or small cylinders, aerosols, oral<br>
dosage formulations and topical formulations such as ointments, drops and dermal patches.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be<br>
incorporated into shapes and articles such as implants which may employ inert materials such<br>
biodegradable polymers or synthetic silicones as, for example, SILASTIC, silicone rubber or<br>
other polymers commercially available. The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of<br>
the invention may also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as<br>
small unilameJlar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes<br>
can be formed from a variety of lipids, such as cholesterol, stearylarnine or<br>
phosphatidylcholines.<br>
[0130] Therapeutically effective dosages may be determined by either in vitro or in vivo<br>
methods. For each particular compound or pharmaceutical composition of the present<br>
invention, individual determinations may be made to determine the optimal dosage required.<br>
The range of therapeutically effective dosages will be influenced by the route of<br>
administration, the therapeutic objectives and the condition of the patient. For injection by<br>
hypodermic needle, it may be assumed the dosage is delivered into the body's fluids. For<br>
other routes of administration, the absorption efficiency must be individually determined for<br><br>
each compoudeby method well know in pharmacology. Accordingly, it may be necessary<br>
for the therapist to titer the dosage and modify the route of administration as required to<br>
obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. The determination of effective dosage levels, that is,<br>
the dosage levels necessary to achieve the desired result, will be readily determined by one<br>
skilled in the art. Typically, applications of compound are commenced at lower dosage<br>
levels, with dosage levels being increased until the desired effect is achieved.<br>
[0131] The determination of effective dosage levels, that is, the dosage levels necessary to<br>
achieve the desired result, i.e., platelet ADP receptor inhibition, will be readily determined by<br>
one skilled in the art. Typically, applications of a compound or pharmaceutical composition<br>
of the invention are commenced at lower dosage levels, with dosage levels being increased<br>
until the desired effect is achieved. The compounds and compositions of the invention may<br>
be administered orally in an effective amount within the dosage range of about 0.01 to 1000<br>
mg/kg in a regimen of single or several divided daily doses. If a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier is used in a pharmaceutical composition of the invention, typically, about 5 to 500 mg<br>
of a compound of formula (I) is compounded with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier as<br>
called for by accepted pharmaceutical practice including, but not limited to, a physiologically<br>
acceptable vehicle, carrier, excipient, binder, preservative, stabilizer, dye, flavor, etc. The<br>
amount of active ingredient in these compositions is such that a suitable dosage in the range<br>
indicated is obtained.<br>
C.	Administration<br>
[0132] Therapeutic compound liquid formulations generally are placed into a container<br>
having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper<br>
pierceable by hypodermic injection needle.<br>
[0133] Typical adjuvants which may be incorporated into tablets, capsules, lozenges and<br>
the like are binders such as acacia, corn starch or gelatin, and excipients such as<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, disintegrating agents like corn starch or alginic acid, lubricants<br>
such as magnesium stearate, sweetening agents such as sucrose or lactose, or flavoring<br>
agents. When a dosage form is a capsule, in addition to the above materials it may also<br>
contain liquid carriers such as water, saline, or a fatty oil. Other materials of various types<br>
may be used as coatings or as modifiers of the physical form of the dosage unit. Sterile<br>
compositions for injection can be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical<br><br>
practies for example dissolution suspension of the active compound in a vehicle such as<br>
an oil or a synthetic fatty vehicle like ethyl oleate, or into a liposome may be desired.<br>
Buffers, preservatives, antioxidants and the like can be incorporated according to accepted<br>
pharmaceutical practice.<br>
D.	Combination therapies<br>
[0134] The compounds of the present invention may also be used in combination with other<br>
therapeutic or diagnostic agents. In certain preferred embodiments, the compounds of this<br>
invention may be coadministered along with other compounds typically prescribed for these<br>
conditions according to generally accepted medical practice such as anticoagulant agents,<br>
thrombolytic agents, or other antithrombotics, including platelet aggregation inhibitors, tissue<br>
plasminogen activators, urokinase, prourokinase, streptokinase, heparin, aspirin, or warfarin.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may act in a synergistic fashion to prevent<br>
reocclusion following a successful thrombolytic therapy and/or reduce the time to<br>
reperfusion. These compounds may also allow for reduced doses of the thrombolytic agents<br>
to be used and therefore minimize potential hemorrhagic side-effects. The compounds of this<br>
invention can be utilized in vivo, ordinarily in mammals such as primates, (e.g. humans),<br>
sheep, horses, cattle, pigs, dogs, cats, rats and mice, or in vitro.<br>

[0139] Unless specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein preferably are<br>
conducted under an inert atmosphere at atmospheric pressure at a reaction temperature range<br>
of from about -78 °C to about 150 °C, more preferably from about 0 °C to about 125 °C, and<br>
most preferably and conveniently at about room (or ambient) temperature, e.g., about 20 °C<br>
to about 75 °C.<br>
[0140] Referring to the examples that follow, compounds of the present invention were<br>
synthesized using the methods described herein, or other methods, which are well known in<br>
the art.<br>
[0141] The compounds and/or intermediates were characterized by high performance liquid<br>
chromatography (HPLC) using a Waters Alliance chromatography system with a 2695<br>
Separation Module (Milford, Mass.). The analytical columns were C-18 SpeedROD RP-18E<br>
Columns from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany). Alternately, characterization was<br>
performed using a Waters Unity (UPLC) system with Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C-18 2.1<br>
mm x 15 mm columns. A gradient elution was used, typically starting with 5%<br>
acetonitrile/95% water and progressing to 95% acetonitrile over a period of 5 minutes for the<br>
Alliance system and 1 minute for the Acquity system. All solvents contained 0.1%<br>
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Compounds were detected by ultraviolet light (UV) absorption at<br>
either 220 or 254 nm. HPLC solvents were from EMD Chemicals, Inc. (Gibbstown, NJ). la<br><br>
some instances pinery was assesed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using glass backed<br>
silica gel plates, such as, for example, EMD Silica Gel 60 2.5 cm x 7.5 cm plates. TLC results<br>
were readily detected visually under ultraviolet light, or by employing well known iodine<br>
vapor and other various staining techniques.<br>
[0142] Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on one of two Agilent 1100 series<br>
LCMS instruments with acetonitrile / water as the mobile phase. One system using TFA as<br>
the modifier and measures in positive ion mode [reported as MH+, (M+l) or (M+H)+] and<br>
the other uses either formic acid or ammonium acetate and measures in both positive<br>
[reported as MH\ (M+l) or (M+H)+] and negative [reported as M-, (M-l) or (M-H)"] ion<br>
modes.<br>
[0143] Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis was performed on some of the<br>
compounds with a Varian 400 MHz NMR (Palo Alto, Calif.). The spectral reference was<br>
either TMS or the known chemical shift of the solvent.<br>
[0144] The purity of some of the invention compounds is assessed by elemental analysis<br>
(Robertson Microlit, Madison NJ.).<br>
[014S] Melting points are determined on a Laboratory Devices Mel-Temp apparatus<br>
(Holliston, Mass.).<br>
[0146] Preparative separations were carried out using either an Sql6x or an SglOOc<br>
chromatography system and prepackaged silica gel columns all purchased from Teledyne<br>
Isco, (Lincoln, NE). Alternately, compounds and intermediates were purified by flash<br>
column chromatography using silica gel (230-400 mesh) packing material, or by HPLC using<br>
a C-18 reversed phase column. Typical solvents employed for the Isco systems and flash<br>
column chromatography were dichloromethane, methanol, ethyl acetate, hexane, acetone,<br>
aqueous hydroxyamine and triethyl amine. Typical solvents employed for the reverse phase<br>
HPLC were varying concentrations of acetonitrile and water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid.<br>

[0158] The following produces was adapted from C. A. Hunt, et al. J. Med. Chem. 1994,<br>
37,240-247. In a three-necked R.B. flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, an air<br>
condenser, a dropping runnel, and a moisture-guard tube, was placed chlorosulfonic acid (240<br>
mL, 3.594 mol). Under stirring, PC15 (300 g, 1.44 mol, 0.40 equiv) was added in portions,<br>
over ca. 45 mins. During the addition, a large volume of HC1 gas evolved vigorously, but the<br>
temperature of the mixture did not rise significantly (
been added, an almost clear, pale yellow solution resulted, with only a few solid pieces of<br>
PCI5 floating in the suspension. It was stirred until gas evolution ceased (0.5 h).<br>
[0159] Then the reaction vessel was cooled in ice, and 2-chloro-thiophene (66.0 mL, 0.715<br>
mol) was added via the dropping funnel, over 1.0 h. With the addition of the yery first few<br>
drops of 2-Cl-thiophene, the mixture turned dark purple, and by the time all of the thiophene<br>
had been added, a dark purple solution resulted. During the addition, HC1 gas evolved<br>
continuously, at a slow rate. The reaction mixture was then stirred at room temperature<br>
overnight.<br>
[0160] Then the mixture, dark-purple clear solution, was added dropwise to crashed ice (3<br>
L), over 0.5 h. On addition to ice, the purple color disappeared instantaneously; the colorless<br>
thin emulsion was stirred mechanically at room temperature for ca. 15 h. Then the mixture<br>
was extracted with CH2CI2 (3 x 300 mL). The combined CH2Cl2-extract was washed with<br>
water (lx 200 mL), saturated NaHCO3 (lx 250 mL), brine (1 x 100 mL), dried (Na2SO4), and<br>
concentrated on a rotary evaporator to yield the crude product as a pale yellow glue, which<br>
showed a tendency to solidify, yielding a semi-solid mass. This was then purified by high-<br>
vacuum distillation (bp 110-112712mm) to yield 135.20 g (88%) of the title compound as a<br>
colorless/pale-yellow semi solid.<br><br>
[0161] The following procedure was adapted from C. A. Hunt, et al. J. Med. Chem. 1994,<br>
37,240-247. In a three-necked R. B. flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, cone. NH4OH<br>
(500 mL, 148.50 g NH3&gt; 8.735 mol NH3,13.07 equiv NH3) was placed. The flask was cooled<br><br>
in ice and 5 cholothiopher 2 sulfore chloride (145.0 g, 0.668 mol) was added, in portions<br>
over 0.5 h (it is a low-melting solid, and it was melted by warming, which was then<br>
conveniently added via a wide-bored polyethylene pipette). The sulfonyl chloride<br>
immediately solidifies in the reaction flask. After all the sulfonyl chloride had been added,<br>
the flask containing it was rinsed with THF (25 mL), and this also was transferred to the<br>
reaction vessel. Then the heavy suspension was stirred at room temperature for ca. 20 h. At<br>
the end of this time the reaction mixture was still a'suspension but of a different texture.<br>
[0162] Then the mixture was cooled in ice, diluted with H2O (1.51), and acidified with<br>
cone. HC1 to pH ca. 3. The solid product was collected by filtration using a Buchner funnel,<br>
rinsed with cold water, and air-dried to afford the title compound as a colorless solid, 103.0 g<br>
(78%). MS (M-H): 196.0; 198.0<br><br>
[0163] A 2-L 3-necked R.B. flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a dropping<br>
funnel, was charged with sulfonamide (60.0 g, 303.79 mmol), and Cs2CO3 (200g, 613.83<br>
mmol, 2.02 equiv) in THF (900 mL). The clear solution was cooled in ice, and ethyl<br>
chloroformate (70.0 mL, 734.70 mmol, 2.418 equiv) was added over ca. 30 mins. The heavy<br>
suspension was then stirred at room temperature for ca. 36 h.<br>
[0164] Then the mixture was diluted with water (200 mL) to yield a clear colorless<br>
solution, which was concentrated on rotary evaporator to one-third its volume. This was then<br>
diluted with EtOAc (250 mL), cooled in ice, and acidified with 6N HC1 to pH ca. 1. The<br>
biphasic mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel, layers were separated, and the<br>
aqueous layer was again extracted with 2 x 75 mL EtOAc. The combined organic extract<br>
was washed with water/brine (2 x 50 mL), brine (1 x 50 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and<br>
concentrated to yield the title compound as lightly colored oil. This was purified by filtration<br>
through a silica-gel plug. The crude product was applied to the silica-gel plug on a sintered<br>
funnel in EtOAc, and then was eluted with EtOAc (1 liter). Concentration of the EtOAc<br><br>
filterate previded title compound 8 as a a colorless solid, 71.28 g (87%). MS (M-H): 268.0;<br>

[0165] Aniline 1 (!H NMR (DMSO): s 7.58 (dd, 1H), 6.72 (dd, 1H), 3.77 (s, 3H); 6.0 g,<br>
32.085 mmol) was placed in a 500 mL round bottomed flask and 20% phosgene in toluene<br>
(175 mL, 332.50 mmol, 10.36 equiv) was added. The resulting somewhat sticky suspension<br>
was then magnetically stirred overnight at room temperature resulting in a clear, colorless<br>
solution. An aliquot removed, blown dry with argon, quenched with MeOH, and analyzed by<br>
RP-HPLC/MS to show no unreacted aniline 1 and clean formation of the isocyanate 2a<br>
and/or carbamoyl chloride 2b as analyzed as its methyl-carbamate. The mixture was<br>
concentrated first by rotary evaporation and then under high vacuum to yield 6.76g (99%<br>
yield) of the isocyanate 2a and/or carbamoyl chloride 2b as a free-flowing colorless solid.<br><br><br>
[0166] In a 500 mL R. B. flask was placed N-Boc-1,4-phenylenediamine (6.22 g, 29.866<br>
mmol, 1.20 equiv) in DMF (100 mL). Triethylamine (5.30 mL, 38.025 mmol, 1.52 equiv)<br>
was syringed in. Then the clear, dark-brown solution was treated with a solution of the<br>
isocyanate 2a (5.30 g, 24.88 mmol) and/or carbamoyl chloride 2b in DMF (50 mL),<br>
dropwise, over 15 minutes. After the addition was over, a slightly turbid mixture resulted,<br>
which was stirred overnight at room-temperature. An aliquot was analyzed, after quenching<br>
with MeOH, to show no unreacted isocyanate, and clean formation of the urea, 3a, and<br>
quinazoline-1, 3-dione, 4a, in a ratio of ca. 2.5: 1. MS (M-H): 388.0.<br>
[0167] DBU (3.75 mL, 25.07 mmol, ca. 1.0 equiv) was then syringed in, dropwise, over 5<br>
minutes, resulting in a clear dark-brown solution. This was stirred at room temperature for<br>
3.0 h resulting in a turbid mixture. HPLC analysis showed no urea 3a and clean formation of<br>
the quinazoline-1,3-dione 4a. The reaction mixture was concentrated on a rotary evaporator<br>
to yield the crude product as a solid. This was dried under high vacuum, and then triturated<br>
with CH2CI2/H2O (5:1) to yield 8.40 g of 4a as an almost colorless solid (87% yield). 'H<br>

(s, 9H).<br><br>
Step 3<br>
[0168] The N-Boc-aniline 4a (4.0g, 10.28 mmol) was placed in a round-bottomed, flask<br>
and 4N HC1 in dioxane (50.0 mL, 200 mmol, 19.40 equiv) was added. The heavy, negligibly<br>
solvated suspension was stirred at room temperature for 5.0 h. HPLC showed no starting<br>
material and clean formation of the aniline 5a. The mixture was then concentrated on a rotary<br>
evaporator to yield the crude product. The solid thus obtained was triturated with CH2C12 to<br><br>
yield 3.32 g of pure 5a as almost solid (96% yield). MS (M-H): 290.3. !H NMR<br>
(DMSO): 5 11.75 (s, 1H), 7.88 (dd, 1H), 7.32 (m, 4H), 7.21 (dd, 1H).<br><br>
[0169] The difluoro-compound, 5a (l.Og, 3.072 mmol) was placed in a screw-cap sealed<br>
tube. DMSO (20 mL) was added, followed by methylamine (2.0M in THF) (15.0 mL, 30<br>
mmol, 9.76 equiv), resulting in a clear solution. This was then heated in an oil bath to 110 °C<br>
for 3h. HPLC showed no unreacted 5a and clean formation of 5b. The mixture was then<br>
cooled to room temperature, all the MeNH2 and THF were evaporated, and the residue was<br>
diluted with 100 mL water to precipitate 5b. After stirring for ca. 2 h at room temperature,<br>
the colorless solid was collected by filtration through a Buchner funnel and rinsed with H2O<br>
(100 mL), and air-dried. HPLC analysis of this solid showed it to be pure and devoid of any<br>
DBU. This solid was further purified by triturating with Et2O, and then CH2CI2 as in the<br>
previous route to this aniline to give 875 mg of the title compound (95% yield). MS (M+l)<br>

[0170] The reaction mixture comprising of the aniline (16.0 g, 53.33 mmol) and ethyl-<br>
sulfonyl-carbamate (28.77g, 106.66 mmol, 2.0 equiv) in CH3CN (1300 mL) was heated to<br>
reflux for 36h. During this time, the reaction mixture remained as a heavy suspension. HPLC<br>
analysis showed a clean reaction, and 
cooled to room temperature and filtered through a Buchner runnel. The colorless solid<br>
product was further rinsed with CH3CN (3 x 40 mL). HPLC of the filtrate showed the<br>
presence of only a trace amount of the desired product, most of it being the excess carbamate.<br>

[0176] The 800L GL reactor number PP5-R1000 was charged with acetonitrile (134 Kg),<br>
WFI quality water (156 Kg) and agitated the contents for 5 mins. To this then charged<br>
compound 6a (33.6 Kg, 1.0 equiv) and the reaction mixture was a suspension at this point.<br>
The suspension was charged with aqueous solution (WFI water, 35 Kg) of potassium<br>
hydroxide (4.14 Kg, 1.15 equiv, &gt;85%) at a rate that maintains the internal temperature below<br>
30 °C. The charging lines were rinsed with WFI quality water (2 Kg) followed by heating the<br>
800L GL reactor contents to 50 ± 5 °C for 1 hr. The contents were then filtered hot through a<br><br>
bag filter a seven contaning 0.2 upolise polish filter to clean HDPE drums. The hot filtration<br>
system was maintained through out the filtration process so no material crashes out of the<br>
solution. Cool the 800L GL reactor jacket to 25 ± 5 °C before proceeding to the reactor rinse.<br>
Rinsed the 800L GL reactor with pre-mixed solution of acetonitrile (8.5 Kg) and WFI quality<br>
water (10 Kg) through the filter system into the drums labeled as 7a hot filtration. Using the<br>
pressure vessel the 800L GL reactor was rinsed with WFI quality water (20 Kg) followed by<br>
acetone (20 Kg) then blow it dry with nitrogen (3+ 2psig). The 800GL reactor bottom valve<br>
was closed and pulled 20 + 10 inches Hg of vacuum, then break the vacuum and charge the<br>
reactor with the contents of the drums labeled as 7a hot filtration. Cooled the 800L GL<br>
reactor number PP5-R1000 contents to 20 ± 5 °C and then using a polish filter (PP-PF09),<br>
charged the reactor with methanol (373 kg, &gt;99%) maintaining the internal temperature<br>
below 30oC. The contents of the 800GL reactor number PP5-R1000 were cooled to 15 ± 5 °C<br>
followed by agitation of the contents for 12 hrs at this temperature. During this time the<br>
filterable solids were filtered through a clean filter apparatus (PP-F1000) into clean 200L GL<br>
receiver (PPR-04) followed by pressurizing the reactor, pulled 20 + 10 inches Hg of vacuum<br>
on the filter/receiver and filtered the contents. The filter cake was washed with methanol (30<br>
Kg) and blow dried with 8 + 7 psig of nitrogen for 10 mins. The vacuum oven tray dryer<br>
temperature was set to 80 °C prior to loading the wet cake of 7a. Transferred the wet filter<br>
cake into the pre-lined vacuum trays with Dupont's fluorocarbon film -Kind 100A and<br>
clamped down the special oven paper (Kavon Mel Tuf paper) over the vacuum trays<br>
containing the product wet 7a and transferred to the vacuum oven tray dryer. Set the oven<br>
temperature to 80 °C and dry the wet 7a to a constant weight (constant weight is defined as<br>

sample was analyzed for residual solvents (residual solvent specifications for API) and it met<br>
the specifications. The final API was subjected to equilibration with water (5-6%) for 12 hrs<br>
with a tray of WFI quality water present, then thoroughly turned and allowed to stand for an<br>
additional 12 hrs and finally subjected to KF analysis (5.5% water content). Transferred the<br>

[0177] The pharmecological activity of each of the compounds according to the invention<br>
is determined by the following in vitro assays:<br>
I. Inhibition of ADP-Mediated Platelet Aggregation In Vitro<br><br>
[0178] The effect of testing the compound according to the invention on ADP-induced<br>
human platelet aggregation was assessed in a 96-well raicrotiter assay (see generally the<br>
procedures in Jantzen, H. M. et al. (1999) Thromb. Hemost. 81:111 -117) or standard cuvette<br>
light transmittance aggregometry using either human platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or human<br>
washed platelets.<br>
[0179] For preparation of human platelet-rich plasma for aggregation assays, human<br>
venous blood was collected from healthy, drug-free volunteers into 0.38 % sodium citrate<br>
(0.013 M, pH 7.0 final). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is prepared by centrifugation of whole<br>
blood at 160 x g for 20 minutes at room temperature. The PRP layer is removed, transferred<br>
to a new tube, and the platelet count is adjusted, if necessary, to achieve a platelet<br>
concentration of ~3 x 108 platelets/ml using platelet-poor plasma (PPP). PPP is prepared by<br>
centrifugation of the remaining blood sample (after removal of PRP) for 20 minutes at 800 x.<br>
g. This preparation of PRP can subsequently be used for aggregation assays in either a 96-<br>
well plate or standard cuvette aggregometry.<br>
[0180] For preparation of washed platelets, human venous blood is collected from healthy,<br>
drug-free volunteers into ACD (85 mM sodium citrate, 111 mM glucose, 71.4 mM citric<br>
acid) containing PGI2 (1.25 ml ACD containing 0.2 M PGI2 final; PGI2 was from Sigma,<br>
St. Louis, Mo.). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is prepared by centrifugation at 160 X g for 20<br>
minutes at room temperature. Washed platelets are prepared by centrifuging PRP for 10<br>
minutes at 730 g and resuspending the platelet pellet in CGS (13 mM sodium citrate, 30 mM<br>
glucose, 120 mM NaCl; 2 ml CGS/10 ml original blood volume) containing lU/ml apyrase<br>
(grade V, Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.). After incubation at 37 °C for 15 minutes, the platelets are<br>
collected by centrifugation at 730 g for 10 minutes and resuspended at a concentration of 3 X<br>
108 platelets/ml in Hepes-Tyrode's buffer (10 mM Hepes, 138 mM NaCl, 5.5 mM glucose,<br>
2.9 mM KC1, 12 mM NaHCO3, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mM CaCl2<br>
and 1 mM MgCl2. This platelet suspension is kept &gt;45 minutes at 37°C before use in<br>
aggregation assays.<br><br>
[0181] For cuvette light transmittance aggregation assays, serial dilutions (1:3) of test<br>
compounds were prepared in 100% DMSO in a 96 well V-bottom plate (final DMSO<br>
concentration in the cuvette was 0.6%). The test compound (3 uJ of serial dilutions in<br>
DMSO) was preincubated with PRP for 30-45 seconds prior to initiation of aggregation<br>
reactions, which were performed in a ChronoLog aggregometer by addition of agonist (5 or<br>
10 (JM ADP) to 490 L of PRP at 37°C. In some cases, light transmittance aggregometry was<br>
performed using 490 L of washed platelets (prepared as described above) at 37 °C, and<br>
aggregation was initiated by addition of 5 M ADP and 0.5 mg/ml human fibrinogen<br>
(American Diagnostics, Inc., Greenwich, Conn.). The aggregation reaction is recorded for ~ 5<br>
min, and maximum extent of aggregation is determined by the difference in extent of<br>
aggregation at baseline, compared to the maximum aggregation that occurs during the five<br>
minute period of the assay. Inhibition of aggregation was calculated as the maximum<br>
aggregation observed in the presence of inhibitor, compared to that in the absence of<br>
inhibitor. IC50S were derived by non-linear regression analysis using the Prism software<br>
(GraphPad, San Diego, CA).<br>
[0182] Inhibition of ADP-dependent aggregation was also determined in 96-well flat-<br>
bottom microtiter plates using a microtiter plate shaker and plate reader similar to the<br>
procedure described by Frantantoni et al, Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 94,613 (1990). All steps are<br>
performed at room temperature. For 96-well plate aggregation using platelet-rich plasma<br>
(PRP), the total reaction volume of 0.2 ml/well includes 180 1 of PRP (~3 x 108<br>
platelets/ml, see above), 6 l of either serial dilution of test compounds in 20% DMSO or<br>
buffer (for control wells), and 10 \ of 20X ADP agonist solution (100 M). The OD of the<br>
samples is then determined at 450 nm using a microtiter plate reader (Softmax, Molecular<br>
Devices, Menlo Park, Calif.) resulting in the 0 minute reading. The plates are then agitated<br>
for 5 min on a microtiter plate shaker and the 5 minute reading is obtained in the plate reader.<br>
Aggregation is calculated from the decrease of OD at 450 nm at t=5 minutes compared to t=0<br>
minutes and is expressed as % of the decrease in the ADP control samples after correcting for<br>
changes in the unaggregated control samples. IC50S were derived by non-linear regression<br>
analysis.<br><br>
[0183] Fre 96 well plate aggegation using washed platelets, the total reaction volume of<br>
0.2 ml/well includes in Hepes-Tyrodes buffer/0.1% BSA: 4.5 X 107 apyrase-washed platelets,<br>
0.5 mg/ml human fibrinogen (American Diagnostica, Inc., Greenwich, Conn.), serial<br>
dilutions of test compounds (buffer for control wells) in 0.6% DMSO. After ~ 5 minutes<br>
preincubation at room temperature, ADP is added to a final concentration of 2 uM which<br>
induces submaximal aggregation. Buffer is added instead of ADP to one set of control wells<br>
(ADP- control). The OD of the samples is then determined at 450 nm using a microtiter plate<br>
reader (Softmax, Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, Calif.) resulting in the 0 minute reading.<br>
The plates are then agitated for 5 min on a microtiter plate shaker and the 5 minute reading is<br>
obtained in the plate reader. Aggregation is calculated from the decrease of OD at 450 nm at<br>
t=5 minutes compared to t=0 minutes and is expressed as % of the decrease in the ADP<br>
control samples after correcting for changes in the unaggregated control samples. IC50S were<br>
derived by non-linear regression analysis.<br>
II. Inhibition of r3H12-MeS-ADP Binding to Platelets<br>
1. The ability of candidate molecules to inhibit the binding of f3H12-MeS-ADP to the P2Y12<br>
receptor on platelets was determined using a radioligand binding assay.<br>
[0184] Utilizing this assay the potency of inhibition of such compounds with respect to<br>
[3H]2-MeS-ADP binding to whole platelets is determined. Under the conditions described in<br>
II (3) below, the binding of [3H]2-MeS-ADP is solely due to the interaction of this ligand<br>
with the P2Y12 receptor, in that all the specific binding measured in this assay is competable<br>
with a P2Yi2 antagonist (i.e., the specific binding is reduced to background levels by<br>
competition with an excess of P2Y12 antagonist, with no competition of binding when a P2Yi<br>
antagonist is pre-incubated with the platelet preparation). [3H]2-MeS-ADP binding<br>
experiments are routinely performed with outdated human platelets collected by standard<br>
procedures at hospital blood banks. Apyrase-washed outdated platelets are prepared as<br>
follows (all steps at room temperature, if not indicated otherwise):<br>
[0185] Outdated platelet suspensions are diluted with 1 volume of CGS and platelets<br>
pelleted by centrifugation at 1900 X g for 45 minutes. Platelet pellets are resuspended at 3-6<br>
X 109 platelets/ml in CGS containing 1 U/ml apyrase (grade V, Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) and<br>
incubated for 15 minutes at 37 °C. After centrifugation at 730 X g for 20 minutes, pellets are<br>
resuspended in Hepes-Tyrode's buffer containing 0.1% BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) at a<br><br>
concenration of 666 x 10 8. Binding experiments are performed after &gt;45<br>
minutes resting of the platelets.<br>
2.<br>
[0186] Alternatively, binding experiments are performed with fresh human platelets<br>
prepared as described in section I (Inhibition of ADP-Mediated Platelet Aggregation in vitro),<br>
except that platelets are resuspended in Hepes-Tyrode's buffer containing 0.1% BSA (Sigma,<br>
St. Louis, Mo.) at a concentration of 6.66 X 108 platelets/mil. Very similar results are<br>
obtained with fresh and outdated platelets.<br>
[0187] A platelet ADP receptor binding assay (ARB) using the tritiated potent agonist<br>
ligand [3H]2-MeS-ADP (Jantzen, H. M. et al. (1999) 'Diromb. Hemost. 81:111-117) has been<br>
adapted to the 96-well microtiter format. In an assay volume of 0.2 ml Hepes-Tyrode's buffer<br>
with 0.1% BSA and 0.6% DMSO, 1 X 108 apyrase-washed platelets are preincubated in 96-<br>
well flat bottom microtiter plates for 5 minutes with serial dilutions of test compounds before<br>
addition of 1 nM [3H]2-MeS-ADP ([3H]2-rnethylthioadenosine-5'-diphosphate, ammonium<br>
salt; specific activity 20-50 Ci/mmole, obtained by custom synthesis from Amersham Life<br>
Science, Inc., Arlington Heights, 111., or NEN Life Science Products, Boston, Mass.). Total<br>
binding is determined in the absence of test compounds. Samples for nonspecific binding<br>
may contain 10 DM unlabelled 2-MeS-ADP (RBI, Natick, Mass.). After incubation for 15<br>
minutes at room temperature, unbound radioligand is separated by rapid filtration and two<br>
washes with cold (4-8 °C.) Binding Wash Buffer (10 tnM Hepes pH 7.4,138 mM NaCl)<br>
using a 96-well cell harvester (Minidisc 96, Skatron Instruments, Sterling, Va.) and 8X12<br>
GF/C glassfiber filtermats (Printed Filtermat A, for 1450 Microbeta, Wallac Inc.,<br>
Gaithersburg, Md.). The platelet-bound radioactivity on the filtermats is determined in a<br>
scintillation counter (Microbeta 1450, Wallac Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.). Specific binding is<br>
determined by subtraction of non-specific binding from total binding, and specific binding in<br>
the presence of test compounds is expressed as % of specific binding in the absence of test<br>
compound dilutions. IC50s were derived by non-linear regression analysis.<br>

min, then hot filtered to yield a tan solid, which is mostly the title compound by HPLC. The<br>
tan solid was suspended in CH3CN: EtOH (1:2) (100 mL) and refluxed for 45 mins., then hot<br>
filtered to afford 2.54 g of the title compound as a tan solid (99.6887% pure by analytical<br>

filtration through a Buchner funnel. The solid product was rinsed with EtOH and dried in<br>
vacuum oven at 80 °C for 20h to give a colorless solid. The mother liquor yielded more title<br>
compound upon concentration to ca. one-third of the original volume.<br>
Example 10; Preparation of polymorph form B of potassium salt by recrystallization<br>
[0195] Recrystallization: The crude product can be recrystallized from EtOH/H2O (91:9)<br>
or a small volume of MeOH by first heating to reflux to dissolve, and then cooling to room<br>
temperature to precipitate.<br>
[0196] Recrystallization from EtOH/H2O: l.Og of the potassium salt was suspended in<br>
EtOH (190 mL) and heated to reflux. To the heavy suspension was added H2O (18.0 mL)<br>
dropwise, resulting in a clear colorless solution. On cooling to room temperature, the title<br>
compound precipitated out as a colorless solid. It was collected by filtration through a<br>
Buchner funnel, and rinsed with EtOH (2 x 4.0 mL). This was dried in vacuum oven at 80 °C<br>
for 20 h, to give 650 mg of a colorless solid. The mother liquor yielded more title compound<br>
upon concentration to ca. one-third of the original volume.<br>
[0197] Large Scale Recrystallization from small volume of MeOH: 6.6g of the<br>
potassium salt was suspended in MeOH (30 mL) and heated to reflux for 5hr, the solid did<br>
not completely dissolve in less volume of methanol. After cooling the solid was filtered and<br>
rinsed with iPrOH. This was dried in vacuum oven at 80°C for 20 h, to give 6.2 g of colorless<br>
solid, characterized to be Form B.<br>
