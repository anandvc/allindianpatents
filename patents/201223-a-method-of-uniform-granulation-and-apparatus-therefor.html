The present invention is directed to a pan granulation method for forming granules and apparatus for effecting the method and more particularly, the present invention is directed to an improved selective size granulation method and apparatus for effecting the method.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Generally speaking, pan granulation has been proposed in the art many times previously and with significant variations.<br>
One of the latest issued patents in the art to which the present invention relates is U.S. Patent No. 5,460,765, issued to Derdall et al., October 24, 1995. The reference teaches a process for pan granulating a particulate material. Based on the teachings of the Derdall et al. reference, a final particle size distribution that is achievable by practicing the invention is between about -5 mesh to about +10 mesh. In order to initiate the process, the Derdall et al. process is limited to the introduction of a seeding material typically between about -14 mesh and +28 mesh. This is required in order to control the granule growth and as indicated in the Derdall et al. disclosure, seed minimizes mutual agglomeration and results in high yields being obtained. The Derdall et al reference further indicates that the proper sizing of the seed is fundamental to the operation of the process for granulation in order to have product yields exceed 90%. Reference is made in the disclosure that a seed core in the range of -14 mesh to +35 mesh is required in order to achieve a steady state and maintain uniform size distribution of between -8 mesh to +6 mesh.<br>
It would be -desirable if a process were possible to achieve a high yield granular product within specified mesh sizes which does not require the use of a seed in the process.<br>
The present invention is directed to satisfying the limitations in the art and more particularly those limitations in the Derdall et al. reference.<br><br>
2 INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The invention has applicability in the granulating art and related industries.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide an improved granulation method and an apparatus for effecting the improved granulation method.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a method of uniform granulation, comprising the steps of:<br>
providing aninitial feedstock having about 99.9% particle size of -150 mesh and about 90% or smaller particle size -200 mesh;<br>
contacting the feedstock in a pan granulator containing a minor amount of a nucleating material of about -35 mesh; and<br>
introducing a binder material into the pan granulator to progressively layer feedstock material on the nucleating material to form a product having a size distribution of + 8 to -4 mesh.<br>
Advantageously, it has been found that the granulation process can be achieved in the absence of any seed material to result in a high yield product with high break strength.<br>
Overall, the method relates to a procedure to granulate feedstocks that are in the -35 mesh size range and have no readily sized seed particles in the +35 mesh size fraction. A two-stage method is taught where an intermediate sized granule can be produced that is predominantly -8 mesh to +20 mesh in a first stage. This product can then be dried and screened such that the -8 to +20 portion of granules is used as a feed to the second stage.<br>
In the second stage, the -8 to +20 mesh portion may be added to a second stage granulator pan where suitable binder is added to grow the small balls into uniform sized +8 to -4 mesh granules or balls which are then dried in the dryer.<br><br>
3<br>
 The so-dried product may be then screened on -8 to +4 mesh to produce a new product in the form of a premium granular fertilizer, for example, break strength of greater than 1.0 kilograms (kg) with 3 to 4 kilograms (kg) being typical. The -8 to +20 mesh portion leaving the dryer may be recovered and recycled to the second stage paa The +4 mesh and the -20 mesh portions may be sent to a suitable pulverizer for recycling.<br>
Conveniently, the present method is particularly efficient. It has been found that no waste results in view of the fact that depending on the nature of the exiting product i.e. whether the same is to be recycled, is to be a final product stream or an intermediate stream, all particles are acted upon in the method in order to achieve the desired product thereby obviating waste.<br>
As a particularly convenient feature of the method, no seed material is required in order to effect the procedure. It has been found that the nucleation center in the size range of -35 mesh to +150 mesh may be employed as a basis for granule growth and further, that the nucleation center may comprise any suitable material known to those skilled in the art. This has dramatic consequences in terms of cost savings as well as providing the user with the capacity to "shell" or "onion-skin" nucleation center with additional materials which may be similar or different from one another. This degree of freedom is obviously favourable, since multicomponent homogenous granules can be readily produced. As an example, and without being limiting, the process is applicable to granule formation where the granule includes a base fertilizer material which may be surrounded by a coating having limited solubility in order that the fertilizer be a time release type compound. As a further example, the process is particularly well suited to the formation of novel water softener balls or granules for use in water softening systems. Additionally, specialty fertilizer grades may be easily formed using the process according to the present invention. Utility for the process can be realized for a plethora of particle types.<br>
As a further option, the process has applicability in other fields such as the preparation of ice melt product As an example, for the formation of the sodium chloride granules, the process, according to one embodiment of the invention, permits the addition of Mg or CaCl2 to the sodium chloride to enhance the ice melt characteristics and make a more efficient ice melt product It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a host<br><br>
4<br>
of additional examples may be achievable depending on the particular end use of the product.<br>
According to a further object of the present invention, there is provided a method of granulating feedstock to produce a product in the -8 mesh to +20 mesh size distribution, comprising the steps of:<br>
providing an initial feedstock having about 99.9% particle size of -150 mesh and about 90% or smaller -200 mesh;<br>
contacting, in a first stage, the feedstock in a first pan granulator containing a minor amount of a nucleating material of about -35 mesh;<br>
introducing a binder material into the first pan granulator to produce an intermediate product that is sized between -8 mesh to 4-20 mesh;<br>
drying the intermediate product; screening the intermediate product to produce a finished product, a recycled product and a second stage product;<br>
contacting, in a second stage, the second stage product in a second pan granulator; and<br>
reintroducing the binder material into the second pan granulator to progressively layer sufficient feedstock material on the second stage product to thereby convert the second stage product to the finished product having a size distribution of +8 mesh to -4 mesh.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for generating a granule in a size distribution of 4-8 mesh to -4 mesh, comprising:<br>
pulverizing means for pulverizing feedstock in a size distribution of 99.9% of -150 mesh to 90% of -200 mesh;<br>
at least one pan granulator for receiving the feedstock;<br>
at least one receptacle for storing and dispensing nucleating material in the size range of -35 mesh to at least one pan granulator;<br>
binder storage and dispensing means for introducing binder; and<br>
dryer means for drying formed granules.<br>
In accordance with the further desirable features of the present invention, the provision of a plurality of pan granulatots permits full control and customization of the<br><br>
5<br>
 granule characteristics. By using one or a plurality of pan granulators when the process steps are observed, the result is that the granule can be uniformly grown under stabilized conditions without continual cycling as is the limitation in the prior art where only a single pan is disclosed for use. By employing the process parameters and apparatus according to the present invention, progressive accretion of the material on the granule is possible to result in a high density packed pellet with extremely high strength and a user predetermined size.<br>
Significant additional advantages can be realized by the technology set forth herein including:<br>
i)	an enhanced market value of the formed product;<br>
ii)	the formation of a more user friendly product;<br>
iii)	significantly improved product handleability;<br>
iv)	a significantly improved uniformity index; and<br>
v)	no product loss or waste.<br>
The process and apparatus contribute to achieve a greater than 90% recovery of product which is on specification (spec) in the size range of +8 mesh to -4 mesh. Of the remaining 10% of the product, the same may be simply reintroduced into the pulverizer to create fines for reintroduction into the system. Accordingly, it will be readily apparent to those skilled that the process may be not only particularly useful for the user but further, results in monetary and energy savings from 100% use of the product.<br>
In view of the elegance of the technology set forth herein, the result is that the apparatus and method may be applied in a retrofit application to existing systems which cannot achieve the level of efficiency attributed to the present technology set forth in the present case; existing systems may be significantly improved by simply adding the apparatus of the present invention and the method disclosed herein to improve such systems. This is a further advantage of the present invention in that the method is interruptible and does not require any specific parameters in terms of temperature, etc. in order to operate efficiently. In this manner, the pan granulators, employed in the present invention, may be arranged in any number of ways i.e. in series, parallel, towered etc., and may include any<br><br>
6 <br>
number of compounds to apply any number of layers on a granule as tbe same is grown through the system.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of uniform granulation, comprising the steps of : providing an initial feedstock having a uniform size distribution of about 99.9% particle size of -150 mesh of said 99.9% particle size of -150 mesh about 90% comprising a particle size of -200 mesh ; contacting said feedstock in a first pan granulator containing a minor amount of nucleating material of between about -35 mesh and +150 mesh ; introducing a binder material in the presence of moisture into said first pan granulator to progressively layer feedstock material on said nucleating material ; forming a seeding agent product comprising feed stock layered on said nucleating material,<br>
said seeding agent product  having size distribution of -8 mesh to +20 mesh ;<br><br>
drying said seeding agent  product, and selectively introducing said seeding<br>
agent product into at least a second pan granulator for layering of the feedstock<br>
with  second  feedstock to form a second Product  having  a  uniform  size<br>
distribution of-8 mesh to +4 mesh.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of granulating feedstock to produce a product in the -8 mesh to +20 mesh size distribution, comprising the steps of: providing an initial feedstock having about 99.9% particle size of 150 mesh and about 90% -200 mesh ; contacting, in a first stage, said feedstock in a first pan granulator containing a minor amount of nucleating material of between about -35 mesh and +150 mesh ; introducing a binder material in the presence of moisture into said first pan granulator to produce an intermediate product comprising a nucleating material that has a size distribution between -8 mesh to + 20 mesh ; drying said intermediate product ; screening said intermediate product to produce a finished product, a recycled product and a second stage product; contacting, in a second stage, said second stage product in a second pan granulator; and reintroducing said binder material into said second pan<br><br>
-6A-<br>
gmaulator to progressively layer sufficient feedstock material on said second stage product to thereby convert said second stage product to said finished product having a size distribution of -8 mesh to + 4 mesh.<br>
The present invention further provides an apparatus for generating a granule in a size distribution of +8 mesh to -4 mesh, comprising : pulverizing means for pulverizing feedstock in a size distribution of -150 mesh to -200 mesh ; at least one pan granulator for receiving said feedstock ; at least one receptacle for storing and dispensing nucleating material in the size range of -35 mesh to said at least one pan granulator; binder storage and dispensing means for introducing binder; and dryer means for drying formed granules.<br>
Having thus described the invention, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawing illustrating preferred embodiments.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE   ACCOMPANYING  DRAWINGS.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a schematic representation of the method according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Similar numerals in the drawing denote similar elements. MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Referring now to Figure 1, shown is an overall schematic representation of the process according to one embodiment.<br><br>
6B<br>
In the embodiment shown, the circuit is representative of a ten ton per hour circuit Reference numeral 10 denotes the introduction of feedstock which may be any suitable material The technology set forth herein permits the formation of most any granulated product including various sulfates, soda ash, sulfur, potash, kaolin, magnesia, potassium sodium and ammonium chloride inter alia.<br>
The feed may be introduced at 9.8 tons per hour (9.8 thr1) along with suitable binder material as set forth herein previously. The feedstock and binder may be then introduced into a pulverizer 12 to pulverize the feedstock such that a product is produced having 99.9% -150 mesh and at least 90% -200 mesh. The pulverizer 12 may be a classifying pulverizer or air sweep pulverizer or any other suitable pulverizer known by those skilled in the art Once pulverized, the stream, generally represented by numeral 14, is introduced into a sealed collection hopper, globally denoted by numeral 16, which includes a bag house 18 to collect dust. Collection hopper 16 includes suitable valve 20 for metering dust into a collection bin 22. The bin 22 is mounted over tworfeeders 24 and 26 which<br><br>
7<br>
divide the material being received from bin 22 into two streams, the first stream being fed by feeder 26 to a first large pan granulator 28 at a rate of 7.6 tons per hour (7.6 thr1), as an example, while feeder 24 feeds a second stream into a second pan granulator 30, being smaller than pan granulator 28. The feed rate to the small pan may be 2.8 tons per hour (2.8 thr1), as an example, to be consistent with the ten ton per hour circuitry.<br>
Pan 30 is equipped with a small receptacle 32 for retaining -35 mesh dry raw feedstock (not shown). The receptacle 32 is equipped with a variable rate metering apparatus (not shown). The feeder removes the material from the receptacle 32 and introduces the dry raw feedstock into pan 30. As is known in the art, the pan granulators 28 and 30 include upper and lower scrapers 34, 36 and 38, 40, respectively. Regarding the feedstock from receptacle 32, the same is introduced to the pan 30 behind top scraper 38. In this example, the production rate for the pan 30 would be set for 3 tons per hour (3 thr-1) with a size distribution of approximately 80% product between -8 mesh to +20 mesh. It has been found that this is achievable by combining the raw feedstock to the dust at a ratio of 1:20 to 1:100 parts. The use of an atomizing hot binder solution at any position from the 12 o'clock through to the 5 o'clock position has been found to be particularly useful. When the correct free moisture is attained, generally between 10 to 10.5%, the first pan stabilizes at a steady state condition.<br>
As indicated above, the product formed from pan 30 is typically between 50 to 80% -8 mesh. The product is discharged and dried with dryer 38. Dryer 38 may be selected from, for example, Carrier dryers, tray dryers of rotolouver type dryers. The product being formed in large pan 28 is additionally transported to dryer 38 via a suitable conveyer, globally denoted by numeral 40.<br>
Product exiting dryer 38 via stream 42 is then screened by a suitable screening arrangement 44 at 4 mesh, 8 mesh and 20 mesh. The +4 and -20 mesh portions are sent to pulverizer 12 for recycling into the system, the recycling stream being indicated by numeral 46. The -4 to +8 mesh portion is the final product and leaves screen 44, as indicated by numeral 48, as a final finished product. The -8 to 4-20 mesh portion is sent via stream 50 to a hopper equipped with a weight belt feeder, broadly denoted by numeral 52. The material is advanced from the weigh belt feeder 52 into pan 28 whereupon the product<br><br>
8<br>
is further processed by the introduction of binder and additional dust to produce a desired granule product<br>
Any residual dust which may be present in dryer 38 may be passed via line 54 for exiting dryer 38 to hopper 56 and the collected material in hopper 56 either passed onto the bag house 18 via line 58 or passed into the feedstock via line 60. The fines or dust entering bag house 18 may additionally be passed off onto ancillary operations, for example, wet scrubbing, as broadly denoted by numeral 60 in Figure 1. Other examples will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art<br>
The ratio of -8 to 4-20 mesh product needed to run pan 28 at a steady state has been found to be, for the system described herein, between 1:10 to 2:5, an optimum of 1:5. Pan 28 stabilizes quickly and produces yields of greater than 95% on +8 to -4 mesh. The process yield from the overall circuit as set forth herein exceeds 90%. As discussed briefly herein previously, 10% of the weight, which is in the -20 and +4 mesh size distribution, as well as dryer dusts, can be recycled to enhance the efficiency and productivity of the method to produce maximum yields at very low cost.<br>
With further reference to the pans 28 and 30, as is known, the pans may be adjusted for angle and rotational speed such that the +8 to -4 mesh granules are the only product produced. In addition, it has been found advantageous to not only change the horizontal disposition of the pans, but also to laterally tilt the pans to enhance the efficiency of the granulating process. The specific angle of tilt and horizontal angle will be dependent upon the rotational speed and the size of the granule desired to be produced.<br>
It will be appreciated that the method for operation as discussed can be a single operation or may be incorporated into a unit operation within a series of other operations. This will depend upon the specific needs of the user.<br>
It will also be readily appreciated that any number of pans can be incorporated into the system to progressively grow or accrete a granule.. To this end, the process is interruptible and therefore can be custom designed to produce granules having a variety of layers of material to produce a host of valuable granules.  It will be clear to<br><br>
9<br>
those skilled in the art that the process is effective for producing a number of different forms of fertilizer and has particular utility with respect to the formation of high grade fertilizer for use on golf courses, etc<br>
In terms of the binder, suitable example include Jignosol, sugars, saturated salts and proteins, water, calcium sulfate, sodium sulfate, potassium chloride, dry glutens, wheat grains, barley grains, rice grains and calcium phosphate among others. The choice of the binder will depend on the desired characteristics of the granule and accordingly, the aforementioned examples are only exemplary.<br>
As a further alternative,, the void space or interstices of the dried granular pellets can be filled with hot saturated brine of the granulated salt provided the salt is soluble in water. Typically, the dried pellets absorb the saturated brine by capillary action. As one possible means of wetting the pellets, a rubber lined drum may be employed and the brine simply sprayed on the pellets until approximately 8% to about 10% moisture is achieved. The wet pellets may then be dried in a suitable dryer.<br>
It has been found that numerous advantages flow from this post treatment regime for the pellet. The advantages include:<br>
a reduction in void space from 30% to about 10%;<br>
an improved bulk density for the pellet of between about 5% to about 15%; and<br>
an improvement in break strength of from about 2 kgs to 5 kg or more.<br>
In an example, the bulk density of a pellet was increased from 50 lbs.ft3 to 56 Ibs-ft3 for soluble salts like potassium chloride and sodium chloride. Other soluble salts with high specific gravity are believed to provide similar results.<br>
In situations where the saturated brine is hydrophobic compared to the dried pellet, an appropriate wetting agent or surfactant may be employed. As an example, short chain sulphonic acid soaps have been found to be useful at concentrations less than about 20 ppm in the hot saturated solution. A most desirable concentration is between 5 to 10 ppm.<br><br>
10<br>
Although embodiments of the invention have been described above, it is not limited thereto and it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that numerous modifications form part of the present invention insofar as they do not depart from the spirit, nature and scope of the claimed and described invention.<br><br>
