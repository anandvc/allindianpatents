				<td>Device for Feeding Card Slivers on a Spinning Machine, Particularly Draw Frame, e.g. Regulating Draw Frame<br>
The invention pertains to a device for feeding card slivers on a spinning machine, particularly idraw frame, e.g. regulating draw frame, in which the card slivers are drawn from spin cans via several driven feed rollers attached to a feeding table, and forwarded to a driven drawing system, whereby at least two electrical drive motors are foreseen, whose rotation speeds can be adjusted.<br>
Such a device is known from the document DE 198 09 875. To each feed roller on the feeding table of a drawing system, a drive motor with rotation speed control is allocated, so that the circumference speed of the feed rollers can be individually adjusted. With several rotation speed-regulated drive motors, different circumference speeds can be set.<br>
It is the task of this invention to improve such a machine further in such a way, that rotation speed variations can be balanced independent of load, in a simple manner.<br>
This task is fulfilled by means of the features mentioned in claim 1.<br>
By means of the measures as per the invention, it is possible, particularly in case of a drawing system, to balance or even to avoid load-dependent rotation speed variations. Although DC-motors reveal a load-dependent rotation speed characteristic on account of slippage, the risk of an erroneous draft is thereby avoided. The card slivers should not show any permissible variations from feed tension within the feeding table, with respect to one another or with respect to the varying distance between the feed rollers and the feed roller pair of the subsequent drawing system. According to the invention, in spite of a load, a desired rotation speed (rated rotation speed) of the drive motors can be realised completely or almost completely, so that erroneous drafts can be avoided. On transmitting the drive power of the feed rollers to the card slivers, besides, fibre material-caused frictional differences are compensated. Although in practice, frictional force of cotton (which sometimes contains avivave, adhesive substances or similar things), through cotton-chemical fibre-mixtures to pure chemical fibre (smooth surface) gets reduced, through the measures as per the invention, independent of the fibre material processed, a safe and effective-transmission of drive power<br><br>
2<br>
to the card sliver is achieved. A great advantage is, that the device is very simple as far as the design is concerned.<br>
Ideally, at least two drive motors are allocated to the feed rollers of the feeding table of the draw frame. Preferably, a drive motor is allocated to each feed roller. It is advantageous to allocate one drive motor to the feed roller and at least one drive motor to the roller pairs of the drawing system for the break draft. The drive motor should preferably be a frequency-controlled AC-asynchronous motor   Ideally, the drive motor should be an AC-synchronous motor. In this motor, according to the system, there are no variations in the rotation speed. The drive motor should preferably be a reluctance motor. This motor behaves during run-up (acceleration) like an AC-asynchronous motor, subsequently (during operation) like a synchronous motor, so that it is not necessary to guide or direct the rotation speed. It is advantageous to have the drive motor as a current-director-controlled DC-motor. The feeding realigner generates in this case a rotation speed-proportional voltage. The dnve motor should preferably be a gear motor. Ideally, the drive motor should be an inner running motor (standard motor). Preferably, the drive motor should be an outer running motor (drum motor). The feeding realigner advantageously generates a rotation speed-determining voltage with variable magnitude and frequencies. The realigner should preferably be a frequency realigner   To serve the purpose, the realigner should be a DC-current director. The realigner should preferably have rated value giver, e.g. potentiometer, pregiven by a control unit. A rotation speed giver, e.g. tacho generator is available. Several rotation speed givers (e.g. tacho generators) are provided, to which an average value formation unit is connected. To suit the purpose, a drive motor is equipped with a rotation speed-proportional giver. Preferably, a roller e.g. feed roller, is equipped with a rotation speed-proportional giver. One of the drive motors or one of the rollers is equipped as a standby, with a giver for all drive motors or rollers being used. The giver is connected to the realigner and influences the initial voltage and/or frequency of the realigner in such a way, that variation from the rated value can be kept as minimum as possible. It is preferable to have more than one rotation speed-actual value giver, in order to be able fo determine an average actual rotation speed of several rollers and/or drive motors. The calculated average rotation speed variation influences the frequency and/or the output voltage of the feeding realigner. The drive motor is preferably a DC-motor, whereby the feeding realigner generates a rotation speed-proportional voltage. The rotation speed-proportional voltage is additionally regulated by a rotation speed-actual value giver. The rotation speed rated value is formed proportional to the rotation speed of the<br><br>
3<br>
drawing system feed roller. For driving the feed rollers, drive motors with  the same'rotation speed characteristics are used. The rotation speeds of the drive motors for the feed rollers should preferably be the same or almost same. With the same or almost same rotation speed of the drive motors for the feed rollers in working direction, different circumference speeds of the feed rollers are realised.<br>
The invention includes a further advantageous device for feeding card slivers in spinning machines, especially draw frames, e.g. regulating draw frames, in which the card slivers are drawn from spin cans via several driven feed rollers attached to a feeding table and forwarded to a driven drawing system, whereby at ieast two electrical drive motors are foreseen, whose rotation speeds are adjustable, in which the drive motors are unregulated asynchronous motors, fed by a common realigner and the rotation speeds can be commonly adjusted. According to a further advantageous device for feeding card slivers in spinning machines, particularly draw frames, e.g. regulating draw frames, in which the card slivers are drawn from spin cans via several driven feed rollers attached to a feeding table and forwarded to a driven drawing system, whereby at least two electrical drive motors are foreseen, whose rotation speeds can be adjusted^ the drive motors are unregulated DC-motors, are fed by a common realigner and the rotation speeds can be commonly adjusted.<br>

The side view as shown in fig. 1 shows the feed region 1, the measuring region 2, the drawing system 3, the sliver delivery 4 of a draw frame, e.g. Trutzschler-draw frame HSR. In the feed region 1, three spin cans 5a to 5c (round cans) of a draw frame are arranged in two can rows (see fig. 2) below the sliver feed table 6 (creel) and the feed slivers 7a to 7c are drawn off via feed rollers 8a to 8c and taken to the drawing system 3. Each driven feed roller 8a to 8c has a carrier upper roller 9a to 9c allocated to it. In the region of the feed table 2, there are (fig. 2) six roller pairs 8, 9 each of which consists of an upper roller and a feed roller. Card slivers-7a to 7c are lifted out of the spin cans and guided on the feed table 6 to the draw frame. After passing the drawing mechanism 3, the stretched sliver card reaches a revolving plate of a can coiler and is then deposited in rings in the initial can 11. The feeding table 6 stretches up to the draw frame over the region of the entire sliver feed fixture. Through the card slivei feed fixture, from each spin can 5, one card sliver 7 each is taken out in direction B; and the feeding to the draw frame takes place respectively through a sliver feeding point, each of which has a roller pair 8a, 9a; 8b, 9b; 8c, 9c (roller feed). In the region of each lower roller 8a to 8c, a guiding organ 10a, 10b or 10c is foreseen for guiding the card sHver 7. The running direction of the card stivers 7a, 7b and 7c from the feed rollers in the direction of the drawing system 3 is designated A. The card slivers 7a to 7c are crushed between the roller pairs 8, 9. The card slivers drawn out of the spin cans 5a to 5c oscillate in a balloon-shape over the cans 5a to 5c, particularly in case of a high drawing velocity. After passing the feed rollers 8a to 8c, the card slivers 7a to 7c are calmed on the way. The direction of rotation of the feed<br><br>
5<br>
rollers 8a to 8c and the upper rollers 9a to 9c, is indicated by the curved arrow C, D. Connected to the feeding table 6 is a driven roller unit at the entrance of the draw frame, e.g. two glider lower rollers 12 and three glider upper rollers 13 lying beside one another. Each feed roller is driven by an own drive motor 17a to 17f, which is designed as inner running motor (standard motor), e.g. a frequency-controlled AC-asynchronous motor. The drive motors 17a to 17f are all connected to a common realigner 18, e.g. frequency realigner with rated value setter 19. The feed rollers 8a to 8c have the same diameter, e.g 100 mm. The rotation speeds n of the motor 17a, 17b and 17c get reduced in the working direction A, i e. n1&gt; n2&gt; n3 (motor 17a has a rotation speed n1, motor 17b has a rotation speed n2, motor 17c has a rotation speed n3). The rotation speeds n1, n2 and n3 are pregiven by the controlling and regulating unit 20, e.g. n1 = 900 min-1, n3 = 800 min-1, i.e. U1 = 282m/min, U2 = 267n1, min, U3=251m/min.  A corresponding thing is valid for the drive motors 17d, 17e, 17f(fig. 2)   In this way, the circumference speeds U of the feed roller gets reduced in working direction A. In this way it is possible to set the circumference speed U1, U2, U3 of the feed rollers 8 in such a way, that the feed tension of all card slivers 7 can be realized as same or almost same in the desired manner. Alternatively, all drive motors 17a to 17c (and the drive motors 17d to 17f not shown in fig. 1) could have the same rotation speed n, which yields an economic design form. In order to realize a (slightly) reducing circumference speed U of the feed rollers 8a to 8c (or 8d to 8f) in working direction A, the outer diameters d of the feed rollers 8a to 8c (or 8d to 8f) are correspondingly designed differently.<br>
As shown in fig. 2, on each side of the feeding table 6, a row of three spin cans 5 are set up parallel to'one another. During operation, one can respectively draw off a card sliver, from all six spin cans 5a to 5f simultaneously. However, during operation one can also proceed in a manner, that only on one side, e.g. card sliver is drawn out of three spiri cans 5a to 5c, while on the other side three spin cans 5d to 5f are replaced. Furthermore, for each side of the feeding table 6, there are respectively three feed rollers 8a to 8c or 8d to 8f arranged after one another in working direction in A. Two feed rollers are arranged co-axial to one another. The feed rollers 8a to 8f are respectively driven by an own rotation speed-controlled electrical motor 17a to 17f The electrical motors 17a to 17f are connected to a common electrical control and regulation unit 40 (see fig. 4), e.g. micro-computer. In fig. 2, the drive motor 17a to I7f allocaied.to the feed rollers, which are designed as outer running motors (drum motors), are connected to the common realigner 18. The drive motors 17a to 17f have the same rotation speed n. In order the realize a (slightly) reducing circumference speed U in working<br><br>
6<br>
direction A, the outer diameters of the drive motors 17a and 17d or 17b and 17e or 17c and 17f are designed differently. Alternatively, in the case of drive motors 17ato 17d having the same outer diameter, drive motors with different rotation speeds n are selected.<br>
According to the schematic depiction in fig. 3, there are eight feed rollers 8, each of which are allocated to a (not shown) spin can 5. All feed rollers 8 are driven by a common drive motor 17, e.g. AC-synchronous motor, whereby between the feed rollers 8 and the drive motor 17, there are (not shown) mechanical transmission elements like sprocket belts, sprocket belt wheels, gears or similar items   Through different angular gears, one can achieve a uniform tension draft. The drive of the feeding table 6 (creel) takes place by means of a rotation speed-regulatable drive motor 17. In the drawing system 3, the lower rollers 11 and II of the roller pairs 11/28 and 11/27 for the break draft, are driven by the rotation speed-regulatable drive motor 20. The drive motors 17 and 20 are commonly connected to realigner 18 and are fed by the realigner 18.<br>
According fig. 4, a draw frame, e.g Trutzschler-draw frame HSR, has a drawing system 3 before which there is a drawing system feed 2 and after which a drawing system outlet 4. The card slivers 7, coming out of cans (see fig. 1 and fig. 2), enter into the sliver guide 21 and are transported, drawn by the draw rollers 22, 23, against the measuring member 34   The drawing system 2 is conceived as 4-over-3-drawing system, i.e. it consists of three lower rollers I, II, III (I initial lower roller, II central lower roller. III feed lower roller) and four   upper rollers 25, 26, 27, 28. In the drawing system 3 the draft of the fibre structure 7 takes place from several card slivers 7. The draft is composed of break draft and main draft. The roller pairs 28/111 and 27/11 form the break draft field, and the roller pairs 27/11 and 25, 26/1 form the main draft field. The stretched card slivers reach a sliver guide 29 in the drawing system run-out and are drawn by means of the draw rollers 30, 31 through a sliver funnel 32, in which they are combined into a card sliver 7", which is subsequently deposited in cans (see fig. 1 item 11).<br>
The draw rollers 22, 23, the feed lower roller III and the central lower roller II, which are mechanically coupled by geared belt, are driven by the regulating motor 20, whereby a rated value can be pregiven. (The corresponding upper rollers 27 and 28 get carried along.) The initial lower roller I and the draw rollers 30, 31 are driven by the main motor 33. The regulating motor 20 and the main motor 33 each have an own regulator 34 or 35. The<br><br>
7<br>
regulation (rotation speed regulation) takes place through a closed regulating circuit, whereby a tacho generator 36 is allocated to the regulator 34 and a tacho generator 37 is allocated to the main motor 33. On the draw system feed 2, a magnitude proportional to the mass, e.g. the cross-section of the fed card sliver 7, is measured by the initial measuring organ 24, which is known from the document DE-A-44 04 326.  At the draw mechanism run-out 4, one gets the cross-section of the exited card sliver 7" from a run-out measuring organ 38 allocated to the silver funnel 32, which is known from the document DE-A-195 37 983. The central computing unit 40 (controiling and regulating unit), e.g. micro-computer with microprocessor gives to the regulator 34 a setting of a rated magnitude for the regulating motor 20. The measuring magnitude of both measuring organs 24 or 38 are conveyed during the drawing process to the central computing unit 40. From the measuring magnitude of the initial measuring organ 24 and from the rated value for the cross-section of the exited sliver card 7", the rated value for the regulating motor 20 is determined in the central computing unit 40. The measuring magnitude of the run-out measuring organ 30 serves the purpose of monitoring the exited card sliver 7" (output sliver monitoring). With the help of this regulating system, fluctuation of the cross-section of tlie fed card sliver 7 can be compensated by means of corresponding regulations of the draft process, or a relative restraint of the card sliver 7" by means of the measures as per the invention can be achieved, in that already in the region of the feeding table 6, erroneous draft of the slivers 7 are reduced or avoided. A storage/memory 39 is allocated to the central computing unit 40, where some signals of the controlling and regulating system can be stored for evaluation. Furthermore, a fiinction transformer 41, e.g. pegel converter, calculator or similar item, is connected to the computing unit 40, which is in contact with the rraligner 18 for the rotation speed-controlled electrical motors 17a to 17f On the basis of rated values which can be pregiven in the storage 49 for the rated value generator 19, the rotation speeds of the electrical motors 17a to 17f are set. By means of the common realigner 18, the rotation speed of the drive motors 17 and 20 are simultaneously altered in case of alteration of the feed, e.g. in case of run-up or run-down of the machine, but also for alteration during running operation. The rotation speed alteration of the drive motor 20 (regulating motor) for regulation, which is relatively small and serves the purpose of thickness correction of the fibre structure 7', takes place additionally.<br>
According to fig. 5, there are three drive motors 17a, 17b and 17c for the feed rollers 8a, 8b and 8c, whereby the feed roller 8c is a stand-by for all feed rollers and isTconnected to a tacho generator 43 as rotation speed-proportional giver by means of a shaft 44. The tacho generator<br><br>
8<br>
43 is connected to a frequency realigner 18 to which the rated value giver 19 is connected. The drive motors 17a to 17c are connected subsequent to the frequency realigner 18. The tacho generator 43 influences, through feeding of the actual rotation speed to the frequency realigner 18, the initial voltage and frequency of the frequency realigner 18 (feed realigner), in order to keep a fluctuation of the rotation speed of the drive motors 17a to 17c from the rated rotation speed which is pregiven by the rotation speed setter 19, as minimum as possible.<br>
According to fig. 6, to each drive motor 17a, 17b, 17c, e.g. frequency-controlled asynchronous motor (AC-motor), a tacho generator 43a, 43b or 43c is connected, which have a common attached average value forming unit 44, which is again connected to the frequency realigner 18. The drive motors 17a to 17c are connected to the subsequent frequency realigner 18, The frequency realigner 18 has a rated value setter 19 for the rotation speed rated value nrated, which is connected to the controlling and regulating unit 40. The rotation speed rated value nrated is formed proportional to the rotation speed of the drawing system feed roller III (see fig. 4). By means of the several tacho generators 43a to 43c (rotation speed actual value giver) and the average value forming unit 44, an average actual rotation speed naverage of several feed rollers 8a to 8c is determined. The calculated average rotation speed variation influences the frequency and/or the initial voltage of the feeding realigner 18. Figures 7a and 7b show for example the working method of the design form as shown in fig. 6. Corresponding to fig. 7a, the values of the rotation speed actual values, as measured by the tacho generators 43a to 43c, are : n1 =.470 rpm for feed roller 17a, n2 = 460 rpm for feed roller for 17b and n3=480 rpm for feed roller 17c. The AC-asynchronous motors 17a to 17c change their rotation speed n1, n2 or n3, depending on their structural design, and in case of load application. This variation form the rated rotation speed nmed is denoted as slippage. From the actual rotation speed n1, n2 and n3, an average rotation speed naverage - 470 rpm is calculated by the average value forming unit 44 and compared in the converter 18 with the rated rotation speed nnued = 500 rpm. The initial voltage and/or frequency is accordingly adapted and fed into the drive motors 17a, 17b and 17c, which thereby attain new rotation speed actual values: n'l == 500 rpm for feed roller 17a, n'2 = 490 rpm for feed roller 17b and n'3 = 510 rpm for feed roller 17c. The level of the actual rotation speed has been commonly shifted from n to n'. The new actual rotation speeds n'2 and n'3 reveal only minor variations from the rotation speed rated value nrated, and the actual rotation speed n'l is equal to be<br><br>
9<br>
rotation speed rated value nrated. In this way, the load-dependability gets compensated in a very simple manner to a great extent or even almost completely.<br>
One may also use synchronous motors, which can do without givers (tacho generators)   in this case regulation is not necessary, because AC-synchronous motors do not reveal any slippage.  All drive motors 17a to 17f can be commonly set by the realigner 18 during operation to a rated rotation speed, e.g. nrated = 500 rpm. by means of the rated value setter 19.<br>
Whenever DC-motors are used as drive motors, then (analogous to fig, 5 and 6) regulation is necessary, in order to compensate the load-dependability to a great extent.<br>
According to the invention, in a very simple manner, load-dependent rotation speed variation are compensated, the drive motors are fed by a common realigner and the rotation speeds can be commonly set, whereby a load-independent rotation speed of the drive motors is realized.<br><br>
