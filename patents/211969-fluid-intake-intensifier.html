FLUID INTAKE INTENSIFIES:<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a personal hygiene absorbent article, and more particularly, to an enhanced fluid intake intensifier for sanitary napkins or incontinence pads.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Sanitary napkins and incontinence pads (hereinafter also collectively referred to as "pads") are well known in the personal care and hygiene art. Such pads are generally constructed with a liquid pervious top sheet, a liquid impervious back sheet and an absorbent core disposed between the top and back sheets. The liquid pervious top sheet allows menstrual fluids or urine to seep through to the absorbent core which is designed to retain the fluids while the liquid impervious back sheet prevents further seepage.<br>
Problems which have existed and continue to exist in the art are the ability of the liquid pervious top sheet to allow quick seepage (intake) in one direction towards the conventional absorbent core while preventing return in the opposite direction (wet return) thereby reducing discomfort to the user. The rate at which intake occurs determines whether side leakage is reduced or whether fluids are appropriately concentrated in a desired target area.<br>
Over the years many solutions have been proposed. The planar design of sanitary napkins and incontinence pads have been modified in a multitude of ways in an effort to supplement the above-described general depth structure. Pads have been designed to conform in shape to the crotch area so that concave side portions fit the natural curves of the thighs. The reduction of the lateral sides of the planar design in conventional pads resulted in side leakage which soiled underwear and clothing. To address such side leakage, lateral wings and flaps were introduced making pad designs progressively more complicated.<br>
Supplementing planar design of the overall pad were efforts to concentrate menstrual discharge or urine to confined areas. Embossed channels were stamped onto the top sheet and through to the absorbent core to define physical target areas<br><br>
where it was hoped that fluid would concentrate, usually in central areas of the pad. Several shape designs for, the embossed areas have been proposed from the straight periphery, rectangular shape to variations such as curved or arcuate peripheries, hourglass and race-track configurations.<br>
Another direction attempted was the use of a surge. A surge is a strip made of a porous non-woven material having a planar size usually smaller than that of the absorbent core and used as a composite with the topsheet. Variations to the use of a surge include composites with the entire planar surface of a top sheet, A surge is laminated to the top sheet by thermal, ultrasonic or mechanical bonding, or combinations thereof, to ensure its position in the target area. Thus, a surge is laminated to the target area or laminated onto substantially the entire surface of the liquid pervious top sheet. Conventional surge materials have low porosity and resilience and deteriorate during bonding with the top sheet. Due to these drawbacks, the desired objectives to increase intake rate and reduce wet return have not been achieved.<br>
Another conventional approach is to use an absorbent material such as fiberized pulp in a double layer along the length of the core or concentrated in the central target area. However, this approach provides discomfort to the user especially during activity or movement.<br>
All of these efforts have produced less than complete satisfaction and the search continues for a solution to these problems which exist in the art. This disclosure presents a low density, lofty, non-woven pledget for either thick (slim) or thin (ultra-slim) sanitary napkins or incontinence pads, having all the advantages of and meeting the following objectives.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, it is a general object of the present invention to provide improved sanitary napkins and incontinence pads for personal care and hygiene.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a personal care and hygiene pad having a low density, lofty, non-woven pledget for intensive and concentrated intake of menstrual fluids or urine.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a pad having a pledget comprised of a low densified, nonwoven material.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a pledget for pads which is airlaid with the core for reducing bulk, which intensifies quick intake and<br><br>
prevents wet return in both thick and thin pads, and concentrates the fluid on the center of the pad.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a pledget for pads which is comprised of a composite of a fiber material and an airlaid material or combination of a fiber layer and an airlaid layer.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a combination of a spun-lace material cover sheet and a low density, lofty, non-woven pledget for reducing intake time and wet return, and increasing retention.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a pad which is less bulky in areas surrounding the central zone of the pad, allowing greater comfort for the user.<br>
Other objects of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant art following a study of this disclosure.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
One aspect of the present invention is a personal hygiene pad comprising an absorbent core and an intake intensifier pledget located on a central portion of the absorbent core. The pledget is comprised of a Thru Air Bonded Carded Web (TABCW) materials, an airlaid nonwoven material, a composite of a fiber material and an airlaid material, or combinations a fiber layer and an airlaid layer. The combination of a fiber layer and an airlaid layer is comprised of two distinct layers, a first layer and a second layer wherein the first layer is comprised of the fiber material and the second layer is comprised of the airlaid material. The personal hygiene pad is either a female sanitary napkin or an incontinence pad.<br>
The TABCW material provides a low densified lofty through air bonded carded web which has a specific weight basis level at about 15 to about 70 gsm (gram per m2). The TABCW material can comprise about 3 to about 10 denier staple fiber. The TABCW material can also comprise an Ultra Bulky (UB) bicomponent fiber or composites thereof. The airlaid nonwoven material is on about 50 to about 300 gsm (gram per m2) weight basis, and the basis provides for high void volume. The airlaid nonwoven material may include SAM (granule or fiber).<br>
The pledget may be further comprised of a first layer and a second layer, wherein the first layer is comprised of the TABCW material and the second layer is comprised of the airlaid non-woven material. The pledget may be further comprised of a composite of the TABCW and the airlaid nonwoven material.<br><br>
The absorbent core may be a SAP sheet which is a composite of SAM (granule or fiber) and pulp, tissue, a non-woven material or a mixture of fluff and SAM.  The absorbent core may farther comprise a tissue-like wrapping or nonwoven<br>
material.<br>
The pledget located on the central portion of the absorbent core has a length<br>
of at least about 50 mm and a width from about 30 to about 60 mm. The personal hygiene pad can further comprise a cover sheet, a wrapping material and a baffle portion. The pledget has a first surface situated under the cover sheet and a second surface adhesively bonded to at least one of the absorbent core or the wrapping material.   The personal hygiene pad can further comprise a fluid distribution layer.<br>
The cover sheet, the wrapping material, the absorbent core and the baffle portion can be compressed in that order to a total width of less than about 1 cm to form a channel around the pledget. The cover sheet is comprised of a liquid pervious material which is adapted to allow menstrual fluids or urine to seep through to the pledget. The baffle portion is comprised of a liquid impervious material adapted to prevent further seepage of menstrual fluids or urine.<br>
In another aspect of the personal hygiene pad of the present invention, a combination of a cover sheet comprised of a hydroentangled, hydroapertured spun-lace' material and a pledget comprised of a TABCW material is synergistically used to speed up intake time, reduce wet return and enhance retention by the absorbent core. The hydroentangled, hydroapertured spun-lace material can comprise a rayon fiber, and preferably a homogeneous mixture of 70% rayon fiber and 30% polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) polyester fiber.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, the personal hygiene pad can comprise a cover sheet, a first absorbent layer and a second absorbent layer with the first absorbent layer situated between the cover sheet and the second absorbent layer. In this aspect, the cover sheet comprises a hydroentangled, hydroapertured spun-lace material as described above.

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the first embodiment of the present invention will now be described. Fig. 1 shows a plan view of a sanitary napkin 10 comprised of wings 11, baffle portion 12, intake intensifier pledget 15, cover sheet 21, optional embossed channel 23 and absorbent core 25. Baffle portion 12 is shown extending along the entire periphery of sanitary napkin 10. Cover sheet 21 is shown transparent and indicated with an arrow and overlies pledget 15 and absorbent core 25 (depicted with phantom lines). Wings 11 can be considered lateral extensions of baffle portion 12 or cover sheet 21. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention does not require the wings as essential features to practice the invention and a modified embodiment without wings is included in the scope of this disclosure.<br>
As shown, located on a central portion (target area) of sanitary napkin 10 is intake intensifier pledget 15, surrounded by optional embossed channel 23. Fig. 1 depicts pledget 15 as having a rectangular shape, but it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that this shape is only provided by way of example and that other shapes<br><br>
such as a square, curved or arcuate peripheries* race-track or hour-glass configurations are all possible while remaining within the scope of this invention after having the benefit of this disclosure. Pledget 15 may also be in two layers, each layer having the same shape or different shape. For optimum target area coverage, it is preferred to have pledget lengths of at least 50 mm and widths of 30 to 60 mm.<br>
Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view taken along line 2-2 in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 is expanded from true scale in order to distinguish the various layers and is in actuality a depiction of a thin pad embodiment. Beginning from the top, Fig. 2 shows sanitary napkin 10 as comprising cover sheet 21, pledget 15, wrapping material 24, absorbent core 25 and baffle portion 12, Fig. 2 also depicts embossed channel 23 and fluid distribution layer 26. Cover sheet 21 and baffle 12 are sealed at their edges to form a sealing margin with various patterns and using various processes such as a mechanical press, heat, adhesive, ultrasonic, combinations thereof and the like.<br>
Wrapping material 24 can include tissue, an air-laid material or a non-woven material. Absorbent core 25 may be a SAP sheet which is a composite of SAM (granule or fiber) and pulp, tissue, a non-woven material, or a mixture of fluff and SAM.<br>
Cover sheet 21 is comprised of a transparent film, a non-woven material or a laminate of a film and a non-woven material, and is a liquid pervious layer that allows menstrual fluids to seep through to pledget 15.<br>
Cover sheet 21 can also comprise a hydroentangied, hydroapertured spun-lace material. For example, the spun-lace material can comprise a rayon fiber, and preferably, a homogeneous mixture of 70% rayon fiber and 30% PET polyester fiber. In addition, cotton fiber can be used in place of rayon. The ratio of rayon or cotton fiber to PET may vary from 10:0 to 0:10 and the average mass can range from 20 -40 gsm.<br>
In terms of its structure, the cover sheet can comprise layers of different fibers.   The relative area for hydro-aperture can vary depending on the kind of mesh pattern belt used, but should be at least 20% of the total surface area of the cover sheet.<br>
Channel 23 is formed by compressing cover sheet 21, absorbent core 25 and a portion of the baffle 12 to less than 1 cm width around and spaced apart from pledget 15.<br>
Pledget 15 is comprised of an airlaid nonwoven material, a TABCW material or a composite of a fiber material and an airlaid material, or combinations a fiber layer and an airlaid layer.   For the airlaid nonwoven material, it is preferred to use<br><br>
a thermally-bonded airlaid adhesive bonding process on a 50 to 300 gsm (gram per m2) weight basis for high void volume to affix the material to absorbent core 25. Alternatively, a binder-bonded or a multi-bonded air-laid material may be used to bond the material to absorbent core 25. The airlaid material may include SAM. For the TABCW material, it is preferred to use low densified lofty through air bonded carded web which has a specific weight basis level at 15 to 70 gsm which comprises a 3 to 6 denier staple fiber, and more preferably, Ultra Bulky (UB) bicomponent fiber or composites thereof.<br>
The airlaid nonwoven material and TABCW have relatively higher void volume capacity for greater absorption than conventional surge materials or cores, making the present invention particularly suitable for thin pads. In addition to greater relative absorption of menstrual fluids, airlaid nonwoven materials and TABCW provide rapid absorption to prevent any unnecessary discomfort to the user by slow seepage from cover sheet 21. The high void volume of the present pledget, in addition to rapid absorption, provides greater retention of menstrual fluids to avoid wet return. A combination of top TABCW and bottom air-laid is preferred to optimize its function when combined together.<br>
Unlike conventional methods of using double layers of core materials or the surge layer laminated to the cover sheet, the present invention introduces the use of airlaid nonwoven materials for pledget 15 to provide a more zoned, area concentrated and intensified fluid intake which prevents lateral run-off and leakage. The low densified nonwoven materials used also provide a more cushioned feel due to their resiliency while being less physically bulky in a topographically limited zone.<br>
Wrapping material 24 is comprised of cellulose tissue, air-laid or a non-woven material and its function is to prevent possible migration of the absorbent SAP sheet material of core 25. Absorbent core 25 is of a SAP sheet material comprised of a densified or undensified, non-woven, super absorbent material (SAM), a non-woven tissue or pulp material, or combinations thereof. Wrapping material 24 can be in an E-fold or C-fold configuration.<br>
The optional fluid distribution layer 26 is comprised of non-woven material of pulp fibers and its function is to help distributing menstrual fluids-keeping integrity.<br>
Baffle portion 12 is comprised of film, a non-woven material, a combination of a film and a non-woven material, other materials of inorganic compounds or combinations thereof, and functions as a liquid impervious back sheet for preventing further seepage,<br><br>
While the preferred materials for the various components of the present invention have been described, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that other suitable materials can be substituted with equal efficacy while remaining within the scope of this invention and after having the benefit of this disclosure.<br>
It has also been unexpectedly discovered that a combination of a cover sheet comprised of a hydroentangled, hydroapertured spun-lace material and a pledget comprised of a TABCW material used synergistically, increases the rate of intake of fluids in the direction towards the pledget and absorbent core. This increased rate enhances the prevention of wet return, concentrates the fluid in the target area and thereby reduces discomfort to the user.<br>
Example<br>
This example shows tests for a pledget according to the present invention with various degrees of additional absorbent materials selected from TABCW material (T), two air laid materials (A and A') or combinations thereof, in various further combinations with a cover sheet (C) made of a hydroentangled, hydroapertured spun-lace material.<br>
Specifically, the TABCW material used had an average mass of 25 gsm, airiaid material 1 (A) had an average mass of 130 gsm and a density of 0.09 g/cc, and airiaid material 2 (A') had an average mass of 175 gsm and a density of 0.08 g/cc. The cover sheet comprised a homogeneous mixture of 70% rayon fiber and 30% PET polyester fiber with an average mass 30 gsm, and each hydroaperture was in a diamond shape made into a mesh pattern by hydro-entanglement. The total surface area for the hydroapertures was approximately 25.1 %.<br>
A pad constructed with a pledget according to the present invention and a cover sheet having the materials identified above has a body-side liner which provides a cotton-like appearance and feel with the least possible lint&gt; and which achieves superior intake rate and reduces wet return. For the tests, the following protocols were utilized.<br>
1. Material caliper for thickness measurements. The caliper of a material is a measure of its thickness, and is measured at 0,05 psi with a Starret-type bulk tester in millimeter (mm) units. In practice, 10 repetitions of any measurement should be made.<br><br>
2.	Rate block intake test. This test is used to determine the intake time of a<br>
known quantity of fluid into a material and/or material system. The test apparatus<br>
consists of a rate block, a funnel and a timer or stop watch. A 4 X 4 inch (102 mm2)<br>
piece of a pledget and/or comparative absorbent materials, and a cover sheet were cut<br>
for each test. The sample cover sheet was placed over the pledget and/or<br>
comparative absorbent materials to be tested and the rate block was placed on top of<br>
the two materials.<br>
For the tests, 2 ml each of an artificial menses fluid was prepared and delivered into the test apparatus funnel and the timer was initiated. The fluid moved from the funnel into a capillary where it was delivered to the material system. The timer was stopped when all the fluid was absorbed into the material system as observed from the chamber in the test apparatus. The intake time for a known quantity of test fluid was recorded for a given material system. This value is a measure of a materials system's absorbency, with lower intake time representing a more absorbent system. Five to ten repetitions were performed to determine average intake time.<br>
3,	Rewet test for wet return. This test is used to determine the amount of fluid<br>
that will come back to the surface of a cover sheet when a load is applied. The<br>
amount of fluid that comes back through the surface is called the rewet value. If<br>
more fluid comes back to the surface, the rewet value is larger, while smaller<br>
amounts of fluid return results in lower rewet values. Lower rewet values are<br>
associated with a dryer material and hence a dryer pad. When considering rewet,<br>
three properties are important - (a) intake, if the material/system does not have a<br>
good intake speed, the fluid has a greater tendency to rewet; (b) fluid hold, the more<br>
the absorbent holds onto the fluid the less is available for rewet; and (c) flow-back,<br>
the more the cover prohibits fluid from coming back through, the lower the rewet.<br>
In the testing, 2 ml of artificial menses fluid was introduced into the rate block apparatus and allowed to absorb into a 4" x 4" sample of the cover material which was placed on top of a 4" x 4" pledget and/or comparative absorbent materials. The fluid was allowed to interact with the system for 1 minute with the rate block resting on top of the materials. The material system was placed onto a closed bag, partially filled with a saline solution. The fluid back was positioned on top of a lab jack. Pieces of blotter paper were weighed and placed on top of the material system. The bag with the material system was raised against a fixed acrylic plate using the lab jack until a total of 1 psi was applied.<br><br>
The pressure was held and fixed for 3 minutes after which it was released and the blotter pap^r weighed. The blotter paper should have retained any fluid that was transferred to it from the cover/absorbent system. The difference in weight between the original blotter and the blotter after the absorption experiment is the re wet value.<br>
4. Intake and staining test. An intake/staining test enables observations for stain size, intensity and fluid retention in components to be observed with fluid flow rate and pressure.<br>
A material system measuring 4" x 4" was placed beneath an acrylic plate having a 1/8" (3mm) diameter hole bored into the center. A piece of 1/8" tubing was connected to the hole with a fitting. Artificial menses fluid was delivered to the sample using a syringe pump at a specified rate and for a specified volume. In these experiments, the pump was programmed to deliver a total volume of 1 ml to the samples which were under pressures of between 0.00 psi and 0.09 psi. These pressures were applied using a weight which was placed on top of the acrylic plates and distributed evenly. The flow rate of the pump was programmed to deliver at a rate of 1 ml/sec.<br>
The stain size area for the tested cover sheets was measured manually and the amount of fluid in each component of the system was measured by weight before and after absorption of the fluid. Fluid retention was measured by weighing the cover sheet before and after fluid introduction. Average stain size fluid retention were determined from at least five repetitions at each pressure.<br>
The following tabulates the results and the abbreviations in the tables are as follows,<br>
CA    = Cover-Airlaid 1 CTA   = Cover-TABCW-Airlaid 1 CAA* = Cover-Airlaid 1-Airlaid 2 CTAA' = Cover-TABCW-Airlaid 1-Airlaid 2<br><br><br><br>
intake time and increasing absorbent capacity significantly reduces wet return (Rewet). When absorbent capacity is low, use of a TABCW pledget can help reduce the retention load for the cover sheet and reduce the stain size.<br>
With reference to Fig. 3, a second embodiment of the present invention is described. Fig. 3 is a plan view of sanitary napkin 30 comprised of wings 31, baffle portion 32, intensifier strip 35, cover sheet 41 and absorbent core 45. Baffle portion 32 is shown extending along the entire periphery of sanitary napkin 30. Cover sheet 41 is shown transparent and indicated with an arrow and overlies strip 35 and absorbent core 45 (depicted with phantom lines). As stated above for the first embodiment, the second embodiment may be practiced with equal efficacy as far as the function of the intensifier strip is concerned, with a pad having no wings. Located in a midline portion which includes the target area of sanitary napkin 30 is intake intensifier strip 35. Fig. 3 depicts strip 35 as being in a rectangular shape, but other geometric shapes such as an hour-glass configuration are possible. For optimum target area coverage the length of strip 35, shown in Fig. 3, is enlarged relative to pledget 15 shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Either pledget 15 shown in Fig. 1 or strip 35 shown in Fig. 3, can also be "expanded" to span the entire surface area over absorbent cores 25 (Fig, 1) or 45 (Fig. 3), respectively. To depict this further aspect of the present invention, absorbent cores 25 (Fig. 1) and 45 (Fig. 3) were delineated with phantom lines to demonstrate this capability. In this aspect, one skilled in the art will recognize that the concept of "pledget" or "strip" become merged as they are extended to span the entire surface area over the absorbent cores.<br>
Fig. 4 is a cross sectional view taken along line 4-4 in Fig, 3. As in Fig. 2 (above), Fig. 4 is also an expanded depiction from true scale in order to distinguish the various layers and is also, in actuality, a depiction of another thin pad embodiment. The layers shown in Fig. 4 can be compressed to a total width of less than 1 cm to form a channel around intake intensifier strip 35 if desired.<br>
Starting from the top, Fig. 4 shows sanitary napkin 30 as comprising cover sheet 41, strip 35, wrapping material 44, absorbent core 45, optional fluid distribution layer 46 and baffle portion 32. Cover sheet 41 and baffle portion 32 are sealed at their edges to form a sealing margin with various patterns and using various processes as noted above.<br>
The materials used for strip 35 (and the other components) are identical to<br><br>
those described for the first embodiment, above, and have equal efficacy in practice in terms of the selected materials.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a plan view of sanitary napkin 50 which is a third, thick pad embodiment of the present invention, and which is comprised of wings 51, baffle portion 52, intake intensifier pledget 55, cover sheet 61 and absorbent core 65. Baffle portion 52 is shown extending along the entire periphery of sanitary napkin 50, Cover sheet 61 is shown transparent and indicated with an arrow and intensifier pledget 55 and absorbent core 65.<br>
Situated on a central position encompassing the optimal target area of sanitary napkin 50 is intake intensifier pledget 55. Fig. 5 shows an hour glass shaped pledget 55. For optimum target area coverage, pledget 55 is shaped to conform to the vaginal area as shown. Various other shapes such as a rectangular or racetrack pattern are contemplated as being within the scope of this disclosure.<br>
Fig. 6 is a cross sectional view taken from line 6-6 in Fig. 5. Fig. 6 depicts a thick pad cross-section, but one skilled in the art will appreciate that the pledget 55 (Fig. 5) may be made of airlaid and/or TABCW as in a thin pad.<br>
Fig, 6 shows sanitary napkin 50 as comprising cover sheet 61, pledget 55, wrapping material 64, absorbent core 65 and baffle portion 52. As with the second embodiment, the materials used for pledget 50 and the other components are identical to those described for the first embodiment. Absorbent core 65 may be a SAP sheet or may be substituted with a mixture of fiberized pulp (fluff) and SAM. Absorbent core 65 may be comprised of two layers, a top layer made of unwrapped fluff and a bottom layer made of wrapped or unwrapped fluff and SAM mixture. Alternatively, the SAM mixture can be located between the two layers. Pad 50 may also optionally include a distribution or retention layer 66.<br>
Additionally, Fig. 6 shows a variation to pledget 55. One skilled in the art will appreciate that such a variation is equally applicable to the intake intensifier pledget 15 shown in Fig. 2 and the intake intensifier strip 35 depicted in Fig. 4 after the following disclosure. Pledget 55 is shown, by way of example, as being comprised of a first layer 56 (in an hour-glass configuration) and a second layer 51 (in a rectangular configuration). First layer 56 is comprised of a TABCW material and second layer 57 is comprised of an airlaid nonwoven material. This combination and arrangement has provided particular success in achieving the objectives of the present invention, but it should be clear to one skilled in the art that the first layer need not be on top or the bottom of the second layer as both alternative and relative positions are equally efficacious.<br><br>
Various modifications and alterations to the present invention may be appreciated based on a review of this disclosure. These changes and additions are intended to be within the scope and spirit of this invention as defined by the following claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
