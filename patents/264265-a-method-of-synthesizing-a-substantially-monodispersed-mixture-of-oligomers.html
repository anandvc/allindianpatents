FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods of synthesizing oligomeric compounds, and<br>
more particularly, to methods of synthesizing oligomer compounds comprising polyethylene glycol moieties. The present invention provides improved methods for synthesizing oligomers comprising polyethylene glycol moieties. Methods according to embodiments of the present invention may utilize reaction conditions that are milder and efficacious than those taught by conventional methods <br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
One of the most important strategies for improving administration of polypeptides has<br>
been the conjugation of polypeptides to various moieties, such as polymeric moieties, to modify the physiochemical properties of polypeptide drugs to increase resistance to acidic and enzymatic degradation and to enhance penetration of such drugs across mucosal membranes. For example, Abuchowski and Davis have described various methods for derivatizating enzymes to provide water-soluble, non-immunogenic, in vivo stabilized products ("Soluble polymers- Enzyme adducts". Enzymes as Drugs, Eds. Holcenberg and Roberts, J. Wiley and Sons, New York, N. Y., (1981)). Abuchowski and Davis discuss various ways of conjugating enzymes with polymeric materials, such as dextrans, polyvinyl pyrrolidones, glycopeptides, polyethylene glycol and polyamino acids. The resulting conjugated polypeptides are reported to retain their biological activities and solubility in water for parenteral applications.<br>
Furthermore, in U S Pat. No. 4,179, 337, Davis et al. report that polypeptides can be coupled to polyethylene glycol or polypropropylene glycol having a molecular weight of 500 to 20,000 daltons to provide a physiologically active non- immunogenic water soluble polypeptide composition. The polyethylene glycol or polypropylene glycol is reported to protect the polypeptide from loss of activity and the composition can be injected into the mammalian circulatory system with substantially no immunogenic response. However, these conjugates may not be suitable for oral administration.<br>
Other researchers have shown that polyethylene glycol linked to a protein improves stability against denaturation and enzymatic digestion. (Boccu et al. Pharmacological Research Communication 14,11-120 (1982)). However, these polymers do not contain<br><br>
components for enhancing membrane interaction. Thus, the resulting conjugates suffer from the same problems as noted above and are not suitable for oral administration.<br>
For example, U. S. Patent No. 5,681, 811 to Ekwuribe et al., and related U. S. Patent Nos. 5,438, 040 and 5,359, 030, describe stabilized, conjugated polypeptide complexes including a therapeutic agent coupled to an oligomer that includes lipophilic and hydrophilic moieties. A preferred subset of the polypeptide-oligomer conjugates described in the '811 patent includes a polymer having a linear polyalkylene glycol moiety and a linear alkyl moiety.<br>
In the present invention the inventors discuss novel synthesis methods of manufacturing monomethyl ethers of PEG (also known as methyl-terminated PEG or mPEG).The instant invention relates to synthesis of oligomers compounds that are convenient due to lesser number of reaction steps included with desirable reaction conditions with easy purification methods. The compounds of the present invention addresses the discussed problems, further the resulting conjugates of the present invention are suitable for oral administration with enhanced in-vivo bioavailability and other advantageous attributes.<br>

Triethyleneglycol monomethyl ether (50 g, 304.5 mmol) was taken in tert-butyl acrylate (35.1 g, 274 mmol) and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes. Sodium methoxide (1.97 g, 36.5 mmol) was added and stirred at ambient temperature for 8-10<br><br>
hours. The reaction completion was checked by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (200 mL) and the organic layer was washed with water, saturated brine solution and dried over sodium sulphate. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain tert-butyl 2,5,8,11-tetraoxatetradecan-14-oate (67 g, 75.3 %).<br>

To tert-butyl 2,5,8,1 l-tetraoxatetradecan-14-oate (65 g, 222.6 mmol) (example-1), was added p- toluenesulfonic acid (21.16 g,lll mmol) and water (31.7 mL). The contents were heated to 80° C and stirred at that temperature for 2 h. The completion of the reaction was monitor by TLC. The reaction mixture was cooled to 0 °C and basified to pH 10 to 11 using sodium hydroxide solution (17.7 g dissolved in 65 mL water). The contents were stirred at 25-30°C forlO minutes. Added Ethyl acetate (65 mL x 2), stirred and separated the layer. The aqueous layer was cooled to 0 to 5 °C and the pH was adjusted to 3.5 to 4 using 11 N HCl solution and the product was extracted to methylene chloride (120 ml x 2). The combined organic layer was washed with water, brine solution and dried over sodium sulphate. The solvent was removed under vacuum to afford 2,5,8,1 l-tetraoxatetradecan-14-oic acid (40.5 g, 77.1 %).<br>

Added slowly thionyl chloride (26.2 g, 220 mmol) was added by maintaining the temperature at 0 to 5 °C. The reaction mixture was refluxed at 40 to 45 °C for 2 hours. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum and the syrup (acid chloride) obtained was dissolved in methylene chloride (40 mL). In a separate 500 ml 3-necked round bottom flask N-Hydroxy succinimide (13.6 g, 118 mmol) in methylene chloride (100ml) was taken, the mass was cooled to 0 to 5°C and triethylamine (22.2 g, 220 mmol) was added. Added slowly the acid chloride obtained above at 0 to 5°C. The temperature of the reaction mixture was brought to room temperature and stirred for 3 hours. The reaction completion was monitored by TLC(Thin layer chromatography). The mass was acidified to pH 4-5 and product was extracted to methylene chloride (100 ml x3). Combined organic layer was washed with 1.5 M HCl solution, water, followed by 10 % sodium bicarbonate solution and saturated sodium chloride solution. The organic layer was dried over sodium sulphate and treated with neutral alumina (10 % w.r.t [ with respect to] starting material) and charcoal (10% w.r.t starting material) and filtered over celite. The fUtrate was concentrated under vacuum to remove the solvent completely to obtain l-(4,7,10,13-tetraoxatetradecan-l-oyloxy)pyrrolidine-2,5-dione ( 40 g, 71%).<br>
