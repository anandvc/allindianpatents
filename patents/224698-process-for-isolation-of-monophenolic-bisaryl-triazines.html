				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a novel, efficient, economic and general-purpose process for<br>
isolating monophenolic-bisaryl triazine compounds from polyphenolic-triazines<br>
compounds and other impurities. More specifically, this invention relates to a process<br>
for isolating the monophenoJic-bisaryf triazine compounds by contacting it with a base,<br>
an alcohol and/or a hydrocarbon solvent.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Exposure to sunlight and other sources of ultraviolet (UV) radiation is known<br>
to cause degradation of a wide variety of materials, especially polymeric materials. For<br>
example, polymeric materials such as plastics often discolor and/or become brittle as a<br>
result of prolonged exposure to UV light. Accordingly, a large body of art has been<br>
developed directed towards materials such as UV light absorbers and stabilizers which<br>
are capable of inhibiting such degradation. Other areas of applications for the UV light<br>
absorbers include cosmetics (as sunscreen agents), fibers, spandex, inks, photographic<br>
materials, and dyes.<br>
A class of materials known to be UV light absorbers are compounds which have<br>
aromatic substituents at the 2-, 4-, and 6- positions of the 1,3,5-triazine ring, and in which<br>
at least one of the aromatic rings has a hydroxyl substituent at the ortho position to the<br>
point of attachment to the triazine ring, rn general, this class of compounds is well known<br>
in the art Disclosures of a number of such triazine UV fight absorbers (UVA's) as weU as<br>
processes for preparing can be found in the following references and references cited<br>
therein, all of which are incorporated by reference as fully set forth herein: U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,239,275; U.S. Patent No. 6, 239.276; U.S. Patent No. 6,242,597; U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,225,468 and WO 00/29392.<br>
A preferred class of triazine UVA's are asymmetrical monophenolic-bisaryl triazines<br>
UVA's based on the 2-(2,4-dihydroxyaryl)-4,6-bisaryl-1,3,5-triazines, e.g., compounds<br>
where there are two non-phenolic aromatic groups, and one phenolic aromatic group that<br>
is derived from resorcinol, or substituted resorcinol. The 4-hydroxyl group of the parent<br>
compound. 2-(2,4-dihydroxyaryl)-4,6-bisaryl-1,3,5-tria2ine, is generally functionalized to<br>
make 2-(2-hydroxy-4-oxyaryl)-4,6-bisaryl-1,3,5-triazine derivatives for end use.<br>
There are several approaches reported in the literature to make the<br>
preferred, 2-(2,4-dihydroxyary1)-4,6-bisaryl-1,3,5-triazine UVA's. (For a review of the<br>
previously known methods for making triazine UVA's, please see the following articles. 1.<br>
H. Brunetti and C. E. Luethi, Helvetica Chimica Acta, vol 55,1972, pages 1566-1595; 2. S.<br>
Tanimoto and M. Yamagata, Senryo to Yakahin, vol. 40(12), 1995, pages 325-339.)<br>
A majority of the approaches consists of three stages. The first stage, which can<br>
involve single or multi-steps from the commercial raw materials, deals with the preparation<br>
of the key intermediate, 2-chloro-4,6-bisaryl-1,3,5-triazine, which is subsequently arylated<br>
in the second stage with 1,3-dihydroxybenzene (resorcinol) or a substituted 1,3-<br>
dihydroxybenzene in the presence of Lewis acid to form the parent compound 2-(2,4-<br>
dihydroxyaryl)-4,6-bisaryl-1,3,5-triazine. The parent compound 2-(2,4-dihydroxyaryl)-4,6-<br>
bisaryl-1,3,5-triazine, as mentioned above, is generally functionalized further, e.g.,<br>
alkylated, to make the final product 2-(2-hydroxy-4-oxyaryl)-4.6-bisaryl-1,3,5-triazine.<br>
General Scheme for Making 2-(2-hydroxy-4-oxyaryl)-4,6-bisaryl-triazines<br>
Stage 1: Preparation of 2-chloro-4.6-bisarvl-1.3.S-triazine<br>
It has been recognized that the most versatile and economical method to prepare<br>
asymmetrical monophenolic-bisaryl triazine UVA's is to use a Friedel-Crafts reaction on<br>
cyanuric chloride with non-phenoiic aromatics to first form 2-chloro-4,6-bisaryl-1,3.5-<br>
triazine, followed by another Friedel-Crafts reaction with the phenolic aromatic, in this<br>
case resorcinot, to make the desired monophenolic-bisaryl-triazine. However, it has been<br>
realized in the prior art (see, U.S. Patent No. 3,394,134) that this known process as<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,268,474 gives, only in exceptional cases, rise to the desired<br>
disubstituted derivatives of cyanuric chloride with some selectivity. Even when the<br>
aromatic compound and cyanuric chloride are reacted in molar proportions (1:1), the result<br>
is in general a mixture which contains mono-, di-, and tri-aryl substituted products, and, in<br>
addition, unreacted cyanuric chloride (U.S. Patent No. 3,394,134) (Scheme 1).<br>
Using the above mentioned process, a useful yield of the desired intermediate 2-<br>
chtoro-4,6-bisaryl-1,3,5-triazine is obtained only with m-xylene as the aromatic reactant<br>
(GB 884802). 2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bis(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine. free of<br>
polyresorcinol-triazine impurities, was prepared from the isolated 2-chtoro-4,6-bis(2,4-<br>
dimethylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine that was purified by recrystallization, before reacting with<br>
resorcinol in a second step (see U.S. Patent No. 3,244,708). The isolation and<br>
recrystallization of the 2-chloro-4,6-bis(2,4-dimmethylphenyl)-1l3,5-tria2ine results in yield<br>
loss. With other aromatics, a difficult to separate mixture of ail possible products are<br>
formed with no selectivity for the desired 2-chloro-4,6-bisaryl-1,3,5-triazine (For example,<br>
see H. Brunetti and C. E. Luethi, Helvetica Chimica Acta, vol 55,1972, page 1575 and S.<br>
Tanimoto and M. Yamagata, Senryo to Yakahm, vol. 40(12), 1995, pages 325-339).<br>
When the reaction mixture from the first Friedel-Crafts reaction (Scheme 1) without<br>
any purification is treated in a subsequent Friedel-Crafts reaction with resorcinol, the<br>
bisaryl- derivative leads to tfie formation of desired monoresorcinol-bisaryl-triazine, and<br>
the monoaryl-substrtuted product leads to the formation of monoaryl-bisresorcinol<br>
derivative. Whereas, the unreacted cyanuric chloride leads to the formation of bis-and<br>
tris-resorcinol-triazine derivatives, i.e. pofyresorcinol-triazines (see Scheme 2).<br>
SCHEME 2: FORMATION OF POLYRESORCINOL TRIAZINE IMPURITIES IN THE<br>
FRIEDEL-CRAFTS REACTION WITH RESORCINOL<br>
These polyresorcinol-triazine impurities (triazine ring with more than one resorcinol<br>
attached), lead to yellowing in the use of the UV absorbers prepared from the<br>
monoresorcinol-bisaryl-triazine in various polymer substrates, e.g., in polycarbonates, in<br>
lacquers, in automotive top-coatings, etc. Thus it is highly desirable for many such<br>
applications that the monoresorcinol-bisaryl-triazine derivative is free of these impurities.<br>
Unfortunately, there has been no process known in the literature to isolate<br>
monoresorcinol-bisaryl-triazine derivative from the mixture containing polyresorcinol<br>
impurities. The lack of selectivity for the bisaryl substitution in the Friedel-Crafts reaction<br>
of cyanuric chloride, coupled with the problems associated with the isolation of the bisaryl<br>
intermediate and the monoresorcinol-bisaryl-triazine derivative, had severely limited the<br>
usefulness of the most versatile and economic approach to the preferred class of triazine<br>
UVA's.<br>
To overcome this obstacle, and to exclude the formation of polyresorcinol-triazines,<br>
other economically less attractive routes have been developed in which either cyanuric<br>
chloride was not used as starting material, and the triazine ring was synthesized by<br>
different methods, or the formation of polyresorcinol impurities was excluded by means of<br>
the circuitous routes (For example, see: A. Ostrogovich, Chemiker-Zertung No. 78, page<br>
738, 1912; von R. Hirt. H. Nidecker and R. Berchtold, Helvitica Chimica Acta, vol. 33,<br>
page 1365,1950; H. Brunetti and C. E. Luethi, Helvetica Chimica Acta, vol 55, 1972, page<br>
1575; U.S. Patent No. 4,092,466; U.S. Patent No. 5.084,570; U.S. Patent No. 5,106,972;<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,438.138; U.S. Patent No. 5,726,310; U.S. Patent No. 6,020.490; EP<br>
0941989 and Japanese Patent 09059263)<br>
An alternate direct approach for the preparation of monoresorcinoi-bisaryl-triazine<br>
as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,225,468 B1 from cyanuric chloride also results in the<br>
formation of polyresorcinol products, and no method was disclosed to isolate the<br>
monoresorcinol-bisaryl-triazine product from the mixture.<br>
More recently, a major breakthrough discovery in the field has led to the<br>
development of a process for making the desired bisaryl-monochbro-triazine with<br>
exceptionally high selectivity from the Friedel-Crafts reaction of cyanuric halide with<br>
aromatics in general (WO 00/29392). However, the selectivity is not 100%, and that stilt<br>
leads to the formation of small amounts of undesired polyresorcinol impurities, in the<br>
subsequent reaction with resorcinol in a one-pot process, and tris-aryl-triazine impurity.<br>
As is apparent from the above discussion, it would be a very valuable and highly<br>
desirable addition in the field of triazine UV absorbers for a method to isolate<br>
monophenolic-bisaryl triazine that is free from the polyphenolic- or polyresorcinol-triazine<br>
impurities regardless of the synthesis process.<br>
One of the advantages of the present invention is a highly efficient and very<br>
economical method of isolating monophenolic-bisaryl triazine that is substantially free from<br>
polyphenolic or polyresorcinol-triazine impurities, irrespective of the process of its making,<br>
without the need for recrystallization. Thus the present invention also eliminates the need<br>
for purifying and isolating the intermediate 2-chloro-4,6-bisaryl-1,3,5-triazine from the first<br>
Friedel-Crafts reaction of aromatics with cyanuric chloride regardless of its selectivity, and<br>
allows to do the second Friedel-Crafts reaction with phenols, such as resorcinol, in a one-<br>
pot process to make monophenot-bisaryl-triazines.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is a method to isolate monophenolic-<br>
bisaryl triazine compounds from poryphenotic- or polyresorcinol- triazine, trisaryl-triazine,<br>
resorcinol (or substituted resorcinol), phenols, chlorobenzene or dichlorobenzene<br>
impurities.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present involves a process for isolating a monophenolic-bisary! triazine<br>
compound from polyphenolic- or polyresorcinol-triazine impurities. Typically, these<br>
impurities result from a synthesis reaction to make the monophenolic-bisaryl triazine<br>
compounds from a Friedel-Crafts based reaction as illustrated in General Scheme 1 and<br>
General Scheme 2 above. However, it should be noted that the present isolation<br>
process can be utilized to isolate monophenolic-bisaryl triazine compounds from<br>
polyphenolic- or polyresorcinol-triazine and other impurities in general and should not be<br>
limited to any particular synthesis route. In fact, the present process may be generally<br>
used to isolate monophenolic-bisaryl triazine compounds from polyphenolic- or<br>
polyresorcinol-triazine and other undesired compounds whether or not generated from a<br>
synthesis reaction.<br>
The monophenolic-bisaryl triazine compound has the general Formula 1<br>
where Ar1 and Ar2 are the same or different and are radicals of the compound of<br>
Formula 2<br>
and where R1 is hydrogen and R2, R3, R4 and R5, are the same or different and are<br>
hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 24 carbon atoms, haloalkyl of 1 to 24 carbon atoms, aryl of 6 to<br>
24 carbon atoms, alkenyl of 2 to 24 carbon atoms, acyl of 1 to 24 carbon atoms,<br>
cycioalkyt of 1 to 24 carbon atoms, cycloacyl of 5 to 24 carbon atoms, aralkyl of 7 to 24<br>
carbon atoms, or aracyl of 6 to 24 carbons atoms, substituted or unsubstituted<br>

SR, SO2R. and optionally with either of R3 and R4 or R4 and R5 taken together being a<br>
part of a saturated or unsaturated fused carbocyclic ring and where each R, R', Re. R7.<br>
Rs, R9. and R10 are the same or different and each is hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 24 carbon<br>
atoms, haloalkyl of 1 to 24 carbon atoms, aryl of 6 to 24 carbon atoms, alkenyl of 2 to 24<br>
carbon atoms, acyl of 1 to 24 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl of 1 to 24 carbon atoms,<br>
cycloacyl of 5 to 24 carbon atoms, araikyi of 7 to 24 carbon atoms, or aracyl of 6 to 24<br>
carbons atoms, substituted or unsubstituted biphenylene, substituted or unsubstituted<br>
naphthalene, and optionally with either of R6 and R7, R7 and R8, R8 and R9, or Rg and<br>
Rio, taken together being a part of a saturated or unsaturated fused carbocyclic ring<br>
optionally containing O, N, or S atoms in the ring, and R6, R7, R8, R9, and R1O, may be an<br>
alkoxy of 1 to 24 carbons, and Y is a direct bond, O, NR", or SR", wherein R" is<br>

24 carbon atoms, alkenyl of 2 to 24 carbon atoms, acyl of 1 to 24 carbon atoms,<br>
cycloalkyl of 1 to 24 carbon atoms, cycloacyl of 5 to 24 carbon atoms, aralkyl of 7 to 24<br>
carbon atoms, or aracyl of 6 to 24 carbons atoms.<br>
A preferred compound of Formula 1 is<br>
where R2. R3 is hydrogen, an alkyl of 1 to 24 carbon atoms or substituted alkyl of 1 to 24<br>
carbon atoms.<br>
A more preferred compound of Formula 1 is:<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a "product mixture" which comprises<br>
the compound of Formula 1 as well as polyphenolic- or polyresorcinol-triazine and other<br>
impurities is contacted with a base. These impurities may result from a synthesis<br>
process where reactants, undesired by-products, entrained solvents, and the like, are<br>
agglomerated together with the desired compound of Formula 1. However, it should be<br>
noted that the product mixture does not have to result from a synthesis process and<br>
includes any mixture where the desired compound of Formula 1 is combined with<br>
undesired polyphenolic- or polyresorcinol-triazine compounds and other impurities.<br>
The product mixture can be in solid or liquid form. For example, in the Friedel-<br>
Crafts reaction, the reaction is typically stopped by quenching with water to break the<br>
aluminum complex. The compound of Formula 1 and undesired impurities are<br>
precipitated out to form the product mixture in a solid form. This precipitated solid form<br>
may be directly added to the base, or dissolved with a solvent and added to the base.<br>
Any suitable solvent may be used to dissolve the product mixture. Examples of solvents<br>
that may be used to dissolve the product mixture include methylisobutylketone,<br>
methylethylketone, cyclohexanone, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, methylene chloride,<br>
chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene,<br>
toluene, xylenes and mixtures thereof.<br>
The bases that are suitable to be used in the present invention include inorganic<br>
bases, organic bases and mixtures thereof. Inorganic bases include LiOH, NaOH, KOH,<br>
Mg(OH)2. Ca(OH)2, Zn(OH)2. AI(OH)3. NH4OH, Li2CO3, Na2CO3. K2CO3, MgCO3,<br>
CaCCb. ZnCCb, (NH4)2CO3. BaCO3. CaMg(CO3)2, NaHC03, KHCO3. (CaO). BaO.<br>
LiNH2, NaNH2l KNH2, Mg(NH2)2, Ca(NH2)2, Zn(NH2)2, AI(NH2)3. NaH, CaH2, KH, LiH,<br>
and mixtures thereof.<br>
Organic bases include hydrocarbon compounds with C1-C9 cyclic or non-cyclic<br>

salts of formate, acetate, propylate, butanoate, benzoate, with Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Al, Zn,<br>
or any other suitable cation.<br>
The suitable bases may be dissolved, if desired, in water, an organic solvent, or a<br>
mixture of solvents before or after contacting with the product mixture. Examples of<br>
suitable solvents include, but are not limited to water, alcohols, acetonitrile,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, toluene, heptane and mixtures thereof.<br>
The amount of base to be added to the isolation blend should be enough to adjust<br>
the pH of the blend to between about 7.0 to about 14, preferably between about 9 to<br>
about 12.<br>
The temperature of the base isolation step may be carried out at temperatures<br>
between about 10°C and about the reflux temperature of the isolation blend. Preferably,<br>
the temperature is at about 40°C to about the reflux temperature, or about 60° to about<br>
the reflux temperature.<br>
Preferably, the isolation blend is mixed or stirred by any suitable method such as<br>
flow or tine mixers, or in agitated vessels using mechanical or gas agitation.<br>
The amount of time needed for the isolation step is between about 10 minutes<br>
and about 10 hours, more typically between about 1 to about 4 hours and about 1 to<br>
about 2 hours. If heat is used in the isolation step, the isolation blend may be allowed to<br>
cool.<br>
If the product mixture is contacted with the base in solid form, the isolation blend<br>
after the isolation step is typically filtered to isolate the compound of Formula 1.<br>
Although not wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the base solubilizes<br>
many of the polyphenolic- or polyresorcinol-triazine compounds and halogen-containing<br>
impurities used in the typical Friedel-Crafts reaction such that the solid mass after the<br>
isolation step contains mainly the compound of Formula 1 and trisaryl-triazines. The<br>
filtrate will be rich in the polyphenolic- or polyresorcinol-triazines and halogen-containing<br>
impurities. Impurities in the typically Friedel-Crafts reaction that is believed to be<br>
solubilized by the base include, but are not limited to compounds with the following<br>
formulas:<br>
where X, X1, X2 is a halogen or hydroxy and the other substituents are defined above.<br>
Preferred impurities which are solubilized by the base are:<br>
If a solvent is used to dissolve the product mixture, it is preferred that the solvent<br>
used to dissolve the base is substantially immiscible with the solvent used to dissolve<br>
the product mixture such that at least two distinct layers are formed. Preferably, the<br>
solvent used to dissolve the base is aqueous-based and the solvent used to dissolve the<br>
product mixture is organic-based. After the isolation step, it is believed that the<br>
aqueous-based layer will contain most of the halogen and polyresorcinol impurities,<br>
while the organic-based layer will contain mainly the compound of Formula 1 and trisaryl<br>
triazine compounds that are not soluble in the aqueous-based layer. The aqueous-<br>
based layer may be removed by any suitable process to leave the organic layer rich in<br>
the compound of Formula 1.<br>
Typically, the base isolation step involves treating the reaction mixture such that<br>
is "substantially free" of polyphenolic- or polyresorcinol-triazines and halogen-containing<br>
impurities. "Substantially free" in the present application means that at least about 80%<br>
of the undesired impurities are removed from the reaction mixture during the isolation<br>
step. Preferably the amount of impurities removed are at least about 90%, more<br>
preferably at least about 95% and even more preferably at least about 98%.<br>
It should be noted that the base isolation step of the present invention may also<br>
be used to isolate the polyphenolic- or polyresorcinol-triazine compounds. As mentioned<br>
above, the filtrate or the aqueous-based layer is rich in polyphenolic-triazine compounds.<br>
If an acid is added to the filtrate or aqueous-based layer, the polyphenolic-triazine<br>
compounds precipitate out to a solid form and may be filtered. Any suitable organic or<br>
inorganic acid may be used to precipitate the polyphenolic- or polyresorcinol-triazine<br>
compounds. Preferably, an inorganic acid is used. Examples of such inorganic acids<br>
include, but are not limited to: HCI, HBr. HI. HNO3. HNO2. H2S, H2SO4, and H3PO4<br>
Alternatively, after the acidification of the filtrate, the polyphenolic- or<br>
polyresorcinol-triazine compounds may be isolated from the aqueous layer by solvent<br>
extraction. Any suitable solvent may be used for the solvent extraction. Examples of<br>
such suitable solvents include, out are not United to: ethyl acetate, butyl acetate,<br>
dichloromethane and dicnJoroetnane.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the product mixture containing<br>
the compound of Formula 1 in solid form is contacted with a hydrocarbon solvent to<br>
remove trisaryl-triazine impurities. Suitable hydrocarbon solvents include C1-C20<br>
hydrocarbon compounds, saturated or unsaturated, cyclic or non-cyclic, and aromatic or<br>
non-aromatic. Examples of hydrocarbon solvent that may be used include, but are not<br>
limited to: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, diethylbenzene, xylene, mesitylene, tetralin,<br>
hexane, heptane, octane, cyclohexane, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The amount of said hydrocarbon solvent present in the isolation step is about 1 to<br>
about 20 parts per part compound of Formula 1, preferably about 3 to about 10 parts<br>
hydrocarbon solvent per part compound of Formula 1.<br>
The temperature of the hydrocarbon solvent isolation step is not critical and may<br>
be carried out at temperatures between about 10°C to about the reflux temperature of<br>
the isolation blend. Preferably, the temperature is about 40°C to about the reflux<br>
temperature, or about 60°C to about the reflux temperature of the isolation blend.<br>
The amount of time needed for the isolation step is typically between about 10<br>
minutes to about 10 hours, more typically between about 1 to about 4 hours or about 1<br>
to about 2 hours. If heat is used in the isolation step, the isolation blend is preferably<br>
allowed to cool.<br>
Preferably, the isolation blend is mixed or stirred by any suitable method such as<br>
flow or line mixers, or in agitated vessels using mechanical or gas agitation.<br>
After the isolation step, the isolation blend is typically filtered to isolate the<br>
compound of Formula 1.<br>
Although not wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the<br>
hydrocarbon solvent solubilizes the trisaryl triazine compounds from the solid form<br>
leaving it richer in the compound of Formula 1 after the isolation step. Typically, the<br>
hydrocarbon solvent isolation step involves treating the reaction mixture such that is<br>
substantially free of trisaryl-triazine impurities. The filtrate can be concentrated to isolate<br>
trisaryl-triazine.<br>
Preferably, the base isolation step and the hydrocarbon isolation step are both<br>
used together either in a one-step or in a step-wise fashion, in any order, to isolate the<br>
compound of Formula 1. In the present application, the term "step-wise" means a series<br>
of isolations steps are conducted. The term "one-step" means when only one isolation<br>
step is conducted.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the product mixture containing<br>
the compound of Formula 1 is contacted with an alcohol. The product mixture preferably<br>
is in solid form. The eolation blend is heated to a temperature of about 40°C to about<br>
200°C, preferably about 60°C to about 200oC, and more preferably to the reflux<br>
temperature of the blend. This isolation step is conducted for a period of about 10<br>
minutes to 10 hours, preferably about 1 to about 4 hours or about 1 to about 2 hours.<br>
Preferably, the blend is allowed to cool to below about 40°C. If the product mixture is in<br>
solid form during this alcohol isolation step, the blend would be typically filtered to isolate<br>
the compound of Formula 1.<br>
Any suitable alcohol may be used in this embodiment. Suitable alcohol<br>
compounds include carbon compounds of C1-C20. straight chain or branched, saturated<br>
or unsaturated, cyclic or non-cyclic, aromatic or non-aromatic, which has at least one<br>
hydroxyl group. Examples of suitable alcohol compounds include, but are not limited to:<br>
methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, t-butanol, 1,2-ethanediol,<br>
3-chloro-1-propanol, 2-hydroxyl-acetic acid, 1-hydroxyl-3-pentanone, cyclohexanol,<br>
cyclohexenol, glycerol, benzyl alcohol and mixtures thereof.<br>
The amount of alcohol added in the isolation step is about 1 to about 20 parts per<br>
part compound of Formula 1, preferably about 3 to about 10 parts alcohol to per part<br>
compound of Formula 1.<br>
Preferably, the isolation blend is mixed or stirred by any suitable method such as<br>
flow or line mixers, or in agitated vessels using mechanical or gas agitation.<br>
Although not wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the alcohol<br>
solubilizes many of the polyresorcinol and halogen containing impurities used in the<br>
typical Friedel-Crafts reaction such that the solid mass after the isolation step contains<br>
mainly the compound of Formula 1 and reduced levels of trisaryl-triazines. Typically, the<br>
alcohol isolation step involves treating the reaction mixture such that it is substantially<br>
free of polyresorcinol and halogen-containing impurities. The alcohol soluble filtrate can<br>
be concentrated to recover polyresorcinol-triazines.<br>
It should be noted that it is possible to dissolve the solid product mixture in an<br>
organic solvent in this alcohol isolation process. Preferably, the solvent used to dissolve<br>
the product mixture is immiscible with the alcohol such that at least two distinct layers<br>
are formed. It may be necessary to add some water to the alcohol to form the separate<br>
layers. It is believed that the alcohol-based layer will contain most of the halogen and<br>
polyresorcinol impurities, and the organic-based layer will contain mainly the compound<br>
of Formula 1 and trisaryl triazine compounds that are not soluble in the alcohol-based<br>
layer. The alcohol-based layer may be removed by any suitable process to leave the<br>
organic layer rich in the compound of Formula 1.<br>
Preferably, the alcohol isolation step and the hydrocarbon isolation step are both<br>
used together either in a one-step or in a step-wise fashion, in any order, to isolate the<br>
compound of Formula 1.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the product mixture comprising<br>
the compound of formula 1 is contacted with at least two components selected from the<br>
group consisting of a base, an alcohol and a hydrocarbon solvent. The same<br>
processing conditions and amounts as described above may be used in this<br>
embodiment. The contacting may be performed in a step-wise or one-step fashion.<br>
Preferably, either the base and hydrocarbon solvent components, or the alcohol and<br>
hydrocarbon solvent components are processed together.<br>
