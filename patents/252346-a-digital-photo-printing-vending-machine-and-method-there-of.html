The present invention relates to a digital photo-printing vending machine<br>
and method of use thereof.<br>
This invention has been divided out of Indian Patent Application No.<br>
1483/KOLNP/2003<br>
Reference is made to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/872, 424, filed<br>
on May 30, 2001, entitled "A High Speed Photo-Finishing Apparatus", which is<br>
hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Reference is also made to the -following commonly-owned patent<br>
applications, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference:<br>
A nonprovisional application (Attorney Docket No. C-8540) entitled<br>
"Technique for Printing a Color Image", filed on February 19, 2002; application<br>
Serial No. 09/817,932 filed on March 27, 2001, entitled "Digital Halftoning";<br>
application Serial No. 09/934, 703 filed on August 22, 2001, entitled "Thermal<br>
Response Correction System"; and provisional application (Attorney Docket No.<br>
C-8490) entitled "Method and Apparatus for Voltage Correction"<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
A variety of photo-printing booths are known in the art. Coin operated,<br>
booths, having fixed-lens cameras, are well known. Such prior art photo-printing<br>
booths take a series of photographs or a single photograph of an individual or<br>
group of individuals sitting in the booth at a fixed location in front of the<br>
camera. The photographs are then developed within the booth and dispensed to<br>
the user. The booth enclosure provides a controlled background and lighting.<br><br>
The booth also serves to constrain the position and poses of the user, as well as<br>
limiting the number of persons within the field of view.<br>
Illustrative systems of automatic photography equipment can be found in U.S.<br>
Pat. Nos. 3,820,133; 3,864,708; 4,072,973; 4,089,017 and 4,738,526. The photo-<br>
printing booths disclosed therein use self-developing equipment to allow for the<br>
adjustment of flash intensity and for coin actuation.<br>
Other previous photo-printing systems have been developed to accept 35 mm<br>
film from a customer and develop it. A number of chemical processing fluids<br>
need to be used to develop and stabilize an image on photographic film. These<br>
processing fluids become less effective as the chemical components are<br>
consumed and, additionally, have a limited lifetime. Spent fluids must<br>
eventually be disposed of, either by pouring down a drain, by placing in a<br>
storage tank for later transportation and disposal, or by incineration. The<br>
principal component of these fluids is water. The photofinisher must either<br>
provide a drain and water supply, or deal with transporting large volumes of<br>
spent photographic waste to a proper disposal site. In an unattended apparatus,<br>
moreover, it is difficult to control the amount of chemicals being used. In order<br>
to ensure that the appropriate amount of processing solution is always available,<br>
an excess amount of the solution is typically provided. This, however, increases<br>
the amount of effluent that must eventually be disposed of.<br>
In contrast to conventional photographic cameras, digital cameras do not use<br>
film to capture an image. There is, in this case, no need for any chemical<br>
processing to occur in a photo booth or photo vending machine. The analogous<br>
component to the negative of a conventional film camera is, in a digital camera,<br><br>
For the foregoing reasons there is a need for a high-speed digital photo-<br>
printing vending machine that will produce images of excellent quality at low cost.<br>
There is also a need for a stand-alone unit that customers can use without <br>
assistance, and which requires less support in the form of supply replenishment<br>
and waste disposal than conventional photo vending machines.<br>

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In one. aspect the present invention features a high speed digital photo<br>
printing apparatus that utilizes a plurality of thermal print heads. In one<br>
embodiment, the digital photo-printing apparatus is a customer-operated, stand-<br>
alone vending machine. Such a vending machine may be less expensive and<br>
easier to maintain than conventional photo-printing vending machines thereby<br>
enabling small retail establishments to enter the digital photo-printing business.<br>
The apparatus may print digital images at high speeds, such as about 20-60<br>
pictures per minute. These high speeds may be obtained by using a thermal<br>
transfer printer with multiple thermal print heads, each head printing a separate<br>
color. The photo-printing apparatus may also have multiple Input means so that<br>
a user may input images from a variety of sources. The photo-printing apparatus<br>
may include a housing to substantially contain the various components that the<br>
apparatus uses to perform the functions described herein.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1A, in one embodiment of the present invention, a digital<br>
photo-printing apparatus 100 is provided. The photo-printing apparatus includes<br>
photo-printing image data input means 110, output selection means 120,<br>
payment means 130, image file preparation means 140, image file processing<br>
means 150, and output means 160.<br>
FIG. 1A illustrates components of the photo-printing apparatus in the<br>
sequence in which such components operate in one embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Referring to FIG. 1B, a dataflow diagram is shown which illustrates<br>
the flow of data through the photo-printing apparatus in one embodiment of the<br><br>
present invention. The ohoto-printing apparatus 100 may for example be a<br>
vending machine which conducts a transaction with a customer 162.<br>
The photo-printing apparatus 100 includes a customer interface 178 for<br>
interacting with the customer 162. The customer Interface 178 may include data<br>
 entry means 182 for receiving customer interface input 170 from the user and<br>
display means 180 for displaying customer interface output 168 to the user. As<br>
described in more detail below, the customer interface 178 may interact with<br>
other components of the photo-printing apparatus 100 and permit the user to<br>
make various choices during the transaction. The customer interface 178 may,<br>
for example, allow the user to select a desired image data Input means and<br>
payment means, and to exercise options with respect to Image selection, number<br>
of prints, image processing, and output formats. Features of the customer<br>
interface 178 may be implemented In software executing on a processor (not<br>
shown) within the photo-printing apparatus 100.<br>
The display means 180 may, for example, be an interactive video monitor<br>
for displaying instructional order information which is used by the customer 162<br>
for entering appropriate order information. The display means 180 may also be<br>
used for various other functions as described later herein, for example, but not<br>
by way of limitation, the display device may be used to preview images prior to<br>
printing of the images, and used as a touch screen for customer order<br>
selections.<br>
The data entry means 182 may be any means for receiving input from the<br>
user, such as a keyboard, touch screen, mouse, card reader for reading a<br><br>
previously issued Customer order card (which could include customer photo<br>
printing preferences) of any combination thereof. The data entry means 182 and<br>
display means 180 may be implemented using a single component, as in the<br>
case where both the data entry means 182 and display means 180 are<br>
implemented using a single touch screen.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1A and IB, In one embodiment the customer 162<br>
possesses an input image medium 164 containing one or more input images<br>
(e.g., digital photographs) to print. The input image medium 164 may be any of a<br>
variety of kinds of input media, such as PCMCIA cards, ZIP disks, compact flash<br>
cards., Smart Media, Memory Sticks, CDs, floppy disks, photographic negatives<br>
or prints, or a digital camera.<br>
If the input images are stored electronically on the input image medium<br>
164, each input image may be stored in a separate file. File formats suitable for<br>
storing digital Images include but are not limited to JPEG, TIFF, and BMP. One<br>
or more of the input images may be compressed into a single file (such as a ZIP<br>
file) on the input image medium 164.<br>
The first step of the transaction between the customer 162 and the photo-<br>
printing apparatus 100 is for the customer 162 to provide the input image<br>
medium 164 to the photo-printing apparatus 100 using the image data input<br>
means 110. The image data input means 110 extracts the input image(s) from<br>
the input image medium 164 to produce input image data 172.<br>
The image data input means 110 may include any of a variety of data<br>
storage/retrieval devices, including but not limited to CD drives (such as CD-<br><br>
ROM,CD-R, and CDRW drives),PCMCIA card slots floppy disk drives,zip disk <br>
 drives scanners, smart media readers and compact flash media readers.<br>
The image data input means 110 may also include a wireless device that<br>
is capable of communicating with a camera, computer, or hand-held device over<br>
a wireless (e.g. infrared of radio) connection. The image data input means 110<br>
may include one or more devices that communicate over a direct physical<br>
connection such as a cable connection to a camera scanner internet or other<br>
device or network.<br>
Although the input image medium 164 may be any of various kinds of<br>
media, certain kinds of image data input means 110 may only be capable of<br>
receiving certain kinds of media, if, for example, the image data input means 110<br>
is a CD drive, the input image medium may be a CD.<br>
When the image data input means is a camera, the function of a "single-<br>
use" film camera may be mimicked. !n this case, a special disposable digital<br>
camera may be sold to the customer 162 at retail. After taking up to as many<br>
pictures as will occupy the memory provided within the camera, the customer<br>
may deliver the camera to a receptacle in the photo-printing apparatus 100. The<br>
data may then be transferred from the camera to the photo-printing apparatus<br>
100 by direct electrical or wireless connection, allowing the apparatus 100 to<br>
deliver printed pictures to the customer 162. The camera may be<br>
preprogrammed to become inoperable after a preset number of photographs<br>
have been taken, after a preset time, after a preset amount of camera memory<br>
has been filled or after a predetermined number of photographs have been<br><br>
printed <br>
camera unit may be reprogrammed or remanufactured allowing reuse of of optical<br>
components and reducing the cost of a camera. Altenatively the photo-printing<br>
apparatus 100 of the present invention may disable the camera, by some<br>
mechanical or electrical means, after printing a predetermined number of<br>
photographs, after determining from digital information in the camera that a<br>
preset number of photographs have been taken or printed, or that a preset<br>
period of time has been exceeded, or that a preset amount of memory has been<br>
filled. Means of disabling the camera may include, for example. electrically<br>
rfamnninn a critical link nr mmnnnpnt in the electric3' rims lit Hi^ahlinn a shiittpr<br>
or lens system, or r'ermanenih/ changing configuration information stored in the<br>
camera. Prior to disabling the camera, it may be a function of the kiosk to offer<br>
the customer an. option, to store the digital photographs on a storage medium<br>
such as CD-ROM, using one of the output means 160, or to transfer the digital<br>
photographs to an accessible network location for iater use.<br>

printers for use with a single-sheet, direct thermal medium, rather than a two-<br>
sheet thermal transfer medium. In this case, one color is fixed by exposure to<br>
ultraviolet or visible radiation before the next is printed, with the result that the<br>
medium is photosensitive. The two-sheet, thermal transfer printers described<br>
above have the advantage that the media used in. such printers are not<br>
photosensitive.<br>
One embodiment of the output means 160 for the vending machine is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 2. Referring now to FIG. 2, there is a receiver element 210, fed<br>
from a roll 214. Although the path of receiver element 210 is shown as straight in<br>
FIG. 2, it should be understood that other paths, for example curved or arcuate<br>
paths, may also be used. The receiver is translated past three thermal print<br>
heads 216, 218 and 220, opposed by platen rollers 222. The first thermal print<br><br>

thermal mass transfer donor element according to the invention is described in<br>
U.S. provisional patent application serial number 60/294,528, cited above.<br>
Receiver element 210 may be opaque or transparent, in the case where<br>
receiver element 210 is transparent, and a reflective print is the desired output,<br>
substrate 242 is desirably opaque, and the final image is viewed through receiver<br>
element 210. In the case wherein receiver element 210 is opaque, and the<br>
materia! transferred by element 240 is transparent, the final image is viewed<br>
through the materia! transferred by element 240. The image printed in one case<br>
is the mirror image of that printed in the other.<br>
Variation in level of color in an image produced by thermal transfer<br>
printing may be achieved by means of two general methods. In the first method,<br><br>

As described in the above-referenced patent application entitled<br>
"Technique for Printing a Color Image," in a multi-head thermal transfer printing<br>
system a serious problem of misregistration may occur in the color images<br>
produced by superimposed dot patterns. Such, misregistration may occur as a<br>
result of print head misalignment, speed variations in the media transport,<br>

selected to cause a pattern of intentional misreQistration at a hioh snatia!<br>

which masks the unintentional misalignments caused by mechanical<br>

•n one embodiment of the above-referenced patent application entitled<br>
"Technique for Printino a Color Image/' thermal Imaging is used and the surface<br>
nnto whir.h nrintinn is nerfnrmed is a receiver substrate. The substrate is tvoicallv<br>
a web and is reeled in a first direction at a first speed. First, second, and third<br>
thermal print heads are displaced from each other in the first direction and are<br>
each fixedly mounted relative to the moving receiver. The first head includes a<br>
first predetermined number of elements linearly and regularly displaced over a<br>
fixed distance in a direction parallel to the surface and perpendicular to the first<br>
direction. This fixed distance defines one dimension of a field of view of the<br>
image. The second head includes a second predetermined number of elements<br>
linearly and regularly displaced over the fixed distance within the field of view<br>
and in a direction parallel to the surface and perpendicular to the first direction.<br>
The third head includes a third predetermined number of elements linearly and<br><br>
ink donor ribbons In the colors of cyan, maoenta snd ve-low are used with the<br>
thr@p orint heads. Any order of printlno of the colors msy be used. However as<br>
described in the above-referenced oalent application entitled "Technioue for<br>
Printino a Co;or jmsoe." the visibie effects of misreoistrstion occur chief lv as a<br>
result of misreoistration between maoenta and the two other colors. Therefore in<br>
8 three head svstem, the resolution of the sprint heads used to orint yellow 3nd<br>
cyan may be the same, whereas the resolution of the print head used to print<br>
maoenta roav be different from the resolution of either the print head used to<br>
print yellow or the nrjnt head used to print cyan. When a fourth head associated<br>
with black is included, resolution of that fourth head may differ from resolutions<br>
of the three remaining heads<br>
In yet another feature of the above-referenced patent application entitled<br>
"Technique for Printing a Color Image," there Is a first predetermined distance<br>
between dots along a first direction (the direction of media transport) and a<br>
second .predetermined distance between dots along a second direction<br>
(perpendicular to the direction of media transport), and the first and second<br>
predetermined distances are controlled in the following manner. A clock<br>
generator generates a plurality of timing clock pulse trains. A computer-<br>
controlled pulse generator is operatively coupled to the clock generator and<br>
provides a plurality of outputs of excitation pulse bursts in timed sequence with at<br>
least one of the clock pulse trains. The first predetermined number of thermally<br><br>

output means 160 of FIGS. 1A-1B of the instant invention, each element of the<br>
cyan-printing head and each element of the yellow-printing head deposit 400<br>
dots per inch on the surface within the field of view of the image, with each<br>
respective one of the 400 dots per inch from the yellow-printing head intending to<br>
be deposited upon its corresponding one of the 400 dots per inch from the first<br>
print head. Since there is minima! spectra! overlap between these colors,<br>
although being subjected to a dot-on-dot procedure, precise registration of the<br>
yellow and cyan dots is unnecessary. Each element of the print head which<br>
prints magenta is controlled to deposit 266 dots per inch on the surface<br><br>

nisne Thermal printers are known to produce substantia^ deviations from<br>
intended irpaoe densities as a result of imperfect coollna foHowino nmviousiv<br>
printed patterns. In addition, heat may diffuse laterally within the print head<br>
itself, resulting in printed densities that are dependent on the temperatures of<br>
neighboring print head elements.<br>
!n one embodiment, monochrome image processing and printer control<br>
means 404a-c perform a method of thermal history control in which a numerical<br>
model of heat diffusion and a model of the response of the thermal printing<br>
medium to a given input of energy are combined to correct for the<br>
abovementioned effects. An example method for compensating for the effects of<br><br>

of course, possible to stipulate a tioht tolerance on the resistance variation<br>
across the print head at the time of manufacture. However, this increases the<br>
cost of the print head, and may reduce its useful life if changes in the resistance<br>
of elements occur as a result of use.<br>
Various embodiments of the present invention may therefore measure the<br>
resistance profile of the print head and compensate for nonuniformities in printed<br>
output. Such a measurement may occur within the photo-printer itself.<br>
Alternatively, the resistance profile of the print head may be measured prior to its<br>
installation in the photo-printer, and the data stored in an appropriate memory<br>

available for printinci. if the number of these levels Is insufficient, the transition<br>
from one tone value to the next may be visible In the image as steps or contours.<br>
A method for increasing the apparent number of tone scale values is known in<br>
the art as dithering. The dithering method Is effective In overcoming tona! steps<br>

Patent Application Ser. No. 09/817,932, filed March 27, 2001, entitled "Digital<br>
Half toning," having inventors Dan Bybell, Jay Thornton, and Dana Schuh, which<br>
is assigned to the assignee of the instant application and which, along with all of<br>
its incorporated-by-reference patents and patent applications, is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. As is known in the art, the<br>
dithering described may be accomplished with the use of dithering matrices that<br>
are combined with floating point image data to produce the required digital<br><br>
vsiues for each oixs!. =n on© embodiment of the Instant invention tng dith^rinn<br>
The forenoino stens msv be-carried out in software running-on the serve?"<br>
described above'1. The data thereby generated may, In one embodiment be sent<br>
to the FPGA described above via a memory buffer interface. The FPGA<br>
performs the functions of a pattern generator and a clock. The lookun index<br>
value whose Generation was described above is used, in conjunction with<br>
predetermined oaffems Stored in 3 InokijO table to Generate th
pattern to be sent to the nrint head. The pulse pattern for a ^articular color is<br>
then sent to its associated print head at a rate determined by the FPGA clock.<br>
The rates at which the f-u'se Patterns for each color plane are sent are such that<br>
each monochrome image is the same length when printed. Temporal offsets<br>
accounting for the physical separation between print heads are added to the<br>
start of the processes of sending the pulse patterns for each color, so that each<br>
monochrome Image overlies the others as accurately as possible in the final<br>
print.<br>
In one embodiment, one function of the pattern generator is the<br>
performance of halftone dot location adjustment to improve the perceived quality<br>
of printed images. This technique is described in the above-referenced patent<br>
application entitled "Digital Halftoning." Consider, for example, two adjacent<br>
halftone pixels, each of which contains a halftone dot. The two halftone pixels<br>
share a common pixel boundary. The two halftone dots may be located within<br>
their respective halftone pixels such that the two halftone dots abut the common<br><br>
some or all of ths halftone oixels In the Irnso© to be Dflnted. x/grini;«<br>

conjunction with pulse pattern lookup table 513 to produce pulse patterns stored<br>
in pulse pattern memory 514. Under the control of clock generator means 520,<br>
the stored pulse patterns are serially transferred to the print head. As they are<br>
transferred, duty cycle correction means 516 monitors the number of<br>
simultaneously active print head elements and adjusts the length of the print<br>
head strobe signal accordingly, as described in the above-referenced provisional<br>
patent application entitled "Method and Apparatus for Voltage Correction." This<br>
corrects for the fact that the voltage across any single resistor depends upon the<br>
total number of print head elements being powered during a particular print<br>
