THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 (39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10, rule 13)<br>
A STRIP MEMBER FOR LOCKING PLURALITY OF OUTLETS BY MEANS OF SINGLE PADLOCK<br>
GODREJ &amp; BOYCE MFG. CO. LTD. of LOCKS DIVISION PLANT-18, PIROJSHANAGAR, VIKHROLI, MUMBAI - 4 00 079 MAHARASHTRA, India, a INDIAN National Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
2 5 FEB 2004<br><br>
The invention relates to a Strip Member for locking plurality of	outlets by means<br>
of single Padlock.   More particularly the invention relates to  a	strip member for<br>
locking plurality of outlets by means of single padlock	for transporting<br>
inflammable liquid material to the destination securely.<br>
The conventional locking system used for transporting inflammable, hazardous material which are very sensitive to spark are kept in partitions in the tanker where there are several outlets which required to be locked. The conventional system of locking can   be  tampered open &amp; closed and therefore not safe.<br>
The inventor with great search has come out with a strip member for locking of plurality of outlets by means of single padlock where the genuine material can be transported safely.<br>
The primary object of this invention is to provide a strip member for locking of plurality of outlets by means of single padlock which prevents spark and genuinity of material is kept intact.<br>
Accordingly there is provided a strip member for locking of plurality of outlets by means of single padlock (1) comprising a flat bottom strip member (2) with multiplicity of cylindrical stem member (3) riveted on it with round heads of greater diameter (4) positioned at matching with spacing of outlets / valve wheels; a flat top strip (5) with plurality of larger holes (6) with smaller U shape slots (7) slideably connected below the head portion at matching space so that when the top strip is introduced through the larger hole and pushed side ways to lock the top strip through the smaller U shape slot against the head portion thereby the top strip is brought to the bottom strip and locked by means of a padlock which passes through the grooves  of bottom  &amp; top strip  (8)   and thus<br>
2<br><br>
the strips are  locked by means of a padlock.<br>
Our Co-Pending Application No : 834/MUM/2001<br>
The invention will now be described With reference to figure 1 and 2 in the accompanying drawing.<br>
Figure 1: is a schematic view of a strip member for locking plurality of outlets by means of single padlock showing top &amp; bottom strip with bolt member.<br>
Figure 2 : is a elevation of a strip member for locking plurality of outlets by means of single padlock.<br>
Referring to figure 1 and 2 of a strip member for locking of plurality of outlets by means of single padlock (1) comprising a flat bottom strip member (2) with multiplicity of cylindrical stem member (3) riveted on it with round heads of greater diameter (4) positioned at space on the bottom strip matching to the spacing of the outlets / valve wheels; a flat top strip (5) with plurality of larger holes (6) with smaller U shape slots (7) slideably connected below the head portion at space so that when the top strip is introduced through the larger hole and pushed side ways to lock the top strip through the smaller U shape slot against the head portion thereby the top strip is brought to the bottom strip and locked by means of a padlock which passes through the grooves of bottom &amp; top strip (8)   and thus the strips are  locked by means of a padlock.<br>
A Strip Member for locking plurality of outlets by means of single Padlock wherein the top strip and bottom strips are locked at one end having holes &amp; at other end in the both the strips so that in the assembled condition the top and bottom   hole will match   together   through   which the strip   can be locked<br>
3<br><br>
by means of a padlock. The strip having plurality of hole spaced regularly or irregularly so that the multiplicity of outlet having holes in the wheel in the stem member in the tanker transporting liquid material of inflammable / sensitive in nature can be locked so as to preserve the genuinity of the material without any adulteration or pilferage during transport by unauthorised people.<br>
There is a provision that the master key is provided to the filing source and different common key to the individual user at the outlets so that filling and unloading is possible by authorized   people only.<br>
A liquid tanker cylindrical in shape, horizontally placed on the truck are provided with compartments inside the container with individual inlet and outlet valves. The outlets valves are on the tank with the stem member and the wheel for opening and closing the mouth of the outlet. Generally it was observed that during handling of the liquid, contents very often give rise to spurious substance and loss of liquid material and pilferage during transport. Therefore the object was to prevent such malpractice's. The inventors has devised a strip member for locking plurality of outlets by means of a single padlock thereby preventing such malpractice's. So as to keep the genuinity of the material intact and   goodwill of the manufacturer, distributors.<br>
An ultra locking system of padlock with / without restricted keyways with master key with the locking strip effectively prevents such malpractice's.<br>
This is an embodiment of the invention. Several modifications are possible and may be considered within the ambit and spirit of this invention. Since many modifications, variations and changes in detail may be made to the above described embodiments, it is intended that all matters described in the foregoing description as described in the accompanying specification.<br>
4<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A strip member for locking of plurality of outlets by means of single padlock (1) comprising of a flat bottom strip member (2) with multiplicity of cylindrical stem member (3) riveted on it with round heads of greater diameter (4) positioned at space on the bottom strip matching to the spacing of the outlets / valves; a flat top strip (5) with plurality of larger holes (6) with smaller U shape slots (7) slideably connected below the head portion at space so that when the top strip is introduced through the larger hole and pushed side ways to lock the top strip through the smaller U shape slot against the head portion thereby the top strip is brought to the bottom strip and lock by means of a padlock which passes through the grooves of bottom &amp; top strip (8) and thus the strips are locked by means of a padlock.<br>
2.	A Strip Member (1) for locking plurality of outlets by means of single Padlock as claimed in claim 1 wherein the strip member are made from brass stainless steel, iron or any non ferrous / composite strong material.<br>
3.	A Strip Member (1) for locking plurality of outlets by means of single Padlock as claimed in claim 1 wherein the padlock can be of any type with or without restricted key way.<br>
