TITLE<br>
CATALYST COMPONENTS FOR THE POLYMERIZATION OF OLEFINS<br>
The present invention relates to catalyst components for the polymerization of ethylene and its mixtures with olefins  wherein R is an alky!, cycjoalkyi or aryl radical<br>
having 1-12 carbon atoms, comprising Ti, Mg. halogen, and a particular electron donor compound. The catalyst component of the invention is suitably used in (co)poiymerization processes of ethylene to prepare (co)po)ymcrs liaving narrow Molecular Weight Distribution (MWD), high bulk density and wide range of average particle size. The MWD is an important characteristic of ethylene polymers in that it affects their rheological behavior, their proccssability, and their final mcchanieal properties. In particular, polymers with narrow MWD arc suitable for films and injection molding in that deformation and shrinkage prob!cm.s in the manufactured article arc minimized. The width of the molecular weight distribution for the ethylene polymers is generally expressed as melt flow ratio F/E, which is the ratio between the melt index measured by a load of 21.6 Kg (melt index F) and that mea.sured with a load of 2.16 Kg (melt index E)., The measurements of melt index are carried out according to ASTM D-<br><br>
are described in the European patent application EP-A-373999. The catalyst comprises a solid catalyst component consisting of a titanium compound supported on magnesium chloride, an alkyl-AI compound and an electron donor compound (external donor) selected fi'om monoethcrs of the formula R'OR". Good results in terms of narrow MWD are only obtained when the solid component also contains an internal electron donor compound (dii so butyl phthalate). The catalyst activity is rather low and. in addition, the cited document does not disclose or teach anything about the polymer bulk density provided by the cataly.?t. This latter characteristic is very important in the operation of the plants because it assures smooth polymer flow and high productivity. I lencc, it would be highly desirable to have a catalyst capable to produce polymers in high yields with narrow molecular weight distribution and high bulk density.<br>
Moreover, it would be also desirable that the catalyst component be able to produce polymers having a variable and flexible range of average particle size in order to broaden<br>
1<br><br><br>
the range of applit;ability and making possiblL' their use also in ga^-pliasc polymerization technology.<br>
JP 2003-32151 1 discloses polyniCTization of ethylene in the presence of a catalyst the preparation of which includes the use of Mg metal, oxygenated compounds^ among which 1,2-dimethoxypropaiie. a titanium compound to fomi a get-like solution from which -d solid is precipitated by the aid oFa chlorinating agent. Although polymers with ^rrow MWD and high bulk density arc obtained, the average particle size of the polymer is not large enough to allow the use in gas-phase polymerization.<br>
The appiicant has now found calalys't components in sttbytantially spherical fomt capable of satisfying the above-mentioned needs that comprise Mg, Ti. and halogen as essential elements and containing an electron donor compound of fonnula (I)<br><br>
it! which Ra is a methyl group or hydrogen or is condensed with Rj to form a cycle. Rj, RT and R; are, independently, hydrogen or C1-C20 hydrocarbon groups, possibly containing hetcroatoms, Ri and R? are C1-C20 alkyl groups, or R(,CO- groups where R^, is a C1-C20 alky! gro-up, or they can be joined with R and Rs respectively to fonn a cycle; with the provisos that when R;, is hydrogen R4 and R? are not siniultaneoiisly methyl and when Raand R4 form a cycle Rs !,sC!-C20alky] group.<br>
Preferably, in the electron donor compound of formula (1). R^ is methyl.<br>
Preferably, in the electron donor compound of fonnula (1) Ri to R-, are hydrogen. When R4 and R5 are alkyl groups they are preferably chosen among C1-C5 alkyl groups and more preferably among methyl or ethyl. Preferably they are both methyl. Among R(,CO grtiLips preferred is acetyl.<br>
Specific electron donor compounds of Ibnnula (I) are ethylene glycol diacetate, i,2-dimethoxypropane, 1,2-diethoxypropane, methyl fetrahydrofiirftiryl ether. 1,2-diiuethoxypropanc being the most preferred.<br>
2<br><br>
The tenii substantially in spherical form means particles in which the ratio among the longor axis and the shorter axis is cc]Liai to. or lower than. 1.5 and preferably lower than i .3. Sueh values can be measure via known methods siieh as optical or electronic microseopy, PsTtsciihrly preferred arc the solid catalyst components in which the Tl atoms derive from a titanium compound which contains at least one Ti-ha!ogcn i,-)ond and the Mg atoms derive from niagnesium chloride. In a still more prefciTed aspect both the titanium compound and the electron donor of fonniila (1) are supported on magnesium dichloride. Preferably, in the catalyst of the present invention at least 70% of the titanium atoms and more preferably at least 90% of them, are in the +-4 valence state.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the magnesium dichloride is in active form. The active form of magnemun dichloride presen! in the catalyst components of flic iiu'ention is rccogniziihic by the fact that in the X-ray spectrum of tlie catalyst component the major intensity reflection which appears in the spectrum of the non-activated magnesium dichloride (having usually surface area smaller than 3 m'/g) is no longer present, but in its place there is a halo with the position of the maximum intensity shifted with respect to the position of the major intensity reflection, or by the fact tliat the major intensity reflection presents a half-peak breadth at least 30% greater that the one of the corresponding reflection of the non-activated Mg dichloride. The most active fonus are Oiosc in w-liich the halo appears in the X-ray spectixim of the solid catalyst component.<br>
In the case of the most active forms of magnesium dichloride, the halo appears in place of the reflection which in the spectrum of the non-activated magnesium chloride is situated at the intcrplanar distance of 2.56 k.<br>
Preferred titanium compountls are the halides or the compounds of tbnnula TiX„(0R')4.„. where l<n x is halogen preferably chlorine and r ci-cjo hydrocarbon group. especialiy preferred titanium compounds are tetrachloride the of formula ticl where has meaning given above in particular selected fi methyl n-butyl or isopropyl.></n>
One preferred way to prepare the substantially spherical catalyst components is by reacting the ritanium compound having at least a Ti-halogen bond   with an adduct of formula a MgCli^nROH adduct in the fonn of substantially spherical particles, where n is generally ftoiTi 1 to6, antlROH is an alcohol in the presence of the electron donor of formula (I). In particular, the MgCl;«nROIl is caused to react with an C.KCCSS of liquid TiCU containing<br><br><br><br>
temperature initially is troin 0° to 25"C, and is tlien increased to 80-n5"C. Then, the !^olid may be reacted once more with TiCU separated and washed with a liquid hydrocarbon until no chlorine ions can be detected in tlic wash liquid. The electron donor compound of fonnula (I) is preferably added together with the titanium compound to the reaction system. However, it can also be first contacted with the adduct alone and tlicn the so formed produel reacted with the titanium compound. As an alternative method, the electron donor compound can be added after the completjon of the reaction bctwccji tbe ;iddnct anil tlie titanium coinpound.<br>
The MgCli'nROH adduct can be prepared in spherical fonn from melted adducts. by emiilsilying tbe adducts in a liquid hydrocarbon and thereafter causing them to solidify by fast quenching. Representative methods for the preparation of these sphcrica! adducts arc reported for example in USP 4.469.64g, USP 4.399.054, and WO9SV44009. Another useable method for the sphemlization is the spray cooling described for example in USP 5,100,849 and 4.829,034.<br>
jn a preferred aspect of the present invention, before being reacted with the titanium compound, the sphcmlized adducts are subjected to thennal dealcoholation at a tcinperature ranging from 50 and 150°C iirrtii the alcohol contant is reduced to values tower than 2 and preferably ranging from 0.3 andL5 mols per mol of magnesium chloride. Optionally, said dealcoholated adducts can be finally treated with ehcmicai reagents capable of reacting with the OH groups of the alcohol and of further dcaleoholating the adduct until the content is reduced to values which are generally lower thau 0.5 mols. ■Rie MgClT/'electron donor of (brmiila (1) molar ratio used in the reactions indicated above preferably ranges from 1:1 to 40:1, preferably from 8;i to 35:1.<br>
The particle size of the catalyst components obtanied with this method is easily controllable and can vary over a broad range for example from i to 150 [im. This allows the preparation of both components with a small avci-ags ]jarticle size (in the range of 5-20 pm) uscftil for slurry polymerization and cotriponenls with a medium large partieJe size ("over 30 [imi particularly suitable for gas-phase polymerization. Also the particle size distribution is narrow being the SPAN of the catalyst particles comprised between 0.7 and ! .3 prcterably<br><br>
lower than that value; PIO is the value of the diameter such that 10% of the total volume<br>
4<br><br><br>
of particles have a diameter lower than that \aiue and P50 is the value of the diameter siieh that 50% of the total volume of parLiclcs huvc a diameter lower than that value. In particular, with the catalyst of the invention it is possible to produce polymers with average particle size over 350 [im, particularly over 500 um which would be suitabic for gas-phase polymerization and are not obtained in JP 2003-321511. Moreover, the said polymers arc also endowed with a narrow molecular weight distribution (F/'E ratio lower than 30) and a high bulk density (typically over 0.3 g/cm').<br>
The solid catalyst components according to the present invention arc converted into catalysts for the polymerization of olefins by reacting them with organoaluirtintim compounds according to known methods.<br>
In particular, it is an object of the present invention a eatalysl for the polymerization of olefins CH2=CnR, in which R is hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl radical with 1-12 carbon atoms. comprising the product of the reaction between:<br>
(a)	a solid catalyst coinponent as described above,<br>
(b)	an alkylahiminum compound and, optionally,<br>
(c)	an external electron donor compound.<br>
The alkyl-Al compound can be preferably selected from the trialkyi alominitm compounds such as for example trimethylaluinimim (TMA). triethylaluminum (TEAL), triisobutylaluminum (TIBA)), tri-n-butyl aluminum, iri-n-hexyl aluminum, tri-n-octylaluminum. Also alkylaluminum halides and in particular alkylaiuminum chlorides such as diethylaluminuni chloride (DEAC|, diisobutylaliimunum chloride. Ai-sesgiiichloride and dimethylaluminLim chloride (DMAC) can be used. It is also possible to use, and in certain cases preferred, mixtures of trialkylalumimim's with alkylaluminum halides. Among them mixtures between TEAL and DEAC arc particularly preferred. The use of TEAL and TIBA. alone or in mixUire is also preferred. Particularly preferred is also the use of TMA.<br>
The external electron donor compotind can be selected from the group consisting of ethers.       ■   ■ esters, amines, ketones, nitrilcs, silanes and mixtures of the above. In particular, it can advantageously be selected from the C2-C20 aliphatic ethers and in particulars cyclic ethers preferably  having 3-5  carbon atoms  cyclic ethers  such  as  tetrahydroiiirane. dioxanc. In addition, the electron donor coiupound can also be advantageously selected from<br><br>
5<br><br>
integer from 1 to 3 and the mm (a+b+c) is 4: R". R'\ and R'. ai'c alk\'l, cycloalky! or aryi radicals with 1-18 carbon atoms optionally containing hctcroatoms. Particularly preferred are the sihcon compounds in which .a is 0. c is 3. R' IS a branched alkyl or cycloalkyl group, optionally containing helcroatoms, and R is methyl. Examples of such preferred sjlicon compounds are cycjohcxyltrimethoxysilane. t-butyltrimethoxysilane and thexyltriinethoxysilane.<br>
The above mentioned components (a)-(e) can be fed separately into the reactor where, under the polymerization (xmditioris can exploit their activity. It may be advantageous the prc-contact of the above components, optionally in the presence of small amounts of olefins, for a period of time ranging from 0,1 to 120 minutes preferably in the range from 1 to 60 minutes. The pi-e-contact can be eanicd our in a liquid diluent at a temperamrc ranging from 0 to 90°C preferably in the range of 20 to 70°C.<br>
The catalyst system disclosed above can be used directly in the main polymerization process or alternatively, it can be pic-polymerized beforehand. A pre-polymerization step is nsualiy preferred when the main polymerization process is carried out in the gas phase. The prcpolymcrization can be carried out with any ofthc olefins Clh^CMR, where R is H or a Cl-ClO hydrocarbon group. In particular, it is especially preferred to prc-polymerizc ethylene, propylene or mixtures thereof with one or more a-oicfins, said mixtures containing up to 20% in moles of a-olefm, fomiing amounts of polymer from about O.i g per grain of solid component up to about 1000 g per gram of solid catalyst component. The pre-polymerization step can be carried out at temperatures from 0 to 80°C, preferably from 5 to 70°C, in the liquid or g'as phase. The pre-polymerization step can be perfonned in-line as a part of a continuous polymerization process or separately in a batch process. The batch pre-polymerization of the catalyst of the iriveiilion with ethylene in order to produce an amount of polymer ranging from 0.5 to 20 g per gram of catalyst component is particularly preferred. The pre-polymei-ized catalyst component can also be subject to a ftirther treatment with a titanium compound before being used in the main polymerization step. In this ease the use of TiCL- is particularly preferred. The reaction with the Ti compound can be carried out by suspending the prcpolyracrized catalyst component in the liquid Ti compound optionaiiy in mixUire with a liquid diluent; the mixture is heated to 60-120°C and kept at this temperature for 0.5-2 hours.<br>
The catalysts ofthc invention can be used in any kind of polymerization process both in liquid and gas-phase processes. Catalysts in which the solid catalyst component has small<br>
6<br><br>
average particle size, such as less than 30um, preferably ranging from 5 io 20 ]xm. arc particularly suited for slurry polymcrizaiion in an inert mediuin. which can be carried out continuously stirred tank reactor or in loop reactors, in a preferred erabodiinent the solid catalyst components having small average particle size as described arc particularly suited for the use in Two or more cascade loop or stincd tank reactors producing polymers with different molecular weight and/or different composition in each reactor. Catalysts in which the solid catalyst component has mcdiuni'large average particle size such as at least 30 ^ini and preferably ranging from 50 to 100 fim are particLilarly suited for gas^-phase polymerization processes which can be carried out in agitated or fluidizcd bed gas-phase reactors. Also in this case use of the catalyst in plant set-up comprising two or more cascade reactors working under different conditions to prepare polymers with different molecular weight and/or composition is particularly preferred.<br>
As already mentioned, the catalysts of the present invention are particularly suitable for preparing ethylene polymers havmg narrow molecular weight distribution that are characterized by a F/E ratio of lower than 30 in combination with a high bulk density. When ethylene is polymerized together with a minor amount of an alpha-olefm as comonomer, selected from propylene, buetcne-l. hcxcne-1 and octcne-l. a linear low density polyethylene having a density lower than 0.940 g/cm"' is obtained with a very good quality which is indicated by the low ratio (lower than 1.4) among weight of xilene soluble fraction and weight percentage of comonomer in the chain. In addition, the catalysts of the invention also show the capability of producing polymers with a high bulk density, typicaily over 0.3g/ctn"' and high activity, generally higher than 30Kg/g cat. In addition, to the ethylene homo and eopolyiuers mentioned above the catalysts of the present invention are also suitable for preparing ver&gt;'-low-density and ultra-low-density polyethylenes (VLDPE and ULDPE, having a density lower than 0.920 g/cm\ to 0.880 g/'cm") consisting of copolymers of ethylene with one or more alpha-olcfins having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms, having a mole content of units derived from ethylene of higher than 80%; elastonieric copolymers of ethylene and propylene and elastomcric terpotymers of ethylene and propyiene with smaller proportions of a diene having a content by weight of units derived from ethylene of between about 30 and 70%.<br>
The following examples arc given in order to flirther describe the present invention in a non-limiting manner. CHARACTERIZATION<br>

and pressure indicator, feed line for ethylene, propane, hydrogen. I -botenc and a steel<br>
vial for the injection of the catalyst was used and purified by flushing ethylene at 80^C<br>
and washing with propane. In the following order, 1.2g of TIBA (or 0.69 g of TEAL) and<br>
12 mg of the solid catalyst matured for 5 minutes and introduced in the empty reactor in a<br>
8<br><br>
stream of propane. The autoclave was then closed and 1.6 1 of propane were introdiieed,<br>
after which   the  temperatLire  was  raised   to  75'-'C  (10  minutes)  with   simultaneous<br>
introduction of ethylene up to 7 bar of partial pressure and  l-butcnc in the amouni<br>
reported in tabie. At the end. 1.5 bar of hydrogen (paitial presstire) were added. Under<br>
continuous stirring, the total pressure was maintained at 75°C fbr 120 minutes by feeding<br>
ethylene (if the ethylene consumption reiiches 200g. the test i^ stopped before the two<br>

Example?<br>
Into a 2 I glass reactor provided with stirrer, were introduced IL of TiCI^and 70 g of tlie<br>
support prepared as describwl in the ex;nnple [. The whole mixture was huated and kepi<br>
under stirring for 30 minutes at 75°C. After that, stirring was discontinued and the liquid<br>
siphoned off. At room temperature, 1    of fresh TiCU was introduced and immediately,<br>
7.2mL of 1.2 DMP (Mg/1,2DMP = 8 mol/mol) were added stirring the slurry. Then, the<br>
mixture was heated at 100°C and kept under stirring for 60 minutes. After that, stirring was<br>
discontinued and the slurry settled for 1 SO mimitcs. Then the liquid was siphoned off.<br>
Two washings with fi^esh hexanc (1 liter) were carried out at (jO°C and then two additional<br>
hexane washings were performed at room temperature. The spherical solid component was<br>
discharged and dried under \acuum at about 50°C.<br>
